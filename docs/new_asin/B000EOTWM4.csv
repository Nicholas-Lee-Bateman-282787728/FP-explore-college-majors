2525548,5,B000EOTWM4,"After watching this concert DVD, I will be wearing this one out very soon. What a way to go back in time and bring back great memories of our teen years. I loved cruising in my 56 and having the four tops music on my 8 track player.
Their music is timeless and with the recent passing of Levi, sure makes you thankful for the music they were able to give the world. This tribute brought me to tears, as well as others in the audience when they wheeled Levi out onto the stage to sing along with Aretha Franklin. Be sure you have the tissue ready. What a moment that was...
it was all about the love he had for his music and how it was conveyed. There will never be another Levi, but there will be The four Tops as they continue to bring their music to this generation.
This DVD is well worth getting and adding to your collection. You won't be disapointed...........",1224720000,6,866,4.22289156626506
2525549,5,B000EOTWM4,"Excellent DVD!  I watch it quite often.  The Four Tops could not have picked a better singer to replace Levi Stubbs. Theo Peoples is a phenomenal singer!  I cry each time I watch it and they bring Levi out on the stage.  I also cry to see the love between Duke, Obie and Levi, as they wipe his tears away.  This is a must have for Four Tops fans.",1184976000,8,346,3.9565217391304346
2525550,5,B000EOTWM4,"This is a great DVD.  I have watched it 50 times or more.  I love it.  It has made me start going to concerts, again.  I love the new leader of The Four Tops.  Amazon is a great source for purchasing your music materials.",1168473600,,221,3.9318181818181817
2525551,4,B000EOTWM4,"Memories - but not all of their most popular songs are featured on this 108 plus minute ( which seems edited and choppy ) 2004 concert recording from Detroit.

My main gripe is that this should have been shot in HD and used DTS to enhance the quality of this programme, even though the picture and 5.1 sound are both good.

The high and emotional point of this concert was when Levi Stubbs - the original group leader before his stroke - was introduced in his wheelchair and one could see the effort and emotion that he put in trying to remember and regain his former vocal prowess; a touching moment indeed.

Featured guests include Aretha Franklin, Mary Wilson (Supremes), Ashford & Simpson, and Paul Rodgers (Free, Bad Company, etc).

Note that the guests and artists interviews are mixed with the concert footage, thus making a lack of flow to the music.",1151798400,19,858,4.625
