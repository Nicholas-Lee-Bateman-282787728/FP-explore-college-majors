4500104,5,B004YK29IS,I was researching the Alaska Gold Rush of 1896 and this movie provided a great deal of background and interesting take on the Mounties.,1376006400,,135,4.666666666666667
4500105,5,B004YK29IS,"If you're a fan of old westerns you'll like this movie. I see several complaints here about it being a short film but seriously who wants a movie that has a dragged out feel to it? Well acted with a very real feel is what you get, sort of the old west up north.",1367280000,7,261,3.8518518518518516
4500106,5,B004YK29IS,"Well acted! This movie just pulled me in. Andrew Walker again does an incredible job as the mountie. Man, do they grow men sooo good looking in Canada",1359849600,,150,4.392857142857143
4500107,4,B004YK29IS,This movie is slow moving but the performances from the actors are all standouts.  The storyline is easy to follw..those who enjoy Westerns will like this one.,1357776000,,159,4.888888888888889
4500108,5,B004YK29IS,"""Way of the West"" I enjoyed the action sequences and thought the storyline very interesting. Andrew Walker brings a real sense of the ruggedness of the Canadian wilderness and the conditions under which the law was inforced.  Excellent",1337126400,9,235,5.184210526315789
4500109,5,B004YK29IS,"What I mean by unpolished, is that this movie's storyline is not overdramatic and superficial.  The characters and their interactions present a tough and gritty story of civilization trying to tame an uncivilized West.  The story's historical context is also fascinating for those, like myself, who aren't aware of what the Royal Mounted Police meant to the Canadian frontier.  The visuals in this movie are fantastic.  From the rough-cut wood, to the dirty peasant faces, to the simply stunning Yukon scenery, it can't be beat. It may not be the longest movie, but the scenery and authentic snapshot of Canadian frontier struggles makes this movie worth watching.",1327708800,15,664,5.177570093457944
4500110,1,B004YK29IS,"Everything about this movie is small: barely an hour long (shorter than a Disney film), barely any story (one Mountie cleans up some little settlement), no fun factor (slow action even where there's any action), small cast etc...  It does a good job of portraying the harsh realities of the period and the region (Yukon territory, the only thing that's not small in this movie), but unless you're a die hard western fan (or a Canadian history buff) I would pass without looking twice.",1312848000,6,484,4.761904761904762

4500120,5,B004YK29IS,Extraordinarily gritty. Not for the faint of heart. Fabulous cinematography. Harsh storyline. But the good guy prevails.,1440201600,,120,6.117647058823529
4500121,2,B004YK29IS,I don't even know where to start.  I was entertained by how amazingly terribly this movie was put together.  The plot is simplistic and also convoluted.  Bad flashbacks and unfinished plot lines abound.  Beautiful cinematography though.  Watch it to laugh at really bad acting and terrible lines and see really wonderful camera movement.  Plenty of shoot 'em up too.,1438992000,4,366,5.11864406779661

4500127,4,B004YK29IS,"""You Canadians are soft.""  Not hardly.  Don't watch the trailer, which is a ) terrible and b) spoils the tension.  The Yukon scenery, Robert Service poetry and a score that glides from reverie to heroic.  Acting, like the scenery, is spare.  A very fine Western.",1427846400,3,262,4.733333333333333
4500128,5,B004YK29IS,"Fans of gritty Spag, westerns might enjoy this. [although no one can duplicate those days!]But done the new way with no candy coating here of the hard times of the old west. Action,humor,and drama. All in all a decent flick and I enjoyed it being a fan of a good gritty western movie  when I can find one.",1426982400,2,305,4.258620689655173

4500134,1,B004YK29IS,"Thought with the 4 star rating this might be good but it was far from 4 star's. Don't know what the other
viewers saw that I didn't. Thankful it was only 1.99.",1386979200,,159,4.0
4500135,4,B004YK29IS,Typical western movie despite Canadian setting.  Fun ride for guns and shoot'em'up viewers.  You won't regret missing this one but it is good if you have seen everything else.,1384300800,5,175,5.0
4500136,4,B004YK29IS,"This is a good movie.  The scenery of the Canadian Yukon is amazing.

The acting is actually first rate, though I only saw one person I recognized.

The person that said 83 minutes and 82 was boring must be 14.",1381536000,5,210,4.2
