8538172,4,B0099VUXS0,"This is a wonderful French film with a charming performance by Annie Girardot.  Although it is good to find a DVD-R available with English subtitles, the print used for this release is poor.  The video looks like a VHS print, with poor contrast and faded color.  It's a pity since this is such an entertaining film.",1364860800,,315,4.589285714285714
