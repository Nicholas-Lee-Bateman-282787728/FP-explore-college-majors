8152997,4,B000JU8HDS,"If you liked Mickey Rooney in films like Boys Town, Young Tom Edison, and Riff Raff, you'll probably enjoy this earlier one, though not as much as those.  Rooney plays a crippled boy hoping to regain the use of his legs enough to ride a bike.  Ralph Bellamy (The Awful Truth, Pretty Woman) plays the country doctor supervising the boy's therapy.  But when the doctor saves the life of a rich young woman, the woman and her father tempt him away from his country practice, the crippled children who depend on him, and their nurse, with a big new clinic.  There's a dramatic conclusion involving a forest fire that threatens the children.",1213488000,,636,4.651785714285714

The film deserves a good transfer clean up, how could anyone do this to our dear Mickey Rooney?, so much is owed to this wonderful man, how about giving something good back to this great guy, like a clear dvd.  STORY lINE - Little Jimmy (Mickey Rooney-so cute), dreams of riding a shiney bicycle down the road at sixty miles an hour, but his crippled legs keep his fantasy from becoming reality. The movie than moves onto a happy little story with a happy little ending, but not a happy clear picture, I'am unhappy to say!!! Can someone please bring this out again with a happy alround ending?.",1194998400,,865,4.40625
