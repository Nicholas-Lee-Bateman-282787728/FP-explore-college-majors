8282792,5,B001BEK89W,"It's been years since I saw this movie, but it's one of the few that has made a long-term impression on me. This is the movie CRASH should have been. It's dark and gritty, so be warned.",1460332800,,185,4.027027027027027
8282793,5,B001BEK89W,"This had the same feel as Safety of Objects and at least 1 other movie I can't think of the name right now.  Where people who don't know each other come together at the end and have a life altering event.

I would recommend this movie because it prepares you to understand how each of the characters get to the point to do what they did at the end of the movie.",1410480000,,361,4.0

8282795,1,B001BEK89W,"I bought this for the sex scene with Christina Hendricks. The rest is so stupid. It's like if Justin Beiber morphed into a movie, this would be that movie.",1404518400,,155,4.379310344827586
8282796,1,B001BEK89W,"Horrible. Movie people with there own problems taking it all out on the poor overworked tired landscaper thanks to the red Neck boss...the doctor is mad that the patient is dying,the lady is already upset about something with the customer nerd bothering her the boy who doesn't see his dad much and the limo guy can't stop cheating on his girl they should make a part 2 where they all get charged with man slaughter except the landscaper.....",1399507200,,442,4.67948717948718
8282797,1,B001BEK89W,"This was truly a waste of film. If you are waiting to see what the correlation between the characters are, don't it never defines itself. I wish I could give it a lower rating.",1398470400,,176,4.205882352941177
8282798,1,B001BEK89W,"Honestly one of the worst movies I've even had the misfortune of watching.  The side-stories have absolutely no point, the characters have no connection except the ending, and it appears they went to the bad acting school to get the cast.

A movie I wish could be unmade.",1337731200,,271,4.625
8282799,1,B001BEK89W,"A truly dreadful film, and left me quite angry at the end!!  I cannot see a point to the film.  bad things happen...is that it?  Slow moving, I am watching in the hope that this film will eventually get better (as it can't get any worse!), but it doesn't.  When the titles started to roll, my thought was, ""is that it, surely not, it can't end like this, what was the point...to make me depressed, well it worked""!!!!  This is a Warning!  If you want a grusome, depressing film, which will leave you shocked and sad, then this is the film for you!  Be warned, it is not for the happy go lucky type!",1274227200,,598,4.192982456140351
8282800,3,B001BEK89W,"This was an ""o. K."" movie.  It is, indeed, a ""CRASH"" wannabe.  The way I rate monvies is -- if I'd watch the movie a second time, I LIKED the movie.  I don't need to watch this one again.  I think if I had seen ""PICO"" before seeing ""CRASH"", I might have given it a better review.  The acting was GOOD, its just too close to CRASH.",1224547200,2,330,3.8656716417910446
