8313695,5,B001JT3PS0,"I purchased this season (somone had already given me season one), because I hope (in time) to obtain the entire series. This is one of those programs that becomes timeless.  I have to say however, that I did enjoy the earlier seasons the best.  The longer a show runs, the harder it becomes to keep the plots fresh and interesting.  So buy and enjoy.  I think you will be pleased.",1318464000,3,380,4.385714285714286
