A beautiful  movie with great cinematography and a memorable musical soundtrack. Some good aerial battle scenes with biplanes. A showcase for Julie Andrews, but is it a musical, a spy drama, a romance, a comedy? The pairing of Rock Hudson and Julie Andrews is unconvincing and lacks passion. (Rock Hudson is only a serviceable actor.) The movie is more of a miss than a hit, but its worth a watch if you're a Julie Andrews fanshe gives a solid performance.",1474675200,,564,4.696969696969697
8523728,5,B0080QOK9S,"I must have bought the only new copy of this film as an import left and I got from one of my most reliable sellers for a steal price of $5.00 plus shipping.  I am so glad I did as it was the original 137 min. version as the film was originally released.  I am not quite certain now why the film was a flop, as it was a major work by producer/director Blake Edwards from 1970.  He co-wrote the script with William Peter Blatty, and it had very much Blake Edwards's stamp.  Henry Mancini and Johnny Mercer wrote some wonderful songs for it: the Oscar-nominated ""Whistling in the Dark,"" ""I'll Give You Three Guesses,""  ""Smile Away Each Rainy Day"" and the title tune among them.  There are a lot of military-themed old standards used in the score by Mancini like ""It's a Long Way to Tiperrary"" and such.  Perhaps that is my chief complaint is the typical jolly time the characters seemed to have while playing spy vs. spy during wartime.  The movie has pretty much the ""Mata Hari"" kind of premise.  With matters ever darkening in the news and all the politician's today looking to boost our war efforts and our military, I looked from a distance, but acquiesce to the humor.  Julie Andrews, because the film was such a costly flop, lost her box office clout, but she seemed ready for a change, if possible.  Rock Hudson was cast opposite her, and he seems adequate.  Jeremy Kemp has third billing as her seductive Nazi ""uncle.""  You can certainly see pieces of ""The Great Race"" and ""The Pink Panther"" series and later efforts like ""Victor/Victoria"" in it and I was very happy with the PAL playing Paramount disc as the newer ""Director's Cut"" on the market, more expensive and, according to reviewers who claim the edited film is too choppy to almost unintelligible without the missing footage, I would have wished to see the full film.  I seriously doubt Blake Edwards would prefer the shortened version given that the 137 min. film would have been more appreciated, In color with Dolby Digital sound.",1441843200,,1997,4.588732394366197
