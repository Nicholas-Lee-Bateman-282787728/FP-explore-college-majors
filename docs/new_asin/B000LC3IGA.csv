8161407,5,B000LC3IGA,"I really enjoy this video workout. It has options for working out at every level of fitness. The host is far, far less annoying than most workout video hosts I've seen. She also is not condescending like so many video hosts when she tells you about options for making a specific part of the workout less strenuous. She doesn't make you feel bad for not being in aerobic shape already, like so many others do. The workouts are broken into sections, so it is more manageable to fit at least some workout into a busy schedule.",1282003200,2,523,4.458333333333333
8161408,5,B000LC3IGA,you can do it in 5 min intervals....5 - 5 mins = 30 mins. I actually sweat 10 mins into it! and i never sweat b/c i am a runner! great for new moms.,1214611200,,148,3.3823529411764706
8161409,4,B000LC3IGA,I realy liked this video.  All of the exercises are very easy to do or at least work up to if you are not able at first.  It is also broken down into small segments so you have time to fit them in.  I don't quite agree with the idea you could do the first set of exercises after having a c section.,1207440000,,298,3.6984126984126986
8161410,1,B000LC3IGA,I was excited to try this DVD since I like to work out to DVD's and there are very few on the market that are for right after youe have a baby. But I thought it was amateurish and pretty boring. I would say don't waste your money on this one.,1202169600,,242,3.764705882352941
