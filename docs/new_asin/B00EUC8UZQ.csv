5944018,4,B00EUC8UZQ,"Challenging workout that will get you out of your comfortable zone.

***If you're considered about sexual content, watch the YouTube commercial provided first. The ""sexiness"" doesn't go beyond what is shown in that video. Some of the moves could easily be considered as provocative. While the commercial makes it seem like it's all through out, it's really only in the warm-up.***

I bought this DVD because I wanted help with my splits. I first heard about it on Facebook. There is a 30-day challenge for achieving your splits that I was tempted to try. I saw many others who had great success with it- getting about 1 inch deeper in one month.

The warm-up is kind of like an aerobic stretch dance with a big dose of sexy. If you're already in pretty good shape, it might not get you ""warm"" enough though. (For example, I finished P90X before doing this DVD, so I was use to something much more intense.)

The real workout begins on the Floor Exercises section. There are four sections broken down into which part of the body you'll be working in each routine: Legs, Abs, Glutes, and Quads.
The next section, Advanced Flexibility (or something like that?), mixes together flexibility and strengthening; it features standing moves (performed with a chair) like kicks, leg holds, lunges, etc.
While all of the routunes were challenging, but I wish the Abs and Glutes section were longer or had more variety. Also, I wish that there was a new title on the screen when you move from routine to routine. The camera view and song just changes, but you don't know what you're working until it begins.
The last section is Maximum Flexibility. The DVD works on three splits: straddle split and front split on both legs. The commercial mentions that it also helps with back flexibility, but there isn't a section for it; most of back strengthening/stretching is in the warm-up.
There is no cool-down. I'm guessing that when you stretch for splits, that's considered a cool-down stretch.

The workout is set to the beat/counts of each song. This can be a good and bad thing. Good, because the workout flows really well. Not good, because sometimes the dancers move too quickly from one move to the next so that they stay with the rhythm of the music. It will throw you off when you first start and don't know the routine. However, this isn't a big problem. I'd stay it happens two or three times on the entire workout.
All of the music is rock, but nothing too heavy (like screaming through the entire song). It's like listening to a playlist while you're working out. At first, it irked me, because the songs end while you're in the middle of a move. But as you memorize the routines and the songs, you notice it less.

The visuals are bright and clear. No strange or unhelpful camera views that I can recall. Cleo (the instructor) does a good job of verbally cuing each move. Her voice is pleasant and clear. She explains the correct posture you should be in before starting each routine. There are voice-overs of special instructions and modifications for some moves. My only criticism is that I wish she'd give a little bit more of a warning before moving to the next move. (Example: Saying ""After this 8-count, we'll go to lunges!"" instead of saying, ""Lunges!"").

I'm giving the DVD a 4 star, because it's an effective workout for both strengthening or stretching. I don't think it needs to be more than $30, but it is a unique workout. And while I have a few minor criticisms (mentioned above), none of them ruin the overall enjoyment or ease of following the DVD. After you watch it two or three times, you'll be ready for the quick switches.",1384387200,10,3640,4.660436137071651
5944019,5,B00EUC8UZQ,"Very intense and challenging workout.  Has sub-chapters in the video so you can select which body part you want to work on or simply ""play all"" sections and proceed.  I workout regulary and am in very good shape thanks to the military; however, her workout wore me out and I felt the burn in multiple areas.  Definitely a sexy sweaty workout.",1420502400,,342,4.573770491803279
5944020,5,B00EUC8UZQ,"Amazing DVD!!!
It totally works all your body and flexibility results you can see them really fast!!
Cleo explains every movement amazingly and she has an amazing attitude when doing the workout!!
I totally recommend it if you like to workout!!",1411603200,,244,4.975609756097561
5944021,5,B00EUC8UZQ,"I had been wanting to purchase this DVD for some time since Cleo's splits are so impressive and she was willing to share her secrets.  I finally decided to try it after seeing so many success stories I saw in her Facebook group and also because the price had recently dropped since the release of her new pole DVD.

The exercises in this DVD can be intense!  I usually weight train two to three times a week, run, and pole in between, but I have decided that I probably can't run through this whole DVD right after I had leg day at the gym.  Lol!  Especially the mat exercises for the legs...I'm usually dying by that point, but in a good way.  It's definitely a workout that tests you physically and mentally, but the results are definitely worth the challenge.  Highly recommend.",1406592000,,781,4.457746478873239
5944022,5,B00EUC8UZQ,"i have improved a lot with it, start doing it like they suggest on the fb page, cause it is not easy to follow unless you already train and exercise usually",1403827200,,156,4.064516129032258
5944023,5,B00EUC8UZQ,"Don't be fooled, this old style 90s type of feel work out is tough. Cleo definitely knows what she is doing. I just wish I could keep up and had better flexibility! But hey, that is why I purchased this.",1394755200,,203,4.1
5944024,5,B00EUC8UZQ,It's an amazing work out. It tones tightens and helps improve flexibility. if you pole or not you can use this video. I love Cleo so that helps.,1392508800,,144,4.178571428571429
5944025,4,B00EUC8UZQ,"This is an intermediate workout that will burn your abs and legs. I've only had a chance to do it once so far. Even though I was tired and sweaty, I could keep up with it. If you're looking to build strength for pole dancing, this is a great companion workout.",1390521600,,260,4.117647058823529
5944026,5,B00EUC8UZQ,"This is a great workout if you are looking to improve your flexibility. I take pole fitness classes and this is really helping as an additional at home workout, no pole required.",1389225600,5,178,4.59375
5944027,5,B00EUC8UZQ,Definitely a good workout judging by how sore I was the following day. Looking forward to see my flexibility and strength improve. Music was good and watching Cleo is so motivating to wanna push harder so I can have abs like hers.,1388275200,2,230,4.5
5944028,5,B00EUC8UZQ,"I have been poling for 6 months and wanted to take my flexibility to the next level. This DVD has great exercises to achieve just that. Consistency is the key to any flexibility program. Sometimes I wish there was better vocal direction in this DVD because I am not very coordinated! If you're like me, you might need to pause every once in a while the first few times you watch. Eventually, you should have this memorized. She gives some alternatives for beginners. The warmup is great for using before a pole session as well. I am so glad I purchased this DVD. The video is well-made with good editing. The music is upbeat and goes with the workout. Cleo's Facebook page has a 30-day challenge using this DVD. She also has some great videos if you subscribe to her newsletter. If you order from Cleo in Australia, you should receive it fairly quickly. I received mine in about 10 days.",1386115200,4,887,4.515527950310559
8609444,5,B00EUC8UZQ,"Now if your a beginner to pole dancing and you feel your not flexible enough you should buy this DVD.  You don't need a pole to do this workout, no pole required. However if your intrested in pole dancing this video can really help you out. But don't be fooled this workout can be hard at times and very challenging.  So basically you'll get a good workout and it'll make you sweat.  However not intrested in pole dancing? Go for it! It's a fun little workout, however I wasn't to found of the music but that's just me. I'll recommend it to anyone in going into pole, or wanting a ""sexy"" workout.",1529798400,,596,4.303571428571429
8609445,4,B00EUC8UZQ,"Love this video, I only wish I bought the download instead so I could watch it on my phone while at the gym.",1478476800,,108,3.739130434782609
8609446,4,B00EUC8UZQ,"This video was a random recommendation I found to help improve flexibility for dance and martial arts. I was very reluctant to buy since I'm not a budding pole dancer, or a great fan of this style of rock music and the abundance of pink and leg warmers I saw in the trailer was a little off putting. I'm glad I didn't let my pre-judgements get in the way, because this is good! The music is not too loud or distracting. The presenters are energetic, but not annoying. There's great cuing in the stretching sections, and the chapters are laid out in ways where you can really focus on your goals.
I sometimes slow down the pace of the dynamic stretches for my own safety (I'd encourage you to do the same), but its still easy to follow along or jump back in when I'm ready. It is by no means easy, and I exercise regularly, The leg section alone defeated me quite decisively. I'm glad to find this non-yoga alternative for flexibility and strength.",1467417600,,947,4.417142857142857
