7824781,3,6302320755,I saw clips of this movie on a ultimate fights dvd compilation and after seeing the fight between Liam Neeson and the other fellow I wanted to see it from start to finish. I lot of drama and dialogue not too much action. A decent film just not exactly what I expected.,1370476800,3,268,4.173076923076923
7824782,2,6302320755,"Boy, was this movie by the numbers. Liams character was a pussy most of the time. Cutty (his boxing opponent) was far too stoic considering he was thoroughly screwed by the end of the film. The ""bad"" guy acted really, really, badly. He was like some confused game show host. The end of the movie sucked really badly, too. The movie might have been salvaged if Liams character had used his loot to bribe an army of drug crazed Columbians to besiege the ""bad guys"" faux castle, force him to OD on his coke, then celebrate with all of the deprived local townspeople in a drug crazed orgy. Instead the film ended with Liams character being celebrated as some half-ass, soon to be deceased, loser ""hero"". I hated this movie.",1126656000,,719,4.538461538461538
7824783,3,6302320755,"This was a good movie starring Liam Neeson, and Val Kilmer's wife who also starred in Willo as Sorcia. Sorry, don't remember her name.
Neeson is an out of work miner in Scotland who cannot get another job due to his criminal/political record. His so-called ""friend"" introduces him to a business ""gentleman"" and they convince him to participate in an illegal bare-knuckle fight for money. Neeson believes the money is worth it when he gets an advance on his pay but his wife doesn't trust where the money came from and takes the kids to her parent's house leaving Neeson in the care of his so-called friend and the business ""gentleman"".
What you shall witness must be the bloodiest, brutal fight ever shown in a movie due to the superb makeup job and camera angles. There's nothing flashy or glorious about this fight. The sound effects and everything looks very real. Hell, I even started to feel nervous for Neeson as he's walking down the corridor to the fight due to the music. You may even feel sorry for the dirty Cutty (Neeson's opponent) once you see the damage he sustains, as they both take an enormous amount of punishment from eachother. If you'd just like to see what the fight is like, you can see it on the ""Ultimate Fight DVD"" which should be at your local Blockbuster, but I suggest you just buy this movie instead.
There was an ulterior motive for the fight taking place, not just money either so find out the true reason and if Neeson gets his wife and kids back. Give the movie a try",1074729600,6,1502,4.525735294117647
7824784,4,6302320755,"I knew Liam could act but boy can he fight (he actually did fight in his pre-acting days--that's where he got the broken nose).  This movie is about a mobster who hears about the 'Big Man', Danny Schuler (Neeson) who has a reputation for being a fierce competitor.  Danny is a redundant Scottish mine worker who accepts the money for fighting bare-knuckled for the mobster.  If you have never seen a bare-knuckle fight, it is much more brutal than one fought with gloves.  Be prepared to see lots of blood!  After the big fight, Danny finally makes some good choices--I especially like the scene when Schuler visits his opponent in the hospital and does the 'right thing'.  Liam Neeson is a born actor and this movie shows how good he was even early in his career.  Try it!",1042070400,6,773,4.557971014492754
