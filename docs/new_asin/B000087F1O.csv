7979556,4,B000087F1O,As reviewers have said the last story ends without final episode. Do not despair I have found it! If you buy Volume 2 it is about 1 hour 45 minutes in. Just the last episode. Why? Who knows? Hope this helps those lost in despair as I know I was.,1450137600,,245,3.92

7979562,2,B000087F1O,"The shows are cool (because the special effects and plot lines are ultra-cheesy and because they demonstrate a complete lack of knowledge of even the most basic concepts of astronomy), but there are only four of them, and, worst of all, the last one is the first half of a to-be-continued episode. In other words, not a very good collection.",1084147200,20,341,4.7
