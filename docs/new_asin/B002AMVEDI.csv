3889947,3,B002AMVEDI,"Elizabeth Perkins (as Celia Hodes) is quickly taking over the lead role in Weeds while Mary-Louise Parker's Nancy character is becoming trite and quite frankly, annoying. You almost wish that Nancy Botwin would get killed off so that the show could drop all of the accumulated baggage of five seasons and start over fresh.

Season Five is the ""Baby Season,"" where we watch Nancy Botwin struggle to have her new baby, support her family and keep herself alive all at the same time.  Unfortunately the show quickly devolves into a generic drama that could be found on any number of network television stations.  This season truly feels like the weed and drug trade are thrown in simply in order to keep the name of the show ""Weeds,"" and I believe it was the drug dynamic that made this show as interesting as it was in the first place. While Nancy is off playing Mrs. Mexican Mafia, Silas and Doug partner up in order to attempt a legal Medicinal Marijuana storefront while Celia (after escaping from her daughter's kidnapping plot) attempts to capture the same success that Nancy had in seasons 1 and 2 by becoming the neighborhood ""connection.""

There are two bright spots in this season and they came out of left field for me: Shane and Dr. Audra Kitson (Alanis Morissette).  Andy is still Andy - fantasizing about Nancy, hoping to replace Judah, but never quite living up to her expectations. He attempts to have a new relationship with Nancy's ""on the side"" ObGyn played remarkably well by Alanis Morissette.  While you could pretty much cut and paste Andy's character from all the other seasons of Weeds, Morissette actually plays an interesting and quirky counterpart who attempts to make Andy ""grow up"" in order to have a real relationship with her.

Shane meanwhile, becomes broken.  The poor kid has a busy season - he becomes a drug dealer, gets robbed by his teacher, befriends one of the Mexican thugs, gets a STD from his two ""girlfriends,"" and gets shot.  The last of the ""pure"" Botwins becomes truly corrupted and he relishes his new found freedom, unencumbered by morals.  Without dropping any spoilers, lets just say that Shane is the cause of the cliffhanger at the end of Season Five (and no, he's not dying because he got shot).

The eye candy for this season for the women is brought to you by Silas and Esteban - unfortunately they don't add much more depth to their characters other than just sitting on the screen looking pretty.  Doug and the Hodes play their normal comedic interludes, not bringing much to the storyline, but not really slowing it down either; pure, unadulterated filler.

All in all it was a pretty disappointing season.  If you're a die hard Weeds fan you won't be very impressed by season five.  If you're new to the Weeds show, watch seasons 1-3 instead.  Cross your fingers that season six will redeem.",1251763200,33,2849,4.7368421052631575
3889948,5,B002AMVEDI,"Season Five is totally unpredictable. Just when I think that Nancy has no more moves to make, she finds a way to wriggle out of each disastrous situation and actually come out ahead.

The character of Estaban has been a great addition to the cast. He keeps things exciting in the show by adding a much more dangerous element than merely selling drugs. Nancy finds herself between a rock and a really hard place. She is in danger of losing her home, her family, her sanity, and her life.

The most exciting season yet, must see t.v.",1250899200,15,531,4.463917525773196
3889949,3,B002AMVEDI,"I don't know why, but the last two seasons of ""Weeds"" have been very disappointing. I think the show is taking absurd to a new level with some of the ridiculous plot twists, and I also really don't like what's happened to some of my favorite characters.

Season 5 picks up right where the last season left off, with Nancy (Mary Louise Parker) in Esteban's (Demi&aacute;n Bichir) office. Esteban was ready to kill Nancy for her betrayal, but her little bombshell caused him to reconsider. The season spins off in a dozen different directions, with Nancy trying to protect her family while dealing with Esteban's crazy demands. Meanwhile, Doug (Kevin Nealon) and Silas (Hunter Parrish) go into business together, which of course leads to disastrous results. Shane (Alexander Gould) becomes even more bitter about his life, Andy (Justin Kirk) continues to pine over Nancy (at least for a while), and Celia (Elizabeth Perkins) struggles to get back on her feet.

The show makes a smart move mid-season and pulls a ""Desparate Housewives"" by fast-forwarding into the future (only by six months, not five years). This definitely picks up the pacing of the storylines, and the final few episodes of the season are among the best. There are definitely some funny scenes, but also some awful moments. (Nancy and Andy in the bathroom of the restaurant? Celia and her new ""love interest?"" EW!) I was disappointed with a lot of the characters this season. Nancy seemed to make even more stupid moves than usual, Andy was even more annoying (if that's possible), and Celia...oh my god, CELIA! She used to be my favorite character on the show, and I hated her all season!

Best part of the season? Same as last season...Bichir's performance as Esteban. Not only is he an incredibly beautiful man, but I just LOVE the way he talks!

Worst part of the season? All the other stupid crap!

Hopefully Season 6 is better, but the way this show is going, it doesn't look promising.",1250726400,10,1959,4.818452380952381

With Weeds they had no constraints and you must accept a broad range of kinds of humor from the most visceral and outrageous sexual innuendo to drugs and the most ironic and often tender considerations about the realities of human relationships.

I guess I want to see how Nancy Botwin's tale ends, but I would have been so much more satisfied if this show had wrapped up after a two or three-year run. Season 5 still has some funny moments, mostly propelled by the dry, wry Mexicans Nancy is forced to deal with, but the initial charm of the show is well and truly lost. Maybe Weeds is a little bit like what I'm told using drugs is like: it's very easy to get hooked, but after years of use you're embarrassed and ashamed and wished you were clean.

The old devices are wearing thin: Silas does something stupid, Shane broods, Nancy sleeps with somebody to get everyone out of a jam. This show used to be one on TVs best and it used to be one of TVs funniest--it has morphed into a forgettable soap.",1350086400,2,835,4.154320987654321

It would load the first episode, and sometimes you could fast forward through this episode to get to subsequent episodes, but it would play about 5 seconds of them (blurred and skipping) before it froze and stopped.  I tried playing this disk on 3 different DVD players, and all were varying shades of intolerable.  So, I returned the disks, got a replacement and it was the same, the second disk was useless.

i think the let down here is that the show is no longer a ""comic"" show. things have gotten deeper, more relationships become complex and the characters are all finally comfortable and stationary with some norm in their life. the show dips into drama, which i think is a breath of fresh air. i'm glad that weeds isn't dumbed down for only stoners up late night to watch but for people who enjoy their shows to go a little slower, but then bam! a bunch of crazy s goes down at once.

The show has lost some of it's better characters  (Conrad and his family, oh, how I'd love to see another good sex scene with him and Nancy) in favor of disposable ppeople that match the silly plot lines.  But the show is still one of the better things on television, along with Breaking Bad, Mad Men, Californication and The Tudor's (which Showtime has ended.)  The writing is good, but it's core cast is outstanding, perhaps that is what's keeping it going at this point.

3890147,4,B002AMVEDI,"Weeds is one of the best written shows on television, and Season 5 held up its own for the most part.  Season 5, pretty much a continuation of Season 4's setting and storyline, slowed down in terms of action, but spent a good deal more time exploring the depth of characters, especially Shane Botwin (Nancy's youngest).

If Seasons 1 through 4 are grade A, Season 5 is a B+.

Some of the criticism of this season has been a bit harsh in my opinion, as I think these critics were expecting a lot of the same high-intensity moments they were accustomed to, but with deeper character development, and slowing down the story, those kinds of moments were fewer and further between.  (I hear this is going to be ""corrected"" in Season 6.)

One criticism that I think is especially unfair is the disappointment that some characters are left dangling doing silly things.  The reality is that everyone was participating in interrelated story threads, and everything tied together pretty well.

What gives this season a B+ instead of a B is that the ending of the last episode was the best ever for Weeds.  Total shocker.  Killer (Kill-her).

Also, what's not to like about the cutest baby seen on television, Stevie Ray Botwin.  Aww[...]  :)  (they skip ahead six months so Nancy can have Esteban's baby -- can't have too much action when the lead character is preggers, so this was easily forgiven)",1283731200,,1389,4.690082644628099

It actually bothered me that its simplicity kept me wanting more. But half way through Season 3, I realized this series was spiraling into just another hypnotic search for humor and the show really needed to end. Weeds, perferably would have ended on a good accord and not accede into a slow death. Season 5 is that slow death. As long as viewers habitually watch, whether good or bad, writers will dig for material, sadly it's not the characters but the script that's terminal. This series is far removed from it's original content. Lay this down in the graveyard of over-run shows starting with Season 4 and death with 5. Don't expect resurrection on 6.

3890173,4,B002AMVEDI,"Showtime's hit series ""Weeds"" sure has changed since its inception in 2005. Created by Jenji Kohan, the series originally followed a widowed mother, Nancy (Mary Louise Parker), whom in an effort to support herself and her children, is thrust into the drug-selling business. Making money off of selling pot was easy at first, but it proved to be a dangerous game, with Nancy inadvertantly burning all of her bridges and connections to the past and fleeing to the border of Mexico, always with somebody on her tail.

Season Five of the show strays even farther from its roots, but unlike the underwhelming fourth season, this one manages to keep in the tradition of being as addictive as an actual drug, with each episode leaving you laughing and on the edge of your seat, waiting to see what they come up with next. Everyone's favorite pot-peddling soccer mom is now pregnant, and takes her relationship with a powerful and dangerous Mexican politician to the next level. Meanwhile, her children are put in danger on more than one occasion while Uncle Andy (the always entertaining and reliable Justin Kirk) falls in love with a doctor, played by Alanis Morissette, who challenges him to finally grow up. Celia (Elizabeth Perkins) and Doug (Kevin Nealon) pop up in heavy doses to deliver the seasons biggest laughs, however, and prove that ""Weeds"" is at its finest when it focuses on humor over melodrama.

Many will malign this season for the same reason they condemned Season Four, but alas, if you can get past the fact that this isn't the same show it was when it first aired, you're likely in for a good show. Sure, Nancy's not selling pot, but in essence, she is still ""in the weeds"" and Season Five is as entertaining and engaging as the show has ever been. Yes, it has a tendency to feel like a Spanish soap opera at times, but once you are done with the season's thirteen episodes, you'll be dying to see where Season Six goes. ""Weeds"" sure has changed a lot, but with an open mind and a sense of humor, it's still worth the -- ahem -- green.",1272499200,3,2050,4.6291208791208796

In summary i don't expect a whole lot of deep thinking when i watch this show but i do expect to be entertained and humored.  A lot.

For a series about marijuana, they don't have much of it.

I was excited to see how S5 would unravel the mess from the S4 ending. Well I just finished watching and it looks like the writers ran out of ideas. The plot is contrived and many of the jokes felt forced and unfunny. Worst of all the characters are all despicable now with the exception of Nancy's eldest son. The writers quit trying to write thoughtful scripts and started relying on shock value. This is evidenced by the inclusion of a disturbing and gratuitous rape scene. A scene that two of the show's writers and Kevin Nealon joke about during one of the episode commentaries. I'm not sure why I'm even giving this thing 2 stars but it does have that trainwreck quality to it. You just can't quite quit but you know you should.,1264550400,2,903,4.317647058823529

However, when they moved to a town on the Mexican border in Season 4, I hoped that the show would be more creative... instead it got worse. And unfortunately, Season 5 is worse.

I own Seasons 1, 2, and 4 on Blu-Ray (3 on DVD)- so it's easy to see that I went and rushed to buy Season 5 quickly, and watched the whole thing in two days. Granted, I enjoyed some bits, but was bored for tears for the most part. There were hardly any LOL moments, hell, even Season 4 had more LOL moments. The whole idea of Nancy being involved in the Mexican mafia was ridiculous and over-the-top.

3890264,3,B002AMVEDI,"Yes, there are some bright spots here, with the younger cast members being more consistently good in their roles than some of the adults. And Elizabeth Perkins is spot-on hilarious and destructive in every scene she has.  Alanis Morrissette, who did well on Nip/Tuck, does even better here as Andy's new love.

But things have really fallen off since the Agrestic/little boxes days.  Nancy makes more dumb choices now, not the least of which was marrying the pushy, macho man Esteban Reyes and bearing him a son.  In the meantime, his henchmen commit murder, Shane is injured and starts drinking, and Nancy still doesn't seem to understand it when Andy tells her how badly she has messed things up for everyone in her life.  Perhaps this is intended to come off as a warning, but it doesn't play that way.

The biggest problemm is that the last ep. in this season doesn't seem like much of a season-ender.  I really thought there would have been a few more eps to wrap things up a bit better.",1264464000,,992,4.6022727272727275
3890265,2,B002AMVEDI,"I am very disappointed with Weeds season 5.  The first two-three seasons were LOL, hilarious, riotous non-stop laughing.  But the latest season 5 is just an utter disappointment, lackluster, no laughs, and needs to retire now.  I thought Cecilia's character got totally lost in this season, the writers did not do a very good job with incorporating her usual raw humor that she was known for in the first couple of seasons.  Andy's character included, just not enough laughs and good writing.

I thought this season's whole premise of Nancy getting involved with the Mexican mafia, then getting pregnant by the mayor was just sheer ridiculousness and the way she treats her children, or lack there of, she's never around to raise her boys (in the first two seasons, the relationship between her and her boys was great!) and her character never really develops, it's staganant.

I hope Showtime either decides to retire this show, or get a new writer who can put some UMPH into the script and make it funny and hilarious again--the way it used to be!",1264464000,2,1049,4.8
3890266,4,B002AMVEDI,"I just was not a huge fan of how all of the story lines went this year. Fans of the series have apparently embraced this season as one of the best, so I will stick with the BD review.

The picture clarity is outstanding throughout, with plenty of testings for the darks, color variances and flesh tones. There was only one scene in one episode where I caught any falter (the night scene where Nancy thinks about running away with dufus, sitting on the bench in her recently discovered dead garden). The outdoor dance scene in the public square demonstrated a nice rainbow of color with no issues. The sound however was disappointing. A let down only because it is 7.1 DTS, but I counted five times in the whole season that it actually got used (the birds while Celia is in the rebel camp, the boys on their nature hike, and a few indistinct scenes), so it almost feels like a waste - always a huge fan of DTS though - especially 7 channels. The supplements are almost all forgettable, disc 1 can play the episodes only and you would not miss a thing, including:

* History of Weed, 1:58 minutes (lodef). Corny animation boards covering the known history of the plant, boring.
* Yes We Cannabis, 1:30 minutes (lodef). A Kevin Nealon campaign speech for Nancy Botwin?? Whatever.
* Little Titles, 3:18 minutes (hidef). Reviews the intro artwork for each season 5 episode, brief narration for each that did not describe much.

* Backstage with Kevin Nealon, 11:07 minutes (lodef). Handheld nightmare of motion sickness as he walks from stage to stage showing the catering, trailers and behind the scenes stuff...not worth it.
* Relationships of Weeds, 12:15 minutes (hidef). The actors/creator get interviewed on their takes of where the dysfunctional relationships on Weeds are going and why. Not as insightful as I had hoped as they kept it where if you had not seen the season yet nothing shocking would be revealed.
* Bloopers, 11:04 (hidef). Drags quite a bot, but you will get a couple laughs out of it (I think the scene with the elderly loan officer was the most sincere) the rest were uneventful.
* University of Andy, 13 chapters totaling 33:58 minutes (lodef). These are the episodes you can access via the website. He does a classroom instruction of how to succeed at various ""important"" things in life (manscaping, surviving a wild animal attack, internet dating, etc.). Became real boring real fast - but I suppose fans of his might enjoy this.

I love the series, but the overall BD product could not warrant a content/sound/picture 5-star rating (2/3 of supps in lodef, DTS unused, no BD Live and there is tons of material online for this show). Region A coded spread over two discs (7 episodes on disc 1 with several supps, 6 episodes on disc 2 with the rest). Enjoy.",1263772800,2,2780,4.678936605316974
3890267,1,B002AMVEDI,"Briefly, I thought the show took a very weird turn. They must have run out of ideas to make such radical changes.  I found the stories unpleasant, some characters despicable, and felt all the regular cast became obnoxious and unlikeable - especially Nancy.  After ""being in love"" with Mary Louise for a few years I felt totally the opposite.  There was no way she should have even been nominated for an Emmy, let alone win it.  And she had the nerveto ask on Twitter, ""Who Thought I Should Have Won the Emmy Last Night?""  I bought two copies of the first four seasons.  This is the first season that I will not even buy one.  It's unfortunate that Jenji and the writers had to ruin a Great Show.",1262995200,10,695,4.3828125
3890268,3,B002AMVEDI,"This season struggled to find its footing.  Storylines that began were quickly stopped, characters changed personality, almost seemingly randomly, and then there was a giant time shift for no real reason.  I had a real hard time liking Nancy this season.  There's a moment in Season 5 where Andy very genuinely tells Nancy that she's at fault for everything that's happened to her, and asks how she could not know this.  I loved that moment as it defined my growing problem with the show.  While weeds started as a show with a mother who turned to selling drugs as a last resort to saving her family from financial ruin, she's morphed into more of a thrill seeker.  She prefers to be in danger, rather than run from it.  This season especially, she's had chances to escape from this situation, and live a normal life, but she doesn't, and now knowingly choose the wrong path.  Sure, television is based on characters in bad situations, but previously Nancy's problems always stemmed from an outside source.  Now she is the person making the bad decisions.  It makes her character, and the show, less interesting.

The show did have some great and very funny moments, but I feel so many characters are left without a real story or purpose, which is why so many times stories just end so quickly, as they tried something that just didn't work, so they gave up. Hopefully the season finale's promise of a stronger story for the supporting players and Nancy will lend itself to a much better season 6.  Overall, an entertaining season, but with a large amount of flaws.",1262044800,8,1565,4.6923076923076925
3890289,4,B002AMVEDI,"This was a great series when it started.  Interesting plot and characters that you wouldn't normally see on TV.  Then it went downhill BIG TIME.  Happy to say this season has somewhat redeemed things and is a big improvement on the last.  Funny but also interesting with plots and characters not totally out of the question.  Definitely something you won't see on broadcast television.  Fans of Showtime or HBO comedies will like this.  If you've liked the show in the past, give this season a shot.  Good stuff.",1260144000,5,512,4.738636363636363
3890290,3,B002AMVEDI,"When ""Weeds"" moved from California suburbia to a Mexican border town in season 4, I was hoping that it would give the show the creative shot in the arm it needed. For a while, it seemed to work, and season 4 ended on an intense and serious note, with Nancy dealing with the ramifications of ratting out the drug tunnel that was also shipping girls into slavery.

Season 5, sadly, was hopelessly uneven. The actors on the show are excellent (Especially Mary Louise Parker and Justin Kirk), but the writers have them all wandering around aimlessly, going from one hapless mess to another. The season started with Nancy in peril as her drug kingpin/mayor boyfriend tried to decide whether or not to kill her for her betrayal. Instead, upon verifying that Nancy is indeed pregnant with his son, he marries her and pledges love and devotion. Andy decides he's in love with Nancy and wants to be the father figure her children desperately need, but after Nancy jilts him he ends up in love with Nancy's gynecologist. Elizabeth Perkins is a wonderful actress, but her Celia character, as well as the handful of other Agrestic refugees, have little reason to be on the show anymore. The only character who develops in an interesting direction is Shane. His character has always been strange and offbeat, but it appears that finally,after years of living in chaos and moral deprivity thanks to his Mom, he's now become completely psychotic. The cliffhanger he provides by casually murdering Nancy's archnemesis is one of the best things in the season.

The season does get a little help from its co-stars. Jennifer Jason Leigh was a terrific breath of fresh air as Nancy's sister. I wish they had extended her storyline and given her more to do. And Alanis Morisette gave a surprisingly charming performance as Nancy's doctor and Andy's love interest.

Here's hoping that next season features better storylines and character development.",1259625600,6,1928,4.9079754601226995

The seasons in Agrestic were great, but Ren Mar or wherever they move in the middle of the season are soooo much better. I love how Nancy get deal with things and acts less mature than her 14 year old son. Also this season gave Justin Kirk (Andy) a real acting job, he was hysterical and serious at the same time (I LOVE IT WHEN HE GROWS HIS BEARD). I also liked the guy who plays Estaban Reyes, he can't decide who to listen to, his wife or his boss. Kate de Castillo gives a performance that is great, you love her and you hate her at the same. Elizabeth Perkin's acting ability in the couple of seasons have been criminally overlooked, but hopefully this year she'll be recognized again at the awards, she's hysterical. Constant paranoia, trying to out-Nancy Nancy, how could she be so cruelly overlooked. Alexander Gould (Shane) gives another award worthy performance, from losing his virginity last season, to STDs, gunshot wounds, and alcoholism this season, that's a lot to deal with! This is season probably isn't the best season, but it had the best finale of all the seasons (well its tied with season 2, but that left too many questions).

If you like this series at all this is a must see.  I can't wait for the next season because this season was wrapped up to hook you.,1252540800,2,264,3.8518518518518516
3890297,5,B002AMVEDI,Looking forward to seeing Nancy spin out of this one.  The plots twist and turns always suspense filled.  Where ever the road leads as long as continues to provide the roller coaster ride it has in the past it should be a blast.,1252368000,,228,4.27906976744186
3890298,5,B002AMVEDI,"Showtime's series Weeds is one of the best shows on television. Each season is consistently strong- with engaging, inventive stories, complex charecters and wonderful dark comedy. Mary-Louise Parker is absolutely phenomenal as Nancy Botwin, one of the most complex and uncompromising charecters to ever appear on television. Parker is backed by an always reliable supporting cast who bring humor and heart to the at times, very dark proceedings. Weeds' Fifth Season is the slowest one but that does not mean it's bad. It is the most character driven season, we get to see the true colors of these charecters and what they really want, and at times, its not pretty. Nancy continues her downward spiral and drags her youngest son Shane down with her. Silas becomes the emotional center of this extremely dysfunctional family, and at 18 has become the real father figure. Andy strives to get out of Nancy's grasp and start his own life while Celia tries her hardest to be a different person and at times actually tries to BE Nancy. This season is all about coming to terms with the inevitable and face the consequences. There is plenty here to reward long time fans of the show and viewers interested in the psychological make-up of these crazy charecters. The season finale promises to set up more of the themes established in this season. I cant wait to see what happens next. Weeds is still my personal favorite show on TV, layered, funny, deep and always surprising.
