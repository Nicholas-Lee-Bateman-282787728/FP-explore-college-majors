5391357,5,B00A703VZY,"Excellent story - good casting - liked the cooking!  Will need to learn to make the spicy rice cookies mentioned towards the end of the show.

STORY:  Family bakery that will go under UNLESS the family pulls together.  A Japanese food reporter finds this neighborhood bakery, that while the baked goods are exceptional, there is a chance that the bakery will be forced to close due to redevelopment of the neighborhood (thugs lurking around the shop).

CASTING: While I liked like the cooking aspects of the movie along with the developing relationship between the three brothers; it was the Japanese reporter (actor) that was just exceptional to me!  Will have to look for more stuff that he is in.  Kim Jeong-Hoon was gorgeous as normal.  He has that heart-breaking face when he is sad.  Loved the local neighborhood Ajumma!",1392076800,,826,4.884892086330935
5391358,1,B00A703VZY,"I'm not going to sit through a whole movie of this.

Subtitles are incredibly poorly translated, obviously by someone who is not fluent in English.  Words are stuck about in an odd order, when there's any continuity at all.  There's no way to hop seamlessly into the world of the movie and take up a happy residence when the subtitles are busy being jarring, making no sense, and yanking you out of the movie to wonder-- ""Umm ... what?  What did that mean?  What was he supposed to be saying?""

The movie may or may not be wonderful in its original language, but for those of us on the other side of the language barrier, the subtitles are not ready for the English-speaking market.",1385942400,3,682,4.459677419354839

5391363,4,B00A703VZY,"Filmed by Japanese director, Masaharu Take, `Seoul Bakery' provides a different perspective (when juxtaposed against films like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Le-Grand-Chef-2-Kimchi-Battle/dp/B00C44IB4M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Le Grand Chef 2: Kimchi Battle</a>) on the challenges of modernity to self, family and community in Korea and the need we all have to find something that brings us ""home"", grounds us.

The film opens with Japanese freelance reporter, Jun (Takumi Sato,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Elevator-Trap/dp/B00724XWD4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Elevator Trap</a>), heading to Seoul, Korea in search of food that satisfies all of the senses.  Upon his arrival, he accidently stumbles across Morandang, a traditional Korean sweet shop.  Morandang turns out to be exactly what Jun was looking for, but he arrived too late.  A neighborhood development project with ties to the mob and a modern competitor threaten its very existence.  With the family of the proprietor separated, each going his own way, the continuing existence of the sweet shop and the family look doubtful.  Can both be saved?  Jun intends to make that happen.

Although the storyline is somewhat formulaic, `Seoul Bakery' is a satisfying film overall.

The dialogue is in Korean and Japanese with English subtitles.  Unfortunately, the subtitles are subpar and may be a deterrent for some viewers.",1373760000,4,1475,6.479591836734694
5391364,5,B00A703VZY,"This is a nice story about a Japanese free-lance writer - Jin Isaka played by Takomi Saito - whose family ran and lost their confectionery shop after which the family members went their own ways.  Jin writes about eateries and food.  He goes to Seoul, South Korea where he discovers a small out of the way confectionery shop run by Sang Woo who has taken over the business after the death of his father.  He has two brothers, Sang Hyuk who dreams of being a rock star but who has a secret and Sang Jin who wants to go ""Big"" with the confectionery business and goes head to head with Sang Woo.  The story is about the struggle for survival not only for the business but for the family.
  The only question I have is why if the story is about a Japanese writer who goes to Seoul, South Korea to look for a story and is carrying a Japaness-Korean language handbook and where they are having problerms understanding each other, are they tossing in English phrases every once in a while?  Why would Jun say something in English to a Korean bus driver?  One could argue - I suppose - that English is the only common language but if that is the case why are they not using totally?
  Once last somewhat cute note is that the subtitles seem to be ih pigeon English.",1361664000,,1257,4.31063829787234

5391391,3,B00A703VZY,"Always enjoy a good family movie!  English translation leaves a bit to be desired, but understandable..Characters each had his/her own valuable stand in the film.",1413849600,,162,5.48
5391392,4,B00A703VZY,"The subtitles for this movie were so bad that not too far into the film, it got to the point where when the exceedingly rare grammatically correct and intelligible subtitle showed up, I found _that_ one hard to understand. Fortunately, the subtitles were pretty consistently bad throughout and one's brain is pretty good at adapting. :)

Anyway, other than the subtitles, this was a really great film.

The story follows a Japanese photo-journalist, three brothers who inherited their parents' confectionary, a charming and motherly neighbor, and some local thugs who are trying to put the confectionary out of business (presumably so something else can be built in its place...maybe that's clearer if you understand the Korean dialogue).

One of the brothers has continued running the place, while the two others have gone their own way. But one, a struggling musician (sorry, is that redundant?) finds himself back in the store when the thugs rough up the first brother.

In some ways, the story is the classic ""underdog trying to beat the deadline"", used in so many B movies. But it's done sensibly for a change, and that turns out just to be the scaffolding on which an entirely different message is built. In another sense, the movie is really about tradition, the importance of family values (real family values, not the fake ones touted politically in the US), and how the march of progress covers up valuable history and experiences.

Fact is, all around the world we have seen the decline of the mom-and-pop store, lost to the ever-growing and consuming industry of big-business itself. ""Caf Seoul"" gives us a taste of why we should regret this, and some hope that if it can't be stopped altogether (and perhaps it should not be), we should and can at least preserve the old ways.",1410393600,,1789,4.891089108910891
5391393,1,B00A703VZY,"If Korea can make such great dramas, why can't they make movies?",1407888000,,64,4.416666666666667
5391394,5,B00A703VZY,"Moving from one's native land for a visit to a foreign country is often the basis for a movie. Usually the focus is either on the comedy resulting from an inadequate command of the host language or on the harshness of a brute drama that crushes the visitor. In CAF SEOUL, the focus is on neither; the film centers the audience on the slice of life adventures of Jun (Takumi Saito), a Japanese photographer sent to Korea to gather photos for a narrative to be sent to his editor in Tokyo. Jun speaks very little Korean so he relies on a tourist phrase book to get by. The opening scenes show him simply wandering about Seoul, looking for some interesting shots. By sheer happenstance, he wanders into a Korean bakery, and it is here that the drama begins.

By mid-plot, the viewer learns the essentials of the bakery's role in the film. It is managed by one brother whose two other brothers have long since left, leaving the eldest to carry on alone. This solitary effort by this brother opens the door to the driving theme--that a family is not a family unless all members pitch in to carry on the family tradition. The youngest brother has become a guitarist in a rock band while the middle one has chosen to become a baker for a rival bakery. Complicating matters is a band of local thugs who want to tear down the bakery to provide room for a forthcoming office building. Into this volatile mess steps an innocent Jun.

The thugs soon cripple the eldest brother, leaving Jun to debate to what extent or how he should get involved. It is his interaction with the family that provides a surprisingly gripping account of viewer interest. CAF SEOUL is not a love movie; neither is it a comedy nor an action film. It is perilously close to a straight documentary. The shifting camera angles of a hand-held cam suggest a deliberate effort by the director to simulate a pseudo-documentary style often favored by college age directors.

Related to the theme of filial obligation lies a subtext that flows smoothly from how a family ought to stick together when that family is in the bakery business. When pressed for the philosophy of life of a baker, that baker might reply with Eating is the Path to Life. In CAF SEOUL, the long dead patriarch of this bakery had instilled in his sons the wisdom of this saying. Two of the sons have forgotten what it means to be a baker. The eldest son by himself cannot re-inculcate such wisdom into his erring brothers. It falls to Jun, not to be the active participant in their spiritual regeneration, but rather to be the catalyst whose probing comments in a very faulty Korean allows the trio to first meet, then speak, then unite in a common bond of filial self-imposed obligation. In this universe of bakery, the biggest tragedy is the failure of a family to remember just what it was that made them a family in the first place. Not even the evil machinations of the thugs or of their Big Boss are allowed to intrude to create an insurmountable obstacle. By film's end, the wisdom of Jun has combined with that of the brothers to re-center the moral core of a very small shop somewhere in downtown Seoul. The audience is uplifted to realize that a very fine movie needs no other props than simple human conversation to maintain a driving interest. Highly recommended.",1406246400,,3305,4.579391891891892
