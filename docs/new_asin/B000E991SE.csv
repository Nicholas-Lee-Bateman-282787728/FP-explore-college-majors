2510639,4,B000E991SE,"This four disc set continues the 1840 storyline, with Barnabas and Julia trying to stop the 1970 destruction of Collinwood by the ghost of Gerard Stiles. I really can't say much without spoiling those not yet to this point in the series, but there's a bit of a change of fortune at Collinwood and that man will stop at nothing to keep that position - and the only way to hold onto it all is to see Quentin tried and convicted of witchcraft. There's dirty dealings, spooks and things that go bump in the night, along with a surprise return from the dead.

This was a lot of fun and definitely one of my favorite story lines, although the courtroom drama dragged on just a bit too long, with plenty of overacting at that. Fans of Lara Parker will get to see plenty of her in this set of episodes, and in a more sympathetic portrayal at that. Could it be she's going to become one of the good guys? Gasp!

2510640,5,B000E991SE,"Just as entertaining as the 23 collections leading up to this one.  However, I keep hoping that the first episodes of ""Dark Shadows"" will eventually show up in a DVD collection as well.  The show had aired for over 6 months before ""Jonathan Frid"" was hired as Barnabas Collins.  Jonathan Fried's character, Barnabas, made the show rating hit the ceiling.  The show was popular from that point on, and that's probably why first DVD collection starts when Jonathan Frid is among the cast.  Apparently the show was barely hanging on before Jonathan Fried but, as a devoted Dark Shadows's fan, I would love to see the first months of the show made it to the collection.",1323475200,,665,4.698275862068965

2510642,5,B000E991SE,"Love this show, and I love that it's offered here at such a great price. I watched this show at my grandmothers house as a kid in reruns, and I realize now how much of it I missed seeing, and how much I missed the show in general.",1319673600,,230,3.8125
2510643,5,B000E991SE,"DARK SHADOWS, ABC's Gothic (supernatural) daytime drama, debuted in 1966 and ended in 1971.  It started rather unspectacularly, with the typical soap opera plots common to that genre.  The ratings were tanking when Mr. Curtis decided to go for broke and introduce a supernatural element, with Laura, the Phoenix and the ghost of Josette Collins.  The show really hit the big time with the introduction of Barnabas Collins, a tortured soul, cursed with immortality by Angelique, a jealous witch from Martinique!

The show explored many plot lines (many taken from literary classics) and delved into Parallel Time, time travel and other mysteries.

Viewers couldn't wait to tune in and see what happened.  Cliffhangers on Friday were common and a lot of people (me included) either kept notes or taped the show.  We adored the wonderful cast..and we still do..45 years later.  Every year a marvelous DARK SHADOWS FESTIVAL is held and this year it will be at the Brooklyn Bridge Marriott Hotel - August 19 thru 21.  Many stars of the show will be on hand to sign autographs (Mr. Frid is scheduled to be there), answer questions, and there will be plenty of episodes to enjoy, plus a dealer's memorabilia room, a silent auction and a banquet dinner on the final night.  Not to be missed!

I purchased this particular edition of the DARK SHADOWS collection because I adore DONNA WANDREY, who portrayed ROXANNE DREW.  Alas, she did not appear in many episodes, but was a luminous presence in the ones where she did appear.

Once you've experienced the magic and mystery of DARK SHADOWS, there is no going back!  We are beholding to MPI for having the perspicacity to release the entire series to fans who can't get enough of this never to be forgotten series!  DARK SHADOWS LIVES!",1304121600,7,1774,4.847176079734219

Can't fault them for giving us *something* of reasonable quality due to the series' age.

Any D.S. fan looking to complete his collection would be happy with this DVD package.",1400716800,,381,4.6716417910447765

2510654,5,B000E991SE,"I am truly a lover of Dark Shadows and am hoping to fulfill a dream come true to meet Quentin, Angelique ,Maggie , Willie, Carolyn, Gerard, and Eve in June in Tarrytown. I grew up watching them so intensely as a child and I really loved Barnabas even though I have and always did have deep religious beliefs, I never thought of any of the characters as evil, it was just a lot of fun to watch and a way to escape my own pain(the loss of a brother)in an accident at an early age!! Somehow watching the show, made death not that scary or final since there was always some ghost somewhere hanging around in most of the story lines. So I must say This collection is very good, I personally was not to crazy about the Leviathan story. Yet I would purchase this DVD if anyone is on the fence about it, it is definitely worth watching!!!",1396483200,,830,4.226415094339623

2510656,5,B000E991SE,"I watched Dark Shadows as a kid and was intrigued with the series.  There were many things on the show I didn't understand, but I continued to watch. One day my child-care provider introduced the series to me and I was hooked ever since. Never, had I known or seen the ending, so this is my chance to see it all over again with a more understanding of the series. Because of these DVDs, I was able to attend my first Dark Shadow Festival in Brooklyn, NY, the year before Jonathan Frid past.  I got to meet Lara Parker, David Selby, Jerry Lacy, Kathryn Leigh Scott, Roger Davis, and many others because of these DVD's. Thanks Amazon.",1388793600,2,632,4.3931623931623935

2510659,4,B000E991SE,"I gave it four stars despite enduring the tired out treachery that no one can figure out,
made more annoying with the Gerard (whatever) character , with his annoying smirk (super close up yet)
so easily seducing every woman in sight; The over loud voices in the middle of whispering voices (stage actors?);
The lack of actually showing children alluded to, and when they do, it's David in some annoying part but
worse, they replaced the little girl with a girl as big as the adults.
Could David (Henesy) have complained about Amy Jenning's (Denise Nickerson) character being too young for him
and got the older Halley Stokes (Kathy Cody) character, who begrudingly played the ""child"" opposite him?
Unless she was someone's relative or girl friend, because she is now Carrie Stokes in some forced, inserted romantic storyline complete with older actor. Cute sure, but, did she shove out the child part, along with the David part, (or...he may just have outgrown the part himself.)
But, that new part fits in, because it seems to be someone's idea to force romance (even with Gerard?)
into the plot all over the place, and our governess is not exactly there to take care of children.

This endured, because the storyline is still here, with the new mysteries, and the treachery here is understandably difficult to figure out with some surprising outcomes or a ""skeleton in the closet"", with the spooky overall quality, ghost? and seances, etc;
with the usually good atmospheric sets (something down that hallway...)
And the evil, if only patiently waiting for it to be overcome and we really need it with the Gerard, ah...thing;
satisfied sometimes with interesting vying and curious pairing of forces, including Barnabas,
himself evils victim.

These are still the same reasons I've looked at this old series to begin with; Stage actors?...are good actors;
And the writing, at times, is good and the in depth that is allowed by the long drawn out soap opera... almost...like being there;
And...the very cute Kate Jackson, Lara Parker and Nancy Barrett are easy on the eyes.",1375833600,,2072,4.9511494252873565
2510660,2,B000E991SE,"I loved this show, especially the first 10 collections, but the momentum that compelled me to watch has slowed to a creep.

Many people ask: Why was Dark Shadows canceled? Look no further than Collection 24 where due to some lapse in sanity, the two least-experienced castmembers, child actors ""David"" & ""Hallie"" are given the bulk of air-time. They are awful! They either shout all their lines or try to look scared. Were they related to the producers?
Then there is Gerard, that smirking, sinister spirit who never says anything. Very boring! (The same thing was tried with Quentin originally, but it became so dull, they finally allowed him to talk.) Gerard has a female partner Daphne, the lovely Kate Jackson, who also says nothing until the very end of this collection. Neither of these apparitions add much of anything.

UPDATE: At the end of the final episode of Collection 24, writer Sam Hall is interviewed. He mentions that towards the end of the show, the network interfered with the production & stories in the show, & drove the show's creator & writers crazy. That explains the focus on child actors, & the de-fanging of Barnabas.

Perhaps there was a financial crisis behind the scenes. The bulk of good actors are either missing in action, or appear rarely at this stage. Quentin disappears for episodes at a time, then Barnabas disappears. Maybe they could only afford 4 or 5 actors at once. After the greatness of the first years ('67 - 69), I'm surprised this show wasn't canceled after the ""Leviathans"" storyline. ""Parallel Time"" & ""Gerard's Folly"" will cure insomnia in anyone. I realize dedicated fans of DS love every single episode, outtake, blooper, re-make or tangential connection to the show, but there is a difference in writing quality, & in the quantity of good actors, between the introduction of Barnabas in 1967 and the last gasps of the series in late 1970 - early '71.

I will go back to the early days with Barnabas as a tortured sinister vampire, Willie Loomis, Victoria Winters, the old Dame Collins, her haughty brother Roger Collins, Angelique, her warlock friend, Maggie's father, & boyfriend, etc...",1367712000,3,2142,4.892561983471074
