25958,4,0767805712,"Gattaca is as much a film about futurist hopes becoming real to the detriment humanity as it is about philosophical identity. Well paced and acted, it works as criticism of man's constant battle with the mind-body problem in that it examines how we can judge ourselves based on the contents of our minds, our hopes, and our dreams whilst also judging all others based on their mere physicality, or, in this case, their genetic makeup. Genetic perfection is here seen as just another thing for man's unyielding will to overcome, but not withholding affection in spite of others' lack of perfection is the real point here, and much more difficult. Gattaca is romantic and sentimental, with a weighty plot that owes as much to Byron, Coleridge, and the Shelleys as it does its cinematography owes early modernist and film-noir film makers. It is austere at times, but definitely worth watching.",1520899200,,891,4.946666666666666

25980,4,0767805712,"Review of Gattaca
Hot Toasty Rag, December 10, 2017

Everyone I knew loved the science fiction film Gattaca, so by the time I watched it, it had quite a bit of hype to live up to. Surprisingly, it lived up to every bit of it, and I really enjoyed the movie! Coming from someone who generally hates futuristic movies, my recommendation should be duly noted.

Imagine going to the doctors office with your spouse, after deciding you want to have a child, and hand-selecting genes from your marital pool. Your husbands blue eyes, your cheekbones, your eyesight, your husbands height, etc. In Gattacas world, thats what parents-to-be can do! I thought that concept was extremely alluring, and when I learned the main plot was about a love childsomeone who was conceived the old-fashioned waywho tries to fit in among a world of perfect beings, including his hand-picked brother, I was sold.

Ethan Hawke takes the leading role as the imperfect man, and he gives the performance of his career. While hes been typecast now in deadbeat-Dad roles, Gattaca reminds audiences how he started his career, as a handsome, likable leading man. His inner conflict is palpable through the screen, and in the many scenes that threaten exposure of his true identity, audiences are nearly tortured with tension.

Uma Thurman plays Ethans love interest, and they fell in love offscreen during the filming. If you tell yourself to forget that their marriage didn't last, its pretty cute to see them onscreen together. Taking third billing is Jude Law, very well-cast as a genetically perfect man. While his part of the story is pretty sad, he gives a very powerful and memorable performance. If youve never seen him in a movie or don't usually like him, this is a great one to watch.

Fans of this genre will almost undoubtedly love this movie, and as proven by my glowing review, even people who prefer more realistic settings will probably still love it. Yes, it takes place in the future, but the performances bring an incredible amount of realism and emotional tension to the film.",1512864000,,2063,4.849431818181818

25982,5,0767805712,"Gattaca (1997) is a sci-fi film that is thought-provoking, as it has you questioning your place in the world. What I love about this film is that it doesn't try to do too much; most sci-fi films indulge in special effects or exotic characters, with some exceptions (2001: A Space Odyssey comes to mind as an exception). This film, however, has some interesting settings and neat lighting in many scenes that gives the film a 'tint'.  In this film, the characters are very organic and have an abundance of emotion, so I didn't care about exotic locations or special effects, though they're sprinkled in. The plot is easy to follow, and that's what drew me in. The storyline or subject matter sort of reminds me of Blade Runner, and the sets are futuristic, but not dystopian, like Blade Runner.  Ethan Hawke, Uma Thurman, Jude Law, Alan Arkin, etc. turn in fantastic performances in their respective roles. This is a film about sheer determination, and realizing ones dream, though it's achieved in unethical fashion, but I didn't care because I believed in the performances of the actors. I also appreciated the occasional humor and memorable dialogue. I respect this extremely underrated sci-fi film that bombed at the box office (despite critical acclaim), and am happy to see that it's getting the respect it deserves as a cult classic years later. The special features are the standard 'making of', deleted scenes, original featurette, etc. The picture quality is pristine, and the sound is clear, though it's on the lower side, so adjust your volume accordingly.",1509148800,3,1567,4.9543726235741445
25983,5,0767805712,"I was assigned to watch and complete a worksheet on this movie for my biology class. I was concerned it wasn't going to be all that grand, but I was genuinely shocked at how well it was portrayed. There are some flaws, but I mean, what movie doesn't? I was glued to the screen the entire time and would watch it again and again. I highly recommend this movie. I was hoping there would be more information on the biological bit of it, sadly no; still a great movie.",1508198400,,464,4.224719101123595

26008,1,0767805712,It sucked.,1505433600,,10,4.5
26009,4,0767805712,"""Gattaca"" isn't aging as well as I thought that it would but it's still an engaging if minor key/ subdued science fiction vehicle that takes its science more seriously than its fiction which turns into a more procedural whodunit.  But before we get to the end resolve of the non-essential mystery of the movie and the surprise ending (someone was killed at a space launch site, but who could it have been, and why?) we are treated to a pretty prescient story about how society had modernized after carefully controlling the genetics of children at birth.  Life expectancy is up, productivity is up, currency for the genetically superior population is up, as are other character traits such as intelligence, mental acuity and alacrity, physical conditioning and beauty while certain other non-desirable traits are down or removed such as anti-social personality and hostility, tendency toward violence and uncontrolled emotions, etc.  In short the world of Gattaca is supposedly moving toward a manmade utopian ideal but the lower classes, those persons (usually older) who were borne of natural circumstances with all the variables that come along with the unknown and unpredictability within human nature, are the menial servant class.  Their dreams are restricted; their lives are limited.

In steps our protagonist, Vincent Freeman (Ethan Hawke), who is a naturally birthed man who still has dreams.  He was supposed to have died of a weak heart, per his DNA mapping, but he hasn't yet and wants to get into Gattaca and fly away to outer space.  But his dream is barred by his genetic deficiencies, until he meets with Jerome Morrow (Jude Law) who has perfect genetics but has been left a paraplegic from an accident.  Freeman assumes Morrow's identity with some subterfuge and the two work together to help Freeman sidestep Gattaca's screenings so he can get into the program and further his way toward his dreams.  There's genuine tension as Freeman must scrub his body of excess dead skin, hair that will fall out, use blood and urine sacs to avoid detection of his true (and supposedly inadequate) persona and this portion of the film is exciting and intriguing especially as his life gets more complicated when someone gets whacked in the Gattaca program and the detectives begin hunting for the culprit.  The police use genetic screening methods and they come closer and closer to catching Freeman who is now barely slipping by them, even while he has developed a risky relationship with Irene (Uma Thurman), and his world begins to fall apart and his dream is threatened.  The denouement of the movie which finds Freeman willing to risk it all (I won't ruin it, it's kind of cool I think for those who haven't seen it) is a worthwhile comment on the film's critical evaluation of what constitutes the human spirit and freedom.

This is a great film and I think that it would probably be more enjoyable for those people who eat up dramatic and smart thriller movies; persons who want more futuristic science fiction and especially special effects in their sci fi may be less impressed with ""Gattaca"" depending on what they are looking for.  Some may notice a slightly homoerotic (was I the only one to pick up on this? it wasn't so much about the characters in their interactions but how the movie was filmed and how it lingered on the male stars) tone to the movie, one that is accentuated by more muted and blue and silver colors for the movie's color wheel, but the movie's visual presentation lacks invention and forcefulness.  This in turn gives more suspense to the movie as there are fewer places to hide Freeman or distract a structured society that, I think the filmmaker and writers intend to comment on, is in danger of becoming sterile.  Are these two thoughts joined?  I highly doubt it, but it made me wonder.  4.5 stars.",1505347200,,3844,4.871165644171779

One scene that struck a chord with me is the one where Jerome slaps Vincent in the face with Gattaca's perversion of unconditional grace: ""Don't you get it! When they see you, they don't see you anymore, they see me."" Another profoundly religious parallel is seen in Jerome's parting gift. Here is a playboy at heart, who learns self sacrifice. He gives Vincent ""two-lifetimes"" worth of blood and flesh, that he (and in a sense they both together) might ascend into the heavens. As a Christian, this variation, this strange communion of souls, struck a chord with me. As Jerome put it; ""I lent you my body. You lent me your dreams.""

This movie has so many rich themes. One is of course overcoming self doubt, and trying to be someone your aren't in order to please others. When ""Jerome"" is exposed to Irene as Vincent; he confronts her as well regarding what ""they"" have got her believing about herself. There are so many favorite scenes for me in this film. There is the scene, the final race in the open sea between Vincent and his brother, where he tells his brother the simple secret: ""I saved nothing for the swim back."" There's the scene where he must suffer brutal surgery in order to be the right height. And of course, throughout the movie, the constant tension of always having to be perfect, perfect, perfect--not even an eyelash out of place.

As story telling and inspiring goes, they don't get too much better than Gattaca. And you have to give a thumbs up to the actors, and the music was spot on perfect too. The cast was well chosen, and all the scenes. It's not only great storytelling, it's a work of art.",1482019200,16,2100,4.579787234042553

26185,5,0767805712,"This movie dates itself when you see the old pc's and technology used in the film, and for whatever reason the trailer for this movie seems much more dated than the movie looks in general. HOWEVER! The sci fi theme and questions posed about the dangers of using in vitro and genetic testing to essentially create ""designer babies"" is still relevant today. It's a great film I saw years ago for a philosophy class I took in college, and I still love it. I'm so glad I own a copy now. I've had several friends sit down with me to watch this film. If you enjoy stories that warn about how bad society could get if we let our technologies go unchecked, then this film is for you. By no means does it say in vitro in itself is a bad thing, only the implications for using it combined with pre screening for the ""perfect kids"" and a society which judges people by their genetic makeup, which creates a caste system based on these genetic markers. It is really interesting and the acting is good.",1477008000,,989,4.351351351351352

A dystopian film that has an inspiring ending: we are more than the sum of our parts and the human spirit can be indomitably strong.

On another note: despite what has happened later, there is a huge amount of chemistry and deep admiration between Hawke and Thurman, which really made the movie successful and led to a reasonably long marriage (for Hollywood) and children.

26226,4,0767805712,"Set in the near future, this film explores the possibilities and complications of genetic engineering. The fortunates have their attributes selected prior to birth. They are strong, smart; the perfect human being. Others, God children, those conceived the old fashioned way, are bumped to second or third class citizens. In this future, a blood or urine test is all thats needed for a person to go far or to be denied opportunity. Vincent is an example of this new disadvantaged. He is however imbued with a determination to overcome his genetic limitations and travel into space. To do this he needs to adopt the persona of Jerome, a biological marvel who has fallen on hard times. All is going to plan, when a murder brings an intrusive police investigation.

I have seen this film several times now and I always enjoy it. Ethan Hawke as Vincent and Jude Law as Jerome are excellent. Their future world is aptly colourless and sterile. Expressions are always serious, clothing is austere. The eerie musical score and Hawkes narration make for a hypnotic atmosphere. Even in this restrained and supposedly predictable world though, human passions and mistakes are still a fact of life. This is a very well paced and often tense film. It raises many intriguing questions about the interaction between technology and human development. It is a very entertaining, yet cautionary tale.",1470873600,,1382,5.008695652173913

26374,5,0767805712,"A prominent criticism of this brilliant film is that Eugene's suicide detracts from the overall message. Suicide is a terrifying act, yes, but Gattaca is filled with symbolism (e.g., parallels between genetic and racial prejudice as suggested by the Freeman last name). The moral is one of complete and total commitment to something higher than oneself. For Vincent, this was reaching space and the proving that the assumed potential of a faith birth had been misjudged. For Eugene, this was the acceptance of his own limitations and role as the man facilitating or serving Vincent's dream rather than his own, symbolized by his eventual appreciation for his second place silver metal. While Vincent is on Titan, Eugene's presence on Earth could easily be detected through random genetic testing and would undermine Vinvent's credibility upon his return. Think ""giving tree"" in making the sacrifice of his mobility, name, blood, and eventually his life to help Vincent achieve his goals. It is  yet another beautiful act in its own right. Full disclosure, though, this is my favorite film so I am biased.",1466812800,,1104,5.133333333333334

It is just an extension of what the Nazi's were trying to do.  The question is, ""Who gets to define perfection?""

in the settings and background.  Inspiring message with a satisfying ending.

While some of the dialogue is kitsch (mostly stuff given to Uma and Ethan's characters) and the movie clearly reflects 90s aesthetics more than any future or near-future one can imagine, it still is a whole helluva lot better than any of the dreck the playing-it-safe, sequel- and superhero-obsessed Hollywood puts out today.

26561,3,0767805712,"I saw this movie when it first came out and probably would have given it 4 stars then. It didn't seem as great to me this time around, and not because I'd seen it before--I'd actually forgotten most of the details. I found the story lacking in terms of what exactly was so important about Vincent's flight and what he would be doing ... or maybe I wasn't paying attention? Something about the fraternal tension fell flat. And Jerome's mode of travel at the end: nobody would choose that. I did like the juxtaposition of 1940s-ish design and culture with the space-age stuff.

The excellent takeaway is that genes do not control 100 percent of our destiny. Accidents, willpower, and other factors come into play.

Cast: I'm not a fan of Jude Law, but he is very good here as a wounded soul. Ethan Hawke does okay. Uma Thurman's acting skills were not very well developed at this point. Loren Dean is better than I remembered; what happened to that guy? Fun to see good supporting work from Xander Berkeley, Alan Arkin, and Ernest Borgnine.",1465257600,3,1038,4.605405405405405

It is set in the future with all the advanced technology of the future, but has somewhat of a film noir feeling as to the way it was shot, the storyline and the characters, but all in a futuristic environment. It is about how in the future people are genetically engineered, and those that aren't are discriminated against. But some characters in this film try to get around that discrimination using trickery and advanced technology. Very much worth my time to watch this movie. I was able to watch it for free because of my Amazon Prime membership. This movie had a great story line, a few twist, wonderful lighting, and creative filming. The costumes were also well thought out and assisted in the noir feel of this movie.

Sci-fi has been my obsession, my whole life, and I think in terms of content, dialog, technology, graphics, acting, settings, costume design, theme, premise, etc., it all fell short.

In many aspects it was reflective of Aldous Huxley's ""Brave New World,"" albeit a very poorly executed version.  More than anything this is more of a suspenseful thriller/drama, with a touch of sci-fi.",1464652800,,662,4.663793103448276

26697,5,0767805712,"A classic that seems more relevant now than when I saw it years ago, because it has many parallels to our lives today. This isn't so much sci-fi as it is a psychological study. It asks what does it mean to be human? Is it our flaws that make us who we really are? And what happens in a society where flaws are not tolerated and we discriminate against the less than perfect? (SPOILERS HERE) To me, the most memorable character was Jerome Morrow. Being the embodiment of perfection--why did Jerome not excel to the heights? He had every physical advantage, so why did he win only a silver medal? And why was he so suicidal as the ""perfect"" man, that he walked in front of a car? It showed that genetic advantages cannot overcome a person's inner angst. And Jude Law's bitter, depressed Jerome Morrow was heartbreaking. The scene where he drags himself up the stairs was excruciating to watch.  Uma Thurman was her usual languid, one-note self.  Ethan Hawke was very good. But it was Law's performance that made this movie for me. This was the same year he made ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" and the difference between sallow, broken Jerome Morrow and the bronzed Adonis Dickie Greenleaf shows you just how amazing and versatile an actor he is.",1464220800,,1238,4.597285067873303

But Gattaca was different. It was about a regular guy, a 'God child', who was trying to fulfill his dreams in a world of genetically engineered people.

Without giving any spoilers, the main character, Vincent, has to overcome his own doubts and shortcomings, while competing those who are genetically 'perfect'.

It is at heart a conflict of man against himself. Throw in a murder mystery, and some romance, and this ended up being a thoroughly enjoyable film.

I highly recommend it.",1463788800,,630,4.9714285714285715

26818,2,0767805712,"The first 30 minutes or so of Gattaca are pretty great. We're introduced to a not-so-distant (and relatively plausible) future world where ""natural"" birth is performed in vitro under the guidance of geneticists who carefully engineer/select the most genetically gifted and healthy zygote. From birth, people are identified and defined entirely by their genetic makeup and the diseases to which they are or are not predisposed. The film does a really great job of exploring the philosophical, moral, and legal implications of such a society, and the resultant discrimination that ""invalids"" - those who are born in vivo - face both in their health insurance and job prospects. There's also a nice underlying message that is touched upon: often times the best person for a job may not be the absolute smartest or healthiest candidate, but the one who is the most passionate about the work.

It really is a shame though that, after a great setup, the story the film actually delivers is that of a by-the-numbers, mediocre sci-fi thriller. A good hour or so of the film's hour and 45 minutes is spent on a string of close-calls where our protagonist - an ""invalid"" posing as a ""valid"" in hopes of fulfilling his dream of space travel - evades authorities who are on his trail. That's pretty much it. There is barely any character development that occurs during this section of the film (or even after for that matter) and the juiciness of the world and its moral implications is neglected in favor of underwhelming ""thrills"" as Ethan Hawke thinks on his feet to evade being discovered.

Uma Thurman is given essentially nothing to do. At the outset, she is a relatively intriguing character - possibly another invalid posing as a valid - and there seems to be promise of future development where we learn more about her. Instead, her character ultimately amounts to a love interest for Hawke so that we can have a melodramatic scene towards the finale backed by a sappy string arrangement. Her character goes nowhere and ends up being completely flat.

Finally, there's that ever-so-necessary plot twist at the end of the film which I won't spoil, but feels extremely contrived and implausible. And even if it wasn't so contrived, the revelation ultimately doesn't even amount to much of anything in terms of character or plot development. It's basically just used for a laughably ""climactic"" scene which is meant to mirror a scene from earlier in the film. It all just ends up feeling cartoony.

Still, credit where credit is due. At the very least, Gattaca did have some interesting ideas and a well-realized vision of the future that felt very plausible and saved the film from being absolutely awful. After a great opening though, it devolved into a flat thriller which ultimately nose-dived at the finale, squandering the potential it had to be a great, thought-provoking sci-fi film.",1463356800,3,2885,4.9300411522633745

26849,3,0767805712,"I was hoping for a science fiction experience with some good acting...turned out to be a cerebral suspense movie based in the ""not too distant future"".  Uma Thurmond is nice to look at, but this wasn't Ethan Hawke's best performance.  For someone living his dream, albiet with his life always at risk of being discovered, I could not buy into his character.

If you're hoping for some sci-fi action...forget-about-it.  The only action is Ethan and Uma running down a back alley at night.

Believable?  The main premise where society is totally based upon genetic manipulation and the old Eugenics & Nazi ""betterment of the race"" concept is totally believable.  Astronauts going into space in 3-piece suits...not so much.

Overall, I'd say this was a boring movie I would not want to experience again.",1463011200,,800,4.962406015037594

26945,5,0767805712,"The title GATTACA represent the four DNA bases--Guanine, Thymine, Cytosine, Adenine.
The cinematography and the story are absolutely timeless.  There are not any cues that would place this as being filmed in the 90's, or 00's or . . .  I showed it to my children in 2016 and they believed it to be a recent release.
The message is also timeless.  Discrimination based upon genetic makeup.  Try reading ""Harrison Bergeron"" by Kurt Vonnegot as a contrast to the story of Gattaca.  [...]
One of the best sci-fi stories ever told.  This is not an action film, though there is plenty of tension.  I found my heart pounding multiple times.  This is not a romance film, though there is attraction.  It demands thought, though not as much as Inception.
One of my favorite lines is Vincent's reply to his brother about how he conquered him in a swim contest.  I will not ruin it for you.  Go find it for yourself.

27128,4,0767805712,"Warning: spoilers ahead. Even though this film is beautifully shot and worth the watch, I found myself with a few nagging questions.

For a start, if genetic scanning is that cheap and common why wasn't he caught already? One keyboard or screen can hold a ton of DNA from sneezes, breath, even traces from body sweat. A vacuum duster won't clear all of that off. Certainly someone would have considered swabbing screens as a less invasive way to check people, right?

Also, why does the super smart scientist hero have a serious case of the stupids? Laying low for a few days would have prevented most the the problems in the film. He even has sex at one point! Sex is all about DNA swapping. You don't do it if you're trying to hide your genome. His room mate, frankly, is much smarter. If the hero had been smarter, his room mate wouldn't have had to clean up after him over and over again. The poor guy even killed himself just to tie up lose ends so the hero wouldn't be caught! I felt so bad for him.

Outside of the raging stupidity of the protagonist and the clear genetic plot-hole, this was an enjoyable watch.",1461110400,2,1119,4.422330097087379

27220,4,0767805712,"This review is for ""Gattaca.""

Gattaca is a tale of genetic engineering.  It isn't about those who are genetically engineered, rather about one person who wasn't.  Vincent Freeman, played by Ethan Hawke, is a natural born person.  A ""God Child"" as they say in the film.  All he desires in life is to travel to space, but is aware that it will be impossible due to the fact that he was naturally born, and therefore has vision and heart problems.  He later finds Jerome Morrow, played by Jude Law, and uses his DNA to fool the system.  Eventually, he does make it to space.

This film contains plenty of twists and turns.  There are numerous times when you expect Vincent to be caught, but somehow he manages.  This is not a movie filled with action, but contains an in depth, gripping story instead.  I recommend this movie to sci-fi, thriller, and drama fans alike.  There is enough of a love story that my girlfriend enjoyed it, but not so much that it took over the story.",1460851200,13,975,4.4772727272727275
27221,5,0767805712,"Excellent story about genetic manipulation before birth.  A society trying to get the perfect child for every couple.  Only there is no such thing as the ""perfect"" anything.  This movie is not to science fiction.  We have people now trying to manipulation the sex of their child before birth, choosing how many babies to have at one time, and I've even heard of parents trying to select the eye color, hair color, etc., of their child to be.  People trying to be Gods will only tune sour.",1460764800,,488,4.563218390804598

27237,4,0767805712,"Nicely done.  I love sci fi but there is so much more bad sci fi than good sci fi.  This definitely falls in the ""good sci fi"" camp.  My only quibble is that Ethan Hawke and Jude Law don't look enough alike for Hawke's character to plausibly pass for Law's.  But that's a minor detail.  Perhaps less minor but still not overwhelming is the lack of development of Hawke's character that would explain why so many people are willing to help him, including Thurman's character and the lab guy, whoever he is.

27353,1,0767805712,"The moral of the film is that we should not strive for genetic improvement, because this would create jealousy, sadness, resentment, discrimination, etc for those were not as genetically gifted. This premise ignores the fact that drastic inequality already occurs in natural evolution, and has always been an element of all life. This film plays into currently popular egalitarian ideologies that try to ignore, eliminate, or camouflage this process, in a quest for a utopia where everyone can believe that they are more or less 'equal' to everyone else and there is nothing to offend anyone's fragile ego. But of course, this is the antithesis of evolution. So, in short, the premise, conception, and perspective of the movie are lame. I only made it through the first 30 minutes or so, and it was uninteresting and predictable. The main character's parents express some sort of Christian/naturalist faith in natural childbirth (playing to popular attitudes today), as if rolling the dice with your child's genetics is morally superior to using science to reduce their suffering throughout life from genetic defects, or allowing them to enjoy superior traits (who wouldn't want straight teeth? perfect eyesight? healthy bones? a strong immune system? a quick mind? excellent memory? a non-violent temperament? etc. ). The kid goes on whining about his older brother having all this good stuff while he has to wear glasses, etc. Though, again, you don't need eugenics for this dynamic to happen. Check out ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"". I suppose one could say that Gattaca is a science fiction film for whiners. I would recommend going to read some Nietzsche instead. We all succeed through the advancement of even a few, especially if this advance is passed down genetically to future generations. Whiners/egalitarians would refuse this advancement to all future generations, so that they don't have to feel inferior and no one is offended. And the final message of the original - more or less, ""where would you be if only the genetically perfect were born?"" - this is a specious argument, since there are countless billions of potential people who have not been born throughout human history. Who is crying over these billions of unborn babies? (hmmm... many people against eugenics today might also support abortion. Go figure. Maybe the writers of the script were pro-life Christians?) Anyway, you, me, none of us would be here if more genetically advanced humans were being selected, but then again, those who would be here would live happier and healthier lives. And that is what evolution is all about.",1458864000,,2606,5.119718309859155
27354,2,0767805712,"I decided to watch this due to the high rating, and because I'm a fan of sci-fi flicks.

I'm honestly not sure what others see in this film. It was directed -- and acted -- in a way that conveyed almost no emotion, no urgency, no drama. It was as if the characters were in a dream. So many moments that *could* have had nail-biting tension instead were portrayed in a bland manner that caused no excitement in the viewer at all.

27365,5,0767805712,"We're actually getting there, we just can't sequence the genome and interpret it as fast and as routinely as in the movie. At present, hospitals are already using exome (basically all the DNA sequences that code for proteins and miRNAs) sequencing quite routinely to find the causes of Mendelian diseases, but whole genome sequencing and analysis for common diseases affected by numerous genes are still challenging in the clinical setting mainly because of challenges in data analysis. Also, at present, in reality, predisposition to some diseases that are late onset is not allowed to be tested in children to protect them from being alienated by parents, and patients can choose not to know incidental findings in their genetic testing result in case they can't handle them. Furthermore, insurance discrimination has not occurred. So while the technology is getting there, to the best of my knowledge, the policy is not (while I'm a molecular biology major, I'm really not very literate in policy). Gene determinism is false; there're the epigenome and environment affecting the phenotype, including how likely you will get a disease. Identical twins can get very different when they're old because of that, and for common diseases, genetics is only part of the story. Even for cancer, the epigenome still has a role, like when DNA methylation silences tumor suppressors even when they're not mutated. Don't underestimate the effects of the epigenome and environment, and there's no gene for the human spirit!

About the movie itself: I really like the music; it so vividly embodies Vincent's dream and the possibility that it will not come true because of genetic discrimination. I really admire Vincent and the doctor at the end of the movie who knew that Vincent borrowed Jerome's identity. In spite of genetics, Vincent could swim better than his engineered brother Anton and did successfully complete the training. Maybe it's the epigenome - which wasn't that well studied yet back in 1997 - as shaped by lifestyle and environment. I also feel sorry for the real Jerome, who incinerated himself (I almost burst into tears when he did so). I think the director put the pianist with polydactyly with purpose; polydactyly is usually considered a genetic disorder and patients usually undergo surgery to remove the extra fingers when they're young. But the beautiful music can only be played with 12 fingers. This shows what's commonly perceived as a defect can actually be an advantage; genetic defect does not preclude a person from success. There will be somewhere for the ""defective"" people to glow.

However, the movie has some flaws. It actually makes sense to bar physically unqualified people from becoming astronauts, though just a gene test as depicted in this movie is not enough and is not a good standard to use; there should be actual physical tests. I'm actually not sure if Vincent is fit enough; on the one hand, his heart couldn't withstand long running, but on the other hand, Vincent could swim faster and farther than Anton. If he's not physically qualified, he can still get closer to his dream by becoming an astronomer or aerospace engineer; heart disease and myopia won't make one inferior in those two jobs. Even if he's not intelligent enough to be an astronomer or aerospace engineer, he can still be an artist who designs the aesthetic aspects of the spaceship and spacesuits; that's much better then being a janitor. Another point I want to make is, if I'm the director's theology professor, then I'll give him a fail. But perhaps I missed the point here; perhaps the point he tried to make is that genetic determinism, by ignoring the fact that there's no gene for the human spirit, turns people into spiritually dead callous machines.",1458518400,,3770,5.020766773162939

Yes, from DNA testing today the medical field can know if you will have mental or physical concerns from exams within 99% I hope in the future we can prevent most diseases from being past on and actually increase quality of life and length! The FUTURE is ALREAY here PEOPLE- already released is the TESLA X which can drive 100% on its own and in two years GOOGLE is releasing multiple self driving cars also. I see robots -like I robots as the REAL future and yes TERMINATOR being true to some extent. Today we depend on computers to communicate to each other, record data and execute commands. There is not anything else much left to be computer/robotic controlled except humans themselves!

It is just that it is a lower budget film and therefore doesn't have all the visual effects many other films rely upon. This may actually be a strength in that the message does not become lost within the visual stimuli.

 Gattaca is about not accepting the society's view of what a person is or can become. Genetic engineering has become the norm and natural birth is the new underclass. Gattaca illustrates you cannot put people into this pigeon hole idea. Genetics only affect the physical and health characteristics of a person, it does nothing for will or desire.

This film is more suited to an adult audience with the ability to appreciate the message presented. Kids will be bored and teens will probably not care.

27586,4,0767805712,"Even though this film is now 18 years old, it actually deals with an issue that has moved to the forefront of American medicine, which is the identification of treatments that match the genetic patterns of individuals. Gattaca, which was released in 1997 deals with the theme, presented by Blair Underwood, that multiple egg-sperm combinations by a couple could be analyzed to determine which combination of their genes would produce the most advantageous child. Love children or children born of parents who did not use this form of genetic selection are thus less beautiful, less intelligent, and less talented or athletic than children born of random combinations of sperm and egg.

Thus, the genes are not manipulated, but only the best combination of a couples genes would be preserved. In this film a love child must compete all his life with his younger brother, selected by the parents for his genetic strengths of beauty, strength, and intelligence. Ethan Hawke plays Vincent Freeman, a man who was conceived the old fashioned way in the back seat of a car, who has to stay constantly on his toes to compete with his younger brother, played by Loren Dean. However Vincent has decided he wishes to be an astronaut in a society where only the strongest, brightest, bravest are allowed achieving that vocational dream,

However, not all is benevolent in this society since the selective breeding process has created a class of demi-gods who look down upon their fellow humans who were less endowed. Further, through biomarkers and various surveillance technologies, those of superior genetic qualities are provided with perks and employment that those without these qualities cannot obtain.

Thus this film is about the ordinary everyman who dreams of attaining heights of accomplishment but must compete with the best of the best. Add to this drama a love interest played by Uma Thurman, and a murder mystery with an inquisitive detective, played by Alan Arkin. However it is the relationship between Vincent and Jerome Morrow, played by Jude Law, that offers some of the most subtle commentary in the film. Morrow , despite perfection, is an alcoholic who has been crippled in an accident, and now is willing to provide the biomarkers needed for Vincent to engage in the daily activities of the elected super-humans.

The title of the film is awkward while the soundtrack by Michael Nyman is ethereal. The cast is superb and the art direction is minimal and clean. I enjoyed it. I was entertained from beginning to end.",1422921600,2,2527,5.0095238095238095

27598,5,0767805712,"Every so often, one sees a movie and says ""this is the best movie I've ever seen---I probably won't see anything as moving as this. And sure enough, something comes along that is as good and many times better. The human condition is so varied and multi-faceted that one may never exhaust all the permutations of artistic expression that can be shown. For example, when the TV science fiction hit ""Star Trek"" came out I thought it was so fantastic. But when ""ST The Next Generation"" came along, I had serious doubts that it could match the original. Then, as I marveled at the story lines and the extra dimension of character interactions, I felt that TNG is better and can't be topped. With each iteration something new was introduced that explored the vastness of human interaction and inter-species interactions. Etc., Etc.
GATTACA is yet another example of plumbing the depths of humanity, including out obsession with categorizing humans along the lines of artificial inventions like ""Race"", ""Caste System"", ""Colorism"". GATTACA is a haunting and beautifully conceived expression of the insanity that has had humanity in its grips for centuries and has made us into a species exemplified in the title of a book ""Homo Hierarchicus""(by Louis Dumont)
One phrase that implies how illusory and meaningless these artifices is the one on the DVD cover that says---""There is no gene for the human spirit"". Unfortunately, those of us who've become cynical about that inner essence of a human that makes us unique and gives expression to us being more than an accidental collection of sophisticated chemicals. Without that recognition of the ""soul"" oh humans, we become prey to seeing each other simply in terms of genes and eventually slide into the dark philosophies and practices of eugenics, racism, nihilism, and skepticism concerning the existence of an ""Unknowable Essence"" who is beyond the ken and comprehension of finite minds.
Nonetheless, this Unknowable Essence has created laws of mathematics and sciences that fashion and determine actions in the physical realm, and laws and principles that govern the ""Spiritual Realm"". One such spiritual law is ""Love"" which can't be measured and which has an analogue in the physical world called gravitational attraction and particle interactions. It is this force ""Love"" which allows humans to see past the need to relegate people to various categories based on tribal, racial, color, religious preference, and ethnicity. Other limitations have arisen to join the mix which we need not go into now.

Baha'u'llah, the most recent of God's Messengers, has infused into the realm of human experience on the planet a new consciousness when in the 19th Century hw declared that the time has come for the forging of humankind into ""A New Race"" exemplified, among other places in his Writings the following:
""O CHILDREN OF MEN! Know ye not why We created you all from the same dust? That no one should exalt himself over the other. Ponder at all times in your hearts how ye were created. Since We have created you all from one same substance it is incumbent on you to be even as one soul, to walk with the same feet, eat with the same mouth and dwell in the same land, that from your inmost being, by your deeds and actions, the signs of oneness and the essence of detachment may be made manifest. Such is My counsel to you, O concourse of light! Heed ye this counsel that ye may obtain the fruit of holiness from the tree of wondrous glory.""

This is a sample of a new Paradigm which when fully explored, accepted, and implemented in our private and daily lives and policies, will protect us from falling prey to the miseries of apartheid, ""Jim Crow Society"", The Caste System, racist attitudes so clearly and chillingly portrayed in America, and elsewhere, and in our tendencies towards being religiously fanatical in our interpretations and applications of Religious principles.",1418515200,,3921,4.957446808510638

27654,4,0767805712,"With 575 previous reviewers, there's really no need for my two cents but I do wonder if anyone else sees the inherent flaw in the set-up.

Here's the scoop. In the near future people are conceived artificially to eliminate as many genetic deficiencies as possible. Ethan Hawke was conceived naturally and has, among other things, a bad heart. He makes a deal with a genetically near perfect person (Jude Law) who has lost the use of his legs. Said deal allows Hawke to manipulate the system and be the first in line for a trip to Titan. But there was a murder in the office and the investigation might expose him for who he really is.

I do like this movie very much. I like the look, the story, the acting and much else about it. I think it's very clever with the right amount of tension meted out in good measure.. The big head-scratcher for me though is the basis of the story. The society has the ""genetic code"" thing down so tight it can predict a person's life expectancy to a tight time line. Why then, in Hawke's case, can't they fix his heart? Or any other person's malady for that matter. The gaping flaw being exposed though didn't lessen my enjoyment of it. All the primary actors do a stand-up job. Uma Thurman looks delicious. Even Ernest Borgnine does a decent job in his decidedly small role.

27660,5,0767805712,"Ultimately, the core of this film is human striving, human imperfection, and personal meaning. No matter where one finds oneself on the bell curve, there is always someone further to the right. If not, every friend, lover, relative and person one will ever know lies somewhere to the left. Only acceptance of this fact, over all metrics, will allow true equity to exist for everyone on the spectrum.

Gattaca is a 1997 film written and directed by Andrew M. Niccol. It was his first feature film -- although he was an accomplished director of commercials -- and was followed by The Truman Show and In Time, among others. It falls into the genre of science fiction, and is set in the near future. Genetic technology is ubiquitous, but was just becoming accepted at the time of the protagonist's birth.

Vincent is conceived and carried to term without intervention via genetic technologies that select or modify zygotes prior to cell division. The original script called this a ""faith birth,"" although the term ""IN-VALID,"" pronounced like the word ""invalid"" in ""an invalid driver's license,"" is used more prominently in the movie. Vincent has varying propensities for genetically-influenced issues such as aggression, obesity, and attention-deficit disorder, which remain untreatable in an age where the obvious solution is for them to be eradicated by genetically selecting them out of existence. He has a genetic heart condition which results in a 99% chance of a 30.5-year life expectancy. His parents' awareness of this causes them to treat him as an invalid his entire childhood and to stress his limitations instead of his potential.

Vincent's younger brother, Anton, is genetically enhanced, and therefore VALID. The process of his genetic selection is described in more detail in an earlier script, including the fact that his parents had to save every dime for two years in order to afford the process, but were unable to afford enhancements such as the ""innate"" ability to play the piano or understand higher mathematics.

Anton and Vincent are rivals -- most tellingly at open ocean swimming -- with Anton's enhanced physicality and Vincent's heart condition leading to predictable results, at least during childhood. Anton stands indifferently by as Vincent leaves home at sixteen, disappearing into the genetic underclass of day laborers, housecleaners and sanitation workers.

Anton is a child of privilege and an adult who displays many of the markers of childhood, perhaps because he never had to face adversity in his own life. As lead investigator of a murder committed at the corporation where Vincent, and later Jerome, is employed, these qualities surface. Due to an errant eyelash, Vincent (the IN-VALID) becomes a suspect. Anton searches for him, or any genetic traces of him, without revealing that they are related, and without initially suspecting that Vincent is posing as VALID.

Society is divided into IN-VALIDs and VALIDs. The law outlaws overt discrimination based on genetics, but the reality of society is one similar to the Reconstruction South and Jim Crow. Tacit acceptance of a genetic underclass -- with diminishing demographics (and political power) due to the rapid adoption of genetic intervention -- but with subtle and not so subtle social ""selection processes"" inevitably at work.

For example, Vincent works hard to improve his skills and knowledge so that he can become a celestial navigator. His attempts at employment are consistently foiled based on drug testing which also reveals his genetic status. A more ""qualified"" applicant is chosen. His only recourse is manual unskilled labor, thus his short stint of employment as a janitor at the Gattaca Aerospace Corporation.

Selection occurs not just in employment, but in mate selection as well. Today women will run a background check on potential mates to determine their (criminal?) past or economic prospects. In the film, they do the same for unseen genetic qualities -- thus Vincent's dates eventually migrate to Anton based upon their surreptitious collection and testing of genetic material.

Why would these women ever accept the economic consequences of an IN-VALID's prospects? Why would they opt for a reduced quality of life based on their spouse's potential susceptibility to untreatable ailments or reduced life expectancy? They want a quality partner with a comparable chance for a lengthy high quality life together, similar or better offspring and mitigation of risk. Any reasonable person would desire the same, with the vast majority willing to fudge a little with respect to the ""means"" in order to maximize the ""ends.""

Vincent is marginalized in both his professional and personal life -- reduced to the permanent underclass, his dreams of space travel unrealized or unrealizable, alone and without prospects -- yet remains resolved. He is not defeated. He works, saves his money and spends every moment of free time educating himself or working out. He constantly goes without and always pushes himself.

He resorts to a ""borrowed ladder"" in the form of Jerome Eugene Morrow, a paraplegic willing to provide skin, hair, blood and urine samples to Vincent on an ongoing basis so that Vincent might represent himself as Jerome, a VALID with ""Eugene's"" genetics and Vincent's hard earned knowledge and skills. Vincent's resolve is further demonstrated by his having both shin bones surgically severed and reset with titanium rods, increasing his height 2"" to match Eugene's genetic profile for height. The scars are explained as being exactly the height of the front fender of a '99 Chrysler LeBaron.

Vincent's heartbeat during tests is a recording of Eugene's, resulting in the lab tech Lamar's comment ""Six miles later it's still beating like a Goddamn metronome. I could play piano by that heartbeat of his."" Meanwhile Vincent's actual heartbeat is over 220 as he masks extreme fatigue, lactic acid buildup and oxygen deprivation by sheer force of will, confident in public but collapsing in private once it is over. Only extremes of discipline and training allow him to pull off this ruse.

However his prowess as a celestial navigator is not faked, as evidenced by this assessment: ""I reviewed your flight plan. Not one error in a hundred thousand keystrokes. Phenomenal. (placing a hand on Jerome's shoulder) It's right that someone like you is taking us to Titan."" Note the ""...like you..."" instead of ""...someone with your skills..."" or ""...someone with your knowledge..."" This distinction is the critical take away of this exchange. The script is full of undercurrents as subtle and deep as this minor inflection.

However as much as the film is at its surface about big ideas -- about institutional and societal discrimination -- it ultimately reveals itself to be about the relationships between its characters. About Vincent/Anton, Vincent/Irene, Vincent/Lamar, and Vincent/Eugene... and how their relationships are framed by these larger issues.",1394928000,,6980,5.242831541218638

Possible spoilers

I give no apologies for this review, it is completely biased one, first things first, and this review is about the `superbit' circ 1998. If this review is found next to another format version, please ignore.

A genetically inferior man assumes the identity of an enhanced genetically tweaked superior individual in order to pursue his ultimate dream of space travel; by doing this, he has committed the crime of using a borrowed ladder  by using the genetic profile of another person. Gattaca is in many ways is one the best films seen. Just as people have been judged for centuries by the colour of their skin, their class or religious persuasion Gattaca predicts and explores the future where there will be a more subtle discrimination. It being a science fiction film helps make it more effective by allowing us to feel the emotions of the characters with little of our own history getting in the way. A haunting musical score goes well with the feeling of the film, with stunning visual backdrops and the very clear use of tinted lenses makes each scene vibrant eye candy.

Ethan Hawke as Vincent does a sterling job of displaying how the odds are stacked against from his very inception! This is someone whose life is limited before he even tries. However, just as fascinating were the theoretically superior characters; Vincent's girlfriend, brother and his genetic original who suffer from the lie that genetics can perfectly predict a person's life.

This disc plays well on a number of first generation DVD players. The colours are solid the sound is excellent; please note I did not try out the various sound enhanced systems, i.e. 5.1 Dolby, as I do not have this equipment. That said, the Superbit DVD was played on HD DVD player, and HD Flat screen TV. The experience is mind-blowing; I cannot see the difference between picture quality on this DVD and some of the newer HD DVD releases. OK HD DVD is a defunct format, but it shows that up scaling this DVD gives it 'Angelic wings'. Is it worth buying? The answer is yes. This Superbit DVD makes a fantastic film, even more mind blowing.

Some years ago at a film event, I asked Ernest Borgnine, who played the janitor in the film, what he thought of GATTACA. In a rather dismissive way, he said he did not get it. Well that is his flawed genome. If you would like to see a sci-fi film that is based on curious characters and thought provoking circumstances - and not explosions, try Gattaca.

27713,5,0767805712,"Gattaca, in a word, is a brilliant science fiction film.
No matter where you look, Gattaca astounds you, and holds up against the years. It is destined to become a science fiction classic.

Ethan Hawke gives a flawless performance as Vincent Freeman, one of the last natural humans in a world of genetic enhancement, pre-birth specialization, and advanced science. Jude Law, in perhaps his finest performance ever, beautifully portrays a tortured and broken wreck of a man. Uma Thurman plays a femme fatale, and Alan Arkin, the scene-stealing noirish detective (Gattaca pays a lot of homages to film noir classics of old). The rest of the cast gives brilliant performances, and the result is a character driven sci-fi (Solaris, Blade Runner), rather than a tech-driven sci-fi (Aliens, Star Trek Into Darkness).

The characters hold up just as well. Each is real, sympathetic, layered, and deep.

Andrew Niccol, writer of The Truman Show, directs with subtle nuance, attention to detail, and an eye for a good image. The cinematography of Gattaca is astounding, atmospheric, and very beautiful, with throwbacks to sci-fi films of old such as Blade Runner, and the great cinematic film noirs. The sets and technology fit the film perfectly - never showy (as sci-fi films often tend to be) but perfectly fitting the world of the film.

The action and suspense pack Gattaca to the top. The suspense is kept on full burn the entire film, with Vincent being suspected of the brutal murder of a flight planner. A riveting cat-and-mouse game begins between the characters, with myriad twists, turns, and agonizingly tense bursts of action.
But at it's core, Gattaca is a film with a heart. It has an emotional core to it, a sensitive, at times romantic and sad core. It's ending is both thrilling, intensely touching, and brilliant. It also asks important questions about ethics, the nature of science, mankind, and genetics. It's view of the future is believable, entertaining, and ingenious.

Gattaca is one of cinema's most underrated science fiction films. A character driven masterpiece, with brilliant acting and direction, cool tech, a brilliant story, and a thought-provoking core, Gattaca is destined to reign with cinema's all-time great sci-fi films.

27726,5,0767805712,A sci-fi movie that deals with the very essence of freedom and equality. The film is as perfect in its details as Vincent Anton Freeman (played by Ethan Hawke) has to be in passing for Jerome Eugene Morrow (played by Jude Law).,1368662400,,227,4.428571428571429
27727,3,0767805712,"I watched this movie when it came out, and had a vague recollection of it being a dystopian vision of a possible future, where gene testing is used to segment people by caste. That's all I really remembered of it, along with vague imagery of very pretty, very well dressed people going about their business.

Watching it again recently, my impressions are sort of different. Yes, this vision of the future looks like a sort of futuristic Ralph Lauren commercial. The thing is, this isn't horrifying. It's a welcome relief to the eyes to look at a lot of people who keep fit and dress like they respect themselves. Look around you: I see a lot of loud, shambling wildebeests who make me long for this future well-dressed ""dystopia"" no matter how oppressive it might be. Even the cars are pretty cool looking. Bring it on. Probably, this is intimidating to slobs; I found it invigorating.

Science-wise, we know something about how genetic testing works, and what it can do. No, you will never have testing sniffer thingees or finger blood takers that can instantly sequence an individual: chemistry and physics don't work that way. No, we can't tell to a high degree of probability what people will die of. Genes are statistically important, but environment is pretty important in health outcomes. I have lousy genes for strength training: proven by genetic science (though you could tell looking at me before I started lifting weights). Yet, I'm pretty damn strong. I don't even train real hard. Environment. Sure, some people have grave health defects which can be detected by genetic testing: most people don't. And ... why was the Gattica space camp constantly doing the same damn gene test on everyone, several times a day at work? Also, for a society so obsessed with genetic perfection, why can't they breed people who don't have such glaring cartoon-like character defects?

Speaking of the characters, I have no sympathy for any of them. I know who I'm supposed to identify with: the non-genetic engineered protagonist. He is a selfish sociopathic jerk. He wants to go to outer space. Hey, so do I. I also don't have a life threatening heart condition which could get everyone else in the space ship killed, nor am I functionally blind, which could also get everyone in the space ship killed, since he's training to be a navigator. Finally, despite his bad ticker, he wants to shack up with a girl ... with a bad ticker. Gee, wouldn't it be great to have ""normal"" kids with bad tickers that kill them at 30? What kind of monster is he? The detective: jerk. The protagonist's gene engineered brother: insecure jerk, and a cowardly ninny. The wheelchair bound superman: petulant creepy jerk who has no motivation for any of his actions. Gore Vidal's character: blubber-fey megalomaniacal murderous jerk. Heart-attack girlfriend: paranoid nosey prissy jerk. Maybe the future will be populated by unsympathetic narcissists like in this movie. Reading, say, slate.com, it kind of looks we might be headed that way. Hopefully they at least begin to dress nice and stop eating so many sustainable ho-hos so they don't hurt the eyes so much as they presently do.",1368662400,5,3162,4.87360594795539
27728,5,0767805712,"Isn't it wild when a movie seems to have the same idea you've had for years?

Look at parents in the world today. What competitive advantage will any parent
deny their child? What disadvantage will any parent willfully inflict on their
child?

Now imagine that every parent has the power to choose which part of their genes
are passed along at conception. How many people would walk away from that power?
How many people would choose less than the best for their child?

Gattaca is a blueprint for how genetic engineering could spread like wildfire
throughout a society.

What is more powerful in a society than parenthood? Government perhaps?

Consider the health care situation today. Is it sustainable? Now consider how
to change it. There is an old idea called ""the hoof and mouth cure."" It goes
like this:
 ""If there are no hooves, and there are no mouths, then there is no
 hoof-and-mouth disease.""
Would any government pass up the opportunity to eliminate health care problems
at conception? Imagine what could be done with the billions, the trillions, of
dollars saved.

This is just the starting premise for Gattaca. I don't like to write spoilers,
so let me just say that the above ""Utopia"" has all the flaws we'd expect from
our own experience. There are no perfect people in this movie, not even close.
Neither are the science nor the government perfect: they're just groups of
imperfect people.

Beyond that, Gattaca is a great example of a ""science fiction"" movie where the
science, and the special effects, dwindle into the background. This is not a
mega-budget CGE movie. Its a people movie.

Again, consider the degree of competitiveness today. Now imagine a world where
every person has the full power of reproductive science backing their individual
goals.

A more level playing field means that the small errors become more critical.
More focus is required. More self-monitoring. Less subconscious or impulsive
communication. Actions, even insults, must be limited to serve the person's
strategic goals. People have to be at their best, all the time. Social failure
is as fatal as work failure.

That's where the acting comes in. All the actors here are a part of this new
world, this new way of socializing and competing. There are no weak links in
the acting in this movie. The audience is left wondering about every character.
What is going thru this person's mind? These characters are all fully developed
individuals, and their words and actions, no matter how eloquent or direct, are
only part of that individual. The level of detail and nuance in the acting here
is deep.

Gattaca is one of the most thoughful movies I've ever seen.

Its high degree of competence echos and underscores its basic story, in a
powerful and unsettling way. Can any of this be avoided?",1368144000,7,2791,4.873150105708246

27735,5,0767805712,"Imagine a world where your future is determined by your genes. Your schools, your job, your social status are all determined by what genetic flaws you have.

Such is the world that we see in ""Gattaca,"" a scarily plausible sci-fi story that examines the implications of eugenics and genetic enhancement. Director Andrew Niccol thankfully never gets too preachy or ""uplifting"" -- instead he crafts a cleanly elegant story with a murder mystery as the catalyst, and the strong trinity Jude Law, Uma Thurman and Ethan Hawke.

Vincent Freeman (Hawke) is an ""invalid,"" conceived without eugenic technology. On the day he was born, it was predicted that he would be myopic, might be bipolar, and would probably die at thirty from a heart defect. Throughout his life, Vincent dreams of becoming an astronaut, but his genetic status dooms him to menial labor.

The solution: Vincent ""buys"" the identity and genetic profile of Jerome Eugene Morrow (Law), an Olympic swimmer who broke his back in a car crash. Vincent will pay Jerome, and Jerome will provide him with blood, urine, skin and hair samples.

With Jerome's help, Vincent is accepted into Gattaca Aerospace Corporation, and is chosen for a manned flight to Titan. But when one of the administrators is found murdered, the police find one of Vincent's eyelashes nearby. If they discover who Vincent truly is, he won't just lose his dream -- he'll be convicted of murder.

""Gattaca"" is a movie that addresses one of life's great questions -- does destiny determine how we live our lives, or do we decide our own fate? There are no easy answers, but it's always best to err on the side of ""we can make our own destiny"" -- and this movie is basically all about one man's quest to determine his own fate, DNA be damned.

None of the movies Andrew Niccol has made since ""Gattaca"" have even come close to this level of skill -- the movie is a slow, elegant winding of murder mystery and philosophical sci-fi. The plot quietly grows in tension as Vincent's life becomes more tangled up in lies and suspicion, with quietly powerful dialogue laced with dry humor (""I guess we can rule out suicide,"" comments a cop as they bag a bloodied keyboard).

And it's beautifully filmed. Everything is full of clean lines and cold light, with the occasional moment of symbolism -- note that the apartment that Eugene and Vincent share is centered around a giant DNA-style spiral staircase.

And the final puzzle pieces are the actors, who are all really good. Ethan Hawke gives a quietly powerful performance as a man who goes to desperate lengths to fulfill his dreams, and Uma Thurman has the right mix of icy reserve and sweetness as a ""valid"" woman who falls in love with the man rather than his DNA.

But the best performance is Jude Law. Jerome a truly tragic character, whose genetic perfection wasn't enough to keep disaster away -- he's proof that DNA can't make your life good or rewarding. Law plays him with a mixture of bitter wit and compassion, with perpetually shadowed eyes and a drink always in his hand. You may cheer for Vincent, but your heart will bleed for Jerome.

27738,5,0767805712,"Ten years after the movie they have gone and done it. We now know how the genetic make-up of human beings. Some Job descriptions even say without consideration of age, race, religion or genetics. We also have electric cars and wrist radios. This is no longer sci-fi; it is speculative fiction. Or at least it is speculative. Anyway I have a friend that had a back problem in his youth. They left some dye in him and it was spotted during a job interview physical for a desk job; you guessed it.

Anyway this is a spectacular film. The sound track helped support the movie. They did a good job of picking the actors. The characters were believable. Uma did not even have to show her Thurman's. Ethan did a convincing transformation and Jude was good enough that you almost thought the film was about him. The scenes were breath taking. I was most impressed with the sunrise on the solar panels and the swim competition.

Two points to look for on your second viewing are:
1. Several times the brothers compete physically and logically. Even with his handicapped origin Ethan Hawke"" Vincent Freeman"" surpasses his brother Loren Dean  ""Anton.""
2. Jude Law ""Jerome Eugene Morrow"" Was not without ambition. He was disappointed that his advantage was not advantageous enough for the gold and receives his gold thought the actions of Vincent.

Vincent who was conceived in the Rivera, as child of God (taking their chances) must compete in a world where all the negative genetic dispositions are usually removed as was his brother's case. Vincent is tagged for failure at birth. To overcome this social barrier and obtain his goal of going into space, he borrows the genes of an athlete gone astray. The director where he is working (GATTACA) is killed as the last obstacle to the mission. Will Vincent be found out? Irene (Uma Thurman) suspects the number one candidate for the space trip Jerome of the murder. She never suspects that he is really Vincent.

Bottom line is if you aren't genetically correct, the movie may scare you.

There are many different technical presentations of this film from original VHS to supper-bit to Blu-ray, each with its advantages and disadvantages. While this may have an effect on visuals and sound, it does not modify the story or acting.

However things start to go wrong when a murder takes place, and Detective Hugo (Alan Arkin) goes in pursuit of the perpetrator.  The film contains plenty of futuristic costumes and settings, but its subject-matter is set firmly in the present, concerning the importance of fulfilling one's dreams, even if it means exchanging aspects of one's identity for another.  Hawke turns in a convincing performance; but the end of the film we admire him for the way in which he triumphs over adversity to achieve his goal.

From an artistic standpoint it is great : the clean, crisp visuals, the very smart melding of futuristic with retro styling, the use of flashbacks and narration.  From a sci-fi standpoint it is equally great : A semi-dystopian near-future where genetic perfection is not only possible through unnatural selection, but is considered the standard.  But what I love more than anything about this movie is the message I take away from it, which can be true in any story, fiction, non-fiction, future, past, or present.  And that message is that persistence, desire, and a will to achieve can prevail against all odds.  I especially enjoy this message because it is so true.  Yes, we do all see the best looking, most athletic, most intelligent, most priviledged among us given a huge head start in life, but how many like ""Eugene"" do we see in life?  There are many, those with all the tools to succeed, but cannot use those tools, or choose not to use them because of a lack of desire or motivation.  Then there are the ""Vincents"" of the world.  Not particulary advanced in any way, and even with physical flaws that could easily hold them back.  But they have the desire, they have that fire burning inside them to accomplish their dreams.  In this movie the barrier just happens to be genetics, but in real life it can be many other factors...you may not be the smartest, or have the greatest physical prowess, or be the right race, the right ethnicity, or know the right people in high places, and so many of us in those positions resign to that fact and go about our so-so lives.

27827,4,0767805712,"Gattaca is set in the not-too-distant future.  Genetic modification has developed to such an extent that parents are now able to order custom babies, eliminating what would have been any physical liabilities and putting in their place brains, brawn and beauty (the movie derives its name from the letters found in DNA sequences: G, A, T and C).  This technological advance has created a two-tiered society of elites (called ""Valids"") and normal people (called ""In-Valids"").  The former get the best jobs and all the perks, while the latter muddle along as best they can.  The protagonist, Vincent, was born the normal way, but he refuses to settle for mediocrity.  He aspires to be in space.  And nothing is going to stop him.

This is not typical sci-fi fare.  Indeed, there is virtually no sci-fi action in it at all--it is all character-driven, with strong acting all around.  Director Andrew Niccol gives us a compelling story of human achievement.  The movie wrestles with the ethical implications of genetic modification, but it also shows that the spirit of man cannot be altered in the same way.  There is no gene for courage and determination.  You either have them or you don't.

Parental Advisory: The movie is rated PG-13 for brief violence, some language and some sexuality.  There are two scenes of implied intimacy between unmarried individuals, as well as three scenes involving obscured male nudity.  Characters smoke and drink.  A man nearly drowns twice.  A character commits suicide (mostly off camera).

The blu-ray transfer is good, both audio and visual--not the best I have ever seen, but perfectly funcational for this type of movie.  If you already have the DVD, it is a judgment call about whether you should upgrade or not.  If you really like this movie, then go for it.  Otherwise, the DVD will work just fine.

I recommend Gattaca as an interesting piece of speculation about where we might be going as a society, and the ethical implications associated with genetic modification.  If you are looking for something a little more high tech and action-oriented, like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Island-Blu-ray/dp/B000RJEHK8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Island [Blu-ray</a>], then you will be disappointed.

27847,5,0767805712,"I remember when I first saw `Gattaca'.  I wasn't really sure what to expect, but I remember quite vividly being completely blown away.  It just moved me in ways I wasn't expecting, and the dense originality was such a breath of fresh air.  I was taken away to this place I didn't know existed, and that is a rarity with this genre that still seems to bent on recreating other interpretations of the same.  It's rare to find a science fiction film that has its own identity, and not one ripped from the souls of another.

In `Gattaca', the world has a pretty terrifying idea of what constitutes humanity and equality.  In this future world (not so distant), genetic manipulation is used heavily to influence the future of our offspring.  Classified as either `Valids' (those who have been genetically manipulated to be superior humans) or `In-Valids' (those born naturally), people are separated out and given certain privileges based on their status.  For Vincent, those privileges are not forthcoming because he was born naturally and thus is deemed inferior.  He has poor eyesight and a few other conditions that genetic manipulation could have eliminated and so his dreams of space travel are nothing more than mere dreams since he is unqualified to actually reach for them.  Vincent sees a way to reach his goals with the help of Jerome, a `Valid' who has suffered an accident and thus is crippled.  Offering his services (in the most complex of ways), Jerome essentially hands over to Vincent his `Valid-ness' and helps Vincent secure a position at Gattaca, a NASA of sorts that will groom Vincent for space travel.

But all one has to do is yank the string and this whole faade could unravel before Vincent's very eyes.

This film is so incredibly intricate and well thought out that I'm astounded every time I watch it.  It is also a technical achievement, for everything from the sets to the costumes to that wonderful score are all especially impressive; and then you have Jude Law's heartbreaking performance that is so sincere and commanding and unforgettable.  I wish that more movies were made with this intense interest in storytelling, in crafting something profound and unique and beautifully grounded.

27849,5,0767805712,"No movie that I've seen in the last quarter century haunts me quite like Gattaca. I love this movie to the point where it actually brings me to tears just by thinking about it sometimes. Out of curiosity, I had to check out the 1- and 2-star reviews.

The details of the plot have been well-covered by other reviews, so I won't go into that here. There is a consistent theme I see in the reviews: people who rate Gattaca low are focused on the discriminatory society portrayed in the film. People who rate Gattaca high are more interested in how Vincent busts his ass to fight for the life he wants to lead in spite of that society.

I'm solidly in the second camp. This movie is about making your own life. This movie is about never giving up. This movie is about sacrificing and working hard for what matters to you. This is a movie about how expectations can be wrong, about how we're more than our genes, about entitlement and despair, about how you'll take that one chance in a thousand when it's your dream on the line. This is what the 5-star reviewers see in the film. The 1-stars just see it as a film about discrimination and get bored.",1339200000,4,1146,4.350467289719626

27851,5,0767805712,"I just discovered this movie and I was very, very impressed. I simply can not understand why did ""Gattaca"" slipped under the radar when it was released in 1998. The 90s were not a good time for SF cinema - for a long time I considered that only three SF movies made between 1991 and 2000 were really good: ""Starship Troopers"", ""12 Monkeys"" and ""Strange days"". Well since yesterday it is official - make it four!

When watching this movie I had the impression to make a comeback to the great age of SF, which were the 70s, with ""Soylent Green"", ""Planet of Apes"", ""Alien"", ""Westworld"", ""Andromeda Strain"", ""A clockwork orange"", ""Close encounters of the Third kind"", ""Star Wars"", etc., a blessed time in which even ""Star Trek"" movies could be great (just think about the first one, ""Star Trek: the Motion Picture"" which opened in 1979). Making this time travel back was a really great experience.

I like spectacular, fast paced movies and I am not really a great intellectual - but when a movie is REALLY intelligent and well done, sometimes I like them even better. And ""Gattaca"" is an exceptionally well thought, well conceived, well directed, well paced, well balanced and VERY well interpreted movie. It is amazing how much you can do with a modest budget if you have a brilliant scenario and a good idea how to use it, when you keep a good control over your movie and when you hire half a dozen of really excellent actors, who clearly enjoy playing much more than ""being a star"". The director, Andrew Niccol, managed to do all of it very well (oh, why, but why, couldn't he direct the ""Terminal"" rather than only writing the scenario).

Ethan Hawke, Jude Law and Uma Thurman gave everything they could in this movie and the result is impressive. Four other actors seconded them impressively well: Gore Vidal (yes, the writer Gore Vidal, in one of his very unfrequent appearances on the silver screen), Ernest Borgnine, one of the few survivors of Golden Age of Hollywood who is still standing, Loren Dean (an actor who for the moment didn't really make a great career, which I find a pity after watching this movie) and finally Alan Arkin, who long time ago played Yossarian in ""Catch 22"" and who returns here (I am CERTAIN it was made on purpose) as a REALLY smart and tenacious cop.

I am not going to say anything on the movie itself - no spoilers. Let's just say that this is a tale about a horribly unfair society in which a member of discriminated and opressed minority will challenge the fundamental rules which govern this world. It is not gonna be easy and is gonna hurt... But you will have great time watching it.",1336435200,,2627,4.594882729211087
27852,5,0767805712,"One of the greatest sleeper Sy-Fi movies, and certainly one of the most provocative is Gattaca.  The concept of genetic manipulation, while a thought back when this movie was made; is now more of a realization in our current society.  This movie does a wonderful job of exposing discrimination by the use of what is determined by your genes.  Furthermore, it also brings out the fear of altering ones genetic make-up to that of what parents ""want"" from their selected child.  Hawke is brilliant in the role...a very underrated actor whom I feel has never received his full due.  Law, in his first film role shows what he is and will be made of. Thurman handles her role with grace and elegance.  The remaining cast of well knowns are extraordinary.  Cinematography and ""feel"" of the film is almost a color version of ""film noir"".  even if you are not found of science fiction, this film is so well do, and so socially on target, it will mesmerize.  Only issue is that I have the Blu-Ray, which is 5.1 True HD sound.  Sony Pictures has not done a great job of sound quality...by that I mean you have to turn the volume up extremely loud to hear the movie.  Other True HD movies I have, even by Sony, this is not an issue.  This is the one flaw with the Blu-Ray.  It shold be noted the Blu-Ray does contain all the extras of the Deluxe Edition.

27853,5,0767805712,"""I am here to tell you that it is possible, that it IS possible"". --Vincent

I have watched this movie 3 times since its box office disappointing release 15 years ago.

I am now convinced this is one of the greatest films of all time. I don't say that lightly. I watch a LOT of old films and watched most of Roger Ebert's top 100 films of all time. In my opinion, this movie belongs in that list.

What makes a film great? To me, a greatness of a film is measured similar to a great music. A great music can be enjoyable, visceral, fascinating even after repeated hearings and many years of absence. This movie has that quality to me. Even though I knew its plot and its ending, the movie kept me fascinated and drawn into the characters unlike most films.

Made with shoe-string budget and awful marketing (it was marketed as an Orwellian futuristic film which doesn't do it justice), the movie is about the triumph of the human spirit and how everything becomes possible once we commit our heart and soul with ruthless determination. ""You want to do how I did it? I never saved anything for the swim back"". Committment, dedication, determination, belief...everything IS possible.

The movie, however, is mindful that no one achieves success alone. Why would anyone help someone to misrepresent himself so he can achieve his dreams? Vincent is helped by Jerome (genetically superior being), Irene (his love interest), and a doctor (who tests urine samples). Even Vincent's nemsis (Anton) finally gets out of his way once he understands the power of Vincent's heart and determination. I believe people help Vincent because, in the end, no one really cares what advantages one is born with. We care far more about the human side of individuals. Vincent is someone we all can admire, and his positive qualities can't be bought or predetermined with genetic disposition. When we encounter such individuals, we are sometimes even willing to sacrifice our self-interest for them.

This films hits all cylinders, including all the emotions (love, betrayal, desire to win, hope, jealousy). I cried in couple of moving scenes. In my humble opinion, this film's greatness will be appreciated and validated with the passage of time.",1334448000,,2222,4.865079365079365
27854,1,0767805712,"I was thoroughly enjoying this film until the last five minutes. No spoilers, but the end undermined the entire theme that I thought was building throughout. The protagonist Vincent does not create a new system and prove this draconian genetic world wrong. He instead finds a way to simply get ahead within the system. I compare this to Bradbury's classic work, Fahrenheit 451, that depicts a similar draconian, oppressive world, but gives us an entirely different ending. I will not even discuss the message the character of Eugene and his end sends to disabled people...",1334188800,4,572,5.031578947368421
27875,4,0767805712,"In the near future, humanity has mastered his own genetic code. So thorough is this knowledge, in fact, that the majority of modern conceptions are performed in a petri dish, on an embryo with the lowest number of negative hereditary traits. Against the backdrop of this fanatically eugenic-conscious future, discrimination has reached new levels, as jobs and relationships are won and lost with a simple blood sample and naturally conceived children are second-rate citizens. It seems like there's always a persistent, rebellious figure when confronted with such an oppressive system, and in Gattaca's case that role is filled by Ethan Hawke as the physically modest, daydreaming genius Vincent. The bevy of hoops Hawke jumps through to maintain the illusion that he's a top-tier genetic example make up most of the film's substance, with an ongoing murder investigation pressing the matter in a few hairy new directions. Somewhere along the way Vincent stumbles into a hollow, affection-free relationship with Uma Thurman that seems to spawn more from boredom than passion. Quite slow and methodical in nature, it's still a bright rumination on a future that already seems within grasp. Could have used a more flavorful tone, and the cast is almost universally glazed-over and dry.",1332460800,,1283,5.294117647058823

First of for anyone who watches or reads a lot of science fiction will know that the premise has been done before so going into this movie one would hope for some sort of creative twists or something to differentiae this work from all of the others. The problem was there were none, and not only was there nothing different the movie never even pretended to try. This made the film so highly formulaic and predictable that it became painfully boring to finish. In fact the only reason I did finish it was to see if I was wrong -would they do something that surprised me and in the end the answer was a boring no.

Let be honest if you are a science fiction fan did any of this take you by surprise or did you expect it.

Vincent was going to succeed? Totally expected
Irene was going to be his love interest? Saw that coming a mile away
Irene was genetically defective? Yawn
Irene would end up covering for Vincent? Of course
Antonio would come back in the picture and try to foil Vincent's goal? My dog saw that one coming
There would be the inevitable second swimming scene? Boring
Director Josef was the murderer? Predictable

I have to say that there were some scenes that at times seemed too ""ridiculous"" in a sense that It was hard to believe. Spoiler alert!  like when the guy walked around without anyone noticing it was him they were looking for even though his picture was everywhere). It was also hard to believe that in those days with such technology Cops were not able to locate the guy on the wheelchair  you would think that in the future police will be able to track anyone anywhere.)It was also crazy the lack of technology. Having said this, I have to confess that I have realized that those things are not relevant in the purpose of the movie . I mean sure they could have done better things but let us not forget this movie came out in 1999  i believe). So it's understandable that ""technology "" was not shown on a higher level. At the same time those things I just explained, Do not interfere with the great message of this gem. I really love this movie , I love the fact that the main character is someone with a lot of disadvantages in his life yet he manages to become even better than those who had it easier.

This premise that we will soon be able to dictate our genes and hence will be able to discriminate on genes was also scary as it is now a clear a present possibility as well.  The deleted scene which showed how using this criteria to decide who gets born and who doesn't would have deprived us of Abraham Lincoln, Emily Dickinson, Albert Einstein etc was also very powerful and really should have been left in the original film.  This was also the first film that introduced me to Jude Law and it showed me just how good an actor he was even way back then.  Being a fan of noir I couldn't help but feel its influence on this film as well.  This blu-ray version is a real treat for fans as it looks great in 1080p and sounds great in Dolby TrueHD 5.1.

Set against a science fiction backdrop (not so far into the future), we see that, no matter how advanced science are or will become, we will always be up against Identity Thieves who cannot or will not care about other human beings.

In this movie we see how a so-called Invalid misuses his intelligence to achieve his dream to go into space where he would knowingly endanger the mission, not to mention the lives of all the other men on the ship.

We get an insight into the life of an identity thieve when we see how this Invalid spends his days:

Without ANY friends, he spends all his energy to mislead people.

He lives a life of zero compassion to everyone around him, not even his brother can stop him, while he knows that because of him sharing DNA with his brother, that his actions will eventually lead to the downfall of his brother. (This was removed from the final version of the movie.)

Indeed, a very disturbing movie, which paints a bleak picture of our (immediate) future, and which stops short of saying what the silent majority already knows:

Ethan did have some help along the way, but his determination and almost obsession conquered the odds.  Sure some of the acting was a little stiff at times, but the story line required it.  Look at the people who strive for perfection in our world today.  Don't they seem a little strange and different from so called normal human behavior? We have those in our society now who try to get certain DNA donors with high potentials of being a superior human child in their families.

In Ethan's world, perfection was the norm and others were outcast. Sort of the have and have nots society.  Sounds like our world with the prejudice that presents itself. Ethan just wanted a chance, which he got, though sacrificing alot along the way.  Uma did okay for her part and Jude Law was great as a spoiled cripple living his dream in Ethan.

Oh but it's so much worse than both of them put together and mixed around. This is Gattaca. I mean the name should put you off immediately. Gattaca? Seriously? Is this a new pokemon figure...eww. Anyway, I had to watch this movie in class...I'd rather take a test. It's one of those modern movies that makes you really nervous and anxious even though you were having a perfectly carefree day before and would have continued that way if you weren't forced to be ""entertained."" You know what I mean--the dramatic music in every bloody scene...the huge, bare interiors of buildings with only shiny white walls and no furniture whatsoever...no, I take that back...maybe a simple metal chair in the middle. And then they have that close up on disgusting things like blood and needles. The characters, however glamorous themselves, can not save the movie due to the script. It reminds me of cardboard. My monotoned professor could write a more engaging script that was less predictable. Every thing is eeked out of proportion. There is never one relaxing moment. Even when the two love interests are strolling through this field of shiny futuristic I don't even know what's, and they  are ""connecting"" by having long, ""original"", and ""inspiring"" drawn out back and forths like (this is a rendition):
girl: I've got so many things wrong with me....""(long pause)
boy: ..no you don't...(another long pause)...no you don't...(looks up and squints into the sun, mouth slightly open, and turns to the girl moving his head at 1 cm per second looking more like he will kill her than love her)...no you don't..."" -fade out very slowly into next scene...All of this is bound together by unmelodious frantic tinkly themes that are always hinting that multiple homicides are about to be committed.

Alright, alright. I will now give you the plot overview because I know some mean person will say: ""you didn't even review it! Gosh! I'm going to give you a bad rating."" Well, here you are: So, there is this dude named...oh I forget but it's not important. He's a dude. That's all you have to know. He lives in this ""very realistic"" time that will ""most definitely"" be reality in twenty or so years when there is a class system based on genetics. This means if you have a heart defect, you are going to be a servant all your life basically while those who are physically and genetically perfect rule over you...having all the high positions etc. Wow...so inspiring. Sorry, I just hate science fiction. I find it tedious and just stupid. But, this is stupid on all levels. So the great drama of this tale is that our dude has a heart problem but dreams of going to space of course...and so he decides to pretend to be a healthy dude so he can go. (There are all these genetic tests in the building where he wants to work such as blood tests.) Anyway, to do this, he gets this other dude to give him his blood which he will use in place of his own and does all this stuff so that very little of his own DNA will be left there and painstakingly leaves the other dude's fingernails etc at work because this dude is valid. And of course, there is the intense drama that our dude will be found out. Bla bla. And through all of this intense stuff, there is the girl...the girl with the mystery. The chemistry between them is so intense, so relatable, so honest, and so real it's like...it's like...oh I know, you know when you go to the store really late at night and you think the store is completely deserted until you realize that there's this creepy guy there in the isle who is staring at you as you reach for the peanut butter and all you think in your head is: why the hell does it have to me? and how the hell can I get out of here alive? ....that's what it's like.

I won't summarize the plot to you here since there are plenty of reviews and websites that can do it for you better than I can.

27937,4,0767805712,"Well, this movie was an experience!  Just a short commentary.  Gattaca punches home a curious ""What If.""  What if science got to a point where genetic engineering was perfected to where a parent could choose any trait, either sex, and practically guarantee a near-perfect human being with excellent odds at success?

And even with the genetic make-up totally in his/her favor, could said person achieve his goals?  Can you genetically engineer a spirit, a will and an intention to succeed?

Vincent's parents decided to have him as a ""natural"" birth, i.e. without genetic prompting.  The hospital took a blood sample from his heel at the tender age of 10 minutes old (practically!) and got a sterile computer read-out of the chances of heart failure, life expectancy and so on.

The parents tried again, this time conceiving Anton, who was a product of genetics but the parents decided they wanted to keep a few things ""natural.""  Fascinating.

The movie is a story about conflict between one's genetic code and one's desires to overcome the obstacles that an immorally bankrupt society can throw in our paths.

The proof that this is true is when Anton, the genetically superior brother, yet loses swimming matches with his brother.  His brother has the will and the drive.

Through a ""handler"", Vincent takes the genetic material of ""Jerome"" and in fact becomes Jerome.  He sneaks in blood samples, straps urine bags to his leg and wears contacts as Jerome would.  Jerome is genetically superior yet has no real drive or real dreams and though the genetic clock is in his favor, ""always made second place.""  Jerome is locked in a wheelchair as the result of an attempted suicide and his only lot in life is to supply Vincent with enough blood and urine samples to maintain the pretense of Vincent being Jerome.  Gattaca does daily genetic testing, so the deception must be perfect.

Uma Thurman plays a woman who works at Gattaca, a facility that flies a dozen or so flights into space.  Jerome (aka Vincent) fools her for some time but when she discovers his secret, she can relate and protects him.  The whole thing here is quite tender but the acting is somewhat forced.

In the middle of all this, Jerome (Vincent) is nearly found out several times during a police investigation of a murder that occurs at Gattaca.  Will he be found out?  Is his will so strong and his goal so pure (getting to Titan, a Saturnian moon), that he can even overcome the watchful detectives and even his brother Anton (who makes a surprise appearance)?

The film may take another couple of watchings since its commentary on the human condition and where society is going is quite fascinating and important to understand.

Oh, cool Ernest Borgnine appearance as the head janitor and former boss of Vincent.  Priceless acting from a Hollywood veteran actor!

Word play:  Jerome = Genome?  Eugene = Eugenics?  Curious.

The movie is a bit uneven at times, but overall has quite the ""1984"" message to tell in such an original fashion.

Its somewhat typical - conventional in that the topic of human genetic engineering is placed in the context of a love story, which ordinarily would not interest me in the least bit.

But, it is revelatory in its dealing with the topic of human genetic engineering, done by humans, by parents for the sake of their children's best interests, (they suppose), and how our society might change in that context.

Its not a utopia, it's a dystopia, with ramifications well worth thinking over.

Once unleashed, and we are on the precipice of that, can the genie of genetic engineering be put back in the bottle?

And if human parents are prohibited from it, will anything stop our despotic covert governments from genetic engineering, if more power for them, better human weapons, can be made and controlled, I do not think so.

This is a vast topic, the movie series, Aliens, the whistle-blower Dan Burisch who says some reported alien UFO's such as Roswell, Greys/abductions were actually future versions of mankind coming back to gather genetic material to correct their own broken evolutionary path, Sitchin re: extraterrestrial intervention in mankind's past, the NAZI's - Rockefeller in the US and ""eugenics"", Dr Mary's Monkey (engineered bio weapons), again, too many instances to cite.

After all, it's not as bad as genital herpes, swallowing cat piss, or watching a Michael Bay flick.  But as far as genius sci-fi goes, this is inferior, an imposter, an in-valid.

Gattaca does have an excellent premise, and has garnered quite a cult following.  Manipulating genetics to form the perfect human being is an intriguing concept.  Utilizing Science to eliminate birth defects and create a person less susceptible to diseases or illnesses is a possibility that many might consider justifiable.  On the other hand, tampering with nature is bound to have its repurcussions.

My main problem with this story is the fact it tries to pound one element into your head over and over again and never offers much of anything else.  A man born all-naturale wants to have the same priviledges as his genetic superiors.  For the first half, it worked admirably.  Then it started to get pretty dang stagnant.  Still it kept riding this one-trick pony till the cows came home.  Not sure what that means really, except I was annoyed and bored to freakin tears.

Ethan Hawke does a decent job.  But how many fingerprint id's, blood samples, and heart tests can a man fake?  Then they had his face plastered EVERYWHERE, and nobody could make the connection he was a murder suspect?  PLEASE!!!!  I don't care how blind your ego makes you, it is completely obvious!

Plus the differences between the valids &n in-valids were blown way outta proportion.  Granted, he shouldn't be able to run as fast or swim as far.  But he can't cross the freakin street?  This movie might be making a statement how ridiculous prejudices are, which does of course carry some merit.  But I felt this was way too heavy-handed.

And possibly one of the worst scenes I can recall off the top of my head--the party date with Uma.  She realizes he is a murder suspect and has been deceiving her, watches him beat down some cop, forces her to run off with him, and then they make love under a gorgeous starlit sky.  Atrocious!

Another thing I didn't care for--this had relatively few cool futuristic gadgets and gizmos.  The cars looked retro, but they made a cool humming sound as they sped past.  The cops didn't have any laser guns or sweet tracking devices.  Nobody had cell phones.  No teleportation tubes with dialethium crystals or electronic floatation devices?  Nothing really.  Bummer.

Anyway, I'm sorry.  I'm rambling.  But seriously, I don't put this anywhere close to the elite sci-fi masterpieces.  In fact, it is one of my least favorites of the genre.",1254873600,16,2655,4.753846153846154

But if mainstream Hollywood's penchant for talking down to the audience makes you clinch your teeth, pass it up and get back with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blade-Runner/dp/B000UD0ESA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blade Runner</a>&nbsp;instead.

The premise of ""Gattaca"" is a future utopia where humans are able to be genetically engineered.  This is to say, that parents can shop for their offspring's biological traits as one would select features on a custom-designed automobile.  Innocent enough according to most people, but those of us who think these things through know where that will inevitably lead.  This is a story about that inevitability.  Ethan Hawke plays an abused minority in the film; he was born naturally through sexual intercourse the way we all were.  This makes Vincent what is referred to as an ""Invalid"".  ""Valids"" are those who had their makeup determined for the strongest and most genetically superior traits.  How can a random smattering of parents' DNA with all of the intrinsic flaws compete?  It can't.  Hawke's character is not only gnerally physically inferior, but he was born with a heart defect that all but insured he wouldn't live to see 30.  But he did.  Being a stubborn underdog we can all root for,  he is bound and determined to realize his dream of being an astronaut.  But given that every Valid on the planet is physically better qualified, people like him are only allowed to perform menial labor.  Legalized worldwide apartheid with no constitutionally unsound ramifications.  The idea bears a striking resemblance to some of the practices of Communist.  It's a simple system of picking the best people for the job so technically it's not discrimination.  No morality involved.  At all.  Hitler's vision of a Master Race is just around the corner.

Great idea for a film, no?  Sadly, I found the execution lacking and the film had trouble keeping my attention once the premise was established.  Shots of Vincent gazing longingly at the sky as rockets take off for outer space while he mops the floor are almost humorous to a cynical bastard like myself who gets his jollies blowing spitballs at such storytelling practices.  The backstory where Vincent's younger brother (a Valid; the parents didn't want to make the same mistake twice) lords his superiority over him and then loses in a swimming contest is reiterated over the course of the film again and again in such a manner that I felt that the filmmaker was treating me like an idiot.  Yeah!  I get it!  We don't like the super-people so we revel in the guy who is just like us winning.  No need to show us four more times!  I about turned the film off when his ability to outdistance his physically more able sibling is explained by Vincent by saying he never saved anything for the swim back.  But his brother never made it to the swim out so what was he saving exactly?  So all that does is give the people a line that makes no sense to cheer about.  ""Yeah, you fascist jerk!  He didn't save anything for the swim back except that he not only had enough to swim back, but he carried your sorry behind with him so obviously he did save something...  more then you in fact since you were the one drowning. Wait, what'd he say again?""  Things like that eat at the inside of my brain and make me angry that the writers and director can't even think through their own story for our benefit.  They just assumed we'd be too dumb to care.  This is not&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Transformers/dp/B000VR0570/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Transformers</a>, damn it!  If you're going to make a cerebral film with no action at all, get your stuff straight!

The vast majority of the running time is spent watching Vincent cover his genetic tracks as he enacts a plan to join a space mission by posing as a Valid by borrowing the identity of a crippled athlete.  He has urine samples, nail clippings, hair, fake ID, and everything else to pass the constant genetic screenings.  The screenings and the fervency of those involved seem to indicate that the innocent ""best person for the job"" ideology has evolved into outright racism.  Along the way, our everyman courts a Valid played by Uma Thurman, who looks extremely genetically superior in this.  Seeing Vincent dust his skin dust off of his keyboard and enact successively more complex plans to bypass the system got old to me quickly.  I didn't much care about him nailing a hot Valid chick either. After a while, I just wanted the movie to be over already.  we all knew how it was going to end from the second he looked up at that rocket.  The rest was filler.  Very sappy filler.

As far as using film for a device to explain a complex subject such as genetic tampering, ""Gattaca"" is a triumph.  But seeing that I already was well aware of the social ramifications of such a practice, I have to judge it based on how the story affected me personally.  It didn't.  The devices were hackneyed, the characters were boring, there was no visual feast to pull it out of the fire.  As nice as it is to think that no matter what, the way we do things is always the best, the fact is that once we open that Pandora's Box, Invalids will be exactly that.  Invalid.  It's always fun to see David beat Goliath, but a more realistic take would have been appreciated.  Take&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/District-9/dp/B0021L8US0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">District 9</a>, for example.  When the underclass was abused and treated as animals, that's practically what they became.  Seeing something like that mirroring the real-life hardships of apartheid would have been much more convincing then the schmaltzy approach taken here.

27966,5,0767805712,"A little masterpiece of science-fiction from and about the time when everything will be governed by the genome of every individual. You will be identified through it, you will be followed from birth to grave by it. Good morning Vietnam, good morning genome-drome, genoism. You will be nothing but a complex DNA identity.

Too complex to memorize, but any machine can memorize even more complex things and recognize them. But here we have several couples of interest and rivalry. A child born naturally and whose fate is doomed to be deemed bad and it is supposed to be bad, and life expectancy is as low as some odd 30 years. On the other side his brother was genetically correct and perfect.

Unluckily the former has a dream and the latter has none. The former is motivated to do what only the genetic elite can do, and he is not. The latter is motivated to do nothing except be a bureaucrat that will trace out all the ""fakes"", the non-genetically perfect who are trying to go through nevertheless, frauds in other words, like his own brother. The latter will find a way to go through the genetic selection by assuming the identity of a genetically perfect man who suffered a severe accident and cannot be anything any more.

That is hard work, but that is possible because they are only dealing with machines, as long as they are dealing with machines. But there comes a time, and it is a lot earlier in the story than you may think, that one will trace the fraud but will say nothing because he has a personal reason to see if the fraud will go through and that the fraud will go through.

Remember: it is a Mark Twain trick: a right handed man normally holds his [...] with his right hand when he urinates, and a left handed man does the reverse.  The details of the end are not interesting here. One thing is interesting though. If the future world decides to become genetically correct we are going to cheat a lot because success anywhere depends on only one thing: motivation, first and foremost, and intellectual and even physical qualifications are only second to that motivation.

A small prodigious marvel to be seen by anyone who believes man is better and more important than science which is only an extension of man's mental and nervous system, not a replacement, a prosthesis.

I have only two complaints:

1- The movie could be longer. This is more of a good thing, because it means that I would like to see more of it. It really was interesting.

2- It sort of seems that the budget wasn't very big for the movie. If this movie was ever remade, the only thing I think they should do differently is make it even more futuristic. The cars look like regular cars, in fact even older, but they just make a humming noise to sound like they are advanced. Didn't like that detail. Other aspects of the movie are a little low budget.

I know I should be looking into the meaning of the movie instead of the flashiness (or lack there off) but I'm just saying it would have been 5 out of 5 stars if they followed those two points.

You and your wife decide to have a child - you go and get your DNA mixed, you remove all of the bad traits like poor eyesight, short height, autism, heart disease propensity, etc and you wind up with your perfect child, 10 fingers, 10 toes, 180 IQ, the heart of a racehorse, etc.  These children are the best that humanity can be and the best that two parents can produce.  In the future upper middle class children and upper class children are almost entirely conceived in this engineered fashion and although discrimination based on eugenics is illegal, it is commonly practiced in this future with those who are not born in the genetically engineered fashion being relegated to inferior jobs.

The movie is about two brothers, one who was brought into the world in this accepted fashion and a second who was conceived in the traditional way (though s*x) and the love of their parents.  Almost immediately after birth, the parents notice that their engineered son is superior in so many ways to their other son but their god-child has an indomitable spirit so much so that he crawls his way through all obstacles and and makes some of the greatest sacrifices imaginable for the shot at being a member of a prestigious astronaut corps.

In this story Jude Law, a privilaged rich guy who becomes incapacitated overseas unbeknownst to the authorities sells his identity to Ethan Hawke in order for Jude to continue his rich lifestyle while Ethan works at the astronaut corporation. In the story Jude's genetics said he would be the best swimmer in the world but only earns a silver medal and overall Jude is the epitome of that guy whose pedigree says he should be #1 at everything but isn't - probably because he rests too much on that pedigree.

The movie has a murder mystery build into it to keep things interesting as Ethan tries to avoid detection as an In-Valid while still keeping himself as the selectee for the Saturn Mission which he has been selected for.

I won't kid you, this movie is drama.  Its fairly slow paced but in a deep way that you can keep up with. The Acting by Ethan Hawke, Uma Thurman, Jude Law, Loren Dean, and Gore Vidal are impressive and first rate.

Overall, the movie is a story about how the human soul and spirit cannot be quantified into the code of DNA and how we as humanity are more.

27972,5,0767805712,"When 'Gattaca' was released in '97, it really flew under the radar, thanks in part to a certain big sinking ship. I've known about about the film since its release but never saw it until about a year ago. Needless to say, I was very impressed. How could a film with such a talented cast, a brilliant story, incredible direction just fade out and not connect with audiences?

'Gattaca' is a the story of Vincent (Hawke), a young man who was conceived by natural birth, and his determination to fight back in a world where genetic engineering is the norm, where employment solely rests on how you were born. Vincent decides to take the identity of genetically engineered man, Jerome (Law), an athlete who, unknown by the public, suffered an accident that left him paralyzed. Vincent is now Jerome and is working at Gattaca so that he will fulfill his dreams and be launched into space. However, things take an unexpected turn when a man is murdered at Gattaca and the police arrive to investigate. While cleaning up the scene, a single eye lash from Jerome/Vincent is found, and the police now suspect the murder was caused by him, as Vincent is an ""in-valid.""

While the story has an obvious sci-fi thriller quality to it, one can see that despite being lumped into the genre, it's first a human-drama with many intriguing and challenging questions, which at this day and age seems shockingly relevant. It's a story about the triumph of the human spirit, what its capable of and what it can ultimately achieve.

Everything about 'Gattaca,' technically, is top-notch. Despite having a modest budget, the filmmakers have creatively created a utopia with minimal CGI effects. All set locations are simply dressed up or down to get the effect of a not to distant future, and it works wonderfully.

Andrew Niccol's script and direction is absolutely brilliant and should be leave the viewer believing he's made one of the finest sci-films of all time. It is truly a classic.

Director Andrew Niccol paints the picture of a future where humans are valued for little more than their DNA structures. Prospective employees must give blood samples as part of their initial interview process, allowing employers to unfairly discriminate against applicants with undesireable DNA structures (poor health, balding, heart problems, etc.).

27981,5,0767805712,"Gattaca really makes you wonder about the moral and ethical consequences of genetic engineering, and the risks of mankind playing God. This is science fiction at its best. In a nutshell, Gattaca is the modern version of Aldous Huxley's science fiction classic novel&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Brave-New-World/dp/0586044345/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Brave New World</a>&nbsp;(1932).

As usual, not every great movie is a box office hit, and Gattaca actually went unnoticed for many sci-fi fans. Why? The film's atmosphere is that of a slow pace dystopia, quite similar to the classic novel&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fahrenheit-451/dp/B000087F6L/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fahrenheit 451</a>. Therefore, the movie lacks many of the sophisticated modern special effects we are used to, up to the extreme of astronauts traveling to outer space in full business suits. Also, worth noticing is the great performance by the leading and renowned actors Ethan Hawke, Uma Thurman, and Jude Law. Deliberately the movie does not have any flamboyant SFX because its simplicity is part of the attractive. It is high tech against the human spirit!

I do highly recommend this movie, whether or not you are a science fiction fan.

Demonstrating that crime is always a corollary of social injustice the movie has Vincent obviously managing to save enough from his cleaner's wage to take advantage of the black market in false identities and we meet Jude Law, the antithesis of Vincent in many ways: the golden boy made bad. They `swap' identities and Vincent becomes the `perfect' Jerome and begins to take pleasure in all the fruits that perfect specimens, or `valids' enjoy as part of their birthright, including those provided by off-screen wife, Uma Thurman in the person of the perfectly lovely Irene. He gets accepted for flight crew training at Gattaca and loses no opportunity to gaze at the stars his soon to be destination if all goes well!

Vincent encounters his brother again, in the form of the senior investigating officer, when a member of Gattaca's senior people gets his perfect cranium clobbered and all of its `employees' become subject to interrogation thereby threatening Vincent's dream.

This is an unusually thoughtful Sci-Fi film which asks all of the usual, who are we, where are we going type questions about human existence and forces an examination of the current preoccupation with genetic engineering, celebrity, `extreme makeover' shows and the type of air-headed celeb mags such as Hello that push the air-brushed perfection to which we are all supposed to aspire. But it's also a masterpiece of film making with superb art direction, the welcome presence of such Hollywood veterans as Alan Arkin and Ernest Borgnine, an intelligent script by director Andrew Niccol and a hauntingly beautiful Michael Nyman score. As such it ranks alongside Blade Runner as an entry into the pantheon of late twentieth century masterworks of Sci-Fi film.",1211500800,,2803,5.038793103448276

Beyond the thought-provoking concepts regarding the future opportunities and problems surrounding genetics, Gattaca's greatest power may be its ability to inspire. Many people will come away from this film with the feeling that they really can make a good run at their dreams, no matter their background or supposed limitations.

27996,5,0767805712,"I must admit that this movie did not appeal to me when it was first released in theaters.  However, many years ago, I rented it and was captivated by the story.  Since then I've had to make do with the underwhelming DVD edition.  If you are looking for a lot of action, then this movie is probably not for you.  What it does offer is a fantastic story with a cast that gives top notch performances.  If you already own the DVD, and are not sure if this one is worth the upgrade, believe me the Blu-ray edition blows the old DVD out of the water.  The sound and picture are near perfection.  The colors on the DVD version appear washed out compared to the high def color palette.  While this movie won't give your surround system a major workout, it does provide very clear ambient surround effects.  The special features include two new short documentaries on the making of the film.  While these don't compare to some of the extras offered on other titles, they are very informative and a welcome addition to the previous version.  My one fault would be that it would have been great to have at least a good commentary track, or even a picture in picture feature.  But, because I feared that this movie would never get the treatment it so rightly deserves, I would still highly suggest you add this title to your Blu-ray collection.",1207958400,39,1333,4.462809917355372
27997,5,0767805712,"Simply stated, this is one of the most moving and intellectually stimulating movies of recent years.  The Blu-Ray release is nothing short of spectacular.

Ethan Hawke, Uma Thurman, and Jude Law can all make a case for this being their greatest artistic achievement. Each actor seems to cease being themselves and immerse themselves into the role with a completeness that I have rarely witnessed on screen.  As one begins to watch even the first scenes, you are drawn into Ethan Hawke's character and cannot help but become emotionally attached.

The cinematography is breathtaking.  The use of color as a provacative element is masterful.  The score is wonderful, a perfect accompaniment to the theme.

Also, the sci-fi element focuses on realistic near future themes.  People do NOT fly strange cars and go to strangely shaped buildings...instead there is a realistic element that enables the viewer to enjoy the film for what it is, and not be distracted with pointless sci-fi stereotypes.  The issue of genetic manipulation is one that has been brought to attention lately and this film manages to show both sides of the issue without appearing to be a piece of propaganda.  The Valids as they are called have all of the benefits of the genetic manipulation while the Invalids do not.  The interesting premise here is that even an Invalid can rise above and beyond what his or her capabilities 'should' be.  Also a Valid may still resort to the basic human instincts and actions despite all coding in the opposite direction.  An amazing portrayal of what might be possible and very real in the near future.

I believe that this film should be the cornerstone of any Blu-Ray collection and cannot recommend it highly enough.  Definately in my top 5 of all time!",1207267200,,1764,4.912162162162162

Video quality is top notch in every single scene.  This movie has a subtle color palate that casts a warm orange hue in day scenes, and a cool blue hue in darker shots.  Some people may complain that this type of cinematography is overly processed, but regardless of what your feelingss are on the look of the film, you can't argue with this blu-rays amazing image quality.  I can't stress this enough, the movie just looks perfect.

Special features are as bad as they were on the DVD release, including a handful of scenes and a brief documentary.  The documentary is rather interesting, although most of the material discussed is common knowledge by now.  Sadly the bonus content didn't get the HD treatment, understandable since the documentary was shot on video and the deleted scenes never made it past dailies.

Ethan Hawke and Uma Thurman display great chemistry together (which is only natural of course since Gattaca came out when they were a real-life couple). Jude Law, playing his first role in a U.S. film, is perfectly cast as the genetically handcrafted man whom fate has reduced to the role of a cynical surrogate identity. The supporting cast does an admirable job, as well. Gattaca handles its subject matter with intelligence and ties its storyline together with a thread of tightly woven yet understated suspense.

Gattaca's visuals are stunning and provide a distinctive feel. The scenery is cold, stark and utilitarian - a blend of both neo- and retro-futuristic motifs. Outdoor scenes are set with earthy tones and stylized golden hues, giving the film a tidy yet dystopian feel. Plus Gattaca features a musical score that I can only describe as hauntingly triumphant.

Needless to say, this is one of my favorite cinematic treasures, one that I highly recommend.",1205971200,,1188,5.150259067357513

As others note, it's beautifully shot, and in the context of its original release date is almost like an odd pornography for the age of AIDS (the plot requires excessive details on blood and other bodily fluids).

Most spectacular about the film though is its argument in support of those of us who were never supposed to do much, and somehow do and did much more.  I have watched this movie dozens if not hundreds of times now, and it still makes me cry.  It is a love letter to ambition, and a solace for those of us who have ""never saved anything for the way back"" and done extraordinary things in spite of flesh and circumstances.  In many ways, for me, this film is a litmus test for my close friends and other intimates.

It is worth noting that I own the both the original Gattaca DVD and Super-Bit version for comparison.

1) Special Features:
While maintaining the original DVD's ugly menu system, this edition contains a 22 featurette on the making of Gattaca with interviews of Ethan Hawke, Jude Law, and a number of the production crew.  I enjoyed this addition.  There is also a new clip on gene manipulation (history, current, and future) which was somewhat interesting.

2) Image Quality:
The original DVD was only a single layer 4.5gb disk, which resulted in a grainy image with a slightly blue tint.  The Super-Bit disk was disappointingly mastered, with visible dust and hair in the copy.  The Super-Bit version took on a more natural tone but suffered from over-saturated browns and greens.

Finally, this reproduction seems to have a good balance between color and image quality, although some scenes are a little grainy and the movie overall seems darker.

Conclusion:
Is it worth buying this edition if you have one of the others?  Probably not, but with the HD format wars over, I might be inclined to splurge on a Blu-Ray player to give the new Blu-Ray Gattaca disk a spin.",1205366400,108,1248,4.872037914691943

It explores various avenues of social class and instability and shows truly how a person can overcome these instances.

It is a piece of art, even the title and name of the facility is crafted to reflect the topic of the film, the letters in Gattaca comprise the letters of the proteins in DNA.  The messages in the film are nothing short of tremendous about the human will, turning our weaknesses into strengths, achieving our goals and the darker tendencies of society to categorize and box in our potential.  It is an emotional roller coaster you will never forget.  I can't recommend it highly enough.

28008,5,0767805712,"I am a huge SciFi fan, but there has always been a soft spot in me for the harder (ie. realistic) titles over the years. Gattaca is one of the finest films to come out of the 90's and one of the best SciFi films of all time. I still remember going to see it in the theater, where the film broke and they gave us free passes to 'Air Force One' (shudder). Over the years I have owned it on laser disc and Superbit DVD - this film is going to be amazing on blu-ray.

The film centers around Ethan Hawke, who plays a young man with a genetic defect who uses the identity of a recently paralyzed, genetically pure athlete (Jude Law) to pursue his dreams of going into space. The problem is society has basically bio-engineered the populace at conception (Hawke's character was made 'the old-fashioned way' in the back of his parents car) removing unwanted genetic problems to the point of discrimination against individuals who have not had their genetic structure perfected. When an important executive of the NASA-esque company where Hawke works is murdered, he becomes the prime suspect when an eyelash of his is identifed during the police investigation.

I don't want to explain the entire plot, with its twists and turns, only to say it is exciting up to the very end. Uma Thurman and Alan Arkin also give excellent performances as Hawke's love interest and a police detective respectively. An effective soundtrack and gorgeous cinematography will make this a must have for blu-ray fans.

They really were able to relate the movie well to modern issues and many were able to uncover the layers of symbolism and imagery in the film.  There were more than a few comments that caused me to respond ""I hadn't even thought about that!""  This was a much better vehicle for thinking about ethical issues realted to technology than any article I could have found.  We are also relating parts of the movie to our new unit on genetics, something I hadn't even anticipated would happen.  Overall, I would highly recommend this film for other bio teachers to use during their DNA units.",1202515200,,873,4.593548387096774

People in the future can choose to have the perfect baby, without ailments and without defects. This is a story of one man, who wasn't so lucky. Ethan Hawke is broodingly perfect in this. His heartfelt performance really carries this film. Jude Law's small but heartbreaking role should not be missed either. Yes its sci-fi, but its so unconventional, you don't need to be a fan to watch this, or vice versa. Its dramatic and depressing and often beautiful too.",1202256000,,570,4.543689320388349
28011,4,0767805712,"Vincent Freeman (Ethan Hawke) is a ""love child"" - that is, he was conceived (at some time in the techno-marvel future) without benefit of the genetic engineering utilized by all sensible parents in this New Age. While this engineering cannot transform ordinary DNA into extraordinary DNA, it can eliminate potential genetic flaws, select for sex and appearance, and generally ensure that Baby represents the Best Of Mom And Dad. Vincent's parent's failure to utilize this technology results in a baby who is horribly nearsighted, and who has a serious heart defect that projects a lifespan of only 30 years. This DNA profile places Vincent close to the bottom of the social, economic, and professional scale in the New Age, where opportunity is linked to a great set of genes.  Vincent's chastened parents don't make the same mistake with their second baby, and place their hopes on their younger son, giving Vincent embarrassed, qualified affection, and little in the way of goals, expectations, or hope.

Vincent, however, grows up with more spirit than might be expected, and ultimately refuses to be defined by his genetic profile (hence the not too subtle choice of surname, Freeman).  He dreams of going into space and spends all his spare time studying and acquiring knowledge that might, with a different DNA profile, have allowed him to realize his dreams.

After years of mopping floors and cleaning toilets, Vincent is desperate to obtain a position at an aeronautics company where he can perform work that might bring him closer to his goal.  He decides to become a ""de-gene-erate"": someone with a low-value DNA profile who uses a ""borrowed ladder"", or a high-quality DNA profile, obtained from the owner of a more fortunate set of chromosomes.

Vincent locates Jerome Morrow (Jude Law), a former Olympic athlete now living in isolation, and confined to a wheelchair after an accident caused by his own drunkenness.  Morrow has a stellar DNA profile that puts him in the 99th percentile of the population. His bitterness over his lost glory and hopeless future persuade him to ""lend"" his DNA profile to Vincent.  This transfer requires Vincent, among other things, to have his legs lengthened in painful operations so that he is as tall as Morrow, and to change his appearance in other ways in order to resemble Morrow's photo ID and genetic description as far as possible.  Vincent has to have dental work done, has microscopically fine fingerprint covers made, scrubs off as much of his own body hair and skin cells as possible each day, and carries Jerome's urine around with him, as company employees have to submit to a urine test every day, designed to detect just this kind of deception.  Vincent even puts a few of Jerome's hairs on the comb he keeps in his desk drawer, in case of a routine check.

Finally, with the help of Jerome's ""ladder"", Vincent is accepted at the aeronautics company, where his superior work comes in for praise (""not one mistake in a million keystrokes"").  However, complications ensue: Vincent falls in love with a beautiful colleague (his then-wife Uma Thurman) and is faced with the dilemma of whether to tell her what he really is, especially as she seems to suspect something unusual about him from the beginning - she steals a hair from his office comb (fortunately, Jerome's hair) to have tested at a DNA lab.

The crisis that propels the film to its conclusion is a murder at the aeronautics company that brings in the police.  By a fluke of fate, Vincent's younger (and supposedly genetically superior) brother is assigned to work the case with an older officer played by Alan Arkin.  Vincent's brother eventually works out who ""Jerome"" really is.  The confrontation between the two, and the younger brother's incredulous disbelief that Vincent has performed such high-level work with such inferior DNA, is sad and gripping.

Vincent has to use all his wits, risking life and limb to protect his new life, his relationship with Thurman, his dreams, and the opportunity he knows he will never have again if his true identity is discovered.

This story of how one man manages to confound the destiny arbitrarily laid out for him is well-acted, well-written, and well-produced.  Hawke is excellent as the determined Vincent, and Jude Law gives a fine performance as the embittered Jerome.  The evolving relationship of the two men, as they share one identity, is at least as interesting as Vincent's relationship with Thurman.

The film is not, however, without narrative issues.  One is that, although we do see Vincent reading up on space travel over time as he grows up, the idea that he steps into a position at the aeronautics company fully prepared to perform his work there, with no previous experience, is a bit far-fetched.  But an even greater issue in this otherwise well-crafted story, is that it never addreseses why Vincent's obvious intelligence doesn't register on his DNA profile, along with his bad heart and weak eyes.  Given the abstruse work Vincent later performs as ""Jerome Morrow"", it is not plausible that his intellectual abilities do not also appear in his DNA profile.  Equally implausible is a world obsessed only with physical perfection, but indifferent to intellecutal perfection.  Perhaps the story's creators wanted to sidestep the sticky issue of the role genetics play in intelligence, or do not accept that role; or, perhaps they viewed acknowledging such a role in intelligence as part of the problem the film explores: genetic (read: ethnic/racial) pigeonholing.  Regardless, the omission is glaring, and begs questions that the film fails to answer.

Those issues aside, this is a superior sci-fi, whose warnings are timely in an era when genetic maniuplation is marching inexorably forward, and that asks us to remember that each human being harbors a non-quantifiable mystery of individuality and possibility.",1201651200,3,5903,5.039054470709147

28014,4,0767805712,"""Gattaca""  is an example of the essence of science fiction.  Science fiction is about science and technology and how it's advances can affect our lives.  What if genetic mapping progresses to the point where a single drop of blood can tell someone your strengths and weaknesses.  Your genome is used to identify you, define your future and establish your place in society.

Vincent (Ethan Hawke) was conceived in love by his parents.  He grows up wanting to be an astronaut.  But he won't be given the opportunity.  In his world, most children are optimized by geneticists at conception.  They are the best possible child their parents can have.  But Vincent is made the old- fashioned way.  Before he leaves the delivery room it is determined he has poor vision, a bad heart and a 99% probability of dying around age 30.

His parents correct their `mistake' and have a second optimized son two years later.  Unable to deal with their pity and frustrated in his ambition, he runs away.

He finds out there is a man (Tony Shaloub) who helps people like him.  In return for a deposit and a percentage of his income.  He takes the identity of Jerome (Jude Law), a foreign national of super intelligence and physical capabilities.  But Jerome is crippled.

This two form an unlikely team.  `Jerome' becomes `Eugene'.  Eugene keeps Jerome/Vincent supplied with urine and blood samples.  The new Jerome has spent years home schooling himself.  He interviews at the private space firm Gattaca and is immediately hired as a navigator.

The two continue their elaborate ruse for five years.  Jerome performs flawlessly and is chosen for an important space mission.  Unfortunately his life is complicated by two things, his new love (Uma Thurman) and a murder at Gattaca.  Either factor can expose him on the eve of his success.

`Gattaca' is about the significance of the human will and faith.  Anton/Jerome has been told he will never be anything.  Yet he finds a way to achieve the dream he has been unfairly denied.

 This is an eye-opening survey of prominent historical figures who did not believe in a god. Readers are sure to find many surprises here.

28021,5,0767805712,I seldom watch a movie more than once.  I've already seen this one twice and am buying it so I can watch it more.  It is currently plausible enough to be scary due to gene mapping and manipulation.  It shows the effect of classing people by genes on those considered lower class (limiting them even though passion can cause someone to rise above their limits) and the effect on the higher class (depression from not meeting high expectations).  It's a strong look at how we view ourselves and others.  This movie really reached my heart and keeps me thinking about it for weeks.,1179360000,,578,4.572815533980583

28023,5,0767805712,"This film takes place in a not to distant future, after a high-profile murder has been committed at an elite company named Gattacca.  The story's main character works for this elite company, and the film shows how this murder affects the events related to him.

The setting is amid a society that ""creates"" their children made to order through genetic enhancement.  This creates more capable humans, but also creates an underclass who are relegated to the menial tasks of society.  Anyone in this ""class"" wanting a better life must find creative (read illegal) ways of taking on the identity of someone genetically superior, but has fallen on hard times, so is willing to sell their identity.  The name given to a person taking on the new identity is considered an ""In-valid"" (if caught).

The story tells of our main character, an elite amongst the company's elite even though genetically his is an ""in-valid"", one with a purchased, superior identity to hide his own.  He does this because his dream is to explore space and the way to do this is to work for the company Gattacca (which would never hire him due to his genetic ""inferiority"".)  He must live with the actual person his identity was purchased from and the film contrasts their situations well - An underdog who overcomes, and a ""superior"" who acts and thinks anything but.  A love story is also intertwined with the main character and a woman investigating the murder, who also works with him.

*  The story is about the triumph of the human spirit against the most insurmountable of obstacles.

*  The story just happens to take place in the not-too-distant future, but is not ""futuristic"" or about space at all.  It is a drama that just happens to take place in a still familiar future.

*  The main character is an underdog by all accounts..

*  This film was nominated for an academy award for Best Art Direction alongside Kundun, L.A. Confidential, Men In Black and Titanic.  In my opinion Gattacca should have won and I think you will agree when you watch it.

*  The marketing was not well devised when this film originally opened, which explains why you may not be familiar with this title, but is definitely one of the best films out there.

*  FYI #1: The title ""Gattacca"" is the name of the company that the main character works for, but is also made up of the 4 letters used to describe the 4 building blocks that make up DNA (GTCA).  DNA and its genetic altering is a main theme this film incorporates.

*  FYI #2: many shots of the building the company Gattacca occupies are set in the actual Marin County Civic Center in California designed by the elite great architect Frank Lloyd Wright and built in 1959, almost 40 years prior to the opening of the movie.  One of the wings of the real building is actually called the ""Halls of Justice.""  It's ironic compared to the main character and his story.  (these FYIs of course have nothing to do with the movie, just something of interest.)

This is a definite keeper.  Get it and you will watch it over and over, it's that good.",1177027200,7,3054,4.6

28026,5,0767805712,"Gattacca tells the story of an ""invalid""; a person in the distant future who was born without the perfect genetic profile that is required for certain jobs (in this case he wants to be an astronaut). In spite of his physical shortcomings, and the impossible finality of his station in life, he refuses to accept this as his destiny and embarks on a mission to beat the system that discriminates against him because of his limited genetic potential. Ultimately, through creativity, impossible will and sheer guts he realizes his singular dream.

Accompanied by a sometimes haunting score and the  kind of twilight cinematography that gives it a sometimes surreal atmosphere; Gattacca provides a nostalgio-atmospheric experience that gives a visceral tug to the unknown longings for time and places beyond our dreams. The lighting and photography, gives the appearance that the entire film is shot during twilight; even the scenees that take place during the day.

There is also a strong element of want and longing within the film; Vincent wants Irene; Jerome wants to maintain a comfortable lifestyle in spite of his disability; Vincent longs to become the astronaut that he has dreamed of;Anton longs to catch the murderer; Irene longs for companionship. Coupled with the mood of the film; these intersecting emotions provide a charismatic energy that will grab you until the very last scene.

28029,5,0767805712,"An inspirational movie about the victory of the human spirit over the imperfections of the body. A young man, who was born with a medical condition on his heart, wants to be a space pilot. But his health characteristics are not as good as they should be.

He is not tall enough, his vision is not good enough, so he is ""invalid"". Nevertheless, he is determined to enter the space navigator academy (Gattaca) by using a false identity. By using false blood samples, false fingerprints, etc. (borrowed by a suitable ""valid"" person), he passes the tests and is approved to be a space pilot on a mission to Titan. At the very end before the flight, his true identity is discovered by one doctor, but the doctor sympatshises with his dreams and allows him to fly in space. The donor of the blood samples, unfortunately, commits a suicide, because he was confined in a wheelchair and probably got tired of living like a cripple.

The movie really suggests that by training our mind and body (and using some help from our friends) we can achieve our dreams, regardless of the unfavorable conditions that we were born with.

I recomend the movie, because the story is really dreamy, and also the actors and the actress (Uma Thurman) are very good looking, and the building facilities of the training center Gattaca are really beautiful and futuristic. If you have to pass some tests in your life in order to get accepted for your dream university or a dream job - then you should see this movie. Don't let anything stop you on your way to success - such is the message of the movie.

The idea of using a false idendity is fraudulent of course, but as the proverb says: ""The purpose justifies the means"".

28032,5,0767805712,"Many people spend their lives searching for their place in life, and many movies are made that deal with this theme; examples include ""The Majestic"", ""As Good as it Gets"", ""Lost in Translation"" and ""X-Men"".  But what about the exact opposite, what about those who know for certain their place in life and are not happy with it?  This is the central underlying theme in this movie.  It is the future, and mankind has progressed to the point where genetic engineering of newborns is a common practice.  Some kids are born naturally without any genetic improvements, and have set limits and expectations for their life.  These are known as ""invalids"".  Others are born with genetic improvements, and they are born into a different life with different limits and expectations; usually higher.  These are ""valids"".  This movie is about both individuals, brothers really.  One is a Valid and rises high within the ranks of Gattaca, a futuristic corporation that sends people to space.  The other is an ""Invalid, and being unhappy with his fate, uses his wit and the friendship of a thoughtful Valid to rise even higher.  Their fates intertwine at the very end in a triumph of the human spirit over predisposed social constraints.  The movie moves briskly but not too quickly.  The dialogue is quite sharp and natural.  The personal relationships are well-thought out.  And Jude Law is probably in his best role as an actor.  All told, a great movie and worth the time to watch.  Premiering in the mid 1990's, it touches on many of the themes now surfacing in the era of biotech and genetic engineering.",1159747200,13,1596,4.830258302583026
28033,5,0767805712,"I was about to type a title of ""most underrated movie ever"" but then it hit me: it's not underrated. In fact, many many people love the film with critics hailing the film and a loyal fanbase making it a cult classic in line with Donnie Darko or the Crow. Yet others don't know of it and it didn't get the attention it deserved so it's kind of in that grey area: it's got a following but it didn't have the box office to go along with it which is too bad cause it's quite intelligent and thought-provoking.

In the commonly used ""not-too-distant future"" setting, human genetics has reached a level where you can actually predetermine everything about a child's life from eye color to gender and even identify any possible neurological or physical defects. If you're ""engineered"", you're known as a Valid, an upper-class citizen which works more respectable jobs like Gattaca, a space-training facility. In-Valids are basically babies born the formally natural way(i.e sex) and they're just cleaners and menial job workers now.

Vincent is an In-Valid with a heart condition that sets his life expectancy to 30 years. He dreams of space exploration so what does he do? Borrows an identity from a talented-but-crippled Valid named Jerome and assumes his DNA from urine samples to heartbeats and even has to scrub off eyelashes and skin. So when a murder happens in Gattaca and Vincent accidentally leaves his own DNA, he has to somehow elude capture before going on a space trip to a distant moon while falling for one of his co-workers Irene.

From Minority Report to Brazil to Blade Runner, there's always films that take place in the future and possibly offer a glimpse into what it could be like. Some offer a post-apocalyptic version, others are more ambitious and colorful and then there's Gattaca. Besides the genetics thing and a couple things, there's not a lot to suggest this is a radically different world and it works. Instead of being very out there with the technology advancements, this one seems more plausible and just as chilling. The idea of a perfect human seems to recall a certain much hated man from the 1940's who had an idea of a master race. While it's not implied at all in the film, it does seem kind of a different way to go about making humans more perfect.

As a film how does it work? Pretty well but there's minor nitpicks. While the existential aspect of the film delivers, as a ""thriller"" it's not as harrowing and exciting, the love story is not as developed as it should be and its recurring idea of a swimming race seems kinda odd but it's different so in a way it works but still, a character's life rests in his swimming abilities? Um ok. Acting-wise however it's great, sets and cinematography are lush and attractive and the music's really compelling.

Similar themed Blade Runner had a pretty crappy DVD release before Warner announced a ginormous edition for 2007. Gattaca is another that should be re-released as this is quite awful for a much-praised film. It's definately a rental but if you're a huge fan and you want to own it now go ahead but when the inevitable ""Special Edition"" or ""Collector's Edition"" is released, you'll have an extra so it depends on how often you're going to watch a film and let's face it, with Gattaca, it's not that bad to rewatch it over and over.",1157932800,5,3323,4.673504273504274
28034,5,0767805712,"I finally saw this film for the first time last night after hearing how wonderful it was time and time again.  I have to say that the reviews for this film are right.  It's very smart and excellently paced, keeping your attention and testing your wits.  Vincent Freeman was born into the world conceived in love.  His parents had opted to have a child naturally rather than have a child according to new procedures.  You see natural selection is the way to go, having your sperm and eggs inspected as to the perfect child, wiping out all disease and medical problems, mood disorders or any chance of early death.  These genetically altered children are considered 'valids'.  Vincent was born an 'in-valid', not expected to live more than 30 years.  Because of this set-back Vincent will never be allowed to realize his dream of space travel for only 'valids' are allowed to enter the training program.  You must be of the utmost physical shape.

This was until Vincent (Hawke) met Jerome Morrow (Law), a 'valid' who lost everything due to an accident and is now bound to his wheelchair.  He offers Vincent the opportunity of a lifetime, to take over his life, live as he should have.  He cuts his hair to look like Jerome, he gets contacts and he even has a procedure done to his legs to make him the right height (crazy).  Jerome supplies Vincent with enough blood and urine to pass any test.  To everyone around him Vincent is Jerome Morrow.  And now Vincent can realize his dream of Space Travel.

That was until the head of the department of space travel is found murdered. After a Detective (Elias Koteas) is put on the case he threatens to expose Vincent for who he is.  Uma Thurman does a great job as Irene, a fellow employee at Gattaca who befriends Vincent and understands him more than he knows.  Jude Law to me is who steals the show proving that he is as acclaimed as he is for a reason.  Excellent story line and execution that raises this film to the next level.  This film carries a ring of truth as new procedures are already making this possible.  As of now parents can go as far as to pick the color of their child's eyes, hair, his likes and dislikes.  With everything in the hands of the parents, nothing to chance, it's taking us so far from where we were meant to be.  What ever happened to accepting what God provides?  What ever happened to loving your children for who they are and not who you made them?",1155513600,4,2430,4.482915717539863

It is my favorite style of science fiction -- very real and even probable in its suspenseful plot and deeply human issues. This is the story of a modern hero who fights to fulfill a destiny of his choice, rather than the one dictated to him by society because of his genes. The movie makes you think, will the day come when genetically engineered humans will lord it over normally born people? Of course! That day already is dawning, with some companies testing employees for flaws such as drug use, smoking and certain diseases. Ethan Hawke, Jude Law and Uma Thurman lead an excellent cast in a well paced story that gives you time to think and feel. The music is wonderful and the ending both poignant and and satisfying.

28038,5,0767805712,"There is a profound conflict that runs throughout Gattaca -- superficiality versus true depth.  The citizens of the film's dystopic society are beautiful on the outside, but in contrast to the aesthetic societal standards of today, beauty on the surface is not enough here.  Humans have been genetically engineered to be perfect, right down to the very cells of which they are made.  This adds an additional layer to the outside/inside conflict with which we are all faced in 2006; today, there is beauty on two levels: the bodily level and the spiritual level (i.e., ""the person inside,"" as a simplified description).  In Gattaca, these layers still exist, but the third is perhaps most important -- beauty on a cellular level.

Vincent Freeman, played by Ethan Hawke in a nuanced and moving performance, is a testament to the fallibility of genetic engineering.  At birth, he was never given a chance, his parents having been told with 99% certainty that he would develop a heart condition and die by age 30.  He has always dreamed of leaving the world that is so prejudiced against the naturally born, the flawed, and finding his place in the infinite realm of space.  However, the hotshot scientists at Gattaca -- the preeminent aerospace insitute of the era -- let him in only to be a common janitor.  Why invest in someone so certain to fail?

Vincent is not content to watch, day after day, as manned rockets are sent into space to do the research and exploration for which he so desperately craves.  He knows that despite what geneticists and doctors have said, he is ""as good as all, better than most.""  With the help of a shady underground businessman (Shalhoub), Vincent takes on a new identity: Jerome Morrow.  The real Jerome (Law) had been a world-class swimmer before an accident left him paralyzed, confined to a wheelchair.  Vincent changes his hair, gets colored corrective lenses, and follows an austere daily regimen to eliminate traces of his own ""in-valid"" DNA, to be replaced by conspicuously placed samples from the genetically flawless Jerome.  When the narrative picks up, Vincent, posing as Jerome, has a prominent place at Gattaca and is one week away from taking a year-long voyage to Titan, one of Saturn's moons.  With the murder of a director at Gattaca, however, his secret identity is thrown in jeopardy; crime scene investigators are determined to find the culprit, and a rogue eyelash leads them to the in-valid Vincent Freeman, whom nobody connects to the Jerome Morrow they know and respect.

From this premise, which is created subtly and smoothly by Niccol, Gattaca truly takes off.  Thurman's performance as Vincent's love interest, Irene, is pitch-perfect; she plays the character with a coolly detached elegance appropriate for the futuristic dystopia while maintaining a sympathetic air of humanity.  The relationship between Hawke's and Thurman's characters feels genuine (as it should, considering the actors' subsequent marriage), and that between Vincent and his cellularly perfect brother Anton (Dean) is complex but easily understood on a basic, universal level.  Many moments between the brothers are among the most poignant captured on film, especially in the science fiction genre (of which I am not normally a huge fan, but this movie is just remarkable).

I have watched this film several times and have yet to tire of it.  Though many pictures have been able to pull off sleek, futuristic looks, few of these have anything below the surface.  Gattaca does, and it packs an emotional punch.  There is a remarkably small number of movies that feel nearly perfect to me; Gattaca is one of them.  I would not change a single thing about it even if I could.  The characters are fully developed, the plot is intriguing and compelling, the cinematography and sets are beautiful.  What is truly amazing about Gattaca, however, is its ability to develop and show its viewers something absolutely vital: what it means to be human.",1149379200,8,3976,5.003039513677812

28040,5,0767805712,"Gattaca is a seminal movie that reminds me of what is lacking nowadays with sci fi films. It's wonderfully written, directed, and acted. I have studied genetics, medicine, biology, eugenics, and philosophy. I can't tell you how many times this movie in some fashion is mentioned. I guess that is what is so powerful about this movie. The themes, much like the music, are recapitulated. Destiny, genes, life, fate- it's all so powerfully incorporated in the movie and how science/medicine thinks.

It is no surprise to anyone that the discoverer of the structure of DNA, James Watson- once said, ""our future is in our genes."" There is a genetic determinism that pervades our country, our way of thinking. Whether it is said inadvertently thru the way we are more and more reliant on genetic markers for labeling diseases or how we are nowadays discovering more and more ways to meddle with our genes. Science has in some sense become a religion. Genes are our predetermined fate.

It is this issue that GATTACA hammers at or chips away at brillantly and relentlessly. There is no gene for free will/ for desire/ for ambition. We aren't just our genes. We are a product of our upbringing, our environment, and heriditary predispositions. We are more than just a sum of different characteristics, traits that can be tagged to a repeated sequence in our DNA. There is no science for personality or for fate.

The acting in GATTACA is superb, understated (I know, enough with the superlatives). Ethan Hawke and Uma Thurman have real chemistry. They play their roles with ease that fits the speakeasy, minimalist style of the movie. Jude Law has easily his best performance in GATTACA.

The music or score by Michael Nyman- swoons and fits the dark but ultimately uplifting mood of the movie. Much of it is recapitulation- the scores repeat the same themes of struggle, persistence and sorrow.

I am also impressed in the details of the movie. The double helix DNA stair cases in the apartment. The movie's title is written in DNA nucleotides.

It lacks the action elements of average science fiction movies, but catches the viewer with its thriller-like suspense.

Cast:  Ethan Hawke, Uma Thurman, Alan Arkin, Jude Law, Gore Vidal, Xander Berkeley, Jayne Brook, Elias Koteas.

Running Time:  106 minutes

Rated PG-13 for brief violent images, language, and some sexuality.

""Gattaca"" is intended as a cautionary tale about genetic engineering. The film takes place in a future world, not too far removed, where destiny is determined by genes: all babies (except for a few ""accidents,"" known as ""invalids"") are genetically engineered to near-perfection, people are hired on the basis of their genetic profile, and the imperfect products of accidental births are relegated to low-status menial jobs. Our hero, Vincent Freeman (Ethan Hawke), is an ""invalid"" who wants to rise above his genetic destiny. So, in an elaborate scheme, he buys the identity of Eugene Morrow, a genetically perfect athlete crippled in an accident, and gets the job he always dreamed about in a space-exploration program.  When the director of the Gattaca Aerospace Corporation is murdered; however, investigations into the crime put into question Vincent's true identity, and he soon finds that his long deception could be unraveled and his life-long dream could be shot down in flames. With only fellow colleague Irene (Uma Thurman) and Jerome on his side, Vincent must race against the powers that are trying to put him back into the social hole he was supposedly born into and put an end to the life he has worked so hard to build.

The film has a very sorrowful approach to what sounds initially like a very lame plot. It's cinematic and stylistic without being pretentious or overdone, and the way it is shot and put together reflects very well the film's bland and sterilized society in pursuit of perfection. The chilling sense of realism that goes with the world of Gattaca makes everything within it become more than just a strange concept in a science fiction film. Not unlike Spielberg's 'A.I.', Gattaca very cleverly draws from horrors within our society today to suggest the terrifying prospect that our science will eventually render us, as a natural species, obsolete.  Director Andrew Niccol (""Lord of War"") has done a fine job in transforming this sci-fi flick into something much deeper and more interesting. The writing is not spectacular, but is still better than most. Hawke's narration provides very good atmosphere for the film as he talks about the way of the world in this eerie future and the film's theme is very secure, with events such as the murder being practically irrelevant. The thing that matters most is Vincent's dream and the social inequalities that prevent him from actualizing it, and this is made very clear from beginning to end.  The acting performances are all very adequate, but the stand-out ones are Ethan Hawke and Jude Law, who seem so comfortable in their characters and, truth be told, share more chemistry than Hawke and Thurman do. This was one of Jude Law's first feature films, and it is a remarkably impressive debut.  Basically, this is a film that says what it means. Even in a world that has successfully bred perfection, people still suffer, the system is still unjust and lives still go to waste. Far from just being an unrealistic portrayal of what the future will hold, 'Gattaca' questions the ideals of mankind, the principles of civilization and leaves us to wonder what we, as a society are truly striving for.",1141257600,6,3412,4.9982363315696645

Now imagine that you want to be one of them to get that job. How far would you go? This man goes far. Too far. This movie is a fabulous sc-fi thriller of a man who wants his dream so bad that he's willing to do major identity fraud. There are so many beautifully crafted gizmos in here that it will make your mind boggle with tension. But there is also an underlining story of a man's passion and the need for acceptence.

28054,5,0767805712,"""Gattaca"" may well be the sci-fi movie with the most gorgeous art direction yet made. Make sure you see it in a wide-screen version. The expansive, minimalist, vaguely art deco settings glow golden in a kind of persistent late afternoon light. The perfect hairdos, impeccable suits and beautiful people blend perfectly into the shiny surroundings, as does Uma Thurman's peculiarly expressionless face. There are no lame attempts at futurism or obligatory CG effects to draw attention away from the story - a story that has an unabashedly philosophical portent, much like ""1984"" or ""Brave new world"".

Gattaca Aerospace Corporation, like any company of note in this ""not too distant future"", is a workplace that employs only genetically perfect people. In fact, social life in its entirety is governed by genetics - if a girl wants to check whether her boyfriend is suitable marriage material, she merely has to take one of his hairs to a counter, where she is soon provided with a complete print of his genetic code.

All the worse for Vincent (Ethan Hawke), who was born of parents who, romantically, wanted a naturally conceived rather than a genetically engineered baby. So he is born an ""in-valid"", with flawed genes, and finds the way to his dream, becoming a space traveller, blocked before he has even started on it. Yet, out in the sea on one of his swimming contests against his genetically superior brother, he finds that he is not necessarily the loser every time. So he decides to pursue his dream against all odds. Through will power, stamina, and the help of a shadowy middle man who makes a living supplying in-valids with a valid identity, Vincent gets where he wants to be, and where we find him at the beginning of the movie. He borrows the identity of a crippled swimmer, played by Jude Law. Their mutual dependency results in surprising insights for both, and some tensions as well; - especially when, in the wake of a murder case, Vincent finds his true identity on the verge of being revealed. At the same time, falling in love with his co-worker Irene (Thurman), he has a hard time matching up the required sincerity with his fake identity.

These plotlines are developed quietly, unhurriedly and without any sensationalism. No matter how detached the tone of the movie is, you find yourself touched by the characters, who each in their own way are sympathetic, some of them surprisingly so. The acting of the three leads is excellent and thoroughly believable. The wonderful, haunting score by Michael Nyman further hightens the impact of what is ultimately a very moving film, that surely deserves wider fame than it currently enjoys.

Taking the identity of a friend who can nolonger live in the real world, he heads out to fulfill his dream.

Instead of using ""futuristic"" clothing and hairstyles, etc the director chose to give the movie a classic feel with hints of the 1920's and 1950's with just the smallest ""futuristic"" twists. The result is a movie that doesn't make you cringe at what people then thought the future would look like.

As we delve further into genetic science, what ""Gattaga"" portrays is more thana  little bit likely to happen. There will be a new kind of class system and a new type of discrimination...all of which will be decided by a simple blodd test mapping out the sequence of one's DNA.

I am 27 years old and have had cancer twice. Had my husband been able to discover at the beginning of dating me that one year into our relationship I would be having surgery and radiation therapy due to the cancer I wonder if he still would have considered me a candidate for a mate.

It has characters that will touch your heart, a storyline that will inspire your soul, and the movie itself is beautifully written, and directed. Ethan Hawke plays a wonderful role, as does Jude Law. Jude is rather witty in this movie and will provide a respite, no matter how brief, from the serious plot. The ending is rather sad but is essential for the overall movie to make any sort of sense.

28065,4,0767805712,"This film takes place in the near future in a dystopian America, in which most children are genetically engineered to eliminate risks for common diseases and to increase the probability of having desirable characteristics, such as mathematical or musical ability.  Children born the old-fashioned way are known as ""In-valids,"" and form a permanent underclass, assumed to be constitutionally inferior to their more systematically planned peers.  In this world, DNA from any source can be easily and quickly mapped to tell you all you want to know about potential employees, lovers, or criminal suspects.  In theory, this world is supposed to create healthy, ""perfect"" children, but the cost of this perfection is steep.

I'm not normally a devotee of science fiction, but this film works well as science, fiction, and social commentary.  The genetics is solid.  The claims made are modest and the technology described here either already exists or could exist in the near future.  The effects of genes are expressed as probabilities, which is not only good science but key to Gattaca's attack on genetic determinism.  Westerners have already fallen under the sway of the myth that our genes determine our future health and ability, and this film shows where such a misconception could lead.  I also love the creepy little details, especially the genetically engineered pianist who has compositions written just for him.

As fiction this film includes a love story, a murder mystery, and an underdog story about a man against a whole society that doesn't believe in him, and each of these stories works fairly well.  The three central characters, well-acted by Ethan Hawke, Uma Thurman, and Jude Law, are complex, dynamic, and well-conceived.  They occupy different places in society, determined by the quality of their genes, and demonstrate the cost of rigid genetic determinism on everyone without giving up their humanity as characters and becoming mere puppets for the script-writers ideals.

As social commentary, this film raises issues about genetic engineering, privacy, prejudice, the weight of expectations both high and low, and human freedom in the face of deterministic scientific models.  Check out the deleted scenes.  There's a swipe at some procedures currently done at fertility clinics that was apparently too controversial--or unpopular--to include.  Thought-provoking and original.

I only gave this film four stars because sometimes the dialogue is a little stilted and because the pace drags here and there.  Also, at points the script relies a little too heavily on coincidence to move the plot forward.

However, this is generally an enjoyable and intriguing film.  It is definitely worth watching, and I'm glad I own it.  I've watched it several times.",1122940800,2,2777,5.308924485125858

The story goes, in the future, your life is molded around, your genes and how you were born. The natural born people (""In-valids"") and the genetically modified people (""valids"") are seperated into different classes, and different realms of life.

A young in-valid, Vincent(Ethan Hawke) has a dream to become an astronaut, despite, all the things holding him back, like his DNA for one thing. After, seeing no easy way to achieve his dream, he starts to try a different tactic. He takes the identiy, of a perfect valid, Jerome (Jude Law) that has been crippled in an accident, and now has no real future. Instead, of his perfect genes going to waste, he is used to help Vincent, achieve his goal. The real Jerome supplies the now Jerome with everything he needs to pretend to be him, from blood, to urine. Soon, Vincent now Jerome, works his way up the ranks, in a futuristic, space agency like thing, (Gattaca) and soon is a step away from his dream, when a murder case comes up at Gattaca, and threatens to ruin his whole plan. But, during all this, Vincent, falls in love with an in-valid working at Gattaca, (Uma Thurman)and she soon becomes caught up in his plan.

This is a very interesting, deep, sad, and smart story. It is a very beiliveable sci-fi movie. It shows, how humans did not only become more advanced in technology, but in the way they discrimminate. I found, it a very good movie, but heart-breaking in alot of ways. I only hope, society and science never get this advanced, it's for our own good.

""Gattaca"" works mainly due to the enormously appealing central characters, namely Ethan Hawke, Uma Thurman and Jude Law, without whom it would've been just another made-for-cable B-movie.  The script, camera work, film editing and set design are also quite good, which kept this film moving along briskly.

My main disappointment was that the plot resolution basically cops out and hinges upon the 'ole deux ex machina...however, the predictably happy ending is partially balanced out with the chosen fate of Jude Law's character which was a pretty gutsy move.

I shudder to think just how a MILLION TIMES cornier this movie would've been in the hands of a Steven Spielberg...o the horror!",1118102400,4,897,5.295774647887324
28080,4,0767805712,"When Gattaca was released in 1997 it slipped under my radar and I didn't see it until two different people recommended it to me recently.

Gattaca takes an interesting and almost-plausible science-fiction path and for the most part, pulls it off.  In the ""not-too-distant-future"" world of Gattaca some ""God-children"" are still conceived the old-fashioned way, but those who can afford it have technology-enhanced test-tube babies with as many imperfections screened out as their parents can afford.  Eye-glasses and heart disease are not present in the ""valid"" population.  In Gattaca Ethan Hawke portrays Vincent, who was born the old-fashioned way.  Discrimination is technically illegal in this society, but not enforced, and ""In-Valids"" like Vincent can only aspire to menial jobs like janitor.  Vincent dreams of flying into space.  In this world Gattaca is a private corporation, and I don't know what else the company does, but one of the things they do is fly into outer space. Vincent begins at Gattaca sweeping the floors, but he has a plan...

Some of the genetically perfect nonetheless come upon hard times.  Jude Law plays Jerome, who was born perfect, but was paralyzed in an accident.  His hair and blood and urine and saliva all remain genetically perfect.  Vincent is brought to Jerome by a shady character who pairs ambitious godchildren with impaired valids.  Carrying Jerome's urine strapped to his leg and his blood in a small cache concealed at his fingertip Vincent applies once again at Gattaca to become an astronaut.  His ""interview"" consists only of testing Jerome's perfect urine sample.  With DNA like that Jerome must be perfect...

Vincent is getting closer to his goal of outer-space flight when a hated director at Gattaca is murdered.  Vincent has always been careful to not leave tell-tale evidence - like flaked off skin fragments - but soon Gattaca is crawling with persistant FBI types.  (Interesting that in the future the FBI has gone from only investigating Federal crimes to also doing murder investigations - but I digress.)

Although Vincent is innocent of the murder he begins to feel the heat of the investigation as the ""Hoovers"" start getting more and more invasive to find the owner of an in-valid eyelash left behind at the ""perfect"" workspaces of Gattaca.

Uma Thurman is on-hand as well, as another Gattaca employee who was perfect enough to be hired, but whose genetic profile includes an ""acceptable"" risk of heart disease.

The story has a thought-provoking premise, but as part of my own thought being provoked I came up with the following questions:

1. While the FBI has stepped-up responsibilities in this future society, the ACLU seems to have been stamped out.  If discrimination is illegal would a high-profile company be allowed to exist that was made up ENTIRELY of valid executives and in-valid janitors - especially when there are in-valids as smart and ambitious as Vincent?  As the deleted scenes show with a not-included-in-the-film coda: creating a society with only those with perfect genes would have deprived us of John Kennedy, Abraham Lincoln and Albert Einstein.  It's not hard to believe that having perfect people would create discrimination and other undesirable human qualities, but it's difficult to believe that these genetically perfect people would have all their humanity and compassion removed as well.  It's also difficult to believe that this company couldn't recognize that occasionally a ""god-child"" could be the next Einstein.

2. Okay - I can believe that they would test the genes of a new applicant when they were applying for a new job.  But it costs something to perform these tests, and we're told that in-valids who try the ""borrowed ladder"" scam are very rare.  I didn't buy the fact that the company tested ALL of their employees EVERY DAY.  It would just cost too much to enforce the already-illegal discrimination.  This seems like a plot device introduced only to make Vincent's plan more dangerous - like Gattaca has introduced a complicated and expensive screening program only to catch.... HIM!

3. Vincent's parents had a valid son after him - believable enough.  But this brother shows back up in the story in a clumsy and contrived manner.  This brother story-line adds nothing to the plot and it interrupted my suspension of disbelief.

4. The real murderer of the director is revealed and there's not much surprise in the actual culprit - but the story wraps up the ""murder mystery"" subplot so quickly that questions are left unanswered like: we're told that the murderer has had non-violent tendencies genetically engineered out of him, yet he beats another man to death.  Huh?

So, Gattaca is both thoughtful and thought-provoking, but I must admit I'd have liked it better if there were less loose ends.  The performances by Hawke and Thurman and Law are all good, as well as Alan Arkin as the most persistent FBI investigator.",1118016000,3,4942,5.064276885043263
28081,5,0767805712,"This film is such a triumph.  In a world where people are being genetically altered as to be given the best possible start to their lives, Vincent (Ethan Hawke) is what is known as an ""in-valid"" someone who can't hold a prominent job in society unless they exist on what is known as ""borrowed ladder"" one of the social elite that has no use for their identity anymore.  In this movie, Vincent exists on a borrowed ladder to achieve his dream of getting into Gattaca and becoming an astraunaut, through Jerome and he appears to be doing very well until the director of missions is murdered. Vincent accidently leaves his ""in-valid"" DNA in the corridor and that leaves them to suspect that he killed the director.

What I loved about this movie though is its realism as to the future of DNA.  While doing research for a paper on forensic science I found that there are laws that investigators in Britain, Japan, and the Netherlands can use DNA technology to determine a person's ethnic mix and that scientists are extremely hopeful that DNA will one day allow them to get a profile of a suspect.

If one watches closely in the scene where they find a match to invalid DNA, they bring up Vincent's picture, which provides them with a pictorial match to the suspect immediately.  Some geneticists have said that such technology like the ones used in Gattaca would be blurring the line between medical and science investigation.

There is also some great symbolism in this movie as well.  For example, if you look at the name Jerome, and the word Genome, they rhyme.  Given that Jerome has perfect genes I do believe that this was intentional on the part of Andrew Nicolli, the director.  Also, in one scene you see Eugene pull himself a set of stairs that have a structure similar to the double-helix model.  Then there is the title itself, Gattaca is composed entirely of letters of bases found in a double-helix.

This movie is a great movie that touches the human spirit and shows what can happen even when the ""ladder"" is stacked against you.",1117324800,7,2042,4.641666666666667
28082,3,0767805712,"""Gattaca"" is a more than usually intelligent sci-fi film that isn't quite done justice by its uneven script. The film obviously pays a debt to Aldous Huxley's ""Brave New World,"" but ""Gattaca"" actually creates a somewhat more realistic vision of a future society than does Huxley's book. Here, parents are able to genetically engineer their children into perfection from birth, and while genetic discrimination is not legal, the process results in those with superior genes having available to them advantages that do not befall the genetic inferiors.

As long as the script sticks to the pseduo-thriller plot that finds Ethan Hawke buying the genetic identity of Jude Law and then trying to cover up his fraud, the film is fairly engrossing. However, a story line involving sibling rivalry is handled very awkwardly and threatens to derail the picture about three-quarters of the way through, and a love story feels obligatory and only half-way developed. Still, the production design is stunning and almost worth sitting through just for

its own sake, and a mostly engaging plot makes for a pretty

entertaining film.

(Note that this review is for the DVD ""Gattaca"" released Oct. 2003.)

This is a fascinating movie that gives the viewer a glimpse into humankind's possible near future.

The beginning sets the viewer up for the rest of the movie.  We are shown the birth of the hero of this movie, Vincent Freeman (Ethan Hawke), and hear his genetic profile for major afflictions:

(1) Neurological condition 60% probability
(2) Manic depression 42% probability
(3) Attention Deficit Disorder 89% probability
(4) Heart disorder 99% probability
(5) Life expectancy 30.2 years

This genetic profile has sealed the infant Vincent's fate.  He is now labeled an ""In-valid"" or ""de-GENE-erate"" because of his bad genetic profile.  This means that the adolescent Vincent's dream of ""going into space"" will not come true.

Vincent's parents decide that their next child will be almost genetically perfect.  Vincent was conceived the old-fashioned way (so he's known as a ""God-child"") but this new child will be genetically engineered where procreation is done in a Petri dish.  The parents have decided beforehand that Vincent will have a brother named Anton (Loren Dean), and that Anton is to have ""hazel eyes, dark hair, and fair skin.""  The geneticist (Blair Underwood) who will do the genetic engineering will take care to remove ""any prejudicial conditions"" like ""premature balding, myopia [near-sightedness], alcoholism, addictive susceptibility, propensity for violence, obesity, etc.""

This genetic make-up will insure that Anton has a bright future.  He is labeled a ""Valid"" because of his good genetic profile.

Welcome to this new world where there now is a new kind of discrimination called ""GENE-oism.""  Vincent enters this world as a young adult who wants to attain his impossible dream.

He soon secures a lowly job at the ""Gattaca Aerospace Corporation,"" a private space institute that at this time is planning a manned space mission to one of the moons of Saturn.  (Saturn is the sixth planet of our solar system.)  At this time Vincent meets a genetically enhanced person named Jerome Eugene Morrow (Jude Law).  But Jerome is special.  Why?  Because he is disabled and even though he is nearly genetically perfect, his disability makes him useless in a world obsessed with perfection.  Jerome helps Vincent try to achieve his dream.

Vincent also meets a genetically enhanced female named Irene Cassini (Uma Thurman).  She also indirectly helps Vincent to achieve his dream.

The acting in this movie is well done.  Ethan Hawke and especially Jude Law give very convincing performances.

The sets are very good, creating a futuristic sense but not too futuristic as to alienate viewers.  As well, the background music adds to each scene.

Viewers who have some science background will also appreciate the science aspects of this movie.  Some examples:

(1) The name ""Gattaca"" is composed of the first letters of the four building blocks that make up DNA (namely ""G,"" ""A,"" ""T,"" and ""C"").

(2) Jerome's middle name is ""Eugene"" which in Greek means ""well born"" and is the basis of the word ""Eugenics.""  Eugenics is the movement devoted to improving the human species through the control of hereditary factors.  (It is actually the central theme of this
movie.)

(3) Irene's last name is ""Cassini.""  This was the last name of the seventeenth century astronomer who discovered, amongst other things, the prominent gap in Saturn's rings.  (Recall that the space mission in this movie is to one of Saturn's moons.)

Besides Eugenics, I think another theme of this movie is that your genes don't have to determine your fate.

Finally, DVD extras include a short featurette and deleted scenes.  I found these interesting.

In conclusion, this is a rare movie since it's an intelligent combination of science fiction and thriller.  With a great plot, good acting, and great visuals, it is a movie not to be missed!!

28084,5,0767805712,"I'm a big movie fan & this is one of the movies that can be watched anytime because it's got quite a universal theme.

It's a science fiction movie set in the not-so-distant future on earth. Everything will be determined by science, even your genetic make-up, and that would be what matters ... nothing else.

Ethan Hawke plays as a ""God's child,"" someone who was conceived naturally, without the intervention of science in order to determine his genetic make-up. His whole future could already be 'read' when he was born with a single drop of his blood sample, e.g. his approximate years of life span, any future health complications, etc.

His dream was to fly into space and although he has the intelligence for the job, his genetic make-up hinders his dream.

This movie is about what science cannot intervene: fate. Ethan Hawke wants to achieve his dream and nothing could stop him. He wanted to create his own fate, not the fate that was determined by the doctors on the first day he was born.

The human body is so great and so adaptable, that even science cannot read the future of our bodies, biologically.",1108080000,3,1115,4.668367346938775

Two trends that are now really beginning to unfold have reached their full fruition: 1) genetic engineering has reached the level where it is available ""over the counter""; and 2) society has completely split into a privledged and unprivledged caste system, based almost entirely on the genetic quotient.

But what happens when a genetically inferior person has the  motivation and determination to enter the world of the privledeged ? How can he fool all the technology, which identifies him with blood, urine and other DNA sampling methods at every turn ?

This is one movie you might not fully appreciate after the first viewing. Thanks to the brilliant and captivating performance of Jude Law, I watched the film again, then again. After about the fourth viewing, I decided this is a ""must own"" for my sci fi collection.

28102,5,0767805712,"GATTACA examines the nature of personal identity, personal destiny, and the idea that an individual can become more than the sum of his parts. Aldous Huxley's Brave New World already thoroughly covers these same themes regarding formulated utopias and caste systems, but GATTACA approaches them in a more sincere and less satirical manner than does Huxley's work. GATTACA is therefore a very literate piece of speculative science fiction that should appeal to those who desire more than the standard Star Wars or implausible alien fare. Unfortunately, the film is a bit too cerebral for the average filmgoer, and probably explains why GATTACA did not do so well in the box office.

GATTACA is about the story of a future society where one's ID has become their gene-pool. Those with an ""acceptable"" gene combination are given access to the better jobs and prospects, and most importantly a chance to leave this planet for outer space, where, by then, humans are exploring domains far beyond their own solar system. Those with an undesirable gene combination, that is, a predisposition for disease, health problems, low life expectancy, and other ""imperfections,"" are deemed, and doomed, to become society's second class citizens demoted to menial jobs and the streets. The first category is the ""valids"" and the second the ""in-valids"".

The film tells the story of the symbolically named Vincent Freeman (Ethan Hawke) who sets out to follow his dream of space travel, even though he was born the ""old-fashioned"" way, which renders him genetically flawed. As such, he is forced to work in low-level occupations, the fate of all ""in-valids,"" who represent the untouchables of that future class system in which genetic engineering has replaced the divisive powers formerly held only by wealth alone. Vincent, resourceful because of his spirit, a tendency for which there is no gene, as the movie's tagline suggests, finds a way to make his dreams a reality, though not without the help of a disabled ""valid"" (Jude Law). The ""valid"" Jerome, who lends Vincent his identity, as well as regular samples of his blood, urine, and other genetic identifiers used in monitoring society's privileged caste, while in possession of superior genes, lacks the one thing that transforms dreams into reality: the spirit of ambition, or the desire exceed expectations.

Writer/director Andrew Niccol has rendered an ideal film depicting a future where governments determine its citizen's place in society before they're even born. This is fascism in its purest form. Our protagonist, Vincent, had the misfortune of being born a ""God-child"" conceived in the back seat of his parent's car. In the metallic, clinical, and sterile world of this film physical love is unnatural. Sex is an impulsive passionate act and therefore not in tune with the perfection of an intelligent, balanced, stoic, and ultimately robotic population. He is a ""degenerate"" whose future has been already determined, a life of undesirable jobs, being a marked citizen, and the stigma as an ""invalid."" One day he realizes, after saving his near perfect, genetically engineered brother's life that he has what it takes to join the ranks of society's elite, and sets a plan in motion to join the GATTACA Company. And the extent Vincent goes to in order to achieve his goal is nothing less than inspiring.

Considering the current lock down of our rights in society, (fingerprinting, racial profiling, and the unconstitutional patriot act) and due process dwindling at an alarming rate; genetic science becoming society's sole judge and executioner in our courts of law, and genetic science itself moving ahead in leaps and bounds without true and productive debate about the ethical implications, the world of GATTACA is almost upon us. As the film states at the beginning, ""In the not so distant future,"" is a frightening reality we must consider. This is an important film that should not be ignored.

Niccol's film is clever and full of detail, right down to the words and phrases - degenerates, borrowed ladders, ""Eugene"" and eugenics, GATTACA and the G-A-T-T-A-C-A sequences that make up DNA. Eugenics as a form of social control by governments over its subjects is a very real issue. The formation of a so-called ""perfect"" human being by way of genetic manipulation is a current science that is developing at such a rate that the ethical issues the subject raises, and the productive dialogue required when artificially controlling life, is falling way behind. Although eugenics is based on positive principle of breeding the best, it has been manipulated by Hitler, China, and even in our own federal government with terrifying consequences. The consequences include genocide, infanticide, and involuntary sterilization.

In Aldous Huxley's Brave New World, he explores a society where genetics is used to create the perfect society, and the ethical and social implications of such a world. He does not paint a positive picture. As Vincent proclaims, ""Discrimination has now become a science,"" regarding one's social status in society solely determined by the perfections or imperfections of their genetic make-up. Those without imperfections, the biological determined ""elite,"" are placed in the prestigious and important jobs and enjoy all the benefits. More than anything else, I believe, this important film is about the strength of the human spirit over so-called biological determinism. As Vincent, shows us, the will of the spirit far outweighs one's genetic predisposition.

Although GATTACA takes place in a ""not so distant future,"" like all serious science fiction works, it is a commentary about the present. In its stylishly sequenced narrative, it is also a passionate tribute to the romantic notion that the human spirit is, and always will be, beyond the callous grip of science. Ironically, it may have been that very same romantic ambition of the human spirit, which drives Vincent towards the stars that brought the deadening ""perfection"" of the tightly controlled world of GATTACA into being in the first place. So while we observe this work of ""fiction"" we must realize that if a society is truly ""judged on how it treats its least members"" then is the ""not so distant future"" today?",1101859200,5,6259,5.184965380811078
28103,4,0767805712,"This movie is about the promise of modern genetics, both passive, reading one's identity from a sample, and active, in changing the physical character of a person-to-be.

In this dystopian world, genetic determinism has taken over every aspect of life. Babies are built to order, with soothing assurances from the practitioners that it's really quite natural. A job interview consists of a cell sample - anyone with all the right strengths is in. That excludes people with any molecular flaw, including Vincent.

The movie acknowledges that the genes make the man (or woman), but points out that it takes a lot more than just genes. Jerome, one of the genetic elite, is physically and spirtually crippled by accident. His golden genes don't do him a lot of good. Vincent has the flaws we would call ""the human condition,"" unacceptable in his world, but personal drive and determination to overcome almost any obstacle. In an elaborate ruse, Vincent presents Jerome's genetic identity as his qualification to enter the highest echelons of achievement. He excels, because of his drive, but that is taken for granted because of ""his"" genes.

Uma Thurman appears in a prim, starchy role, with a pinstripe business suit and hair in a severe bun. Jude Law plays the grating, spoiled Jerome, showing again that there's more to a man than the meat he's made from. Ethan Hawke does a good job as Vincent, always a moment from discovery and from being stripped of that world's highest rewards. This isn't an action movie, no guns or chases, but good suspense.

It's also a reminder that, whatever good the new biomed technologies bring, there is danger, too. It is one role of science fiction, to explore the possibilities without actually incurring the human cost, and this movie does a fine job.

28104,5,0767805712,"You may not be able to tell a good book by its cover, but it seems to me that much of the time you can tell a good movie by its opening credits. GATTACA begins with extreme closeups of the genetic material falling off of a man while he grooming himself early in the morning, at the main credits appear with the letter of the genetic code standing out from the other letters. A brilliant opening score is paired with this beginning, and it only gets better from there. Like the opening credits, the entire movie is less about flash and more about substance, depth, and (in my opinion) sheer genius.

GATTACA is a science-fiction film, but unlike the science-fantasy people have come to associate with the genre (Star Trek and Star Wars for instance), it focuses on the ideas of the possible and their implications rather than on silly monsters and overblown special effects. You could say that GATTACA is at its heart a 1984-style tale of a dystopian future, but the effect of slightly altered reality is so perfectly subtle (the only differences between our world and this one is frequent rocketship launches, faster computers, electric vehicles, and a stylishly retro feel) that it may be the exquisite camerawork and cinematography (with a slight yellow-green tint to everything) that ultimately gives you the feeling that something in this world of tomorrow is not-quite-right.

There is no gene for the human spirit. When discrimination is down to a science, and the gene police are everywhere, a normal flawed human being has to push themself to their limits and beyond, ""exceeding their potential"" in order to find their dreams and be freed from an invisible social-order prison. The struggle of the protagonist (one Vincent Freeman) against a world obsessed with perfection makes for an incredibly gripping drama.

Indeed, this film features some of the finest performances I had ever witnessed. Everyone does a spectacular job, but there are some standouts. Ethan Hawke gives the finest performance I ahve ever seen out of him. Ditto for Uma Thurman, who gives a perfect icy performance as Irene. And Jude Law... plays a perfect person in a way that had me crying foul when he wasn't nominated for best supporting actor.

Actually, I was surprised when I found out this movie was only nominated for one Academy Award (and won 0!). I really feel it should have won for best script, best cimematography, best director, best supporting actor, and best film score (perhaps the finest that Michael Nyman ever created). But with Titanic coming out that year, even the tour-de-force Hamlet was ignored.

This movie will undoubtedly go down in history as one of the finest science-fiction films ever created. In my opinion, it is one of the few truly perfect films ever crafted. Any serious fan of science-fiction will probably want to own this one.",1098921600,10,2849,4.890269151138717
28105,5,0767805712,"GATTACA is, in my book, one of the finest movies ever made.  It's a movie about believing in yourself even when no one else does.  It's thought provoking, beautiful, and inspirational. This is a true masterpiece.

GATTACA is set in the near future, when your genes determine your status in society.  Vincent (played by Ethan Hawke) is one of the now few invalids (people who have not been genetically engineered).  Vincent's dream is to one day travel into space,
but because of genoism (genetic discrimination), he is forced to work as a janitor.  However, through hard work and help from Eugene (Jude Law), he somehow manages to find a way to beat the system to achieve his childhood dream.

Irene (Uma Thurman)is Vincent's love interest.  She, like Eugene, is genetically engineered but has a heart condition, and, like Eugene, suffers from the burden of perfection.  She sadly tells Vincent that because of her heart condition she will never be assigned to a mission beyond Earth's orbit.  Irene's tone and demeanor is a quiet sadness throughout the movie, which complements the movie's entire tone: bleak, sterile, and cold.

Eugene is charming and delightful to watch, as he provides relief from the sullen tone throughout the movie with his humorous quips (""Shall I save you some?"" he asks Vincent after vomiting.)

The ending is unexpected and sad, yet somewhat fitting, and will leave you thinking.

I was completely blown away the first time I saw GATTACA.  Since then I have watched it five more times, and it only gets better with each viewing, never losing it's ability to inspire, thanks in part to the beautiful and inspirational score.

GATTACA is rich with memorable scenes and quotes.  Just a few of my favorite:

Scenes

-When the nursery school worker literally slams a gate shut in young Vincent's face, after denying him admittance (as his physical conditions would prevent him from being covered by insurance.)  The bars of the gate symbolically show Vincent being separated from the ""valid"" world.

-When Vincent's father records Anton and Vincent's heights with a marker on the wall, you can see, from previous marks, that Anton, although the younger brother, is quickly gaining on Vincent.  After the measuring, the father smiles and rubs Anton's head, leaving Vincent in the background, sadly erasing his measurements with his fingers.  This scene captures the inferiority Vincent felt and sadness of being loved less because of it.

-When Irene leads Vincent outside to see the sun set on a shimmering series of moving panels.  The music in this scene captures the moment perfectly and combined with the dazzling visuals, makes for a truly beautiful scene.

Quotes

-Vincent (to Irene), on her lack of faith in her abilities because of her imperfections: ""You are the authority on what is not possible, aren't you Irene?  They've got you looking so hard for any flaw that after a while, that's all you see. For whatever it's worth, I'm here to tell you that it is possible. It is possible.""

-Vincent, to Anton, on how he beat him in a swimming contest, where whoever could swim the furthest from shore wins:  ""This is
how I did it, Anton: I never saved anything for the swim back.""",1098057600,5,3210,4.903525046382189
28106,4,0767805712,"I could tell you the plot of the movie. But after reading the many reviews already posted before me, I suggest you just read on to the others. The reason for my writing this is to tell you why this movie, in my mind's eye, stands head and shoulders above Science Fiction films w/ the exception of Ridley Scott's ""Alien"" and ""Blade Runner"". (Lest we not forget about Stanley Kubrick also.)

  Gattaca is way ahead of it's time in dealing with a (""very"") possible future. It asks questions of what constitutes perfection in a society which is inherently flawed. The film portrays a future which appears sterile and, seemingly, totalitarian. Mankind's status becomes solely judged not on wealth but on one's genetic structure. Preferably, those who were chosen to be genetically altered (by the Birth Parents, no less) to be the ""Perfect(ed)"" individual. Those who were conceived ""Naturally"" with no genetic tampering to ""improve the condition"" of the individual are seen as weak. Thus, defining their status as the lowest form of life in Man's eyes. To be ""perfect"" is to be ""prefect"" from all the others.(Ironically, as shallow as this film seems in it's theme, it's not far off from how we perceive ourselves today. Especially in the media and entertainment.)

  This film asks the questions of how we define ""perfection"" in ourselves and our surroundings. Where do we draw the line in a world which draws closer to genetic manipulation. This is what makes this film original. Not just in scope, but in it's ideal themes. It questions humanity and the ""human spirit"".  The amazing thing of this film is the lack of special effects. The cinematography, on the other hand, is stunning and visceral. At times, it feels as if you're looking at a painting which helps realize the environment even more. What's even more fascinating is the lack of special effects. It's based more on the mood and pace of the film & characters which help this amazing film. This may not be ""The Matrix"". Nor was it a commercial success at the time of release. But the philosophical themes and ideals couldn't be more realized.",1097625600,4,2103,4.825
28107,5,0767805712,"""Gattaca"" (1997 - 112 minutes) is one of the best scientific fiction movies of the 90 years. Deep, overwhelming and controversial, it was written and directed by Andrew Niccol. Gattaca, the name of a specific DNA strain sequence of the human body, is also the denomination of a space trip megacorporation. The society described in the narrative adopts the genetic manipulation to improve the attributes of each human being. In fact, the people are classified as ""valids"" [or perfect conceived in laboratory] and ""invalids"" [conceived by the natural method]. Vincent Freeman [the actor Ethan Hawke] is one of ""invalids"" having to support his stigma of birth, beyond other imperfections. He has an illness that limits his life to 30 years - in contrast to his younger brother, Anton [Loren Dean], that was designed genetically and is a member of the elite. But Vincent did not accept his destiny. He aims for changing his life and fulfill his dreams, travelling to other planets. To qualify himself as a space pilot, the young one would have to be ""perfect"" or ""valid"". As in that society the identity of someone was not confirmed by documents but by their genes, Vincent perceives that he has to turn himself into another person to obtain what he wants. Through a DNA trader, he knows Jerome Eugene Morrow [the actor Jude Law], a superior being that was paralyzed  in an accident and was excluded from the society. Using samples of blood, hair, skin and urine of Jerome, Vincent assumes his identity, becoming a navigator. Vincent also falls in love for the pretty Irene [the actress Uma Thurman], his colleague in Gattaca, that does not know his true identity. One week before the space mission, a murder in Gattaca starts an inquiry led for Anton, that is a policeman. Vincent is in a great danger to be discovered.

28134,5,0767805712,"1997's science-fiction drama GATTACA offers an intelligent look into the possible future of applied DNA science, a future where potential parents are given the ability to determine the genetic characteristics and thereby create a society of near-perfect super-humans.  As one might deduce, this means that individuals born the ""natural way""--such folk are referred to as ""In-Valids""--are deemed inferior and prejudicially relegated to the lower rungs of the social ladder.  In other words, In-Valids are considered mere mortals in this high-tech, genetically engineered world, and as such, education and opportunity are socially beyond their reach.
The film's plot revolves around Vincent Freeman (Ethan Hawke), an In-Valid who works as a janitor at an aerospace firm named Gattaca Corporation.  But in spite of society's view of him, Vincent has dreams of someday going into space himself, and his intelligence and all-consuming drive to find a way to transcend societally imposed barriers leads him into an alliance with a black-marketeer (Tony Shalhoub) and a genetically ""superior"" young man (Jude Law) who wants to sell his own identity.  Soon Vincent is engaged in a scheme to secure employment as an engineer at Gattaca and thereby realize his goals and dreams.  But once he's finally on the other side of the fence, how long can he sustain such subterfuge in a society where an individual's genetic identity is constantly monitored and even a lost eyelash can provide authorities with enough genetic material to expose a fraud?
GATTACA examines the nature of personal identity, personal destiny, and the idea that an individual can become more than the sum of his parts.  Aldous Huxley's BRAVE NEW WORLD already thoroughly covers these same themes, but GATTACA approaches them in a more earnest and less satirical manner than does Huxley's magnum opus.  GATTACA is therefore a very literate piece of speculative SF that should appeal to those who desire more than the standard STAR WARS (1977) or bug-eyed alien fare.  Unfortunately, the film is a bit too cerebral for the average filmgoer, and probably explains why GATTACA was a bit of a bomb at the box office.
The film is excellently scripted and directed by Andrew Niccol, who later penned the script for the acclaimed THE TRUMAN SHOW (1998).  The all-star cast does a fantastic job of acting, too, even those in minor roles (watch for Ernest Borgnine, Gore Vidal, Xander Berkeley, and others).  Slawomir Idziak's cinematography is gorgeous but never overwhelms the story, and the special FX, though minimal, are subtle and quite effective.  GATTACA is a great example of what thoughtful, intelligent SF cinema should be.
The standard DVD version of GATTACA from Columbia/Tristar offers a very good digital transfer of the film (there are a few filmic artifacts) in 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen.  It also has bonus material that includes a short featurette, trailers, and some deleted scenes.  The SuperBit DVD version--also in 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen--offers a crisper, less grainy digital transfer, but it was apparently made from the same source and therefore contains the same filmic artifacts.  (Audiophiles note: the SuperBit does have superior sound.)  Keep in mind that, as with other SuperBit offerings from Columbia/Tristar, the increased bit rate comes at the cost of bonus material--you get the film only.  And the higher cost of the SuperBit is justifiable only if you have a high-definition TV and can therefore appreciate the extra visual info.  Regardless of which DVD version is purchased, however, a GATTACA DVD is a must-own for any true fan of intelligent speculative science fiction.",1088640000,2,3672,5.281786941580756
28135,4,0767805712,"This movie reminded me most of Aldous Huxley's famous novel: Brave New World. This book is about how your genes make you what you are in life.
The same happens in this movie. Ethan Hawke is born a degenerate, someone born only through his parents without any interference. His brother however was 'crafted'. He has a heart condition which should have killed him but he is still alive. His dream is to get into space and he therefore takes on the identity of someone who is capable of going into space but is crippled. Through DNA tricks he tries to but gets involved in a murder scandal.
The movie has no special effects and does not need them. It's a murder mystery in the not too distant future. As mentioned before the book Brave New World comes to mind but also the movie 'AI' in its cleverness and 'Blade Runner' in it's artistic sense, even a little 'Brazil'.

28136,4,0767805712,"Gattaca paints a future where the haves are genetically designed and the have-nots are genetically inferior with no hope of advancement.  But one young man has a dream.  He wants to get into space.  To do this he works out and studies as hard as he is able.  But all of the hard work does no good.  Then he finds a way.
Occasionally one of the haves has an accident.  Then it is possible to assume that person's identity armed with genetic traces, blood and urine samples and some creative surgery.  Thus armed he is able to enter Gattaca (the organization responsible for space flight) where he wins a position on the mission to Titan.  But there is a hitch; a murder.  During the investigative sweep one of his eyelashes is found and the search begins in earnest.
Most of the rest of the movie is involved with trying to maintain identity long enough to manage take off.  Complicating matters are a Columbo-style detective (Alan Arkin), a love interest (Uma Thurman) and his brother from his old life.  In the end it comes down to a simple idea.  Many of the haves know a have-not (be it a child, sibling or whatever) who they have had to abandon and our hero represents the one ray of hope that these people can have.  So just as he is discovered, the discoverers each have a reason to not turn him in and he begins the mission to Titan.
Gattaca, with its heavy detective cat-and-mouse, could be the successor to Alfred Bester's THE DEMOLISHED MAN.  This was a very well made film with a good story, characters, acting and pacing.  There were excellent performances from many of the cast including author Gore Vidal.

28147,5,0767805712,"It wasn't exactly surprising that this masterful film escaped most radars. Without bombastic effects and without any mass promotion and media brouhaha it was released almost silently and has gained the reputation of a true classic ever since.
  Twenty minutes into this film and all the tell-tale signs of a great and capturing story are already well in place and it almost never lets down after that.
  With all the dystopia banners obvious to anyone who's lost his optimism, Gattaca is about the story of a future society where ID has become one's gene-pool. Those with an ""acceptable"" gene combination are given access to the better jobs and prospects, and most importantly a chance to leave this planet for outer space, where, by then, humans are exploring domains far beyond their own solar system. Those with an undesirable gene combination, that is, big probability for disease, or other health failures and low life expectancy, are deemed, and doomed, to become society's low-rank water-carriers. The first category is the ""valids"" and the second the ""in-valids"".
  One such invalid driven by his passionate dream of outer-space travel, finds a way to beat the system, by using blood and hair samples of a former valid who's incapacitated by partial paralysis. He assumes his new ID with full co-operation by the former invalid, and both these peoples' lives become an excruciating every day routine of trying to keep beating the control-checks and achieving each their own goals. Things turn even edgier when a murder investigation inside the base for space-travel points worrying leads towards the (...) and the police are hot on his trail. From then on it becomes a race of time. If he makes it he's safe for good, safe in the confines of the surreal distance that will separate him and the earth as his destination is Titan, a planet several years of distance away.
  Gattaca is without a doubt one of the most intelligent films in recent time. Packed with superb ideas about a dystopian future without resorting to pomposity is its utter brilliance, subtle and convincing performances cement the result and the directing is equally great, using color and unidentifiable space to set the atmosphere.
  Ethan Hawke plays the system-beater according to the cue of the story, always below the surface, and always with a ""looking-behind-the-shoulder"" aura. But the show is actually stolen by Jude Law, his Identity Giver and an ex-wonder ""gene holder"", who has to daily swallow his bitterness while trying to make what he thinks as best out of the situation. Uma Thurman is rather confined to the backround in the story, making Gattaca primarily a two-actor film. But this never undermines the force of this movie, instead it helps emphasize the story even more.
  Incredibly poetic, especially the ending, and melancholically romantic, Gattaca is a tremendous film the full impact of which catches up with you after it's finished. Great on all levels with the slight exception of the love affair between Hawke and Thurman which doesn't serve much really but that does little to undermine the overall picture.
  Essential for the sci-fi oriented and fans of intelligent cinema alike.",1086307200,4,3191,5.053333333333334

Andrew Niccol makes his film dbut with Gattaca (1997).  Born in New Zealand he is also a screen writer and director.  He directed TV commercials in London before moving to Los Angles, where he felt that he could do something with more substance than commercials.  Niccol actually made our deepest fantasies come true with this sci-fi thriller film.  One is reminded of Orwell's book 1984, which also delves into the mind of the devious, not to mention Lois Lowry's book, The Giver.  Both authors, along with Niccol give us glimpses into a futurist world where society is stratified; life is pretty much predictable for the privileged, those not so well endowed have to scrounge for their very existence.  The message here is that we need to face our deepest fears and conquer them.  We have the means at our disposal to do anything that we want or put our minds to do.
Niccol's use of dark and light portrayed sinister happenings, which had to be hid from the authorities.  The hiding in the shadows, added to the drama of the situation where Vincent (Ethan Hawke) was almost caught by his brother, in a nightclub, where by societal standards he was not allowed to be as an invalid.  Vincent found that he was able to achieve his dream, though not without help along the way.  Even though he lived in a closed society, he managed to escape from living the life of the marginalized.
One of the two major thoughts that came from this movie for me is how we as a society are not really that far from the practice of eugenetics.  Eugenetics is the practice of genetically altering the gene pool, DNA of a species.  While this film shows that practice in the form of shifting out unwanted traits; i.e. obesity, and other harmful physical conditions, one thing that could not be genetically altered was the spirit or soul of the individual.  Each person is an individual which thinks differently and uniquely from any one else.  The possibilities are endless, especially since this technology is already in use for cancer treatments.  But reality also shows that not everything shows up in the genes of individuals.
The other thought brings into focus much of what has been happening in the development of identification technology.  The use of lasers to identify individual through their eye imprints, is now available in certain secure government facilities.  The future may be nearer than we think.",1086134400,,2403,4.793689320388349

28152,5,0767805712,"Eugenics as a form of social control by governments over its subjects is a very real issue. The formation of a so-called `perfect' human being by way of genetic manipulation is a current science that is developing at such a rate that the ethical issues the subject raises, and the productive dialogue required when artificially controlling life, is falling way behind. In Aldous Huxley's `Brave New World Revisited', he explores a society where genetics is used to create the perfect society, and the ethical and social implications of such a world. He does not paint a positive picture. As the main character, Vincent, in this film proclaims, ""Discrimination has now become a science."" One's social status in society is solely determined by the perfections or imperfections of their genetic make-up. What does society do with its genetic imperfections? In the film, the lower end of the gene pool is relegated to menial jobs and the streets. Those without imperfections, the biological determined `elite', are placed in the prestigious and important jobs and enjoy all the benefits. More than anything else, I believe, this important film is about the strength of the human spirit over so-called biological determinism. As the main character, Vincent, shows us, the will of the spirit far outweighs one's genetic predisposition.
Writer/director Andrew Nicole (Simone, The Truman Show) has rendered a near perfect film depicting a not so future dystopian world where governments determine its citizen's place in society before they're even born. This is fascism in its purest form. Our protagonist, Vincent, had the misfortune of being born a `love child' conceived in the back seat of his parent's car. He is a `de(gene)rate' whose future has been already determined: a life of slovenly jobs, a marked citizen, known as an `invalid'. One day he realises, after saving his near perfect, genetically engineered brother's life, that he has what it takes to join the ranks of society's elite, and sets a plan in motion to join the Gattaca company. The lengths this boy goes to in order to achieve his goal is nothing less than astounding.
Considering the current lock down of our rights in society, (fingerprinting and computerized mugshots at every border airport) and due process dwindling at an alarming rate; genetic science becoming society's sole judge and executioner in our courts of law; and genetic science itself moving ahead in leaps and bounds without true and productive debate about the ethical implications, the world of Gattaca is almost upon us. As the film states at the beginning, ""In the not so distant future."", is a frightening reality we must consider.

The story digs deep enough into the science to show the biotech driven Big Brother society we could grow into if we are not careful without overloading those who aren't interested in that sort of thing.

28154,5,0767805712,"One can tell a lot about a person by their reaction to Gattaca.  (1) It was a commercial dud, so few will know what you're talking about, and (2) Most people don't see it for what it is. There's just not enough life here - at least not at the surface.  For that 4% of us who do enjoy this movie, we belong to a distinct tribe, and we recognize in this flick a certain kind of intellectual philosophical adventure which is rare and powerful.
I liked this film. It's one of the very few successful deep sci-fi films ever, and it's more impressive to me because they did it with no budget and without distracting toys. This film is an adult thought-experiment, making a statement about a number of related issues regarding genetics, social engineering and the nature of the self.
Personally, I think a variation of Gattaca's future-dystopia will be realized someday - maybe not in our lifetimes, but still - the Darwinian forces that would cause Gattaca are real, and they will effect the real future in one way or another. Passing laws against this 'progress' would be like outlawing the motions of the planets. They don't respond to judicial sanction.
So this film has a ring of premonition in my mind. Maybe in a hundred years after the world has changed, someone will watch Gattaca and will see that at least we had our eyes wide open as we walked off that genetic cliff.  C'est la vie.",1080345600,11,1387,4.51792828685259
28155,5,0767805712,"Gattaca (1997) is a beautiful movie that takes place in the not-so-distant future where genetic manipulation prior to birth brings out the best qualities of the parents while eliminating the worst, specifically, predispositions to diseases, additions, poor eyesight, etc.  That is, if your parents choose to do so...
The film tells the a story about Vincent Freeman (Ethan Hawke), a man born naturally, a 'God-child', one who didn't benefit from advanced technology during his development within the womb, and subsequently has various conditions many are familiar with like poor eyesight, heart problems, etc.  Vincent has his sights set on the stars, wanting to travel to distant planets, visit far away places (I mean really far away) but due to advanced science, he has no chance as people can now determine the status of your health, your future health, by any number of ways, a strand of hair, a bit of spittle on a cup, a flake of skin, and while biases due to genetic profiling are illegal, the practice is common and widespread, resulting in Vincent relegated to working in less than desirable jobs like cleaning offices.
This practice of genetic stereotyping has lead to a new kind of crime, one where a person of impeccable genetic make-up but who has found themselves a victim of fate due to a permanent injury or such, can broker their identity to a natural born person,  supplying that person with various blood and urine samples, strands of hair, flakes of skin, allowing that person to pose as a 'valid' individual, and garner a choice position in corporate society.  Jude Law plays Jerome Eugene Morrow, a superior individual who suffered a crippling accident and has now agreed to sell his identity to Vincent Freeman, in exchange for Vincent supporting the lifestyle Jerome was accustom to prior the accident.  This involves a very elaborate daily routine by Vincent, including a complete scrub down of his entire body to remove any 'loose' material that could possibly be found, analyzed, and give him away.  In order for Vincent to pose as Jerome, he must carry on him samples of Jerome's blood, urine, and other identifiers at all times.
Vincent manages to pull off the sham, securing himself a position at Gattaca, a 'corporate' NASA, and is on the fast track to achieving his dream of space travel...but for one problem.  A high-ranking official in Gattaca was recently murdered, and the police are thoroughly investigating all individuals.  Will Vincent's shell of deception crack under close scrutiny of a murder investigation?
I really enjoyed this movie, watching for a second time last night.  The picture has a very texturized feel, with the subdued lighting, immaculate sets and costumes giving the entire movie a very `noir' quality.  The story was very well laid out, allowing for rich development of the main characters, creating a real interest and empathy for me for the proceedings on the screen.  Ethan Hawke and Jude Law played their roles wonderfully, one as the struggling `inferior' with dreams that reach beyond his genetic make-up, and the other as the spoiled near-perfect specimen forced to deal with a physical infirmity due to fate, one that couldn't be corrected for with pre-natal DNA manipulation.  Followed up with a strong supporting cast including Uma Thurman, Alan Arkin, and Elias Koteas, we are presented with a very plausible science fiction tale, one that may cause you to give some thought and provoke conversation on the concept of human messing around in Mother Nature's domain.
The picture here looks wonderful, and is available here in both full screen and wide screen anamorphic formats.  Special features also include a trailer for the film, a featurette, deleted scenes, and production notes.

28156,4,0767805712,"This film does not look like most science fiction films you've seen. It looks like an urban fantasy, with lots of clean, straight lines, cold concrete, and some dark alleys. Everyone is dressed in suits or other stylish outfits, and there are only passing references to space. This film is a near-future look at how our society could mutate as a result of emphasis and dependence upon genetic engineering. I found the film disturbingly (and depressingly) real.
I came out of GATTACA asking myself a lot of questions, which is perhaps the main thrust of the film. There are few hammer blows, not so many messages as situations that unfold, and the viewer is left wanting to know more.
I'd say this is science fiction for people who usually don't like science fiction. It is very close to reality, and bears watching and taking seriously. But if you're looking for answers to a future based on genetic prejudice, you won't find many here, just more questions.
Some Additional Thoughts After a Recent Rental
I liked author Gore Vidal's performance in this film as a chilly, snobbish space mission director. He uses the same sort of language you usually hear in films about country clubs or fraternities trying to exclude ""those people,"" whatever outside group that might be.
Also, I must again emphasize the sterile look to this place. The buildings and suits are all very ""clean"" looking. Even the astronauts go into space in suits! This is a very corporate environment, at the high end of the price scale.
In the midst of the film is a murder mystery. The Mission Control director is killed, and the only trace of suspicion the police have is a single eyelash from an ""Invalid,"" a genetically-deprived individual. The mystery, to the police, is how an Invalid could have gotten into GATTACA, the company launching rockets into space. After all, ""they"" have weaker hearts, lesser intelligence, weaker vision; they're almost another race! Something to consider for the future, anyway.
I must also point out the incredible lengths the hero (Hawke) goes to disguise his true nature: scraping skin cells, making fake fingerprints, borrowing blood and urine samples from a ""Valid"" who has fallen from grace. The man Hawke borrows fluids and identities from is a gifted swimmer who had the bad luck to come in second in a race. Unable to cope with the failure of his assumed superiority, he walks in front of a car, paralyzing his legs. Indeed, the work ethic of the ""invalids"" versus the complacency of the ""valids"" is telling. I found the society portrayed in this film as quite chillingly realistic.",1079136000,,2594,4.8710407239819
28167,3,0767805712,"The world of this movie was never meant for one as deficient genetically as this Vincent, we are given to understand. In this nearish future, genetic design is depicted as at least a frequent occurrence, perhaps even the norm. Vincent was conceived normally and brings into the world a daunting catalogue of infirmities, summed up in a life-expectancy of 30 years, low by even the standards of certain far eastern countries today. This does not sit well with his consuming ambition to travel into space, and the film builds a collection of different plots and sub-plots around this basic quandary.

To start with what is particularly good about Gattaca, the sets are striking. They create a `futuristic' aura very successfully, so much so that they they actually forced my attention on to what I believe to be one aspect of the film's main weakness, namely the plot or plots - Vincent's basic dilemma does not require a future setting at all. If he had been a weakling trying to get into a career in, say, sport or the armed services in 2004 that would have dealt with the issue just as well. The other thing that is distinctly good, in a certain kind of way, is the acting. When Gore Vidal, of all people, makes an early entrance in the role of Director, I reflected momentarily that I had never seen him acting before. In an instant I had corrected myself - I have never seen Vidal not acting. He acts a persona of his own creating whenever he appears on the media, and it is no surprise that he carries off his film role so convincingly. The Director is a far simpler personality that the real-life Gore Vidal. The three main roles are taken by Ethan Hawke as Vincent, Jude Law as the crippled but genetically perfect Jerome, and Uma Thurman as Irene. Like the Director, the characters are schematic and line-drawn, and such as they are they are very well done. The trouble, I hate to say, is the plotting.

Not only is the basic setting not really required, the theme of Vincent's physical frailty actually has nothing to do with the ethical question of designer-vs-natural conception either. These threads are separate strands thrown into a single bag, so to speak, but not woven together. In much the same way the murder investigation, which threatens to blow Vincent's cover and reveal his clever DNA exchange with Jerome, is very loosely integrated with the main action - anything of that kind would have taken only the smallest mischance to come to light, and the efforts of the investigators make the quest for certain weapons in Iraq even as I write look a model of competence. It all left me not even needing to make a willing supension of disbelief at how an impoverished janitor obtained the funds first to pay the rapacious clandestine transgenetics operator and second to pay his way though the Gattaca induction programme. To cap it all, there is a further sub-plot of sibling rivalry between Vincent and his eugenic younger brother Anton, which must be important, I have to assume, as one of their periodic swimming contests takes place at the climactic stage of the story. And of course there is a love-theme as well, in case the film ran out of themes.

I suppose this could hardly be called a rave-notice, and I fully admit that the film at least held my attention. It is not a bad film by any means, but the nearer in time to us that such an action is supposed to take place the harder it is to keep one's normal rational faculties switched off.",1076457600,6,3467,4.625

28171,5,0767805712,"Many viewers criticize Gattaca for its implausibility. When the film was released, I recall reading a movie review entitled ""You're too smart for Gattaca,"" which cited the improbability of the hero's success in a society where he is constantly subjected to testing to confirm his genetic ""purity"" and where the slightest trace of bodily detritus can expose him as an imposter.
I would respectfully submit that such critics have hit upon the central theme of the film without fully realizing it; the sheer implausibility of the hero's success under these conditions is precisely the point, and is what makes the story so powerful and poignant. The story is, after all, intended in part to be a cautionary tale.
In spite of the film's persistent ""realistic"" emphasis on the physical implausibility of the hero's success, however, it also bears emphasis that the ending, with Vincent rocketing to the heavens, is a genuinely Romantic assertion of faith that innate human intelligence and spirit can overcome bodily defects and limitations.
The ending also has mythological overtones of apotheosis (deification).  In this respect, Vincent has heroic antecedents in Hercules and gnostic Christianity.  Hercules' divine spirit was taken by the gods into Olympus after the self-inflicted destruction of his body by fire, and after the accomplishment of feats even more implausible than those confronted by Vincent.  Similarly, Chirst ascended into heaven after his physical body was destroyed on the cross.  Like both, Vincent endures great bodily suffering, but like both he ultimately transcends the physical limitations of the body.
As such, the story by its very design calls upon viewers at once to realize the physical impossibility of the hero's predicament, while at the same time suspending their disbelief in order to have faith in his ability to succeed against the odds. In this way, the story can be viewed as a contemporary and highly stylized variation on age old mythological and religious themes.",1066953600,10,2006,5.278996865203761
28172,5,0767805712,"The world of Gattaca is one where people are stratified in society by their genetic composition. Racism and classism are things of the past. Those who are bred to be genetically superior are dominant in society compared to those conceived naturally and tethered with the possibilities of a plethora of medical problems.
In this world, Vincent (Hawke) is a person trying to overcome his own DNA by impersonating a genetic superior. In this reality, impersonation isn't just looks... The movie takes great pains to show how appearance has become secondary in identification.
This movie is not the best execution. It has an excellent cast, and the supporting cast tends to run away with the film. Hawke and Thurman give somewhat cold performances, along the lines of the film itself. I think this film's strongest points are an excellent premise (one that is very relevant today with health care becoming increasingly oriented towards risk stratification)and a wealth of supporting cast talent (especially Jude Law, whose performance is stellar, and it's always nice to see Ernest Borgnine in a movie).
This movie is true science fiction, not aliens and space ships and the like. It's sci-fi like Bradbury is sci-fi. It's thinking sci-fi.
As a note, the title Gattaca is derived from the letters GTAC, which stand for the letters used to represent the nucleic acids which make up DNA (Guanine, Thymine, Adenine, and Cytosine).",1066694400,6,1423,5.111587982832618
28173,5,0767805712,"Gattaca takes a cliched sci-fi theme, genetics engineering gone wrong, and makes of it an intelligent, haunting fable about society stifling individuals, and of over coming obstacles to follow the true desires of one's heart.
The screen writing is achingly beautiful. It speaks of many things; the rivalry that exists between brothers, a society that will judge a human being not by who he is but by his genes, and of a normal person who will break through all the walls such a society sets in front of him to fulfill the longing of his heart, the space.
I felt like crying after watching the movie, there were so many emotions stirred up inside me. It shook me to my very core. The only time I felt that way after watching a movie was when I watched Shawshank Redemption. I felt so angry for Vincent and the way the world is in Gattaca. I felt so much sorrow for Jude Law. When the movie finally ended, I felt a shock of hope, the kind of hope you get when you see how life can work out despite all the odds. It's a movie that will definitely make you think and feel.
Ethan Hawke's acting is, as usual, subtle and believable. It's said that making the protagonist narrate a story isn't a good idea, but Ethan Hawke somehow makes it work. (Think 'Great Expectations.') He doesn't over-act to make you see his point; he doesn't shout, he doesn't sob, he doesn't whisper. He just becomes Vincent the in-Valid. There's no Ethan Hawke to be seen, only a very human, very determined man who will go to space no matter what.
Jude Law does a great job as supporting actor. Arrogant, short-tempered and yet with a warm heart, his character comes to life quite well. As an invalid Valid, if you'll pardon the pun, he represents all the irony this futuristic caste system brought. Sitting around in the basement drinking beer, he casts a new light onto the story and onto Vincent's plight. (Did anyone else like the line 'I'm bored, I'm BORED talking to you!' as much as I did? ^-^)
Uma Thurman was okay. There's nothing noticeable about her acting, but I guess that was the whole point. The spotlight falls on Vincent as it should.
One of the most brilliant science-fiction movies of the decade, it's a joy to watch and a pleasure to remember. Worth your money.",1065225600,4,2252,4.508557457212714

Hawke, Thurman, and Law give passionate portrayals of the characters each facing their own imperfections. The scenes move fluently without seeming trite. The setting of the movie cleverly mimics the Hoover era of US History.
This possible genetics based future represented in this film seems to grow ever closer in our society due to our overwhelming desire for science and business to meld. This plot is shocking because it's plausible.

28175,5,0767805712,"I've always said that science fiction is the antidote to 'future shock' (a series of books that came out two decades ago, which posited that we would all be overwhelmed by technology).

Gattaca isn't far-fetched at all.  Who could resist a future where all babies are perfect?  No congenital defects, no weakness, no shortcomings...

And woe be it to those born of a natural coupling.  Gattaca is that future examined today.

Some have said the movie is slow.  Not so...it's deliberately paced.  It savors the possibilities, gives the audience time to consider how a genetically perfect person (Jude Law) would aid a naturally-born person (Hawke) to realize a dream he otherwise would not have.  I think you'll end up rooting for the guy born the old-fashioned way.  After all, at the present time at least, that's all of us!

Highly Recommended.  The film gets the look of the future down just right.  I can't say this is a 'fun' film, since it's pretty serious about its subject matter; but I can say I enjoyed the film from beginning to end.

28197,3,0767805712,"I bought ""Gattaca"" after seeing the excerpt from what turns out to be the start of the movie, in PBS's ""Nova"" program.  Folks design their offspring and get the USDA seal of approval on their genetic sequence.  Thus is the entrance to the great machine of identification and authentication made, and the outsiders are simply not ""valid"".  I guess I could live with less of the sensational action and further elaboration on the science, but then I'm an admitted geek from the get-go.  The aura of this film is very much like what we saw in the screen version of ""Fahrenheit 451""; that of a world you know has gone nuts, with some obsession that is supposed to be the end all for public safety and social harmony.  Folks will wind up, in the world of ""Gattaca"", with an identification about as impersonal as an ear-tag appended to a factory-farmed meat animal, but a lot more telling.  I shudder to imagine that the much-maligned delusions behind eugenics, made so popular earlier in the last century, will create such a bunch of cretins as the two fellows who conspire to fool...not mother nature, but Big Brother himself.  One really has to wonder, in all of this, which is the better cause--one's comfort or one's innate conscience.  ""Gattaca"" works the best it can with its premise, only by the time it gets fully laid down, we're just dealing with another story of a fugitive for whom we're supposed to cheer.  There are steep and awesome precipices in the idea of genetic authentication, and the movie gives us some idea of them.  But is not evolution just like that, and equally dramatic?  It would seem that we're enacting our own set of challanges, then sending out intentional mutations that are supposed to win.  Yes, this is all suggested, but what we principally have is an attempt at a cliffhanger flight.  The subject matter of our protagonists' interpretation of propriety, however, is just another struggle of the freedom-fighter ilk.  It is a little too focused on the lead characters, leaving a lot left to do with a very profound topic.  It would seem, in the human intervention at hand, that ontogeny truly recapitulates philogeny, only the ontology is hardly able to account for the impossible number of original interventions that took place during the philology.  Wherever a crime is comitted, evidence remains.  I would have liked to have seen a better treatment of the ultimate crime behind this society's proclamation of what is good and what is not.",1059350400,4,2475,4.7995283018867925
28198,5,0767805712,"Gattaca is a fascinating science fiction/mystery movie, set in the 'not too distant future', in which astronauts dress in stylish, roaring-twenties inspired clothing and where the world seems to be finely ordered and sequenced, just like a genetic code.
In fact, it is the genetic code which determines all. Test-tube babies are the norm for anyone who wants to have a chance; screening out imperfections has become routine, and those who have the misfortune of being born outside the system of genetic checks and balances will find themselves invalid (in-valid in the sense of not valid for work, as well as invalid in the sense of incapacitated for advancement). Society has been structured around a pre-defined sense of potential as projected by genetic codes. But there are a few who challenge the system.
Meet Vincent, a.k.a. Jerome Morrow (played by Ethan Hawke), who dreams of the stars and lusts for a position at Gattaca (the new-age NASA), but with the genetic code of a loser. Enter Jerome Morrow, a.k.a. Eugene (played by Jude Law), who has the potential, but also a broken spinal cord -- he lends Vincent, through an ingenious and intricate system, his genetic sequence. In this guise, Vincent thus rises to the position of navigator, selected for the great Titan/Saturn mission.
Then, the director gets murdered. A flake of skin falls from Vincent which the investigators find, and the chase is on. The launch is a week away. Will Vincent outrun the pursuers in time?
Of course, Vincent's pursuers are led by his brother, the genetically-planned offspring of the family, who thought that Vincent was dead. There is an ultimate contest, which Vincent wins, proving the victory of determination over pre-determination.
Vincent, in the person of Jerome, falls in love with Irene (played by Uma Thurman), who works at Gattaca in a sort of genetic quality-control position. She falls in love the potential, the idea of Jerome, but eventually comes to love the imperfect Vincent. She herself, for all the genetic planning, also has an imperfection, which makes her all the more attractive to Vincent.
Gore Vidal has a small but crucial role as a flight director in charge of keeping things on track (with style!) as the murder investigation threatens the operations at Gattaca.
This movie is a visually interesting, unique, and much under-rated and under appreciated show. It won awards for art direction and other stylistic touches, including the Oscar.
I won't spoil the ending, but suffice it to say that Vincent and Jerome both leave the earth.
'For someone never meant for this world, I must confess, I'm suddenly having a hard time leaving it. Of course, they say that every atom of our body was once part of a star. Maybe I'm not leaving. Maybe I'm going home.'
Interestingly, the idea of genetics is woven into the movie in very many ways, some subtle, some explicit. The very title, Gattaca, consists of the strands of bases that comprise the double helix of DNA G (guanine), A (adenine), C (cytosine), and T (thymine) -- the sequence of these bases constitutes genetic information, much as the arrangement of the 26 letters of this alphabet constitutes information.

Gattaca is a world where humans are no longer measured by their moral character but rather by their DNA, their genetic code. Dating, jobs, health insurance, reproductive rights are all monitored by the government, which wants to keep the ""Valids"" pure and uncontaminated. Our protagonist, an ""Invalid,"" must use his human spirit--courage, love, tenacity, cunning--to transcend the strictures the government has imposed on him. More specifically, he wants to live out his dream of space travel, but he has to assume the identity of a ""Valid,"" and the movie goes to great lengths showing us the pains our hero suffers in order to live out his charade.

I think on first viewing, the film actually hit me more on an emotional level than intellectual, especially at the very end when the protagonist Vincent finally achieves what he had set out to do, despite pre-determinations to the contrary. It does inspire and also makes you think about the possible alternate future that we may have in the 'segmentation' of humans or the self-created rationale for further discrimination (as if we haven't already got enough of that in our time).
The descent of Jude Law's character was supposedly meant to show that no matter how talented a person is (genetically determined or otherwise) it doesn't matter so long as the heart & mind are not there; that it's coupled with a sense of destiny or vision that drives the person toward his desired goal.

28202,5,0767805712,"Is one doomed to failure or a mediocre life because of his or her invalid physical being?  Should one be denied with the right to be successful because of his or her being physically inferior? The film obviously gives us a definite answer.
The film starts with some big sounds made by hairs and nails falling onto the ground, which is seemingly unexplainable because of the supposed lightness of hairs and nails.  Then, the main character, Vincent Freeman begins his narration of his sorrow childhood in which his right to go to school is denied because he is genetically deficient.  His younger brother, who is genetically engineered before birth, is however the perfect human being.  In spite of his inborn disadvantage, he holds a dream of being an astronaut.  Nevertheless, his dream is only an illusion that cannot be realized in a society where ones professional success is predetermined solely by ones genes.  He finally leaves his home where his parents and brother all discourage him for his naive fantasy, and he goes to work in Gattaca Aerospace Center where he is close to his dream and yet so far away as his work is a janitor.  Compelled by his unrealized dream, he finds a then-swimming winner, now-cripple, Jerome Morrow.  Vincent uses Jerome Morrows blood, hair, and urine in order to disguise himself as Morrow and to pass the DNA test at the entrance of the aerospace center.  With all his efforts and determination, he, an intelligent young man, finally gets the chance to go the space.
In the film, Vincents last name, Freeman, is allegorically significant because he, in spite of his DNA deficiency, succeeds out of the limitation of physical; on the contrary, Jeromes last name, Morrow, which means tomorrow, has an ironic implication as he, despite his superior genes, has not much future due to the fact that he canis immobilized due to an accident.

28204,5,0767805712,"All those who think Star Wars is good science fiction, beware: Gattaca just might change your life. With nothing more than some gorgeously stark cinematography and direction; skillful, nuanced acting and a few well-chosen details, Gattaca sets the standard for serious sf films, telling a story that takes off from an interesting intellectual premise and ends up affecting the viewer on a richly emotional level.
Vincent, born without the aid of genetic engineering, hampered by his predispositions for violence and early heart failure, longs to make it out to space; when simple hard work and dedication fail to pay off, he turns to deception, purchasing the genetic legacy of genetically flawless but suicidal Jerome Morrow to get in the door at the Gattaca Corporation, his launching pad into space. Just as Vincent's goal comes into sight, someone bludgeons his mission director to death. The investigators who descend on the corporation soon discover a stray eyelash Vincent left behind, and name him as a suspect. Vincent, meanwhile, must continue his life as ""Jerome"" under the watchful gaze of the investigators while pursuing a romantic relationship with the nearly-flawless Irene. And the lead investigator is the last person Vincent wants to see.
Gattaca boasts some remarkable performances. Jude Law, playing Jerome, infuses all of his lines with anguished self-loathing, the anguish of one who never asked for the perfection--and its attendant expectations--that he was given, while Uma Thurman, as Irene, offers one of the subtlest performances of her career playing a woman whose perfection just isn't perfect enough for the world into which she was born. Loren Dean, as Vincent's younger, genetically improved brother Anton, also gives some affecting scenes.
A protagonist's role is usually the least demanding of a movie, as the need to be likeable and sympathetic tends to preclude much complication or darkness, but even in his limited role as Vincent, Ethan Hawke does remarkably well.
Gattaca is a movie well put-together from start to finish; every element of the film falls into place, and its cumulative effect is one that's hard to forget, even long after the credits roll. Highly recommended.",1043884800,,2218,5.286118980169972
28205,5,0767805712,"Gattaca is an excellent science fiction movie that serves as a 1990's equivalent of Aldous Huxley's Brave New World. Many questions concerning philosophy, theology and science could be addressed from those who see this movie.
From a philosophical perspective, one might argue that though the setting is in the future, the vision of the created society is quite ancient. In this movie only the most powerful leaders making the most influential decisions are the so-called ""gifted"", which is idealistically a mirror of Plato's Republic. So from a structured standpoint, Gattaca is the culmination of ideas or ideals established from the most highly esteemed of the ancient Greeks; however, it is also blended in with the modern day science of genetic engineering, where a perfect society must be run by perfect people, most of whom are products or byproducts of the scientific wonders of those who have determined what constitutes the attainment of human perfection.
Running counter to theme of Gattaca are those outcasts who are supposedly too genetically deficient for the main functioning of society but who nonetheless believe that they can transcend the imposed limitations and expectations (e.g. physical endurance, life expectancy, etc.) predetermined even before birth.
Two opposing themes are prevalent throughout. At one end of the spectrum, society has accepted that science is advanced enough to pinpoint the outcomes of one's destiny from birth to death as well as tell in advance what that person's particular strengths and weaknesses will be. On the other end, however, is one's attempts to show that the whole is more than the sum of its parts and that the efforts of constituting a perfect society are misconstrued for they are merely the result of adding those methodical bits and pieces.
Quite disturbing is the fact that there exist terminologies that bring about new discussion concerning this movie as well as the vision of a progressing, futuristic society. Among these are paradigm shifts, infrastructures and zones of proximity, each of which can be looked upon from so many different angles.
All in all, perhaps what is the main issue is determining just what human potential is and who the experts of this advancement are supposed to be. Added to this are concerns about the future and whether our leaders who will, by then, espouse bringing forth progress will by and large be compassionate philanthropists at best or sociopathic, cultic leaders at worst.",1042848000,3,2481,5.205

28217,5,0767805712,"This is the movie that everyone overlooked.  I have heard people call it a thriller that is too slow, a mystery that is too unimportant, and a feel-good movie that doesn't make you feel good.  It is not any of these; it is a transport to a world where your whole life is determined from the time of your birth, and it is the story of a man with too much ambition to accept his fate.  I would rank it highly among the best movies of all time.
Gattaca is set in a near-future where doctors screen embryos for genetic 'defects' during in-vitro fertilization.  Nobody has children the natural way anymore, because why would you risk having a child with high potential for heart disease?  Designer babies can be promised a life of perfect health, perfect vision, and unlimited potential.  And such children would obviously grow into better workers, athletes, and lifemates.  Genetic discrimination might be illegal, but everybody does it.  A handshake, a fallen hair, any mark that your body leaves behind can be used to measure just how perfect or imperfect you are.
Enter one Vincent Freeman (Ethan Hawke).  He is a love child, a ""faith birth"", an In-Valid with bad genes, nearsightedness, and a potential (but unconfirmed) heart defect.  He dreams of the stars, and of exploring them himself one day.  But Gattaca - the future's equivelent to NASA - only employs the best of the best, the cream of the crop... the genetically perfect.  Denied his dream, Vincent joins the underground ranks of the ""de-gene-rates"", ""borrowed ladders"", people who refuse to play the genetic hand that they were dealt.  He purchases the identity of the recently-crippled Jerome 'Eugene' Morrow (Jude Law), and he meticulously replaces his every fallen hair and drop of blood with samples from Eugene.
And it works.  Armed with Eugene's biology, Vincent-as-Jerome has the drive, discipline, and ability to live his dream.  As the movie opens, he is one of Gattaca's most promising candidates, getting ready for his first mission into space.  But one inattentive moment, caught by an ill-timed murder investigation, threatens to unravel everything Vincent has worked for.
Gattaca is several things rolled into a larger picture.  There is a thriller aspect: will Vincent evade detection or will he be unmasked and have his dreams shattered?  There is a love story: does the woman he is involed with care about him, or his genes?  There is a background mystery: who is responsible for the murder of the mission director?  But none of these are the central theme, which is this: how far can the human spirit go in pursuit of a dream?
The movie asks and tries to answer that question in flawless manner.  The clean-cut, sanitized designs of the future evoke a vaguely impersonal setting.  The pacing of the movie is slow, but steady - every moment is played perfectly.  Ethan Hawke delivers a fantastic performance as Vincent, but it is Jude Law who really shines as his opposite - a man with everything but ambition, someone who felt entitled to the world and is now too angry and embittered to help himself.
Andrew Niccol's screenplay is simply brilliant, and full of detail, right down to the words and phrases - degenerates, borrowed ladders, 'Eugene' and eugenics, Gattaca and the G/C/A/T codes that make up DNA.  There is far too much depth in this movie to convey in any review.  I have watched it a half-dozen times, and there is always a nuance or subtle take that I missed before, and which changes the way I think of it.
Ultimately, Gattaca is a movie with a strong belief in the human spirit.  It is not just clever, it is smart - its joy isn't in its twists and turns, but in its message.  It is a parable about the importance of dreams in a world captivated by genetic science.  And I think that anyone who lives in todays world, with the near-future looming so close overhead, should be able to appreciate it.",1042416000,,3896,4.757440476190476

28220,5,0767805712,"Andrew Niccols' ""Gattaca"" takes place in a ""not so distant future,"" but like all serious science fiction works, it is a commentary about the present. In its stylishly sequenced narrative, reminiscent of a honey-washed and glowing photo spread in an old issue of Life magazine, or the best of a high-end merchandizing catalog, it is also a passionate tribute to the romantic notion that the human spirit is, and always will be, beyond the icy grip of science.
The film tells the story of the allegorically named Vincent Freeman(Ethan Hawke) who sets out to follow his dream of space travel, even though he was born the ""old-fashioned"" way, which renders him genetically flawed. As such, he is forced to work in low-level occupations, the fate of all ""In-Valids,"" who represent the untouchables of that not-so-distant-future in which genetic engineering has replaced the divisive powers formerly held only by wealth alone. Vincent, resourceful because of his spirit -- for which there is no gene, as the movie's tagline suggests -- finds a way to make his dreams a reality, though not without the help of a disabled ""Valid"" (Jude Law). The ""Valid,"" Jerome, who lends Vincent his identity, as well as regular samples of his blood, urine, and other genetic identifiers used in monitoring society's privileged caste, while in possession of superior genes, lacks the one thing that transforms dreams into reality: the spirit of ambition -- or the desire to conquer the universe.
Ironically, it may have been that very same romantic ambition of the human spirit, which drives Vincent towards the stars, that brought the deadening ""perfection"" of the tightly controlled world of ""Gattaca"" into being in the first place -- but that's more of a comment on the nature of romanticism, rather than on this movie. I bring this up mostly because of the Wagnerian tones in the soundtrack, which was composed and arranged by Michael Nyman. The relentless striving apparent in the themes of the music gives the movie another critical dimension in which to build its vision of the triumphs of the human spirit over the soulless rigors of science.
The acting in this movie is superb, not in least because of the stress on the ensemble of actors over individual performances as such. There is a great deal of power in the subtly restrained acting styles of Ethan Hawke and Uma Thurman in their respective roles. Having said that, it seems to me that Jude Law's performance as the ""Valid"" Jerome, who has everything but that one important passion to hold it all together, stands out because of his understanding that this character is perhaps more interesting than the genetically flawed Vincent, who has but a single all-consuming -- and therefore, limiting -- ambition. Jude Law's performance in this movies foreshadows his performance in Spielberg's A.I.",1040947200,,2835,5.021231422505308

28222,2,0767805712,"Granted, Gattaca certainly tries to be all things to all people - it sells itself variously as a Philip K. Dick-esque sci-fi, as a Tense Political Thriller, an Edgy Romance, even as a Rumination on Filial Love and Obligation - but in my book it fails badly on every count. I am clearly in the minority on this, so I had better explain.
From the opening sequence, something is clearly amiss: I mean, extreme close-ups of exfoliated skin and toenail clippings, anyone?
Thereafter, things do not improve.
First off, the sci-fi premise is flimsy (it's a rap on the genetically programmed to be perfect humans vs. ""human"" humans debate: where ""human"" humans have become ""invalid"" citizens, electronically tagged and shut out mainstream society of perfectly engineered ""valid"" humans. But, you would think, if there is sufficient technology to eradicate human flaws at conception, then surely someone must clever enough to fix them later in life too, no?).
The special effects team (who, in fairness, didn't have much to do other than the aforementioned toenail clipping close-ups and the odd distant rocket launch) seem to have missed the last 35 years in development of special effects.
The brother vs. brother thread is schmaltz (the whole relationship can be summed up, apparently, by who was the better swimmer when they were boys), ... Good grief.
What else... oh yes, the lack of chemistry between Uma Thurman and Ethan Hawke beggars belief (Thurman looks continually as if the very sight of Hawke gives her the screaming heebie jeebies), and the thriller/whodunnit piece does not import a sense of drama into the proceedings. And boy does the film need it.
The only saving grace is Jude Law, who seems to make his living these days propping up dreadful films with solid performances (see A.I. and The Road To Perdition in this regard), and who at the critical moment in the film, performs a very deft ascent of a spiral staircase without using his legs.
That is to be commended, however bad the rest of the experience.

28223,4,0767805712,"I had heard good things about Gattaca but I finally rented it only after I had exhausted all other possibilities.  I shudder to think of all the flacid films I sat through when I could have been watching this excellent movie.  The cast is impressive, the story is engaging, and the music, photography and settings combine to produce an atmosphere that makes this a beautifully-crafted, visual yet cerebral film.
Dealing as it does with eugenics, ""Gattca"" attempts to reach you at the cellular, nay, molecular level.  Not to put too fine a point on it, writer/director Andrew Niccol(The Truman Show) infuses the film with metaphors of reproduction and genetics, not the least of which being the title itself (refering to a fictitious government space program, ""Gattaca"" is nevertheless unmistakeable as an acronym for a sequence of DNA bases: guanine, adenine, thymine, cytosine).  There is a particularly poignant scene in which a double helix, in the guise of a spiral staircase, presents an imposing obstacle, and at various times individuals themselves become metaphors for spermatocytes (in swim races and while rushing off in a space ship to Saturn's largest moon, Titan, itself a metaphor for an oocyte).
As intelligent as it is though, the film is an artistic exposition of themes, not a scholarly dissertation on a very complex set of issues. It would be unfair therefore to complain that the film doesn't do justice to the weighty issues it presents.
The score by Michael Nyman (The Cook the Thief His Wife & Her Lover, The Piano) provides an aural texture that compliments the visuals in a remarkable way, rather like a down-to-earth ""Blade Runner.""  In fact, I would describe the film as part Philip K. Dick, part Aldous Huxley as in ""Blade Runner cum Brave New World.""  One of the best and most timely dystopian films out there.",1038960000,,1840,4.957792207792208

But when paired with a 'stylishly soulless' execution, the issues become as dull and lifeless as the characters that portray them.
In the film, love fizzles rather than sizzles.  Passion seems hardly passionate.  The main character has drive, but it's one more exposited than shone.
All of this together makes one think ""hmm"" rather than ""wow!""  While this may be a ""thinking man's movie"" it succeeds only in suggesting broad themes to contemplate rather than coloring, twisting, accentuating, and tweaking aspects of the themes to get us to take the next step.
And on a more superficial but no less frustrating level, I found it questionable that a firm like Gattaca would require DNA testing -- whether for identity or drug-free status verification -- on such a frequent basis.  With entrance into the facility already tightly controlled, what threat (post-murder environment aside) was so imminent that justified such a thwart in daily productivity?

And lastly, with regards to the murder... surely, some of the murderer's stature and access could have employed a much less blunt method of killing, no?  Poisoning, sniper rifle (via hitman), etc... all would have resulted in less risk of ultimate detection.
In a nutshell, then, Gattaca -- despite its noble trajectory -- is brought down by implausibility and a failure to examine critical issues raised in a more bold and deep manner.",1038614400,4,1518,5.230452674897119

The film plays out the absurdity and the horror that this way of life would lead to.  It is a pretty cold film, lots of polished metal and cool emotions.

Application and ambition are immediately negated by poor genetic makeup. Good schools reject kids with high probability of illness because of the lack of insurance cover. Companies refuse to invest in employees with poor health 'expectancy'. 'Genetisism' is rife , people are no longer defined by their virtues or abilities but damned by their genes.
Beautifully understated, it has intelligent dialogue (which I won't spoil by quoting) and a Micheal Nyman soundtrack that will break your heart. The acting is excellent. Ethan Hawke is both inspiring and endearing as the 'Inva-lid' who conquers not only a prejudicial system but the determinism imposed upon him by nature. However...Alan Arkin as the chillingly efficient Police detective betrays the absurdity of Hollywoods own hierarchy by convincingly acting the pants off most of todays 'A - list'.
The film owes some of of its aesthetic beauty to Frank Lloyd Wrights architecture - its a testament to his futuristic vision that a building designed and erected by him in the 1950s should be an appropriate setting for 'Gattaca' , a film not only shot in 1997 but depicting a future possibly a hundred years from now.

As an idea, this movie excels in all aspects. All in all, fascinating camera work and excellent locales. One particular scene will leave you blown away.
Science fiction used to be called ""science romantic"" for good reason. I've found that all science fiction tends to involve a typical romance of some kind, whether it be a love for the future or a sexual relationship, but mostly it's a love and passion for new ideas that can truly change the world around you.

28240,5,0767805712,"In the not too distant future, a young man, Vincent Freeman (Ethan Hawke), dreams of escaping from Earth and rocketing into outer space.  But Vincent is genetically flawed--he's got a bum heart and a life expectancy of just 30 years--in a world where such human frailty is no longer the norm and no one's about to waste precious resources on an astronaut with less than an optimal genetic profile.  In order to get around his all too human limitations, Vincent swaps genetic profiles with Jerome Morrow, (Jude Law), a genetically-designed and nearly perfect young man, embittered by the accident that left him wheelchair bound.
The achievement of bio-engineered superiority for some has naturally created a bifurcated society, with the elite gripped by paranoia about inferior ""degenerates"" trying to pass themselves off, so Vincent's deception requires him to sneak Jerome's urine into sample cups, to wear false fingertips with Jerome's blood for identification pinpricks, even to salt his workstation with Jerome's hair and skin flakes.  Even with all that he still has to deal with the suspicions of an arrogant launch Director (Gore Vidal), a watchful staff physician, and a beautiful fellow trainee (Uma Thurman).  The situation becomes even more fraught with danger when a murder occurs at Gattaca and two cops begin to haunt the place.
All of this works well enough as a mere sci-fi thriller but writer/director Andrew Niccol, who also wrote The Truman Show, is after far bigger fish.  What he gives us here is a timely and thought-provoking argument against the idea that genetics is destiny.  Just as he showed Truman's seemingly perfect world to be anti-human, he shows here that the utopian quest for physical ""perfection"", because it can not account for the human soul, must result in a dystopic nightmare.  A few of the really fine touches here are the set designs which are cold and sterile; the general absence of women, who will be selected out in a world where fathers can always choose to have sons; Vincent's birth scene, when his own father, realizing him to be an ""unsatisfactory"" heir, decides not to name the boy for himself; and what is, I think, the best scene in the film, when the genetically perfect Jerome reveals that he envies Vincent's natural birthright, the unengineered will that drives him.
This is a profound film.  It sounds a too seldom heard cautionary note about the limitations of science, even as it celebrates the limitless human spirit.  At one point the Director says : ""No one exceeds their potential. If they do it just means we didn't judge it accurately in the first place.""  This notion, that human potential is a physical quality, to be quantified, measured and judged, is the all too likely and frighteningly imminent horror that resides at the core of this vile future world.  Mr. Niccol is a polemicist of a very rare sort, for he manages to entertain even as he delivers his jeremiads.  That's quite a feat.  It makes him one of the most exciting and visionary talents to come along in Hollywood in some time.

If you thought that The Matrix was a mind-crunching look into the future, then Gattaca is something you should definitely give a shot at. Ideally, you should see Gattaca without hearing about the story or reading the reviews, and let the movie hit you with the force of its ideas.
There are several reasons why I rate Gattaca as one of my all-time favorites. Unlike the Matrix, which seems like its a possibility a few 100-200 years from now, Gattaca is disturbingly around the corner. The movie gives a sneak peak in wonderful manner, of the possibilities of Genetic engineering, and allows the viewer to ponder over some of its more unintended consequences.
The movie also has some truly sterling direction, through the use of colors, and through the depiction of the interplay of human emotions. Uma Thurman's dilemmas, Ethan Hawke's determination, Jude Law's helplessness - are masterpieces of directorial brilliance and acting superiority. The casting is definitely one of the most definitive aspects of the movie, with even the fringe cast being appropriately selected - Be it Ernest Borgnine as the Janitor, Xander Berkley as Dr Lamar and even Blair Underwood in his 10 minute role as the Geneticist. Gattaca uses some stunning shades of color and hues, which accentuate emotion, convey depth and enhance the visual experience of the movie - be it the Green hues of the beach or the orange hues of the launch pad and external world.
Beyond the directorial elements and acting brilliance, is a wonderful storyline. A storyline that in addition to raising some fundamental questions about mankind's role in Nature, also brings out the spirit of human passion, the emotional interplay between Ethan and Uma, the friendship between Jude and Ethan, the relationship between Ethan and Elias Koteas (who plays his brother), and even Ethan and Ernest Borgnine in one honest-to-god natural sequence.
There is much more to be said about Gattaca, and it is best left unsaid for the viewer to see the movie and experience it. Surprisingly, for such an accurate view of the future depicted so well, Gattaca is surprisingly less known than The Matrix, along which it stands as one of the best Sci-Fi movies of the last decade.
And yes - Uma Thurman sizzles in her muted performance!",1028246400,,2289,4.97911227154047

28245,4,0767805712,"Anyone who has studied genetics knows that this is not sci-fi, at least not for long. The day will come, barring some dramatic catastrophe that destroys human civilization, when we will deliberately alter the human genome to suit or wants, and (we will presume) our needs. It will all start out rather innocently; say pre-birth immunity to certain diseases like Malaria, Alzheimer's, or certain cancers. But eventually designer children will come, and when they do, natural selection will be determined by your birth therapist. This movie is very clever in how it deals with the social aspects of this possible (and perhaps unavoidable) future. As they say in the movie, ` we now have discrimination down to a science'. You can't help but feel for the main character Vincent, who is a `faith birth', because all of us (except perhaps Al Gore) were born naturally, without gene therapy. So we would all face discrimination, which is another interesting point the movie hints at. Who cares about the color of your skin anymore, we're more interested in what your genome looks like.
  This kind of sci-fi is based in science too, not in explosions, space car chases, or gritty unshaven (and possibly inebriated) main characters that make wise cracks every 30 seconds. There aren't many technologies in this movie that aren't possible right now either, giving it its not-too-distant future feel. Another aspect I liked was the costume design, and architecture incorporated in this film, which all come from various parts of LA, and Orange County. They gave a very minimalist feel to the movie, which is apparently one of the best and easiest ways to convey a futuristic setting. It's never too much to presume that 40's fashion and art deco might not come back into style either. If the 70's can be considered cool again, I guess anything is possible...
  I was deeply impressed with this movie when I saw it in the theatre. I was living in L.A. at the time, so maybe that's why it was actually IN theatres. Genetics has been an interest of mine (probably ever since I was a kid watching GI Joe, and Cobra genetically engineered Serpentor), and so when I saw the adverts for this movie I knew I wanted to see it. This was the movie that changed my opinion about Ethan Hawke, who I couldn't stand after seeing that piece of [junk], Reality Bites. He actually convinced me that he was Vincent (and then Jerome). I wouldn't suggest this movie to just anyone however. Here's a litmus test (and if you don't know what that is then you've already failed): If you thought the movie Armageddon was good sci-fi, or for that matter even watchable, it's probably best to stay away from this movie. It's probably way beyond your ability to grasp, what with its subtleties, social commentary, and lack of stunt work, or professional wrestler cameo's.

28256,5,0767805712,"In the not too distant future, science has perfected the technique to genetically enhance babies before they are even implanted into the mother's womb.

Vincent (played by Ethan Hawke) was not genetically enhanced (a ""god"" child) and tests conducted immediately after he was born showed him to be riddled with possible medical problems. His younger brother, Anton, was genetically enhanced. While everyone repeatedly told Anton how far he could go, they told Vincent never to expect to go anywhere.

In a society that heaps praises and opportunities on the genetically pure, there is a black market where people like Vincent can, for a price, take over the identity of people like Jerome (played by Jude Law), a genetically enhanced man who is now confined to a wheelchair. With his new identity, along with Jerome's blood, skin cells, hair, etc., Vincent is able to pursue his dream of going into outer space. But a murder at the company Vincent works for, in which he accidentally leaves a DNA trace of his real self at the scene, threatens to derail his plans.

This is an outstanding movie that has something for everyone. Science Fiction, drama, romance, mystery, and even some action. Ethan Hawke, Uma Thurman (who plays Irene, Vincent's love interest) and Jude Law all give excellent performances.

This vision of the future is creepy, though not beyond what we think it could be like. The storyline is extremely compelling, and the ""coda"" in the special feature part of the DVD will give you a lot to think about.

Married couple Hawke and Thurman, along with Jude Law, and the direction of Andrew Nicol prove that there is no gene for the human spirit.
Vincent (Hawke) is an invalid, a ""degenerate"" born of natural conception without any advanced genetic engineering. Several seconds after he is born, his parents know how Vincent will die, and his life expectancy. As he grows, his heart dysfunction limits his career choices. As a result, his parents have another child, this time genetically engineered to be totally superior. The feuding siblings prove themselves over a game of swimming chicken, but it is inevitable as Anton grows more faster than Vincent that the younger child will be the favored. As a result, Vincent leaves the home and begins a job as a janitor at the Gattaca Aerospace Center, the closest he can be to his dream: the stars. But he finds that a janitor is the farthest away. Vincent trains his body and mind, but still cannot get past the cleaning job. Then, he makes a call.
He wants to be a defective ladder, or, a stand-in for a enhanced person. Vincent stands in for one of the most prized people, Jerome Morrow (Law). His disguises are perfect. Jerome supplies the blood, urine, and hair to Vincent. Then, just as Vincent is getting along at Gattaca, there is a murder of the exact mission director that was in charge of the flight to Titan that included Vincent. Enter enhance Irene (Thurman) and investigators Hugo and Josef. Vincent adequately, with the help of Jerome, sneaks past the investigators at every turn while a relationship develops between himself and Irene. Drama, suspense, incredible acting follow.
Hawke, in one of his first dramatic leads, shines as he plays an ordinary man who is extrodinary in using everyday techniques. He is the most human character in the entire movie, but holds the weight for all the the genetically enhanced. Uma Thurman, who's not given such a role as Hawke, does well with what she have. Director Niccol really accentuates on her beauty and innocence as he plays Irene, and enhance that really has no idea of the real life that Vincent is so accustomed to. There is excellent chemistry between the two. The two dated after the movie was over, and eventually were wed. There is a great supporting cast, including Alan Aarkin, Jude Law, and Ernest Borgnine.

But it was poorly marketed (check out the horrible trailer), and the public just didn't dig the dark subject matter without any of the usual high-tech accoutrements -- such as nifty explosions, CGI characters, the like.
I however loved the lack of special effects in this movie. This is science fiction in a pure sense -- not as popcorn movie, but as a thought-provoking look at what certain advances in science will bring about.
What if we could genetically engineer all human life? That question is taking on added urgency with each passing cloning revelation.
What if pollution got so bad that life expectancy rates were to drop sharply for all who did not have special genetic enhancements?
What if genetic fingerprinting technology got so good that you could not do ANYTHING without the government knowing about it, because their genetic sniffers could detect the DNA in the skin cells you shed every second?
This is not far-out sci-fi, this is plausible, near-future sci-fi.
It has excellent acting performances, including a wonderful Jude Law before he became really famous.
As added bonuses, you get a really taut thriller and a decent love story to boot.

Directed by Andrew Niccol, the film is riddled with thought-provoking statements such as ""there's no gene for fate"".
Gattaca is one of the few science fiction stories that's set in the future, yet is bereft of the usual flying cars and time travel, with the film grounded in a distant reality, but still keeping certain elements of traditional sci fi in place.
While Ethan Hawke is the principal actor, the most outstanding presence in this film is definitely Jude Law, taking the somewhat limiting screen time to elevate the film's thoughtfulness with pathos and dignity.
Altogether, the film represents a new benchmark in proper sci fi, and with its vision based on reality; it's only a matter of time before the science fiction in Gattaca becomes science fact.",1018051200,6,958,5.031446540880503
28278,4,0767805712,"Since most other reviewers already gave you most of what you need to know, ill toss in the other parts you need to know.  Namely, if you are a fan of science fiction, you need to see this movie.  It's entertaining, thoughtprovoking and at the same time, cautionary.  The events depicted in ""the not so distant future"" are just that.  Literally around the corner.
The cinemamatography is beautiful as well.  Filmed in (I've been there, its in california but I can't remember what it's called) a Frank Lloyd Wright creation the film is shot to look, well, retro (the future will be retro?)  but its really, for lack of better words, cool looking.  Stark figures stand against orange backrounds, the sun reflects off a field of solar panels, an upside down ocean is shot through the corner of a glass wall, etc.  Gattaca was shot incredibly stylish.  And the idea that the main backdrop for a futuristic society was a building created and desinged in the 50's is interesting as well.
If you are into science fiction, you ought to see this movie.  It's highly original in look and feel, and it explores the ""what if?"" of a very forsee able future.  Its everything a science fiction movie should be.  Fresh, original, not bogged down by special effects, action, or just stupid star wars/star trek wannabe [junk].  It' s refreshing.  I wish more movies were like this.
(note: The deleted scenes probably should have been left in, save the deleted moral collage.  It wouldn't have worked as part of the film, though it is however, worth watching after the film.  I also believe there is a dvd version of this movie avaliable with more special features, which I would recomend purchasing over this one.)",1015286400,5,1695,4.714285714285714

Gattaca, along with The Matrix and Dark City, belong to a new type of science fiction - presenting compelling, disturbing, alternate realities. In the case of Gattaca, however, part of what makes the movie so terrific (aside from Uma Thurman) is the tremendous attention to cinematographic detail that's evident, right down to the neo-futuristic Karmen Ghia-looking car. Definitely some lurking Kubrick influence here. But unlike Kubrick's film, this one doesn't have any of those slow parts or deliberate dialogue. The most suprising part about the movie, when you stop to think about it, is how little sic-fi is actually in it... but don't stop, go out and get this movie. it'll be a terrific addition to the collection.",1014508800,,816,5.097014925373134
28280,3,0767805712,"Gattaca explores one of the neglected dangers of cloning. While eugenics would actually populate the world with largely benign and perfectly healthy and intelligent people, society would have to become more sophisticated to match those who populate its upper levels.  Those who don't meet the standards of the society in ""Gattaca"" would fall through its cracks, creating a sort of techno-apartheid, bigotry right down to a science.  Ethan Hawke is one of those unlucky 'godchildren' ' born into a sterile future from natural and not in-vitro fertilization. Talk about being born under a bad sign, a post-natal DNA check confirms that Hawke's character will have cardiac, neurological and vision problems and will be unlikely to live past his 30's. (Hawke's father, in an understated but heartbreaking moment, stops the doctors from letting the poor boy become his namesake). Fruitlessly dreaming of becoming an astronaut for the vaunted Gattaca, Vincent ('Hawke's character's eventual name) is confronted with a cruel reality of being 'invalid' ' one of the lower castes reserved for those of bad genes. (To maintain the genetic-ghetto, the police routinely test DNA make-up based on hair, fingernails, dandruff, blood and urine analyses of suspects.) The only spaceships Vincent has any hope of seeing the inside of are the ones he cleans as a janitor. Desperate, Vincent enters the identity black-market, an underworld where Valids on hard times sell their DNA perfect ID's to upwardly mobile invalids. To counter the police, these 'identity-smugglers' provide the tools that will allow Vincent to match up with Jerome Eugene Morrow, a valid crippled in an accident and reduced to wheelchair-bound and alcohol-fueled self-pity. Vincent has an ambitious plan ' using Jerome's identity, he will re-enter Gattaca (he had once mopped floors there) and become an astronaut. Despite his humble beginnings, Vincent has his fraud well-mapped: he excels as a navigator-trainee and is chosen for an eagerly awaited mission to the moons of Saturn. He takes his fraud very seriously ' careful to leave bits of Jerome's stubble and nail clippings at his work station. At first, everything works out ' not even the coldly analytical director of Gattaca (Gore Vidal) nor an even colder fellow-trainee (Uma Thurman) with whom Vincent falls in love suspect that he is really an invalid. With less than three weeks to the mission, disaster strikes ' one of Gattaca's directors is found dead, murdered and somebody is not only responsible, but has inadvertently left some physical debris behind. The only clue the police have are bits of skin fragments traced to Vincent ' but as far as anybody knows, Vincent hasn't worked in Gattaca in years, and nobody can immediately connect him and Jerome. However, a persistent detective with his own interest in the case throws a tight cordon around Gattaca, convinced that Vincent is hiding among the Valids, hoping to ferret Vincent out. Determined to go into space, Vincent uses every trick he can to stay ahead of the police.
This was a great idea for a movie, which is why it loses something in the translation ' Hawke is excellent as the genetically imperfect 'invalid' who uses his desperation to surpasses expectations, but once he becomes Jerome, his story boils down to the tricks he uses to elude detection. The script does little with possibility that Vincent, though it's unfair, really has no place in the advanced society. Uma Thurman is too cold to match Hawke as his love interest. Instead, the script pairs up Jude Law as the 'Valid' who rents DNA to Hawke. At first it's a business proposition ' Vincent's wages can help the drunken Jerome maintain a semblance of his standard of living. Further down, Jerome finds a more symbiotic basis for their relationship.  With the crippled Eugene officially holding a position with the vaunted Gattaca, he can face down anybody who would have dismissed him. Unfortunately, Jerome becomes more self absorbed, undermining what should be a climactic moment in which the wheelchair-bound Jerome must pose as his physically-whole self. What really kills this flick is its vision of a future as if conceived by the guys who do the artwork for Esquire ' with this new age looking like a sedate version of the swinging '60's, complete with electric-versions of period cars, steel and wood architecure, and a cooly non-techno version of just about everything. (Alan Arkin's character, a detective, looks as if he's walked off an episode of 'Naked City'; astronauts fly into space while wearing Armani suits) It's stylish, but the style overwhelms the substance. A botch, but not one you should resist.",1013558400,2,4676,5.117801047120419

28283,4,0767805712,"Many science fiction films have a major flaw - their total lack of appeal to a broad range of people - yet 'Gattaca' succeeds on many levels.  In we're introduced to Vincent (Ethan Hawke), a man of natural birth (or an 'in-valid') whose life expectancy is 30.  Vincent longs for deep space travel but knows that he'll never amount to anything but a cleaner with his genes.  So he grabs the opportunity to pass himself off as 'valid' Jerome (Jude Law) who has been crippled.  However, things start to go wrong when a murder investigation and pretty co-worker Irene (Uma Thurman) get closer to figuring out the truth.
This is an immensely intriguing idea that is carried off well with both a realistic and disquieting view of the future.  Never truly alone and programmed to be able to do only one specific thing means that dreams and aspirations are thrown out of the window.  Among other things it also functions as an efficient thriller and love story.  For these reasons it's unusual that this movie didn't do better at the box office.
As a romantic story it works a lot better than, say, 'Blade Runner' (Hawke and Thurman are married in real life) but the film is quite happy to cater to all tastes and it's difficult to pigeon-hole this as merely science-fiction.  It has echoes of books such as 'Brave New World' and the incredibly realised future is at once elegant, absorbing and terrifying.  Yet it never loses sight of the human spirit, with Jude Law's performance being especially mesmerising as the perfect person that has to live with his incapacity and watch a stranger live his life for him.
However, maybe the best praise for 'Gattaca' is that I loved it, and I'm not a science-fiction fan.",1008720000,22,1705,4.6755852842809364

""There is no gene for the human spirit."" Indeed, people cannot by put into a rigid box based upon their color, their size, their shape, or their DNA. The movie masterfully works with this theme without appearing too preachy or contrived in their science.

28308,5,0767805712,"Gattaca is an insightful moving tale of the emergence of genetic perfection within society and how it impacts its members.  The obvious story, which is compelling enough, is the struggle of Vincent to succeed against the odds of being a ""God-child"" and not being engineered.  The love interest is also good but Uma Thurman comes off a little flat.  Maybe that's intended, but I didn't care for that portrayal.  The sub-plot, however, is very subtle until the end and in my opinion is one of the best parts of the movie.  Vincent uses another man's genetic traces to qualify in society.  This is no spoiler as this is eastablished early.  What is interesting to watch is the character of Jerome (played outstandingly by Jude Law).  I won't mention it here but if you chose to observe Jerome closely you will find an interesting counterpoint to the ""perfect society"" as displayed by Jerome's issues surrounding his, what most of us would call, success.  The movie elegantly has this as a background point. While the viewer is busy sympathizing with Vincent and hoping the best for Vincent and Irene, you tend to miss some of the best contextual commentary from Jerome.  The symbolism in the movie is also very-well done.  Notice the stair-case and the fact that Jerome is now at the bottom and that only after collecting Jerome's materials can Vincent then climb the genetic ladder of social acceptance.  I have seen this movie many times and I can say there are no fluff scenes, no filler.  Every scene has something important to convey regarding the society that has sprung from the widespread use of genetic engineering.  In my opinion, this film is no less than outstanding.

This movie, although showing the horror of genetically created humans, is not meant to warn us against genetic engineering, rather, the moral of this movie is how an individual can overcome the longest odds possible and still succeed.
Ethan Hawke plays a naturally conceived (i.e. not genetically engineered) young man that has dreams of going into space. In the futuristic setting of this movie, spacemen travel at least as far as to the moons of Jupiter, but only if they can pass mental, physical and intellectual tests that only genetically engineered men can pass.

Jude Law is fast becoming a personal favorite actor of mine as well (as he & 'teddy' are the only 2 memorable characters in the oddly boring ""A.I."" released this summer).  This movie wants you to think about genetics and humans infecting the genepool with supposed persons with higher potential.  While it does suggest that a system fully reliant on genetics is a poor choice for the future, it doesn't tell you specifically that it is something we should stop--or morever, that we can stop at all.  to me, there are two classic scenes, one that is a finishing metaphor for the natural born brother vs. the genetically engineered brother, where Ethan says while swimming ""i never saved anything for the swim back,"" as he again shows he can outswim genetics.  Also, i love the scene of Ethan & Uma walking between the solar panals, for this love scene is backdropped by Ethan's inability to see even her face clearly, let alone the sunrise.

28324,2,0767805712,"Why is that the majority of movies as of recent portray the future to be sterile, repressed and somewhat impending? One could go out on a limb and say that they delineate fascism. Is this subliminal commentary in regards to the lessening degree of privacy that only few seem to be concerned with? Whatever the reasoning for this peculiar generalization the sci-fi section of your local video store is flooded with dismal pre/post-apocalyptic glimpses into humanities future. Due to this abundance, I was not overtly eager to see Gattaca; it seemed to be a been there, done that forecast for mankind. After viewing Gattaca I can soundly say my assumptions were correct.
 The setting of Gattaca is a bleak (yawn) Marxist-Hitleristic society; Marxist in respect to the idea that everyone has employment and Hitleristic in respect to the ideals of rewarding perfection and weeding out impurities. Predictably, the plot revolves around an imperfect individual named Vincent Freeman who is played by the consistently less-than-enthusiastic Ethan Hawke. Vincent needs glasses to see properly and does not have a desired body structure. His brother, Anton (Elias Koteas) is his opposite, successful and highly intelligent. Sibling rivalry aside, Vincent yearns to join society as a normal individual. Vincent enlists the aid of German (Tony Shalhoub), a so-called DNA broker who sells false identities to the genetically inferior. German sets Vincent up in a partnership with Jerome Eugene Morrow (Jude Law), a once superior genetic specimen who has been paralyzed in an accident and is now willing to sell his prime genetic material for cash.
  For the most part, the story delves into the shallow waters of predictability quickly and never really emerges. The average viewer knows before they press play where this scenario is going. Its fairly obvious that initially Vincent's plan will go smoothly, minor complication will begin to add up, a love interest will have some screen time (Uma Thurman) and itll wrap up with a fairly anti-climactic resolution. Though that doesnt mean Gattaca cant be pretty while doing it. In fact, Gattacas visual presentation is what salvages it from absolutely tanking. Warholesque modernistic landscapes litter the world of Gattaca creating an environment that is moderately visually intriguing.
  With characters that are fairly two-dimensional one would figure the star power involved would try to beat some life into the dull characters and flat screenplay. It is understandable that the characters are merely consequences of their environment but some of the dialog execution in regards to tone is painfully monotonous; on occasion Gattaca sounds like a script read-through. Ethan Hawke is his usual underplayed, slightly lethargic self and is happy to demonstrate that anyone could do his job as long as they are teen-dream material. Uma Thurman is effectively listless but oddly enough, has little sexual chemistry with Hawke even though they are married off screen. Jude Law is his usual scene-stealing self but gets very little screen time. I kept half wishing that he had played Hawkes role.
  The idea of use of DNA to create perfect children, or clone individuals is extremely interesting material, unfortunately it is trapped in an uninteresting movie. Gattaca tries so hard to illustrate a desolate engineered society that proper character development is neglected for a plethora of elementary DNA lessons that are largely dumb down for public consumption.",996364800,7,3497,5.312839059674503

28326,4,0767805712,"Gattaca's tale of one man's struggle to fit in in a society of genetically-engineered supermen somehow managed to touch my deepest strings and play on my every insecurity, which I find surprising in view of the film's circular ideology. What do I mean? Gattaca is an artful cry against mechanical perfection - it depicts a sterile society that values one's physical attributes over one's very humanity. Creating a child is much like shopping for a computer today: everybody wants the best ""specs"" - a genius mind and a perfect body are expected and selected for, while the naturally-born people face utmost prejudice. Given this premise, one would expect Gattaca to be a celebration of the unique human qualities - creativity, emotion, etc. Instead, Gattaca takes a completely reverse stance and starts celebrating the very qualities it condemns: the main hero, the ""In-Valid"" Vincent Freeman (woodenly acted by Ethan Hawke), clandestinely inserts himself into this perfect society almost solely because of his physical merits - his athleticism, his ability to type perfectly (I envy him), even the size of his private member. In several scenes scattered throughout the film Gattaca visually demonstrates Vincent's struggle - in the form of a swimming contest with his engineered brother. As expected, in the end Vincent wins, though precisely how he does this is unclear. Does ""Gattaca"" pose luck as the redeeming human element? I'd rather expected him to paint a masterpiece.
I already mentioned Ethan Hawke's slightly rigid acting. In a complete reversal, Vincent's partner in crime, Jerome Morrow, a paraplegic ""Valid"" whose identity Vincent buys, is brilliantly, sulkily acted by Jude Law. He delectably embodies defeated pride and arrogance - oh, how many people I've met that were so like him! On the other hand (Gattaca is a really mixed bag, isn't it?), Vincent's love interest Irene (Uma Thurman) just doesn't capture the reader's attention. Her acting is hardly off, but her part just doesn't seem central to the story's message, and Thurman is unable to make it into anything meaningful.
Sadly, ""Gattaca"" capitalizes on that tired Hollywood cliche of unattainable love - when the story is already rife with possible central themes. If told as a tale of the uneasy alliance between Vincent and Jerome that slowly grows into a brotherly affection, ""Gattaca"" would improve greatly.
The almost total absense of special effects does attract attention, but it's hardly a surprise: Gattaca is a story of interpersonal relationships, and as such doesn't require fancy graphical imagery. What's more surprising is that Hollywood actually summoned up the courage to produce such a visually unexciting film.
So, all in all, how did ""Gattaca"" manage to touch me as deeply as it did? It played on my innermost fear of all - that of being inadequate. That awful childhood feeling of being excluded from the general goings-on. Without this sort of viewer-film chemistry, I would hardly expect anyone to compose a favorable opinion of it.",994982400,,3034,5.1938775510204085

28330,4,0767805712,"Andrew Niccol, who wrote the screenplay for The Truman Show (1998), directs this superior sci-fi from his own script.  The result is a well-plotted, character-driven science fiction thriller for intelligent viewers, a pleasing combination of worthiness not always associated with the genre.  This is science fiction that will play with mainstream audiences as well as with afficionados.  From Michael Nyman's beautiful and complementary musical score to the clever opening credits in which the letter codes, ""g, a, t, c"" (for the chemical bases of DNA--thus the movie's title) shimmer and glow in the names of those credited, everything in the movie is professionally done.  There is little violence and virtually no sex.  I would say this is a perfect flick for the kids except for the embedded ""ads"" for cigarettes and booze that mar some of the early scenes.
Ethan Hawke stars as the genetically-challenged Vincent Freeman, an ""In-Valid"" conceived in the back seat of a Buick Riviera instead of through the fine art of the genetic engineers who now dominate society.  His dream is to go into space, but his genes, in this meritocracy based on genetic endowment, fit him only for cleaning the bathrooms.  Yet he has a monstrous drive to succeed, and when he strikes a deal with the genetically superior Jerome Morrow, a ""valid"" who is in a wheel chair with paralyzed legs, to use his identity, body fluids, hair samples and urine to fool the genetic screening devices of the Gattaca Aerospace Corporation, he is ready to fulfill his dream.
Uma Thurman plays his love interest.  Her statuesque beauty and her exotic features are perfect for the part of a futuristic babe in a retro fifties landscape of gray flanneled over achievers.  (Actually they aren't gray in dress, but in their uniform adherence to the corporate mentality.)  Jude Law as Jerome, the wheel-chair bound ""Valid,"" is perhaps the star performer, bringing subtlety and a bitter, but somehow uplifting verisimilitude to the role.  A puffed up Gore Vidal (who incidentally once wrote, ""after forty the death watch"") is Director Josef, and Alan Arkin is a street wise homicide investigator from another era.
The interesting question asked by this movie is, could a caste system based on genetic endowment be our future?  My vision of the future is that of a ""brown society"" in which everyone strives to be the same, but in which small subtle differences of appearance are increasingly appreciated.  If every movie star looked like, say Jennifer Lopez, however beautiful she is, I would nonetheless find particular delight in a Penlope Cruz or an occasional Reese Witherspoon.  This sort of pressure would keep some variety in the gene pool.  I also think that a society in which the genetic endowment of its members is too widely separated can only lead to class hatreds resulting in violent conflict and ultimately genocide, most likely by fiat, so that the survivors will be genetically rather similar.  Possibly humanoid types will be genetically engineered to do the baser work of society.  These creatures may be thought of as organic robots, not as bonafide members of society, thereby raising another question, what is it to be human?  A society greatly stratified in terms of wealth can exist, as the present society shows, but a society in which the difference between haves and the have-nots is too great is not stable and eventually leads to revolution (there being a limit to the number of people that can be put in prison).  Furthermore, as this movie suggests, just which qualities of character, appearance and/or ability are the most valuable?  And when such qualities become abundant, might we then have a need for other qualities now made scarce?  Finally, as is asked of the notion of I.Q: ""intelligence for what?""  Is it more powerful in an evolutionary sense to be ""intelligent"" or to be healthy?  Is it more adaptive to have a powerful drive to succeed, or a powerful urge to procreate?  Tough questions that the very talented Andrew Niccol might consider when making his next movie.",991612800,4,4070,4.995555555555556
28331,4,0767805712,"Set in the not-too-distant future, ""Gattaca"" stars Ethan Hawke as a young man named Vincent who was born to parents who turned down the option for genetic engineering.  As a result, Vincent is born with poor vision and suffers from many illnesses in his youth.  Vincent and others like him who were born without genetic tampering are labelled ""in-valid,"" making them ineligible for many opportunities in life such as the space program.  Desperate to become a part of space exploration, Vincent finds a sure way into the program after being introduced to the young man Jerome (wonderfully played by Jude Law), who, while not an ""in-valid,"" is confined to a wheelchair due to an accident.
The whole plot of the film centers on this question:  Will Vincent be able to rise through the program and make it into space before his real identity as an ""in-valid"" is discovered?  The film is a visual masterpiece.  You almost get the feeling that you're looking inside the mind of one of the writers from science fiction's Golden Age.  The settings remind me of Orwell's ""1984"" or Kafka's ""The Trial.""  You get the sense that you really are in the future, that none of this could exist in the present.  When it comes down to it, the film really uses few special effects.  The ones that are present are not useless eye-candy that most science-fiction films today feature.  The effects are only a backdrop for the story.  (Hear that, Hollywood?  The STORY is what's important!  Sorry...I feel better now!)  The story has several interesting subplots:  Vincent's relationships with Jerome, with his brother, and with a young girl at work played by Uma Thurman.  The murder of the director of the space program and the investigation that follows also brings in an added dimension.
The whole point of the film, stated in very simple terms:  You can live out your dreams even if everything is stacked against you.  To be honest, at first I was bothered that Vincent began to live out his dreams by cheating, but I realized that the conditions set up by the government also cheated.  To deny a person access to any goal or dream based on race, religion, genetics, or any other factor is a cheat from the start.  Vincent was smart enough to figure out a way to realize his dream.  And thankfully someone was smart enough to allow this picture to be made.  You leave the film with a lot to think about.  If science continues to progress at the current astonishing rate, we will be faced with some of the questions raised in ""Gattaca"" very soon.  Any film that causes you to think (a rarity these days) is well worth your time.",991526400,2,2608,4.679120879120879
28332,5,0767805712,"I don't know why I waited so long to see Gattaca, the blurb on the box just didn't reach out and grab me, but after seeing Dark City, I decided to take a chance on this movie too, and I'm glad I did.  Gattaca is like the thinking man's sci-fi, some of the possible mixed with some of the improbable, but wrapped up in such a way that you find yourself just accepting it, because you're drawn along on the story, and you don't really want to quibble over all the details.
 Ethan Hawke plays an in-valid(a natural born), who desires to go to space, but never will because he wasn't born a valid, one whose genes have been altered so that he will be perfect.  This setback doesn't stop him though, and through the help of a valid, portrayed by Jude Law, who was paralzyed by a car accident, he sets out to fool the top of the elite at the space company Gattaca, into thinking he is one of them.  The premise is an unusual one, but it works, because we are able to believe in the ability of Hawke to carry this masquerade off.
 Most of all the actors do a fine job here, I was impressed by Ethan Hawke's portrayal of the main character.  Jude Law, an actor I usually don't care for, also does an impressive job as the valid who doesn't really believe Hawke can carry this off, since he himself, a genetically altered man slated to win the gold medal in swimming at the olympics, could only win the silver.  It wouldn't be fair to mention the two men without also mentioning Uma Thurman, an actress I generally don't care for either, but who does a very good job in this movie.
 While I followed the flow of most of the movie, and could see the possibility of gene altering becoming feasible in the near future, the biggest problem I had with the movie was the investigation that took place after the murder take place in Gattaca.  The police seemed to be able to do whatever they wanted, stop anyone anywhere, and test their DNA.  It was never stated that in addition to science progressing so far that citizens had also lost some of their basic rights, and that the authorities were allowed to go anywhere they wanted and test anyone they felt like.  This seemed like the only real weak link in the story to me, but I let it slide since I was enjoying the overall aspect of the movie.
 So, at the very least I recommend that you rent this movie, and see for yourself how good it is.  I ended up buying it after I saw it, and if you're anything like me, I think you'll do the same.",990662400,2,2477,4.24468085106383

the film definitely has a point of view and gently pushes it's premise.  i, and friends of mine who had watched the film, found ourselves rethinking a few assumptions.  not a bad result for a hollywood film.

28347,5,0767805712,"Finally someone perfects the extremely tedious task of creating a high-quality science fiction movie. Flops in this genre are widespread, but Gattaca is supreme. Thought-provoking and infinitely profound this movie takes a look at a world run by genetecists, people bred to top quality to hone their talents (such as a six-fingered pianist). And always remember, ""Right-handed men don't hold it with their left.""",984182400,,412,5.453125
28348,4,0767805712,"Science Fiction is often sneered at by the pretentious amongst us. They claim it is mindless escapism and uses fantasy to disguise a lack of quality. ""Gattaca"" proves these sentiments to be false, once and for all. It is frighteningly believable in its technological and social predictions but still manages to tell an interesting story.
The film takes a firm stance on the issue of discrimination. The audience is left in no doubt as to  whether there is any form of ""fair"" discrimination, although, those of us who look a little more deeply will find a curious crutch in the logic. These days, the rallying cry against discrimination could be, ""The best person for the job."" It's hard to argue with that rule but Gattaca paints it in a new light. What if the ""best person"", was selected at birth, genetically engineered to perfection.
The central character in the film is a natural birth, a love child, an Invalid, named Vincent Freeman. The tone is set at the start of the film when he is born. After naively committing to a natural fertilisation, the Freemans are shocked to learn, from a post-natal genetic test, that their baby boy has a high probability of heart disease and an estimated life expectancy of 32 years. Learning of this imperfection the father decides to name him Vincent, reserving his own name, Anton, for their next child; a strapping boy designed to be strong, fast and smart. A son to be proud of.
In a fast vignette we see the consequences of this unequal birth on the older son. Vincent is smaller than his younger brother, weaker, near sighted and, most tellingly, is treated as if he is always sick  or too fragile to tackle any of life's ordinary adventures. His parents may have been indoctrinated to see him as a lesser human but the audience is not fooled. Vincent has passion, he has dreams and we don't need the swelling music to know that he is going to overcome his genetic handicap. Although the method he uses is surprising.
We've seen a lot of films about heroic figures fighting the injustices of race or sex discrimination but few heros simply cheat. I am sure their must have been Jews high up in the Nazi bureaucracy, who had to lie and hide in order to maintain their position, but I don't remember any stories about them. This is their story. Vincent takes on the identity of Jerome Morrow, one of the genetic elite, played superbly by Jude Law. Jerome, is perfect in every way, except for being crippled. His is an interesting character, just one of many in the film.
So Vincent, now Jerome, using borrowed blood and urine, follows his dream to become an astronaut. Employed by the space program after a very brief interview, consisting of one blood sample, he burrows into his new role and bides his time. He is meticulous in protecting his alias; going to the extent of vacuuming his dandruff off the keyboard and leaving false lint and hair around his workstation.
One week before he is due to launch there is a murder. One of the mission directors is beaten to death  and this brings the full weight of the law down onto the Centre. Sure enough, traces of an Invalid are found and Vincent becomes the focus of a massive manhunt. Luckily, everyone thinks Vincent is Jerome, even Irene his beautiful colleague, Uma Thurman, who is asked to assist the police with their investigation. As love interests go, Uma is always a good choice but her character is made especially interesting when we discover she hides a great shame; she has a small genetic flaw which makes her less than perfect.
There are many subtle tensions in Gattaca but overall the story is presented in broad strokes. The tag line for the film reads, ""There is no gene for the human spirit."" We believe this and can't help pulling for Vincent but the sad conclusion we are left with, is that perfection may be the ultimate prison. How can one find pride in life when everyone expects you to be perfect? As Director Josef says, ""No-one exceeds their potential.""",984182400,3,3976,4.652916073968705
28349,5,0767805712,"If you like inspirational movies with amazing characters  portrayed by incredible actors (Ethan, Jude and Uma;) complete with gorgeous cinematography and beautiful music, then I whole-heartedly recommend you buy GATTACA. This is one of my all-time favorite movies. This movie is compelling and completely engulfing to watch.
""They used to say that a child conceived in love has a greater chance of happiness--they don't say that anymore. Ten fingers, ten toes--that is all that used to matter--not now. Now only seconds old, the exact time and cause of my death was already known."" [This is referring to the main character Vincent/Ethan Hawke who later becomes Jerome, played by Jude Law.] Vincent was needless to say, an over-protected child due to his health conditions, especially his heart disorder which had a 99% probability of killing him prematurely.
When his parents are ready for ""a brother for him to play with"" they decide to use science and technology to their advantage and go to see a doctor/geneticist. They select hazel eyes, dark hair, fair skin, and ""extras"" such as no premature baldness or tendencies to violence or obesity. The parents ask if they should leave a few things to chance but the geneticist convinces them otherwise explaining by saying: ""keep in mind, this child is still you--the BEST of you. You could conceive naturally 1000 times and never get such a result."" So the parents trust the geneticist and Anton is born-- a child finally worthy in the father's opinion, of his [the father's] name. But do ""perfect"" genes make one ""perfect""? I love the way GATTACA makes the viewer think about this throughout the movie.
VINCENT: ""I don't know how to thank you.""
JEROME:  ""I got the better end of the deal. I only lent you my body; you lent me your dream.""
GATTACA in my opinion, proves that indeed ""there is no gene for fate"" and that the human spirit is stronger than any genetic code.",983836800,9,1919,4.883435582822086
28350,4,0767805712,"For the most part this is a pretty interesting movie, despite the fact that there is little of the action and (especially) special effects that most people expect from the science fiction genre. It involves a future in which eugenics is the norm and genetically perfect children (great looking, superbly healthy, highly intelligent, no acne) are produced to become an elite of athletes, engineers or astronauts, while people conceived under more normal circumstances (i.e. after a night of hot passion), become janitors. ""Gattaca"" is thus something of a philosophical discussion about how far humanity's ability to control nature should go and what the consequences may be. This description may make it sound a bit dull, but the movie is well-made with a good cast, so the story moves along. The movie's alluring, moody atmosphere is very captivating as well. My only problem with it is that the central character (played by Ethan Hawke), not a product of genetic engineering, is *so* imperfect: he has lousy vision, a congenitally weak heart and a 30-year life expectancy, even though he had two perfectly healthy parents. This stark contrast between genetically engineered and ""normal"" people is grossly overdone to create more dramatic effect, but it's not very believable and it takes away from the entire story. ""Gattaca"" might have been a more interesting and challenging movie if the central character was only a little less perfect than his genetically engineered peers - then one could truly question why he is the subject of blatant discrimination.",981676800,3,1558,5.186507936507937

Vincent (Ethan Hawke) illegally assumes the identity of a genetic ""superman"" (crippled in an accident) in order to become a space pilot, rather than scrub floors for the rest of his life.  Those two characters couldn't be more opposite.  One has the ""wrong"" genes; the other has the right ones but no ambition.
The acting is excellent, particularly that of underrated Ethan Hawke and Jufe Law.  The whole style is chrome retro-70s and 80s, especially the homes and social centres of the genetic elite. Add a dash of mystery and suspense, for an excellent movie.  The technology of _Gattaca_ is inconsistent, such as manned Titan probes along with 1990s computers.  Another example is medical technology able to predict lifespans from a drop of blood, but not fix a broken spine.  That last one may be deliberate, and if so, another sad comment on that society and its priorities.

Recently, there have been some serious ethical concerns raised about human genomes and cloning which this movie addresses. What if you could screen out negative genes, such as bad eyesight or hair loss, and breed the perfect child. Would you? The director really gives you something to think about.
And the acting in Gattaca is first rate. How Jude Law wasn't nominated for an Oscar for his role of Eugene 'the Valid' is beyond me but then again most things are. And Pulp Fiction babe Uma Thurman adds glamor to the stiff Ethan Hawke.
The reason I think this movie has become so popular is that movies these days are repetitive. All those mindless action movies where stuff gets blown up every two seconds drive me crazy. That's why when something different comes along, like Gattaca, people tune in.

Its strength is in the simplicity of its premise, and its subtle suggestion of a future at only a slight remove from our own. The acting is low-key, and the emotional tenor of the film is highly controlled, so a lot of the emotion the story makes us feel is internalized --- we feel Vincent's frustration at the glass ceiling dashing his hopes and ambitions, as well as the fabulous Jude Law's guilt and self-recrimination for having had everything going for him, yet failing to achieve. The musical score heightens the story, and lends it a haunting sense of deep sadness at the state to which the world has succombed. There are no special effects --- there is only the here and now, and this movie seems to have timeless things to say about the individual's refusal to be boxed in, and the impossibility of predicting human fate and destiny.

These characters all have several things in common. 1) They are all very Cool, 2) All were supporting characters (as opposed to the stars) of their particular story, 3) All were the only Cool characters in their story.
Number three is the thing that really made them work. It is a proven fact that people like ""the cool character"" and so many times a writer of a book or a movie or a television show or even professional wrestling tries to make all the characters ""cool."" But when every character is a cold, stoic, cigarette smoking SOB with a killer instinct, the effect is diminished. This is the major problem with the movie Gattaca.
One could theorize that Writer/Director Andrew Niccol was trying to make a statement about the loss of humanity that occurs in a world built on gene-gineered perfection. But if this is the case, then the metaphor never really materializes. Instead we have a film where all the characters are so cool... so intense... that it is hard to actually identify with any of them. Again, it could be argued that this is intentional, but somehow, I feel as though my inability to truly identify with Ethan Hawke's Vincent character removes something from my enjoyment of the film.
That said, I must admit that I did enjoy Gattaca. For starters, the film is simply breathtakingly beautiful. Furthermore, the concept behind the film is very ambitious and Niccol exploration of the idea is very concise and complete. The ideas generated by the questions this movie asks can provide the viewer with philosophical musings for the rest of the evening.
The lead actors, Ethan Hawke and Uma Thurman (not to mention supporting actors Jude Law and Loren Dean) provide no shortage of eye-candy for male of female viewers. One cannot find a fault in Hawke's acting in this film (or Thurman's to be fair) so much as with the characters they were portraying.
The tragedy of this film is that there could have been a beautiful love story here. But the characters are so cold that it is hard to see why Irene (Thurman) and Vincent (Hawke) would fall for each other at all. The only truly attractive quality either displays is unbelievable drive.
Despite its faults, this film is still somewhat recommended. The cinematography is excellent and the ideas presented are so insightful that I can look past the faults of the movie enough to give it 3 stars.",978307200,6,2538,4.757369614512472

28360,4,0767805712,"Here is an actor who is not wasting his time making junk and playing roles beneath his level of talent.  Hawke is consistently picking one intelligent screenplay after another for his leading man vehicles.  So it is gratifying to view one of the most intelligent sci-fi films that I've seen in a long time.  I like sci-fi films but there sure is a lot of junk out there. The premise is ingenious.  Hawke was conceived the old fashioned way, in the back seat of a car without his parents using any genetic planning.  Hence, when he is tested for his genetic makeup, flaws are detected that have been engineered out of humans, including a predicted early death by heart disease.  Hawke is fated to become a garbage man because of this deficiency when he wants to be a space explorer.  Where there's a will, there's a way.

Jude Law plays a paraplegic who donates his genetic material to Hawke so that he can take his identity and get to space.  There is also a romance with Uma Thurman, who Hawke romanced in real life as a result of this movie and then married.  She comes across about the same as usual, which is lovely and articulate.  However, her performance seems stuck on one note with little variation, my usual complaint regarding her performances.  Thus, this did not knock me out as a love story.  That's the only reason this is not a 5 star movie.  The sci-fi aspects are all excellent though.  Hubby, who could care less about the so-so romance aspects, gives it a solid 5.  This is also a visually gorgeous film.  A future world is believably created and it is both stunning and frightening.  Although special effects were used in this, I was not noticing each and every one of them.  This is a compliment; when I am noticing, the magic of filmmaking is not working.

28361,5,0767805712,"Andrew Niccol does a very special kind of science fiction. He doesn't make stories about machines or technologies, but about how people are affected by these things. ""Gattaca"" is a very special example of this concept. Genetic engineering is a huge subject in the moment wich we are changing of the century and the millennium. In this movie we see what could happen to us if this technology is used in a stupid way. How many kids would not even be born, how many dreams could never happen? What it tries to show is that even the most handicapped person can do special physical and mental feats. And that is what Vincent, the central character, does. Being a natural born human (made naturally, with no genetic corrections in his DNA) technically, he can't compete with his enhanced contenders. So he can't get a good job and then he can't fulfill his dearest dream: travel through space. So what he does is cheat. He cheats the whole system and get a job, using genetic samples from an enhanced guy. But when someone is found murdered, Vincent turns out to be the number one suspect. Using this plot, Niccol manages to tell a touching story about friendship, love, ethics, and about how far can someone go for a dream. And how people can ignore genetic determinism and make a difference. In the DVD, there is an optional endind that shows how many important people from humanity's history could not have been born if genetic detreminism happened before. Even though Niccol manipulates the plot too much to prove his points of view, the movie, the acting and the great end, make you think about the subjects raised by this movie for a long time.

28363,5,0767805712,"Gattaca is not for hard-core sci-fi fans.  There are no alien monsters, no Darth Vaders.  Instead it is a movie about us.  The plot is set in the future to provide an extrapolation of the perceived present.  The world of Gattaca is more soulless, more class polarised, less humane than our own.  It casts a harsh light on today's social mores.
Ethan Hawke and Jude Law are both superb in their roles.  Their characters reflect the flaws in Gattaca's (and our) society - Jude, the gilded but gelded; and Ethan, the flawed but unflinching.
The direction, musical score and cinematography all work to provide the brutal truth behind the polished surfaces of Gattaca.
If you see Gattaca looking for Han Solo or Lt. Ripley you will be disappointed.  See it instead for a new perspective on how to live your own life.",973900800,,811,4.669014084507042

The ethical and social arguments are valid ( no pun intended ) but I was dissapointed in its lack of action, lack of sci-fi imagery and morose backround music. At times it is little more than a detective story, or a human interest drama. The film needed more excitement and much more creative imagery.

28366,3,0767805712,"Unlike many reviewers, I was disappointed in this film.  The film's central myth is the struggle of the individual human will against a Procrustean, deterministic society, which has been one of the most popular myths in Western literature for the past five thousand years.  To be successful, a treatment must add something to this myth.  Other than the wrinkle on genetic engineering, which is old hat in SF, Gattaca adds very little.
The film is stylish, to be sure.  This sometimes works and sometimes does not.  The idea that astronauts will wear business suits when strapped into acceleration couches strains credulity at best.  The acting is mostly competent but is directed to be so utterly flat in affect that one wonders why anybody in this future society would care about anything.  The exposition is constructed mostly of cliches and is predictable from beginning to end.  One of the cliches, a bone-clever gumshoe played wonderfully by Alan Arkin, provides a good contrast but seems entirely out of place--would such a society even permit people like this to occupy positions of authority?
Gattaca is a film that shows promise for a new director, but it doesn't quite make it.",971308800,4,1187,4.98984771573604

Gattaca is so strong a movie that I cringe when I see it on the sci-fi shelf at the video store. Like ""The talented Mr. Ripley"", the movie deals with assuming the identity of another. Odd that in both films those characters are played by Jude Law. Gattaca is sparse with special effects, but where they are needed, they are used effectively. The plot is as compelling as any I've seen in years. Great casting and the director sets the perfect mood. I saw not a single misstep with this rare, fine ""sci-fi"" film.

The setting  is beautifully done, every image gives you the idea you're living in a  stylish new society, as if your looking at the designs for the image of our  own future.
Everything is big, yet the characters remain small and still  interesting enough to carry the story. In the world of Gattaca you are a  mere number, but in this impersonal world you actually see that the  characters are not all robots in a society that has made rules by which all  must live, but individuals that wish to break those rules and find their  own personality in an endless sea.

28392,2,0767805712,"I love intelligent sci-fi films, and so I watched Gattaca with high  expectations.  It wasn't terrible; in fact, to squeeze two stars out of me  says a lot.  But first let's look at the ""thriller"" plot every  other reviewer seems to applaud.  Who's kidding whom?  The heroine  deliberately plants a clue that would lead to the hero's arrest--the same  chap she's falling in love with.  Why?  I can't think of a single reason,  except to set up an artificial plot.  Later she's ""relieved"" that  our hero ""didn't do it.""  Well, by then I was hoping he had done  it; it would have at least justified her otherwise wholly irrational  attempt to frame him.  OK, so there's no plot here.  What else?  Characterization?  Hardly.  It's set up as a story between two brothers,  but the middle of the movie wanders around without addressing that story.  Only at the beginning and end do we see that it's a story about two  brothers who are rivals.  Big deal--it doesn't help the movie along.  I  think anyone who believes this is an ""intelligent"" sci-fi movie  must have viewed it with commercial interruptions throughout, because it  has the look and feel of a movie that only makes sense in short bites.  Maybe the commercials added to the futuristic quality of the movie.  (Some  future--although we have space travel, the people are still driving mid-90s  automobiles.  (Actually, it was a low budget film, so we can't expect much  in the way of realism.  But even in Woody Allen's low-budget  ""Sleeper,"" the transport vehicles were at least Cute.  Isn't it  strange that there are movies out there that are so underrated that they  have to become ""cult favorites"" before the mainline critics take  notice of them (and then adopt them as their own!), while there are some  movies--Gattaca is one of them--that for whatever reason was hugely  overrated.  Bottom line: it's not bad, you might enjoy it, and if you go in  expecting zero, you might be moderately surprised on the upside.",965260800,8,1977,4.767164179104477
28393,5,0767805712,"In a perfectionist near-future wherein biotechnology has trumped natural selection, de""gene""erate Vincent refuses to know his genetic place-that of a flawed, second class drone, meant only to labor lowly and  die. He painfully, eventually, realizes his celestial dream and leaves  beind the oppression of his world. But let's set aside the obvious  Hitlerian overtones and wonder if perhaps genetic engineering-resulting in  a theoretically improved being-isn't something to be cautiously welcomed as  part of the inevitable, ever-evolving Darwinian process that is, after all,  the human condition. This very intelligent film chooses to look at the dark  side of genetics, only grudgingly acknowedging its potential to perhaps  advance human progress light years beyond what it otherwise could. The  acting is uniformly excellent and the art direction is beautifully minimal  and elegant. Not to be missed by fans of provocative science fiction  (fact?)",964483200,3,954,5.742857142857143
28394,5,0767805712,"Gattaca's most haunting and beautiful scene is a love scene, shot through an upside down camera in room with transparent walls. In the metallic, clinical and angular world of this film physical love is unnatural. Sex is  an impulsive passionatte act and therefore not intune with the perfection  of an intelligent, balanced, stoic and ultimately robotic populace.  Afterall the person you're with could take a hair off your head, take it to  a shop down the street and see if you are a ""valid"" person.
  Vincent (Ethan Hawke) has never accepted the fact that because he was a  natural, faith birth, he could never persue his dream about going to  outerspace. He meets a ""valid"", genetically perfect Jerome (Jude  Law) who despite the previlage of genetic perfection is paralysed.  ""There is no gene for fate"" Hawke observes in his moving  unintrusive narration. Jerome agrees to lend him is indentity, and in  return Vincent will help him maintain his affluent lifestyle. This switch,  along with a murder plot would be enough to make a decent thriller, but  Gattaca only use this to hook the audience. Both Hawke and Law give the  best performance of their careers in these roles. And although I could  praise Gattace as one of the best sceince-fiction films I've ever seen,  calling it sceince-fiction seems like a stretch.
  In the near future,  doctors will be able to extract the best possible child from a man and a  woman. As a doctor explains to the parents in this film, ""You could  concieve naturally a 1000 times and never get such result, this child is  you, simply the best of you"". You can't argue with a line that, and  I'm sure given the opportunity, most parents would choose to have their  children disease free, but it would never stop there. How about physical  fitness, good looks, a high I.Q., wouldn't you want to give your children  all these things. It is that age old arguement of man playing God, what is  particularly tragic about it these days is its inevitability. You can't  stop scientist from creating alternative organs for transplant, and you  can't stop them trying to wipe out cancer gentically. Afterall these are  good things, paradoxically they will almost certainly be abused. Even in  the world of Gattace ""discrimination is illigal"", but that  doesn't stop the firm from using a urine sample as their interview.  Sceince, humanity's great shining light will also be its downfall. Opposing  sceince is undoubtly bigotry, all you can do is watch as we drift into  Orwell's 1984.
  As you may have guessed, this is a deeply provocative  and timely film. It is also an intensly passionate one. In the history of  film music, only Ennio Morricone's music for 1986's The Mission can compare  with the emotional impact of Michael Nyman's score for Gattaca.  Periodically his lyrical, etheral, almost mournful score is played over  scenes making the film an emotional rollercoaster ride. There is a scene  played under Nyman's music where Vincent and his girlfriend Irene (Uma  Thurman) go to look at a field of Solar Cells. The Cells are the plants of  the future, when the sunshines they bloom. Although they are magnificent,  unlike the plants they don't need you to water them.
  Gattaca is a  magnificent and overlooked film. Essentially optimistic in its view that  determination can truimph over any genetic pre-conditioning, I think its is  actually more ambigious and wiser then its outcome suggests. It suggests  that you may have to leave this planet to escape the clinical prejudice.  But if you don't have a space ship to get on, then leaving can only mean  one thing.

GATTACA is a story about human identity: losing it, finding it, and changing it.  Although the story is set in the future, you can actually relate to it and its characters. You'd better relate, if you don't want to end up in the world of GATTACA. In a sence, however, we already live in this world, according to this film's message.
The cinematography creates a futuristic feeling, without any special effects.  Uma Thurman is already a good start for a science fiction film.  I think, she IS futuristic.  Ethan Hawke and Jude Law worked well together (much better than Matt Damon and Jude Law in ""Talented Mr. Ripley""). I don't want to give away the plot but you will be surprised, I guarantee.
Despite its harshness, GATTACA, gives viewers certain hope at the end.  GATTACA is an intriguing, intelligent, and original film.  A Cinematic Treat!",960854400,3,992,4.766081871345029

However, there were a few parts in the movie that  were a bit shaky, and didn't seem to make a lot of sense, but those moments  were rare.  The acting was very good; I think Ethan Hawke played his role  to near-perfection. One of the most stunning aspects of this film is not  the actors, but their surroundings.

Human spirit triumphs again.  The movie doesn't have  to be about genetics, all though that does add some incredibly interesting  ideas. The main idea is that the physical limitations we face are about 1  percent of all of our limitations.  The rest are mental.  People didn't  even see his face.  All people ever saw was his chart.  They didn't care  how hard he worked.  They looked for the things that were simple to  categorize and discriminate against.  The real dilema in life is just that.  Racism, facism, and favoritism are all a part of this.  People look for  the easiest way to deal with each other.  If they can find a reason not to  deal with each other they will use it.  Vincent rejected the worst kind of  discrimination - the kind in which people hardly even recognize one's  existence.  He refused to be nobody.  His physical limitations may well  have caused an early death.  That was not the point of the movie.  Vincent  proved that everyone has a right to enjoy life to the best of his or her  abilities.  People can pick at this movie all they want, but I have never  seen a movie that so fully captures the indominable nature of the human  spirit as does this.",957484800,5,1355,4.409836065573771

Long after the film had disappeared from cineplexes, as a  matter of fact.  When it came out on video, I rented it several times until  this wonderful DVD came out.  Of course I snapped it up, and continue to  watch it regularly.  I used to think it was just me, until I read some of  the reviews posted here.  Happily, I am not alone in thinking that this  film is an underrated classic. Writer-Director Andrew Niccol weaved a  thrilling, emotional and totally involving tale of the effects of genetic  engineering. Ethan Hawke, an underrated actor who never fully gets his  props, gives a deeply-felt, measured performace as the genetically  ""imperfect"" hero. Uma Thurman gives a strong performance as well,  and Jude Law is an absolute kick (and steals most of his scenes) in a  supporting role any actor would relish.

I agree with another reviewer of this film - I  think this is future science-fact... you can make genetic manipulation as  illegal as you like, but  those with a genetic advantage at birth will  always have an advantage in life, and once one country begins to use the  ability to create super-humans (and it'll happen somewhere eventually), the  rest of the world must inevitably follow if only to compete, or condemn its  people to being inferior and seeing them left behind.

The stylish look and feel of the movie, with its cool locations  set in the not-too-distant future, nevertheless feel very real; indeed the  whole premise feels entirely possible.  Jude Law, lately of The Talented  Mr. Ripley, is simply spectacular in a role that requires an actor of great  power.  I never understood why this film did not do much better in its  initial release; it is a science fiction film with a heart and a brain,  more in the realm of Contact.  And the Michael Nyman musical score (The  Piano)underscores the proceedings with an intensely melancholy theme,  punctuating the sadness and triumphs of people not too different from  ourselves caught in a world that seems to have forgotten what makes humans  human.",947721600,21,879,5.148936170212766

It quietly and with great intensity, shows what can be  done with conviction. This film takes what may be a horrifying idea to the  layman and gives it humanity. GATTACA requires you also have the ability to  think. If you want to be spoon-fed sci-fi, this may not be the movie for  you. You can embrace this technology and learn about it, or you can hide  from it and listen to the opinions of others. Either way, GATTACA, here we  come.",946339200,,596,4.422018348623853

Andrew Niccol wrote a very smart movie, and I wouldn't be surprised if someday the world is the way he pictures it in Gattaca  (clever title, I agree--g,a,t,and c are the letters of the genetic code).  Great performances from Ethan Hawke, Uma Thurman, Jude Law, and all the  cast, really.  This movie is not only smart and involving, it is starkly  beautiful, and also has an incridibly gorgeous score by the very talented  Michael Nyman.",945907200,,532,4.717391304347826

28429,5,0767805712,"It seems as if our society is doomed and destined to the society of Gattaca. It is important that we do not let others be treated like the in-valids were. This thriller is a wake up call of how not to be as a  society.  Ethan Hawke plays an extraordinary performance as Vincent, an  in-valid human that takes on a valid(Jude Law) identity. This film can show  what can be done by the human spirit,and how important to not let the world  put limits on a person.

28430,5,0767805712,"Like all sci fi films, GATTACA asks ""what if?"" The answer can be startling. The most thought provoking film in years asks and poses many questions on the dawn of the coming age of genetics. The beauty of this  film is it is a very thought provoking film. It makes you think, ""if  the gene that holds the characteristic of homosexuality can be identified,  will parents opt to abort the unborn baby with the hopes of a heterosexual  child being conceived next?""
Besides all of the socio-political  elements in the film, GATTACA is beautifully photographed and the film  score is even more beautiful.
GATTACA is well worth the purchase. It is a  film that can be viewed over and over. My only criticism of the film is  that of the relationship of the two brothers needed a little more  deveoping. But still a great film.",944524800,4,818,4.586206896551724

It's the story of a young man going after his dreams even  though his family and society have given up on him.  It's also the story of  another young man plagued by perfection.  The DVD shows a few cut scenes.  Many great themes in this film.  Who knows what the future will be like?

For example, one viewer mentioned the room full of people blindingly typing while looking at a prerendered navigation on screen. The composition of each  scene in this movie is a truly artistic expression in communicating the  message that the film is trying to convey. (i.e. The robotic valids with no  feelings or expressions simply typing away at their ""work""  without thought to anything or anyone.)
This film is nothing but  brilliant. Like all films, it has its flaws here and there, but when you  see it, watch for the brilliant setup and effectiveness of the design in  every scene. It's a shame that the DVD didn't include the making of  originally aired when this movie came out. It adds so much to the  understanding. (Especially the DNA Staircase among other things). I can't  complain about the transfer of this film for it was perfect. Ditto for  sound.
If you really enjoy intelligent and artistic cinema, then buy this  DVD. You'll really appreciate it. But if you're looking for sci-fi  thrilling eye candy, look elsewhere. Enjoy.",937872000,4,1107,4.918918918918919
28435,2,0767805712,"I must say I wasn't too optimistic when I rented this movie, but i didn't expect it to be this bad. The production desing is good and the actors are allright, but the script is pretty horrible. For instance, what's that that  those guys do in that room tapping computers keyboards ramdomly while  watching a pre-rendered 3D animation of a space flight? And how is that  we're able to flight really far away in space and have machines that can  read the whole ADN map in seconds and we're still unable to cure a broken  back? I could go on the 1000 words limit of this review telling all the  easily spotting fails of the really weak script but I don't want to spoil  the movie to those who hasn't seen it. It's an OK movie to hire on a boring  Sunday afternoon or to watch it on cable, but believe me, if you're  intelligent enough to notice that Episode I has quite a flop script you'll  regret buying this. P.S: The only really good thing is the las of the  deleted scenes",936230400,3,974,4.26775956284153

Can you imagine, that you or  your future friend will be born out to this world out of the test-tube? I  can't...
Strange thing: while watching this, from one hand movie about  the future, you feel the 70's-80's. You hear classics, see the old cars  (working on the electric power..hehe) and the men and women, wearing the  clothes of that time.

Sort of like Fifth Element or Judge Dredd, Those movies not only sucked but  you really did not care what happened to the characters because it was a  sci-fi movie. Gattaca is NOT like that. It takes place in a future not to  distant where everything that happens is very damn possible within the next  50-100 years. So you sit there in disbelief at how *f'd* up that future is.  I think this movie deserves to be seen by everyone with any type of  intelligence to understand where our society is going.",926467200,,637,4.495652173913044
28439,4,0767805712,I think that Gattica had a great plot and was very realistic.  Unlike some science fiction films which are very unrealistic.  I don't like movies where you can spot the benting of the laws of phisics (no I am NOT a nerd  its just annoying) also it wasn't about space wars it was a underprivleged  person who does what he can to accomplish his dream.

28440,4,0767805712,"It's too bad that the movie previews (trailers) didn't do a better job selling this fine piece of work.  There are shades of Orwell's ""1984"" running throughout this picture, and some of the science `fiction' has  already been realized.  And what hasn't, is so obviously just around the  corner.  Its basic plot is about haves and have-nots, called `valids' and  `in-valids' respectively.  A child who has been altered genetically (and to  be as near perfect as possible) is a valid, while a child who hasn't been  altered is an in-valid.  The story centers on two brothers, one a valid and  one an in-valid.  We follow the in-valid as he strives to enter into a  secured space program that is only eligible for the valids.  What he has to  go through to keep his secret puts the viewer on the edge of his seat.  The  stark cinematography enhances the entire film.  Although a few events  seemed contrived and there were a couple of plot holes that one had to  gingerly step over, all-in-all it was a thoroughly enjoyable experience.  Between 1 and 10, ""Gattaca"" gets a solid 8.  I wish more sci-fi films could  be done as intelligently as this one.  There wasn't a ray-gun in sight!",923702400,,1182,4.62621359223301
28441,4,0767805712,"This superb near-future science fiction piece offers the perfect antidote to the tired, ""cyberpunk"", post-apocalyptic view usually taken by writers when predicting future society.  Set in ""the not-too-distant  future"" - a technologically advanced yet stylistically fifties world -  the film portrays the social consequences of today's genetic research  carried forward to extremes. Society has become divided; a new underclass  created not according to race, sex, or financial means but ""bad""  genetic material - those born ""on faith"" rather than being  genetically engineered to their parents' specifications.  Gattaca tells  the story of Vincent, one of the so-called ""In-valids"" who has  the willpower to succeed in life but is oppressed because he is genetically  inferior.  To achieve his goal of joining the Gattaca space corporation and  travelling into space he assumes the identity of a ""Valid"" -  Eugene - by fooling the all-pervading genetic testing machines with samples  of his blood, urine, skin and hair.  Eugene - who seems to have every  advantage in life - is bitter because he lacks the drive to use his gifts  to the full, and is now crippled after a failed attempt at suicide. The  film's overriding feature is the palpable tension created as Vincent must  hide every trace of his being from those investigating a crime committed in  his workplace - the attention to detail is superb. Overall, a thoughtful -  if a little extreme - treatment of genetic research and the importance of  the intangible aspects of the being as opposed to quantifiable features.",922838400,14,1578,5.224
28442,5,0767805712,"Unlike most other sci-fi films, Gattaca presents itself to the viewer in an extraordinarily mellow fashion. A thought-provoking tale of genetic discrimination in a near-future society, Gattaca seems very much to flow  like a liquid over its audience. With exceptional production design (I  especially liked Uma Thurman's mid-sixties vintage Citroen DS-21  convertible!), affecting performances, and gorgeous music, Gattaca paints a  very convincing picture of a not-too-distant and not altogether implausible  society. Kudos to first-time director Andrew Niccol and veteran composer  Michael Nyman. (If you are a fan of film music, pick up the score to this  film - it contains some of the most stirring yet relaxing themes this  reviewer has ever heard.)",922406400,,755,5.619469026548672
28443,5,0767805712,"Gattaca reminds me of a long past era of movies like ""Logan's Run"".  Science fiction movies of that era always delt with humanity attempting to use technology to make life appealing and comfortable.  In  this the individual and his/her humanity is lost to the technology.  ""Gattaca"" is similar in that we see the use of genetic  manipulation to rigidly organize society in hopes of finding the best  possible people for certain jobs.  While this may be an attractive option  for many people, as the movie shows, it can lead to aa quasi-fascist  society where the right of a person to determine his/her future is lost.  Control for all intents and purposes is given to the state.  In our society  to day we are begining to be faced with a similar choice.  Which one will  we make?",922060800,,779,4.632352941176471
28444,4,0767805712,"I have seen the movie Gattaca, and I have many things to say about it.  First of all, this movie portrays that science ""plays God"" if we let technology go so far that we are living in a semi-communist world based  on genetics.  For example, people who are ""invalids,"" or those  who were not genetically enhanced before birth, and born ""the old  fashion way,"" shows how discriminatory perfectionists can be.  People  are way to obsessed with people being all they can be.  Don't get me wrong.  I think that it's great for everyone to have a purpose in life and live up  to cure a disease or travel to mars, but discrimition is where the whole  system goes to hell.  This movie did an excellent job of portraying  what actually might become of us if we litterally go through everything  with a fine tooth comb, only to pick out invalids.  We should learn from  this movie to integrate the less fortunate with the not-so-fortunate, and  that's how we can build a better world.",918864000,,973,4.531791907514451

28446,5,0767805712,"With ""Gattaca"", screenwriter and director Andrew Niccol has created a dystopia to rival ""1984"", ""Brave New World"", ""THX 1138"", and ""Logan's Run"". Its sterile,  genetically-tailored brilliance is all the more terrifying when we realize  very few of us living now could hope to achieve anymore than servitude to  its ""ubermensche"", because of our genetic  ""inadequacies"".But with Vincent Freeman, the film's protagonist,  we have cause for hope against such an ignoble fate. Although he is like  us, (that is, naturally-born), Vincent, using only the borrowed genetic  pattern and identity of an engineered athlete, pursues his dream of going  into space (a career reserved only for the enhanced) with his own  untailored brain, physique and will. Thus, we see how human desire can  overcome even a society's dictate of perfection. Vincent joins such famous  fictional rebels as Winston Smith, Bernard Marx, THX 1138, and Logan 6 in  this noble effort. Ethan Hawke, Uma Thurman, Jude Law, Lorne Dean, Alan  Arkin, Gore Vidal, and Ernest Borgnine all play their parts with subtlety  and depth with Niccol's exquisite screenplay and direction. The film's  look, stark and elegant, is a visual feast. The photography is gorgeous,  wholly capturing the society's brittle beauty. As science fiction at its  finest, ""Gattaca"" is a film that not only causes you to wonder  about what is possible, but also to fear what may be coming.",912297600,10,1424,5.225663716814159
