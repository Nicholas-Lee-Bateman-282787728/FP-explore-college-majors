5117963,5,B0081HP71Q,Close to my heart...grew up in the country and I miss nighttime darkness.  The arguments made in the documentary make good sense and some of the solutions presented are inspiring.,1372982400,,179,4.966666666666667
5117964,5,B0081HP71Q,"Okay, so the pun was intended. Great documentary about the effects of Light pollution. Highly recommend this if you're at all concerned about the industrial ""progress"" our species is making",1371081600,2,189,5.333333333333333
5117965,5,B0081HP71Q,Do we miss the stars? This wonderful film attempts to answer. A cast of colorful characters discuss their attachment to the night sky and what we are losing through light pollution. This is what a good documentary is like. Even the music is great.,1365984000,2,247,4.636363636363637
5117966,5,B0081HP71Q,"As an avid Stargazer, this documentary certainly brings to light (no pun intended) the serious consequences
of the effects of light pollution.  The loss of the night for city dwellers is truly sad!
We certainly would reap the benefits of having more youngsters exposed to the wonders of the night sky!",1363651200,,301,4.901960784313726
5117967,5,B0081HP71Q,"I saw this at a film festival and immediately loved it. Not only an extremely interesting and relatively unique focus, this documentary was also very well made, with great music and cinematography. I later found it on PBS, but only available to stream for a short time. As soon as I found it on DVD here, I bought it without hestitation!",1359244800,3,337,4.540983606557377
5117968,5,B0081HP71Q,"This is a wonderful documentary on the problems of light pollution across our country. My son works for the Night Sky project through the National Park Service in Fort Collins, CO. It is a serious problem. Rare to find a beautiful black sky at nite.",1357948800,5,249,4.555555555555555
5117969,5,B0081HP71Q,"Ok, so as an amateur stargazer I'm a bit biased, but this is an excellent and much needed documentary on the subject of ""light pollution"". It doesn't just cover the astronomical aspects, but also the impacts of artifical light on wildlife and human health.",1356912000,5,256,4.840909090909091
5117970,5,B0081HP71Q,"I first saw this on PBS and was blown away by the effects of light pollution on people, birds, and other species of animals.
It is so important to view this. Lighting can be placed  to shine downward to light the way of a person walking but not obstruct the view of the sky by someone else. We all can make a difference and save energy by viewing this documentary I cannot recommend it enough. I purchased several copies to give as gifts, keeping one for myself.",1348358400,9,462,4.310344827586207
5117971,5,B0081HP71Q,"As a dark-sky activist who has viewed this documentary 3 times, I can tell you Ian Cheney did a great job introducing the issues and research of light pollution with ""The City Dark"".  It is possible be restore starlight even over a city.  The biggest obstacle is public awareness.  So do your part!  View and share!",1348012800,8,315,4.571428571428571
5117972,5,B0081HP71Q,"I saw this documentary in NYC and I'm purchasing the DVD because this is one of the most important topics this century and it simply isn't discussed enough. Darkness is a gift and we don't look up often enough.  I just started getting interested in astronomy last year and when I saw this movie I was so shocked to learn what light pollution is doing to bird migration and our health as human beings (in addition to not being able to see as many stars). On the flip side, the ""safety"" of light needed to be addressed in this movie... and it was. We can find a common ground between ""safety"" and ""healthy"" in darkness, it just depends where you live. Very well done, bravo!",1343779200,13,672,4.376
5117983,5,B0081HP71Q,Everyone should see this!  Under reported story of the encroaching problem on light pollution.  Great for schools.  Well packaged; arrived promptly.,1412726400,,148,5.9523809523809526
5117984,5,B0081HP71Q,"Neil DeGrass Tyson and Ann Druyan join in this compelling documentary about light pollution. In many respects, light pollution resembles the campaign against smoking in the 1960s.  We are now seeing irrefutable evidence that wasteful lighting of our highways, parks, and private homes harms human health as well as our environment.  We are about to see a growing moving to replace ""glare bombs"" with fully shielded lighting.",1404345600,,424,5.313432835820896
5117985,5,B0081HP71Q,This is a great film; I first watched it at the Princeton Environmental Film Festival (and met Ian Cheney too!).,1399852800,,112,4.65
5117986,5,B0081HP71Q,"This is an interesting and well made movie.  It takes a rather simple topic (light pollution) and introduces you to numerous stories and people with connections to the topic.  Unlike so many documentaries made today with a political axe to grind, it does not hammer on you endlessly with an air of sanctimony and POV superiority to the point of causing you to doubt the facts presented.  Maybe it is the topic, but it is nice to see a documentary made with a subtle presentation.",1396224000,,479,4.6117647058823525
5117987,5,B0081HP71Q,Bought this book for my college-age Engineering student and read it myself as well.  I can see why Dr. Tyson is such a favorite of the science/technology/engineering student set.  Complicated subject simplified so that it can be understood by all.  I think Dr. Tyson picks out some of the most relevant portions of each subject he discusses.,1388620800,,341,4.947368421052632
5117988,5,B0081HP71Q,"The beautiful thing about dark sky conservation is that its win-win: we can have our light and our dark sky too. Advances in lighting choices enable us to put light only where we need it, saving us money, leaving the dark for the night creatures and preserving our connection to our sky full of stars. This film is a lovely & inspiring piece that I would like to give to everybody I know.",1387497600,,388,4.328767123287672
5117989,4,B0081HP71Q,"Fun to watch and very interesting, makes you want to seek out the dark to view the sky like it would have been in the past",1385942400,,122,3.730769230769231
5117990,4,B0081HP71Q,"I had seen this on public television and was taken by the changes to the human body because of the onset of the discovery of the electric light bulb and the good and bad about such an epic introduction into our lives. For me I live in the wonder of the creation by God of  human  beings and how we have become, dismayingly so, the so-called masters of our fate. Our exploring minds have created both the good and the dark side which affects not only humans but also the created order.",1381190400,,484,4.25
5117991,5,B0081HP71Q,Amazing Movie!!!  Everyone should watch this film!  Things you would never take into consideration.  Highly recommend it to everyone to see.,1378166400,,140,5.571428571428571
5117992,4,B0081HP71Q,"Being a city kid I guess I never really thought about it all that much. Over the past half-century the world has become a substantially brighter place. Due to the intrusion of high intensity artificial lighting our nights are being transformed while some of the darkest places on earth are being impacted in ways that we could not possibly have anticipated. Some call it progress but a growing cadre of scientists and concerned citizens believe that the phenomenon known as ""light pollution"" decimates our view of the heavens above, wastes money and precious natural resources and threatens the health and well-being of people all over the world. Filmmaker Ian Cheney explores this endlessly fascinating subject in his captivating new documentary ""The City Dark...a search for night on a planet that never sleeps"".  You will discover how urban sprawl and our irrational penchant for ever-increasing levels of security are robbing most of humankind of the magnificent darkness that poets and philosophers have been writing about since the beginning of time.  Ian Cheney makes a powerful case that the time has come to re-evaluate the way we think about darkness.

The International Dark-Sky Association (IDA) defines light pollution as ""any adverse effect of artificial light, including sky glow, glare, light trespass, light clutter, decreased visibility at night, and energy waste.""  What quickly becomes apparent during the course of this film is how much of the lighting we employ at night is simply overkill. Shopping malls, parking lots and car dealerships are among the worst offenders. Lighting is essentially being used for marketing purposes. Meanwhile, increasing numbers of homeowners are installing those hideous 175 watt dusk-to-dawn security lights despite the fact that numerous studies have concluded that there is no compelling evidence that such lighting reduces crime.  Cheney's own family in rural Maine did this after a robbery at their home several years ago.  Robbed of the natural darkness of night, it is no wonder that increasing numbers of people all over the world are suffering from all sorts of medical maladies.  In just the past few years we have learned that there may be a connection between artificial light and certain forms of cancer, namely breast and prostate. It seems that artificial light stifles the body's production of melatonin. Throughout the 84 minutes of ""The City Dark"" you will discover many more of the negative impacts of all of this lighting overkill that dark-sky advocates are so concerned about.

I thought that the most compelling part of ""The City Dark"" was Ian Cheney's visits to a couple of the darkest spots in America.  His visit to Sky Village, AZ was simply amazing.  This just might be the darkest place in the nation. Cheney also visits Bar Harbor, ME, home of Acadia National Park.
The residents of this seacoast community treasure their darkness and have implemented aggressive new laws that virtually ban unnecessary lighting.  This area is now acknowledged as one of the darkest places in the eastern United States.  After seeing these magnificent places in this film I long to experience them for myself. In fact, my wife and I have altered our vacation plans and are now planning a trip to Bar Harbor this fall. I look forward with a great deal of anticipation to experiencing the awe of seeing a true night sky for the first time since I was a child.

During the course of ""The City Sky"" one man was interviewed on Jones Beach near New York City.  He recalled going there back in 1973 armed with his telescope and related how dark the sky was at that time.  Not anymore.  He finds it all very frustrating.  ""It's so sad because I know what's above me once it gets dark here.  It just doesn't get dark anymore.""  A couple of weeks ago I picked up a copy of a terrific new book about this subject.  Reading Paul Bogard's ""The End of Night:  Searching for Natural Light in an Age of Artificial Light"" has had a profound effect on me.  It has totally changed the way I look at the night sky and the way we light our world.  Reading that book prompted me to view this film. I believe that it is incumbent on each and every one of us to become more educated about these incredibly important issues. Watching ""The City Sky"" would be a quick, easy and inexpensive way to get yourself up to speed.  Highly recommended!",1375833600,,4383,4.883940620782726

8523934,5,B0081HP71Q,One of the best documentaries I've ever watched on a subject not many people know about. Thank you!,1481500800,,99,4.555555555555555

8523937,5,B0081HP71Q,"This innovative and engaging DVD highlights the problem of light pollution not just for the astronomy enthusiast, but also on account of the negative impact of such inappropriate use of lighting that has become a hazard for both wildlife and humankind. It is a DVD that one will wish to see more than once, and can be a great educational tool for astronomy clubs, etc...",1449705600,,370,4.707692307692308
8523938,2,B0081HP71Q,"This does not star Neil deGrasse Tyson. He is in it as an interviewee for perhaps a total of 60 seconds. What you learn is that cities cause light pollution and this impacts our ability to see stars, and it has impacts on birds and animals. If you know that already I'm not sure that there's much to be gained from watching this. If you didn't know that then maybe you'll like it. It doesn't contain much in the way of hard facts but if you like soft music, long sequences of visuals where no information is conveyed, and have 70 minutes to kill one evening you might like it. I had hoped it might be about the Dark Skies initiative and how that can dramatically improve things - but maybe that's in the last 25 minutes - I got a little frustrated with the slow pace and lack of actual information and just had to turn it off.",1447545600,,826,4.20125786163522

8523942,5,B0081HP71Q,A must see; well done about the night skies getting light polluted by poor lighting use. Will we come to a point that the milky way or stars may never be viewable from much of the USA? I hope not.,1415404800,,196,3.925
