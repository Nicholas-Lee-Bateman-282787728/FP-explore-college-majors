8735123,5,B015YORFD6,"Where were John Robson and Brigitte Pellerin when I was studying context-free and tedious dates and events in school?  This informative and accessible video gives the essential and fascinating context for the Magna Carta and its role in the Anglosphere for the last 800 years.  After bringing the primary players in Great Britain to life, Robson traces the diffusion of the Magna Cartas principles into the political life of the USA and Canada, making this documentary of interest to anyone who knows and loves these countries.  Robson connects the dots to the current day, raising the alarm about the erosion of our liberties from the unchecked growth of government.  Structured into chapters, the documentary is easy to watch in short bursts; enlivened by Robsons trademark wit, easy narrative style, and enthusiasm, its also fine for one sitting.  Robson's passion for his subject is infectious, inspiring me to do some more reading.",1446249600,3,936,5.172185430463577

You can tell that this is a labour of love for John Robson. He brings history to life with each of his documentaries. If you are a history buff you will search out John Robson.",1446249600,,327,4.377049180327869
8735125,5,B015YORFD6,"This is essential knowledge for everyone that believes in freedom and individual rights. The video was not produced by government or big Hollywood money, it has no agenda to put forth. This video was a production of two highly motivated and intelligent people, John Robson and Brigitte Pellerin. The project was crowd funded and they raised their desired amount and more, as people believed it to be a very worthwhile project. They traveled from Canada to the UK and US to research the project and film the video seen in the documentary.  I recommend it to everybody and we all need to support independent productions like this.",1445558400,,628,4.869158878504673
8735126,5,B015YORFD6,"This is the story of freedom-loving people rising up against tyranny, and redefining the role of the ruling class for centuries to come.  It's an 800-year version of Canada's history which calls into question today's reliance on big government, and what it truly means to be ""progressive"".  A thought-provoking documentary for all Canadians.",1445385600,,341,5.415094339622642
8735127,5,B015YORFD6,"This is a great documentary. Very informative, easy to watch. It does not drone on or bore you like many documentaries. Highly recommend this for anyone interested in the Magna Carta and our liberties.",1445385600,,201,4.9411764705882355
