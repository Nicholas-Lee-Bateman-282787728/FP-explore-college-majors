7866354,5,6304258518,"I bought this movie for my family because once a week during the summer time, the kids take turns picking out a theme and we watch a movie and eat dinner foods based on that theme.  This was a great movie enjoyed by my 12 year old son and my husband and myself.  My 10 year old daughter was very scared and would run in and out of the living room.  This movie is much more graphic than you might think so take that in to consideration when choosing this movie for your younger ones.  We loved the story line, we were constantly on the edge of our seats, we laughed hysterically at some parts, and thoroughly enjoyed this very entertaining movie!  Great movie for the whole family - just consider the maturity level of your under 10 crowd.  I don't think my daughter was quite ready.",1181692800,,782,4.285714285714286
7866355,4,6304258518,"This is the first, and my 12 year old daughter says probably the best, of the Club House Detective series of films. There is another three at least: (e.g. Big trouble, Scavanger hunt, and Search for a princess), but sadly these don't seem to be available in the US or UK on DVD - they do sometimes air on cable though. These other films are far less dark and disturbing than this movie and will suite a younger audience (5+). This DVD film also has a different young cast to the later films, and although the others are `made for TV' they are all very good. These films follow the E. Blyton's 'Secret Seven' type classic plots - they even have a shed club-house (actually an old bus in this movie) - so adults up to no good are being spied on by clever kids (all boys), who solve the mystery of what is going on and call the police just in time to stop any unpleasantness or the crime paying.

The very young age of the cast makes these cute films for adults in kid's company, and the simple jokes and relaxed style of the later films are fairly non-scary for the kids. However in this first film there is a `dead body' in the house next door and it is actually very scary. It's not unlike Fright Night really, although the `baddy' is a normal human, which actually makes it more sinister. This makes this film unsuitable for many under 10s (particularly without adult company). My son (10) found it scary but enjoyable (he prefers the later, rather more jolly, Clubhouse Detectives films). So a recommended highly tense, but enjoyable, children's thriller - I found it a lot scarier than 12+ rated TV series like 'Charmed' though.",1166745600,,1631,4.454849498327759
7866356,5,6304258518,"If you've ever had crazy adventures with your childhood buds this is the film for you and your kids. As you reminisce, your kids will flip for the performances of The Brothers Galeota (Mike and Johnny) whose performances express everything you felt as a preteen. This film very much deserves more than just its cult status. Seriously, if you want a great film for the whole family watch the adventures of Billy Ruckman and the ""Clubhouse Detectives""!",993168000,2,450,4.857142857142857
7866357,5,6304258518,"This is like one of the best kids' movies!!! I loved it when I first saw it when I was at about age 10 or 11. It's got a bunch of young boy actors including the real life brothers who play brothers, Michael and Jimmy Galeota. They are one of my fave kid actors. Michael you may remember from the Saterday morning show Baily Kippers' P.O.V that sadly got canceled a few years ago. Michael is now 17, he played in this movie at age 12, Jimmy is now 14 and played in this movie at age 9, hes so hot! This movie is a mystery movie for kids. It's about a club of 4 boys, about 12 yrs old, plus tag along younger brother Cade (Jimmy Galeota) who play detectives and try to figure out whats going on with their mysterious next door neighbor by sneaking into his house when hes not home. It's a way great movie, trust me! Overall, I think you would like it! bye 4 now!",971568000,3,860,4.035087719298246
