3505657,5,B001C4ZQDY,"If you are a fan of this show, and have already got the first part of season one on DVD, then of course getting the second part is a must for all fans.

On this DVD you get more of the same great Shin antics, and humor, that does not dissapoint what fans of this show are used to seeing.",1223164800,,287,3.783333333333333
3505658,5,B001C4ZQDY,"Shin-chan's episodes are so amusing. There are jokes about politics, domestic issues, potty humor, and much much more. It is amazing for those who are into open minded jokes, and that like to laugh. Even when you probably shouldn't.

Each character has his/her own personality and makes the animation shows much more interesting (I've seen a lot where the characters DONT have individual personalities).

Also... I say let your children watch it. It is still very fun to watch even if you don't get the jokes in each episode. It's like Looney Toons.",1222214400,,549,4.89247311827957
3505659,5,B001C4ZQDY,"This is one of the greatest shows that not enough people are watching.  If you appreciate inappropriate humor, then this is the show for you.  It will have you laughing until you cry, all the way through.  BUY THIS DVD!!  It's amazing!!  I can't recommend it enough, just watching it will make your day!",1222128000,,303,4.537037037037037
3505660,5,B001C4ZQDY,Best product EVER!  This is something that I watch constantly.  I recommend it to ANYONE...EVERYONE!,1222041600,3,100,5.6
3505661,5,B001C4ZQDY,"Unlike Season 1, Part 1 which claimed to be uncensored but had many words bleeped out, this disk has no bleeps.

These episodes are truly funny as are the Alternate dialog clips in the extras.

Thanks for listening to us Funimation. Now please reissue Part 1 without the censorship.",1221609600,2,282,4.73469387755102
3505662,5,B001C4ZQDY,"I'll admit it, at first glance I thought this show looked pretty dumb. After watching a few episodes I came to realize that this show is probably one of the funniest shows on television. Some people may say that the Original show was funnier, but I love how FUNimation made this show relevant to American culture. I laughed so hard during some episodes that it hurt. Well worth watching and definitely well worth buying.",1221436800,5,420,4.6891891891891895
3505663,5,B001C4ZQDY,Shinchan is freaking hilarious! It's like the South Park of Japan. I absolutely adore this show! I own the first DVD collection also and I intend to collect everything they release. I laugh so hard I cry. Five stars!! XD,1221177600,5,220,4.525
3505664,2,B001C4ZQDY,Wow. Did someone actually write that? Makes me want to buy this  DVD set. Not! Once again funimation turns Shin-chan into low brow comedy you would see on Family Guy or South Park. Maybe if they stuck to the original script it wouldn't be that bad.,1221091200,2,248,4.391304347826087
3505665,5,B001C4ZQDY,"The Shin Chan series is this: (1) not as shocking as South Park, Not as goofy as Beavis and Butt-head, and has more potty language then the Simpsons. (2)Most of the dialogue is edgy and fresh. However, the a_ _ dance becomes tiresome by the end of season one, as well as the small b_ _b jokes. This is a series worth owning because it has a quality where the jokes sometime fly by so quickly it'll take several seconds to regester. Also, all the jokes are not gross or shoved in for shock value, there are some charming subtleties to Shin Chan...though you have to look hard for them. (3)it's about a dysfunctional family, but a subtle version. Not as annoying as Married with Children, or as Crazy as the Simpsons. (4) For some viewers it may be disturbing to see an animated five year old flashing his lower region, or the idea of poking fun at domestic abuse (Penny and her mother). However, if you can handle these two surprising elements, Shin Chan really is an original treasure for people who just want something a little different then the shows mentioned above.
As for certain reviewers who are too nit-picky about how the show had been changed to suit American tastes. Please don't buy the show unless you have better things to do with your life then rip on a series mostly dedicated to butt jokes :) Otherwise, if you're the average American, enjoy the show :)",1258156800,,1371,4.51004016064257
3505666,5,B001C4ZQDY,"I must admit as much of a dirty mind/potty mouth I have, it still doesnt seem to measure up to the cleverness of this show. If you survived part one, you must have the stomach for part 2 (which quite honestly is a bit toned down. just a LITTLE).but enough to make u shake your head lol.",1256083200,,286,4.035087719298246
3505667,4,B001C4ZQDY,I found out about this show through cartoon network and what struck me about it is how little kids speak so maturly. Its really funny and it was a good price (compared to other stores). Its a must buy for any comedy-loving anime freak. Enjoy,1252022400,,241,4.377777777777778
3505668,4,B001C4ZQDY,I got this dvd for my husband as a Christmas present. Shin Chan just makes him laugh the whole way through! I myself watch it and find it very funny and weird :) I also bought Season 1 part 1 and it was great!,1236556800,,209,3.772727272727273
3505669,5,B001C4ZQDY,"For those of us with a sick sense of humor that is timely (refers to people and events in the news just recently) and funny and full of trash talk, this is it! This is the first set in the English dub new series of DVDs that is NOT censored. Thank you for that!",1235260800,,261,3.8518518518518516
3505670,5,B001C4ZQDY,My son started me watching this.  It is so funny.  I can't wait until Season 2 is available on dvds.,1224633600,,100,3.95
3505671,4,B001C4ZQDY,"I found shin chan entirely by accident one evening while being home sick and it changed my life.  My illness went away!  Ok so it was a cold, but nonetheless, Shin Chan changed my life with the magic of the elephant dance and the humor of Action Bastard!

Honor and a Penis!  Never forget!",1223942400,,289,4.296296296296297
3505672,5,B001C4ZQDY,"A Japanese kids cartoon dubbed in English for an adult crowd, ""Shin Chan"" from FUNimation features hilarious writing and wonderful voice acting.  Special mention goes to Laura Bailey as Shin and Carrie Savage as Penny.

The episodes are cut up from the original into three, usually unconnected, pieces per episode.  The plots of each piece appear to be loosely connected to the original, though surely some must vary wildly from the original.

For the price, the DVD is seriously lacking in extras, especially commentary tracks.  In this instance this is particularly unfortunate as the cast and crew clearly have the rapport and wit to make the commentaries as good as the episodes they comment on.  ""Futurama"" must be the Gold Standard for commentary tracks, and all DVD producers would profit from following Futurama's example.

Extras notwithstanding, Shin Chan is an outstanding program and worth enjoying.",1223769600,,911,5.241379310344827
3505673,5,B001C4ZQDY,One of the best shows from the Adult Swim line up! I wish they would make more!!!!,1223683200,,82,3.8823529411764706
3505674,4,B001C4ZQDY,"After purchasing the first part and loving it. I found out that part 2 was going to be released soon. When it came out I bought it. It is funny, and obscene like the first, but I don't think it is as good as the first. I still recommend for a good laugh. The Super Pooper episode is so funny. Season 2 is to come out soon I think and I will probably buy that one too, because this little guy is so funny. I love it.",1223251200,,415,3.781609195402299

8286010,5,B001C4ZQDY,"If you're a parent, you will feel for Shin's parents, because you know that if he was yours, he'd be dead. Crude, rude, and self centered as only a 5 year old can be, Shin makes Dennis the Menace look like a saint. If your sense of humor can be described as warped, you'll probably love it. I discovered it on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim.",1331424000,,339,4.230769230769231
8286011,1,B001C4ZQDY,"Um, why are people charging $40+ for this 1 half of the first season when you can buy the FULL first season for only $30?? Very confusing. I'd buy this if it weren't so ridiculously overpriced, being that it's the only one I'm missing. Oh, and meanwhile, the other 3 (S1P1, S2P1, and S2P2) are $4 the least and $9 max.",1291680000,,318,4.229508196721311
