8662111,5,B00KW3A6EU,"Keanu Reeves as one of the best serial-killers ever, with a fitting killer soundtrack.
James Spader is equally believable, but his more or less standard addiction (nearly in every TV-Show/Movie there is now one person with an addiction, big yawn) is for me over the top. A different ending with a possible escape for a second movie would have been a great idea, but we get a typical Hollywood-ending, well executed, though.
Blu-ray: no real extras (I do not count another DRM-infested Digital copy I must jump many hoops through to get it AND download it, a good extra), did not watch the trailer (except for historical value, pointless extra, as nearly always).
Both the picture quality and the sound (ok I do not have a good sound-system so, no comparison) are worth the cheap upgrade, even if you own the DVD. As I really love this film I would have liked an edition with more extras or a steelbook, cheesy though it may seem.
For other good Blu-rays I suggest The Flock (Richard Gere).",1420416000,,989,4.6571428571428575
8662112,5,B00KW3A6EU,I have always loved this movie and was thrilled when it went to blu ray! Keanu rocks this one as a killer!,1414108800,,106,3.8636363636363638
8662113,3,B00KW3A6EU,"The movie is pretty good. The acting is up to par with Spader, Reeves and Tomei. The storyline is one that has been used many times, but it still holds your interest. It has that feeling of Seven meets, The Bone Collector meets, The First Power. The transfer to Blu-ray was done well and overall I give it a 3 out of 5.",1413158400,,319,4.079365079365079
