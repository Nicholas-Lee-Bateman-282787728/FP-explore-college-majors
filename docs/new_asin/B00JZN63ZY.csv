8654680,5,B00JZN63ZY,"Absolutely love it!!! Product came fast and works great! My only issue is not with the seller but with the distribution company- the seasons are great quality don't get me wrong and it's great that someone took the time to put out a physical release (again thank you, you have no idea)- the only hitch is that there are tiny bits missing from season 2 (i.e. 10-20 secs of dialogue scattered throughout the episodes in season 2). It happens at least once in every episode in season 2. It's weird because season 1 is all there line for line scene for scene but season 2 has been slightly trimmed down! I just can't figure out why?!? I know it's a silly thing to push about but I just love this show so much (I've binged it 3 times on Netflix and part 3/4 of the way through my blurays)! I wanted to buy physical copies so I would always have it (even if it is region b) it was kind of adding to a collection plus adding the safety net that I would always have access to it (even if I lost internet or God forbid Netflix should cut it due to lack of viewing) I know that last one's a long shot considering the fact that it is a Netflix Original series but still you never know. I just wish the distributor hadn't trimmed the second season down. Thanks for letting me rant- but DO NOT take this as a sign you shouldn't pick one up for yourself  (especially from this seller) definitely worth the buy!",1517875200,,1396,4.228464419475656
