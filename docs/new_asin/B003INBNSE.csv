8397549,4,B003INBNSE,"This DVD, featuring Alain Passard, is very interesting. It is the only DVD in the serious that does not have subtitles. For the most part, the interviews and time spent in Passard's kitchen is in English.  I still recommend this DVD, for the professional in the restaurant business. I do feel, however, that this documentary may be the weakest in the series. That doesn't mean it shouldn't be purchased and viewed repeatedly. It's just that the DVDs of Barbot and Passedat allowed you a better portrait of the chef at work.",1296604800,3,523,4.747252747252747
