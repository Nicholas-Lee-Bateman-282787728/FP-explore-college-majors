Demonstrations are discussed and then shown from multiple camera angles.

Overall a well made DVD with clear video/audio and good advice from two respected individuals.  Unfortunately, they only cover the basics and do not touch on; long guns, flashlights, stairs, etc...",1206057600,9,476,5.676056338028169
8026702,5,B0002D68UG,"Wilson's House Clearing and Cornering Tactics and Techniques is one of the best instructional videos that I've found on the subject.  Bill Wilson from Wilson Combat fame and Ken Hackathorn who is a professional law enforcement and military trainer, walk you through the basics of clearing your own home with a firearm in case of an emergency.

Please be aware that clearing your own home is never advised unless there is no other choice and lives depend on your immediate actions.

Even law enforcement and military professionals prefer to do house clearing duties in teams of three or more.  The information in this DVD is for the homeowner who wants the knowledge, just in case there is no other option.

The techniques and tactics taught by Ken Hackathorn and Bill Wilson in this video can save your life and the lives of others in your family if the need ever arises to clear your home of intruders before the police arrive.",1135728000,7,928,4.739130434782608
