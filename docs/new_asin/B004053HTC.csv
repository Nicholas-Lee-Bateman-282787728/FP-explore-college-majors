8412072,5,B004053HTC,"I collect any DVD that has veterans interviewed, I would guess I have 200 or so about WWII, and this is a real surprise. It is very well done, from the soldier's interviews, to the reenactments, to the correct period gear, to the stories about forgotten heroes like 19-year-old James Hendrix.
  I also appreciated seeing the exact spots where history occurred and seeing so many of the monuments to American troops that exist.
  Throughout this 90-minute film, Ellwood Von Seibold zips around and shows his passion for history and his appreciation for the American contributions.
  Buy this DVD and the others in this series, I am aware of two others. I wish there were more.
 Well done, Mr. Von Seibold and colleagues.",1309824000,2,719,4.844262295081967
8412073,4,B004053HTC,"I recently spent an enjoyable evening watching Americans in the Bulge with my son (aged 22) and grandson (aged 11). My son and I have watched many WWII films, and this one stands out as a wonderful way to explain history. The way the film juxtaposed the actual locations at the same time of year with veterans talking about incidents was extremely effective. We could imagine how cold and miserable it must have been when listening to the veteran talk about drinking snow water laced with cordite from the shells, and spending weeks in frozen, shallow foxholes while wearing summer uniforms. We all appreciated the stories of medal of honor recipients, including the dramatization of the duel between a corporal from the Big Red 1 and an SS panzer commander. I've seen a massive tiger tank, so the story of the large scoop of metal cut from this type of tank was quite impressive. The film was fast paced and energetic enough to captivate my grandson for the full 90 minutes, and that is a feat in itself.",1286582400,3,1005,4.651685393258427
