Absolutely unfortunate for a historical precious treasure. The Seller should have checked the quality of the DVD before selling it. Not at all any good experience.",1487376000,,325,5.392156862745098

7796063,5,1559746114,"This is a very important film for all those concerned with the horrors of Nazism and whether or not justice is possible for those who survived . After having read several books on the hunt for Eichmann it was rewarding to be able to have not only a visual representation of the houses , streets , cars etc that were involved but , more importantly , to put faces to the names of the main characters . Highly recommended .",1428796800,2,421,4.275

7796066,5,1559746114,"A fascinating look into the lives of Israeli secret service agents as they go after one of the biggest Nazi fish of all, Adolf Eichmann.  One of the best documentaries you will ever see.  And narrated by Gregory Peck who does the best Peck ever.  Gregory was BORN to narrate documentaries!  Too bad he didn't do it more often (instead of some of those awful movies he starred in!).",1155254400,5,381,4.478260869565218
