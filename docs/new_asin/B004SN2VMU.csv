8439990,3,B004SN2VMU,"It is ok but I needed to see more self defense move.

I must say John Harper does have some beautiful legs.  Wished mind looked that good.  Smile.

Some of the training I can do but the ones the you jump up and down or fall to the ground, push your legs out, pull your legs back in and stand up continuously will probably never happen for me.  I have bad knees, wrist and back so I don't think all the strengthening in the world will prepare me for some of his moves.

I could have gone on the internet and gotten this regarding self defense information.  Which I had already done for free so I probably just wasted my money. I saw a lot more than what was on this video.  It should have only costed $3.00.  I should have probably went to my library to see if this was available before I purchased it.",1331078400,2,801,4.083333333333333
