8627443,1,B00GTSVOX4,"Merle Haggard is my all time favorite country singer but this is his worst DVD to date, poor fuzzy picture quality, though the sound is good and his voice still sounds strong even today. What this actually is are clips from 2 concerts, an outdoors concert where he wears a white shirt and an indoors concert where he has on a blue shirt. But it has all the appearances of a bootleg copy, there are no opening or closing credits, so you can't tell when or where it was shot, in fact it looks like it was made on a home video camcorder.

What upsets me the most is that the front cover portrays a young 20ish Merle and the back cover states Features Merle Haggard Performances in his prime, well Merle was in his prime in his 20's, not his 60's, What I expected to see because of these covers was a young Merle Haggard in his prime, not a vintage Merle Haggard in his late 50's or 60's, his hair is gray and wiry and most likely these are clips from the early 2000's because if you look at the song clips, If I Could Only Fly came out in his album in 2000. His voice when he was young was amazing and heartbreaking on his early albums. This is basically the video copy of a CD put out in 2009 called Merle Haggard Okie From Muskogee that I bought at Walmart over a year ago for $5. In fact, this DVD sounds much better with the video turned off. So if you have this album then these songs are all the same versions, even the ad libs, so there is no new thrill, this DVD sounds just like that CD with a few more songs added in.

Merle Haggard was honored with a lifetime achievement award at the CMA Music Awards this year and it's a shame that such a shabby looking DVD like this was produced.",1404172800,4,1691,4.121212121212121
8627444,2,B00GTSVOX4,"These are old clips from previously released dvds. The cover of this dvd said it was a 2014 release date. This gave me the impression that this dvd was fresh new material from Haggard. Also the quality of the picture displayed while running the dvd did not meet my expectations. All in all, I was not impressed with this haggard dvd. While I remain a dedicated Haggard fan, hopefully will see some fresh and new dvds coming our way soon.  Thank you for asking my opinion.",1403395200,4,471,4.476744186046512
