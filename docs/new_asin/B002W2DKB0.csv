8382765,3,B002W2DKB0,"I wasn't impressed by this DVD. It doesn't have the professional edge I would have liked. In other words, I could have come up with this and I'm not a yoga professional.",1319500800,,169,4.3125
8382766,5,B002W2DKB0,"It's kinda ""old"" looks like it was recorded in the 90's but it's still a very cute dvd.  You will get lots of use out of it! Highley recommended!!",1316563200,2,146,4.0344827586206895
8382767,1,B002W2DKB0,"The video description is incredibly misleading - this is not a video for you and your kids to watch together, it is aimed at adult viewers as a basic introduction to toddler yoga. I have been doing yoga classes at a local studio with my daughter from about 12 months (she is now 20 months), and the class they have filmed is not even good were it taught at a studio, in person.
The video has the quality of a badly shot home video (set in a cluttered living room, apparently, not a true yoga studio). The video quality and shakiness makes it look very unprofessional, and it focuses on the parents doing yoga, not interacting with their kids. The children, in fact, only seem mildly interested and there is nothing about the video that catches or keeps the attention of a child watching it a home. The instructor speaks primarily to the parents, not the kids! Incredibly disappointed, will attempt to return this video immediately!",1305849600,4,931,4.614457831325301
8382768,1,B002W2DKB0,My 18 month old does not have even remotely enough attention span to handle this dvd. I think the 10 month - 3 year label is somewhat misleading. Maybe I was distracted trying to keep her focused but it seemed like a dvd with a bunch of people just doing some stretches. I was hoping for some more yoga poses that could be adapted to my child.,1283472000,3,343,4.134328358208955
8382769,4,B002W2DKB0,"I've used this dvd a few times now with my three-year old. As soon as I suggest we do some exercise and relaxation together she helps me set up and then loves guiding me through the beginning. The idea of her being in charge just thrills her--when you get to tell your mom what to do and she'll do it?! And it has allowed for some pretty interesting poses!
She doesn't nap anymore however, so I rarely get to finish the dvd by myself, but it would have worked well for us when she was younger. In fact, might have been very useful as way to calm her before napping. I did use it a few times before bedtime and it helped quiet us both down.
Definitely a great tool for getting some calming exercise and bonding time all in one with my daughter.",1268870400,2,743,4.166666666666667
8382770,2,B002W2DKB0,I don't like this DVD at all. It views as if I'm watching a home movie. It is more talking than actual movement with children. I wish I could return it for a refund.,1266796800,,165,3.8823529411764706
8382771,5,B002W2DKB0,"I have been a Yoga student for 18 years and an instructor for 10 of them.  I've studied with many incredible yoga masters and I must say, my best yoga teacher is my daughter!
We have done yoga together her whole life and I feel that it has created a great bond between us and taught her a respect for her body and exercise.  I also feel she enjoys having something special only she and I share.
When ever she gets impatient, bored or frustrated I suggest pulling out our mats and doing some yoga.... it works every time to center her and we always find ways to play and laugh
This video is great for toddlers because they love seeing other children doing things then mimicking them (especially if you don't have a playgroup or preschool)
I love love love this video and highly recommend it to all parents or someone looking for a gift for a family with small children.
Om shanti  (Peace please)",1262649600,9,894,4.373493975903615
