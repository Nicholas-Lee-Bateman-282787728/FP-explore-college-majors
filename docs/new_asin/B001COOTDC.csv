3515254,3,B001COOTDC,"The case of 17 year-old Johnny Frank Garrett, a minor with an IQ in the 70s and a history of abuse when he was a child, who was accused of murdering and raping a nun in her her convent bedroom in Amarillo, Texas, is treated here in a bit of a too high-pitched mode. The simple facts of this horrific case, and the incompetence of the north Texas ""system"" of justice ought to have been enough for a powerful film. Unfortunately, Quackenbush gets a bit overwrought in the way he lays out his story - especially in the playing up the multiple later deaths and illnesses of people connected with the mentally retarded Garrett's conviction and execution. Quackenbush infers that their sufferings were brought on by a death row ""curse letter"" that Garrett, proclaiming his innocence up to the end, issued in defiance of those who had a part in securing a guilty verdict for him.

That being said, TLW is a truly shocking introduction to the white fundamentalist Christian vengeance-oriented fear culture that predominates in places like Amarillo. The film maker presents a strong case for its influence on the conviction and death of Garrett. Moreover, subsequent developments in the case after Garrett's execution point to his innocence and back to the original suspects in the crime. Viewers will be taken aback by the unusually strong and incisive remarks about Texas culture and justice by the director of the Texas Innocence Project.... and - alas - they ring true. Many of the north Texans determined to execute Garrett  also seem like natural recruits for Tea Party Republicanism and enthusiasts of ""2nd amendment remedies."" It is most sobering to know that they already are part of the state government of Texas, and occupy seats in the US House of Representatives.

If you can get past Quackenbush's sensationalism and focus on the core issues of the crime and its prosecution, you will gain an insight into the fallacies of fundamentalist right wing culture and the institutions of justice it can corrupt..",1300060800,2,2010,4.905882352941177

3515256,3,B001COOTDC,"I have just seen the documentary for the second time. It is excellent, but the viewer should know that the director has sensationalized/created quotes that are not factual. One of the film's underlying premises is that the executed boy cast a curse on his antagonists and gave a last statement saying that ""all of them could kiss my everlovin' ass."" But the book ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Texas-Death-Row-Executions-in-the-Modern-Era/dp/0452289300/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Texas Death Row:  Executions in the Modern Era</a>,"" available on Amazon, which details the crimes, personal data, last meals and final statements of everyone executed since 1977, shows no last words or statement for Johnny. If the director or anyone else would like to correct what I perceive as fictive fluff, I will stand corrected. Still I recommend the DVD.

3515257,5,B001COOTDC,"No matter what your feelings are regarding the death penalty, this is a video I highly recommend. It shows a system that was out to convict and kill someone, no matter their guilt or innocence. A truly great example of a system gone horribly wrong. Everyone should watch this video and think about how we as a society can prevent it from ever happening again.",1260230400,2,359,4.538461538461538
3515258,5,B001COOTDC,"This is an compelling and sobering documentary of justice gone bad.  Politics in the prosecutor's office, media frenzy, a totally inept medical examiner, and lazy and incompetent defense lawyers caused this man to be wrongfully executed.  Well done documentary.",1229212800,2,261,5.666666666666667

8288460,1,B001COOTDC,"Having lived in Amarillo during all this I wondered how this would play out.  It was completely biased and left multiple details out that would render the documentary as worthless.

1. Jesse Quackenbush was hired as a lawyer in ""The Innocence Project"" pontification lawyer Blackburn's office.  You have a documnetarian being paid to show his boss' theory in the best possbile light as some kind of expert.  No one in Amarillo thinks either one of them is much of a lawyer.  Blackburn teaches because no one will hire him.

2. Selden Hale is a consistent commenter as a member of the ""Texas Pardons and Paroles Board"".  What is not mentioned, except in an extremely brief transparent graphic, that Selden Hale was one of Johnny Frank Garrett's defense lawyers in his appeals.  So all the evidence that he speaks about not being used in court he obviously didn't use in his appeals either.  Blackburn called Garrett's defense team incompetent.  Hale fits that description

3. Danny Hill was a life long Democrat.  While a conservative he was never close to the right wing nut he is protrayed as being. Also, there were change of venues in the murder cases that were mentioned in the first part.  Three cop killers on a Christmas night was one.  Their family and friends did drive by shouting at Danny's house while he was at the trial in another city.  ""You'll get yours!!"" was heard by Danny Hill's wife and young children several times. Garrett's mother and siblings were like minded at the time. Again a completely one-sided position by Quackenbush delivers a ""death penalty conspiracy"" without looking a both sides.  Mother's milk for his target auidience.

4. Ann Richards never considered George W. Bush a polictial threat when she turned down the commutation.  Check the dates of the execution and the years of the election she lost.  So Blackburn's diatribe is without merit.

5. While his childhood abuse was clearly known about town. There is no mention, other that he had a troubled childhood, that Johnny Frank Garrett had threatened multiple people.  This included the teacher he had threatened to kill.  She ultimately testified in his punishment phase and committed suicide long after.

6. The curse and all the cancers could be that Amarillo was the final assembly point for all nuclear weapons for the United States.  It has an abnormally high cancer rate though no one has proven Pantex is that.

7. Bishop Mathison was widely rumored to be the father of a son in towm.  He did all of HIS discussion after the trial.  The four nuns attended every single day of the trial (there is a picture of them in the film) not once did they approach anyone...including reporters who asked them for comment...about Garrett being in the chapel or anywhere else much less not afraid of him.

The one thing it got right was common knowledge.  Erdmann was an idiot.

And I was born on the north side of Amarillo.",1343088000,,2912,4.789156626506024
8288461,3,B001COOTDC,"This movie was ok but I certainly don't think it is worthy of all the awards and accolades it has received.
I won't spoil the ending but it wasn't what I expected and I would disagree with the conclusion of the movie.

My advise would be to rent it rather than buy it as I didn't feel it was something worth watching more than once.
Slightly disappointing.",1337558400,,356,4.313432835820896
8288462,5,B001COOTDC,"Johnny Garrett, is a 17 year mentally challenged boy arrested, convicted, and ultimately executed for the rape, mutilation, and murder of a 76 year old nun.

  Years after Garrett's execution new evidence came to light (from the cold case) proving that the Amarillo Police Department executed the wrong man, but Johnny gets ""The Last Word""
