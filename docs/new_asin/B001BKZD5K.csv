8283473,3,B001BKZD5K,"Well, what can I say? The Good: The music is phenomenal and the sound is good, but not in 5.1-What gives?. The videos (professionally made) as extras are a welcome edition, but nothing I haven't already seen. The Bad: Oh boy....The venue is smaller than my living room, the video is shot in the most amateurish way possible, and the setting, well, sucks. Not only is the video poorly shot, it is filmed in 16:9 and then crammed into a full-frame appearance. Very sad indeed. The guys in Nov. Doom should have opted for a live album instead of this aberration. The playing and singing really are great-thus the 3 stars, but the video is awful. So bad, in fact, that I just played the music without watching the concert for the whole second half and enjoyed it so much more. For die hard fans only, otherwise take a pass on this one...",1219017600,2,833,4.450980392156863
