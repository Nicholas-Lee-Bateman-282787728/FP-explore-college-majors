8333237,1,B001PFBWBU,this video actually made me way less excited about going to Vancouver... So pissed I just paid $2 for it,1340841600,,104,4.25
8333238,3,B001PFBWBU,"I'm new to travel videos (Disney videos which I received free of charge upon request excepted) so I took that into consideration and gave three stars where my impulse was to give two. This video brochure skims the surface of Vancouver's main attractions - then repeats some of the footage to stretch it out. I expected much more for my twenty bucks: a bit of the history, maybe a few verbal exchanges, the sounds of the city, the sounds of the park, ANYthing to enable the viewer to connect with the place, rather than standard video footage with a voiceover from end to end.",1259452800,,575,4.538461538461538
