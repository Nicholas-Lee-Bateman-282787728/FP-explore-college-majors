8185252,2,B000OIOPQ8,"Eh....nothing much happens in this movie. Half of the 70 minutes is filled with useless side stories that add very little to the main storyline...which I assume was the relationship between the two coworkers. The side stories really don't add much, a bit of fluff here and there. The flimsy main storyline is weakly supported by bits of interactions between the coworkers and conversations with other people. I wish there was a bit more of a connection. Are they mere coworkers or friends as well?

A bit boring, but I had a few chuckles here and there. The acting is not bad but the story goes nowhere. Status quo is the norm, and the goal, in this movie.",1207958400,2,656,4.559322033898305

8185254,4,B000OIOPQ8,"I really don't know how to review this one..  I had wanted to watch this, but none of the rental stores here carry it.. So, watched it with no idea if it was worth it.  This one has a real indie feel.. and is not as glossy as some of the more ""mainstream"" GLBTQ films (such as Gray Matters for example)..  Cute story, the characters are pretty well developed..  It's a bit pricey for such a low budget, almost unheard of film..  but.. I'm not unhappy with it.",1187913600,5,459,4.170454545454546
