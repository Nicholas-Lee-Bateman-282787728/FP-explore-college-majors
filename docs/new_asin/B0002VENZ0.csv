We all talk to ourselves in our minds but Simon goes one step further and makes all the women in his life past & present the voices .
Alda reprises his role perfectly!
Brilliant!!!",1379635200,,201,4.315789473684211
8032700,4,B0002VENZ0,"Not a block-buster like many of Neil Simon's movies and plays, this is nevertheless an easy watch.  A bit predictable, it is still fast paced and full of humor as Alan Alda and Anne Archer (Jake & his wife, Maggie), attempt to pull their marriage back together.  It's a nice, low-stress, feel-good movie to toss in the player as you sit back with a cup of tea and relax.",1359590400,3,370,4.3478260869565215

8032702,3,B0002VENZ0,"This is defnitely one of the most unusual movies I've seen.  It's the story of a writer whose wife died and although he has remarried he can't seem to get past it.  Throughout the movie he envisions (or brings forth)and has conversations with the women in his life (his sister, daughter, therapist, wife and ex-wife).  Outside of MASH, I can't say I'm a very big Alan Alda fan (he always strikes me as kind of a whiner), but I like most of the people in the supporting cast so I gave it a try.  This is not a movie I would watch over and over, but it was interesting for a one-time look.",1266624000,2,587,4.168141592920354

decided to view it.  Disappointed they changed some of the dialogue, but
other then that the performances were very good.",1215907200,4,189,4.7272727272727275
8032704,4,B0002VENZ0,I LOVE ANYTHING ALAN ALDA STARS IN.  THIS WAS DONE MORE LIKE A PLAY THAN A MOVIE AND THE CHARACTERS PORTRAYED WERE EXCELLENT.  THIS WAS NOT ALAN ALDA'S FINEST PERFORMANCE HOWEVER IT CAME IN CLOSE.,1184457600,3,196,4.571428571428571
8032705,5,B0002VENZ0,"ALAN ALDA DOES A WONDERFUL JOB ON JAKE'S WOMEN HE IS A WONDERFUL ACTOR & A MAN!
