8583588,1,B00CMSPJ5E,None of the 3 dvd's will recognize as a working disc. The first dvd in the 3 pack has a large scratch all the way around. I am a big fan of jillian michaels workout dvds. I just wouldn't recommend buying from this seller.,1496620800,,221,4.045454545454546
8583589,5,B00CMSPJ5E,I've been doing the 6 week 6 Pack every day for 4 weeks and it's HARD but results are there.  Jillian is so right--you can't just do sit-ups and crunches!  I've done those for years.  Her ingeniously-designed workout targets the back and sides which I now think are the real key to fitness.  And of course watching the gorgeous Jillian is...uh...inspirational.,1492041600,,360,4.852459016393443
