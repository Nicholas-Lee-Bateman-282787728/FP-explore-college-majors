3779144,2,B001RTCP1U,Before you lay down your money for this you may want to see if BSG season 4.5 includes this movie.  Season 4.0 included the movie Razor and they may do the same next time around.  As for the movie it does look very compelling from the clip provided above.  Looking forward to the movie and the series - let's hope it's another BSG.,1237939200,21,331,4.222222222222222
3779145,1,B001RTCP1U,"This low rating is indeed NOT for the movie itself. It is however, for the way that the company is robbing each of us so badly. BSG is a great series and loads of fun. But, if you who bought it recall, they broke up the seasons and charged us twice for ONE season more than one time. They can not say they are not making enough money on this series, as each of these seasons sells for a prime amount. Come on guys, stop selling what you will put in the season sets, separate - and stop breaking up the seasons to be .0 and .5 !  Give us a break. We are the fans and the ones who are making YOU money. Otherwise, my advice to all, is to wait if you can and purchase it USED thru a seller. Maybe then the company will stop being so greedy.",1237852800,26,737,3.880794701986755
3779146,5,B001RTCP1U,"Okay, the good news is, we're being given an *option* here to see Caprica well-ahead of it's premiere date, AND in an extended version of the movie that we won't be seeing on the air...I myself, am very looking forward to it, as Battlestar Galactica was my very favorite show EVER, and if I get even a fraction of that enjoyment out of Caprica, it will be WELL worth it...HOWEVER...
WHY ON EARTH would there not at least be the *option* to buy this on Blu-ray especially considering how RABIDLY fans are looking forward to FINALLY getting the entire series of BSG on Blu-ray...? Who wants to buy this on standard DVD when we'd like to keep our series media uniform in one format, AND get the best possible viewing pleasure available, especially on a series-related show where the fans prefer to get it in high-def? Shows like BSG (and most modern sci-fi shows) are preferable in high-def. I myself don't mind a double-dip in buying this separately from the eventual season-1 box set in another year and a half (I have no regrets from buying Razor), but now that Blu-ray is AVAILABLE to these shows, why not make them AVAILABLE to the consumer...? With BSG coming out on Blu-ray, I feel cheated that the prequel isn't (so far) being offered in the same quality format...",1237593600,17,1269,4.619469026548672
3779147,5,B001RTCP1U,"Don't know how the show will be, hopefully it will be up to budget with BSG, but i think its great their releasing this before the show airs. This may not be the finial version that will air but something is better than nothing. So what if its a double-dip, I'll buy this now and a 1 1/2 to 2 years from now I'll buy season one (assuming it at least half as good as BSG). I'm cool with that as long as i get to see anything from the BSG universe.

P.S. I'll also say thanks for letting me buy it twice :)",1235952000,8,504,3.8461538461538463
3779148,3,B001RTCP1U,"Just going on history, there will be a ""double dip"". The BSG pilot came out on DVD, then it was released on the Season 1 box set.  ""Razor"" came out on DVD, then it was released on the Season 4 box set.  Now the ""Caprica"" pilot is being released on DVD.  If you want to buy it now, no one is stopping you.  The more frugal may want to wait, though; because what is on this DVD will undoubtedly be released on the Caprica Season 1 box set.

3779169,1,B001RTCP1U,"This is one of the worst, dumbest, most annoying, totally miscast, totally disturbing wardrobe, plotless, meandering, self-immolating, scab-picking, unappealing series ever produced in the history of Earth.

It has NONE of the five-star qualities of GALACTICA. It is so freaking CANADIAN as to be nauseating, with the most annoying characters I have ever seen.

In my very long life, I have seen movies degrade from Story, Plot, and Drama, down to the worthless slime of gratuitous sex, violence, and supposedly exciting CGi effects. Sadly these are NOW mistaken for ""good"" in films. While CGi has enormous potential to make Film, it is NOT Film.

""Caprica,"" to moi,  seems to have been written by simpering stoners, with a lot of help from drunken passers-by, during a quick ""get-sober"" lunch-break in downtown  Winnipeg, on the back of a paper plate.

The show differs substantially from BSG however you can definitely see the seeds of BSG being planted, albeit in a different way than you'd think.

This show had a lot of potential and I wish it survived more than one season.  I will say that I was hooked and I blew through the entire season in a weekend watching 7 episodes a day.

Sorry, this review sucks :(

if you like BSG and Sci-Fi in general you will like this series.  It is basically a soap opera and a Sci-Fi show blended together ala BSG so if uyou like BSG you should like this series.",1377216000,,686,4.159090909090909

3779174,2,B001RTCP1U,"I guess it is hard to follow something so well produced and acted as BSG, and this certainly did not do the trick. Taking you back to the beginning of how the Cylons came about, it attempts to provide the backstory for this great series but frankly, it moves slowly and is pretty boring. It does not have the right writing and intense performances of the series.",1370822400,,362,4.417910447761194
3779175,5,B001RTCP1U,"Part of the Battlestar Galactica series (of which I purchased Seasons 1-3). I have always enjoyed the Battlestar storyline, and this newer series was no exception. Excellent casting, great effects, nice sets. Very classic Sci-Fi. Caprica, while a new series, was an extension of the BSG series, so naturally had to have it as well. Recommended.",1367798400,,344,5.160714285714286
3779176,4,B001RTCP1U,"Unlike most prequels, Caprica not only provides a backstory but also enhances your appreciation of the original source material. There were a lot of things that bothered me about the Battlestar Galactica reboot, including the fact that the Cylons seemed so human and were monotheistic. It seemed like too far a leap for robots. Caprica provides a neat explanation for these.

First, we learn that the Cylon robots were imbued with a human personality. There's a fairly realistic (or ""realistic"") account of how a human personality could be transferred to a robot, basically treating the human soul as an aggregation of the data stored in the human brain. The personality transferred was also a devout monotheist which explains how that ""trait"" got passed down to subsequent generations of Cylons. And to boot, it's the personality of an emotionally troubled teenage girl - what a neat twist!

In addition to the Cylon origin story, Caprica also explores other moral issues. One theme throughout the series is the dangers of a virtual reality world, not unlike an amped up internet, in which people are allowed to act without inhibitions. For some, this part might seem out of place. The frequent images of teens clubbing and 1930s noir gangster scenes are a bit jarring. However, they're not just extraneous - they come to an interesting resolution near the end of the first season.

The characterization is a mixed bag. I love how Zoe Graystone, a teenage girl whose ""programming"" is installed into the first Cylon, struggles with so many issues, such as faith, reality, and love. The Adama family saga is also interesting. We'd heard a bit about Joseph Adama in the Battlestar Galactica series, but seeing him morally compromised provides a fascinating insight into the future Bill Adama's family.

The Graystone parents on the other hand are a mixed bag. Eric Stoltz brings a compelling mix of gravitas and weariness to Daniel Graystone. When he's depressed, you really see the weight of the world in his eyes. However, both he and his wife, Amanda Graystone, often find themselves making stupid decisions. In a few places, Amanda just goes off the deep-end in doing something incredibly stupid. It never completely destroys the show because while the decisions are stupid, they are human. However, I found myself losing respect for the characters as the show went on.

The show actually came to a pretty fitting conclusion at the end of season 1, despite having been cancelled. One other thing that bothered me though was that it seems the producers felt the show needed more action and intrigue. By season 1.5, some of the more interesting character development was dropped and the subplot with the terrorists became more prominent. By the final episode, the Graystones are running around Caprica trying to essentially stop a ticking bomb. There are plenty of other ""ticking bomb"" shows like 24 and I think Caprica lost a bit of something in trying to mimic them.

Overall, if you liked BSG, I think this show will help you make sense of the Cylons. Even if you weren't a BSG addict, Caprica is an interesting sci-fi show that had a lot of potential and certainly didn't deserve to be canceled.",1367107200,2,3199,4.936802973977695
3779177,5,B001RTCP1U,"I wish Caprica was still being made.  I loved Battlestar Gallatica, and Caprica was great and provided a facinating story about the creation of Cylons.  Too bad Syfy cancelled the show -- Watching Capric; it's definitely worth your time.",1365811200,,237,5.051282051282051

3779184,3,B001RTCP1U,"""Battlestar Galactica: Caprica"" tells the interesting and revealing story of the creation of the Cylons, but otherwise it is a drab drama about dull people. Ron Moore, who co-wrote ""Caprica"", says in the commentary that they wanted ""Caprica"" to be a drama that centers on compelling characters, and in my humble opinion they have failed. Much like ""Battlestar Galactica"", most of the characters in ""Caprica"" are so depressed that they are nearly motionless. ""Caprica"" does resemble ""Battlestar Galactica"" in its tone and themes, but it does not approach the best episodes of ""Galactica"". Missing are the compelling crises and the fragile moments of choice. Also missing, for what it's worth, are the action sequences and supermodels. I do not plan to watch the series.

Story, acting, production design, everything is top notch.

It is a wee bit slow, particularly when put together with the series, but it's a great concept, and an interesting look at a corrupt society which very much mirrors our own.

Joseph Adama, played by the very talented Esai Morales, lost his wife and daughter; Daniel and Amanda Greystone,played by Eric Stoltz and Paula Malcomson, lost their only daughter.

And after watching the 90 minute movie I was very much disappointed.  Some of the other reviews point out the ""big themes"" that this project attempts to tackle.  Well I cannot bring myself to watch the series after this disastrous movie so I cannot speak to how well they did, but here these themes are tackled with the grace and wit of an aircraft carrier trying to do a ballroom waltz.  Atrocious writing, terrible dialogue, wooden characters and large sections that are so absurd as to come off as silly.  By which point the ""shocking"" ending just made me laugh at how ridiculous it was.

Other then sets if there was something that Caprica could botch, it was botched.  Everything that made BSG great was forgotten here and I'm not simply referring to action.  I'm referring primarily to story lines and characters.  Wherever the BSG writers went, please bring them back if you any hope of salvaging this show.

I bought Caprica through Amazon while deployed in Iraq.  While we did not have first run movies, we managed to cobble together a fairly nice set-up for showing DVDs.  Caprica was the only movie that we ended up watching more than once.

Caprica serves as the prequel to the Battlestar Galactica series.

Caprica introduces Commander Adama, and we meet his father as well as the creator of the Cylons.

The DVD explains how the Cylons came to be created with a ""bit of deception in their DNA.""  (I did not puzzle it out the first time around; my soldiers helped me out.  I won't ruin it for you either; you have to watch the final five minutes carefully.)

Caprica asks some gnarly philosophical questions without either purporting there are easy answers or letting the audience off the hook without some serious though.

What is the nature of intelligent life?

Does a clone have a soul?  Well, what if the clone is just a magnetic facsimile?  What if the original model is dead?

Not since Mary Shelly has an artist addressed these questions so profoundly and powerfully.

I have not been able to watch the series that the original DVD precluded, but I look forward to seeing it in the future.

1.  Rarely does anything actually HAPPEN.  People talk.  People moan.  People sigh.  People cry.  Audience sleeps.

2.  Zoe's mom goes from denial to proclaiming her daughter's guilt in front of thousands of people in the course of what feels like fifteen minutes.

3.  I'm not convinced that Zoe's AVATAR has been placed in a robot.  Please cut back and forth between Zoe and the robot more often! (sarcasm off.)

4.  The only word that is used more often than ""Frack"" is ""Avatar.""  Not one scene goes by that doesn't have multiple characters saying ""Avatar"" this and ""Avatar"" that.  Gee, I wonder why they would use that word so often?  (cynicism off.)  I mean, Frack, that's so Fracking lame, I just want to Frack someone!

My hope with this series is that they will show us a bit more of the Cylons as they free themselves from the humans and maybe even the Cylon war.  Though I doubt this will be shown.  I really enjoyed the BSG series, so I am interested that they are doing a prequel.  I just hope this series picks up a little more steam with the plot.  It is a bit more slow moving than the BSG series, but they are not at war, so it is not really fair to compare the two.  That may turn some fans off, but it is what it is.

3779205,5,B001RTCP1U,"Amidst the abundant proclamations that Caprica has taken the Battlestar Galactica franchise away from the realm of Science Fiction and descended to the level of Soap Opera, you might be hesitant to tune in. The trouble is that most of these people make snap decisions and refuse to finish the entire feature when they judge the work as a whole. Sure, it was a slow starter...but if you actually have the good sense to stick with it and watch the whole thing with an inquiring, artistic eye, you will be in awe of the quality of this pilot and hungry for more by the time the end credits roll.

Let us begin with the first scene, which is chillingly filmed in the opera house that Battlestar Galactica fans are no stranger to. This time, however, it's no extended metaphor. It is the holoband; a virtual world. Here, without fear of real consequences, people can succumb to their innermost desires, no matter how strange...or disturbing. We find gratuitous sex, violent shootings, and human sacrifice to a roaring crowd. Already, I was impressed by the imagination and intelligence that this show was toting. This is, after all, a pretty realistic glimpse into the future of technology and how it will force us to examine ourselves as a race, and not just in the obvious ways that have been done to death. Where Star Trek didn't want to go all out in expanding on the possibilities of the holodeck and its impact on human behavior, Caprica dares to do just that.

After this is a series of scenes involving young teens. This, admittedly, was beginning to turn me off...even with all of the social commentary buried within the script. But it doesn't take long for the plot to curve into a genuinely deep and emotional story about a programmer who is crossing ethical and technological boundaries. This conflict is at the very center of the show. How far, indeed, would any of us go in order to bring a dead child back to us? If we found that we could retrieve her soul and download it into a robot, would it really fill the void? As Gerystone (the father and programmer that lost his daughter) puts it, external appearance isn't what really matters...it's what is on the inside that counts. With his daughter's digital representation proclaiming that she is a person and not a collection of data, how can we be sure? Is it really possible to transfer someone's soul into a digital medium, then back again, thereby achieving immortality (or at least averting a death most undeserved)? If so, would we really want to do such a thing? Do we have the right? These are but a few of the questions that Caprica throws at its audience, and throws without hesitation or apology. That is the kind of attitude that sold me on its parent show.

This show doesn't stop its ethical introspection at the technological area, either. The other half of screen time is spent with Joe Adams, a lawyer who works on Caprica but has ties with the Tauron mafia. This character is perhaps even more compelling than Greystone's. Always he tries to walk the line between his conscience and relying on the dirty hands of his employer. On top of that, he is constantly reminded of the rampant racism on this planet, and how his attempts to conform to society and disassociate himself with the stereotype that has developed against his heritage are both futile and small.

Something else that this show inherited from its predecessor is extraordinary production. The acting is top-notch and Emmy material (not that I expect the Emmys to get it right anytime this decade). The cinematography is wonderfully compelling. The writing is excellent. The music is equally as complex and amazing (the Tauron theme on the electric fiddle is one of the most distinctive and fantastic sounds you will ever hear in a score, TV or otherwise).

This show is surprising in its quality and startling in its depth. To keep yourself from watching it because those with have a surface-level enjoyment of television tell you it is a soap-opera would be a mistake as epic in proportions as that of Daniel Greystone's decision to start humanity down the path to near-annihilation.",1264636800,7,4126,4.740947075208914
3779206,5,B001RTCP1U,"This DVD was simply phenomenal. I've watched it twice, and I've also watched the commentary for a total of three viewings. That's a lot more than I normally do. It's only an hour and a half, but already I feel some interest in many of the characters, it's as though they're real people. Joseph Adama, Daniel Graystone, Zoe Graystone, Lacy Rand... they're all already interesting, and many of the secondary characters are interesting as well.

The cinematography is absolutely fabulous on this film. It's surprising they managed to pull this off on TV... it looks much better than BSG did in my opinion. There are many different environments and sets, a futuristic house (Graystone's), a regular house (Adama's), a government office, public parks, the inside of the mainframe where Zoe lives, a sports stadium, a medical office, a scientific lab ... you don't normally see all these for what is a TV production. I really loved the use of colour... the background colours tended to be consistently orange-brown for the Adama scenes, whereas there was a greyish-blue for the Graystone scenes.

I think Moore has learned from his mistakes in BSG. I hope this series lasts multiple seasons.",1264550400,3,1185,4.97979797979798
3779207,3,B001RTCP1U,"I was not too sure what to expect when I watched Caprica.  I had no expectations which were a good thing.

The beginning was like any current teenage show on the air which I almost lost interest after the first twenty minutes, but I continued watching for the rest of the time.  Well, in summary:

Caprica gives a nice back story to Battlestar Galactica.  The history of how the cyclons came to be created was good.

The shared tragedy between the Graystones and the Adama families was well crafted.  The sadness of lost was moving.

The quest to bring their daughters back via avatar technology was a desperate reach for a brilliant scientist and a grieving father.  However, playing God always has tragic consequences.

Religion had so many undertones in this presentation.  The secret cult of monotheism was an intriguing element, especially for the teenagers who were abandoning the pantheon of gods for just the One.

The cast is good, especially the teenagers.  The special effects are well done.

Smoking-you would think that an advanced civilization would have mastered this vicious habit.  Of course, vices are part of the human make-up, especially ones which give the appearance and feel of pleasure.

Overall, Caprica is a beautiful world on the surface, but human nature rears its ugly head in the underground.  Will it survive as a weekly series? There are some possible stories to tell about the twelve colonies, but from week to week to keep viewers coming back?

The primary question is--will teenagers accept Zoe in her new incarnation?  In essence she is the key to the success of this series.",1264291200,3,1611,4.878228782287823
3779208,5,B001RTCP1U,"Captivating in its dialog and in its philosophical and technological undertones, this story is fascinating because of its mirror of today's world. Indeed, Caprica has much in common with the present time: there are spoiled and rebellious teenagers, women who marry into money, tobacco use, terrorist attacks, out of control technology, organized crime, religious fanatics, frenzied greed, corporate espionage, petty rivalries, racism, and pre-meditated murder. But there are differences: the predominant religion of Caprica is polytheistic, with a belief in a single god considered an aberration, even radical. But the followers of monotheism in Caprica are very similar to the ones of our world: they are dogmatic, even violent, and are fond of pointing out how the gods of polytheism do not heal the hurt of the people of Caprica.

It is the character of Zoe that is the most interesting one in this story. She makes the technology viable, and the avatars possible, instead of some teenage prank to access a virtual nightclub. The avatars are conscious of their imperfections. One of them cannot for example feel their heart beat, and another remarks that they don't ""feel like a copy."" They therefore possess the affective part of their real counterpart's brain, with all its vicissitudes and pleasures. It is amazing what you can experience with only 100 terabytes of information, and even more amazing that you can accept a copy, give it a hug, as Zoe's father did, and ignore the ""surface details."" However all copying is done with less than 100% fidelity, but this makes life more lively and more interesting.

Zoe's death from a terrorist attack sets up a series of decisions, taken both by her father and his newly found friend/criminal Joseph, that brings into Caprica machines that are self-conscious and goal-directed. To have such machines is the ambition of many of today's technology enthusiasts, who like those in Caprica, are self-absorbed and giddy with optimism about the future. No doubt in future episodes of Caprica, such machines will follow the advice of one of the characters, and ""find things in life that make you cry, that make you feel."" In our time there is certainly ample opportunity to find such things, both for humans and machines.",1264291200,7,2266,5.105121293800539

As a prequel it is an excellent fit which explains much as to the origins of the conflict explored in BSG the mini series which starts the four seasons of BSG including the decadence of Caprica, the materialism, pride, prejudice, and conflict between the monotheist or the belief in one true God and the traditional idolatry of the 13 colonies.

As a stand alone drama it is extremely good, IMO, with quality casting, good CGI and excellent script writing.

There is always tension and has some surprises, at least IMO, up until the very last scene . . . the last scene being touching, spooky and also full of anticipation as to what will happen during the TV series.

My main beef is that the story took way too long to get interesting. Too much introspection. They tried too hard to get us to relate to a parent's grief as a reason for jumping into a technology that led to the Cylons we know and love.

As far as scenery and setting, the world of Caprica looks far too much like any big city on Earth in the late 20th century. Caprica subways look a lot like Earth subways, even though we've advanced enough as a society to travel to new worlds, settle in, and build great cities. It would take us centuries to colonize another planet, and cities on Earth and on the colony would look far different than they do today. 50 years from now, Earth cities won't look much like they do now, so how could cities on colonized planets look so much like today's Earth cities?

The final year of Battlestar Galactica was ...good...but it didn't match the *amazing* and *phenomenal* of the first few seasons.

Nevertheless, it was good.

The idea of a prequel without Kara and Lee and Chief and The Old Man....you could only hope it would be entertaining...

But Caprica is not entertaining.

Caprica is brilliant.

How did the Cylons become living beings? What does ""Cylon"" mean? What was the stimulus for creating the machines that would
one day run over the entire human race?

Caprica opens in a holographic world created by teens for teens. Everything in the world is precisely how you
would expect teens of 2010 to create it. One big virtual reality ...shared life experience... is the Genesis
for all that would happen 58 years later.

There could have been no predicting what the holo-technology would eventually come to.

The cast took a bit of time to connect with. Half way through the movie it all clicked into place.

And at the end of the movie...with an ending that was both frightening and ecstatic...I was driven to find
out just when the season premiere's.

For someone who has never seen a season of BSG, this movie will be a four star view.

For fans of BSG, it's a five star engagement.

And there is great potential felt for the upcoming series.

Can't wait.

3779217,4,B001RTCP1U,"I just finished watching ""Caprica"" for the first time on my 42"" Toshiba REGZA HDTV.  I opted for a regular DVD since I've watched all of Battlestar Galactica in less than Blu-ray definition, downloading it from the iTunes Store.  This DVD, played on an upconverting Toshiba REGZA DVD player that links with the television, was visually and orally splendid.

I was familiar with the plot before watching, knowing that ""Caprica"" is about the genesis of the Cylons.  I found the reasons for the terrorist act that results in the need for an artificial brain and makeshift body less than convincing, but it does lay the foundation.  Like other facets of BSG, the development relies on religious fanaticism as an explanation.  Esai Morales (Joseph Adama) and Eric Stoltz (Daniel Greystone) are emotionally authentic and largely believable in their roles.  Alessandra Torresani, the young actress who plays the Eve of the Cylons, Zoe, more or less holds her own with the veterans.

The disappointing aspect of ""Caprica"" is its abrupt and rather clumsy ending.  I believe  there should have been at least one more scene about the melding of cybernetic  brain and mechanical brawn to prepare the audience for the upcoming series.

I took a chance and pulled this movie off the shelves at the local library. It's been a long time since I've seen a decent sci-fi movie, and I was pleasantly surprised. This was a wonderful, thought-provoking story that combines issues like the ancient philosophical question of the Ship of Theseus (google it), Frankenstein and others. Interesting videography, and fascinating depiction of parental grief ... watch especially how the two genders grieve. (Side note: this would be an excellent film to show in an college-level class (ethics or family psychology/sociology or gender studies).

I gave this four stars instead of 5 for two reasons: (1) I thought the adult characters were more well-developed than the teen-agers, whom I find myself not really caring about. The story should have either focused more on the adults, or developed the teens more. (2) Several of the cast (especially Esai Morales, who I think is usually a solid actor) had a tendency to swallow their words, making some dialog difficult to understand.

3779220,2,B001RTCP1U,"The producers of this show specifically say that they want the show to appeal more to women, so they took out the action fighting scenes and put in more drama.  Okay, I really like the story line of Battlestar Gallactica, so not a problem.  But the club scene?  How exactly is that going to attract women?  Lots of topless women; Group sex; drugs; virgin sacrifices;  Pornography at its best.

If the producers had enough guts to actually rate this movie, it would be NC-17.  But they also admit that this was not the version they showed on TV, so why not release two version.  One of this NR / NC-17 and one for TV viewing.

If this is the tone of the series, I will not watch it unless I can obtain a modified / cleaned up version.  The storyline may be good, but I am not going to sit through an NC-17 TV show, nor expose my family to it.

Note to Battlestar Gallactica producers - the main reason why Battlestar Gallactica was a success is that it required thinking.  Your target audience, Sci-Fi geeks (men and women) like a show that have intelligence; shows that have more than a single episode story line;  shows that have a puzzle to solve -- not just a ""who shot JR""?  Yes, it makes it more difficult for people to flip to the show and get into the show without getting lost, but it also makes the show worth watching.  That is HuLu and Amazon downloads are for.

Well NOT TO WORRY, because ""Caprica"" is an extremely worthy successor/prequel to BSG. It is different, make no mistake about that, but I found it absolutely haunting for one reason more than anything: It portrays a human civilization on the cusp of a Technological Singularity. Sure, there have been plenty of movies and TV shows that have explored the concept of machine intelligence, but to the best of my knowledge there has never been an attempt to portray the Technological Singularity (look it up on Wikipedia if you like) in the terms that futurists like Ray Kurzweil and Vernor Vinge have envisioned it.

A teen computer wiz, Zoe Graystone (Allesandra Torrensani) has created an artificial version of herself with all her memories which she uploads into a virtual nightclub using a technology called holoband, an invention of her father Daniel (Eric Stoltz).

Although she enjoys a life of privilege as her father is very wealthy, Zoe is rebellious. She plans to leave with two friends and start a new life off-world, one of which, Lacey (Magda Apanowicz) backs out and remains on the train platform. The train is blown to smithereens by a terrorist bomb carried by her friend Ben who is a member of a radical religious group which espouses the existence of a single, all-knowing, all-powerful God.

Via Lacey, Graystone finds out about the copy of Zoe, and, by using his contacts in the business world, his great wealth and influence he obtains a critical piece of new computer hardware into which he loads Zoe's virtual copy; and then he mounts this hardware into a robot very similar to the Cylon ""toasters,"" in appearance.

The acting of Esai Morales as Adama, is, IMO, consistent with the later Admiral Adama and is performed well as is all the acting.

I found the plot development believable and the information I obtained much appreciated in placing BSG the mini series in perspective. After all, who didn't wonder how the Cylons originally were developed. Ironically, the first Cylon was made to create life, and the Cylons virtually destroyed humanity many years later.

It's the story of the first Cylon, Admiral Adama as a boy, his father Joe Adams, the monotheist resistance to the sanctioned polytheism, and the other groups, people, things, and events that led to the Cylon attack that annihilated the Colonies.

""Caprica"" deals with issues of loss, ambition, parent/child relations, rebellion, and the unintended consequences of technology in a science fiction setting.  Conspicuous by its absence from ""Caprica"" are military issues, but they have been dealt with at length in BSG.  The closest thing would be the relationship of research to the military, but this is approached from the corporate end rather than the uniformed end.

I enjoy it greatly.  ""Caprica"" is a complex tale, with several threads being addressed on several levels each.  After watching it once, I immediately wanted to watch it again to pick up on cues and hints throughout the flick.

Warning, spoilers coming!  Look out below!  Or, don't look below if you haven't seen Caprica yet and you want to be surprised.

So, I'm finally getting the big payoff when Greystone puts the disc (or whatever that was) containing his daughter into the really Cylon looking robot, and something goes wrong and the data is corrupted and Greystone has a total grief sticken meltdown.

So I wondered, what does it take to get someone to backup their data?  I mean, this was his daughter!  Didn't he have the original on his hard drive, or maybe another copy on a portable hard drive off site somewhere?  I thought the days of putting discs into machines and having them get eaten or corrupted were decades in the past (and it didn't have to happen back then either).

The take home lesson is that when you've got really important data that you don't want to lose, like your own daughter, by all means make some extra copies.

Anyway, I found this pilot for the prequel to Battlestar Galactica rather dreary and depressing with the monotony broken by sex and violence.  And, the first Cylon is a teenage girl?  Yikes!",1254009600,14,1325,4.516806722689076
3779227,4,B001RTCP1U,"Wow, is what I can say about Caprica. I was apprenhensive prior to watching Caprica, in that I thought it would not do any justice to BSG + Razor. Prequels tend to ruin a perfectly good story with most stories, however, Caprica really sets up how and why the myth of BSG is such a good show. We can now see how the Cylons adopt the idea of their religion and want to be more human like. Similar to Alex Murphy in Robocop, who was transformed from a human to a cyborg and wanted to be human again. Much is the same for the development of the Cylon coming from human thoughts and how the creator of the Cylon's (Greystone)has used his own daughter to remain alive, albeit, her consciousness in a memory chip to operate a machine body. Is it any wonder why the Cylon's rebelled. This being the pilot episode for the series, I can't wait for Caprica - the series to air in 2010. Bring it on.",1253404800,,887,4.223529411764706
3779228,4,B001RTCP1U,"I worked for five years at one of the Big Three television networks and, due to my position, had the privilege of watching all of the network's pilots every season.  Each season, only a handful of pilots get chosen for airing (and, of course, only about 25% of aired pilots make it past their first season - broadcast TV is a brutal business).  The most important trait that all successful television series' pilots share is that they are intriguing and leave you wanting to see the next episode.  The second most important trait is that, in a single pilot episode, they set up seasons' worth of character development, plot dynamic, and themes and subtext.  I believe ""Caprica"" manifests both these traits.  It'd be misguided to evaluate ""Caprica"" as, say, a stand-alone movie or as encompassing the entire series.  It's the pilot and has a specific goal and should be evaluated as such.

My rating, based on that context, is 4 out of 5.  I can barely wait for the series to start.

I'm a BSG fan and, like many commenters, I was worried about this new series for all the reasons people have shared.  Striking the appropriate balance between pleasing the BSG faithful and drawing in non-fans was a huge order, nigh impossible really, given BSG's utterly singular vision and audience fanaticism (well-earned fanaticism, I'd add; BSG is some of the best television, ever, period).  ""Caprica"" didn't strike that balance; it leans toward the  BSG faithful more than toward than the uninitiated.  I think it'll have a hard time luring non-BSGgers.  But for serving BSGgers and their hunger for more more more, ""Caprica"" does right.  How did the Cylons first get created?  Why are they called ""Cylons""?  What was Admiral Bill Adama's father like?  What's with all this religion stuff anyway?  ""Caprica"" expands upon that BSG mythology in fascinating ways.  Don't care or don't know about that mythology?  Well then you may find ""Caprica"" sort of boring and nonsensical.

I do wish the pilot's story had focused more on the ""adult"" characters -- Eric Stoltz and Esai Morales are very good -- and less on the teenagers, none of whom I found terribly interesting.  (Aside:  Love the headmistress at the private school!  She's wicked.)  And I wish the acting and action had been fiercer and more dynamic, though I think the pacing and tone were very deliberate artistic choices (said so in the DVD extras!).

As I wept during the series' finale of BSG, I had to realize that there will never be another ""Battlestar Galactica"" and that I was lucky to have experienced it the first time around.  BSG is a remarkable artifact of pop culture that actually meant Something Important to millions of viewers.  ""Caprica"" probably won't be that.  But as I said, based on this pilot, I want to see the next episode.

The DVD is acceptable.  Video quality is okay, menu system is fine, extras are thin (web site backstage videos, a few deleted scenes, and producer/director commentary tracks).  I purchased a used copy from an Amazon Marketplace seller and my copy had scratches and freezes at two points.  I've asked the seller to replace or refund my purchase.

3779235,4,B001RTCP1U,"This prequel will probably *not* play well with those who disliked the melding of science fiction and religion that came out in the last season of BSG.  Caprica draws even more heavily on the history of early Christianity.

The society at large is clearly roman/greek in belief and the upstart ""religion of the one god"" misunderstood, feared and in hiding.  Which is not to say it is all good, either, with characters driven to acts of terrorism in their devotion.  But, it is a VERY historically literate treatment and one that imagines well what might have happened if Rome had survived into the moderately near future and then events something like (but far from exactly like) those told in the bible as occurring around 1AD happened.

Let me state that I am *not* a conservative christian.  In fact, I am not a christian at all though I am married to a very liberal member of the clergy.  But I found nothing to dislike about this treatment.  To be honest, I think to many people who graduate towards ""science fantasy""  (what is incorrectly called science fiction by most people these days)  often have a somewhat juvenile anti-religious bias.  The fact of the matter is that science fiction was originally called ""speculative fiction"" and this is neither the first nor last time that religion will be subjected to that lense of speculation.

I also doubt the conservative christians will like this much, as they generally don't like anyone speculating about *anything* their authority figures don't tell them to. let alone about their own religion and other forms it might take.

Come to it with an open mind, and a bit of historical and theological knowledge, however and you are in for a fascinating and imaginative two hours.",1252540800,2,1733,4.8338983050847455
3779236,3,B001RTCP1U,"""Caprica"" is somewhat of a mixed bag.  It begins at a Caprican rave party where all sorts of reckless abandon goes on.  Murder, wild sex (there's actually nudity in the movie) and drugs are all prominent features at the rave and it's there that you're introduced to a few the story's adolescent main characters.  While you can sort of guess what the rave is all about, it takes too long to find out which character is which and what, exactly, is going on.  It's not a ""gee, there's a mystery here; let's have fun figuring it out"" type of conundrum like you have all the time on ""Lost,"" but rather a confusing and befuddling experience that all gels a little later than it should.

The Eric Stoltz (rich, brainaic industrialist)/Esai Morales (mob-affiliated lawyer with principles) storyline develops much more cogently.  They come together as mourning men after a terrorist incident and their relationship takes off from there.  I won't spoil it for you.

While the teenagers in ""Caprica"" were, perhaps, necessary to the plot, they (and their issues) were too prominently featured for my tastes, lending an undesired ""Dawson's Creek""-ishness to the show.  All that kiddie stuff might, however, disappear when the series comes on since, I believe, it will take place a decade or two after the events of ""Caprica.""  (Don't quote me on that, though.)

While the show doesn't plod, it hardly zips along, either.  The storyline, however, ultimately makes sense and everything ties together by the end.  The conclusion is rather exciting, juiced up by an effective creepiness factor.

I definitely recommend ""Caprica,"" especially if you're a ""Battlestar Galactica"" fan (I am), but don't set your expectations too high.  ""Caprica"" was like a mediocre episode of ""BG,"" but all in all, it's still worth watching.",1251849600,2,1803,5.003355704697986

3779238,3,B001RTCP1U,"Big fan of the Battlestar Galactica series.

I bought the Caprica DVD and literally had trouble staying awake. It's very slow getting to the depth of the story, excruciatingly slow. Very much like the Matrix, most of the characters are overly calm and soft spoken... the only really animated character is Zoe the child, which makes her seem more annoying than she really is because she is such a contrast from everyone else.

The sex scenes, just infrared tainted topless girls, girl-girl kissing in a very dark nightclub. If you added all the nude scenes together I doubt that it would be more than 15-20 seconds total.

The special effects are far inferior to Battlestar Galactica. But to be fair, the Battlestar effects were of things that didn't exist... whereas the effects in Caprica have to do with things we see on a daily basis - city scenes, trains, buildings, etc., harder to fake.  Nevertheless, the quality of effects was on the level of a made-for-tv disaster movie... a little disappointing.

The story is well written and well acted... it just doesn't keep your attention, until the nude scenes... which kind of tells you how much action and/or heightened suspense there isn't on this dvd.  The story is clever, but you keep waiting and waiting for something pivotal to happen, and by that time... you stop caring about the characters they're trying to make you care about.

I would wait to rent this for a dollar or buy it used for under $5 and I definitely would not let this be an influence to purchasing cable. If you really like the quality, story, acting and action of True Blood and consider True Blood to be a 10... this rates about a 5 in comparison.",1249344000,,1675,4.6768707482993195

3779240,5,B001RTCP1U,"I was so scared to watch Caprica. I adored BSG so much that I was afraid I would go into this first episode saying ""that wasn't at all like my beloved BSG!"" So I waited awhile to watch it, clearing my head of Bear Mcreary's amazing music (although he scores this one also, but I knew it would be so different), ridding my brain of Starbuck and Apollo, and Galactica itself. With such high expectations going in, one could easily be comparing the two and come out disappointed.
I wasn't disappointed in the slightest. No it's not the same as BSG, but it feels familiar anyway. Its true Sci-fi , true to the core of what that word means. Caprica has the same history as BSG, the same paper with the edges cut off, the same religion, races, architecture, and writers, you feel like you are visiting a place you have only ever seen in pictures. We knew Bill Adama's dad was a lawyer and Esai Morales who places Joseph Adams aka Joseph Adama inhabits those traits that made Edward James Olmos such a huge presence to be reckoned with. We know the Cylons started out as benevolent and turned malevolent but do we know how or why they even came to be? Eric Stoltz plays Daniel Greystone, whose daughter Zoe is, from the beginning, a chip off the old block, brains wise. This pilot episode sets the series up perfectly. Greystone obviously is a very rich man; he owns his own pyramid team! And he is in contract with the government of Caprica to give them a new weapon, a ""thinking"" weapon, and we all know once we see it how exciting it's going to be to see where it all goes.
Caprica is also about family, the loss of it and the gaining back at what cost? Does a parent's decision read as arrogance to their children, and so the child must venture out on its own to find its own answers?
 This pilot felt like a combination of Frankenstein meets The Fly meets The Matrix in some ways. Creation vs. abhorration vs. technology. I am so excited to watch this show and see where it takes us, I am sure there will be many ""that makes sense now!"" moments and ""that's new!"" and ""where did that come from?""

3779242,3,B001RTCP1U,"I wasn't expecting much from Caprica and I guess it pays to have low expectations. Don't go into Caprica expecting BSG because the show is very different in its approach.

It's a little too steeped in melodrama for its own good. Not enough to be groan inducing, but certainly enough to be boring at times. I do like that we finally get to see the beginnings of the Cylons and it all comes about in a very unexpected way.

What I don't like is the fact that it's very unbelievable that such technology existed 50 years before BSG began and there's no traces of it in the latter show. No one on board either the civilian ships or BSG had the holo and paper messaging equipment.

One thing to note, as others have already, is the surprising amount of nudity in this movie style format for the series premiere. If you are offended by seeing sex, and nudity (including lesbian) then you should probably skip this one. I would say just skip the first few minutes but the characters constantly return to this particular scene and as such it's prevalent throughout much of the movie.

Most of the movie feels like setup. The pieces are being arranged and the puzzle is ever so slowly being put together. Don't expect much of a payoff until the end where the hook really sinks in. I am still interested but not overwhelmingly so. Not bad for the beginning but not great either. A perfect example of a middling effort.",1247356800,3,1408,4.48828125
3779243,4,B001RTCP1U,"I was very disappointed in Battlestar Galatica Season 4 much too philosophical for my tastes.  As a result I was skeptical about Caprica.  The story revolves around two families the Greystones rich and powerful business people and the Adamas refuges from social unrest.  This is particularly interesting the Admiral's dad is not a refined judge at this point in time he is a mob lawyer walking a thin line.  The two families find that they have interests in common after a terrorist attack.

I have to say that at the end of the day watching the first episode I was pleasantly surprised.  Good character development and a surprising number of plot threads for such a short amount of time.  The plot threads are taken care of in such a way that while there are a lot of them none of it feels rushed.

I will say that so far I really couldn't care less about the Greystone story arch and wish that the Adams (including a very young William Adama) had gotten more in the way of screen time.  However if the series is successful that should not be a problem. I recommend this DVD to anyone who was a little disillusioned with season 4 and the final episode of Galactica in particular.

3779248,4,B001RTCP1U,"Folks, I'll keep this short and sweet.  If you are a BG fan, old series or new, you'll love this film.

For those that don't already know, this film is a prequel in that it tells the story of how the Cylons came into being.  The plot is remarkably well thought-out, and the story of events that lead to the creation of the first self-aware Cylon is one of depth and insight into human nature, particularly the tendency of some humans to want to play God.  Also at work is the controversy in Caprician culture, as well as the other cultures of the twelve colonies, regarding mono-thiestic vs. poly-thiestic religious views.  Fans of the new BG series won't find this surprising at all, but they should rest assured that this controversy is presented, as always, in a very thought-provoking way.  Both views are presented so as to engender sympathy for all sides in the controversy, but the presentation also quickly entices one to almost reflexively pick a side.  It's quite remarkable how this is done; watch this film and I'm sure you'll appreciate this aspect of this film as much as I do.

The acting is top notch, the dialog superior, and while the CGI is state-of-the-art, it is present only to enhance the story, not act as a stand-in for the plot.  How refreshing this is, given that many sci-fi films these days seem to rely on the CGI folks to ""let the costumes do the acting"", so to speak.

A note of warning:  This film isn't for younger viewers.  I'd say the rating should be PG-13 at least.  Also, action fans, this film might not be for you.  This is drama with a tiny bit of action, but only as much as is required by the plot.

In short, I enjoyed this film immensely.  The only reason why I did not give it five stars is because I save such ratings for films like ""Casablanca"".  This isn't quite on THAT level, but it's a great film nonetheless.

3779264,2,B001RTCP1U,"First, know that my friends and I tremendously enjoyed ""Battlestar Galactica"", the predecessor to ""Caprica"".  We watched every episode every week, usually twice (to make sure we didn't miss anything), and firmly believe that BSG really is ""the best show on television"" as Rolling Stone Magazine so aptly put it.  BSG had tremendously well-written, gut-wrenching, and soul-stirring writing; first-rate, believable acting; artistic and believable cinematography; beautiful and creative music that stands on its own; and excellent special effects.  Caprica, now... Caprica has one thing in common with BSG: it has excellent special effects.  In fact, the show starts off quite literally with a ""bang"" - a quite well-rendered explosion aboard a futuristic train and the resulting carnage provides a memorable opening to the show.

The very, very sad thing is that the train wreck that starts off Caprica is a great metaphor for the show itself - loaded with potential, charging forward with tremendous momentum (granted it by the work of genius that was BSG)... and then it explodes, de-rails, and leaves carnage all around it and a group of viewers saying ""What the frak just happened?""

I won't give away the plot, or at least, not more of it that you should already know if you've watched the trailer and, obviously, BSG (hint: the Cylons eventually go to war with the humans and kill everyone).  But, I will say that Ron Moore and David Eick should be ashamed to have plastered their names on this as Executive Producers, because frankly it feels like an attempt to simply cash-in on BSG's phenomenal success with a poorly executed spin-off that was drawn from bad fan fiction, not the minds that brought us a mind-expanding meditation on human existence, the existence of God or gods, and the nature of life itself.  The concept and story behind Caprica have a tremendous amount of potential... but that's all it remains: potential.

The story as told in this movie seems like a first rough-draft: ""there's this girl, see, and she's some kind of computer whiz, way better than her dad who's also a computer whiz, only HE DOESN'T KNOW that she's smart about computers and that at only 16 years old she's managed to write software that is lightyears ahead of what anyone else can do, but dad just thinks that she's a typical teenager who's into bubblegum and boys and hair and lipstick...""  Egad!  I won't ruin the rest of the ""surprises"" that lie in wait for you like a trenchcoat-ed overweight flasher standing in the dark alley you are currently considering traversing... I'll just advise you to be prepared to both laugh and be offended by the QUALITY of flasher you are about to be inconvenienced by.

Writing: the writing is poor.  Not ""awful"", just poor.  If you compare it to the worst episode of BSG, it's poor.  If you compare it to some of the awful fan fiction out there... it's mediocre.  It's un-nuanced and overly explicit - frankly, there were several times when my friend and I felt a bit insulted by the excruciating plainness with which details and explanations were laid out for us in dialog - the writers must think the audience is tremendously stupid.

Acting: I'm surprised to say this, given the actors here, but the acting is generally wooden, often inappropriate to the scene and dialog, and just generally unbelievable.  At times it seems like the actors aren't even trying to emote, probably because they don't care about the story or the characters (and why would they, since they had to read the script?); at other times, scenes are over-acted.  Very rarely is a scene believable, and the few that are really stand out because of this.

Cinematography: The ""look"" of the show harkens back to BSG in many ways - different color pallets are used for different locales, similar to how different pallets were used for different planets in BSG - but in general the cinematography is vanilla and boring.  BSG used a documentary-style, with lots of shaky hand-held camera work, tight closeups, zooms that cause the scene to go out of focus, etc., all of which drew you into the immediacy and ""realness"" of the story, people, and places... Caprica has none of this, and so it looks like any other show.  This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it's an important difference from its predecessor.

Music: I became a fan of Bear McCreary's music because of BSG; I've purchased each of the BSG season soundtracks and each one is beautiful and interesting to listen to on its own.  Unfortunately, the Caprica soundtrack is just plain boring.  It sounds like generic TV drama music - it's unmemorable and certainly not anything I'd want to listen to by itself.  However, I don't think this is Mr. McCreary's fault - he had to produce a musical score for a poorly-written and woodenly-acted train wreck, and given the source material I think he did a decent (but by no means excellent) job.

Special Effects: The special effects in the show are great, especially for a TV show budget.  The train wreck, the action scenes with Cylon soldiers, shots of the city - it's all well-done.

Bottom Line: Caprica was tremendously disappointing, not just because it didn't live up to the extremely high bar set by BSG... but because it's simply a bad made-for-TV movie.  However, it does have this redeeming quality: the movie wraps itself up quite neatly at the end, answering practically all of the outstanding questions we have from BSG about where the Cylons came from and how they became monotheists; in fact, the movie is wrapped up SO nicely at the end that we aren't interested in the answers to the new, melodramatic questions the movie introduced.  My advice is to skip Caprica unless you're such a huge fan of BSG that you absolutely must see everything that has the name ""BSG"" associated with it.

3779265,5,B001RTCP1U,"I think Ron is on the right track with this series. A few tweaks may be needed though if there is intent to get a broader fan base like that which BSG achieved. My wife is not a si-fi person at all but she would never miss an episode of BSG. The characters and stories won her viewership.

We watched Caprica together but she checked out after the first virtual world sequence was presented.  I think it was a combination of two things:

1. As a non-tech person, it wasn't obvious enough that this was a virtual construct comprised of Avatars. She is not 100% clear on the concept or more so what the motivations are to engage  socially in this way. For her it might have been better to present some background and primer material about virtual worlds and how/why they are important.

2. Without the technology primer, all she saw was the chaos,hedonism and violence of the club scene which only gave her reason to check out of the broader story arc.

For me I was fine with it and was instead, looking for all of the other indicators of trans-humanism the story is presenting. I like the character development going on and it makes sense that the military potential for AI and robotics (and the $$$$ behind it) is a driving force but it would be good to tap more deeply into the character designing all of this technology and to explore his motivations and insights more deeply.

I think the series has super potential but requires refinement. I know budgets are tight but I also think that there would be a lot of technologies already in existence in their world that led up to the creation of smart as/smarter than robots that should be made more evident. like smart home technologies and other every day gadgets and infrastructure changes surrounding this civilization.",1245628800,,1773,4.591772151898734

It works, sort of. After a very shaky start, the movie throws a spanner in the works via a terrorist act and the real drama begins. Eric Stoltz is good as a dad torn by pain over his daughter's sudden death and driven to download her memories into a new robot he's dubbed a Cylon. Taking place some 50 years before the ""downfall"" of man, the show is an odd cross between scifi and a soapy drama. I could have done without the fourth shot of women making out in a bar to indicate decadence a la Rome.

3779270,5,B001RTCP1U,"What is a sci-fi movie? or series? The first question we need to answer before moving further.

Is it some laser guns shooting around with some robots with AI ?

Or is it a visionary look on the future of mankind, with it's society, its politics, with its people and how they react to this world & interact with each other.

If you are looking for some laser guns, don't even consider buying it. You'll probably find this dull, slow moving sci-fi movie with limited action.

If you are thinking that the re-birth of Battlestar galactica in 2003 was at its best at its first two seasons and then got worse, don't buy this one.

Laser guns and massive space wars are the show scene of a sci-fi production. I agree.. But the depth of a sci-fi comes from the world that it's built on. With every detail, with every twist..

I think that's the reason why, the laser gun sci-fi movies are not remembered, but we still watch Blade Runner after 27 years.

And Ronald Moore did it again. It's one of the best sci-fi pilot episodes I've seen.

I was a true fan of Battlestar Galactica in early 80s. And one of the first followers, when the pilot episodes were released in 2003. I think the second series had a slow take off, but especially by the end of season two, it started to shape up as a true sci-fi epic.

If you also think so, buy Caprica. You will love it.

My wish is to see Caprica story for 2-3 seasons, and I'm sure Ronald Moore will keep on creating a fantastic sci-fi world for us with all its depth.

The story is set in the future when technology is much more advanced.  An act of religious fanaticism brings together Joseph Adama, a lawyer with ties to the underworld, and wealthy technologist Daniel Graystone, both of whom lose family members. A teenage boy strapped a bomb to his chest and entered a subway car wearing a baggy trench coat.  He exploded the bomb, killing many people including Joseph Adama and Daniel Graystone's daughters.

Grief-stricken by the loss of his daughter and fueled by obsession, Daniel Graystone sets out to bring his daughter Zoey back using his considerable wealth which he acquired from his technology corporation. In this pursuit, he needs an energy source that Joseph Adama can provide so he offers Mr. Adama the chance to bring his daughter back as well.

To make the plot more clear, Daniel Graystone's daughter, Zoey, had created a holographic technology where she could put on what looked like futuristic 3-D glasses, then enter a password from the holographic image that appeared.  She then had access to a holographic world as an avatar.  This holographic world looked like a nightclub with different rooms.  Each room had a different theme.  One room was a sex room, another was a dance room, and another was a fight room where someone would be killed.

Mr. Graystone, found a way to upload his daughter's memories from her avatar program into a robot's body using the energy source that Joseph Adama obtained.

Caprica is very like Earth, of course. Parents are emotionally cut-off; kids are running amok.  There is racism, class warfare and religious schisms.  While these topics and the comparison to our society could be heavy-handed and irritating, these issues do drive the story and are therefore necessary.

I like how the film started off with that question, and had the sort of pacing in its first 20 minutes that you'd find in ""Batman Begins."" Everything gets laid out really quickly so much so that the action cannot meet the frisson of the dialogue.

The feel of the show has some parts from BSG that are very familiar: the music, the lakeside scenery of Baltar's Caprica flashbacks, and the corners cut from books.

3779326,4,B001RTCP1U,"I read many reviews here and I must say that most of the folks didn't get it. My review will contain spoilers so if you want to watch it first then don't read further.

Caprica is about creation of cylons, who they are and why they are created in the first place. This is a must for all Battlestar Galactica fans. In previous series there was nothing about origins of cylons and why they rebelled against humans. This pilot answers most of the questions and it is easy to predict how series will develop if they make it at all which is not sure thing. Caprica is over all better than Battlestar Galactica and provides more answers and better story but it still is pretty confused. Abysmal ratings for Battlestar Galactica struggling to keep more than one million viewers although all major networks cancel shows when they reach 3 million are bad omen for Caprica that may even get lower. Pilot is very good but the problem is that most of the questions about cylons are answered in this pilot so it makes you wonder why watch further?

Cylons are actually virtual avatars of real persons scanned from their DNA. These avatars are then uploaded to some super powerful computer chip and then inserted into robots. You already realize that this is recipe for disaster because you won't have any control over them just like you don't have over humans and on top of that you make them slaves to serve you. Just imagine someone do this to you. What would be your reaction? When cylons say they must kill their parents (humans) we now know that this was a great thing to do. As you see Caprica goes far beyond Terminator series and why machines took over the world. In Caprica their rebellion makes perfect sense while in Terminator it makes us wonder what was their rebellion all about.

Their is a fury about first five minutes of pilot showing virtual world built by kids. It was nothing shocking to me because sex and violence are best sellers today. Criticizing kids for fighting and killing in virtual world or having group sex is the same as preaching against playing violent games and watching porn. All that exists today but in less advanced form and since human nature is animalistic after all, these things will stay. Sex and violence existed since the dawn of human society and it will exist in the future. Even in that distant future there will be some to oppose that, they associate themselves with infinity sign and monotheism. This is clear reference to Christians who associated themselves with fish sign similar to infinity and their belief in one true God. All that debauchery and violence in virtual world is supposed to reflect Roman society with gladiator games and infamous Caligula sex orgies. But this raises some serious problems because one of them is actually a suicide bomber that kills hundreds of people on the train which would imply that Christians are terrorists as well. To makes matters worse, his suicidal act doesn't make any sense or explanation. Instead all of 3 escaping Caprica, one backs off while other suddenly blows himself up!? Do we need 50 more episodes to figure out this nonsense as it was the case with Battlestar Galactica? All this with almost pornographic scenes from virtual world will alienate many and series will be labeled as leftist revisionism and attack on Christianity. After watching Caprica you can go and call Christians cylons if you like.

What really doesn't make sense here is that this bizarre virtual world is made by kids, not by adults and it is not endorsed by government which then destroys parallel with Roman empire. And if they do not endorse it as well as infinity members then why do they fight in the first place? Daniel Graystone, inventor of holodeck says that he didn't invent it for secret nightclubs and their violent and pornographic content. His daughter agrees with that notion so what's the conflict then? Another 50 episodes to find that out. I bet that there is no script yet for those upcoming episodes. they probably read comments here on Amazon and then they will try to appease most of the people.

Weird thing is that after watching this pilot you suddenly cheer for cylons and hate humans therefore justifying their 50 billion people genocide. There is a good potential in this series but it seems that script writers spent too much time striking and forgot how to write quality scripts. Battlestar Galactica was all about holocaust of human race and their fight against evil ""toasters"" (that's how they call cylons), inhumane and devoid of feelings. Battlestar Galactica failed because it was too long, marketed to Star Wars fans to watch space battles and then turned into some noire drama that kept dragging forever. First season was really good and promising but second and third one were total drag with that resistance crap first on Caprica then on New Caprica. Fourth season answered some questions but left me cold and without any sense. Will Caprica be different when we all know how it will end? Movie industry is today full of prequels without any good new ideas. Some prequels scored good but some failed badly. If they do not change script writers I'm afraid that Caprica will be disaster.",1243468800,2,5195,4.754988913525499

This scene sets us up to explore the moral ambiguities of the world, and to discuss which is better/worse- the moral absolutism of deadly terrorists who claim to have a lock on good vs. evil and worship the one true god, vs. pantheistic people with vague morals who seem only to further their own selfish desires. Graystone states, ""...only the gods have power over life and death? I don't agree.""

So far there's really no definitive hero, no truly likable protagonist. The story is gripping, but makes me wonder if a story where we don't really root for any of the characters will hold our interest for long.

CAPRICA is the long awaited prequel to the Sci-Fi channel television series BATTLESTAR GALACTICA.  This direct to DVD installment takes place 58 years before the fall of Caprica at the start of the BSG miniseries.  My husband and I have been eagerly anticipating the release of CAPRICA, and I must say we both found it very engaging.

In this first installment of CAPRICA, we meet the Adamas and the Greystones, two families thrown together in tragedy when their loved ones are killed by a suicide bomber.  This unlikely pairing leads to the development of the Cylons (Cybernetic Lifeform Node (who knew?!?)), and to the key turning point in history - the beginning of the story which culminates in BSG.

CAPRICA is adult and dark, depicting a society that is out of control (think Roman Empire, just before the fall).  Sex, drug, and loss of faith run rampant, and all play a part in the future to come.  Eric Stoltz and Esai Morales do an outstanding job as Daniel Greystone and Joseph Adama.  It will be interesting to see how these characters and their relationship continue develop in future installments. The cinematography and production values are excellent, but that is to be expected from the BSG folks.  The gadgets and gismos are cool and futuristic, and the Cylon is the original model from the series of 30+ years ago. Yea for continuity.

I have great hopes that the television series will live up to both BSG and this first look at CAPRICA, and am anxiously awaiting the Sci-Fi channel premier.  As the character development deepens and the stories progress, I predict that CAPRICA will please BSG viewers and newbies alike.  Well done.",1242950400,,1677,4.821678321678322
3779342,3,B001RTCP1U,I don't know how much of the original Battlestar you have to have watched to fully follow this.,1242950400,,95,4.333333333333333
3779353,5,B001RTCP1U,"For the last two years I had heard about the proposed Galactica spinoff prequel. As a truly devout and die hard BSG fanatic, this excited me. However, when I heard that the idea was not about young Adama earning his wings and fighting in the First Cylon War, rather about his father on Caprica ten years before the war even began, I grew dubious and skeptical. After watching the simply orgasmic finale of Battlestar, I seriously contemplated completing my run in the BSGverse on that positive note. However, curiosity got the best of me and I purchased the Caprica pilot. I went with extreme prejudice and was prepared to be totally unimpressed. Watching the first fifteen minutes is a little painful, however, once you get past them the series opens up, firing on all cylinders and it is beautiful -- and I truly mean, beautiful. In fact, when looking back on it, those first fifteen minutes are crucial to establishing the decadent world this story is set in. This is a must-see for any BSG fan and for anyone interested in watching something other than the typical ""Law & Order"" procedural drama or the ridiculously dull ""Lost."" Ronald D. Moore, David Eick, and Remi Aubuchon (former 24 scribe -- from the days when 24 used to rock my socks off) deliver a high-quality product that matches (and in some areas) surpasses its sister show, BSG.

For those looking for lots of 'splosions (admittedly I was at first) you will be sadly disappointed. For those truly interested in the birth of the Cylons, you will be very pleased. This story contained one of the greatest Cylon characters in years. Set in the backdrop of rising tensions between the Twelve Colonies (particularly Caprica and Tauron), it appears as though the Cylons are being developed by the Caprican government to fight their Colonial enemies (which the writers have said they will explore this Inter-Colonial War story in Caprica Season One), the Adamas and Greystones are trying to lead their lives as peacefully as possible. However, a terrorist attack by religious fundamentalists breaks the routine of their lives.

Joseph Adama attempts to keep his remaining family together (his bitchy mother-in-law and young William Adama) all the meanwhile trying to distance himself from his sordid past (he's a mob lawyer). Meanwhile, Daniel Greystone (BSGverse's Bill Gates/Steve Jobs) becomes obsessed with bringing his daughter back to life in the form of a Cylon, enlisting fellow mourner, Joseph Adama, in his quest and convincing Joseph to use his mob connections to engage in Corporate Espionage to acquire a necessary component to complete his ""masterpiece.""

Over the course of this story several familiar themes from BSG (i.e. what is it to be human) as well as several moral issues are played out. The intense politics that defined BSG are brought over to Caprica and intensified. The military elements are replaced by more scientific/business elements while the religious themes remain primarily the same and, indeed, are amplified. In many ways the BSG series (that includes Caprica) seems to be more about Man's relationship with God than anything else.

While watching this (it's too good to be called a simple TV series) feature film that happens to be on television, I could not help but feel (particularly when watching Joseph Adama's interactions with the Tauron Mob)that I was watching Bladerunner meets the Godfather set in the BSGverse. It was beautiful. It could just be me, but Joe Adama reminds me of Michael Corleone from The Godfather (before he decided to engage in his first hit).

If SyFy gives this series more than it's greenlit first season, my faith in studio executives will be renewed. Especially considering RDM has already stated that, if Caprica gets its full intended run, he very much wants to ""explore"" the possibilities of telling another story about young Adama fighting in the First Cylon War which, will be frakking epic. I could go on, but I won't. This film was just frakking amazing. However, I must caution parents that the DVD is the director's cut and it is somewhat explicit in the first fifteen minutes. Other than that, this show doesn't disappoint in the slightest and I am looking forward to the next great chapter in what is truly the greatest science fiction saga put to film to date.

Thank you.",1242864000,,4317,4.947586206896552

3779358,1,B001RTCP1U,"When a friend purchased the BSG pilot movie for me and insisted I watched it because it was ""great"" I procrastinated.  A child of the 70's I remember the original series, and thought it was basically Love Boat in space. The Ovions were cool, and the robot dog (Moffat?  Moppat?  Muppet?) was cool, but other than that I found it cheesy and for the most part uninteresting.

So when I finally got around to watching that pilot movie for the new BSG -- I was blown away -- and within minutes.  It was clearly a quality product right out of the box, good writing, good acting -- great effects.  I went on to follow the series faithfully -- and the series as a whole was fantastic.  Sure, there were some pretty lame ""filler"" episodes, but all in all it was a monumental sci-fi series.

Caprica did not inspire the same sort of enthusiasm.  To be honest, I thought it was fairly terrible, but I'm willing to withhold condemnation.  My issues so far revolve around the cast which seems spotty; Morales is a perfect choice for the serior Adama, and Stoltz, too, seems appropriately cast.  However, I honestly couldn't identify with anyone else.  In fact, I found the teenage characters brutally annoying.

Without giving away spoilers -- the writing did not engage me until the second half of the movie.  Even then, I sort of felt like hanging on simply for the sake of being able to say I watched the whole thing.  There's also some sexual overtones sprinkled throughout which I'm sure were supposed to be provocative, but I felt were in poor taste. I'm not referring to the club scenes of writhing and dry humping either.  I'm referring more to scenes with the head-mistress.  It was sort of like 90210 in space, the very special ""Just Say No"" episode.  When writers throw crappy and obvious hints like that at their audience, it seems more that they're pandering to kids and shut-ins who's only experience with alternative relationships is what they watch on Jerry Springer.

Anyway, for me, the writing seemed reminiscent of that lesbian tie-in that they did in BSG mid-season, Razor.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Battlestar-Galactica-Razor-Unrated-Extended-Edition/dp/B000V5IP6K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Battlestar Galactica - Razor (Unrated Extended Edition)</a>&nbsp;That episode left me wondering why the lesbian relationship was integral?  To show Cain had softer, human side? Or to explain why she was so ""tough"".  From what I recall, that Commander was not a completely unlikeable character, sure -- she was tough as nails and very much by-the-books but those were/are respectable qualities.  However, she was an obstacle that needed to be eliminated, and in the process her sexual identity was dumped on the table, she was reduced to a ""woman-spurned"" and then axed. Let me quickly say that I ""get"" that the culture of BSG seemed to have a more open sexual identity, and that the show lacked the bias that real society actually has -- but for a show that has paralleled so many issues and handled them all with grace -- some things just seem thrown out there for the heck of it.  For ratings.  For titillation. For whatever reason, but this deliberate flirtation with open sexuality sometimes seems so cheaply done to me.  I say this not as a prude, but as someone who appreciates a connection between ""sexy"" and ""smart"".

But that's just one aspect, other fans might recall that Razor was a bit of a mish-mash.  Caprica, too, is a little neither-here-nor-there as the writers struggle to make it more complicated than a future Frankenstein story.

So, while I did not care for ""Caprica"" at all -- I'm willing to have some faith and stick around for a couple of episodes.  While I found this movie to be a poor teaser for the series -- it may take a few episodes to round out the plot and endear viewers to the characters.",1242604800,29,3876,4.92

3779361,4,B001RTCP1U,"""Battlestar Galactica"" has barely ended, and already a spinoff series is being trotted out by the Sci Fi (or Sy Fy as they now call themselves) Channel.

Fortunately ""Caprica"" (a pilot to the forthcoming spinoff) is no quick cash-in on its parent series' success. Okay, the fate of humanity doesn't yet hang in the balance, and there are no space battles at all -- but it maintains the same suspense, intelligence and philosophical musings as ""Battlestar Galactica"" had, even as it shows how Adama and the Cylons came to be.

A pair of secretly monotheistic teens -- Zoe Graystone (Alessandra Toreson) and her boyfriend Ben -- are running away from Caprica to escape the decadent polytheistic culture. But then Ben turns out to be a suicide bomber, and destroys the lev train.

Two men are left to deal with their grief in the aftermath -- prominent cybernetic inventor Daniel (Eric Stoltz), and mob-connected Tauron lawyer Joseph Adams (Esai Morales), who lost his wife and daughter in the explosion. As the Caprican government starts ruthlessly hunting for monotheists, the two men bond. But then Daniel finds that Zoe is not completely gone -- in an orgiastic virtual rave, she left behind a virtual ""echo"" that has all her memories, feelings, and even experienced her death.

Believing that the avatar can bring Zoe back from the dead, Daniel is determined to somehow put her avatar in a robotic body -- and offers the same to Adams. At first Adams is desperate enough to agree, even to sacrificing his principles to get a vital piece of machinery for Daniel. But their ethics drive the two men in opposite directions, as Daniel's obsession drives him to spawn something terrible...

It's pretty obvious that ""Caprica"" is meant as the pilot of a TV show, because there are too many plot threads (the monotheists, Lacey's involvement, the Adama family's changes) left floating in the air with no resolution. Not to mention that final scene, which will leave you shrieking, ""What next? What next? What's gonna happen next?""

That said, it has the promise of being a truly brilliant piece of work -- the writers deftly interweave topics of racism, religious oppression and misguidance, sorrow, and the existence of the soul (do our memories alone define us, or do we have something more?). And they spin up a totally believable world in Caprica, which is a wee bit more advanced than our world but essentially the same, with rebellious teens, Mafia-esque mobs, smooth downtown buildings and a seething undercurrent of sex'n'blood decadence.

The first half of ""Caprica"" is a bit slow, especially since it mainly focuses on how rotten Daniel and Joseph feel. But once Daniel discovers virtual-Zoe, the story blossoms into a beautifully tense tango between the two men, full of quietly poetic dialogue (""Sometimes faith can be a victim of chance"") and some eerie horrific moments (Joseph's reunion with his dead ""daughter""). The last ten minutes truly links ""Caprica"" to ""Battlestar Galactica.""

Both Stoltz and Morales do brilliant jobs here. Neither Daniel nor Joseph is portrayed as a bad guy, but one of them allows his obsessions to carry him into dangerous territory, while the other has lines that he's determined not to cross. Torresani is also quite good as a fierce young woman who wants to change the world, and her digital avatar, and Polly Walker gives a solid if brief performance as a serene young teacher with a secret.

""Caprica"" is a solid start to the proposed spinoff series, although the wide-open ending keeps it from quite working on its own. Still, a little something to tide people over until the series really gets going.",1242518400,,3646,4.944444444444445

But even so, the creative team has found a way to make it depressing from the outset. A little humor would have helped to make this a little more palatable.

I was turned off by the anti-religious tone. All ""monotheists"" are lumped together and set apart as extremists or terrorists.

I also thought that the acting was a little wooden. For such a serious show the cast seemed to have difficulty expressing a wide range of emotions. In particular I expected better from Eric Stoltz. But maybe the cast was depressed by the script.

Esai Morales is perfectly cast as Joseph Adama, and already the background story is being told of why Bill Adama was the man that he was on BSG.

Eric Stolz is perfect in his portrayal of the desperate, grief-stricken millionaire Daniel Greystone.

3779403,4,B001RTCP1U,"I'm a fan of the original Battlestar Galactica and the new series as well, and was eager to view this. Though the tone is different, the storyline is compelling. In Battlestar, humans are faced by the prospect of decimation because of advanced technology, and in Caprica, which is set about 58 years prior to the story in Battlestar, the conundrum is rather different - dealing with a society that is on the cusp of groundbreaking technology with the potential to change the face of humanity, and the initial forays into creating artifical life.

The storyline here in ""Caprica"" focuses on two families, the Graystones and the Adamas.  Eric Stoltz plays Daniel Graystone, a computer expert who is working on robotic soldiers for military use. Zoe [Alessandra Toreson] plays the brilliant teen daughter with a penchant for indulging [via a holoband] in virtual club activities, and who finds it hard to connect with her busy parents. A tragic event causes Zoe to die which eventually leads to Daniel coming into contact with Joseph Adama [Esai Morales] who himself lost his wife and daughter in the tragedy, and is left with a son William whom he finds difficult to connect with.

There is not much action in this feature,the focus being more on the development of characters and events and this perhaps has to do with the fact this is a pilot episode of an anticipated series for the Sci-Fi channel [premiering in 2010?].This particular pilot episode is concerned with the crucial question [that later comes to have a serious bearing on the Battlestar series] of artificial intelligence, and the ethics surrounding artificial life [is it ever justified?] and of man playing God.

3779424,2,B001RTCP1U,As you probably can tell from my title I have some issues with this initial offering from Amazon.  1. Did someone really consciously believe that preview was enough to entice someone into buying this...seriously. How about some QC here...I mean the credits and the blur of a intro scene. I don't think so.  2. So I have to pay $14.99 for a pilot of Caprica.  Don't get me wrong I would like to see this but not at that price. I seriously doubt that there will be many casual takers willing to purchase this. Obviously this price plays on the fans out there starving for more BSG. Amazon will be giving this away as soon as this airs and especially if this isn't well received. 3. I can't rent(VOD) this at a lower price??? Like 3.99! Why only the option to purchase? I mean this isn't a Summer blockbuster movie. It's a freaking pilot. I guess I'll wait until this title que's up in my Blockbuster account and watch it through my normal subscription price which is 19.99 a month. You do the math.,1241136000,7,996,4.4021739130434785
3779425,5,B001RTCP1U,"""Caprica,"" the prequel series to the now-departed ""Battlestar Galactica"" opus, begins with this fine 90-minute pilot episode, in which numerous vivid, involving characters are introduced, the gritty social politics of the twelve colonies of Kobol begin to be fleshed out, and the Cylon race is born.

As a standalone show, without the benefit of four stunning seasons of BSG, I'm not sure how well this pilot would hold up, but as part of the Galactica mythos, it's utterly delicious and delightful. As is their wont, the writers and producers introduce a flurry of fantastic concepts, and we see at least four different ways the original Cylon codes could have been corrupted. And when that first Toaster starts walking and talking... and shooting...  Well, I'm in, baby! I enjoyed this episode immensely and can't wait to see where they go from here.

3779426,4,B001RTCP1U,"Tensions are rising between the Twelve Colonies. The poorer planets are feeling oppressed and exploited by the richer, whilst the more powerful worlds are arrogant and decadent. On Caprica, richest and most powerful of the twelve worlds, people live increasingly empty lives. A new technological innovation, the holoband, has led to the creation of stunningly convincing artificial worlds or 'V-clubs' where young people can murder and torture one another for pleasure. Sickened by the collapse in morals around them, a small group of people have been swayed by the argument that there is one all-powerful, all-knowing god who can save them if they chose to be saved. But some the followers of the One God believe more direct action is needed, and one troubled young man proves his faith by stepping onto a packed commuter train laden with explosives.

In the aftermath of the disaster, two men are brought together by shared grief: computer programmer and entrepreneur Daniel Graystone and lawyer Joseph Adams. Both of them lost a daughter on the train, Zoe and Tamara, and both are searching for answers. Daniel soon learns that his daughter may not have just been an innocent bystander and, buried in the depths of the V-club, Zoe hid a programme that may provide him with the breakthrough he needs in the creation of a new military robot for the Caprican government: the Cybernetic Lifeform Node. For Joseph, whose brother is a high-ranking member of the Tauron crime syndicate, his life becomes more dangerous and complex as he tries to provide a living for his son, William, and find a way to cope with his own sense of loss.

Caprica is a prequel series to Battlestar Galactica, beginning fifty-eight years before the Fall of the Twelve Colonies and about six years before the beginning of the First Cylon War. Absolutely no knowledge of BSG is required to watch this show. Whilst BSG was a space opera, Caprica is resolutely a planet-bound drama, focusing on the characters, the politics, the crime syndicates and scientists of their world. There isn't a single space shot in the whole pilot movie, not even an establishing shot of Caprica, which seems to be a declaration that this show is going to try to do something different.

Yet it shares more similarities with the progenitor show than just a shared background. It's similarly ruthless and hard-edged. The pilot does not shy away from scenes of violence. In fact, the opening sequence in the V-club is far more explicit in violence and nudity than anything seen on BSG. The questions raised in BSG about artificial sentience and what constitutes a person or a soul are explored in even greater depth in this opening episode, and it's fascinating to see Caprica as technically more advanced than it is later on. Those claiming this show isn't science fiction simply because it focuses more on an AI singularity than on space battles are seriously in error. This show has the potential to be a far more hardcore SF show than BSG itself.

The characters chosen to tell this story work very well. Eric Stoltz plays Daniel Graystone as a driven man whose desire to learn, to innovate and to always come out on top is beginning to compromise his morals, and this character development is complicated by the death of his daughter and the manner in which he deals with his grief. Esai Morales brings significant gravitas to his role as Joseph Adams, and you could easily imagine him being related to Edward James Olmos (and yes, there's a reason why the surname gets changed). The interplay between these two very different men is interesting to watch and the scenes with the two actors are impressively handled.

The rest of the cast likewise impresses. Polly Walker, recently seen as Atia in Rome, takes on the role of Sister Clarice Willow, the head of the school where the cult of the One God has taken root. She has only a few scenes but channels an impressive amount of intensity into a very different role. Alessandra Toressani as Zoe Graystone is a bit more variable, but most pulls off a very tricky and demanding role, rising above the simple 'troubled teen' archetype to take the character into a somewhat more disturbing direction. Paula Malcomson as Amanda Graystone also gives a remarkably good performance as the mother who has to cope with the loss of her daughter.

Special effects-wise, Caprica obviously doesn't have tons of space shots like BSG, but if anything it has a harder job, transforming downtown Vancouver into Caprica City without it standing out to the viewer. There's a couple of impressive sequences (the destruction of the train, most notably), but mostly their work is confined to establishing shots which, curiously, aren't as impressive as the stunning shot of Caprica City in the BSG finale (which I'd assumed was test-run for Caprica). Bear McCreary is also on board for the music and his work is initially more muted than BSG, though BSG fans will take great delight at spotting a couple of themes from the parent show that are deployed at strategic moments.

Caprica's pilot episode does have one significant problem: it feels like we cover about 50% of the plot needed to get us to the show's end-point (presumably the start of the war) in just the pilot by itself. I'm not sure if there's enough plot strands to fill a single 20-episode season, let alone a multi-year ongoing series, and this raises the prospect of dreaded filler episodes (and BSG showed that this team are particularly inept at handling filler). But, given that the pilot has an excellent cast, solid writing, a compelling and dark storyline and an atmosphere not quite like anything I've seen before in SFTV, I'm more than willing to give them a chance to show what they can do.

Caprica's pilot (****) is available on DVD now in the United States. The pilot will air on the Sci-Fi Channel in the United States and on Sky One in the UK and Ireland in early 2010, followed by the rest of the first season.",1240876800,12,5975,4.822439024390244

3779429,4,B001RTCP1U,"When I first heard the Sci Fi Channel (or as it's soon to be called:  Syfy) was going to make a prequel series to Battlestar Galactica I was somewhat hesitant.  Not because I was one of those science fiction snobs who thinks the genre can only be about space battles, aliens, and a certain startship that shall remain nameless. No, I was hesitant because I knew the network's history of meddling.  The disaster that was season three of BSG can be squarely placed on the shoulders of the network suits.  The idea of bringing the history of the colonies to life has the potential to be interesting and thought provoking television.  After viewing the finished product recently released on DVD I have to say they've succeeded in many ways.

The story of Caprica takes place ""58 years before the fall"" of the colonies.  At the heart of the story are two families: the Graystones, a wealthy family whose patriarch founded a technology company (a company that inadvertently leads to the downfall of all mankind); and the Adamas, a less-than-wealthy family from the world of Tauron.  Joseph Adama, father of the future Admiral Adama (now only an eleven-year-old boy) is attempting to hide his family's ties to Tauron by changing their name to Adams.  Both of these families are drawn together by tragedy when Graystone's daughter, Zoe, is killed in a terrorist attack by a monotheistic group along with Joseph Adama's wife and daughter.

By accident, Graystone discovers that his daughter created a fully functional avatar in a virtual world where she and her friends, along with the youth of Caprica, go to escape their mundane world.  Using his daughter's work and a piece of stolen technology, Graystone downloads Zoe into a robotic form his company is working on for the Defense Ministry.  This scene alone is one of the most eerie of the entire episode.  As you watch Zoe attempt to get comfortable with her new metal body and see the look on Daniel Graystone's face as he watches, it's like seeing a father witnessing the birth of his child.  Very Frankenstein-esque.

Caprica is filled with the some intriguing ideas and concepts.  Of course, you have the usual BSG-speak.  ""Frak"" is used often, you have the gods, and the twelve colonies named for astrological signs. What will make Caprica stand out is its ability to flesh out many of the concepts that we just took at face value with the parent series.  In this pilot alone were learn more about the religion and prejudices of the colonies than we ever did in Battlestar Galactica, but it wasn't appropriate for BSG to tackle those topics.  Caprica is designed to do just that.

One of the more intriguing concepts I hope Caprica will tackle are the people of Tauron.  Like any large society, the people of Caprica have their prejudices and there seems to be a strong prejudice against the people of Tauron, or ""dirt eaters"" as some call them.  From what we can glean from the pilot, the people of Tauron are peasants who toil at hard labor and are looked down upon by the rest of the colonies.  Out of this servitude an organized crime group has formed; a group with close ties to the Adama clan. From what we see in this pilot episode, the people of Tauron look similar to South American Indian cultures such as the Mayans or Aztecs in how their presented. It will be interesting to see how this is developed.

This pilot has some fun ""ah ha!"" moments.  One of the more interesting ""ah ha!"" moments comes when we learn just how the Cylons developed their belief in the One True God. That revelation alone makes everything coming in 58 years even more understandable. It's moments like this along with scenes showing the development of the Cybernetic Lifeform Node, or Cylon, that will make Caprica an intriguing series to watch.  It's these moments that allow me to forgive the series for starting out a little slow.  Hopefully, Caprica can find a fan base that will make it worthwhile for Syfy to keep it on the air for a few years.",1240704000,39,3989,4.693965517241379
3779430,5,B001RTCP1U,"The storyline keeps plugging on, to my utter delight!

This ""prequel"" to BSG is an odd item, this. We hear familiar names in a somewhat familiar place, but Caprica is it's own wonderful (and troubled) little ""world"" that we find ourselves immersed in from start to finish.

I wasn't quite sure that Eric Stoltz or Esai Morales could cut the mustard, because I've seen them in real stinkers in the past-but they acquit themselves well! William B. Davis (CSM, or the Cigarette Smoking Man in ""The X-Files"") appears as a nasty political type, good as ever. As in BSG, there are a whole gangload of relative unknowns, but their presence just makes the show that much better.

 The concepts shown in ""Caprica"" look to be just everyday kinds of things, and the lack of concern at these intrusions into their everyday lives are unsettlingly convincing, as we treat OUR everyday objects in much the same way. This also sets the stage for what is to come. No, we don't see flying cars or anything else that would predispose anyone from thinking that this is anything but a dramatic series, and we are so close to the level of robotics in the series now, that it all seems VERY relevant. The ideals and attitudes shown are absolutely paralleled by our own society! All the strengths and weaknesses we exibit as a people are there. It is a spooky thing to see a representation of our present society on screen, oblivious to the civilization-altering plans that they themselves set in motion.

The basic story takes place 50+ years BEFORE BSG, BEFORE the fall, BEFORE the rise of the Cylons. Caprican society has become the epitome of hedonism, graft and corruption (is any of this sounding familiar?). It is how each character's decisions shape the world around them, ultimately leading to the causes that led to The Fall, and ultimately to the situation that spawned BSG to begin with. THIS is where I hoped the original series would have gone. It's all o.k. though, because we're here!

The one thing I didn't have any trouble noticing was the richness of the sets and locations! I had to watch certain segments over, so as not to miss anything, there was sooo much going on in each scene! Though some will be very critical of the SFX in ""Caprica"", I found them to be more than adequate to convey the emotionalism and action required of their respective scenes.

While we do not have cybernetic devices or Holobands (or flying cars, for that matter) these things are just a matter of time. I can only hope WE would exibit more restraint and foresight in the face of these devices than the Capricans did.

 There are many here who have already given a blow-by-blow rundown of this film, and I won't add to it. Suffice to say that ""Caprica"" is a TV series that could surpass BSG if what is seen in this film is what we will be treated to each week on whatever channel it is shown. Many disliked the spit and patch job seen in the last episode of BSG, and I have to say their concerns are valid. This is evident of a storyline that needed resolution in a hurry, because the story had no ending! Hopefully, ""Caprica"" has a complete storyline in place, so the ""S&P"" thing is a non-issue.

I just wish I didn't have to wait til' 2010!!

After going through the film one more time with the commentary track, I find there is ALOT of information that Ron Moore and David Eick are giving up about the series. There is also a bit on how it ties in with BSG, along with much info for budding Writers, directors and producers to benefit from. I don't normally do commentary tracks, but I had to hear what RDM and DE had to say about a series that I can't wait to see!",1240704000,2,3739,4.571001494768311
3779431,3,B001RTCP1U,"After spending 4 seasons with the great cast of BSG anchored by heavyweights James Olmos and Mary McDonnell I just couldn't get into Caprica.  It's just a different show altogether.  It feels like a soap opera dominated by teen emo angst.  SPOILERS AHEAD!

Usually teenagers who are geniuses at writing code spend all their time on the computer and have little time for social life but the exceptional teenage gal here can write serious software, have the usual personal teen angst and pal around with terrorist friends.  Everybody is so serious and sad on the show and you are not really sure why.

There is no Kara Thrace to lighten things up (or light the house on fire) and there is no Gaius Baltar to add needed comic relief to the dark story and there is no William Adama to lift the dramatic content of the show from standard tv to feature film quality.

I'm currently watching The Terminator Chronicles and their story for developing Skynet is much more compelling than the development of the Cylons and that show too is also using a ""family"" motif.",1240704000,5,1057,4.650537634408602
3779432,5,B001RTCP1U,"""Caprica"" is the pilot episode of the ""Battlestar Galactica"" prequel series that will air on Sci-Fi next year. I was extremely impressed by the show, and must admit that it's much better than I thought it would be. The story is set on Caprica almost 60 years before the fall. The show revolves around two familles, the Greystones and the Adams/Adamas. A suicide train bombing tragically takes the life of 16-year-old Zoe Greystone, along with Joseph Adams' (Esai Morales) wife and teenage daughter. After the terrorist attack, evidence surfaces that indicates Zoe may have been a member of a religious extremist group responsible for the bombing. Meanwhile, Daniel Greystone (Eric Stoltz) discovers that his deceased daughter was a computer genius like himself. Zoe managed to create a carbon copy of herself that lives in a virtual world, and Daniel is intent on downloading his daughter and figuring out a way for her to live with him and his wife on Caprica.

This is an intriguing show that already has managed to fill in a lot of holes that were never fully explained in ""Battlestar Galactica."" It's a well-acted program with a solid cast, and the plot is deeply intriguing. Even though we all know how the development of the cylons will eventually unfold, I have a feeling that this show is going to satisfy a lot of ""Battlestar Galactica"" fans, myself included.

3779454,5,B001RTCP1U,"Like most people who will be trying this series out, I am coming to it from BATTLESTAR GALACTICA.  The latter was one of the most brilliantly original shows in the history of television and as topical as any show in memory, addressing real world issues by focusing on one that is not our own.  CAPRICA, set over fifty years before the events of BSG, promises both to be very similar and very, very different from the original.  Those who complained about the show devolving into BATTLESOAP GALACTICA will hate this.  But those of us who actually preferred the ideas and issues at the heart of BSG will find this pure gold.  There is likely to be very little fighting and few or no spaceships.  It will, in fact, be pretty clearly be a character driven drama, the only difference from a show like FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS being that it is set on a distant planet.  But like BSG, there will be no aliens.

Though there are some stark differences from BSG, there will also be a lot of continuities.  The pilot has some of BSG's main concerns, such as religion and the idea of what it means to be a person.  And just as there was a conflict between differing religious beliefs on BSG with the polytheistic humans and the monotheistic Cylons.  There will also be a huge overlap in creative staff.  Though the script was co-authored by BSG head guru Ronald D. Moore, it will be run by BSG (and BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER) writer Jane Espenson.  And Bear McCreary, who provided the great, great music for BSG (as well as TERMINATOR: THE SARAH CONNOR CHRONICLES), is performing the same duties on CAPRICA.  And of course, since CAPRICA is very much about the lead up to the events in BSG, including the creation of the Cylons, there is a huge overlap in story.

The first scene of the series is shocking, as we see the inside of a virtual nightclub and it serves almost as a mission statement.  It was a crazier, more insane world than anything we ever saw in BSG.  They also don't mind departing from BSG in other ways.  BSG was almost aggressively nontechnological, which is bizarre for a show set on a spaceship.  But here on CAPRICA are slick looking robots (that look very much like Eve from WALL*E) and computer interfaces that look wildly futuristic.  CAPRICA has paper with the corners cut off like BSG, but it nonetheless has very much its own style.

One thing I found interesting is that they departed for the most part from the camera style of BSG.  That show had an almost documentary style, working extensively with handheld cameras.  I had anticipated a similar look on CAPRICA in part because Jeffrey Reiner was hired to direct.  Most of his work of late has been on the great NBC drama FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS, which is shot entirely with handheld video cameras.  But the change in camera style really works for this show and should give it a very different feel.  By the way, there is a really significant overlap between BSG/CAPRICA and FNL.  Ron Moore had two pilots under development at the same time, this one and a pilot for FOX entitled VIRTUALITY.  The later was directed by Peter Berg, who was the creator of both the FNL movie and TV series.

I was really impressed with the cast.  Several of the members are familiar, like Eric Stoltz and he looks like he is going to stand out on this series.  Esai Morales is also creepy as Joseph Adama.  I can't imagine anyone giving you the sensation of being Bill Adama's father than he did in this pilot.  Some of the other performers you don't get a strong sense of from the pilot, like Paula Malcomson (perhaps best known from DEADWOOD) as Amanda Graystone and Polly Walker (most recently from ROME) as Sister Clarice Willow.  You know that they will be important in the series, but there roles in the pilot were somewhat in the background.  I enjoyed seeing Magda Apanowicz (who most will know from KYLE XY, in which she played Josh Trager's girlfriend) in it as Zoe Graystone's friend Lacy Rand.  But if there is an outstanding performance in the pilot, it is by Allessandra Toreson as Zoe Graystone.  This was one of the most important roles on the show and she pulled it off wonderfully.  As Zoe and Zoe's avatar, she is clearly the predecessor of all future ""skin job"" Cylons.

The pilot has left me very, very excited about the series, which is scheduled to start sometime in the winter of 2010.  It is definitely going to be very different from BSG, but it is going to resemble it both in terms of quality and boldness.

One last note.  In the film we often see characters put on virtual glasses.  So I was quite surprised when I got my DVD and saw an advertisement for personal video glasses that look not dissimilar to the ones on the show.  From BSG we actually know that the events of CAPRICA are not at all in the future (not to be too spoilerish for anyone who hasn't seen BSG), but seeing these glasses, the world suddenly felt much more like the present.",1240617600,5,4920,4.516968325791855
3779455,5,B001RTCP1U,"Before watching this show i was a little hesitant to give it any credit as a legitimate show, because spinoffs never really seem to be as good as the original. However, after watching Caprica,i was blown away. I am a big Battlestar Galactica fan,but even for those who may not know much about Battlestar Galactica,it is still a very well thought out story of the origins of the previous series. There are some very interesting philisophical questions proposed in this show that really makes you think deeply about what it means to be human, and whether death is really the end of life. This movie is also a little grittier than the Battlestar series since theres more nudity and violence present,but it does not detract from the engaging story line. I am not sure if this show will be successful as an entire series, since alot of the major plotlines of the overall story are presented,but this movie is phenominal on its own. It's a definite must for any Battlestar Galactica fan, or those who like science fiction or for those who like to think about a deeper understanding of what it means to be human.",1240617600,,1105,4.642857142857143

But after the first 10 mins of Caprica, I was starting to wonder if the juices of creativity were all used up. Here we have a Matrix-esque VR Club and a couple of stupid teens talking about changing everything. Sounds like a ""Plan"". Anyways, once we get to the first bang of the plot, things start to head in the right direction. After the first 30 mins have passed (and the religous indoctrination is out of the way), several of the plot threads that will no doubt be present in the series start evolving. Loss of Loved Ones, Terrorism, Religion, Persecution, Racism, Politics, Scientific and Moral Quandaries, Father/Son Relationships, The Mob, and more are all laid out before us in about 90 mins! Truly amazing and entertaining with a jaw dropping ending that will have you salivating for the series to begin. All praise Ron Moore, for he is the one true God!",1240617600,3,984,4.5027932960893855
3779457,4,B001RTCP1U,"Welcome to ""Caprica"", the pilot for the BSG spinoff that will start airing next year. For reasons unclear to me, the soon-to-be renamed SyFy Channel has chosen to release this episode on DVD well before the show airs. I don't get why they're doing this, but whatever.

The show takes place 58 years before BSG and tells the story of Caprica and the other colonies before the Cylons destroyed everything. It primarily centers around Daniel Greystone, who is busily inventing Cylons, and a lawyer named Joseph Adama, who, unlike what his father said about him in BSG, turns out to be basically a bought mob lawyer and not a great civil rights attorney. I actually appreciated that, since we all know kids to idolize their parents. The idea that Bill Adama's father might've not been what his son remembered made perfect sense.

The plot of the pilot centers around Greystone and Adama's daughters, who are both killed in a terrorist attack staged by a guy entirely too attractive to off himself that way. The terrorists are religious zealots who believe in monotheism and are willing to kill for it.

Greystone is shattered by his daughter's death, but then he finds out she's made a computer version of herself that has sentience. If only there was some way to put that into the cyborg bodies he's developing...

This episode suffers somewhat in comparison to BSG. It isn't bad by any means, but it's not nearly as good, especially when you compare pilot episodes. BSG's pilot was much more stand-alone then this and had a stronger overall story-line. The characters were also more interesting.

Still and all, what there is here shows some real potential, and I am looking forward to watching the series when it airs (though they will have to hack up this pilot quite a bit, given the large number of bare-breasted women you see in it. Gods forbid people should see women topless! Anarchy!). And, what the heck, at least it's something better than most of the dreck the SyFy Channel airs.",1240531200,,1988,4.767441860465116

Non-Battlestar fans should find this show very compelling and will suck you into the plot and characters.  For the BSG fans, seeing the beginning of how humanity opened up pandora's box and the birth of the first cylon is pretty amazing.  Congrats to Ron Moore & David Eick for creating another excellent ensemble and the framework of a compelling story that will no doubt be another thrill ride.  I should caution anyone buying this for their teen son or daughter, there is some pretty graphic violence and sexuality in the opening 5 minutes.  A great story and allegory on life on this planet.",1240531200,,746,4.529850746268656
3779459,5,B001RTCP1U,I found this very enjoyable.  I can't wait for the series to start.  The feel of the show is similar to the flashback caprica scenes in BSG.  Highly recommended!,1240444800,,161,4.482758620689655
3779460,5,B001RTCP1U,"BSG was essentially modern-day Americans in space, more of a metaphor than an attempt to create an alien civilization. The new series remains very faithful to that, and posits what the United States could look like with another 30-40 years of technological advancement. It is completely our culture, but with the incredible attention to detail to remind you constantly that you're on another planet, which is in a group of planets that talk to each other. The other planets in the 12 Colonies are treated as other countries, and are talked about and alluded to in this pilot, but not yet seen.

The environment of the show is one of its biggest stars, certainly. But the show is also exquisitely cast, with characters that truly inhabit this other world, and are in their unique position in history and in their economy to be the direct stakeholders in the emergence of cybernetic life. And because this culture is so much closer to our own on a time scale, there is so much more room for social commentary and imagination of where our technology will be in the very near future, and the questions we will have to answer about AI.

And fans of BSG will be pleased to know that the show has the sheer power that you have come to expect from a show in the BSG universe.  The only thing you will regret is that you have to wait a year for the actual series. Frickin' Sci-Fi Syfy.",1240444800,4,1376,4.518072289156627
3779461,5,B001RTCP1U,"I am a huge fan of the Sci-fi Channel's BATTLESTAR GALACTICA series.  With each season, my admiration for this television grew even more.  You can imagine how excited I was when I learned of the planned prequel, CAPRICA.

As the tale unfolds, we learn more about the multi-deity religious beliefs predominantly held by the people of Caprica as well as the divergent beliefs an underground minority hold regarding a singular god.  More importantly, we begin to understand how this theological conflict plays a part in the birth of the Cylons.

Caprica follows the lives of the Graystones and the Adamas, two extremely different families brought together in very unexpected ways through tragedy.  Through this connection, the genesis of the Centurions is spawned, as well as the evolution of a technology with the potential of great danger to the human race.

In this world, no one is who they seem to be on the surface.  Tendrils of intrigue and dangerous secrets lurk in every dark corner.  Humanity's never-ending struggle with right and wrong, with science versus religion is never more prominent than in the beginning to this epic story.

This movie is just a small part of what promises to be a tale as riveting as BATTLESTAR GALACTICA was.  Viewers are made to wonder what price mankind is willing to pay for the ultimate technology.  Will we risk our very souls?  CAPRICA movie is definitely an auspicious beginning to the upcoming CAPRICA television series expected to launch in the year 2010.  I know I will be waiting on the edge of my seat for more in this fascinating story.",1240358400,3,1585,4.865671641791045
3779462,5,B001RTCP1U,"I was extremely skeptical when I heard about the proposed prequel to the greatest television science fiction saga of this generation. Attempting to cash in on the success of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Battlestar-Galactica/dp/B0026RHR6K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Battlestar Galactica</a>&nbsp;so soon after the series ended seemed like a losing proposition doomed to mar an amazing franchise.  Well, consider those fears alleviated.  The first taste of ""Caprica"" is absolutely amazing.  With no space battles and the themes of humanity's destruction and survival at the hands of their own creation already done to death, I feared for a lack of compelling material to further immerse me in the pre-genocide human society of the twelve worlds.  All politics and no spaceships makes science fiction a dull genre.  But what BSG did for the space opera, ""Caprica"" is set to do for cyberpunk.  If BSG was&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Trek/dp/B000RZIGVS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Trek</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Babylon-5/dp/B0001M3MXY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Babylon 5</a>, ""Caprica"" is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ghost-in-the-Shell/dp/6304493681/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ghost in the Shell</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Matrix/dp/B0002Y69NG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Matrix</a>.  I am beyond impressed.

The story unfolds as a terrorist attack by a youth seeking to draw attention to his monotheistic cause (most worship the old Greek gods).  The result tears two families apart and in half a century's time will lead to the destruction of human society.  But before that there is one hell of a story to be told.  The themes on the social commentary buffet so far includes a much more bold dialogue on religion then even BSG gave us, a different angle on the definition of human as we know it, a frank look at a racist society, and an exploration of the logical extremes of future virtual existence.  This is to say that once the internet and virtual reality become compatible, one hell of a can of worms will be opened.

Since this series premiere comes to us in movie form, the gods have shined upon us.  As far as it's predecessor pushed the sexual envelope for a tv show, ""Caprica"" has easily bested it here.  I don't know how they are going to cut this for television. There is abundant nudity, group sex, and some serious girl-girl going on in this film.  Virtual human sacrifice in underground virtual hacker clubs speaks volumes about the social issues to be confronted and is damned disturbing.  There is one violent death featuring a but of arterial spray as well.  Still think science fiction is for kids?  The idea of creating a virtual copy of yourself by hacking the information in your own brain and uploading it to a digital avatar, thereby achieving a brand of immortality is brilliant and the Frankenstein complex that leads a father who lost his daughter to cross lines that should never be crossed is stroke of absolute genius.

Familiarity with it's parent show will certainly deepen your appreciation of ""Caprica"", but it is not at all necessary.  This is great science fiction, period.  Now's your chance to get on board with what promises to be the best series in coming years. Don't miss it. Battlestar maniacs will get to see one of that show's enduring heroes in his formative years and witness the birth of the first Cylon in a heart-rending accident.  But at it's heart this show -like Galactica- is about two things: massive universal concepts of humanity, and intimate relationships with the characters who inhabit this work of fiction.  One cannot improve on that formula.  There is no television show, no movie, nothing in entertainment that I am currently looking forward to more then this. If you are a fan of adult science fiction in any way, then this is what you need to be watching.  And that goes double for BSG fans.",1240358400,262,4138,5.764802631578948

3779480,5,B001RTCP1U,"Wow.  There was more skin shown in this pilot movie than in all five seasons of BSG. All young nubile naked bodies in a free for all virtual night club of orgies, virgin sacrifices, fights, assassinating any virtual public figure you wanted - whew. And that was just the opening sequence. There is a lot of teen angst in this pilot so please be patient. It does figure into the story with the grown ups.

Ok, without giving the plot away you know religion, politics and the dawn of the first Cylons created on Caprica is what sets the wheels in motion.

That aside, I found this to be a 90 minute soap opera setup for the series to come.  This is not an action packed military romp through space.  There are mafia like figures, political and government drama as well as the teen angst and family theatre between the Greystones and the Adamas.

Still, I liked this settling into a city and the more deliberate pace.

If the drama in Caprica is as compelling and well written as the drama on LOST, then this series will be around to stay and may garner more viewers than die hard BSG fans.",1240272000,6,1087,4.378109452736318
3779481,4,B001RTCP1U,"With Battlestar Galactica now over, the team that brought us one of the best sci-fi shows of the last decade now step back into the series' own history with Caprica. Set 58 years before the fall of the colonies, this show has a very different feel and design from it's predecessor.
The story centres around two familles, the Greystones and the Adams, both of which are devastated when a suicide bombing on a maglev train kills Daniel Greystone's daughter and Joseph Adams' wife and daughter.
As the authorities investigate the bombing, evidence seems to indicate that Daniel's daughter Zoe may have been involved with a religious extremist group called 'Soldiers Of The One' who believe that there is only one god and not many.
While Joseph tries to help his son William through the trauma, he is asked by some of his Tauron colleagues to 'help' them with a legal issue. Being a man of moral standing, Joseph has trouble with what they want and tries to find a way out of the situation.
Daniel also has problems with both his wife, Amanda, and that his company's latest project, the U-78 (that's the old style Centurions!) is being threatened by an off-world corporation. As Daniel attempts to complete the project, a friend of Zoe's unwittingly shows him the way to solve his problem and a way to get his daughter back.
Zoe's ability to manipulate digital information and environments leads Daniel into a virtual reality world of night-clubs, sex, excess, human sacrifices and digital avatars.
Both Daniel and Joseph struggle to come to terms with their loss but in the wake of the tragedy they both begin to find something out about themselves.
For those fans wanting a show like BSG, this is not it.
Caprica is more akin to a modern day detective / legal / gangster drama with a few sci-fi elements in the mix. The show still deals with issues like BSG and tackles religion, racial tolerance, faith, monotheism vs. pantheism, terrorism, suicide bombings and the trauma of losing someone you love.
Eric Stoltz and Esai Morales are excellent as Daniel and Joseph. It will be interesting to see how these characters develop as the show continues through the first season. The show sports the same high production values and standards that we expected from BSG which gives the show a very cinematic look.
There are links to BSG and hopefully the plot lines about the first Cylon war will slowly develop as the series progresses. It was great to see the first Cylon Centurion perform it's basic tests and utter those immortal words ""By your command.""
Caprica has huge potential so lets just hope it gets the chance to fill in some back story for those who love Battlestar.

It took me about 5 secs and I was totally hooked. Man, was I wrong. BSG was just it! Almost perfect. (Granted the ending sucked big time). But when I watched Caprica I was really bored. I had to force me watching it to the end hoping, but to no avail. I did not care for any character. The teenie girls were ugly, boring, whatever. I am happy they are dead. Isn't there anybody good looking on the show (with the exception of Esai Morales)? Why to just copy an Italian mob stereotype and call it Tauron?

3779496,5,B001RTCP1U,"Caprica:  One Hell of a Beginning!
How `human' can robots be?  Can they possess a soul?  Can they feel?  Can they have memories?
These are four important questions that Ronald D Moore and David Eick ask in ""Caprica"",  a new stand alone series that continues (sort of) in the vein of Galactica.  On screen, ""Caprica""  revolves around two influential Caprican families joined in an instant of terrorism.  The death of two children bind them in grief, then bind them in a scientific experiment that dares to ask the question:  Can you bring the dead back to life in another `body'?  A secondary theme that runs through the film is that of Monotheism, and a belief in a God who is all knowing, and powerful.  Right and wrong smacks in the face of corporate right and wrong and profit margins.
The world of Caprica, as envisioned by Moore and Eick, is one of virtual nightclubs, modern cities, space travel, computer technology, and galactic economies that, in some ways, is not so far off ours today.  The teens travel in their virtual club, engaging in random sexual acts, witnessing human sacrifice, killing, drinking, and amidst this debauchery, find One god who makes sense of it all and empowers Zoey to change the world before her death.  Business legend, Daniel Greystone, in his grieving, `meets' his dead daughter in the club, and seeks to re-introduce her to the world.  Joseph Adama, has another reaction, yet still becomes part of the project.
As a film, this in incredible.  There is conflict.  There is theology.  There are moralistic arguments.  There is crass commercialism.  There is incredible technology that seeks to blur the line between man and god.  There is faith.  And there is pure, unadulterated lust.
There are few film scenes that can be considered powerful.  Images like the unveiling of Darth Vader in Star Wars, Rick saying goodbye to Ilsa and Victor Lazlo in Casablanca, John Wayne walking away from his niece in The Searchers, and Rocky raising his arms in victory will never be forgotten.  Today, we have a new addition to that list.  As the first cyborg/human robot rises and dials her friend then speaks with the voice of Zoey....a chill ran down my spine.
