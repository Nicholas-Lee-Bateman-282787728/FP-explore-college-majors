4952083,1,B0064NU002,"In 2010, a video was released entitled ""Paul McCartney Really Is Dead: The Last Testament of George Harrison"".  Being a long-time Beatle collector and fan, I checked it out.  Supposedly based on tapes received in the mail after George Harrison's death, it features a narration that is a horrible, less than amateurish impersonation of George Harrison's voice throughout.  It wasn't informative; it wasn't entertaining.  Furthermore, not only was the basic premise false, but it contained factual errors that a junior editor at a 3rd rate publishing house would have caught (like the official release date of the LP ""Revolver"".  In short, it was trash.

So when I got an e-mail this morning from Amazon advertising this video, and spotted Joel Gilbert's name on the cover, I quickly checked; you guessed it - the same man who brought you the aforementioned video about Paul McCartney.  If this forthcoming product has the same production values, factual errors and morbid curiosity factor as that video, do yourself a favor and stay away.  Mr. Gilbert - you should be ashamed of yourself.  Do something productive with your life.",1326067200,17,1128,5.086956521739131
4952084,1,B0064NU002,what how can they make a dvd like this......shame on you......why not make a dvd and tell us that dracula is for real.....talk about sick people......get a real job!!!!!,1325721600,6,169,4.862068965517241
4952085,5,B0064NU002,"I completely disagree with the opinions of 'O Henry' and 'Michael Kopec', posted December 13 and 20 - 2011, respectively, and the first two opinions posted about this insightful and probably and mostly true documentary movie.

I finished watching this documentary-expose on pay-per-view on December 31, 2011, and pre-ordered the DVD from Amazon that same night. Ever since that fateful day of August 16, 1977, I have maintained a theory that Elvis died of suicide to escape the intolerable pain of living here, and only God knows how much pain he endured from Colonel Tom Parker and a host of other users. I never shared the opinions of the 'Elvis is Alive Fan Club' and often even made jokes about them.

What I am skeptical of in this documentary is the version of how the documentary film team actually came upon the knowledge that Elvis is alive, is in the Federal Witness Protection program and living in California under the name of Jon Burrows. I am more inclined to believe that Elvis, himself, wanted to reveal and let the world know that he is still alive and as much of the facts and circumstances concerning his faked death as he is lawfully allowed to do. I am also more inclined to believe that everything leading up to his 'darkened room' interview as shown in the documentary was contrived between Elvis, certain Federal authorities and the film crew, in similar manner to his contrived death. After that point, the interview takes us back to entire review of Elvis' life and what really went on until as late as early 2011. Most all of it is very believable to me. USSR Premier Nikita Khrushchev's comment in 1956 that ""We will bury you!"" is a haunting reminder of what is and has been going on in this world against America for many years as confirmed by the Elvis interview in this documentary.

There is so much more that I could say about this movie, but why not let the future viewers decide for themselves as the evidence is all around US right now that the world is controlled by a greedy and criminal 'Mobster-Gangster-Monster Mindset'. There has never been a time before US that the ENTIRE world is consumed by corruption and greed on an unimaginable scale and rightly confirmed by the Elvis interview. It all makes so much since as we move toward a New Age under the True Christ-Messiah. I truly believe that this documentary has been timed to be released for the year 2012 as we move toward the eternally defining presidential election and the fulfillment of an ancient 2012 prophesy in a manner that clarifies itself more and more each day.

Lastly, I would like to go back and show why I so adamantly disagree with 'O Henry's' and ""Michael Kopec's' opinions. First, the definition of a 'Documentary' is:

1. Consisting of, concerning, or based on documents.
2. Presenting facts objectively without editorializing or inserting fictional matter, as in a book or film.
3. A work, such as a film or television program, presenting political, social, or historical subject matter in a factual and informative manner and often consisting of actual news films or interviews accompanied by narration.

Given that let me say that the film makers and producers of this movie depict it as a documentary and in no way have they or did they insert any disclaimer in the movie that it was a work of fiction meant only to entertain its viewers, and that is very important. Because if this is a work of fiction, but delivered as a documentary for payment per view or a DVD copy to audiences in the United States and the world, the producers are subject to CRIMINAL PROSECUTION FOR FRAUD under numerous domestic and international laws and more specifically the Federal Law on wire fraud, Title 18, United States Code, Section 1343. The elements of wire fraud are the same as mail fraud. In order to convict the defendant, federal prosecutions have to prove all of the following beyond a reasonable doubt:

 1. A scheme to defraud or obtain money or property by fraudulent pretenses.
 2. Intent.
 3. The making of materially false representations.
 4. Transmission by wire, radio, or television communication in interstate or foreign commerce.

Producers and filmmakers are not certain fools that would willfully and intentionally break such laws for minimal profits. And more specifically the Hollywood producers who are the 'Masters' of the spy and espionage thrillers certainly know how easy it would be for an antagonist of this movie to have electronic-digital voice analysis' done and compared between 'Elvis'' voice in this documentary and the 'Elvis' voice of pre-08-16-1977, in an effort to prove the movie is fiction and contrived and certainly not factual. Remember a person's voice is like their fingerprints and DNA - singular and unique to 99.9999+ percentile.",1325462400,16,4785,4.8504901960784315

4952098,3,B0064NU002,"I was 6 when Elvis died and remember being so sad.  While growing up through the years these stories or sightings of him being seen just wouldn't die.  So it can really start to make you question.  I don't know if Elvis died on August 16 1977 or not.  That being said, this movie starts out cheesy.  The FBI is not going to send redacted files on someone with wet ink on them to be able to wipe off and get information they don't want you to see.  Not gonna happen. The actors in the beginning are bad.  If you can get through that they have a seated man with a blacked out face who sounds like Elvis who explains why he faked his death.  There are countless impersonators  as we all know.  In my opinion this is a movie not a documentary.  Another reviewer says that if it's not Elvis then why does Celeste cry when she sees him?  Uhhh she's an actress. Personally I don't think she showed enough emotion cause she shoulda been freaking out. Then there's a YouTube video of her promoting the movie yet speaking of him in past tense.  It's fun to think about him still being alive and if it introduces a younger generation of fans to him, great!  Otherwise this is a work of fiction.",1506470400,,1183,4.246636771300448

4952106,1,B0064NU002,"This movie is beyond horrible.  First they receive a package from the FBI with wet ink on it.  Seriously?  Did someone from the FBI just dump a bunch of ink on the documents a few seconds ago, wrap them up in a box and deliver them?  Then they wiped all the wet ink off the documents.  Next they go to a house that is owned by a man with Elvis alias name, Jon Burrows.  There is an old car in the parking lot with a bunch of old bumper stickers of presidential races on them and the TCB logo on the side.  Oh yeah, and there are guns just lying in the car.  It is full of 8 track tapes, all Elvis.  Every Elvis fan knows that Elvis liked to listen to other music, not his own.  Elvis says that he is in the federal witness protection program..under his alias that all Elvis know.  I turned it off after that.  Complete trash.",1500076800,2,825,4.0246913580246915

4952120,4,B0064NU002,"Most of it is factual according to Jesse. Some things are not true. Jesse said Vernon died not knowing he was alive, so how could Vernon have come up with the wax replica for the funeral ? A few other things very controversial. The only way to have the whole truth is from Jesse's own words.",1493424000,,291,4.214285714285714
4952121,3,B0064NU002,"Very entertaining, but the element of time works against it. Elvis was battling weight in his older age and, though the voice remains fairly stable over the years, it's apparent in this case that the actor is simply reading and that he's substantially younger than a real Elvis would be.

Another problematic aspect is theology. Despite his Jewish roots, Elvis was a devout Christian, and he didn't incorporate Christianity into Judaism but, rather, he incorporated Judaism into his Christian beliefs.

Finally, if he did fake his own death, he most likely did so for much less complicated reasons than presented here. If he wanted to come clean, he could do so without worrying about his fan base...providing he was able to convince them there was a viable reason he dropped out of sight. If alive, he owes it to history to come clean before he dies (it would be a disaster). Was this mockumentary a ""floater"" to gauge how Americans would react to a resurrection of the King? I doubt it, but if he's waited this long and is still alive, it's almost too late.",1490313600,,1059,4.718918918918919

4952127,3,B0064NU002,"An intriguing look at an alternative 'what-if' history if Elvis had lived into the present day. The movie is a skillful blending of fact and supposition although I'm not sure of the accuracy of his stated views on various personalities (e.g. in the movie, he said he didn't care for the Beatles but in his '68 comeback special during an interlude, he said he liked the Beatles) or his conservative political views with a conspiratorial bent (i.e. President Obama being a tool of Bill Ayers (i.e. Captain Nazi)) or the plausibility of him becoming the Federal Agent Jon Burrows after faking his death in spite of his request to become a DEA agent from Nixon during his White House visit almost 7 years earlier. Also, in spite of keeping a low profile, don't you think he would have eventually been found out after 30+ years and not simply be the object of sporadic 'sightings'? But all-in-all, a very entertaining 'pretend' documentary on one of our greatest rock-and-roll entertainers.",1486598400,,985,4.869047619047619

Feels like some high-school kids got a camera and came up with a ""clever"" idea for a film and hauled in a bunch of friends and then shot ""some shots"" and then cut together in iMovie or something else that was free and they didn't have to ""learn"".
I'm sure the bad production values were partly intentional to give it some ""reality"", but at some point it just gets shoddy.  Poorly written, as in was it even written?  Poorly shot, poorly edited, though hard to tell since I bet the footage was a mess so maybe excellent salvage editing (but there is a saying in filmmaking postproduction, ""it doesn't matter how much you polish, a turd is still a turd"".

4952301,5,B0064NU002,"This is a clever movie.  At first it starts off as amateurish, and leads you to believe that this is going to be two hours of bad acting, including a bad Elvis imitation and corny jokes.  But as soon as they meet Elvis, the movie shifts gears into something more serious.  Most of it is taken from actual footage of Elvis, his concerts, and appearances, and from his biography, so it has a ring of truth to it.  Nothing seems made up, or exaggerated.  After a time, it makes connections, most of them very believable, between seemingly unrelated real-life incidents and events with other prominent persons, such as Mob figures, and Elvis's own activities, including his claim of a secret life as an FBI agent.  It also asks his opinions on a great many things, including past and present U.S. Presidents, and past and present singing stars and musicians, including especially the Beatles.

Its speculative story line and the ""proof"" presented for it through time-lines of real events make it impossible to determine in most cases whether the various revelations are true or just speculation.  The research done for this movie must have been enormous, and its presentation was very nearly flawless by my own speculation.  In other words, you sit there and wonder: are you learning something new, or is this part of the fictional story line?  Difficult to know unless you take the trouble to do in-depth research.  Some of it, however, requires to be a believer in an Elvis who's still alive and well, so you bring your own speculation into it.

There is some humor, and a lot of it had to do with the parallels drawn between Elvis's life and that of the comic-book character Captain Marvel, Jr.  I read some of the other reviews, and at least one indicated that the movie makes Elvis look foolish, or even childish.  I had the opposite impression.  I think it makes him human in the way it shows some of his quirks and foibles, and it also makes him somewhat endearing, as he tries in a serious and well thought-out way to go beyond being merely the King of Rock and Roll, and do something good for his country.

So there are two ways to look at this movie: you can either be cynical, and believe that it was done to make him look like some rural hick who was really in way over his head; and if that was the intent, I think it failed.  The second way is to see it as a political film using one of history's best-known icons in a very believable context to get a point across.  If that's the case, it succeeded, at least for me.  As I said, this is a clever movie.  I enjoyed it for what it was, entertainment, but most of all I enjoyed the way facts were unfolded to make the fictional story line so believable.",1472515200,16,2711,4.482688391038696

The Beatles messed up a lot of the music and to blame Elvis because of his ways in how he performed was totally insane.

Loved the footage as always, pictures & a lot of the movie does have real facts.  It addresses a lot of things.  Its one of those fantastic ""what if"" type of movies which is actually really smart being that there's so many alivers out there to make money off of.  But, recognize this for what it is, a conspiracy theory mockumentary.  He's still dead people.  Just a little bit of research will show he battled numerous heath conditions/diseases, including some that were hereditary. That combined with a poor diet and bad lifestyle.....there's no scientific way he could possibly be alive today.  Trial research in defense of his doctor and new developments in science show that he suffered from autoimmune disorder and chronic back pain from a slipped disc.  Its silly & even got several chuckles out of me. Elvis never knew about operation fountain pen & he was never undercover & I think most of us realize that's been debated, inquired and written to death about.  Worth a watch for Elvis fans for the footage alone but don't take it seriously.  The constant references to Marvel Jr. comics & him constantly acting like hes an american hero were annoying.",1471478400,,1307,4.816143497757848

But the logic of this interview and what his guide was unusual but not unheard of if these comic book is truly was his self fulling prophecies. One could understand if he truly was not making the money in his career anymore, had an outrageous contract where Col Tom Parker took 50% of his performances. An artist was never a legend until they die. An artists work is worth more when they are a memorie. It makes financial sense. We all knew he gathered badges even as a federal agent granted by Nixion. His middle name misspelled on the headstone and the death certificate and his medical records were never misspelled. Documentation lacks an autopsy. When the all those at Graceland had contridictory stories. The most heard was he fell off his toilet and so mothered in the shag carpet. It makes you think...there was truly a pictures of him spotted watching people viewing his casket. Before Elvis impersonators were building a reputation.

4952372,4,B0064NU002,"This thing certainly shows show creative license, but, generally in the right direction for what I'll call ""mock credibility"". Foremost, it paints what quite a few people believe at his core Elvis surely must have been - the hippest square cat ever.  I mean that as a compliment.  Except for the curious manager his lot became tangled with, Elvis was just a super talented man with the heart of a child.  Elvis only showed signs an of his own choosing apart from his controlling manager who probably was a Dutch murderer never convicted.  This is real fact stranger than fiction.

As for this movie.  It starts out a little shaky, like it's a very low budget joke without real direction.  That's misleading as soon as Jon Burrows is on screen things really pick up.  First there's the voice which is exactly, I mean perfect, spot-on Elvis's voice.  This is amazing!  Think of this, real voices are hard to sustain complete belief, heck no voice artist who've tried have ever even created a reasonable facsimile of any single one of Mel Blanc's ""created"" voices of any of the Looney Tunes characters.  I say this because created voices are generally accepted to be easier to mimic than actual real voices.  The voice of Elvis here is the voice of Elvis and it never veers into fakery.  This isn't to say it's Elvis, I know it isn't but it is the jumping off point where this film begins to shine.  But, then there's the thoughtful progression of very real topics that Elvis would be sure to have an opinion.  In life we only got to get a glimpse of Elvis's personal views on topics such as music, drugs, crime, and politics.  I believe the dialogue between Elvis and the writer/filmmaker proves he was very aware of just what Elvis might like to say and, generally, didn't at the time he was alive.  That gives this film more potential and never lacks that magic of being entertaining to hear in the voice of Elvis.  Some of it certainly is spot-on as to what I imagine Elvis thought regardless of how true it might be since Elvis could truly live in a bubble of his own creation.

Here's where I find a real kernel of truth, in the comments Elvis has explaining his path after the death of his mother and the rise of The Beatles.  I think Elvis was devastated and never was the same after the death of Gladys. I think he struggled with how to remain vital and some of his real talent, not luck, began to show when he hit his Memphis streak.  His frustration and explanation of shooting his TV had a particularly real sad ring to it while remaining humorous.  Elvis knew more about crime and politics than he probably ever revealed at the time and it's refreshing to hear what is likely to be the way he called it like he saw it - and probably history has and will continue to bear out to be more truth than fiction.  It's like hearing a man who really had it right because music was downhill after '77 and our national begin to truly fall apart at an alarming rate even in the final year of Regan's two terms beginning with the Iran-Contra scandal.  What began as a mockumentary became more and I give this film kudos for being able to actually go there.

So, Elvis really didn't live in reality...but, he lives again here and it's a pretty impressive take on how he would be if he was actually alive to do a film like this.  For all the fantasy it has something that feels like it might just be close to the truth if he did live.  That is why this is good creative art and not just a throwaway fake documentary.  Hmm, I think I agree with most of the view's Elvis posits here so with the expert voice delivery this becomes something like Elvis talking from the grave much more than I would have ever believed in the first 10-minutes.  It actually got better and better in my humble opinion.  Really makes one want to believe even though you know better.

At first it didn't seem quite real but has he tells his story it seems to all make sense and the reasons he did what he did to include faking his death. If this is not a true documentary, they did a good job. He sounded like Elvis. One reviewer said there was no way he would have had the same voice that he would have sounded older. That is not always true for everyone. I've had some people talk to me on the phone and though I was a young adult. I've also heard others whos voice did not change. I prefer to believe it is real although it may not be. I went to his exhibit in Las Vegas his birthday weekend and also got to tour his suites. I was young when he died, but cried when he died. He was eccentric in his younger days from giving cars away to wearing capes. I even knew an gate guard that use to work for him who recently died last year. Who told about how he like to play jokes on people and fun loving. I did have a hard time believing that the paperwork that they got in the mail still had wet ink on it.  That would have been dried before they received it. Its a great film anyway.  It is sad to think of him as dying young, I much prefer him living his life.",1452556800,,1248,3.8901960784313725

4952388,5,B0064NU002,"I loved it, very entertaining.  I am a huge Elvis fan and have read over 40 books on Elvis.  The ones I truly believe are the ones written by family members and close friends. Gilbert really did his research before making this film.  When he asked ""Elvis' his favorite things, he had it spot on.  All of the answers were not in just one of the books I ever read.  Every book might have mentioned one or two things so that is how I know Gilbert really did some research.  I saw reviews that said the food choice was wrong; that it should have been peanut butter & banana sand. but in truth one of Elvis' favorite foods was mashed potatoes and sauerkraut.  The actor portraying Elvis sounded like I believe he would sound today and he definitely had his hand gestures down pat and you would see these if you ever watched videos of Elvis when not on stage.  I loved seeing all of the ""real"" Elvis videos that were included too.  I hate to tell all of you who really believe that Elvis did not die on August 16, 1977 but Elvis was a very very sick man.  Even if he did fake his death, he would not have lived much longer.  Again, I am only going by what the friends and family members wrote but think about it;  he was overweight, had heart problems, high blood pressure, damaged liver, and serious colon problems. I think God was merciful when He took him.  I pray we all get to see him again one day when our time on earth is done.",1444262400,,1429,4.190476190476191

4952397,5,B0064NU002,"Now if you believe or don't believe then that is you choice to make, everyone will choose one side to the other, but all I can tell you from my own view point, is that I loved this documentary "" Elvis Found Alive "" that Joel Gilbert did & put together.  I did a whole lot of research, did a lot of reading concerning Elvis & trying to figure out, because I wanted to really know, if he "" Elvis Presley "" did indeed faked his own death & from what I read & the research that I did, I know for a fact now that "" Elvis Presley "" ( no matter what name his is using to this day ) did indeed fake his own death, because NOTHING about the death of "" Elvis Presley "" & the way he was suppose to have died made any kind of sence what so ever, NOTHING about "" Elvis Presley's "" death really added up at all, at lease to me it didn't.  I am a true to heart "" Elvis Presley "" fan, I have loved "" Elvis Presley "" every since I was a little girl & the only reason why I did all this reading & research is like I said before, I really had to know & I also wanted to know if "" Elvis Presley "" was really alive or not.  I got this DVD "" Elvis Found Alive "" because I wanted to see what it was all about & wheather or not it was just all facts or just fake & made up & while watching this DVD & the moment when I heard the man's voice in this DVD named "" Jon Burrows "" start talking, I knew right away that he "" JON BURROWS "" was indeed the one & only "" ELVIS PRESLEY "" himself, because this man "" JON BURROWS "" knew "" PIN POINT "" little details about "" ELVIS PRESLEY'S "" life that ONLY "" Elvis Presley "" himself would know.  EVERYTHING & I mean EVERYTHING that this man "" JON BURROWS "" talked about concerning "" Elvis Presley "" & what happened all thoughout "" Elvis Presley's "" life made PERFECT SENCE & like I said before, the ONLY ONE WHO WOULD KNOW all these details down to the sightest detail would be "" ELVIS PRESLEY "" himself & nobody else.  Look at it this way, if someone other than you was to tell another person all about your life, they WOULDN""T know everything, every little detail(s) about your life, especially if they are telling it to another person.  The ONLY person who would know everything & every little detail about your life is you & only you, not even if it was your wife, husband, parent, kids or whatever the case maybe at the time, because they would always be something that would be left out, that ONLY you could say or tell concerning your life.  So that's why I know for sure that this man named "" JON BURROWS "" is indeed none other than "" ELVIS PRESLEY "" himself, I would make a bet on it.  Now like I said before, everyone can choose to believe or not to believe wheather "" Elvis Presley "" is alive or not, wheather he faked his own death or not, that is up to the person who chooses to believe or not, just like when it comes to "" Michael Jackson "" faking his own death, which I know that he "" MICHAEL JACKSON "" did indeed fake his own death as well.  But when it comes to me & wheather or not I believe that "" ELVIS PRESLEY "" is still alive or not, that I do believe that you can make a bet on, because I know for a fact that both "" Elvis Presley & Michael Jackson "" are both alive & they did indeed fake their own death, but for very good reasons, that only they know the reason why, but it's not up to us to say to the other, I just know that this Jon Burrows is indeed "" Elive Presley "" & "" Elivs Presley "" is ALIVE to this day & I'm glad!!!!",1438646400,2,3464,3.8335664335664337

The sound and video quality and the narrator were amateurish, like a college vid project. But, when 'The King' appears, seated, backlit, in the 'witness protection style' in what looks like the 'jungle room' at Graceland, it got better fast. 'Elvis', as other reviewers have noted, has the voice down cold! What he says and how he says it, even the chuckles and asides are creepy real, and so much fun. What I didn't expect and was so happy to watch, is that the majority of the running time is a warm and accurate review of Elvis's life story, told with great film clips and stills. It's like sitting in Graceland, listening to Elvis tell his own life story to home movies. It's all there: his frank admissions to prescription drug dependence, his ups and downs with his 'mafia', Priscilla and the Colonel. What I learned new was his incidental brushes with organized  crime through the Rat Pack and of all folks, the Colonel!  I've just re-discovered Elvis after 50 years of neglect, and a tour of Graceland this past December. This weird movie is something I will want to share with friends and watch again.

Captain Marvel, really?  Elvis had class and if (and that's a BIG if) he is alive; I pray he is truly enjoying his life.  Mr. Gilbert must have paid the bad Elvis impersonator to say he was actually Elvis.  What a shame!  I saw Elvis in concert back in 1974, and I will never forget what his voice sounded like.  Not only did he sing, he talked to the audience and expressed his love and appreciation to his fans.  If (and again that's a BIG if), Elvis was alive he would  be more than likely singing gospel in a nice little church somewhere.  Mr. Gilbert failed to mention on the DVD Elvis' love for the Lord and gospel music.  That is an undeniable fact!  Sure, he made a lot of money in the secular world but his heart was truly gospel since he was a young boy.  I would have loved to had a one on one conversation with the 'real' Elvis.  This amazing man was anointed. Mr. Gilbert needs to research the old video clips where several young girls were screaming hysterically, ""Elvis is the king!""  Elvis replied to them; ""there's only one King and that's Jesus Christ!""  In my opinion; anyone especially in the entertainment world who openly professes ""there's only one King and that's Jesus Christ""  is without a doubt the real deal, and Elvis Presley was the real deal.

  I was young when Elvis Presley died and never knew much about the circumstances of his death. In this chilling DVD it is very

clear as to why he faked his death, with the help of the Government. Elvis made a lot of enemies by working for the Government

as an informant and as a result had many death threats from many different groups.

  In addition, the person that was in the casket resembled Elvis but was not him, as he was much skinnier than Elvis. Some at the

Funeral were not sure if that actually was Elvis, including a shadowy figure that was part of one of the groups that were trying to kill

him, who happened to be present at the Funeral.

  In this DVD you will not see the face of Elvis probably because he is in protective custody, but when you here his voice, it will

send chills up your spine because you will realize the truth for the 1st time in almost 40 years, which is that Elvis Presley Never

Died !!!",1398038400,7,1013,4.123076923076923

Is it all true - probably not - but it sure has been all thought through carefully enough to make you want to believe it is and the constant intercutting with real life footage recalls such films as JFK and Nixon. You even get to hear the King belt out some new songs - included is a moving pop video to his daughter. Also of interest is Elvis' beliefs about how Obama became president and that because of those beliefs Elvis would only attempt a public comeback if Obama didn't get re-elected - that of course didn't happen and Obama remains in the white house and Elvis' comeback will have to remain on hold until there's a new president in town.

You don't sound in your older years like you do when you are 30. Dont care who you are. Also, it sounded like he was reading a script during the whole interview. I did love some of the shocking words  that he used. Had him swearing like a good ol boy. I think it's a fun watch. And probably most all of it is true.......at least up until the time he would have died in real life. Heck....maybe its all true.

4952480,2,B0064NU002,"This project actually has an interesting premise: Information about Elvis is requested via the Freedom of Information Act and the materials sent are so hot off the presses that the ink covering the redacted info can be wiped off the page. The exposed info reveals that Elvis is still alive and living under the assumed name of Jon Burrows. In more imaginative hands, this could have been an entertaining movie. What this project turns out to be is a lengthy and bloated plug for a soundtrack featuring an Elvis sound-alike (do we really need to hear Elvis sing Wanna Be Starting Something, or Every Breath You Take).

At more than two hours, the documentary really drags during the first hour. Its basically a retelling of Elvis life from his birth to his supposed death. Only in the second hour does the pace pick up, and thats primarily due to the many outrageous scenarios described by Elvis.  He claims to have been an undercover agent for the DEA and helped to bring down the Mafia, the 70s political group the Weathermen, and was even involved with 9/11. There are other extreme claims, like Bill Clinton was at Elvis funeral, and the whole faked funeral was organized by Dr. Nick (details of the plot are provided).

Also, throughout the two hours there was ridiculous dialogue that had Elvis stating he wanted to be like Captain Marvel Jr., and that all the women in his life either needed to, or did, resemble Mary Marvel. The way this was presented came off as creepy. Elvis may have liked comic books, but I found this insulting to Elvis memory.

Most of us agree that Elvis died way too young, and its still difficult to comprehend how he let himself go. As much as we would like to have him with us, he is in gone  but certainly not forgotten!!

If you feel you must see this project, find somebody who has already parted with their hard earned money. If you want to see how a story line about Elvis can be over-the-top and yet entertaining, dig up Nixon Meets Elvis. In fact, its on youtube.",1389484800,,2005,4.555555555555555
4952481,5,B0064NU002,You know for me this film was done so that Elvis could tell his story good bad or indifferent the point of the fact is If Elvis is still alive. He has to be careful at how he goes about letting anything come out about him and especially if as to do with him faking his death. If you watch this video and use just a little bit of your brain you would know that a lot of what happened on this video had to be staged for his own protection and Priscilla and Lisa Marie's as well. First a foremost the F.B.I. Would never have sent anyone files that were still as wet as the ones that Mr. Gilbert received unless it was staged to be able to make a point. Which it was. And next there is no way that Elvis/Jon Borrows could love in a house in a subdivision that the house's were that close together without someone else already knowing who lived next door to them were. Without a place to make a video so he could tell his story. And he would never have a Cadillac of that age setting in the driveway with his D.E.A. Uniform laying in the back seat in plan view for all to see. With all the old 8 track laying all over with 2 guns in the back seat in plan view and the car with no engine in it setting there unless it was to help make a statement. And who in the world could live in a house that is so close to the others with the name Burrows on the mail box. Again staged to make a statement so he could tell his story. And most important don't you know not just think that if this video didn't have Lot's of truth to it someone would have done had they're rear ends taken to court and sewed to the hilt. This man if it was Elvis sure did through a lot of important people under the bus for them to just let it mean nothing to them. Because for it to have been not much or a bunch of crap to several people it sure seems like a lot of people have bought this video so that means a lit of people has seen it. And this guy if it isn't Elvis then he has been practicing for 24 hours a day 7 days a week 52 weeks out of the year for the last 35 years or so the manuerisiums or just like Elvis and I know there are a lot of people out there that can sound a lot like him but even they don't sound like him in everything they say. And this guy is right on. I am just saying that I to have been an Elvis fan all my life. And I have all the faith in the world in him. And I know a lot. But I would never want to do anything to endanger him or any of his family. But I also know that he believes in The Lord Jesus Christ and he would want to set the record straight. And I believe with enough protection for himself and his family he just might make a come back. If People out there have enough faith in him to believe that he did what he did to protect his family. The video only gave him away that in time if God is willing he will get to come back and set the the recorded straight in person. But it is video's like this that will help him pave the way to be able to do just that. God Bless Joel Gilbert and most of all God Bless Elvis Aron Presley and his Family. T.C.B.for E.A.P.

4952482,1,B0064NU002,"This movie seemed amaturely made.  I thought it was going to follow Elvis today possibly singing again, etc.  Instead, it was about a group of videographers who found Elvis living today in a house under an assumed name.  The worst part of it is that you never see him.  They interview him for the length of the movie and he is in a dark room. All you see is mostly his hand gestures.  The interview just talks about his life before and after his supposed death. It is actually so contrived and boring.  The videographers get to snap one photo of Elvis and that's what you see when you choose this movie from the list on Amazon. The head looks like it was superimposed on a smaller body.

Fun. So much fun that I wanted it to be true. A must see for Elvis fans and fans of conspiracies. And you know, maybe it's based on the truth...go for it...",1388361600,2,456,4.440476190476191

4952485,2,B0064NU002,"This mockumentary reveals through FBI documents that Elvis is still alive, living under witness protection under an assumed name (Jon Burrows). The premise is not very believable, with the documents arriving to the filmmaker's studio with wet ink on them. The actors are talentless & unconvincing, except for ""Elvis"" who was mostly on point. An audio interview takes place, and Elvis' face is blacked out for his protection. What you mostly see are his hands which are too young looking for a man in his late 70's and the fingers are too stumpy to be the real Elvis'. There is a decently done photoshop ""photo"" of the older Elvis, only to be ruined by a poor cut & paste job.

The Q&A section reveals some trivia about Elvis, much of which is true, with urban legends and ridiculous conspiracy theories thrown in. The editing during the interview was well done, probably the most professional looking part of this project. Key points of Elvis' career, life and death are covered, including the death of the two young girls who were killed by an angry drunk driver during the memorial outside Graceland. A part they left out that would have been interesting, is that there was a third young lady who was run over and survived. A man rushed to her side at the scene of the crime, and wound up harassing her for years, until he was finally sent away by the girl's father & brother. In the 1990's,  the man wound up on death row for killing a young girl.

The thing that is really disappointing about this film, is that it tried to draw in fans of Elvis to push an absurd political agenda towards the end. It is totally out of place with the rest of the interview and was the most annoying part besides seeing the dork interviewer putting his hands all over Jon Burrow's nice Cadillac like a cretin.

Anyway, this was something different and might be something for Elvis fans who won't take it too seriously. I was really confused by the appearance of Celeste Yarnall in this. Maybe she is related to one of the filmmakers, or else why would she agree to appear? Even the Director doesn't seem to want to be named and shamed for this.",1388102400,,2130,4.5390625

Like Woody Allen's ""Zelig"", the film mixes and mashes the real and the unreal with masterful use of historical film and video clips. Elvis rises even bigger here than he did in life. I had no problem with the politics (as some reviewers here did). Be honest: this film is no more a fantasy than so-called documentaries such as ""Fahrenheit 911"" or ""An Inconvenient Truth"". But in the real world, a 1960s terrorist, turned national political puppet master, really did befriend the angry young man who became the most disasterous U.S. President in our history; we've all inherited that ill wind.

The folks at Highway 61 Entertainment are LOUSY actors but the actor playing Elvis did a great job.  Just about all of the post-death storylines of Elvis' life were a bit laughable (FBI, DEA, meeting Presidents) but I truly enjoyed the clarity of the fictions.

If she had collapsed sobbing when meeting Elvis the selling factor would have soared a hundred-fold.  Her eyes barely got wet.

At the beginning some of what they showed seemed unrealistic, but I think if you are a really a die hard fan somewhere in your mind you keep hoping it's true and it's him? I found myself asking if this is truly Elvis why doesn't he come forward now, come home  and explain why he did what he did? Sometimes I felt foolish having such thoughts but I guess he had such an influence on all of us we keep hoping he is alive and we could  see him again.

and in the words of the entertainer Ronnie McDowell's song,

And let me tell you this folks, I'm not delusional in any way, I know the Voice of Elvis Aron Presley, both Singing and his speaking voice. I can tell immediately whether the '' voice '' is Elvis or the voice of some impersonator or Elvis Tribute Artist. I have listen over and over so many times to the 15 new songs on the ''ELVIS FOUND ALIVE '' ! CD  and I have listened and watched the Documentary interview on the DVD '' ELVIS Found Alive '' ! so many
times that I have lost count. I have study it intensely and mark my words ,
Ladies and Gentlemen, the Voice on both the CD and the DVD is none other than the Voice of the one and only ELVIS ARON PRESLEY, the King of Music, the Artist of the Century!
One can not duplicate one's voice print anymore than one can duplicate one's fingerprints or DNA! THIS IS ELVIS, second to NONE!
I know that there are Elvis impersonators or ETA's that sound somewhat like Elvis when they sing,but none of them are exactly the same and none of them match 100 % by Voice Print. And none of them can duplicate his natural speaking voice !
Elvis Aron Presley is now living as Jesse Presley, aka Jon Burrows.
He staged and faked his death with the help and knowledge of Col. Tom Parker,
Dr. '' Nick '' , Joe Esposito, and the FBI by doing a '' Body Swap '' with a Terminal Bone Cancer patient name of Roscoe Holloway of which Dr. Nichopolous had located.
After some minor cosmetic surgery they made Roscoe Holloway look like a Elvis look-a-like a ''double'' which fooled the Paramedics,the hospital personnel except for a few nurses, and most of his family members.
Elvis, aka Jon Burrows, was a U.S. Federal Special Agent that worked undercover in various '' sting operations '' against known members of the SDS ,  Weathermen Underground Terrorist Group. The SDS Weathermen Underground Terrorist Group was responsible for numerous multiple bombings of Police Departments , Federal and State Court Houses and other public buildings during the 1960's and 1970's.
Bill Ayers was the SDS Leader of this terrorist group and also a personal friend and Mentor to a one Barry Soetoro, aka Barrck Hussein Obama
and it was the SDS Weathermen Underground Terrorist Group that put Barry Soetoro, aka Barrack Hussein Obama into Politics and made him the Socialist Thug that he is and a threat to the American way of life as we know it.
Elvis, aka Jon Burrows, the name he used when working for the DEA-FBI as a Special Federal Agent, was appointed by the former late President Richard M. Nixon and he worked as a Federal Agent from 1972 untill his retirement in 2004.
Elvis, aka Jesse/Jon Burrows is currently in the Federal Witness Protection program because of threats made by members of the SDS Weathermen Underground Terrorist Group, Bill Ayers and threats by certain key members of the Mafia Organized Crime Syndicate, which Agent Burrows, aka Elvis , took part in various undercover '' sting operations '' to indict and bring them to Justice.
All these facts are told in a documentary interview that Elvis / Jesse, aka Jon Burrows, gave,  recorded and released on a DVD in January 2012.
Elvis, aka Jon Burrows also recorded and released a brand new CD of 15 songs in January of 2012.
Both have been voice authenicated 100 % as the voice of Elvis Aron Presley.
Elvis was a Bonded, Certified & Trained Deputy Sheriff with the Shelby County Sheriff's Dept. in Memphis,TN,  a Reserve Police Captain in the Memphis PD , a Honorary Police Captain with Denver PD and a Honorary Deputy Sheriff with the LA County Sheriff's Dept.

In fact, at one point, the voice almost sounded like Nixon with a cold.

I think that most everyone, at least those from the Elvis generation would like to think that he is alive-and-well, somewhere in America.

Yes, this is a very elaborate story of how and why Elvis faked his death and in the end is all to make you think (because Elvis does of course) Obama is a socialist puppet working for an underground party who is out to destroy the nation.

Before you bother watching this, you might want to check out the production company's website (Highway 61 Entertainment) which shows their other 'documentaries' also clearly aimed at discrediting Obama and trying to say he's destroying the country. Clearly an agenda here, and talk about propaganda, oh wait, at least propaganda can actually fool people. The guy playing 'Elvis' doesn't even attempt to act well, he's just basically reading lines from cards in a very dry, boring, way.

Some of the storyline seems pretty out there but then again truth can be stranger than fiction.  I purchased this out of curiosity and because there was quite a controversy about it, so I had to take a look and decide myself.  The movie is definitely worthwhile; it brings back a lot of memories from the last 50 or so years and it's as if you are having Elvis himself talk to you and update you on his life, and I sat there listening to him totally captured by the power of Elvis to elicit as he always did for me a feeling of joy and appreciation for his having been a part of my life perhaps if not in the foreground of my mind for decades now at least always in the background somewhere lurking, which is perhaps true for many if not most of the babyboomers living today.

  I bought this DVD new for $5.99 at a 1/2 price book store. We watched it once and that will probably do it for us. This movie starts off bad but gets a little better and becomes somewhat entertaining although parts of it are silly. There is a constant superhero reference that ""cheese-i-fied"" an already cheesy movie. Had they not included this AND had some better actors & script, I might have given this film a 4 star(for a B-movie). The actor that played Elvis(yes it was not really Him...)was pretty good/acceptable, considering they never showed ""Him"". I know that there are some pretty hardcore Elvis fans (Elvis worshippers?) out there, but part of the entertainment for me was to remember these 1 star reviews while watching this film. I like all kinds of music including Elvis and I even own 4 Elvis concert DVD's but I think people go wayyy overboard as is the case with the ""how dare you"" reactions to this little film. Priscilla gets ""dissed"" a bit but IMO, if anyone should be upset, it might be the Sinatra family as Francis Albert Sinatra's alleged mafia or mobster ties are referenced repeatedly throughout this masterpiece. My guess is that the Sinatra family won't be filing any lawsuits anytime soon, CAUSE IT'S ONLY A CHEESY LOWBUDGET SPOOF, people.
  I suggest borrowing or renting this one or you can just have mine. My trash goes out Thursday night though. Btw, there is a companion music CD by the same name, that you can buy with new Elvis music. The guy singing is actually pretty good. The DVD's bonus section lets you sample them.

I love ""Every Breath You Take""....Elvis did a fabulous job on that song and all of them too. He is so wonderful and still the amazing man he always was. There is no doubt and if he would just come out, he would see how we are STILL here for him waiting as we always have been and always will be. I love you so much Elvis Presley.

Love,

To start, no, I don't think Elvis is alive, but I was impressed with the Elvis impersonator in this film. He has a good voice and knows how to phrase things as Elvis would.

Now, onto the film:

The first 10 minutes of the film are lousy and goofy. I worried that the film would be a piece of crap. However, once the documentary film crew sits down with ""Elvis"", things pick up steam.

The beginning of the interview with Elvis has him recounting his early life and then his success in the music business. This section of the film is actually a good true-to-the-facts documentary of Elvis's life written by some people who know their stuff. If this section of the film had been released as a stand-alone video biography, it would be worth seeing on its own.

The final section of the interview is what really pulled me in, but had my wife rolling her eyes. I think you have to be an Elvis fan to enjoy the final section of the film.

Basically the filmmakers describe, through their interview with Elvis, how Elvis might have survived his reported death. They also take what was known about Elvis' political leanings and extrapolate what side of the culture wars he'd currently fall on.

I thought, knowing a hell of a lot about Elvis, that the filmmakers did a good job mixing fact and speculation. Despite knowing a lot about Elvis, I sometimes wondered at what point the facts ended and the fiction began.

This film has specific relevance to the current age because Elvis was basically a law enforcement junkie who didn't have a lot of love for hippies, or radical extremists like the Weathermen. In this film, Elvis has a special distaste for the head of the Weathermen who is (no kidding - look it up) a mentor to Obama. Elvis doesn't have much good to say about the republicans or the democrats, but he has it in for the Obama administration and their ties to the radical left. I thought that this was a pretty good read of Elvis' politics.

A very good and head-spinning trip for those of us who know the Elvis story well.

P.S. I scripted my own rock mockumentary for Youtube director Frank Stamm, and that is now online.",1336953600,2,2141,4.494845360824742

If you watch this you are seriously disturbed or just want to waste some of your time. You could be watching the real Elvis singing.

I came across this DVD by recommendation of a lady named Linda Hood Sigmon(""Shuma"") who claims Elvis is alive and under the name ""Jesse""(age 78). Elvis also used the name ""Jon Burrows"" while he was on tour and later as his status as a ""special assistant"" to the BNDD the forerunner of DEA.(Credentials given to him by President Richard Nixon at the White House in 1972, my former work place in 1974-1977)

I was originally just looking at 50's music when I came across Linda Sigmon's website by mistake. I was very interested as all the facts seem to indicate Elvis ""may"" still be alive, but there are many discrepancies.

I have seen this DVD by Joel Gabriel and reviewed all the facts which are interesting but lacking in fact or truth and policies and procedures with regards to FOIA and many other procedures referred to by the alleged ""Elvis"" in the DVD and producer Joel Gabriel.

Ultimately, I talked to people in my former agency at U.S. Secret Service and agents who actually worked on Reagan's detail DENIED any contacts or photo sessions with Elvis Presley and Reagan during the time of his presidency. (Photo shop was indicated by the agent) Even agents of the association of former Secret service agents denied that Elvis was alive and that the DVD was faked with photos that were photo shopped.

I also checked with the White House and Press Corps and they have no record of the photos of Jimmy Carter with Elvis Presley who later asked for special presidential protection which Carter ""allegedly denied. (This in itself is inaccurate as the President can order ""protection"" for any individual he so chooses under Executive Orders. In this Faked DVD, Elvis was denied by Carter claiming he had no authority. This makes it look as if Carter lied and this is not the truth)

There was a statement from Linda Sigmon and ""Jesse""(aka Elvis) claiming the DVD was good and to purchase it. Then later claimed the DVD was after all a ""FAKE"" and apologized for it including the alleged Jesse aka Elvis who claimed he was ""extorted into doing this DVD. (also a fake/hoax, otherwise why didn't he report this to the police or FBI??)

Finally, I decided to ask some people I knew to do a ""forensic"" voice analysis to prove one way or another if this was really Elvis aka Jesse aka Jon Burrows in Simi Valley. So far the tests derived directly from the DVD ""Elvis Found Alive"" and compared with other ""known"" recordings of the real Elvis prove it is a fake(The test resulted on only 56% of the fake voice when you need 80% or better. So it appears to be a very good impersonator's voice)Further tests are pending now.(See Easy Voice Bio-metrics Below)********

****EVB FINAL TEST Results: March 29, 2012 BEGIN: The EVB Forensic test results are NOT positive for the alleged Elvis (impersonator)voice on the DVD. Here's what the EVB forensic technician said: ""I ran the test on these new files.""(including the Gail Brewer-Giorgio tape of 1988)
""Sorry, but it's NOT Elvis in the unknown file in my opinion.""
""I started with 8 known Elvis files - named interview and interview 1, 2, etc up to 7.""
I have one unknown Elvis file.""
""When comparing the unknown to ALL the knowns - the best we get is about a 56% match.""
""When comparing a known to all the other knowns - I get 80% plus match showing it is very likely him - as we know.""
""If I add recordings of my own voice to the list to be tested, I also get about a 55% match of my voice with the unknown Elvis - and I know I'm not Elvis.""
""So, therefore based on the EVB forensics tool, I'd have to say it's NOT him."" END...

4952576,5,B0064NU002,"You might as well know first hand that I do not read comments about my reviews and Amazon knows up front not to notify me of such contacts.  Most of my many reviews are of non controversial items.  So when I review a so called controversial  book I do so from a conservative Christian viewpoint and there are people who love to bash anything conservative or Christian.  It never fails to amaze me how people can give one star reviews bout books and DVDs that have just been released and it is so obvious that the book has not been read and the DVD not  viewed.  Well, I have recommended this DVD in a mass emailing and on Facebook.  So haters out there may wish to skip this review.  Those with no set opinions are invited to read on whether they agree or disagree.  I recommend this DVD for the very simple reason I gave in the subject title, there is definitely a message here.

The very brilliant  actress Celeste Yarnall  put me on to this DVD admitting it is a ""Mockumentary.""  Yes, that is the right word.  It is a documentary titled ""Elvis Found Alive"" and it is so well done that for a bit I was very close to believing Elvis is alive. I must state that I am not a conspiracy buff.  The DVD is well done in covering the life of Elvis Presley, but after an hour of enthralling information from 1935 to 1977 there is evidence shown that his death was faked and he has been in witness protection off and on while working for the DEA.  The information about Elvis's early life comes from well documented films and the very words he has said himself.  The narrator is the supposed Elvis, however he is so good you want to believe.

The purpose of this DVD is not to promote that the king is still alive.  There is TV news coverage of the turbulent sixties and seventies and the rise of Bill Ayers.  The true evil Elvis works against.  The purpose by the end of the film is showing Bill Ayers as the puppet master behind Barack Hussein Obama and a plan to destroy America. There is so much information that this retired history/government teacher and observer knows, from his own research over the years, is very true about what is going on today.  I would recommend this film primarily to introduce viewers to what may be the hidden purpose of it.  To reveal what we are faced with today and why President Obama must be voted out of office.  The rightful concerns that honest people have about Bill Ayers and the Chicago Mafia, concerns over the Obama desire to turn us into a socialist/communist nation.  This is too true and too real.

This DVD is not a scam.  It is a real look at the Elvis we once knew, who Celeste Yarnall knew very well, and concerns he had about the direction our country was going in as early as the late sixties and through the seventies.  The king is not dead in spirit and we do honor to his memory  to heed the things that he saw we were losing in America.  The election in November is a contest that will save or lose the soul of the United States.  Ah, I can hear the cries of outrage from the liberal socialist haters now and actually I am not bothered.  Even if less than one percent of them is made to think by this DVD, then it will have been well worth it.

God bless the memory of Elvis Presley, those who put this DVD  together and the USA.",1327708800,9,3281,4.2727272727272725
