5047238,5,B0071BY1YC,"This movie holds me in rapt attention, and I have watched it 3 times now.  My 33-year-old daughter loved it.  Two of her comments remain with me:  She felt like she was watching an alternate reality, and Belafonte is such a gorgeous man, even at 80 years old.

Watching other movies, with old footage of Birmingham, Selma and Little Rock gives a certain view of what the 1960's were like, but watching this beautiful man live through those times, day-to-day, gives the viewer a sense of what it was like to live a courageous life under segregated conditions.

Finally, how many of us knew what a key player Belafonte was and still is, in the the Civil Rights movement all over the world, bringing cash and star power to the movement, not just his own star power, but Marlon Brando, Tony Curtis, Paul Newman, Tony Bennet, and on and on ...

If you are interested in the Civil Rights movement of yesterday, today, and TOMORROW, or if you just love calypso music sung by a honey-voiced, magnetic personality, you won't be disappointed in this movie.",1329696000,25,1046,4.627027027027027

This is a well-made documentary that only made me admire him more than I already did. He was and continues to be a great inspiration to me and without question, this film should be seen as widely as possible. It illuminates a very important part of our nation's history and struggle to come to grips with our ongoing pursuit of racial equality.

I lived during the days Harry Belafonts was contributing to the great issues of his life and times.  He is a joy to watch singing and telling the stories.

5047262,5,B0071BY1YC,"Wonderful documentary film on one of Hollywood's woefully underrated stage and screen legends,Harry Belafonte.

5047263,4,B0071BY1YC,"Considering Harry Belafonte's contributions to America's civil rights movement as depicted in the 2011 documentary SING YOUR SONG, you can understand the dismay he expresses in its closing scenes.  As I write this in 2013, today in the United States a young black man in President Obama's hometown of Chicago has a better chance of going to jail than he does attending college.  Belafonte wonders aloud, after all that was fought for, how is it that life for most blacks in the United States is even worse than it was in the day of Jim Crow laws?

Maybe Belafonte feels saddened but if you have any sense of decency, SING YOUR SONG will make you feel worse for not taking your share of the responsibility you have as an American citizen.  If you want to argue that Harry Belafonte could do more since he was famous, okay.  I, for one, wonder how many singing and acting jobs Belafonte didn't get because he marched during the years where support for civil rights was far from popular.  Damn, a man that talented and handsome could have been content to take the money and the women, and at the end of the day lock the door.  But he chooses to do more, and for justice.

In America today, a five-year old black school girl gets handcuffed by the authorities.  Harry Belafonte, musing that and many other modern acts of injustice against the underprivileged, asks, ""What do we do now?""  That question is the answer.  A lesser individual would, instead of asking that, give up.

See SING YOUR SONG.",1370131200,,1494,4.59622641509434

5047266,5,B0071BY1YC,"We love Belafonte's music.  The movie provides a real insight into his life.  We had no idea, what a mover and shaker he was in the area of Civil Rights.",1364169600,,153,4.066666666666666
5047267,5,B0071BY1YC,Harry Belafonte was not an unknown entertainer/activist to me when I viewed this video.  I must admit that I learned so much.  What professionalism and character he has displayed over many decades.  If you want to see a civil rights video OR classic Harry songs this is the video for you.,1363564800,,288,4.607843137254902

5047270,4,B0071BY1YC,"The Bible has a book of Ezra which warns people that they are going to live in an unclean land with unclean people who have abominations, and ""with their abominations they have filled it from one end to another with their impurities."" (Ezra 9:11). Like September 11, 2001, an Ezra master class of southern television station owners were just waiting for Harry to try to take a piss around an Alabama State Trooper. The Tom, Dick and Harry segment of the Smothers Brothers Comedy hour was replaced by a paid political commercial for Nixon when the network was deciding it had to fire the Smothers Brothers. When the FBI talked to Harry Belafonte's wife, it was like a storm in the book of Ezra in which the message was:

do not give your daughters as wives for their sons,
nor take their daughters to your sons,
and never seek their peace or prosperity,
that you may be strong and eat the good of the land,
and leave it as an inheritance to your children forever. (Ezra 9:12).

The Bill of Rights that was adopted with the Constitution of the United States of America was like the Hitler-Stalin Pact in the twentieth century, setting limits on what governments were supposed to do. When the FBI takes action on the Bill of Rights, it resembles the Nazi Germany abrogation of the Hitler-Stalin Pact. William Kunstler is shown on this DVD at a trial (Wounded Knee, 1973) in which the federal judge was aware the FBI was not at all truthful. When Zorro was arrested, he was sentenced to the chain gang.

I own Harry Belafonte records from 1956 and 1984 and was expecting to hear a song about Matilda. Instead, the information about Island in the Sun and the battle for social acceptance reminded me of when I was in Vietnam and if I thought I was going to have my own personal slave, I was considered white and prejudiced. I was highly conflicted about the white man being the devil.",1359936000,,1879,4.536873156342183
5047271,5,B0071BY1YC,"I am baffled by those reviewers who expect Harry Belafonte to sing and samba here.  They have been out-of-touch with the post-recording celebrity who has always been a champion of human rights, not merely the rights of people of color. I know very few human beings of any background, or bearing any title, who have given to social justice what Belafonte has over his lifetime.

This documentary is filled with jolts, shocks of recognition about the subject they thought they knew.  Indeed, Belafonte has been entrenched in human rights battles from Mississippi to Ethiopia to South Africa.  His musical victories, all hard-won, were the engine with which he was able to ""work"" his causes.  Today, at the start of African American History Month 2013, it would not be extreme to say that Harry was a pivotal member of the movement, or that he was so drawn to help that he left his family behind once too often. Those who survive him largely understand; but there have been few notables who have given their lives to a cause without impacting their family bonds.

What this fast-paced, beautifully edited documentary emphasizes is the integrity of the individual as an artist, a political partner, and to the extent possible -- a father and marital partner.  Certainly there is enough of Belafonte's music here to satisfy its fans, but the revelations of his relationships, both personal and political, make one sit up, open-mouthed and wonder hw one human could have achieved and known so much.

Personally, I believe it. I saw Belafonte perform once. I followed news releases about his activities over the years. I had not known how insidious the FBI's pursuit of Belafonte became, nor the tenacity with which he canceled lucrative media contracts that were patently racist.

This, then, is a great man, now 81 years of age, who has given his world many times more than it has delivered to him.  Indeed, were we to conduct a random survey of Americans to ask if they had every HEARD of Harry Belafonte, I have little doubt, two-thirds would say ""no.""  It's that sad. But the conclusion of the film is not.

""What will we do?"" he asks before the credits roll and the familiar strains of ""Day-o"" begin.  We have many of the statutes but not the teeth to ensure full equality. Many of us have the will, but too many Americans still hate those who are different. If there is any concordance between Belafonte's music and politics, it is simple.  As a father and patron of world music, he was one who saw music as a universal language. In turn, those who share a common language, and comprehend its message, should never hate one another.

A brilliant, inspiring documentary with interview and music extras that are more than generous.

Five stars and then some.",1359763200,2,2756,4.782700421940929

Then in mid-1959, Harry released his gran'daddy of all ""live"" albums: ""Belafonte At Carnegie Hall"" which happens to be the best live
recording ever made !!! It truly is the best concert album I ever heard, and I don't believe Harry Belafonte ever sounded better.
In this particular DVD: ""Sing Your Song"", Harry Belafonte shows who he is and what he stands for. Yes, sing your song so people will
know who you are. And Harry Belafonte is absolutely a star....in every sense of the word. What a fantastic human being. Aside from
his singing and performing talents, Mr. Belafonte shows how much he cares about the world we live in. I loved this documentary and it
is something I could watch over and over again !!! I only have one complaint. In the ""Special Features"" category, Harry Belafonte only
performs 2 songs in their entirety: ""Hava Nagela"" + ""Little Liza Jane"". I would have loved to see a whole lot more;  for example:
""Darlin Cora"" + ""Scarlet Ribbons"" + ""Jamaica Farewell"" + ""Day-O"" + ""Mama Look A Boo Boo"" ~> so yes, I was kinda disappointed about
that. After all, Harry Belafonte is above all, an entertainer and a legendary talented performer. I would have loved to see him sing his
