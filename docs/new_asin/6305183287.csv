976970,5,6305183287,"One of Bill Cosby's first mainstream films and a hoot a minute.  The real star is supposed to Elliot Gould and he is indeed great as Max Devlin, a not so nice chappie who is hit by a bus and finds that he has gone to hell and hell is not a very nice place...In order to stay out of the infernal flames the Devil gives him a second chance, go back to earth and persuade three innocent people to sell their souls to the Devil.  Max is all for it at first and to make sure he completes his task he is accompanied back to the land of the living by one of the Devil's helpers, played to perfection by Bill Cosby.  The film isn't what you would call a mover and shaker when it comes to the storyline, the plot and the characters, but it fun and it will make you laugh.  Max soon finds that he has gained a conscience as he tries to persuade his three victims to sign over their souls and he falls in love with the mother of his young victim played admirably by Adam Rich.  Add to this a wonderful soundtrack, the song, ""Roses and Rainbows,"" sung by Julie Budd is a cracker and you have a film that will have you chortling and crying in the same breath.  Cosby is delicious as the Devil's helper who isn't really as bad as he tries to make out, and he certainly proves that he is a hell of an actor (ouch that pun hurt!) in this gloriously funny and poignant film about, man, the devil and the human heart.",983923200,22,1399,4.050724637681159

977192,4,6305183287,"I had not seen this film since it was released.  I enjoyed it back then, and today, even though the clothes, hair styles and music date it, the film is still good and worth watching on a couple of levels.  First, it stands on its own as a good film, with a solid story and good performances, especially by Gould and Cosby.  Julie Budd's singing is an added treat.  Second, this appears to be one of the first films that the Disney studios produced to try to break from their traditional mold.  I think Executive Producer Ron Miller was on the right track here.  Sadly, the Board of Directors did not give him many more years to turn the studio around, but this film is a good example of what he may have continued to do.",1441929600,,720,4.257352941176471

977262,2,6305183287,"Elliott Gould (as Max Devlin, a shiftless landlord) is literally thrown under a bus, dies, and is transported to hell.  ""I'm having a bad dream.""  Not exactly, but you are stuck in a bad movie.  In order to keep from being a permanent resident of Hell, on level 4, he has to consign the souls of three kids (two teenagers and a seven year old boy) to the devil (Bill Cosby).  Max does exactly that, through various means of trickery and deceit, even marrying the mother of the boy he's trying to send to hell.  How any of this can be misconstrued as a comedy is anyone's guess.  Worse.  It's even purported to be a romance, although how romantic can it be if you're only after a woman for her son's soul?
Not terribly inspired, with few if any laughs.  Cosby smirks, Gould looks rumpled (and so is his performance).  At least Julie Budd gets to sing one great song to close out the movie (this is the only bright spot in an otherwise tedious affair).
It should be noted that this is one of three films that forced Walt Disney Productions to form Touchstone Pictures just to handle the less than `Disney' approved movies (this is supposedly the first Disney film to contain profanity).",1378944000,,1184,4.469767441860465

977264,3,6305183287,"It's kind of a bad movie, but it's enjoyable through the two leads. Elliot Gould is perhaps too likeable from the start to be a hell-bourne protagonist, but he's actually endearing. He has the best scenes in his career, honestly. As the Devil, Bill Cosby is subtle, smooth, and very less-is-more. A very effective Devil, and at times funny. The scene that takes place in hell is visually striking and effective.

The problems I have with the movie start with the introduction of the kids that Max corrupts. The actors playing the family that Max marries into are terrible. They appear to be completely medicated for cold and flu symptoms. I'm not joking. They were both clearly sick and drowsy throughout the film. Julie Budd, in her only film role, looking kinda like Barbara Striessand, is effective. But I CANNOT STAND that song she sings. Her breakout song is Nobody's Fool by the late Marvin Hamlisch. God, do I hate this song. And she sings it four, maybe five times in this movie. A very seventies era ballad, with awful song is cloying, annoying, dated, sappy, and overplayed.

There's perhaps a lot I can complain about, like the dated photography style, some plotholes and such. But overall watchable. I don't think it works as a comedy, but Cosby is menacing and low-key, the story is kinda Twilight Zone-ish, and Gould is so likeable that this movie is worth the watch.",1361577600,,1381,4.75

As flawed and as dated as this film is (its almost 27 years old), it still holds up as a family film.

No one has another opportunity to escape Hell once his choices in life have placed him there.  The movie indicated Hell isn't permanent, but it is.  It's terribly sad, but true.  I would not recommend the movie or the wrong choices in life to anybody.  I wish it had offered some sort of Gospel message, such as choosing God or the Devil in life, but it really didn't.  Maybe saying Jesus loves all sinners was too strong for the purpose of the movie, but Jesus IS THE WAY never to have to suffer Eternity in Hell.",1469491200,,634,4.198347107438017

If Max can get three innocent youth to sign over their souls to the Devil, he'll get to live again. Max attacks the quest with vigor as he wants to live and he doesn't care about what happens to others. Then he starts caring about his three goals and eventually defies the Devil thus eliminating his escape from eternal torment; or does he? Not a religious movie but does acknowledge someone good ""up there"". Great some at the end by Julie Budd worth watching the whole movie for.
