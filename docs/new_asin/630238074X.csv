456479,5,630238074X,"This movie is a rare and exceptional film.  Besides being an excellent actor, Sean Penn has proven himself to be an exceptional director.  He and Kiefer Sutherland  both hold promise for unique films in the future.
Penn's cast demonstrates his eclectic choice in talented actors. Of all of Morse's films seen by me this is his best role.
The part for Viggo Mortensen was perfect.  I always see any and everything done by Mortensen and Penn.",1005955200,10,440,4.75
456480,5,630238074X,"I once heard Sean Penn's film referred to as ""Method movies,"" and I can't think of any better description.  Though having only released (as of this writing) three films, Penn has created a style that is as distinct and indentifiable as his own idiosyncratic performances as an actor.  Penn's films take place in a gray area that is rarely visited by Hollywood films today -- a rather grim place where the action moves slowly and where the images are rarely happy but somehow remain impossible to look away from.  These aren't the type of films that make money or draw huge weekend crowds but they are the films that people will still be watching decades from now.  The first of these films was the flawed but still compelling Indian Runner, which tells the tragic story of Viggo Mortensen, an unstable vet who returns home and, despite the best efforts of his peace-maker brother David Morse, continues to spin out of control.
Obviously, this is not a happy film but it is still surprisingly touching and that's largely because of the cast -- the majority of whom have never been better and for that, I give full credit to director Penn.  While its obvious, at times, that he still has a bit to learn about pacing, it is also obvious that Penn knows how to get great performances out of his actors.  Mortensen, playing a role that could have easily become a flat villian, is quite simply amazing.  Even as it becomes clear that this is not someone you'd feel safe living next to, the viewer still can't help but feel an amazing empathy for this fractured human being.  Penn, as director and writer, is actually willing to take the time to allow Mortensen to become a real, flawed human being.  David Morse, always underrated, is much more low-key than Mortensen but no less compelling.  He makes his love for his brother both believable and real and it adds a truly tragic air to his efforts to protect Mortensen.  However, for me, the film's most shocking revelation is Charles Bronson, cast here as Mortensen and Morse's father.  After several decades worth of films where Bronson was basically a blank slate, Bronson is a revelation here.  As the father, Bronson becomes a tragic, haunting father and -- and here's the shocking part for those of us who have seen the Death Wish films -- is actually believably human and vulnerable. His final emotional scene is heart breaking -- largely because of Bronson's own performance.
As I said before, this is a flawed film -- mostly in terms of pace.  Sometimes, Penn does seem to be insecure about his directorial and writing choices -- as if he's straining to make sure no one misses the point.  But these flaws are honestly just nitpicking.  I give this film five stars because it heralded the arrival of Sean Penn as an important director and it featured some of the best acting I have ever seen in my life.",1004313600,73,2856,4.648111332007952
456481,5,630238074X,"This is one of the best movies I have seen in a very long time, and also one of the hardest to put back on the shelf and forget after viewing.  The truest thing that I could say about this film is that it felt real.  It looked real, felt real, and stirred up genuine emotions in me that few movies ever have.  David Morse and Viggo Mortensen were perfect choices to play the brothers, and the rest of the cast were like little jewels thrown into the mix.  Also, the music in the film was memorable.  Would like to see a soundtrack available.  I highly recommend this film to anyone who is a fan of quality performance and story.  It is worth a look......",1003708800,9,654,4.184
456482,5,630238074X,"One of the finest fims of the 1990s, The Indian Runner serves as a powerful reminder of our powerlessness to change the people we love.  Though the picture is unblinking in its showcase of human weakness, the film has an overwhelming compassion for the wounded souls it presents.
Viggo Mortenson breaks my heart every time I watch his character, Frankie Roberts, in his brother Joe's car--the night after his violent binge.  Frankie's final monologue, a drunken, self-righteous ramble about elementary school math class and the tooth fairy (among other things), is extraordinarily strange and comprehensible.  Throughout the film, Mortenson dares his brother and his wife to love him, as he spews abuse (and peas) in their faces.  Not only do they continue to love this pitiful monster, but we do, too.  In a perfect world, Mortenson and David Morse would have shared the Best Actor Oscar in 1991 (Anthony Hopkins can win any year he wants to) and Sean Penn would have won Best Director and Best Screenplay.
Jack Nitchze's soundtrack and the late-'60s--early '70s song selections perfectly complement the tone of this masterpiece.  Midway through the film, Penn and his editor Jay Cassidy give us a scene that astonishes in its bold craftsmanship and beauty.  This scene includes David Morse, Patricia Arquette, Viggo  Mortenson, Charles Bronson, and some poor schmoe at his Hawaiian-style birthday party (L.M. Kit Carson, I think)--living out their lives in different parts of the Midwest over the course of one night while a singer croons over the soundtrack.  One of them will soon kill himself; another goes on a crime spree; one loses his sportscar; another waits by the phone.  This is maverick filmmaking, and it leaves you breathless!  The scene is played without dialogue, but you still learn so much about the characters through their facial expressions and reactions.
If Sean Penn had never made another movie, he would deserve to be named among the top 10 directors of the '90s for the 127 minutes of no-compromise-storytelling he demonstrates in The Indian Runner.  I will never miss another one of his films.",984873600,34,2122,5.066091954022989

I have viewed it a few times since & in those viewings I see a great deal of depth to this movie - from the 2 sons who are complete opposites & the way they each view the other, how each deals with the loss of their parents & then, how each one deals with, or cannot deal with their own life....

in one scene, the look on Mortensen's characters eyes, go from happy to downright frightening - for that reason alone I rank this as one of his finest performances....when you see that scene, I'll bet you agree!

Frank (Mortenson) is a returning Vietnam vet, who was in trouble well before he went to war.  The first thing that happens when he comes back is he robs Joe's wallet of $40, goes elsewhere and lands in jail for striking his girlfriend (Arquette).

When Joe invites Frank back to live with them, it's a recipe for disaster.  This is a bleak, very real drama.  It's well-acted on everyone's part, but a bit slow.  Definitely an interesting period piece and character study.  ""Indian Runner"" proves Sean Penn can direct as well as act.

456711,5,630238074X,"It is a marvelous film for many reasons and it has many meaningful interpretations. The first we can think of is of course the effect of the Vietnam War on a normal man. It made him someone whose desire to kill, whose need to kill could never be controlled and dominated. Nothing could keep him within the limits of normalcy, that is to say a violence that is purely symbolical or superficial. His desire was not to punch a few noses and be done with it, but it was to kill, and I repeat that was a need for him to be satisfied in order to survive. The second line is that of the two brothers. One chose to be a cop and he killed legally. That's not in anyway easy, but at least you can come to terms with it: you saved your life from someone who wanted to kill you, and that was legal. You can wonder why he shot to kill, right in the heart, but he was entirely justified to shoot, so why not to kill? The other chose to go to Vietnam and there he killed but it was never to really save his life, never really justified because it was not self defense on his own turf but aggression in a foreign country, and the killing was not exactly shooting at combatants, but more often at women and children. This seems to prove that the desire to kill is in any man, good or bad, and that the only choice you have is to do it legally and morally or not. Vietnam produced twisted, distorted and completely warped personalities for whom killing had become a need, just like alcohol or smoking for others. This leads to a confrontation between the two brothers and the dilemma for the cop who has to arrest or shoot his own brother. He chose differently. The third line is metaphorical. The guilt the cop had built in himself after killing the young chap who was running away and then started to shoot at him can only come out, be retrieved and rehabilitated if in a way or another the need to kill is projected into someone else and that someone else is forced to go away. The guilt has to be entrusted to some Indian runner who will take it away as if it were a message he has to go dump in the ocean or the infinite. But this meaning is metaphorically symbolical of us all. We all have to get rid of this death instinct, and here comes the ending of the film. It is a dream society will let us go without making us pay for that death instinct. And the price is called guilt because we have to repress it and then it will go on lurking in our minds forever. There is no Indian runner for our death instinct, just a repressed guilt that may come out one day, but when and how no one knows.

456712,4,630238074X,"Everyone in this film from Charles bronson to Dennis Hopper turned in a stellar performance . Be prepared for a very dark story however. Viggo Mortensen and David Morse play brothers who took different paths in life and we watch as one is unable to save the other from himself & his demons. Viet Nam is an integral part of Mortensen's disintegration and it ain't pretty. It is very moving however. David Morse, a fine actor, has never been better. There is a full frontal nude shot of Viggo but there's nothing sexy about it. Sean Penn has given us a film that's a lot like him. Intense,deep,brilliant and unsettling.

456713,4,630238074X,"This fine movie probably didn't get as much attention as it merited because of its bleakness and because it represented Penn's earliest work as a director.  It is much like watching the proverbial train wreck: devastating but irresistible.  However, it is worth enduring the pain for at least one viewing, which will leave a lasting impression.  It can be a bit slow in places but is well-written, superbly acted, and beautifully photographed.

Mortensen is absolutely wonderful, both repulsive and heart-breaking as the hopelessly destructive younger of two brothers who have gone separate ways after growing up on a family farm in Wisconsin. After the farm fails and must be sold, the older brother, well-played in an understated performance by David Morse, goes into law enforcement, marries a woman he adores, and forges a contented family life with her and their baby son.  When the younger brother comes back into their midst, fresh from the military and a stint in prison resulting from explosions of his inexplicably violent temperament, the older brother has to determine at what point he stops trying to save his angry sibling from himself.  The entire cast is fine - a young Patricia Arquette as Mortensen's love is deeply touching.  Charles Bronson and Sandy Dennis appear briefly as the brothers' parents.  While the film's story centers on the struggle between the two brothers, the mysterious inexorability of character is its underlying theme.  The narrative and character development stand on their own, however, to suggest the deeper theme.  A sad but memorable film, and kudos to Penn and his cast for making this film - it was obviously a labor of love.",1166659200,4,1673,5.072992700729927
456773,4,630238074X,"I see shades of Viggo's recent movie: A History Of Violence in this movie Sean Penn wrote and directed. This compelling film brought out emotional, heart wrenching scenes that cause the same emotion in the viewer. We see the 'good brother' Joey (David Morse)--a peace officer, trying to help his deeply troubled, Vietnam vet brother Frank (Viggo Mortensen).

 On a personal note: Valeria Golino did a wonderful job in this movie as Joey's amazing, perfect wife.

True to most of Viggo's movies in his pre-Aragorn days, here he is as a self-absorbed, heartless sleaze ball who cares basically for no one but himself. Whether it was the war or his feelings that life itself has played him a cruel hand, Frank cannot come to grips with the impulses and the rage in him. The murder scene and the bar scene both bring to memory: A History Of Violence. In this movie as well, he is more of a victim who victimizes everyone around him. One can almost feel his pain as he weeps over his father's death and later says 'sorry' to his brother for every heartache he has caused in the past. Still, later, one learns to hate him.

I see Joey as this nave man who cannot see the warning signs in those hurting around him, like his father (Charles Bronson) who tries reaching out to Joey and then admits defeat and ends it. Nor can he succeed in helping Frank see the good side of life and all that it has to offer. Frank's poor wife Dorothy (Patricia Arquette) though, took the worst of Frank's sick behavior during his rages and ultimate abandonment of her. It seems that no one can get through to Frank who sees how life has been good to Joey--as he remarks how 'you got a kiss in and a- -, and I got prison.' Well, Frank, what did you expect? Bad boys get prison. Still, in the end it's the good brother who makes the ultimate sacrifice in this intense, gripping film.

456777,4,630238074X,"Viggo Mortensen is outstanding in this character study of brothers reuniting amidst great troubles in their personal lives. Sean Penn wrote and directed this film, his first effort in that respect, and came away with a solid effort that has all the fingerprints of his Academy Award-winning effort ""Mystic River"".

Mortensen plays the ""bad"" brother to ""good"" brother Don Morse in this slice of life set in rural working class America. The film also stars Charles Bronson, who is cast against type as an aging parent, Sandy Dennis and a very young Benicio Del Toro.

It is an unflinching, honest, truthful, gritty and utterly realistic view of a family that is coming apart and simultaneously being held together by the strong grip of the good brother Morse, who is something of a latter day Bobby Ewing cast against bad brother J.R. Ewing in an unstated Midwest locale about 1968.

This movie can move slowly but is also variably gripping, entertaining, revolting and satisfying. It is emotional and carries great depth in the multilayered view of its characters, all of whom mimic real life people far more than in most movies, where the characters are often idiots acting out IQs of 6.

Not in this film, a first time triumph from writer-director Penn. Based on the type of character Penn has portrayed most of his career, I think there must be something of Penn's upbringing in this real world study of people, their interactions, their wanting to do the right thing while being unable to do so, and their sometimes futile efforts to hold on to the good things in life while all around them in crumbling.

The film ends in typical disarray and with an unsentimental message about people, their place in the world, and optimism. This is a very worthy film for people that want to see realism on the big or little screen.

A caveat: This is adult fare and not for children. Watch out for Mortensen's full frontal nude scene about half way through the flick, where he shows off his splendid 1991 physique.",1124841600,16,2005,4.763688760806916

Set in the early 1970s, this is the story of two brothers in a small Midwest town.  David Morse is a police officer.  He's happily married to Valeria Golino and they have a baby.  Viggo Mortensen is cast as the other brother, just home from Vietnam and a real troublemaker.  Patricia Arquette is cast as his girlfriend.  There's a lot of time spent in developing the characters of these two brothers.  Too much time if you ask me.  I didn't need to see scene after scene after scene depicting this.  The story moves slowly and has an inevitable conclusion.  I just couldn't help being bored.

Exactly why it is titled ""The Indian Runner"" is never clear.  We see an opening scene in which an Indian kills a deer.  Before the deer dies, the Indian sucks in some of the deer's dying breath.

I like long moody films that you can settle down into a couch and get absorbed into, and this is one of those. Although, I would say it could have been trimmed down just a bit, as the pace gets just a little too slow in some areas. But overall this is a great movie, with great performances by all, and it packs an after-punch in that you may not really feel how much it has moved you until its over. Im not easily touched by most movies, but this film had tears building up in my eyes ready to roll with the ending credits.  Its without a doubt one of my favorite films. This is the kind of film that reminds you, movies at there best can indeed be considered a work of art.",1110326400,9,1017,3.985294117647059
456780,3,630238074X,"O.K. I admit it.  Curiousity got the best of me.  I had to see Viggo Mortensen's full frontal.  It is what it is.  However, this movie has other merits.  It is a story about family and brotherly love.  It is one brother's struggle to adjust to this world.  I love it when Frank says he's still trying to figure out what happened to Santa Claus.

I think that Sean Penn, the movie's writer/director, should have made a better link to how Vietnam added to Frank's rage and inability to fit in.

I love the parts with the brothers bonding and playing rhyming games.  Frank's brother really tries to help him.

I got a little more than I bargained for with a birth scene.  I also remember thinking gosh, these people smoke a lot!  It is not a bad movie, and it does serve a purpose.  However, I wouldn't want to own it.",1106265600,8,815,4.276315789473684
456781,5,630238074X,"Some movies you'll never forget. They go deep.

This is one of them.

A story about life - how we need to cope with its ups and downs; everybody in his own way. Some make it through, some don't.

A great story with wonderful actors.",1102636800,17,232,4.111111111111111
456782,3,630238074X,"When I saw this DVD I thought it might be good with Penn directing and the cast, but now I can see why I do not recall seeing its trailer at a theatre or on my tv screen....
The dialogue is badly muddled some of the time.....e.g. when Frank and Joe are alone on the porch of their old farm and running around in the corn field......Another instance is when Joe goes to the bar to see why Frank is not at home where his child is being born.
There is also a tendency to leave things hanging.....
I found it a waste of some talented actors e.g. Bronson, Hopper, Denis and others, but admit that it is probably the best thing that Morse has ever done on the big screen...normally he walks thru his roles like a zombie.
I found Mortensen's character, Frank, to be sad and compelling, but the others were fleeting in time and depth.
Finally, are we to believe that after Frank beats the bartender to death, that his brother, a dedicated police officer, just sighs and tells us that he never saw him again? He is of course not aware of the other things he has done before he hit town but this is a problem that does not deserve a slap on the wrist and a sad farewell, no matter if he is his brother or not.
That was the final straw for me.",1088208000,3,1232,4.1375
456813,5,630238074X,"Sean Penn in his opera prima as director was very succesful. He developed an interesting approach about two brothers in a small village.
This movie has a strong influence mythical; two brothers work out as the alpha and omega. The atmosphere is loaded  with reflexive issues.
I saw this film in 1992 and I suspected that this one would be a cult movie and for selected audiences.
Penn made an artistic work with very well depicted characters supprted  with a solid script,filled with sugestive visual methapors.
Vigo Mortenesen revealed himself with this film as a young promise ; Denis Hooper as always, shows his actoral skills once more in a very brief appearance.
Watch this one. A rewarding film.",1085702400,4,701,4.882352941176471
456814,4,630238074X,"Sean Penn`s directorial debut is a strong and absorbing character study that focuses the relationship of two brothers and the (contraditory) choices they made in their lives. David Morse and Viggo Mortensen give superb and utterly credible performances as the two multi-layered and three-dimensional young adults who don`t quite know how to deal with their future. ""The Indian Runner"" is a moving, subtle and poignant drama that wisely showcases the complex and deep connection between brothers, providing plenty of heartfelt and emotional scenes. Penn wisely avoids sappy moments and instead choses a realistic and low-key perspective, developing the story with a well-crafted crescendo of dramatic tension. Those expecting a typical and obvious Hollywood tearjerker won`t like this. The pacing is a bit uneven, since there are a couple of too long sequences at parts, still that doesn`t affect the overall quality of the movie. ""The Indian Runner"" is a mature and compelling cineamtic experience, and it`s unfortunate that it was so overlooked when it came out in the early nineties.
Highly Recommended.",1081209600,7,1105,5.430232558139535
456815,3,630238074X,"This movie is about a deeply disturbed bad guy who has no quams about shooting up a store for a few dollars.  The beginning shows this bad guy as a Vietnam Vet - as if to suggest this is why he went astray.  I find this guy very problematic because he wears a Nazi tatoo on his back and a Christian cross around his neck.  Sure the swell brother tries to save him - but to no avail.  So what is new...??  Very long drawn out scenes.  No crescendo, and no point other that some people are really just bad and weird people.  This movie is definetely not a thriller.  It is definetely not even exciting.

456817,2,630238074X,"I am a big fan of Charles Bronson, David Morse and Viggo Mortensen, so I was hoping for a movie that I could really enjoy.  But I was disappointed; ""The Indian Runner"" is a disjointed, choppy story that left me wishing I knew more about the characters I met.
I never really connected with any of the characters.  And that is a shame, since they hold such promise.  I felt compassion for David Morse's Joe; his balance of trying to do the right thing and trying to do right by the brother he once knew is truly moving.  Charles Bronson brought gravitas and hopeless dignity to the movie as Joe and Frank's father.  And Viggo's portrayal of Frank, a Vietnam vet who brings home scars both old and new, is amazing.  But as much as I wanted to feel for these characters, I never felt engaged.
I don't expect movies to tie everything up in neat little packages, but I do expect to be able to see the progression of a character or the development of a story.  And neither one happens in this film.  There is no plot; but since the story is about the interaction between brothers that is just fine.  However, there is never a moment when I understood what is going on inside of these characters; there is always a distance that can't be swept aside.  Since Sean Penn wrote *and* directed this movie he may have felt that he conveyed more on film than he actually did.  And for the actors to be able to have done their jobs so well, they had to have known more about these characters than was shared onscreen.  I just wish I had been let in on it.
Based on Bruce Springsteen's ""Highway Patrolman"", this is really just a songfic (a story based on the lyrics of a song) that got produced into a movie.  Sean Penn seems to have an eye for what makes a good shot, and he obviously knows how to get great performances from his actors.  Even though I was disappointed with this film, it makes me want to watch ""The Crossing Guard"" to see if he has refined what could ultimately be a quite amazing gift.",1043280000,19,1988,4.309139784946237
456818,5,630238074X,"I just watched it again and I get something a little different out of it every time I watch it. I'd never even heard of it until a friend told me about it a while ago. For me, to even want to watch a movie more than once is a rare event, because alot of movies I've seen are so predictable to me, so fake, so polished, the imperfections sandblasted down to perfectly flawless imperfection, that I rarely ever get drawn in to the story or feel the emotions in a movie. On the flip side of that, I love how each character in the Indian Runner is multi-dimensional and 'real'. It's not just about a 'good' brother vs. 'bad' brother situation. It gets more complicated than that.
I'm still thinking about the part where Joe said to Frank he stills loves him even though now he understands how he thinks about the circumstances surrounding his father.....
Anyway, if you're tired of all those slick movies and you feel like you need something with more substance, something that will work your brain muscles for a bit and make you think...about people, about relationships and love, about family -- then I'd rent or buy this if I were you. I'm going to get back to looking for the soundtrack now, which is how I ended up here in the first place.",1040256000,9,1240,4.395652173913043

456820,4,630238074X,"The Indian Runner is a touching picture about two brothers on different ends of the spectrum. David Morse plays Joe Roberts, the familyman cop with a conscience. Viggo Mortensen (Lord of the Rings - Aragorn) plays Frankie Roberts, the wild badboy brother who can't (and doesn't really want to) stay out of trouble. I rented this movie because I'm a fan of Mortensen and honestly thought he looked hot from pictures I saw from The Indian Runner. His chisseled features alone are enough to steal every scene he's in, but add that to his outstanding acting and your hooked! The one downside to this movie is the unexpected nudity. In one scene it's Viggo, which wasn't so bad. But in another scene they show his wife giving birth to their child, which was shocking and gruesome. Definatly something I didn't want to see!

456821,5,630238074X,"Most people I've known have never seen the Indian Runner.  That is very sad because this is one of the greatest films of all time.  Sean Penn directed this tale of two brothers, one a family man and the other an ex-con who just can't stop getting himself in trouble.  Viggo plays the tattooed and angry Frank, a man on the edge who comes home with his girlfriend played by Patricia Arquette.  This film is a wild ride in their lives and it is a very sad and involving story.  You can't watch the ending without being touched.
This film is about family and brothers.  It shows that sometimes a person can't be saved as is the case with Frank.  David Morse plays the good brother who just wants to help this lost man find his way.  At the end, Frank's vicious outburst and his flight is shown as the brother seeing Frank as the child he had been versus the blood-drenched monster he had become.  During this time, you see Frank's wife giving birth to their child.  Its a very powerful ending to a film.
The Indian Runner is a beautiful and haunting film.  Once you see it, there is something so powerful on the screen that you can't ever forget it.  A masterpiece.",1012003200,17,1162,4.3534883720930235
456822,5,630238074X,"This is a GREAT film.  Period.  Emotionally raw and pyschologically intense, ""Indian Runner"" is a spare but moving tale of family ties and self-destruction.  Viggo Mortensen is, at the same time, blistering and heartbreaking in his role as the damaged yet lovable younger brother destined for tradegy.
His performance is unforgetteable....but O'Brother Where Art Thou today, Viggo???  How is this guy not commanding top roles?
Sean Penn proves incredibly effective in his directorial debut.  I put ""Indian Runner"" in the same class as one of Sean Penn's early acting tour-de-force's, ""At Close Range.""  Both of these movies are critically acclaimed yet generally overlooked cinematic GEMS.  If you enjoy character-driven films without Hollwood glitz and glamour, if you are drawn to authentic existential journeys, this one of the best films you've never seen.
