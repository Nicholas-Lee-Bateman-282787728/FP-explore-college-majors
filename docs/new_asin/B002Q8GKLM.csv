3966357,1,B002Q8GKLM,"I got this for my daughter for Christmas.  I thought this was perfect since she didn't have any of the movies yet & for the price ($42.00 at the time) it seemed the best way to go. These were new dvds, right out of the package.  We all settled in to watch the newest of the six. It skipped, scrambled & then just froze.  We tried cleaning it,  tried using a different dvd player, nothing has worked.  We're going to check the others, but I wanted to write this now to save someone else the same frustration.",1262304000,17,507,4.185567010309279
3966358,1,B002Q8GKLM,"Now I'm rating it 1-star because the box set idea is dumb, I love the movies! But don't get this! I know it's tempting but wait out the 2-3 years for the box set with all EIGHT movies will be in. It'll be a whole lot nicer. They will probebly put it in a collector's box, alot of bonus stuff (figurnes...) ECT. I don't recommend this!",1262044800,8,334,4.075757575757576
3966359,5,B002Q8GKLM,"If you are a Harry Potter fan, then and you enjoyed the regular DVD movies, then you're going to love the blu-ray version.",1260576000,5,122,4.3478260869565215
3966360,1,B002Q8GKLM,"How the heck is it that the Years 1 - 5 Harry Potter collection is only $54.99, yet this collection, with only one more movie (which you can get for $14.99) jumps up to $89.99??? Freakin' RIP-OFF!!!!! I'm totally insulted that amazon & Warner Bros. both think that I can't do simple mathematics!",1260489600,48,295,4.584905660377358
3966361,1,B002Q8GKLM,"Here is why this box set is dumb. In a year, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part I will be in theaters. In a year and a half, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part II will be in theaters. In two years, both will be available on DVD/Blu Ray/digital/whatever might be out in two years. why bother with a box set for a 7 year story that only has the first 6 years? Especially as most fans have probably been buying the previous sets and or the individual movies and thus is even more stupid.",1260316800,13,498,4.144329896907217
3966362,5,B002Q8GKLM,"Certainly the first reviewer is correct.  However, if one bides their time, this set will eventually sell as used and you can purchase it for less than he/she suggests.  Otherwise, an EXCELLENT collection!  I would wait for the final two in three years time when it becomes available as a set, part one and part two.",1260144000,3,316,4.607142857142857
3966363,2,B002Q8GKLM,"UPDATE: The price of Harry Potter Years 1-5 was raised back up to $[...], which is questionable, but means that your best value is this set, Harry Potter Years 1-6. You're getting all six released Harry Potter films at a very low cost, in packaging that is going to save you space on your shelf. A great gift for any Harry Potter fan who doesn't have the films yet, or only has one or two.

Harry Potter Years 1-5 can be purchased for $[...] and Half-Blood Prince can be purchased seperately for $[...]. That's a grand total of $[...] for the same films in this gift set (Years 1-6), except it won't cost you $[...]. That's roughly a $[...] savings if you don't buy this set.",1260057600,82,675,4.357142857142857
3966364,5,B002Q8GKLM,"The packaging on this set is sleek, each film is in a thin plastic case with the traditional cover art for the respective movie. It doesn't take up a ridiculous amount of space on your shelf like some movie sets do! This set makes a great gift for any Potter fan and was a great value. To be clear, these are DVDs NOT Blu-rays. I had no problems with the quality of any of the DVDs, I have watched each one all the way through with no issues! Overall, I am a very happy customer.",1473120000,,479,4.052631578947368

3966375,3,B002Q8GKLM,"Ordered these in October and have been enjoying watching these DVDs.  Unfortunately, I just discovered last night that the Order of the Phoenix disc skips constantly.  Both my husband and I looked at it and couldn't see any scratches or marks, and our DVD player has played several other DVDs in the past few days without a problem, so I'm not sure what the problem is or how to fix it.  So disappointing that Order of the Phoenix is unwatchable due to constant skipping.",1451433600,,471,4.583333333333333

3966386,2,B002Q8GKLM,"I thought it was just a glitch that The Order of the Phoenix disc wouldn't play, so I sent it back and got a replacement. However, the new box set had the same problem. Must be an issue with the manufacturing of that disc.
I love the Harry Potter books and movies though. The poor rating is solely based on the 5th DVD consistently not working.",1433289600,2,344,4.2272727272727275
3966387,5,B002Q8GKLM,"I have read all the Harry Potter series books-- in 1 year. And watched all the movies.
The 1st few movies are adorable, + engaging & fun.  You'll love watching the characters, friends & world of Harry come to life!
Even though the 1st few are endearing, the action stays just as exciting throughout the series ~ *especially the special effects*
You'll become familiar with the characters & the actors who play them, and there are Special Features for each movie, which include interviews with the actors & other fun information.

The 4th(Goblet of fire) was intriguing from the start-- made the World Quiddich Game & underwater challenge come to life!

(the last movie, not included with this, is the best one**)",1429401600,,712,4.819672131147541

This box set merely covers only 6 of the 8 movies. Didn't know there were ""7 years"" of Harry Potter. I guess my bad. The description of this product should make that adamently clear. Not simply say years 1-6. What does that even mean? Bought this as a gift and now I look like a cheap jerk. Especially when the ""full set"" is sellin for cheaper.",1412640000,,484,4.271739130434782

I purchased this set specifically because I have HP and the Deathly Hallows parts 1 and 2 in 3D, but was missing the other movies. I did not really care about having the special features, because I almost never watch any of them, but I was still pleasantly surprised to see that it did include all of them for each movie, as well as an extra disc of features for HP and the Half-Blood Prince. Picked this up for about $25; now I have the entire collection on Blu-Ray, with all of the special features, and was still able to get the last two movies in 3D format, without buying a 7 or 8 movie Blu-Ray set. Personally, I like that it comes in the slim Blu-Ray cases, the entire giftset is about as thick as 3 or 4 DVDs or regular Blu-Ray cases, so this doesn't take up a bunch of space. I would highly recommend.",1342310400,,907,4.218390804597701

3966475,3,B002Q8GKLM,"I am a big fan of Harry Potter so I was very excited to buy this set for Christmas. However, overall this set could have been a  lot better. First of all, it is lacking in special features. Not that it doesn't have any, it does, but it certainly doesn't have a lot. I was especially disappointed at the lack of deleted scenes, which I often consider to be one of the best special features a movie can have. Second, one of the movies glitched when I tried to watch it. I was able to make it work by fast forwarding and then rewinding but it was rather annoying. So, while this set was a nice way to get all the movies together (minus the final one of course) it was lacking in quality.",1316736000,,684,4.104477611940299

I decided to watch them on TV one HP weekend and was instantly hooked on Potter. These movies are not just for kids but for us big kids as well. Goblet of Fire was my favorite until I saw The Dealthy Hallows. (Now I know what all the fuss is about at the theaters!!)
I then decided to buy the movies and went straight to Amazon and was totaly impressed that they had a boxed set in the full screen version. I ordered them and got them within a few days and have watched them several times since they arrived. I was very pleased with the quality and have not noticed any of the negative comments in the other reviews I have read. I hope they come out with the full screen version in TDH part 1 & 2!!!

3966482,5,B002Q8GKLM,"This review concerns itself mostly with the format of the movies themselves. If you want a comparison of the books to the films, or a critique of the films on their own merits, you'd do a better job finding another review or going to a different website.

The first five discs in this set autoplay. Personally, I love this feature and its the reason I'm giving this 5 stars. There are no previews for other movies, the main menu doesn't initially come up. Other than the annoying anti-piracy warning, these movies do everything I'd want in a set (get straight to a film).

Unfortunately the 6th disc doesn't do this. It does have previews, and it does have a main menu.

I have not checked my movies for special features. To be quite frank, I don't care about these; they wouldn't have played a part in my ranking anyway. The sixth disc's case contains another bluray. I haven't checked it out, but that is why they call this a ""seven-disc set"".",1311811200,,945,4.514619883040936

If there were it's obviously not very noticeable because I've seen them all before and didn't catch anything out of the ordinary. Maybe the die-hard Potter fans can only notice them, I don't know.

But in short, if you enjoyed the movies, this is a great addition to your movie rack.

I have to say it is not a HUGE difference in the overall film experience, but it IS a definite improvement.  I think the small details are clearer and the color is more vivid, however after the first film the series gets considerably 'darker' as it goes; both figuratively and literally, so how much that matters is up to the individual.
