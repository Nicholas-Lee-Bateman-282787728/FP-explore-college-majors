As I'm sure I still have given the right score, as I know already I'll LOVE this tape, I've rated it on forehand, as I don't want to influence the high score of others in a negative way.
The ONLY reason I did not see this tape is this; As I've got a DVD player, I refuse to buy VHS tapes any longer.
I hereby kindly request to issue this tape on DVD as well (with an index on the different cats if possible).
I really am AMAZED by the lack of DVD's of this kind, as there are several VHS tapes for many years now. With so many DVD players sold, and so many cat-lovers in the world....
You don't have to be brilliant in marketing to see that this is an unexploited goldmine!

I sure hope there are many others who think this way, and, like me, SCREAM IT OUT!

There's lots of info about different kinds of cats, which makes it a good learning experience for our son. We really like it.",1032652800,4,268,4.0754716981132075
8324721,5,B00005V3VW,"When it came time to add some fur to our family we knew that we wanted a purebred kitten. We had been to a cat show to find the type of cat that would fit in with us, but we came home more confused than ever. A freind of ours told us about this video. We sat down with the kids to watch and had a great time.  we really enjoyed the presentation and the pace of the video.  A lot of information was given on the cats as we laughed to the kittens romping.  From the tape we were able to get a much better idea of the kittens for us. We choose the Persian.  The kids still love to watch the video which is much better for them than the junk on TV anyway!",1022889600,4,651,3.764705882352941
8324722,5,B00005V3VW,Nothing's cuter than kittens playing and these are sweet. Lots of breeds I hadn't heard of with information about them I never knew. My daughter especially loved watching them play and danced herself to the perky music. I loved learning more about different kinds of kitties and watching them wrestle and play. Really enjoyable - great tape for anyone who loves cats.,1010016000,5,367,4.935483870967742
