173441,5,0967801206,"This director and these actors do a fantastic job in perhaps the most difficult genre ever created.  Their ability to bring realism and credibility to a world usually portrayed in film by those who have no real  education or insight is quite refreshing. Also, the director uses  spectacular set, costume, and lighting to give the film a touch of unique  mystical flavor.
Admittedly, This film, as with all others is this  genre, requires an ability to follow the language of Shakespeare. For those  who can get into it, finally they can enjoy brilliant acting with realistic  delivery that not only breaks but utterly shatters the old conventions of  Shakespeare interpretation and over-the-top displays of ""artsy"" excess that  I, for one, have grown tired of.  As for the story this is the truest  adaptation of Shakespeare's wildest horror play to film ever developed---  with all of the violence, revenge, and treachery of the original to do  justice to the true meaning, vision, and purpose of the story.
Whether you measure in stars, thumbs, or diamonds it's clear this films  ranks at the top of its class, and a bargain for such a specialty.",951782400,7,1148,4.911458333333333
173442,5,0967801206,"I just read a bad review here of a film that I think is awesome.  I think, like with most Shakespeare, some people just can't ""get"" it.  I watch this movie over and over again, because the combination of EXCELLENT  acting and whacky gory stuff makes this something really unique and fun.  The actor who plays Titus is better than any of the big stars I've seen  recently, and Tamora and Aaron are just as good.  I wish I could give this  a hundred stars!",950054400,,454,4.270588235294118
173443,1,0967801206,"This video is too bad to even rate a ""campy"" label.  The director could have picked 20 people at random off the streets and gotten more intelligible performances.  It isn't the gore and violence that is the  problem; it's the fact that the actors don't understand their lines, making  it impossible for the viewer to do so.
Don't waste your time and money  on this.",949968000,6,365,4.553846153846154
173444,5,0967801206,"This is the way TITUS ANDRONICUS was meant to be seen, a full-bodied horror show with off-the-wall humor and gritty violence.  Bravo to the cast and crew of this ballsy independent movie for showing people you don't need  millions of dollars to do the Bard justice.",948412800,6,265,4.739130434782608
173445,4,0967801206,"I saw this in Spain last spring, and I ordered the video elsewhere on the net.  From what I remember, it was intense.  People are burned, skinned, hacked at, crushed, beaten and eaten within a story of intrigues and hate.  Half the people I saw it with were hooting when anyone got  ""whacked"", especially when in an unusual way. There's alot of  insight here about how people behave.  Definitely worth a look.",947635200,,409,4.611111111111111
173446,5,0967801206,"Alot of Shakespeare movies are hard to follow, if you are unfamiliar with the language and the style. While that may be true of this one too (to a lesser degree than usual), the difference entertainment-wise is that every  so often a key character gets splattered dead, dead, dead in a colorful  way. It's a hybrid between the look of a play and the look of a film, and  every time I watch it I pick up more and more.  If you're a horror fan,  it's interesting because it's different from typical horror-- and if you're  a Shakespeare fan, it's interesting because it's very, very different from  typical Shakespeare.  It's a bizarre stand-alone kind of cult movie and I  love it. Aaron is awesome.",947635200,3,698,4.564516129032258
173447,5,0967801206,"What an amazing ride! After a few minutes of getting used to the Shakespearean dialog, the story is a rollercoaster of blood, revenge, death, rape, and mayhem, all served up with the wit and word games of the greatest playwright of all time. Although this may not be for everyone, if  you're into slightly off-beat horror with a few shocking turns and some  ridiculously funny moments thrown in, then this is the film for you. It  also stays true to the original text and action so it's a great  reference/companion to the Bard's play. All in all it's a strong entry in  the genre; even better considering how few studios have been willing to  tackle the material as it is, instead of mangling it trying to  ""interpret"" and ""modernize"" it (they always mess it  up). I didn't recognize any big name stars in it, but there's certainly  quite a collection of characters here and a few stand-out performances -  namely the Goth queen Tamora (played by Candy K. Sweet), both her lovers  Saturninus and Aaron (Christopher Dunne and Lexton Raleigh, respectively),  Lucius (Alexander Chew), and Demetrius (Tom Dennis). Check out their web  page too for some relly kewl photos, info, and way freaky stuff.
A GREAT video!",947289600,10,1211,4.792270531400966
7794049,1,0967801206,"Titus Andronicus, 1999, Dir. Christopher Dunne. Robert Reese, Candy K. Sweet.

Our college has one of the most extensive collections of Shakespeare on video in our area.  As one of the professors in charge of the collection, I have watched them all from beginning to end, including this one.

This should be placed in a list of straight Shakespeare's plays because it IS the original script.  It is not an adaptation.  However, this is not only the worst Shakespeare production ever seen, it may be one of the worst films since Ed Wood's Plan 9 from Outer Space.  It has overly gross blood and guts, stupid sound effects, terrible music, cardboard sets, ridiculous costumes and the dumbest acting ever seen.  Most of you won't watch more than the first five minutes.  It looks like amateur night at the fraternity house.  It's so bad, it's hilarious!  What makes it pathetic is that the actors seem to be trying to play it straight.  I'm sorry we ordered it but we will keep it in the collection for comparison.  You win some and you lose some.

Those who gave this film good reviews must have been in the cast.",1147219200,4,1111,4.607142857142857
7794050,3,0967801206,"By interesting I mean the reviews, not the movie.  I am teaching a Shakespeare class at a local high school in NC and was doing a little research when I came across this video.  Before I purchased the thing, I wanted to read what others said.  I find it interesting that most of the positive reviewers live in Florida, where I believe the movie was made.  My class' focus is on Shakespeare as performance.  I have used other ""bad"" adaptations in class and found them most effective. Students actually enjoy watching AND criticizing a bad movie.  It leads to quite a bit of discussion on changes and what Shakespeare may have had in mind. I might do the same with this.  I personally find the blood and guts attractive.  My class of eighteen--most of them are pretty ""cool"" kids--might throw up.  Still debating...and thanks for the reviews.  I still don't know whether to trust the Florida reviewers.",1098921600,,900,4.67515923566879
7794051,5,0967801206,"The people talking trash on this have some axe to grind, or just haven't seen it.  This movie is the crazyest thing I've seen in along time.  Its a better telling of the play that the hollywood turkey, and yet its also filled with cult-movie insane violence.
I won't give away spoilers, but theres a stomping scene thats worth the cost alone, and each death is a grisly classic.  Its really something to watch over and over, and then go out and beat the heck out of someone (just kidding). Eggheads and snobs may not go for it. FIVE STARS ALL THE WAY!!!",1049760000,2,553,4.349514563106796
7794052,1,0967801206,"This video is completely laughable.  The cheesy sound effects, the horrendous acting (not only can they not speak with any sense of Shakespearean meter, but they pause--I mean, PAUSE--between each other's sentences to wait for the next person to finish--it's just laughable), and the title character does not impress me as the ""mighty"" general Titus.  Instead, he reminded me of the 7th grade teacher I had for history who everyone used to pick on because of his stature!  I'm sorry about this.  I have never written such a horrible review for something on Amazon before, but trust me, do not, Do Not, DOOOO NOOOTTTT waste your money on this video.  PLEASE, FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, DO NOT!!!",1024099200,4,688,4.796610169491525
7794053,1,0967801206,"The main object of any acting is to persuade the audience that you understand what you're saying and why - thus one becomes the character. The actors in this show have missed that boat by a mile - seem, often, not even to be trying to communicate the sense of what they have to say, and seem not at all embarrassed to be doing nothing but mouthing lines they don't understand. And so whatever may be the purpose of this extravaganza - spoof, horror, just a bit of fun, or whatever (it certainly can't be to ""do"" Shakespeare, either seriously or satirically) - it is doomed to failure because its actors simply fail to tell its story. So the chintzy effects and amateurish ""music"" may be a bit of a lark, but the general dishonesty of the production values and the worse than amateurish acting leave this one at a spiritual and aesthetic level somewhere below that of ""I Spit on Your Grave"".",974419200,11,890,4.466257668711656
7794054,5,0967801206,"There have been a few bad reviews showing up here that are way way off the mark.  I can understand if someone doesn't like something, but the cheap shot generic jibes prove these people haven't even been watching it, let  alone ""getting it"".  One guy suggested the producers themselves  prompted good reviews (absurd) and another guy talks about a  ""kneck"" brace, whatever that is.  In fact, I ""got"" this  wild cult film and I wasn't going to write BECAUSE I personally know  someone involved in the production.  Then I found out a disgruntled  ex-employee of the company was going to post bad comments, and gee, check  out the mentality of the naysayers!  So, to be up front, you must consider  my potential bias: I know someone who worked on it.  Big deal.  I  understood this film just fine.  The acting, although uneven (what movie  isn't) is better than most of what I've seen from PBS or BBC produced  Shakespeare.  The effects are fine, and some are startling and so way out  you laugh at the strangeness.  This film is qualitatively competitive with  any low-budget film, and a great comparison to the big budget hollywood  picture (that's weak) on the same subject. I LOVE IT.  YES, I LOVE I!  It's  not for everyone, but for cult movie fans, it is well worth having.  Shakespeare would be proud.  Some of the actors, Titus, Aaron, Tamora,  Chiron and Demetrius in particular, are brilliant.  I LOVE IT!",954633600,7,1412,4.68724279835391
7794055,1,0967801206,"Oh the pain...oh the remorse...oh what a disgrace.  This movie is not a good cult classic, or is it acceptable as a high school play.  If you will note a white glimmer in the actor's eyes you will understand that they were  reading their lines rather than acting them.  I believe this the total  budget must have been $5.00.  Please Mr. Shakspeare forgive them for they  no not what they do.",954288000,3,391,4.422535211267606
7794056,5,0967801206,"This movie is nutty and deep, and shallow and profound, and oddball and fantastic!  Even though this is a strange and bloody horror movie, it also has a great story that presents violence responsibly as the substance of  the plot.  The sets and costuming are original and well designed.  The  effects work very well with the dramatic build-up to each turn of the  story.  Tamora is a great woman's role, and the actress does her character  justice, and then some!  I got this tape at a novelty shop in New Orleans  just before Mardis Gras with some souvenirs, and it's my favorite  off-center memento of an off-center vacation.  Aaron is much more scary and  evil than the red-faced bad guy in the last Star Wars movie!  The gory  splatter stuff is intense, but strictly supports the story and builds to a  great finish.  It doesn't seem like this should also be funny, but it is.  When Aaron torments Lucius it's just great! When Chiron and Demetrius are  together, it's unforgettable!  Another review said, ""Dunne is not  Taymor.""  I agree. Good for you, Mr. Dunne.  I'll add that ""Titus  Andronicus"" is not ""Titus"" either.  So what?  We're lucky to  have great alternatives to Hollywood ""product"".  This fresh tape  is a bargain entertainment value.",953769600,5,1252,4.773584905660377
7794057,5,0967801206,"It's no surprise to me that customer reviews of this film fall so firmly on one side or the other.  I saw this film on the big screen at a special showing in 1999, and I couldn't wait to get a copy for myself.  For those  literate and broadminded enough to appreciate a truly original and  intelligently adapted Shakespearean classic, this cult film is a treasure.  The acting is qualitatively superior to the majority of Shakespearean  performance on film and/or video.  At the screening I attended, the only  audience members who did not apreciate the actors' performances were  confused by and disinterested in the original material upon which this film  is based.  In fact, the actors did such a fine job of portraying their  characters with depth and emotion, the storyline was easier to follow and  fully appreciate than most productions I've ever seen on stage and on film  featuring more well-known actors.  Titus, Lucious, and the evil villians  Tamora and Aaron were so engaging and stimulating, their every appearance  drew vocal response and applause from the audience as each cruel act of  revenge played out.  It is odd that an intelligent adaptation such as this  includes over-broad gory horror, but that's what makes it a cult film, and  in my opinion quite brilliant.  Bravo!",953337600,4,1293,4.916279069767442
7794058,1,0967801206,"Of all the film versions of plays by William Shakespeare this has got to be the worst. I agree with one reviewer that you could have gotten better performances from people off the street. I hope all these actors donated  their time to this film for there isn't one worthy of a penny in  remuneration. Cuts to the text had no justification. And the special  effects. Zounds! What special effects!  A plastic kneck brace spewing forth  blood; a latex head chopped in half; a rubber baby doll impaled on a stake  (not even in the original text);and more! It's not even a ""good""  bad movie.",952387200,8,586,4.523809523809524
