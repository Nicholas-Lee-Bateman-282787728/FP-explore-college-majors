8001212,1,B0000DI87W,"I rented this movie because of Ornella Muti. The story and the multiple characters seemed interesting in the beginning of the movie, and I thought that this would be a great film. But after the first 30 minutes, it became an AWFUL movie (lost its characters, lost its plots, and lost its meaning). Avoid this movie.",1353542400,2,315,4.642857142857143
