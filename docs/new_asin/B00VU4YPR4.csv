7108811,3,B00VU4YPR4,"WOMAN IN GOLD was a very enjoyable movie that could have been even more exciting and effective.  It contains a very interesting story and the opportunity for some wonderful art & costume direction, along with a couple of stellar performances.  It is also sloppily directed and has a couple of very unfortunate performances.  On the whole, it is worth seeing, but I couldn't help but think more of the missed opportunities.

Best, the movie (based on a true story) stars Helen Mirren.  Thats usually enough to grab my interest, and she seldom disappoints.  Shes one of those actresses who just refuses to be uninteresting, even if she isn't being challenged.  She plays Maria Altmann, an octogenarian living in Southern California who as a young lady was driven from Nazi occupied Austria, leaving behind her wealthy Jewish family just as their dwelling was being occupied and looted for its extraordinary art collection.  Now, decades later, she wants to sue the Austrian government for the return of her familys treasures, including the most famous work by Gustav Klimt, one of Austrias most beloved artists.  The piece, WOMAN IN GOLD, hangs in the national gallerybut to Maria, it is a painting of her beloved, mysterious aunt and a representative of all that was stripped from her and her family.  Their lives, their wealth, their freedom.

Young attorney Randy Schoenberg (Ryan Reynolds) is inspired to take on her case.  Hes never thought much about his own Jewish heritage or that members of his own family suffered and died under the Nazis.  So even though his fledgling legal career is struggling, he is driven to risk all.

The movie is told both in modern times and in flashbacks.  Tatiana Maslawny (ORPHAN BLACK) plays the young Mirren, and she is wonderful with her accent as she always is in her amazing role on her cult-hit TV show.  Mirren occasionally, in dream like sequences, interacts with these ghosts of her pastand the device seems cheap and unnecessary.  Youve got a great actress like Mirren at your disposalhow about a little subtlety?  The entire movie is filled with distractingly hit-you-over-the-head moments.  It treats its audience like dummies, to be honest.  Told with more grace, this could have been an unforgettable tear-jerker, but it fumbles the real moments because it is CONSTANTLY trying to elicit strong feelings from you.  Instead of letting the natural climactic moments grab youit seems to want you to be in a state of outrage, suspense or tearfulness nearly all the time.

I hate to do this, but in many ways, I must compare this film to PHILOMENA.  This was another movie in which a younger, reluctant man (in that case, a journalist) becomes interested in the plight of wronged older woman.  That movie, while still a bit predictable or clichd at times, was handled so much more deftly.  It trusted its star, Judi Dench to do the heavy lifting, and she did.  It also benefitted from having the deceivingly effective Steve Coogan as her co-star, and in many ways, he became nearly Denchs equal emotionally.  Ryan Reynolds is supposed to fill that role, but he is, simply put, dreadful.  This sounds mean (and I guess it is) but he looks too dumb to be a lawyer.  Having Reynolds wear a pair of glasses to show us how smart he is gives you an idea of the levels to which this movie will sink.  We never get to see him actually BEING smart.  We just have to accept that he is.  Reynolds seems like an amiable guy, and hes done some deft light comedybut Im sorry, hes out of his depth here.  Mirren does her best to bring him along with her, but even she is not that good.

When Mirren and Reynolds first head to Austria, they run into a journalist, played by the usually interesting Daniel Bruehl, who agrees to help them for very vague reasons.  Reynolds doesnt trust his motives, but suddenly he does.  (Feels like some scenes were cut.)  Bruehl helps them a bit, and then is gone.  His character is never really explained, and thus Bruehls performance seems needlessly mysterious or even creepy.  His part was over castmeaning there was no need for a high-profile actor to be put into this nothing role.  Its distracting.  Just like having Katie Holmes in a tiny, under-written part as Reynolds wife is distracting.

Finally, the movie doesnt give us enough of a chance to appreciate the art.  This piece is so important to the movie and so important to Austria and to Mirrenyet we never get to feel that very much.  Yes, we see the piece a few times, but somehow the movie fails to make us really SEE the piece and its power.  This is a thread that would have helped tied all the motifs of the past and present together.

Mirren is terrific, and the true story is fascinating and exciting.  I am certainly glad I got to know more about this artwork, its creation and its story.  But it would have been far, far improved with a better director, script and co-star.  See it, but don't expect to be greatly moved.",1430438400,34,4959,4.70383275261324
7108812,5,B00VU4YPR4,"This excellent movie had some relatively modest reviews but when I saw it in the theater towards the end of its run it was practically a full house. I think that means it had good word of mouth and I would recommend anyone to see it. The story is so intrinsically interesting that it would be worth seeing even if the performances were less stellar. With the cast that it does have it is a must see. It very subtly draws you into the gilded world of pre-war Vienna. I am ashamed to say that for the first time I really felt why this looted art is so important, why it was such an outrage that it ended up hanging on the walls of state galleries. I knew this painting too as ""Woman in Gold"" when growing up from art books of the 70s (as if it was some renaissance or medieval portrait of a sitter whose identity has been lost in the mists of time). Not so (obviously), and it gains so much from knowing about the real figure captured within it, and the act of deliberate suppression it must have took to give it that other, mendacious, name. In a brief scene you see what happened to other belongings: a beautiful secessionist diamond choker seen later around the fat neck of Madame Goering...shocking. You could see that a creed that was so completely without morals, without any sort of human decency would take mankind somewhere evil, an evil beyond evil, and the story of the painting becomes a reminder of all that too. It really affected me.",1430179200,,1446,4.379182156133829
7108813,3,B00VU4YPR4,"Gustav Klimt, the great art-nouveau Austrian painter, was an icon of Viennese WWI-to-WWII decadent timeout. He painted trees and gardens (superb), frank erotica, mythical feminine symbolism, and portraits of women of rich Vienna, mainly Jewish burgeoisie. His sumptuously decorative portraits, dripping with pearls, gold-leaf, and femininity were (and are) copied (but never equalled) by many followers. A portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer, the woman in gold, by Klimt was brutally robbed by the Nazi's from the family of her niece, Maria Altman. Maria and her husband managed to escape to the US by the skin of their teeth, while most of her family died or perished in the WWII holocaust. The post-war Austrian government gratefully accepted the role of another Nazi victim country, despite the popular enthusiastic collaboration after unification with Hitler's Third Reich. Maria tries to recover her stolen inheritance, while the Austrian authorities do everything possible to prevent her from getting back the stolen art. Luckily, she hires a young failing lawyer, a granson of Shoenberg, the Austrian great composer, who does the impossible and recovers her paintings.
It is a fascinating story of human suffering, of art, of brutality, of deceit, of theft, of sacrifice, of death, and of fortitude. Unfortunately the movie misses becoming a classic. Instead, like many Hollywood dramas, it is mostly shallow with a traditional dotting of the i's and crossing of the t's, and providing visual cliches for everything as well. The writer and the director could not resist the really mushy scenes of Marias wedding with a variation on Hora (extremely unlikely for a Viennese rich Jewish family) and sentences like ""Leave it please. This is his whole life!"" when the Nazis steal Maria's father Strad cello. Despite the trite treatment, Helen Mirren's superb acting shines throughout provides a very important redeeming feature A very good performance by Reynolds, also.
A thought-why are more keenly moved when barbarians destroy great art and history (Taliban and the colossal Buddha , Islamic terror destroying Iraqi heritage city, Hitler's burning of books and 'degenerate art'), than when they mass destroy human lives?",1429574400,,2220,5.400576368876081
7108814,5,B00VU4YPR4,When this movie came to my area I was seriously worried that it wouldn't make it to the Chicago suburbs but it did! This movie was  beautifully made and interesting beginning to end.  Helen Mirren and the supporting cast did a masterful job of portraying this modern day David and Goliath story.  I hope they receive the recognition they deserve.,1429488000,,346,4.733333333333333
7108815,5,B00VU4YPR4,"I just saw this movie in the theater. Absolutely PHENOMENAL. The trailer showed an appealing story in and of itself, but the flawless acting, vivid backstory and just real essence and raw humanity of the film left me on the verge of tears at certain points. I recommend this for anybody who wants to see a really good movie. It keeps you on the edge of your seat, has you clutching at your heart and gives you the happy ending you think you saw coming but is still nothing like you expected. Wonderful, wonderful film. And it's based on a true story. That makes it all the better.",1429056000,2,580,4.37962962962963
7108816,5,B00VU4YPR4,"This movie is just flawless in any category; acting, cinematography, sound, locations, story flow. Helen Mirren is of course the star but everybody else involved were perfect also. Telling the young woman's life story, their hair-raising escape from Nazi occupation, and at the same time describing the red tape involved in getting back stolen family property by the Nazi's 50 years prior is just a stunning accomplishment. But, the icing on the cake, which they could have ignored, is how most of the population of Austria (and other European countries) colluded with the Nazi's.

This is such an incredible movie, it should be required screening in high schools, it should never be forgotten what happens when hate and prejudice team up with apathy. No graphic violence is required to get the message across - classy all the way.",1429056000,9,831,5.021739130434782
7108817,5,B00VU4YPR4,"Woman in Gold

 We are accustomed to the words and sights connected with the Nazi inflicted Jewish Holocaust in Europe at the time of World War II.  We are not nearly as accustomed to blatant European based anti-Semitic attitudes and actions as it is practiced in this day and age.  It is deeply and viscerally shocking.  My God, we say, this is the 21st Century!  This is not the Middle Ages!  We live in an age of wonders and enlightenment.  No so to far too many people in modern day Austria.
 The story of Maria Altmann comes to us from her own words, her own experience.  As a young bride in Vienna she and her entire family were held hostage by the Nazis after the so called Anschluss in 1938 and then stripped of their private possessions, including their art works.  Anschluss refers to the annexation of Austria into greater Germany, the Germany of the Third Reich.  Maria and her husband made it out through Switzerland, England and finally the USA.
 We enter the movie in 1999.  Maria is an octogenarian by this time with a sense that time is moving along.  One of the most celebrated (and now valuable) works ripped from Maria's family was a painting of Maria's aunt, Adele Bloch-Bauer.  Even today, over 100 years since its 1907 creation, the painting arrests the attention of the viewer. Maris wanted the painting of her aunt returned to her.
 The authorities in Austria, portrayed in the film as vile, grasping reptiles, intent not upon justice but upon inflicting the last possible defeat and indignity upon an old woman, a Jew.
 On April 2 of this year a special exhibit opened at the Neue Galarie in New York.  Fans of art and justice can see the painting, Adele Bloch-Bauer 1, at their leisure.
 Helen Mirren (69), surely one of the hardest working actresses of her generation, plays the determined Maria Altman with grit and just the right pinch of soul tiredness.  She makes an entirely believable performance.  Her co-star is Ryan Reynolds who plays Randol Schoenberg, the struggling young attorney who devotes years of his life to pry Maria's possessions from the hands of the Austrian State.  Mirren  has 50 credits in the new century including two more films to be released later in 2015 and the delightful The Hundred Foot Journey in 2014.  She has played the Queen of England three times and received her only Oscar for the The Queen in 2006.  She does Maria Altmann justice in every frame.
 Director Simon Curtis is perhaps best known for his 2011 film My Week With Marilyn but he has dozens of credits.  He directs a very delicate film, the more infuriating because of the tone of restrained civility in the face of outrageous injustice inflicted upon the old woman by the government of Austria.
 Alexi Kaye Campbell wrote from the original book by Maria Altmann and E. Randol Schoenberg, the lawyer in the case.
 Also seen in Woman in Gold are Katie Holmes and Charles Dance (Game of thrones).  Director Simon Curtis cast his wife in a small role as a judge.  Curtis is married to Elizabeth McGovern (currently seen as Lady Crawley in Downton Abbey).
 The film carries a PG-13 rating and lasts for one hour and 39 minutes.  If you want to see a film, a true story, about wild injustice and a bravely determined woman who sets out to reverse it, see this one.  If you want a film that grown-ups can enjoy, see this one.  If you can't bring yourself to see films about purple aliens, flying robots or modern day dinosaurs, come out to see this one.  Wonderful films will not be made unless people support them by going out and seeing them.  See this one.

7108818,5,B00VU4YPR4,"While this is a deeply moving story, this is the first film about the Holocaust I've ever heard of that is not intensely violent or overwhelmingly gut-wrenching. You could take the whole family to see Woman in Gold without being concerned in the slightest about traumatizing even a child. The story is told in such a straightforward way you get to feel like you are a friend of the Altman and Bloch-Bauer family! It's that intimate! Wow! That's what I call good filmmakin

The next time you are in New York City I highly recommend visiting The Neue Gallery located on Museum Mile. Seeing  the Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I by Gustav Klimt in real life is quite an experience! There's good reason why the painting is called the ""Mona Lisa of Austria.""

This is also a story about being a good lawyer. If you want to be a lawyer someday, this story will give you an idea what a determined and intelligent lawyer can accomplish!",1428796800,223,927,4.572289156626506
7108819,5,B00VU4YPR4,"I would add only that the silent star of the film is the painting itself. I understand that the producers commissioned two full copies and one partial to stand in for the real painting which of course couldn't be used. I will certainly buy the dvd when it comes out, but if possible one should see this in the theater where you can get an impression of the real majesty of the painting. The judicious and savvy way the director has shot the painting, from the opening minutes where you see Klimt preparing and applying the gold leaf to the canvas, to the final scena where Maria returns to the apartment where her family lived and we are transported back in time to see the family living in the home and the pride of place the painting occupied, is simply magical. I hope the dvd has a few ""making of"" segments, at least one of which should show us how the copies were made.",1428796800,131,874,4.335365853658536
7108820,5,B00VU4YPR4,"If you've seen the documentary ""The Rape of Europa"" you are already familiar with this well-known portrait of the lovely Jewish woman by Austrian painter Gustav Klimt. This new movie provides the back story of how the painting was fought for by the woman's niece, long after WWII, as privately owned works of art confiscated by the Nazis were displayed in European museums.

With a screenplay by Alexi Kaye Campbell based on his life story by E. Randol Schoenberg, director Simon Curtis (""My Week With Marilyn"") brings us a fascinating character study as an elderly refugee and an inexperienced young lawyer sue the Austrian government via the U.S. Supreme Court, for her family heirloom.

We see:
  * Helen Mirren (""RED"") as Maria Altmann, an octogenarian dress shop proprietor who realizes she is the best person to tackle this issue. Mirren gives us a witty, determined character who is all too human.
  * Tatiana Maslany (""Orphan Black"") is the young Maria Altmann caught up in the turbulence of World War II. Maslany more than holds her own as she portrays the younger version of Mirren's character.
  * Moritz Bleibtreu (""Munich"") is Gustav Klimt the painter who captures the glowing beauty of Adele Bloch-Bauer, our eponymous Woman in Gold.
  * Ryan Reynolds (""Chaos Theory"") Randol Schoenberg is swept into the situation by his mother, but soon realizes the validity of Maria's claim. All he needs now is audacity (and another loan from his father).
  * Daniel Brhl (""Rush"") His character greets them in Vienna. He provides valuable experience and tactics for their claim.
  * Max Irons (""Red Riding Hood"" - 2011) Fritz and Maria are forced into a headlong flight for their lives when the Nazis come to plunder their Viennese home.
  * Katie Holmes (""Dawson's Creek"") Pam is Randol's patient (and pregnant) wife. She comes to realize that this lawsuit is important and worth the sacrifice.

The breathtaking cityscapes of Vienna are worth the price of admission, as are the muted flashbacks which portray the elegant lives of affluent Jewish families in prewar Vienna, followed by the subsequent brutality of the Nazis. Here we have people to root for and an issue that has, at its heart, the determination to right a wrong done over half a century ago.

Despite getting a bit soppy at times, this satisfying PG-13 film is laced generously with humor and humanity. (Hotel clerk: ""You're from Austria? My little girl loves Austria, especially the kangaroos!"")",1428710400,83,2466,4.987775061124695

7108875,2,B00VU4YPR4,"Outstanding performances by Reynolds & Mirren & a very potent reminder that the holocaust was not ancient history, but not ""entertainment"".
Very powerful & moving. Reynolds becomes obsessed & Mirren struggles with reliving the past. Both wrestling with emotions they don't want to experience. Is it fascinating ? Yes. Is their cause noble ? Not really. And that's the sad part. What they are fighting for is a representation of what they really want, which is what they will never get & there in lies the sad part. Horrible things were done, people did them, people condoned them & then people wanted to forget & even pretend the truth of what happened. Returning objects is just a token of remembrance, which really is what the movie should be called. Seeing the era of Hitler in color & not just black & white reminded me all too painfully that what happened is not as remote from us as we'd like.

I know Peter Altmann personally - we worked together for well over 20 years both as drivers, and him as a supervisor & later on as one of the several union presidents we had (the very best one of all the ones we had!) and he told me that this movie finally does some justice to the horrors of the Nazi regime of WWII. I was born Johann Pieter Abfalter of Austria, and later adopted by American parents in 1954; my name was changed to reflect the Anglicized version of Johann to John. My birth mother was Eva Maria Abfalter who had emigrated from Austria to Germany in 1937 with her mother. I had to fight with dogs for food during my initial formative years - such was the state of Bad Orb (near Frankfurt) Germany in the early '50's, so I know something of the aftermath of what the Nazi's did to that country!

7108902,4,B00VU4YPR4,"I like almost everything Helen Mirren is in. She did come across as a grumpy old lady in this however. Her accent kept changing as I just saw her in another film and it made her look rather worn out. The ending was weak. Two smiles from her Aunt Adele and one from her that should have been redone. He teeth did not show and it made her lips look thick. I guess I just thought this film wasn't polished like most of the ones she is in. I did not like the cussing from Ryan Reynolds. He dropped the F boom and used God's name in vain and that is when I knew I did not like the film. He is too baby faced to make such harsh statements and it did not go over at all. He should have stayed the innocent looking lawyer.

I was happy when she got the paintings back and donated most of her money to charity and family. She was old and did not need $135 million. The artist name Klimt was a sex pervert and had many women and fathered 14 children. He was a lecher.  The Women in Gold is a lovely painting and one of his best as most all the other ones are sick porn. Let's you know what those days were like in pre-world war II Vienna. Very little morals and the rich acting like snobs. I did feel sorry for her family. I liked the father best. He played the cello and was a kind and loving father. The acting was good and Maria's husband played by Max Irons was delicious. The opera voice aspects was intriguing as I am a singer myself. The wedding were he sang a German aria to his bride was delightful. It made me cry.  All in all, I liked it except for the cuss words. That needs to stop!",1500336000,,1585,3.9779874213836477
7108903,5,B00VU4YPR4,"As a military veteran, with an interest in the history of war, and the political elements that make it possible, I have read, and viewed, a number of stories written, and produced, surrounding the second world war, which can largely be seen as an extension of the first world war.  To be sure, combat veterans, like Adolph Hitler, and the core group that formed the NAZI movement, endured a horrible experience in the trenches, that might explain some of the brutality, and violence, of their Third Reich.  But to me, there is no excuse for war, which serve the interests of war profiteers, and political opportunists.  So, I am not interested in excusing their actions, or vilifying them, with the advantage of hindsight.  Everyone involved, at the time, suffered horribly, and unfairly.

This film tells an important story, with dignity, and reason, rather that inflammatory rhetoric, designed to perpetuate animosity, or cement stereotypes, to benefit current opportunists, and profit seekers.  It is reminiscent of the quality, and insight, provided to a previous generation by Director, Stanley Kramer, in JUDGEMENT AT NUREMBERG, and SHIP OF FOOLS, on a human level

However one may feel about the role of the Jewish people, in history, or economic life, the fact that the highly valued works of art central to WOMAN IN GOLD would not even have existed, had the artist not been engaged by the subject family, at their own initiative, and expense, is the gravamen of the case.  The outcome is a powerful example of the persistent, and judicious application of logic, in a legal forum, that is emblematic of constitutional government, and non-violent conflict resolution.  To me, that is a story worth telling.  (USMC 1968-75)",1498608000,3,1729,5.056338028169014

7108906,5,B00VU4YPR4,"A truly important work that needed to be told before it's just too late.  The majority of Holocaust survivors are dying of old age while their incredible works of art, precious jewelry, furniture and other valuable possessions remain as stolen property in national museums and wealthy individuals' homes.  This movie is about the famous portrait, ""Woman in Gold"" by Klimt.  It was originally named, ""Adele"" for the beautiful Jewish socialite whose family had commissioned the painting.  Her niece, who knew her intimately, was there when the Nazis stole it from her home in Vienne about 70 years ago.  When her sister died, she found a letter that reminded her of the painting and she hires a nephew to help her get it back.  This is a movie about David and a very greedy and unrepentant Goliath (Austrian government, museums, a percentage of the population).  The initial part of the case was actually reviewed and decided by the Supreme Court- (I won't tell you what they decided- you can bite your nails like I did!)

I am so glad that director Simon Curtis brought this important legal case before the American public because it might make other survivors or their families more hopeful and educated about how to reclaim their own properties from Austria, Switzerland and Germany.  I'm also glad that the movie gives the information that lawyer  Randy Schoenberg is practicing reclamation law, helping other Holocaust survivors get their properties back too.  This movie is not 'slow moving' as one reviewer states- I was riveted the entire time.  The drama was gripping and the story was told so poignantly that I was in tears by the end.  What the Jews suffered was monstrous.  It boggles the mind- it truly does.  And it bothers me that now that the last survivors are dying, there are those who are daring to claim that the Germans never gassed or burned the Jews in the concentration camps!  I can understand why Ms. Altman repeats her desire that people must 'remember' what happened in Germany and Austria.  We really MUST remember or we are destined to repeat it.  We owe it to those who suffered and died to at least remember it.  And for justice's sake, we MUST return every item that was taken from every victim of the holocaust:  every stick of furniture, every diamond, every brooch, every painting, sculpture, plate, gold or silver candelabra.  Until that day, the Holocaust will convict the world and every current individual or museum who retains that stolen property.

You won't see a finer made movie than this.  It never bogs down in gore, overt sensationalism, or depression.  Mrs. Altman's levity and bouncy personality see us through the devastation of the actual events (thanks to actress  Helen Mirren as well!).  Her strength and perspective of 50 years allows us, those that never suffered, to let go of our own guilt and enjoy the movie for what it is: her desire for a bit of justice before she dies.",1498176000,9,2932,4.814

The story is a very engaging one, and brings to light an aspect of the war that is not often considered.  The plot is compelling, in part because you quickly find yourself cheering for the underdog, in the attempts to regain what is rightfully hers from the Austrian government.  There's also a strong sense of justice throughout. The PG-13 rating is occasioned mainly as a result of some strong but not frequent language, but aside from that there is little objectionable.

Altmann is played by Helen Mirren, and her sharp character was one of the highlights of this film for me.  A very enjoyable movie all round, and one I recommend to mature viewers.  - GODLY GADFLY (April 2017)",1492819200,,952,4.603550295857988

Ryan Reynolds is a strange choice as a grandson of a well known Austrian. It was disturbing to see him act unlike the heritage he was to portray.

7108965,5,B00VU4YPR4,One of the best movies I have seen. I sat to watch this movie because I became curious about the tittle. Seven minutes into the movie I knew it was going to be a pleasant and very interesting biographical story. Helen Mirren is a great dramatic actress and it shows. If you know history you are well aware of the Nazi holocaust that engulfed Vienna (Austria). That fact was well covered without having to actually show the physical abuse toward the Jews. I recommend this movie. Reminder: If your ignore history you are bound to repeat it.,1487289600,,539,4.56701030927835
7108966,5,B00VU4YPR4,"A Dynamic script for a glorious actress.  Helen Mirren hits it out of the park once again.  This true story, has some humor and electricity, which turns to undeniable love.  Multi-faceted deep love story can only leave you with a tear in your eyes at times.  Mirren is at her best with her counterpart lawyer, and the script was stupendous.  If you haven't take time for this one, do it now !.  Sincerely you will cry, tough or not.",1487203200,,432,4.405063291139241
7108967,5,B00VU4YPR4,"This is a wonderful jewel of a movie. It's heartbreaking and sad and horrifying, but very warm and real. We need these reminders not to forget the horrors that the Jewish people suffered, the loss of all they owned, their homes, their community and most of all their loved ones, their very lives.
They did not (and do not) deserve this treatment, this degradation, humiliation, and terrible suffering. Jewish people have contributed so much beauty and intelligence and wisdom to the world. They continue to give back today in immeasurable ways of innovation and inventions and in the medical world, in music and literature, art, etc. They share their discoveries with the world. Watch it, let it touch your soul. You will be moved to tears. After viewing on Netflix, I bought it on Amazon because I wanted to own this movie to watch over again and again. Helen Mirren is amazing (one of my very favorite actresses!) and Ryan Reynolds does an excellent job as the young lawyer whose heart and life is changed by his part in this unfolding drama. the scenes that take place in Austria are so beautiful.",1487203200,,1100,4.734375

7109004,4,B00VU4YPR4,"Very expertly executed performance by Helen Mirren of the real life Maria Bloch Altman, who was born and raised in a very wealthy Jewish family in Vienna.  At age 82, when the film begins, she attends the funeral of her sister, a long time rival.  Going through her effects she realizes that there may be still a claim to some of the family's stolen artwork, paintings commissioned by her wealthy uncle, for the services of Jugendstil painter Klimt.

In real life Maria had had four children and run a clothing store, successful by being the first to bring cashmere sweaters to USA.  Funny that anyone would want to buy cashmere when living in Los Angeles as she did!!  Her marriage to Frederick (Fritz) Altman was in 1937 , with a year later his passport taken away by the nazis and no exit for Jews allowed from Austria in 1938.  He was arreated and held in Dachau for two months until his cousin Bloch would turn over his textile factory to the Nazis.  Head shaven and kaput, he returned to his wife in Vienna.  They then tried to escape three times together.  Third time was the charm.  It is not as portrayed in the film with the pharmacy episode.

The airplane boarding scene was worse than shown in the film.  The stewardess had asked the crowd if there were two people from Vienna.  Maria and Fritz did not speak.  Nothing more happened.  They were able to get to Cologne and over the border to France.  They got to England from there and felt safe enough until the British government letting he know. That citizens form Italy or germany could not stay.  Males from these countries were locked up during the war.  Jewish or catholic or protenstanf, you were simply considered German or Austrian and therefore an enemy alien.  That is why Maria and fritz got themselves to USA.

The film follows loosely the real campaign by elderly Maria and her nephew the lawyer in pursuing this famous Klimt painting.  Eventually when they do get It, it is sold at auction for $88 million and with the other four paintings by Klimt, they got $350 million!!!

The movie is strong in showing modern and 1940's scenes of Vienna.  It is true that the Austrians welcomed the Anschluss in 1938 in the hopes of a Better economy.  They had been devastated in the first world war and lost their empire.  Jews were far from the only minority I in that huge empire.  Many Jews were assimilated and felt themselves Austrian and were proud of it.  Others felt quite distinct and detached coming from the east of the empire and speaking Yiddish. I think all Jews knew that they were not so accepted.

Maria's family had become rich in Czechoslovakia from sugar originally and then moved to Vienna.

Maria hated Austrians for what they had done to her family and would not accept them.  Sixty years later she still
Considered them all Nazis and Jew haters. I think she is wrong.  I was eight months living.near. Salzburg and heard all kinds of different opinions.  Some do and some don't as anywhere.

Young lawyer Alfred Schonberg has a wife and a kid and another on the way.  For him to accompany Maria and become so involved was a big sacrifice.  He became obsessed after the first trip back there in 1998 for his own people had had the same fate :either dead or fled. He is the grandson of the composer schonberg in real life.

Enjoy the film for Helen Mirren and the scenes of Vienna and the plot line of recovering the stolen artwork. Some say it is slow but I think it should be. Maria died age 94 and that huge aum of money went to relatives and charities.

The man who bought the Lady in Gold is the son of Estee Lauder who collects art.",1484524800,,3625,4.496171516079633

7109048,4,B00VU4YPR4,"I would have to say that Helen Mirren is a great actress and she basically carries this movie. Ryan Reynolds isn't a great choice to play the lawyer, however, simply because I just can't see a sense of grit in his portrayal of his character. He seems overwhelmed at times. The Austrian government seems to be the bad guys in this movie, although we know that the Nazis were the real villains, It was an over all enjoyable movie to watch and we found it to be somewhat accurate in its portrayal of the times in the late 30's and early 40's. Some might say that it wasn't dark enough because it doesn't show all that many of the atrocities heaped upon the Jewish community during the holocaust but I think we sometimes are best suited to imagine these things, rather than have them thrown in our faces. I believe that it showed enough for us as an audience to get the feel of the times. As for the painting itself, that was gaudy to say the least. Art is fascinating in how it affects each and every one of us in entirely different ways! See the movie and decide for yourself.",1481932800,,1074,4.321782178217822

7109084,5,B00VU4YPR4,"Well acted, well directed, based on a true story. Helen Mirren marvelously portrays a Jewish woman who was determined to get back a painting that the Nazis stole from her family, a painting done by a famous artist of one of her relatives. She took her quest from America to Vienna, was opposed at every turn but, with help from an attorney and others who bolstered her up when she was ready to give up because of all the obstacles, she finally won out. As a Jewish woman myself whose grandparents had relatives and close friends who were victims of the Holocaust and had valuables stolen from them by the Nazis, all of whom (except two) died in the camps, this was a must-see movie for me. However, even if you're not Jewish, even if none of your ancestors (be they Jewish or in another group that was also victimized by the Nazis), it's a must-see movie. It's a portrayal of persistence and hope, a movie that touches your heart, that makes you cry sometimes, laugh sometimes, and cheer at other times.",1476748800,,1003,4.516483516483516

Especially for people with maculer degeneration, the subs were too fast and way way too small and too light.  I know that the trend is to have subtitgles these days, but long ago, they just sufficed by using accents to indicate another language being spoken - it made life easier.  We want to WATCH a movie, not read a movie.  But the size, the quickness of the subs, that was a pure failing of this movie.

As to the merits of the lawsuit - well, I see arguments on here.  What happened, happened - the movie is based on true story.  Nazis stole the art and the art belonged to Altmann.

7109207,5,B00VU4YPR4,"This is a marvelous very moving portrayal of a heinous Nazi act that was perpetuated by the Austrian nation decades after World War II, of a persistent elderly woman, and a lawyer who gave up his livelihood to do what is just.
The famed artist Gustav Klimt painted two portraits of a Jewish woman Adele Bloch-Bauer. The first was done in gold in 1907. It sold in 2006 for $135 million dollars. The second was painted in 1912 and was later sold for $88 million dollars. This film tells the tale of the first painting.
The Nazis stole the painting from Adele Bloch-Bauer's family and it was appropriated by the Austrian government and placed in their museum. Unwilling to acknowledge that the painting was of a Jewish woman, they called the painting ""The Woman in Gold."" When her niece tried to get the Austrian government to return the painting which belonged to her, they not only refused but lied and placed all kinds of stumbling blocks in front of her and her lawyer.
Her lawyer sued in court and the case reached the US Supreme Court. It was finally settled by arbitration in Austria in a decision that made many honest Austrians proud.",1469491200,,1140,4.620689655172414

7109222,3,B00VU4YPR4,"WOMAN IN GOLD mines the apparently inexhaustible subject of Nazi atrocities during World War Two. This time it centers around Maria Altmann (Helen Mirren), an Austrian refugee forced to leave her homeland after the Anschluss of 1938, when Hitler's troops invaded. They came in and stole many of the family's treasures, including valuable paintings by Gustav Klimt. Three years later the paintings were given to the Belvedere Museum in Vienna, where they are still on display.

After burrowing through long-lost paperwork, Maria and her companion, hotshot lawyer Randy Schnberg (Ryan Reynolds), the grandson of another refugee, the Austrian composer Arnold Schnberg, decide to take on the museum in an attempt to restore the paintings - especially the eponymous ""Woman in Gold"" (a painting of Altmann's aunt) to their rightful owner. There follows a series of courtroom battles, following the familiar trope of the little person taking on the institution.

While Mirren offers us a convincing Austro-English accent, she is manifestly too young for the role (the real Altmann was in her eighties when she began efforts to pursue the Belvedere through the courts). At times it seems as if Mirren is offering us a reprise of her role in THE QUEEN (2006), right down to the sliver of lip-gloss on her otherwise pale features. Reynolds doesn't have much to do except to put on a concerned expression, especially while trying to deal with his wife Pam (Katie Holmes), and stand up bravely in court against the apparently implacable attorney working for the Austrian government (Rolf Saxon).

What redeems the film is its palpable seriousness of purpose. Production designer Jim Clay has worked hard to recreate the atmosphere in the immediate wake of the Anschluss, where cheering crowds of Hitler supporters are counterbalanced by antisemitic mobs keen to root out as many so-called ""enemies of the state"" as possible. Most of the sequences taking place in the past are photographed in washed-out colors (by Ross Emery), that serve the symbolic function of suggesting how the Nazi occupation deprived what had been a multicultural society of much of its life-blood.

Based on historical fact, the outcome can be easily discerned from about halfway through the film. Nonetheless director Curtis prompts us to reflect on the ethics of the entire campaign - although Maria deserves to have her family property restored to her, is the persistent campaign conducted on her behalf really worth it? What good does it do to rake up the past, especially the series of traumatic events leading up to and including her enforced flight from her homeland?",1469232000,,2636,5.151869158878505

7109272,1,B00VU4YPR4,"At best this is simplistic and cliche. However, it takes a supposedly factual story and tells it from the point of view of some greedy individuals. In reality, Klimt did not make a penny off this painting and gave it to the model Adele, who willed it to the Austrian government. Indeed, its one of the most famous paintings by the most famous Austrian painter, and is a cultural artifact that should be enjoyed by millions. Instead, the beautiful Klimt museum in Vienna is absent of any of his great works. This lady used loopholes and the misuse of Holocaust laws to get possession of four paintings. The great sentimental value of these painting was shown when they were promptly put up for auction for hundreds of millions of dollars and sold to the highest bidders. The movie shows the lawyer not interested at all in the case, until he finds out the worth. Its simplistic and offensive to inject the holocaust into this story, and to imply that all Austrians are humorless Nazi sympathizers. There was a will that clearly left the painting to the Austria to be enjoyed in Austria. The Austrian people and visitors to the Klimt museum are the ones who suffered so this woman and her lawyer could get rich. This movie does not give both sides, and in fact humanized and glorifies those making the grab for the money. The story is not really even worth telling, but these movie makers have chosen to turn it into something it was not, and their shoddy film making is evident in the simplistic story line and lack of facts of key points, for example how quickly and for how much the entire collection was auctioned off, after their ""victory"". Its a propaganda piece. And Helen Mirren was just in Israel June 2016 to accept some sort of prize for her work for the Jewish people, perhaps because of this movie and her portrayal as a Mossad assassin in another movie. Its contemptible to claim to be a factual or historical movie and just mislead people.",1467158400,,1952,4.595988538681948

The brilliance of the acting, direction, writing, both book and screen play, and the photography were a great combination.
What can anyone say about The Art and The Music; unparalleled. .

As a person who does not speak German, the dialogue of halp the picture was lost to me.  This was important and the fact that I had to
comprehend by actions and tone of voice, left me wanting,

It remains, for me, one of the GREAT PICTURES of the decade,  I will try to re-see it with an entire English translation.",1466899200,,637,4.3277310924369745

7109284,5,B00VU4YPR4,Excellent acting and direction. A great film that tells a tragic story that everyone should know. The fact that this is  just one example of the treachery and deceit that not only once existed then but also exists today. To find absolutely no value in the subject of the piece but only in the artist and his value as an artist is national socialism in its truest form. The fact that these sub humans would send millions to their deaths and still want pictures of them hanging in their homes and galleries is evil in its purist form. Shame on Germany and Austria and I hope the film sheds a light on these governments forever. I wonder how much time and effort is spent educating children around the world what socialism is and the horrors it inflicted on past generations. Yes the Nazi party where socialists. You won't here that from the democratic socialists that exist in our politics today.,1466812800,,894,4.5875

These painting were stolen by the Nazis during World War 2.  Mirren turns in a fine and nuanced performance and Ryan Reynolds shows that he can act without being eye candy.  The two story lines are beautifully interwoven.  The Neue Galerie in NYC is an amazing jewel box of Austrian and German expressionist art which is a must see.  The Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer is a sight to behold, and it is now more moving to view it knowing its history.",1466380800,,612,4.846153846153846

7109313,5,B00VU4YPR4,"A beautiful movie that follows the stories of Mrs. Altman and Mr. Shoenberg in their join attempts to reclaim paintings lost by Mrs. Altman during the siege of Vienna, Austira. What makes her story particularly interesting is that she was the rightful owner of Gustav Klimt's Woman in Gold. Valued at over 100 million dollars, this painting was also considered part of Austria's culture and nationalism. The movie depicts the struggle of the two individuals against the Austrian government and the Belvedere Museuem. More importantly, the movie portrays the suffering, pain, and hurt that individuals faced under Nazi regime and prosecution. For historical value, it is important that this movie addressed the role that non-Jewish Austrian citizens played during the Nazi regime. A more subtle theme that was emphasized only when necessary in the film was Mrs. Altman's desire for the people of Austria to admit the wrongs that they also committed to the Jewish population. This subtle detail of the movie possibly reflects new scholarship within historical studies that seek to look outside and beyond the previous arguments within historiography of the period. Overall, this movie is beautifully done and laden with emotions that bring the viewer into the lives of the individuals involved. The emotional tropes of the film clearly indicate a protagonists and antagonists with the viewer siding with the good guys. The inclusion of contemporary scenes as gorgeous memories of Mrs. Altman within the narrative of the restitution case adds to the emotional inclusion of the viewer. Art historians, historians, history and art enthusiasts will particularly enjoy this movie. Yet, is not in any way ""niche"" in that it would not be enjoyable to an audience outside of these fields. Beautiful movie, and highly recommended.",1465948800,,1819,5.29757785467128

But beyond all that...the *message* is SO IMPORTANT...In a society so full of who is and who isn't a racist (I get so sick of this...people need to quit worrying about what happened in the past and look to what is happening RIGHT NOW in all colors, to all people, in all societies)...to see this, poignant, powerful, and so deeply eloquent film is like lighting a small flame in a very dark corner.

The movie would not have lost an ounce of any credibility or greatness with the omission of this most offensive example of God's name used in this irreverent manner. Otherwise, it was a moving and historically educating account of victory and justice winning against all odds, and even far after one might have thought it  necessary or possible, proving that no matter how long it takes to right the wrong, in the end, justice still should be sought, can be achieved and definitely matters much.

7109391,1,B00VU4YPR4,"When we (slowly) arrive at the point where Helen Mirren's character looks sternly at the befuddled young lawyer (verbally clutching her chest At The Very Idea) to angrily reprimand him, like a character in a Walter Mosley novel, with her mouth partially open, ""You don't think this is about MONEY do you??? ??"" Of course it's about the money!!!! Above all, it's ALL about One Hundred Million Bucks. Well I couldn't watch anymore after that.
Ms Mirren's character must have spent the entire hour+ with that pursed look of reprimand that's supposed to convince audiences that she's noble beyond reproach and that she cares nothing at all about $100 Million Dollars! PLEASE!!
By the way, the movie was based on a true tale. It was a total of $325 million, and a total of 4 paintings which were divided among her heirs. Some are saying it was a great con job and that the paintings didn't even belong to her.",1462665600,,904,4.65625

7109540,5,B00VU4YPR4,"When I saw ""Woman in Gold"" in a theater I was highly impressed with the acting and production qualities, and the true story itself is captivating. Helen Mirren is, as always, superb in her role as the expatriated Austrian trying to reclaim her family heritage forcefully taken by the Nazis during World War II. Ryan Reynolds, whom I had never seen before, is surprisingly excellent as the young lawyer who gives up virtually everything to help win the legal battle for possession of the stolen paintings. Having liked the movie so well, I was determined to get the DVD when available, especially to have the closed captions to make clear some of the dialogue and foreign accents difficult to hear well in the theater. This is an excellent DVD of the original film. The price also was excellent on amazon.com and delivery was swift and efficient.  If you are drawn to this type of movie, I highly recommend it.",1455408000,,909,4.716981132075472

7109661,5,B00VU4YPR4,"First..a confession.  I LOVE Helen Mirren.  She is one of the most talented actresses to ever grace the silver screen.  She is almost ""chameleon-like"" in her ability to shift between complex characters, accents, personalities and emotions (think ""Reds"" and then contrast that with ""Woman in Gold"" just as an example).  As this is a true story, she spent much time studying Maria Altman (the protagonist in the story) and how she and her family endured the Nazi persecution of Jews in occupied Austria.  At first I couldn't understand why she simply wouldn't leave the ""Adele"" painting by Klimt in good hands with the Austrian Belvedere Museum.  Didn't it really belong to the Austrian people? Hadn't they ALL suffered under the Nazis?  But, as the story progresses, I found myself cheering her on to truly achieve ""restitution"" and to correct a horrible wrong.  A wonderful movie - with a true story of courage (for both her and her lawyer as expertly played by Ryan Reynolds.)  Highly recommended.",1453507200,,998,4.963855421686747

The story itself is fascinating and, honestly, amazing; Helen Mirren and Ryan Reynolds' acting was truly astonishingly good.  They had such great chemistry with each other, too.  I highly recommend this movie for anyone who's interested in WWII without wanting the complete heartbreak of so many of the movies about Jewish families, and which is sufficiently restrained in what it shows to allow children to enjoy the movie as well, and learn about an important moment in both European history and recent American history.",1453507200,,809,4.970370370370371

7109674,5,B00VU4YPR4,"World War II destroyed the lives of countless of millions. A few people like Austrian Jew Maria Altmann and her husband were able to escape the horrors of the Nazi-occupied Europe and settle in the US. The WOMAN IN GOLD tells the amazing story of Maria's fight for justice decades after her wealthy Austrian family lost everything. It's an incredible story. What if your beloved aunt, a woman who cherished and adored as a child, was the subject of one of the world's most famous modern paintings? Imagine that  painting was stolen from your family and you are the rightful owner. What if that painting was sitting in an Austrian museum for public view as a beloved symbol of Austria? This is the story of Maria Altmann's battle to gain possession of her legacy.
Helen Mirren stars as Maria so there is no doubt Mirren will give a striking performance and viewers will not be disappointed. Ryan Reynolds co-stars as her young and up and coming lawyer Randy Schoenberg. Maria and Randy have an often caustic relationship. Maria seems to be content with an apology from the museum and Austrian government whereas Randy sees the potential financial windfall from this priceless work of art. Eventually the two come to terms in the battle for justice. Mirren and Reynolds have age defying chemistry that works so well in this film.
It is an amazing true story of heartbreak and determination. The flashbacks to the backstory--Maria's happy childhood and memories of her beloved Aunt Adele Bloch-Bauer fill the screen. Then the Nazis invade Austria and life for Jewish citizens becomes a nightmare. WOMAN IN GOLD is a fascinating historical account of one Jewish family's life in Nazi Austria.  Lovely Tatiana Maslany (ORPHAN BLACK) stars as the young Maria.
Throughout Europe, Jewish families were stripped of their homes and possessions. Valuable artwork was looted and sent to  Nazi homes and museums.  Fortunately, the Portrait Of Adele Bloch Bauer ended up in Vienna's Belvedere Museum where it was safe and became a symbol of Austria.
Maria learns that Austria is offering restitution and to restore works of arts looted during the war, but is it a hollow publicity stunt to hide Austrian guilt over the war? No doubt none of the current Austrian government or museum officials had any responsibility for the theft of the  art but they were left with a legacy of injustice and they had the power to correct it. It is a thought provoking story that inspires us to believe that it is never too late for justice. WOMAN IN GOLD is a remarkable true story that should not be missed.",1453334400,,2578,4.836734693877551

7109688,1,B00VU4YPR4,"On the surface, the film purports to portray Maria Altmann's successful and just campaign to reclaim from the Government of Austria five family-owned paintings by the artist Gustav Klimt stolen by the Nazis during World War II.

Altmann does successfully win the case. In the film, Altmann deceptively suggests that she has found the ideal caretaker for the piece. In reality, she has auctioned the piece off to the highest, private bidder (cosmetics heir Ronald Lauder) for $135 million, at the time the highest sum ever paid for a painting. The fact that Adele Bloch-Bauer (subject of the painting and former owner) had asked her husband in her will to donate the painting to the Austrian State Gallery upon his death is overlooked.

Another reviewer suggests that ""... this is also a story about being a good lawyer. If you want to be a lawyer someday, this story will give you an idea what a determined and intelligent lawyer can accomplish!"" By excluding key facts, this is the viewpoint being pushed by the makers of the film. But when one considers that the lawyer in question successfully pulled the piece out of state museum care contrary to Adele Bloch-Bauer's wishes and set a precedent that may prevent states or museums from repatriating such pieces in the future, I beg to differ and encourage viewers to not swallow the film's altruistic vision of Altmann and her lawyer in such a wholesale manner.

I don't take issue with Altmann's claim to the art pieces; I do take issue with the film's propagandist approach to the story and its lack of truthfulness, painting if you will a very rosy picture of Altmann's actions without analyzing the ethics of selling off looted plunder to the highest bidder -- particularly when such actions would on the surface seem to run contrary to the Bloch-Bauer's wishes and may in fact compromise the ability of states to repatriate plundered art in the future to their rightful owners.",1453161600,5,1934,4.8545454545454545

7109723,2,B00VU4YPR4,"I think you have to be pretty dull to like this film. Think and say what you like about the Nazis, the mere fact that the Nazis took over Austria does not mean every piece of misplaced art in Austria was stolen by them. The real issues at stake in this movie is whether or not certain works of art that did belong to a certain Jewish family ended up in a gallery by theft or deliberately, by the will of that Jewish family,. and whether that family had any right to reclaim that art under international law.

The art was returned, as depicted in this film, to a surviving member of this Jewish family, by virtue of due process of the law, and that is what this film should be about - the drama of due process of the law in recovering this art, but instead the filmmakers chose to vilify the Nazis, as well as treat present day Austrians as little better than Nazis. Little of the legal action in this film, especially the court scenes, bears any semblance to genuine court procedures, which in themselves can be very dramatic. Hollywood chose the cheap thrill, for dunces, of making this film all about Jews vs. Nazis over the more dramatic truth of a nuanced and high-stakes legal battle.",1451865600,,1189,4.404545454545454

7109751,5,B00VU4YPR4,"What a fabulous movie!  It is so beautifully done, with the flashbacks lending a richness and depth to the modern part of the story.  The fact that it is a true story makes it even more compelling.  Ryan Reynolds was awesome in the part of the young lawyer who risked everything in his attempt to get back the paintings for his client from whom they had been stolen by the Nazis.  Helen Mirren as the elderly Jewish Holocaust survivor Maria Altmann is commanding, at times hilarious, and at times stricken by the painful memories.  Both Reynolds and Mirren should win awards for their amazing portrayals in this film.  What struck me was that so many years after the Jews were so horrifically abused by the Nazis, even today the Austrian government was reluctant to do the right thing and provide restitution of items that it had stolen from the Jews, this time ostensibly because there was so much money involved.  It brought home the fact that the Jewish people are still having to fight for the justice that should have been freely given to them.  It is almost unbelievable that these injustices still go on, but it is inspiring that there continue to be those willing to fight to rectify them.",1451088000,,1197,4.639810426540285

7109776,3,B00VU4YPR4,"It's a great story that deserves a much better screenplay, and a much better film. And to me, the problem is Helen Mirren, who is totally unconvincing as an elderly Jewish woman with a fire in her belly. Because there is no fire. This role is screaming out for the real deal, not a polite performance from a British actress doing a bad accent. I didn't believe her for a second. There is not one minute in this film where I felt I was watching a genuine portrayal of an authentic, driven Jewish woman on a mission to set dreadful wrongs right. The late Anne Bancroft could have been great in this. It's watchable, but disappointing, considering the extraordinary facts.",1450224000,2,669,4.583333333333333

After watching the movie, I was kind of dissapointed.
It was very slow and boring. Nothing to remember after the show.
The acting was good but there's no side plot except the main charactor achieving what she wants.
I expected something more like love, friendship or life experience changing her life and so on,.....
I don't think I will watch this movie again.

7109819,5,B00VU4YPR4,"This is a very engaging film with another superb performance by Helen Mirren. It has what a good movie should have. A wonderful story. Characters to care about. Beautiful scenes. Emotion. Like many good films, it ends a little too soon.

I found Ryan Reynolds weak as an actor and Katie Holmes' character someone the film could have done without. The scene where she has begun to go into labor and is cool and calm while her husband loses it has already been done too many times on screen. It did not move the story forward in any way and slowed it down. Nevertheless, I highly recommend Woman in Gold. There are only a few moments that are in the least boring and those seem to be the ones in Los Angeles when Helen MIrren is not on screen. We also loved the behind the scenes segments that were on the DVD.

Incidentally, it was very helpful that we watched The Rape of Europa before seeing this.",1449100800,,898,4.37125748502994

I loved it!  Helen Mirrin's acting, as always, was exceptional and Ryan Reynolds was just fine as the somewhat inexperienced young attorney who ultimately and with energy and passion believed in the mission to get Adele Bloch-Bauer's glorious portrait back to her family.

Gustav Klimt's ""The Kiss"" is now in the Belvedere in Vienna where ""Woman in Gold"" once resided.  Let us hope that the Austrians, who were so intransigent when they were asked to return a stolen piece of art to its rightful owner, are satisfied to look at ""The Kiss"" and the other Klimt works that are in Vienna.",1449100800,,673,4.677966101694915

7109865,5,B00VU4YPR4,"The acting, all about the acting, well the story too. This is Helen Mirren's movie. I do admit that I was set for another WWII story-line movie. Yes, WWII is relevant as it is the onset of the story. But this movie is so much more. It is the (real) story of a conflicted woman, the story of exile under the worst of circumstances, love, survival, betrayal of country fellowman, of loss, of how humans can be so unkind.  So the painting is the medium to elicit the conflict, not the story. And yes Helen Mirren's portrayal is so pure, naive, angry, tainted, a survivor but at what cost....She (her character) becomes the story. It is hard to leave her behind once the credits roll.",1449014400,,680,4.44

7109904,5,B00VU4YPR4,"A great movie that brings out the links between the present and the past, art and life, and brings a very human face to the art restitution movement.  The Nazis stripped Jewish people of their lives and belongings and carried off the greatest heist in history with thousands of paintings, millions of dollars worth of jewelry, furs, and other rare valuables.  Helen Mirren is a gem as Maria Altmann, the woman who seeks to gain restoration of what belongs to her, confronting an Austrian government that seeks to block her from doing so.  Ryan Reynolds is very sensitive as her family friend and lawyer, who seeks not only to win his client's claims, but to give her back her dignity.  The supporting players are well-acted as well.  I absolutely love Antje Traue who is beautiful and graceful as Adele Bloch Bauer, and Tatiana Maslany who plays Maria as a young woman.  A moving portrayal of the effects of Nazism on Austrian society as well.  Like Schindler's List, it reflects both the good and the bad and that is important.",1448409600,,1028,4.709497206703911

This was my first Amazon rental and I had so much buffering early in the movie that I debated turning it off & was thinking I wouldn't rent again. A day or two later I received an e-mail from Amazon saying they'd noticed I had trouble viewing the rental and were refunding me the rental price. Not only was I impressed that they did this without me even mentioning a problem but it told me my experience wasn't the norm and convinced me not to give up on renting again just yet. Great job Amazon!",1447804800,,750,4.172413793103448
7109981,5,B00VU4YPR4,"I sometimes get burned out with movies about World War II because my husband and I have watched so many. With some hesitancy I agreed to purchase this film and watch it with my husband because he wanted to see it. I absolutely loved the film, especially because it was based on a true story. It is so great to see victims of the Nazis prevail, even if it take quite some time after the end of the war. I could not believe that the Austrians would so stubbornly hang on to these valuable paintings that had been taken from this Austrian family during the war. These victims, surprise surprise, happened to be wealthy Jewish citizens who were model citizens of Austria and who did not deserve the treatment that they got from the Nazis or from their fellow Austrian neighbors. I especially enjoyed the performances by Helen Mirren and Ryan Reynolds. Both were excellent. I am happy that films are still being made and that we are being reminded that we can never forget the atrocities that took place during World War II at the hands of the Nazis. It is also good to see films being made that appeal to us older movie viewers.",1447804800,,1124,4.461165048543689

7109997,4,B00VU4YPR4,"I had read and was fascinated by Anne-Marie O'Connor's book The Lady in Gold before this movie was made. I found the story to be so
compelling that I had high hopes for the movie. Ryan Reynolds was a curious choice, in my opinion, to play such an important role. I think the movie suffers most of all for the lack of a better actor in his place. His attempt to portray outrage when Maria wants to give up seemed like a
high school drama episode. He seems confused about where he is.
Katie Holmes has little to work with in her scenes, and they are pretty dull. Helen Mirren is wonderful, but the humor in the film seems forced. Some spoilers follow, so you may want to stop reading here if you haven't seen the film.
Some of the information in the film is at odds with the book, and all of the family, apparently, was not pleased with the sale of the painting of Adele. It is a little curious to me why Maria would go to all the trouble to get the painting, then sell it to be displayed in New York, when she lived in LA.  I would want it close enough that I could go see it often, especially when her aunt Adele seemed to mean a lot to her. But the painting belonged to the family, so that's up to them.
Adele, the woman in the painting has the allure of Victorine Meurent in Manet's Olympia, or, as the film suggests, the model in the Mona Lisa. Who are these captivating women? Certainly, the little we see of Adele in the movie gives a glimpse as to what may have inspired Klimt.
The final scenes in the film, while somewhat melodramatic, were moving, as Maria returns to the apartment in Vienna where she lived before
leaving Austria to escape the Nazis. In spite of the movie's weaknesses, I would recommend both it and the book based on the power of the story.",1447632000,,1767,4.227810650887574

Woman in Gold adds substantially to the Holocaust film genre as it tells a complex tale of injustice and restitution, all writ in politics.

This moving film brings to life the true life story of this family and of the final restitution on some level of the unforgivable crimes committed against them. That these crimes were continued on by the Austrian government and the museum officials who illegally acquired or really stole the painting is disgusting. You will be moved to see that justice was finally done. I'm so happy this painting is in the US in NYC now.  I'm going to go to see it again soon. Several of my family members were also murdered in the holocaust so this was a very emotional story for me. I plan to use this painting as an example in my teaching also now which will not only teach people about a great artist, Gustav Klimt, but also about the Altmann family and this real life historical event of justice finally winning out. I'm SO glad someone cared enough to fight those horrible people and to stand up to them and win and I'm delighted that those paintings and Adele are no longer in Austria.",1447200000,,1110,4.463054187192118

7110088,5,B00VU4YPR4,"Stylish, engrossing film about the fight to have a famous painting returned to its rightful owner, many years after it was stolen during the Nazi era. I liked the pacing, and the way the story unfolded, with many flashbacks to a different time, showing the angst and danger that had to be dealt with as the Nazis and Austrian collaborators began to mistreat the Jewish people. The fight to get the painting back is almost too much for the rightful owner to bear. She has to deal with her crushing feelings of anger and resentment towards people in the past, the country that betrayed her, the bureaucrats blocking her way for justice. Great cast. I think anyone interested in history, art, maybe even law, might enjoy it.",1447027200,,721,4.68503937007874

7110117,4,B00VU4YPR4,"""Woman in Gold"" features an arresting performance by the estimable Helen Mirren in an important, but otherwise stolid, motion picture.  The real story concerns the theft by the Nazis of the art of Austria's Jewish population and the subsequent efforts of the heirs of the owners to get back their treasure from an Austrian government that wished to keep it.  As a movie, ""Woman in Gold"" flickers to life only during the brief flashbacks that illuminate the humiliations suffered by Jewish families as the Nazis came to power, abetted by nonJewish Austrians.  Regretably, Ryan Reynolds, who plays the lawyer who risked his financial well-being to help get a trove of Klimt paintings returned, and the legal wrangling that occupies much of the movie are arid in the extreme.  Still, the film tells an important and largely true story that well deserves your time.",1446940800,,861,5.0

7110207,4,B00VU4YPR4,"Great movie! I love the art, the flashbacks, and the courtroom drama. They displayed it happening well over years, which was nice instead of rushing it into one year. I only took off a star for a technicality. The subtitles were too small and and well enough spaced, that my mother, who can see pretty clearly from far away, had a really hard time reading what the actors were saying. It really subtracted from the experience when she's learning over the chair and we have to pause it for me to read it aloud to her.",1446163200,,516,4.385416666666667

7110363,4,B00VU4YPR4,"Somewhere in my past I owned several reproductions of the work of Austrian artist, Gustav Klimt including the titled portrait.  That one is now in the possession of a former spouse I believe.  I didn't know any of the background but always liked Klimts work.  In this true story, the woman was Adele Block-Bauer (Antje Traue, Man of Steel).  She was the aunt of Maria Altmann who is played by the great Helen Mirren in contemporary 1998 and by Tatiana Maslany (Orphan Black) as a young Austrian Jew in the age of Hitler.

The older Maria engages a struggling attorney named Randy Schoenberg (a game but miscast Ryan Reynolds, Safe House).  Randy is the son of one of Marias best friends and Maria wants him to make a claim of reacquiring the painting that was stolen during the Nazis takeover of Austria which including the confiscation of property and wealth of the Jewish population.  The painting was owned by Traue and her husband and is now the property of the Austrian government.

The film is directed by Simon Curtis (My Week with Marilyn) and has a nice mix of the older Maria and Randy fighting the Austrians and the much better flashback scenes focusing on the younger Maria and her fighting the Nazis.  Although the script labors at times, especially the modern scenes, it has enough heart tugging to get viewers emotionally involved.  I also enjoyed the courtroom scenes, brief as they are, which includes Randy arguing his case before the U. S. Supreme Court.

I for one wasn't aware of the story, so was a bit in the dark as to the real life outcome.  I doubt you will be surprised.  While there are better films that deal with similar subject matter (e.g. Philomena), I found the film to be satisfying on many levels.",1444780800,,1733,4.642622950819672

7110374,3,B00VU4YPR4,"I have not seen the movie but I have gone thru what she is fighting for - the return of her family's things that were stolen during the take over of Austria prior to the start of WWII. 5 years ago, I almost died in a hospital in Hawaii while I was taking care of my mother's financial and medical affairs. I woke up in late March 2010 and found out that I almost died and had severe vitamin deficiencies. My sister, Debra contacted me and asked me to come to Idaho and I agreed. She saved my life. If I had gone back to Mobile, AL to recover, I likely would be dead. I would not know who to trust.
What we were not told in April 2010 was that someone walked into a Regions bank in Mobile, AL and showed no ID, no written documentation, changed the address fraudulently, removed me from my mother's and my checking account covered by a Durable Power of Attorney fraudulently and helped 3 women steal over $41,000.00.
We still have not recovered the money or our family things stolen. We also found out that a thief at the bank was helping the 3 women steal the money not just from the bank but from our mother's portable safe which was at least $30,000.00. Mom was also admitted to one hospital in Mobile, AL 5 times and my sister, Debra was listed on the Hippa Release 5 times but we were only called once. Why? She was diagnosed with Alzheimer's and put into a nursing facility in Mobile, AL and the doctors would not speak with me due to my name not being on the call-out sheet which proved to be fraudulent. She was also put on hospice care and we were not told until 3 to 4 months after our mother's death, Mar 19, 2011 of which we were not told for 4 days. She disappeared for 3 months and we did not know where until a week before her death. I told mom that she was being moved to Idaho. She agreed and was happy to speak with me. A week later she was dead and we were not told of her death for 4 day.

We flew home to make arrangements and found out about the theft, fraud, forgery and contacted the fraud dept of the bank. What a joke he was. Still no full refund from him today nor given any pictures or written documentation from the change of address April 2010. Regarding the movie, I do plan to see it. I am interested in WWII and we should never forget the evil actions of others. I also hope that she was able to forgive those in Austria also as I am trying to forgive those at the bank, the 3 women who stole the money and our family's things, the cops, the former DA who received a fraudulent report from the bank and the cop who took the report. If your love one goes into a hospital, nursing facility or hospice and the personnel will not speak with you even though you identify yourself as the individual in charge of your love one financial and medical affairs. Call the cops and say that your love one has been kidnapped and is at the location of where you called pronto. Likely they have been and someone is stealing your love one's property and money.",1444608000,,2975,4.173913043478261

I found Helen Mirren and Ryan Reynolds well cast as the old Jewish woman and the young, inexperienced lawyer who together take on the Austrian government for restitution of the beautiful family heirloom painting by Klimt which was stolen by the Nazis. The flashback scenes to the 1920s and 30s were chilling. The courtroom scenes had great tension. My favorite scene, however, is when Randy attends a concert of music by his grandfather, Arnold Schoenberg, and finally ""gets it."" Helen Mirren delights me every time, and she did not disappoint in this film.",1444348800,,650,4.761061946902655

The events are true, the painting does hang in the Lauder's museum and problems and denials by the Austrian government to thwart the  return of the paintings to the rightful owner.  The effects of the Holocaust on the children and grandchildren of Holocaust victims and survivors is touched on and in one scene; the great grandson of a famous composer is overcome with emotion at the realization his Great-grandparents were victims of the Holocaust.

It concerns a woman who escaped Austria after her house had been invaded by Nazis during WWII. All of her possessions, including the Klimt painting of her dear aunt, were confiscated. The story starts in a cemetery where Maria is eulogizing her sister Louisa. The story of the present--her struggle to get her possessions back--is told against flashbacks to her life in Austria, youngest daughter in a wealthy family. Maria travels to Austria to meet with officials there. They present obstacle after obstacle. Her young lawyer, Randy Schoenberg, grandson of composer Arnold Schoenberg, is about to give up--until he sees the names of his great-grandparents on the Holocaust memorial, and suddenly it's his story as much as it is Maria's.

And the lovely clothes, explained by the fact she owns a clothing boutique??  Please. She can't help it. She's lovely, she's stylish, and the actress we love to watch.

Helen Mirren was exceptionally good in this movie and Ryan Reynolds did a great job, as well.

7110447,5,B00VU4YPR4,"This is such a beautifully made and substantial film. Ms Mirren is fantastic as an elegant, older expat Austrian jewish woman on a mission to restore and repatriate a family heirloom ripped away from the family during the height of the nazi occupation of Vienna.  Obviously, along the way... there will be what will involve digging up old wounds and recalling painful memories....it is based on a true story.  Ryan Reynolds, what can I say but not one of my favorite actors... usually too wooden and contrived but utterly bearable in this movie. In fact I think he actually does a great job with the role.

Definitely worth a watch, i ended up watching it twice!",1444176000,,662,4.689655172413793

7110491,5,B00VU4YPR4,"I was amazed at how this film reached out at me from the screen to watch it.  I was touched by the fantastic performances of both stars, especially Helen Mirren.

I did not think that this period in time of history could be told again with a fresh and different framework, and I was very wrong.

This movie could be thought of in metaphors also.  Example: do what is right, go back and face the past, hold people accountable, get justice, and when you face that past: only then can you put it to rest.

And done with dignity.  BRAVO!!!",1443484800,,535,4.3

7110642,5,B00VU4YPR4,"It's curious that a film with art at the center  isn't a very artsy.  I may be among the minority but the Gustav Klimt portrait that the film derives its title from didn't intrigue me.  The film is, however, a nifty legal drama with two compelling lead performances.  Helen Mirren has been so consistently reliable throughout her career that her stellar work on display here shouldn't be surprising.  With few dramatic flourishes Mirren gives an understated account of Maria Altmann, a woman who in her quietly steadfast way is not so much seeking justice but some semblance of closure from the atrocities visited upon not only her but her family.  The real surprise here is Ryan Reynolds whom I normally associate with light comedy.  Given the chance to work opposite an artist of Mirren's caliber Reynolds rises to the occasion and ups his game.  Reynolds character Randy Schoenberg evolves subtly through the course of the film going from a man with mercenary intentions to one who advocates justice not only for the surviving  but also those who perished at the hands of the Nazis.  ""Woman in Gold"" is an excellent example of why this chapter in history should never be forgotten.",1442707200,,1184,4.845771144278607

For the description I've used, horror & horrible, it is not a horror movie. Don't mean to mix people up but I just thought the story that was told was just down right ""horrible"".

7110687,4,B00VU4YPR4,"There's a lot to like about this film, for me at least.  The recovery of art looted by the Nazis is a subject that fascinates me, and this particular story revolving around one of the most famous works of art of the late 19th century, and the long campaign by Maria Altmann to claim the Klimt portrait of her aunt, Adele Bloch-Bauer, more commonly known as ""Woman in Gold,"" is, I think, particularly interesting because it underscores the politics of the art world in rather a damning way.  That said, I think I might have given less time to the story of her lawyer, Randol Schoenberg, and more to the story of the painting and Altmann, from the time of the Anschluss in 1938, to the moment when Altmann finally claims it as her own.  Granted, the entire screenplay is based on Schoenberg's biography, and granted, he did a wonderful job of representing Altmann's interests, but ultimately this should have been the story of the lives destroyed and the art held hostage.

Apart from all that though, another draw for me was the cast.  I love Helen Mirren and would watch her in anything.  As Maria Altmann, she is brittle, difficult, bitter, and ultimately vulnerable.  She is a woman who has lost too much, seen too much, to have patience with people's nonsense.  She wants something of her life back.  She wants to claim something of her past and the people she loved and lost.  I also love Tatiana Maslany, and she too gives a wonderful performance, though has much less to do in the flashback scenes than I would have hoped.

All things considered, it's not a great film, but it's one that I enjoyed.  If you have any interest at all in the subject matter, I suspect you will too.  Beyond that, I'd say it's probably a bit slow for viewers who want a Nazi-filled adventure in which the good guys triumph.  They do, ultimately, but with laws, not guns.",1442361600,5,1855,4.548192771084337

Surprisingly the story is not depressing, but moves along smartly with moments of humor.  Helen Mirren turns in another impeccable performance as an elderly survivor in search of her family's dignity.  Ryan Reynolds sheds his ""pretty boy next door"" image as a slightly geeky, but talented young attorney.

7110842,4,B00VU4YPR4,Klimt is one of my favorite painters and I really wanted to fall in love with this film.  I loved Helen Mirren - as always- but this film was lacking in it's production design and art direction. The film had the opportunity to play up the visuals - like so many other great films about famous artists -  but instead it relied on a strange palette of light pink and mint green - evident in Helen Mirren's kitchen set - and for some reason carried throughout the film.  The gorgeous work of Klimt and the emotional setting of war time Austria - was a real opportunity for the film's production designer to push the visuals into a feast for the eyes - even if there were hints of gold leaf twinkling throughout the film to tie into the painting itself - verses creating a disjointed combination of pastel hues and rich gold tones.  Ms. Mirren's character should have better represented the work of the artist -showing a connection - even if a visually subconsious one - to the viewing audience.,1441670400,,991,4.488888888888889

7110964,5,B00VU4YPR4,"Beautiful and nuanced film with enough light moments to break up the heaviness of the subject matter. Helen Mirren melted into the character and Ryan Reynolds managed to lose his sexy guy persona and really pulled off the role. The only distraction was a severely miscast Katie Holms. I also am generally not a huge fan of flashback sequences but this film had of the best I've ever seen. It's a poignant film with an upbeat ending and so many painful life lessons.

One of those survivors is wonderfully depicted by actress Helen Mirren, starring in the character of Maria Altmann.  As her story unfolds, she reminisces about  her family during World War II, the past shredded by the Nazis, leaving her with only a thread of hope of retrieving the one endearing possession of the framed image of her aunt.  Accompanied by a young lawyer swayed by her gritty determination to seize what was seized from her over sixty years ago, he enters into a covenant with her against all odds to take on governments and powers to reclaim her heritage.

The movie was a special treat for my wife and I, as we have been to Vienna and recently saw the painting itself in NYC.

What can never be taken from them is their history, their dignity, their God-given place in this world.  This movie shows how one woman's fight continued in that landscape.  Let us never forget what was done to approximately 13 million people and 6 million Jewish people, and how they still struggle today for justice.  Let us never forget the heritage, the families and friends we knew, and their descendants and honor them as appropriately as this movie does.",1440374400,,743,4.857142857142857

7111229,5,B00VU4YPR4,"Well-made, beautiful film.  Fascinating history of how the Nazis not only destroyed lives, but also looted wealthy Jewish homes of their artwork.  This movie illustrates the extent of that Nazi greed.

This story is beautifully told with flashbacks that are well-crafted and suspenseful as Helen Mirren's character, Maria, must escape the encroaching Nazi presence in her previously serene home life in Austria.  Hiring a down-and-out lawyer, nicely played by Ryan Reynolds, Maria begins the years-long journey of acquiring one of the most famous paintings in the world, The Woman in Gold.  The painting is breathtaking and its fascinating to see its beginnings and where it used to humbly hang in Maria's Austrian home.

The film runs a bit slow in places, but is still impressive and worthwhile.  Not only is it an entertaining and endearing story of family and triumph, but it's also a valuable historical film that shows what the Nazis took and what others must pay back years later.",1440288000,,987,5.093167701863354
7111230,4,B00VU4YPR4,Very interesting story. Well acted.,1440288000,,35,6.2
7111231,5,B00VU4YPR4,"Just finished repetitive viewing of ""The Woman in Gold"". I thoroughly enjoyed this film based on the true story about a woman, Maria Altmann (Helen Mirren), and her attorney, Randol Schoenberg (Ryan Reynolds), as they attempt to reclaim ownership of an extremely valuable painting,amongst others from the Austrian government stolen nearly fifty years ago by the Nazis. They are also assisted in their mission by an Austrian journalist.

The acting is wonderful. Helen Mirren is superb as always. Ryan Reynolds pleasantly surprised me with his in depth performance. The extraordinary value of the paintings originally attracted him to the case but emotions took over and he did an 180 degree turn around devoting time,burning midnight oil,studying law as he was inexperienced,fighting this battle based on principal and injustice.

A very strong connection develops between Randol and Maria that grows over time lending further poignancy to this personal story. A thought provoking, entertaining,informative history lesson.

The story,although receiving some criticism regarding exact accuracy was quite straightforward,done with both heartfelt emotion and a sense of humor. There is excellent,easy to follow use of flashbacks that emphasize the importance of the artwork,family history and injustice of this persecution.

Absolutely loved Helen Mirrens handling of key situations. A favorite was when Estee Lauder's son offers her a champion lawyer,labeling Randol a schoolboy who had no knowledge of how to present her case to the Supreme Court. Maria responded by telling Mr Lauder his skilled lawyer could take a hike because she was sticking with her schoolboy.

In spite of the critics negative evaluations the movie deserves ample award recognition. It certainly wouldn't be the first time Hollywood altered a film based on a true story for whatever reason they choose to do so. ""Woman in Gold"" is truly one of the best I've seen in a long time.",1440288000,,1951,5.404605263157895

This film is the dramatization of the process by which Maria obtained her property and those involved in its restoration to its rightful owner.

This is one of those curt reviews that does not do the production justice. However the production is too overwhelming to break down into its components.

Let's just say they picked the right story, the right actors, the right environment etc.

7111282,5,B00VU4YPR4,Ryan Reynold portrayed the attorney who Helen Mirren hired to help her get back a famous painting of her Aunt by Gustav Klimt (1907)which the Austrians people would not relinquish.  This painting of her aunt was taken during WWII.  It took dedication for both the attorney and the Aunt because they had to deal with many political restrictions that generally would make someone to just give up the fight.  This is what made the movie so interesting to see what needs to be done to accomplish a goal.,1440028800,,499,4.6477272727272725

7111302,5,B00VU4YPR4,"As always Helen Mirren shines in this based on true life story about a woman trying to reclaim a Klimt portrait of her beloved aunt from the Austrian government which obtained the masterpiece via the Nazi thieves who stole it in the first place.  Ryan Reynolds also stars as the lackluster attorney ""son of a friend"" who helps her in this endeavor and along the way discovers a passion for his own heritage and for restoring to the jewish victims of the Nazis a modicum of what was stolen from them 80 years ago.

I would have enjoyed the story regardless of whether it was true, but the fact that these things happened just adds to the emotional impact of each event.

Tatiana ""Orphan Black"" Maslany was fantastic as the younger version of Mirren's character, Maria.  I may now actually have to check out that series which has generated so much buzz over the years for her masterful portrayal of several clones(?).

The acting was across the board brilliant, not a dud amongst the crowd.

I would strongly recommend this film for anybody who loves arts, or WWII films, or Triumph of the Underdog type films, or anybody who just loves good storytelling!",1440028800,,1153,4.655172413793103

7111341,3,B00VU4YPR4,"The main reason I did not give this movie 5 stars is the extensive use of sub-titles. They were really hard to read and some of them were important to the story so if you missed them, you missed part of the story.

I loved the views of Vienna, the Belvedere gallery, the huge apartment and the early 20th century costumes and decor. The production design was great to look at, no dark gloomy, obscure scenes. The character portrayals were good. Helen Mirren's Maria was spikey and sad. Ryan Reynolds' character was a bit flat. Why did they make two good looking people look so terrible? Oh, the character Maria is supposed to be old and European (she lost her quite believable Austrian accent after the first 5 minutes), and her clothing and wig got better toward the end but the face makeup was terrible. Reynolds' character is supposed to be a conservative lawyer but how did it add to the story that they both looked so bad? Many of the supporting characters were interesting, especially the guy representing the bureaucracy. He did a good job of being a credible villain yet still sympathetic.",1439856000,,1097,4.654639175257732

The story is interesting in that it deals with Art Restitution of works stolen by the Nazis and the horrors of the Nazi era in Austria.  It is the personal story of Maria Altmann whose aunt Adele Boch-Bauer was the model for one of Gustav Klimt's most famous works.  By living this story through the eyes of Maria, both before, during, and long after the war you are drawn deeply into her extraordinary life and her story touches you in a more personal way.",1439596800,,510,4.462365591397849

7111441,5,B00VU4YPR4,"A wonderful, intriguing film about justice for a Jewish woman and for her family, most of who perished in the Holocaust.  And it's about art, not just any art, but an amazingly gorgeous portrait of a beautiful young woman done by Gustav Klimt.  The portrait was confiscated by the Nazi's after they took over Austria. With out giving away the story and all of it's very interesting twists and turns, let's just say it's a wonderful, suspenseful film that touches the heart.  Helen Mirren gives an excellent performance. Will justice prevail? Will family property rights and family history sway the courts to do the correct thing?  You'll have to watch this thought-provoking film to learn the answers to those important questions!",1439596800,,730,5.008264462809917

I don't understand why film critics are so harsh - their mean spirited reviews keep people from watching - but the ""star"" rating system which comes from the general public on sites like this always proves to be very accurate when it comes to assessing a movie's watchability. This is a tremendously enjoyable and important movie. I knew the whole story - had read the articles and seen the news bits about this case and yet I was still riveted by the outcome. Helen Mirren is a treasure. I encourage everyone to watch this movie, especially as we move farther and farther away from the Holocaust.

7111507,5,B00VU4YPR4,"I watched this movie multiple times, each time noticing additional details.  Of course, Helen Mirren is wonderful, but the rest of the movie is so well-done.  It reinforces the importance of information that is so significant in this world's sometimes horrid past.  It's hard to believe that the stain of WWII horrors continue to this day.",1439424000,,339,5.017857142857143

7111516,4,B00VU4YPR4,Very good movie.  I would recommend it.  If you like The Monument Men about the treasures from WW II you will enjoy this case of attempting to recover a Painting that was stolen by the Nazi Government from families after being invaded.  It is not a depressing movie about the Holocaust.,1439337600,,286,4.568627450980392

The story is how she tried  to retrieve her sisters painting that was stolen by the Nazi during WW11.  This is a story I recall reading about when it happened.  To be able to watch this story unfold with all the added facts was very, very interesting.",1439164800,,396,4.24

Unlike when Helen Mirren played Queen Elizabeth, this role allowed her to express a range of emotions and she does it in her usual stellar fashion.  The flashbacks really make the movie.  They draw you in and really, make the history come alive.  This is just a wonderful movie.",1439164800,,411,4.828571428571428

7111630,5,B00VU4YPR4,"Helen Mirren portrays the feisty Maria Altmann in ""Woman in Gold,"" directed by Simon Curtis, with a script by Alexi Kaye Campbell.  The film is based on a protracted legal battle that took eight years to resolve.  Mrs. Altmann, 82, asks a family friend, E. Randol (Randy) Schoenberg, to help her reclaim paintings by Gustav Klimt, including the 1907 work, ""Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I,"" that had been stolen by Hitler's henchmen from Maria's uncle in Vienna shortly after the Anschluss. Randy, a young man with a growing family, puts his promising career on hold to help Maria, who insists, ""We should be reunited with what is rightfully ours.""

Much has been written about filmmakers altering facts for dramatic purposes.  In ""Woman in Gold,"" when Maria and her husband, Fritz, flee the Nazis, they did not do so precisely as depicted by Curtis and Campbell.  However, the film is faithful to the spirit of Maria and Randy's remarkable story.  Ryan Reynolds and Helen Mirren make the most of their scenes together. When they disagree, sparks fly, but over time, their mutual respect grows and their affection for one another deepens. Daniel Brhl is very good as the Austrian investigative journalist Hubertus Czernin, a man who provides advice and assistance that prove invaluable to Maria and Randy. All of the actors, including those in minor roles, turn in fine performances. The Austrian bureaucrats and lawyers opposing Altmann's suit are smug, hypocritical, and frostily polite.  They are reluctant to give up a prized painting that they consider to be their country's Mona Lisa.

Curtis makes liberal use of flashbacks to capture Maria's recollections of her comfortable life in Vienna; her joyous and lavish wedding; and her tender relationship with her uncle, aunt, and parents--followed by her family's humiliation and oppression at the hands of their Nazis persecutors. Helen Mirren is magnificent.  Her facial expressions, diction, and body language contribute to her indelible portrait of a strong-willed, intelligent, and courageous woman. Although she suffers from survivor's guilt, Maria knows that, to avoid becoming bitter, she must move on and live her remaining years in a way that would have made her mother and father proud.",1439078400,,2251,5.196132596685083

7111639,4,B00VU4YPR4,"Well done movie.  I actually thought it could last a bit longer since the number of years involved bringing this to court were only briefly brushed over.  It seemed that the time between taking the Austrians to court to the presentation before the Supreme Court could have had more time spent with it.

Helen Mirren was wonderful and while many don't think Ryan Reynolds was the right actor to do the job, I felt he fit the role well.  The fact Reynolds is always known as either a comedian or an action movie had to be tossed to the wind and he did well playing a role that went against his usual efforts.  Further,  Randy seemed to be someone who really was out of his element, but he was able to overcome that preconceived notion to really grow as he went from success to success in his effort to successfully bring this case to a satisfactory conclusion.  The interaction between the two actors was spot on.  Helen Mirren would be successful in anything she does.  Ryan Reynolds had to act against type and I think he did well.",1438992000,,1031,4.441489361702128

I also like Ryan Reynolds but this was clearly not a role that was good for him.  I appreciated that the horrors of WWII and the Nazi regime with Jews, in this case Austria, did not become the dominant issue.....but the emotional trauma of trying to regain the painting, and the emotions the painting evoked because of her family's ownership just didn't come across.  The subsequent symbolism was likewise weak",1438992000,,596,4.60377358490566

had been stolen by the Nazi's over 60 years past including the painting by 'Gustav Klimt' of 'Maria's aunt 'Adele'
known as 'The Woman in Gold'
'Marie' in going back to Vienna will re-visit many emotional memories of her childhood and indeed young adult-
hood, a city that she'd fled after the Germans occupied the city.
'Maria' and her young lawyer will embark upon a battle which will take them both to the 'American Supreme Court'
and indeed the 'Austrian Establishment'
The young lawyer will seemingly reach beyond his legal capability to pursue the case and will risk everything to do so.
In 'Vienna' they are helped by 'Hubertus Czernin' (Daniel Bruhl)
A well-portrayed drama that pays great detail to the fashions of the War-Years (frequently revisited in 'Maria's' memory
flash-backs.
'Helen Mirren' as always, magnificent in the role of 'Maria' well supported by 'Ryan Reynolds' as the young lawyer.
'Charles Dance' is also among the cast-list as 'Randy's' boss 'Sherman' at the Law-Firm along with 'Katie Holmes' as
'Randy's' wife 'Pam'

Woman in Gold is an important film and an important reminder of what the Nazis took from Europe - and what is still missing or under false ownership. The documentary Rape of Europa outlined the extent of the Nazi theft, but this film shows what it meant on a personal level as much of the art was looted from private collections.  For a fictional, but deeply researched story with a similar plot, read Daniel Silva's book The Rembrant Affair.",1438819200,,520,4.473684210526316

I would recommend it for anyone interested in World War II, in art history, in the Holocaust, or in the legal system.  The actors were perfect in their roles and you will feel good at the end.

7111758,3,B00VU4YPR4,"Fascinating story and a couple of good performances are undermined by some sticky script problems, especially when it comes to character motivations. Several characters simply change their minds at critical moments without really giving any reason. The worst is poor Katy Holmes as the wife. She flip flops between negative and positive like a desperate politician. Even the main characters have an unfortunate tendency to turn on a dime solely for a ""surprise"" change of heart. If you can forgive these lapses, there are Helen Mirren, Vienna, some heart-rending flashbacks and a brilliant performance by Orphan Black star, Tatiana Maslany.",1438819200,,640,5.41

The author paints a vivid picture of Vienna in its glory days, then relates the horrid mistreatment of Jews as they had everything of value, including their dignity, stolen from them.  In the midst of it all there is complicity among some as they try to hold on to their families or businesses.  The characters are vivid and portrayed as who and what they were rather than being romanticized and made to appear perfect people.  It was refreshing to read a real story with a beginning, a middle and an end.  I bought the book in hardcover so I could both share it and also read it again.",1438646400,,656,4.344262295081967

This movie, however, addresses the injustices done to Jews that were never in the camps but still suffered great losses.  The story is true.  The protagonist is  Maria Altmann, a Jewish refugee living in America whose family was robbed of everything they owned by the Nazis, including valuable art.  Six decades after the war ended the art was housed in the Belvedere, an Austrian-owned art museum, which refused to return the pieces to Maria, claiming they were willed to the Museum by Maria's aunt.  Maria knows that her uncle, who died after her aunt, willed all of his belongings, including the art, to his heirs, however. She hires a young attorney, Randy Schoenberg, grandson of the famous Viennese composer Arnold Schoenberg, and takes the Belvedere to court.",1438473600,,908,5.101351351351352

7111860,4,B00VU4YPR4,History is not allowed to be buried in this taut view of what it means to survive. Joy surfaces while watching a Jewish woman speak up about the insanity that often shifts history and in this case her life. The next generation joins her cause.  What I contemplate is how individuals must take on the group. Golding in Lord of the Flies supports the idea that one good character can prevail over evil. Hurrah for hope.,1438473600,,417,4.4868421052631575

7111867,5,B00VU4YPR4,"Wonderful ""Weinstein Company"" film starring Academy Award-winning Helen Mirren, and also terrific was Ryan Reynolds as the intrepid young attorney who successfully represented the late Maria Altmann in Altmann v. Austria, a true story of the recovery of Nazi-looted art.  Director Simon Curtis does a great job, as does Katie Holmes in an under-written part as attorney E. Randol Schoenberg's wife, and mother of their child.  Also worth watching is Daniel Bruhl, a Spanish-born German actor who is always terrific -- as he was in the film-within-a-film of the Nazi sniper in Quentin Tarantino's ""Inglorious Basterds.""

True story here, moving, beautifully filmed,particularly the filming in Vienna, Austria.

The status of ""art recovery"" all over the world is worth following, and caring about.  Ronald Lauder, head of the Museum of Modern Art in NYC, refers to these art works as ""the last prisoners of war of WWII.""  We're with him!

Finally, if you know of museums and/or governments that are holding onto art works stolen by the Nazis during the Holocaust, let them know in no uncertain terms that they simply must return these beautiful things to their rightful owners -- even if it hurts.

Enjoy this unique film.  When we saw it in the theater, there wasn't a dry eye in the house!  We've since bought the Blu Ray version, here on amazon.com, and enjoy it very much, including the special features included on the DVD and Blu Ray.",1438387200,,1438,4.97907949790795

Characters were poorly developed, and I never really felt much connection with either of the main characters. I love Helen Mirren, but perhaps because of the script writing, I did not find this to be one of her most compelling performances. It was still worth a watch simply to learn about this wonderful painting and also the plight of the Jewish people who still lack justice in seeing the return of their belongings.",1438387200,,536,4.774193548387097

I know the background of the story quite well, and also from a personal view. I was born in Vienna, and we luckily were able to leave for the U. S.at the end of 1939 when I was eightt years old. We also had to leave many things behind, and the Austrians, being what they are, lied about the value of that property. We could have received more, had we agreed to return to Vienna, but we declined that ""generous"" offer. The Austrians were worse than the Germans, and they have shown their true nature many times since the end of the war.

The continued fight by Jews to receive their due.  That this wonderful woman got her justice and due made my day.  May the others receive theirs, also.

She works very hard but makes her performance seem effortless.  I was most surprised by Ryan Reynolds' performance.  I'm used to seeing him in comedies but he really brought out the conflict of his character.  He worked hard to help us understand the conflict his character was going through.  Last but definitely not least is the performance by Daniel Bruhl.  I saw him in Rush and, quite frankly, I thought he outdid the performance of Chris Helmsworth.  (Unfortunately, that may not be a fair assessment. ;-)  Mr. Helmsworth was playing a degenerate playboy.)  I was happy to see Mr. Bruhl in this movie and I hope we see a lot more of him in future.

It's historical authenticity is beyond question--Nazi Austria, the looting of Jewish property, in this film artwork, by the bestial Nazis, is irrefutable.  This is a 5 star movie which is a remarkable true story of a survivor who fights to regain family art--and wins.",1437955200,,440,4.905405405405405

Only recently have some of these painting been starting to returned to their rightful owners/families. As always, Helen Mirren is spot on with her portrayal of this woman, and Ryan Reynolds is great as her attorney.  It's well worth watching and you won't be disappointed.  You might even learn something about this process of returning/fighting to return these paintings, and just what a fight it can be.",1437955200,,543,4.880434782608695
7112029,4,B00VU4YPR4,The film was of historic & emotional interest. Well played out and the frustration of the victims was felt throughout the film. The ending put it all in place & righted a wrong that should never have happened. Hopefully never will history repeat itself in this manner again. The disappointment was the delivery of the streaming. We were not able to watch more than 30 mins. of the film on Friday night. The HD  quality we paid for was not delivered. We had to set aside some time on the following day to finish watching which was really inconvenient. We have the highest speed modem  just to be certain that there are no interruptions like this.

7112030,5,B00VU4YPR4,This was a good story told well.  I am wondering why it didn't get much attention when it played in the theaters.  Mirren always delivers and this is one of her best.  It is reminiscent of Philomena.  If you liked that film.  You'll like this one as well.  It has a similar structure - older woman gets help by a younger man who then gets invested in her story.,1437955200,,361,4.159420289855072

So much property was stolen and luted so much never to be returned to the rightful heirs it was dark and shamful period, I hope it never happens again.

Both Helen Mirren and Ryan Reynolds were excellent.  This movie could have been dull, but both main actors brought the material to such life!  Loved Daniel Bruel also.
