8153087,5,B000JU7JEG,"Origins of the mafia is a great film if you are interested in the power of omerta. I found all the stories to be pretty good, in fact I find myself watching this series more and more,it's true the more you watch movies the more things you discover in each scene,and you won't be disapointed here either. A great addition to the library of any mafia movie collector.",1302566400,,365,4.382352941176471
8153088,1,B000JU7JEG,"This is an interesting movie but has no historical accuracy.  The Mafia formed to protect Sicilian people.  It came to the United States because Sicilian people were being harassed and assaulted and could not get jobs.  It was to prevent Sicilian people from getting harmed and abused.  That's why the Sicilian people supported the Mafia.  Eventually, and unfortunately, it deteriorated into a  criminal organization, which is of popular attraction because there are a lot of people who wish they had what appears to be absolute power over others.  They get it vicariously by watching movies like The Godfather and The Sopranos, or, in a lighter vein, from following the antics of J.R. Ewing.  In Sicily today the government is cracking down on the Mafia. This movie has adventure in it, and Eddie Albert is really handsome, but if you're looking for historical facts, look elsewhere.",1252281600,3,884,5.048275862068966
8153089,3,B000JU7JEG,"This TV series was run on late night ABC TV in the late seventies under the title ""Legend of the Black Hand"".  Each episode is a separate story and each has a different cast.  The series was capitalizing on the Godfather-craze of the times.  Acting and production values were good (not great) for the time, and I kept wishing there had been a second series, which to my knowledge there was not.  The plots become predictable and by today's standards are almost cliche.
Having said that, for some reason, I remember it fondly.",1184025600,4,525,4.612903225806452
