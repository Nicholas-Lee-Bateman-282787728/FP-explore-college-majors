A rating refers to how well made the movie is, and whether or not the director achieved his or her goals.  Is this movie well made?  Absolutely not.  Did the director intend the movie to be comical?  Again, no.  So the movie is (by definition) bad.  You may well enjoy its badness, but that doesn't make it a good (worthy of five stars) movie.  Believe it or not, the world does not revolve around you.",1295827200,,502,4.15625

The movie is full of overacting, corny taglines, and an awesomely conceived main villian.
The movie is about a monster created in a lab, not an alien at all!, that is going around killing people.
The main character,""Mike Reardon"", and his stupid girlfriend are trying to stop it and there is this other guy named ""Quint"" who is trying to kill everyone.
The movie has a storyline that doesn't explain anything, but it moves along the whole time and never drags which is a plus!
Overall I liked the movie as a B-movie fan!",1203033600,7,587,4.444444444444445
