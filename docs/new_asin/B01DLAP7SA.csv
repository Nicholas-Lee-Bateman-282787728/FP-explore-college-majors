7719257,5,B01DLAP7SA,"Restored music, great transfer. I owned the original release and you can tell immediately that Mill Creek put some work into this. The video and audio are both super clear. I was able to pick up Season 1 & 2 for $10. That is crazy. I remember spending way more on Universal's original, lazy releases. Please, Mill Creek, bring the rest of the series out with the same care. I have no problem paying more for quality.",1470009600,5,416,4.415584415584416

7719260,5,B01DLAP7SA,FINALLY! WE CAN HAVE THIS WITH THE RIGHT MUSIC INTACT!! THE WAIT IS OVER AND WE CAN WATCH THIS WONDERFUL SHOW AS IT WAS INTENDED TO BE. THANK YOU MILL CREEK...BRING ON SEASONS 3-5!,1468368000,5,180,4.323529411764706
7719261,5,B01DLAP7SA,"I too have been a fan of Quantum Leap for a long time. After a long drought in not seeing the show, I started watching it again on Cozi TV on Saturday and Sunday nights. Upon watching it again, I realized once again what a wonderful show this was. So I decided that I should get the DVD set and watch it from my own system. Much to my surprise, I found out from many Quantum Leap fan reviewers that MCA Universal had deleted many of the original music songs from their DVD sets from Season 2 on. Many were showing outrage because of this and suggesting to get the
Region 2 set instead as it was overseas and copyright laws were not as stringent over there as they are here. There are even postings from people telling everybody what songs were deleted from each episode. I certainly can understand their anger and I had decided not to buy the MCA Universal sets because of this reason. But another company called MILL CREEK came out just recently with Seasons1 & 2. I have never heard of MILL CREEK before and was hesitant about wanting to buy this set. But for the price they were offering, I decided to order and watch it. Guess what?
All the original music is intact!!! From the lists of people submitting what songs were omitted or deleted, I am here to tell you that this set has them all! It is just like it was when it was shown on television originally. All the episodes are in order as they were shown from these two seasons. There are 6 DVD's for this set (first two for the first year as it was a short year and 4 for the second year). And they are NOT double-sided like the MCA UNIVSERSAL sets are. The picture quality on this set is also outstanding. Looking at it, I thought I was seeing a blue ray version of it. And the sound is good. Though not 5.1, it is stereo as what it was when NBC was showing it. And the price is great
To conclude, thank you MILL CREEK for bringing these first two seasons out with everything intact!! If you want the versions with the original music, great picture and sound quality, buy the MILL CREEK version. If the remaining seasons are like these first two, then we are in for something special. I can't wait!!",1467244800,16,2157,4.276283618581907
7719262,5,B01DLAP7SA,"I want to correct a horrible injustice! I'm POSITIVE that the price of this double season combo-pack will increase
when I write the good news:
THIS IS FULLY-RESTORED and REMASTERED. The sound is stereo, and the video-quality is that of a BLU-RAY.

There are NO deleted songs; there are NO substituted songs. My initial review was derived from O-L-D information.

""Koala1356""..... and..... ""MMC"" are correct... While I do NOT know HOW ""Mill Creek"" DID it... maybe they killed the
COPYRIGHT lawyers, but, indeed[!] I just watched the episode ""Good Morning, Peoria"".... and a-l-l----I repeat ALL----
of the deleted songs in the PREVIOUS ""Universal Studios"" releases are BACK.
It sounds great in stereo, and on MY 55"" Sony screen, it looked like an actual Blu-ray... but, I was using a top-of-the-line,
3D, Panasonic player.

Support MILL CREEK in this endeavor... and pray that there ARE future MILL CREEK releases of this EXCELLENT
TV series!",1466380800,14,940,5.130718954248366
8756368,5,B01DLAP7SA,"This is the edition that was recommended to me and others by Obscurus Lupa.
I have to say, it was clearly done with a lot of love for the fans who still like the show after so much time. The digital restoration on picture and sound is an improvement on the original. You can hear things sharper and the picture quality is vastly improved. That doesn't mean much to most people, but if you are distracted by the quality of the picture and sound, then you will have a harder time enjoying the show.
As for the seasons, the first two seasons were easily the best of the series. In later seasons, you had some more gimmicky premises for the show around historical figures, or it played like a rip off of a popular film. In this case, the shows are pretty fresh with a lot of the stories told. None of the characters feel settled, and the guest actors for the show are generally pretty good.
You'll enjoy the way the shows can feel like a mystery sometimes.",1515456000,,952,4.324022346368715
8756369,5,B01DLAP7SA,Quantum Leap is like the book series as a child Choose your own adventure.,1503619200,,74,4.357142857142857
8756370,5,B01DLAP7SA,Great dvd.  I am enjoying the shows just as much as I did when the series was on.,1502064000,,81,3.5
8756371,5,B01DLAP7SA,"I bought this as a gift for a fellow enthusiast.  This is one of the best and most original TV series of the many I've seen over the years.  Although there is often humor, there is a wonderful sense of compassion as well, and the ""message"" that one person can make a difference in incidents both large and small that affect the world:  the greater world, or the small one of some individual person which is no less important to that person... and may, at some future time, affect the greater world as well.  The only ""science fiction"" aspect is the time travel--and of course the ability to ""inhabit"" another person's life (while that person is temporarily removed to a safe environment, I might add).",1495929600,,701,4.584
8756372,5,B01DLAP7SA,Excellent quality and packaging wasn't too bad.,1495238400,,47,5.857142857142857
8756373,4,B01DLAP7SA,"I honestly didn't see too much of this when it aired, but did vaguely remember what they are about. A man that leaps from a different time, place, and even person! I saw a few of them, an was drawn in at the beginning, but for the story concept of leaping through time and ""saving people"" from uneventful future events, is a serious thing! I thought the concept itself was fantastic! BUT somehow by the 2nd or 3rd episodes I started to lose interest. I thought I may try it again, or a different disc. Just think for such a big idea, some of the story lines fell short. An I thought Dean Stockard could've had more scenes an thought he was more charismatic then the star of the show! So that could be why I put it away for awhile. In fact DEAN should've had the LEAD!! He was only in major movie productions since he was a child! An a very skilled actor at that! Love you Dean!!
If they would've had Rod Serling writing these, it would've been way different !!
I will give it a chance at a later time, maybe I will get into these shows again!",1491004800,,1042,4.163366336633663
