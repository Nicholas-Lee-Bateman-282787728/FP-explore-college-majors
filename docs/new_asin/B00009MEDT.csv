8164706,5,B00009MEDT,"This is one of my favorite Roy and Gabby pictures. None of that goofy ""Oklahoma"" stuff here. Roy is an outlaw working against the carpetbagger government. Gabby is always good and enough of a reason on his own to buy any DVD. Another treat, as always, is Sally Payne as Belle Starr. I love Roy. I love Trigger. I love Gabby. I love Sally Payne. There's no better combination in whatever they do. 5 stars.",1161043200,,404,4.4
