8706770,5,B00UGQJLCQ,"I  own  the  first  2  seasons  of  fantasy  island,  love  them.  I  plan  to  buy  this  season  as  quick  as  the  price  goes  down  a  little  bit,  I  paid  under  20.00  for  season  1  &  around  25.00  for  season  2.  So  I'm  giving  anyone  my  own  heads  up!  If  you  like  shows  with  an  adventure  this  is  a  top  of  the  line  show.  No  violence, No  horror  scenes.  Perfect  for  family's  to  watch.  I  am  happy  to  find  season  3  on  DVD.  I  have  truly  always  enjoyed  this  show.  Absolutely  love  it!
I'll  be  on  the  lookout  for  season  4  as  well!",1471564800,2,595,3.872549019607843
