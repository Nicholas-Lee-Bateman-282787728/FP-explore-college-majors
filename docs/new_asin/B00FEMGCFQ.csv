8614906,4,B00FEMGCFQ,"Wagners mammoth opera tetralogy Der Ring des Nibelungen is impossible to stage perfectly. No one production has all the answers to the multiple problems set by the composer and this Guy Cassiers version for La Scala Milan recorded between 2010 and 2013 is as imperfect as any in the catalogue. However, it does successfully carry out the primary golden rule of any worthy Ring production which is to accentuate the mythology so cutting to the very essence of the piece. On this count alone the production is well worth seeing.

Too many productions attempt to set the Ring in a precise time and place in order to impose some kind of directorial thesis on what the work means to us today. Some of these attempts are trite and laughable while others are stimulating and thought-provoking, but when all is said and done the Ring shouldnt be narrowed down. It is not just a pseudo-GBS parable on 19th century industrialization (Patrice Chreau, Bayreuth 1976). Neither is it just an expos of late 20th century consumerism (Nikolaus Lehnhoff, Munich 1987) or a history of 20th century feminism (Casper Ben Holten, Copenhagen 2006). And it certainly isn't simply a sterile traditional museum piece incarceration of some idealized fake mythic past (Otto Schenk, New York Met 1989). Wagner set his work in timeless mythology because he wanted to accentuate themes and central truths about human nature which stay eternally relevant in any time and in any place. Any production attempting to get to the heart of the piece must ensure that the sets, costumes and props chosen underline this core requirement.

Cassiers stays faithful to the spirit of Wagner with his idea of a wall of myth in which human bodies are entwined together in the manner of an enormous fresco as might have been created by Peter Paul Rubens. These bodies sometimes move and are often static as they make for a perpetually changing fantastic tableau that is revealed in various cunning ways gradually as the Ring plays out. It becomes clear that the characters on stage gradually take their place in this tableau as their lives run their course. Things become crystal-clear at the end of Siegfried which concludes with Brnnhilde and Siegfried singing their hearts out in gray clothing atop a gray Valkyrie rock in front of the (for now) gray wall of myth, their place in mythology miraculously petrified before our very eyes.

Gtterdmmerung charts how devious mankind perverts this mythology for its own selfish ends. In the Norns scene the rock is stripped of mystery as the rope snaps and the wall of myth becomes a hideous showcase of gruesome hacked-up body parts which represents the treacherous world of the Gibichungs. The process by which characters die and take their place in the tableau is shown with amazing clarity in the filmic images projected onto the wall of myth during Siegfrieds funeral march, and indeed this production is full of ever-changing very colorful lighting and projected filmic images which accompany the stage action from beginning to end.

Sometimes things get too complicated and distracting as what we see works against what we hear. Despite all the high-tech Cassiers still cant manage a scary dragon in either Das Rheingold or Siegfried. Even the frog is botched, though Grane makes a rare and very beautiful appearance at the end of Gtterdmmerung. Das Rheingold is the most problematic of the four stagings with only the appearance of Erda rising high above a moon-lit vista of mountains striking the appropriate note of mythic awe. I cant agree at all with the Rheingold ending as staged here with music conveying the irony of the Gods marching into Valhalla while we listen to the Rhinemaidens lament set to a jet-black stage with the Gods and Valhalla complete hidden with only Loge visable at the stage front playing the now customary (clichd?) role of stage manager. The irony of the music should be matched with the irony of the stage picture, not just a cop out in the dark which seems to be an economic measure to sidestep the problem of creating a rainbow bridge. From Die Walkre onwards though, Cassiers chosen stage imagery on the whole cunningly matches the narrative as it proceeds. Wisely things are always hinted at rather than directly hit over the head and we really do sense the physical geography of Wagners creation which so many other productions simply ignore  the bed and banks of the Rhine, the mountain tops, the forests, the Valkyrie rock, the magic fire and all the other natural elements as well. Costumes and props are carefully chosen to avoid any hint of historical time as we are encouraged to interact with the text with the sense of also being a part of this mythology in the making. This is perhaps the key point  that myth isn't just something created long ago in the dim and distant past. It is something that is forever in the process of being created. Present events cumulatively add up to the myths of the future. This comes over extraordinarily well in Cassiers final image as we are placed squarely in the La Scala audience as the lights go up to contemplate the wall of myth stretching across the stage front in the full glare of the light of our own reality.

Imposing a sense of myth by crafting a production around one central visual idea is hardly original. Gtz Friedrichs time tunnel (Berlin, 1980) and Harry Kupfers worlds highway (Bayreuth, 1988) both stated the Rings mythic timeless dimension very effectively, but they both imposed a dark monotony on proceedings which audiences found hard to take. Cassiers wall of myth is far less immobile and dreary as it is moved up and down, side to side, split into pieces and transformed into multiple guises. There is darkness when required just as there is extraordinary brightness which makes this Ring the most colorful in my experience this side of Keith Warners Tokyo production (2001-2004).

Where Cassiers production falls seriously short is in the lack of stage direction given to the singers. Too often singers simply stand still and sing their lines in the manner of an oratorio given in front of all the high-tech images with characters barely relating to each other at all. On this point Kupfers Bayreuth production wins hands down and remains for me the finest Ring on DVD. Kupfer captures the timeless mythology of the piece albeit starkly with very little on stage by way of props and scenery, and he moves his singers supremely well forcing the weight of the drama and all its themes through the acting and the singing to make for a Ring that above everything else is deeply human. The comparative stasis and dramatic inertia of Cassiers production is shown up especially in scenes 2 and 4 of Das Rheingold where characters stand on a crowded stage declaiming their lines directly to the audience as if their colleagues don't exist, even when the text demands they address each other. On Loge singing Deiner hand, Donner, entsinkt ja der Hammer! [From your hand, Donner, you're dropping the hammer!], he walks past Donner without even looking at him. Donner doesnt react at all and isn't even holding a hammer. This makes absolute nonsense of the text. Alas, it is commonplace in Wagner production these days and Cassiers makes a habit of flagrantly disregarding text throughout his Ring, another screaming example being the setting of the ride of the Valkyries. If theres one thing the scene needs its movement or at least the suggestion of movement. Cassiers Valkyries are statues in a ride of the Valkyries that doesnt even attempt to ride.

The lack of stage direction for the singers brings out the difference between the experienced ones who have learned their trade from people like Kupfer and Chreau and who instinctively know how to react, and the relatively inexperienced ones who haven't learned their trade from such masters. In the first camp there are John Tomlinson (Hagen), Waltraud Meier (Sieglinde, the Gtterdmmerung Waltraute and 2nd Norn), Nina Stemme (the Walkre and Siegfried Brnnhilde), Anna Larsson (Erda), Simon ONeill (Siegmund), Wolfgang Ablinger-Sperrhacke (the Rheingold Mime), Gerd Grochowski (Gunther) and Mikhail Petrenko (Hagen). All of them have a sure instinct for what their roles require and act with a conviction not apparent in the rest of the cast. Wotan suffers most seriously of all with all three singers hardly hinting at the depths of emotion crucial for the role. Vitalij Kowaljow (in Die Walkre) especially is in dire need of being told what to do on stage with important passages like the act 2 monolog and the act 3 farewell to Brnnhilde passing for nothing despite being well sung. Also stiff and noticeably plank-like are Johannes Martin Krnzle (Alberich), Stephan Rgamer (Loge) and especially Lance Ryan (Siegfried). All three should dominate the stage but never do.

Much criticism has been leveled at the dancing Cassiers chooses to inflict on us, and I cant stand it either. Im certain Wagner would have cringed, especially during Das Rheingold where we are forced to ponder all the vague gesturing while we should be paying attention to the text and listening closely to the music. Its all very distracting, but at least the dancing does originate from an interesting idea. The figures seem to come straight out of the wall of myth as representatives of change. Presenting the Tarnhelm as a group of dancers makes this obvious and leads eventually to a wonderful coup dthatre at the end of Gtterdmmerung act 1 when Siegfried changed to the form of Gunther steals the ring from Brnnhildes finger, done here by Siegfried standing aside watching the dancers (the Tarnhelm) smother the victim with a black cloak. Theres something wonderfully sinister here which is most impressive especially as most other productions tend to botch the scene. In Das Rheingold though sadly the dancing gets out of hand and threatens to smother the whole show. We don't need it for the three changes of scene (especially with very audible splashing of water) and we certainly don't need an already cluttered stage cluttered even more with unnecessary bodies doing unnecessary things. Alberichs transformations into a dragon and then a frog done by dancers surrounding him is both unconvincing and laughable. Nikolaus Lehnhoff in San Francisco (1990) and Keith Warner in Tokyo both show how terrifyingly well it can be done. The dancers hardly appear from Die Walkre onwards and it would benefit the whole tetralogy if they were cut completely from Das Rheingold as well.

Musically this Ring is frankly uneven and people shouldnt expect too much. Since the 1950s the quality of Wagner singing generally has been on a downward slide and today true heldentenors and dramatic sopranos are as elusive as the Holy Grail. The La Scala orchestra and chorus conducted by Daniel Barenboim are beyond reproach and produce a fabulous rich sonority though personally I'd prefer faster tempi with more fire in the belly. The singing predictably ranges from the excellent to the excruciating. Generally those mentioned above for their acting also produce the goods vocally. Tomlinsons malevolent Hunding is gloriously venal while Waltraud Meier delivers a stunningly feminine Sieglinde. Her act 3 O hehrstes wunder! is delivered with enormous maternal compassion as she cradles the splintered Nothung as if the sword is the baby Siegfried himself. As Waltraute in Gtterdmmerung she sings her Brnnhilde off the stage underlining the parallels with the closing immolation scene in an incredibly moving way. Nina Stemme makes a bright-voiced and steady Brnnhilde in the middle operas which eclipses for me her Glyndebourne Isolde. Shes in a class of her own today as a dramatic soprano. The best singing in Das Rheingold comes from Ablinger-Sperrhacke as Mime. A beautifully characterized vignette, he should really have been singing Loge instead and even the Siegfried Mime, though Peter Bronder there makes a good fist of the role. Overall Die Walkre is the best sung of the four operas, wobbly Valkyries aside. Despite the wooden acting (probably not his fault) Kowaljow sings accurately and firmly as Wotan as does Terje Stensfold as the Wanderer. Wotan is voiced best of all in Das Rheingold by Ren Pape who shows off an extremely beautiful noble tone. He seems rather stiff to me though. Perhaps like many of the others hes suffering from not knowing what to do on stage. A lot of the singing is on the safe side with notes hit accurately and lots of glances at Barenboim as he slows down even more to let his singers negotiate the more difficult passages. This is especially true of Lance Ryan who would have done better to relax and play the lout more. He certainly looks the part and is probably the best Siegfried weve had since Siegfried Jerusalem, but he is no natural heldentenor and the search is still on for a modern day Wolfgang Windgassen. Rgamers Loge and Krnzles Alberich are both sung well without hitting the heights or being very characterful. Watch the Kupfer Bayreuth production and you realize they don't really stand comparison with Graham Clark and Gnther von Kannen. Indeed, role for role and even note for note coming from the orchestra pit, the Kupfer/Barenboim Ring is still the one to go for. Nevertheless, if you fancy a Ring in state of the art modern sound in a production that gets most of the essentials right the Cassiers version is a fair recommendation. Just beware the pitfalls. Its very sad and bitterly ironic that as the quality of stage technology and recorded sound goes from strength to strength, so top quality true Wagner singing becomes an increasingly distant thing of the past.

8614907,5,B00FEMGCFQ,"I need to qualify this review in that although I am 74 YO, and have wide experience with most all of the Italian repertoire and some Strauss, I have no experience with ""The Ring"". After 74 years, I thought I would try to work up enough courage to tackle the dreaded ""Ring"" with the breast plates and women wearing horned helmets. If not now, when? I purchased the Barenboim- La Scala set as the reviews seemed to be pretty good and I could purchase the set at a steep discount to the individual disks. I previously viewed the ""Das Rheingold"" of this set and liked it very much so I looked forward to continuing with the ""Die Walkure''. I also liked the idea of a relatively modern concept without the whole nine yard ""Euro Trash"" versions.

Firstly, the Blu Ray video was very sharp and the dts encoded sound was also very fine....The conducting seemed totally appropriate to the music and the La Scala  orchestra was very fine. All the principals seemed excellent with very nuanced acting and direction. The sets were simple with effective projections and semi modern costumes that seemed to work better than the breast plates and helmets. There are couple of folks who could have lost a lot of weight to make them more attractively impressive as lovers. I thought the Wotan was very good, but I liked Rene Pape a little better in ""Rheingold"". I know many people believe that you can't get good Wagnerian singers today and you need to go back to the often cited  ""Golden Age"" of Melchoir and Flagstad to get them, but I thought the singers were fine, but it may just be my lack of experience with Wagner and my consequent lack of discrimination.

I found  the music to vary between periods of moderately interesting music, to periods of great beauty and at times thrilling, exquisitely crafted drama. There are not the typically tuneful arias as in Verdi or Puccini, but in a different way, the music is sublime... just one continuous stream music with many leitmotifs and clues to the action that are embedded in the score. I particularly liked the finale...""The Magic Fire Music""... I am really of the opinion that ""The Ring"" must be SEEN, not just listened to on CD. The visual aspect is really essential to fully appreciating the drama....more so than in most other operas. The longer the great saga goes on, the more complex and intriguing the characters become.

UP NEXT : ""Siegfried""...I can hardly wait!",1432598400,,2412,4.67688679245283
8614908,5,B00FEMGCFQ,"There are give and takes with all the Ring Cycles out there, but you absolutely can't get better singing or acting than this Walkure.  Unfortunately the soloists are not the same throughout all the operas in this series.  Most objectionably Nina Stemme does return as Brunhilde for Gotterdamerung!

But whatever the strengths and weaknesses of the operas in the series, this one is just magnificent.  Waltraud Meier is a complicated and passionate Sieglinde, Nina Stemme the  most warrior-like Brunhilde to grace the stage.  What makes her so remarkable is how deep her voice is, something which really fits the character.  As Wotan, Vitalij Kowaljow at first doesn't seem to have the stage presence require of the king of the gods, but I think it's partly just due to his costuming, as he soon takes of the role and finds nuances in the character that make him fascinating in the third act.  Really, I was beginning to think of new things philosophically because of the lines he sang.  Is human kind's free will so important to God because He does not have it Himself?

Really everyone deserves special mention.  Simon O'Neil's Siegmund isn't so great by himself but his duet with Waltraud is the the most miraculous thing I've seen on stage, I was absolutely swept away with them.  And speaking of swept away, those Valkyries!  I was just up inside the storm with them.  The first valkyrie soloist seemed a bit scared to be on stage alone, but she should be!  The whole piece was positively terrifying!  No other production has come close!

A final special mentioned is reserved for Ekaterina Gubanova as Frikka.  This is usually an absolutely thankless role.  Wotan's little shrew that is passed off on some past her prime singer who does the minimum to get by.  But Ekaterina is absolutely stupendous!  I can't get over it.  I didn't know the role had so much in it.  It's jaw dropping and worth rewinding and watching right over again.  I hope to see her again and again.

Some reservations must be mentioned for the set and costuming.  I must say I do prefer medieval fantasy sets for this, especially because I haven't seen a good production with fantasy sets.  I became interested in the Ring and all of opera in the first place because of my love of mythology.  I'd love to see dragons and giants, nymphs and dwarves.  I suppose that's technically what you got from the old Met production, but it was also terribly boring, and staid, and Levine's conducting so lifeless.  If you've seen P. Craig Russel's comic book adaptation, that's what I'd like to see on stage.  As far as this production goes, at least these sets were interesting, and not empty or actually ugly like some other productions on DVD.  The Valkurie scene is about the best.  The mountaintop horses were nice in the second act.  But why was the fight scene apparently taking place in the Matrix?  And the lava lamp Magic Fire at the end?  Hunding's house also was just boring.  But as I said it might not have been what I wanted, but it was at least interesting.

The costuming on the other hand was just bad.  Waltraud's first dress was cut far too low for her age, and was not good.  Nina Stemma walks around with some giant bustle that I don't even understand.  Maybe it was some sort of sack?  Siegmund is wearing a shawl?  Wotan's leisure suit?  The giant zipper down the front of his third act costume?  It's was all just ugly.  The only exceptions being Frikka's beautiful ball gown that made her really stand out in an already standout performance, and Waltraud's second dress which along with her hair really made her look 20 years younger.

Finally, to end on a high note again.  I must applaud Daniel Barenboim.  He makes every single phrase stand out and seem important.  It's really quite astounding.  He must be the best Wagner conductor or out.  Every instrument is the star under him.  And when his tempi really take off at the end of the first act and during the Walkurie ride it's just thrilling.  One odd choice on his part is the incredibly slow tempo for the Magic Fire music.  I think he was inspired more by the Sleeping Beauty dream aspect of the story, than the dancing flames the music was intended to suggest.  I think I prefer the original way, but it's by no means bad this way, just different.

Let me reiterate the whole production is just wonderful and you will not be disappointed.  It's just too bad that it's a rather standalone experience.  I haven't seen the others, but clips from this series' Das Rheingold on Youtube look just dreadful, and I'm not certain I'll care to see it through to Gotterdamerung either if Nina Stemme leaves us, but I will get the rest and then decide.  Perhaps if all the singers keep changing, I should just pick my favorite individual opera from completely different productions to make the set.  In that case, if only the Dahalla Rheingold was on DVD or Bluray.  :-)",1416182400,,4911,4.6329849012775846
8614909,2,B00FEMGCFQ,"I love Wagner's Operas , or Music Dramas as they are so called some times, and I also have great respect for his genius. Having that high regards I respect his beliefs and vision how the Ring of the Nibelungen should be staged.
Therefore I am against modernization of the costumes and staging. Seeing the Russian bass Vitaly Kovaljov as Wotan in the La Scala production of Die Walkure without the Horned Helmet and a strange dress he is not Wagner's  Wotan at all,despite his good singing. The way he is dressed and the spear in his hand is completely unacceptable for me and it looks plain silly. If they only could , they would remove the spear from Wotan hand , but this is impossible because they would have to change the libretto in the closing pages of the Wotan's Farewell.
The last words of Wotan's Farewell:  ' Wer meines Speeres Spitze  furchted durch Schreite das Feuer
 nie' ! ( Whosoever my spear 's point terrifies Shall never pass through the Fire!).
The singing of the artist's is good to excellent , particularly Nina Stemme as Brunhilde , but she pales when compared with the great sopranos from the past. Just to mention Kirsten Flagstadt , Helen Traubel, Birgit Nilsson, and Martha Modl. The conducting of Daniel Barenboim is excellent throughout the opera ,but he is unable to match the drama Wilhelm Furtwangler creates with the Vienna Philharmonic  Orcheatra in the Wotan's Farewell. It is a pity that such a good singing and conducting performance is ruined by bad staging and costumes. It would be much better if it would be issued only on CD's. The singing and conducting deserves from four too five stars and the sound is great . The picture beeing to dark some times and  as a whole is generally good. Recommended for Wagner

8614910,4,B00FEMGCFQ,"I attended the live in HD performance of this opera mainly because I expected Rene Pape to sing Wotan.
I was a bit disappointed when it did not happen.  I had seen the Wotan in this performance in LA ring and I was satisfied with the performance.  Fine but not great.
The main surprise was the Brunhilde of Nina Stemme. I was not familiar with her. She is superb in this role and totally worth buying this DVD for her performance alone.  I have since seen her live in San Francisco ring and my opinion of her has only improved.  She owns this role right now.  All others were fine.
The other reason to buy this DVD is the orchestral performance under Daniel Baremboim.  Under his direction the orchestra performed magnificently and the sound is excellent.
I enjoed the berating that Baremboim gave the governmenr before the performance began during the live in HD transmission.  Unfortunately this was not included in the DVD.  It would have been a fine extra to include.
The staging was mostly OK with very simple set and projecttions but for the most part effective.  The exception was the final scene when Brunhilde is put to sleep.  She looked like a plate of spagetti under a hot lamp. It was in Italy after all...",1399593600,,1219,4.5504587155963305

I thought the stage effects were excellent. I am by no means a noted critic of opera so I can't speak to the finer points but I thought the opera was well sung, the orchestra did well, and the acting fit the characters.

8614912,5,B00FEMGCFQ,"I have been slowly collecting these Blu-ray discs as they have been released (in order). The cycle is an all around winner thus far. Siegfried was released on January 28, 2014 so I am waiting in great anticipation.

The singing is all very good. Yes, some of the artists are getting ""long in the tooth"" but their understanding of the roles far outweighs any negatives (if there are any!). Tomlinson is a brutal and grim Hunding. His voice is still great and his acting is top notch. The twins are portrayed marvelously by O'Neill and Meier. Meier is still beautiful and her vocal and acting skills are fabulous. Both sing with delicacy and power when necessary. Wintersturme in Act 1 is marvelous...beautifull carressed by Barenboim and the La Scala orchestra and sung to near perfection by O'Neill. The ending of Act 1 is thrilling as Barenboim increases the tension little by little to come to a breathtaking conclusion. The staging for this act is evocative and at times frightening and beautiful.

The highlight of Act 2 is the scene in the woods...beginning with Todesverkundigung. O'Neill and Stemme are both great actors. I really felt despair and a glimmer of hope in this scene (even though I knew it would all come to nothing). BTW, Stemme's Valkyrie battle cry at the start of Act 2 is great!!!!! Stemme is a great Brunnhilde (I also love her Isolde)<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tristan-und-Isolde-Blu-ray/dp/B002KLGLV4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tristan und Isolde [Blu-ray</a>].Fricka is wonderfully portrayed by Gubanova. She is a excellent singer and an even better actress. This Fricka is majorly pissed off! Kowalijow is a commanding Wotan with a strong voice, great stage presence and good acting skills. Half of his face is black...an interesting touch. Also, it was nice to see a spear that looks like a spear! His monologue leaves one convinced that he has given up on his future. The staging is grand...the huge horse statues and projections giving an epic quality to the first part of the act. The forrest at the end of the act changes color to reflect the actions and emotions of the characters.

The Valkries enter in grand style opening Act 3. The huge projection of dead warriors, horses, and Valkyries is stunning. The highlight of this act is the 3rd scene between Brunnhilde and Wotan. The combination of great singing, great acting, and Barenboim's conducting all come together for a shattering experience. The orchstra is marvelous. The staging fades away during this scene forcing one's complete attention on the emotional drama. The final Feuerezauber is absolutely beautiful. Brunnhilde is raised on a dias amid all manner of flaming beams, orbs, and smoke.

The La Scala orchestra is world class. Barenboim has this music in his soul. So, all in all a great production: good singing, great acting, marvelous conducting, near perfect orchestral execution, clear, unfussy direction, and gorgeous staging.

8614914,4,B00FEMGCFQ,"Once the singing is at least pretty good, my main interest is in the theatrical experience, so that is what this review will focus on.

Staging: Modern sets vaguely suggest the pagan origins of the story. Projections are used, but not as the entire staging as in the Mehta Valencia Ring. Quickly-changing sequences of numbers and letters are projected on 2 props during Act 2. I suppose this is to suggest that the events of this opera imprint some primeval DNA onto subsequent human history. For the final scene, imagination runs out until the end; the stage is dark and basically empty so the great farewell might as well have been performed in front of the curtain. Most other times, the sets are somewhat interesting.

Costumes are modern-but-slightly-off. The Walkuries are in extravagant 18 century ballroom gowns.  I don't see the point. While modern, nothing here mocks or sabotages the drama.

Cast: The entire Act 1 cast sounds and looks like the the parents of the characters they are portraying. Close camera shots show their age and make it hard to suspend disbelief. Only Fricka looks youthful and desirable (in a buxom, Russian way) - she also wears a gown that might come from a royal European court. The entire cast acts well. Every facial gesture and body movement has been well thought out, serving character portrayal and dramatic action.  Wotan does not have a commanding stage presence, but acts reasonably well. Fricka and Sieglinde act very well. Hunding and Siegmund need to lose weight.

Camera work: There are not the constant, rapid changes of view that make the Valencia Ring so dizzying to watch. I did not care for the fade-outs, double-images and other gimmicks but they were not constant.
Picture (Blue-Ray) and Sound were very good. If only the Boulez Ring had been photographed like this!

The darkness, the menace and the threatening tone carries over perfectly into the epic storms of creation and the flight of Wehwalt/Siegmund and draw us compelling into Die Walkre. Almost every Ring cycle however involves compromise of one sort or another and here it relates to choices made in the casting and in the singing. Neither however are so great that they detract in any significant way from the overall success of this critical juncture in La Scala's Ring cycle.

Most notably - although it's by no means critical - there's no consistency here in the casting of Wotan and Fricke. Ren Pape and Doris Soffel give way here to Vitalij Kowaljow and Ekaterina Gubanova, both of whom however perform very well even if they don't have the same degree of stature or personality as their predecessors.  There is perhaps some degree of compromise in the casting of Waltraud Meier and John Tomlinson. Neither is at their peak now and it shows in places. Tomlinson's ability and presence however, his deep understanding of Wagner's music and how it informs the characters even in a relatively minor role like Hunding, stand him in good stead here. The same could be said about Waltraud Meier, but her lighter touch works perfectly with Barenboim's dynamic approach to the score here. In terms of experience, expression and sheer professionalism, not to mention a voice of quite lyrical beauty and true force where required, Meier however really comes through.

All the roles in Die Walkre are important to the overall fabric of the work, but the ones that can make all the difference are Siegmund and Brnnhilde. Simon O'Neill sets his own pace it seems, not always following the tempo set by Barenboim, but he sings well and gets across the necessary sympathy and nobility of his character. Nina Stemme however is just phenomenal as Brnnhilde, and that's really what raises the overall high standard of this Die Walkre. Her's is a voice of immense richness of timbre, but Brnnhilde is by no means a role that can carry the work in isolation. It needs to work alongside the other characters and that's where the strength of the casting really shows. To use one example, the critical scene of Siegmund, Sieglinde and Brnnhilde in the woods during Act II, Scene IV is telling in this respect. It's just stunning, the singing and expression of sentiments coming together, working in perfect accordance with the staging (light shading trees turning into shards of ice) and with Barenboim's orchestration to haunting effect.

It's Daniel Barenboim of course who is instrumental in bringing all this together quite so successfully. He adjusts somewhat to the strengths and weaknesses of the singers in a way that gets the very best out of them, but he also responds to the full dynamic of Wagner's score, allowing the lyrical romanticism of the work to be expressed in the simple beauty, tone and melody of the music itself as much as in the measured force of the delivery. Act I in particular benefits from a more sensitive and lyrical approach to Siegmund and Sieglinde's encounter, but Barenboim is just as expressive when the underlying menace erupts, in the passages of shimmering ecstatic rapture and in the whole range of emotions that the grand scale of the work encompasses. It's a sheer tour-de-force that allows the score space to breathe and assert it own power without ever overplaying its hand or over-emphasis.

That all works in perfect accord then with Guy Cassiers' understated direction for the stage, which is more about mood than strict representation. In this respect it's not dissimilar to the Met's recent Ring cycle, only with a set here that achieves the necessary impact much better and in a far less complicated manner than Robert Lepage's Machine. Following on from Das Rheingold, Hunding's lodge is a cube of light in what looks like a dark cave of glistening light projections. Act II, with a spinning globe connecting Valhalla to Earth, remains abstract but attractive to watch and feel without there ever being any sense of a ""concept"" being forced on the work and without distracting from the performances. The circle of fire conclusion is less of a spectacle, but that's in tune also with the simplicity and beauty of the line established by Barenboim's conducting of the work. It's not exactly traditional, but it all looks gorgeous and works well.

The Blu-ray from Arthaus looks and sounds fabulous, the full-HD image and the PCM Stereo and DTS HD-Master Audio sound mixes perfectly representing the essential tone of the production and the performances. Other than a couple of trailers, there are no extra features on the disc. The BD50 Blu-ray is region-free and subtitles are in German, English, French, Spanish, Italian and Korean.",1384387200,15,5122,5.091666666666667
