7727403,4,B01DZQ10M2,"Twenty years ago, a similar film called Face Off debuted, and while the story seemed ridiculous, somehow it worked. Criminal is in the same boat, as audiences have been kept away by the complicated plot, which also seems to work quite well. The film starts with the brutal murder of a CIA agent, who has a secret vital to national security in his head. Out of desperation, the CIA turns to a doctor and an experimental procedure, which will allow the agents memories to be transferred into someone else's mind. The only problem is that the procedure requires a certain type of mind, the mind of a psychopath. Against his will, Jericho Stewart (Kevin Costner) is transferred to CIA headwaters and given the agents memories, but will he become the good agent and help save the world, or will he return to his murderous ways? Kevin Costner stars and reminds us all of what a terrific actor he truly is. It's hard to remember, considering that for the passed two decades he's done mostly romantic garbage, that you couldn't pay me to sit through. Costner returns to action as if he'd never been gone and does an amazing job playing this deeply conflicted, flawed man. Paired with an all-star cast, that features a ton of cameos, Criminal never slows down and will have you on the edge of your seat the whole time. It's not really the CIA crisis or the science fiction that keeps your interest throughout, it's the conflict growing in Jericho Stewart's brain, as he has essential turned into a person that is both good and evil. Yes, the story is a bit complicated, but it is fairly easy to follow, and Kevin Costner gives his best performance in at least a decade, making Criminal well worth the price of admission.",1466640000,46,1711,4.631578947368421
7727404,1,B01DZQ10M2,Lots of laughs from watching Costner scream like a mad man while beating up and killing innocent people. Exactly what I want from my protagonist.,1466208000,,145,4.84
7727405,1,B01DZQ10M2,"Once of the worst films I have seen in years.  Plodding and not amusing or enjoyable.  The movie was much too dark, difficult to identify with the players.  I do not recommend this film, one of Cosner's worst films.",1466035200,2,215,4.461538461538462
7727406,4,B01DZQ10M2,"I actually started watching this movie by mistake, but it turned out to one of the better mistakes that I've made recently.

In Criminal, Kevin Costner (who is barely recognizable in this movie) puts in a moving performance as Jericho, a brain-damaged criminal who turns out to be the perfect test subject for a memory implant procedure. Tommy Lee Jones (who looks like he is around 120 years old in this picture) drifts through the movie as the mad scientist who the CIA pays to conduct some experimental brain surgery. I normally love Tommy Lee Jones, but most of the time in this movie he looks like he is either falling asleep or on his deathbed.

Costner winds-up with a dead CIA agent's (Ryan Reynolds) memories implanted into his skull, which come leaking out as the movie moves along. Gary Oldman puts in a solid performance as Costner's CIA handler and Gal Gadot plays the CIA agent's grieving wife.

The movie starts out looking like a by-the-numbers spy movie, with Reynolds making a brief appearance at the beginning. After a bit of backstory on the main characters the theme switches gears to a high-speed thriller, punctuated by some compelling interaction between Costner and Gadot. I wouldn't quite call this a sci-fi movie, but the whole ""brain transfer"" thing obviously has some sci-fi elements to it.

As plots go, the movie is pretty average. Bad guy is chased by main character, who himself may or may not be a bad guy. What really gives this film its strength is the great performance by Costner though. He pretty much carries this movie. I'm not normally a huge Costner fan, but he really stepped-up his game for this role. It was a good enough performance that I actually had no idea that Kevin Costner was the main character until I saw the final credits roll. His face and voice are pretty much unrecognizable.

Anyway, it was a fun movie to watch and I really enjoyed it. It's definitely worth your time.",1465689600,150,1931,4.701183431952662
7727407,4,B01DZQ10M2,"""Criminal"" is a 2016 genre-bending mixture of science fiction and action thriller.  An extremely violent convicted criminal receives a brain implant from dead CIA operative Bill Pope (Ryan Reynolds) in a desperate scheme to prevent a nuclear Armageddon.  Kevin Costner provides a haunting performance as Jericho Stewart, a man tortured by memories not his own, alongside the daring doctor (Tommy Lee Jones) who implanted them, the CIA station chief (Gary Oldman) who directed the operation, and Pope's widow (Gal Gadot) who must learn to trust a stranger who knows too much. ""Criminal"" is a surprisingly effective thriller, in which Jericho's interaction with Pope's former life will lead to a twisting finish.  The movie is recommended as decent entertainment.",1464998400,113,761,5.432203389830509
7727408,4,B01DZQ10M2,"Ryan Reynolds is an over billed CIA wuss who gets killed in the first scene. However his mind is the only one that can save the world from Michael Pitt, ""The Dutchman"" who has that proverbial Internet thing to launch missiles that has become far too cliche in films. Ryan worked for Zorg (Gary Oldman) who doesn't care if he is dead, he is still going to make him do his job. Bring in Dr. Tommy Lee Jones in not his most convincing role (Oldman and Lee seriously needed to swap roles as did Costner and anybody else). It seems our doctor has never heard of Frankenstein as he puts Reynolds memory into Costner sporting a new Mohawk, who is also the world's biggest sociopath. He is in a penitentiary, and not a CEO.

At this point we resort to the standard spy film formula and not so much the Frankenstein formula, although I would have really enjoyed just one ""fire bad.""

In spite of my review, I did find the film mildly entertaining as I do when people get killed by a tough guy. 3 1/2 stars.

7727414,5,B01DZQ10M2,"I enjoyed this action-filled film, which is packed with violence, thrills, and twists. It has a very good cast. Kevin Costner as Jericho, Gary Oldman as the CIA lead, Tommy Lee Jones as the doctor, and Gal Gadot, the woman who plays Wonder Woman in the highly acclaimed film of that name, as the wife of the dead CIA agent.
A well-trained very-skilled CIA agent was dealing with a man called the Dutchman who took cyber control of the US military and all its weapons, offering millions of dollars in exchange for the controls. Meanwhile, the Russians also want the controls, kill the CIA agent, and try to find the Dutchman. The CIA needs to find the Dutchman and the controls to save the US.
The lead CIA agent found a doctor who is able, so he thinks because he never did it before, to implant the memory of the dead CIA agent into the head of a vicious criminal Jericho. the implant works but only partially at the beginning, causing Jericho pain and confusion. The lead CIA agent is unable to get what he needs at the outset. At that time, Jericho remembers the money and wants it. Then he remembers the CIA agents wife.",1530835200,,1124,4.461165048543689

First thing is Kevin Costner did an outstanding job, I didn't recognize him in that role but he nailed it. Gal Gadot was a nice bonus. The story line was great and kept me interested till the very end. Sure it was a little predictable but satisfying non the less. A little bit of gratuitous Social Justice in it but not ""cram it down your throat"" bad.

7727513,4,B01DZQ10M2,"Wha- Kevin Costner and Ryan Reynolds in the same action movie? Sign me up, son. And as a bonus, CRIMINAL injects a whiff of sci-fi into its shoot-'em-up spy premise. Plot opens with a frenetic chase sequence as London-based CIA intelligence officer Bill Pope (Ryan Reynolds) tries his durndest to shake unshakable enemy agents. Pope is not long for this narrative. In London, he gets trapped and tortured and terminated.

Comes the pickle: Pope was the CIA's sole point-of-contact for the Dutchman, ""Dutchman"" being the cyber codename for notorious hacker Jan Strook (Michael Pitt). At the behest of a crazed anarchist, the Dutchman had commandeered Vigilant Shield, the U.S. military's emergency command & control system, with which the operator can activate any weapons system in the U.S. military arsenal. But when the Dutchman gets cold feet, he offers the program to the CIA, but demanding asylum and $10 million. And there was Pope assigned as liaison.

But with Pope gone and his secrets gone with him, the CIA cannot locate the Dutchman (and the now missing $10 million). What to do? CIA, wrack your brain.

CRIMINAL is stacked with a grip of top-notch performers. Gary Oldman, chewing sceneries as CIA executive Quaker Wells; Tommy Lee Jones as maverick neurosurgeon Dr. Franks. Dr. Franks pioneered the science of transferring memories off a corpse and onto the brain of a living human. CIA guy Quaker Wells jumps at this one last gasp, never mind that it's an experimental program what's still five years away from human trials. What's needed now is a subject. Only one in ten million meets the required criteria.

That rare candidate is cooling his heels in a West Virginia penitentiary. Jerico Stewart (Kevin Costner) is a death row inmate deemed so dangerous his mobility must be impeded by a chain suspended from the ceiling and attached to his neck. His meals are dropped from a chute overhead. Jerico is feral and amoral and utterly uninhibited, courtesy of a frontal lobe that remains in an underdeveloped state. He is a full-on sociopath whose credo goes like this: ""You hurt me... I hurt you worse."" Except he's ideal for radical surgery and neural stem cell stimulation.

The movie's main thrust of interest revolves around how Jerico copes with a stranger's memories, how he transitions from a criminal who's hostage to his own impulses and who nurses an inability to calculate the consequences of his actions into some new person who is suddenly ordering food in perfect French and frequenting libraries. Jerico's embedded recall guides him to Pope's residence where he meets Pope's wife (Gal Gadot) and young daughter (Lara Decaro). Honestly, Jerico's interplay - and the resulting emotional hits - with the Pope womenfolk is what glued me to the screen. The action thrills are exciting stuff, yeah, but nothing new under the sun. CRIMINAL came before WONDER WOMAN, so there was some interest in checking out Gadot's acting chops here. She's okay. Not bad, but also not earth-shaking. The material she's given, her role of Jillian Pope, doesn't much rise above the typical damsel-in-distress routine.

Ryan Reynolds is terrific, but I expected that. In only his few minutes of screen time, the primary purpose of his character is to make a lasting, sympathetic impression on you and me as it's his memories - and, more importantly, memories of his family - that drive Jerico thru most of the narrative, and you had to connect with that.

Other movies had done it before, spun a tale of the monster who develops a conscience. I like what Kevin Costner does here. He's savage and growly and unpredictable, utterly driven by impulse, and there were many moments in which he chooses to do the wrong thing. Often times he suffers bouts of sensory overload, and whenever that goes down, you'd best duck for cover. It's fascinating watching Jerico war with himself, combative and violent one minute, falling sway to Bill Pope's influence the next. I guess you can stretch that rubber band truly thin and draw a parallel with Pygmalion. Too much? Yeah, okay. Jerico never does become, um, genteel. What he becomes is not as surly.

Pepper in intermittent moments with the deranged baddie, industrialist anarchist Xavier Heimdahl (Jordi Molla), who is so froth-at-the-mouth wackadoodle he makes Jerico seem the paragon of prudence. Frankly, Heimdahl is so diabolical and unapologetically cartoony I came around and began to enjoy the actor's performance. CRIMINAL isn't a top-shelf entertainer. The plot is populated with undeveloped stock figures. I rate it 3.5 stars out of 5. The espionage stuff, the actiony stuff, those were fine but other films had done 'em better. There are three primary hooks to CRIMINAL: the sci-fi conceit of memory implanting; Jerico's arc from remorseless reprobate to remorseless reprobate who registers a connection with his - or, rather, Pope's - leery wife and adorable little daughter. The third hook, of course, is that we get to see Deadpool, Wonder Woman, and Superman's dad sharing the big screen.",1504137600,,5051,5.033492822966507

Accomplished actors tend to play themselves, just in different roles.

7727619,5,B01DZQ10M2,"As soon as I came across this film on Amazon Prime Video, I knew I had to watch it. Why? I truly like action thriller films that have elements of both science fiction and real life struggles within them. This film fit both of those requirements. Now, I watched the entire film and really enjoyed it. Four main reasons why. First, I thought the film had an intriguing premise. Second, I must say that this film's cast was adept at playing their assigned characters. Third, I usually detest films that have long sequences of bloody action scenes, but this film had a very minimal amount much to my surprise compared to others. Fourth, I thought this film ended on an upbeat note with everything coming full circle for all the characters in the film. Finally, I do see a future where Hollywood's producers and screenwriters produce more of these types of films that make us think about our humanity. This is a must watch film for anyone who thinks about how they got to where they're currently and what the future may hold for them in the future.",1484179200,4,1043,4.553191489361702

His expression of the damage was appropriate for the area of the brain involved.  Violence in its purest form truly reflected the emotions of a guiltless man.  ""You hurt me, I hurt you worse"" was as genuine as an animal's normal instincts.  Having the dead man's ""brain"" patterns impressed upon him changed him into a more normal man.

I like Ryan Reynolds but his part was awkward and lasted about one minute. Tommy Lee Jones looked like he was phoning it in. Gary Oldman was playing Commissioner Gordon for some reason. Kevin Costner was the only one who had a decent performance but was hampered by the sophomoric dialog and most of the other minor parts seemed to be filled with first-time actors that they must have randomly picked out of a crowd.

7727853,2,B01DZQ10M2,"Criminal was disappointing because the premise of surgically transferring the memory of a dead CIA agent, Ryan Reynolds, to the brain of a hardened sociopath, Kevin Costner, was frankly ridiculous.  Over the years I have enjoyed the work of Kevin Costner, Tommy Lee Jones, and Gary Oldman which is the main reason I watched this movie for $.99 through Amazon Prime.  However, it was disappointing to see them performing in a story and production that seemed way beneath their skills.  One turn off was Kevin Costner sporting the deceased CIA agent's memory seeming to transition into the lives of the agent's widow and child.  Given the great age discrepancy between Costner and the younger man's wife, not to mention Costner's sociopath tendencies, the implied transition seemed creepy.  If Costner still imagines himself as a leading man, he needs a part where he can build empathy with someone closer to his age and a personality that is more sympathetic.

Tommy Lee Jones looks like a living Fossil and he's only 70 I've seen road kill that looks and acts better.

7727963,3,B01DZQ10M2,"Possible spoilers.  This is another one of the high-concept films that was trashed by critics, but features a solid cast and an interesting premise.  So hell, why not check it out.  The film opens with Ryan Reynolds as CIA operative Bill Pope.  Set in London, Pope is trying to elude bad guys in order to make an exchange with a geeky hacker known as The Dutchman (Michael Pitt).  At this point we don't know why but we learn quickly that he is making an exchange of cash and a passport for a flash drive that will prevent the evil-doers from taking control of the Wests nuclear arsenal.

Pope reports to Quaker Wells (an over-the-top, ranting Gary Oldman).  While Pope manages to hide the satchel first, hes captured, tortured and killed by the head terrorist, Xavier Heimdahl (Jordi Molla).  Both Heimdahl and Wells need the satchel and the Dutchmans location for obvious reasons.  Evidently the CIA has been conducting experiments with a Dr. Franks (a miscast Tommy Lee Jones) that allows memories and emotions to be transplanted to another human even if the transplantor is deceased.  So a big whaaat there.

Although Franks hasn't tested this on human subjects, hes ordered to find someone and just do it.  He picks an imprisoned Jericho Stewart (Kevin Costner) who is so violent he has to be chained around the neck and has limited movement.  Evidently his mama dropped him on his head or something when he was a baby and it severely limited his normal human responses.  In essence he has no comprehension of civility.  Hell knock down a granny with no more thought than swatting a mosquito.  After the transfer takes place, hes to be corralled until he can come up with Popes memory, especially of the satchel location.  It doesnt come quickly but some memories do begin to appear, including those of his wife Jill (Gal Gadot) and young daughter.  Naturally Jericho gets loose, so he must negotiate his next moves, complicated by slowly developing concerns and emotions, especially those of Popes family.

While there is much to dismiss as sci-fi silliness, the film has a certain wry humor thanks to Costners performance.  Entertaining at its core.

The Blu ray package comes with a 1080p video resolution and a 2.39:1 aspect ratio.  Whether or not you appreciate the story, the transfer cant be faulted.  The movie looks great on disc with excellent color and great detail.  Facial hair is always a test for detail and Costners stubble is well delineated.  Black levels are fine as well.  The film has a variety of settings ranging from outdoors (beaches look great) to indoor darkness (prison cells) to well-lit interiors and they all look good.  The DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track is likewise excellent.  I found this element to be unusually wide-spread throughout the surround speakers and the LFE (.1) output.

It's just okay. Develops a little too fast and jumps around a little too much. For example, about 3/4 of the way through, the Doctor jumps in and tells the ""Criminal"" that he thinks there's a way to help him keep part or most of the temporary memories given to him. Out of the blue. Just like that. (Setting up part of the latter half of the film.)",1473984000,,524,4.46875

7728012,5,B01DZQ10M2,"I hadn't even heard of this one before I came across the DVD.  Was even more surprised when I started watching and thought, that guy kind of looks like Ryan Reynolds and realised it was (he's not even on the DVD cover), then of course as the opening events played out I realised why his name and face aren't on the front.  So the basic plot of this one has Kevin Costner who plays a violent sociopath criminal who is behind bars, living in a cell in chains where food gets dropped to him, as he has no problem hurting or killing anyone who comes in.  He feels no empathy or bad in any way for killing or hurting to get what he wants. Survival of the fittest is how he has lived his life. A top secret agent type guy is captured and tortured to death before the rescue team arrive, so with only a 48hr window this government organisation knows it must act fast to implant the memories part of the agent's brain into the lobes of a suitable candidate (whose brain never developed that part). If they fail, a villain known as The Dutchman will have control over the US military's missiles including of course nuclear ones (which is an odd choice since this movie is set in the UK).  Of course the most suitable transplant host is the violent prisoner.

Although the movie is pretty predictable for this type of storyline, it still is a lot of fun. It borrows from other movies, even touches of Robo Cop with remembering family of the dead guy and stuff. Costner though just makes it work, so you don't care that you've seen a lot of this before. He's brilliant as the guy who although kills people who are a hurdle to stealing a car or something, you can't also help but like him.  I really liked this film.  You should check it out!",1473811200,,1730,4.304615384615385
7728013,5,B01DZQ10M2,"Costner's character is a raging maniac with no concept of right or wrong due to childhood brain trauma to the brain area connected to morality. When his brain is suddenly ""fixed"" by a bit of sci fi magic and he is implanted with the thoughts and moral compass of a dying man, his action and perception is changed.

7728072,5,B01DZQ10M2,"I'll be succinct: Kevin Costner, Tommy Lee Jones, and Gary Oldman together possess too much talent and experience to all be in a bad movie together, and the upside potential is quite high.  The movie starts by demonstrating that it's going to be a serious British spy story with action, violence, and a few naughty words, but no sex.  Then we see the sci-fi postulate which we must accept in order to enjoy the movie.  The rest of the movie is driven forward by the emotional experiences of a brain-damaged adult man who has never felt emotions before, and has suddenly acquired the experiences of loving, and being loved by, a wife and daughter for years.  Costner's lead character, and his struggle with emotions, was so believable and so unrecognizable as the actor that I forgot the actor completely for most of the film.  That's unusual for me.

Typical Hollywood B.S. with regard to producing a film that is of little substance, filled with shallow dialogue and dependent on gratuitous vehicular wreckage.  The last 10 minutes of the film were the funniest due to a sloppy effort to tie everything together and end on a feel good note...Gary Oldman's last line was so vapid that it left my wife and I laughing in embarrassment that he hat to utter it.  Tommy Lee Jones could have phoned in his performance it was so perfunctory.  The best acting came from not one of the main characters.

7728144,4,B01DZQ10M2,"A Sci-Fi thriller set in London -
A anarchist 'Xavier Heimdahi' (Jordi Molia) had persuaded associate and 'hacker'Jan Strook' (The Dutchman)
to create a wormhole-program that would allow access to international codes for the launch of nuclear weapons,
however the 'Dutchman' panics realising how the system could be used and contacts a C.I.A agent based in London
'Bill Pope' (Ryan Reynolds) wanting a safe place to stay, along with a large sum of cash in return for handing the
potentially deadly system over.
'Bill Pope' is the only person that knows where 'The Dutchman' and indeed the money is....on his way to meet up
he is caught by 'Heimdahi's men, though tortured he won't give up 'The Dutchman's' location, which costs him his
life.
The C.I.A headed in London by 'Quaker Wells' (Gary Oldman) have a problem, they have to find 'The Dutchman' before
the system he's developed falls into the hands of 'Xavier'
'Quaker' contacts 'Dr Mahal Franks' (Tommy Lee Jones) who had developed a procedure that could in theory implant
memory patterns from the dead-agent into a recipients brain....though finding a willing recipient is another matter.
However they come up with the idea to pull 'Jericho Stewart' (Kevin Costner) out of his confined cell in the States to
proceed with the plan, 'Jericho' a man with an ultra-violent record, a man with no emotions, a man of no consequence.
After the procedure is performed 'Quaker' is desperate to learn what 'Jericho' was now supposed to know, however
initially it seems that he hasn't the answers they seek.
The situation with the hacker is becoming more desperate, believing the C.I.A has let him down he now plans to sell the
system developed to the Russians (not forgetting 'Xavier' remains a player)
'Jericho' who at first escapes custody is beginning to have very confused visions and thoughts, he is somewhere between
who he really is and the C.I.A agent who's partial memory he now carries.
He will in his state of confusion make contact with 'Bill Pope's' bereaving wife and their daughter and also feel the need
to complete the mission the agent was on.
This will put both his life and the life of 'Bill's' family in danger.
Maybe not enough action for many, i myself enjoyed it and believe this to be one of Kevin Costner's best performances in
recent times.
There is some good action, and there is the struggle between the two personalities 'Jericho' now carries, we see both.
The film does have a great cast-list, however the story really revolves around that of the character'Jericho'
Worth a spin in my view...

Kevin Costner acted as Jericho the violent criminal and he was awesome in depicting the change in emotions of Jericho.

Jericho became a decent man through the sheer power of altruistic love and compassion. The deep sense of connection was something he was incapable of until he experienced it.

Almost everyone walked through their parts -- because I'm thinking most of this film was done in another country, and the big name actors were pasted into a whole lot of b-roll.  Worth even a 2nd viewing, but only four stars, because a big-budget dang well better grab my attention better than this one.  ONe bonus:  Costner was nailing the character, and made the writing come alive.  The writing of that role was iffy -- we never really identify with the anti-hero.  Ending was lovey-dovey solely because someone actually thought this had a chance for being so big it deserved a sequel or a TV series.....and it hurt the ending.  Editing felt forced -- tons of plot to advance, and so time was compressed again and again.  Made the film feel even less real.

It was fairly predictable and if you're a rabid fan of science fiction short stories or novels, chances are you've read a book very similar to this one.  Bill. Pope is a super secret CIA operative that dies tragically before he can fulfill a time sensative mission..  Jericho is the hard core pscho on death row.  His civil rights are seriously violated when the prison system offers him up for a scientific experiment that doesn't go according to plan.  There are entirely too many opportunities to spoil this for someone wanting to see it. I don't want to do this.

My husband said it was a high tech version of Face Off and he wouldn't be completely wrong. There are a lot of captures from other film references.  I'll go with Rambo and you take your picks of snippets from other movies.  The actors didn't give seller performances, but Kevin Costner plays a good bad guy.

It's not a movie we would watch again unless it would be just to see if we missed something subliminal the first time around. We have a tendency to do that in this house.  It wasn't the worst movie I have ever seen, nor was it the worst.  Harsh language and jokes that would have been funny under different circumstances litter the storyline a bit too much.

It's not even partly good, it's total bomb that did not have me convinced at any given time. For an action drama, the action was seriously lacking. Other than your typical car flipping -gun toting thugs having a shootout with the law, there was nothing in this film that I'd consider as suspenseful action. It was a mediocre game of chase where you could predict the ending. There was no focus on the scientific aspect of the plot, and not enough focus on the backstory of the main characters. The ending was just - stupid. I figured this would be a ""dumb movie"" before I rented it. I only wanted to watch something entertaining because there is a serious lack of good movies to select from. The tripe that has been coming from Hollywood as of late makes me think I am better off spending more of my time writing music, or my own movie. Every now and then a good flick comes through, but it's such a rare occasion that I am giving up hope on the entertainment industry. I have been seriously disgusted with the concept of hack movie makers being able to sell their crap on NF and Amazon. Some of these horrible movies aren't cheap to rent either. Some are so bad that I would not even bother to watch free on Prime or NF. The movie catalog reminds me of the really bad music posted on websites for musicians. You have to spend hours listening to the crap in the hopes you will find the diamond in the ruff. The only good entertainment on Amazon and NF are the Original series they have put out. Some are great, some just good enough to watch, and others leave you wondering why they ever bothered to make it.
In any case, this film left me wondering why they bothered to make it.

However, there is another element/ This element has been done in other movies though in this movie I believe it worked better than in some other movies. The element is that people can change. The scifi element was used to effect the change in a person devoid of all social graces due to a rare brain injury when young.  The injury left him with a moral code of you hurt me I hurt you worse. This may sound as though the hero of the piece started out as a sociopath. He, however, had a severe brain injury and thus was not mentally ill but mentally impaired by the injury. Through the science fiction element of the plot he...well that is as far as I will go so as to not spoil it. Costner does a good job as the hero who starts out as basically a reactive menace to society, meaning his code of you hurt me, I hurt you worse got him locked away, chained up and treated like an animal.

7728310,5,B01DZQ10M2,"I really don't understand why this movie has such a low IMDB rating. Maybe there wasn't enough stunts, car crashes, bloody deaths (although there were more than enough for me) for what action thrillers have become. I am not sure what the movies are like now. I probably haven't seen an action thriller in 15 years. No kidding. The sci-fi was interesting and potentially achievable within the next thirty years, which is as scary as it is exciting.

Gary Oldman turned in his usual outstanding performance. Tommy Lee Jones pulled off the role of the Doctor/Researcher as naturally as he has in countless other movies. But it is Kevin Costner who convincingly portrayed a sociopath, a loving father and husband as well as the bad-ass CIA agent he takes the place of that carries this movie. That's a lot to ask of an actor in a single movie, but Costner was so believable! I wanted Jericho, Costner's character, to succeed. I felt I needed him to succeed and to morph into a different man",1470528000,,986,4.666666666666667
7728311,5,B01DZQ10M2,"Surprisingly exceeded my expectation!  I find that movies with Ryan Reynolds or Gary Oldman are usually of superior quality. To a lesser degree, same with Tommy Lee Jones.  This movie has all three, so I was expecting Good....but this was GREAT!  I have only recently become a fan of Kevin Costner, though he was excellent as Robin Hood back in the 1990's, little else he did was all that rewarding in my book. Here, he is perfect for the role.

PROS: A little bit of sci fi, mixed with great action, suspense, some tear-jerking emotional moments makes for a worthwhile and entertaining motion picture. The title and underplayed thumbnail art will deceive you, as it did me.  I passed by it many times since its release.  Glad I finally stopped and gave it a chance.
CONS: Bizarre, somewhat predictable, no big plot twists

I rented it first, then decided it was worth purchasing. I am zany like that. I check out a movie first, and if it is something my family or friends would enjoy, I add it to my library. This is definitely a keeper.",1470528000,23,1038,4.548387096774194
7728312,5,B01DZQ10M2,"I remember Costner as a young hotshot actor and have watched his movies over the years, but there is an amazing depth to his performance in this film. A brain damaged kid turned psychopathic adult and thrown away as a forgotten man in prison gets experimental brain surgery due to a desperate terrorist threat that a dead spy's memories can resolve. It's a good cast--Reynolds seemed a bit off as the agent being hunted down at the start, but he isn't in it that long. Several scenes are fraught with terror and suspense. The armageddon scenario is a bit Hollywood, but given the world situation, it is an uncomfortable reminder of how close the edge could be. Enjoyable action thriller.

7728317,1,B01DZQ10M2,"Criminal, released April/16 stars,among others,Kevin Costner,Ryan Reynolds,Gary Oldman,Tommy Lee Jones and Scott Adkins. What should have been a powerful film with a powerhouse cast is a total and boring waste of almost two hours of film.
The plot finds Oldman as the head of a CIA unit in London. His operative Reynolds is trying to get a man called the Dutchman to deliver him a bag of cash for his troubles. Mr. D.it seems has secured the launch codes to the world's nuclear arsenals and his hack code is why he is such a high priority. A Spanish nutball also has designs on Mr. D.In fact he wants his former employee back into his heinous fold. Reynolds is caught by the Spaniard and is tortured to death before his CIA buddies can get to him.
Back at CIA HQ Oldman gets into contact with Jones who is a scientist who has experimented with the transference of thought patterns from one life form into another. His only success has been in mice. Now it's showtime,and Oldman wants Reynolds thoughts transferred into another human so they can find the whereabouts of the cash. The human they pick is a totally mind bent mother played by Costner,straight out of prison.
The procedure goes off and Costner feigns any knowledge of new thoughts and feelings on the outside,while inside his head is filled with all sorts of memories from Reynolds. On his way back to prison Costner escapes and he tries to figure out the location of the money for himself.
Costner makes a trip to Reynolds house once,then later comes back to explain the crazy situation to Reynolds wife. She figures the cash must be in the museum where she works. All would seem to be alright if it were not for the fact the the Spaniard nutball has also been tracking Costner along with the CIA.He eventually intervenes threatening to kill Reynolds wife and daughter if he doesn't come up with the dough.
The Spaniard sends his female hench-girl to locate Costner and Mr. D.She shoots Mr. D.while Costner kills her. He retrieves the program from the computer and delivers it to the Spaniard at the airport and saves Reynolds wife and daughter. Oldman is totally beside himself because the program is in the wrong hands. Costner tells him to chill,as Mr. D.reprogrammed the software to cause an explosion with the start of any nearby transmission. And of course the inevitable explosion finds one less nut job in the world.
The film ends as Costner gets one of his wishes and that is to stand on the beach where Reynolds and his wife had their honeymoon. Reynolds wife and daughter join him there courtesy of Oldman, who posits that he may offer him a job.
Olman's charcater in this film is in a perpetual state of anxiety and foaming at the mouth whenever provoked,which doesn't take much. Poor Tommy Lee has absolutely no where to go in the film and  he seems to be almost on the verge of walking out of every scene in embarrassment. Costner has played these strong silent types in films like The Postman and Waterworld. At least in those there was a bit of depth and we had some empathy for his characters. In this film,he is as wooden as a tree stump. I feel the worst for Scott Akins. A great action star who had absolutely zip to do except to stand and looked concerned whenever the director yelled""action"".Kind of an oxymoron,wouldn't you say? Lastly,the film as a whole runs FAR too long and after about the first 10-15 minutes leaves you wanting to go away....anywhere but in front of the set. The movie delves into detail after unwanted detail and as a result it's a stop and go ride that is about as appealing as anal surgery. And supposedly half smart people pick a raving criminal psycho to put a man's thoughts into....? Does anyone see some kind of problem with that outcome?The characters in this film didn't think so!
Technically the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:35:1,but there are no extras.
In conclusion save your money for this total borefest. Each character portrayal is like a card board cut out;all look,no depth. The plot is windy and confusing and is far too long. The editor should be strung up and fed to the birds. Not recommended to any one at anytime.",1470441600,,4145,4.60893098782138

I love movies, get to view many, enjoying most........not this one.  How it got a 4 star rating, i don't know.",1470355200,,404,4.0125
7728324,4,B01DZQ10M2,"It's synchronicity for me. Just yesterday I put Kevin Costner's face as the backdrop on my computer at work. Why Costner? Because he is the most handsome man in the universe and even if you make him grow out his hair to look like a psychotic wild man chained in a prison cell or if you chop all that off and leave him with a cute little mohawk and sophisticated half beard, he still wins as the most handsome. Just saying
.
The fact that he starts the film ""Criminal"" as a psychopath makes for interesting background until the viewer learns that he has had trouble his entire life. You see, his dear dad threw him out the car window when he was a kid because dear dad is not really his dad. That one little piece of information explains so much. So why does the government get him out of prison?  Gary Oldman's character (who grossly overacts) needs a human who won't be missed to use as a vehicle for his dead agent's brain. The agent knows where their expert to prevent nuclear disaster is hidden away. Oldman wants to inject brain matter into their psychopath so they can learn the whereabouts of their expert.

So that's the premise. The rest is hide and seek games, thriller quests, murder and mayhem, you know, the usual. However, this updating of the Frankenstein story is skewed enough to keep it interesting. The doctor (Tommy Lee Jones who looks 100) wants humane treatment of the two-plex man, Oldman just wants the secret location, the crazed terrorist just wants the codes to nuclear devastation, and the dead agent's daughter wants love for the ""monster.""

Costner is always Costner: he's getting better and better with age and gives that mournful and touching portrayal of a man once horrifically violent, now oddly tender. His scenes alone are worth the price of admission.

The ocean has a key role in Costner/Agent's life. As Shakespeare once wrote--and this becomes the summary of the plot: ""All's well that ends well."" And the story ends at the ocean.",1470355200,,1971,4.638968481375358

Ryan dies early on but his brains are transplanted into Kevin Costner's character and Tommy Lee is the surgeon who performs the change.  It shows how Costner goes from a rough sadistic no conscience type of killer to a person who feels what Ryan felt before he died and Kevin tries to fulfill the mission Ryan started.

7728370,3,B01DZQ10M2,"Criminal is based on a great idea, which is scientifically plausible; but it loses momentum.  The plot sags and the pacing slows, but the acting is incredible.  The characters are believable.  I personally watched it through because I HAD to know how this terrible situation would resolve.  And trust me, the situation gets pretty bad.  Which is fun, right?

Criminal is not a movie you re-watch, but it's a solid rental.  Costner's character is both troubling and endearing, especially when his mind merges with the slain agent's memories.  This makes the slower pacing interesting at least.  The main character transforms from within and because of external realities beyond his control.  Very different.

Gary Oldman screams a lot.  As if to keep us awake.  That was annoying.

Also, the ending is unrealistic.  Happily ever after with a potential serial killer?  Ummm, no.",1469836800,,876,5.1063829787234045

7728372,3,B01DZQ10M2,"With a cast that includes Kevin Costner, Gary Oldman, Tommy Lee Jones and Ryan Reynolds, I had high expectations for the movie. This is mostly a Costner focused film though as Reynolds is only in the movie in the first 5 to 10 minutes.  The acting is ok for the most part, which is to be expected from the high caliber of actors here but Costners grunting throughout the movie was a bit annoying as he tries to play up the brain damaged character a bit too much.

The acting isn't the issue with me though, it is the poorly written script and subpar plotline that gets a bit nonsensical at times.  There is action in this movie but there are also long stretches of a dull story that makes the movie feel longer than its nearly 2 hour run time.  This movie tries to blend a bit of Bourne with a sci-fi twist and to me it doesnt quite mesh together as well as I had hoped.  The sci-fi aspect had a bit of a simplistic explanation and feel to it with the movie relying on a lot (I think way too many) flashbacks to give you a feel for the Reynolds character (Bill Pope) that is only shown through the eyes of Costners character (Jerico) as Reynolds is not seen past the first few minutes of the movie (other than a mirror reflection), even in the flashbacks.  Even with the sci-fi aspect of the movie, this really ends up being a run of the mill action/spy movie that really ends up predictably with an ending that if you don't think about how unrealistic it is, is ok, but to me a bit silly.

With all of its flaws though, I don't think it is a great movie by any means, but it is a watchable movie and an ok action thriller.

7728373,4,B01DZQ10M2,"Mixing medical technology with espionage may not be a novel idea but in the hands of writers Douglas Cook and David Weisberg and director Ariel Vromen the marriage produces a nonstop action film that ranks up there with the best of them to appeal to the audience need for grit. The very solid cast makes it happen and keeps our attention from square one.

Bill Pope (Ryan Reynolds) is a CIA agent on a mission in London tracking down a shadowy hacker nicknamed ""The Dutchman"" (Michael Pitt). When he gets mysteriously ambushed and killed, an experimental procedure performed by Dr. Franks (Tommy Lee Jones) is used to transfer his memories into dangerous ex-convict Jericho Stewart (Kevin Costner). When he wakes up with the CIA agent's memories, Jerichos mission is to find The Dutchman and eliminate him before the hacker launches ICBM's and starts World War III. But complications soon arise and the mission turns personal. Gary Oldman plays Quaker Wells, the man obsessed by his own manipulations to save the world from the enemy  including a mastermind Xavier Heimdahl (Jordi Moll&agrave;)  with the help of Jill Pope (Bills widow) played by newcomer Gal Gadot, and Marta Lynch (Alice Eve) et al.

This is a noisy but very fast paced action film with a brain  the script makes sense (memory transplantation as a means of saving the experience of a deceased CIA operative). One of the aspects of the memory transplantation is the fact that it gives the man without feeling Jericho the ability to feel and love  and that saves the film.

Quaker Wells (Oldman) works for the CIA and the agent that they had tracking a dangerous plot was just killed. He decides to try an experimental process which puts the memories of the dead agent into a vicious convict on death row and enlist him to help. They choose Jericho Stewart (Costner) but the memories that are implanted begin to mess with Stewart's mind, and Wells' mission. I was excited to see this movie for many reasons. One I am a huge fan of Costner and Oldman. Two, my favorite movie is JFK and its almost a reunion with those two and Tommy Lee Jones in this. I also thought the idea was interesting and due to all of that I had pretty high expectations for this. That said, I was not disappointed. This is not a masterpiece and isn't in my top 5 Costner movies but this is very entertaining, fast paced and one that I could watch a few times I think. The idea is along the lines of Self/Less which came out about a year ago, but this was no where near as disappointing as that one was. Overall, exciting and fast moving. A movie I really enjoyed even with the high expectations I had going in. Costner is the perfect choice for this. He plays the every man so perfect in all of his movies that you forget he is a dangerous murderer in this and actually root for him. Not many actors can do that.

Kevin Costner, in what I hope is a major career redemption, is astonishing. His tortured ""Jericho"" , who wakes up with his head full of thoughts not his own, is so impressively performed that you totally buy into it. Especially as he doesn't have much dialogue. Every aspect of Jericho, his indecisive walk, his wary gaze, is utterly transparent and convincing. Costner goes into Tom Hardy territory here, even beyond, and that is high praise for an actor who Hollywood probably wishes would just go away.

The rest of the cast are serious: Tommy Lee Jones as the most down to earth mad scientist you've ever seen, Gary Oldman as Dr. Frankenstein, and Ryan Reynolds, who is actually building up an impressive body of work (see The Nice Guys, hilarious). All the casting is good.

This film got no traction theatrically (at least here in LA, and I'm too lazy to look up the numbers) but Costner knocks it out of the park. Whatever his past sins, give him a chance on this one.",1469318400,,1202,4.529953917050691
