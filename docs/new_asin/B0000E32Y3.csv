Seriously, this set did not make me want to go out and purchase any acid or reefers at all, which I consider to be poor entertainment indeed.",1427328000,,350,4.287878787878788
8063596,4,B0000E32Y3,"An excellent assortment of campy health class classics! Most of these were originally shown in grade school classrooms between the 1940's and 1970's, to instill a strong sense of values. The 1979 film, ""Drugs Are Like That"" is definitely kinda fun as two kids build with legos and discuss the dangers of recreational drugs. With naration by Anita Bryant, the lego structure is far more sound than many of the arguments presented here. ""Sudden Birth"" is a bizarre low-budget training film for police officers to educate them on how to assist with child birth. The film actually features a live birth. ""Sally"" from 1979 follows the very realisticly portrayed life of a young teen becoming a woman. I was on the floor laughing when she and her best friend prank called her health teacher! The other DVD in the series, simply called ""Sex & Drugs"" is a little better, but this one is definitely worth owning. This DVD contains about 12 films, running around 3 hours total. I paid $1.75 plus shipping for this DVD, and it is well worth the price!

It's great for:

1) Classroom use for history or health lessons
2) Fun viewing at class reunion parties
3) People who enjoy campy shtick!

There are 8 DVDs in the Fantoma Educations Archive Series:
1)On the Job
2)Patriotism
3)Religion
4)Drivers Ed
5)Sex & Drugs
6)More Sex & Drugs
7)Social Engineering 101
8)Social Engineering 201

All of these videos are great and worth owning (especially because most of them can be purchased for under $5)",1338595200,2,1484,4.78515625
8063597,4,B0000E32Y3,"Although I agree with the other reviewer who says the first volume is better, this is still worth the price!  More great shorts featuring our favorite subjects-sex and drugs-are presented in either digitally mastered format or ""classroom experience"" (the sound of an old-school projector playing in the background like those ""live"" audience of screaming girls found on old '60s beat albums)!  How could you go wrong with such classics like ""Keep Off the Grass"" and the cautionary don't trust adults joint ""Red Light/ Green Light""?  This is a wonderful three hours of hanging out on the couch, getting the munchies, and having some laughs with like-minded friends.  I see this goes for cheap, so grab a copy (as well as Social Engineering, Patriotism, and the first volume of Sex & Drugs).",1203292800,,788,4.99236641221374
