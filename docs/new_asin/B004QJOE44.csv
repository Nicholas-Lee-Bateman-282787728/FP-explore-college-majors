4445529,4,B004QJOE44,"Here's a story about a little girl, Lucy, who is completely ignored by an absent mother and beaten by an unbalanced father.  She's put in a home that is run by the state.  The other kids in the home are older than Lucy and many of them are messed up.  The staff is incompetent and dysfunctional, (and worse.)  Lucy is small, powerless and alone.
At the end of the movie, which I won't spoil, we are invited to think about Lucy's future, and the multitude of kids who face a similar uncertain future, and perhaps the futures of our own kids.
The movie is convincing, heartbreaking and devastating.",1345334400,21,596,4.4907407407407405

4445531,5,B004QJOE44,I thought this was filmed beautifully. It felt as if you were sharing in her experiences. I thought Molly Windsor did a wonderful job at portraying the disposition of a sad child. Touching and sad. Cried during many parts. Beautiful film.,1329523200,2,238,4.829268292682927
4445532,5,B004QJOE44,"I found it superb, but it's not surprising this only had a limited art-house release:  its relentlessly lonely feel will really grind you down.  But I love depressing movies that don't provide much grounds for hope:  I wish they'd make more of them.

I could have sat there and watched this depressed, unwanted girl roam through London for hours and hours without getting bored.",1319155200,21,378,4.859375

She seems numbed by the drug use, criminality, promiscuous sex and deviant behaviors. There is an attempt to reunite with mum and dad and there are some religous flashbacks which I didn't understand.

4445534,5,B004QJOE44,The children did a great job with the acting and the plot was so sad.  A reminder that everyone has a different path in life and some of those paths suck.  The whole movie was nicely done.,1515628800,,188,4.054054054054054

4445536,5,B004QJOE44,"I was surprised that quite a few people didn't like this movie.  I feel it was grossly misjudged, or maybe they were raised in a such a way, that they could only see it as depressing.  It certainly isn't filled with kitten's, and puppies, and everything nice, that's what fairy tales are for.",1514764800,,292,4.490566037735849

Who can blame them for being ""over"" protective.",1513382400,,328,4.140625
4445540,1,B004QJOE44,The little girl in the movie did a good job but other than that this was an awful movie that dragged on. Not only did it drag on with very little dialogue it was difficult to tell when the little girl was fantasizing about the future or remembering something from the past.  It was so slow but I kept waiting for it to get better. It was difficult to decipher who worked at the children's home and the adolescents that lived there the behavior was the same. I live in the US and children's homes in the area of the country that I live in don't allow children to wander the streets unchaperoned; most also have separate homes for girls and boys.  I do realize that too many children are traumatized at home then traumatized again in the system. Every child needs and deserves unconditional love and it breaks my heart that so many don't get it.,1513209600,,843,4.3630573248407645
4445541,4,B004QJOE44,"This movie was very poignant in the way it portrayed life for the little girl in the ""care"" system. The abuse, in very graphic form gives a clear, unmistakable view of what children, already at risk have to endure when there is no clear, direct, and accountable oversight by those in authority. Moving a child from an abusive home environment to one that is supposed to give comfort, support, and care, but is just another abusive environment is appalling. The amount of coarse language was unfortunate. I understand the film-maker's need to be as realistic as possible. Sometimes you simply have to present things as they are to get a message across. This came through loud, and clear.",1512691200,,686,4.822033898305085
4445542,3,B004QJOE44,"My heart broke for the little girl in this movie. This is more of an indie movie. The story line is pretty much non existent, it drags on from beginning to end and there is very little dialogue, but I kept watching because I really wanted to see a happy ending for the poor girl. I'm guessing the director wanted to portray a more realistic story of a young girls suffering in a cold and uncaring world, which was very well presented. She has unfit and abusive parents and ends up in a home for homeless youth which doesn't turn out to be any better of a situation for her. She's exposed to things a child shouldn't have to witness and her innocence and sweet character just make you want to jump into the movie, rescue her, and give her all the love she deserves. If you've lost a parent or have been in the system as a child, you will definitely be able to relate to the emptiness and the lack of love and support afflicted upon this girl.",1511568000,,941,4.233333333333333

4445546,4,B004QJOE44,"after watching this, i gave it a lot of thought, surprised at how much, because it is not a great movie by any stretch. it's something to be endured, except for the talent and complete innocence of the child star. it's totally believable, what happens to this lovely little girl, and stunning in its impact. while i was upset by the violent opening scene and didn't want to watch further, i wanted to know what would happen, so i kept watching. the movie shows what can and does happen to an innocent child when no one cares, no one steps up for her. not even her parents, who can't/won't get it together to care for her. she is placed in situations that she should NEVER have had to experience, and yet those in charge, her teachers, social workers, carers, police, no one saw/cared enough to change/modify her living situation. even though it's clear (and would be clear to most of us) that this little girl's childhood innocence would be destroyed by the impact of the adult situations she's forced to experience. this movie makes very clear how disturbed/angry/violent youth get that way, and they then turn into adults with huge problems. i understand that the filmmaker, the actress samantha morton, wanted to make this movie to highlight the abuses she suffered as a child, and that she greatly toned down (!!) the abuses she suffered, for the movie. she did this so that children as young as 13 could view this movie. it was shown on tv before it was released to movie theaters. message received! for this reason, i recommend this movie. it's powerful in its impact. and it could change lives if it is more widely seen. might be a good movie for older teens to view in a classroom setting, for discussion, or for parents to watch with teens at home. movie should be screened first by adults, to understand what teens would be seeing. the filmmaker says ages 13 and up, but perhaps older teens, depending on their maturity level, might be a little better.",1511049600,,1962,4.624641833810888

4445559,5,B004QJOE44,"This movie was heartbreaking so have a box of tissues by your side.  I believe that a person who can put themselves in her shoes or who has worked with, very closely known, or has gone through any type of abuse will more fully understand the drawn-out scenes and quiet demeanor.  I didn't feel this was a slow-moving movie it just shows what this girl endures every single day.  Had it moved along faster you wouldn't feel the hopelessness and loneliness one feels inside when they truly have no one and nothing to look forward to.  The long drawn out stares show the lack of love she's feels and has felt her entire life.  In no way can she feel loved or safe and protected.  In her world it's cold even the social worker doesn't understand, it's just a job for her.  For the most part, the adults in her life are in turmoil and can in no way help her nor do they want to.  Nothingness seems to exist in her world but it's wonderful that she can still cling onto her religious beliefs and commitment to God to help pull her through.  That glimmer of light that shines through in her horrible life.  This wasn't a religious movie, but it left us feeling like she would find her way.  This deserves a much higher overall rating.  Anyone who gave this a bad review needs to take a good look at themselves in the mirror.  An excellent movie that needs to be seen.",1508630400,3,1360,4.307086614173229
4445560,4,B004QJOE44,"A slow story told with a lot of flashbacks by the lead girl. I gave it 4 stars because I like a story line as opposed to drama and explosions. This movie slowly, very slowly, rolls out the little girl's cold transfer from an abusive home to a group home setting. You will be asked to endure drawn out and sometimes painful moments of light in the girl's face which are religious moments. The movie will ask you to hope beyond anything that nothing bad happens to the little girl. That's the only kind of suspense you'll get, hoping she doesn't get trapped in situations we wouldn't want our daughters in.
The little girl gets a dose of reality inside the group home as she sees other struggle to cope with their issues.
She herself is very obedient, mostly silent and pained. If you like a story only then you'll like this film.
Don't expect anything like great cinematography, costume design or great writing. Don't expect good production, just accept the young child's story because that's what this film is about, her story, her experiences and the experiences of the girl closest to her. The first 20 min of the movie were painfully slow. I started not to finish but I'm happy I did.",1508544000,2,1187,4.5514018691588785

4445581,2,B004QJOE44,The reason I don't like it is not only the foul language but that a little girl actress (who is the only beautiful character inside and out) actually plays a part in this kind of movie. this is a very disturbing movie depicting the abuse a child can suffer at the hands of her parents but also in the system where no one cares about anyone. A bunch of broken people even so called professionals are broken. I think the little girl deserves more than ten stars but I think that the message which needs to be gotten across can be done without the foul language. The child was obviously beaten and bruised but the movie didn't show her being beaten--we know the troubled teen room mate was being sexually abused but at least the covers were over and we all know that is what was happening. We know the language used so don't need to hear the words--blurb them out.

Little Molly Windsor does an incredible job portraying a little girl in the system.  With parents so wrapped up in their own needs, they just can't be bothered with her.  The movie exposes all the problems with the system and these lost children subjected to the inability of the people that are responsible for them.

4445588,5,B004QJOE44,"First, the rating of 5 stars, says ""I love it"", but there is not really any way to love such a painful, aching, reality based movie as this. BUT the 5 stars is there for the importance of what this movie portrays. The 5 stars is for the usefulness of this movie in giving people who do not live in this subculture, a taste of the helplessness and hopelessness of children who are not loved. The 5 stars is also for the therapy value in use with children in situations like this...to talk with them about their feelings, to start to open a can that is tightly shut for fear of what is in it. 5 stars to show the families and caregivers of these children to give them just a tiny taste of what life is like for a child like this, to help them understand just a bit better what might be going through their minds, hearts as they try to cope with what they have experienced and experience in life.

Second, who wrote the review for this movie? Whoever did doesn't seem to have watched the movie at all. The review said:
""look at the strength and resilience of youth. Eleven-year-old Lucy seeks refuge from her abusive father. Placed in a tumultuous foster home, Lucy befriends her rebellious teenage roommate Lauren, and together they navigate the cold and uncaring world before them. ""

It wasn't a look at the ""strength and resilience of youth"", it was a look at the helplessness of children that are not loved, in a system that is often as abusive as the situation they were removed from. It expressed the ""no win"" situation they find themselves in.

Lucy did NOT befriend her much older and messed up room mate. There was no way she could. In part because when you are as vulnerable as this little eleven year old child, as betrayed by the people that should love and protect you; you can barely risk having an opinion, much less a friend, or offering help to anyone.

Third. Though the subjects are mature, if you are dealing with children that are in the system; these children at a young age are exposed to very mature subject matter. It will not be their tender years that you protect by not showing them this, as much as your tender feelings that do not want to be ruffled by revealing that you know this and are not acting against it, verbally, mentally, behaviorally. The FIRST thing you CAN do...the FIRST step is to FACE the situation. to acknowledge the pain and the damage caused, and to bear at least enough discomfort to be able to look the system and the children in the eyes, straight on that have to live it, deal with it, remember it. There is no nudity. There is a suggestion of sexual behavior, but no grunting and groaning. There may be bad words though I did not hear them, perhaps because of the heavy British accents of the actors.

Spoiler alert. I am going to say what happens in this movie. I am going to make observations along the way.

The movie opened with a scene that cause me a great deal of stress, and fear. In a bare room a unkempt father is upset with his thin little girl. (we find out latter she is Lucy and is eleven.) He becomes louder and more agitated as the child stands there frozen in the fear of anticipation at what she must be aware is coming. I kept thinking to myself that I should TURN the channel! I don't want to see what happens! BUT I remember reading in ""Mrs. Miniver,"", or at least the message I thought I got from ""Mrs Miniver"" was...that the LEAST I can give, the bare minimum I OWE to those that go through such things as war, or injustice...is NOT TO LOOK AWAY.  The scene ends with the child being beaten with a belt.

Then the child is in school, and here and there in the community, with a sad, non-reactive face; and I keep wondering what is going to happen? Will someone see bruises? Will someone notice anything? Will someone at least see how sad and deflated this child looks? And nothing seems to happen.

Then we move to another scene where the child, Lucy, is being taken away by a social worker type... a brusk, uncaring, all business woman; who focuses on the task at hand and seems to have no feeling, no recognition, or empathy for what this child's life is, has been, will be. The child asks to go live with her mother and is brushed off. The child asks to go live at her previous foster home and is also brushed off. She is told she will go live in a children's home. She has no belongings. Nothing except what she stands up in, and is offered none. She hasn't eaten except lunch at school, and is offered nothing when she arrives. She is dumped there, without as much care as you would give to bringing a new dog into a new home.

They arrive, and I was startled by the scene; it was so real, so stark, so frustrating. The door was opened by a very smart mouthed, hyper boy of about 12; and when the authority figure, the social worker asks for another worker that IS there, the boy tells her that worker is not there and to go away...rudely. Repeatedly. She has to push by, and the workers inside finally are aware someone is at the door and come.  It was a very unsettling scene.  If you have ever dealt with a child that refused to acknowledge your authority and threw it in your face with a raised finger or more; and you are stymied because you can't believe it is happening, you can't believe the situation is as it is, you are at a standstill. A LOT like having to deal with dishonest government....if those in charge, those in control are not behaving, lie, and disregard the rules WHAT CAN YOU DO?

Then, without much care, this 11 year old traumatized child is put in charge of a 16 year old acting out female, who has obviously a great number of emotional issues herself...is told that since she is always acting immature, but insisting that she IS mature, she will be given a chance to prove she can be mature by having this new little girl as her roommate. At which point this chronically angry teen starts shouting she will not, she doesn't want her...making a bad affair even worse.

Don't assume that children will have sympathy for each other since they have been through these situations themselves, they won't. They are more likely to take advantage, to stick emotional pins in each other. After all, we learn love, by being loved, we learn kindness, humanity, social consciousness, and almost everything we as humans do...from each other. Monkey see, monkey do. These children are ""the unloved"" and they do not know how to give love. In fact, love, humanity, kindness, gentleness is more often seen as a sign of weakness and vulnerability in this group. Making friends is desired, badly wanted for protection, sustenance...but if you do...everything you love...everything you call your own..can be taken from you in a moment, and there is nothing you can do about it.  Better not to care, not to love, not to have...than to go through the pain of losing it.

The teen, takes the child the next day.  She is not attentive. She largely walks ten feet ahead and so fast the child has to hurry to keep up. BUT she is not unkind, she shows the child the tiniest bit of attention when she is flattered by Lucy.  And this attention, this ""kindness"" is so needed by the soul of the Lucy, that like a man dying of thirst welcomes water, Lucy.. cautiously takes... it in.

This is not befriending. Lucy is at the mercy of Lauren. Lauren is NOT navigating anything. If anything, Lauren, the teenager goes on to demonstrate more and more ways NOT to navigate the system successfully.

 Lauren shoplifts and is arrested, and Lucy along with her.  Again shocking is the defiance Lauren shows of the system and people in it. It shows she has NO respect for the system, no belief in the system...AND it shows the system is of no value to her, and is NOT effectual and useful as a system in society.  Who cares? Not the down trodden, cast away children and people. They see themselves through societies eyes as: useless, valueless, disgusting.... and so they do what they think they are.

Then back to the children's home; where the staff are almost totally overwhelmed by the numbers, lack of supervision, lack of training, lack of standards or guidelines...it seems.  This is where Lucy is made aware that one of the counselors is having sexual relations with the 16 year old, Lauren. Because, right in the room when Lucy is there, and obviously awake and able to hear all...without fear of being told on...he comes over and over again. There is no emotional closeness of the counselor to Lauren, only the use of her, as if she is toilet paper to meet his needs.

How does a child put any of this into words. And if you can't put something into words, how can you think about it? And if you can't think about it, how can you process it? And if you can't process it, how can you resolve the emotional turmoil it creates in yourself. You can't. And this is where ""acting out"" comes from.

But Lucy is afraid enough, canny enough, aware enough to know there is no help...or probably would be little to no effectual help for her if she said anything. In fact, she probably would be the one to suffer, if she tried to help. How sad it is that we, that our children learn this lesson. It not only kills bravery, but it kills us, inside. And that is what you see happening with little Lucy.

There is a party, New Years I think, and even the staff are doing drugs and offering it to the children. Even the staff that we have come to see a tiny bit of kindness and concern for the children...look away.  Till the staff member that is molesting Lauren (sometimes with her OK, sometimes not) becomes upset with Lauren...it seems because she has refused to perform,, and humiliates her tearing her down in the middle of them all...saying everyone knows she is always THE problem, will BE a problem.

I can FEEL the way such words add to the already overwhelming sense of not being loved, valued, worth anything...it is like being put in cement and having it harden and tighten around you so that eventually it kills you. By now in the movie my chest is hurting, and I am wondering if I have angina.  CAN YOU IMAGINE, if just watching this for an hour cause such stress...how living it your whole life...from the time you were an infant....this would be?  Can you imagine how as a child learns to speak from those around them, they also learn how to feel...and THIS is what they have learned!

(Did you know, a child growing up in a bad situation has their brain chemistry actually changed! Their DNA actually changed! That they become more prone to all sorts of illnesses, including mental ones for the rest of their lives? I want you to ask yourself, if so many of our children are being raised this way...how do we expect they will not grow up to be problems to society...and bad parents ...sending the problems on into our future)

The ending I will leave for you to watch.

I want to ask...who reviewed this movie?!?  What was their IQ!  That they paid little attention, AND knew almost nothing about what they were writing seems obvious. AND AGAIN IMDB (rating 6.9) shows that it's reviewers are idiots also.

Who writes these blurbs for Amazon anyway? They really did a disservice to a film that is important, and extremely well acted, with cinematography that supported the messages.

What I would like for people who watch this film is:
1.  to ask themselves if and when they see a child that looks alone, depressed, in need....what will I do? .Will I look away, or find a way to help?
2. to prepare themselves, as to what they will be willing to do, be willing to give when they see this? Recognition, time, effort, money, publicity...
3. And most importantly, to sensitize themselves to the silent, unobtrusive pain of children...even teens...who move among us...so that we are aware of what we ARE seeing...and aware that there IS a need...and at least feel shame if not motivation to step up to the plate and put our hands, hearts, and souls to the task.",1504483200,2,11939,4.463728191000918

I had the English subtitles turned on because of the accents to make sure I wouldn't miss any of the dialogue, so I am reasonably certain about the word count. She shows no emotion, her situation is unfortunate but all too common, and after reading other reviews, I could see that this is one of those ""message"" movies that doesn't think it needs to tell an interesting story as well as send a message. As a writer, I know the first rule of storytelling is you must draw in your audience from the very beginning or you will very quickly lose them. This movie lost me.

4445593,2,B004QJOE44,"I watched this movie from beginning to end, expecting that at some point a plot would surface or that at least one character would be developed.  Unfortunately, this film offered neither.  There is no story line to speak of:  Child gets beaten, child goes to children's home, child has fleeting, reunion with down-and-out parents, child goes back to children's home.  We never come to know the main character, who barely speaks and whose face shows nothing in the way of emotion.  Okay, I get the concept that she's become emotionally-blunted, but geez--you've got to give the viewer something to chew on.  The chaos and dysfunctionality of the children's home is well-depicted, but once again we never get to know any of the supporting characters or what makes them tick.  Due to the thick Irish accents, the angry, rapid-fire exchanges, and a constant, cacophonous and chaotic ""talking over"" of the characters, it's nearly impossible to follow what meager dialog exists.  Add to that a very weird and ineffectual set of visual effects ostensibly designed to create the impression of a dream-like disassociation and an intermittent soundtrack of ""Twilight Zone"" sounds that become so loud and annoying at times that the volume has to be turned down.  On the whole, this was a very disappointing film, providing nothing in the way of insight or understanding and even less in terms of art.",1492300800,,1389,5.004347826086956

4445603,5,B004QJOE44,"I've loved this film for a long time.  Watched again last night with my daughter.  I wanted to her to see it not to make her feel bad, but to make her aware that sometimes that classmate in school who keeps to themselves, has no friends, maybe even purposely gets into trouble is probably navigating difficult circumstances at home.  I want my kids to stop and think that perhaps there is a very good reason for their behavior and\or isolation.  Before we watched it I warned her it was going to be very sad, but made a point to explain that the film was about the woman who made it and she is now a successful director.  In many ways it's may be too heavy for kids and I was conflicted about her watching it.  We did fast forward through the beating and the rape.  It was worth it though.  She really liked it and I do think it affected her in a way that she may now stop and think and talk to that ""strange"" or ""quiet"" kid.  To extend a branch of friendship even if most of her classmates do not.

One thing I find a little funny.  There are reviews that declare this movie is slow and boring.  Well, my 9 year old happily sat through it and enjoyed it very much.  I wasn't sure she would and would not have made her continue watching if she didn't want to.  On the other hand if a 9 year old can sit through a slower paced art film that says a lot about adults who can't.  If you watch every film with the expectation you are going to be ""entertained"" and get frustrated when you're not, there are going to be a lot of incredibly good films you'll miss out on.",1447804800,6,1563,4.112211221122112

4445619,4,B004QJOE44,"This film is strikingly documentary-like, and very well acted. The child actress whose character is at the center of the film also does a lot of acting that involves no dialogue... and the expression on her face, and in her eyes, is often difficult (emotionally) for us to 'experience'.

Others have commented regarding the gist of the film, and the events which unfold in it. I simply want to add some of my thoughts and reaction to the film.

There is so much that is realistic about this film, and it can feel somewhat 'long' to watch, given the pace at which things occur -- but the pace, and what takes place, and in the way that it does, is also part of what is effective about the film -- you almost feel as though you're 'witnessing' periods of time in this little girl's life 'along with her' (in a way), and she isn't so much 'experiencing' her life as she is 'existing' within it -- as though 'doing time' (and during her one and only childhood, at that) -- which is part of the heartbreak in watching this. She is 'in' a system that is supposed to help her, but she is all but cast adrift within it, and must seemingly go it alone, in ways...and is practically 'invisible'. Despite the physical presence of various (and older) human beings, it is as though she is forced to exist within a kind of nurtureless ghost town... and you desperately want to pluck her from the film and find her a loving home.

One of the more subtlely accretive heart-tugging aspects of this film is the fact that the child seen onscreen for the majority of the film so often has a 'neutral' and emotionally 'numb' face, and is quiet/silent -- when what we expect (and want) to see a child's life involve (though understandably, would not see in this type of circumstance) is happiness, smiling, and laughter. The sight -- and knowledge -- of an emotionally numb child, and knowing that this type of survival mechanism (which is essentially the mind's way of preserving itself, and allowing the human being in question to function) emerges as a result of great emotional pain and trauma -- is disturbing, to say the least, and is uncomfortable to watch, partly due to the fact that it 'goes against nature' -- children should not 'know' the type of emotional pain that results in such... but so many do.

The ultimate knife twist in all of this is that we see/'know' how gentle, kind, and sweet this child is -- and she is essentially guardianless, and, as the title says, unloved -- and additionally, as the title indicates, by its use of the word ""The"" in ""The Unloved"", this little girl is but one of many such children (and whether in England or elsewhere) whose lives do not include this basic human need, let alone during the timeframe when it is needed most -- in childhood. A powerful aspect of this film is in showing that such children also often experience the apathy of the society in which they live (and that of dysfunctional institutions purported to help (just because a system exists doesn't mean it's effective -- or truly *trying*)), and can and often do experience such apathy -- and neglect -- for prolonged periods of time (and time is disproportionately perceived/'felt'/'experienced' when we're children -- a year can feel like an eternity).

These children are all but 'pushed aside', and practically forgotten -- which is an abomination.

This film is the first film directed by Samantha Morton, who in addition to being a remarkable actress, was made a ward of the court at the age of 8, and spent years in group homes and foster care (in England) -- this film is based on her experiences, and that of others who she knew... and while many refer to this as her ""directorial debut"", she considers this a one-off experience -- she doesn't consider herself to be a director, but felt compelled to get this story ""out of her system""... and she began storyboarding it when she was 16. Samantha stated in an interview that ""The Unloved"" is a censored version of what took place; she intentionally diluted its content, and omitted aspects of violence, sexual abuse, and torture. She conveyed, ""I'm not going to make a children's film and turn it into a horror film. I wanted to make a film that someone from the age of 13 could watch and get, and it would change them."" Samantha intentionally left various aspects unanswered/unexplained, due to its reflecting the reality that for many children, they never get an explanation for why various things did or did not take place (such as why one of their parents wasn't around, or beat them, or abandoned them).

This is a bleak film that is depressing to watch, but it is also important, and worth seeing.",1386892800,10,4661,4.621980676328502

This film details the life of a girl whose mother deserted the family and whose father loses custody of her. She ends up in a house full of other castaway children. And in doing so is exposed to drugs, sex, and lots of unsavory characters. Molly Windsor carries this film. She plays a quiet bright ""good girl"" who just wants to be with parents but who just keeps falling back into the system because neither of her parents can really love her. I think Molly was picked for the part because she is so lovable and it is hard for us to understand how her parents could not put her life ahead of their own desires. The pain in her face is unbearable to look at and sometimes you just cry. This is not a happy film but it is one that needed to be made. This happens to a LOT of kids.
