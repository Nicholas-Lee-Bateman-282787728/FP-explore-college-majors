3039236,5,B000ZDQI44,"STORY - This History Channel documentary with Tom Brokaw as host highlights the most turbulent year of, arguably, the most turbulent decade in our country's history. It is hard to dispute the statement that America changed dramatically during the sixties and 1968 seemed to be the year that everything changed. There were two major assassinations, a riot at the Democratic convention, violent protests on college campuses, and a very contentious presidential campaign with the sitting president, Lyndon Johnson, opting not to run again. Drug use was rampant among the 'hippie' generation. But there was also the 'silent majority' who continued to pursue their version of the American way. These views clashed in often violent ways stretching the ability of law enforcement to contain them at times. Not to mention the race issue inflamed by the murder of Martin Luther King, Jr. Did I mention feminism and the rise of the women's liberation movement? And for good measure add a resurrected politician named Richard Nixon into the mix. It was fitting that the year should culminate in one of the greatest achievements of mankind, the Apollo 8 Space Mission to the moon. 1968 is not just a year in the past, it is an experience that still influences society today among those who experienced it and those influenced by them. If you missed the sixties, this is a good place to start in understanding what happened. Plenty of good archival footage from actual events. The low ratings of some people seem to have more to do with what's missing than what's included. Unfortunately a 90 minute documentary about 1968 will inevitably leave out some important events or different perspectives. WWW.LUSREVIEWS.BLOGSPOT.COM.",1218844800,6,1713,5.14336917562724
3039237,3,B000ZDQI44,"This documentary DVD is of value as an introduction to the late 1960's period, and an interesting retrospective for people who experienced the turmoil of the times.  The piece also gives some perspectives on how the repercussions of the events of 1968 continue to be felt.

Brokaw's companion piece to his book ""Boom: Voices of the Sixties"" reviews the most significant events in this turbulent year and places the events in their historical context.  The Tet offensive in Vietnam, the assassinations of Martin Luther King and Bobby Kennedy, student uprisings, the Chicago Democratic Convention and increasing black militancy all receive balanced treatment.  In addition, the documentary examines the evolving New Left, civil rights and counter culture movements, as well as the reaction to them on the part of the larger ""silent majority.""  The beginnings of the feminist movement are also described.

Brokaw's interviews include participants in events as well as people who experienced them from the outside.  Events are treated with balance, as when the Chicago convention riots are described by both a policeman and a protestor who were present that night.  Pat Buchanan is especially effective at highlighting how 1968 became a pivotal year for the rise of conservatism in presidential politics.

The program suffers from some sloppy and inattentive editing.  For example, the interview of the army nurse in Vietnam only includes part of a story which, in the book version, helps explain the deep emotional impact of the war on her life.  Also, the Arlo Guthrie segment on ""Alice's Restaurant"" comes across as a sentimental sing-along, and misses an opportunity to use the song to highlight the attitudes of many young people toward the military draft.  Sometimes the editing feels ""soft"" and the material is a bit redundant around the commercial breaks.

Most annoying, especially when viewing the piece more than once, is the soundtrack on the disc.  According to the DVD box, the soundtrack music on the original History Channel broadcast was replaced for the DVD version.  The unlicensed, generic ""tunes"" that frame the documentary feel cheesy and cheap.  Studio musicians attempt to replicate the sound of the times with tracks that sound familiar but never quite emerge as recognizable tunes.

All in all, ""1968"" is an interesting and useful retrospective on a very difficult year in American history.  More attention to detail and more resources dedicated to music licensing would have made this a powerful piece, but it's still worth a look.",1214352000,18,2554,5.233415233415234
3039238,2,B000ZDQI44,"For those who are looking for a one sided, liberal bent view on the 1960's and specifically 1968 than you have found the perfect video from the History Channel with Tom Brokaw.  The film covers 1968 but as other previous reviewers have written, Brokaw narrows his view of 1968 to focus on what we already know: that the anti-war movement was in full swing against the rising conflict in Vietnam, that 1968 was an election year with the Democrats (whom Brokaw clearly favors in the film) not taking charge against the Republicans nor siding with the anti-war movement as Brokaw seems to feel they should have done so in hindsight, that drugs, peace symbols, and ""love"" where found in San Francisco, and that 1968 saw the murders of MLK and RFK.

But where is the history that we need to know?  While I think we should know the above, most of us study this in high school or college history courses.  The philsophies, the music, the art: all these are missing from the film.  We understand that 1968 was a difficult year in America and around the world but tell us where those horrors and triumphs came from.  This is the problem of isolating history down to one year.  The 1960's were not based on one event or one movement but on several factors coming together in a pluralistic culture found only in the United States.  The 1960's in America were based on the confrontation between two clashing cultures, generations, and values.  Brokaw seems to have missed this point.

Overall I felt that after watching the film that Brokaw had his own agenda.  Perhaps he followed the History Channels writers but either way the film grossly misses the point of 1968 and the 1960's in general.  Brokaw would have us to believe that 1968 would have been different had not Nixon won the White House, had the Democrats listened to the ""majority"" of Americans who were against the Vietnam War, and had the drugs, peace, and love been truly allowed to radiate in the lives of all Americans.  Sadly, he was terribly wrong.  This bias opinion shapes the film and misses the lessons we can learn from history itself and the 1960's to be specific.",1207440000,7,2127,4.637333333333333
3039239,2,B000ZDQI44,"As a person who lived through 1968 I was disappointed by the limited vision of Tom Brokaw and the documentary maker. They took about 5 events of significance and revisited them continually throughout the film. We know there was civil unrest...we know that the  Vietnam War was raging but cover them and move on to other developements. This is very much about the politics of this year and not much else. They say History is a dry subject. This DVD does not do much to dispel that theory. History is not only about events it is about people and there was little or no attempt to cover the  people that made this such an interesting year. I remember Jackie married Onassis and there was nothing else on the front of newspapers for 5 days...didn't even rate a subliminal blip on this interviewers radar....USS Pueblo captured by the North Koreans..(could have been mentioned I may have been fast forwarding though the student riots)...wasn't 'Laugh In the most outrageous programmme on the TV that year...only mentioned because Richard Nixon appeared briefly on it. There was a draw for the first time for Best Actress at the Oscars...not covered. The Graduate....Here to you Mrs Robinson....music was only mentioned it it was related to the protest Brokaw was covering..The novel Myra Breckinridge was published..there are so many other areas that could have rounded out this documentary. Limited only to the American experience it does not cover  the rioting in France or the Czech revolt.

For starters, his half-hearted attempt to connect 1968 to the present is both incomplete and misdirected (including John Stewart in a documentary about 1968?!).  Secondly, he repeatedly mentions the so-called ""silent majority"" of conservative upset with the turmoil, yet fails to give them a voice.  Pat Buchanon is one of the few conservatives featured.  Lastly, I was also distracted by the inclusion of some his own personal memories, particularly the story about his friend that was killed in Vietnam.

Some may ask why is Jon Stewart in a documentary on 1968? Conversely anyone familiar with Kurtz's work on the subject will know precisely why he is included. The late-1960s counter-culture direction was a 'great awakening' functionalist quasi-religious development. Brokaw makes a dismal attempt at objectivity in this documentary acutely because he is an apologist for this distinct functionalist quasi-religion. For a more objective look at the counter-culture direction of the late 1960s I would suggest viewing the Firing Line episode entitled 'The Hippies,' or to read the work Stanley Kurtz has done on the subject in the book, Never a Matter of Indifference: Sustaining Virtue in a Free Republic.

I remember classmates being really concerned about their boyfriends having to go to Vietnam when the TET offensive occurred in January 1968. I remember racial demonstrations and riots after MLK was assassinated. There was a curfew on our city and our graduation had to be moved to the afternoon. The very next week RFK was assassinated and during his funeral, the radio interrupted that they had caught the ""presumed killer"" of MLK. That summer there were demonstrations at the political convention. That was a very tragic time for our country. I wanted to add this DVD to my collection.",1483228800,,626,4.805555555555555

8235309,4,B000ZDQI44,"The History Channel program ""1968 with Tom Brokaw"" is a very good look back on one of the most important years in the entire history of the United States. For those of us, like myself, who was alive at that time this will be a nostalgic look back on that moment in history. I was 12 in '68 so was old enough to be aware what was going on both in the country and the world and watched everything on the nightly news as it was unfolding. As a result I remembered as I watched this video the sadness I felt as I heard the news of the assassinations of Dr. King and Bobby. How shocked I was at the Tet offensive happening even after all those times we were told the U.S. was winning the war in Vietnam and then even more shocked when I watched President Johnson a couple of months later address the nation saying how he would not seek re-election. Of course I remember too seeing the protests of that time between the anti-war movement to the civil rights marches and even the growth of the women's lib protests. And then if that wasn't enough unrest going on in the country there was the Democratic convention in Chicago that year as not just myself but the whole world watched what would start out on the streets outside the convention hall and end up coming into the convention. The documentary does end on a high note thought as it looks back on Christmas Eve as Apollo 8 orbited around the Earths Moon sending back pictures of the Earth rising above the Moon horizon. I remember the awe I felt as the world got to see close up what the surface of the Moon looked like. Yeah it looked grey and lifeless but it was still was a sight to behold.

This History Channel documentary is a very well made film that just covers the surface of the important events that happened that year. There are more to the stories than what Tom Brokaw talks about but given they only had approximately an hour and a half to cover everything for that year, and when you factor all those events that would take place in 1968, they do a good job considering. Anyone my age or older will be happy I think with what was covered even if you wish they had done more on these events. For those who were too young to remember all this or not even born yet this will make for interesting viewing in getting an idea of what the times were like in 1968 and why that year was the year that changed everything whether political, cultural, musically or psychologically. My advice to those who were too young or not born yet who watch this use this video as a starting point to delve deeper into the history of that year and understand more the meaning of what was taking place in the world.

Production wise this video is well put together. I don't know if it is the case but many of the news footage that is shown throughout the program looks like it may have been re-mastered giving some of the video a clearer look to them. Also interesting throughout the show is along with Tom Brokaw talking about what he experienced during that year is interviews with other well known individuals who were part of the action. Included among them are Pat Buchanan, who provides the conservative viewpoint of these events, Arlo Guthrie, Andrew Young, Rafer Johnson, Tommy Smothers and Bruce Springsteen who was 18 in 1968 and how as a young man the events from that year affected him.

Yes the reporting here is a bit incomplete and while a lot was covered during this program there was a lot left out but this is a DVD worth still watching and using to reflect back on. I have mentioned in the past in writing reviews on videos dealing with historical subject matter that I am a bit of a history nerd. Speaking from that standpoint while not the best out there this is still an excellent compellation of news events that would unfold in the year 1968 that everyone should see at least once if not add to their video library.",1435190400,,3878,4.360995850622406

In ""1968 With Tom Brokaw,"" he applies this formula to this ""pivotal"" year, contending that, ""The people who lived through that time have stories to tell that help us understand the country we are today.""  ""1968"" alludes briefly to sports, music, and films, but its emphasis is primarily on military, social, and political developments, taken more or less in chronological order:  The Tet offensive, the hippie movement, race relations, women's liberation, the McCarthy and Kennedy primary campaigns, the political conventions, the Humphrey-Nixon campaign, and a hopeful account of Apollo 8's trip to the moon.

""1968"" draws on contemporary newsreels, Brokaw's personal recollections, and the contributions of a large group of commentators.  The original images from 1968 are the strongest part of this documentary.  For older viewers, they will bring back memories; for younger viewers, they will convey an idea of what went on in this troubled year.  Brokaw's personal experiences are less compelling than those of his commentators, among whom are such political operatives as Sam Brown, Pat Buchanan, Jeff Greenfield, and Rafer Johnson; and activists Mark Rudd, Cleveland Sellers, and Andrew Young.  For some reason, Brokaw seems to think that musicians have special insights on this year--among the commentators are Arlo Guthrie, Michelle Phillips, Bruce Springsteen, and James Taylor.  But, apart from historian Alan Brinkley, the commentators do not include any serious scholars--the historians, political scientists, sociologists, and psychologists who could have shed meaningful light on 1968.

Some reviewers have charged that Brokaw is attempting to promote a ""liberal"" agenda.  In fact, on most issues he attempts to take a middle position.  For opinions about the Vietnam War, he interviews a draft evader and a Vietnam veteran; he discusses the demonstrations at the Democratic convention in Chicago with a demonstrator and a Chicago policeman.  He mentions that he visited Haight-Ashbury in its heyday as the symbolic crossroads of the ""drug culture,"" but explains that he did so wearing a suit and tie.  After a friend was killed in Vietnam, Brokaw wanted to curse ""this damned war""; but the friend's family's ""mixed feelings of pride and bewilderment"" moderated Brokaw's emotions.  And, when covering the McCarthy-Kennedy primary contest in California, Brokaw tells us that he had friends in both campaigns.  If Brokaw had been making a ""liberal"" assessment of 1968, he would not have included the views of a Chicago policeman; and he would have included coverage of the My Lai massacre and Richard Nixon's surreptitious undermining of the Johnson administration's peace talks.  And the commentators would have included Bill Moyers rather than Dorothy Rabinowitz, at least one leftist historian, and a civil rights leader more militant than Andrew Young.  No, this is not a piece of left-wing propaganda.  If Brokaw can be criticized for anything, it is not for taking a ""liberal"" position, but for his reluctance to take any position.  But his objective was not to promote any agenda, but to bring all sides together.

Paradoxically, reliance on motion picture evidence can either strengthen or weaken a documentary.  Demonstrations and riots provide compelling images.  But (at least in 1968) most history took place off camera.  Those demonstrating or rioting were always a minority.  There was more to the anti-war movement than student demonstrations, more to African American aspirations than Stokely Carmichael shouting, ""Black Power,"" and more to women's liberation than a few protestors tossing high heeled shoes and brassieres into Atlantic City trash cans.  But, in general, ""1968"" does not go much deeper than the pictorial evidence.

And one gets the feeling that reliance on newsreel footage not only influenced what stories ""1968"" covers, but also impacted how the commentators' remarks are presented.  To the extent that their statements were elicited by Brokaw's leading questions, or edited to address issues raised by newsreels, what we hear in this documentary may not adequately reflect their views.  For example, ""1968"" presents Rabinowitz's opinion that the anti-Miss America feminist demonstrators ""make fools of what should have been a sober and serious enterprise.""  These comments suggest that she has different thoughts about the ""sober and serious"" women's movement; but we are not told what those thoughts are.  Similarly, her conclusion that the young people of 1968 were ""an incredibly spoiled, self indulgent generation"" seems to be in response to films of demonstrators and hippies, although most young people were neither demonstrators nor hippies.

Pat Buchanan appears among the commentators as a representative of Nixon's campaign. But, ""1968"" does not present his thoughts on Nixon; instead we hear Buchanan gloating about the Democrats' discomfiture after the demonstrations at the Chicago convention.  Brokaw's own remarks also seem to blame the Democrats' problems on these demonstrations.  In fact, because of Vietnam, the Democrats were in trouble well before the convention.  After all, Johnson had already chosen to drop out of the presidential race.  And, although Buchanan and Brokaw imply that anti-war  demonstrations drove a conservative pro-war backlash, opposition to the war continued after the convention--and was greater among older Americans than among younger ones.  In 1968, Secretary of Defense Clark Clifford concluded that the war in Vietnam was a ""loser.""  Henry Kissinger later wrote that the cost of the war ""was out of proportion to any conceivable gain.""  All the major 1968 presidential candidates at least paid lip service to ending the war.

""1968"" does not present any alternative to Buchanan's view that student demonstrations drove conservative Democrats into the Republican party.  Perhaps more to the point is the comment Lyndon Johnson made after signing the Civil Rights bill into law:  ""I think we just delivered the South to the Republican party for a long time to come.""  Buchanan notes that the Republicans won five of the next six presidential elections (1968-1988).  Of course, the Democrats won the popular vote in six of the following seven elections (1992-2016).  What do these election results actually tell us?  ""1968"" notes the changing political landscape, but does not adequately discuss what caused the changes.

Another ""1968"" commentator, historian Alan Brinkley, concluded that Americans (in 2008, when ""1968"" was being produced) were ""much more conservative"" than they were in 1968.  But with what confidence can we make such a generalization?  The ""center"" of the political spectrum has moved.  Many things once considered out of the mainstream are now accepted, for example, suffrage for women and African-Americans, the income tax, Social Security, and Medicare.  Thus, today's ""moderate"" accepts policies that were formerly thought beyond the pale.  Does the current quiescence reflect a moderation of public opinion?  Can we assume that there would be no demonstrations if black Americans were again denied the vote and relegated to the back of the bus, and if 15,000 draftees were dying each year in a Middle Eastern war?  In the years since Brinkley was interviewed for ""1968,"" some states have legalized marijuana for medicinal (and even recreational) use; several jurisdictions have recognized same-sex marriage; and the country has elected, and re-elected, an African-American president.  Moreover, a recent Pew survey of 18-to-29-year-old Americans found that 49% of them had a favorable view of socialism, while only 43 % had a negative view of it.  Are these developments, which scarcely seemed possible in 1968, consistent with a ""much more conservative"" political outlook?

Similarly, Brinkley implies that ""excesses on the left"" made the country more conservative.  Brokaw seems to endorse this conclusion with his comment that campus radicals ""simply infuriated many Americans.""  Of course, there have also been excesses on the right--Little Rock, Anniston, Montgomery, the University of Mississippi, Birmingham, and Selma, to mention a few that come readily to mind.  Did the left's 1960s excesses have a greater impact on the political landscape than those of the right?  If so, why were Americans less concerned about right-wing excesses?  (Incidentally, having implicitly blamed campus radicals for the ""culture wars"" that have divided America, Brokaw goes on to say, ""still the Counter Culture was rapidly becoming the popular culture.""  Another example of his balancing act.)

The foregoing remarks do not necessarily reflect a disagreement with Professor Brinkley.  They are simply a plea for a more nuanced assessment of these issues (which Brinkley may well have provided in comments excluded from this documentary).  If the conventional wisdom is correct that America's political outlook was liberal in the Progressive Era, conservative in the 1920s, liberal in the 1930s, conservative in the 1950s, liberal in the 1960s, then conservative again in the 1980s, etc., the historian's role is to explain what accounts for these alterations in philosophy.

Buchanan characterizes 1968 as perhaps the worst, most divisive, year in American history.  He believed the 1960s marked the beginning of the ""cultural war"" that has subsequently divided the country, ""and which I think we will never overcome, because our disagreements are so deep and profound.""  Of course, 1968 was not our most divisive year (think of 1861).  And America throughout its history has been divided along various lines--Native Americans vs. colonists, free states vs. slave states, Protestant vs. Catholic, native vs. immigrant, and black vs. white--and these divisions have occasionally produced violent reactions.  It does not seem that divisions in the last three decades of the 20th century were more significant than previous ones.  Buchanan's remarks, like those of several other commentators, imply that the moving images on the screen were the whole story.  Brokaw's editing of their remarks may have exacerbated this tendency, which is the main weakness of ""1968.""  On the other hand, it must be said that Rafer Johnson and some other commentators make very significant contributions to this program.

The strength of ""1968"" lies in the newsreel footage itself.  Many, perhaps most, Americans got their news from television coverage.  Their conception of reality came from what they witnessed on the evening news.  The same images could inspire vastly different reactions in different viewers--but these were the images they saw.  ""1968"" is a little weak on interpretation; but it supplies the raw material for a study of how Americans understood their country.",1379462400,3,11578,5.68158047646717

Mr. Brokow describes the events of the year beginning with the assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr. and Bobby Kennedy.  The chaotic Democratic National Convention in Chicago which really was a clash of generations.  NASA sending men into outer space, the great concert of WoodStock, the Olympics in Mexico City with the famous ""Black Power"" protest, the burning of bras by women, the drug influence from marijuana to LSD...Timothy Leary, The Smothers Brothers controversial Television show...The crazy and historic events go on....There are good commentaries and interviews with those who were influenced by 1968 such as Arlo Guthrie, Olympic Athlete Rafer Johnson, Tommy Smothers (of the Smothers Brothers), political commentarian and commedian Jon Stewart, and Former Mayor of Atlanta Andrew Young who was in Dr. King's inner circle, and the great rock singer and poet in song Bruce Springsteen.
1968 was the year that President Lyndon B. Johnson decided not to run for re-election, he knew America's mood about the War in Vietnam, he knew that he physically could not go on the re-election campaign, and he knew that another 4 years in the White House would literally kill him.  In 1968 he faces his demons and did the right thing by announcing that he would not run for re-election.  Then came the 37th President of The United States Richard M. Nixon who brought in a more ""conservative"" attitude to the White House and 5 years later he too faced his demons and resigned from the Presidency.  This is a good DVD about that pivotal year that either hurt or helped America forever (according to your political beliefs and who you listen to)...I recommend this for all who want to know what the 1960's were really like...the Good...the Bad...and The Ugly of the 1960's...Highly Recommended!",1376352000,,1932,5.059748427672956
