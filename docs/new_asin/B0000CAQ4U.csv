7998530,5,B0000CAQ4U,As described. Good seller. DVD would not play even with VLC or ripped and mounted. Kinda old tech here. But I ripped the videos from the disc and can play them individually but its a pain in the derrire.,1517097600,,203,4.230769230769231
7998531,5,B0000CAQ4U,"One again, the value of getting videos from a number of different instructors has been proven to me.

I had been struggling with getting a clean sounding open A chord - most instructional texts and videos that discuss this chord will instruct you to form it with 3 fingers, and with this cramped position, I was almost always getting a muffed note.

Early in this video, Jorma instructs you to form the open A chord by barring strings 3 & 4 with your middle finger, and fretting the 2nd string with your 4th finger - TA-DA!  Perfect open A chord every time!

Jorma says he does it this way because that's the way he's always done it, and the added bonus is that you can easily switch from an open A major to A diminished by slightly changing the position of your middle finger.

Now this may not sound like much, and for some of you more clever people this may have seemed obvious, but to me, little nuggets of advice like that are worth the cost of the video. Seriously.

This video teaches some songs I haven't heard before, and when Jorma performs them, he frequently has accompaniment - the performances themselves are entertaining as well as educational.

As I said, to me it pays off to get videos from a few different instructors for the same style of playing because the repertoire of songs are different, and you can incorporate the different techniques into a playing style that's best for you.",1449705600,4,1404,4.525691699604743

7998533,5,B0000CAQ4U,"Jorma's approach to teaching fingerstyle guitar is far and away the most effective I've encountered. For starters, he treats you to a spellbinding performance, after which he analyzes the piece and breaks it down into manageable challenges. You will come away from this DVD with some very fun, satisfyingly challenging pieces that you will have added to your repitoire. Who knew back in the mid 70's, when this awe-struck stoner listened to ""Genesis"", that I'd be playing a very credible facsimile of the piece 30 years later. Jorma is like that favorite teacher you had in school, the unforgettable one who inspired you to higher levels of accomplishment.",1173312000,14,656,5.083333333333333
7998534,5,B0000CAQ4U,"I found this dvd and tab to be excellent.  Jorma is very clear in his teaching and his playing fits the tab very well.  Only my limited talent is holding me back from mastering the material presented.  As for the individual who rated it one star, well, the pickers he mentioned are definitely masters, but that's no reason to pan Jorma's dvd.  Go figure.  I highly recommend this dvd to fingerpickers, especially people just getting into it.",1108598400,11,441,4.675324675324675
7998535,5,B0000CAQ4U,"I hesitated to spend the money on this DVD but I've had lots of fun with it, and it has certainly paid for itself many times over.  As someone who is an ""advanced beginner"" without much natural talent, I had reached a plateau after many guitar lessons.  I find this DVD far preferable to taking lessons because of the simple fact that segments of interest can be endlessly studied.  The songs are over my head, but with many repetitions I am beginning to get them.  Equally importantly, I am learning some of the more subtle points such as how to use vibrato, arpeggio, and dynamic range (varying volume) to make the music sound more nuanced and meaningful.  Jorma breaks down the songs into digestible little segments and demonstrates them with an incredibly clean style, all the while throwing in lots of nuggets about technique.  A plus for me is being able to learn his beautiful song ""Genesis"" which I have loved for years.  Jorma -- if you happen to read this -- MANY THANKS!!",1105574400,28,982,4.609195402298851
7998536,5,B0000CAQ4U,"For those wishing to improve on their picking style and learn the unique riffs of a master--this is for you.
Ignore the whiney quibblings of reviewer Bob Tolstoy below--I checked his review history and he put the same thing on any item that was related to Jorma Kaukonen. Sounds like someone has a personal vendetta.",1089072000,18,316,4.763636363636364
7998537,5,B0000CAQ4U,"This is absolutely the coolest DVD AND the best guitar instruction approach that I have tried, and I have tried a number of them. Jorma [and one of his buddies] play the song, then Jorma goes through step by step and show you how to play the tune. Thanks to DVD technology, you can easily backtrack at tough parts or stop and return later after your fingers recover. Thanks to Jorma, a rich tradition in guitar blues survives today with a significant following. I would not recommend this for beginners, but any 40-somethings or 50-somethings will be glad to know how to play these songs. [The guy who wrote the review below is total sour grapes with a vendetta.]",1088640000,24,663,4.579831932773109
