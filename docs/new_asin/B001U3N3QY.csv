3795940,5,B001U3N3QY,"I received a review copy of Tom and Jerry: The Chuck Jones Collection last week and sat down to watch it with my wife.  We're both in our 20s and we are big animation fans, but we were both surprised how much these cartoons had us rolling in laughter.  The shorts all have Chuck Jones' signature subtle animation style mixed with crazy gags.

Overall, this set is extremely entertaining, and the shorts look great in widescreen.  I only wish that they would start releasing these kinds of sets on Blu-ray, but I'm sure that day isn't too far away.",1244419200,6,547,4.494949494949495
3795941,2,B001U3N3QY,"Don't get me wrong, it's nice of Warner's to make these cartoons available, and I'm glad they didn't waste space on the classic sets with these cartoons. But that doesn't change the fact that these are largely inferior to the Hanna-Barbera theatrical Tom & Jerry cartoons.

Even though Chuck Jones was a genius in working with the Road Runner & Wile E. Coyote, Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck and others, for some reason he is completely out of his element here. The animation is lovely as always, but the timing and pacing are all off, the drawing is too cutesy, and the violence (what there is of it) just doesn't play right as a result.

This is a worthwhile set for animation historians and Tom and Jerry completists. For those just wanting to have a good laugh with their families, stick to the original H-B theatricals.",1243296000,15,816,4.620689655172414
3795942,4,B001U3N3QY,"By ""not the classic Tom and Jerry"" cartoons of the 1940s and 50, it's safe to say that this collection is not characterized by the impeccably rendered--or nauseatingly realistic--welts and bruises suffered by the famous cat-and-mouse duo in largely violence-themed storylines. These shorts were the most lavish, most fully animated theatrical cartoons of the 1960s. It is curious, however, that with the large budgets and Chuck Jones' genius on tap, these cartoons are not better. (Jones himself likened his version of Tom and Jerry to his Road Runner series, which really does not do them justice. Tom is less self-destructive than Wile E. Coyote, and Jerry less smugly complacent. There is also more subtle psychodrama at work here--or less subtle, as in the case of ""Jerry, Jerry Quite Contrary."") Presumably, there was only so much you could do with a nonspeaking cat chasing a nonspeaking mouse--voice veterans Mel Blanc and June Foray were on hand to supply whatever grunts, groans, and giggles were required--after 20 years and seven Oscars. But it's rather incredible what Jones and his crew (most of whom were part of his Warner Bros. team) did find to do with the characters.

If you love ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas,"" you'll enjoy the artistic similarities: Tom, when angered, often resembles the Grinch, while some of Jerry's facial expressions call to mind Max or Cindy Lou-Who. (Two of the later cartoons, however, are ""cheaters,"" compilations of scenes from the ""classic"" Tom and Jerry era, with new footage animated by the original animators trying to match the earlier design.) Altogether a flawed but fascinating effort, and a welcome addition to any animation collection.

Personal favorite: ""Snowbody Loves Me.""",1242604800,10,1735,5.21505376344086

3795997,1,B001U3N3QY,"First... These are some of my favorite cartoons of all time. Chuck Jones is one of the best ever. No question about that at all.

The problem with this DVD collection is in the formatting. The description reads ""Widescreen Version presented in a ""matted"" widescreen format preserving the aspect ratio of their original theatrical exhibitions..."", which is only true while the credits are on screen. As soon as the credits finish, the pillar boxes (black bars) disappear, and then picture zooms in for the rest of the cartoon.

The cartoons are originally made in a ratio close to modern widescreen television so it works out well a lot of the time. BUT a lot of the time it doesn't work. The zoomed in presentation cuts off a lot of the artwork, characters are poorly framed or often out of frame and the zoom effect leaves the viewer feeling claustrophobic, or like you are sitting way too close to the screen.

The only reason that I would rate this collection at 1 star is because the box says that they are ""preserved the aspect ratio of their original theatrical exhibitions"" which isn't true.",1493164800,7,1098,4.708333333333333

The only complaint I have about this set is that the shorts were originally animated in 1.33:1, but are presented on this set in cropped 1.78:1 for widescreen TVs as shown in theaters. This doesn't really detract from being able to enjoy the cartoons for the most part, but the cartoons can look a bit cramped at times. To be honest, I wish they would've kept the shorts in full screen like they did on the recent Gene Deitch set and on the individual shorts released on other T&J compilations. However, it's still a nice set and definitely suffices. Highly recommended for collectors and completists.",1458518400,2,741,4.796875

3796090,4,B001U3N3QY,"These are the Chuck Jones Tom n Jerry shorts (the product listing tells ya).  It's classic (almost) Tom & Jerry. I'm not going to talk about the show in general here, or what episodes are included.  Others have reviews on that.  I'm going to review the style of these compared to the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tom-and-Jerry-Spotlight-Collection-Vol-1-3-3-Pack/dp/B000R7GKPU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tom and Jerry Spotlight Collection: Vol. 1-3 (3-Pack)</a>.

The Chuck Jones era TnJ came after the Hanna Barbera/Fred Quimby/Tex Avery 40-50s stuff and I've got to say, while this set is entertaining, it does not have the charm and nostalgia that I associate with Tom and Jerry.  I'll admit I'm an old soul and a sucker for the big band soundtracks and the era of the Spotlight Collections.  Chuck Jones' style is more off the wall - a little weird sometimes like he's trying to make a statement about society. However, this TnJ has several great episodes, which is the reason I bought it. The settings and episode premises (Secret Agent, Sci Fi...) are products of their time (Cold War era), and quite entertaining.

VERDICT:
If you want ALL the Tom & Jerry you grew up with (80s, 90s kids), you've got to buy this.  I wouldn't have given it 4 stars if it wasn't entertaining.  But I prefer the style and cohesiveness of the Spotlight Collections better. If you want those catchy songs and classic Disney-level production quality, go with the Spotlight Collections.",1424304000,,1516,5.336134453781512

I like the hair styles on Tom and Jerry, and there are some moments when you laugh out loud. While it is not racist as the older Tom and Jerry, it is still quite violent, and they get into some pretty funny scenes. Since this was made in the 60's, the picture is much clearer than the animation of the 50's. Spike, Jerry's cousins, and Tom's old cat pals even make appearances.

Chuck Jones, while a master at his craft, didn't do Tom and Jerry the justice they deserved after Hanna-Barbera handed the reins. Truly, the latter were the fathers of the duo. My favorite Tom and Jerry episodes come from their later years.

Chuck Jones did the best he could, and I still enjoyed the 'toons with my sister.",1410739200,,600,4.445454545454545

3796137,5,B001U3N3QY,"If you're a true Tom & Jerry fan, you've gotta get this DVD. Chuck jones direction and graphics are superb and might even bring a tear to your nostalgic eye.....this was probably the last theatrical cartoon series that was animated and gloriously hand inked (not the scratchy Xerox method) before full animation was phased out until Walt Disneys The Little Mermaid.
  Hanna/ Barberas and Chuck Jones takes are apparent and fun to compare/ watch. While HB had a gifted animation staff and the incomparible musical talents of Scott Bradley, Chuck also had an equally gifted team of animators and the astonishing, & very rarely mentioned musical supervision of Dean Elliot. Listen to his catchy electro jazz T&J scores on ""Jerry Jerry Quite Contrary"", ""Surfboard Cat"" , ""Matinee Mouse"",  ""Advance & Be Mechanized"" and probably his best score, the crunchy jazzy groove for ""Cannery Rodent"". While Scott Bradley made lush memorable scores with a full string orchestra, Elliot astounds with no strings BUT plenty of bright, punchy brass and woodwinds, complimented by taut electric (Fender?) bass and percussion. Very addicting and catchy intros and endings. In fact, you will find yourself repeating and playing certain parts over & over again, just because it sounds SO GOOD!
  What you will find is that while both HB & Chuck Jones versions are hilarious, Tom & Jerry were never side splitingly funny compared to the old Warner Brothers shorts. BUT what they do have is a mesmerizing story/ animation/ pacing / musical quality that is fascinating to watch and keeps you glued to your seat.
  My one complaint: MGM should have kept producing more Tom & Jerrys with Chuck at the helm. This series could have easily survived to maybe another 70 - 100 total episodes. When you finish watching the last one one ""Purrchance to Dream"" you feel a slight sadness to know that there will be no more. Ever.",1386547200,2,1892,4.9495268138801265

3796180,5,B001U3N3QY,"Everyone has something to say, but what old Tom and Jerry fans want to hear is below based on some statements I've heard regarding the old vs new Tom and Jerry:

1) ""Chuck Jones Collection doesn't feel like Tom and Jerry""-- Well, the first 100+ episodes of Tom and Jerry were started about 30 years prior, so yes, it's bound to ""feel"" different.
2) ""Chuck Jones Collection is less funny""-- Actually, the original Tom and Jerry was funny because it was so violent (among other elements). The Chuck Jones Collection of Tom and Jerry simply adhered to more recent standards of children's programming, which meant no racism, prejudice, or violence. With this in mind, 30 years is a very long time!! It's amazing that Tom and Jerry and the Chuck Jones Collection were even remotely similar.
3) ""Chuck Jones Collection is stupid""-- No, it's just silly. Comparing the original Tom and Jerry to the Chuck Jones Collection would be like comparing Looney Tunes to Tiny Toon Adventures or the original Alice in Chains to the new after Layne Staley died....three decades is just so long that they practically could be considered apples to oranges. Both are awesome cartoons, but think of it this way, Tom and Jerry started in 1940 and ended officially ended in 1957, and the Chuck Jones Collection wasn't picked up until 1970s...even if 30 years was not that long, the cultural values and differences between the 40s and 70s are so dissimilar that America in the 40s and America in the 70s were two totally different cultures...it's amazing that either of the Tom and Jerry's were even remotely alike.

All that being said, the Chuck Jones Collection is amazing, but not terribly similar to Tom and Jerry. I am a fan of the original by absolute landslide, however, if you go to buy this then be prepared for sillyness rather than prejudice, slapstick rather than dynamite. They changed the Chuck Jones Collection enough that it looks like Tom and Jerry but feels different, the thing is, the difference can be appreciated, and for $15 I'd hardly worry about it not being worth the money. Perhaps if the Chuck Jones Collection was more expensive my overall review would be harsher.",1355875200,3,2168,4.809651474530831

Master animator Chuck Jones has done a great job in directing and drawing thse cartoons and they make them worth watching countless times.

3796208,5,B001U3N3QY,"...........well, sort of!  Tom & Jerry enjoyed years of success under the tenure of Hanna-Barbera at MGM, followed by a short and bland streak with Gene Deitch.  In 1963/64 Chuck Jones, who had directed the Looney Tunes/Merrie Melodies at WB for years, was brought over to MGM to take over T&J.  The designs of both the main characters were revamped in the familiar and lovable Chuck Jones style.  The T&J cartoons would also take on a more psychedelic, space-age look, characteristic of the period.  Many will agree that the Chuck Jones films were not on par with their Hanna-Barbera predecessors, but are superior to the Gene Deitch ones.  I had been anticipating these shorts on DVD for quite some time, since I generally prefer the Chuck Jones cartoons to the H-B's.  Glad to have them on DVD finally.

I wonder if at some point, as part of the new Tom & Jerry DVD series that WB is preparing (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tom-Jerry-Golden-Collection-Volume-One/dp/B0058O1FIY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tom & Jerry Golden Collection: Volume One</a>), that the complete Deitch cartoons will see the light of day?

3796212,5,B001U3N3QY,"This is a set of the most criminally underrated and unappreciated animation out there, in my opinion. The director whose name is on the cover of this set alongside Tom and Jerry doesn't even think highly of these cartoons. His opinions had to do with personal issues of his own though, and while I definitely respect the opinion of the man who resurrected Tom and Jerry in 1963, I cannot say that his opinion alone does these cartoons justice. I'm not alone when I say that. The cartoons have their own DVD set! Anyway, Chuck Jones compared these cartoons to some of his other cartoons at Warner Brothers, which happen to be the best cartoons ever made, to many people. He just didn't think they were that good. He also babied Warner Brothers a little bit as he got older and looked back at his career. He did work at MGM but the Warner Brothers studio was his home and his face was Warner Brother's goodwill ambassador in way until his death.

Now as for the cartoons, the moving pictures, the cat and the mouse, they were classic Chuck Jones cartoons in my opinion, and they beat every Roadruner/Coyote cartoon out there (Chuck also said that he felt these cartoons ripped off the Roadrunner and Coyote). They are very funny cartoons. There are creative gags, such as the bulldog's hilarious movement in ""The Cat's Me-Ouch"" and ""Purr-Chance to Dream."" The bulldog in this character is also extremely odd, yet he is absolutely adorable, and of course funny! Nothing much that Chuck Jones did was ever really ""normal,"" but that was gift he had, not a handicap. There are also some pretty straight forward cartoonish gags in many cartoons with enough violence and loud noises for our fix of that. There are gags that are just plain silly, such as the duo being involved in a chase in ""Ah, Sweet Mouse Story of Life,"" where they don't run after each other but dance after each other :P

Then there are details and moments that exemplify Chuck Jone's work...the creepiness, the spookiness and sophistication of it all. ""Haunted Mouse"" is straight out of the twilight zone. The stare down with ""evil"" Tom laughing maniacally (more scary than the Grinch who Jones directed), until he is frightened by ""magic"" Jerry  because he is suddenly unphased by Tom is Chuck Jones perfection. This cartoon is right up there with his most respected work at Warner Brothers and Dr Seuss. It might be my favorite Chuck Jones Tom and Jerry cartoon but it also might not even be! I don't *think* I've seen them all and if I have, I definitely don't have all of the titles organized in my head.

Arranging all of these cartoons in your head is impossible to me. I could probably recall 34 normal cartoons but not these. They all feel like movies. They open with MGM's Lions roar, have fantastic animated musical intros, and fade in to the real cartoon, much like a movie would with it's story. They are absolutely epic. The animation is beautiful. Even the rough critic of the Chuck Jones Tom and Jerry cartoons will tell you that the 2 never looked better. They had much more defined figures and their faces look elegant, yet they didn't lose their cartoon nature. They didn't even ""lose"" to the editors, who hacked previous Tom and Jerry sets to pieces. All of these cartoons are presented in their original format. Do yourself a favor and DO NOT listen to ANYONE who trashes this set!

3796226,4,B001U3N3QY,"Even Chuck Jones admits that he can not fully fill the shoes of the characters creators, but he can put his own spin on them.  The trouble is that Chuck quickly became bored with the project & left his crew to complete the contract.

The question here is which screen format is the correct way to view these films?  For over 40 years I have only seen these cartoons in the full frame format.  All 16mm film prints, TV broadcasts, Videotapes & Laserdiscs have presented these cartoons in 1:33-1 Full Frame aspect ratio.  Now we are getting DVDs formatted for the 16x9 widescreen TV sets.  So I pulled out my old Laserdiscs to compare the images.

Comparing the 16x9 widescreen image to the old 1;33-1 full frame image.
SHARPNESS:  This new transfer is far more sharper than the old Laserdisc & Videotapes.
COLOR:  This new transfer has brighter, purer colors than the old Laserdisc & Videotapes.
SIDE FRAMING: Both the left & right sides of the new transfer contain more picture than the older Laserdisc & Videotapes.
TOP FRAMING:  This new transfer CROPS OFF a significant portion of the picture.  Mostly not a problem, but I caught one shot of Jerry looking down at his belly & his eyes were cut off on the 16x9 presentation, they are there on the 1:33-1 full frame presentation.
BOTTOM FRAMING:  This new transfer crops a little off of the bottom, but this is insignificant.

So the best presentation would have been a window-boxed 1:66-1 framing to give us the full animated picture.  It is too bad that the old Laserdiscs did not do this as they were not worried about filling the screen of 16x9 widescreen TVs.

Either format cuts off some picture, so i would say that if you have a 16x9 widescreen TV, you will prefer this 16x9 top-cropped transfer.  If you have an older square screen TV you will prefer the old 1;33-1 side cropped transfer.  Chuck seemed to design these for television broadcast, so the 16x9 image can look tight at times.

It is questionable as to how these were shown at the theaters.  The theaters in my home town area were old & had square screens until the late 1960's.  So I probably saw these on a 1:66-1 screen as a kid, not 16x9 as presented here.",1247184000,10,2181,4.557840616966581
3796227,5,B001U3N3QY,"Tom and Jerry: The Chuck Jones Collection

(Released June 23, 2009 by Warner Home Video)
Another Long DVD Review by Joe Torcivia

It must have been one heck of a surprise for the theatrical audiences of late 1963 to see the familiar MGM Roaring Lion signal the beginning of the upcoming cartoon - and have the head of TOM fade into its place and go ""MEOW!  MEOW!  FST! FST!"".  ...I know it was for me when I first saw it on television!

But, with this revamped opening, famed animation director Chuck Jones began putting his stamp on Bill Hanna and Joe Barbera's cat and mouse team of TOM AND JERRY.

Chuck's unique vision and design sense would guide Bill and Joe's creations for little more than three years and 34 cartoons, and it is those cartoons that make up Warner Home Video's release Tom and Jerry: The Chuck Jones Collection.

We'll break the review into CONS and PROS.

The CONS:

Content Notes:  Once again a WHV set has NO CONTENT LISTING anywhere inside the package! One disc is on a ""hinged holder"" and the other disc rests on the inside back wall of the packaging! But, beyond that, there is no list of titles for the cartoons and, while they follow the order of original theatrical release, this isn't something that even most hardcore animation fans have committed to memory, much less mere civilians. Ditto on listings for the extra features.

This is at least the THIRD Warner Animation set I've purchased this year with no content notes!  The others being Max Fleischer's Superman and Saturday Morning Cartoons 1960s Volume 1.  Doubtless, there are others indicating an unfortunate trend in Warner's DVD packaging for animation sets.

Talent: It's not Bill Hanna, Joe Barbera, and original composer Scott Bradley.  Let everything that follows in this review lie within the context that these three talented individuals are who put Tom and Jerry on the pop culture map to stay!

The Set Itself:  A minor ""con"", but the fact that it IS ""The Chuck Jones Collection"", coming on the heels of three volumes of the original Hanna-Barbera shorts, means that there will probably be no DVD release of the 13 Gene Deitch T&J shorts of 1960-1962.

I was actually hoping for a ""Tom and Jerry in the Sixties"" set that would encompass the runs of both Deitch AND Jones... but, clearly, Jones is the more marketable name and he gets the call - and we may never be treated to the ""otherworldly wonders"" of Mr. Deitch.

The PROS:

Talent: It's Chuck Jones - and, by this time in the 1960s, there were few, if any, talents to truly rival Jones - and he's brought a few old friends with him...

Writer Michael Maltese, co-director and designer Maurice Noble, voice actors Mel Blanc and June Foray (...with Blanc doing the ""yelling in pain"" as Tom.  I guess they couldn't use Bill Hanna's classic ""AAAAAAHHH!"" anymore!), and composer Eugene Poddany.

Put them all together and they made 34 entertaining cartoons that looked better than the any of the competing product of the day.

Style:  During this period, Tom and Jerry were ""Jones-ified"".  There's probably no better way to put it.  Jerry became ""cuter"" than ever before, and Tom took on the ""villainous"" physical characteristics of Jones' Daffy Duck and especially Wyle E. Coyote.  The animation was lush for the time, and Jones' trademark character posing abounds.

The Extra Features:  ""Tom and Jerry and Chuck"" is a 20 minute feature on the coming together of this unlikely trio, and is narrated by June Foray.  Many parallels are drawn to Jones' prior Warner Bros. work - in both characters and plots of specific cartoons.  It is also shown where Jones put his own spin on T&J plots previously produced by Hanna and Barbera.  The feature is punctuated by frequent clips of Chuck Jones, in his later years, speaking on the subject.

In its 25 minutes, ""Chuck Jones: Memories of a Childhood"" covers what is found in the first three chapters of Mr. Jones' 1989 book, ""Chuck Amuck"", in his own words and pictures.  This 2008 documentary featurette was produced for Turner Classic Movies and, while very informative, does not mention Tom and Jerry at any time. Give it points if you're a Jones fan.  Take away points if you're a Tom and Jerry fan.  You decide!

Print Quality:  To my eyes, and on my equipment, the prints are nearly flawless for average age 45-year-old cartoons.  Far better than the print quality on the aforementioned Max Fleischer's Superman and Saturday Morning Cartoons 1960s Volume 1.

Menus:  For reasons unknown, Warner's DVD animation set main menus often have unusually LOUD background music or ""series themes"" that play while the menu is displayed.  So loud that I'll either MUTE while lingering on the menu - or navigate off the menu as quickly as possible.  Tom and Jerry: The Chuck Jones Collection is an exception to this, as an ""appropriately sixties"" piece of cartoon theme-style music (the opening credits theme for ""Jerry, Jerry, Quite Contrary"" by Dean  Elliot) plays at an equally appropriate sound level.  THIS SHOULDN'T EVEN NEED TO BE LISTED AS A ""PRO"", but the loudness issue is so prevalent on Warner animation set main menus that such a welcome change should be noted.

The Cartoons:  (Categorized as GRADE ""A"", GRADE ""F"" and everything else falls somewhere in between!)

GRADE ""A"":

""Pent-House Mouse""

""The Cat Above, The Mouse Below  (Tied for Best!)

""Snowbody Loves Me

""Bad Day at Cat Rock

""Of Feline Bondage""

""Duel Personality"" (Tied for Best!)

""Jerry, Jerry, Quite Contrary""

""Filet Meow""

""Cat And Dupli-Cat""

""The Mouse From H.U.N.G.E.R.""

""Surf-Bored Cat""

All other shorts fall somewhere below ""A"" and above ""F"", including...

A SPECIAL ODD-HONORABLE MENTION:  ""O-Solar-Meow"", ""Guided Mouse-ille"" and ""Advance And Be Mechanized"".  Chuck Jones was the master of the ""Duck Season / Rabbit Season Trilogy"".  These cartoons make up his ""Robot Cat / Robot Mouse Trilogy""!  Not great, but not terrible either.

GRADE ""F"":

""Matinee Mouse"" and ""Shutter Bugged Cat""  For their jarring use of old Hanna-Barbera stock footage - and for using it without Scott Bradley's music!  A double demerit!

The cartoons more than average out to a ""PRO""!  And so does the DVD set as a whole.

In the final analysis TOM AND JERRY, under the stewardship of Charles M. (""Chuck"") Jones, was great and unusually innovative at its beginning - but, unfortunately, began to peter-out as Jones stepped further and further away from it.

The best entries were where Jones, Michael Maltese, Maurice Noble and Eugene Poddany came together as a fine creative force, experimenting all the way - and the lesser entries occurred when they did not.  Though writer Bob Ogle contributed some worthy exceptions to this rule throughout the run.

As a DVD collection, the cartoons in this set are well worth multiple viewings and will provide many hours of enjoyment.  (I watched ""Surf-Bored Cat"" four times in one day!)

Even the lesser efforts were among the best (...if not ACTUALLY the best) theatrical animated shorts of their time.  Keeping it in THAT perspective, I recommend this set to anyone with an interest in Chuck Jones, Tom and Jerry, and the animated shorts of the sixties.

3796229,4,B001U3N3QY,"Although it could be argued that the sixties didn't exactly hit a high water mark in terms of animation of classic cartoon characters like Tom and Jerry, Bugs, Mickey Mouse, etc., MGM's decision to entrust the creative direction of T&J to the legendary Chuck Jones was inspired.  When ""classic"" T&J shorts from the 40's play on TV, I find them to be visually impressive but not terribly funny.

Chuck Jones, operating with limited technical budgets in the 60's, understood the limitations of his animation and put more of an emphasis on characterizations and movement of his characters--to great comedic effect.  Note the small things--from Tom's frequent double takes, to ""breaking the 3rd wall"" and staring directly at the camera--to the way he will kind of stutter step when rounding a curve at high speeds.  Just little bits of comedy business that work beautifully.  Glad to see these shorts now available on DVD.  I will buy!",1246233600,3,931,4.974193548387097
3796230,5,B001U3N3QY,"It surprised me to read the lukewarm reviews to Chuck Jones' T&J shorts.  Why buy something you don't enjoy just to ""own the set""?  When I watched these cartoons as a child, I was always happy to see Tom meowing and hissing as the MGM lion. I then knew it would be one of my favorites! I guess to some individuals the stories are boring, but I often thought they were hilarious! The lack of dialogue was in no way a hindrance to me in enjoying the cartoon. I could watch them with my non-English speaking cousin and we would laugh together.  The artwork and music was (and still is) my particular favorite. Chuck Jones' style always appealed to me and I love the way the characters move. I guess it's just a matter of personal taste!
I never bought the other collections because the Chuck Jones shorts were the ones I loved the best and the only ones I wanted.  When I saw this particular set on sale, I was overjoyed! Own it because you love it!

3796231,3,B001U3N3QY,"To be honest, I bought this set for completion of my Tom and Jerry collection mostly. First off, I think Charles M. Jones is a genius.  I love his Warner Bros. work.  However, even as a kid 40 years ago I knew there was something strange about his Tom and Jerry cartoons.  They're pretty.  The layouts are nice.  I enjoy his take on the looks of the characters (Tom often looks like Jones's Grinch).  But there's one big problem - the cartoons are boring!  The humor is on the cute side, and when it does try to have more of an edge, it just seems forced. I've tried to watch the set for the last two days and my son has had to come in and wake me up several times!  Sorry, Chuck.  Anyway, the set itself is fine.  Transfers beautiful.  Extras are just so-so.  Sometimes ""documentaries"" can be kind of padded, and the one about Chuck and Tom and Jerry really is.",1245888000,37,862,4.220858895705521
3796232,1,B001U3N3QY,"These cartoons are typical of the later style of Chuck Jones' animation style; lazy, derivitive and self-plagiarizing.  Has anyone else noticed how similar his works were to each other??  Be it the Grinch, Tom & Jerry or the later incarnations of the iconic Bugs Bunny, they ALL begin to look like each other!!  The eyes especially betray the character's similiarity.  If visual evidence was ever required to demonstrate how Chuck Jones' glory days were far behind him, this is your answer.  My recommendation:  Avoid these dismal works, and lobby for the release of the earlier, less PC, versions of the classic Tom & Jerry!",1245628800,13,625,4.961538461538462
3796233,4,B001U3N3QY,"There is no question about the successful influence that Hanna-Barbera had made with the Tom & Jerry cartoons, and the testiments of time they still have on today's animation. But, back in the 60's, someone very classic had taken the gamble of being with M.G.M. for the success of making Tom & Jerry come alive, the legendary Chuck Jones. At the time, with all the success he had working with Warner Brothers, there was a financial problem that came up, with them selling their legendary Termite Terrace studios, where Chuck, Friz Freleng and company had made great Warner Brothers Looney Tunes with Bugs Bunny, Foghorn Leghorn, and the Road Runner, it meant the end of the animation era. Unlike the others who'd stuck with staying, Chuck Jones and his team headed to M.G.M. Now, the success they had with their Tom & Jerry era is finally available on DVD.

Tom & Jerry: The Chuck Jones Collection, is a 2 disc DVD collection that reflects all of the cartoons that Chuck Jones produced, and took part in on direction with his leads like Abe Levitow, story writer Michael Maltese, and Maurice Noble. The collection features all the shorts that Jones and his team had created from their Tom & Jerry M.G.M. era from 1963-1968. The shorts have all been remastered well, and are a great trip down memory lane. While they aren't as definitive in Oscars, as was the case with the Hanna-Barbera era, Jones and company had made classics of their own. There are some great ones here like Cat & Duplicat where Tom catches Jerry on a ship in the moonlight, only to not recognize another cat demands Jerry from him, in a quest to see whom shall be able to claim Jerry as his own, Duel Personality, where Jerry challenges Tom to a old-fashioned duel in the meadow, after being fed up with Tom chasing him with a ball and chain medevil weapon. Little do they know as they duel, they both cancel each other out by being equal in sword fighting, cannons, and bow and arrows, and The Mouse From Hunger, where Jerry takes on a 007-style mission to capture cheese from a sneeky Tom whom deals with Jerry in a diabolical way, and Matinee Mouse where Tom & Jerry truce, and go to the movies where they watch themselves duke each other out, in a retrospective from the classic Hanna-Barbera shorts.

There are a few extras here as well, reflecting on the late Chuck Jones perspective on his days working with M.G.M. The documentary is very scentimental to watch, and is a treat for die hard fansof Chuck jones legendary career. Sadly though, there are a few disadvantages with the DVD set. While I love the idea that the Tom & Jerry shorts are highlighted here, I honestly was also hoping that there could've been a few added bonuses on this set as well, some of the other great shorts that Jones had worked on with M.G.M. could've been highlighted here too like his classic gems The Dot & The Line, and his clever skit The Bear That Wasn't. These treasures could've been added here to showcase that Chuck Jones was just more here, and what he had brought into the M.G.M. library.

All in all, for hard core Tom & Jerry fans, Tom & Jerry: The Chuck Jones Collection is a treat that still shows just the innovation that Chuck Jones had made is still just as fun to watch today, as it was when he made these gems years ago. If you haven't experienced any of Chuck Jones works with M.G.M., than this would be a good place to start. While Chuck Jones era with Tom & Jerry wasn't as strong as the classic Hanna-Barbera days, they still are a reminder of what a memory we've lost when Chuck died back in 2002. While Tom hasn't completely caught Jerry yet, the fun of the final classic Tom & Jerry days from M.G.M. are well-documented here.

8342725,5,B001U3N3QY,"After Gene Deitch's Tom & Jerry era ended in 1962, and Chuck Jones and his animation team got booted from the WB from making UPA's Gay Purr-ee, that same year, Chuck Jones' team went to MGM to make another era of Tom & Jerry shorts, 34 in all from 1963 to '67, even using Mel Blanc and June Foray for many of the sounds being made in those shorts! When comes to full-animation and stylized animation, as much as Chuck Jones preferred full-animation, he was one of the inventors of stylized, or limited, animation via the creation of UPA in the 1940's! To quote Tweety Bird from the WB, ""Ooh, what a hypocwite!"" But a lot of his work for the WB was anything but hypocritical, even during his last years there! Most of Jones' work at MGM was far from hypocritical, too, even paying tribute to Tom & Jerry's Hanna-Barbera era in a couple of Chuck Jones shorts! In 2009, the WB put all 34 Tom & Jerry shorts from their Chuck Jones era in this 2-disc DVD set, remastered but in Faux-Widescreen, predating the Looney Tunes Super Stars similar screw-ups by 1 whole year! Just like the Gene Deitch era, the Chuck Jones shorts are also filmed in Fullscreen to begin with, especially in the case of the H-B tribute shorts! Oh well, better to have these on DVD like they are, than to let the WB finish the Golden Collection sets with these shorts in Fullscreen, which'll be the 12th of Never, to quote a classic song's name, due to the debacle with Mouse Cleaning and Casanova Cat from the Hanna-Barbera era! Just like Bill Hanna and Joe Barbera, Chuck Jones is also an animation giant, even in spite of his own hypocrisies about full- and stylized animation! He even praised Art Leonardi's work at DePatie-Freleng in a fan letter, calling him Art Leonardi da Vinci! At any rate, this Tom & Jerry set has a few extras, including Tom & Jerry & Chuck's history via a documentary narrated by June Foray, the Queen of voice acting herself! As well as Chuck's own life leading to his animation career and as a director, via a surprisingly-uncensored documentary, previously aired on TCM in March 2009! During his era at MGM, Chuck Jones also made some non-T&J treasures and rarities, such as the Oscar-winning The Dot and the Line from 1965, The Bear That Wasn't in 1967, The Phantom Tollbooth in 1970, and especially the first Seuss specials How The Grinch Stole Christmas (1966) & Horton Hears A Who (1970), which proved new Full-animation was possible on TV back then, by someone other than Disney! Chuck's team started working on The Cat in the Hat as a Seuss special, but MGM shut down their animation methods in 1970, and the special was completed by DePatie-Freleng in 1971, and became the first of their own 7 Seuss specials up to 1982, as DFE turned into Marvel! Chuck's team then became Chuck Jones Enterprises in 1970, and made a lot of other treasures and rarities, until the WB rehired them AND DFE for many Looney Tunes' projects starting in 1976! Conclude your Tom & Jerry classic shorts collection with their Chuck Jones era today!",1499904000,2,3031,4.583793738489871
