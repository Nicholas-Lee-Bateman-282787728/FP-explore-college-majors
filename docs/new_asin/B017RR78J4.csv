7516568,5,B017RR78J4,"Intense and moving!  Inspired by true events.  Emory Cohen was great in BROOKLYN and he's even more amazing in STEALING CARS.  In fact the entire cast is incredible (John Leguizamo, Felicity Huffman, Mike Epps, Heaher Lind, Paul Sparks, William H. Macy)!  This is the kind of work that all indie films should aspire to: important story, awesome cast, beautiful cinematography and deeply thoughtful & nuanced directing!!!  A true must see!",1459900800,2,438,5.2
7516569,4,B017RR78J4,"Tomorrow doesnt have to be yesterday. Billy Wyatt (Cohen) is rebelling against everything. When he finally gets caught and arrested he takes his attitude with him. Little by little he finds out his attutide has to change. With the help of warden De La Cruz (Leguizamo) Billy begins to realize why and how to change. This is a movie that was a total surprise. It started off OK but the more I watched the more I enjoyed it, and by the end it became a movie that I want to tell everyone to watch. The acting is great and the movie just feels real. The movie is emotional and moving without really trying to be and really punches you in the gut with the ending, in a good way. There really isn't a whole lot I can talk about without giving something away because it really builds on the emotion throughout and the pay off is more than worth it. All I will say is that this is what movies should be and I highly recommend. Overall, one of the reasons why I say the big budget movies are not as good as the independent ones. This should get more of an audience than it will. I give this an A.",1459814400,5,1087,4.156398104265403
7516570,3,B017RR78J4,"Stealing Cars stars Emory Cohen (Brooklyn, The Place Beyond the Pines) as Billy Wyatt, a rebellious teenager sent to juvenile detention, where he encounters harsh injustice, stands up to his incarcerators, and discovers unexpected friendship. Billy has great promise, but a troubled past that includes dealing drugs and grand theft auto lands him in the Bernville Camp for Boys. Billy must rely on his survival skills to avoid dangerous inmates and a cruel, sadistic staff.

The movie attempts to expose the failures of the juvenile detention system in America. Like McMurphy in One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest, Billys refusal to be beaten down by the system earns him the admiration and respect of some of the other detainees but causes him to be singled out as a troublemaker by the staff. Initially, its hard to believe that Billy is as intelligent as hes portrayed despite his ability to quote from Camus and recite sections from Fahrenheit 451. As the film progresses, however, his back story is revealed, providing insight into why Billy took the path that led him to Bernville.

The film has a first-class supporting cast. William H. Macy and Felicity Huffman play Billys parents, John Leguizamo is a concerned counselor who may not be trustworthy, and Mike Epps portrays the local sheriff who offers some wise advice to Billy. Unfortunately, these roles are small and fail to take full advantage of the actors talents.

There are no bonus features on the R-rated widescreen DVD release.",1459641600,,1493,5.012096774193548
7516571,5,B017RR78J4,"I have worked in rehabilitation centers for adolescents, and I feel like this film is an accurate portrayal of the corruption that happens there.  I related to the heartbreak of being someone who is trying to help, but feels stuck in a system that doesn't recognize the brilliance and trauma of the youth that it is supposedly trying to serve, but really just ends up punishing and retraumatizing the youth.  The jokes were funny and the plot was engaging and riveting.  Well done!",1462838400,,481,4.771084337349397
7516572,2,B017RR78J4,"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.

I enjoyed the concept behind this movie and wished it well when I began watching it. A restless youth trying to find a way to blend into society? Sounded like a good idea to me, a sort of REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE for a new decade. The end result left me wishing for something better fitting the theme.

Billy Wyatt (Emory Cohen) is a trouble youth sent to the Bernville Camp for Boys for stealing cars. Here is where things begin to go south. The camp begins to fill out with clichs from nearly every prison movie ever seen. We have the sadistic guard who takes no guff and deals out corporal punishment whenever he can. We have various groups in the camp who keep themselves sorted from one another. And we have an anti-hero who walks around with a smart mouth and becomes friends with no group but with a single other outsider.

As the film progresses the warden of the facility, Montgomery De La Cruz (John Leguizamo), attempts to break down the walls that Billy has built around himself in an attempt to help him. At least at times it seems that way. At other times the character seems to revert back to being that stereotypical warden character seen in so many films. There is no fault in Leguizamo on this matter but in the writing of the character. One moment he seems threatening and the next sympathetic.

As Billy deals with his time in the camp in various ways. He breaks out on at least three separate occasions. Somehow that feels like the security in this place needs work but no one ever addresses that. He begins what could be a romantic connection to the camp nurse (Heather Lind), an employee that seems to be there for battling her own demons rather than to help young people battling theirs. Lastly he breaks down the barriers between different factions in the camp to get them to unite in a project taking on the role of leader. These separate issues never seem to quite gel before the end of the film though each of them are answered.

What really does harm to the movie is the low end quality of the whole film. The look is less polished than most and not done so from an artistic standpoint at least that I could tell. The performances are just so so and the main character of Billy as portrayed by Cohen lacks any reason for anyone to feel sympathy for him, even when we learn what sent him over the edge. So much time is spent making him seem like such a jerk that by the time we should feel something for him we cant care. His quips and attempts at being a smart aleck are lame at best and unbelievable for the most part.

In the end you want to care for Billy and the rest of the boys in the camp but the movie feels more like an afterschool special than a feature film. Im certain there are some for whom this film will fulfill the needs they have and the standards that they set but for me I found it lacking. Its supposed to be based on a true story but my guess is the real story was far more interesting than its portrayed here.",1462752000,,3014,4.297535211267606

7516579,2,B017RR78J4,I personally did not find this story very believable.  A cocky young kid that believes he is above the law gets himself into more trouble after his capture ends up with not only one but several opportunities to escape.  The attitude this young man has needs to be put in check and nobody seems to be able to get to reason with him to change his ways before it is too late.  No problems with video or audio quality.,1461024000,,414,4.215189873417722
7516580,4,B017RR78J4,"William Wyatt (Emory Cohen) is a gifted high school kid with a photographic memory. He steals cars, deals in mushrooms, and likes to get high. His antics land him in the Bernville Camp for Boys, a juvenile boot camp. Here we have the typical sadistic guard (Paul Sparks); the director (John Leguizamo) who turns a blind eye to what is happening in his camp; and a nurse (Heather Lind) with Mr. Jones still on her back.

William's gift allows him to make friends in all the cliques as he tries to save Nathan (Al Calderon) a kid who is seriously ill and not getting the proper medical attention he needs.

The story is ""inspired by true events"" and is one of a number of juvenile camp films out there, all with basically the same prison plot line, i.e. new person, makes, friends, evil system, revolt. My favorite ones have Pamela Grier in them, and their was an interesting one with a ghost. This one is of a more serious nature and is made watchable because of the likeable unpredictable bad boy character of Billy Wyatt.

I think they could have come up with a better title. I would avoid IMDB on this film as they have posted a plot spoiler review.

8740421,5,B017RR78J4,"The writing was both beautiful and powerful and Emory Cohen's performance: electric.

The scene in the laundry with ""El Poeta""best acting in an indie film scene in the last decade. I watched it repeatedly to catch all the subtle expressions and use of language. Brilliant.

Cohen is an actor to watch.",1492992000,,301,4.882352941176471
8740422,3,B017RR78J4,"Basically a kid who has no respect for society, we see him littering then stealing a car in the opening scenes before being arrested, is sent to Bernville Camp for Boys, some sort of juvie type place.  We shortly learn this isn't his first incarcerated experience but the warden believes this forced boarding school will benefit the kid's future.  But the kid shows the same lack of respect for the outside world to the juvie prison staff, he plays the class clown in the dining room, classroom and while the group of inmates is being punished (usually because of his lack of respect actions).  Like all prison movies that can't be bothered thinking up their own original plot, this one has a prison guard who enjoys tormenting those who cross him as well as sadistically bullying a loner kid who would be the target of bullies in a normal school. A prison warden who says he cares about inmates future but has his own motives. The prison's lone female staff member the nurse in the infirmary feeling sorry for the misunderstood offender and being on his side against the rest of the authority who he of course has a crush on. Different races not interacting letting other races sit at their table.

Really there's nothing new here.  Those done to death prison storylines also are a bit inconsistent at times. Some spoilers- The warden is an inconsistent character we're not shown enough about him for his shoot him stance at the end to make sense.  Likewise our sadistic guard, I'm not shooting a kid, wasn't consistent with a guy who would straight jacket and chain another kid clearly dying to a light pole. The main character's dislike and hostility to his mother when she visited was never explained.  What did she do for this reaction from him?  Perhaps she blamed him, beat him for the death of her husband and daughter, but we never saw that if it happened. Even if they had a low budget she could have confided in the warden when he walked her out. Were we supposed to be blindsided by their deaths by the way, it was pretty obvious that was what happened to them early on in the film.

Unless you're really into prison films and just want to watch everything that's out there. or perhaps are a fan of one or more of the actors and want to watch everything they are in, I'd give this a miss.  You're bigger names of Felicity Huffman and William H Macy have very small not much more than cameo roles in this by the way.",1490832000,,2427,4.507972665148063
