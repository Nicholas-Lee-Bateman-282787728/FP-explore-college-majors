The woman who plays the girl who has been apparently reincarnated or possessed by a spirit does a nice job, which is the best we can say about the film.  There are two stories going on: a murder trial in the present with the lawyer trying to prove a connection with the past life as a motivation & the events in the past.  Several versions of the murder including the body discovered in the river complicate the story.  The strangest aspect of the film [SPOILER ALERT] is the frozen male & female genitals that were cut from the bodies of two frozen people who apparently froze as they made love.  Now stored in a glass jar in a lab, they apparently contain psychic power.  It is discovered that they must be destroyed in order to stop the curse in the present.  Seeing the detached body parts is not erotic, however.  It serves to make a disjointed plot seem more strange.  This is a film that you cheer when it finally ends because you managed to sit through the whole thing.  Taxi!",1197849600,,1028,4.420212765957447
8150539,1,B000JJ4VUW,"I usually do not review one-star films, as there are enough bad films to keep me busy writing reviews on amazon for the rest of my life. I also have the largest asian film collection of anyone I know; and I am still continuing to review many films from this collection. However, I decided to rent this DVD, while my wife and children were shopping. Looking over the lastest videos, I decided I would give this film a look. And I am glad I did [to some degree]. Many films I purchase are usually well-priced, and on the spot from asian video outlets, or video stores here in California [L.A.]: therefore I am able to get really good bargains.

This film is not a good bargain even for renting. I usually do not write to reviewers that a film is a waste, and that they should not waste their time with a particular film. I will usually write that the film was not very good, however, others may enjoy the film. I do not know how anyone can enjoy this film. It is really ridiculous, and the storyline is horrible. The film centers on a serial killer of women, who likes to save their sexual organs. The main antagonist however, is living a dual life [not psychosis with a split personality] but another past life. In the film this is given full weight when he is brought to trial.

Yes, even the judge has doubts as to whether or not the individual is truly possessed by the past life of someone else. To make matters worse, even the defense attorney goes about as if this were a normal abberation. All the while, the prosecution tells the judge, even if this were true, the individual now charged with the crimes is still a killer, even if he were possessed. Wow, this review has gone on long enough. The film is sickening in its depiction, with bad writing, and I really don't think you would like this film. If you want to see a film about Karma, and past life experiences with similar themes, only really good, try ""RUNNING ON KARMA,"" starring Andy Lau: now that is a really great film. This one you might want to avoid. Not recommended. [One star is one too many!]",1168646400,4,2066,4.377604166666667
