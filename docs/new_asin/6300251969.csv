278123,4,6300251969,"This film received 4 stars because it is soooo bad, it's enjoyable! Anton Levey had his satanic hands in this one, advising on the script. Apparently, he knows about as much about film-scripting as anything. It really shows his stupidity and the gullibility of the audience to believe it presents anything realistic. Borgnine plays a campy role as leader of a satanic cult hanging out in a desolate ghost-town. Shattner is at his all time campy best, and Travolta is, well, just try to find Travolta in this, because his part is very 'small' (pun intended). As another reviewer, I saw this film at a very young age. I was frightened (pre-teens tend to be easy that way). Mainly, though, I was interested in the cheesy-on -a-second-look effect of people without eyes (achieved by bad make-up laid over obvious black scrims).
Essentially, Borgnine collects souls in a crystal, and searches for a 'McGuffin' (a pointless object to drive the plot) hidden with Shattner's family.
If you're looking for one of the following things; a great performance by Borgnine, Shattner, Travolta, or a classic and frightening horror film, look elsewhere. If you're looking for maximum Nacho Cheese at Camp Hokey, you will not be disappointed! A humorous film to delight the most jaded Ed Wood fan.

THIS MOVIE STARS ERNEST BORGNINE AND WILLIAM SHATNER AND IS ALMOST 90 MINS LONG.
IT WAS MADE IN 1975, HOWEVER IT WASN'T RELEASED UNTIL LATER.
THE ACTING IS FINE, AND THE STORY IS OKAY.
I MUST NOTE THAT THE LAST SEQUENCE OF THE FILM IS QUITE DISGUSTING AND THE EFFECTS ARE QUITE IMPRESSIVE FOR THE TIME!
THE PICTURE LEAVES A LOT TO BE DESIRED AND THE AUDIO TOO.
HOWEVER, IF HORROR MOVIES ARE YOUR THING AND YOU WANT TO SEE A MOVIE ABOUT SATANISM, THEN THIS IS THE MOVIE FOR YOU!

278125,4,6300251969,"God, I remember seeing this movie as a kid.  The next time I saw it was about a year ago curtesy of Joe Bob Briggs.  I had forgotten what a great movie this was.  Great in the cult sense that is.
""The Devil's Rain"" has a good, if somewhat trite, story.  But it's a tried and true formula so how can you go wrong with that? The performances aren't all that bad given the motley crew of actors they've assembled here.  Even Bill Shatner adds a splendid understated performance, not often giving vent to bouts of dramatics.  And what can you say about Ernest Borgnine as the Devil's disciple?  Priceless!  The only actor I didn't get was John Travolta.  He gets billed in the credits but he's not even a really a character.  Indeed, you don't even see him in the film unless you're specifically looking for him.
All this from the guy who brought us the classic ""The Abominable Dr. Phibes"".  Though ""Devil's Rain"" doesn't quite live up to the standards of the aforementioned flick it's still a decent movie and is genuinely entertaining.  You'll even notice Anton LaVey in the credits under technical advisor.  Hard to imagine,though, since he criticised ""The Exorcist"" that he'd want to jump on board for this.

Amazingly enough, The Devil's Rain has the same effect on me now as when I was a kid. Very scary and and a great cast- Ernest Borgnine, William Shatner, and John Travolta in a very small part.

278231,5,6300251969,"I really liked this movie, but it does have some things about it that need to be put to rest before you judge it. First of all...

lt is a low quality film by many mainstream standards. lt has a lot of lame acting. The storyline is not totally coherent and/or consistent. lt is overall, a corny, 70s horror movie about Satanic greater magic rituals. So bear all of that in mind, mentally prepare to appreciate that kind of movie, and allow yourself to be entertained by it. Here's where l'll explain the reasons l love it:

Devil's Rain has some really great actors in it. William Shatner and Tom Skerritt play frontline roles as, you might traditionally say, the 'good guys.' Their characters represent stereotypical, morally lukewarm Christians, at odds in the movie with a cult.  This cult, headquartered in a desert ghost town, is led by Jonathan Corbis, played amazingly by Ernest Borgnine. His character Corbis, furiously devoted to Satanic worship, has time travelled by way of black magic as a demon shapeshifter to pursue the Preston family, them being descendants of the 17th century pilgrim group that delivered Corbis to witch hunters.

As if to give more hardcore fans a little easter egg they'd have to look for, Anton LaVey is very briefly in the film as a priest in Corbis' rituals.  Also making a random appearance is a young John Travolta. Both of these men have hyper brief roles and barely utter 3 lines between them.  Hands down though, the scenes with Borgnine playing the most unexpectedly convincing role of a deathly passionate sorcerer, absolutely make the movie. His voice, his evil looking eyebrows, the striking red robes he wears, his over-the-top yet perfectly executed lines... This is gold, really. In a super obscure movie like this, too.

lf you like old horror movies, 70s horror movies, movies about devil worship, etc, any or all of the above... watch this dam movie. Hell, buy it, it's like less than $10, used. Borgnine's acting is incredible, grisly gore effects cap off the ending, the occult rituals and imagery are authentically enacted, and you have the mega flavour that comes with this type of low budget, high enjoyability film. Devil's Rain is a gem, and an absolute must-have for obscure movie fans and occult aficionados.",1490400000,2,2272,4.855297157622739

278362,4,6300251969,"Wow! I have to thank Youtube (well, the guy who the uploaded it onto the site) for rekindling memories of watching this 70s horror flick starring William Shatner, Ernest Borgnine, Tom Skerritt, and John Travolta. ""The Devil's Rain"" scared the heck out of me when I was a kid but watching it all these years later, the effects just aren't the same anymore. The effects are cheesy by today's standards, and the plot is hackneyed, but I was still entertained.

This film centers around the evil spirit of a Satanic priest, Corbis (played by Ernest Borgnine) who stalks the Preston family due to their betrayal of him and his followers. Corbis is after a Satanic book that is kept by the Preston family. Mark Preston (William Shatner) is beseeched by his dying father to return the book to Corbis. Later, when Mark falls under Corbis' evil spell, Mark's older brother, Tom (Tom Skerritt) tries to put an end to the evil Satanist.

John Travolta plays a bit role here, and I think this was Travolta's film debut. This film is also notable for having an actual practicing Satanist as its technical advisor, the renowned Satanist Anton La Vey himself. La Vey also has a minor role in the film. Those who enjoy occult-themed movies and don't mind the cheesy effects of low-budget B-films will find something of interest here.",1405987200,,1317,4.746724890829694

There is also a nice cameo by technical advisor/author/founder of the Church of Satan Anton Szandor LaVey.

278423,5,6300251969,"The ""Devil's Rain"" was one of the first horror films I watched that involved the devil. I was sufficiently frightened and intrigued enough watch this movie two more times. The plot is rife with hallucinatory imagery that reminds one of an acid trip through hell. The genre favorite, William Shatner, is the victim of a generational Satanic curse that follows him through hundreds of years. The devil is portrayed sinisterly by Ernest Borgnine. The creepy, malevolent vibe of the scenery in the abandoned mining town is wonderfully done. Also, the chilling and constant moaning of those damned souls of the cult are enough to make the viewer lower the volume a little. The satanic lore of the film was well researched and believable. It should be noted that the the black pope himself, Anton Szander LaVey, was a technical adviser to the film. He had a cameo appearance in the black mass scene as well. Probably the best feature of ""The Devil's Rain"" is the final few moments of the movie in which the cult actually experience the devil's rain...literally.

Fresh from the Starship Enterprise is Captain Kirk: pitted against Arch-Satanist Ernest Borgnine and followers, with the story revolving around the possession of an Ancient Book.  Anton LaVey is the Magical advisor to this film, (also enjoying a cameo role), and the chants uttered by the Satanic Congregation in the story are authentic, Enochian Magical intonations: employed in Church of Satan Rituals. The special effects (during an era of no special effects) are really good, and the demise of the Diabolists actually remains quite unnerving (especially in this un-cut version). Some people have said that the acting is bad: Well, okay - it's obvious that none of the cast will have rehearsed an Oscar Acceptance Speech, but does this not add to the tongue-in-cheek style demanded by Director Bob (""Dr. Phibes"") Fuest?

278481,3,6300251969,"The Supernatural 70s brought on a range of religiously charged Horror films following the success of THE EXORCIST, but instead of repeating the same serious psychological tones set by Friedkin or Polanski, director Robert Fuest (THE ABOMINABLE DR. PHIBES) creates a light mood despite the dark atmosphere in this fun but cheesy Satanic flick. One of the devil's disciples attempts to deliver a bounty of souls to his master after reclaiming an ancient tome from the family that spoiled his evil plan 300 years earlier. It is up to the family's last remaining son to intervene and destroy Satan's minions once and for all! William Shatner and Ernest Borgnine ham it up in their respective roles of good versus evil, with their extreme overacting only adding to the charm and personality of the picture. Fuest's direction and style are far more reserved than in the PHIBES films, replacing the colorful Art Nouveau sets with darkly dressed halls and exteriors. Corbis' army of black-cloaked and eyeless followers are also quite unsettling as they silently block the Prestons' escape. The plot and characters inevitably take second stage to the special FX in the picture, which are best demonstrated in the goat-headed Corbis' make-up design and the gooey finale where the cult members are all melted away by The Devil's Rain. What it lacks in overall quality, it more than makes up for in campy fun, making THE DEVIL'S RAIN worth seeking out!

The special effects are also great for a movie from this time,(1975). Young actors like William Shatner, Joan Prather and Tom Skerritt do a good job in this film. Excellent seens of witch-craft and Satanic worship strengthen the stories plot. Very entertaining, even for this time.",1263168000,,457,4.725
278483,3,6300251969,"This one has to be thrown in with the ""so bad it's good"" DVD stockpile that we ALL have at home. Here we have a conglomerate of respected veteran [and THEN not so veteran] actors [+ one actress] in a contrived, pretentious and lugubrious movie about Devil worshipers in the Southwest. The list of vets who are so hard up that they basically make fools out of themselves includes a Best Actor Oscar winner [Ernest Borgnine, MARTY 1956], the great underrated actress and directress Ida Lupino [with Bogey in HIGH SIERRA, 1941], William Shatner [Captain James T. Kirk of the original STAR TREK, 1966-69] Tom Skerrett [ALIEN, 1979], John Travolta [PULP FICTION, 1994], Eddie Albert [60's TV sit-com GREEN ACRES] and everywhere character actor Keenan Wynn. Everybody except Borgnine seems to be in a coma in this one. All about the leader of a satanic cult [Ernie] who is after a book concealed by Shatner's family. Borgnine seems to be the dev's #1 sales rep on earth and ""the book"" seems to have the names of all those who have sold their you-know-what to the ""prince of the abyss"" in return for eternal life. Or something like that. To procure the book Borgnine begins to demonize each member of Kirk's, I mean Shatner's, family---an act that gives each victim a 'cut-out', black, no-eyes appearance and a catatonic countenance that is a trifle scary but also a bit comical when seen on an iconic protagonist's face. Though pretty bad, the flick is yet moderately creepy, lurid and unsettling. The opening credits feature a soundtrack consisting of the distant pleas of the eternally damned [hey, might as well get in the mood for this stuff] with a background of unusual and disturbing paintings by the 15th century Dutch artist Hieronymus Bosch who was into depictions of Hell and stuff like that. The credits also inform the viewer that the actual founder of the 'Church of Satan' has a bit role here. At least they tried. Shatner looks pretty silly throughout with his farm hat and his uninvolved and intermittently rote and forced acting. The scene where Borgnine turns his protective anti-devil necklace into a snake and Shatner yells "" Daaaugh! "" is hilarious. Tom Skerritt, who plays Shatner's brother, is in a daze throughout and is practically useless. Eddie Albert is loud, pretentious and annoying. Travolta is an almost unrecognizable mute. The purportedly memorable ending with the black-hooded satanists literally melting as the devil's rain comes pouring down is incessant and messy [don't be caught chowing down when watching this part]. When shot or melting the demons seem to ooze this slimy stuff that looks like different-flavor Slurpy, different-color pudding and heavens knows what else. Nifty ending scene as Skerritt hugs wife and viewer sees that presumed dead Borgnine is doing the hugging. Nice seeing the template for Jason's mask [FRIDAY  THE 13th, 1980] in Shatner's demonized face. Add this one to THE WICKER MAN [2006 version] as an essential so-bad-that-it's-good party must-see especially on Halloween night. Sit back and enjoy.",1251504000,3,3061,5.013752455795678

Shatner (after Star Trek TOS but many years before the era of the TJ Hooker Toupee) is a member of a rustic rural family out west that must keep a book hidden from the devil played by Ernie Borgnine. This book, you see, is sort of like a check register of all the souls that the devil had signed deals with back in the day...Tom Skerrit plays the Shat's brother and a scientist that's studying ESP or whatever was hip back in the 70s. Eddie Albert from Green Acres works with Skerritt and...now my hair hurts...John Travolta plays one of the cult members. The atmosphere is total 1970s horror. This movie would make a perfect double feature with Touch of Satan. You must watch this movie. You must, I say!

278547,4,6300251969,"I remember seeing the advertisement for THE DEVIL'S RAIN as a child and it was quite thought provoking at the time. Too young to see it, the images stuck with me until the day I was able to view it myself, very late at night on CREATURE FEATURE. I'm not sure what I would have thought  as a child if I had seen it when it originally came out but it didn't affect me the lease. There were so many incredible things about this movie starting with an all star cast (William Shatner, Ernest Borgnine, Eddie Albert, a young Tom Skerritt, Anton LeVay, and a short appearance from John Travolta, you wouldn't have seen him if you blinked an eye).

Jonathan Corbis (Ernest Borgnine) is the leader of a group of Satanists who is in search of the sacred book that was taken away and has all the names inscribed of the people who have willfully or unwillfully given themselves to the devil. The pace is very slow, creating a mood that is melodic combined with a musical score that is hypnotically driven. This movie has atomsphere, forget about the acting. Plus it takes place in the desert with large Joshua trees in the background and a ghost town style like church. The climax of the movie makes up for everything! Remember Zots, the candy that fizzed in your mouth? Well, that's what happens at the end, only it's the people who are fizzing away and it goes on and on. Puddles of zotting flesh desolving in the rain. This isn't for everyone but if you like bad horror movies from the distant past this one has all the elements.",1184716800,2,1520,4.425
278548,2,6300251969,"I'm a HUUUUGE fan of 60's/70's corney psychotronic B-movies; no one loves to watch a corney movie and have a good laugh at night with the popcorn more than myself.
However....
This movie just wasn't that good or that funny either....Ernest Borgnine is a cheesy devil-worshipper, Shatner, as usual is way over the top, Ida Lupino is awful, Eddie Albert is a master cornball, and Tom Skerrit is decent in this short, brainless film.

There are so many holes in the plot it's just nuts. One of the biggest things that cracked me up is Anton LaVey's presence in the movie. The guy is supposedly the ""high priest of the church of satan."" BROTHER!? His brand of Satanism is more of an Ayn Rand libertine philosophy supposedly non-violent, non-sacrificial, non-hateful, just indulgent and selfish. Yeah, right. Then if satanism is so neutral, non-violent, and sweety-poo, why is Senor LaVey the ""technical advisor"" for a movie that shows sacrifices, murder, melting people's faces, conjuring a goat monster, sending souls to eternal fire and torture, stabbings, etc.? hmmmmm....One would think that if satanism is so passive and just indulgent that all the satanists in this flick would be wusses!?  Fact is, in the 70's satanism was a huge interest and guilty pleasure for some folks.  Satanism appauls me and I'm disgusted at the whole idea of jerkwads like LaVey.  But, I thought the movie would give me some chuckles and some psychotronic laughs.  It didn't.  Not very clever or fun. Not Plan Nine or Laserblast funny.  Definitely not full of things to polk fun at. Just plain dumb.  All these people that thought this movie was scary need therapy!? Corney!  What was I thinking? Ida Lupino, Shatner, Keenen Winn and a melting John Travolta?  Maybe I need therapy! lol",1182297600,,1765,4.912457912457913

  Long ago the book of the souls  that had been claimed by Satan was stolen and he wants it back. The family that has it is in trouble now. With an all-star cast this little horror movie is more fun than it should be. Not great but I found myself getting into it all over again.

278551,3,6300251969,"In the wake of ""Deep Throat"", the Peraino family was swimming in cash and looking for a way to give it that squeaky clean shine. You see, the Perainos were members of the Columbo family, and odd as it seems to those of us raised from the Eighties onward, porno flicks and the storefront loops that preceded them were very much an illegal commodity to produce. So, Louis ""Butch"" Peraino headed west and decided to open his own production and distribution house called Bryanston Pictures. Bryanston made quite a name for themselves by distributing material that other studios wouldn't touch, like ""Andy Warhol's Frankenstein""; the still unavailable-on-DVD ""Coonskin""; and their crown jewel, ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"". A D.A. in Memphis, eager to make a name for himself, indicted Peraino and other members of his family, and soon after their conviction in April 1976, Bryanston's west coast office closed for good. A much more detailed version of this story is contained in Legs McNeil's wonderful book ""The Other Hollywood"", which I can't recommend strongly enough. So you came here looking for a description of melting satan worshippers and not a history lesson, eh? Well, it's coming, just let me finish ;) The reason for the spiel about Bryanston is that ""The Devil's Rain"" just happens to be one of the last films they handled. And among such stiff competition as ""Frankenstein"", probably the strangest.

""TDR"" can get confusing, but the basic story goes something like this. 300 years ago, Puritans caught wind that there was a group of the devil's minions in their midst. Now, this was a strange scene, kittys, seeing as how they were lead by Corbis (Ernest Borgnine in Pilgrim garb) and counted among their number William Shatner. Ol' Billy's wife takes Corbis' big book full of blood pledges to Lucifer to the Puritan chief, and bam, we've got a full scale stake burning. Flash forward to the present day, and either Corbis or his descendant (it's never made clear) is after that book, and the Preston family that harbors it. Sounds fun, huh? Well, where else can you see Shatner crucified upside down? Or Borgnine hamming it up in goat makeup? Heck, ""The Devil's Rain"" cornered the market on melting the enemies of God six years before ""Raiders of the Lost Ark""!

Anton LeVay was some sort of consultant to the producers, and even makes a cameo during the black mass. I guess he had a sense of humor. Director Robert Fuest is better known for the two ""Dr. Phibes"" films he made with Vincent Price, and the critical and commercial reception to this picture relegated him to television movies. Even so, ""TDR"" had an impact on the history of horror films well beyond what anyone could have imagined at the time. Check out Shatner's face after he becomes an eyeless zombie. Look familiar? That mask would become very, very famous a few years hence.

Time to upgrade, folks. Dark Sky makes the previous DVD edition obsolete. This new transfer from the 35mm negative is stunning by comparison. The extras include an audio commentary with Fuest, which I had a rather difficult time paying attention to, probably because both Fuest and the moderator have very dry, soft British voices. There's a short black-and-white clip of LeVay performing a marriage ceremony, the film's trailer, some production stills and a Dark Sky catalog. Turn off your mind, don't wonder why the Prestons haven't simply destroyed the book, and this might make a good beer and popcorn flick. It's very much of the mid-70s, which may be a good or bad thing depending on your particular perspective.",1168732800,30,3576,4.887973640856672
278552,3,6300251969,"I love the original Star Trek series. I used to stay up until 1 A.M. every Sunday night, even though I knew that I had to get up at 7 A.M. for school, just to watch the reruns. I never really tried to understand why I loved it so much when I was younger, but now I realize that my affection was due, to a great extent, to one man: William Shatner. He made Captain Kirk a mesmerizing presence, moreso than the much more refined thespian, Patrick Stewart, ever made Jean-Luc Picard on The Next Generation. Shatner's ego not only far exceeded his acting skills, but it also directed him toward a music career that defied all reason. He's a gem of an entertainer, there's no denying it.

When I started watching The Devil's Rain, Shatner's face was one of the first that I saw. I quickly noticed that his acting was no better in 1975, the year the movie was made, then it was on Star Trek. I was very happy because I knew that if nothing else in the movie was worthwhile, at least William Shatner's extraordinary theatrics would keep things moving. The good times began as I witnessed Shatner's anguished facial expressions as his father melted before his eyes. Then there was the part where he screamed the name ""Corbis!"", much like he did in The Wrath of Khan. And later the scene where he was tied to an inverted cross, and again he screamed his little heart out. All this was great. But then Shatner gets turned into a Satanic zombie, which cruelly limits his ability to overact. With Shatner zombified, a new protagonist enters the picture: The remarkably underwhelming... Tom Skerritt.

At that point, I kind of lost interest. I still watched the movie, of course, because I'm no quitter, but I did it with a feeling of emptiness. The most I can say for the movie after Shatner gets zombified is that there's a mass melting scene that kind of reminded me of Raiders of the Lost Ark, except without the exploding heads. And the blood was green instead of red.

There just isn't much to The Devil's Rain. Eddie Albert's in it, for all you Green Acres fans, and Ernest Borgnine plays the head Satanist/The Devil Himself. I guess John Travolta's supposed to be in the movie somewhere, but I never saw him (on the DVD case they show a picture of him as a zombie). Overall, it's just not that exciting. If I made this movie, I would have definitely given Skerritt's role to Shatner. Or even better, I would written a twin brother into the script, cast Shatner in both roles, and gotten rid of Skerritt all together. Then The Devil's Rain would be a true classic.",1166832000,5,2558,4.484978540772532
278553,3,6300251969,"The ""Mystery Science Theater"" gang would have a blast with 1975's ""The Devil's Rain,"" a work equally sinister and shlocky. Ernest Borgnine, Eddie Albert and William Shatner get top billing, along with a game Ida Lupino. Young talent includes hero Tom Skerritt and John Travolta, making his film debut as the devil's dolt.

Borgnine reportedly refused to do another movie involving satanism after supernatural goings-on during filming, but director Robert Fuest says diplomatically that he, um, hadn't heard anything about that. ""If you stop and analyze (the movie), you get into trouble,"" Fuest cautions. The director, a proper English gentleman, has some good tales to tell about this production and others.

""Rain"" was made with the ""special participation"" of Church of Satan founder Anton LaVey, who's seen marrying a lucky couple in a newsreel extra.",1163635200,5,854,5.318518518518519
278554,4,6300251969,"The Devil's Rain is one of those films that brings to mind that old saying, ""they sure don't make em like this anymore"".  It's true, they certainly don't.  This movie was one of those satanic 70s horror films, though more unintentionally amusing.  It's not an actual ""good"" movie like Rosemary's Baby, but wildly original and bizarre.  If the Exorcist was Jurassic Park, then The Devil's Rain would be The Land That Time Forgot.  Most likely to be enjoyed by B movie lovers as well as connoisseurs of classic forgotten horror films.  The plot is more or less Tom Skerritt and his brother, William Shatner, carrying out a generations-old battle with a group of satanists in a ghost town.  Since 95% of the film is shot in the ghost town, this must have saved money, money probably spent on the actors' salaries and the fx, which look rather impressive considering the time and budget.  It's actually hard to believe this film passed with a PG rating.  The subject matter alone is at least worth a PG-13, and the country was a tad more religious in the 70s than it is now.  Plus add the melting bodies(a scene that may not be a gorefest by today's standards, but makes the melting nazis in Raiders Of the Lost Ark look like child's play), and some eyeless satanists, and it's hard to believe you got a movie that shares the same rating with Flushed Away.  The MPAA were much cooler in the 70s, weren't they?  Anyhow, the film may not make your top ten, but it sure is a fun ride.  By the time you get to the scene where Ernest Borgnine appears from a rather silly explosion in full devil makeup and bellows, ""Who calls me from out of the pit?"", you know this is a fun film.  The picture's been touched up, but still looks a bit rough.  As for bonus features, all there really is, is a commentary.  Don't be fooled by the Anton Levay Newsreel footage bonus feature.  It's literally about 20 seconds long.  By the time you light up a smoke and kick back, the damn thing is over with.  No big deal though, after all we buy the dvd for the movie, right?  Give it a shot, Satan will thank you for it.",1162857600,16,2093,4.387012987012987
278555,5,6300251969,"This movie is so awful I love it. Think about it:

1) First of all, SHATNER VS. SATAN!!! Is the world really a better place if either of these guys wins?

2) Ernest Borgnine as the Devil!!! WWWWoah....

4) A young Tom Skerrit - the protagonist!!!

5) A veritable who's who of 70's stars backing up the main players.

6) Melting people, devil stuff, death and general destruction!!!

It's a hoot.

John Travolta is usually advertised as being in this movie, and he is-but if you didn't know it going in, you would never pick him out of the group of EYELESS DEMON WORSHIPPERS(!!!).

NOW, you would think that with a plot like this, and this level of tricked-out 70's talent, ""Devil's Rain"" Couldn't miss.

It sucks.

BUT- its suck is such a complete and perfect suck that it actually UN-SUCKS! Robert Persig said that sanity is round, like the globe, and if your nutty-butt keeps going in one direction you will eventually wind up sane.

This movie proves that theory.

[UPDATE] I've read a few comments of this review, and realised that I had a bit more to add. I LOVE horror films, and especially love horror films from the the 60's and 70's. The films of the 70's in particular had such an incredible level of nihilism, so often at the end of the film the bad guys won. ""Devil's Rain"" falls squarely into this category. I guess where I'm going with all this is that I love these films; true, they are often dark and depressing and full of silly magical thinking, but they are also novel and entertaining. I guess I was thinking that way when I wrote this review. In other words, if this film is your cup of tea, you already know it...",1134604800,80,1728,4.447619047619048
278556,4,6300251969,"Hell was hot in the 70's - I mean for Hollywood.  That meant that we moviegoers were often condemned to suffer wannabe movies that cashed in on the craze.  For every ""Excorcist"", we had several movies like ""The Sentinel"".  But ""Devil's Rain"", probably envisioned as one of the cash-ins, rises above the pack where ""The Rotten Review"" is concerned, earning immortal damnation in that circle of hell reserved for ""so-bad-it's good"" flicks.  Largely on the strength of Ernest Borgnine's performance as Corbis, the gleefully evil priest of Hell, ""Rain"" leaves a mark on your soul that can't be erased no matter how much holy water you sprinkle.

The story starts off with Corbis being executed by some torked off Puritans in 17th century America.  Before his end (and before you can say ""Witch hunt, Mr. Miller, I think not"") Corbis lays a solemn curse upon the Preston family - whom he correctly deduces betrayed him to the Puritans.  Fast-forwarding to modern times, we Corbis has risen with his flock - a zombified congregation of his followers.  To complete his plans of bringing his souls to Hell, Corbis needs both a book containing the blood-inscribed names of his followers, and ""The Devil's Rain"" itself - which we see looks like a 1970's portable TV tricked out by Satanists.  (The tube beams images of the souls of Corbis's condemned followers, and their please for salvation.)

Not much makes sense in this movie, but it's firmly anchored by Borgnine, with help from William Shatner as an unsuccessful challenger, and by the flick's now unforgettable climax.  ""The Devil's Rain"" is jovially bad 1970's horror and solid fun to the last scene.",1127952000,3,1649,4.9169675090252705

Well, it turns out they were right after all.
The cast makes this one look more like a Made-For-TV movie that somehow mistakenly made it to the big screen: William Shatner post-""Star Trek"", Ernest Borgnine before ""Airwolf"", John Travolta in a tiny non-speaking part somewhere around the time he broke into fame as Vinnie Barbarino on ""Welcome Back Kotter"", Eddie Albert post-""Green Acres"", and Tom Skerrit who guest-starred on many, many TV series, most notably including ""Kolchak: The Night Stalker"" (at right about this time) -- where he ironically played a Satan-worshipping politician.
Shatner's part in this movie is actually suprisingly small. Borgnine's acting is really bad, and overall the script never seems to really be getting anywhere. I found myself more bored than scared or entertained by this movie.

As for the DVD, the picture is widescreen and the colours are nice and bright, but the film is still quite dirty and scratched. This should have been fixed.
If you're interested in movies with a Satanic theme, I'd recommend ""The Omen"" series, ""The Sentinel"" or even ""End of Days"" instead of this one. Unless you are really, really desperate, I'd say pass on this one.",1088035200,6,1400,4.932203389830509

Notable for having both the High Priest and High Priestess of the Church of Satan - Anton and Diane LaVey, in bit parts. Their inclusion gives a true Satanic presence to this movie - they wrote that humor is important to Satanists. Anton was technical advisor, and you can see many of his influences, such as the trapezoid designs and the Satanic chants. Some of the Satanic designs used are beautiful and interesting. It was filmed in Durango, Mexico. The filming has interesting stories to it, such as Anton LaVey trying to teach chants to extras who did not speak English. As was his custom, Shatner did nothing to make friends with the cast, and one suspects they symbolically enjoyed his character's treatment in the film.

278622,5,6300251969,"Technical consultant & actor, Anton LaVey graces the film with his presence, & arcane knowledge of the occult, & the visage of his wife Diane at the time, dwells herein also. John Travolta, Eddie Albert, & Tom Skerritt also star, in this Satanic thriller about a cult of devil-worshippers haunting a ghost town.
Since the Dr. is the technical consultant, all magical text herein is from THE SATANIC BIBLE. Ernest Borgnine plays a most convincing Satan, with LaVey as, most appropriately, the High Priest.
William Shatner {yes, Capt. Kirk himself!} went where no man had gone before, plays the protagonist Mark Preston, whose bloodline is under the curse of Corbis {Ernest Borgnine}, because of his ancestors' betrayal of the group centuries before, & the subsequent loss of the Book of Souls, chronicling those who have sold their souls to Satan, which Corbis had been obsessively searching for ever since. The group was murdered by the pyre, much like the Knights Templar, but Corbis swore to rise again, his ""shadow covering the land again, & again.....""
Until the book is recovered, Corbis cannot manipulate & control the souls, or, free them to do his bidding, as they remain imprisoned in a beautifully ornate container, bearing the form of the Baphomet goat.
Then, Mark Preston's brother {Skerritt} teams up with a Parapsychologist {Eddie Albert} to retrieve his brother, & mother, from the clutches of the ""evil"" Corbis {""...Evil? There is no evil here. Only purity...""}
One of the more typically moronic actions done by the normals, was when Preston was talking with Corbis in one of the scenes, & reveals his insecurity & false heroism, as he proclaims that he'll ""face whatever lies behind those doors"" of that old church {wait until you see that altar!}, while parting open his jacket, & displaying a gun. Where's the ""faith""? Well, that made no difference, as you will see, neither did his pathetic, snivling prayers, or his god of weakness.
The Devil's Rain has quite a line-up, & quite a plot. It is thuroughly entertaining, & many of the effects, make-up, & prosthetics were advanced for that time, & continue to be fascinating today. Notice the undertone of black noise in some of the scenes.
This rare film remains as one of the more Satanically-inspirational, & influencial pieces of underground art. It has been featured a few times on Elvira's ""Movie Macabre"" show, but she unfortunately lacked perception on this one.
It IS so unique, because it features actual Satanic rituals & ceremonies that have been unearthed by Dr. LaVey. Every Satanist worth their sulphur will want to have this in their collection.",1084752000,6,2629,4.990888382687927
278623,5,6300251969,"Lots of fun, although sometimes confusing. The book explains it better.  Notable for having both the High Priest and High Priestess of the Church of Satan - Anton and Diane LaVey, in bit parts.  Their inclusion gives a true Satanic presence to this movie - they wrote that humor is important to Satanists.  Anton was technical advisor, and you can see many of his influences, such as the trapezoid designs and the Satanic chants. Some of the Satanic designs used are beautiful and interesting. It was filmed in Durango, Mexico.  The filming has interesting stories to it, such as Anton LaVey trying to teach the Latin chants to extras who did not speak English.  As has been told elsewhere, Shatner did nothing to make friends with the cast, and one suspects they symbolically enjoyed his character's treatment in the film.  Anyone who likes good old sci fi and horror or camp, should love this film.",1077840000,7,900,4.774193548387097
278624,4,6300251969,"Tom (Tom Skerritt) and his clairvoyant wife set out to find his brother Mark (William Shatner) who has vanished under bizarre circumstances. Ernest Borgnine is Corbis, the head honcho of a group of desert-dwelling satanists, who can channel lucifer and take on a goat-like appearance. It seems he's after a book full of the names of those whose souls were sworn to satan some 300 years earlier. Mark is eventually assimilated into the sect through a strange ""baptism"" ritual which leaves him eyeless (like the rest of the cult members) and Tom's wife is kidnapped. Tom must battle the entire cult (with the slight assistance of Eddie Albert) in an attempt to save his wife. The actual Devil's Rain is a weird goat-headed jar containing the souls of those in hell, trapped in a perpetual rainstorm. We get to watch, as the side of the jar is like a TV screen (hellevision?). Anyway, the jug gets smashed, causing the worst case of acid rain ever! The satanists begin melting into puddles of squishy goo! Corbis tries to push Tom into a pit, but is interrupted when his face starts sliding off. The whole thing ends in a wet, icky mess! Pretty decent as devil movies go, especially for 1975. Watch for a very silly looking John Travolta as Danny (another hooded, empty-eye-socketed face in the crowd) and Anton Lavay (the late high priest of the REAL church of satan) as the high priest of our little gaggle of goofballs. TDR is semi-cheese-tacular, but gets high marks for the prolonged, oozing death sequence...",1075680000,2,1511,4.770992366412214
278625,2,6300251969,"The Devil's Rain isn't a good film. So if you're a fan of the film and expect me to prattle on about how it's an undiscovered gem, you should read the next review. As a kid I didn't even find this film scary. I did find it absurd and a bad movie classic. It's a shame, really, as Robert Fuest directed a couple of really good horror films most notably the two horror satire Dr. Phibes films with Vincent Price. It's not all his fault, though, as he has a lot less to work with here.
Ernest Borgnine chews the scenery as the evil Corbis. He's been searching for his book (I suppose you could call it a book of blood) that has the names of his disciples written in their own blood. Being an evil guy, he does typical evil things. One of the evil things he doesn't do is write the ridiculous dialog he has to recite. When he possesses the book Corbis will be able to take the souls he has collected to Hell and please his master.
What's impressive is the cast that director Fuest was able to assemble. It must have been a very dry season for these Hollywood vets and newcomers. Tom Skerritt wouldn't be discovered by a wider audience until his breakthrough role in Alien. William Shatner was having a tough time of it (as he mentions himself in his autobiography). For a long time after Trek he wasn't able to find steady work. His performance is quite restrained and, actually, quite credible given some of the bombastic performances in other films. John Travolta had just begun to breakthrough on television and he was still a year away from his first major theatrical appearence in Brian DePalma's Carrie. The reason he's mentioned so prominently in the credits is that the film was finally released after his big break in that film and Saturday Night Fever. Ida Lupino and many of the other actors in this film had seen better roles and better days.
Ernest Borgnin clearly relishes his role as Corbin. Cast against type for a change, he plays a character with absolutely no redeeming value. What's refreshing about the film is the no holds barred performance he gives. Clearly he was happy to be working and could care less about the low budget stature of this film.
Fuest manages to create a couple of interesting set pieces in the film. The conclusion, though, is a complete mess (no pun intended). It's the Wicked Witch's worst nightmare come to life. The effects are passable for the mid-70's and the make up pretty decent (it's clear a large part of the budget went into the make up after looking at the sets). There's a general fatigue to the picture that undermines any chance of suspense. Couple that fact with a script that travels in tired cliches and you have an uninspiring mess of a movie. Director Fuest was a talented fellow but he didn't get much of a chance to make too many other theatrical films. It's really too bad as he proved with the Phibes films and Theater of Blood that, given the right material, he could create a memorable minor classic.
While the film isn't as incompetent as an Ed Wood epic (Fuest's professionalism and the actors involved prevented that from occurring), it's still quite a disaster and probably one film that isn't on most of these actor's filmographies.",1068249600,17,3204,4.554592720970537
278626,4,6300251969,"I actually enjoyed this movie, but I'm a fan of off-beat horror and I liked Fuest's Phibes movies.  The character development is slim to none, the plot pretty simple, and the makeup nothing spectacular, but I liked the unusual structure and pacing and thought many of the cult scenes were creepy and atmospheric.  The oddball way in which the story was told made what could have been another conventional drive-in movie rather unpredictable and a little unsettling.  Not to say that it's a great movie, but I think that creatively it's above-par for the genre and that many reviewers don't give it enough credit.",1054512000,2,612,4.865384615384615

So have you ever thought, ""What if the victims of the Salem Witch trials were actually guilty?"" Yeah I know, I haven't either, and it is the most meager element of ""The Devil's Rain"" but probably one of its best moments in terms of quality of camp.
I'll go ahead and say that this is one you should watch with friends to get a good laugh. Watching this alone was not great. It had its moments. The opening was exciting and funny. After that it takes a turn for the boring and was never scarry. I'll give credit to the fact that it took place in a ghost town that gave it a western horror vibe that was unique. The term ""vessel"" was used many times and I thought this was referring to William Shatner's character, whom oddly acted almost exactly like James T Kirk. The surprise to me was that it was actually referring to a macGuffin that housed the souls collected by the devil. While the movie was focused on Shatner's character it was actually pretty good, but that was given up for an infomercial on Satanism. There would be a Satanism craze in the eighties that horrified many parents so I'm sure this would have been perfect in that time but I'm not sure how it played in the 70's. In the middle of the movie came a look at the cult's existence during the Salem Witch Trials. I'm thinking that the film makers were assuming they had found a universal enemy to couch the cult to make them look cool. It really added very little and muddied the plot. Ultimately ""The Devil's Rain"" was aimless and confusing. It also didn't satisfy as camp as well as many other movies like ""The Room"" or ""Firestorm"" to name a few.
