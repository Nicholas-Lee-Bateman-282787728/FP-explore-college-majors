Demi Moore puts in a reasonably amusing performance as a single mom with a mute daughter, who will do anything to make ends meet, and the utter implausibility of the whole film makes me want to watch it over and over again for some reason.  I like the grittiness of this period piece, and to tell you the truth, I laughed out loud several times (although probably at all the wrong times and for all the wrong reasons)  I enjoyed this film for what it was; a decent piece of work with a lot of good character actors, an otherworldly quality that intrigued me, and some familier faces that I will never see together again, on this side of the veil. Hope this helps.",1072310400,5,809,4.26797385620915
343891,1,6301689984,"When Robert DeNiro is good, he's incredible. Sadly, DeNiro has made his share of clunkers too. This is one of them.",995673600,3,115,4.523809523809524
343892,3,6301689984,"Lighten up, film buffs; the 1989 version of We're No Angels may not be a great film, but that's because you're comparing it to other works made by these people, not to mention the 1955 version, which I haven't seen and so don't care about.  It's an amazing array of talent: Robert DeNiro, _the_ best actor of his generation; Sean Penn, one of the best of his; Ray MacAnally, one of the finest Irish actors of any generation; Neil Jordan, who went on to direct the greatest Irish movie to date, ""The Butcher Boy""; and David Mamet, who, well, writes great plays.  Personally I don't rate Mamet as a film-maker, except that he can turn out workmanlike scripts when called upon to do so, and he does so here.
The fact that this is probably the worst film that any of these people have ever been involved in is one of the things that makes it so entertaining.  When I saw it first, as a teenage drama student, I was somewhat perplexed by DeNiro's wincing, shrugging performance as the useless con who's forced to masquerade as a priest, but looking at it now I laugh my ears off.  His timing is actually very good, and while DeNiro has never been brilliant at comedy (Rupert Pupkin is the exception that proves the rule - Pupkin is so desperate to be funny that he's actually painful to watch) you can, if you watch this movie enough times, end up rooting for him.  He's so obviously telling himself ""Keep it light, Bob, this is meant to be a comedy"" that he gets a sympathy laugh, from me at any rate.
Sean Penn is actually very good, although I can't help wondering what this utter innocent could have done to have wound up in prison in the first place.  His sermon improvised from a Colt advertising flyer is a beautiful piece of acting.  Everybody likes to dump on Demi Moore because she got delusions of grandeur and started taking herself seriously, but here she has moments of real power and pathos, which work the more because it's based on a lightness that she hasn't really allowed herself for a long time since.
I mean, yeah, it's a preposterous movie.  But I still laugh aloud at it, if for the wrong reasons, and I'd rather watch it than probably anything by the Farrelly Brothers, if only because it's so...unguarded.  The Farrellys always know what they're doing; here it's as though everybody made a bad decision, and that makes them endearingly vulnerable for ninety minutes.  ""Go with God"", indeed.",974160000,15,2411,4.547344110854503
343893,4,6301689984,"I thought it was a good movie. It stands on its own, why spend time comparing to the 1955 original? It's got everyting: a good plot, lots of action, and DeNiro's facial gymnastics. Maybe it's not a classic, but it is  entertaining and even a bit uplifting.",962841600,11,256,4.446808510638298
343894,1,6301689984,"I have been a big fan of the original film starring Bogart, Ustinov, Ray and Rathbone, so I approached this with some trepidation.  But, I thought, how could DeNiro and Penn possibly fail when Mamet was involved?  Arrgggh!  This film ranks only second to ""Ishtar"".  The acting  is wooden, the writing is hackneyed and the direction misguided...and it  proved that Demi Moore wasn't an actress even 10 years ago let alone now.  Not one truly enjoyable moment in the whole production.  The cinemtography  is the only saving grace; a keen eye for space and composition.  This film  lacks soul and humor.  The two things that made the original so engaging  You would be better of spending your $ on the 1955 original.  There is  nothing better than watching Ray ogle the daughter of the shopkeeper,  Bogart selling a much-too-small suit or Ustinov pine for ""...the  delicious fat woman.""",946425600,4,883,4.858108108108108

343937,1,6301689984,"You know what? I used to be a huge DeNiro fan. I thought this was going to be cute because they were disguising themselves as priests. I thought maybe I'd see them both repenting and going to the Lord by the end of the flick. I don't know what I was thinking, but I didn't like this at all. Demi Moore was an overly proud and aggressive prostitute. DeNiro was about to buy favors from her at one point. Ew. The worst part of it though was that they said G___ D___  three times in the movie. Totally ruined. I could not finish this. It wasn't DeNiro or Penn who said the foul words, but three times? I don't take kindly to inappropriate use of the Lord's title.

343965,3,6301689984,"We're No Angels is a comedy that features Robert De Niro and Sean Penn together with Demi Moore,Bruno Kirby,Ray McAnally and James Russo. It tells the story of a couple of 1930's Great Depression-era convicts,Ned and Jim, that were able to escape prison and the death penalty via electric chair that was imposed on them. Both settle on a small upstate New York town near the Canadian border when both disguised themselves as a priests that were expected to arrive at a local monastery. A lot of comedic events happen afterwards especially when they were welcomed by Father Levesque and got involved with the deaf-mute daughter of Molly, a local laundress and prostitute. Neil Jordan directed this remake of the 1955 film of Humphrey Bogart with the same title.

Too bad that the film came out to be both simplistic and ordinary despite of the talent involved especially when it features De Niro and Penn,two of the best actors in Hollywood; and Jordan,one of the finest director of the industry. There were a lot of boring moments. Also,it just turned out to be somewhat corny and provides minimal laughter in a lot of scenes. Overall,it was definitely a misfire from the cast and the director involved as it does not live up to its potential.",1451174400,,1243,4.78139534883721

344075,2,6301689984,"I don't understand why this movie was named We're No Angels. I've seen the original Bogart film, and this film bears virtually no resemblance to it whatsoever. I could go through and break it down issue by issue, but the long and short of it is, the entire plot is completely different from start to finish. The characters are all entirely different, the story is entirely different, the setting is entirely different, the ending is entirely different. Literally the ONLY similarity between ""We're No Angels"" and this film is that both films have a theme of three escaped convicts pretending NOT to be escaped convicts. There isn't even consistency about whether they're pretending to be non-escaped convicts (as in the original) or pretending they're not convicts at all (as in this version).

Imagine someone made a movie they called a remake of ""Casablanca"" and the ""remake"" had totally different characters and a different plot entirely, and the only similarity were that the protagonist owned a club in Casablanca. Wouldn't that be outrageously inappropriate? Well, that's what this movie did.

Think about the movie ""12 Angry Men""--both versions are the same movie; one is actually a REMAKE of the other one, updated but essentially the same movie. Another example is ""Footloose""--the remake changed a few details (such as having Ren be from Boston instead of from Chicago) but was essentially the same movie, remade.

THIS movie, on the other hand, is NOT A REMAKE OF ANYTHING. It is a totally new movie that is trying to capitalize on an old Bogart film by stealing the title and a couple of thematic elements and ignoring everything else.

If THIS is a remake of ""We're No Angels"" then we may as well say ""Zack and Miri Make a Porno"" is a remake of ""When Harry Met Sally"" since both films (SPOILER ALERT) involve best friends realizing they're in love with one another.

This movie was not even very good, but the worst thing about it was that it tries to pretend it's a remake of an old Humphrey Bogart film. If you want to see a good remake of an old Bogart film, check out the Harrison Ford version of ""Sabrina""--it's as good, in its own way, as the original (and it stays true to the original while updating it for a different era).",1387238400,,2245,4.731457800511509

344168,4,6301689984,"Robert DeNiro and Sean Penn are 1920s-era convicts who are dragged along when a vicious killer escapes the electric chair. They end up in a town near the Canadian border, and are mistaken for a pair of priests expected at the local monastery.

So they masquerade as priests while looking for an opportunity to cross the border into Canada. An opportunity presents itself in the form of a procession/pilgrimage to the church's sister church across the border. Each priest participating has to bring along someone who needs help, so they decide on the deaf daughter of local laundress and prostitute, played by Demi Moore.

This version (there's a 1955 version, but there's no similarity between the movies at all) is billed as a comedy, but it's much more a drama, or maybe an allegory, though I don't have the time or inclination to delve into what it's an allegory for. There are humorous moments, to be sure, but it's not a laugh-aloud comedy at all.

It's about life-changing events, about miracles. We never do learn why DeNiro and Penn's characters were in prison to begin with, but we don't need to know. They begin as buddies, but the masquerade affects them in different ways. Penn's character thrives in the monastic life, despite, or maybe because of his ignorance. DeNiro and Moore's characters are world-weary and cynical, but they too are affected by the miraculous.

The movie leaves it up to the viewers to decide if the miracles are divine or human, but there's just enough mystery to allow you to believe if you want to.

We're No Angels leaves me with the same sort of feeling that Christmas movies like Miracle on 34th Street do--a kind of uplifted feeling, and a renewed faith in the human spirit. Or maybe I'm just feeling sappy.",1227312000,16,1750,4.762376237623762
344169,1,6301689984,"I bought this because I thought my family would enjoy seeing a newer version of ""We're No Angels"" after enjoying the 1955 Bogart version so much. (Great film!)  After previewing the Robert De Niro version last night, I threw it in the trash.  Demi Moore's partial nudity and language makes it inappropriate for family viewing.  The comedy was not done well enough to make me laugh even once.  Sean Penn's character was the only one that made me watch the film to the end; I wanted to see how he turned out.",1217894400,2,506,4.467391304347826

344204,3,6301689984,"Like most viewers (and the critics), I wasn't crazy about this buffoonish comedy when I first saw it in the '80s... but time has been kind to it. This remake of the Humphrey Bogart-Aldo Ray 1955 comedy-drama concerns escaped convicts (cut from three men, now two) who disguise themselves as priests and hide out in a bordertown, learning to love the residents if not their new vocations. Robert DeNiro mugs with a surprising vigor (his face seems to be made of rubber) and Sean Penn plays the dumb mug sidekick, and they're OK; but don't forget the supporting cast, which is excellent (particularly Demi Moore as a flooze and John C. Reilly as a seminarian). Production values are incredible (that entire town was built for the film) and there's a rousing climax involving a parade, a statue and a little girl (another great performance). Really not too bad, once you get over the shock of seeing two of our most intense, dramatic actors acting like two outta three stooges.",1127260800,6,974,4.769230769230769

344207,1,6301689984,"Save your money. Save your time. This movie makes Ishtar seem bearable. If you have not seen the original film of 'We're No Angels' - whose cast was better than this version's by the way, and the script far surpassed this dud, then find a copy of the original. It's got Humphrey Bogart and Peter Ustinov - two of the best reasons I know for watching a movie - along with the inimitably villainous Basil Rathbone and the bumbling likeable Leo G. Carroll (aka Mr. Waverly in 'The Man From U.N.C.L.E.'). Sean Penn left comedy behind with Ridgmont High and can't seem to find that magic again. Robert DeNiro is certainly capable of comedy but first he needs a truly funny script. Everyone has something they don't want on their resume, and I'd guess that for both actors it's this movie.",1099958400,10,783,4.560283687943262

344209,5,6301689984,"this is the big movie now; but this movie; maybe one needs to be Roman Catholic to totally get it and in that way; some might brace themselves for some sacrilege but it really is not so; it is a very spiritual movie; Penn and Deniro both put out top ranking performances; I watched it on USA network quite a few times before I knew the title of this movie and that some years prior, Humprhey Bogart made a movie with the same title but that the plots are not exactly a like. We see, some redemptions in this movie; Hoyt Axton writer of a song that had some swearing and that is the song ""The Pusher"" plays his role as Monsignor (or what ever precisely he was in the movie), absolutely devoutly, jovial (like an Irishman which he may well be) and perfectly; I believe, the order of Monks of which they are, are like Benedictines; the nostalgia of the movie is great, the humor, where Penn sees the sign reading some quotation from Galatians or similar; in saving their necks and getting a ride from an elderly lady, after they break out of prison.
Well, is that saying a lot? Didn't follow it?
Well; Sean Penn's role finds redemption in his role, iut is very inspirational; Hoyt Axton seems to find redemption in the role; the deaf girl daughter of Demi Moore, is certainly saved and redeemed; Demi as well; really, it seems that only Robt. Deniro's role, lacks the redemption and he seems to continue his scalawag ways;
Comedy, how grand on a scale, when, through miraculous ""God works in strange ways"" events, Demi Moore's daughter loses her status of deaf mute and the first thing she can say, is ""Convicts"" she recognizes Penn and Deniro as being the escaped convicts, but Deniro turns it around to that she said ""Converts"" and saves themselves there.
Deniro is worldly, Penn experiences a spiritual awakening; that ending could bring tears to the eyes of some, at least me; A+ plus plus is this movie for me.",1080691200,5,1912,4.512968299711815
344210,3,6301689984,"I have always found this movie to be entertaining.  This may not be a legendary movie, but it is a fun to watch.  It's first problem is that ""We're no Angles"" is a the name of a great movie from 1955, so it easy to expect more from this movie then it could ever deleaver.  De Niro and Penn talents make up for a simple script and turn it into a fun story. Demi Moore is dispointing as she provides little to the part of the prostute, yet Hoyt Axton does very well as the head of the monastery.
 Both men play excaped cons forced to make they way to Canada, but trapped at the boarder.  Un-educated and desperate, De Niro and Penn bluff their way into the local monatery.  An annual ceremony provide our two cons a way across the boarder, but the sheriff is closing in.
  ""We're No Angles"" is a good example of how great actors can save a movie.  De Niro and Penn both do that very well.  If you enjoy light comedy, De Niro or Penn; this movie is well worth your time.  It is nice to just enjoy a movie for the talents of its stars with out car chases, blood bathes. and all special effects.",1075075200,5,1090,4.09433962264151
