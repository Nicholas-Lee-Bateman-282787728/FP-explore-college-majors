Just remember this was 1975 - nearly 40 years ago and video basically did not exist and audio was scratchy vinyl discs.  It is fascinating to watch this with that mindset. This certainly reflects their rise to icon status as they hung in there writing and playing and never gave up. Marvelous to witness that raw power of theirs",1412985600,,452,4.445783132530121
8106938,5,B000E7AP86,"I watched this a few times. It starts slow and crummy!  But then it becomes so worthwhile! Sound improves, camera problems cease.. And I would say its probably more for die hards. Others may not want anything that is less than perfect. I enjoy the full-tilt historical significance. Before Mick even had his moves taught to him by TIna- among others, like Jerry Lee.. Cool.",1399161600,,373,4.7384615384615385
8106939,5,B000E7AP86,"When you consider how long ago this was, the picture quality & sound are actually good. With some picture adjustment to your TV, you can get this to look pretty good. And if you have a Home Theatre you can dial in a good sound. Add headphones and it's great. As for the band, it's at the height of their flambouyancy, addiction & decadence. But most importantly, It's the Rolling Stones in their PRIME. This is a must not just for Stones fans, but for rock and roll fans in general because it displays one of, if not THE best....in their prime.",1266019200,,544,4.3431372549019605
8106940,4,B000E7AP86,"I was preparing for the worst: bad sound and video but I am surprised at how good the sound is. The video does suffer from flaring which makes everything very indistinct from a distance. Also the camera crew have a Jagger fixation with very little close up action on the rest of the band (but not as bad as Ladies and Gentlemen 1972 tour when the cameras hardly ever pulled back to see the whole band playing at once). Generally I'm happy with the video quality of this bootleg.

The band is in great form abeit a bit sloppy in some places but hey this is rock'n'roll 1975; Keith is a junkie and hired gun Ronnie Wood fits in perfectly shredding it up in with some searing licks. Mick has entered his ""slurred lyrics"", camp phase but no matter, the energy he delivers is astonishing. The big highlight for me is Midnight Rambler which is the best version I've seen or heard. The following final numbers Rip This Joint, Street Fighting Man, Jumping Jack Flash and Sympathy For The Devil are balls out, brilliant rock'n'roll!

It was also magic to see songs rarely performed in concert like Fingerprint File and Heartbreaker.

It was great to finally see a 1975 tour show on DVD. I'll guarantee you'll get goosebumps during the ""Fanfare for the Common Man"" intro which grinds into Honky Tonk Woman.",1194307200,,1296,4.577586206896552
8106941,3,B000E7AP86,"All that the other reviewers here have said is SO true: shoddy quality, poor sound, etc - but still, to the best of my knowledge, this is the only pictorial, uh, ""remnant"" of the infamous '75 Stones tour.  You know this was the tour where they ""introduced"" Ron Wood as Mick Taylor's replacement (well..not in so many words), and, whew!, having Billy Preston manning the keyboards and Ollie Brown, his/the Stones' ""auxillary percussionist"" for the tour almost stole the show right out from under the Stones. And, yeah, they DO do ""Star-youknowwhat-er"" and the...the...um...""balloon"" pops out right after Keef's guitar
solo after the second verse.  But hey, 2 bills is a rediculous price to pay for this thing, it ain't worth it.  But, uh, ""have your people get in touch with my people..."" and we'll talk about it...",1151884800,,814,4.884057971014493
8106942,3,B000E7AP86,"I have always wanted to see footage from the 1975 tour.  This could have been a great DVD, except for the technical problems. The copy I received was rarely in sharp focus and the sound was not home theater worthy.  There was a lot of 'flaring' in the video. But, on the plus side, the footage is from multi-angles. (I'd like to know the history of this bootleg footage.) Hey, for the price, I fiddled around with my video controls, amped up the sharpness and took the brightness down until the 'flaring' disappeared.  Then I listened to it on headphones. Perfect. Man, you can really hear how sly and good Bill Wyman was.  He plays a 1950s bass line on 'Rip This Joint' that is out of this world.  It's good that you can hear Bill because they rarely take a shot of him! All in all it's worth it to finally see the lotus flower stage.  So, get this, but don't expect too much; you can only be pleasantly surprised.",1143936000,5,915,4.321637426900585
8106943,5,B000E7AP86,"By far, the best Stones DVD out there.

I have written about this DVD on my blog.

HERE: [...]

It is awesome!!!! And, a must have for any hardcore, Stones fan...

I mean, a GREAT version of Fingerprint File!!!!",1142899200,3,211,4.333333333333333
8106944,5,B000E7AP86,"when i ordered this item i was expecting the worst...fan shot  etc etc. i thought the sound and picture quality was going to be unacceptable but i took the risk anyway because i am such a huge stones fan....let me tellyou this is the best stones concert i have ever seen on dvd....picture this....the stones on tour 1975...in their prime 30 years ago....not yet a corporate band....billy preston playing with them...ron woods first tour....bill wyman still in the band....keith probably still on dope and he has a full head of hair..and mick never looked better. this blows away any of the dvds of the voodoo lounge and bridges tours or even the gimme shelter and ladies and geltleman movies. the sound quality is excellent and most of the picture quality is excellent (lighting off in a couple of places). anyway, i don't see how this is a fan shot film beacause there a multiple angle shots, upclose and faraway shots.*****this is a must have for any stones fan******",1141689600,7,969,4.767857142857143
