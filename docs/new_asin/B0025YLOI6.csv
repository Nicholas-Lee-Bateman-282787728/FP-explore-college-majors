8351420,4,B0025YLOI6,"This picture, known as Gunfight at Red Sands in America, is generally credited as the launch of the great years of revamped American western iconography via Italian cinema.  It stars ex-patriot American bodybuilder and sometimes star in Italian sword and sandal pictures, Richard Harrison, who always does a great job in his films.  The score is by none other than Ennio Morricone (under the pseudonym of Dan Savio --in the early westerns, pseudonyms were often used until critical acclaim made such posture unnecessary).  It is typical Morricone, unqiquely twanged Western with a euro-Italian operatic quality that helped make the Italian westerns so utterly new and entertaining.

The DVD is region free, widescreen 16:9 enhanced but it is in PAL so you will need a player that accommodates Eurpopean DVDs.  The original Italian soundtrack is default but you can select the official American release English dubbed track, though someone else is doing Hrrison's voice who is more a baritone than the deep tenor voice used here.

I had a great time watching and at long last I can see a picture that launched 1000 imitators.  By the way, it was Harrison who recommended Eastwood for the first Dollars film!",1319241600,,1206,5.0606060606060606
