7844024,5,6303355943,"i read the crucible and of course loved it, so then i got the movie from the library. it was so bad, i didn't bother finishing it. only a few of the actors deserve to be on camera, and some of them are really annoying. but anyway, my teacher said the french one was better, so i got that one too, and boy was he right. it wasn't just the play brought on screen. the movie starts way before the play, with john and abigail's affair, and his wife's discovery. the proctors also get much more time devoted to their relationship - the tension between them is very good.  the woman who plays elizabeth proctor is amazing, and while john proctor wasn't (in my opinion) quite handsome enough for the part, he was also very good. and abigail's role was perfectly cast. in fact, there was not one actor who bothered me.

the movie adds a lot that the play didn't have. as i said, it gets more into the protors' relationship and what elizabeth meant at the end when she said ""it was a cold house i kept."" Giles Corey's sons also make an appearance, trying to organize a rebellion at the end. oh, and the sets. the film is in black and white, and it perfectly captures an old puritan village. the clothing is plain enough and rough enough, the buildings fit in well, down to the rough sort of doorknobs. and there are scenes with john chopping wood or plowing.

basically the movie was awesome. and it wasn't just a reproduction, it stood on its own. (and it was nice hearing some French!) definitely the better Crucible movie.",1165795200,4,1516,4.387900355871886

Set in Salem, in 1692, during the ""witch hunts"" the film has many horrific moments, as well as heartbreaking. In watching this, I felt like I was watching the ""Exorcist"", as there are several scenes of possession. However this is all based on BELIEF, and shows what can happen when panic sweeps a community. This film recalls the early days of the McCarthy era, in this country. The kangaroo court, the innocent being imprisoned and hanged. My only complaint is the usual with sub-titled videos, they are too hard to read at times. However don't let that minor detail stop you from buying this!! The performances from the entire cast are red-hot and this is a video for your library!! Don't bother with the remake, when you can have the REAL THING!! A TRUE masterpiece of filmmaking at it's best!",969753600,6,990,4.898809523809524
