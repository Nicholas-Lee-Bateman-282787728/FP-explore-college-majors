3662799,5,B001JYT2Z0,"After watching Creative Breakout with my college-aged daughter, I immediately pulled my long neglected and dusty box of art supplies out of the garage.  Soon we were both painting on the same large canvas.  How wonderful that by sharing his insight and knowledge, Bill Buchman inspired us both!",1285545600,4,294,5.104166666666667
3662800,5,B001JYT2Z0,"Bill Buchman's Creative Breakout DVD slows down his own, unique creative process, a rare gift of generosity by a master, that students of any art form will appreciate. While Buchman encourages viewer students to practice spontaneity, reminding that the ability to be spontaneous and find an individual style requires practice and patience, he emphasizes that creating art should above all be fun. Buchman provides viewer students with the ins and outs of how to use a variety of unusual materials and techniques, explaining the role of colors, shapes, and other pertinent details as he works. Buchman gently reminds viewer students that he is always thinking, before and while he is creating, and that he is able to make ""good"" mistakes and educated, thoughtful guesses, because he has been practicing his art for many years. The ability to see areas of interest in a piece as it is developing, as well as the connections and organic development, takes time and persistence. As Buchman goes deeper into a composition, complicating the vision, he reminds student viewers that it takes risk to create an original, interesting piece of art. And his main message is to not be afraid. One great feature of the DVD is that student viewers can return time and again to sections of interest, running them in slowed down time. In addition, the wonderful jazz music, also written and performed by Buchman, is a perfect complement to the lessons. Pre order a copy of Buchman's new book on Amazon: Expressive Figure Drawing: New Materials, Concepts, and Techniques.",1284595200,6,1553,5.046692607003891
3662801,5,B001JYT2Z0,That last comment seems to have missed the whole point of this excellent DVD. I found it to be loaded with lots of inspiration and new ideas to try out. Actually I think it will be useful to art lovers of all persuasions.,1282608000,6,221,4.162790697674419
3662802,2,B001JYT2Z0,"I was rather disappointed in this DVD.  Too simplistic and amateurish. I was expecting more helpful and useful tips. Good for Middle School and below, but not for serious art lovers.

3662803,5,B001JYT2Z0,"Although this DVD is 90 minutes long, about the only thing that will stop you from watching it to the end is your desire to stop watching it and go paint!  Bill Buchman really delivers.  If you're interested in loosening up and enjoying painting, this is a must have DVD.  The product description provided by Amazon sets out what the DVD includes better than I can, but this DVD is definitely a bargain at twice the price.  (It should be noted that I did watch the entire DVD non-stop and didn't start painting until after I ordered Bill Buchman's other DVD, ""Art Is An Attitude: The Art of Drawing the Figure:  Essential Exercises"".  I am equally impressed with it.)",1266796800,10,667,4.563025210084033
3662804,5,B001JYT2Z0,"I agree with the comments left for this DVD.  At the end of this DVD, I was so inspired to go out and paint some of the techniques demonstrated on this DVD.  I must say, the DVD starts off real slow...I fast forwarded to the sections I really bought this DVD for and THEN I realized that fast forwarding had NOT been such a great idea.  I then went back to view the ""slow"" part and came out richer for it.

I learned so much.  I wish Creative Breakout, The Art of Freedom -- had a sequel.",1259452800,10,488,3.9896907216494846

3662807,5,B001JYT2Z0,"Compared to my previous experience with  art instruction  dvd's , this one really delivers.  Lots of good information about materials and techniques that were really new to me. Seeing how Bill works has encouraged me to be a lot braver. I definitely recommend this.",1232668800,15,265,4.9772727272727275

8314062,3,B001JYT2Z0,This DVD challenged many of my ideas and notions of what art is about. At first I was not sure if I liked  being challenged this way but after some time has passed I have realized this was probably a good thing. I  learned about lot of stuff I was never shown when I was in art school.,1334534400,3,285,3.896551724137931
8314063,5,B001JYT2Z0,"Bill Buchman is an exceptional instructor if you wish to tap into your unique creativity and paint in a loose and expressive style.  Unlike most art instruction, this video gives you tangible ways to explore making art.  It encourages the artist to freely create.  While those who want to paint realistic, traditional art may not appreciate the lessons, for anyone who is looking to break out of the traditional, these exercises are the ticket.  Work along with Bill, and you will see wonderful new art explode from your paper!",1333756800,3,527,4.887640449438202
8314064,5,B001JYT2Z0,"""I loved the Creative Breakout video.  I learned many new and innovative painting techniques and how to successfully mix media.  My work is fresher and more exciting now.  Mary Ann MacL""",1332633600,4,186,4.935483870967742
8314065,5,B001JYT2Z0,"Bill Buchman is an amazing artist. The instructions and information on his videos make you believe that the ""language of art"" and ""keeping the melody"" are within reach of all serious aspiring artists.",1331596800,2,200,5.090909090909091
8314066,5,B001JYT2Z0,"If you're tired of painting the same old landscapes and flowers, and want to learn about the world of abstract art, you will love this DVD. Mr Buchman shows some wonderful approaches to painting that will loosen you up and change your attitude. It changed my approach to painting and gave me more confidence, whether I'm painting an abstract or a landscape.",1331424000,3,357,4.774193548387097
8314067,1,B001JYT2Z0,Not sure why anyone would rate this anything above a 1 star.  It has elementary school age information.  I fast forwarded it after a few minutes to see if it went past such simple stuff but it did not. If I had paid $6.99 instead of $29 for it I wouldn't be so hard on it.  Its a waste of money.,1327449600,2,295,3.80327868852459
8314068,1,B001JYT2Z0,"Such a waste of time and money. I should have heeded the warnings of the previous reviewers who said they had to fast forward this dvd. Anytime there is a need to fast forward a dvd, that should have been a clue for me. The title is misleading. This dvd should be called how to put a mark on paper 101. Or how fast can you fast forward on your dvd. He starts out showing you how to make lines on paper with various medium. Then with sumi brushes he dips the brushes in the ink and throws the ink on the paper. Then for the duration of the dvd you watch him draw more lines on paper. I fast forwarded several times throughout  this dvd.  Don't waste your time or money. I didn't find any inspiration in this dvd.",1326758400,3,711,4.071428571428571
8314069,5,B001JYT2Z0,"For anyone who is interested in more than copying what they see, and has a desire to learn the art of finding their own style, a great way to do it would be to revisit exercises in personal freedom through the artistic process like the ones Mr. Buchman shows us on this DVD.  No one has said it better than Oscar Wilde, so I will quote him here:  ""It is style that makes you believe a thing - nothing but style.  Most of our modern painters are doomed to absolute oblivion.  They never paint what they see - they paint what the public sees and the public never sees anything.""",1303776000,6,576,4.209090909090909
8314070,3,B001JYT2Z0,"Not the thing I was looking for. I do not know if it is just me or not but I am dislexic
which really has a lot to do with it too I think. Anyways. I was in the market for art
instruction since I also have two kids. I want to know how to paint flowers but this is
about something way different although it looks like fun.",1287273600,,321,3.6666666666666665
