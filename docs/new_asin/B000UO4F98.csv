2923386,3,B000UO4F98,"I'm a huge William Petersen fan so when I found this item I snapped it up.  (Be careful - this film has 2 other titles:  Curacao and Deadly Currents.)  Despite the fact that it has some decent actors involved, this movie just never gets off the ground.  It's so slow it creeps along with an overacting George C. Scott and Dennis Christopher.  The action is minimal but, for those who are interested, there are 2 brief nude scenes of Mr. Petersen that are worthwhile.  Other than that, I it's an okay film but nothing more.",1267401600,2,522,4.442105263157894
2923387,3,B000UO4F98,"I like to try new movies, just something different.  I liked this movie, but it isn't a great movie.  The actors were likable enough and performed well.  I had never imagined George C. Scott in such a role as the restraunt owner whose past comes back to haunt him.  William Petersen plays an ex-CIA agent who is exiled to Caracau because he took the life of a fellow agent who was a traitor.  In the process of the story, he is laiden with Scott's problems and has to sort them out. Being a hero, he reluctantely does so.  An old flame and CIA agent enters the picture because of his discontent to watch over him.  She winds up protecting him from ""the powers that be.""

Like I said it isn't a great movie but if you need some entertainment this might work for you.  Would I recommend it?  I'm still trying to decide.

O, this  movie is rated ""R"", but there is very little foul language, one sex scene and one but-shot of Petersen's rear end.  He does have a nice rear end.",1244160000,2,973,4.251366120218579
2923388,1,B000UO4F98,I was disappointed in William Peterson's performance.  As for George C. Scott...was he getting desperate for movie scripts at the end of his life? Definitely a low budget movie.,1222646400,,177,5.103448275862069
2923389,4,B000UO4F98,"this is one of his better flicks.  I loved his character and George C. Scott is terrific too.  The artwork on the box is a little misleading, as the only nudity in the movie is Billy!",1210204800,,183,4.055555555555555
2923390,5,B000UO4F98,"I have had this film on vhs for a long time and am glad to finally get it on dvd.
 This is William Petersen at his best and has a lot of twists and turns to keep the viewer interested. The film has also been titled "" Deadly Currents "" and "" Curacao "" and also gives George C Scott a role that is different than what he is usually seen doing.
 This is a film of espionage and yes a little sex is included but don't let that stop you for you will be guessing about all the charactors throughout the film and it does have it's humour as well.",1193616000,13,539,3.8468468468468466

8214095,5,B000UO4F98,"Most of the reviews of this movie missed the mark by a few miles - and the cover art doesn't help.  If your interest runs strictly to action and adventure, you'll rate this film a 2 or 3 when it's over. If your approach is a bit more cerebral, you'll appreciate the ambience, the tempo, and the treatment of a weak man's (Scott's) need for redemption - though it seems utterly beyond his grasp. I enjoyed it.",1377302400,2,408,4.298701298701299
