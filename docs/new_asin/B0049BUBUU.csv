8418955,3,B0049BUBUU,"College graduate in Canada has been unable to find anything he is passionate about (slacker?) so he comes upon the idea of working a job for a week for 52 weeks (What? No vacation?) in which the businesses he...visits/works at donates his salary to charity (because really, what good is he going to do there for a week of training. He meet a girl and cannot even get passionate about her. Surreal.",1480723200,,397,4.527777777777778

8418959,2,B0049BUBUU,"Good idea, but not enough detail is given about each job to make this a truly interesting documentary. There is also a romantic sub-plot which cheapens the overall purpose of the movie.",1430956800,,185,4.8125
8418960,3,B0049BUBUU,"This is a very agreeable documentary, and as some of the other reviewers have mentioned, it would be absolutely ideal to show a high school student.  Unfortunately, it may be a little too light for adult consumption.  (And I don't just mean the length of the film, which clocks in at a little over 70 minutes.)

The protagonist, Sean Aiken, is exceptionally likable and compelling, but the very nature of his quest (which was to take 52 jobs -- one each week -- over the course of a year) made it impossible to gain any in-depth perspective on any of his individual jobs.  Aiken also didn't gain sponsorship until the second week of his journey, which is particularly unfortunate, because he was probably at his most vulnerable and frightened during his first few days away from home.  But my biggest complaint is the romance angle, which seemed utterly unnecessary to the program.  It was difficult enough to provide meaningful coverage of all of the jobs that Sean was doing, so spending time on his relationship with his girlfriend back home only detracted from the journey.

I always find it compelling to watch a young person chasing his or her dreams, and I feel like I would have loved this project had it been a television show.  It's easy to envision a cable program akin to Dirty Jobs, lasting 26 weeks, covering two jobs per episode -- that would have been amazing.  Unfortunately, we only get a shallow scoop of everything.  We get a little bit of Sean; a tiny morsel of his relationships with his girlfriend, his assistant, and his family; a little piece of each job.  I'm aware that this same material is available in book form for those of us who are interested in a bit more depth.  I'm eager to pick it up.  If you already enjoy the book, I'm confident that this documentary would be wonderful as supplementary material.  But on its own, the DVD just doesn't offer quite enough to make it worthwhile.",1421020800,,1917,4.633136094674557
8418961,5,B0049BUBUU,I use this video with my Career Planning unit with my 8th graders and they really seem to like it.  SEan is very likeable and presents the jobs in a way the 8th graders can understand.,1366502400,,184,4.111111111111111
8418962,4,B0049BUBUU,"The idea is original, it gives material to think about  our passions and  how to pursue them. I wish it had more production and  a solid conclusion",1361750400,,147,4.37037037037037
8418963,5,B0049BUBUU,"The concept of this documentary is great -- Do a job a week for a year to help determine what it is that you want to do (work-wise) for the rest of your life.

Barring those few who inherit a large enough sum of $$$ to never have to work in their life, most of us are stuck working... and working for many, MANY years of our life.

If you're going to be spending soo much of your life working, you should find what you enjoy doing.

While the documentary doesn't tell me what *I* would enjoy, it's inspiring to watch -- wish I had watched this when I was younger to help guide my career choice -- specifically to not limit myself to a specific track (that I didn't know much about) and become somewhat locked-in.

Of course, most young people ""know everything"" already...  Even so, I would highly recommend anyone in high-school (and even in college) to watch this.",1308355200,7,865,4.3478260869565215
