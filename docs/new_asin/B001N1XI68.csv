8322841,5,B001N1XI68,"A sleek steel DVD case contains this classic, creepy film making this edition a must for X-Files fans.  Rounded edges compliment the shadow logo cover artwork while the back paper artwork can be carefully peeled off and fastened inside, protecting the artwork and print giving this article a small steel box look.  This gem is a stand alone collectible resembling an alien artifact or a piece of steel that may have jolted loose from a low flying UFO.  I WANT TO BELIEVE this may be the vessel to lure Deep Throat and The Lone Gunmen back into out realm!!",1457568000,,555,4.585858585858586
8322842,5,B001N1XI68,"Much like the first theatrical outing for Mulder and Scully, this will disappoint some for what it is not, and others for what it actually is. It is very much the type of stand-alone story which used to be squeezed between the conspiracy and mythology episodes. The problem presented by the avenue chosen by Chris Carter and Frank Spotnitz is that after so many years have passed, fans aching for what The X-Files did best will be confronted by a dreary and snowy low-key and intimate story which while excellent on its own, is not what fans had anticipated.

That being said, I do believe, however, after the initial shock, and perhaps after a second viewing, at home, fans will embrace it for Carter's courage to once again fly in the face of the powers that be and tell an often creepy stand-alone story showing how the darkness always found Mulder and Scully, and how it was having each other to lean on which helped each keep their faith. It is almost as if this is a segue to something more on the horizon. For even within the confines of a story which does not deal in the slightest manner with any of the X-Files mythology fans have hungered for, there are portents.

Beginning with both Mulder and Scully leading very different lives than those we came to know, Carter uses the darkness to bring them back together. It is a kidnapped F.B.I. Agent and a Bureau ready to forgive Mulder for his many indiscretions if only he will help work with the psychic who may or may not be genuine which starts things rolling. Scully's need to help a young boy with an incurable disease and the relationship of our favorite F.B.I. couple, even though neither works for the Bureau anymore, gets as much screen time as the premise, which is like a creepy episode rather than a feature film.

Duchovny and Anderson are still fabulous together, perhaps even more so in a somber and low-key outing such as this. The intimacy and history of the couple is what the film is about, and how faith can be restored even amidst the darkness which always found them, and sometimes kept them apart. This really plays better as a small screen episode of the show, and because we fans have missed Mulder and Scully for so long, it gets an A.

There are references to Mulder's sister, the alien abduction which haunted and drove him in his quest for the truth. It is a story line we thought wrapped up. Now that is unclear. Carter did say in an interview about the film that no one ever really dies for good on the show. And though the film itself has dealt in absolutely no way at all with X-Files mythology, what should show up as a background to the closing credits? Black oil, that's what. And it ain't Texas tea. It is worth seeing if only for a very touching and tender moment between Mulder and Scully near the end. It is the kind of intimate conversation which made the show better than anything else we got to watch during its long run.

The story itself might have been better as an episode of the show, and those who ventured into theatres expecting something grandiose after all this time were disappointed. Fans of the show, however, were fans because of the relationship between Fox Mulder and Dana Scully. So if you love that sort of episode, in which the case is only an excuse to bring them back to who they were, then you'll enjoy it much more. It has much more in common with ""Beyond the Sea"" or ""Irresistible"" than say, ""Nesei"" and ""731.""

I have this three disc version, and this one has the added bonus of the special packaging. Fans of The X-Files will gobble this up, to show support, so we can get another one, and those who were disappointed theatrically, might find it is much better than they realized once they give it a try at home.",1243209600,5,3739,4.475073313782991
