2516813,3,B000EDWLGO,"Joe Bonamassa is one of the great inspirations in blues guitar these days carrying the tourch for SRV and others who have gone. That being said this is just you watching Joe show you his Stuff Amps, Guitars, Effects Boxes.
But what i really wanted to learn was some of his technique and lead examples. This dvd has a VERY short section on soloing as to be almost non existent.
If you have watched his other concert dvd(live at rockplast) you know that he has a huge arsenal of riff's and cool turnarounds that he could be sharing with asspiring guitar players and none of that is apparent in this dvd at all.
So you are left with Joe firering off leads while explaining the virtues of the Strat,Tele,Lespaul but no-way to learn any of the rapid fire shots he has just played. Its truly maddening.
I did purchase a Reverend Drive Train overdrive pedal on Ebay that he was glowing over however so some good did come of this dvd but not enough to change my mind about giving this 3 stars.",1194825600,7,985,4.387978142076503
2516814,5,B000EDWLGO,"Joe has a really sound gameplan eversince i re-discovered my Blues passion through Joe Bonamassa this millenium.
I too unlike most teenagers of early 70's listened to The likes of Rod Stuart,Gary Moore,B B King and all the best of 'em.
Joe has got it all in his bag and with this his latest album (cd)Sloe Gin Joe has masterfully re-defined sensitivity and Soul with his voice and guitar playing.
I rate this five stars but probably i am biased.......;Hey Joe where goin' with that guitar in your hand....
On Fire!!!!I am gonna see this guy live at every opportunity too.

2516815,5,B000EDWLGO,"This Guy can Play,  If you enjoy the clasic metal rock blues ,like Zeppelin, Skynard, SRV and Clapton then you will enjoy Joe. He's got a  good voice for the Blues, And this Kat can play the guitar. He has the feel for the Blues  You will enjoy this DVD",1185840000,2,253,4.02
2516816,5,B000EDWLGO,"This is for people that play guitars.  He shows the uses of fenders and other makes of guitars, how to play each guitar, how to change amps and what amps to use.  It is a technical DVD and really good for people that play music.  I don't play a guitar but loved the sounds like Violin he created using a guitar. He is certainly a master of the guitar - he can play like Eric Clapton, SRV and Jimmi Hendix.  Worth buying this DVD.  Gave me an insight into the complexities of playing a guitar properly.",1168473600,3,501,4.177083333333333
2516817,3,B000EDWLGO,"This dvd is great for those fans of Bonamassa that want to know what effects and amps he uses. He also has a great breakdown on how to play gibson and fender guitars, and how to get a alot of different sounds from them.",1168387200,3,219,4.0
2516818,5,B000EDWLGO,"I have to start by saying what this DVD is not, rather than what it is. It is NOT a true instructional DVD and it is NOT a concert DVD. That said, it IS a good view into Joe's toy box and some of his techniques. Many of them are standards that an intermediate to advanced player already knows how to do (even you they have not mastered them) such as volume swells, and vibrato technique. It is truely just an introduction with very little detail. If you are looking for a ""step-by-step"" instruction, this DVD is not for you.

I found it both entertaining and informative. He addresses simple things like pickup selection and muting, as well as a tour of his pedal board and his amps and miking techniques.

Again, a LOT of detail is left out, but I think that is the point. Joe gives you enough information (in most instances) to sort out how YOU want to use this information in YOUR tone. It is not intended to show you how to imitate Joe Bonamassa in every way. It DOES give you information that you can use to improve your sound and that is what it is all about, is it not?

2516819,5,B000EDWLGO,"Not being a guitar player but a fan of Joe's this is an interesting concept for an instructional DVD. This deals with how Joe B gets his live sound. If you have ever seen him live this explains how he achives that bigger than life sonic barrage you hear. He strips away all the percieved smoke and mirrors that people assume he uses to achive that sound and explains the effects and amps that he uses. He also explains how he gets a variety of sounds simply by adjusting tone controls and picking techniques. After his straightforward explanation of his theories behind tone and his demonstrations you quickly find out that it is ""all in his hands"".",1143936000,8,649,4.555555555555555
2516820,5,B000EDWLGO,"This DVD takes a good look at young blues star Joe Bonamassa and his rock-blues style.  Covering everything from his playing to his gear, this is a must have for any fan of him or even just the blues.",1142899200,5,200,4.128205128205129
8108603,2,B000EDWLGO,"First, I'm a huge JB fan.  This is a fun video of Joe discussing guitars and his playing some years back, but it's not an educational lesson on blues/rock guitar, or a ""how to"" video on Joe's technique and music.  As an intermediate guitarist, I was disappointed to find the discussion either ridiculously simple (""This is a Stratocaster.... vibrato is important..."") or like a drive-by shooting (Joe casually demonstrates a lightening fast sequence up and down the neck while pulling off a series of inversions).  You're better off buying ""Joe Bonamassa Legendary Licks: An Inside Look at the Guitar Style of Joe Bonamassa"" which is a much deeper breakdown of his playing.",1520380800,,673,4.991071428571429

8108605,3,B000EDWLGO,"It's mostly a ""here's my gear and these are some of the tips and tricks that I use while playing on a Strat vs. a Tele vs. a Les Paul. Not much on how he thinks and approaches phrasing. If this is the intention of the DVD, then it was successful. I was looking for something a bit more about Joe's playing than his gear.",1503360000,,320,3.9384615384615387

8108608,4,B000EDWLGO,"A good video of Joe demonstrating his rig at the time. It was already dated when I bought this, as Joe's setup changes often. Great for Bonamassa fans. Also for fans, check out Joe's album, Rock Candy Funk Party, ""We Want Groove"", my current ""all time favorite album."" Infectious and great, great fun!",1364515200,,301,4.69811320754717
8108609,5,B000EDWLGO,"It is great to see how Joe demonstrates so mmany aspects of playing with such professionalism. Every guitar player should be listening to Joe, no matter what age or style you play.",1358380800,,180,4.65625
8108610,5,B000EDWLGO,Very informative dvd. The things that Joe plays while demoing his equipment and effects is worth the price of the video ten times over!,1307318400,3,135,4.666666666666667
8108611,1,B000EDWLGO,"With a title of Signature Sounds, Styles & Techniques you might think Joe breaks down some of his licks, signature riffs but no
The title does not reflect what is on the dvd, if you want to watch Joe play a few different guitars and his approach playing them
It's good, as for anything else you don't even get to see his amp/pedal settings when he talks about his gear. So if you expect a instructional style dvd don't buy it you will be as disappointed as I was.",1303603200,5,463,4.213483146067416
8108612,5,B000EDWLGO,"This is not a ""Learn Every Lick"" tutorial type guitar DVD. This DVD will show you some of the many techniques used by Joe Bonamassa. Joe sits down and shares his expertise in guitar tone and phrasing, his uses of different guitars and pickups, and how he sets up his audio equipment for a show. Joe Bonamassa is brilliant and eloquent (in speech and guitar play). Do yourself a favor and take a look at this one.",1302912000,2,412,4.363636363636363
