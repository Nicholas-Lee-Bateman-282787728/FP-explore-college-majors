8592917,5,B00DGBAEN8,"Excellent explaining.  Cool moves of a more traditional martial arts style.

Later after getting this DVD I actually met this guy in real life.  Really great guy, excellent teacher, and always so encouraging.  He is phenomenal and even more versatile than this DVD portraits.  There are no editing tricks, he is really that good.  Truly a rope dart master.",1513296000,,356,4.9491525423728815
8592918,5,B00DGBAEN8,l purchased this DVD over a year ago. It took me several months of training several times a week to learn all of the moves on this DVD. It is well explained and informative.,1474934400,,173,4.117647058823529
8592919,5,B00DGBAEN8,"This DVD is actually pretty good.  The instructor is great and the break down/teaching of techniques goes above and beyond expectation.  I would recommend this to anyone who wants to get beyond the basics.  I wish it had a form but no big deal.  All in all, two thumbs up.
