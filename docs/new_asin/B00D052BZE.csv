8588085,1,B00D052BZE,"I can not go along with the message that states during their concert about,' smoke more marijuana,' or the use of profanity.  I am not going to be accused of condoning the use of illegal drugs or the prejudice that surrounds the groups that use illegal drugs.  I have been around long enough to know that I do not want any prejudice that could effect me in ways that I do not want.",1476921600,,381,4.205479452054795

8588087,2,B00D052BZE,"No 24 bit audio, no DTS, no TrueHD, no surround, just 2 channel 16/48 pcm.
There is no problem with the sound, there just isn't anything Blu-ray about it.
There is a 3 disc version with 2 cds and 1 dvd for less money that would make more sense to buy since this is basically just the dvd transferred to a blu-ray disc. Yes this video is higher quality but who cares, it's a music blu-ray and music should be its priority. I suppose you could get this if you want to see Al's pores up close and crystal clear.",1387497600,5,508,4.09
8588088,5,B00D052BZE,"A fitting tribute to guitarist Mike Scaccia (who died December 23, 2012), by Al Jourgensen, his best friend and Ministry founder.  This DVD is incredibly good.  Ministry never disappoints, and this concert lives up to the high expectations held by Jourgensen and his fans.",1380844800,4,272,5.159090909090909
