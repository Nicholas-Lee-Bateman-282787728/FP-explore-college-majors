4888109,5,B005T5OBO2,Nicely produced product. I've purchased many rockabilly lessons and this one is in the top three. You get a broad range of rockabilly licks in this. Riffs are slowed down and explained.,1361491200,6,185,4.8125
4888110,5,B005T5OBO2,"I am an experienced guitar player and I have many instructional books and DVDs in my collection.  This is by far one of the best you can get.  There are limited resources for learning rockabilly guitar which is a difficult style to master.  This DVD is best for intermediate players, but beginners can also benefit from it.  It provides you with a link to get the tabs, backing tracks and information about the player whose style each lick is based on.",1361145600,11,452,4.54320987654321
4888111,5,B005T5OBO2,"I've had this for awhile and have enjoyed it. Nice variety, well presented, fun stuff to practice. Jason demonstrates a variety of different artist's styles. Recommend.",1359417600,,168,5.5
4888112,5,B005T5OBO2,"I found this great and was suited my style of playing. Licks were explained precicesly without going into too much detail.
If you like ""Real Rock n Roll"", not that noisy newage stuff, then this is for you.",1355875200,3,205,4.421052631578948
4888113,5,B005T5OBO2,"First want to start by saying I am reviewing the downloaded version.  I assume the DVD contains the same content.  What's great about this DVD is that it not only has video of the licks but also tab in PDF form.  This video runs through 50 essential rockabilly licks that range from Travis Picking/Scottie Moore type of licks to Carl Perkins, Cliff Gallup, Hank Garland, and Grady Martin licks.  Some of the licks have a slight twist and some pretty much exactly replicate the original licks. There also is a bit of rockabilly country twang licks and even some western swing.  Jason Loughlin is obviously well schooled in rockabilly and western swing even if he goofs up and says in the first video that Cliff Gallup was a member of the Johnny Burnette trio.  He also is great guitarist and teacher. He plays every licks at full speed and half speed and demonstrates clearly every note of the lick.  He also describes the music theory behind pretty much every lick.  This is one of the better rockabilly courses out there and well worth the money and I would definitely pick up a volume 2 if it was available.  Note for sake of completeness there are a few minor errors in the tab but not anything that you can't easily pick up otherwise from the video.",1324080000,16,1253,4.533333333333333
4888114,5,B005T5OBO2,"I purchased a Brian Setzer DVD, hoping he would break down some licks from different songs, but he just did an improvised session, off the cuff, without too much instruction. I loved hearing him play, but I couldn't touch it. Not so with Jason Loughlin's 50 Rockabilly licks. He selects licks from a wide range of sources, showing, for a young guy, a great awareness of the originating Rockabilly greats. He's picked out some licks that are rudimentary, which is always a good way to start, and progresses to some great boogie, swing licks that are really little exercises to instantly improve your repertoire. I'm 61 years old and still trying to master my favorite style of guitar music. This DVD helps.",1426377600,8,705,4.786885245901639
4888115,5,B005T5OBO2,Really like this and have been using some . Thought it was well explained and thorough .,1426118400,,88,4.235294117647059

4888117,5,B005T5OBO2,"I bought this and learned a good dozen licks or so when I first started getting into rockabilly and psychobilly. The more I learn about great rockabilly artists the more I appreciate the licks in this DVD and go back to it. It'll give you a piece of all sorts of great classics and this cat's style just made it easy for me to pick up. I'm an intermediate player with better than average finger picking abilities going into this so maybe his style of teaching just works for my style of learning but it seems effortless. This style of playing isn't for everyone. If you take to it you might end up buying a tele and a hollow body like I did, so beware. This isn't for the Steve Vai's of the world who play with themselves to the sound of practicing arpeggios, it's for real hellcats that play real music.",1420761600,2,804,4.296052631578948
4888118,5,B005T5OBO2,"Very useful licks for rock, blues, and country guitarists. I actually took away some Johnny Winter and SRV ideas from this DVD. The licks are painstakingly broken down and executed at a slow pace. The explanations require you to be a bit conversant in music theory and know the notes on the fretboard; but the demonstrations are so good that an advanced beginner without theory should be able to get the riffs under their fingers. This is the best of the ""50 Licks"" series and I have several of the DVDs. A must-have for any guitarist's instructional library.",1420502400,4,559,4.714285714285714
4888119,5,B005T5OBO2,As promised - no matter what your style you will find what you need on this.,1418515200,,76,3.8125
4888120,4,B005T5OBO2,"I always wanted to delve deeper into rockabilly style guitar, but struggled a bit to find the right licks and tonality. Jason Loughlin offers a nice build-up starting with a very easy basis and building up to more difficult things (like Psychobilly Frenzy by Reverend Horton Heat). I appreciated that he does not just offer some licks, but shows how they are built upon scales and chord forms. And he also does a good job breaking it down to intros, picking style and base driven mids, solos and typical endings.",1395705600,3,512,4.7
4888121,5,B005T5OBO2,"As soon as instructor Jason Loughlin gets started, you know you are seeing and hearing authentic, funky rockabilly guitar just as it was played by the masters back in the Fifties.  Download notation in tab from proprietary internet site.  Good indexing so you can easily repeat a lick till you get it.  Makes me want to get out my Tele right now.  Travis picking, double stops, bending, major and minor shuffles, chord substitutions, and plenty more.  Glad I bought it.",1389052800,3,469,4.8125
4888122,4,B005T5OBO2,"Very good, thou would have preferred him not to have given a commentary before each as would have been quicker
To back track to start of chapter.

4888123,5,B005T5OBO2,"I love this dvd. Such a brilliant resource. I far prefer it to the other guitar dvds I have bought over the years. I highly recommend this dvd - the instructor and the content are first rate. Buy it, regardless of whether you like rockabilly or not. It'll take your playing to a whole other place.",1362268800,5,297,4.321428571428571
8485845,5,B005T5OBO2,Good teacher. Working through the content slowly.,1509494400,,49,6.142857142857143

8485847,4,B005T5OBO2,A little tricky getting the on-line content but the folks on the phone were patient and helpful. Good collection of licks. Made me want more content but it's a good start for what I wanted. Worth every penny.,1472601600,,208,4.5
8485848,3,B005T5OBO2,"the vendor/ book seller was great,.. the DVD is a challenge to access as you have to set up an account and register the program.. seems as if the Truefire site needed to access the learning info will work MUCH better when ordering thru Truefire instead of a 3 party seller.. have not had much success using the package but will try again as I get time to 'work thru the issues'..",1468713600,,379,4.277777777777778

8485850,5,B005T5OBO2,My husband loves this and in 1 day has already on #11. It shows it several different ways plus slows things down for you. It comes with downloadable extras like the backing tracks and sheet music for all 50 songs! It really lets the visual learner see and then play each lick. My husband doesn't read music so he really loves this dvd. It shows many popular songs and helps him play better.,1455667200,2,390,4.3561643835616435
8485851,5,B005T5OBO2,Jason makes Rockabilly so much easier w/out getting one bogged down in theories and his teaching technique is very straight-forward/understandable.  I love the tech support I got not long after having rec'd the dvd.  The tech person was able to help me print the 50 lessons in no time leading to instant application of Jason's methods.,1453420800,,335,4.964285714285714
