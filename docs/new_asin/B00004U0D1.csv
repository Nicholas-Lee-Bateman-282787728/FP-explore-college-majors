7923296,5,B00004U0D1,"This is a great volume episode 9 is one of the best of the series. It is about the snow dredging up memories of Tenhci's late Mother. The other 2 episodes on this volume are good too. In episode 8 Washu creates an android that is supposed to be a clone of her. Mihoshi accidentally loses a hair in the incubation chamber, and the result is a super strong airhead that causes all sorts of trouble. Kiyone has to step in and take care of things. In episode 10 Ruoko's past comes back to haunt her. Her arch rival, Nagi the bounty hunter, comes to call and collect the reward for Ryoko's capture. This is another great entry in the Tenchi Universe series; and it only gets better after this.",1353024000,,688,4.3
7923297,4,B00004U0D1,"Where to start, where to start....first off Washu makes a android modeled after herself.  But while the robot has her powers, and a tad more, it ends up with Mihoshi's mind after a hair from that police officer somehow gets into the scanning device.  Don't ask.  Anyway, Mecha-Washu eats everything it can find, thinks she is a officer of the law and likes to watch TV.  In the battle between Washu and her robot Washu's doll-puppets are so confused they end up cheering for both sides!  We also learn WHY Washu was put into the shrine in the first place - boy was she evil!
The next episode is about memories and, while it is touching and helps full out the characters of Tenchi and his family, there is not much of a plot to comment on.  IT shows the grief Tenchi, Katsuhito and Nobuyuki feel at the lose of Tenchi's mother.  It also hints at a link between them and the Jurai Royal Family.
The last episode brings in the interesting character of Nagi, a bounty hunter with a male cabbit, and reminds us that Ryoko is STILL a wanted criminal.  She ends up kidnapping Tenchi to draw Ryoko to Venus.  In the end, because of Tenchi, Ayeka and Ryoko end up fighting Nagi together.
While the DVD is not as interesting or funny as the others, it does show the female characters evolving beyond petty infighting.",1087603200,,1307,4.457983193277311
7923298,5,B00004U0D1,"The Third Volume of Tenchi Universe is called ""On Earth III"" and that's mostly true.  The last espiode, they actually go to Venus and try to free Tenchi from a bounty hunter that's Ryoko's arch rival.
  The gang gets to deal with Mecha-Washu in the first espiode of this DVD.  Mecha-Washu is Washu's creation (duh), but has Mioshi's brain!  Mioshi gives new meaning to the word ""Airhead"" as she is dense.  I feel sorry for Kiyone!",1015459200,,430,4.592105263157895
7923299,5,B00004U0D1,"I have to say this is one of my all-time favorite anime fans out there! Usually i'm not this nice to some anime but i love Tenchi!!!  Tenchi is funny(some may not get the jokes) and i reccomend this DVD to all ages becuase there really isn't anything bad on this one. WARNING: it is a lot different than the tenchi on cartoon network it is not edited, it's left uncut. So some parts parents might not approve of it....
  When Washu made that clone of herself i thought that was soo funny. Oh my god i was rolling on the floor laughing(okay not really but it gets a point across). That was really good. In ""No Need for Memories"" there wasn't a lot of action but to me it was sort of touching. The two other ones were non-stop action. Okay you might think i'm crazy and ""she's just another one of those people that make up things just to write a good review""... i'm not really! but it might sound that way :)
  I'm not really gonna tell you what it's about because Mr. Charles Solomon(i think that's his name) wrote a review summarizing the DVD so you might as well read his(plus i'm way tooo lazy).  Score on 1-10, 10 being the highest
Music:7
 Animation: 9
 Plot: 8
 Extras:9
 (one of the best i've seen!)
  Overall this is a movie worth spending your moola on. But be warned buy the first two before buying this one or have a good understanding of it or you will be lost.",986688000,2,1372,4.21455938697318
