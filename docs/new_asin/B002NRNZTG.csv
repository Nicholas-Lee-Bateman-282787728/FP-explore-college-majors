8375330,4,B002NRNZTG,"Mine (2009 release; 86 min.) is an extraordinary documentary that looks at the bond between humans and their pets, in the context of the disaster that was Hurricane Katrina. As the documentary opens, we get footage of Katrina hitting New Orleans at full force, and then looking at the desperate rescue attempts. Tens of thousands of residents are forced to leave their pets behind, much to their distress and frustration. The movie then focuses on the rescue efforts of those dogs and cats left behind, and what subsequently happened to these pets after their rescue, as well as to the respective pet owners and later adoptive families. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, youll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first, thank you to director Geralyn Pezanoski for bringing us this documentary. To see the stories of these utterly dependent animals will tug at your heart, if nothing else. The movie brings tremendous insights how much these pets mean to their human companions, and vice versa! Ive had cats most of my adult life, and I think this movie will very much speak to any lover of cats or dogs. Second, the movie wisely stays away from any political commentary as to the rescue efforts post-Katrina, and remains focused solely on the pet aspects. Third, while some attention is given to cats, the overwhelming majority of the documentary (Id say probably 90 percent) focuses on dogs. No idea why that is the case. But in the end its a minor quibble. Bottom line: Mine is a must-see movie for any dog or cat lover, and HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

Mine was released on DVD by Film Movement in 2010 as part of their DVD-of the Month Club of foreign and indie movies, and as such there is a bonus shortie on the DVD: La Vie dun Chien (The Life of a Dog, 2006 release from the US; 13 min.) is an eye-popping black/white still-frame movie about a scientist in Paris in the early 60s who discovers a drug that allows humans to become dogs for a 12 hour span. Im not going to say more, just watch it!",1411344000,,2051,4.5858310626703
8375331,5,B002NRNZTG,"We just went thru another hurricane here in Louisiana and I see all over again how much people need to see this film. As an animal rescuer I am sick to death of clueless people blaming people for not doing enough for their animals. People DIED-lot of people--because they would not leave their pets. And many, many more have committed suicide or are emotionally damaged forever because, even though they did all they could, they didn't feel it was enough. Rescuers also killed themselves. Because there was not, and still isn't, a system to rescue and more importantly reunite pets, it will happen again. It is happening right now.
  As rescuers we saw stupidity, evil and ugliness beyond belief, but much more often we saw good, good people who were treated very badly by people who beleive that poor people should not have pets. That THEY get to judge who should have pets. If only peole could be as clear about what is right and good as animals are the world would be a much better place. A dog doesn't care if it's person is black, white, rich or poor. LOVE is all that matters. People who lost everything they owned were refused the only things they really cared about-their animals.
  When I get to be God I will mandate that everyone watch this film.",1346716800,2,1257,4.573333333333333
8375332,5,B002NRNZTG,"As a So. California tourist who couldn't get out of New Orleans in time (Airport, Amtrak, Greyhound all shut down prior to the evacuation) and ended up in the Superdome, I found this movie especially poignant and moving.  The magnitude of the issue surrounding hundreds of thousands of stranded animals in the Gulf area was huge.  ""Mine"" tries to see the problem and issues from many points of views including animal rescue folks simply doing the best job they can under extremely stressful situations to mean-welling people who have adopted Katrina pets to finally, those whose pets/family members are lost and adopted who want to regain custody.

I don't know how this documentary could have been improved upon.  It followed various human and non-human characters throughout the movie and didn't slow down for a minute.  I have only the highest praise for the film makers and most surely the airing of this program throughout the U.S. has led to even more reunions between lost pets and their guardians.

8375333,5,B002NRNZTG,"Great movie, everyone who loves their pets should see it.  I can't praise it highly enough.  As a Katrina survivor and animal lover it hits me on so many levels.  It will bring tears of sadness and joy to many viewers, including me.  As a documentary should it presents several sides of complex issues Katrina created without explicitly siding with one view.  As a native and witness I believe I know who the true heroes are and those who acted dishonorably.  Taking advantage of an unprecedented catastrophe to enforce their beliefs on helpless victims these people lied and prevented reunions which should have happened.  People who in many cases lost everything they owned, whose sole hope was to find their pet(s), were denied custody of beloved animals ""saved"" by so-called rescuers.  Mine shows some of this truly ugly side but most of the people covered by the film were eventually re-united with their 4 legged family.  It might be unbearable to watch if it didn't. A short addendum covers the return of J.J. to Jesse, who was still negotiating after the filming stopped.

Mine is an incredible, important movie.  While providing a good overview of the rescue efforts the film covers a core group of participants, owners trying to find their pets, rescuers, and people who adopted Katrina dogs and cats without being informed the original owner might be looking for the animal.  As I stated earlier most of the stories in Mine have happy endings but the viewer knows there were far too many other, less happy outcomes.

If you don't live or never have lived in an area susceptible to hurricanes you don't know what it's truly like.  Just as people live in earthquake prone areas or by rivers or lakes that flood or where tornadoes are common these  aspects become a part of existence.  Before Katrina no shelters would accept pets.  Very few hotels allowed pets or charged unaffordable fees.  Even campgrounds did not allow pets.  I was beginning 4th grade when Betsy hit New Orleans.  In the 40 years between the two hurricanes I did not evacuate once, not even for Katrina even though I would have liked to leave.  In those years there were several hurricane threats and people evacuated but there was never anything approaching Katrina, not for New Orleans.  Many people who had to drive to hotels or other places to evacuate got into a ritual of leaving their cat(s) or dog(s) at home with extra water and food to return in 2 to 3 days when the threat passed.  This was how life was and it took Katrina to change state and federal laws mandating pet-friendly evacuation options.  It's estimated that at least 40% of human deaths were pet owners refusing to leave their pets.  After the storm everyone saw the heartbreaking spectacles repeated again and again on TV: the rescuers could take only humans so as boats or helicopters left the scene the cameras focused on the dog(s) left behind, looking frightened and bewildered.

Hurricane Katrina changed the way much of the USA and world will handle future evacuations.  Mine is a testament to the tragedy that opened our eyes to the incredible bond humans and companion animals share.  In late August, 2008, Hurricane Gustav potentially threatened New Orleans and I was one of many volunteers working on the first pet-friendly evacuation in the city's history.  Hundreds of people and pets stood in line to register together and most pets were put in large carriers and driven in air-conditioned trucks (with fresh air intake) to Shreveport.  The owner(s) got on buses headed to the same location as the pets.  Gustav was a good ""dry run"" but I hope I don't live to see another storm like Katrina... but if I do I'll be at the Union Passenger Terminal before it strikes to make sure no one has to leave a pet behind again.

If you haven't thought about the significance of the name of the movie it is this: so many people, original owners and new owners, used ""mine"" whenever they discussed the dog in the middle.",1283558400,2,3975,4.7492711370262395

What makes us different from the beasts of the field? How are we not like other animals?

There's lots of ways, really. We've mastered fire, invented the internet and, sadly, brought Michael Bay into the universe. We're also unique among every other species that we know of in that we keep pets.

I've never been much of a dog person. I seem to remember my parents had a large dog when I was a toddler, but after they got divorced we just had cats. I loved the cats we had, especially Joey and Victoria who were with me from the age of about 8 until they died in the mid-1990's. Since then I haven't owned any pets (well, a few tropical fish). This hasn't been because I didn't want to, but because I've lived in places where I couldn't. So having owned pets and loved them dearly I do get at least something of a feeling for where the people in this movie are coming from.

The movie is a documentary telling the stories of various survivors of Hurricane Katrina and their efforts to get back their pets (all dogs, sadly. More dogs were rescued than cats. Why? Dogs bark). These pets have been scattered across the nation and while some are located quickly many are not, and several of them have been placed with new families that love them and don't want to give them back.

This was a fascinating film. There's no bad guys here. Everyone involved loves the animals in question and thinks they are doing the right thing by keeping them or by trying to get them back. I felt for everyone here, from the beleaguered shelter owner who was trying her best to the 86 year old man who wanted his beloved poodle back. Everyone was doing what they thought was right.

This is a truly excellent film, easily one of the best documentaries I've seen in a while. I was deeply moved. I highly recommend this movie.

Included with the film are an unusually large number of extras. I'm accustomed to Film Movement being somewhat niggardly with their features (usually just a trailer and some ads for other movies), but they hit it out of the ball park on this DVD. One caution: DO NOT check out the list of extras before you see the movie, since the titles give away several key features about the ""plot"" of the film.

=== Short Subject ===

This month's short film is ""La vie d'un chien"", or ""The Life of a Dog"". Sadly, much as I really enjoyed ""Mine"", this movie does not begin to measure up.

First off, despite it being what one might call a movie, there's only about two seconds of actual movement. Everything else is told in a series of rather pretentious black and white still photos showing what's allegedly Paris in the early 1960's. The entire movie is in French, which seems odd given that it's an American production.

The story centers around a scientist who develops a drug that enables people to turn into dogs. Of course the government cannot allow this, as the film says, because it enables people to experience actual freedom. Or whatever. Mostly it enables them to run around barking and having sex with other dogs, both actual and ""human"".

Really there's nothing good to say about this film. It was bad from the first still photo to the last. Pretentious, unrealistic nonsense that's not worthy of being on this disc. So bad is it that normally I'd have docked the disc a star for having it, but since the feature film is so strong, it keeps all five stars.",1271116800,2,3433,4.483974358974359
8375335,5,B002NRNZTG,"Mine is a documentary focused on the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in relation to the pets left behind when people evacuated and were not permitted to bring their pets along on buses, to shelters, etc.

The first part is the immediate aftermath of the storm, when pet rescue organizations were coming into New Orleans and pulling animals out of abandoned houses.  It is, of course, heartbreaking to see animals in distress.  Some of those animals spent a long time alone on a roof or locked up in a house before they were rescued--some were emaciated, filthy, bug-ridden--but it is so wonderful to see them being rescued by people who truly care.

Next, the film discusses how the pets were distributed to shelters all around the country (quite amazing to see how many people and how many states were involved in this process). There was no system set up at the time for people to find their pets when they returned home; eventually, there was a system created but many of the pet owners didn't know about it or find out about it until a year or more later.

The last part of the film focuses on the frustrating and highly emotional situation that resulted when pets were adopted out to new homes and then the original owners finally found out how to find their dog...and the new owners often didn't want to return the pets.  There were no laws at the time to handle this situation. The film focus on 4 or 5 families trying to find their dogs.

It is not as weepy as you might think, but it certainly is touching, especially those stories of the original owners who have finally found where their beloved pets are after 1-3 years only to learn that the new owners don't want to give them back. It was that part of the film that had me weeping, though I was very touched by all of the film.

As a dog owner, when I hear of a friend's dog dying or see/hear of any kind of pet trauma, there is always a part of my mind that is thinking ""What if it were me?  How would I feel if that was my dog?""  This has never been more true than while I was watching Mine.  The thought of being evacuated and not being allowed to take Missy, my Shih Tzu and best friend, was traumatizing enough...and then the thought of not being able to find her afterwards, or finding her and the people who had her not wanting to give her back...it was just too much to process.  My heart ACHED for the people in the film who were going through this very thing.

I saw Mine as part of a small screening room audience vs. in a large theatre, and I'm very happy to have had that experience.  It gave people in the audience the freedom to react vocally to what was going on in the film (and perhaps the freedom to cry more freely) and that made it even more of an intimate, special experience.

A lot of people tend to want to avoid seeing things that are difficult or emotional to watch.  I urge you not to turn away from this, but to embrace it.  It is through films like this that we learn...we find out what is wrong and perhaps help fix it.  Mine tells a very important story...and it's important that we listen.",1270771200,11,3085,4.326388888888889
