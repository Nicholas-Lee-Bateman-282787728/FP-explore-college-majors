5391673,4,B00A705QVQ,"To Catch A Virgin Ghost (a.k.a. Sisily 2km) is a 2004 ghost story from Korean cinema. But it's also a gangster film and an offbeat comedy. One downbeat is that it doesn't sustain its momentum and manic energy all the way to the finish, although the last scene is really very sweet.

I veer away from Hollywood every now and then to sample movies from other countries. As you know, world cinema serves up contrasting tastes and sensibilities. Some aren't what you're used to; some may not even be your cup of tea. But if you're up to trying new things and soaking in other cultures...

Petty crook Seok-tae (Kwon Oh-Jung) gets the ef out of dodge with a stash of diamonds but not before disposing of his immediate boss Yang-e (Im Chang-jung). Just off the remote village of Sisily - 2km away, if you go by the movie title - Seok-tae is so busy celebrating that his jeep slams into a tree. A stranded Seok-tae stumbles upon villagers working the field and rapidly worms his way into their good graces. Meanwhile, his immediate boss Yang-e - who isn't as disposed of as we'd first thought - assembles his gang and begins tracking Seok-tae. These are the bare bones of the plot. From here on, it gets really, really weird.

I love movies where not everything is what it seems. I love it even more when you can't identify the good guys from the bad guys. This movie seems as if it was shot on tectonic plates, perspectives shift so much and assumptions so routinely shattered. Early on, you may have thought Seok-tae was the central character. And maybe, just maybe, some viewer out there did nail his character arc.

There's an unsubtle poke at those spooky J-horror ghosts. There's even an unexpected love story. It's a genuinely funny film all around, expertly constructed and supported by fine comic dialogues. My favorite bits revolve around Im Chang-jung, who is brilliant. I love his interactions with his three henchmen, but, even more, I love his exchanges with Song-e (Yi Shin), none of which went down the way I thought they would. No, I wasn't okay with how the bad guys meet their doom at the end; I thought it was lame and that it torpedoes the fresh vibe the film had been generating up to that point. But that's just one gripe extracted from an otherwise fun-ass film. To Catch A Virgin Ghost beautifully blends in genres of humor, crime, and horror, although the quirky humor is the dominating presence. But the levity doesn't at all take away from the moodiness or creepiness of the supernatural components. And, okay, if I could register another gripe, it's that I wish the ghost had been in the film more. She was dope.",1396051200,4,2634,4.609808102345416
5391674,4,B00A705QVQ,"The story did NOT end like I was expecting and it was a VERY PLEASANT twist on how I thought it was going to go.  Good flick with just a couple of ""jump outta the chair"" moments.  There are funny moments that took me by surprise.  While the show might be for everyone, I did enjoy it.

Grab some popcorn and a soda!  Sit back for a Saturday night at the movies.",1392076800,2,361,3.9583333333333335
5391675,4,B00A705QVQ,"Comical and twisted.  It was hard to tell who were the good guys and bad guys throughout the movie until almost the end.  Well written.  The movie was suspenseful, comical, and dark.",1388534400,3,182,4.625
5391676,3,B00A705QVQ,Villain unconvincing & unclear in this movie. Costumes & designs lacked creativity. Overall plot helped moved the movie along quickly.,1388275200,,134,5.75
5391677,3,B00A705QVQ,Feel free to Read more detailed reviews.  It's a black comedy and I laughed a few times. Would recommend it but wouldn't watch it again.,1383177600,,136,4.44
5391678,5,B00A705QVQ,I read the other viewers results and thought that I would check this movie out for myself and they were spot on with their  comments. It was a very funny and enjoyable movie with a sweet ending. It didn't take me to long to figure out who the bad guys were. The ghost was cute even with her scary eyes. I think people should check this movie out its worth the whole hour and a half of time. Trust me I have seen worse. SHARKNADO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Need I say more.,1377993600,5,469,4.269662921348314
5391679,4,B00A705QVQ,"TO CATCH A VIRGIN GHOST (also known as SISILY 2KM) is a fun, enjoyable black comedy-thriller set in a small village in South Korea.  It'd be difficult to explain even the story without giving much away, but suffice to say the film opens with a thug on the run from the mob (after stealing a cache of diamonds), who accidentally crashes his SUV near a remote village.  Walking to the village, he finds about a half-dozen country bumpkins, men and women working the fields, who he cons into letting him stay the night because he's stranded.  When a practical joke gone bad results in the not-too-bright gangster's death (he cracks his skull on the toilet in the john), the villagers find one of the diamonds on him (he swallowed the rest; long story), and instead of calling the police they decide to bury the dead crook and sell the diamond to make their lives prosperous again.  When the dead guy's ex-buddies from the mob come looking for him, the guy's crashed vehicle leads them directly to the simple villagers - and a female ghost that spooks the gang's leader big-time.

But this is a KOREAN film - which means the gangsters ... the villagers ... even the ghost are not what they may at first seem.  Further, is the guy who stole the diamonds even really dead??  Things get very weird, very fast in this low-budget black comedy where, just when you think you KNOW who the bad guys are, you find your perception of things might just have been dead wrong.

I watched this on Netflix because (other than my love for Korean films) the film had some very well-received reviews there.  Was so totally NOT disappointed; just keep in mind this one is both funny and a little bizarre - and well worth your time.",1371427200,7,1708,4.537459283387622

8547554,5,B00A705QVQ,"An unpredictable parody of intersectional film tropes, ""Sisly 2 Km"" (original Korean title) is concerned with only one thing: making fun of every Asian film genre, from the Japanese Grudge Ghost, to the Korean Comedy Crime Caper. It's extreme in it's frustration of the audience's expectations, and like the film's introductory diamond thief, it veers all over the road and crashes over a cliff, only to reanimate as a completely different beast! A bizarro world where nothing is as it seems, ""To Catch A Virgin Ghost"" is similar to a trio of millennial international films, France's ""With a Friend Like Harry"" (2000), England's ""Sexy Beast"" (2000), and Spain's ""Witching And Bitching"" (2013), where little isolated communities are visited by an unwelcome chimeric force of malevolence and are forced to respond in whacked, increasingly wicked ways.

Thus, as the film progresses from the opening act of seemingly predictable and therefore ""normalized"" violence, the narrative wobbles and stretches into a genealogical goof-out, featuring such silly sundries as a corpse that won't die, the best ""suspect photo array"" ever put on film, and a Buddhist monk-turned-gangster explaining, ""Ghosts are afraid of naked people-- especially virgin ghosts are afraid of men's thing!"" For fans of the Cohen Brothers brand of crow-black comedy (The Lady Killers, Fargo, O Brother, Where Art Thou?), New Zealand's Death Grin Cinema (Housebound, Deathgasm) or Scandinavian Scare Satires (Denmark's The Substitute, Norway's The Troll Hunter), To Catch a Virgin Ghost (2004) plunges down that dark alley. A diamond-crime caper with a jaundiced heart and grotesque-humor sensibility, this wicked Korean ""gem"" will bedazzle you!",1491264000,4,1710,5.501901140684411

8547556,4,B00A705QVQ,Very good movie. Had me laughing so much especially when the ghost was now trying to get rid of the mob guy by pulling him. That is not ghost like. When the old guy kept telling the other mob guy that he can hear someone from behind the wall but he did not believe him and kept hitting him that was very funny.,1476489600,,310,3.9365079365079363
