6684232,5,B00NXKZMU2,"The Canal is an excellent and brave new film in a worn out genre. The cinematography, sound effects, and score are superb and used effectively to heighten the level of dread and fearboth psychological and otherwise. It is best to go into this film knowing nothing about it beforehandbeing surprised by the plot and struck by the surreal quality of the mysteries before they unravel are important elements to receiving the maximum impact this movie has to offer. That said, I had to watch it twice to let the ending settle, and I definitely understood and appreciated it more the second time around.
Great castingEvans is perfectly charming, Calum Heath brilliant for such a young boy, and Steve Oram's lines were just enough to cut the high level of tension with a bit of acerbic wit.
I was really impressed by this film. I thought there were many layers to it, and it went in directions you might not expect without feeling stretched or out of place.
Kavanagh doesn't disappoint herehe truly delivers as both writer and director. Visually, this movie is atmospheric, stunning, nightmarish, unique...all the things we want in a horror flick. The story itself touches on very human notes amidst all the darkness, and that's exactly what makes it so terrifying. Highly recommended.",1413331200,9,1279,4.925925925925926
6684233,5,B00NXKZMU2,"Wow! This movie is really scary! I had some doubts when I ordered it; I had seen the facebook page for it and figured it would be at most a spooky independent movie to pass a Saturday afternoon with. I'm really glad I rented it, the movie is truly frightening! It focuses on a lot of atmosphere and slow build, but the movie itself doesn't feel slow or dragging. You may feel like you know where it is headed/what's going on etc. but stick with it as more of the story unravels. It's more than creepy, definitely scary.",1412985600,16,519,4.3061224489795915
6684234,2,B00NXKZMU2,"I wish that filmmakers would realize that you cannot make a good movie without a good plot and a good storyline. Visually, this film is interesting but the plot is boring and predictable.

You can guess what will happen within the first half hour so there really isn't a twist that I believe the director was hoping for.

Ultimately it reminded me of those really bad flashy, fluttering music videos from MTV during the late 90s.

Of course the handful of scares are the result of quick edits, loud noises and the typical fare.

It seems like most of the horror films from the past few years are all flashy editing and no substance. I guess that's what people want these days...visual flare without a complicated plot that can go anywhere without regard to reason and logic. Kind of a shame. Movies need to be tethered to some kind of standard of storytelling.

If you remove plausibility and probability, it doesn't make for mystery or scares, it simply creates a plot that you roll your eyes at.

Are you the kind of movie fan who likes Transformers 3? Then you'll like this movie: all flash, no substance. No complexity. No subtlety.

This movie is the Transformers 3 of horror movies. That is not a compliment, unfortunately.

The ending? I'll spare everyone of the spoilers but it added nothing to the plot and was more of the tasteless shock factor that a film without substance relies upon. What a horrid movie and I say that as a longtime fan of horror movies.

I'll end with the obligatory ""I cannot fathom how anyone would rate this 5 stars"" because I genuinely cannot. It's a shame we cannot rely on Amazon reviews anymore. They've been gamed by the studios and people who realize money is at stake. Gone are the days of the honest, impartial reviews.",1454284800,,1762,4.603833865814696

There isn't anything new here and don't be scared off by reviewers suggesting it needs subtitles, if you can understand English, you'll have no problem. It took a weird gruesome turn at one point that didn't seem to fit with the rest of the film's dark, creepy atmosphere. Worth a watch, but nothing outstanding.

Update: I came here to write a review and I already had  - apparently it's THAT forgettable. But if I can make it to the end of a movie, I'll give 2 stars. Definitely a C, not B movie.",1442534400,,532,4.474226804123711

6684244,2,B00NXKZMU2,"After reading a lot of the reviews I felt i was prepared for a good scare.  The plot is completely nonsensical, nothing even close to a revelation or clarifying event happens until the last 15 minutes of the movie.  For the first hour or so I felt a pretty good build up but the reveal - if you want to call it a reveal - was just plain silly.  It's all mood and vague occult references.  Two stars for a corpse giving birth.  Not because it fit into the story or made any sense at all, but because this viewer was pretty grossed out by it.

Now the acting wasn't half bad, cinematography was acceptable as well.  But without a cohesive script, it doesn't matter what you do.  If you can't bring it home, don't make the trip.",1438992000,2,725,4.202898550724638

6684246,3,B00NXKZMU2,"I bought this DVD because of the subject matter and the fact that Rupert Evans (Hellboy, Agora, Fingersmith, Guantanamero, Sons & Lovers, World Without End, etc.), one of Britain's finest actors, was the lead character.  He did not disappoint. However, The Canal is a mixed bag. It does have many ""horror"" moments. Yet, it is primarily - if not exclusively - told from the mind/view of RE.  Therefore, the audience is constantly being manipulated into playing a kind of guessing game.  Is it real, is it imagined, is it supernatural?  RE is a film archivist who apparently gets lost in his own world of past events. On top of that he purchases a ""new"" home with a homicidal history that goes back to 1902. It was then that a man killed his unfaithful wife followed by a series of additional murders that impregnated RE's home with a powerful negative aura of supposed spiritual activity.  Five years later, after living in said house, the sudden disappearance of RE's wife whose body was found in a nearby canal sets into motion a sequence of terrifying events that seem to be recapitulating the past into the present. The question(s) now is: Is the past responsible for the present; is the present merely independently duplicating the past; is there any connection at all; or is it the result of a mental breakdown by RE in the wake of his wife's death?  Without giving anything away, suffice it to say that there are at least two extremely important clues: 1) The content of a lecture given to a group of young students by David (RE) at the beginning of the film; 2) A comment made by a police officer to RE during the course of his investigation into the death of RE's wife. What we have at the end is a kind of Agatha Christie twist melded with a horror genre. Throughout The Canal the acting is excellent on the part of all (though sub-titles in English might have helped at times). Especially noteworthy is the young actor portraying RE's 5 year old son. I did not give this movie 4 stars because, for me, it too often seemed a bit disjoInted, too manipulative, and it left me with a feeling of unresolved incompleteness (though that was probably the intent of the film maker).  My other thought at the end of the movie had to do with an old TV commercial: ""It's not nice to fool Mother Nature."" For those who like ""scariness"", seeing this film on as large a TV screen as possible should do the trick.  I would also recommend the movie Dark House.",1437177600,,2453,4.546485260770975

6684253,4,B00NXKZMU2,"After viewing some old crime film from 1902, a film archivist discovers his home has been the scene of several murders.  A short time later, he learns his wife is having an affair. When she drowns after leaving her lover, he becomes convinced the spirit of the long-dead murderer killed her while the investigating officer homes in on him as the killer. Most of the characters are very unsympathetic, and indeed may even be considered unfeeling to the main character, such as the mother-in-law who tells him at his wife's wake that everyone (except he) knew of her affair and her boyfriend is very broken up by her death.  Really? This rather callous display sets the tone for the rest of the story as he tries to capture evidence on film of who really killed his wife only to become more and more deeply enmired in madness.

Well-filmed, well-written, and well-acted, this is a leisurely-paced film which is nevertheless derivative as far as plot. Filmed in Ireland, there's no beautiful countryside in this one, just the dark, weed-clogged canal of the title, with a very filthy public bathroom nearby. There's not much change of scenery. Most of it happens along the canal itself and in the archivist's home.  Good use of light and shadow and plenty of suggestion.  Some viewers may have a problem with a couple of the character's accents. Perhaps showing a little more background, more of the police investigation instead of merely have the officer pop in at times and threaten, or having one ""believer"" on the archivist's side might've helped. Otherwise, it's a straight-forward, but scary story with an unfortunately foregone conclusion.",1434067200,3,1643,4.938405797101449
6684254,5,B00NXKZMU2,"The movie is all about simplicity in a supernatural horror movie. Simple but effective. BGM is just right for each scene.

The core, at least to my understanding, is hallucinations as a tool of an evil entity. The ending will just make one think if the previous incidents within the movie is just psychological trauma or something similar to demon possession.",1433548800,,359,4.885245901639344
6684255,5,B00NXKZMU2,"The story is a strong, emotional character study that plays out in a melancholy way with moments of tense, chilling energy that seems to ripple through this creative nightmare. ""The Canal"" blends the concepts of cursed property, tragic lives, and horrendous past in a way that keeps you guessing. Well actually you start guessing midway through the film when suddenly more possible scenarios comes to light. It is still heavy with the paranormal, and keeps with a darker, more sinister tone. The acting is superb and the characters are so developed that you begin to feel for them - I was completely invested. Ivan Kavanagh as created a psychological labyrinth of horror, and tragedy that hooks you from the beginning, drags you through intense melodrama and confusion, then hits with some truly disturbing imagery and finality.

The special effects are so well done that you feel the moments of horror as readily as the characters do. There is a few moments when the paranormal trickery isn't quite as effective as most of the stuff in ""The Canal"" is, but in a market drowning in netherworld nightmares it is hard to make every paranormal gimmick hit home with the audience. The ghost-y stuff is surreal and chilling. True some of it has been seen before but the characters her help to really sell even the basic of effects. The soundtrack is filled with sorrow-filled instrumental music that is full of dread and despair and emotion. The ending is a bit cheesy and not very original. But it creates that moment of finality that actually brings the story out of the whole ""guessing game"" of ""is he? or isn't he?"" which takes over in the middle of ""The Canal"". I really enjoyed this film, it is dark, disturbing and entertaining.",1433462400,6,1729,4.802013422818792
6684256,4,B00NXKZMU2,"Unfortunately....it didn't scare the hell out of me like so many of the reviews promised. The last time a horror movie really knocked me for a loop was SINISTER with Ethan Hawk however THE CANAL really takes place right up there with the unsettling chills that are produced by the production and the very creepy soundtrack that follows through the entire film.

It's one hell-of-a creative story line, the acting is superb and this is one film where you actually find yourself rooting for the character to pull it together and come out on top! It gets a little wary at times constantly finding yourself rooting for the ""bad-guy"" because movie makers have grown so accustomed to throwing so much focus on the drama and so little on fleshing out the characters.

THE CANAL seems to strike a harmonious balance between characters, story and atmosphere so that the film starts out by drawing you in and remains engrossing through the bitter end. The ending, by the way...is where they pull out all of the stops and just completely pull the rug out from underneath you! It's not that it's so much unexpected ( although there are decent surprises at the end) it's more to the point that they just leave you sort of ""unhinged"" just as they kept you throughout the film.

It may not scare the hell of you but it makes damn sure that you enjoy yourself while it try's to shake you up! This is a MUST SEE for all fans of the horror genre!",1432684800,,1428,4.5271317829457365

6684258,4,B00NXKZMU2,"Wrath James White recommended The Canal this afternoon, for those who enjoyed The Babadook. I had been thinking about watching it anyhow, so I took that recommendation to heart as an indication that I should watch it after all.
The movie has a bit more subtlety (an absence of jump scares) than The Babadook, but I can definitely see why there would be a comparison...especially the fact that a lot of the story revolves around a relationship between a father and his young son.
It's another of those movies where you spend a good portion of the time trying to determine whether the protagonist is experiencing something horrifying or if these manifestations are purely a product of their own mind, suffering from some form of mental illness. Session 9 remains the best example of this sort of movie, but this one was still quite good.
There's a nice and eerie atmosphere throughout the movie, some decent effects work, and solid acting...all of which combines to make it a movie that I didn't feel disappointed to have watched.",1430956800,,1028,4.813559322033898
6684259,3,B00NXKZMU2,"Irish horror indie 'The Canal' (2014) plays some nice visual tricks on the viewer, but its all-too-familiar narrative elements don't gel quite well enough to move the film beyond its ghoulish atmospherics, which it relies on heavily to compensate for an otherwise thinly scripted ghost story.  Eldritch found footage, a house with a murderous past, an emotionally unstable protagonist, a dogged detective, a child in peril, etc., set against a landscape of 'waking' dreams-- we spookhounds have seen it all before, executed with wildly variable results.

Even though the movie is predictable, the very last scene is a shocker...one might even call it a 'twist"".

Short synopsis:

A young couple moves into their new house.  They have a few year old son.  The husband works for film-archives and his beautiful young wife has some ""unidentified"" job requiring her to meet with clients.  One day the husband decides to follow his wife, when she leaves work with one of her clients.  He ends up following his wife to the a man's house.

6684267,5,B00NXKZMU2,"It's a rare film that leaves you staring motionless at the screen as the credits roll, especially in the horror genre. The film uses stylistic elements from across the board, so instead of your typical American/Italian/Japanese/German horror film, you get them all rolled into one. The Canal is equal parts creepy, macabre, grotesque, and thrilling. You may guess the ending right off the bat, and at first I rolled my eyes at what is a tried and true horror movie trope. But I kept watching, and it paid off in a major way.

What would be a ""twist"" in your run of the mill horror film is actually central to the plot, leaving you wondering if you haven't gone as mad as the protagonist trying to figure out what's happening. The very last scene is horrific, yet leaves you feeling melancholy and reflective rather than ill. This may all sound so cryptic, but I don't want to give any spoilers.

6684272,5,B00NXKZMU2,"This is a brilliant horror film. A movie that sends the viewer into the deep recesses of creepiness. Just what is happening? What is taking place? Young David seems to be losing his mind, or is there a far more sinister explanation. This is a trippy, spooky and adds a brilliant creepy factor to its story and images. This is the type of film you watch in the dark with the volume up.

The movie has a dark nightmarish atmosphere. There are flashes of images of brutality and twisted moments that have been filmed in the past and have been weaved together inside the flashes of the movie. The tone is a setting of everyday life yet seems to explore the darker nature and the recesses of the mind or at least the viewer questions what is real and what is not.

David and his pregnant wife Alice seek out a new home. After agreeing on the new place, you flash five years later. They now have a family and all seems well. As you know when things seem to be going right, something always happens and specifically in a horror film.

David learns in 1902 his home was a part of a brutal murder. The story slowly unfolds as David explores the darkness of the houses past, right along with his personal situation. The past starts to dig deep into David's reality and everything around him begins to blur. His nightmares and images of the murder seems so real and personal. The movie is very dark and very brutal in the flashes of the murder. The vivid and gruesome backstory of the murder displays itself in very vivid ways. David starts to lose touch with reality, as his mind races and his world seems to start falling apart from what he thought was a peaceful family.

Directed in a wonderful way that twists fear and images and a reality of just what is happening and what is the truth. The film becomes a thick mystery and a story that slowly and vividly unfolds. The suspense is great and adds a layer of Alfred Hitchcock style to its completion.

Something that powerfully stands out is the music score and sound effects. Deeply haunting and very creepy. The music and sounds get under your skin and tingles the nerves.

Like its contemporary, Oculus, it sets up a neat supernatural crime scene, and then goes on blurring the line between what is real, what is the main character's imagination, and what is (possibly) the manipulated reality of a supernatural entity. However, like Oculus, the storyline gets tiring pretty quickly, and the lack of a clear solution in these type of movies left me quite unsatisfied.

6684280,4,B00NXKZMU2,"This film is more enjoyable if you get early on that you are watching it from David's POV. I don't think he suddenly went crazy from watching an (implausible BTW) piece of ""police"" film footage from 1902. All of his perceptions become ours. Is his co-worker REALLY that interested in him? Is the nanny? Or is he imagining things from the very beginning? Perhaps his quiet life as a dad and film archivist/lecturer has crippled any abilities he has in the outside world. He certainly looks uncomfortable at that cocktail party. Or maybe he's right about it all, though he displays no Sherlockian ambition to get to the truth of things. Instead he allows himself to be immersed. But seeing things from his POV actually makes the film more mysterious, because you don't even know if the other characters are reliable in what they are saying or seeing.

This film draws on some familiar tropes: the film or movie that changes every time you watch it; the blurring of the line between film and reality; sane or insane; alive or dead. Billy. the little boy, is a standout against this dark backdrop.

So, I'll leave you to it. I would give more points if both the photos and archival footage were more clear or explanatory and did not have to be used as dialogue and exposition. Instead the camera whips past these rather important points zeroing in only on a sentence on a blackboard but explaining nothing, especially why it needs to be connected to the supernatural.

This is not a conventional, linear film, and there is a great deal of psychological twisting and imagery as the film progresses. I did not experience any scares or thrills, but it was an interesting story and is at least unique in plot and presentation. If you enjoy psychological thrillers, you may find this one worth a rental. I would not watch it again, but it wasn't what I'd call a waste of time or money. I don't recommend it, as there are far too many other films in this genre I'd put before it, but, again, it wasn't one I regretted at least giving a try.",1416528000,3,757,4.338028169014085
6684284,5,B00NXKZMU2,"The success of this story lies in the simple way it is filmed and the great charisma of its leading actor. The story is not especially original, but it also does not get bogged down in the jump scares and silly guessing games of the films in the same category. It's a dark piece of beauty. Try and you can even smell the dark, sticky mud of the canal.",1416268800,,351,4.101449275362318
6684285,3,B00NXKZMU2,"A bit creepy and for sure kinda strange, about what you would expect from a modern day horror film. Some sex so be careful with the kids",1415404800,,136,4.074074074074074

6684292,1,B00NXKZMU2,"It's bad enough that this movie takes a half hour for anything resembling a plot to kick in. It's bad enough that every attempt at a twist is telegraphed from a thousand feet away. It's bad enough that it rips off the Ring wholeheartedly and unsuccessfully.

The worst thing is that every single person in the movie mumbles, but every ""scare"" comes telegraphed with BOOM CRASH SHRIEEK SKREEEEEEE on the score. It's not scary. It's startling. And irritating.

Without the irritating score and piss-poor sound mix, it'd just be derivative, dull, and lacking in any spark making it worth recommending. With the sound design factored in, it's actively hostile to the viewer. Just awful. If you're looking for crackerjack new horror, try the Honeymoon (2014) or Haunter.",1413676800,4,765,5.015748031496063
6684293,3,B00NXKZMU2,"David (Rupert Evans) works at the archives. He has recently moved into a new home with his family. Six second David is not keeping his wife happy. At work, he comes across some old 1902 footage showing that a murder took place in his house, a man killed his cheating wife. He becomes obsessed with killings and the nearby canal, seeing ghosts in every film of the house.

The film starts out a bit slow, and I suspected it was going to be a dud. However, it builds up and the ending made the slower parts worth while to stick it through. Good ghost story.

Parental Guide: F-bomb, sex, nudity...a little of each.",1413590400,,612,4.407079646017699

8680954,1,B00NXKZMU2,"Let me save you a lot of time. The cop tells the husband ""You know why everyone always suspects it's the husband? Because it's always the husband."" Guess what? It's the husband. And you know it's the husband. Not for a second does any of the slightly supernatural nonsense make sense. Nor is his psychosis really explained. He killed his wife...but the ghost of his wife kills him? So we have supernatural/not supernatural....and then, the dad is suddenly some evil dude living in the wall who orders his five year old son to kill himself so they can all be together? YOU DON'T KILL OFF A SMALL KID IN THE FINAL 60 SECONDS JUST BECAUSE YOU FEEL LIKE IT. Oh, and just to make it more ambiguous, apparently, the woman ""sees"" the ghost son in the house at the end. I could barely get through this movie, but I thought, huh, really decent reviews, it's got to be worth this crippling slow repetitive garbage. The only reason I'm giving this a two is because the child was such a great actor.",1518220800,,987,4.458563535911602

8680956,3,B00NXKZMU2,"A couple expecting their first child buys an elegant townhouse.  Five years later, the marriage has cooled most especially for the wife.  She looks for love elsewhere and finds it.  A relatively short time later, her body is found in a nearby canal.  Police immediately implicate the husband but he denies any wrongdoing and is quite sure there is an evil in his house and in the canal that carried out this crime.  Alas, from here, it becomes too predictable in the ""out out, damn spot"" tradition.  (In the final moments of the film, though, some actual dread appears.)  It's certainly not a bad film; it just doesn't really do anything new/different with this theme.  Its acting, writing, direction and production all hit their marks.  An OK movie as long as you're not in the market for a shocker.",1493683200,,800,4.697841726618705
