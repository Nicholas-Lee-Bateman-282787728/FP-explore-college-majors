This movie is the worst horror movie I ever saw in my life.  The story plot is pure crap and this film don't work on any level.

The writer who wrote this film should have never wrote this crap.  The person who gave this film the go head to be be made should have been put in the funny farm, because I think he/she must have been out of his/her mind when he/she gave this film the go a head and if you people saw this crap and like it, you all should be in the funny farm with people just like you who are out of there fliping minds",1143763200,,565,3.8034188034188032

912508,4,6304636571,"I'd seen this movie on cable a while ago but I rented it recently for the extras.  Unfortunately, the DVD info listed here is wrong.  There is no commentary on the DVD.  Michael Gingold and Mike Mayo just appear on a separate feature where they each talk for a few minutes (and have nothing interesting to say).  The other extras are pretty lame too, so as a DVD this sucks but the movie itself is good fun.  It has a healthy blend of humor and gross-outs, though the gross-out stuff is definitely tame by Troma's standards.  I have to give credit to Cynthia Bond, a typically 'beautiful' woman, for allowing herself to uh... go to hell with the part.  Actually, I bet she had a lot of fun doing it!  The movie also fits well in the domain of vampire mythology while still being fresh (in more ways than one).  Overall, it's not a great film but it's a fun evening's entertainment, and the TV scene near the end is definitely DEF!",1102550400,4,930,4.3604651162790695

Buy it and see! Several known performers in this film: Melba Moore, Hardison, TWO Jacksons (one famous Samuel, oh and Freddie)  The climax of the film is intense, the ending is excellent.

912511,3,6304636571,"'Def by Temptation' is the tale of a young preacher-in-training (James Bond III, who also wrote and directed the flick) who takes a break from his studies to spend time with his childhood friend (Kadeem Hardison) in NYC,  obstensibly to get to know a little about the world. He gets a little more  than he bargains for, as he gets caught in the web of a demoness who is  single-handedly depopulating a pick-up joint. (The demon preys on human  weaknesses, such as lust and greed.) The big question: Will the young  preacher remain pure and alive, or will he join the demon's list of  victims?
Pacing- and story-wise, this is a standard B-Movie. It's a touch  more upscale/serious than a typical Troma release, but it still has its  share of humorous moments. The cinematography and lighting is above  average... and there's actually a bit of acting going on in a number of  scenes! (James Bond III is not one of the highlights, unfortunately.) There  are a number of confused moments in the storyline, but none are fatally  distracting, so, all in all, this is a fun romp.
Note for Samuel L.  Jackson fans: Jackson's character is actually rather important to a number  of the elements of the plot, but its hardly 'truth in advertising' to list  him among the film's stars. The minutes he spends on screen can be counted  on one hand.",967075200,4,1333,4.656652360515022
912512,4,6304636571,"As an avid fan of movies from the vampire genre, I wasimmediately drawn to this one based on the detailed review of AndrewWright of Amazon.com.  However, to my surprise, the movie is not about vampires, but instead about the eternal struggle that men are confronted with--temptation.  Bond portrays a minister ""to-be"" who comes from a long line of ministers.  Struggling with the question as to whether there is more to life than the ministry, he visits his childhood friend, Hardison, who is a struggling ""B"" movie actor in New York.  Little did he know that he would encounter a demon temptress named, you guessed it, Temptation, who, like the reviewer stated, is single-handedly destroying the men from a local ""pick-up"" joint.
What makes this movie interesting is also what makes it a little campy. The seductress plays on the main sexual deviations of men: each concluding with real, and relevant, endings to the perpetrators.  The real storyline poses the question, ""Can you resist Temptation in this life to do what God requires of you?"" This is a question which is posed bluntly, and those who answer no, meet gruesome ends.
Overall, the storyline is good, the acting decent, and Cynthia Bond as the temptress is hot.  This is overall a good movie and well worth viewing.",955238400,22,1279,4.898148148148148
912597,5,6304636571,"This movie was considered a low budget film.  However, it turned out to be a block buster in my book.  ""Halloween"" was another low budget film that also became successful.  Def By Temptation was a very interesting movie.  It's action pack from beginning to end.  However, you would think one would make a sequel to this.  If James Bond III doesn't feel the interest to do so, then he should let someone else give it a shot.  Many like myself, when we first saw it, didn't know what to expect but a low budget film with corny scenes.  Not this one.  Not only that, but some folks can relate to it.  In other words, some scenes made you think before you walk into a bar lounge to pick up a female or male.  Seems so real at times in certain scenes and some scenes made you feel like you were there sitting with them at the bar. LOL.  This movie is well over 20 yrs. old and it still remains one of the most creepiest low budget movies ever filmed.  Really wish they do a sequel.

This stinker starts out with an Eddie Murphy look alike as a bartender. The Temptress picks him up and takes him back to her place. It doesn't go well for Eddie. Temp's next victim is John/Norman who she picks up at a bar tended by a Thriller-era Michael Jackson.

Joel, the screen son of Jackson... Samuel, that is, is on his way up to the big Apple from Nawth Kakalacki to stay with his 'dawg' K.

If you love bad 80s horror and make yourself watch this (the whole movie), I think you'll appreciate it for its zaniness, gore, campiness and diverse effects.  But don't watch 20 minutes and decide ""this sucks"" and promptly stop watching.  Trust me, it's worth it.

This is gory, silly, bad 80s horror fun at its bestas long as you can make it through the first hour.  Featuring distractingly horrible editing and abject storytelling, this movie stars and was written/directed by James Bond III, who thankfully never directed anything else.  This alone should tell you all you need to know.  But, just for funsies, let's review it anyway

This film opens introducing us to a womanizer who earns a brutal fate at the hands of a supernatural seductress (Cynthia Bond).  The scenes feature full frontal male nudity as the man runs, screaming for his life.  I feel like they were trying to present this to elevate the intensity, vulnerability and desperation; to set a dire tone.  It worked.. But in subsequent scenes, things feel more campy.  As if, shortly after this scene, the movie decided to stop taking itself so seriously.  Unfortunately, the writing, acting, and pretty much everything else about this film is similarly inconsistent.

The nature of our seductress remains a mystery for much of the movie.  We don't know how or why she kills.  Just that she does.  At one point I thought she was a demon or a succubus or some other manner of infernal temptress.  A brief glance of a clawed (and maybe hairy?) hand made me wonder if she was later a werewolf.

As the story weakly progresses, we get glimpses of vampirism.  But this movie neither follows ""the rules"" of vampirism nor demons nor does it clearly lay out its own new rules.  She has no reflection in the mirror, walks around in daylight, holy water gives her thrashing indigestion and the right Biblical verse will make her head explode.  At one point she seems pleased to have afflicted a lecherous victim with a disease and his skin forms perhaps blistering legions--but the scene is so poorly staged that I wasn't entirely clear if it was meant to be caused by sunlightor if it would continue until he died regardless.  But then why is she not so affected?  And what the Hell even happened to that guy?  Did he die?  We never know!

The special effects, like most 80s and early 90s horror, is heavily biased towards the last third of the movie.  Some blood here and there, wounds and skin lesions, and a clawed hand don't make for a promising first hour.  But the last 30 minutes offers someone being ""eaten"" by an evil TV, our succubus assumes her demon form (multiple different forms), and there are some scenes of spewing gore.  The other element that typifies the third act is LUNACY!  It's hard to keep track of precisely what's going onis this a dream, an illusion from mind control, a flashback mixing with the present?  It sort of turns into a fever dream.  For some reason in a single scene we see our protagonist fighting the succubus in New York City, his grandmother (who lives in North Carolina) suddenly appears in New York and his dead father lectures himagain, all in one scene!  And no, it wasn't a dream nor was anything explained.  But therein lies the joyous madness of bad 80s horror.

Despite being horribly edited, I enjoyed the flashback sequence with Samuel L Jackson (The Hateful 8, Captain America: The Winter Soldier) as Joel's minister father and Bill Nunn (Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead) who we meet as a guy with a new lie for every girl he tries to pick up at a barlike making kung fu movies with Bruce Lee or being a race car driver.  But he also turns out to be an important character and even when he's not trying to pick up hotties, he has by far the best lines!  Kadeem Hardison (White Men Can't Jump, Vampire in Brooklyn) also has his momentsgood and bad (but mostly bad).  But our writer/director/star simply does quite poorly with his character's attempts to be soulful and inflexive.

If you love bad 80s horror and make yourself watch this (the whole movie), I think you'll appreciate it for its zaniness, gore, campiness and diverse effects.  But don't watch 20 minutes and decide ""this sucks"" and promptly stop watching.  Trust me, it's worth it.",1458691200,4,4271,4.656417112299465

912957,5,6304636571,"This is my favorite all-black horror film from way back in the day. It has some of the most genuine performances from Kadeem Hardison and James Bond III. Their conversations are so intimate and real, and seem borne out of personal experience. I really respect a lot of the decisions JB3 made with this: he didn't let his wife get naked, though she's definitely attractive. There was some male nudity but I think it's been edited out of this--not that I like looking at man butt so I'm okay with that.

There are a few other edits to this: when Temptation slips the bisexual guy the demonic salami is out (ooh, that feels good, where did that come from?) and some of the kill scenes are edited. There are at least two extended blacked out spots. At first I thought the disc was bad (maybe it is), but I think that's where they edited out the scenes but left black empty space in its place.

It also sounds like the expletives have at times been nearly muted but that may be my imagination since the original audio was not the most pristine. Not that I enjoy hearing expletives--just saying. One scene definitely has the original audio--the hot mic or clipped audio during the seancy type scene.

I thought it was funny that the DVD packaging has Samuel L. Jackson's name plastered at the time as if he had a major role, when he was not an A-list actor at the time (his performance is still great, is small). Another funny point is that they put a one-liner quote from Shawn C. Phillips' on this 20-year old movie.

I usually care less about the quality of transfer and more about the story, but this is one DVD that could have been better. I guess the original footage must have been missing or damaged. Still it's a great story and a classic in my book. and worth owning.

The extras are nice, especially the interview with Ernest Dickerson and Lloyd Kaufman, who explains this movie is Troma's best because he had nothing to do with it lol.

This is more of a anniversary version of the company that releases movies such as this and the Toxic Crusader movies.",1363910400,2,505,4.622222222222222

913040,4,6304636571,"This movie brings back the good old days for me.  It ranks up there with Vamp.  The main character was extremely cool. She wasn't overacting or cheesy like some blacksploitation moves were.  She was smooth and it was the first and last film that I have seen her in.  You can tell it was a fledglings first film, but he had a lot of rising new stars in it.  It was well written, comical on some levels, and definitely not for young children. It taught a good lesson in my eyes.  The lesson was , ""All the glitters is not gold.""  I just love vampire movies. I always have, well before Twilight.  This is the female version of Blackula and Cynthia Bond is excellent.

913041,1,6304636571,"WHAT A SHAM! Not only does Loyd Kaufman's introduction on this DVD claim this to be a ""lovingly recreated"" remastered version of the ""Director's Cut"", but Kaufman also considers this movie to be the best in Troma's 35 year history. HOW DARE HE MAKE THESE CLAIMS ONLY TO PRESENT THE TELEVISION EDIT OF THE MOVIE! Unless the director, himself, steps forward and verifies this version to be his desired cut, I cannot believe he would accept this version as his own. The cuts seem to have been made with a hacksaw. I had to scan backwards several times just to catch a significant shot that was cut to a mere few seconds - blink and you'll miss it - as I did, over and over again!

I couldn't make it past the first attack scene with John Canada Terrell because, after seeing the butcher job on this scene alone, I had no desire to see how the rest of the movie had been sliced and diced - more so than the victims in the movie itself!

If Kaufman treats his ""best"" films this way, I'd hate to see how he treats his ""less than best"" films!",1306195200,7,1035,4.275510204081633

913043,3,6304636571,"When a pure and innocent young man on the road to becoming a preacher visits his actor friend in the city, the two discover an evil succubus is preying upon men at a local bar. With the help of an undercover agent, they must work together to defeat the creature before it destroys them as well. From the notorious Troma studios and released in 1990, ""Def By Temptation"" is probably one of their better films, but it still is overall a clearly amateur effort. Not bad, but not great, and I felt it dragged a lot here and there. It's considered noteworthy as the first all black horror film since the ""blaxploitation"" era, and it's not as campy as that stuff was, but a little more humor or other form of excitement might have been helpful I think, because at times it seems too slow and tedious to me. As something touted as a Samuel L. Jackson vehicle, that may seem hard to believe, but the truth is, he is hardly in the film at all. Even Kadeem Hardison isn't the main character, as that role goes to the film's creator/director, James Bond III. Also starring in this one are Bill Nunn and, as the evil temptress, Cynthia Bond. And, as for the man-eating demon creature she portrays, when the film is talked about, she is sometimes described as a succubus and often as a vampire. Personally, I have never understood a succubus and a vampire to be the same creature. Even in this film, this creature didn't really come off as a vampire to me. The film is all about temptation and having the strength to resist it. That is definitely what I understand succubi to be all about, and I really have to disagree with the idea that this film is a vampire film. Like ""The Devil's Nightmare"", I believe the creature in this film is a succubus demon and NOT a vampire. Anyway, overall, this film is okay if you don't mind super-low budget stuff. At its core, it's a decent story. Seems like most of the scenes take place in three locales though, so it feels a bit claustrophobic. There's the bar, there's the succubus's apartment, and there's the apartment of Kadeem's character. This kind of adds to the feeling that the movie is a little tedious.

The DVD from Troma has some decent extras, if nothing very meaty. You do get the theatrical trailer, along with other trailers, and there's an intro by Troma President Lloyd Kaufman. The commentaries mentioned on the case by Mike Mayo and Michael Gingold aren't feature commentaries, just brief footage of the people in question commenting about the film. There's a Troma trivia game as well, and stills, and some advertisement type stuff. One of the most interesting extras is ""Scenes from the Tromaville Cafe TV Show"", hosted by a pretty cute character named Melvina. For such a low budget feature, this is a pretty decent release, though it is also a fullscreen release and not super great quality or anything, but I have no clue how this film actually is supposed to look at its best, so... maybe this is as good as it gets.",1273968000,,2969,4.539179104477612

An outstanding and original urban vampire tale that has became a cult favorite and is one of Troma's theatrically released critically acclaimed movies. Writer/rapper/director/producer/star James Bond III and company have created a modern urban flavored supernatural tale that has became one of the most underrated vampire movies ever and one of my faves since high school. Samuel L Jackson does one of his earliest film appearences before being big as he plays the vampire killing preacher who is one of the film's highlights. There is sex and gore in this movie with great atmosphere, a cool old school R&B and hip-hop soundtrack, and a throw back to 70's blaxploitation horror movies all successfuly done.

Be careful what you pray for you just might get it. And it doesn't star Samuel L Jackson. He has a small but pivotal role. It stars Kadeem Hardison aka Dwayne Wayne of the tv series a ""Different World"". And it co-stars James Bond III, no relation to 007. He also wrote the script. You may remember that both he and Kadeem Hardison played Laurence Fishburns' pseudo frat brothers in Spike Lee's classic hit, ""School Daze"". If you want to make it a triple comedy/horror feature night I suggest, ""Vampire In Brooklyn"" written by the late great comedian, Charlie Murphy and stars Eddie Murphy and Kadeem Hardison. And ""Tales from the Hood"" starring Clarence Williams III, from ""Purple Rain"" and the tv series, ""The Mod Squad"". Invite some good friends over. Order some cool snacks and beverages from Amazon.
