8024549,4,6304044372,"In the first episode on this tape, you get to see a glimsp to Kusinagi's moral side and to how he feels towards Momiji.  Plus it tackles a couple of moral ideals like which is more important work or family and is it okay to  treat someone like a guiney pig.
The second episode on this tape is about  Momiji and the PC geek.  Discussing on the topic mostly about the idea that  when on a team everyone is vital regardless of how small the roll or how  useless it seems.
Both episodes touch off on Momiji's unmentionables in  a really funny way like usual.  I'm curious to know why the animators  decided on this running gag on poor Momiji.  However, I do agree with  Kusinagi, she does seem a bit too old for toony underwear.
Its still a  riot though.  I haven't seen all of this series but its one thing I like  about is the mixture of light to hilarious comedy with a growing  relationship.  Some drama sew in just right just enough to make you  wonder.
Will Momiji be sacrificed?
Only time will tell.....",960854400,,1006,4.294117647058823
