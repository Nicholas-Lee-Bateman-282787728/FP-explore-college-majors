4400648,2,B004L9GM5S,"It is hard to believe that it has nearly been a decade since the legendary Chuck Jones had somberly died. But when it has came down it, his creations with Looney Tunes has never been forgotten. He made so many great cartoons for Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, and the innovation of the chase with his famous creations, Wile E. Coyote & The Road Runner. The thrills of the explosions, to ths starting chases, all the way to the wacky Acme devices made these two foes so special. But with all that joy Chuck Jones had shown, it is very hard to actually picture the two of them without Chuck's deep inovation. Well, there honestly have been looney tunes cartoons without Chuck's creation, after he departed Warner Brothers in 1963 for M.G.M. At that point, Friz Freleng stepped up at producing the Looney Tunes cast, and honestly most of those shorts, weren't short enough to be funny. Well, that is shown on this DVD.

Looney Tunes Super Stars: Road Runner & Coyote is a collection of the post-Chuck Jones days of the Road Runner & Coyote's antics on one DVD. The collection of shorts features some delights, from which Robert McKimson had directed including Sugar & Spies, and Rudy Larriva whom had stepped into the weights of director. But honestly, the collection of shorts includes the weak Boulder Wham!, where the coyote struggles to get across a cliff to capture the Road Runner, and The Solid Tin Coyote, where the coyote builds a gigantic robot to help him capture the Road Runner, only to fall short of the cyborg's misteps. While the shorts are remastered nicely for the collection, it still is hard to picture it without the classic Chuck Jones days. Surely, the funny shorts from Chuck's days could've and should've been here with some delights like Hopalong Casualty from 1960, or Hip Hip Hurry from 1958.

While it honestly is interesting to see Warner Brothers choose to take chances with the classic Looney Tunes, this is one collection that I definitely, and absolutely not recommend for die hard Looney Tunes fans, or even those who are new to the Road Runner & Coyote's classic chases. Instead for new fans, try and get the Looney Tunes: Golden Collection Volume 2. Looney Tunes Super Stars Road Runner & Coyote really does fall short of being super, just like one too many sticks of trains that struck the Coyote whenever he fell short of getting his meals.

4400649,3,B004L9GM5S,"It appears there has been some miscommunication on what shorts will be included on this DVD. The actual listing is as follows:

1. Coyote Falls (2010, CGI)
2. Fur of Flying (2010, CGI)
3. Rabid Rider (2010, CGI)
4. Whizzard of Ow (2003, Bret Haaland)
5. Chariots of Fur (1994, Jones)
6. Little Go Beep (2000, Spike Brandt)
7. Sugar and Spies (1966, McKimson)
8. Clippety Clobbered (1966, Larriva)
9. The Solid Tin Coyote (1966, Larriva)
10. Out and Out Rout (1966, Larriva)
11. Shot and Bothered (1966, Larriva)
12. Chaser on the Rocks (1965, Larriva)
13. Highway Runnery (1965, Larriva)
14. Boulder Wham! (1965, Larriva)
15. Harried and Hurried (1965, Larriva)

Needless to say, this is much better than the original listing. If you happen to be a guy like me who enjoys collecting the masterpieces of the Warner Brothers cartoons, you'd pick up this set. Although the Road Runner/Coyote shorts directed by Rudy Larriva are painful to watch, you're still getting part of what went on at this time in the history of these classics. Otherwise, ""Little Go Beep"" can already be found included on the DVD for ""Daffy Duck's Quackbusters"" and ""Whizzard of Ow"" was already released on the DVD release for ""Looney Tunes: Back in Action."" Let's just hope for more Chuck Jones next time. ""Chariots of Fur"" is a pretty good one!",1296777600,12,1317,4.797356828193832
4400650,3,B004L9GM5S,"I'll say this for the Road Runner formula; it's incredibly solid and hard to screw up and I'll enjoy anything with the Road Runner.  But I probably could have waited a bit longer for most of the Rudy Larriva directed shorts that make up about half of this DVD if I could have had the rest of the Chuck Jones directed shorts that weren't covered by the Looney Tunes Golden Collections (about 10 of them from 1958 to 1964).  At least none of these double dip from the LTGC's, but it seems as though the manufacturers decided to start at the end of the Road Runner's classic series in late 1966 and (perhaps) work their way back to where they left off in late 1958.  One can only hope.  I loved The Solid Tin Coyote because the Road Runner was actually scared of that thing (unlike anything else the Coyote created) and it actually managed to CATCH the Road Runner (the Road Runner got lucky, of course, and got away).  And of course we get some of the Road Runner shorts like Soup or Sonic, Chariots of Fur, and Whizzard of Ow that Chuck Jones came back to direct in the 1980's and 1990's.  And I'm curious about those Webtoons that were made only recently, are they much good?  Two I had wished had made it to this collection were Beep Prepared (the only Oscar nominated Road Runner short where the Coyote literally goes out in a blaze of glory in a rocket sled to the stars) and Lickety Splat (which had a great running gag with flying dynamite sticks that follow the Coyote everywhere and blow him away about a dozen times).",1296604800,3,1525,4.3674911660777385
4400651,4,B004L9GM5S,"No Chuck Jones ""classics"" here but he did come back to make ""Little Go beep"" bringing his traditional humor back tot he series. Most are new to DVD.  The three much anticipated CGI 2010 Road Runner Cartoons will be here, mixed in with some revival shorts and the mid-1960's Depatie Freling almost limited animation shorts.  This will make for a very odd mix of Road Runner cartoons.

I know, Warner Home Video is only releasing those cartoons that require little restoration as WB has used up their restoration budget.  Only the first 5 here look pristine, the others have some grain to the picture.
By my count there are 10 CHUCK JONES Road Runner cartoons not on DVD, 4 of them were released on Japanese Laserdiscs in 1999 so they have already been somewhat restored.  I have them, they look great!
There are also 5 more DePatie-Freling Road Runner cartoons not on DVD, and 1 of those was released on a Japanese Laserdisc in 1999.

We can only hope the economy gets better and DVD (or blu-ray) sales go up, encouraging Warner to put more money into their restoration work.

The option to watch these in Wide Screen or Full frame is available on this DVD. Unlike the previous Looney Tunes DVDs, the first five cartoons MUST be watched in Wide Screen to get the full picture.
Warner makes it difficult to switch back & forth between wide screen & full frame. The option only comes up when the disc first loads up, the menus do not give the the option. On my Sony player I had to go to the menu first, press the ""Stop"" button on my remote, then press the ""Enter"" button on my remote, as the disc was loading up again I pressed the ""Menu"" button.  This time the ""Full Frame"" & ""Widescreen"" option menu came up.  Different players may work different ways to get to this menu option.

The REVISED cartoon line-up, the screen format is the format in which the cartoon was made:
COYOTE FALLS (2010 CGI 3 minute cartoon  2:33-1 widescreen aspect ratio
FUR OF FLYING (2010 CGI 3 minute Cartoon  2:33-1 widescreen aspect ratio
RABID RIDER (2010 CGI 3 minute cartoon) 2:33-1 widescreen aspect ratio
WHIZZARD OF OW (2003  7 minute cartoon  1:85-1 widescreen aspect ratio;  previously on Golden Collection 1.)
LITTLE GO BEEP (1994 7 minute Chuck Jones cartoon  1:33-1 full frame aspect ratio
CHARIOTS OF FUR (1989 7:50 cartoon  1:33-1 full frame aspect ratio

and the 1965/66 Depatie-Freling cartoons ranging from 6:20 to 6:50 in  1:33-1 full frame aspect ratio
SUGAR AND SPIES (1966)
CLIPPETY CLOBBERED (1966)
THE SOLID TIN COYOTE (1966)
OUT AND OUT ROUT (1966)
SHOT AND BOTHERED (1966)
CHASER ON THE ROCKS (1965)
HIGHWAY RUNNERY (1965)
BOULDER WHAM! (1965)
HARRIED AND HURRIED (1965)

To be honest, Whizzard of Owl, Little Go Beep, and Chariots of Fur all make good attempts at bringing back the classic style of Chuck Jones and are by far the most enjoyable cartoons in this collection.
Whizzard of Owl MUST be watched in Widescreen, the full frame version pans & scans the widescreen picture to keep the action on screen.
Little Go Beep & Chariots of Fur were produced in full frame with the knowledge that theaters will crop them for wide screen, so watching them either way is acceptable, but you will lose animation if you watch them in wide screen.  They also look grainier when watched in widescreen as the frame is magnified when converting the non-anamorphic film to anamorphic video.

The three CGI cartoons were produced in the old ""Cinemascope"" aspect ratio of 2:33-1 and MUST be watched in widescreen. The full frame version only crops off a great deal of the sides.

Oddly, the Depatie Freling cartoons of the 1960's would have been cropped for widescreen by the movie theaters, but if you watch them in widescreen the image feels tight & cramped. It is preferable to watch these in the 1:33-1 full frame aspect ratio just as they were produced. It seems these were imagined for television where they would end up on ""The Road Runner Show"" on CBS Saturday Mornings, which they did very shortly after.

To show how much you can not trust official notices on the back of the DVDs, here Warner claims that:
""STANDARD VERSION PRESENTED IN A FORMAT PRESERVING THE ASPECT RATIO OF THEIR ORIGINAL THEATRICAL EXHIBITION""
""WIDESCREEN VERSION PRESENTED IN A MATTED WIDESCREEN FORMAT ENHANCED FOR WIDESCREEN TVS""
I guess as long as they believe these were shown in theaters in full frame, we will at least get the option to watch them both ways.",1296345600,93,4438,4.711513583441138
4400652,2,B004L9GM5S,"This DVD may bring back memories for those of us who grew up watching Looney Tunes on Nickelodeon. As we've grown up, some of us have realized that some of these cartoons that were common-place on the Nickelodeon package were far from anything great. Unfortunately, the unsuspecting buyer will be experiencing the torture of watching multiple doses of 1960's Road Runner cartoons directed by Rudy Larriva, a name that certainly isn't a recognized household name such as the great Chuck Jones, who created the Road Runner and Wile E. Coyote in 1949. People love the Road Runner because Chuck Jones was an animation genius who knew all about great gags and timing them perfectly to the animation that was being done for each animated short. With Chuck, a lot of effort was put into these cartoons. With Larriva, you could certainly sense that everyone working on the later Road Runner cartoons were completely lost and just did not get it. It goes without saying that Chuck Jones, to a lesser extent, was no Bill Hanna or Joe Barbera when it came to making Tom & Jerry cartoons.

As for the cartoons on this release, the oldest shorts are from the year 1965. To many, that may seem old, but they probably don't understand that circa. 1940-1958 was the golden era for Warner Bros. cartoons. There are plenty of things a person could watch that are worse than the cartoons on this collection, but you have to think Warner Bros has sunk very low when they are going to include three recent Webtoons on a DVD release. The only work of Chuck Jones on this set comes from when he was beyond his prime. Two of Chuck's shorts ""Freeze Frame"" and ""Soup or Sonic"" are made-for-TV segments edited out of TV specials. The 1990's short ""Chariots of Fur"" is an underrated gem that Chuck made among several other 1990's shorts, but that alone does not justify a purchase.

The bottom line is, Warner Bros. Family Division does not get it. I understand that budgets to restore films are being slashed to pieces as the USA is struggling to recover from this recession, but it does not make good business sense to put out a product that the well-informed people will not buy simply because it was poorly put together.

So, unless you are a diehard fan of Rudy Larriva's work, this DVD is not worth your money. Instead, invest a little more in Looney Tunes Golden Collection Vol. 2, which has a disc with 11 great Road Runner cartoons directed by Chuck Jones, featuring many of the original, clever, hilarious gags that made these cartoons famous worldwide.",1296259200,18,2535,4.679372197309417
4400653,1,B004L9GM5S,"""Looney Tunes Super Stars: Road Runner/Wile E. Coyote: Supergenius Hijinks"" contains the worst Road Runner cartoons ever made. Casual buyers who don't know any better are going to be awfully disappointed with this DVD.

These are not the ""classic"" Road Runner cartoons that were made during the ""Golden Age"" of Looney Tunes. It would be a shame if this DVD was any young person's introduction to the Road Runner, as it would give them a false impression of what the real Road Runner cartoons were like.

What Warner Bros. should have done instead is to release the rest of the pre-1964 Road Runner cartoons that weren't included in the six ""Looney Tunes Golden Collection"" releases, plus the wolf/sheepdog and Bugs Bunny/Wile E. Coyote cartoons that weren't included in those releases.

Shame on Warner Bros. for putting out such a horrible collection of cartoons as its first Road Runner single disc release!

Update added on February 3, 2011: Warner Bros has just announced a change to the contents of this DVD. Five cartoons are being replaced with five other cartoons. However, the DVD will still not contain any of the pre-1964 ""classic"" Road Runner cartoons from the ""Golden Age,"" or any of the wolf/sheepdog or Bugs Bunny/Wile E. Coyote cartoons from that time period. Just like with the original list of cartoons that would be on this DVD, all 15 of the cartoons in the new list were made after the original Warner Bros cartoon studio shut down in 1964. So my original rating of 1-star still stands.",1296259200,333,1507,4.852140077821011
4400654,3,B004L9GM5S,"For fans of the Road Runner, Wile E. Coyote, or both, a Super Stars for this duo will be release this May! According to TVShowsonDVD.com, here's the list of what the release will have:

Webtoon: Judge Granny Case
Webtoon: Wild King Dumb
Webtoon: Wile E. Coyote Ugly
Whizzard of Ow
Chariots Of Fur
Little Go Beep
Freeze Frame
Soup or Sonic
Sugar and Spies
Clipperty Clobbered
The Solid Tin Coyote
Out and Out Rout
Shot and Bothered
Chaser On The Rocks
Highway Runnery

Here's the pros/cons:

Pros:
-Larriva shorts finally being released (even though you guys don't like them, I do.)
-Hopefully a widescreen edition of Whizzard Of Ow included (that cartoon was made in widescreen to begin with)
-Chariots Of Fur and Sugar and Spies also being released
-Like the Foghorn disc, both widescreen and full screen versions
-Hopefully restored and remastered

Cons:
-7 of the shorts have already been on DVD
-Fans of Road Runner/Coyote will be dissapointed that there's no Chuck Jones' RR shorts from the Golden Age
-Web Toons being included (they have no intention of being on any Super Stars releases whatsoever)
-There will be a matted-widescreen option for Freeze Frame and Soup or Sonic (these were made-for-TV shorts and therefore had no intention of being matted)

If I made this release, I keep the Larriva shorts but add the Chuck Jones shorts (especially Wild About Hurry, Beep Prepared, Hopalong Casuality, and Fastest With The Mostest).

Despite the faults, I will buy this set for the new-to-DVD cartoons. And hopefully WHV (If you're reading this) will learn their lesson (again) and won't mess up future Super Stars releases. Don't forget though that these releases aren't targeted for the adult collector, they're for all ages (kids, families, etc.) so some of us are not gonna get what we want.

UPDATE: It seems the list have change (slightly better I might add). Instead of the webtoons, Freeze Frame, and Soup or Sonic, we get the 3 2010 CGI shorts, Boulder Wham!, and Harried and Hurried. Still no classic Chuck Jones shorts but still, if you love Road Runner no matter who the director is, then this is a perfect buy.",1296172800,6,2130,4.851239669421488

The next 2 include ""The Whizzard of Ow"", which is an extra on the Looney Tunes Movie ""Back in Action"".  The second half of this disc are the ones made for TV after the  1940~1958  Great Era. The music & animation take a step down, do to budget cuts & TV censorship. So if there is an episode from the 1960s~1970s Saturday Morning TV Shows, that you are still looking for, it may be on this disc. :

4400869,1,B004L9GM5S,"I showed my grandchildren (8 - 13 years old) the VHS ""Space Jam - Road Runner and Wile E. Coyote"" and they howled with laughter all the way through it. So, I decided to try this DVD, ""Road Runner & Wile E. Coyote - Supergenius Hijinks"" on them. They enjoyed the first three cartoons, even though they were computer generated instead of hand drawn, but after that they stopped laughing. The rest of the cartoons were very slow moving and so poorly animated that they were almost painful two watch. The soundtracks were also very poor. They sounded like they were random pieces of music selected by someone who never watched the shows. After two of these unfunny cartoons the grandchildren got restless and started walking away, looking for something interesting to do. Their behavior suggests that this DVD is not a good entertainment investment.",1421712000,9,845,4.834482758620689

Why with such a variety of awesome  side splitting cartoons To choose from did they chose to assault the sensibility of loyal viewers.  It's so nauseating I was almost in tears.

There are about a dozen computer animated ""cartoons"" which, unlike the actual classics, have no plot whatsoever, are only about 3-minutes each (as opposed to the originals which are 6-to 7-minutes each), and are simply computer-generated special effects. The 3-minute length, one may assume, is so more commercial ads can be inserted in the given time frame when broadcast (if these ever were). There are about 3-actual classic Roadrunner/Wile E. Cyote cartoons on the disc. A COMPLETE DISAPPOINTMENT! I have several thousand classic cartoons in my personal collection, this disc is NOT what it is advertised to be. I'd suggest a selling price of about $2.95 would be more appropriate.

And while Acme may be a ""find purveyor of mail-order supplies"" for the ever-hungry canine supergenius - this dvd does not deliver. Most glaringly, the first three featured cartoons: 'Coyote Falls,' 'Fur of Flying,' and 'Rabid Rider' were especially disappointing as they are the 'new' CGI/3D-ish animation. Most of the other features are only, at best, mediocre representations of two of my favorite Looney Tune characters.

4400935,5,B004L9GM5S,"Anyone who gives this a poor review didn't do any research before buying the collection. If you want episodes from the 50's, I would hope that you would look up what episodes are from that era considering how Looney Tunes has been around for over 80 years.

I actually did the research and have mostly all Roadrunner and Coyote cartoons except for 14 of these more recent episodes. For me - while they might not be the best episodes to star these characters - they are exactly what I'm looking for.

Further, I have and was very much surprised by Whizzard of Ow - which is a recent episode. In my opinion it was nice to see a more modern cartoon that still captured the essence of the classics, and I'm hoping there are a few others like that on this collection.

As to what seems to be the top negative review (not to be deliberately argumentative), the reviewer mentions that this collection should include pre-1964 episodes not included on the Golden Collection. There are very few that weren't already included. Most of the listed ""Roadrunner and Coyote"" Looney Tunes left in that description aren't pure Roadrunner cartoons but mashup/special cartoons with many characters. Also, the reviewer mentioned a lack of wolf/sheepdog and bugs/coyote cartoons in the Golden Collection. They're there. I've watched them. I can't speak of an exact sheepdog episode off the top of my head, but a bugs/coyote one is ""Operation: Rabbit"" in Golden Collection 4, Disk 1.

The reason I mention all of that is because I think WB did a fine job by releasing a very specific era of Roadrunner and Coyote cartoons that weren't easily obtainable before.",1376092800,5,1637,4.773851590106007

4400940,4,B004L9GM5S,"I'm a little disappointed with this DVD release showcasing 15 Roadrunner cartoons. As many reviewers have mentioned, it hardly has any content from the REAL director of these cartoons, Chuck Jones (the only cartoon he directed on this compilation is CHARIOTS OF FUR, and that's a revival short from the mid-90's). It has 6 revival shorts and 9 DFE 60's shorts, all starring the Roadrunner and Wile E. Coyote.

To be honest, though, this DVD really isn't THAT bad. The cartoons are still pretty good (though this is just my opinion), and most have the decency of being new to DVD (all 9 of the 60's shorts as well as the Chuck Jones revival short I mentioned earlier are new-to-DVD while the other 5 have appeared as special features on other WB films). Incidentally, WHV released 11 Roadrunner/Coyote shorts and 4 other shorts on a Chuck Jones disc as part of their&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Looney-Tunes-Golden-Collection-Vol-2/dp/B00020SK1Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Looney Tunes: Golden Collection, Vol. 2</a>. While those shorts are great and could have been used here instead, I'd much rather have more new-to-DVD cartoons (like this single DVD the way it is), regardless of their entertainment quality. And being a Looney Tunes fan, esp. of the ""bona fide"" era, I'm not that hard to please with shorts like those on this DVD.

So, would I recommend this DVD? To Looney Tunes completists, definitely. Casual fans, however, should stick with the Golden Collection shorts and earlier video releases. Like I said though, I'm an LT completist, so I think this DVD is fine.",1371427200,2,1623,5.311284046692607

My picks would have included (if you truly want CLASSIC Road Runner): ""Fast and Furry-ous"", ""Beep Prepared"", ""Gee Whiz-z-z"", ""Zipping Along"",
""Hopalong Casualty"", ""Zip 'N Snort"", and severakl others from that time frame that truly were creative, sly, and laugh-out-loud funny, and not the cookie cutter Saturday morning episodes created presumably for ""The Road Runner Show"" on CBS between 1966 and 1968 when the show was folded into what would become the 90-minute ""Bugs Bunny/Road Runner Show"". The cartoons on this DVD are a poor representation of what was nce a superb series of animated genius, bar none.

4400951,5,B004L9GM5S,"This brought back a lot of memories.  I read the reviews before sending for this DVD and there were a number of negative comments. However, I do agree there were other road runner cartoons that could have been included, that is looking at this DVD with an adult mind.  Try looking at it with the eyes of a 4, 6 and 7 year old grandchild and it is a whole different perspective.  I have watched this DVD so many times I have lost count and have enjoyed even minute on it and the grandchildren have memorized what is going to happen next and they still laugh.  That is what it is all about.  We seldom see cartoons like this any more.  I have had to buy a second copy of this same DVD so there is one at my house and theirs...  There is also another Looney Tunes that has a Road Runner cartoon, but also a bunch of other characters as well.  Both are good.  I would recommend this DVD for the kids who didn't grow up with Road Runner cartoons, for those who did, well maybe you will feel a little let down, but if you watch it with children, perhaps you will cheer up when you hear their laughter.",1364256000,,1095,4.127358490566038

They usually came on in late afternoon on Saturdays back in the 60's and 70's. As a kid I found them very entertaining. They never released ""The Roadrunner Show"" on dvd so this is the only sample of that show you can buy.  The classic Roadrunners that the other reviewers are complaining about are already on other Warner Bros dvd releases. ""The Roadrunner Show"" had quit a few episodes so apparently it carried popularity with alot of people.

These three are shorter than the average Looney Tunes shorts, but they are not webtoons like other reviewers have said.

The other 2 Road Runner shorts ""Chariots Of Fur"" (1994) and ""Little Go Beep"" (2000) are great cartoons and fit to the DVD perfectly. And the main Road Runner shorts made by both Rudy Larriva and Robert McKimson, Larriva's are decent and I like how Wile E. Coyote is animated in these shorts along with some of the background designs, but the Road Runner looks awful in Larriva's animation and the stock music can get annoying (but it doesn't get on my nerves at all). McKimson on the other hand are funny but he only made 2 at DePatie-Freleng. Unfortunately only 9 out of the 13 Road Runner shorts are on this DVD leaving out 4 which are ""Rushing Roulette,"" ""Run, Run Sweet Road Runner,"" ""Tired And Feathered"" and ""Just Plane Beep"" all from 1965 from this DVD release. They should of put those 4 on the DVD instead of the 4 crappy Road Runner shorts from the 2000's.",1341705600,3,1073,4.343283582089552
4400960,1,B004L9GM5S,"Of all of the recent Super Stars releases this is the worst and most misleading. To include NO classic toons is completely crass.

9 of these selections come from the mid-to-late 60s when Warner had already shut down its animation division and  production was farmed out to Depatie-Freleng. Chuck Jones was no longer involved, the music and animation is cheap and the toons are just pale imitations of  the truly classic ones from the 50s.
Worst of all, they are not funny. Totally worthless

The revival cartoons from the 90s and 00s are much better and the couple of CGI ones are actually very funny but still not the original classics from the 40s and 50s you should expect. They are the only reason this even gets one star.",1336089600,9,727,4.612403100775194

I have bought virtually every Looney Tunes Original cartoon available ,especially the Brilliant 6 volumes Golden Collection dvd set. I ordered this computer generated abomination as a pre order last year ,So I naturally expected it to be the same class as previous ""Looney Tunes Super Stars"" series The Daffy Duck and Bugs Bunny ,Sylvester and Foghorn Leghorn editions are great ,As they are the original 1940'S ,50'S ETC Cartoons.
These 15 so called ""CLASSICS"" are not even listed in the Looney Tunes and Merry Melodies bible by Jerry Beck and Will Friewald. The fact that there is no warning on either the casing or the dvd is a disgrace.
Sadly there are very few original Road runner Coyote classic on dvd ,Hopefully Warner Bros will wake up to themselves and apologise to all and sundry ..It's Disssspicable !

I don't understand why Warner Brothers would choose these cartoons (especially the lame ones from the last 10 years) over the ones from the 1950's and early 1960's that were directed by Chuck Jones. There are still about a dozen of those cartoons that haven't been released on the ""Golden Collection"" sets and those would have been a great collection to release on DVD instead.

There are 15 episodes.  Episodes 1-3 are fun, but episodes 4-15 absolutely collapse and fully deserve to be labeled contemptible junk.

The same fate awaited the Mr. Magoo cartoons.  They too were a mopping up operation toward the tail end of their production, with the boredom of the creators so palpable it positively dripped from the screen. It was a cynical, last gasp attempt to separate trusting Magoo fans from their money and I was one of those fans.  Alas, now I've tumbled into the same pit again by being unwary when this Road Runner release came along.

The motive of this DVD is just to make dishonest buck.  A prior reviewer called it ""scraping the bottom of the barrel"" but it's even worse, because these were cranked out expressly FOR the bottom of the barrel, knowing the reputation of Road Runner would ensure them tidy sales.

4400968,5,B004L9GM5S,"I have always been a huge fan of the Wile E. Coyote. I was disappointed for a long time that Warner Brothers had not given Road Runner & Wile E. Coyote the recognition that they deserved. It took them forever to bring them out on to dvd. They may not be the original ones as seen on Tv as a kid but they are just as equally good. Wile was always my favorite in the Looney Tunes characters. I was pleased when I saw this dvd set of just Road Runner & Wile E Coyote cartoons. I was surprised at how crisp and clear the picture was and the color was very great too. Like I said before, it may not be the orginial ones but these are just as great as the originals. I felt like I was taking a trip back in time. I strongly recommend that if you are a big fan of the Road Runner & Coyote that you should buy this collection. It was worth every penny I spent on it. I just hope that they come out with more of them on dvd. They are very entertaining. Lots of laughs. Wile is still using ""ACME PRODUCTS"" with a fatal end every time. You think he would learn. lol There is one episode called BOULDER WHAM! This episode has Wile trying to hypnotize Road Runner and trying to use Judo on him too.

On top of all the classic Looney Tunes yet to be released, what's WB waiting for with the balance of the classic Popeye cartoons?

This was GREAT.

In the 90's I wrote WB several times asking for the complete Road Runners series (pre 65) on DVD and to no avail. I don't think WB management has ever seen a real Road Runner Cartoon (pre 65).They may have been glued to the TV too often, never seeing the real deal.
