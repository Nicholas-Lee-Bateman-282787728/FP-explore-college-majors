5167561,2,B008IG0FVW,It seemed like this movie I had seen many times before as far as the plot goes. I just didn't see anything new and interesting about this movie. The main villain didn't impress me too much. He just came off as a disturbed screw ball.,1366070400,,233,4.2

5167564,3,B008IG0FVW,"""Crawl"" is an Australian Crime/Thriller that was picked up by Bloody-Disgusting Selects, for those who don't know Bloody-Disgusting is a horror website that also acquires foreign horror for American release. I've seen quite a few of the BD selects and for me they're usually a hit or miss. Brad Miska from Bloody-Disgusting says and I quote ""This film is absolutely fantastic, and I guarantee you guys are going to dig it, especially if you like a good slow-burn!"" with the slow burn part being absolutely true but is it indeed fantastic, well no not at all. Slow burn I've kind of figured out after a few films equals boring and ""Crawl"" is a boring movie.

A seedy club owner hires a Croatian cowboy hit man to dispose of a former friend and acquaintance with whom he had a falling out, presumably over money. Soon after the police are on the trail and suspect the club owner had something to do with it. The club owner discovers the cowboy is trying to set him up for the murder for unknown reasons and goes on the hunt to find him. The cowboy now on his way out of town by coincidence gets into a car accident and ends up at the home of one of the waitresses from the club and is now trying to find new means of transportation to escape.

I've heard people compare this to ""No Country For Old Men"" or a Coen Bros film which is nice but far from. It's not a horrible movie and the acting is just fine but no where in the film did I find anything fantastic. A few murder scenes with nothing special and weak suspense do not add up, the soundtrack wasn't bad but that doesn't make anything about ""Crawl"" fantastic. Overall I found ""Crawl"" to be quite boring at times but not as bad as some reviewers make it out to be, its mediocre at best, just another ""ehhhh"" film that if you skip you won't be missing anything special.

If you want to see some good BD Selects go watch ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cold-Fish-Bloody-Disgusting-Selects/dp/B004ZKKKW4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cold Fish (Bloody Disgusting Selects)</a>"" or ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Truth-Or-Die-Bloody-Disgusting-Selects/dp/B008IG0EQ8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Truth Or Die (Bloody Disgusting Selects)</a>"" which I think are the best two films they acquired!",1361404800,3,2315,5.102902374670185
5167565,5,B008IG0FVW,Really tense and suspenseful film.  It reminded me of the works of the Coen brothers.  The filming is very beautifully done and cinematic.  I was sitting at the edge of my seat throughout the whole film.  Its definitely worth the watch.,1361232000,,236,4.682926829268292
5167566,1,B008IG0FVW,"The trailer makes the movie more interesting than it actually is but I guess that is the point of the trailer?  Not much happens for the fist half of the movie.  The final climactic scene between the captive and captor is very short so not much suspense is built.  In addition, the movie is lacking in explanation.  It never explains who hires the cowboy or what the feud between Slim and the mechanic is all about.  The police question Slim but are never seen in the movie again.  Also, why didn't the girl go for the home phone as opposed to running for her cell phone?  And who hired the cowboy?
**SPOILER ALERT**
The movie opens with an older cowboy shooting a mechanic in the fact then drops his gun and leaves.  While driving the cowboy gets into a car accident with a young man on his way to his fianc's house.  Travis (the fianc) is injured severely and the cowboy suffers only a leg injury.  The cowboy notices lights on in a house not far away.  The house is the child hood home of Travis' fianc.  The cowboy breaks in and ties her to a chair.  Meanwhile, the police speak with a nightclub owner named Slim about the mechanic who was shot in the face.  Apparently, Slim and the mechanic were fishing friends and had a falling out.  The cowboy asks the girl the whereabouts of her car and she explains Travis has it.  He asks her about a motorbike and she explains Travis has the keys.  The cowboy then leaves to find Travis.  Upon finding, him takes the keys along with an engagement ring and bashes Travis in the head repeatedly.  Ahh but before the cowboy can make his escape he notices a car approaching and drags the body away into the woods and hides until the car passes.  The driver is none other than Slim who looks around and also spots the house and makes his way to the house.  Slim is looking for the cowboy and explaining to a man on the phone he has been set up.  (The gun the cowboy used was taken from Slim's bar.  Apparently, Slim realized this while drinking one night and looking at a piece of wood over a broken glass pane in the door of his office).  When Slim goes into the house (he just so happens to know the girl), he explains Travis is dead and is asking where the cowboy is when the cowboy comes up behind him and axes him in the neck.  The girl runs narrowly escaping a swing of the axe herself but manages to hide from the cowboy by sneaking out one window and back into the house only to find her hidden handgun.  Then it shows her hiding in the bathroom with the door closed and the gun pointed at the door.  The cowboy sees her feet under the bathroom door because she turns on the light but he just walks away.  When the girl thinks it is safe she opens the door and ventures downstairs where the cowboy comes up and pops her in the face with the side of the axe causing the girl to fall to the floor and the gun slide from her hand and land a few feet away.  The cowboy hobbles towards her wielding his axe and the girl crawls toward the gun.  Just as the cowboy is about to swing the girl gets to the gun, turns around and shoots the cowboy.  The cowboy drops the axe, falls against the wall, sliding down, and sits on the floor for a minute and the two are just looking at one another.  Then the cowboy reaches for his cocaine (I am guessing it is cocaine since it is a white powder in a little baggie with twist tie).  As he reaches for his drugs, the girl shoots again.  Then the cowboy reaches for the engagement ring and tosses it to the girl and again the two are staring at each other...the end!",1357776000,,3548,4.207407407407407
5167587,5,B008IG0FVW,Typical blood and guts horror movie!,1415923200,,36,5.166666666666667
5167588,4,B008IG0FVW,"I appreciate horror/thriller films with a unique plot. While other people may call this boring, this movie had the most suspense that ive ever sat through! I loved being on the edge of my seat not knowing what was gonna pop out of every corner! I really liked the music score throughout the film also, veryyyyy creeeeeepy! It started with a bang & ended with a bang! This is not your usual fright fest slasher movie but it does deliver in the suspense arena & did not disappoint me. If you are looking for something thats beautifully acted, with a cat & mouse chase, this is for you, check it out!",1413676800,,597,4.387387387387387

5167590,5,B008IG0FVW,"The acting and storyline was superb!  All 5 stars.  George Shevtsov and Georgina Haig were excellent! I don't think I've enjoyed a psycho thriller as much as this with very little dialogue...just intense editing, cinematography and sound.  This will take hold of you to the very end.  I loved every moment.  Chilling, riveting, believable and gruesome.  What more can a horror/gore fan ask for?  Great job Paul China.",1393632000,,417,5.044117647058823
5167591,5,B008IG0FVW,The only reason I purchased this video was because I like to see performances by actor George Shevtsov.  Otherwise I do not usually purchase horror films.,1381363200,,154,4.923076923076923
5167592,3,B008IG0FVW,"This review is from: Crawl (Bloody Disgusting Selects) (DVD)
George Shevtsov plays a slow and methodical Croatian hitman. Through circumstances he ends up broken down at Marilyn's (Georgina Haig) house. She is an employee of Slim (Paul Holmes) who hired ""the Croat"" to perform the hit. At this point we have the home break-in formula.

The film utilizes a 1950's suspense thriller soundtrack. There are attempts at dark comedy and symbolism that doesn't work too well. A quirky film that misses the mark.

Worth a rental.

Parental Guide: F-bomb. No sex. Blurred shower nudity, spanking. Drug use.",1378252800,2,597,5.134020618556701
5167593,2,B008IG0FVW,"Georgina Haig may arguably be compelling enough to watch her shovel dog feces for an hour or so. If you agree you're in luck, because that's basically what this movie is. For disclosure purposes I should admit to only managing to get halfway through the film. Other than watching Georgina Haig herself, there was no character I cared about and nothing really interesting. It's not scary, just boring. The name 'Crawl' is evocative and appropriate because I felt as if I was crawling through the film in agony myself just trying to get to the end. Georgina's work in the last season of The Fringe was outstanding but even she couldn't single handedly save this project despite a valiant effort. If you're looking for something in which a smart director casts her in a great film this is unfortunately not it. If you're just looking for a Georgina Haig slide show you're all set.",1375833600,9,877,4.701298701298701
5167594,5,B008IG0FVW,This is one great Movie. The story is good and it got a good flow all the way thru. AAAAAA++++++++,1374019200,,98,3.95
5167595,2,B008IG0FVW,"Marilyn Burns (Georgina Haig) is a waitress in a small town, waiting for her boyfriend Travis to come back. With a strange twist of fate, however, Marilyn Burns (yes, nod to a Tobe Hooper film) encounters someone else - someone just known as ""The Stranger"" (George Shevtsov), who has just finished his job. And he is a contract killer.

The measured pace and brooding mood of the Australian film may remind us of the Coen Brothers' film noir, and in some tense scenes the director's approach works, especially when Marilyn has to wait alone in a dim-lit room at night. But then we have to wait for something interesting to happen. It takes so long. When it does happen, with some unexpected moves on the part of the criminal, it is too late. The film is almost over.

""Crawl"" spends so much time about characters' traits before furthering the story. The problem is, the characters are not very interesting, and the story doesn't have much to offer. These characters find themselves crossing paths while getting involved in a crime, but why should we care? The premise itself is not bad; it is the slow and heavy-handed narrative that kills it.

""Crawl"" is generally atmospheric with some tense moments, but too slow and familiar.",1368662400,,1229,4.76056338028169
5167596,3,B008IG0FVW,"I always enjoy a good Aussie horror flick, and this wasn't too bad. I like the story, but the pace of it was too slow. There are certain horror flicks that work well when done like this, but this one isn't one of them. The character of ""The Stranger"" wasn't too believable for me. I mean, here's a guy that looks 60 yrs old, slow moving, but amazingly is strong enough to trek back and forth hundreds of yards wounded and bleeding. Now, I like his creepiness and very little dialogue as that adds to the mystery of his character. All in all, good enough to own.",1368403200,,561,4.252336448598131
