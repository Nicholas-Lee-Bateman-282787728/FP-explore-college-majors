3034830,5,B000YQK14K,"""Southland Tales"" is a sublimely, spectacularly awful movie.  Really, really, REALLY awful.  So awful, in fact, that it goes through awful and come out the other side, like Dante's ""Divine Comedy"" meets ""Plan 9 From Outer Space.""

I'm not ever going to try to recap the plot...it involves SoCal and the apocalypse.  Any deeper understanding and your brain will begin to melt.  It does help, though, to read the Prequel Saga (the graphic novel, available on Amazon but not in any bookstore I've gone into).  The Prequel Saga at least gives you a better picture of the world you're entering...a near future even more futuristic then we ever anticipated.

This movie works best when you simply consider it as a series of moments.  Think of it as several dozen very short films that are being presented together for your viewing pleasure.  Only then can you appreciate Krysta Now (Sarah Michelle Gellar, who uses a wide-eyed earnestness here that is so un-Buffylike that at first you hardly believe it's her) and her porn-star posse debating the ethics of abortion and quantum mechanics on a reality show on the beach.  Or Dion (Wood Harris) and Dream's (Amy Poehler with the fakest fake nose I've ever seen) hysterical ""domestic dispute.""  Or even the commercial where two SUVs get it on.  Yes, two cars f***.  I can't make this stuff up.

This movie has a great cast...I mean, Zelda Rubinstein!  Christopher Lambert!  Kevin Smith!  Granted, you barely get to see any of those people, because there are SO MANY PEOPLE in the cast that it's hard to keep track of them all.  (Watch for the looks on each actor's face.  They all have a sort-of stunned, ""what is this movie?  How did I get here?  What have I done?"" look on their faces.  Poor Sean William Scott looks like someone must have kidnapped his grandmother and forced him to do this movie as ransom.)  A few stand outs, though, were Justin Timberlake as Pilot Abilene--Timberlake drunkenly lip-sychs to The Killers ""All These Things That I've Done"" with a s***-eating smirk on his face that tells me that HE gets the joke that is this movie.  Also Cheri Oteri, who usually annoys the heck out of me but here plays a really annoying character who happens to be a sociopath.  Like I said, through awful and out the other side.

Music in this movie is fabulous...the aforementioned lip-synching might have been my favorite part of the movie (if god wanted to speak to ME, he'd probably do it through Killers lyrics, too).  Rebekah Del Rio (as herself) sings ""The Star-Spangled"" banner, and I felt the first stirrings of traditional patriotism that I've felt since 2004.  Moby provides an atmospheric score, which sounds basically like every other Moby song I've ever heard, but fits this movie very well.  And Kelley takes us to the credits with Blur's ""Tender,"" which was a great finish considering that the last 20-some minutes are the oddest bit in the whole film.

If this review hasn't scared you off, check it out at whatever indie-theater happens to be within 200 miles of you.  Definitely read the graphic novel FIRST or you'll  be even more lost.",1195344000,16,3105,4.7565543071161045
3034831,2,B000YQK14K,I got this for my girl because for some reason she really likes this movie. I remember watching it when it first came out and I thought it was stupid but I wanted to sit down and give it another try because I'm much older now and tastes change. Not on this movie though.

3034858,2,B000YQK14K,"I went into this movie knowing its insane backstory -- how director Richard Kelly (the man behind ""Donnie Darko"") was given ""carte blanche"" during the production, how he plotted a multimedia franchise that included a website and graphic novel prequels, how the film was panned at the Cannes Film Festival, and how it eventually sank into obscurity, taking Kelly's directorial career with it.  I had heard how it was supposed to be a barbed political and social satire, an allegory of the Book of Revelations, and a bold love letter to Philip K. Dick.  And I also heard how many people, from Internet critics to the very actors who starred in this thing, couldn't even begin to tell you what it was about.  And yet all this information just whetted my curiosity -- I had to know for myself whether it was as bad and insane as they said.

I can't say that I enjoyed this film, nor will I watch it again.  And the critics were right -- it's pretty bad and confusing.  And yet it'll stay with me for a long time, and will probably garner a cult following among people who enjoy weird cinema.

""Southland Tales"" takes place after a nuclear attack on Texas (who perpetrated said attack is never explained).  In the wake of the attack, the government declares martial law and turns the United States into a totalitarian state, while a wealthy scientist (Wallace Shawn) sets out to make a fortune from an ocean-generated power source he calls Fluid Karma in the hopes of usurping the oil industry.  The government is struggling to maintain an iron grip on the country and on the Internet, while a group of rebels calling themselves the Neo-Marxists fight to overthrow said government.  In the meantime, Fluid Karma is somehow ripping holes in the fabric of time and space, a fact the scientist is trying to both exploit and cover up.  And while all THIS is going on, an amnesiac actor (Dwayne Johnson) with ties to a powerful senator is teaming up with a porn star (Sara Michelle Geller) to write a screenplay that he hopes will change the world... if it doesn't destroy itself first.  Add Justin Timberlake as a brooding, Bible-quoting military sniper, Sean William Scott as twin brothers tentatively allied with the Neo-Marxists, Christopher Lambert as a crazy arms dealer peddling his wares from an ice cream truck, and a slew of ""Saturday Night Live"" alumni peppering the cast, and you have insanity on your hands.

Yeah, it's hard to describe this movie, because there's just SO freaking much going on.  It's difficult to know who's working with who, something not helped by the fact that alliances keep changing and betrayals keep popping up.  The director seems to think that packing everything he can possibly think of into one film is the best way to go, but all that does is make the movie a tangled and convoluted mess.  (The fact that the movie is only the second half of the story doesn't help -- Kelly expects people to read the graphic-novel prequels before watching the film, though said graphic novels were out of print by the time the film hit theaters.)  And the movie is NOT shy about throwing all kinds of symbolism and political commentary at the screen, mostly bashing Republicans and the Bush administration, and you get the feeling that the whole movie is trying to say something but thinks it's being smart by relying on allegory and metaphor to do it.  Sometimes this can work... but here it just makes an already confusing movie nearly impenetrable.

I do give the actors in this movie credit for trying, though many of them look rather bewildered as they play, as if they're not quite sure what's going on themselves.  Dwayne Johnson and Sean William Scott look particularly confused throughout the film, though it's hard to tell how much of this is their characters and how much is them going ""what on Earth did I sign up for?""  Some actors, like Sara Michelle Geller, seem to be phoning in their performances, while others, like Kevin Smith, Wallace Shawn and most of the SNL players, decide to have fun with their roles and ham it up as much as possible.  The actors who nail their roles the best would have to be Justin Timberlake and John Lovitz (the latter playing a cold-blooded murderous cop).  Both bring a sinister-ness and unexpected level of depth to their roles, and are surprisingly good actors for being a boy-band star and a snarky comedian respectively.  I wouldn't mind seeing either of these two in more dramatic roles in the future.

I see three major flaws with this movie aside from the confusing, convoluted plot.  The first is that the film is unable to stand on its own -- yes, the graphic novel prequels and the websites might give more information, but I shouldn't have to read a comic book to ""get"" a movie.  For a comparison, the movie ""Pacific Rim"" has a lot of information not included in the movie that adds to the experience, including graphic-novel prequels, but these aren't required reading to understand what's going on onscreen.  They're extras that people can enjoy once they're done with the film.  When a movie's incomprehensible without extra material outside the film, it's a failure in my eyes.

The second flaw is the director's ""throw everything at the screen and see what sticks"" approach to filmmaking.  I haven't seen ""Donnie Darko,"" so I don't know if that's his usual style, but here I get the feeling that Kelly couldn't bear to cut any ideas out of his screenplay and so just jammed everything he could into a single film.  Political satire, social satire, dystopian sci-fi, Biblical allegory, pop-culture parodies, apocalyptic thriller... this film tries way too much for even its generous two-and-a-half-hour runtime, and as such no single aspect gets the attention it deserves.  The entire film feels like several films cut apart and haphazardly stuck together, and that makes for a frustrating viewing experience.

The last flaw is the egocentric smugness that practically drips from every second of this film.  Despite the incomprehensibility of this film, it's very clear that Kelly had something to say, something he considered important enough to rub into the viewer's face at every opportunity.  And yet he didn't want to come right out and say it, but cloak it in metaphor and symbolism so he could crow ""you all just don't GET my genius!"" when questioned about it.  Maybe I'm alone in feeling this way, but I couldn't help but sense the director's arrogance as I watched, a nagging feeling that the director felt that if I couldn't understand his message, I just wasn't smart enough to appreciate his work.

Still... for all the confusion, madness, and director's ego that stank up this film, I know I'm not going to forget it anytime soon.  There's a weird sort of fascination that accompanies this movie, the sense that I'll never watch anything quite like this again.  It's a bizarre mishmash of sci-fi, satire, Biblical allegory, and passion project that throws weird scene after weird scene at the screen, and while these weird scenes rarely work, they do stick in one's mind, for better (Justin Timberlake's out-of-nowhere but memorable ""All These Things I've Done"" music video smack in the middle of the action) or for worse (the car commercial... just don't ask...).

It's hard to know who to recommend this film to, because I think most people would find it difficult to enjoy.  I'd say if you're a fan of bad or weird cinema, and you don't mind watching a movie and having no idea what's going on, give it a shot.  If nothing else, enjoy it for the madness of what's playing out onscreen, and the absurdity of seeing actors in roles that are completely against type.  Myself, I probably won't watch it again, and I can't say I really enjoyed it, but I'm certainly going to be thinking about it for a long time.  So I guess, in that respect, Kelly succeeded in making a memorable film, even if it's memorable for the wrong reasons.",1458691200,,7925,4.756756756756757

3034860,3,B000YQK14K,"I loved Donnie Darko, so I've always been interested in Richard Kelly's work. The Box had some interesting moving parts in it, but for the most part it was a swing and a miss. I never got around to watching Southland Tales because I don't remember it being in the theaters, it is never shown on TV and it didn't get good reviews. I knew it wasn't going to be great, so I really lowered my expectations. It was as if I was wincing before the movie started. It turns out, it wasn't as bad as some people made it out to be. Richard Kelly is one who loves detail, and ST is no different. I think some viewers get lost in the detail, but if you just kind of let go and let the story unfold, you can enjoy it for what it is.

Kelly likes to add supernatural elements to his stories, which played well in Donnie Darko and not so well in The Box. The supernatural stuff in ST was a little bit confusing and bizarre. It was hard to 'go with' the some of the stuff since it was hard to even know what was happening. The two scenes that stuck with me were actually the two with music and no dialogue/Plot: The music video in the arcade and the Star Spangled Banner. Both very surreal.

I say this movie is worth a watch, but I don't plan on seeing it again any time soon.",1457222400,,1260,4.056224899598393

The primary strength of the film is the visual imagery. The problem with the film is the story is absolutely nonsensical. You will give up on trying to follow it halfway through, but you will still finish the film. This is the same director that did Donnie Darko, another film that might have been a bit hard to follow  (unless you get the Director's Cut) and that film is the reason I got this film. This film is not nearly as good as Donnie Darko. I watch this film every couple of months or so because it is very escapist (think of Brazil by Terry Gilliam), but I have never considered it a masterpiece, but I do enjoy the film.

There are many references to film and literature, and even more self reference, and symbolism. Southland Tales is a universe unto itself. As such, it watches like a puzzle that you can get lost in over repeated viewings. Despite it's flaws (even Richard Kelley claims the film is incomplete) I find it fun to watch and I definitely enjoy that it doesn't limit itself to a particular genre or style. Some people will hate this. I find it liberating. Definitely not a standard or predictable film experience, so if that's what you want, you won't like it. I think this film will probably be vindicated over time (a long time) as people start to understand it better and is the social message becomes more prescient.",1420761600,,841,4.651006711409396

One was that there were too many voice-overs explaining what was happening. Writing the causes into the script as action would've helped clarify a lot better. The other was its coherency, or lack of it.  It all came together at the end but that was too long to wait.

I rented this because the previews were so intriguing. What I saw wasn't, though it definitely was confusing.  In an attempt at alternate energy, a scientist causes a rift in the Space-Time-Continuum. He decides a cop and a movie star will enter it (why?). They do, are duplicated and the cop and his twin escape but the movie star dies and his duplicate comes back.  That's about all I could coherently get from the plot.

Terrorist underground, voracious Southern politicians, movies stars, staged murders which turn out to be real, clones, double-crosses right and left, more false identities than you can shake a stick at, the Draf, a Justin Timberlake music videot...you name it, all shoved into 2 hours-plus which to my mind was two hours too much. All the rest seemed like an assignment in drama class...give a situation and let the actors device the rest...it all appeared just one big adlib.

Given the cast I expected something spectacular, and I admit the acting was first-rate, but from the story all I got was the statement made by the person with whom I watched it: Weird.

I've never seen this movie advertised anywhere except tacked onto the beginning of another rented DVD. Did it go straight to DVD?

Perhaps there were deep meaningful subplots and alleghorical subtexts, perhaps I was just too dense to spot them.  All I know is it was deeply disappointing.  I watched the entire movie hoping to get some coherency. I didn't get it, probably in more ways than one.

It's states several times in the movie that the world ends not with a whimper but a bang. In this particular world ended with: Huh?",1407369600,,2043,4.662952646239554

It's funny, has a star studded cast, and appears to be a fun romp. As you watch it, or perhaps after watching it a few times you will find that there is a plot, that it's a plot filmed in a way that the subtle nuances will not jump out but rather you have to be open to see them.

Those who want to be able to see it could ask Richard Kelly for a copy or delve into the world of torrenting and TPB...... enough said.

I like both versions. I think that if Richard Kelly was inclined/allowed to do a directors cut it would be a fuller, more satisfying production. The music is incredible and I will watch the movie even just to have it running in the background with the soundtrack drifting around the room in surround sound.

The entire story (including the graphic novels) would have benefited from a ""mini-series"" treatment where the missing elements could have been wound in. To try and get it all done in 2.5 hours was many a cut too far. The characters are great but the story misses some chunks, leading many people to label it as a confusing mess. I didn't think so and I was compelled to purchase the graphic novels to complete the story. Richard Kelly stated in the directors commentary that it takes more than one viewing to take in all of the sub-plots - which is true.

However, the first thing I noticed about this movie is that you couldn't take your eyes off it; it was fast paced and changed from scene to scene rapidly.  It is very entertaining, if nothing else.  The next thing that I noticed, and which I believe is both the mood and the tone of the movie, is that it is a little bit nutty.  If I am not mistaken, the mood is how the audience feels, and the tone is how the writer feels.  Both of them are a little cuckoo.  Watching the movie, you are like, WTF?

3034917,1,B000YQK14K,"This movie kind of hobbled around inside my head for the time I spent watching it, hoping to find a parking space. It did not succeed. ( Although there probably isn't much room in the noggin compartment - most of it being occupied by movie trivia and the 1970 World Cup of soccer.) So for all the WTF moments in the movie, all the arch references, all the intentionally bad costumes and bad lines there is no reaction.

So the only way to approach this movie is this - take it one thing (and I stress the meaning of ""thing"" here) at a time. One can only react to one shred of this movie at a time. Was a joke is really funny or not? Did a scene mean something or not? Did the time spent watching this bring about some non-random synaptic firing or not?

For me the answers arrived simply.  Not. Not. Not. Not. Not. (Additional nots added to ward off any additionally post-viewing thoughts this utter dreck of a movie might bring about beyond these few words.)

From what I have read there were huge choruses of boos for this movie when it was shown at Cannes. (Canned at Cannes so to speak.) This version of the movie apparently has had 20 minutes cut from the original which one might possibly surmise meant that some meaning, some gravitas, some something was subtracted from the film. Not. Not. Not. (Not. Not.)

There were some talented actors and some good comedians in this film, but nearly all of them end up being no funnier (or arcane) than their character names.

Richard Kelly directed this plotless shipwreck. He did another movie most people have seen - Donnie Darko. It was sort of off the wall, but you felt that it actually contained a few moments of actual drama, some points in that film were actually made, not slobbered on by a half-crazed beagle and left on your front doorstep as a wierd welcome to the day. But there is a faint hint of connective thread between DD and Southland Tales - one of absurdity or chaos or anarchy.

Then again probably Not. (Not. Not.)

3034937,1,B000YQK14K,"Wow. Just...wow. This movie is bad. No plot. No character development. No action. Bad special effects. Bad casting. Pointless asides. An ambiguous ending.

-- The plot: The plot held promise, but, like a runaway train, it quickly jumped the rails and ground to halt. That moment came about 15 minutes into the movie. Kelly tries to jam too much into a small space. It's a Feng Shui nightmare. The viewer has no chance to figure things out on his own throughout the movie, and even when the crap about two souls blah blah blah is revealed at the end, it makes no sense because it wasn't really set up earlier in the movie. There are some unique ideas, but they are buried under mountains of pointless drivel.

-- Characters: There's just too many, and Kelly gets trapped trying to tell all their stories in one film. Too many characters with too many undescribed plotlines/motives.

-- Action: There simply isn't any. It's just a bunch of talking, and because so many people are doing only small snippets of talking, nothing is really discussed/revealed/explained. Justin Timberlake's narration doesn't help, either.

-- Casting: I love John Lovitz; I think he's one of the funniest guys going. Cheri Oteri was great on SNL. I've got nothing against The Rock. Big fan of Amy Poehler. It feels like they're all trying WAY too hard to convince the viewer they ARE the characters they're playing. It doesn't work. I mean, if The Rock (as Boxer Santaros) is your main character, then you need to give him more to do that twiddle his thumbs (literally) and ask a bunch of questions (only to get ambiguous/undefined answers). Or is Justin Timberlake the main character? Then he needs to do more than drink beer and do music montages in the movie. (The last two sentences also can go with the whole plot thing).

The special effects truly are bad (what few of them there are), and why would I need a 5 minute Justin Timberlake video in the middle of my movie?

From the start, this movie goes straight downhill, and that's my assessment coming into it with no expectations. I mean, the whole thing is just a giant, jumbled mess.

It had such great potential. The cast had a ton of heavy hitters, many from comedy. A number of SNL alums had cameos or small parts. And of course, you have the team of Dwayne Johnson and Seann William Scott, who were hilarious in ""The Rundown"". You could make an entire review just naming the big names that were in this move. Seriously, take a look at this list, and then cry at the colossal waste of talent that was this movie.

I thought surely with the two stars that they had, having recently done such a great comedy together, that this was going to be comedy gold. I thought that every time a new star appeared, most well known for their comedy. I thought that right through the first hour. By that point, I figured out it wasn't supposed to be a comedy. Ok, so what, right? So it's not a comedy, that's ok. The problem is, I spent the rest of the movie trying to figure out what it actually was. I never did. The plot was incomprehensible and convoluted. It felt like watching tv with someone sitting on the remote making the channel change every few minutes. Actually, that would have been more entertaining.

In short, this movie is a tragedy.

Now the most helpful critical reviewer hearkened the director to having "" David Lynch-like aspirations "" and if this director wants to be the next Lynch, TRUST ME HE ISN'T WILL NEVER BE, NOT EVEN CLOSE.  At first, AND I DO MEAN AT FIRST, the post-apocalyptic, socio-nihilism and utter ridiculousness of this movie made me think of the 80's counter-culture classic "" They Live "", starring yet another former professional wrestler ( why is it that pro wrestlers always make these movies make sense?  Probably because of the bizarre social conundrum of their profession, I guess ), in that case being "" Rowdy "" Roddy Piper.  But where "" They Live "" succeeded in totally lampooning and lambasting the Conservative establishment of the 1980's, "" Southland Tales succeeds only in poking fun at the basest, most controversial and transperent aspects of the Conservative movement ( neo-fascism, totalitarianism, greed, the blase attitudes of the top families, etc.) and doesn't really offer ANYTHING substantial as an alternative.  So the Republicans are greedy, fascist pigs who send healthy, young and bright American kids to the wars in ( by this time, pretty much all of this Middle East and North Korea ) and so what has that brought about, a NEO-MARXIST REVOLUTION LED BY PORN STARS, ANGRY FEMINISTS AND BIZARRE SURFER DUDES FROM MALIBU???

The picture quality is blu ray worthy, sharp and clear with great detail. 2. It comes with the Prequel Graphic Novel.

3034951,2,B000YQK14K,"This is the way ""Southland Tales"" is told, I presume.  In a not-too-distant future (around a couple of years back?), a series of nuclear bombs in American soil caused the entire nation to declare martial law, then announce World War III and go hostile in other countries.  Within the Southland of California, it's overseen by a home security organization called USIDent, controlled by midgets and people wearing transparent raincoats.  USIDent is in cahoots with an environmental group called Treer, helmed by that kidnapper from ""Princess Bride"", who created a reusable energy called Karma Fluid, and both parties are in support of a government candidate for a state election.  However, these groups are under attack by a local territory group called Neo-Marxists, and they had a trump card in the form of an amnesiac movie star named Boxer Santaros.  Boxer had ties with the government candidate, but is currently bunking with a porn-star who helped him write a script about the Earth slowing its rotation, same porn-star who's in league with the Neo-Marxists.  The script was leaked and provoked a fangirl from USIDent to pretend as one of the script characters to tell Boxer where to go, and elsewhere the Neo-Marxists hired a look-alike from a kidnapped soldier to watch over Boxer and involve in a staged murder, but the murder was real for the sake of blackmailing.  Boxer lead his own way to Treer to discover the parallels of his script and realized the global conundrum in regards to the experimental dimensional vortex and bjsjiesfsjsdwjkdso---okay, what is this, ""Syriana""?

As convoluted as ""Donnie Darko"" was, at least that movie had a simple pitch: a kid escaped from certain death which lead into mysterious anomalies and he has the power to make the ultimate choice to keep his world at bay.  Richard Kelly went too far on making a complicated story too difficult to summarize, it's as zany as its casting choice.  Speaking of the cast, I've never seen such an unbalanced slew of actors.  I'm not expecting a well-rounded ensemble like ""Short Cuts"" or ""Boogie Nights"", but I expect better actors to be in a chaotic premise than Amy Poehler, Jon Lovitz and Will Sasso; it's like watching one-half of an SNL team and the other-half of an MTV clique dealing with a so-called serious crisis.  Maybe it's due to the budget that this movie has such a cast, but no matter how hard they tried, the actors just can't get into their roles with ease.  Although, I do give props on having&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Russell-Nash/dp/B001JFZ118/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Russell Nash</a>&nbsp;in this film, given that I haven't seen him in a while.

The problem with ""Southland Tales"" isn't the fact that it's confusing, but rather how disjointed it is.  None of the mini-plots have any kind of connection with the overall theme of endness, it's a bizarre series of kidnappings, blackmails, and reality shows; a couple of scenes don't even add anything, like the part where a character declared to be pregnant but nothing came from it, and a boring dream sequence with Justin Timberlake in a musical.  The movie's tagline is 'this is the way the world ends', and yet all I'm seeing is a world on riots; I'm sure Southern California has been having riots plenty of times and it's still doing fine.  The incomprehensible ending left me with nothing to think about, especially with the unfocused preceding events.  It's so unreal, not to mention how long this film is, that it became boring.

I should appreciate Richard Kelly for being ambitious, and the film is well-shot, but the result was such a garbled mess; it's almost like a parody of complicated films, yet the director calls it a political satire which stopped being it after the terms 'the world's rotation slowed down'.  ""Southland Tales"" is too rocky and incongruous to give it any kind of thought, nothing intriguing to give it a second viewing.",1277251200,4,3959,5.033690658499235

Certainly the most confusing movie I've seen, this film instantly landed a spot in the top 5 worst films I have fallen victim to.

How did it get made?  That's the real mystery.  There weren't better scripts out there?  I could write a better script if I simply sat on the keyboard.  (Believe it or not, after this turd, somebody actually gave this guy money to direct another movie -- although not based on his script.)

It's like they gave a 14-year-old kid millions of dollars to make a movie and a single afternoon to write a script.  The script has no ideas or insight about anything -- terrorism, war, the media, the political machine, Marxism, you name it.  The movie is impossible to take literally (everybody's looking for Boxer, yet he can just go to a sidewalk cafe?), yet has nothing coherent to say on any allegorical level.

There are too many characters and the connections between them are unclear.  That voiceover guy seems to never stop introducing the movie, which initially reassures you since you're constantly confused, but clarity never comes.

Plus it just goes on forever.  Supposedly Andrew O'Hehir called this film ""about the biggest, ugliest mess I've ever seen.""  Lou Lumenick of the New York Post wrote of it, ""If a more incoherent and self-indulgent movie has been released so far this century, I'm not aware of it.""",1276732800,4,1530,4.720754716981132

3034958,2,B000YQK14K,"Southland Tales lacks any focus whatsoever. If Richard Kelly could do basic math, he would have realized that with about 30 characters in his movie, even with a 2.5 hour running time, that gives each one an average of 5 minutes of screen time. If he knew the first thing about ensemble storytelling, he would have realized that each one of those characters has a story. And I'm not saying that 5 minutes isn't enough time to tell a story, but when you're watching 30 different five-minute ""Tales"" chopped up and strewn together at random, you spend half your time just keeping track of everyone. Did Miranda Richardson even have any lines? or did she just sit there looking menacing the whole time? Likewise, Justin Timberlake's character didn't seem to serve any purpose, and the movie would have been better off without him, although he does spend the last seconds of the movie telling us his relationship to Sean William Scott's character, which he has to TELL us because Richard Kelly never SHOWS them in a scene together. Can you tell I was frustrated with this movie?

The most hilarious part of the disc is the bonus featurette, in which about half the cast confesses that they too had no idea what the movie was about or how their character fit into it. Richard Kelly might argue that the movie is about chaos, and therefore it should be disjointed. Perhaps that's true--and let that be a lesson to every filmmaker out there: don't make a movie about chaos, unless you want it to suck. What this movie is really about, though, is The End of The World (as the characters themselves tell us over and over, with all the subtlety of a a dead-horse-beating, ""It ends not with a whimper, but with a bang""). In other words, Richard Kelly is really just recycling the same time-travel narrative that worked so well in Donnie Darko.

From the reaction of many of the actors it seemed that they were in doubt also. So many of them seemed lost as if they didn't know what the film was about. That's understandable. I've never seemed such a confused, meandering mess- even the excessive voice-over narration (always a bad sign) didn't help unravel it.

So many big (and formerly big) names were associated with this. And they all seemed to be going their own way independent of each other. Since so many of them were Saturday Night Live alums perhaps they were improvising the script as they went along...

I mean, I enjoy unconventional films but this one just seemed to degenerate to an ego-fueled freakshow with everyone doing his own thing with the barest nod to a plot tieing it all together. I know that they were trying to make a political statement here about the war and neoconservatism in general, but it really didn't work. It came across as a street circus embarassement. So many people trying to make ""hip"" social comments while endulging in shameless self promotion for the next project. Perhaps this truly is the soul of ""Southland.""

If you want to mine this over-long freakshow (even editing would not have helped) for a few comedic and visual gems then go ahead, but it might be a less painful experience if you get stoned first.

You blink your gone! The story-line is well worth following post 911 paranoia gone mad. To be honest every time I hear that rhetoric I think of Star Wars... ""The more you tighten your grip the more they slip through your fingers..."". I apoligize kinda ranted a bit there..lol. Anyways, Every actor in this film gives their most to their performance.

Southland Tales has a ton of social commentary mixed into a genius plot about the end of the world.  It's a satire and a black comedy, but mixes many genres along the way. You will need to see this more than once to understand it, because it reveals info that explains why the characters were acting so wierd before.

If you like movies that make you think, this is definetly one of them.  It also doesn't try much to explain itself, assuming a mature audience.  I hate seeing most movies, because they are fluffed-up and brainless wastes of time.  I really, really love this movie and it's probably the best movie of the decade.

I would say this is a mix of Vonnegut, Philip K Dick, Brazil, and the Bible (of all things).  Kelly can die a happy man because he made this movie.",1243900800,,922,4.376470588235295

Perhaps all that's necessary is a good editor to bring out the film that was clearly intended; one that's an over-the-top satire of 21st century life. In this world, porn stars, terrorists, politicians, cops, and A-list Hollywood actors often cross paths and form alliances on their way to fulfilling their various narcissistic agendas. They roam around, self-absorbed and self-unaware, grasping toward whatever decadent trinkets tickle their fancy, while the world is literally about to end.

Unfortunately, somewhere along the way the entire thing just became muddled and incomprehensible. Which is a shame, because with the writer/director of Donnie Darko at the helm and a slew of varied talent in the film, it really could have been something great.",1239753600,,840,5.412213740458015
3034981,1,B000YQK14K,"At some point I thought 'Southland Tales' was an ironic commentary on the Writer's Guild strike.  Was that the film's intention?  To show how poorly a movie could really be written?  Apparently, after reading about the film, this was not what Richard Kelly had in mind.

'Southland Tales' tries to be a dark comedy.  If you ignore this review and watch the film, you will find yourself wondering why it was cast with an endless stream of comedic actors.  Eventually you will come to understand that you should be knowingly laughing along with the mudddled mish-mash of ""hijinx.""  But, it just isn't funny and when dark comedies aren't funny, they end up being repugnantly bad.

And what's with all the David Lynch comparisons that keep popping up in regards to this film?  The possibility that you will enjoy this as a ""Lynch fan"" is incomprehensibe.  I think enjoying a Lynch film requires some aesthetic sensibilty and that sensibility would be completely offended by this lowbrow, incoherent, sophomoric barrage.  Any comparisons to Lynch are completely unfounded.  Furthermore, Lynch does not incorporate current events and ""E-news"" style cultural references in his films.  Which brings me to my next criticism.

'Southland Tales' (released in 2007 and set in the future - 2008!?!?) feels horribly dated. I fear this represents the retarded development of Richard Kelly.  It is as though Kelly has not grown out of the cultural milieu of his teen years.  The film is a jumbled mess of ""non-actors"" and TV comedians that made me think Kelly was casting heros from his adolescence for the sole purpose of expanding his autograph collection.  I'm sure Kelly will eventually be exposed as a dweeb with little depth whose desire to meet ""the Rock"" never should have been an excuse for making an insufferably bad movie.  Think Tarantino and Travolta... only way, way, way worse than 'Pulp Fiction'.

Easily in the running for the worst film of (at least) the last decade, the fact that a film with a clear anti-Bush agenda was derided at Cannes says that there is no audience anywhere in the world for 'Southland Tales'.  In retrospect, Kelly's second feature film makes one consider reassessing his first.",1238630400,12,2204,4.969945355191257

There are some funny parts like the Killers video in the middle but it doesn't make up for the mountain of bad things.

It's got all the kook tyranny of goverment stuff that was constant and viral from the left about the Bush administration as a sub-plot... at least the first 20 minutes did.

3034985,5,B000YQK14K,"Southland Tales is not your typical science fiction movie. It's not your typical thriller, or even your typical independent film (if there is such a thing). I don't know exactly what kind of film this is, and I don't think the creators of Southland Tales really know either. One thing for sure, this film is hysterical, as long as you don't take it too seriously.

Richard Kelly follows his dark cult film Donnie Darko with this portrait of an alternate version of America where darker events and imaginative technological developments have led to a more extreme version of the present day. Terrorist acts on American soil beyond 9/11 have led to more US military incursions around the globe and greater governmental control over civil liberties. It is mid-2008, and people connected to the Iraq war and the upcoming Presidential election are involved in a mysterious technological/mystical/religious/drug -addled conspiracy. The film centers on Boxer Santaros, a movie star married to the candidate for vice presidency's daughter, who suffers from amnesia. He finds himself in the company of Krystal Now, a porn star branching into the reality show/music/energy drink  business, who tells him he's directing and producing a thriller about the end of the world based on his own screenplay, which she has actually written herself. And the storyline gets much more convoluted from there.

The best way to make sense of this movie is to read Southland Tales: The Prequel Saga, a graphic novel written by Richard Kelly, which covers the events prior to the movie. No wait, it still won't make much sense. Well, it will at least explain some of the loose ends in more detail, such as how the characters got into the situations they're in at the beginning of the film: how Pilot Abilene (Justin Timberlake) and Roland Taverner (Seann William Scott) ended up in a friendly-fire incident that scarred them both; how the body in the box ended up in Simon Theory (Kevin Smith)'s possession; and what the heck Santaros mumbles when he gets overwhelmed. Reading the graphic novel will lessen (not eliminate) the number of times you say ""Huh?"" while watching, but nothing will stop the ever increasing times, as the movie continues, you'll  say ""What?"" in greater frequency and volume.

And therein lies the charm of this crazy, patch-work quilt of a movie. As you watch, you'll find yourself moving from willing disbelief to confusion to frustration and then to utter hysteria as the farcical nature of the labyrinthine story line overwhelms you. This will be easier for some to accept than others, for Richard Kelly didn't really intend for Southland Tales to so absurd, but unfortunately that's what it ends up being. The antics of the characters, and the depictions by the actors, are more and more hilarious as the film goes on.

There are too many uniquely memorable scenes and lines to encapsulate here, but some of the best are: Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson's depiction of Santaro's nervous fidgeting; Cheri Oteri as a psychotic henchman, accompanied by a deadpan Jon Lovitz channeling Rutger Hauer channeling Hannibal Lecter; Amy Proehler (from Saturday Night Live - theres's a lot of Saturday Night Live alumni here) and Wood Harris (from ""The Wire"") pretending to be a bride and groom in a domestic disturbance; Chris Lambert dealing arms out of a ice cream truck; Seann William Scott playing twin brothers who are both constantly injected with designer drugs causing them to interrupt their deadpan deliveries with cross-eyed collapse (over and over again); Wallace Shawn as a mad scientist wearing mascara and his thinning hair moussed into a curlicue on his forehead; Bai Ling revealing a hideous mole (apparently real) in her plunging (no, more like missing) neckline;  and one of my favorite actresses, Sarah Michelle Gellar, as Santoro's scheming porn-star love interest, delivering her lines with a waifish tone and ""come hither"" look. Gellar, and all the actors, do the best they can with the script, better suited for the world of comic books, but they can't keep the film from devolving into an unintentionally ridiculous commentary on the policies of Bush administration, and the director's view of the world Bush and his people tried to create.

Watching the film as a serious attempt as political commentary melded with futuristic science fiction will lead to frustrated disappointment, but the viewer who is looking for a wacky, comic-book-style ensemble performance will find the 2 and  hour film (that's 2  hours, be prepared for that) a enjoyable release from reality, even worthy of repeated viewing. If you're in the right frame of mind, you'll find tons of moments to talk about after the film is finished, like whether Gellar meant to sway on her high heels as she walks away in one scene, or Johnson's  personal belief about suicide, or Justin Timberlake's singing and dancing interlude (yes, that's right). If you come to this film knowing what it's like, then, like the red-headed stepchild of the family or the runt dog of the litter, it may soften your heart and become a favorite of yours.",1232668800,6,5111,5.022432113341204
3034986,3,B000YQK14K,"David Lynch is great. If you want to see a Lynch movie then watch Lynch. If you have seen all of lynch but want more then there are a few art-house pictures out there that meet those needs including the rare Hollywood outing. Southland Tales is one of those rare outings but you have seen it done better and there is a possibility that you might not like it all but you won't know until you have tried. If you like Lynch then the chance is that you will enjoy it somewhat. At the same time I have seen art-house fans walk away from this film so it's really a gamble. If you absolutely must need a coherent film then avoid it at all costs.

Southland Tales is a cross between The Fifth Element without the aliens, Strange Days and a dash of Beverly Hills 90210 on acid. It has anti-Bush messages, conspiracy theories, a biblical apocalypse and lots of sexual swearing. The story is almost impossible to discern but is about a Marxist movement in future L.A that is trying to topple a post-patriot act government by filming one of theirs in a compromising position with a porn star and a double-murder. There are so many side stories involving twins, perpetual motion, screenplays, drugs, snipers,  time travel and ice cream van gun dealers that it is impracticable to say what Southerland Tales is about but that isn't a bad thing. After all weird can be good.

However Southerland Tales does go wrong at times and this is undeniable fact evident by its urgent reworking in the edit room after being seriously mauled at the Cannes film festival by its critics, many of whom reckoned it was the worst film they had ever seen. Many of those critics though have since said that this version of Southerland Tales is much better with some even going so far as to say it is in so much better shape as to be deemed entertaining. In all fairness it is amusing but there are many times when the acting fails it to the point where you think those involved are deliberately trying to be contrived. Seeing The Rock tap his fingers together constantly during the second half simply looks plain dumb. There are many moments like that to put you off. In short, the director is to blame, which is a shame, because Donnie Darko is very cool.

However the director is young and this is only his second movie and let's face it, Southland Tales is better than a lot of what is on the shelves today. There are plenty direct to video releases that are simply blown away by the imagination and creativity that has gone into Southland Tales. It might not be Lynch, in fact it is categorically not, but being weird can't always to live up to such high standards of the unusual. This film will grow in time and maybe in a decade have a nice enough following to suggest that maybe you should have taken a peak while it was out. If you like odd then why not?",1232668800,5,2829,4.424184261036468
3034987,4,B000YQK14K,"This is NOTHING like Lynch, it is a postmodern movie, similar to the books Naked Lunch, by William Burroughs or Gravity's Rainbow by Pynchon. Pop references abound - half the movie is populated by Saturday night Live actors, mixing genres and even media, the first three chapters of the story can be found only in the `prequel' graphic novel, the movie starts in the middle much like star wars. Many of the actors seem to be in on the joke, cracking smiles knowingly. It deconstructs itself as we watch it, cannibalizing other movies as it goes. The Rock plays a superstar actor, which he actually is in real life, the movie almost spills into reality, it never lets you forget that this is all a farce, fake, a movie - and then shows you that real life in many ways is also a farce. In a nod to David Lynch Rebekah Del Rio sings in a scene, as she does in Mulholland Drive. The movie even recycles certain time travel elements from the director's first movie Donnie Darko. It's pop culture turned in on itself, Shakespeare's play within a play, or the postmodern creed of ""Nothing is true. Pop cult personality Kevin Smith plays the leader of a neo-marxist group, the movie doesn't even pretend to take itself seriously yet the issues really are deadly serious. Like the Media and pop culture its turns the world's issues, even the world itself, into one giant false spectacle. Postmodern author J.G. Ballard, author of Crash, in 1970 predicted that within a few years we'd all be living in one giant T.V. studio. The news and media now define our consensus of what reality is, we are told and sold on what's really going on. Dance pop star Justin Timberlake parodies himself, reflecting the ugliness of MTV culture his face is scarred, he does an MTV style video musical number of The Killer's ""All These Things That I've Done."" He also plays an Iraq war veteran, which shows how commercialized and vulgarized war has become, its now practically entertainment: ""I think I'll turn on CNN and watch the War show."" So, within a self-referencing postmodern context I think it succeeds as a critique of our post 911, post Christian (the movie repeats twice that the NY times has reported that god is dead) world which has no center and the distinction between reality and media is becoming blurred. The candidate's for president and vice-president have the last names Frost/Eliot, both Robert Frost and T.S. Eliot are quoted throughout, Frost being the last modernist poet, while Eliot wrote the first postmodern poem - `The Wastelands,' which this film somewhat resembles in spirit.

Pulling a coherent narrative out of this mess would require more effort on my part than writer / director Richard Kelly apparently made to put one in.

There are some excellent visuals here and it can be fun to play ""spot the recognizable character actor,"" but I'll be darned if I know what it was about.  With so many pointless and inconclusive subplots going on, I just became bored after a while, but I stuck it out to the end, which left me unenlightened.

Did terrible at the box office, and even now has a growing army of fans.  10 years from now, it'll probably be shown regularly at college campuses at midnight, with people showing up dressed as different characters from the film, and shouting the lines at the screen.

It's like that.  If you don't like it after 15 minutes, don't bother. If dark satire about how vain and screwed up American culture is annoys you, don't bother. If wild free form interpretation of scripture bothers you, don't bother. But if you watch it and something gets under your skin, watch it again.  Watch it 7 times.  It gets clearer and clearer what it's about the more you see it, because it's just too dense to get in one sitting. I didn't really 'like' it the first time I saw it, but I was intrigued by the different layers of subtext, just enough to watch it again.  Then I started to really laugh at the jokes...

What's it about?  It's a pop culture free poem about Los Angeles, mostly, and the post 9/11 ultra-right mentality.  It's very much about the Revelation of St. John, and the 2 main characters would seem at different points to be Jesus or John. And it's a hardcore black comedy.
It's the Anti-""Magnolia"", really.  It's a bunch of vain, disparate characters intersecting in a way that brings about the end of the world.

If that's your cup of tea, jump in.  ;)  But don't be fooled by the fact that this film appears to be a thrown together impromptu mess, it's not.  It's deeply layered, and carefully put together.. it's just hard to see it on one casual viewing.

The Blu ray transfer is lovely, though you will notice a little grain in some of the composite effects near the end (smoking buildings, etc).

A nice bonus to this release is the inclusion of the 'Southland Tales Prequel Saga' on the disc.

I won't attempt to explain the plot to you, just read the tag ""This is the Way the World Ends"", nuff said.

If you do become a fan of this film, I would highly recommend the graphic novel tie-in, which is actually the first 3 chapters of the movie (Kelly took a cue from George Lucas and began in the middle of the story). It makes the setup much easier to understand, and contains elements that would have been much too expensive to film with the budget they had.

I am the type of person that will usually see the good points in any film, be it a classic like 'Casablanca' or C-Grade movies like ""From Justin to Kelly"". But it was impossible to find any such merits with this film. I truly believe that the makers of this film intended it to be watched while dropping acid. That is the only way this film could have been understood. While I saw the long list of actors as a positive (after all, they must have read the script and gave carefull consideration as to its worth) but in the back of my mind, a concern itched that too many main characters might make the film hard to follow. DUH! So, they had a few dozen story lines going in completely different directions, each one with its bizarre futuristic twist, and unbelievable scenarios, and at times the dialogue was so bad I almost believe the writers were trying to invent their own language. At the end of the movie, my boyfriend and I sat, jaw-slacked at the sheer incredibility of what we had seen. We could not describe it else to anyone we had seen, but only to say that watching it for free (we had a free rental) was a complete waste of our time and we sorely regretted the two hours (was it really two? seemed like 10) of hour lives we wasted that we will never get back.

You learn about the actual characters in the film more by observing their on screen behavior and settings than by being ""told"" their true motives and connections in a flat out obvious way.

The subplots converge at the end of the film. At its core it shows how subculture A connects with subculture B connects with subculture C and so on and yet how each individual simultaneously functions as a separate entity with their own personal motivations. If you are impatient only knowing bits and pieces of how who and what fits in with this and that throughout the movie you won't like it.

We get to learn what makes the characters tick and what makes them human by observing them in action. We don't get many long soliliqueys about what their ""thoughts"" happen to be. Imagery in the sets/costumes and the actor's facial expressions/body language express more about the inner feelings of the characters than the dialogue. The cast gave excellent performances.

The sets in this move were very well done - be sure to check them out when you watch it the second time through.

Again, it's really about all the subplots of groups of people - how they occaisionally interwine and everything only makes perfect sense at the very end of the film. I enjoyed it thoroughly.",1218672000,5,1674,4.683673469387755
3035000,2,B000YQK14K,"Set in post-nuclear Southern California (the Southlands), this film tells the stories of a number of different characters - in particular, amnesiac actor Boxer Santaros (Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson), porn star Krysta Now (Sarah Michelle Geller), and twin police officers Roland and Ronald Taverner (Seann William Scott) -  with the actions of all of these characters ultimately leading to the grand finale of the end of the world.

Many of the elements of this film will be familiar to those who have already seen ""Donnie Darko""; once again Kelly deals with time travel, politics and the apocalypse. However, he did a lot better job of dealing with them in his first film. As many other reviewers have pointed out, ""Southland Tales"" is barely coherent. The individual scenes within the film aren't actually all that bad , and I enjoyed many of them while I was watching this film (the scene in which Justin Timberlake drunkenly lipsyncs his way through ""All These Things That I've Done"" made the film worth my time), but together a lot of it really doesn't make all that much sense. Some of what is going on is explained in the final half-hour of the film, and I was pretty proud of myself for being able to explain 75% of the plot. Nevertheless, I haven't the faintest idea what any of it means - although, for the record, that didn't actually bother me all that much. I did like this film, I just don't think it's great and I didn't like it enough to rewatch it in order to understand it better.

""Southland Tales"" is worth watching once, if you happen to be a Richard Kelly fan, or a fan of one of the multitude of big name actors in this film (it still puzzles me how Kelly managed to convince so many top actors to appear in this film - even if you like it, you would have to agree that it's not exactly mainstream), and your expectations aren't too high. However, it's probably best to rent this one first and see if you like it, before you hand over the chunk of your hard-earned cash necessary to become the proud owner of this film on DVD.",1218499200,,2046,4.509433962264151
3035001,3,B000YQK14K,"Southland Tales is such a bizarre, gonzo trip into dystopic apocolypse lunatic comedy-musical-sci-fi-stoner-headtrip-thriller land, it seems beside the point to even try and register it as good or bad.  The flaws are evident and intetional - most of the time, I'm fairly convinced the movie dares you to even try to like it.  I'll try and make as quick of a synopsis of the plot as I can make - there was a nuclear attack in Texas, the world's at war, we're out of oil, there's a solution but it might throw the earth off its axis a bit and it's spearheaded by a crazy-looking freak played by Wallace Shawn who has a fondness for TV ads involving cars having sex (seriously).  Also, there's the Boxing/movie star hunk who's the son-in-law of the Democratic vice-presidential candidate who's got amnesia and is shacking up with a porn superstar who's vaguely connected to a group of marxist rebels attempting to dissuade a congressional vote on... something... and also Seann William Scott is an infiltrating set of identical twins... who's also doing something.  Oh, and Justin Timberlake narrates with cryptic quotes from the Book of Revelations.  So, to put it mildly, the movie's plot is excessive, tough to swallow, and teeters back and forth from being completely over the top and just-sorta acceptable.  And the casting - from The Rock, Cheri Oteri, Jon Lovitz, Amy Poehler, Mandy Moore, Nora Dunn, Sarah Michelle Gellar, and John Larroquette in main roles - is even more ridiculous.  Still, with so much easy to dismiss the movie, it's hard to say it doesn't have drive, and just when the movie veers over the cliff, a scene of extraordinary humor or emotion pops up and surprises you.  Sarah Michelle Gellar and Nora Dunn in particular are given scenes of just outrageous lines (says Gellar on her hot-topic porn talk show, ""Violence is a big problem in today's society.  That's the primary reason I won't do anal""), and their scenes are viciously entertaining.  One extraordinary over the top scene finds Gellar, The Rock, and Moore trading one-ups in something that's like a soap opera gone drug-addled.  And the scene to truly savor is the weirdest - a music video in an arcade hall in which Justin Timberlake's wounded, crazy drug addict war hero lipsynchs and parties to The Killer's ""All These Things That I've Done.""  That scene takes the movie's drug-trip kitsch and makes it electrifying, letting Timberlake's scarred face and dark, desperate eyes somehow reveal a life within the confines of a crazy dance number.  Such an aberration, it electrifies the movie around it as it veers away from rational explanation and silliness and back again in its 2 1/2 hours.  I'd say this movie - ridiculous and wonderful in spurts - clocks in somewhere over the 50% mark, making the rewards slightly greater than the work you have to do to put up with the movie.",1216598400,,2868,4.838445807770961

Please watch those movies if you want to watch a good movie.

One of the posted reviews compares this movie to ""Brazil.""  That is an insult to ""Brazil.""  Other reviewers said it contains great symbolism.  Great symbolism does NOT mean a great movie.  This movie is proof of that.  Technically speaking, a 90 minute montage of swastikas is great symbolism too, but I do not want to watch that either.  If you want truly great symbolism, please watch Pink Floyd's movie ""The Wall.""

Justin Timberlake is in this movie.  I am so sick of seeing him in movies.  I refuse to see any future movies in which he is a cast member.  It is a shame that Heath Ledger passed away and Justin Timberlake is still with us.

This movie had one redeeming scene that prevented me from tossing out the DVD.  That is the scene where Cheri Oteri beats up an arms dealer.  I LOVED that scene.  I am a big fan of Cheri Oteri.  I will always look forward to seeing her in a movie.

I also expected much better from Dwayne Johnson.  This is the only movie of his that has disappointed me.

I flat out refuse to watch any movies from the guy who directed this phenominal waste of money.  Hollywood should get together and throw this guy out of Hollywood.

3035005,5,B000YQK14K,"I want to preface this review with a humble mention of Suckerdwsp316's earlier offering. I almost replied positively to that, but I think Southland Tales deserves a little more defence out here. I won't be rehashing other reviews here, either. I won't be discussing what the movie is 'about', its plot or characters. While these are important factors, I think Southland Tales deserves a slightly more critical approach.

Okay -- first things first: I saw Donnie Darko well after the initial wave of bad reviews, well after it became a cult hit. I saw it simply because I'd heard it was a unique experience that left your brains in a puddle. I hate to say this but statements like that don't always move me; I've done the English Lit. thing, read some pretty unfriendly things (Joyce, Woolf, Stein, etc.etc.). But Donnie Darko convinced me that Kelly is a genius. No problem there whatsoever. Not was -- is.

So this is what I'm not getting: if a movie that bombed at first took a few years to be 'discovered' (and by some of you, no doubt) and then was recognised as a work of brilliance, why is everyone doing it all over again now? As I watched Southland Tales for the first time (just last night), I had this incredible feeling that I was riding the wave I missed with Donnie Darko. That someday, when people catch up, I could say to myself 'ah, I saw this coming'.

In their review, Suckerdwsp316 mentions other films that failed at the box office but became hits (blade runner, perfect example). I want to take this a bit further and reference James Joyce's Ulysses, which was banned for years for its crudeness/pornography and got panned by a who's who of the in-crowd of literature back in the 1920s. Without guidance and a real sense of patience, Ulysses is a trainwreck to read. It switches POV, voice, tense, style...you name it. And then, because writing the most difficult English novel wasn't enough for Joyce, he followed it up with Finnegans Wake, which makes Ulysses look almost linear.

'Southland Tales' may be considered Kelly's Finnegans Wake. One review elsewhere on the web stated that ST isn't 'about' chaos -- it *is* chaos. This is precisely what is said about Wake, and it's part of what makes it virtually unreadable. Thankfully, the film medium has a lot more to offer at 'first glance' than the written, and Southland Tales is entirely more accessible than Joyce's work. Whether you take it as a bad mish-mash of Saturday Night Live skits, a strange pastiche of weird sci-fi and socio-political commentary or as a wannabe-Darko, ST still allows itself to be judged as something more than utter chaos.

And if at this point you're thinking 'My God, this reviewer is some uppity academic artsy-fartsy wanker', I guess the only thing I can say in my defence is I didn't (and would hate to) watch this film alone, or even with another 'academic'. I *despise* 'art' that asks you to make more of what is there than actually is; Southland Tales does quite the opposite, and it's a clever trick that is almost as pretentious. You have something fairly simple told in a very convoluted, complex way. Again, here we have a parallel to Ulysses, which is about a guy who wanders around Dublin, masturbates a lot, drinks himself stupid and is fairly certain his wife is cheating on him.

Southland Tales isn't high art -- it's pop, it's crass, it's horribly post-modern, it's politically saturated. The miscasting is too obvious and it works (especially Mandy Moore and 'The Rock'), which raises questions of whether it's really 'mis'casting at all. Without Kelly's unique flare for bombast and wit, Southland Tales could easily have been (and to many viewers, was) a film student-level epic failure of clumsy ambition and unrealised concepts.

I'm not saying that this will be Donnie Darko 2.0, that people will suddenly start championing it after years of deriding it. This belated crusade didn't really happen with Finnegans Wake, either. But I am saying that just as the literary world is richer for James Joyce (even if you never read his stuff, it 'had' to be written), Richard Kelly fills a void no one really noticed until he was there filling it. He did it with Donnie Darko, and there's really no indication he hasn't done it with Southland Tales. Okay, I'll take a small subjective risk: I believe Southland Tales is better than Donnie Darko, and I suspect that Richard Kelly, who must be very conscious that ST is his hope that 'lightning strikes twice', knows it. Someday (if not already), people will be writing papers on Kelly's work, which isn't something you can say about a lot of 'other' one-star movies out there.

Having said all that, can I recommend 'Southland Tales'? Only if you saw Donnie Darko and liked it for whatever you thought it was, not for what everyone said it was. And if you haven't seen Donnie Darko, it's probably a gentler introduction to Richard Kelly's inimitable style.",1213833600,3,4930,4.76463700234192

3035015,1,B000YQK14K,"I wish I could say I liked Southland Tales. I really really wish I could. But this movie, in more than one way, is quite possibly one of the worst movies released in recent history. I liked ""Donnie Darko,"" despite it being ""out there,"" but this movie is not only out there, but also not good. A more lethal combination than ammonia and bleach. Even the actors THEMSELVES, admit in the on of two Special Features on the DVD that they don't even know what the movie is about. I actually bought this DVD, just because it has The Rock, Mandy Moore, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Amy Poehler, Cheri Oteri, Justin Timberlake (who was good in ""Alpha Dog""), Seann William Scott, and many other name stars in it. I've liked every movie The Rock has been in (even The Gameplan, believe it or not!) but this movie shouldn't even star him. Or any of the name stars they have in this utter Disasterpiece pretending to be an arthouse sci-fi drama movie. They say this movie is a ""comedy""??? But there's not a single thing funny in it. (other the commercial with the SUV's having sex doggie style. That was funny, at least.) I don't know what genre this movie fits in. It's not much of sci-fi, drama, OR comedy. I guess you'd call it the ""weird pretenious crap"" genre.

There's some kind of plot, but quite honestly, no one could really tell there is. I'll try, though. A terrorist attack in Abilene, Texas in alternate universe July 2005 America forces the United States to go to war with the entire Middle East, re-instate the draft, and to create a ""Big Brother"" style branch of government created off the Patriot Act called USIdent. USIdent controls all surveillence, media and web activity and are watching Americans everywhere in the country. A family of Republicans control USIdent and a corrupt state senator is the Republican frontrunner for the 2008 Presidental Election (and Hilary Clinton, eerily enough, is the Democratic frontrunner.) The Presidental nominee's daughter is played by Mandy Moore, and her husband is famous action star Boxer Santaros, played by The Rock. But the weekend before the Fourth of July 2008, he goes missing, and Krysta Now, played by Sarah Michelle Gellar, finds him and hides him out at her place in L.A.

Krysta Now is a retired porn star turned reality star and hosts her own beachside debate show, featuring other porn stars, where the government, global warming, and teenage horniness are the topics of discussion each week. In their short time together, Santaros and Now have fallen in love, and have written a screenplay together called The Power, which is essentially Southland Tales within Southland Tales. Krysta's friends, run an underground anti-USIdent site called ""USIDeath"" and are neo-Marxists trying to ""fight the power."" After finding out that Krysta Now has been hiding the missing Boxer Santaros, son-in-law to the Republican nominee, they make up a plan to stage a murder in Santaros' presence, hoping to throw the upcoming election into chaos so that Clinton will win in November. However, the neo-Marxists' plan gets messed, and Boxer Santaros' whereabouts become known. Some other stuff happens, Santaros' wife and Krysta Now fight over Boxer Santaros, his memory starts to return, time-travel is inexplicably thrown in, a science-fiction alternative to oil threatens the world, and the Apocalypse is about to happen.

Now, that's the best way I can describe this movie's ""plot."" Justin Timberlake, as a soldier home from Iraq narrates the story and the whole thing is told in a much more complex, confusing way than anyone trying to read the plot of the movie on paper, or on the internet, could possibly understand. The ""ending"" makes no sense and the whole introduction of a time traveling conspiracy in a movie that mostly satirizes the American government makes absolutely no sense. All we know is that ""The world won't end in a whimper, but in a bang,"" and that ""pimps don't commit suicide.""

Why, oh WHY on God's green Earth would ANY of these talented actors choose to do a movie like this? Were they, also, like many of the people who seen this movie and mistook it's randomness and idiocy for ""genius""? That's probably would upsets me the most. The Rock, Sarah Michelle Gellar, and others are in this movie, when it doesn't deserve to have any talented actors in it, at all. This movie is an utter train wreck, and I don't say that too often. As an aspiring screenwriter, I usually give most movies some level of credit. I mean, the general consenus is, ""if they got it made, it MUST be good on some level, right?"" But as I rent more and more of these ""obscure"" movies, I'm starting to realize just how bad some movies are and just how perplexing Hollywood works. So what if the writer/director made ""Donnie Darko""? That doesn't warrant this movie ever seeing the light of day. The last movie I've seen this bad was ""TV: The Movie"" starring Steve-O from ""[...].""

There are some movies which are ""bad"" because of the plot. Or ""bad"" because of the actor choice. Or ""bad"" because the director, or short budget, or whatever. A ""bad movie"" is very subjective. Like, I would call a ""bad movie"" anything by M. Night Shamalyan. But others may disagree. However, even with the actors in this though, I think I can honestly say this movie is just Universally Bad. There are so many side-plots and meaningless subplots, the ""main story,"" which already makes little sense, is hardly even the main focus. This movie has Boxer Santaros' tale, but also Krysta Now's struggle to be taken seriously in mainstream Hollywood, Roland the cop's (played by Seann William Scott) story to find his time clone, the story of Krysta's neo-Marxist friends and their Trying To Ruin The Election story, and Justin Timberlake's soldier story, which for some reason, involves a musical number. Seperately, or if given enough time, many of these stories could possibly work, but when mashed up together like this, often with no reason or exposition given, they just all come together literally like a car wreck (or rather, Ice Cream Truck wreck). There is no sanity, or logic, or ""stuff that makes sense"" in this whole movie. Like I said, it's just a complete wreck. Not the ""brilliant piece of art"" it thinks it is.

Avoid this AT ALL COSTS! It's not even a ""so bad, it's funny"" type of movie. It's just a confusing, muddled mess of a disaster, which goes in all sorts of different directions, but never gets anywhere. It's sad to see talent wasted like this. I can't believe how many talented stars signed up for this craptastic piece of crap. It's a movie, in such a way, that it actually can ruin careers, mich like 2007's blockbuster Lindsay Lohan hit, ""I Know Who Killed Me."" I hope that when I become a filmmaker, I NEVER make something this horrible. If there's any lesson to be learned, it's ""This is how you make a really, really bad movie and call it 'artistic brillance.'""",1210982400,4,6905,4.769230769230769

3035017,2,B000YQK14K,"Okay, here's the thing. You have to see this movie. If you're a fan of Richard Kelly's ""Donnie Darko"", if you're a Sci-Fi Fan, if you're just a fan of films in general, you need to see this film. There are just a few things you should do first.

1) Get a little toasted. Score a couple joints (And I'd like to say here that I absolutely am not encouraging or condoning the use of illegal drugs. I'm just saying.), bum a Vicodin from Uncle Sal with the back pain, buy a 6 pack. If you're into yoga do some deep breathing exercises and get a good oxygen buzz going. Whatever. Trust me, it'll help.

2) You probably shouldn't see this movie alone because you're going to need someone to vent to. So invite some friends over. If you have a friend that especially hates sci-fi, be sure invite them because, well, it's always good to torture your friends when you get the chance. Just don't be upset when people start throwing things at your television.

3) Leave the volume on your set alone. You know how sometimes when you're watching a movie and you can't quite figure out what's going on and you can't quite understand what the heck people are talking about? So you turn up the volume up? Don't bother. It's not going to help.

And,

4) Don't expect a payoff. And I know, generally when you watch a movie, even if it's a bad movie, there's some kind of payoff at the end. Some emotionally or intellectually satisfying moment that makes the journey worthwhile. But this is ""Southland Tales"" and it's just not going to happen. Just let it go.

That said,

You still need to watch this movie. Partly because of the people in it. Yes, Justin Timberlake and Sarah Michelle Gellar and The Rock are all there but Jon Lovitz is also in it. John Larroquette is in it. Mandy Moore is in it. Kevin Smith is in it. Even that kind of bald guy from ""The Princess Bride"" is in it. We have to of course assume that nobody (Seriously.) read a script before they signed on but they're all there and they're fun to watch. And you have to watch this movie partly because it's the sort of movie that if you're flipping through channels on the TV and you run across it you have no choice but to stop and watch. Because pretty much any arbitrary 15 minutes of this movie is utterly fascinating. The sets, the characters, the execution, even the dialogue will all suck you in. It is, in parts, brilliant and  it's only when you string two and a half hours worth of these 15 minute segments together that you get a movie that makes you want to pull your hair out. Because there really is no coherent plot and the story, such as it is, doesn't make sense. Richard Kelly tries to do great things here and fails. He fails gloriously, which, I suppose, is the way you should fail, but he still fails. So buy a case of beer, have the gang over and settle in for one of the most amazingly frustrating movies you've ever seen. You'll be better for it in the end.",1210464000,4,2929,4.3224043715847
3035018,1,B000YQK14K,"""Southland Tales,"" the latest film by ""Donnie Darko""'s Richard Kelly, is like the movie equivalent of one of those whistles that only dogs can hear; it is pitched so far out of ordinary human range that most viewers will be wondering where the hell the joke is and why they just don`t get it.

The movie, made in 2006 and released in 2007, takes place in Los Angeles in the not-too-distant future (July 2008), three years after a series of nuclear explosions have all but obliterated Texas and placed the rest of the country on a state of high terror alert.  As in most post-apocalyptic scenarios, the threat to national security opens the door for a right wing cabal to take over the government and begin violating the privacy rights of its citizens.  For counterbalance, there is also a group of loony neo-Marxists bent on wresting control from the aforementioned Fascists.  The movie features Dwayne Johnson (aka The Rock) as a conservative movie star and future son-in-law to a Republican vice-Presidential candidate who becomes a pawn in the life-or-death match between the two clashing ideologies - the outcome of which might well spell the demise of the human race as we know it.

Despite the seriousness and topicality of the subject matter, ""Southland Tales"" is basically played for laughs, turning the end of the world into an absurd, over-the-top, dystopic farce that thinks it's being hip and knowing about life in a post-9/11/Homeland Security/ Patriot Act world, but which is actually only cheesy, smart-alecky and incoherent.  For a satire to work it must have discipline as well as the kind of tethering to the real world that one finds in movies like ""Dr. Strangelove"" or ""Network.""  Here, the film establishes no familiar reference point upon which to build any kind of compelling drama.  As a result, we quickly lose interest and focus, while the enterprise itself spins ever increasingly out of the filmmaker's control.

Janeane Garofalo, Sarah Michelle Gellar, John Larroquette, Jon Lovitz, Mandy Moore, Amy Poehler, Miranda Richardson, Seann William Scott, Wallace Shawn and Justin Timberlake are just some of the actors who might want to seriously consider getting this piece of cinematic excrescence expunged from their resumes.

The greatest offense wrought by this eclectic and unholy mixture of sophomoric satire, comic book realism, grunge chic and apocalyptic paranoia is that it runs for an interminable two hours and twenty-four minutes, making this hands-down the most unendurable and unwatchable movie travesty I've encountered in years.",1210204800,22,2570,5.15625

3035020,1,B000YQK14K,"First off, Sarah Michelle Gellar was as beautiful as ever.

Unfortunately, that's the only good thing I can say about this film. Disjointed, confusing, bad dialogue, horrible acting, no plot (if there is one, please, someone explain it)...basically, you name it, that's what was wrong with this waste of time.

I rented Southland Tales on Sunday. It took me three days to get through. On Sunday I watched 10 minutes and turned it off. On Monday I decided to try again and that time I got through 30 minutes before I became nauseas. On Tuesday I started from that 30 minute mark and finished it. Every time I was hoping it would get better but it got progressively worse and confusing.

I'm one of the few people who didn't like Donnie Darko but it was ten times better than Southland Tales. I don't mind David Lynch style films. I love Mulholland Drive, Blue Velvet, The Elephant Man, and Lost Highway. But Richard Kelly is no David Lynch. Probably the only thing Kelly has going for him is the screenplay for Domino which wasn't that bad.

I digress. My review isn't that constructive but it's hard to be constructive when everything about a film is wrong. Southland Tales should have never been made.",1210118400,4,1202,4.65566037735849

3035022,4,B000YQK14K,"Sometimes you don't have to understand everything to enjoy it.  Some movies are like amusement park rides, or maybe like hurricanes--you just have to sit back and ride it out.  Let it be what it is, forget what you want it to be and let it wash over you.  There are so many layers here.  This movie is a subliminal experience.

Much of it is sensationally enjoyable to me.  It's a wonderful satire.  I loved most of the message--particularly the anti-war, anti-government and pro-freedom, pro-sexuality messages--these were among the most overt thematic elements.  There are many layers here, and people who aren't well versed in socio-political theory will miss some of them, as well as those who don't connect such ideas with biblical apocalyptic theology.  Yeah, that's a lot to expect, and I could probably do just as well with less of the biblical.  But you don't have to know how the trigonometry moved the wheels to enjoy the roller coaster ride.

It's an epic fantasy period piece, with less emphasis on traditional storytelling and more of an eye for creating a memorable cinematic experience.  Of course there will be at least as many who ""don't get it"" as there are who have no real understanding of our current socio-political reality.  Most of the countless nuances here seem to have real meaning, and connect to both the themes and story.  This is what separates literate communication from artsy trash.  ST manages to remain the former, if by a hair's breadth.

I'm not entirely certain whether this movie is as smart as I would like to believe, but it certainly is never boring.  It is engaging, original, beautifully filmed entertainment, with one of the finest soundtracks in recent memory.  Even Gellar's single is remarkable--not to mention one of the boldest and truest political statements I've heard in years.

""This is the way the world ends.""  That's what it is, not a story so much as a moving portrait--mostly of our schizophrenic, self-destructing culture, but also of the hope that we may ultimately find in self-forgiveness,in the hovering interdimensional ice-cream truck of love.",1209772800,4,2111,4.9601139601139606
3035023,4,B000YQK14K,"I feel Richard Kelly is a genius, blending science fiction plots into the modern film the way many top writers do. It seems the reviews are going towards the negative for this film. I agree: odd. But if you want entertainment, a movie with sci fi themes that you can follow, Southland Tales is it.

I just watched it for fun. I didn't plan on reviewing it, but, since so many think the film is ""terrible"", I saw a reason to write.

In short, you have what others are saying: A picture of how the world ends. You have Justin Timberlake, The Rock, and a ton of other young actors, or actors who seem  to specialize in more B films. This is, in many ways, a B film. It comes close to the complexity of Donnie Darko, one of my favorite films of all time. And it's far more ambitious, almost, almost realizing its ambition. While the film is odd, so was Donnie Darko. While it has some odd science fiction elements, so did Donnie Darko. The point with Donnie Darko was you didn't feel like you were traveling around the world in a huge, sprawling epic, which is what Southland Tales is.

You have travels through time and memories and lost identities. You also have B movie stars rising above their general acting skills. It's a portrait of a future that could be.

The soundtrack was done by Moby, which truly fit in with the odd film that Richard Kelly has here. I am not sure if I would buy it; perhaps you should watch it first. It's an odd epic for people with odd tastes.",1209600000,4,1472,4.299638989169675

Now imagine he had a bigger budget and the carte blanche to do whatever he wanted. Yea... that's about what this movie is like. My ex-girlfriend hated it when we saw it opening night. That's all I need to say...,1209254400,2,318,4.406779661016949
3035026,1,B000YQK14K,"Seriously, this film is bad.  It is incomprehensible.  The cast is stellar, the plot is nonexistent.  I am a huge fan of The Rock, but this movie just doesn't make sense.",1209254400,3,170,4.419354838709677
3035027,3,B000YQK14K,"My introduction to Richard Kelly was with the fantastic ""Donnie Darko"".  In my opinion, this was just a perfect movie.  The dialogue, the story, the twists and turns, the characters, the special effects, the music, all of these things make it hands down one of my favorite movies ever.  So naturally I was looking forward to ""Southland Tales"".  Slightly discouraged by some of the merciless negative reviews I was hearing, I still had to see it for myself.

Well, while I don't quite agree with the aforementioned negative reviews, I can't say that I was terribly pleased with this one either.  The concept is initially compelling, the look at a post-apocalyptic future in which World War 3 is in full swing, and society in general has descended into chaos.  America is divided between extremists on the left-wing and right-wing sides, and both are so voracious and corrupt that they don't even seem to be at odds for any reason other than the pure sake of it.  In short, things just aren't really going too well.

Unfortunately, the problem here is that the concept never really takes a particularly interesting form.  In fact, it's so incredibly all over the place that it pretty much just breaks down into a total mess.  The huge ensemble cast, consisting of The Rock, Sean William Scott, Sarah Michelle Gellar, and countless others makes for a hugely complex storyline that in my opinion ultimately lacks focus.  There's not enough concentration on any one character to really get behind them, and many of the characters are fairly stupid and uninteresting, which makes it sort of hard to care too much about them.

Another big problem here is that the movie seems to recycle many components from ""Donnie Darko"" (I won't go into it, but you'll see what I mean), as well as many other movies for no apparent reason.  Chief among them is the weird musical number with Justin Timberlake lip-synching to the Killers, which looks like some sort of pointless nod to ""Across the Universe"".  Then there's the cameo appearance from Rebekah Del Rio, who you may remember as the woman who sang in ""Mulholland Drive"", who is again singing in almost the same sort of surreal fashion.  Now granted it is pretty cool, and she's an amazing singer, but hey, David Lynch got there first.

Then there's the hilariously cheesy plot twist of spacesuit wearing evildoers (one of which is fortunately a cool cameo from Kevin Smith, complete with long gray beard)who have come up with the ingenious plan of slowing down the earth's rotation to drive everyone crazy, which looks and sounds like something straight out of an Ed Wood movie.  If by this point you still haven't figured out that this movie is trying to do way too many things at once, this will definitely cap it.

I really hate to sound so harsh here.  This isn't really terrible by any means, but considering that Kelly is obviously a really talented guy, my expectations were much higher than this.  Maybe if I watch this a few more times, I may appreciate it a little more, but this definitely lacks the focus and flawless execution of ""Donnie Darko"".  Not to mention compared to other gritty apocalyptic sci-fi future-type movies that have come out recently (""A Scanner Darkly"", ""Children of Men""), this one definitely falls short.

Check it out if you're interested, but definitely don't expect too much.  Here's hoping Richard Kelly won't turn out to be a one-film wonder.  I think he's still got it in him to do something great, but this ain't it.",1208736000,,3497,4.778702163061564
3035028,4,B000YQK14K,"I'm pretty sure this film was intended in the light I viewed it in, sort of a wacky scatterbrained vision of this alternate future, and in that respect, I found it to be a throughly enjoyable film.
The final line of the film (which I won't reveal)for example and its previous utterances earlier on, seems to have rubbed a lot of people the wrong way because they seem to think it was written to be delivered in earnest rather than a goofy cockeyed mockery, to me was pure comic gold.

The cast as well, was amazing, and being filled with people cast into really weird roles for them set the tone for the whole movie in a brilliant manner I thought.

I did however seem to deviate from the feel of the prequel which was much more serious, but then again, if we are viewing the movie as its own separate entity that doesn't really matter.

Yeah you'll probably understand whats going on far better if you read the prequel, and yeah it does seem like he was trying to cram 10 pounds of movie in an 8 pound bag, but all in all I think it was worth my money.

I'm glad I made the purchase.  Just remember going in, that this is a comedic film, and I think it will provide you with some good entertainment.  Taking it too seriously will undoubtedly change your perception.",1208649600,2,1266,4.320675105485232
3035029,2,B000YQK14K,"I rented this movie and couldn't make it all the way through...The tone seemed all over the place, the plot hard to follow. But I loved the sincerity of Boxer Santeros, Krysta Now and Ronald/Roland Tavener. I loved the crazy neo-marxists, the goofy violence. In the end, I went back and rewatched, and suddenly pieces fell into place. There really is so much here, so many small details that are amusing, thought-provoking, or both. There are also so many cameos (where the heck did the idea of casting Christopher Lambert come from?  Loved seeing him).  I was reminded of some of David Lynch's films. (Was Rebekah Del Rio singing the national anthem an homage to her similar scene in Mulholland Drive? A nice touch.)  But whereas Lynch often seems to have some singular focus/theme, this film is all over the place.

How do you really sum up in one sentence what this film is about?  It's a wake-up call that we're stupid and on a course for certain disaster if we don't do something about it. That's all well and fine, but there's so much here, criticized in so many directions, it's hard to know what to do about any of it. In the end, some people may shrug at the too-muchness of Southland Tales. For others, they may find a thought-provoking kernal or two and start to really wonder what they think. And if, Kelly gets you to think, then perhaps he's accomplished all he set out to do in the first place.",1208563200,7,1409,4.531496062992126
3035030,2,B000YQK14K,"This was a disjointed, senseless, waste of 2 hours.  I did have advance warning from reading reviews here, but I just didn't expect it would be this bad.

I can't really think of one thing I liked about the movie.  Maybe the Pixies and Moby?  The overall feel is like some weird combination of B-moviedom, soap opera and late night infomercials.  Combined with a little too much inhaling on the part of the script writer who thought he was being clever with his visual puns and creative with his ""plot"".

We have the oh-so-daring mockery of the Republicans.  Others have been there, done that.  When the Dixie Chicks did it, it was courageous, edgy and well-deserved.  Here it's just opportunistic and cliche.  The closest it came to being funny was the elephant scene, but it was all downhill from there.

We have the dystopian commercials and news overlays.  They were already there, in slightly more accomplished form, in Robocop.  The car commercial was more tasteless than interesting.  Sex sells - what an insight.

We have the nigh-incomprehensible plot.  Now, if you are the type of viewer who delights in stories that don't make sense, you'll love this.  It's like, so deep, man.  No way I'll submit myself to this tripe twice, because I really don't think it has much to say at all.  The politics have nothing to do with it, it's just baaaad.

I'm not a ""Normal"" person and I love it.
When the movie ended, I had this non-stop laugh that lasted about 2 minutes.  It was uncontrollable.
This movie is an ""omni-genre"" film.  A drama, comedy, musical, love story, murder mystery, kidnapping, amnesia, sci-fi and others.

I love movies that have an all-star cast - every person in the movie is famous.  I love movies with famous people where they are doing things that are the opposite of their public persona. (The Rock, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Mandy Moore, Justin Timberlake, Jon Lovitz, Stifler, Kevin Smith, Booger from Revenge of the Nerds, the girl from Upright Citizens Brigade and many others etc.)  It's like John Goodman's character in The Big Lebowski.

There is references to alternative energy in the film.

This movie has everything thrown into it.  And its just that - it's all thrown into it.  No order, totally freestyled movie.  If you want to see something different, this is it.

I mean cmon people .... aren't you tired of the same old movie all the time?  If you want a movie going experience where you have absolutely no idea what you are going to see next, this is the movie.

This is the perfect balance of being different without being completely ""what the heck did I just watch"" like you might have felt after seeing ""THE FOUNTAIN"" by Aronofsky.  I thought that movie sucked but I did like PI, and I could see how others liked Requiem.

So don't worry, this isn't THE FOUNTAIN, its more on The Big Lebowski or Pulp Fiction tip but the dialogue isn't as good.

But i enjoyed it and all of my ""non-normal"" friends did.

Ideas rehashed from the excellent Donnie Darko, and put to no good use. An actionless part for an action star. A main character whose manner and actions remain unexplained. Constant shots of a room full of widescreen TVs which is both annoying and unhelpful. And an ending that fails to deliver any clear (much less satisfying) resolution.

3035033,4,B000YQK14K,"For his second film Richard Kelly addresses such controversial issues as homeland security, oil dependence and the urgent need for an alternative fuel, celebrity culture, Hollywood's impact on politics, and the invasiveness of the national media. He tells a lot more as well making the film a confusing, and jumbled mess. It certainly has it's detractors but I believe it is a flawed masterpiece.  The acting and the character names are laughable. What Kelly does get right are a perfect atmosphere of fear and dread. He accomplishes this through brilliant production design, a great soundtrack, and an eccentric supporting cast. The world has been plunged into World War 3 after Texas was nuked on the 4th of July. A desperate military reinstates the draft. Since soldiers are limited they are being called upon to serve multiple tours of duty. This leaves them horribly scarred and disillusioned. Many returning soldiers are eager to speak out and let the public know what's really happening.  Abilene (Justin Timberlake) is one such soldier. He serves as the film's narrator and informs us that a scientist (Wallace Shawn) has just invented Fluid Karma, an alternative fuel. Big business types aren't on board since they stand to lose tons of money if Fluid Karma catches on. It is Election time and the front runner for the Presidency is a man named Frost (Holmes Osborne). Along with his wife Nana Mae (Miranda Richardson) and daughter (Mandy Moore) he is thrown into the media spotlight when it's announced that his son in law Boxer Santaros (Dwayne Johnson) has gone missing. Boxer, an action film star, woke up with amnesia and no idea what he was doing in the middle of the desert. He is living with Krysta Now (Sarah Michelle Gellar) a porn star. The two are trying to sell a script they wrote entitled ""The Power"" about the end of the world. Boxer arranges to ride around with a cop for research on his role. Roland Taverner (Sean William Scott) is a cop on a secret mission. He has been recruited by a group of Marxists who operate out of the surf shops of California's boardwalk. They captured his twin brother Ronald and are holding him hostage until Roland completes his mission. The Marxists want to bring down the Frost family and alert the world to their corrupt ways. There is a lot to keep up with in the film's nearly three hour run time. New characters and plot points are constantly being introduced and it's difficult to remember who everyone is let alone their motivations. The eccentric and surprising supporting cast includes Bai Ling, Christopher Lambert, Beth Grant, Zelda Rubinstein, Curtis Armstrong, John Larroquette, Will Sasso, and SNL alums Cheri Oteri, Jon Lovitz, Amy Poehler, and Nora Dunn. An unrecognizable Kevin Smith even factors into things as a scientist confined to a wheelchair. The film's final act is the best part as it combines lavish spectacle, the apocalypse, and  lots of emotion. Up in the clouds the rich are enjoying themselves on a Zeppelin while down in the streets  riots rage as the world comes to an end. Johnson's performance is far too campy and ridiculous. His nervous thumb twitches are very annoying.  Scott handles his dual roles well, Gellar is quite funny as a  porn star with none too bright views on politics and the future. Mandy Moore turns in a strong adult performance. It's  both shocking and hysterical to hear her read off some of Krysta's credits to Boxer. Moore even dances with Gellar during the End of the World party aboard the Zeppelin. The scene, set to Moby, is both sexy and sad. People thought this film was a letdown since it wasn't like ""Donnie Darko"". I say it's going to eventually enjoy the same kind of cult status as that film. Kelly still has a lot of creative ideas and executes them well but ""Darko"" is certainly the better of the two. This film reminded me of ""Inland Empire"" based on it's length and overall weirdness. Some reviews have compared the film to David Lynch's ""Dune"" and ""Mulholland Drive"". Rebekah Del Rio, the Silencio nightclub singer from ""Drive, shows up here singing the National Anthem. The DVD features are limited. There is an animated scene between two fish discussing the end of the world. There is a half hour making of that attempts to clear up some questions but doesn't.

3035034,3,B000YQK14K,"Part dystopian tale of near future events and part trail-blazing satire, `Southland Tales' keeps it funny enough without losing its cool.  Going into the introduction, you don't think it's possible when Abilene, TX is attacked along with other Texas cities by nuclear bombs on the Fourth of July.

The fallout of this horror is that the draft has been reinstated with America officially at war with Iraq, Iran, Syria, and North Korea.  In the process of all this terror is an election campaign.  Bobby Frost is the Republican candidate for President who spends a good deal of time winning back California in the election for the first time in two decades.  (To give you a flavor of the writing, the Southern senator is often quoting Robert Frost's famous poems ""Stopping by the Woods on a Snowy Evening"" and ""The Road Not Taken,"" saying he has traveled the road less traveled by and ""that has made all the difference"".)

Under his command is Boxer Santeros (Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson), a man whose memory is erased by terrorist kidnappers during the nuclear nightmare but manages to get to Los Angeles from near the Nevada border.

If you think this country is divided now, it's nothing like in the movie.  Homeland Security has expanded into a complete surveillance system (""ID-it""--or nearly IDIOT)  that has everyone identified on the Internet.  L.A. is the heart and center of the domestic  front as Neo-Marxists stationed underground in beachfront town, Venice, try and infiltrate the intelligence agency.  On the ballot is Proposition 69, which Senator Frost vehemently opposes for allegedly compromising national security.  (It doesn't take much extrapolation to know that it would repeal an advanced version of the Patriot Act.)

Forgetting his true identity as well as his wife's (Mandy Moore), Boxer takes refuge with an occult astrologer Krista Now/Kapowski (Sarah Michelle Gellar) who is known for sweeping forecasts of the future as well as her advocacy for sexual freedom on a Malibu cable channel.  Completely vulnerable, Boxer also comes under the wing of UPU3 police officer, Roland Tavener (Seann William Scott), an extension of Homeland Security.  Both men have been cloned (into Jericho Cane and Ronald Tavener respectively and must come to terms with their alter egos).

The plot, all strings of it, involves finding Boxer Santeros, while fighting surveillance underground, and trying to be reconciled with one's alter ego and survive all the fighting.

You can understand that 'Southland Tales' has a lot to figure out.  At the same time, they keep the mood and pace light enough, so you know not watching a 'Children of Men' imitator.  Interestingly enough you don't have to keep track of everything; it's casual enough to be enjoyed.  (It's not quite a musical, either, although songs played along the way enhance the mood and message.)  The portrayal of feminist Marxist, Cindy Pinzucki, and her cohorts is so delightfully loopy that the movie often lost any of the initial tension it provided in the fallout scenes.  (No one could outdo Susan Sarandon and  Geena Davis in `Thelma and Louise,` but these girls are less serious and, if anything, more fun.)  This is deliberate, but I was impressed at how much this satire made me laugh.  Of course its inane and happy to be that way, but you may end up being as confused as Boxer Santeros, figuring out what's going on.  (And ""The Rock"" has proven himself a decent Arnold Schwartenegger successor by adding some disciplined screen presence to the scenes.)

My main objection to the film is not its many plot points (which for the first 2/3rd`s they juggle well), but its resolution.  Instead of continuing with a funny, satiric ending, they try to get serious again and end with mutations trying to catch up with their alter identities.  Trying to build suspense in the ending chase scenes, the film becomes a protracted affair that muddles its message and momentum in the process.  In a way the movie loses its own identity.  Once the movie figures out what it wants to be, it should stick to its guns, instead of shifting focus unnecessarily.",1207699200,15,4118,4.966423357664233

In 2007, which was an EPIC year for film, finding disasters were hard to find, save Evening and Mr. Brooks. Here then we have probably the worst film of 2007, or pretty darn close.

A reviewer below somewhere in the depth of word salad, said this: ""Fans of the director's earlier work (Donnie Darko) will not be disappointed. This movie stands out as a film with edge that many viewers will not fully comprehend (myself included) but can certainly appreciate.""

Well friend, speak for yourself, as I was thoroughly disappointed. I was at the 24:50 mark in the film, and just rolled over in the corner of my L couch, and sank my head into the pillows. I heard the sound of cars in the distance, somewhere rolling along the suburbian freeway, and someone on a bike went by, hearing that all too familiar sound of a baseball card attached to the spoke by a wash hanger.

Well Kelly you really bit the big one on this mess. Woooo Hooo. 'Donnie Darko' is amongst my friends and I top 20 movies of all time; it is, and was a cult phenom and is a shining achievement of brilliant filmmaking. Southland Tales is not edgy, it is not dark, it is a farce of untimely wit and parody set amongst a really trying to hard to be futuristic screenplay with a cast of some of the lesser of Hollywood's talent. (Lovitz, Laraquette, S.W.Scott, enough said?) Hence, perhaps Kelly new from jumpstreet how satirical and ludicrous this was going to be. The Rock and Sarah Michelle Gellar are just two names you do not under any circumstances attach to a film, if you want to take it seriously, much less a Kelly mind trip.

The opening scene aside with the boy with the camcorder and the atom bomb dropping, the rest (and I did roll back over eventually) is pure, total excrement. Endless, rambling banter and sad, twisted,non-humorous endeavors make the next hour even more painful. Perhaps I can look forward to Hellboy 2, Saw 5, The Mummy 3, Harry Potter 6, The Smurfs Movie, X-Files 2, Madagascar 2, or Get Smart: The Movie, and ordinarly I wouldn't think about seeing any of that nonsense. It is not surprising this has an audience, as the worlds population according to the CIA in 2007 est. was 6602224175. Someone's gotta like it.",1207440000,7,2701,4.574380165289257

Some think that director Kelly is misunderstood.  I think that ""Southland Tales"" is a pretty straightforward movie, coherent and easy to follow.  It is simply a bad film.  I don't see difficult to imagine all kinds of possible scenarios for the end of the world, especially in the Bush age, but the hard thing to do is to apply the fine brush, the little touches that make those scenarios believable, a world in their own.  Kelly throws everything that pops in his mind, but is all post-modern pap, the kind of act that pertain to some artsy films from the 1980s (and badly done at that).  Change the music for a full blown Hollywood-type orchestra, reshoot some escenes, shoot some more, and you could have a respectable summer extravaganza, with the same script but differently filmed.  This is one of those strange cases where fifteen million dollars more (and somebody else to helm) could have done all the difference.  In fact, I would advise Kelly to join forces with Gattaca's Andrew Niccol and work only pitching ideas to other directors, because the basic ones they have are good, the problem is when they try to film them.",1207267200,2,1184,4.718446601941747

The very near future, Los Angeles California. The United States has gone to war with Iran, Syria and North Korea however the war has created a fuel crisis for the U.S. because those countries supply so much of the oil the U.S.consumes. A desperate scramble for an alternative fuel source is launched. It appears that the country is in the midst of a social an economic revolution.

Meanwhile Boxer Santoros (The Rock) an action movie star with ties to the Republican President who had recently gone missing resurfaces with amnesia and winds up in a relationship with Krysta Now (Sarah Michelle Gellar) a former porn star who is in the middle of attempting to revamp her career. Boxer is being kept under the radar by enemies of the administration.

The fuel crisis has been solved by a rogue scientist however it hasn't been determined whether or not his solution is environmentally sound. All the while Roland Taverner (Sean William Scott) a veteran from the war, searches for his twin brother while Private Pilot Abilene (Justin Timberlake) a veteran from the war who was injured by Roland Taverner, narrates the whole story including versus from the bible.......

In case my synopsis isn't a good enough indicator I will just give it to you on the nose. This movie is a 2  hour train wreck. After finishing the movie, I still don't really know what this ""Lobotomy by film"" is about or what the point was. I am really just speechless but in a bad way.

The Good: I am glad that The Rock, Sarah Michelle Gellar and Sean William Scott are working but it is unfortunate that they are working on this.

The Bad: There is no recognizable plot, story, moral or point that I could see. Even though the movie is lacking in that department it still manages to ramble on for almost 2 1/2 hours, with an ending that left me shaking my head.

I really like Dwayne Johnson but I think this part was a little too big for the still green actor as he seemed to falter here and there in the movie as did Sean William Scott.

I could go on an on about how bad this movie is but will just leave it at, no story and questionable acting intertwined to make a never ending movie that is absolutely terrible.

Overall: Avoid this at all cost. There wasn't a single redeeming feature that I can think of. This is probably one of the top 10 worst movies I have ever seen.",1207180800,7,2661,4.919642857142857

I say ""parody"" because I can't believe that this movie could really be taken seriously.  Even though, a world where a porn star gets a talk show isn't unbelievable.

I saw a lot of potential from this movie, its graphic novel style, and the cast (would somebody please give Curtis Armstrong his own movie?), but neither all the special effects in the world, nor MTV imagery could save this nightmare from choking on its own excesses.

This is the sophomore effort from Mr. Kelly, the director, and I didn't expect him to make another ""Donnie Darko.""  Perhaps, his next movie will be better.",1207094400,6,736,4.623076923076923

3035043,3,B000YQK14K,"I agree with everyone that has called the Southland Tales a mess. Still, I can't say I hated it. I like films that are different and out there and Southland Tales is certainly different and out there. It's like Repo Man, Strange Days and a Terry Gilliam film all in one. The performances can be pretty bad but...that's what I found fun about it.

  I mean, it's fun seeing these actors experiment with roles they haven't played before and fail. I admit that Seann William Scott, Justin Timberlake and even Christopher Lambert really aren't that bad though. I don't think Lambert does that bad of a job playing a sleazy guy who sells guns in an Ice Cream Truck. It's different from the kind of role he usually plays. While John Lovitz is decent as a badass crooked cop, it's still hard not to laugh at him because we're not used to seeing him like that.

  As for the Rock, I do like him and wish the best for his career but he's awful yet entertaining at the same time here. I mean when ever he's nervous in the movie he rubs his hands together and makes a funny face. It is a litte funny seeing him act like that but at the same time it comes as the kind of a performance that a high school kid would give acting for the first time in a movie his friend is making. Still, it's an enterttaining bad performance. Sarah Michelle Gallar also gives an entertaining bad performance as a bimbo pornstar who wants to get into reality tv. I'm used to her giving an entertaining bad performance though since she gives one in every movie she's in lol.

  Southlamd Tales I don't even think is trying to be a good movie. It can careless if critics like it. I think they were trying to just make a potential cult classic like Repo Man. In that way it succeeds. I mean, if you cast Sarah Michelle Gellar you should know that you're making an instant B-Movie. She can add some sexiness to a movie and she adds some here but that's about it.",1207094400,,1926,4.298342541436464

I loved this movie, for everything it is and everything it wasn't. It's simply not for everyone. Which doesn't mean it isn't a great film, or pretentious, it simply means that not everyone is going to like the style or mixed genre that is Southland Tales. Just like you may not enjoy SciFi movies, romantic comedies, or documentaries, this move isn't going to be everyone's cup of tee. As a review I once read (for another film) put it ""If you like movies that bring the weird, than this one is for you.""

3035046,4,B000YQK14K,"Sophomoric humor and esoteric narrative are juxtaposed in this movie in a way that brings to mind Thomas Pynchon's ""Gravity's Rainbow"". Of course, compared to that sprawling and difficult novel, ""Southland Tales"" is positively taut.
The rapid-fire pop culture and historical references are anchored very well by a strong cast led by Dwayne Johnson, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Seann William Scott and Wallace Shawn. As in his breakthrough film, cult smash ""Donnie Darko"", writer/director Richard Kelly avails himself of a mesmerizing and idiosyncratic aesthetic. In some ways, it is even an improvement over that fine film, but it is much more abstruse, at least upon initial viewing.
It is an intrigue/science fiction/black comedy based on the Book of Revelation, quantum theory, the War on Terror and a postmodern critique of modern media. The movie seems to inspire diametrically opposite reviews, perhaps due to the demands that this opus places on its audience. The movie itself spouts narrative like a rambling doomsday prophet (literally, although Justin Timberlake plays one of the younger, more likeable oracles in movie history). Initially, it seems to be telling a long and crazy story apropos of nothing but requiring lots of suspension of disbelief. But astute observers are rewarded with a bizarre but cogent alternate universe rich in detail, humor and fantastic omens. In this reviewer's opinion, the intertwining of the plot threads at the conclusion was very rewarding in a dreamlike and abstracted sort of way. And the soundtrack, as one comes to expect from Kelly, is amazing.
None of this is to say that the film doesn't have problems. The dialogue is clumsy in spots, and the Special Features are somewhat lacking (obviously saved for some special edition somewhere down the road).
Nevertheless, this is one of the finest, most inventive films I've seen in awhile.",1206835200,4,1881,5.25249169435216

Having said this, by reading these novels, the movie only makes MORE sense, not complete sense.  It's definitely a hit-and-miss, with more misses than hits.  It's almost as if the director took his movie Donnie Darko and expanded it.  There are many good ideas here, any one of which would make a good movie, but all together it makes a jumbled and at times unwatchable movie.  However, there are parts of it that are interesting and having watched it a couple of times and reading the books, this hermit crab has pieced MOST of it together, so it isn't horrible or anything.  But, if you are looking for another Rock action film, this isn't it.

What's it about? It is about the everpresent bombardment of escalating craziness from world affairs and Entertainment Tonight brought to you TV and the internet.  It entertained while filing through the bars of my cage - not bad for a movie.",1206489600,3,617,4.913461538461538
3035049,2,B000YQK14K,"I have been following the progress of this film for about three years or so, reading about the constant re-writing of the screenplay, the re-shooting, the re-editing -- completely shifting plots and sub-plots around -- and I knew that this could only mean one thing....the movie was destined to be an obscure disaster.

Of course, that is exactly what it is.  I was surprised to find, after having finally forgotten about the making of Southland Tales last fall, to come across, a few weeks ago here on this site, a DVD release date for it.  Was this even in theatres or was it straight to video?  I keep up with all the newly released films in both the giant multi-plexes and the small indie theatres and never saw this title despite living in (now near) a large city.

It is fairly obvious what happened with the creation of Southland Tales...it goes like this:  Richard Kelly's movie 'Donnie Darko' achieved cult status and even moved past that to become a relatively mainstream hit even to the point of being re-released years later in Imax theatres.  That is pretty rare.  Richard Kelly was the It-Director of the mid-2000's.  Sony, hoping to capitalize on his status, signed him and basically gave him carte blanche.  Bad move for most any director, but certainly for such an inexperienced one as Kelly.

Kelly, overwhelmed by his own imagination, tried to capture everything in there on film (or otherwise create it digitally), but all these ideas he had got all mixed up in his brain and the hours and hours of images did not match what he had in hs head and so he shot more and more of them and switched the screenplay around and tried to put these pieces of this maddening puzzle that his mind had created together in movie format.  The problem was -- the pieces he had were mixed up with pieces of other puzzles.  He tried jamming them together in a desperate effort to make them fit, but nothing would work.  Finally the studio gave up on him and for all intents and purposes shut down production, thereby cutting their losses.

Southland Tales tries to be cool and current, but it is slow-moving and not even remotely witty.  It tries to put as many familiar faces as possible on the screen, but ends up with a bunch of C and D list celebrities and has-beens along with an action movie 'star', but no action.  A movie with a lay-out like an intense war-themed video game, but no intensity portrayed anywhere by anyone.

The above reminds me slightly of David Lynch's 'Inland Empire', where Lynch basically shot a movie (or much of it) as the ideas came into his head and then put it together as he went along and then through the editing process.  The major difference is this:  David Lynch is both experienced and supremely talented.  Kelly, well, he kinda isn't.

Sony made a very bad judgment trying to, basically, cash in on the success of 'Darko' and the 'fan-boys' and got reamed for it.  Too bad for them.  But even worse for Kelly, because I find it difficult to believe that he will be trusted like he was trusted by Sony ever again.  This was a film-maker's dream, but Kelly totally blew it.

Southland Tales is a poorly crafted movie that is essentially pointless and ultimately boring.

3035053,5,B000YQK14K,"The extreme reactions provoked by this movie are far more astonishing, confusing and inexplicable than ""Southland Tales"", which actually is a lot of fun.
Of course, after finally getting a chance to watch the movie on DVD, one thing is for sure, if there ever was a movie not suited for a premiere in the official competition in Cannes, this is it.
""Southland Tales"" is more a futuristic adventure-thriller strongly rooted in its comic book origins, than a confusing, pretentious, apocalyptic allegory, which has been made to be in most quarters. And yet, whereas more than a decade ago, the intelligentsia was ready to accept Quentin Tarantino fusion of trash and art, asking them to absorb at this point a ""joyride"" like ""Southland Tales"" might be too much.
""Joyride"" is the key to the whole endeavor. Despite skewering both left and right, uncovering ominous political plots, and the threat of world anihilation, the movie retains a light touch, mixed with some delightfully bizarre moments such as a Justin Timberlake musical number,  a rendition of the United States anthem by Rebekah del Rio, and a final dance number with The Rock, Sarah Michelle Gellar and Mandy Moore.
One of the most damning, and false charges, made against the movie is that the plot is confusing and hard to follow. Well, probably for someone who has never seen the likes of ""Lost"", ""Prison Break"", ""Battlestar Galactica"", or the ""X Men"" series, to name just a few. Of course, if you are an old, stodgy critic, whose idea of a plot is an Abbas Kiarostami movie, yes, you might find the story hard to follow.
It actually concerns an end of the world plot in which a movie star (The Rock) engaged to a vice presidential nominee's daughter (Mandy Moore), is kidnapped by a Neo Marxist group. He gets involved with a smart, entrepreneurial porn star (Sarah Michelle Gellar) looking to advance her career. There is a fierce political ellectoral race going on, and a draconian security state has been established after a nuclear attack in Abilene Texas. Sean William Scott plays identical twins who hold a key to the mystery of the possilbe end of the world, and Justin Timberlake is a somewhat melancholic narrator, a disfigured ex Iraqui soldier.
The all star cast is game, with solid turns by The Rock, Gellar and Scott. Mandy Moore is especially good, and Timberlake is a welcome presence. The supporting cast is amazing and fun, including comedians such as John Larrocquete and Jon Lovitz, cult figures such as Zelda Rubinstein (from Poltergeist fame) and Wallace Shawn (My Dinner with Andre), as well as the extraordinary, Oscar nominated, Miranda Richardson, in a bitchy big sister kind of role.
""Southland Tales"" has some amazing imagery, especially near the end. This is not a deep meditation on the state of our times, it's an anything goes, all star, pop extravaganza, in the form of an action adventure film. A masterpiece it is not, but it is one of the most fun movies I have seen in ages. Watch it!",1206230400,3,2986,4.83203125

In my opinion, it is much better then Donnie Darko. Its not your average movie which makes it great! For me it was a whole new experience. I watch on average 20-30 movies a month. There is nothing like this one!

The first time you watch it, you'll be asking, ""what is the point, how does it all make sense""? Thats one of the best parts, you cant figure it out the first time.

I watched it twice and then watched the special features. The special features explain ALOT, do yourself a favor and only watch those after you have seen the film.

I hate reading long drawn out reviews on here, but this movie requires it.

Here is the story (my opinion):

The United States is at war with several countries. Oil is becoming hard to get, a German company invents ""fluid karma"", a fuel alternative that runs off ocean power.

By using the oceans power, it throws off the balance of earth and creates a rift in the Nevada desert (a 4th dimenson).

Scientists send Boxer Santaros (the Rock) and Ronald Taverner (Stiffler) through the rift. This 4th dimenson creates a time/space problem and now the future and past versions of Boxer and Ronald co-exist. When Boxer returns from the desert, he writes a script. The movie is the script being played out. The past version of Boxer is killed, but Ronald's past and present self co-exist on earth.

The movie asks the question, ""what would happen if two souls that are one shake hands""? At the end of the movie, Roland Taverner shakes hands with his other self and ends the world with an ""apocalyptic handshake"".

Much, much more happens in between. The characters are great, the story is funny and intriguing and the dialogue and one liners are unforgettable.

3035056,4,B000YQK14K,"Wow...there is a lot going on in Southland Tales. And, unfortunately for the folks who expect plots and themes to be spoon-fed to them, this is a convoluted and sometimes messy movie. You're going to have to think for yourself with this one.

I'm sure many people said, ""Well I loved Donnie Darko, so I should love this, too."" And, there are many similarities to Donnie Darko, as ST delves into a bit of time travel theory and there's even a bullet to the eye (no creepy rabbit costumes this time around, though). But this is far more ambitious and epic than Donnie Darko in its scope.

Richard Kelly attempts to envision the end of the world, which happens ""not with a whimper, but a bang"" in this, and tells a story of the apocalypse using an omniscient, disaffected Iraq war veteran, a police officer searching for his ""brother,"" an amnesiac action movie star, and a porn actress searching for legitimacy. Through it all is an underlying theme of political corruption, subversive activism, and the government's attempt to monitor it all.

The casting choices made were a bit hard to swallow; at times you think you're watching a 1990s SNL cast member reunion. And I've never been a fan of ""The Rock."" And, seriously, Stiffler from American Pie? Buffy?

But, the story, as messy and hard to follow and pretentious and overreaching as it is at times, kept me interested and intrigued. This isn't exactly an easy feat to achieve in this decade of crappy TV shows made into even crappier movies, sequel after sequel, vile romantic comedies, and remade/rehashed movies.

I'm sure people are frustrated by Southland Tales, and it's easy to write it off as a piece of pretentious garbage. But, sometimes a movie is just a vision--not always coherent and easy to follow. As a fan of David Lynch's work, I had to accept a long time ago that often, there are things that just won't make sense.

I watched this movie Friday evening; it's now Sunday afternoon, and I haven't been able to get it out of my head. Like Donnie Darko, I want to watch it again. And then, maybe again. That's all I can ask for from a movie: don't let me forget you--make me want to watch you more than once.

This review, like the movie, is also convoluted, I'm sure. But, the gist of it is: I love it for its originality, for its scope, for its lack of convention. And I applaud Richard Kelly for not putting out Donnie Darko 2. I am happy to know that there are still folks making movies that might be a bit challenging.

If nothing else, watching Justin Timberlake swill beer and sing along with ""All These Things That I Have Done"" was great.

And, for everyone else, just sit back and wait for the next big Michael Bay/Jerry Bruckheimer CGI cliche. They'll insult you by selling you explosions and ridiculous special effects as entertainment, pocketing your money, and laughing all the way to the bank...",1206230400,4,2876,4.612524461839531

Again, if you're looking for straight up coherency you will not find it here, but I guarantee that you will fall out of your seat laughing at some of the shennanigans that take place. After watching this I will never call 'The Rock...The Rock.' Forever he will be known as Duane Johnson: actor! Not because he gives a dramatic tour de force of a performance, far from it, but because he manages to deliver inane dialogue so convincingly that you will literally fall on your stomach laughing till your guts spill out. He is that good in this which to me was shocking because I don't like the man's movies in the least bit. Everyone here does a damn good job, including Timberlake. But what made the movie resonate with me was that there's a large degree of truth to the hilarity that ensues. What would America look like if there was an Apocalyptic tragedy to occur in this current era we live in? Every movie that mentions Iraq in some context just seems trite in hindsight, and in this it's one of the main plot points, but I wasn't insulted by it in any way. Why? Again it comes down to truth. If you're aware of our current cultural landscape as it exists today then you will definitely get something out of this movie.

This is one of those really out there kinds of movies that you just really have to sit & devote your full attention to.  I think with a 2nd viewing I'd probably enjoy it alot more, I just don't know that I'd ever watch it again.  It seems to me as though there was alot more going on in the movie that just didn't need to be.  There were countless characters that in the end really didn't need to be included in the telling of the main plot.  It had a very Paul Verhoeven/Robocop political satire to it, & at the same time very David Lynch/WTF feel to it.  One thing I'll applaud it for is it's ensemble cast.  Most everybody included were put into roles you've probably never seen them in & it was great, they all did a spot on performance.  In the end I think what you have here is a director who got a big head after his ""Darko"" flick became a cult hit & wound up trying to do something clever.  Did it turn out that way ...I don't really know; I kinda don't think so.  I think most people probably don't/won't get it (even most of the actors involved didn't really understand it after watching the special features).  This is one of those films for the folks that like to watch weird & eclectic films just to be different, & in the end I'd almost bet you that they don't really get it either.

There is so much of a LYNCH vibe here that it overwhelms the rather ingenious nooks and crannies of the script and the ideas from the comics that introduce the story.  This is a very compelling experiment one that works best if you take the intial placebo of the 3 prequel graphic novels, their content is mildly fleshed out at the begininng of the film and throughout but for the uninitiated the story won't make sense otherwise, so Kelly has essentially painted he and his audience into a filmic corner.  The ideas are abundant, the cameos as numerous as they are curious and the musical numbers possibly too few.  Kelly is making films that are to be experienced and rewatched, the performances, background sound and art direction feel lifted from other films but the overall effect is powerful as the director throws off your propreoception one degree at a time.  I think alot of us are used to that CG tint/sheen that dominates scifi/futuristic films that is absent here and is often eschewed for bright drab uncinematic type shots, and with its heady mix of MULHOLLAND Dr. meets WILD PALMS it can be a strange pill to swallow. The effects are lingering and powerful as the concepts that Kelly has come up with are strong and much of this film is an original amalgamation if nothing else. so take the plunge if you dare but one thing I wouldn't define this as is entertainment.  The image transfer is quite good considering the films length, but I feel like all the studio wanted to do is tack trailers onto the disc instead of essential bonus material.
I would like to see a blu-ray version with the comics included as extras that can be read first, as the featurette and included animated short while welcome don't offer the viewer much help with the essential prequel setup story.",1205971200,2,1959,4.631123919308357

THe sad thing is i get the whole convoluted plot and it boils down to this. Stifler(Sean Patrick Scott) is the Real savior of the human race because he hasn't had a bowl movement in 6 days. The who goal of the Devil (Played by the guy that says inconceivable in the princess pride) is to cause armagedon by manipulating the republican and democratic party.

The devil causes this by slowing down the earth at a rate of .000000000000009 degrees which Jericho Kane/the rock/fake savior  (A False idol= a celebrity... get it) is right about when he wrote out this movie script of his. THis has messed with the way the universes waves go over the human race also a power source called liquid karma along with drugs is also used to try to destroy the human race. Except these end up making soldier able to have telepathic communications with each other. Why the devil even bothered not testing for these kind of things is beyond stupid.

Id write out more but that's mabye half of the summery for this murkey film. People who rate it 5 stars won't really know what it's about. Not everything that is confusing is good. Sometimes a person is just such an egomaniac that they can do whatever the hell they want and some people will eat it up.

This film is far to muddled and lacks any real depth, what exists in its place is an ego bigger then the megazeplin which i am firing a missle at right now. BURN southland tales cause your a PIMP and PIMPS don't commit suicide.

3035064,1,B000YQK14K,"Some say words cant even summarize this movie. They are right because the movie is hardly worth the words I'm about to waste my time typing to tell you how cruddy of a film this was.

Plot: Very hodge-podged and it didn't have any flow or theme like Donnie Darko. The only things scenes seem to have in common other then the actors/actresses is the usage of the ""f"" word. Don't get me wrong swearing has its place in quite a few films but the swearing was just tossed in and didn't seem to have any reason for the use other then making an 'R' rating.

Nuclear war breaks out in Texas.....the big issue with that is the attack isn't ever explained in any form of detail and the US in return unleashes on multiple countries at once starting WW3 who apparently is sponsored by Bud and Hustler...

What would have been the 'twists and turns' in this movie are as readable as the hustler advertisements on the sides of a tank or the BUDLIGHT stamped all over walls. You can figure them out without much thought. THIS DOES NOT mean the movie has structure. They introduce the idea of rift in time and a current person and their copy from the future not once but twice. You can figure it out after the first person unless your five or just had your eyes closed and ears covered during the film.

Cast: The cast is amazing and after seeing some of the names attached to this title I can't help but think how much they had to have been paid to even have their names attached to this or how drunk they must have been in order to sign a contract for this movie. A few names other then Sean William Scott and Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson. Christopher freaking Lambert (the original highlander actor) Kevin Smith (if I have to explain stop reading) Mandy Moore, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Justin Timberlake.

Summary/Final Thoughts: Very Very disappointed by this film and the fact that most of the actors listed would even agree to this script. Save your money and get the Donnie Darko Director Cut or the Regular version and a copy of the soundtrack.",1205798400,4,2032,4.436997319034853

Kelly appears to have observed such things and though the movie can be confused with a well-constructed brain fart, i believe it takes minor logical thinking to see it for what it is. Kelly is a fresh voice and if it wasn't for the killers' song in the middle of the film, I would have given it five stars. i recommend it, as kelly has a sad beauty to all his films.",1205798400,3,958,4.3277777777777775
3035066,4,B000YQK14K,"Set in the (then futuristic) year of 2008, ""Southland Tales"" gives a frighteningly real feel for ""what if..."".  It revolves around a famous actor who vanished for three days and resurfaced as an amnesiac.  Along the way, we're introduced to the porn star that's trying to expand to other genres (pop music, energy drinks, etc.), a cop that has returned from the war in Iraq, and the actor's wife (who happens to be the daughter of a man running for president).

Make no mistake, this movie DOES get confusing more than once.  You WILL find yourself scratching your head and saying, ""what the...?""  But, if you can keep up with the confusion, I think you will find that you actually enjoy this movie.

3035067,1,B000YQK14K,"Richard Kelly's long-awaited follow-up to 2001's Donnie Darko arrives on a wave of bad press after its 2006 screening at Cannes, and alas, reports were not exaggerated. Southland Tales is painfully sophomoric and entirely devoid of the wit, intelligence and pathos that made Donnie Darko such a unique experience. Aspiring to be a sci-fi epic, the film was shot on a tiny budget in only thirty days, and the film looks (and sounds) like an ""avant-garde"" American TV show, with performances (a bland cast lead by Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson and Sarah Michelle Geller) on about the same level. Everything about Southland Tales is horribly botched; it even manages to make Miranda Richardson look like a bad actress, a major feat in itself.

Whatever Kelly's vision was, it was hopelessly scrambled on the way to the screen. What's left is an undisciplined mishmash of ill-conceived, poorly executed scenes going nowhere and a lot of slapstick violence and smug, ""surrealist"" jokes reminiscent of David Lynch on a bad day. Kelly is insanely ambitious and he throws just about everything into the mix--Biblical prophecies, teenage porn, corporate conspiracies, rigged elections, time travel, world war three--everything except believable characters, engaging dialogue, or a plot that makes any sense. When Kelly's not aping Lynch he's coat-tailing Kubrick (he makes his inspirations plain with the soundtrack, probably the most enjoyable thing in the film), but he has sacrificed his own sensibility on the altar of his movie idols. In the process of realizing his grandiose satiric-apocalyptic vision of ""Life on Earth,"" he short-circuited his talent. Without narrative framework or coherent vision, Southland Tales is all sound and fury, signifying nothing.",1204588800,11,1753,5.374545454545455
3035068,5,B000YQK14K,"If you liked director Richard Kelly's first film, Donnie Darko, then you'll...well, it doesn't matter if you like Donnie Darko or not, this is a whole different beast.  And by ""different,"" I mean ""one of the only films I've ever seen that really made me question the old maxim 'there's nothing new under the sun'.""

One one hand, it's an arthouse flick, through and through; on the other, it stars the Rock, Sarah Michelle Gellar, and a whole roster of cloying teen idols; on yet another hand (I'm assuming you have four), the near-impenetrability of the plot (which would perhaps be made clearer had the viewer read ""prequel"" graphic novel) is most definitely up to the standards of your most pretentious art snob, but on the final hand, much of the film's ""impenetrability"" lay in fairly obscure pop culture references which are tossed about as if they're scripture.

I read one review that called Kelly ""too angry"" to make a good film; certainly, this is one of the more blatant anti-Bush films to come out since his first inauguration, but this is a bit like calling Greg Arakki's ""Nowhere"" a ""queer"" film; like that postmodern masterpiece's relationship with its unfortunate label, the thinly veiled anti-Bushisms at play are little more than a convenient backdrop for what is no less than a very unique filmmaker's very unique vision.

3035070,1,B000YQK14K,"Polarizing indeed, but then again maybe it was over my head.  Whenever people hail a film for being ""strange"" and ""weird"", but yet ""brilliant!"" in the same sentence you have to wonder if they really know what they watched.  With all due respect, my opinion is that I watched a long, plot-less, aimless, and bloated wannabe dystopian social commentary.  I am calling Richard Kelley's bluff here and respectfully asserting that Southland Tales is a turkey with a capital T.  Kelly brought us the perplexing but appealing cult hit&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Donnie-Darko/dp/B0006GAOBI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Donnie Darko</a>&nbsp;and you'd think that Kelly either threw caution to the wind or was just that confident that the oodles of fans who flocked to read far into Darko's story would bite into Southland Tales hook, line, and sinker.  Which of course for the most part they did.  But there is no real direction here, the dialogue is absolutely terrible, and even the cinematography is well below par.

The film stars Dwayne ""the Rock"" Johnson, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Sean William Scott (who plays twins), Miranda Richardson, Kristen Stewart, Justin Timberlake, Mandy Moore, and Jon Lovitz.  Kevin Smith also appears and I think I remember him giving P.T. Anderson a hard time about creating ostentatious nonsense like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Magnolia/dp/B000PAAJYW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Magnolia</a>&nbsp;but yet here he is appearing in something far more guilty of such repute.  This cast, albeit not a multitude of critical darlings, should've known better and maybe they do.  Even ex-wrassler ""the Rock"" must have had some doubt as to the legitimacy of Kelly's vision.

I'm going to try not to stray from providing some kind of plot overview here but I may struggle.  Texas suffers two nuclear attacks and the country is propelled to war.  Our civil liberties continue to suffer mightily.  Some technology is introduced to answer the imminent peak oil crisis that involves using ocean currents.  It eventually leads to enough chaos that it effects the space time continuum, I think.  Meanwhile, the primary three characters in Los Angeles are brought into the picture.  The film sputters into chaos just as I began not to care and for that I guess it kept me watching, but for all the wrong reasons.

Anyway, I want to find something nice to say about Kelly and his film but it is really difficult.  Donnie Darko is a very good movie and there are little flashes of that talent here but Southland Tales is so convoluted that it really can't be redeemed at all.  Perhaps Kelly's intentions were there and I hope he returns with something equaling the standard of Darko, but there are so few signs of that in Southland Tales.  Donnie Darko had appeal beyond reading into Kelly's complexities but this movie does not.  Some advocates for the film suggest it is a commentary on the globalized military and the media/entertainment industry's interaction with society.  Perhaps it is for them and for Kelly.  I suppose that's fine but it certainly didn't touch on those things effectively or realistically for me.  I would definitely say that Kelly bit off way more than he could chew if he intended to make this film some all-encompassing social commentary. Perhaps a longer version was justified or perhaps it should've been several films, I'm not sure.  At the very least, this makes me curious what he does next.  I sincerely hope it's very different.",1203033600,45,3563,5.32737030411449
3035071,4,B000YQK14K,"Enjoyable. Wild. Insane. Ridiculous. Stupid. Insightful. Too long. Too short. Funny. Cringe worthy. Pointless. Dumb. Inspiring. Eye candy. Fun.

That's what I would say if the average person asked me what I thought of it.

But if you're like me and you like : The Pixies, Jane's Addiction, Philip K. Dick, 90's Saturday Night Live, comic books, video games, Revelation and any other apocalypse theories, conspiracy theories like ""Behold the Pale White Horse"" or getting a kick out of ""The Anarchist Cookbook"", the creepy old psychic from Poltergeist, Viola from Moonlighting or Bugger from Revenge of the Nerds, porn, the internet or anything involving paranoia (both drug induced and not) then this film is for you.

In other words I enjoyed the film for what it is (a visual trip with many ideas) and what it's not (self indulgent and pretentious). Several established critics (they were probably booing this film at Cannes as well) called it self indulgent and a complete mess. I gather that when a critic doesn't comprehend what's going on they're quick to label the film self indulgent (they said the same thing about ""The Fountain""). They might do this out of fear of admitting that they didn't have the foresight to see that a whole new genre (sort of, I mean you have to give credit to the Avant-Garde) of film is emerging albeit with an American face. This isn't to say that they're completely wrong, I mean the film is a mess but it's an enjoyable mess of moments. I don't think Richard Kelly is interested in typical Hollywood story structure, that is, linear plot with plot conventions, I think it's more about encapsulating different emotions and ideas and stringing them together for a different experience. Conventions allow the audience to walk in to a theater with certain expectations and walk away with an understanding of whether or not those expectations were met. Southland Tales is not about expectations and if you require a strict use of genre conventions then this film is not for you. But if you have an open mind then I whole heartedly recommend this film.",1202256000,4,2084,4.864788732394366

From then on out everything made complete sense to me.  Every single twist the movie took resonated with that theme.  Everything that came before it made sense, too.  Once I knew what lens to be viewing the movie through, it worked perfectly for me.

My girlfriend, who I saw the movie with, did not have that same moment.  There's absolutely nothing wrong with that.  Some people are going to see a clear theme and some won't.  There could be people convinced that the theme is something else entirely and the film works for them in a different way.  There's no getting around it; it's a hard film to digest.

It's a perfect reflection of our weird society's increasing environmental paranoia and information overload; a metaphor for the barrage of endless, multi-stream data and constant doomsday declarations that we endure daily but can barely begin to solve or fully understand. The movie also embraces humor, irony and unexpected human connections that bind us in the shared experience. The individual pieces do not always add up, but taken as a whole, it's an incredibly ambitious and entertaining movie, for those of us who are into that sort of thing. I can see why people thinks it's either horrible or brilliant, because in some ways it's both. But, to appreciate Southland Tales, you have to give Richard Kelly credit for his ambition rather than wishing he'd made a simpler, more linear move. Like David Lynch, that is not his style, and both of these directors make movies (and tackle issues and themes) that, even after repeated viewings, you feel you're only beginning to grasp in their entirety.",1200614400,3,1169,4.8793969849246235

If you were not a fan of Donnie Darko, stop reading here as you will probably hate this film.  However, if you appreciate Richard Kelly's genius, he has actually outdone himself in this, his sophomore effort.  I won't attempt to explain the plot to you, just read the tag ""This is the Way the World Ends"", nuff said.  There are so many intricate plot threads, obtuse characters, and out there scenarios that it takes a good 2-3 viewings to comprehend what you are seeing.  Imagine watching every cable news channel at once and you start to get the idea.  If you do become a fan of this film, I would highly recommend the graphic novel tie-in, which is actually the first 3 chapters of the movie (Kelly took a cue from George Lucas and began in the middle of the story).  It makes the setup much easier to understand, and contains elements that would have been much too expensive to film with the budget they had.  I think that when people look back at this trainwreck of a decade, this film perfectly encompasses the atmosphere of post 9/11 America, with all of the paranoia, police state, turn-in-your-neighbor mentality the Bush administration has fostered.",1199923200,9,1249,4.697247706422019

The film ranks in my Top 10 List for 2007 and it is the most experimental film made in years.

3035076,3,B000YQK14K,"First of all, I have to admit. I am one of the ""Donnie Darko"" fanatics that has been waiting for this film for the past two years. I have constantly been to IMDB, Wikipedia, and so forth to check on the release status of this film. Finally, when a trailer was released, I was excited. The trailer was amazingly done, even if it didn't give us a clue as to what the film was about. The only thing is this: the trailer may have been better than the actual film itself.

There is nothing wrong with the actual storyline or plot(s) here. That's all fine and dandy with me. It was very complex, and I love complex. Anything that promises to rape my brain for two hours is welcome company to me. For me, the big problems were the script and the casting. There were several moments where the dialogue just seemed forced, as though I had Richard Kelly nudging me with his elbow saying, ""This is funny! You're supposed to laugh here!"" But with lines like ""I'm a pimp, and pimps don't commit suicide"", how are we NOT expected to roll our eyes in disgust? There's a scene where this very strange lady holds a gun to Dwayne Johnson's head, and begs him to let her give him oral sex. This was awkward, and felt totally out of place within the film. Another problem was with the casting. Many of these people are not professional actors, and it is painfully obvious at many times during the film. Dwayne Johnson twitches and over emphasizes his lines to the point where his character just isn't believable during many moments. Sarah Michelle Gellar and Sean William Scott deliver the strongest performances here, and Justin Timberlake is appropriatly creepy as a drugged out, Bible verse spouting soldier.

Don't get me wrong. There is much to like here. It is not a waste of time by any means, and it is not the disaster that some critics would have you believe. It is a flawed film - a mess of a film with great intentions. I would not for one second disuade anyone from seeing it, and I will probably buy the DVD when it is available. I'm just saying that I expected a bit more in the acting and screenwriting department, especially after Kelly's EXCELLENT debut, and all time fave of mine, ""Donnie Darko"".

SEE IT.

**Update**

Bought the DVD, saw it again, and liked it much more this time. This is a film that requires second, third, fourth, and fifth viewings. The second time around wasn't as confusing and the comedic elements weren't as awkward. It's still a mess, but a better one.",1197417600,4,2478,4.4855875831485585
3035077,4,B000YQK14K,"Set in a futuristic-looking Los Angeles in 2008 as it stands on the brink of apocalyptic disaster, Southland Tales centres on Boxer Santaros (Johnston) an action star with a bout of amnesia, whose life intertwines with Krysta Now (Gellar), a determined porn star developing her own reality television project. We also meet Ronald Taverner (Scott), a police officer who may hold the key to an immeasurable conspiracy involving a militant rebel organisation, the American government, and the end of the world. These guys are the nucleus of an infinitely perplexing plot that involves an abundance of quirky characters and bizarre goings-on. Directed by Richard Kelly, who made a stunning debut six years ago with Donnie Darko, Southland was delayed after an unfinished cut screened during the Cannes Film Festival and was widely abused by the amassed critics, who quite simply did not know what to make of it. Kelly has crafted a staggeringly ambitious piece of work that exudes an intelligence and ability far beyond my feeble brain. But, as a film designed to entertain and stimulate, it falls considerably short of not just his debut, but of a much-needed narrative lucidity that engages us as an audience. The problems here are vast and frustrating, but even when scratching your head in confusion, or frowning at another seemingly redundant character, you can almost feel the profusion of ideas dying to rear their heads long enough for you to grasp them. Kelly has raw talent like no other director of his generation, that much is plainly clear; but he needs to evolve into a director with a sense of control and focus, as large parts of this bang of over-indulgence. I have no doubt that Kelly will make other great films - but Southland Tales is never anything more than a beautiful mess-a beautiful mess I enjoyed.",1197158400,4,1821,4.954248366013072

After spending some time on the internet, I found out that there are 3 prequel graphic novels that must be read for this movie to make sense.  The graphic novels are awesome.  When combined with the actual movie, the movie itself is a very original concept.  The story is broken down into 6 chapters.  The movie is chapters 4, 5, and 6 and the graphic novels are the first three.  Combined they make a somewhat coherent story with a bit of everything from religious prophecies, a revolution in America, satire on our way of life, space/time continuum and of course, the end of the world.  It is definitely worth seeing and if you do enjoy comics, please read the prequel stories.",1196121600,9,796,4.479166666666667
3035079,5,B000YQK14K,"This movie cannot be summarized or explained easily so I will provide my impressions of this strangely fascinating movie.  First off, it's a long movie (over 2 hours) and the first 15 mins. confused me until I just let go of any normal movie expectations and sat back to enjoy the freak show that is Southland Tales.  There is no way this film is going to appeal to the masses and if odd movies appeal to you, then you better run out to see it at the handful of theaters playing it or wait for the dvd release.  I know I can't wait for the dvd release (please let there be commentary) for repeated viewings.  This movie was so crammed full of insight, digs and jokes that I couldn't catch every single thing.  This mind blowing version of what the USA might be like in the very near future is crazy but addictive.  I found the scene where someone questions after a commercial, ""Did I just see two cars f**k?""  ""Yes, but that was the European version"" to be very telling.  The smarmy salesman easily tosses aside any moral questions.  Are Americans being sold swamp land by Corporations?  Some might even question if the viewer is being sold a load of crap dressed up as fine art.  I think not.  The aggressive subtext was a nice touch too.  Be prepared for very crude dialogue - I found it amusing but it might not appeal to others.  The against-type casting was a stroke of brilliance (Sarah Michele ""Buffy"" Gellar as a porn star and Mandy Moore as a I can't say without giving things away).  Obscure references were a treat such as the Baron's ""Dune"" overtones and Kevin Smith (not easily recognizable) evokes the Wizard of Oz.  I loved the light handed social commentary.  This film never came off as preachy but made it's point of view on serious issues nonetheless (it's not for the war in Iraq for starters): they used a heavy technology vibe to get some points across (there are many scenes with several computer screens on view with running commentary underneath each screen); the national anthem was being sung in Spanish to start and then continued in English; the energy crisis resolution was pure sci-fi; and the Revelations from the Bible, as read by Timberlake, were played out by the characters (Revelation that apocalypse will be brought on by a pregnant woman (Moore) surrounded by a dragon (tattoo on Mei Ling's back) and two beasts (you get the point).  A lot of attention was given to the minute detail of this movie and that dedication showed.  The ""Vast Right Wing Conspiracy"" subplot was amusing and only one example of what this movie was all about to me - a joke, and it invited us all to enjoy it with them.  At IDent, all the employees wore these see-through plastic jackets that meant what? They looked out-of-place and silly.  Soon, the same exact question was sarcastically being asked by an onscreen actor.  Another example is when Kysta Now (porn star) attempts to sell her screen play (who doesn't in LA?  apparently not even a looming doomsday can stop Hollywood) with such typical blondness (""apparently, the future is much more futuristic then scientists thought"") that one actor cannot keep a straight face.  Everyone else is nodding along but this one actor cannot stop laughing to himself.  It all seems to be a joke and some of the actors got it and some didn't.  It's almost as if two sets of scripts were handed out on this film, one set said it was a dark comedy and the other set said this was a serious film about the future of America.  Fans of the director's earlier work (Donnie Darko) will not be disappointed.  This movie stands out as a film with edge that many viewers will not fully comprehend (myself included) but can certainly appreciate.  Well worth watching on the big screen to help with the enormity of the what is going on in this film but waiting for the dvd with cribnotes might help.",1195430400,71,3847,4.575182481751825
3269327,5,B000YQK14K,"""Southland Tales"" is a sublimely, spectacularly awful movie.  Really, really, REALLY awful.  So awful, in fact, that it goes through awful and come out the other side, like Dante's ""Divine Comedy"" meets ""Plan 9 From Outer Space.""

I'm not ever going to try to recap the plot...it involves SoCal and the apocalypse.  Any deeper understanding and your brain will begin to melt.  It does help, though, to read the Prequel Saga (the graphic novel, available on Amazon but not in any bookstore I've gone into).  The Prequel Saga at least gives you a better picture of the world you're entering...a near future even more futuristic then we ever anticipated.

This movie works best when you simply consider it as a series of moments.  Think of it as several dozen very short films that are being presented together for your viewing pleasure.  Only then can you appreciate Krysta Now (Sarah Michelle Gellar, who uses a wide-eyed earnestness here that is so un-Buffylike that at first you hardly believe it's her) and her porn-star posse debating the ethics of abortion and quantum mechanics on a reality show on the beach.  Or Dion (Wood Harris) and Dream's (Amy Poehler with the fakest fake nose I've ever seen) hysterical ""domestic dispute.""  Or even the commercial where two SUVs get it on.  Yes, two cars f***.  I can't make this stuff up.

This movie has a great cast...I mean, Zelda Rubinstein!  Christopher Lambert!  Kevin Smith!  Granted, you barely get to see any of those people, because there are SO MANY PEOPLE in the cast that it's hard to keep track of them all.  (Watch for the looks on each actor's face.  They all have a sort-of stunned, ""what is this movie?  How did I get here?  What have I done?"" look on their faces.  Poor Sean William Scott looks like someone must have kidnapped his grandmother and forced him to do this movie as ransom.)  A few stand outs, though, were Justin Timberlake as Pilot Abilene--Timberlake drunkenly lip-sychs to The Killers ""All These Things That I've Done"" with a s***-eating smirk on his face that tells me that HE gets the joke that is this movie.  Also Cheri Oteri, who usually annoys the heck out of me but here plays a really annoying character who happens to be a sociopath.  Like I said, through awful and out the other side.

Music in this movie is fabulous...the aforementioned lip-synching might have been my favorite part of the movie (if god wanted to speak to ME, he'd probably do it through Killers lyrics, too).  Rebekah Del Rio (as herself) sings ""The Star-Spangled"" banner, and I felt the first stirrings of traditional patriotism that I've felt since 2004.  Moby provides an atmospheric score, which sounds basically like every other Moby song I've ever heard, but fits this movie very well.  And Kelley takes us to the credits with Blur's ""Tender,"" which was a great finish considering that the last 20-some minutes are the oddest bit in the whole film.

If this review hasn't scared you off, check it out at whatever indie-theater happens to be within 200 miles of you.  Definitely read the graphic novel FIRST or you'll  be even more lost.",1195344000,16,3105,4.7565543071161045

3269355,2,B000YQK14K,"I went into this movie knowing its insane backstory -- how director Richard Kelly (the man behind ""Donnie Darko"") was given ""carte blanche"" during the production, how he plotted a multimedia franchise that included a website and graphic novel prequels, how the film was panned at the Cannes Film Festival, and how it eventually sank into obscurity, taking Kelly's directorial career with it.  I had heard how it was supposed to be a barbed political and social satire, an allegory of the Book of Revelations, and a bold love letter to Philip K. Dick.  And I also heard how many people, from Internet critics to the very actors who starred in this thing, couldn't even begin to tell you what it was about.  And yet all this information just whetted my curiosity -- I had to know for myself whether it was as bad and insane as they said.

I can't say that I enjoyed this film, nor will I watch it again.  And the critics were right -- it's pretty bad and confusing.  And yet it'll stay with me for a long time, and will probably garner a cult following among people who enjoy weird cinema.

""Southland Tales"" takes place after a nuclear attack on Texas (who perpetrated said attack is never explained).  In the wake of the attack, the government declares martial law and turns the United States into a totalitarian state, while a wealthy scientist (Wallace Shawn) sets out to make a fortune from an ocean-generated power source he calls Fluid Karma in the hopes of usurping the oil industry.  The government is struggling to maintain an iron grip on the country and on the Internet, while a group of rebels calling themselves the Neo-Marxists fight to overthrow said government.  In the meantime, Fluid Karma is somehow ripping holes in the fabric of time and space, a fact the scientist is trying to both exploit and cover up.  And while all THIS is going on, an amnesiac actor (Dwayne Johnson) with ties to a powerful senator is teaming up with a porn star (Sara Michelle Geller) to write a screenplay that he hopes will change the world... if it doesn't destroy itself first.  Add Justin Timberlake as a brooding, Bible-quoting military sniper, Sean William Scott as twin brothers tentatively allied with the Neo-Marxists, Christopher Lambert as a crazy arms dealer peddling his wares from an ice cream truck, and a slew of ""Saturday Night Live"" alumni peppering the cast, and you have insanity on your hands.

Yeah, it's hard to describe this movie, because there's just SO freaking much going on.  It's difficult to know who's working with who, something not helped by the fact that alliances keep changing and betrayals keep popping up.  The director seems to think that packing everything he can possibly think of into one film is the best way to go, but all that does is make the movie a tangled and convoluted mess.  (The fact that the movie is only the second half of the story doesn't help -- Kelly expects people to read the graphic-novel prequels before watching the film, though said graphic novels were out of print by the time the film hit theaters.)  And the movie is NOT shy about throwing all kinds of symbolism and political commentary at the screen, mostly bashing Republicans and the Bush administration, and you get the feeling that the whole movie is trying to say something but thinks it's being smart by relying on allegory and metaphor to do it.  Sometimes this can work... but here it just makes an already confusing movie nearly impenetrable.

I do give the actors in this movie credit for trying, though many of them look rather bewildered as they play, as if they're not quite sure what's going on themselves.  Dwayne Johnson and Sean William Scott look particularly confused throughout the film, though it's hard to tell how much of this is their characters and how much is them going ""what on Earth did I sign up for?""  Some actors, like Sara Michelle Geller, seem to be phoning in their performances, while others, like Kevin Smith, Wallace Shawn and most of the SNL players, decide to have fun with their roles and ham it up as much as possible.  The actors who nail their roles the best would have to be Justin Timberlake and John Lovitz (the latter playing a cold-blooded murderous cop).  Both bring a sinister-ness and unexpected level of depth to their roles, and are surprisingly good actors for being a boy-band star and a snarky comedian respectively.  I wouldn't mind seeing either of these two in more dramatic roles in the future.

I see three major flaws with this movie aside from the confusing, convoluted plot.  The first is that the film is unable to stand on its own -- yes, the graphic novel prequels and the websites might give more information, but I shouldn't have to read a comic book to ""get"" a movie.  For a comparison, the movie ""Pacific Rim"" has a lot of information not included in the movie that adds to the experience, including graphic-novel prequels, but these aren't required reading to understand what's going on onscreen.  They're extras that people can enjoy once they're done with the film.  When a movie's incomprehensible without extra material outside the film, it's a failure in my eyes.

The second flaw is the director's ""throw everything at the screen and see what sticks"" approach to filmmaking.  I haven't seen ""Donnie Darko,"" so I don't know if that's his usual style, but here I get the feeling that Kelly couldn't bear to cut any ideas out of his screenplay and so just jammed everything he could into a single film.  Political satire, social satire, dystopian sci-fi, Biblical allegory, pop-culture parodies, apocalyptic thriller... this film tries way too much for even its generous two-and-a-half-hour runtime, and as such no single aspect gets the attention it deserves.  The entire film feels like several films cut apart and haphazardly stuck together, and that makes for a frustrating viewing experience.

The last flaw is the egocentric smugness that practically drips from every second of this film.  Despite the incomprehensibility of this film, it's very clear that Kelly had something to say, something he considered important enough to rub into the viewer's face at every opportunity.  And yet he didn't want to come right out and say it, but cloak it in metaphor and symbolism so he could crow ""you all just don't GET my genius!"" when questioned about it.  Maybe I'm alone in feeling this way, but I couldn't help but sense the director's arrogance as I watched, a nagging feeling that the director felt that if I couldn't understand his message, I just wasn't smart enough to appreciate his work.

Still... for all the confusion, madness, and director's ego that stank up this film, I know I'm not going to forget it anytime soon.  There's a weird sort of fascination that accompanies this movie, the sense that I'll never watch anything quite like this again.  It's a bizarre mishmash of sci-fi, satire, Biblical allegory, and passion project that throws weird scene after weird scene at the screen, and while these weird scenes rarely work, they do stick in one's mind, for better (Justin Timberlake's out-of-nowhere but memorable ""All These Things I've Done"" music video smack in the middle of the action) or for worse (the car commercial... just don't ask...).

It's hard to know who to recommend this film to, because I think most people would find it difficult to enjoy.  I'd say if you're a fan of bad or weird cinema, and you don't mind watching a movie and having no idea what's going on, give it a shot.  If nothing else, enjoy it for the madness of what's playing out onscreen, and the absurdity of seeing actors in roles that are completely against type.  Myself, I probably won't watch it again, and I can't say I really enjoyed it, but I'm certainly going to be thinking about it for a long time.  So I guess, in that respect, Kelly succeeded in making a memorable film, even if it's memorable for the wrong reasons.",1458691200,,7925,4.756756756756757

3269357,3,B000YQK14K,"I loved Donnie Darko, so I've always been interested in Richard Kelly's work. The Box had some interesting moving parts in it, but for the most part it was a swing and a miss. I never got around to watching Southland Tales because I don't remember it being in the theaters, it is never shown on TV and it didn't get good reviews. I knew it wasn't going to be great, so I really lowered my expectations. It was as if I was wincing before the movie started. It turns out, it wasn't as bad as some people made it out to be. Richard Kelly is one who loves detail, and ST is no different. I think some viewers get lost in the detail, but if you just kind of let go and let the story unfold, you can enjoy it for what it is.

Kelly likes to add supernatural elements to his stories, which played well in Donnie Darko and not so well in The Box. The supernatural stuff in ST was a little bit confusing and bizarre. It was hard to 'go with' the some of the stuff since it was hard to even know what was happening. The two scenes that stuck with me were actually the two with music and no dialogue/Plot: The music video in the arcade and the Star Spangled Banner. Both very surreal.

This film is not nearly as good as Donnie Darko.

One was that there were too many voice-overs explaining what was happening. Writing the causes into the script as action would've helped clarify a lot better. The other was its coherency, or lack of it.  It all came together at the end but that was too long to wait.

I rented this because the previews were so intriguing. What I saw wasn't, though it definitely was confusing.  In an attempt at alternate energy, a scientist causes a rift in the Space-Time-Continuum. He decides a cop and a movie star will enter it (why?). They do, are duplicated and the cop and his twin escape but the movie star dies and his duplicate comes back.  That's about all I could coherently get from the plot.

Terrorist underground, voracious Southern politicians, movies stars, staged murders which turn out to be real, clones, double-crosses right and left, more false identities than you can shake a stick at, the Draf, a Justin Timberlake music videot...you name it, all shoved into 2 hours-plus which to my mind was two hours too much. All the rest seemed like an assignment in drama class...give a situation and let the actors device the rest...it all appeared just one big adlib.

Given the cast I expected something spectacular, and I admit the acting was first-rate, but from the story all I got was the statement made by the person with whom I watched it: Weird.

I've never seen this movie advertised anywhere except tacked onto the beginning of another rented DVD. Did it go straight to DVD?

Perhaps there were deep meaningful subplots and alleghorical subtexts, perhaps I was just too dense to spot them.  All I know is it was deeply disappointing.  I watched the entire movie hoping to get some coherency. I didn't get it, probably in more ways than one.

It's states several times in the movie that the world ends not with a whimper but a bang. In this particular world ended with: Huh?",1407369600,,2043,4.662952646239554

For starters, the casting is atypical, risky & thoughtful with emphasis on a lot of SNL alums who can demonstrate their range.  If you like Moby you'll like the music.

3269405,5,B000YQK14K,"I was fortunate enough to get to see the longer version that was submitted at Cannes - which has a run time of 2 hrs 38 min. and includes a fair bit more footage but it also lacks the ""doomsday"" summary at the beginning that was put together after the Cannes release once Sony funded extra work. Those who want to be able to see it could ask Richard Kelly for a copy or delve into the world of torrenting and TPB...... enough said.

I like both versions. I think that if Richard Kelly was inclined/allowed to do a directors cut it would be a fuller, more satisfying production. The music is incredible and I will watch the movie even just to have it running in the background with the soundtrack drifting around the room in surround sound.

The entire story (including the graphic novels) would have benefited from a ""mini-series"" treatment where the missing elements could have been wound in. To try and get it all done in 2.5 hours was many a cut too far. The characters are great but the story misses some chunks, leading many people to label it as a confusing mess. I didn't think so and I was compelled to purchase the graphic novels to complete the story. Richard Kelly stated in the directors commentary that it takes more than one viewing to take in all of the sub-plots - which is true.

However, the first thing I noticed about this movie is that you couldn't take your eyes off it; it was fast paced and changed from scene to scene rapidly.  It is very entertaining, if nothing else.  The next thing that I noticed, and which I believe is both the mood and the tone of the movie, is that it is a little bit nutty.  If I am not mistaken, the mood is how the audience feels, and the tone is how the writer feels.  Both of them are a little cuckoo.  Watching the movie, you are like, WTF?

3269414,1,B000YQK14K,"This movie kind of hobbled around inside my head for the time I spent watching it, hoping to find a parking space. It did not succeed. ( Although there probably isn't much room in the noggin compartment - most of it being occupied by movie trivia and the 1970 World Cup of soccer.) So for all the WTF moments in the movie, all the arch references, all the intentionally bad costumes and bad lines there is no reaction.

So the only way to approach this movie is this - take it one thing (and I stress the meaning of ""thing"" here) at a time. One can only react to one shred of this movie at a time. Was a joke is really funny or not? Did a scene mean something or not? Did the time spent watching this bring about some non-random synaptic firing or not?

For me the answers arrived simply.  Not. Not. Not. Not. Not. (Additional nots added to ward off any additionally post-viewing thoughts this utter dreck of a movie might bring about beyond these few words.)

From what I have read there were huge choruses of boos for this movie when it was shown at Cannes. (Canned at Cannes so to speak.) This version of the movie apparently has had 20 minutes cut from the original which one might possibly surmise meant that some meaning, some gravitas, some something was subtracted from the film. Not. Not. Not. (Not. Not.)

There were some talented actors and some good comedians in this film, but nearly all of them end up being no funnier (or arcane) than their character names.

Richard Kelly directed this plotless shipwreck. He did another movie most people have seen - Donnie Darko. It was sort of off the wall, but you felt that it actually contained a few moments of actual drama, some points in that film were actually made, not slobbered on by a half-crazed beagle and left on your front doorstep as a wierd welcome to the day. But there is a faint hint of connective thread between DD and Southland Tales - one of absurdity or chaos or anarchy.

Then again probably Not. (Not. Not.)

3269434,1,B000YQK14K,"Wow. Just...wow. This movie is bad. No plot. No character development. No action. Bad special effects. Bad casting. Pointless asides. An ambiguous ending.

-- The plot: The plot held promise, but, like a runaway train, it quickly jumped the rails and ground to halt. That moment came about 15 minutes into the movie. Kelly tries to jam too much into a small space. It's a Feng Shui nightmare. The viewer has no chance to figure things out on his own throughout the movie, and even when the crap about two souls blah blah blah is revealed at the end, it makes no sense because it wasn't really set up earlier in the movie. There are some unique ideas, but they are buried under mountains of pointless drivel.

-- Characters: There's just too many, and Kelly gets trapped trying to tell all their stories in one film. Too many characters with too many undescribed plotlines/motives.

-- Action: There simply isn't any. It's just a bunch of talking, and because so many people are doing only small snippets of talking, nothing is really discussed/revealed/explained. Justin Timberlake's narration doesn't help, either.

-- Casting: I love John Lovitz; I think he's one of the funniest guys going. Cheri Oteri was great on SNL. I've got nothing against The Rock. Big fan of Amy Poehler. It feels like they're all trying WAY too hard to convince the viewer they ARE the characters they're playing. It doesn't work. I mean, if The Rock (as Boxer Santaros) is your main character, then you need to give him more to do that twiddle his thumbs (literally) and ask a bunch of questions (only to get ambiguous/undefined answers). Or is Justin Timberlake the main character? Then he needs to do more than drink beer and do music montages in the movie. (The last two sentences also can go with the whole plot thing).

The special effects truly are bad (what few of them there are), and why would I need a 5 minute Justin Timberlake video in the middle of my movie?

From the start, this movie goes straight downhill, and that's my assessment coming into it with no expectations. I mean, the whole thing is just a giant, jumbled mess.

It had such great potential. The cast had a ton of heavy hitters, many from comedy. A number of SNL alums had cameos or small parts. And of course, you have the team of Dwayne Johnson and Seann William Scott, who were hilarious in ""The Rundown"". You could make an entire review just naming the big names that were in this move. Seriously, take a look at this list, and then cry at the colossal waste of talent that was this movie.
[...]

I thought surely with the two stars that they had, having recently done such a great comedy together, that this was going to be comedy gold. I thought that every time a new star appeared, most well known for their comedy. I thought that right through the first hour. By that point, I figured out it wasn't supposed to be a comedy. Ok, so what, right? So it's not a comedy, that's ok. The problem is, I spent the rest of the movie trying to figure out what it actually was. I never did. The plot was incomprehensible and convoluted. It felt like watching tv with someone sitting on the remote making the channel change every few minutes. Actually, that would have been more entertaining.

In short, this movie is a tragedy. It's a tragedy that you've wasted 2 hours of your life, and it's a tragedy that such great potential was wasted, that such an all star cast were in such a bad movie. I hope that they can get that cast back together with a script that's actually worthy of them. That would be a movie worth seeing.",1313971200,6,1721,4.38871473354232

3269448,2,B000YQK14K,"This is the way ""Southland Tales"" is told, I presume.  In a not-too-distant future (around a couple of years back?), a series of nuclear bombs in American soil caused the entire nation to declare martial law, then announce World War III and go hostile in other countries.  Within the Southland of California, it's overseen by a home security organization called USIDent, controlled by midgets and people wearing transparent raincoats.  USIDent is in cahoots with an environmental group called Treer, helmed by that kidnapper from ""Princess Bride"", who created a reusable energy called Karma Fluid, and both parties are in support of a government candidate for a state election.  However, these groups are under attack by a local territory group called Neo-Marxists, and they had a trump card in the form of an amnesiac movie star named Boxer Santaros.  Boxer had ties with the government candidate, but is currently bunking with a porn-star who helped him write a script about the Earth slowing its rotation, same porn-star who's in league with the Neo-Marxists.  The script was leaked and provoked a fangirl from USIDent to pretend as one of the script characters to tell Boxer where to go, and elsewhere the Neo-Marxists hired a look-alike from a kidnapped soldier to watch over Boxer and involve in a staged murder, but the murder was real for the sake of blackmailing.  Boxer lead his own way to Treer to discover the parallels of his script and realized the global conundrum in regards to the experimental dimensional vortex and bjsjiesfsjsdwjkdso---okay, what is this, ""Syriana""?

As convoluted as ""Donnie Darko"" was, at least that movie had a simple pitch: a kid escaped from certain death which lead into mysterious anomalies and he has the power to make the ultimate choice to keep his world at bay.  Richard Kelly went too far on making a complicated story too difficult to summarize, it's as zany as its casting choice.  Speaking of the cast, I've never seen such an unbalanced slew of actors.  I'm not expecting a well-rounded ensemble like ""Short Cuts"" or ""Boogie Nights"", but I expect better actors to be in a chaotic premise than Amy Poehler, Jon Lovitz and Will Sasso; it's like watching one-half of an SNL team and the other-half of an MTV clique dealing with a so-called serious crisis.  Maybe it's due to the budget that this movie has such a cast, but no matter how hard they tried, the actors just can't get into their roles with ease.  Although, I do give props on having&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Russell-Nash/dp/B001JFZ118/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Russell Nash</a>&nbsp;in this film, given that I haven't seen him in a while.

The problem with ""Southland Tales"" isn't the fact that it's confusing, but rather how disjointed it is.  None of the mini-plots have any kind of connection with the overall theme of endness, it's a bizarre series of kidnappings, blackmails, and reality shows; a couple of scenes don't even add anything, like the part where a character declared to be pregnant but nothing came from it, and a boring dream sequence with Justin Timberlake in a musical.  The movie's tagline is 'this is the way the world ends', and yet all I'm seeing is a world on riots; I'm sure Southern California has been having riots plenty of times and it's still doing fine.  The incomprehensible ending left me with nothing to think about, especially with the unfocused preceding events.  It's so unreal, not to mention how long this film is, that it became boring.

I should appreciate Richard Kelly for being ambitious, and the film is well-shot, but the result was such a garbled mess; it's almost like a parody of complicated films, yet the director calls it a political satire which stopped being it after the terms 'the world's rotation slowed down'.

Certainly the most confusing movie I've seen, this film instantly landed a spot in the top 5 worst films I have fallen victim to.

How did it get made?  That's the real mystery.  There weren't better scripts out there?  I could write a better script if I simply sat on the keyboard.  (Believe it or not, after this turd, somebody actually gave this guy money to direct another movie -- although not based on his script.)

It's like they gave a 14-year-old kid millions of dollars to make a movie and a single afternoon to write a script.  The script has no ideas or insight about anything -- terrorism, war, the media, the political machine, Marxism, you name it.  The movie is impossible to take literally (everybody's looking for Boxer, yet he can just go to a sidewalk cafe?), yet has nothing coherent to say on any allegorical level.

There are too many characters and the connections between them are unclear.  That voiceover guy seems to never stop introducing the movie, which initially reassures you since you're constantly confused, but clarity never comes.

Plus it just goes on forever.  Supposedly Andrew O'Hehir called this film ""about the biggest, ugliest mess I've ever seen.""

3269455,2,B000YQK14K,"Southland Tales lacks any focus whatsoever. If Richard Kelly could do basic math, he would have realized that with about 30 characters in his movie, even with a 2.5 hour running time, that gives each one an average of 5 minutes of screen time. If he knew the first thing about ensemble storytelling, he would have realized that each one of those characters has a story. And I'm not saying that 5 minutes isn't enough time to tell a story, but when you're watching 30 different five-minute ""Tales"" chopped up and strewn together at random, you spend half your time just keeping track of everyone. Did Miranda Richardson even have any lines? or did she just sit there looking menacing the whole time? Likewise, Justin Timberlake's character didn't seem to serve any purpose, and the movie would have been better off without him, although he does spend the last seconds of the movie telling us his relationship to Sean William Scott's character, which he has to TELL us because Richard Kelly never SHOWS them in a scene together. Can you tell I was frustrated with this movie?

The most hilarious part of the disc is the bonus featurette, in which about half the cast confesses that they too had no idea what the movie was about or how their character fit into it. Richard Kelly might argue that the movie is about chaos, and therefore it should be disjointed. Perhaps that's true--and let that be a lesson to every filmmaker out there: don't make a movie about chaos, unless you want it to suck. What this movie is really about, though, is The End of The World (as the characters themselves tell us over and over, with all the subtlety of a a dead-horse-beating, ""It ends not with a whimper, but with a bang""). In other words, Richard Kelly is really just recycling the same time-travel narrative that worked so well in Donnie Darko.

From the reaction of many of the actors it seemed that they were in doubt also. So many of them seemed lost as if they didn't know what the film was about. That's understandable. I've never seemed such a confused, meandering mess- even the excessive voice-over narration (always a bad sign) didn't help unravel it.

So many big (and formerly big) names were associated with this. And they all seemed to be going their own way independent of each other. Since so many of them were Saturday Night Live alums perhaps they were improvising the script as they went along...

I mean, I enjoy unconventional films but this one just seemed to degenerate to an ego-fueled freakshow with everyone doing his own thing with the barest nod to a plot tieing it all together. I know that they were trying to make a political statement here about the war and neoconservatism in general, but it really didn't work. It came across as a street circus embarassement. So many people trying to make ""hip"" social comments while endulging in shameless self promotion for the next project. Perhaps this truly is the soul of ""Southland.""

But, starting this Friday, controversial Southland Tales finally gets released nationwide. Southland Tales is a near-future dystopian satirical epic that starts with a bang, a home video sequence showing a nuclear attack on Texas from an unknown enemy. About 2  hours later, it ends with a bigger one, though whether it's the end of the world, the space-time continuum, or just LA, is up for some debate. What does matter is that in the path between those bangs, one filled with plenty of smaller explosions and death, comes a film experience unlike anything else--an explosion of mass media and camp; a pop opera.

Otherwise my rating would have been a thousand negative stars. This was billed as a comedy ... WHAT??? Where's the comedy??? Where's anything??? D. Johnson and J.

3269470,5,B000YQK14K,"I must say to start this review out strong this film is a MASTERPIECE! And so far this year there has not been a single film with such a fun cast and story line, but still able to make it a mind bending and political satire. Richard Kelly (Director) does such a great job on using his characters and making them important to the film and letting the audiance really care for them. Other than that the cast is AMAZING as you see above it just doesn't get any better than this. The Rock does a brilliant job as a man with with this huge crisis and is dealing with his two lives. also Sean William Scott who plays a local cop who holds the key to the wolds future and the 4-D environment that makes us whole and is keeping us together. Also a Suprising and Brilliant performance by Justin Timberlake A former soldier who was injured and now is protecting Boxer aka. The Rocks Character and he also narriates the whole film. I really think Justin Timberlake desirves a best suppoting actor award for his role in the film. This film does have a few flaws but not many at all. Also its a very funny film with a bunch of sex jokes and alot of vulger with suprising actually makes the film that much more enjoyable. I must say this is a film that will really mess with your head and will leave you wanting more, this film is almost like a quilty pleasure in disquise. This whole film is absolute eye-candy and Is my vote for best film of 2007.",1250121600,,1435,4.240875912408759

Me think movie will be good, because Stiffler in movie, and he make very funny movie about missing car!

Me think movie will have boobies, because Buffy and Mandy Moore in movie. Maybe Buffy and Mandy show booby to each other and kiss on face for me to see. Me would have liked that, but me very disappointed.

Me think movie trying to make deep political statement, but me no understand it just movie about a weird story, and not trying to have deep meaning.

Me think man who write movie have to be a devout Christian, because he mention Revelation so many times. Me no consider that Bible source of much symbolism in Western culture, and not everyone who have read it believe it.

Me think casting is bad!!! Me want to see more actors I like. Me no realize that casting this movie part of joke me no get. Me no get most jokes, unless joke about bathroom. :(

Me Like The Rock though, but me no understand why The Rock don't just smash bad guys with elbow. Me very confused about this.

Me no figure out movie to be comedy, even though half of cast came from TV sketch comedy shows; me no put that together, so me complain instead.

Me like story that is easy to understand, because me have short memory, and it hard for me to go back in head and assemble plot pieces in coherent order.

Southland Tales has a ton of social commentary mixed into a genius plot about the end of the world.  It's a satire and a black comedy, but mixes many genres along the way. You will need to see this more than once to understand it, because it reveals info that explains why the characters were acting so wierd before.

If you like movies that make you think, this is definetly one of them.  It also doesn't try much to explain itself, assuming a mature audience.  I hate seeing most movies, because they are fluffed-up and brainless wastes of time.  I really, really love this movie and it's probably the best movie of the decade.

Perhaps all that's necessary is a good editor to bring out the film that was clearly intended; one that's an over-the-top satire of 21st century life. In this world, porn stars, terrorists, politicians, cops, and A-list Hollywood actors often cross paths and form alliances on their way to fulfilling their various narcissistic agendas. They roam around, self-absorbed and self-unaware, grasping toward whatever decadent trinkets tickle their fancy, while the world is literally about to end.

Unfortunately, somewhere along the way the entire thing just became muddled and incomprehensible. Which is a shame, because with the writer/director of Donnie Darko at the helm and a slew of varied talent in the film, it really could have been something great.",1239753600,,840,5.412213740458015
3269478,1,B000YQK14K,"At some point I thought 'Southland Tales' was an ironic commentary on the Writer's Guild strike.  Was that the film's intention?  To show how poorly a movie could really be written?  Apparently, after reading about the film, this was not what Richard Kelly had in mind.

'Southland Tales' tries to be a dark comedy.  If you ignore this review and watch the film, you will find yourself wondering why it was cast with an endless stream of comedic actors.  Eventually you will come to understand that you should be knowingly laughing along with the mudddled mish-mash of ""hijinx.""  But, it just isn't funny and when dark comedies aren't funny, they end up being repugnantly bad.

And what's with all the David Lynch comparisons that keep popping up in regards to this film?  The possibility that you will enjoy this as a ""Lynch fan"" is incomprehensibe.  I think enjoying a Lynch film requires some aesthetic sensibilty and that sensibility would be completely offended by this lowbrow, incoherent, sophomoric barrage.  Any comparisons to Lynch are completely unfounded.  Furthermore, Lynch does not incorporate current events and ""E-news"" style cultural references in his films.  Which brings me to my next criticism.

'Southland Tales' (released in 2007 and set in the future - 2008!?!?) feels horribly dated. I fear this represents the retarded development of Richard Kelly.  It is as though Kelly has not grown out of the cultural milieu of his teen years.  The film is a jumbled mess of ""non-actors"" and TV comedians that made me think Kelly was casting heros from his adolescence for the sole purpose of expanding his autograph collection.  I'm sure Kelly will eventually be exposed as a dweeb with little depth whose desire to meet ""the Rock"" never should have been an excuse for making an insufferably bad movie.  Think Tarantino and Travolta... only way, way, way worse than 'Pulp Fiction'.

Easily in the running for the worst film of (at least) the last decade, the fact that a film with a clear anti-Bush agenda was derided at Cannes says that there is no audience anywhere in the world for 'Southland Tales'.  In retrospect, Kelly's second feature film makes one consider reassessing his first.",1238630400,12,2204,4.969945355191257

There are some funny parts like the Killers video in the middle but it doesn't make up for the mountain of bad things.

It's got all the kook tyranny of goverment stuff that was constant and viral from the left about the Bush administration as a sub-plot... at least the first 20 minutes did.

3269482,5,B000YQK14K,"Southland Tales is not your typical science fiction movie. It's not your typical thriller, or even your typical independent film (if there is such a thing). I don't know exactly what kind of film this is, and I don't think the creators of Southland Tales really know either. One thing for sure, this film is hysterical, as long as you don't take it too seriously.

Richard Kelly follows his dark cult film Donnie Darko with this portrait of an alternate version of America where darker events and imaginative technological developments have led to a more extreme version of the present day. Terrorist acts on American soil beyond 9/11 have led to more US military incursions around the globe and greater governmental control over civil liberties. It is mid-2008, and people connected to the Iraq war and the upcoming Presidential election are involved in a mysterious technological/mystical/religious/drug -addled conspiracy. The film centers on Boxer Santaros, a movie star married to the candidate for vice presidency's daughter, who suffers from amnesia. He finds himself in the company of Krystal Now, a porn star branching into the reality show/music/energy drink  business, who tells him he's directing and producing a thriller about the end of the world based on his own screenplay, which she has actually written herself. And the storyline gets much more convoluted from there.

The best way to make sense of this movie is to read Southland Tales: The Prequel Saga, a graphic novel written by Richard Kelly, which covers the events prior to the movie. No wait, it still won't make much sense. Well, it will at least explain some of the loose ends in more detail, such as how the characters got into the situations they're in at the beginning of the film: how Pilot Abilene (Justin Timberlake) and Roland Taverner (Seann William Scott) ended up in a friendly-fire incident that scarred them both; how the body in the box ended up in Simon Theory (Kevin Smith)'s possession; and what the heck Santaros mumbles when he gets overwhelmed. Reading the graphic novel will lessen (not eliminate) the number of times you say ""Huh?"" while watching, but nothing will stop the ever increasing times, as the movie continues, you'll  say ""What?"" in greater frequency and volume.

And therein lies the charm of this crazy, patch-work quilt of a movie. As you watch, you'll find yourself moving from willing disbelief to confusion to frustration and then to utter hysteria as the farcical nature of the labyrinthine story line overwhelms you. This will be easier for some to accept than others, for Richard Kelly didn't really intend for Southland Tales to so absurd, but unfortunately that's what it ends up being. The antics of the characters, and the depictions by the actors, are more and more hilarious as the film goes on.

There are too many uniquely memorable scenes and lines to encapsulate here, but some of the best are: Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson's depiction of Santaro's nervous fidgeting; Cheri Oteri as a psychotic henchman, accompanied by a deadpan Jon Lovitz channeling Rutger Hauer channeling Hannibal Lecter; Amy Proehler (from Saturday Night Live - theres's a lot of Saturday Night Live alumni here) and Wood Harris (from ""The Wire"") pretending to be a bride and groom in a domestic disturbance; Chris Lambert dealing arms out of a ice cream truck; Seann William Scott playing twin brothers who are both constantly injected with designer drugs causing them to interrupt their deadpan deliveries with cross-eyed collapse (over and over again); Wallace Shawn as a mad scientist wearing mascara and his thinning hair moussed into a curlicue on his forehead; Bai Ling revealing a hideous mole (apparently real) in her plunging (no, more like missing) neckline;  and one of my favorite actresses, Sarah Michelle Gellar, as Santoro's scheming porn-star love interest, delivering her lines with a waifish tone and ""come hither"" look. Gellar, and all the actors, do the best they can with the script, better suited for the world of comic books, but they can't keep the film from devolving into an unintentionally ridiculous commentary on the policies of Bush administration, and the director's view of the world Bush and his people tried to create.

Watching the film as a serious attempt as political commentary melded with futuristic science fiction will lead to frustrated disappointment, but the viewer who is looking for a wacky, comic-book-style ensemble performance will find the 2 and  hour film (that's 2  hours, be prepared for that) a enjoyable release from reality, even worthy of repeated viewing. If you're in the right frame of mind, you'll find tons of moments to talk about after the film is finished, like whether Gellar meant to sway on her high heels as she walks away in one scene, or Johnson's  personal belief about suicide, or Justin Timberlake's singing and dancing interlude (yes, that's right). If you come to this film knowing what it's like, then, like the red-headed stepchild of the family or the runt dog of the litter, it may soften your heart and become a favorite of yours.",1232668800,6,5111,5.022432113341204
3269483,3,B000YQK14K,"David Lynch is great. If you want to see a Lynch movie then watch Lynch. If you have seen all of lynch but want more then there are a few art-house pictures out there that meet those needs including the rare Hollywood outing. Southland Tales is one of those rare outings but you have seen it done better and there is a possibility that you might not like it all but you won't know until you have tried. If you like Lynch then the chance is that you will enjoy it somewhat. At the same time I have seen art-house fans walk away from this film so it's really a gamble. If you absolutely must need a coherent film then avoid it at all costs.

Southland Tales is a cross between The Fifth Element without the aliens, Strange Days and a dash of Beverly Hills 90210 on acid. It has anti-Bush messages, conspiracy theories, a biblical apocalypse and lots of sexual swearing. The story is almost impossible to discern but is about a Marxist movement in future L.A that is trying to topple a post-patriot act government by filming one of theirs in a compromising position with a porn star and a double-murder. There are so many side stories involving twins, perpetual motion, screenplays, drugs, snipers,  time travel and ice cream van gun dealers that it is impracticable to say what Southerland Tales is about but that isn't a bad thing. After all weird can be good.

However Southerland Tales does go wrong at times and this is undeniable fact evident by its urgent reworking in the edit room after being seriously mauled at the Cannes film festival by its critics, many of whom reckoned it was the worst film they had ever seen. Many of those critics though have since said that this version of Southerland Tales is much better with some even going so far as to say it is in so much better shape as to be deemed entertaining. In all fairness it is amusing but there are many times when the acting fails it to the point where you think those involved are deliberately trying to be contrived. Seeing The Rock tap his fingers together constantly during the second half simply looks plain dumb. There are many moments like that to put you off. In short, the director is to blame, which is a shame, because Donnie Darko is very cool.

However the director is young and this is only his second movie and let's face it, Southland Tales is better than a lot of what is on the shelves today. There are plenty direct to video releases that are simply blown away by the imagination and creativity that has gone into Southland Tales. It might not be Lynch, in fact it is categorically not, but being weird can't always to live up to such high standards of the unusual. This film will grow in time and maybe in a decade have a nice enough following to suggest that maybe you should have taken a peak while it was out. If you like odd then why not?",1232668800,5,2829,4.424184261036468
3269484,4,B000YQK14K,"This is NOTHING like Lynch, it is a postmodern movie, similar to the books Naked Lunch, by William Burroughs or Gravity's Rainbow by Pynchon. Pop references abound - half the movie is populated by Saturday night Live actors, mixing genres and even media, the first three chapters of the story can be found only in the `prequel' graphic novel, the movie starts in the middle much like star wars. Many of the actors seem to be in on the joke, cracking smiles knowingly. It deconstructs itself as we watch it, cannibalizing other movies as it goes. The Rock plays a superstar actor, which he actually is in real life, the movie almost spills into reality, it never lets you forget that this is all a farce, fake, a movie - and then shows you that real life in many ways is also a farce. In a nod to David Lynch Rebekah Del Rio sings in a scene, as she does in Mulholland Drive. The movie even recycles certain time travel elements from the director's first movie Donnie Darko. It's pop culture turned in on itself, Shakespeare's play within a play, or the postmodern creed of ""Nothing is true. Pop cult personality Kevin Smith plays the leader of a neo-marxist group, the movie doesn't even pretend to take itself seriously yet the issues really are deadly serious. Like the Media and pop culture its turns the world's issues, even the world itself, into one giant false spectacle. Postmodern author J.G. Ballard, author of Crash, in 1970 predicted that within a few years we'd all be living in one giant T.V. studio. The news and media now define our consensus of what reality is, we are told and sold on what's really going on. Dance pop star Justin Timberlake parodies himself, reflecting the ugliness of MTV culture his face is scarred, he does an MTV style video musical number of The Killer's ""All These Things That I've Done."" He also plays an Iraq war veteran, which shows how commercialized and vulgarized war has become, its now practically entertainment: ""I think I'll turn on CNN and watch the War show."" So, within a self-referencing postmodern context I think it succeeds as a critique of our post 911, post Christian (the movie repeats twice that the NY times has reported that god is dead) world which has no center and the distinction between reality and media is becoming blurred. The candidate's for president and vice-president have the last names Frost/Eliot, both Robert Frost and T.S. Eliot are quoted throughout, Frost being the last modernist poet, while Eliot wrote the first postmodern poem - `The Wastelands,' which this film somewhat resembles in spirit.

Pulling a coherent narrative out of this mess would require more effort on my part than writer / director Richard Kelly apparently made to put one in.

There are some excellent visuals here and it can be fun to play ""spot the recognizable character actor,"" but I'll be darned if I know what it was about.  With so many pointless and inconclusive subplots going on, I just became bored after a while, but I stuck it out to the end, which left me unenlightened.

Did terrible at the box office, and even now has a growing army of fans.  10 years from now, it'll probably be shown regularly at college campuses at midnight, with people showing up dressed as different characters from the film, and shouting the lines at the screen.

It's like that.  If you don't like it after 15 minutes, don't bother. If dark satire about how vain and screwed up American culture is annoys you, don't bother. If wild free form interpretation of scripture bothers you, don't bother. But if you watch it and something gets under your skin, watch it again.  Watch it 7 times.  It gets clearer and clearer what it's about the more you see it, because it's just too dense to get in one sitting. I didn't really 'like' it the first time I saw it, but I was intrigued by the different layers of subtext, just enough to watch it again.  Then I started to really laugh at the jokes...

What's it about?  It's a pop culture free poem about Los Angeles, mostly, and the post 9/11 ultra-right mentality.  It's very much about the Revelation of St. John, and the 2 main characters would seem at different points to be Jesus or John. And it's a hardcore black comedy.
It's the Anti-""Magnolia"", really.  It's a bunch of vain, disparate characters intersecting in a way that brings about the end of the world.

If that's your cup of tea, jump in.  ;)  But don't be fooled by the fact that this film appears to be a thrown together impromptu mess, it's not.  It's deeply layered, and carefully put together.. it's just hard to see it on one casual viewing.

The Blu ray transfer is lovely, though you will notice a little grain in some of the composite effects near the end (smoking buildings, etc).

A nice bonus to this release is the inclusion of the 'Southland Tales Prequel Saga' on the disc.  You can read the whole graphic novel frame by frame, and it does add some important background material, especially about the mysterious 'FluidKarma'.. where it comes from, what it does, and why Fallujah was such a mess.

This addition makes this disc a real bargain for fans of this film!",1225929600,53,2213,4.517587939698492

If you were not a fan of Donnie Darko, stop reading here as you will probably hate this film. However, if you appreciate Richard Kelly's genius, he has actually outdone himself in this, his sophomore effort. I won't attempt to explain the plot to you, just read the tag ""This is the Way the World Ends"", nuff said. There are so many intricate plot threads, obtuse characters, and out there scenarios that it takes a good 2-3 viewings to comprehend what you are seeing. Imagine watching every cable news channel at once and you start to get the idea. If you do become a fan of this film, I would highly recommend the graphic novel tie-in, which is actually the first 3 chapters of the movie (Kelly took a cue from George Lucas and began in the middle of the story). It makes the setup much easier to understand, and contains elements that would have been much too expensive to film with the budget they had. I think that when people look back at this trainwreck of a decade, this film perfectly encompasses the atmosphere of post 9/11 America, with all of the paranoia, police state, turn-in-your-neighbor mentality the Bush administration has fostered.",1223510400,,1241,4.697247706422019

3269495,1,B000YQK14K,"I hesitantly agreed to rent this with my boyfriend a couple of weeks ago. I saw the ensemble actor list and thought that perhaps it might be okay, if nothing brilliant. Was. I. Ever. Wrong.

I am the type of person that will usually see the good points in any film, be it a classic like 'Casablanca' or C-Grade movies like ""From Justin to Kelly"". But it was impossible to find any such merits with this film. I truly believe that the makers of this film intended it to be watched while dropping acid. That is the only way this film could have been understood. While I saw the long list of actors as a positive (after all, they must have read the script and gave carefull consideration as to its worth) but in the back of my mind, a concern itched that too many main characters might make the film hard to follow. DUH! So, they had a few dozen story lines going in completely different directions, each one with its bizarre futuristic twist, and unbelievable scenarios, and at times the dialogue was so bad I almost believe the writers were trying to invent their own language. At the end of the movie, my boyfriend and I sat, jaw-slacked at the sheer incredibility of what we had seen. We could not describe it else to anyone we had seen, but only to say that watching it for free (we had a free rental) was a complete waste of our time and we sorely regretted the two hours (was it really two? seemed like 10) of hour lives we wasted that we will never get back. Don't buy it, don't rent it. Don't let someone bamboozle you into watching over at their house. Trust me, you will regret it.",1221696000,2,1589,4.31438127090301
3269496,5,B000YQK14K,"You have to pay attention to catch all the intricate details of what is going on. That is difficult to do in the beginning because the narrator overwhelms you with background information about the politcal & economic state of things very quickly. You learn about the actual characters in the film more by observing their on screen behavior and settings than by being ""told"" their true motives and connections in a flat out obvious way.

The subplots converge at the end of the film. At its core it shows how subculture A connects with subculture B connects with subculture C and so on and yet how each individual simultaneously functions as a separate entity with their own personal motivations. If you are impatient only knowing bits and pieces of how who and what fits in with this and that throughout the movie you won't like it. If you are one of those people who needs the core of the film to be meagerly disguised by simplistic foreshadowing in the first 15 minutes this film is not for you.

We get to learn what makes the characters tick and what makes them human by observing them in action. We don't get many long soliliqueys about what their ""thoughts"" happen to be. Imagery in the sets/costumes and the actor's facial expressions/body language express more about the inner feelings of the characters than the dialogue. The cast gave excellent performances.

The sets in this move were very well done - be sure to check them out when you watch it the second time through.

Again, it's really about all the subplots of groups of people - how they occaisionally interwine and everything only makes perfect sense at the very end of the film. I enjoyed it thoroughly.",1218672000,5,1674,4.683673469387755
3269497,2,B000YQK14K,"Set in post-nuclear Southern California (the Southlands), this film tells the stories of a number of different characters - in particular, amnesiac actor Boxer Santaros (Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson), porn star Krysta Now (Sarah Michelle Geller), and twin police officers Roland and Ronald Taverner (Seann William Scott) -  with the actions of all of these characters ultimately leading to the grand finale of the end of the world.

Many of the elements of this film will be familiar to those who have already seen ""Donnie Darko""; once again Kelly deals with time travel, politics and the apocalypse. However, he did a lot better job of dealing with them in his first film. As many other reviewers have pointed out, ""Southland Tales"" is barely coherent. The individual scenes within the film aren't actually all that bad , and I enjoyed many of them while I was watching this film (the scene in which Justin Timberlake drunkenly lipsyncs his way through ""All These Things That I've Done"" made the film worth my time), but together a lot of it really doesn't make all that much sense. Some of what is going on is explained in the final half-hour of the film, and I was pretty proud of myself for being able to explain 75% of the plot. Nevertheless, I haven't the faintest idea what any of it means - although, for the record, that didn't actually bother me all that much. I did like this film, I just don't think it's great and I didn't like it enough to rewatch it in order to understand it better.

""Southland Tales"" is worth watching once, if you happen to be a Richard Kelly fan, or a fan of one of the multitude of big name actors in this film (it still puzzles me how Kelly managed to convince so many top actors to appear in this film - even if you like it, you would have to agree that it's not exactly mainstream), and your expectations aren't too high. However, it's probably best to rent this one first and see if you like it, before you hand over the chunk of your hard-earned cash necessary to become the proud owner of this film on DVD.",1218499200,,2046,4.509433962264151
3269498,3,B000YQK14K,"Southland Tales is such a bizarre, gonzo trip into dystopic apocolypse lunatic comedy-musical-sci-fi-stoner-headtrip-thriller land, it seems beside the point to even try and register it as good or bad.  The flaws are evident and intetional - most of the time, I'm fairly convinced the movie dares you to even try to like it.  I'll try and make as quick of a synopsis of the plot as I can make - there was a nuclear attack in Texas, the world's at war, we're out of oil, there's a solution but it might throw the earth off its axis a bit and it's spearheaded by a crazy-looking freak played by Wallace Shawn who has a fondness for TV ads involving cars having sex (seriously).  Also, there's the Boxing/movie star hunk who's the son-in-law of the Democratic vice-presidential candidate who's got amnesia and is shacking up with a porn superstar who's vaguely connected to a group of marxist rebels attempting to dissuade a congressional vote on... something... and also Seann William Scott is an infiltrating set of identical twins... who's also doing something.  Oh, and Justin Timberlake narrates with cryptic quotes from the Book of Revelations.  So, to put it mildly, the movie's plot is excessive, tough to swallow, and teeters back and forth from being completely over the top and just-sorta acceptable.  And the casting - from The Rock, Cheri Oteri, Jon Lovitz, Amy Poehler, Mandy Moore, Nora Dunn, Sarah Michelle Gellar, and John Larroquette in main roles - is even more ridiculous.  Still, with so much easy to dismiss the movie, it's hard to say it doesn't have drive, and just when the movie veers over the cliff, a scene of extraordinary humor or emotion pops up and surprises you.  Sarah Michelle Gellar and Nora Dunn in particular are given scenes of just outrageous lines (says Gellar on her hot-topic porn talk show, ""Violence is a big problem in today's society.  That's the primary reason I won't do anal""), and their scenes are viciously entertaining.  One extraordinary over the top scene finds Gellar, The Rock, and Moore trading one-ups in something that's like a soap opera gone drug-addled.  And the scene to truly savor is the weirdest - a music video in an arcade hall in which Justin Timberlake's wounded, crazy drug addict war hero lipsynchs and parties to The Killer's ""All These Things That I've Done.""  That scene takes the movie's drug-trip kitsch and makes it electrifying, letting Timberlake's scarred face and dark, desperate eyes somehow reveal a life within the confines of a crazy dance number.  Such an aberration, it electrifies the movie around it as it veers away from rational explanation and silliness and back again in its 2 1/2 hours.  I'd say this movie - ridiculous and wonderful in spurts - clocks in somewhere over the 50% mark, making the rewards slightly greater than the work you have to do to put up with the movie.",1216598400,,2868,4.838445807770961

Have you ever watched a movie and it reminded you of 2 or 3 other movies?  This movie falls into that category.  This movie reminded me of at least 20 other movies.  The Top 3 being ""A Clockwork Orange"", ""The Magic Christian"" and ""Timecop.""  Those three movies are infinitely better than this movie.  Please watch those movies if you want to watch a good movie.

One of the posted reviews compares this movie to ""Brazil.""  That is an insult to ""Brazil.""  Other reviewers said it contains great symbolism.  Great symbolism does NOT mean a great movie.  This movie is proof of that.  Technically speaking, a 90 minute montage of swastikas is great symbolism too, but I do not want to watch that either.  If you want truly great symbolism, please watch Pink Floyd's movie ""The Wall.""

Justin Timberlake is in this movie.  I am so sick of seeing him in movies.  I refuse to see any future movies in which he is a cast member.  It is a shame that Heath Ledger passed away and Justin Timberlake is still with us.

This movie had one redeeming scene that prevented me from tossing out the DVD.  That is the scene where Cheri Oteri beats up an arms dealer.  I LOVED that scene.  I am a big fan of Cheri Oteri.  I will always look forward to seeing her in a movie.

I also expected much better from Dwayne Johnson.  This is the only movie of his that has disappointed me.

I flat out refuse to watch any movies from the guy who directed this phenominal waste of money.  Hollywood should get together and throw this guy out of Hollywood.

3269502,5,B000YQK14K,"I want to preface this review with a humble mention of Suckerdwsp316's earlier offering. I almost replied positively to that, but I think Southland Tales deserves a little more defence out here. I won't be rehashing other reviews here, either. I won't be discussing what the movie is 'about', its plot or characters. While these are important factors, I think Southland Tales deserves a slightly more critical approach.

Okay -- first things first: I saw Donnie Darko well after the initial wave of bad reviews, well after it became a cult hit. I saw it simply because I'd heard it was a unique experience that left your brains in a puddle. I hate to say this but statements like that don't always move me; I've done the English Lit. thing, read some pretty unfriendly things (Joyce, Woolf, Stein, etc.etc.). But Donnie Darko convinced me that Kelly is a genius. No problem there whatsoever. Not was -- is.

So this is what I'm not getting: if a movie that bombed at first took a few years to be 'discovered' (and by some of you, no doubt) and then was recognised as a work of brilliance, why is everyone doing it all over again now? As I watched Southland Tales for the first time (just last night), I had this incredible feeling that I was riding the wave I missed with Donnie Darko. That someday, when people catch up, I could say to myself 'ah, I saw this coming'.

In their review, Suckerdwsp316 mentions other films that failed at the box office but became hits (blade runner, perfect example). I want to take this a bit further and reference James Joyce's Ulysses, which was banned for years for its crudeness/pornography and got panned by a who's who of the in-crowd of literature back in the 1920s. Without guidance and a real sense of patience, Ulysses is a trainwreck to read. It switches POV, voice, tense, style...you name it. And then, because writing the most difficult English novel wasn't enough for Joyce, he followed it up with Finnegans Wake, which makes Ulysses look almost linear.

'Southland Tales' may be considered Kelly's Finnegans Wake. One review elsewhere on the web stated that ST isn't 'about' chaos -- it *is* chaos. This is precisely what is said about Wake, and it's part of what makes it virtually unreadable. Thankfully, the film medium has a lot more to offer at 'first glance' than the written, and Southland Tales is entirely more accessible than Joyce's work. Whether you take it as a bad mish-mash of Saturday Night Live skits, a strange pastiche of weird sci-fi and socio-political commentary or as a wannabe-Darko, ST still allows itself to be judged as something more than utter chaos.

And if at this point you're thinking 'My God, this reviewer is some uppity academic artsy-fartsy wanker', I guess the only thing I can say in my defence is I didn't (and would hate to) watch this film alone, or even with another 'academic'. I *despise* 'art' that asks you to make more of what is there than actually is; Southland Tales does quite the opposite, and it's a clever trick that is almost as pretentious. You have something fairly simple told in a very convoluted, complex way. Again, here we have a parallel to Ulysses, which is about a guy who wanders around Dublin, masturbates a lot, drinks himself stupid and is fairly certain his wife is cheating on him.

Southland Tales isn't high art -- it's pop, it's crass, it's horribly post-modern, it's politically saturated. The miscasting is too obvious and it works (especially Mandy Moore and 'The Rock'), which raises questions of whether it's really 'mis'casting at all. Without Kelly's unique flare for bombast and wit, Southland Tales could easily have been (and to many viewers, was) a film student-level epic failure of clumsy ambition and unrealised concepts.

I'm not saying that this will be Donnie Darko 2.0, that people will suddenly start championing it after years of deriding it. This belated crusade didn't really happen with Finnegans Wake, either. But I am saying that just as the literary world is richer for James Joyce (even if you never read his stuff, it 'had' to be written), Richard Kelly fills a void no one really noticed until he was there filling it. He did it with Donnie Darko, and there's really no indication he hasn't done it with Southland Tales. Okay, I'll take a small subjective risk: I believe Southland Tales is better than Donnie Darko, and I suspect that Richard Kelly, who must be very conscious that ST is his hope that 'lightning strikes twice', knows it. Someday (if not already), people will be writing papers on Kelly's work, which isn't something you can say about a lot of 'other' one-star movies out there.

Having said all that, can I recommend 'Southland Tales'? Only if you saw Donnie Darko and liked it for whatever you thought it was, not for what everyone said it was. And if you haven't seen Donnie Darko, it's probably a gentler introduction to Richard Kelly's inimitable style.",1213833600,3,4930,4.76463700234192

3269512,1,B000YQK14K,"I wish I could say I liked Southland Tales. I really really wish I could. But this movie, in more than one way, is quite possibly one of the worst movies released in recent history. I liked ""Donnie Darko,"" despite it being ""out there,"" but this movie is not only out there, but also not good. A more lethal combination than ammonia and bleach. Even the actors THEMSELVES, admit in the on of two Special Features on the DVD that they don't even know what the movie is about. I actually bought this DVD, just because it has The Rock, Mandy Moore, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Amy Poehler, Cheri Oteri, Justin Timberlake (who was good in ""Alpha Dog""), Seann William Scott, and many other name stars in it. I've liked every movie The Rock has been in (even The Gameplan, believe it or not!) but this movie shouldn't even star him. Or any of the name stars they have in this utter Disasterpiece pretending to be an arthouse sci-fi drama movie. They say this movie is a ""comedy""??? But there's not a single thing funny in it. (other the commercial with the SUV's having sex doggie style. That was funny, at least.) I don't know what genre this movie fits in. It's not much of sci-fi, drama, OR comedy. I guess you'd call it the ""weird pretenious crap"" genre.

There's some kind of plot, but quite honestly, no one could really tell there is. I'll try, though. A terrorist attack in Abilene, Texas in alternate universe July 2005 America forces the United States to go to war with the entire Middle East, re-instate the draft, and to create a ""Big Brother"" style branch of government created off the Patriot Act called USIdent. USIdent controls all surveillence, media and web activity and are watching Americans everywhere in the country. A family of Republicans control USIdent and a corrupt state senator is the Republican frontrunner for the 2008 Presidental Election (and Hilary Clinton, eerily enough, is the Democratic frontrunner.) The Presidental nominee's daughter is played by Mandy Moore, and her husband is famous action star Boxer Santaros, played by The Rock. But the weekend before the Fourth of July 2008, he goes missing, and Krysta Now, played by Sarah Michelle Gellar, finds him and hides him out at her place in L.A.

Krysta Now is a retired porn star turned reality star and hosts her own beachside debate show, featuring other porn stars, where the government, global warming, and teenage horniness are the topics of discussion each week. In their short time together, Santaros and Now have fallen in love, and have written a screenplay together called The Power, which is essentially Southland Tales within Southland Tales. Krysta's friends, run an underground anti-USIdent site called ""USIDeath"" and are neo-Marxists trying to ""fight the power."" After finding out that Krysta Now has been hiding the missing Boxer Santaros, son-in-law to the Republican nominee, they make up a plan to stage a murder in Santaros' presence, hoping to throw the upcoming election into chaos so that Clinton will win in November. However, the neo-Marxists' plan gets messed, and Boxer Santaros' whereabouts become known. Some other stuff happens, Santaros' wife and Krysta Now fight over Boxer Santaros, his memory starts to return, time-travel is inexplicably thrown in, a science-fiction alternative to oil threatens the world, and the Apocalypse is about to happen.

Now, that's the best way I can describe this movie's ""plot."" Justin Timberlake, as a soldier home from Iraq narrates the story and the whole thing is told in a much more complex, confusing way than anyone trying to read the plot of the movie on paper, or on the internet, could possibly understand. The ""ending"" makes no sense and the whole introduction of a time traveling conspiracy in a movie that mostly satirizes the American government makes absolutely no sense. All we know is that ""The world won't end in a whimper, but in a bang,"" and that ""pimps don't commit suicide.""

Why, oh WHY on God's green Earth would ANY of these talented actors choose to do a movie like this? Were they, also, like many of the people who seen this movie and mistook it's randomness and idiocy for ""genius""? That's probably would upsets me the most. The Rock, Sarah Michelle Gellar, and others are in this movie, when it doesn't deserve to have any talented actors in it, at all. This movie is an utter train wreck, and I don't say that too often. As an aspiring screenwriter, I usually give most movies some level of credit. I mean, the general consenus is, ""if they got it made, it MUST be good on some level, right?"" But as I rent more and more of these ""obscure"" movies, I'm starting to realize just how bad some movies are and just how perplexing Hollywood works. So what if the writer/director made ""Donnie Darko""? That doesn't warrant this movie ever seeing the light of day. The last movie I've seen this bad was ""TV: The Movie"" starring Steve-O from ""[...].""

There are some movies which are ""bad"" because of the plot. Or ""bad"" because of the actor choice. Or ""bad"" because the director, or short budget, or whatever. A ""bad movie"" is very subjective. Like, I would call a ""bad movie"" anything by M. Night Shamalyan. But others may disagree. However, even with the actors in this though, I think I can honestly say this movie is just Universally Bad. There are so many side-plots and meaningless subplots, the ""main story,"" which already makes little sense, is hardly even the main focus. This movie has Boxer Santaros' tale, but also Krysta Now's struggle to be taken seriously in mainstream Hollywood, Roland the cop's (played by Seann William Scott) story to find his time clone, the story of Krysta's neo-Marxist friends and their Trying To Ruin The Election story, and Justin Timberlake's soldier story, which for some reason, involves a musical number. Seperately, or if given enough time, many of these stories could possibly work, but when mashed up together like this, often with no reason or exposition given, they just all come together literally like a car wreck (or rather, Ice Cream Truck wreck). There is no sanity, or logic, or ""stuff that makes sense"" in this whole movie. Like I said, it's just a complete wreck. Not the ""brilliant piece of art"" it thinks it is.

Avoid this AT ALL COSTS! It's not even a ""so bad, it's funny"" type of movie. It's just a confusing, muddled mess of a disaster, which goes in all sorts of different directions, but never gets anywhere. It's sad to see talent wasted like this. I can't believe how many talented stars signed up for this craptastic piece of crap. It's a movie, in such a way, that it actually can ruin careers, mich like 2007's blockbuster Lindsay Lohan hit, ""I Know Who Killed Me."" I hope that when I become a filmmaker, I NEVER make something this horrible. If there's any lesson to be learned, it's ""This is how you make a really, really bad movie and call it 'artistic brillance.'""",1210982400,4,6905,4.769230769230769

Over all worth watching, I just wish the DVD had more back ground to fill in some gaps.",1210809600,2,753,4.449275362318841
3269514,2,B000YQK14K,"Okay, here's the thing. You have to see this movie. If you're a fan of Richard Kelly's ""Donnie Darko"", if you're a Sci-Fi Fan, if you're just a fan of films in general, you need to see this film. There are just a few things you should do first.

1) Get a little toasted. Score a couple joints (And I'd like to say here that I absolutely am not encouraging or condoning the use of illegal drugs. I'm just saying.), bum a Vicodin from Uncle Sal with the back pain, buy a 6 pack. If you're into yoga do some deep breathing exercises and get a good oxygen buzz going. Whatever. Trust me, it'll help.

2) You probably shouldn't see this movie alone because you're going to need someone to vent to. So invite some friends over. If you have a friend that especially hates sci-fi, be sure invite them because, well, it's always good to torture your friends when you get the chance. Just don't be upset when people start throwing things at your television.

3) Leave the volume on your set alone. You know how sometimes when you're watching a movie and you can't quite figure out what's going on and you can't quite understand what the heck people are talking about? So you turn up the volume up? Don't bother. It's not going to help.

And,

4) Don't expect a payoff. And I know, generally when you watch a movie, even if it's a bad movie, there's some kind of payoff at the end. Some emotionally or intellectually satisfying moment that makes the journey worthwhile. But this is ""Southland Tales"" and it's just not going to happen. Just let it go.

That said,

You still need to watch this movie. Partly because of the people in it. Yes, Justin Timberlake and Sarah Michelle Gellar and The Rock are all there but Jon Lovitz is also in it. John Larroquette is in it. Mandy Moore is in it. Kevin Smith is in it. Even that kind of bald guy from ""The Princess Bride"" is in it. We have to of course assume that nobody (Seriously.) read a script before they signed on but they're all there and they're fun to watch. And you have to watch this movie partly because it's the sort of movie that if you're flipping through channels on the TV and you run across it you have no choice but to stop and watch. Because pretty much any arbitrary 15 minutes of this movie is utterly fascinating. The sets, the characters, the execution, even the dialogue will all suck you in. It is, in parts, brilliant and  it's only when you string two and a half hours worth of these 15 minute segments together that you get a movie that makes you want to pull your hair out. Because there really is no coherent plot and the story, such as it is, doesn't make sense. Richard Kelly tries to do great things here and fails. He fails gloriously, which, I suppose, is the way you should fail, but he still fails. So buy a case of beer, have the gang over and settle in for one of the most amazingly frustrating movies you've ever seen. You'll be better for it in the end.",1210464000,4,2929,4.3224043715847
3269515,1,B000YQK14K,"""Southland Tales,"" the latest film by ""Donnie Darko""'s Richard Kelly, is like the movie equivalent of one of those whistles that only dogs can hear; it is pitched so far out of ordinary human range that most viewers will be wondering where the hell the joke is and why they just don`t get it.

The movie, made in 2006 and released in 2007, takes place in Los Angeles in the not-too-distant future (July 2008), three years after a series of nuclear explosions have all but obliterated Texas and placed the rest of the country on a state of high terror alert.  As in most post-apocalyptic scenarios, the threat to national security opens the door for a right wing cabal to take over the government and begin violating the privacy rights of its citizens.  For counterbalance, there is also a group of loony neo-Marxists bent on wresting control from the aforementioned Fascists.  The movie features Dwayne Johnson (aka The Rock) as a conservative movie star and future son-in-law to a Republican vice-Presidential candidate who becomes a pawn in the life-or-death match between the two clashing ideologies - the outcome of which might well spell the demise of the human race as we know it.

Despite the seriousness and topicality of the subject matter, ""Southland Tales"" is basically played for laughs, turning the end of the world into an absurd, over-the-top, dystopic farce that thinks it's being hip and knowing about life in a post-9/11/Homeland Security/ Patriot Act world, but which is actually only cheesy, smart-alecky and incoherent.  For a satire to work it must have discipline as well as the kind of tethering to the real world that one finds in movies like ""Dr. Strangelove"" or ""Network.""  Here, the film establishes no familiar reference point upon which to build any kind of compelling drama.  As a result, we quickly lose interest and focus, while the enterprise itself spins ever increasingly out of the filmmaker's control.

Janeane Garofalo, Sarah Michelle Gellar, John Larroquette, Jon Lovitz, Mandy Moore, Amy Poehler, Miranda Richardson, Seann William Scott, Wallace Shawn and Justin Timberlake are just some of the actors who might want to seriously consider getting this piece of cinematic excrescence expunged from their resumes.

The greatest offense wrought by this eclectic and unholy mixture of sophomoric satire, comic book realism, grunge chic and apocalyptic paranoia is that it runs for an interminable two hours and twenty-four minutes, making this hands-down the most unendurable and unwatchable movie travesty I've encountered in years.",1210204800,22,2570,5.15625
3269516,5,B000YQK14K,"Actually, haven't watched it yet, but I recommend any movie with Mandy Moore in it.  I love her!  I bought it just because she is in it!!",1210118400,3,137,4.037037037037037
3269517,1,B000YQK14K,"First off, Sarah Michelle Gellar was as beautiful as ever.

Unfortunately, that's the only good thing I can say about this film. Disjointed, confusing, bad dialogue, horrible acting, no plot (if there is one, please, someone explain it)...basically, you name it, that's what was wrong with this waste of time.

I rented Southland Tales on Sunday. It took me three days to get through. On Sunday I watched 10 minutes and turned it off. On Monday I decided to try again and that time I got through 30 minutes before I became nauseas. On Tuesday I started from that 30 minute mark and finished it. Every time I was hoping it would get better but it got progressively worse and confusing.

I'm one of the few people who didn't like Donnie Darko but it was ten times better than Southland Tales. I don't mind David Lynch style films. I love Mulholland Drive, Blue Velvet, The Elephant Man, and Lost Highway. But Richard Kelly is no David Lynch. Probably the only thing Kelly has going for him is the screenplay for Domino which wasn't that bad.

I digress. My review isn't that constructive but it's hard to be constructive when everything about a film is wrong. Southland Tales should have never been made.",1210118400,4,1202,4.65566037735849

3269519,4,B000YQK14K,"Sometimes you don't have to understand everything to enjoy it.  Some movies are like amusement park rides, or maybe like hurricanes--you just have to sit back and ride it out.  Let it be what it is, forget what you want it to be and let it wash over you.  There are so many layers here.  This movie is a subliminal experience.

Much of it is sensationally enjoyable to me.  It's a wonderful satire.  I loved most of the message--particularly the anti-war, anti-government and pro-freedom, pro-sexuality messages--these were among the most overt thematic elements.  There are many layers here, and people who aren't well versed in socio-political theory will miss some of them, as well as those who don't connect such ideas with biblical apocalyptic theology.  Yeah, that's a lot to expect, and I could probably do just as well with less of the biblical.  But you don't have to know how the trigonometry moved the wheels to enjoy the roller coaster ride.

It's an epic fantasy period piece, with less emphasis on traditional storytelling and more of an eye for creating a memorable cinematic experience.  Of course there will be at least as many who ""don't get it"" as there are who have no real understanding of our current socio-political reality.  Most of the countless nuances here seem to have real meaning, and connect to both the themes and story.  This is what separates literate communication from artsy trash.  ST manages to remain the former, if by a hair's breadth.

I'm not entirely certain whether this movie is as smart as I would like to believe, but it certainly is never boring.  It is engaging, original, beautifully filmed entertainment, with one of the finest soundtracks in recent memory.  Even Gellar's single is remarkable--not to mention one of the boldest and truest political statements I've heard in years.

""This is the way the world ends.""  That's what it is, not a story so much as a moving portrait--mostly of our schizophrenic, self-destructing culture, but also of the hope that we may ultimately find in self-forgiveness,in the hovering interdimensional ice-cream truck of love.",1209772800,4,2111,4.9601139601139606
3269520,4,B000YQK14K,"I feel Richard Kelly is a genius, blending science fiction plots into the modern film the way many top writers do. It seems the reviews are going towards the negative for this film. I agree: odd. But if you want entertainment, a movie with sci fi themes that you can follow, Southland Tales is it.

I just watched it for fun. I didn't plan on reviewing it, but, since so many think the film is ""terrible"", I saw a reason to write.

In short, you have what others are saying: A picture of how the world ends. You have Justin Timberlake, The Rock, and a ton of other young actors, or actors who seem  to specialize in more B films. This is, in many ways, a B film. It comes close to the complexity of Donnie Darko, one of my favorite films of all time. And it's far more ambitious, almost, almost realizing its ambition. While the film is odd, so was Donnie Darko. While it has some odd science fiction elements, so did Donnie Darko. The point with Donnie Darko was you didn't feel like you were traveling around the world in a huge, sprawling epic, which is what Southland Tales is.

You have travels through time and memories and lost identities. You also have B movie stars rising above their general acting skills. It's a portrait of a future that could be.

The soundtrack was done by Moby, which truly fit in with the odd film that Richard Kelly has here. I am not sure if I would buy it; perhaps you should watch it first. It's an odd epic for people with odd tastes.",1209600000,4,1472,4.299638989169675

3269522,5,B000YQK14K,Weird? But of course. If you watched Donnie Darko you know Richard Kelly revels in the bizarre and absurd. Now imagine he had a bigger budget and the carte blanche to do whatever he wanted. Yea... that's about what this movie is like. My ex-girlfriend hated it when we saw it opening night. That's all I need to say...,1209254400,2,318,4.406779661016949
3269523,1,B000YQK14K,"Seriously, this film is bad.  It is incomprehensible.  The cast is stellar, the plot is nonexistent.  I am a huge fan of The Rock, but this movie just doesn't make sense.",1209254400,3,170,4.419354838709677
3269524,3,B000YQK14K,"My introduction to Richard Kelly was with the fantastic ""Donnie Darko"".  In my opinion, this was just a perfect movie.  The dialogue, the story, the twists and turns, the characters, the special effects, the music, all of these things make it hands down one of my favorite movies ever.  So naturally I was looking forward to ""Southland Tales"".  Slightly discouraged by some of the merciless negative reviews I was hearing, I still had to see it for myself.

Well, while I don't quite agree with the aforementioned negative reviews, I can't say that I was terribly pleased with this one either.  The concept is initially compelling, the look at a post-apocalyptic future in which World War 3 is in full swing, and society in general has descended into chaos.  America is divided between extremists on the left-wing and right-wing sides, and both are so voracious and corrupt that they don't even seem to be at odds for any reason other than the pure sake of it.  In short, things just aren't really going too well.

Unfortunately, the problem here is that the concept never really takes a particularly interesting form.  In fact, it's so incredibly all over the place that it pretty much just breaks down into a total mess.  The huge ensemble cast, consisting of The Rock, Sean William Scott, Sarah Michelle Gellar, and countless others makes for a hugely complex storyline that in my opinion ultimately lacks focus.  There's not enough concentration on any one character to really get behind them, and many of the characters are fairly stupid and uninteresting, which makes it sort of hard to care too much about them.

Another big problem here is that the movie seems to recycle many components from ""Donnie Darko"" (I won't go into it, but you'll see what I mean), as well as many other movies for no apparent reason.  Chief among them is the weird musical number with Justin Timberlake lip-synching to the Killers, which looks like some sort of pointless nod to ""Across the Universe"".  Then there's the cameo appearance from Rebekah Del Rio, who you may remember as the woman who sang in ""Mulholland Drive"", who is again singing in almost the same sort of surreal fashion.  Now granted it is pretty cool, and she's an amazing singer, but hey, David Lynch got there first.

Then there's the hilariously cheesy plot twist of spacesuit wearing evildoers (one of which is fortunately a cool cameo from Kevin Smith, complete with long gray beard)who have come up with the ingenious plan of slowing down the earth's rotation to drive everyone crazy, which looks and sounds like something straight out of an Ed Wood movie.  If by this point you still haven't figured out that this movie is trying to do way too many things at once, this will definitely cap it.

I really hate to sound so harsh here.  This isn't really terrible by any means, but considering that Kelly is obviously a really talented guy, my expectations were much higher than this.  Maybe if I watch this a few more times, I may appreciate it a little more, but this definitely lacks the focus and flawless execution of ""Donnie Darko"".  Not to mention compared to other gritty apocalyptic sci-fi future-type movies that have come out recently (""A Scanner Darkly"", ""Children of Men""), this one definitely falls short.

Check it out if you're interested, but definitely don't expect too much.  Here's hoping Richard Kelly won't turn out to be a one-film wonder.  I think he's still got it in him to do something great, but this ain't it.",1208736000,,3497,4.778702163061564
3269525,4,B000YQK14K,"I'm pretty sure this film was intended in the light I viewed it in, sort of a wacky scatterbrained vision of this alternate future, and in that respect, I found it to be a throughly enjoyable film.
The final line of the film (which I won't reveal)for example and its previous utterances earlier on, seems to have rubbed a lot of people the wrong way because they seem to think it was written to be delivered in earnest rather than a goofy cockeyed mockery, to me was pure comic gold.

The cast as well, was amazing, and being filled with people cast into really weird roles for them set the tone for the whole movie in a brilliant manner I thought.

I did however seem to deviate from the feel of the prequel which was much more serious, but then again, if we are viewing the movie as its own separate entity that doesn't really matter.

Yeah you'll probably understand whats going on far better if you read the prequel, and yeah it does seem like he was trying to cram 10 pounds of movie in an 8 pound bag, but all in all I think it was worth my money.

I'm glad I made the purchase.  Just remember going in, that this is a comedic film, and I think it will provide you with some good entertainment.  Taking it too seriously will undoubtedly change your perception.",1208649600,2,1266,4.320675105485232
3269526,2,B000YQK14K,"I rented this movie and couldn't make it all the way through...The tone seemed all over the place, the plot hard to follow. But I loved the sincerity of Boxer Santeros, Krysta Now and Ronald/Roland Tavener. I loved the crazy neo-marxists, the goofy violence. In the end, I went back and rewatched, and suddenly pieces fell into place. There really is so much here, so many small details that are amusing, thought-provoking, or both. There are also so many cameos (where the heck did the idea of casting Christopher Lambert come from?  Loved seeing him).  I was reminded of some of David Lynch's films. (Was Rebekah Del Rio singing the national anthem an homage to her similar scene in Mulholland Drive? A nice touch.)  But whereas Lynch often seems to have some singular focus/theme, this film is all over the place.

How do you really sum up in one sentence what this film is about?  It's a wake-up call that we're stupid and on a course for certain disaster if we don't do something about it. That's all well and fine, but there's so much here, criticized in so many directions, it's hard to know what to do about any of it. In the end, some people may shrug at the too-muchness of Southland Tales. For others, they may find a thought-provoking kernal or two and start to really wonder what they think. And if, Kelly gets you to think, then perhaps he's accomplished all he set out to do in the first place.",1208563200,7,1409,4.531496062992126
3269527,2,B000YQK14K,"This was a disjointed, senseless, waste of 2 hours.  I did have advance warning from reading reviews here, but I just didn't expect it would be this bad.

I can't really think of one thing I liked about the movie.  Maybe the Pixies and Moby?  The overall feel is like some weird combination of B-moviedom, soap opera and late night infomercials.  Combined with a little too much inhaling on the part of the script writer who thought he was being clever with his visual puns and creative with his ""plot"".

We have the oh-so-daring mockery of the Republicans.  Others have been there, done that.  When the Dixie Chicks did it, it was courageous, edgy and well-deserved.  Here it's just opportunistic and cliche.  The closest it came to being funny was the elephant scene, but it was all downhill from there.

We have the dystopian commercials and news overlays.  They were already there, in slightly more accomplished form, in Robocop.  The car commercial was more tasteless than interesting.  Sex sells - what an insight.

We have the nigh-incomprehensible plot.  Now, if you are the type of viewer who delights in stories that don't make sense, you'll love this.  It's like, so deep, man.  No way I'll submit myself to this tripe twice, because I really don't think it has much to say at all.  The politics have nothing to do with it, it's just baaaad.

I'm not a ""Normal"" person and I love it.
When the movie ended, I had this non-stop laugh that lasted about 2 minutes.  It was uncontrollable.
This movie is an ""omni-genre"" film.  A drama, comedy, musical, love story, murder mystery, kidnapping, amnesia, sci-fi and others.

I love movies that have an all-star cast - every person in the movie is famous.  I love movies with famous people where they are doing things that are the opposite of their public persona. (The Rock, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Mandy Moore, Justin Timberlake, Jon Lovitz, Stifler, Kevin Smith, Booger from Revenge of the Nerds, the girl from Upright Citizens Brigade and many others etc.)  It's like John Goodman's character in The Big Lebowski.

There is references to alternative energy in the film.

This movie has everything thrown into it.  And its just that - it's all thrown into it.  No order, totally freestyled movie.  If you want to see something different, this is it.

I mean cmon people .... aren't you tired of the same old movie all the time?  If you want a movie going experience where you have absolutely no idea what you are going to see next, this is the movie.

This is the perfect balance of being different without being completely ""what the heck did I just watch"" like you might have felt after seeing ""THE FOUNTAIN"" by Aronofsky.  I thought that movie sucked but I did like PI, and I could see how others liked Requiem.

So don't worry, this isn't THE FOUNTAIN, its more on The Big Lebowski or Pulp Fiction tip but the dialogue isn't as good.

Ideas rehashed from the excellent Donnie Darko, and put to no good use. An actionless part for an action star. A main character whose manner and actions remain unexplained. Constant shots of a room full of widescreen TVs which is both annoying and unhelpful. And an ending that fails to deliver any clear (much less satisfying) resolution.

3269530,4,B000YQK14K,"For his second film Richard Kelly addresses such controversial issues as homeland security, oil dependence and the urgent need for an alternative fuel, celebrity culture, Hollywood's impact on politics, and the invasiveness of the national media. He tells a lot more as well making the film a confusing, and jumbled mess. It certainly has it's detractors but I believe it is a flawed masterpiece.  The acting and the character names are laughable. What Kelly does get right are a perfect atmosphere of fear and dread. He accomplishes this through brilliant production design, a great soundtrack, and an eccentric supporting cast. The world has been plunged into World War 3 after Texas was nuked on the 4th of July. A desperate military reinstates the draft. Since soldiers are limited they are being called upon to serve multiple tours of duty. This leaves them horribly scarred and disillusioned. Many returning soldiers are eager to speak out and let the public know what's really happening.  Abilene (Justin Timberlake) is one such soldier. He serves as the film's narrator and informs us that a scientist (Wallace Shawn) has just invented Fluid Karma, an alternative fuel. Big business types aren't on board since they stand to lose tons of money if Fluid Karma catches on. It is Election time and the front runner for the Presidency is a man named Frost (Holmes Osborne). Along with his wife Nana Mae (Miranda Richardson) and daughter (Mandy Moore) he is thrown into the media spotlight when it's announced that his son in law Boxer Santaros (Dwayne Johnson) has gone missing. Boxer, an action film star, woke up with amnesia and no idea what he was doing in the middle of the desert. He is living with Krysta Now (Sarah Michelle Gellar) a porn star. The two are trying to sell a script they wrote entitled ""The Power"" about the end of the world. Boxer arranges to ride around with a cop for research on his role. Roland Taverner (Sean William Scott) is a cop on a secret mission. He has been recruited by a group of Marxists who operate out of the surf shops of California's boardwalk. They captured his twin brother Ronald and are holding him hostage until Roland completes his mission. The Marxists want to bring down the Frost family and alert the world to their corrupt ways. There is a lot to keep up with in the film's nearly three hour run time. New characters and plot points are constantly being introduced and it's difficult to remember who everyone is let alone their motivations. The eccentric and surprising supporting cast includes Bai Ling, Christopher Lambert, Beth Grant, Zelda Rubinstein, Curtis Armstrong, John Larroquette, Will Sasso, and SNL alums Cheri Oteri, Jon Lovitz, Amy Poehler, and Nora Dunn. An unrecognizable Kevin Smith even factors into things as a scientist confined to a wheelchair. The film's final act is the best part as it combines lavish spectacle, the apocalypse, and  lots of emotion. Up in the clouds the rich are enjoying themselves on a Zeppelin while down in the streets  riots rage as the world comes to an end. Johnson's performance is far too campy and ridiculous. His nervous thumb twitches are very annoying.  Scott handles his dual roles well, Gellar is quite funny as a  porn star with none too bright views on politics and the future. Mandy Moore turns in a strong adult performance. It's  both shocking and hysterical to hear her read off some of Krysta's credits to Boxer. Moore even dances with Gellar during the End of the World party aboard the Zeppelin. The scene, set to Moby, is both sexy and sad. People thought this film was a letdown since it wasn't like ""Donnie Darko"". I say it's going to eventually enjoy the same kind of cult status as that film. Kelly still has a lot of creative ideas and executes them well but ""Darko"" is certainly the better of the two. This film reminded me of ""Inland Empire"" based on it's length and overall weirdness. Some reviews have compared the film to David Lynch's ""Dune"" and ""Mulholland Drive"". Rebekah Del Rio, the Silencio nightclub singer from ""Drive, shows up here singing the National Anthem. The DVD features are limited. There is an animated scene between two fish discussing the end of the world. There is a half hour making of that attempts to clear up some questions but doesn't.

3269531,3,B000YQK14K,"Part dystopian tale of near future events and part trail-blazing satire, `Southland Tales' keeps it funny enough without losing its cool.  Going into the introduction, you don't think it's possible when Abilene, TX is attacked along with other Texas cities by nuclear bombs on the Fourth of July.

The fallout of this horror is that the draft has been reinstated with America officially at war with Iraq, Iran, Syria, and North Korea.  In the process of all this terror is an election campaign.  Bobby Frost is the Republican candidate for President who spends a good deal of time winning back California in the election for the first time in two decades.  (To give you a flavor of the writing, the Southern senator is often quoting Robert Frost's famous poems ""Stopping by the Woods on a Snowy Evening"" and ""The Road Not Taken,"" saying he has traveled the road less traveled by and ""that has made all the difference"".)

Under his command is Boxer Santeros (Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson), a man whose memory is erased by terrorist kidnappers during the nuclear nightmare but manages to get to Los Angeles from near the Nevada border.

If you think this country is divided now, it's nothing like in the movie.  Homeland Security has expanded into a complete surveillance system (""ID-it""--or nearly IDIOT)  that has everyone identified on the Internet.  L.A. is the heart and center of the domestic  front as Neo-Marxists stationed underground in beachfront town, Venice, try and infiltrate the intelligence agency.  On the ballot is Proposition 69, which Senator Frost vehemently opposes for allegedly compromising national security.  (It doesn't take much extrapolation to know that it would repeal an advanced version of the Patriot Act.)

Forgetting his true identity as well as his wife's (Mandy Moore), Boxer takes refuge with an occult astrologer Krista Now/Kapowski (Sarah Michelle Gellar) who is known for sweeping forecasts of the future as well as her advocacy for sexual freedom on a Malibu cable channel.  Completely vulnerable, Boxer also comes under the wing of UPU3 police officer, Roland Tavener (Seann William Scott), an extension of Homeland Security.  Both men have been cloned (into Jericho Cane and Ronald Tavener respectively and must come to terms with their alter egos).

The plot, all strings of it, involves finding Boxer Santeros, while fighting surveillance underground, and trying to be reconciled with one's alter ego and survive all the fighting.

You can understand that 'Southland Tales' has a lot to figure out.  At the same time, they keep the mood and pace light enough, so you know not watching a 'Children of Men' imitator.  Interestingly enough you don't have to keep track of everything; it's casual enough to be enjoyed.  (It's not quite a musical, either, although songs played along the way enhance the mood and message.)  The portrayal of feminist Marxist, Cindy Pinzucki, and her cohorts is so delightfully loopy that the movie often lost any of the initial tension it provided in the fallout scenes.  (No one could outdo Susan Sarandon and  Geena Davis in `Thelma and Louise,` but these girls are less serious and, if anything, more fun.)  This is deliberate, but I was impressed at how much this satire made me laugh.  Of course its inane and happy to be that way, but you may end up being as confused as Boxer Santeros, figuring out what's going on.  (And ""The Rock"" has proven himself a decent Arnold Schwartenegger successor by adding some disciplined screen presence to the scenes.)

My main objection to the film is not its many plot points (which for the first 2/3rd`s they juggle well), but its resolution.  Instead of continuing with a funny, satiric ending, they try to get serious again and end with mutations trying to catch up with their alter identities.  Trying to build suspense in the ending chase scenes, the film becomes a protracted affair that muddles its message and momentum in the process.  In a way the movie loses its own identity.  Once the movie figures out what it wants to be, it should stick to its guns, instead of shifting focus unnecessarily.",1207699200,15,4118,4.966423357664233

It's really good, i've come to the conclusion that i may enjoy this movie even more than Kelly's first work Donnie Darko.

3269534,1,B000YQK14K,"If I am not mistaken this was released to some theatres the last section of 2007, rolling over to 2008, maybe I am wrong, maybe I am right, it doesn't really matter as that is an altogether dog with different fleas. 2006 showed us that films, such as Running With Scissors, World Trade Center, Turistas, Failure to Launch, and The DaVinci Code can be saturated with epic talent, huge directors and best selling adapted novels, but even with those often saving graces, yuck is still yuck. In 2007, which was an EPIC year for film, finding disasters were hard to find, save Evening and Mr. Brooks. Here then we have probably the worst film of 2007, or pretty darn close.

A reviewer below somewhere in the depth of word salad, said this: ""Fans of the director's earlier work (Donnie Darko) will not be disappointed. This movie stands out as a film with edge that many viewers will not fully comprehend (myself included) but can certainly appreciate.""

Well friend, speak for yourself, as I was thoroughly disappointed. I was at the 24:50 mark in the film, and just rolled over in the corner of my L couch, and sank my head into the pillows. I heard the sound of cars in the distance, somewhere rolling along the suburbian freeway, and someone on a bike went by, hearing that all too familiar sound of a baseball card attached to the spoke by a wash hanger.

Well Kelly you really bit the big one on this mess. Woooo Hooo. 'Donnie Darko' is amongst my friends and I top 20 movies of all time; it is, and was a cult phenom and is a shining achievement of brilliant filmmaking. Southland Tales is not edgy, it is not dark, it is a farce of untimely wit and parody set amongst a really trying to hard to be futuristic screenplay with a cast of some of the lesser of Hollywood's talent. (Lovitz, Laraquette, S.W.Scott, enough said?) Hence, perhaps Kelly new from jumpstreet how satirical and ludicrous this was going to be. The Rock and Sarah Michelle Gellar are just two names you do not under any circumstances attach to a film, if you want to take it seriously, much less a Kelly mind trip.

The opening scene aside with the boy with the camcorder and the atom bomb dropping, the rest (and I did roll back over eventually) is pure, total excrement. Endless, rambling banter and sad, twisted,non-humorous endeavors make the next hour even more painful. Perhaps I can look forward to Hellboy 2, Saw 5, The Mummy 3, Harry Potter 6, The Smurfs Movie, X-Files 2, Madagascar 2, or Get Smart: The Movie, and ordinarly I wouldn't think about seeing any of that nonsense.

Some think that director Kelly is misunderstood.  I think that ""Southland Tales"" is a pretty straightforward movie, coherent and easy to follow.  It is simply a bad film.  I don't see difficult to imagine all kinds of possible scenarios for the end of the world, especially in the Bush age, but the hard thing to do is to apply the fine brush, the little touches that make those scenarios believable, a world in their own.  Kelly throws everything that pops in his mind, but is all post-modern pap, the kind of act that pertain to some artsy films from the 1980s (and badly done at that).  Change the music for a full blown Hollywood-type orchestra, reshoot some escenes, shoot some more, and you could have a respectable summer extravaganza, with the same script but differently filmed.  This is one of those strange cases where fifteen million dollars more (and somebody else to helm) could have done all the difference.  In fact, I would advise Kelly to join forces with Gattaca's Andrew Niccol and work only pitching ideas to other directors, because the basic ones they have are good, the problem is when they try to film them.",1207267200,2,1184,4.718446601941747

The very near future, Los Angeles California. The United States has gone to war with Iran, Syria and North Korea however the war has created a fuel crisis for the U.S. because those countries supply so much of the oil the U.S.consumes. A desperate scramble for an alternative fuel source is launched. It appears that the country is in the midst of a social an economic revolution.

Meanwhile Boxer Santoros (The Rock) an action movie star with ties to the Republican President who had recently gone missing resurfaces with amnesia and winds up in a relationship with Krysta Now (Sarah Michelle Gellar) a former porn star who is in the middle of attempting to revamp her career. Boxer is being kept under the radar by enemies of the administration.

The fuel crisis has been solved by a rogue scientist however it hasn't been determined whether or not his solution is environmentally sound. All the while Roland Taverner (Sean William Scott) a veteran from the war, searches for his twin brother while Private Pilot Abilene (Justin Timberlake) a veteran from the war who was injured by Roland Taverner, narrates the whole story including versus from the bible.......

In case my synopsis isn't a good enough indicator I will just give it to you on the nose. This movie is a 2  hour train wreck. After finishing the movie, I still don't really know what this ""Lobotomy by film"" is about or what the point was. I am really just speechless but in a bad way.

The Good: I am glad that The Rock, Sarah Michelle Gellar and Sean William Scott are working but it is unfortunate that they are working on this.

The Bad: There is no recognizable plot, story, moral or point that I could see. Even though the movie is lacking in that department it still manages to ramble on for almost 2 1/2 hours, with an ending that left me shaking my head.

I really like Dwayne Johnson but I think this part was a little too big for the still green actor as he seemed to falter here and there in the movie as did Sean William Scott.

I could go on an on about how bad this movie is but will just leave it at, no story and questionable acting intertwined to make a never ending movie that is absolutely terrible.

Overall: Avoid this at all cost. There wasn't a single redeeming feature that I can think of. This is probably one of the top 10 worst movies I have ever seen.",1207180800,7,2661,4.919642857142857

I saw a lot of potential from this movie, its graphic novel style, and the cast (would somebody please give Curtis Armstrong his own movie?), but neither all the special effects in the world, nor MTV imagery could save this nightmare from choking on its own excesses.

3269540,3,B000YQK14K,"I agree with everyone that has called the Southland Tales a mess. Still, I can't say I hated it. I like films that are different and out there and Southland Tales is certainly different and out there. It's like Repo Man, Strange Days and a Terry Gilliam film all in one. The performances can be pretty bad but...that's what I found fun about it.

  I mean, it's fun seeing these actors experiment with roles they haven't played before and fail. I admit that Seann William Scott, Justin Timberlake and even Christopher Lambert really aren't that bad though. I don't think Lambert does that bad of a job playing a sleazy guy who sells guns in an Ice Cream Truck. It's different from the kind of role he usually plays. While John Lovitz is decent as a badass crooked cop, it's still hard not to laugh at him because we're not used to seeing him like that.

  As for the Rock, I do like him and wish the best for his career but he's awful yet entertaining at the same time here. I mean when ever he's nervous in the movie he rubs his hands together and makes a funny face. It is a litte funny seeing him act like that but at the same time it comes as the kind of a performance that a high school kid would give acting for the first time in a movie his friend is making. Still, it's an enterttaining bad performance. Sarah Michelle Gallar also gives an entertaining bad performance as a bimbo pornstar who wants to get into reality tv. I'm used to her giving an entertaining bad performance though since she gives one in every movie she's in lol.

  Southlamd Tales I don't even think is trying to be a good movie. It can careless if critics like it. I think they were trying to just make a potential cult classic like Repo Man. In that way it succeeds. I mean, if you cast Sarah Michelle Gellar you should know that you're making an instant B-Movie.

The rapid-fire pop culture and historical references are anchored very well by a strong cast led by Dwayne Johnson, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Seann William Scott and Wallace Shawn. As in his breakthrough film, cult smash ""Donnie Darko"", writer/director Richard Kelly avails himself of a mesmerizing and idiosyncratic aesthetic. In some ways, it is even an improvement over that fine film, but it is much more abstruse, at least upon initial viewing.
It is an intrigue/science fiction/black comedy based on the Book of Revelation, quantum theory, the War on Terror and a postmodern critique of modern media. The movie seems to inspire diametrically opposite reviews, perhaps due to the demands that this opus places on its audience. The movie itself spouts narrative like a rambling doomsday prophet (literally, although Justin Timberlake plays one of the younger, more likeable oracles in movie history). Initially, it seems to be telling a long and crazy story apropos of nothing but requiring lots of suspension of disbelief. But astute observers are rewarded with a bizarre but cogent alternate universe rich in detail, humor and fantastic omens. In this reviewer's opinion, the intertwining of the plot threads at the conclusion was very rewarding in a dreamlike and abstracted sort of way. And the soundtrack, as one comes to expect from Kelly, is amazing.
None of this is to say that the film doesn't have problems. The dialogue is clumsy in spots, and the Special Features are somewhat lacking (obviously saved for some special edition somewhere down the road).

3269546,2,B000YQK14K,"I have been following the progress of this film for about three years or so, reading about the constant re-writing of the screenplay, the re-shooting, the re-editing -- completely shifting plots and sub-plots around -- and I knew that this could only mean one thing....the movie was destined to be an obscure disaster.

Of course, that is exactly what it is.  I was surprised to find, after having finally forgotten about the making of Southland Tales last fall, to come across, a few weeks ago here on this site, a DVD release date for it.  Was this even in theatres or was it straight to video?  I keep up with all the newly released films in both the giant multi-plexes and the small indie theatres and never saw this title despite living in (now near) a large city.

It is fairly obvious what happened with the creation of Southland Tales...it goes like this:  Richard Kelly's movie 'Donnie Darko' achieved cult status and even moved past that to become a relatively mainstream hit even to the point of being re-released years later in Imax theatres.  That is pretty rare.  Richard Kelly was the It-Director of the mid-2000's.  Sony, hoping to capitalize on his status, signed him and basically gave him carte blanche.  Bad move for most any director, but certainly for such an inexperienced one as Kelly.

Kelly, overwhelmed by his own imagination, tried to capture everything in there on film (or otherwise create it digitally), but all these ideas he had got all mixed up in his brain and the hours and hours of images did not match what he had in hs head and so he shot more and more of them and switched the screenplay around and tried to put these pieces of this maddening puzzle that his mind had created together in movie format.  The problem was -- the pieces he had were mixed up with pieces of other puzzles.  He tried jamming them together in a desperate effort to make them fit, but nothing would work.  Finally the studio gave up on him and for all intents and purposes shut down production, thereby cutting their losses.

Southland Tales tries to be cool and current, but it is slow-moving and not even remotely witty.  It tries to put as many familiar faces as possible on the screen, but ends up with a bunch of C and D list celebrities and has-beens along with an action movie 'star', but no action.  A movie with a lay-out like an intense war-themed video game, but no intensity portrayed anywhere by anyone.

The above reminds me slightly of David Lynch's 'Inland Empire', where Lynch basically shot a movie (or much of it) as the ideas came into his head and then put it together as he went along and then through the editing process.  The major difference is this:  David Lynch is both experienced and supremely talented.  Kelly, well, he kinda isn't.

Sony made a very bad judgment trying to, basically, cash in on the success of 'Darko' and the 'fan-boys' and got reamed for it.  Too bad for them.  But even worse for Kelly, because I find it difficult to believe that he will be trusted like he was trusted by Sony ever again.  This was a film-maker's dream, but Kelly totally blew it.

Southland Tales is a poorly crafted movie that is essentially pointless and ultimately boring.

3269550,5,B000YQK14K,"The extreme reactions provoked by this movie are far more astonishing, confusing and inexplicable than ""Southland Tales"", which actually is a lot of fun.
Of course, after finally getting a chance to watch the movie on DVD, one thing is for sure, if there ever was a movie not suited for a premiere in the official competition in Cannes, this is it.
""Southland Tales"" is more a futuristic adventure-thriller strongly rooted in its comic book origins, than a confusing, pretentious, apocalyptic allegory, which has been made to be in most quarters. And yet, whereas more than a decade ago, the intelligentsia was ready to accept Quentin Tarantino fusion of trash and art, asking them to absorb at this point a ""joyride"" like ""Southland Tales"" might be too much.
""Joyride"" is the key to the whole endeavor. Despite skewering both left and right, uncovering ominous political plots, and the threat of world anihilation, the movie retains a light touch, mixed with some delightfully bizarre moments such as a Justin Timberlake musical number,  a rendition of the United States anthem by Rebekah del Rio, and a final dance number with The Rock, Sarah Michelle Gellar and Mandy Moore.
One of the most damning, and false charges, made against the movie is that the plot is confusing and hard to follow. Well, probably for someone who has never seen the likes of ""Lost"", ""Prison Break"", ""Battlestar Galactica"", or the ""X Men"" series, to name just a few. Of course, if you are an old, stodgy critic, whose idea of a plot is an Abbas Kiarostami movie, yes, you might find the story hard to follow.
It actually concerns an end of the world plot in which a movie star (The Rock) engaged to a vice presidential nominee's daughter (Mandy Moore), is kidnapped by a Neo Marxist group. He gets involved with a smart, entrepreneurial porn star (Sarah Michelle Gellar) looking to advance her career. There is a fierce political ellectoral race going on, and a draconian security state has been established after a nuclear attack in Abilene Texas. Sean William Scott plays identical twins who hold a key to the mystery of the possilbe end of the world, and Justin Timberlake is a somewhat melancholic narrator, a disfigured ex Iraqui soldier.
The all star cast is game, with solid turns by The Rock, Gellar and Scott. Mandy Moore is especially good, and Timberlake is a welcome presence. The supporting cast is amazing and fun, including comedians such as John Larrocquete and Jon Lovitz, cult figures such as Zelda Rubinstein (from Poltergeist fame) and Wallace Shawn (My Dinner with Andre), as well as the extraordinary, Oscar nominated, Miranda Richardson, in a bitchy big sister kind of role.
""Southland Tales"" has some amazing imagery, especially near the end.

In my opinion, it is much better then Donnie Darko. Its not your average movie which makes it great! For me it was a whole new experience. I watch on average 20-30 movies a month. There is nothing like this one!

The first time you watch it, you'll be asking, ""what is the point, how does it all make sense""? Thats one of the best parts, you cant figure it out the first time.

I watched it twice and then watched the special features. The special features explain ALOT, do yourself a favor and only watch those after you have seen the film.

I hate reading long drawn out reviews on here, but this movie requires it.

Here is the story (my opinion):

The United States is at war with several countries. Oil is becoming hard to get, a German company invents ""fluid karma"", a fuel alternative that runs off ocean power.

By using the oceans power, it throws off the balance of earth and creates a rift in the Nevada desert (a 4th dimenson).

Scientists send Boxer Santaros (the Rock) and Ronald Taverner (Stiffler) through the rift. This 4th dimenson creates a time/space problem and now the future and past versions of Boxer and Ronald co-exist. When Boxer returns from the desert, he writes a script. The movie is the script being played out. The past version of Boxer is killed, but Ronald's past and present self co-exist on earth.

The movie asks the question, ""what would happen if two souls that are one shake hands""? At the end of the movie, Roland Taverner shakes hands with his other self and ends the world with an ""apocalyptic handshake"".

Much, much more happens in between. The characters are great, the story is funny and intriguing and the dialogue and one liners are unforgettable.

3269553,4,B000YQK14K,"Wow...there is a lot going on in Southland Tales. And, unfortunately for the folks who expect plots and themes to be spoon-fed to them, this is a convoluted and sometimes messy movie. You're going to have to think for yourself with this one.

I'm sure many people said, ""Well I loved Donnie Darko, so I should love this, too."" And, there are many similarities to Donnie Darko, as ST delves into a bit of time travel theory and there's even a bullet to the eye (no creepy rabbit costumes this time around, though). But this is far more ambitious and epic than Donnie Darko in its scope.

Richard Kelly attempts to envision the end of the world, which happens ""not with a whimper, but a bang"" in this, and tells a story of the apocalypse using an omniscient, disaffected Iraq war veteran, a police officer searching for his ""brother,"" an amnesiac action movie star, and a porn actress searching for legitimacy. Through it all is an underlying theme of political corruption, subversive activism, and the government's attempt to monitor it all.

The casting choices made were a bit hard to swallow; at times you think you're watching a 1990s SNL cast member reunion. And I've never been a fan of ""The Rock."" And, seriously, Stiffler from American Pie? Buffy?

But, the story, as messy and hard to follow and pretentious and overreaching as it is at times, kept me interested and intrigued. This isn't exactly an easy feat to achieve in this decade of crappy TV shows made into even crappier movies, sequel after sequel, vile romantic comedies, and remade/rehashed movies.

I'm sure people are frustrated by Southland Tales, and it's easy to write it off as a piece of pretentious garbage. But, sometimes a movie is just a vision--not always coherent and easy to follow. As a fan of David Lynch's work, I had to accept a long time ago that often, there are things that just won't make sense.

I watched this movie Friday evening; it's now Sunday afternoon, and I haven't been able to get it out of my head. Like Donnie Darko, I want to watch it again. And then, maybe again. That's all I can ask for from a movie: don't let me forget you--make me want to watch you more than once.

This review, like the movie, is also convoluted, I'm sure. But, the gist of it is: I love it for its originality, for its scope, for its lack of convention. And I applaud Richard Kelly for not putting out Donnie Darko 2. I am happy to know that there are still folks making movies that might be a bit challenging.

If nothing else, watching Justin Timberlake swill beer and sing along with ""All These Things That I Have Done"" was great.

And, for everyone else, just sit back and wait for the next big Michael Bay/Jerry Bruckheimer CGI cliche. They'll insult you by selling you explosions and ridiculous special effects as entertainment, pocketing your money, and laughing all the way to the bank...",1206230400,4,2876,4.612524461839531
3269554,4,B000YQK14K,"Look, first off this movie is not for everyone and trust me there a lot of holes, so much so that it's impossible not to fall in one yourself, but I have to give this movie its props. In the post modern era we currently live in where everything seems to be homogenized to a sickening point, this movie was a welcome sore to the system. Again, if you're looking for straight up coherency you will not find it here, but I guarantee that you will fall out of your seat laughing at some of the shennanigans that take place. After watching this I will never call 'The Rock...The Rock.' Forever he will be known as Duane Johnson: actor! Not because he gives a dramatic tour de force of a performance, far from it, but because he manages to deliver inane dialogue so convincingly that you will literally fall on your stomach laughing till your guts spill out. He is that good in this which to me was shocking because I don't like the man's movies in the least bit. Everyone here does a damn good job, including Timberlake. But what made the movie resonate with me was that there's a large degree of truth to the hilarity that ensues. What would America look like if there was an Apocalyptic tragedy to occur in this current era we live in? Every movie that mentions Iraq in some context just seems trite in hindsight, and in this it's one of the main plot points, but I wasn't insulted by it in any way. Why? Again it comes down to truth. If you're aware of our current cultural landscape as it exists today then you will definitely get something out of this movie. I have a funny feeling Southland will have a rabid cult following and may very well be the preeminent midnight movie of the 21st century. Again, not for everyone, but if you're like me who likes a little strange once in awhile, then you'll be alright.",1206230400,5,1810,4.373887240356083

This is one of those really out there kinds of movies that you just really have to sit & devote your full attention to.  I think with a 2nd viewing I'd probably enjoy it alot more, I just don't know that I'd ever watch it again.  It seems to me as though there was alot more going on in the movie that just didn't need to be.  There were countless characters that in the end really didn't need to be included in the telling of the main plot.  It had a very Paul Verhoeven/Robocop political satire to it, & at the same time very David Lynch/WTF feel to it.  One thing I'll applaud it for is it's ensemble cast.  Most everybody included were put into roles you've probably never seen them in & it was great, they all did a spot on performance.  In the end I think what you have here is a director who got a big head after his ""Darko"" flick became a cult hit & wound up trying to do something clever.  Did it turn out that way ...I don't really know; I kinda don't think so.  I think most people probably don't/won't get it (even most of the actors involved didn't really understand it after watching the special features).  This is one of those films for the folks that like to watch weird & eclectic films just to be different, & in the end I'd almost bet you that they don't really get it either.

There is so much of a LYNCH vibe here that it overwhelms the rather ingenious nooks and crannies of the script and the ideas from the comics that introduce the story.  This is a very compelling experiment one that works best if you take the intial placebo of the 3 prequel graphic novels, their content is mildly fleshed out at the begininng of the film and throughout but for the uninitiated the story won't make sense otherwise, so Kelly has essentially painted he and his audience into a filmic corner.  The ideas are abundant, the cameos as numerous as they are curious and the musical numbers possibly too few.  Kelly is making films that are to be experienced and rewatched, the performances, background sound and art direction feel lifted from other films but the overall effect is powerful as the director throws off your propreoception one degree at a time.  I think alot of us are used to that CG tint/sheen that dominates scifi/futuristic films that is absent here and is often eschewed for bright drab uncinematic type shots, and with its heady mix of MULHOLLAND Dr. meets WILD PALMS it can be a strange pill to swallow. The effects are lingering and powerful as the concepts that Kelly has come up with are strong and much of this film is an original amalgamation if nothing else. so take the plunge if you dare but one thing I wouldn't define this as is entertainment.  The image transfer is quite good considering the films length, but I feel like all the studio wanted to do is tack trailers onto the disc instead of essential bonus material.
I would like to see a blu-ray version with the comics included as extras that can be read first, as the featurette and included animated short while welcome don't offer the viewer much help with the essential prequel setup story.",1205971200,2,1959,4.631123919308357
3269558,1,B000YQK14K,"In the words of Jay Sherman ""It STINKS"" I saw this in theaters and it was hilarious when it was trying to be serious. THe sad thing is i get the whole convoluted plot and it boils down to this. Stifler(Sean Patrick Scott) is the Real savior of the human race because he hasn't had a bowl movement in 6 days. The who goal of the Devil (Played by the guy that says inconceivable in the princess pride) is to cause armagedon by manipulating the republican and democratic party.

The devil causes this by slowing down the earth at a rate of .000000000000009 degrees which Jericho Kane/the rock/fake savior  (A False idol= a celebrity... get it) is right about when he wrote out this movie script of his. THis has messed with the way the universes waves go over the human race also a power source called liquid karma along with drugs is also used to try to destroy the human race. Except these end up making soldier able to have telepathic communications with each other. Why the devil even bothered not testing for these kind of things is beyond stupid.

Id write out more but that's mabye half of the summery for this murkey film. People who rate it 5 stars won't really know what it's about. Not everything that is confusing is good. Sometimes a person is just such an egomaniac that they can do whatever the hell they want and some people will eat it up.

This film is far to muddled and lacks any real depth, what exists in its place is an ego bigger then the megazeplin which i am firing a missle at right now. BURN southland tales cause your a PIMP and PIMPS don't commit suicide.

3269561,1,B000YQK14K,"Some say words cant even summarize this movie. They are right because the movie is hardly worth the words I'm about to waste my time typing to tell you how cruddy of a film this was.

Plot: Very hodge-podged and it didn't have any flow or theme like Donnie Darko. The only things scenes seem to have in common other then the actors/actresses is the usage of the ""f"" word. Don't get me wrong swearing has its place in quite a few films but the swearing was just tossed in and didn't seem to have any reason for the use other then making an 'R' rating.

Nuclear war breaks out in Texas.....the big issue with that is the attack isn't ever explained in any form of detail and the US in return unleashes on multiple countries at once starting WW3 who apparently is sponsored by Bud and Hustler...

What would have been the 'twists and turns' in this movie are as readable as the hustler advertisements on the sides of a tank or the BUDLIGHT stamped all over walls. You can figure them out without much thought. THIS DOES NOT mean the movie has structure. They introduce the idea of rift in time and a current person and their copy from the future not once but twice. You can figure it out after the first person unless your five or just had your eyes closed and ears covered during the film.

Cast: The cast is amazing and after seeing some of the names attached to this title I can't help but think how much they had to have been paid to even have their names attached to this or how drunk they must have been in order to sign a contract for this movie. A few names other then Sean William Scott and Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson. Christopher freaking Lambert (the original highlander actor) Kevin Smith (if I have to explain stop reading) Mandy Moore, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Justin Timberlake.

Summary/Final Thoughts: Very Very disappointed by this film and the fact that most of the actors listed would even agree to this script. Save your money and get the Donnie Darko Director Cut or the Regular version and a copy of the soundtrack.",1205798400,4,2032,4.436997319034853

Kelly appears to have observed such things and though the movie can be confused with a well-constructed brain fart, i believe it takes minor logical thinking to see it for what it is. Kelly is a fresh voice and if it wasn't for the killers' song in the middle of the film, I would have given it five stars. i recommend it, as kelly has a sad beauty to all his films.",1205798400,3,958,4.3277777777777775
3269563,4,B000YQK14K,"Set in the (then futuristic) year of 2008, ""Southland Tales"" gives a frighteningly real feel for ""what if..."".  It revolves around a famous actor who vanished for three days and resurfaced as an amnesiac.  Along the way, we're introduced to the porn star that's trying to expand to other genres (pop music, energy drinks, etc.), a cop that has returned from the war in Iraq, and the actor's wife (who happens to be the daughter of a man running for president).

Make no mistake, this movie DOES get confusing more than once.  You WILL find yourself scratching your head and saying, ""what the...?""  But, if you can keep up with the confusion, I think you will find that you actually enjoy this movie.

3269564,1,B000YQK14K,"Richard Kelly's long-awaited follow-up to 2001's Donnie Darko arrives on a wave of bad press after its 2006 screening at Cannes, and alas, reports were not exaggerated. Southland Tales is painfully sophomoric and entirely devoid of the wit, intelligence and pathos that made Donnie Darko such a unique experience. Aspiring to be a sci-fi epic, the film was shot on a tiny budget in only thirty days, and the film looks (and sounds) like an ""avant-garde"" American TV show, with performances (a bland cast lead by Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson and Sarah Michelle Geller) on about the same level. Everything about Southland Tales is horribly botched; it even manages to make Miranda Richardson look like a bad actress, a major feat in itself.

Whatever Kelly's vision was, it was hopelessly scrambled on the way to the screen. What's left is an undisciplined mishmash of ill-conceived, poorly executed scenes going nowhere and a lot of slapstick violence and smug, ""surrealist"" jokes reminiscent of David Lynch on a bad day. Kelly is insanely ambitious and he throws just about everything into the mix--Biblical prophecies, teenage porn, corporate conspiracies, rigged elections, time travel, world war three--everything except believable characters, engaging dialogue, or a plot that makes any sense. When Kelly's not aping Lynch he's coat-tailing Kubrick (he makes his inspirations plain with the soundtrack, probably the most enjoyable thing in the film), but he has sacrificed his own sensibility on the altar of his movie idols. In the process of realizing his grandiose satiric-apocalyptic vision of ""Life on Earth,"" he short-circuited his talent. Without narrative framework or coherent vision, Southland Tales is all sound and fury, signifying nothing.",1204588800,11,1753,5.374545454545455

And by ""different,"" I mean ""one of the only films I've ever seen that really made me question the old maxim 'there's nothing new under the sun'.""

One one hand, it's an arthouse flick, through and through; on the other, it stars the Rock, Sarah Michelle Gellar, and a whole roster of cloying teen idols; on yet another hand (I'm assuming you have four), the near-impenetrability of the plot (which would perhaps be made clearer had the viewer read ""prequel"" graphic novel) is most definitely up to the standards of your most pretentious art snob, but on the final hand, much of the film's ""impenetrability"" lay in fairly obscure pop culture references which are tossed about as if they're scripture.

I read one review that called Kelly ""too angry"" to make a good film; certainly, this is one of the more blatant anti-Bush films to come out since his first inauguration, but this is a bit like calling Greg Arakki's ""Nowhere"" a ""queer"" film; like that postmodern masterpiece's relationship with its unfortunate label, the thinly veiled anti-Bushisms at play are little more than a convenient backdrop for what is no less than a very unique filmmaker's very unique vision.

3269567,1,B000YQK14K,"Polarizing indeed, but then again maybe it was over my head.  Whenever people hail a film for being ""strange"" and ""weird"", but yet ""brilliant!"" in the same sentence you have to wonder if they really know what they watched.  With all due respect, my opinion is that I watched a long, plot-less, aimless, and bloated wannabe dystopian social commentary.  I am calling Richard Kelley's bluff here and respectfully asserting that Southland Tales is a turkey with a capital T.  Kelly brought us the perplexing but appealing cult hit&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Donnie-Darko/dp/B0006GAOBI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Donnie Darko</a>&nbsp;and you'd think that Kelly either threw caution to the wind or was just that confident that the oodles of fans who flocked to read far into Darko's story would bite into Southland Tales hook, line, and sinker.  Which of course for the most part they did.  But there is no real direction here, the dialogue is absolutely terrible, and even the cinematography is well below par.

The film stars Dwayne ""the Rock"" Johnson, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Sean William Scott (who plays twins), Miranda Richardson, Kristen Stewart, Justin Timberlake, Mandy Moore, and Jon Lovitz.  Kevin Smith also appears and I think I remember him giving P.T. Anderson a hard time about creating ostentatious nonsense like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Magnolia/dp/B000PAAJYW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Magnolia</a>&nbsp;but yet here he is appearing in something far more guilty of such repute.  This cast, albeit not a multitude of critical darlings, should've known better and maybe they do.  Even ex-wrassler ""the Rock"" must have had some doubt as to the legitimacy of Kelly's vision.

I'm going to try not to stray from providing some kind of plot overview here but I may struggle.  Texas suffers two nuclear attacks and the country is propelled to war.  Our civil liberties continue to suffer mightily.  Some technology is introduced to answer the imminent peak oil crisis that involves using ocean currents.  It eventually leads to enough chaos that it effects the space time continuum, I think.  Meanwhile, the primary three characters in Los Angeles are brought into the picture.  The film sputters into chaos just as I began not to care and for that I guess it kept me watching, but for all the wrong reasons.

Anyway, I want to find something nice to say about Kelly and his film but it is really difficult.  Donnie Darko is a very good movie and there are little flashes of that talent here but Southland Tales is so convoluted that it really can't be redeemed at all.  Perhaps Kelly's intentions were there and I hope he returns with something equaling the standard of Darko, but there are so few signs of that in Southland Tales.  Donnie Darko had appeal beyond reading into Kelly's complexities but this movie does not.  Some advocates for the film suggest it is a commentary on the globalized military and the media/entertainment industry's interaction with society.  Perhaps it is for them and for Kelly.  I suppose that's fine but it certainly didn't touch on those things effectively or realistically for me.  I would definitely say that Kelly bit off way more than he could chew if he intended to make this film some all-encompassing social commentary. Perhaps a longer version was justified or perhaps it should've been several films, I'm not sure.  At the very least, this makes me curious what he does next.  I sincerely hope it's very different.",1203033600,45,3563,5.32737030411449
3269568,4,B000YQK14K,"Enjoyable. Wild. Insane. Ridiculous. Stupid. Insightful. Too long. Too short. Funny. Cringe worthy. Pointless. Dumb. Inspiring. Eye candy. Fun.

That's what I would say if the average person asked me what I thought of it.

But if you're like me and you like : The Pixies, Jane's Addiction, Philip K. Dick, 90's Saturday Night Live, comic books, video games, Revelation and any other apocalypse theories, conspiracy theories like ""Behold the Pale White Horse"" or getting a kick out of ""The Anarchist Cookbook"", the creepy old psychic from Poltergeist, Viola from Moonlighting or Bugger from Revenge of the Nerds, porn, the internet or anything involving paranoia (both drug induced and not) then this film is for you.

In other words I enjoyed the film for what it is (a visual trip with many ideas) and what it's not (self indulgent and pretentious). Several established critics (they were probably booing this film at Cannes as well) called it self indulgent and a complete mess. I gather that when a critic doesn't comprehend what's going on they're quick to label the film self indulgent (they said the same thing about ""The Fountain""). They might do this out of fear of admitting that they didn't have the foresight to see that a whole new genre (sort of, I mean you have to give credit to the Avant-Garde) of film is emerging albeit with an American face. This isn't to say that they're completely wrong, I mean the film is a mess but it's an enjoyable mess of moments. I don't think Richard Kelly is interested in typical Hollywood story structure, that is, linear plot with plot conventions, I think it's more about encapsulating different emotions and ideas and stringing them together for a different experience. Conventions allow the audience to walk in to a theater with certain expectations and walk away with an understanding of whether or not those expectations were met. Southland Tales is not about expectations and if you require a strict use of genre conventions then this film is not for you.

From then on out everything made complete sense to me.  Every single twist the movie took resonated with that theme.  Everything that came before it made sense, too.  Once I knew what lens to be viewing the movie through, it worked perfectly for me.

My girlfriend, who I saw the movie with, did not have that same moment.  There's absolutely nothing wrong with that.  Some people are going to see a clear theme and some won't.  There could be people convinced that the theme is something else entirely and the film works for them in a different way.  There's no getting around it; it's a hard film to digest.

It's a perfect reflection of our weird society's increasing environmental paranoia and information overload; a metaphor for the barrage of endless, multi-stream data and constant doomsday declarations that we endure daily but can barely begin to solve or fully understand. The movie also embraces humor, irony and unexpected human connections that bind us in the shared experience. The individual pieces do not always add up, but taken as a whole, it's an incredibly ambitious and entertaining movie, for those of us who are into that sort of thing. I can see why people thinks it's either horrible or brilliant, because in some ways it's both. But, to appreciate Southland Tales, you have to give Richard Kelly credit for his ambition rather than wishing he'd made a simpler, more linear move. Like David Lynch, that is not his style, and both of these directors make movies (and tackle issues and themes) that, even after repeated viewings, you feel you're only beginning to grasp in their entirety.",1200614400,3,1169,4.8793969849246235

I won't attempt to explain the plot to you, just read the tag ""This is the Way the World Ends"", nuff said.  There are so many intricate plot threads, obtuse characters, and out there scenarios that it takes a good 2-3 viewings to comprehend what you are seeing.  Imagine watching every cable news channel at once and you start to get the idea.  If you do become a fan of this film, I would highly recommend the graphic novel tie-in, which is actually the first 3 chapters of the movie (Kelly took a cue from George Lucas and began in the middle of the story).  It makes the setup much easier to understand, and contains elements that would have been much too expensive to film with the budget they had.

I have constantly been to IMDB, Wikipedia, and so forth to check on the release status of this film. Finally, when a trailer was released, I was excited. The trailer was amazingly done, even if it didn't give us a clue as to what the film was about. The only thing is this: the trailer may have been better than the actual film itself.

There is nothing wrong with the actual storyline or plot(s) here. That's all fine and dandy with me. It was very complex, and I love complex. Anything that promises to rape my brain for two hours is welcome company to me. For me, the big problems were the script and the casting. There were several moments where the dialogue just seemed forced, as though I had Richard Kelly nudging me with his elbow saying, ""This is funny! You're supposed to laugh here!"" But with lines like ""I'm a pimp, and pimps don't commit suicide"", how are we NOT expected to roll our eyes in disgust? There's a scene where this very strange lady holds a gun to Dwayne Johnson's head, and begs him to let her give him oral sex. This was awkward, and felt totally out of place within the film. Another problem was with the casting. Many of these people are not professional actors, and it is painfully obvious at many times during the film. Dwayne Johnson twitches and over emphasizes his lines to the point where his character just isn't believable during many moments. Sarah Michelle Gellar and Sean William Scott deliver the strongest performances here, and Justin Timberlake is appropriatly creepy as a drugged out, Bible verse spouting soldier.

Don't get me wrong. There is much to like here. It is not a waste of time by any means, and it is not the disaster that some critics would have you believe. It is a flawed film - a mess of a film with great intentions. I would not for one second disuade anyone from seeing it, and I will probably buy the DVD when it is available. I'm just saying that I expected a bit more in the acting and screenwriting department, especially after Kelly's EXCELLENT debut, and all time fave of mine, ""Donnie Darko"".

SEE IT.

**Update**

Bought the DVD, saw it again, and liked it much more this time. This is a film that requires second, third, fourth, and fifth viewings. The second time around wasn't as confusing and the comedic elements weren't as awkward. It's still a mess, but a better one.",1197417600,4,2478,4.4855875831485585
3269574,4,B000YQK14K,"Set in a futuristic-looking Los Angeles in 2008 as it stands on the brink of apocalyptic disaster, Southland Tales centres on Boxer Santaros (Johnston) an action star with a bout of amnesia, whose life intertwines with Krysta Now (Gellar), a determined porn star developing her own reality television project. We also meet Ronald Taverner (Scott), a police officer who may hold the key to an immeasurable conspiracy involving a militant rebel organisation, the American government, and the end of the world. These guys are the nucleus of an infinitely perplexing plot that involves an abundance of quirky characters and bizarre goings-on. Directed by Richard Kelly, who made a stunning debut six years ago with Donnie Darko, Southland was delayed after an unfinished cut screened during the Cannes Film Festival and was widely abused by the amassed critics, who quite simply did not know what to make of it. Kelly has crafted a staggeringly ambitious piece of work that exudes an intelligence and ability far beyond my feeble brain. But, as a film designed to entertain and stimulate, it falls considerably short of not just his debut, but of a much-needed narrative lucidity that engages us as an audience. The problems here are vast and frustrating, but even when scratching your head in confusion, or frowning at another seemingly redundant character, you can almost feel the profusion of ideas dying to rear their heads long enough for you to grasp them. Kelly has raw talent like no other director of his generation, that much is plainly clear; but he needs to evolve into a director with a sense of control and focus, as large parts of this bang of over-indulgence. I have no doubt that Kelly will make other great films - but Southland Tales is never anything more than a beautiful mess-a beautiful mess I enjoyed.",1197158400,4,1821,4.954248366013072
3269575,5,B000YQK14K,"I saw this in theaters last week.  I thought it was really cool but obviously did not understand a lot of the plot.  After spending some time on the internet, I found out that there are 3 prequel graphic novels that must be read for this movie to make sense.  The graphic novels are awesome.  When combined with the actual movie, the movie itself is a very original concept.  The story is broken down into 6 chapters.  The movie is chapters 4, 5, and 6 and the graphic novels are the first three.  Combined they make a somewhat coherent story with a bit of everything from religious prophecies, a revolution in America, satire on our way of life, space/time continuum and of course, the end of the world.  It is definitely worth seeing and if you do enjoy comics, please read the prequel stories.",1196121600,9,796,4.479166666666667
3269576,5,B000YQK14K,"This movie cannot be summarized or explained easily so I will provide my impressions of this strangely fascinating movie.  First off, it's a long movie (over 2 hours) and the first 15 mins. confused me until I just let go of any normal movie expectations and sat back to enjoy the freak show that is Southland Tales.  There is no way this film is going to appeal to the masses and if odd movies appeal to you, then you better run out to see it at the handful of theaters playing it or wait for the dvd release.  I know I can't wait for the dvd release (please let there be commentary) for repeated viewings.  This movie was so crammed full of insight, digs and jokes that I couldn't catch every single thing.  This mind blowing version of what the USA might be like in the very near future is crazy but addictive.  I found the scene where someone questions after a commercial, ""Did I just see two cars f**k?""  ""Yes, but that was the European version"" to be very telling.  The smarmy salesman easily tosses aside any moral questions.  Are Americans being sold swamp land by Corporations?  Some might even question if the viewer is being sold a load of crap dressed up as fine art.  I think not.  The aggressive subtext was a nice touch too.  Be prepared for very crude dialogue - I found it amusing but it might not appeal to others.  The against-type casting was a stroke of brilliance (Sarah Michele ""Buffy"" Gellar as a porn star and Mandy Moore as a I can't say without giving things away).  Obscure references were a treat such as the Baron's ""Dune"" overtones and Kevin Smith (not easily recognizable) evokes the Wizard of Oz.  I loved the light handed social commentary.  This film never came off as preachy but made it's point of view on serious issues nonetheless (it's not for the war in Iraq for starters): they used a heavy technology vibe to get some points across (there are many scenes with several computer screens on view with running commentary underneath each screen); the national anthem was being sung in Spanish to start and then continued in English; the energy crisis resolution was pure sci-fi; and the Revelations from the Bible, as read by Timberlake, were played out by the characters (Revelation that apocalypse will be brought on by a pregnant woman (Moore) surrounded by a dragon (tattoo on Mei Ling's back) and two beasts (you get the point).  A lot of attention was given to the minute detail of this movie and that dedication showed.  The ""Vast Right Wing Conspiracy"" subplot was amusing and only one example of what this movie was all about to me - a joke, and it invited us all to enjoy it with them.  At IDent, all the employees wore these see-through plastic jackets that meant what? They looked out-of-place and silly.  Soon, the same exact question was sarcastically being asked by an onscreen actor.  Another example is when Kysta Now (porn star) attempts to sell her screen play (who doesn't in LA?  apparently not even a looming doomsday can stop Hollywood) with such typical blondness (""apparently, the future is much more futuristic then scientists thought"") that one actor cannot keep a straight face.  Everyone else is nodding along but this one actor cannot stop laughing to himself.  It all seems to be a joke and some of the actors got it and some didn't.  It's almost as if two sets of scripts were handed out on this film, one set said it was a dark comedy and the other set said this was a serious film about the future of America.  Fans of the director's earlier work (Donnie Darko) will not be disappointed.  This movie stands out as a film with edge that many viewers will not fully comprehend (myself included) but can certainly appreciate.  Well worth watching on the big screen to help with the enormity of the what is going on in this film but waiting for the dvd with cribnotes might help.",1195430400,71,3847,4.575182481751825

8233797,2,B000YQK14K,"The thought that kept coming to mind as I watched ""Southland Tales"" was ""poor man's Charlie Kaufman."" What I mean by that is that Kaufman has a way of making strange ideas work together in a cohesive whole that is very satisfying while at the same time mysterious and even nebulous. I imagine the process that Richard Kelly takes to arrive at his stories are very different, less effort, less brilliance, and far less payoff. You get what you pay for I suppose. Not that the movie was cheap or anything, rather it was well produced. It was a cheap effort. The reason the tone of ""Southland Tales"" was comedic was to ensure that it didn't always have to make sense. When Kaufman makes a film the comedy seems to come out of the story and characters. Kelly's comedy is needed to keep one from realizing that he hasn't really done the hard work of asking why-questions. For this reason I don't think you or I should be asking those questions. One thing needs to be made clear: this movie is NOT worth contemplating. It is a shallow effort. One may be tempted to defend the work with terms like ""It doesn't take itself serious"" or ""it has a soft underbelly."" I want to make clear that the comedic elements of this film are 1) not funny 2) necessary to keep the illusion that deep thought and meaning was behind this story. You may imagine that I have a personal hang up with wierd stories but I don't, I just want them to be an honest effort and honesty always shows, and I even in wierd movies. If you fake it, like Richard Kelly did here, then it will show. This is not an honest film, its complications amount to obfuscation, its characters are not remotely developed and provide no emotional attachment to the film. Great art thrives upon limitations. I would have told Richard Kelly that I wouldn't accept any version of this script until it conformed to conventional story structure at least. Why would I have done that? Because he is not creative enough to have made it work. I would have saved to world from a bad movie. Are all great movies conformed to conventional restrictions? Of course not, these structures are bucked by greatness that require something more. ""Southland Tales"" needed limitations. It needed someone that could have looked at the script and said the truth: ""You have a lot of good ideas here but if you won't make an honest effort to make them work together, to make the story be about something, then it needs to be scrapped."" Richard Kelly is a fraud. He thinks he's David Lynch or a brilliant contributor to the esthetic of the post modern movement. He's not, he's the Joseph Smith of film making.",1505692800,,2627,4.532631578947369

B movie acting, time paradoxes, comedy, a zeppelin, Kevin Smith in enough makeup where you won't recognize him unless you're really looking for him.

8233801,5,B000YQK14K,"This is not a movie for everyone. It is a great movie with great acting but it isn't for everyone. There is a lot of side plots which make up the main plot and for that people call it confusing. It isn't as confusing as people think it is, but that could just be me having a higher intellect (which I kind of hope) but it is still confusing. Of course, just like other movies which have confusing elements, the things you don't understand are things you don't need to understand just to enjoy the movie.

The things to understand before going in is that this movie, aside from one thing I will not spoil for those who have yet to see it, is highly realistic. It takes place in an America that is involved in WW3. This America is run by Republicans spying on it's citizens. (Sound familiar?) It has action stars mixed up with porn stars and police who are all mixed up in politics. While this movie is serious it has moments that are hilarious. It is like writers of The Onion got together with the writers of this movie. It is perfect.

Also, Dwayne Johnson, a movie star, playing a movie star is funny in itself, but the fact that the character is nervous and scared when anything dangerous happens is hilarious.

Going into this movie, just accept that you won't get everything the first time, if at all. But, viewing this movie over 10 years later, seeing that much of what is in this movie is happening now, you may see it a bit differently.",1503100800,,1445,4.344444444444444
