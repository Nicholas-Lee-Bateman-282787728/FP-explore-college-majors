8291760,3,B001D50UVK,"As a big fan of the 1980's Dennis the Menace cartoon, i was of course very excited to see this collection. When i got it, i was disappointed to see that it was not as described. The release company of this product is called ""Popcorn Entertainment"" and we can see why. While i am always more wary of these off-brand labels and independent sellers, there were some outright lies and very close shaves to the truth in selling this product. It is labeled ""THE Animated Series"" this would make one think it is the complete series even tho it does not specifically state the ""COMPLETE"" series so my bad there. I had referenced the series on Wiki before buying, but obviously missed the number of episodes made, which was 78. The product states that it contains 30 episodes. Not too bad, i thought, at roughly $1.30 an episode for the $40.00 dollars i paid for it. Even if this had not been the complete series, it still would have been one heck of a deal and a great introductory set. But then it arrives. What they are calling an ""episode"" is actually the short within each complete episode, so there are only 10 complete episodes in this collection. As i had not seen much of this show in over 20 years, i had not remembered they were divided up into shorts. Few people would consider each fragment to be an episode. In all, there were actually 234 of these shorts contained in the 78 episodes, so one receives only a fraction of this lovable series.

Now for the running time. Each short, including the ones with the opening and ending theme song, are only 5-6 minutes long. (i timed them repeatedly.) Even at 6 minutes a pop, that's only 3 hours, or 180 minutes. The little blurb star thing on the case (which is not visible on Amazon because the picture cannot be blown up) says ""over 3 hours of fun."" The ""over"" part must be for that extra animated minute of menu introduction. Ug. A very painful stretch to the truth there.

But even worse. As stated, the ""3 hour"" part is not even visible, but an outright lie is stated in the description of being 340 minutes long. This would set the run time at about 5 some hours, indicating that there were roughly 30 complete episodes with their respective shorts. Each disc contains this lie to as it states ""Aprrox 170 MIN.""

I am having mixed feeling right now. While it is the buyer's responsibility to beware, i am disgusted at the very deceptive marketing from this shady Popcorn Entertainment. It is not apparent whether the individual sellers were aware of this as my product appeared to arrive factory sealed and brand new.
Regardless of the losses in expectations, i am very happy to own these Dennis's as the picture quality is good and the sound quality is to be expected from the 80's with no digital fixes, but that's ok.

The reason i choose to buy from companies and sellers like these is because most times they are the only ones to release many of my obscure and semi obscure favorites from the past. While $40.00 was a steep loss for the number of episodes, I will be keeping my product as it is so convenient to play on my DVD player and this is the most complete collection of the Dennis cartoon series available on DVD at this time, and consecutively, as it starts at the beginning.

What can i say. When you deal with companies like these there's bound to be shadiness.

P.S. I checked more episodes later, and while some appear to be 11 minutes, i still don't think it adds up to 340 mins.",1302825600,18,3453,4.455696202531645
