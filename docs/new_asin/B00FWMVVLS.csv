6033778,5,B00FWMVVLS,Wow! It's not even over yet and I've put this on my wish list for Christmas! Carrie Underwood - and the entire cast - is doing a great job!!,1386201600,18,140,3.8620689655172415
6033779,1,B00FWMVVLS,Underwood does not have the voice nor the acting ability to pull off this remake. The rest of the cast was great.,1386201600,16,113,4.181818181818182
6033780,1,B00FWMVVLS,"I had first posted this review for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Sound-of-Music-Live/dp/B00FWMVVLS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Sound of Music Live!</a>&nbsp;movie while watching it when it aired on NBC

But just because I HATE this version and expressed my opinion about it -- which, BTW is the WHOLE point of a writing a review (NOT to be insincere and falsely fawn over and flatter the subject with a review written through ""rose colored glasses""!) I was constantly bullied with insulting replies, and a low ""helpful review"" score, like nearly every other 1-star reviewer for this item.

I was so MERCILESSLY attacked that I finally just took down my review altogether.

However, after thinking about it for awhile, I decided that I am NOT going to give in to a bunch of intolerant bullies obsessed with stamping out any dissent. This is a HORRIBLE production of ""The Sound of Music"" and I am FAR from the only one who feels that way! Not only did Kym Karath, who played the youngest Von Trapp child, Gretel in the Julie Andrews version, post on Twitter about her disappointment and disgust with this production, but even the surviving Von Trapp family members did NOT approve of this production either.  Which is why I decided to write another review -- and I don't care if I'm flooded with insults, and given a ZERO ""helpful review"" score, I'm not going to let the bullies intimidate me anymore, because even if there are others who disagree, I have a right to my own opinion.

Now, before going any further, I just have to say that I am a HUGE, HUGE fan of ""The Sound of Music"". Not only have I read the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Story-of-the-Trapp-Family-Singers/dp/0060005777/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Story of the Trapp Family Singers</a>&nbsp;the biography/autobiography written by Maria von Trapp, but I also have&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Sound-of-Music-Family-Scrapbook/dp/B008DM2XNY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Sound of Music Family Scrapbook</a>&nbsp;and TWO sets of ""The Sound of Music"" on DVD (the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Five-Star-Collection-Edition/dp/B00003CXCS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Five Star Collection Edition</a>&nbsp;AND the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Two-Disc-40th-Anniversary-Special-Edition/dp/B000AP04OM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Two-Disc 40th Anniversary Special Edition</a>) and incredibly, I'm still considering getting the movie on Blu-Ray at some point in the future (assuming that interest in online streaming does not completely take over/replace the Blu-Ray market!). I have also seen the Julie Andrews version literally probably at least a THOUSAND times (if not more!) since childhood, so many times that I pretty much know it by heart. So no one can say that I am not knowledgeable and a devoted & loyal fan of ""The Sound of Music"" -- and in my opinion, this live version with Carrie Underwood was a HUGE disappointment, and a TOTAL DISGRACE to the original with Christopher Plummer and Julie Andrews!!

Even with all its hype, this production falls flat and the casting, the characters and the acting was all just AWFUL -- and even that is putting it kindly. I couldn't even get through a FEW MINUTES of this before I needed to change the channel and take a break -- and even though I switched back & forth from time to time (mainly to see if it'd get any better -- which it unfortunately did not) I couldn't get through more than a couple minutes of the movie each time, before I was itching to change the channel again!

What is it with everyone producing such AWFUL remakes of ALREADY-GREAT musicals & movies like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Sound-of-Music/dp/B009EELBIS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Sound of Music</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Annie/dp/6305870187/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Annie</a>??

Carrie Underwood is awful as Maria!

She has a good voice but it isn't the right one for this production and she doesn't have the acting ability to pull off the character in this remake. Sadly,  everything about Carrie in this role, from her hairstyle, to her clothes, to her acting ability (or sheer LACK thereof!) was just horrible -- and the word ""insulting"" doesn't even come close to being an adequate description. Even the surviving members of the von Trapp family didn't want Carrie in this role. She may be a great singer, but she definitely is NOT an actress! With years of practice that could change, but doing a live performance, particularly at this time was a huge mistake. Although Carrie's pretty & can sing pretty well, she sounds so whiny and annoying when she's pleading with the Mother Abbess not to send her away (to the Von Trapps) which brings to another point -- the HORRENDOUS casting of Audra McDonald as the Mother Abbess!

Now I am all for equality, justice and non-discrimination, and I absolutely abhor any kind of bigotry, racism & prejudice, but by the same token, there is also a lot to be said for being accurate and realistically true to history, especially when the setting of the work depicted is in past decades/centuries/millenniums. In all seriousness, what Catholic convent in 1930s Austria would have permitted an African-American woman to be the MOTHER ABBESS?!?

During the 1920s and 1930s, an African-American woman even just being an ordinary nun would itself have been extremely unusual (if not even nonexistent!) ANYWHERE in the world, let alone in pre-Nazi era Austria -- but her being in a position of power (like being a Mother Abbess in charge of a convent) would unfortunately have NEVER have happened in that era. It's sad & unfortunate but during those ""Jim Crow"" days. prior to the incredible work done by heroes like Martin Luther King, Rosa Parks, Malcolm X., Medgar Evers and others, and the passage of the Civil Rights Act, and its slowly increasing acceptance, neither black men and especially not black women were allowed to be in any positions of power. As the saying went back then, black women were relegated to being ""maids, mammies and mamas""! And what is it with casting Audra McDonald in every single remake?? She was also cast as Miss Grace Farrell in the remake of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Annie/dp/6305870187/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Annie</a>&nbsp;and she was awful, not to mention historically inaccurate, there as well!

This is NOT about either racism, multi-culturalism, or ""political correctness"" -- its about sheer historical inaccuracy, that stretches the limits of believability. Its like remaking&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gone-with-the-Wind/dp/B00004RF96/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gone with the Wind</a>, and recasting Scarlett O'Hara with a Chinese woman, Rhett Butler with an African-American, Ashley Wilkes with a Latino, Melanie Hamilton with a Native American, India Wilkes with a woman from India (and I say that being of Indian descent myself!) and Mammy & Prissy with fair-skinned, blue-eyed blondes! Because that's what the ridiculous casting in these remakes basically amounts to -- changing the cast's characteristics, simply for the sake of political correctness and multi-culturalism, and the truth of history be damned!

Unfortunately. the rest of the casting and acting in this movie is just as bad, if not worse!

Nearly every character is unbearably annoying and petulant, and the way they deliver their lines so forcefully, it almost sounds like they were under duress to say it. Rather than being lovable and adorable like the von Trapp children (especially Gretel) in the original movie were, the kids come off as total brats. Even most kids taken off the street could act better than the von Trapp children or even Carrie Underwood or Steven Moyer in this movie. Instead of being the stern but basically loving Captain like in the movie, this Captain Von Trapp just comes off as an irritating, heartless and insensitive tyrant! From what I saw (I couldn't get through more than even half of this movie) there was not been one single character in this production that I liked. Maybe if the cast had been honing their acting skills by doing these performances in front of a live audience for a year or two before televising it, it would have worked for a live TV airing. But that wasn't the case, and all the characters were really fake and rehearsed. NONE of their dialogues sounded effortless, like they were saying those lines naturally as part of their normal conversation, but rather like it's like something they'd practiced beforehand and/or are being forced to say!

If that's not bad enough, the producers changed around the order/placement of the song sequences in this movie, in the most ludicrous ways. For example, they moved the ""My Favorite Things"" song (which in the original movie, that Maria sings/teaches the von Trapp children during the thunderstorm scene) and putting it in the scene where Maria is in the Mother Abbess's office! The last straw for me, was when Maria and the Mother Abbess were singing the song together and the Mother Abbess is sitting on her desk, dangling her legs back & forth like she is a kid riding a swing! RIDICULOUS! What is she like 5 years old?? *smh*

I just wish I had never seen this movie in the first place, and I hope this crap doesn't end up sullying my memories of the original movie! I regret that I have wasted time on this garbage, when there were so many other nicer things I could have seen instead :(

All in all, IMHO this movie has been horrible IN EVERY WAY, and I will never buy it on DVD!!!!",1386201600,20,10137,5.618705035971223
6033781,3,B00FWMVVLS,"I'm very mixed with this production. This may seem harsh but I feel everyone did better than Carrie Underwood. I was not impressed with her acting in this production and I had mixed feeling toward her vocals. There were some really good moments and then there were times where she seemed to struggle vocally. We all know Carrie Underwood can sing country music, so when I heard she was chosen for this role, I did question the decision.
Overall the production is solid. It's not terrible, but it's not great.
I'd give it a 7/10",1386201600,12,527,4.557894736842106

6033783,5,B00FWMVVLS,"After seeing the tv special one week ago about making this stage production of The Sound of Music, I'm looking forward to seeing it performed  live on December 5th and receiving my copy of the DVD.  This production follows more closely the original 1959 stage production of The Sound of Music that starred Mary Martin and Theodore Bikel.  This version's scenery is beautiful, elaborate and realistic (always a challenge for stage productions).  I will always love the movie version and saw it in the theatre when it first came out in 1965.  Julie Andrews will always be magnificent as Maria.  I think there is room to appreciate both versions.  Live performances are very rare on tv; I read one of the last plays to be performed live on tv was Peter Pan starring Mary Martin in the 1950's.",1385942400,30,789,4.673913043478261

6033785,5,B00FWMVVLS,"I am a huge fan of The Sound of Music, but when I learned that Carrie Underwood was playing Maria, I wasn't so sure about it.  I love her voice, but is it right for that show?  I got the answer, which is a big YES after watching the making of the show this past week.  Her voice has gorgeous range and she just looks the part.  And the kids...Wow!  They are going to be fantastic in it!

This is going to based on the original 1959 Mary Martin stage version, not the 1965 Julie Andrews movie so a few songs are switched around and a couple were added.

Just a little edit to my original post... this version has a song from the 1965 movie (""Something Good"") and ""Ordinary Couple"" is no longer in the show.",1385769600,37,705,4.102189781021898

6033800,4,B00FWMVVLS,I like it for what it is... A decent television broadcast with a cast that is probably doing their best.

6033802,1,B00FWMVVLS,"I was hoping that this would be good. I love the film, but I was hoping for a version that was closer to the original play. This version adheres to the original script (with the substitution of the film's ""Something Good"" for the original ""Ordinary Couple""), but the overall performances are flat and wooden. Christian Borle and Laura Benati do their best to raise the production, but they cannot overcome Carrie Underwood's poor acting. ""Sound of Music"" succeeds or fails based on the actress playing Maria. Underwood certainly looks the role and is a capable singer, but is wooden and flat as an actress. I have seen better acted Marias in high school performances. Stephen Moyer, who was dynamic in HBO's ""True Blood"", is strangely wimpy here as Captain Von Trapp. A Maria with which he could have had chemistry with might have improved his performance. If you want a TV production that is satisfying and true to the source material, I suggest you find the version done for UK TV. It is available on DVD, but you need a region free player to watch it. Overall, that version is much more enjoyable than the noble, but failed attempt.",1491782400,,1135,4.708542713567839

6033810,5,B00FWMVVLS,"The Robert Wise movie has the stunning, sweeping visual grandeur of Salzburg, as well as the voices of Julie Andrews and Margery McKay (voice double for Peggy Wood's Mother Abbess character), but this new live production gets the nod from me because it has the two fabulous (and very well sung) Max-Elsa duets (""How Can Love Survive"" and ""No Way to Stop It"") and Audra McDonald's voice and stage presence.

Robert Wise reportedly deleted the Max-Elsa duets because he wanted to focus on Maria and the kids, but these two songs not only have some of the best melodies and lyrics in the entire script, but they also foreshadow and then cleanly accomplish the Georg-Elsa breakup in a logical fashion. Their excision is arguably the Wise movie's most glaring fault.",1483142400,2,761,4.8538461538461535

6033832,2,B00FWMVVLS,"I enjoy watching remakes of favorite movies and musicals.  They often add freshness or nuances to the original productions.  I admit I loved the iconic 1965 film.  I watched this 2013 performance with a very open mind.  I enjoyed seeing the stage version of the musical, rather than the film version, with which I am most familiar.  I was aware the song order was changed, and other songs cut from the film were included, which was a big positive.  I've only seen the stage version a few times.

This could have been good if someone else other than Carrie Underwood was cast as the lead role.  I realize it was done since she was the ""star"" drawing power to make this project a success.  (Though in my opinion Anne Hathaway would have drawn the same interest.) Ms Underwood is not Julie Andrews.  Ms Hathaway would also not be Julie Andrews.  No one can be Julie Andrews.  That's OK. No one is expecting Julie Andrews coming back to stage as a young woman.  I can get over Ms Underwood's singing voice being different.  My biggest problem is her acting.  It was very, very wooden and emotionless.  It's hard getting past that.

Other reviews criticized the casting of Audra McDonald as the Mother Abbess. Yes, it is highly unlikely that there would be a black nun in 1937 Austria, especially as the Mother Abbess.  But it's 2016.  Can't we get past criticizing these non-historical casting decisions based on race?  Ms McDonald can certainly act and sing, and she performed wonderfully in her part. It's far past time to see past an actor's external features and focus on her singing and acting.  (I just wish the other nuns in the production were better singers!  Their voices were shaky and did not come  together at all.  But I guess that's to be expected since they're not church musicians, they are likely theater singers.  Both equally valid types of singing, but hardly interchangeable.)",1458432000,,1894,4.701219512195122

6033927,4,B00FWMVVLS,"Over the last decade, TV has become about serialized dramas and reality TV.  Thats why NBC took a big risk with their recently aired The Sound of Music Live!  It was a one night only performance of a classic stage musical.  And it was aired live (well, on the East Coast).  Plus it was family friendly entertainment.  While this kind of thing used to be a staple of TV, it hasn't been done in years.  The gamble paid off ratings wise, and I enjoyed it as well.

Just in case you aren't familiar with the musical, it tells the story of Maria (Carrie Underwood).  She is planning to become a nun in 1930s Austria, but she doesnt quite fit in to the convent.  The Mother Abbess (Audra McDonald) sends her to Captain Von Trapp (Stephen Moyer) to be the governess for his seven children.  While she wins their heart, the captain is winning hers.  But with Germany threatening to invade any day, does any of it matter?

Now before I go any further, there are some complaints I have seen about this musical that I need to set straight.

THIS WAS A FILMED VERSION OF THE STAGE MUSICAL.  THIS WAS NOT A NEW VERSION OF THE MOVIE.

And yes, that is an important distinction and it comes into play in two important places.

The first is the music.  The famous Julie Andrews movie rearranged a couple of the songs, added one, changed one, and took out two.  This version stuck to the original stage play.  That means Maria and Mother Abbess sing My Favorite Things before Maria leaves the convent and Maria sings The Lonely Goatherd to distract the kids during the lightning storm her first night with them.  Additionally, you won't see I Have Confidence at all.  The only change from the movie they kept was the love song.  The Captain and Maria sing Something Good instead of An Ordinary Couple.  Honestly, neither of these songs rises to the level of the rest of the classics from this play, but I do prefer Something Good a bit more.

The other place the fact this is a play comes into production is the sets.  This was filmed in a soundstage, so yes, the times when the characters are supposed to be outside look fake.  But I expected that going into it.  They didn't spend a year in another country filming on location.  They spent three hours filming the entire thing from start to finish.  When you consider that, the sets look pretty good to me.  Think of something youd see for some sitcoms, and youll be fine.  And honestly, when Ive seen this play down before, Maria sings The Sound of Music with just a curtain behind her and we have to use our imagination to come up with the mountain shes on.  This is already a huge step ahead of that.

Can you tell I feel passionately about this?  Thats because after being an extra in the party scene, I have long wanted someone to create a filmed version of the play.  Yes, I love the Julie Andrews movie.  I will always love the Julie Andrews movie.  I consider it a classic.  But that doesnt mean it isn't untouchable.  That is how one group of people interpreted the story, but others can do it again.  (Yes, its the play goer in me talking.)  As I said, the original movie took out two songs, both of which I love, but this version put them back in the story.  Both are fun, and they help develop Elsa and the Captain, which makes him a better love interest and us care a bit when he and Elsa break up.  The reordered songs reveal different things about different characters.  And the play is more grounded in the German/Austria politics of the time than the movie, which make the climax feel more like part of the story.  Oh, and the play is also kinder to Rolf and Liesel at the end than the movie.

Of course, the movie shows a bit more of Maria and the Captain falling in love than the play does.  Its very little, but it does help.  And the filming on location absolutely helps.  While the dance numbers here are certainly fun (I was smiling as I watched them), they don't compare to the ones from the movie because a movie used many more locations and inventive dance moves.

So lets discuss the biggest weakness of this filmed play version of the story  Carrie Underwood.  Those who criticize her acting are correct.  I certainly found her watchable, and she seemed to relax as the play went forward, but she was stiff early on.  Really, I would call it unpolished more than bad.  Then again, others in the cast had their moments that seemed a bit awkward.  For the most part, they were fine, however, and Stephen Moyer really impressed me with how he made the Captain so much more real than Christopher Plummer ever did.  I can actually see why Maria would fall for him here.

Honestly, one thing that would have helped the actors is a live audience in the studio.  There is nothing like a live audience to help bring a performance to life.  Ive found that with the little bit of skits and plays Ive done.  There are laugh lines in this play that fall flat no matter who says them without an audience to laugh at them.  The energy of an audience makes a huge difference.  While the cast did a good job, it could have been so much better with someone there to encourage the actors.

One place I cant fault anyone is the musical numbers.  All the classics you love are here, and they sound wonderful.  If I didn't know Carrie was a country singer, Id never know it from this play  she lost all of her twang for the part.  The choreography is fun, too.

So which is better?  As I said, the Julie Andrews version is a classic, and this filmed play is not going to shake that at all.  But that doesnt mean we cant enjoy this one, too.  I plan to enjoy both for years to come depending on which one I am in the mood to watch.  Its nice to have a choice since I like both the stage version and the movie version of this story.

So sit down with an open mind and give the filmed play a chance.  You just might find some new moments in The Sound of Music Live! that youll enjoy.",1434153600,3,5921,4.325136612021858

Carrie Underwood did a adequate job and Stephen Moyer always does a decent job.  --Now to slap myself in the face I have to say that although Julie Andrews was great as Maria and I always enjoy Stephen Moyer there is absolutely nothing like the emotion of Christopher Plummer singing ""Edelweiss"" one of my favorite scenes of any musical I've ever seen.

6033947,1,B00FWMVVLS,"There was a golden opportunity here to put the original Broadway play on the screen, which is significantly different to the film, but they blew it, big time. There's not one good thing to say about it. The original Broadway show was a warm, dignified affair, with some book problems and a couple of  below top drawer songs, which were dropped from the film - but even though some of it was mediocre, it was classy. This miscast mess has all the dignity and class of' America's Got Talent'. There's not one authentic moment in it. Rodger's and Hammerstein would be turning in their graves. These two giants of the American musical theater were men of integrity, and the best of their shows were about big issues. The Sound of Music, in it's original incarnation, was not just about appealing singing children. It was about the horrors of the Nazi regime creeping up upon ordinary citizens, the desperate attempts to try to retain some sense of normality, and the appalling racism that was about to engulf Europe, and shock the world. This is what gave the show, and all the wonderful songs, substance. Julie Andrew's much loved boarding-school hockey mistress performance in the film is largely responsible for the fact that this show is now a shadow of what it originally was. And under these circumstances, casting Audra MacDonald as a Mother Superior in Austria in this period in history is historically ludicrous. I suppose this was a ratings triumph. But from my point of view, The Sound of Music has become a cartoon.",1428105600,7,1523,4.768939393939394

Like most people, I had conflicting feelings at first, for I knew it wouldn't be as great as the original, but I knew Carrie Underwood was going to nail her role, for she has a stunningly beautiful voice and is among my top 3 favorite singers of all-time. So when I watched this on NBC, I was just blown away. I didn't expect it to be as entertaining and beautiful as it was. It even included two songs that weren't in the original film (obviously due to lack of time). The dancing and choreography was just stunning. Carrie nailed it as I knew she would. Heck, I even had chills running down my spine and my eyes watering up as Audra McDonald sang Climb Every Mountain, and I never had spine chills or tears in my eyes at any Sound of Music song before, since I've known them all ever since I was five!

6033967,5,B00FWMVVLS,"When I first noticed via the previews on TV that Carrie Underwood was playing the part of Maria, I was truthfully stunned and had to say ""Her?!""
After all, she is the ""Are-you-ready-for-some-football?!"" girl, and yet, this adorable blue-eyed blonde did show the public that she was a capable actress, as she was. And too, Audra McDonald, who has always been a favorite actress/singer of mine, did so very well as the caring Reverend Mother. Stephen Moyer adapted himself to two roles well, one as the hard, often cold Navy Captain Gaylord Von Trapp, and the other as the caring father to his children and simultaneously the loving husband to Maria. While I liked practically all the songs in this Rodgers and Hammerstein musical, I do think the nuns sung Latin so well at the opening part of the drama and, of course, again Audra McDonald and Carrie Underwood were definitely accomplished singers. Christian Borle was a jolly Uncle Max, and Laura Benanti was a very appealing baroness. The Von Trapp children were well-chosen as were the mean Germans during the time of the Auschlitz. The artificial Austrian mountains were very beautiful and refreshing-looking. The only matter which has caused me to wonder about ""The Sound of Music"" is how would people like to be reminded of the rule of Hitler and WWII itself. Still, the drama is very warm and drawing, and I personally can't help but think that that will always be the case. Definitely one of my favorites.",1421884800,,1462,4.828685258964144

6033974,5,B00FWMVVLS,"I think Carrie Underwood did a fabulous job. The critics that criticized her should have kept in mind  that this was a stage play and not a movie where they can do fantastic things with a camera. Her acting was very good and she related well to the children.

6033978,5,B00FWMVVLS,Carrie Underwood did an outstanding job!!!!!  She is very believable in the role.  This isn't a movie that is trying to top the original or take anything away from Julie Andrews.  It was great to see that Hollywood (if they try hard) can actually produce a good musical.,1420329600,,270,4.583333333333333
6033979,4,B00FWMVVLS,"Carrie Underwood was attacked for her performance in this TV version of the original musical play, but the reality is that her lack of experience dovetailed so perfectly with the character of Maria Rainer that this became a very poignant and affecting production of the stage show. In particular the contrast between Underwood's unworldly Maria and Laura Benanti's self-assured Elsa Schrader made for more interesting dramatic tension than could have been expected, given the familiarity of the story. Audra McDonald was terrific... and her scenes with Underwood are among the best I've ever seen these characters played.",1420243200,,621,5.412371134020619
6033980,5,B00FWMVVLS,"Carrie Underwood is superb as Maria. I like this version even better than the original, and I loved the original too.

My kiddos saw the original version after seeing this and while they did enjoy the original, they prefer this version.",1419984000,,265,4.3
6033984,5,B00FWMVVLS,"I watched this when it was live back in Dec 2013.  I really enjoyed it.  (I never saw the original with Julie Andrews, but now I want to.)  The music is nice.  People who know the movie had other things to say.  I heard one critic talk about how Carrie Underwood is no Julie Andrews.  I say, ""well...duh!"" to that statement.

This is a new look on the old classic.  It will be different from the original.  If you can accept that, you will enjoy this movie.  You gotta keep in mind though, this version is live, meaning no retakes, no editing, and all errors are there.  Forget a line?  We see it.  Mess up a key note?  We hear it.  Think of this as a version you would go to the theater and see on stage...then you can be less like the critic who says ""Carrie Underwood is no Julie Andrews.""

I do know that some songs in this live version are not in the same area as in the old classic.  For example, the song ""These are a few of my favorite things"" is sung with the thunder in the movie but sung with the nuns before meeting the children in this version.  So...if you expect to hear certain songs in specific places, forget about it.  Most of the songs in the classic make it, but I do know at least one that did not.  The song Julie Andrews sings as she's heading to the house for the first time is NOT in the live version.

Other surprises may be in store if you know and love the classic.  If you never seen the classic, pick this up and watch it.  You may find yourself in my shoes.  I enjoyed watching this live version and can't wait to see how it compares to the classic version.",1419984000,,1589,4.084415584415584

This is the first time I've seen and paid attention to TSOM and can honestly say I'm mad at myself.  This is a fantastic story with songs that I've known all my life just not where they were from.

As for this version of it, every single actor/actress does an amazing job here.  For it being a live telecast and no doubt full of nerves, everyone performs as if playing it in the real world without cameras.  Even the children actors were spot on and kids are usually the ones to flub something up.  This is an emotionally investing performance and I'm so glad to have finally viewed it! I know a lot of people are protective of the movie version of SOM, but I'm not....with that open mind, I love this and will be seeking out the movie version now.",1418774400,2,920,4.252873563218391

6034011,4,B00FWMVVLS,"First I want to say that I've read most of the reviews online, and by and large, I do agree with the reviewers on the internet about this live show. However, on a personal level, despite the shortcomings of the various cast members, I've found myself to love this rendition of the Sound of music more and more, simply because as I watch it over again and again, my personal expectations and comparisons to the original Julie Andrews performance started to fade, and I could begin to appreciate this version for what it is.

Once again, it's by no means perfect, but I feel that we do have gems in this version. I'll list out the parts that I've grown to love (over the original version even):
1. Audra Mcdonald as Reverend Mother is really a joy to watch.
2. I'm surprised that few people mention it, but I thought Ariana was simply lovely and adorable as Liesl! Watch her eye and facial movements when she does sixteen on seventeen. Extremely endearing. I think that's really a gem.
3. Baroness.. oh, Laura Benanti is the best Baroness I've ever seen. Sexy, smart and sings so well too.
4. Carrie's performance actually improves as she goes along the show. I thought her performances in ""Climb every mountain"" and ""Lonely goatherd"" was the best (how many people can yoodle and jump on the bed at the same time?). Very watchable.

There are probably other parts here and there, but I don't want to get too much into detail. I've bought the DVD version simply cos I believe that this version will stay as a personal classic for me, alongside the Julie Andrews version.",1412294400,,1567,4.572953736654804
6034012,5,B00FWMVVLS,"I have never seen The Sound of Music, neither the play or film, before but it is interesting to find out I knew many songs from the play. I think this live performance was absolutely amazing and that Carrie Underwood did an excellent job. I do think they should have cast someone else for the roal of Mother Abbess as in the time period this took place a black woman would not have been allowed in a convent, well they may have been but not as the Reverend Mother, so they should've done better with historic accuracy. I will say that Audra McDonald has a splendid voice but she seriously stood out like a sore thumb amongst the rest of the cast. But other then that the show was absolutely amazing. You just do not get a lot of musicals today that do the dancing like those in My Fair Lady, Oliver! and many other musicals that took place back in the late 1800s/early 1900s. Though only thing I will point out is though Underwood has an amazing voice, she needed a bit more practice singing with a lot of people on a sound stage, she got overpowered a lot when she sang with the children. But that'll be it for the musical. It is absolutely amazing. I give the performance five out of five stars.

I think this is a great release. Though I loved watching the live performances on the TV I am not a big commercial person in fact I love to DVR more then anything because I can fast forward past the commercials but with the DVD you need not to worry about the commercial. The DVD includes one special feature, a behind the scenes documentary. Even though I have not watched the documentary yet but I am sure it will be very interesting to see the process behind this great musical. When I have watched it I will update this and give you some information on it. But I am glad this has come out. Though I will say it would've been nice to have it on a Blu-ray/DVD combo but just on DVD is great meaning no one will get more special features cause they can afford the Blu-ray then those who cannot, that I find a lot more fair for sure so that is definitely another good plus for this release. So with no commercials, a behind the scenes documentary and everyone having a fair amount of bonus features, this is a great DVD release of a great musical history event.

I know that I said I would update this and add a comment about the documentary and I completely forgot until I was going back through my recent reviews and I noticed I had done two reviews since this and yet to update this one as I had seen the documentary since. I will update this as well saying that the DVD also included a semi-behind the scene/commercial for the soundtrack that was released for this special and that the behind the scenes documentary was actually very interesting as I thought it would be as it talk about the production being started with Carrie Underwood being cast in 2012 for the role of Maria von Trapp and it also give you an indepth on the casting of the Von Trapp children. So definitely was an interesting watch. Again I apologize for the delayed update.",1411948800,,3048,4.326923076923077

Having seen theatrical productions on both sides of the Atlantic along with the 1965 cinematographic version. This is the best I have seen. Despite the backlash I think Carrie Underwood was fantastic as Maria. Her singing and her choice of acting captures the role
beautifully. Its how I always imagined Maria after reading her biography.

It was decent but let's be honest what will compare to the original. Julie Andrews is incredible and a legend in her own way! It can't be replaced but looking form the perspective of it just as a different mood in general it was quite cute. It was something our whole family could watch. I thought Carrie underwood was very adorable and I am not going to be one of those people who rants on about the movie and how horrible she was.

6034045,1,B00FWMVVLS,"The idea of filming a stage version of ""Sound of Music"" though a rating winner, is a disaster to anyone who knows anything about music theatre, the Broadway stage and musical films. Produced to formula it sticks almost religiously to the original book of the musical which in itself is a bad  musical play  and the weakest of all the R&H canon and the most dated. It was dated a year after it opened and Ernest Lehman did wonders to revitalise it for film. The fact that the producers decided to cling to the original clunky script is the first of many mistakes. Also the whole idea of it being live is a gimmick that is already unnecessary and to be honest un believable (who knows if every second of the show is live or some pre recorded and who cares) The other disaster is both leads are weak actors with Carrie Underwood really amateurish. Did we need this? No? is it a good idea? No. Will it continue with other musicals?Yes, tired originals of other old musicals will be dished out for a little while, but it is a gimmick that will soon die. There are so many more musicals worthy of this treatment. Even despite a bit of good singing from Audra McDonald(like all the others her acting is contrived and false)the only person who comes out of it unscathed is Laura Benanti who brings real spirit and likeability to Elsa. Old Baron Trapp made a big mistake letting her slip through his fingers.!!",1398988800,7,1401,4.46875

I am always fighting for the original form of musicals and here I think I must say that I am very grateful to Encores! of New York City Center for resurrecting musicals that way: I have enormous praise for their aim.

6034066,5,B00FWMVVLS,"I heard a lot of complaining about how little chemistry there was between Stephen Moyer and Carrie Underwood.  I also read a lot about Carrie Underwood trying to be Julie Andrews.  Firstly, people need to realize that this was a television version of the stage play, and not the movie (the script of which was heavily rewritten).  Captain von Trapp was softened quite a bit for the purposes of the movie.  Stephen Moyer did an admirable job given that the part of Captain von Trapp as in the play gave him a lot less to work with that he would have had if it was a remake of the movie.  And Carrie Underwood was not trying to be Julie Andrews.  She is not an actress, this being her first major acting job.  Shirley Jones was not much of an actress in her first few movies either, and Julie Andrews was nearly fired from ""My Fair Lady"" because she was doing so poorly in rehearsals.  Carrie was a bit flat, but she was WONDERFUL with the children, and she most definitely has the pipes and range to play anything (check out the two octave at a time jumps at the end of ""Do-Re-Mi"").  With more work, she could become a very good actress. The surprises were the Mother Abbess, who came across as much more human in this script, helped along by the performance of Audra MacDonald and dialogue filling out the character.  And Laura Benanti's Elsa Schraeder was much less obviously scheming and played her comedy bit much better than the more brittle Eleanor Parker in the film.  And the songs for Max and Elsa were put back.  The look on Laura's face at the end of ""No Way to Stop It"" when she realized that she had soiled her potential nest was fabulous. The main change from the play was the use of ""Something Good"" in the engagement scene as opposed to ""An Ordinary Couple,"" a song R & H were rightly not happy with.  They always meant to replace it, but Oscar Hammerstein became ill before they could do anything with it.
My response to the nay sayers is - you be a gentleman who has done some stage work but mainly does filmed TV or a young lady performing her first acting job in an iconic piece of musical theatre on live national television and see how well you do.  I, for one was thoroughly enchanted.",1393459200,2,2207,4.364303178484108

There were so many negative reviews and negative comments (one supposedly from a member of the von Trapp family).  That I will tell you why I loved it.  I watched as Julie Andrews did the live performance of CINDERELLA on TV in black and white back in the late 50's?? or 60's and it was beautiful.  Ms. Andrews' voice sparkled and the scenery, the acting were spot on--- it was live!  Now years later, we see another newcomer (to movies) with a beautiful voice do a LIVE production of a role that Ms. Andrews made popular years before on the big screen.  I applaud Carrie Underwood for having the courage to take on this part and do it so well.  She never claimed to have a voice or acting abilities like Julie Andrews, yet she held her own with Broadway theatre actors in this LIVE production.  Each time I watch this DVD, I marvel at the beauty of the scenery, the acting and the right on chemistry between the actors.  I especially loved the interactions between Ms. Underwood and the children.  After this review, I'm ready to watch it again.  Enjoy!",1393286400,4,1197,4.460829493087558

Julie sings and dances her way  to perfection.  the guy who played Rolf looked 25.  most of all, this was such a poor production on all accts.  How can one compare Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer to these no talent actors?  the only great part about it was  the amazing Audra MacDonald who sang ""Climb Every Mountain""  (such a hackneyed song) so beautifully, it sounded so fresh,  full of meaning and beautiful.  she took my breath away.

The whole dysfunctional family must come out of their shell. A merger with Germany ""Anschluss sterreichs"" looms in the background and may also be a catalyst.

Nothing can really beat the good stage production. However recording one comes close. At best for most people these are reflections of experiences they've already had with the real presentation.

I've only seen the movie version so this is the closest am going to come unless something turns up locally. I find this televised stage production holds my attention and has facets that were actually missing from the movie production.

Everyone was good in their part and sounded great; however the other singers were outclassed by Audra McDonald.

The sets are beautiful. There is a 37 piece orchestra. The presentation has many popular actors such as Stephen Moyer, as Captain Von Trapp. Whom I first saw in a Midsummer Murder ""Death in Disguise.""

Like many people I saw the production first on television. I suggest that you purchase this DVD as the extras such as ""The Making of The Sound of Music Live!"" add to the experience.

Christian...I don't know, he sounded good, but I didn't think he particularly fit the role. Unfortunately, my main issues were the Captain and Maria. I think Carrie would've done well with a few more rehearsals maybe (will give the benefit of the doubt). And I have liked Stephen in other roles, but he just didn't...charm me. At all.

It's important to remember, that here you're watching a live theatre performance. No re-takes, no helicopters swooping in over the mountains, no mountains for that matter - just stage scenery. Theatre is many times harder and more complicated to perform than film because you have to be perfect. It can't be edited, it can't be re-shot. As great as the film with Julie Andrews was, it never could have been shot live. I love both versions, but I certainly respect the degree of difficulty that went in to making this live stage performance. First rate. 5 stars.

6034115,5,B00FWMVVLS,I loved this live version of the Sound of Music. The entire cast did a stellar job and Carrie Underwood was a very charming and lovable Maria. I thought the singing was as good or better than in the movie and the acting on a par and better in some cases. The best part was we were able to watch this beloved classic from the comfort of our living room. The DVD is a fabulous keepsake.,1389916800,2,384,4.065789473684211

That's simply sad, and I strongly believe more a reflection of the shallowness and immaturity of those who don't understand her expression and integrity in her version of this wonderful work. Of course she has an accent! So what?? These people spoke a southern German dialect, not Boston English. Who can say whether or not a Berliner might not have thought the Von Trappes might have had a ""southern hick"" accent as well. What matters is the perfection, the beauty, the sound of this wonderful version. My wife of 47 years and I will cherish it alongside the more famous version forever, because in its way, it is just as outstanding.

children and Captain Von Trapp.  I also liked her hair style, more like Maria Von Trapp than Julie Andrews.
The Captain Stephen Moyer has a great singing voice and his singing of Edelweiss provided one of the more moving moments of
the show.

Perfect for all ages.",1389484800,2,233,4.4186046511627906
6034134,5,B00FWMVVLS,"I find it sad that there were narrow-minded meanies who actually proclaimed publicly on the internet (before the live show even aired) that it was going to be a flop, it could never hold a candle to the movie, Miss Underwood could never hold a candle to Miss Andrews, etc.  After all that, Miss Underwood must have been terrified that night!

She had nothing to fear.  It's true that Carrie isn't Julie.  However, Julie isn't Carrie either.  Each lady is unique and brought her own special talents to the role of Maria.

I loved the movie.  Over the years I have probably seen it 30 times.  But I don't think it's fair to compare the two.  A movie and a live stage play are two completely different animals.  My husband is a big fan of the movie as well.  But we both sat and watched The Sound of Music Live (the entire three-hour show) and we were enthralled by this charming version.

It's almost staggering to me to think of all that must have gone into the production of this show.  What a thrill it was to see it live.  It was a malor accomplishment on every level.  The sets were beautiful, the costumes were beautiful, and really every aspect of the production was excellent.

Those who say Miss Underwood can't act should watch the show again - I saw tears in her eyes a couple of times, real tears, and that is acting.  She was marvelous in the role, charming, energetic, vivacious and fresh.  Special kudos to the kids as well, all the kids were really terrific.

Audra McDonald as Mother Superior was simply stunning.  I read recently that she, Angela Lansbury, and Julie Harris have each won 5 Tony awards as best actress, an unsurpassed record.  When Miss McDonald sang ""Climb Every Mountain"" it was just breathtaking - and not only her fantastic voice, but her acting as well.  I believe that in order to be successful in a musical, an actor must excel not only in singing but also in acting.

If I had to come up with any criticism of the show, I would have to say that I was disappointed that occasionally the music was so loud you almost couldn't hear the singer(s).  Also, Maria's wedding dress didn't look to me like something Maria would have worn at her wedding, or any woman of the time would have worn.

All in all, a simply wonderful show, and one that I'll watch and rewatch once a year or so, just as I do the movie.",1389484800,6,2342,4.403263403263403

There were so many changes made from the original version, I had SERIOUS difficulty making it to the end. Songs were out of order, performed by the wrong/different cast members, added to give cast members an opportunity to sing or completely cut from the production. Additionally, there are small plot lines added that have no business being in the production (ex: Nazi's coming to Von Trapp's home and commanding him to perform).

Carrie can sing, I will give her that, but no one in their right mind should attempt to fill the shoes previously owned by Julie Andrews.",1389139200,,731,4.658914728682171

What I loved best is knowing that with the use of the backgrounds used as I was able to pay far more attention to the story!

6034146,2,B00FWMVVLS,"Several decades ago, a Broadway Musical on TV wasn't an odd thing at all. Think of Alfred Drake in ""Kiss Me, Kate"" (NBC, 1958) or Mary Martin in ""Peter Pan"" (1955, 1956) and Julie Andrews in ""Rodgers and Hammerstein's  Cinderella"" (1957). Mary Martin and Julie Andrews are both, of course, forever connected to ""The Sound Of Music."" Mary Martin won a Tony Award for her performance as Maria in the original 1959 Broadway Production. Six years later, not being cast in the film version of her stage triumph ""My Fair Lady"", Julie Andrews  received an Academy Award nomination for her  beautiful and, yes,  iconic performance as Maria in Robert Wise's 1965 Academy Award winning film version.
  About a decade ago, when they started bringing musicals back to TV (""Gypsy"", ""The Music Man"", ""Bye Bye Birdie"" and ""Cinderella"") producers Craig Zadan and Neil Meron promised, swore, in fact, that they would NEVER TOUCH ""The Sound Of Music."" With good reason. Robert Wise's film version, being as near perfect a film version of a Broadway musical as we will ever see, is too fixed in the public consciousness. Well, something happened. Somebody decided to do ""The Sound Of Music"": Live"" returning to the Original Broadway stage script.  That in itself must have been shocking to those fans who didn't even realize ""The Sound Of Music"" was a Broadway musical before it became a movie.  The real wild card here is Carrie Underwood. Who? Not caring anything about ""American Idol"" or country music, I had to Goggle Carrie Underwood to discover who, in fact, she is. Well, honey, a cute face, strong singing voice, six Grammy Awards, and an ""American Idol"" fan base will NEVER magically transform you into a musical theatre actress who is appropriate for the celebrated role of Maria Von Trapp.
  At this point, we can see how cold and calculated this enterprise is. NBC wanted ratings. And NBC got ratings. Nearly 18-20 Million people watched to see if Carrie Underwood and Cast would crash and burn. Or triumph? Nothing creates interest like controversy. And by the night of the live Broadcast on December 5, 2013, the  hyperbole and controversy over Carrie Underwood's casting reached a fever pitch. NBC got ratings, but did the big audience get a quality production? The end result was neither a marvelous theatrical revelation nor a theatrical train wreck. Somewhere in between.
  Well, Nonnberg Abbey looked frightening and foreboding. The mountainside set where Underwood belted out the title song looked like something spooky out of ""Hansel And Gretel.""  Nobody would be inspired to sing on that mountainside. Nobody should really be shocked  that Underwood is underwhelming as Maria. She CAN NOT act, and often looks painfully out of her depth. Von Trapp kids Michael Nigro, Ariane Rinehart and Joe West all have more real musical theatre experience than Underwood. That is rather instantly obvious. Stephen Moyer as Captain Von Trapp often seems like he is suffering from an upset stomach. But when Underwood has a confrontational scene with Moyer about being a bad dad to the kids, she suddenly snaps out of her coma. This frees Moyer up. The rest of the production is quite good. The scenes involving the Nazi Anschuluss and climax play out with real dramatic conviction and depth. Unfortunately, the production doesn't become good, interesting or involving until over an hour has passed. The play is only 2 hours and 13 minutes. It's all too little and too late.
  Fortunately, Laura Benanti and Christian Borle as Max and Elsa sparkle and  sing the two cynical songs, ""How Can Love Survive?"" and ""No Way To Stop it"" that were cut from the film version. This provides a nice balance to the more sweet songs. And Audra McDonald as the Mother Abbess is the BROADWAY STAR the production so desperately needed. When McDonald is on, the show belongs to her!!
  In the end, NBC got the ratings it desired. God knows, a lot of money was involved (with over a year to prepare, couldn't Underwood had taken acting lessons?) and NBC just had to sell this DVD, a Cast recording CD, and a ""Sound Of Music"" hot chocolate mug. Still, the audience got a High School Level production, at best, of a beloved musical theatre classic. Certainly the audience, and everyone else involved,  deserved much better than ""The Sound Of Mediocrity.""",1388966400,6,4321,4.907967032967033

Ms. Underwood can sing, I'll give her that, but her acting leaves much to be desired. Her acting and that of several others was stiff and off compared to the characters they were playing.

Thus having painfully sat through this remake of the broadway version I will rate it a tedious and un-interesting if not embarrassing.  Additionally the audio mix in the new one is terrible (or the lead has a very weak voice) and the stage is poor.

Overall nothing in this new version sparkles...I would rate it lower that a typical high school drama club presentation of Fiddler on the Roof...except here I no children I am related to to compele me to attend.  And I am sorry I did.",1388620800,7,741,4.633587786259542

6034152,5,B00FWMVVLS,"The great actor John Barrymore succeeded in the role of Hamlet as few Americans of his time did.  Comparisons with earlier Hamlets were inevitable.  What made his special however, was that he approached the role as if it were written specifically for him.  It was a novel approach and it worked.  No less was this production of The Sound of Music just as special for viewers today, and for exactly the same reason as Barrymore's Hamlet worked in 1924.  This is  a NEW approach to a timeless classic.  In that sense, it worked beautifully.  Carrie Underwood made Maria her own.  She did transform from the flibbertigibbet in the earlier part of the show to a mature woman who was indeed a level headed strong person when she needed to be.  By the same token, Von Trapp transformed to the military martinet in the first part of the show to a loving father in the later scenes when he needed to.  Underwood's transformation was subtle, as it should be, but it was there.  Having seen the show many times on stage in local community theaters, I often missed the transformation because it wasn't there.

Having been an actor and musician for 45 years I know how difficult one time live performances can be.  There are no retakes.  Carrie Underwood was the consummate professional in working with the children and using her professionalism to guide them through this one time event.  For this day and age in Television entertainment, it was great to see something for the whole family done so well.

The sets were great.  The abbey was the abbey, the villa and gardens were beautiful and did not take away from the performances of the actors.  Going back to the staging of the original 1959 show, and the original songs was a great idea.  Would Rodgers and Hammerstein have approved of this new production?  I think they would.  Too often I have seen stage productions of movies rip off movie choreography and staging.  The staging, blocking, and choreography in this production were fresh.  This production should be in every family's video library.  Kudos to everyone involved.

And then I watched the 40th Anniversary DVD of the 1965 movie. The TV version does not replace the movie, but encourages me to revisit the movie because both are fine productions for different media. Bravo to Carrie Underwood for her performance, especially of her musical numbers, but I also found her acting livelier and more heartfelt than critics complained it was. (Incidentally, the 1965 movie wasn't a big hit with the critics either.) Bravo to NBC, too, for assembling such a fine cast for all the roles, for presenting the original stage musical, and for doing it live. It's a joy to see such a lavish stage production with so many sets, but moreover with beautifully sung music (the orchestra is better balanced with the singers on the DVD, too). This is a wonderful companion to the 1965 movie, as well as to the 1957 live TV production of Rodgers & Hammerstein's CINDERELLA starring Julie Andrews.",1388361600,4,1081,4.75531914893617

After all, I saw Julie Andrews in the movie when it was released.  I was nine years old.  I've seen the movie countless times since.  Put aside your doubts and judge this live stage version on its own merits.  It shouldn't be compared to the movie version or the Broadway version.  Both of these changed many facts and features of the book written by Maria Von Trapp about her singing family.  There doesn't have to be ""one"" version that meets the ""purity"" test for lovers of this immortal story.  Carrie Underwood does an amazing job with the music.  Her acting skills have been panned.  Yet I give her kudos for taking on this role in a live version.  Ms. Underwood is not an accomplished actress.  In this version, she is surrounded by several very accomplished actors and actresses.  In my view, Ms. Underwood brought a freshness and vitality to her role as the shy, awkward governess who comes to rescue a family from its prison of grief and misery.

She did a good job with the songs, though I think that no one can ever beat Julie Andrews. The head nun was a black woman, which is entirely inaccurate for the time in history, and for the movie in general  it threw me off. However, she could sing and very well!

6034165,5,B00FWMVVLS,"There's nothing like a live performance, and this huge, stage production gives it all, with the actors, sets and bouncy musical numbers.

First, the stage and movie productions are different.  I love Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer, but if you're looking for them here or something exactly like the movie, you'll be disappointed.  The stage show is shorter, thank goodness, a little over two hours; they leave out some of the songs written for the movie, and put back other songs where they originated, e.g., A Few of My Favorite Things.

The actors are super, the children amazing.  The include a 'making of' featurette which I enjoyed as much as the movie.  These actors and crew worked their tails off!  They put out their best effort with singing, dancing, solo's, cute facial expressions and acting.  The veterans, including Moyer, McDonald, Benanti and Borle perform right on target.

Carrie Underwood offers no English accent.  Her strong, country singing style is subdued, but still offers a bit of that wonderful huskiness and power.  Some say her acting is not polished.  Perhaps.  But I felt it came across simple, genuine, and unpretentious.  Until this performance, I've only seen her on posters and CD covers.  I think overall, and considering the weight of this role, she does wonderfully.

They lay giant sets, Abbey, Mansion, Courtyard, Mountainside, side by side on a soundstage.  There's no audience which would be nice to add their energy, but the sets are extremely well done.  I believe they use 12 cameras and coordinate the shots and close-ups just like a regular edited film.  A live orchestra plays.

I love the big, famous numbers with the children dancing, e.g,, Do-Re-Mi up and down the stairs of the mansion, out to the courtyard and the fountain and mountains; the lightning scene where all the kids run to Maria's room and here, unlike the movie, they sing and dance, to what I call the yodelling goat song. Again, amazing work by the young actors.  The whole show delivers lots of romantic fun with great energy.  My hope is that they do more live shows.

An aside: they always state that this show is only suggested by the story of the Trapp Family singers.  I read that there were 10 children; that the father was a Naval officer but not strict as portrayed; they did not flee Austria from the Nazi's, but left on their own accord, normally, going to Italy first, since the Captain was also an Italian citizen, then to London and eventually, the U.S.; however, it is true, they felt the pressure of German Naziism, which they detested, and wanted to leave before things worsened.",1388188800,5,2620,4.835955056179776

I like both versions, but I enjoyed this one thoroughly. The singers/actors put on a great performance, the set was well designed and the flow of the live performance was done very nicely.

6034172,5,B00FWMVVLS,"I loved the TV version of The Sound of Music. I am a diehard fan; the film version was the first film I saw in a movie theatre. The film is my favorite of all time. I think that the TV version was purposely based on the original stage musical instead of the film so that it would be different. I believe that was a smart move.  I have seen the stage version several times including the 1990 Lincoln Center production with Debby Boone, high school productions, and regional theatre productions. I thought that Carrie Underwood did a great job with the role. I especially liked her musical scenes and dancing. She hit some great soprano notes in Do Re Mi. Her yodeling during The Lonely Goatherd was very effective. I thought she did a particularly good job in the scene where she is begging the Captain to pay more attention to his children. I am so pleased to have a visual and audio representation of the original stage musical that starred Mary Martin and Theodore Bikel. I thought that the TV cast and crew did a great job; the children were great in terms of singing, dancing, and acting. The director did a nice job, the sets were great, and the costumes were right on target. The orchestrations remained loyal to the original ones by Robert Russell Bennett. While live television was the norm back in the early days of television, prerecorded programs have become so much more prevalent in modern times. The production went extremely well with very few glitches.  I recommend this DVD as part of every familys musical collection.

6034183,4,B00FWMVVLS,"Only gave 4 stars because Carrie Underwood's acting and Stephen Moyer's singing could have been a bit better.

But in only a few scenes. The vast majority of this stupendous production was very well-done indeed. The choreography and stagecraft were flawless, and give Carrie credit for this: she brought all of her songs to life, had plenty of dancing and stage business, and never missed a beat. Her scenes with the children were delightful, and her initial scenes with the Captain were as awkward as one would expect them to be for the characters and the situation. Her dance scene with the Captain was perfect, and in that moment you could see the two fall in love.

This being the age of Twitter-bashing though, plenty of people found lots to carp about. Especially when it came to complaining about a superstar who made a courageous leap to a different medium...and succeeded.

I've always enjoyed the movie version because of the gorgeous scenery and the scenes with Maria and the children, even as I cringed through the scenes with Maria and the Captain. The Captain's upper-class banter with the Baroness and Max was always cringeworthy too.

But this version is vastly superior in my opinion, especially since the two marvelous songs ""How Can Love Survive?"" and ""No Way to Stop It"" were restored. Having Christian Borle and Laura Benanti as Max and Elsa was perfect casting indeed.

And as everyone will tell you, Audra McDonald was superb. Her Mother Abbess was lively, compassionate and inspiring, and her voice just soared.

Open your mind and heart, watch, and enjoy. This is a worthy addition to anyone's DVD collection.

Update 12-22-13:

The above review was based on the broadcast version, which I watched several times on NBC's website. I have now had the opportunity to watch the DVD, and while I am still amazed at the performance, I was a bit disappointed that NBC did not see fit to correct some of the sound problems (for example: a definite background hiss during some of the dialogue, and lost dialogue between Elsa and Max) and did nothing to ease the transition of the abrupt scene changes. One can only hope that a Blue-Ray version will be released sometime that will address these issues.",1387497600,4,2217,4.8311345646438
6034184,5,B00FWMVVLS,"I am actually sitting here as I type this watching this movie for the second time, and I can't help but think of all the negative reviews this performance received. I am glad to see that people here on Amazon have been more receptive. In my opinion I think people should not be comparing this to the original because that just is not fair. The original is a classic for a reason and to think a remake will capture that same magic is just unrealistic. I am sure if you look back through the years and look at remakes of varies classics that you will see that they rarely live up to the classics they are portraying.

With that said, I was completely blown away by this rendition of The Sound of Music! I think Carrie Underwood was just incredible! I know she isn't Julie Andrews and Carrie has said this herself, but for her first major acting role I was very impressed. The reviews constantly criticized her for being wooden and not being able to establish chemistry, but I am just not seeing it. I find her acting engaging and her chemistry with her fellow cast members to be more than acceptable. In fact, I find myself being drawn in and captivated by her performance, and this whole remake in general.

Then there is Carrie's vocals. I will not say much about these because there is not much to say. If you spend just five minutes listening to Carrie sing you can not deny that she has some of the best vocals ever heard. Whether you are a Carrie Underwood fan or not no rational person can deny for a second that her vocals are just absolutely incredible and you can really see this from this performance.

So in summary, this remake in my opinion was extraordinary! I found myself captivated by this performance in much of the same way that I was when I watched Julie Andrews. I know I have mainly focused on Carrie, but all the actors in this play were incredible. It was clear to me that everyone worked very hard to make this the best remake possible. I know everyone is entitled to their own opinion I just ask that when you form these opinions that you do it will trying to keep an open mind and remember Carrie isn't Julie Andrews and never will be.

Congrats NBC on a job well done! With 18 million viewers during its premiere I would say they did something right.",1387411200,8,2277,4.375886524822695
6034185,5,B00FWMVVLS,"I have long had two ""The Sound of Music"" performances in my head.  First, the Mary Martin/Theodore Bikel Broadway stage performance from the Broadway Cast album, and then, of course, the Julie Andrews/Christopher Plummer movie.

This is better than the Broadway stage singing performances.  If you compare ""There's No Way to Stop It"" on both sound track/albums, ""The Sound of Music Live!"" wins hands down.  And, of course, Audra McDonald blows away the other two mother abbesses--both in the Broadway cast version and in the movie version.

Then there's the stunning visual quality of HD video.  There's a crispness in the stage scenes that the movie's beautiful real scenes can't match because of the immense improvement in video quality with high-definition.

Julie Andrews is hands down the best actress.  She made Maria glow as a spunky postulant.  But Carrie Underwood lays down another track--the obedience streak that dominates in the last scenes when Maria totally follows the Captain.  Maria's transformation to obedient, supportive wife without inserting any of her spunky rebelliousness is more believable in Underwood's portrayal.  Perhaps it is that seriousness woven from the very beginning in her performance that makes her seem slightly wooden at first.  But, it dovetails perfectly with the Maria who is able to be a quick thinking diplomat when the Nazis demand the Captain's immediate service and whose liveliness fades in comparison to the Captain's seriousness at the end of the story.

As for vocal quality, Underwood is quite different than Andrews, but that she is truly great can be seen in the duet with Audra McDonald.  There is no real disparity in vocal quality with a singer of the obvious quality of McDonald--though the styles are very different.  Both are superb in ""My Favorite Things"". The disparity in Julie Andrews' vocal quality and Christopher Plummer's caused the movie makers to dub Plummer even though he had a reasonably nice singing voice.  And, of course, Andrews never sang with the Mother Abbess (Peggy Wood dubbed by Margery McKay) in the movie.

""The Lonely Goatherd"" is arguably more entertaining in Live! than in the movie version because it focuses on Maria and the children rather than the marionettes and the goatherd story line.  Also the neat bit in the Live! ""Do-Re-Mi"" where Maria is reminded that ""anything"" takes up three notes and has to admit, ""Well, sometimes we do that."" is not in the movie version. It's a nice comedic touch.

Live! wins on ""There's No Way to Stop It"", ""Climb Ev'ry Mountain"", ""The Lonely Goatherd"", and maybe ""Do-Re-Mi"".

It joins the Broadway stage version and the movie version in being a wonderful performance of this marvelous Rodgers and Hammerstein musical.

A. Carrie Underwood may not have been THE best choice for the role of Maria, however she sings the music beautifully, if not traditionally, and doesn't do a half bad jo of acting the role.

B. The songs that are considered ""new"" in this show have actually been a part of the musical since it's original recorded version in 1959. They don't necessarily fit with the story line, which is part of the reason they were cut from the movie. However, they are not ""new"" songs and they were not thrown in just for the heck of it.

C. ""My Favorite Things"" may be in a different place than the 1965 Movie, but they it is in the place it was written to be in 1959.

D. This is a televised recording of the MUSICAL. The production department was not trying to replace Julie Andrews(who will always be THE Maria), but rather offer the public an opportunity to see a classic musical in it's original, Broadway-esque form.

All in all: if you are looking for the movie-musical, don't buy this. If you are willing to keep an open mind and embrace this as an entirely new performance, disconnected entirely from the movie, you should definitely find the time to see this.

And, well-deserved .. .. KUDOS to the cast for the 4 months of preparation for 3-hours of nerve-wracking work!!

CARRIE IS STUPENDOUS & WONDERFUL; And the range of her voice is shocking > Little wonder she was cast as Maria .. .. And, the seven children were basically NY-area students from a casting call? AMAZING!!

Imaginative staging and nice new musical arrangements .. ..

THE 'MAKING-OF' SPECIAL just highlights how special the show is .. ..

I sat down and watched this theater production and was pleasantly surprised. Carrie Underwood's voice is amazing and her performance was good. Really, Carrie Underwood receiving all those bad reviews or comments was unfair. This was a live performance and it's not like they could actually tape in the locations as seen in the original movie and, of course, there was a time frame to fill. For those die hard Sound of Music fans I would say, don't bother. If you're an open minded person, give this live performance a shot and see for yourself.",1387324800,6,703,4.723577235772358

Its not HD, but the audio/video quality is absolutely amazing. Maybe it was the quality of the camera equipment that was using for recording, because in my opinion it looks like HD.
I did not notice any issues with the audio as someone else mentioned.

I'm sure if you compared every character in this movie to the original cast,  you would come up  short every time.  Considering all the  difference in this movie,  the cast did a beautiful job.  The only reason I did not give it 5 stars,  the start with just the nuns in the Abby was way too long.  Cutting some of the time  at the start of the movie,  could have been used in several  other scenes.  Maria,  runnig  into the court yard  knowing she is late,  was cut from this movie.  I would much rather have seen that then the over time spent with the nuns all singing and praying.

6034195,5,B00FWMVVLS,"Having seen the movie many ,many times I was very curious when it was announced it was being done again on NBC.I then learned it was the stage version they were doing, and though aw that's going to be interesting to see the differences. And it is very different. A bit darker, not as much comedy as the movie ( not sure why they added so much comedy), but still containing all those wonderful R &H songs that you just can't help but sing along to!
The play was done live which gives it a more real  feel and was pulled off without a hitch. The cast and crew should be greatly commended for that and for bringing those character to life again.
Carrie Underwood's Maria is so innocent, vulnerable, fun loving. I joy to watch. She did a great job. And she has an amazing voice, nailing song after song. The Lonely Goatherd in particular is so much fun.
Audra McDonald and Carrie bring tears during Climb Every Mountain and Laura Benanti and Christian Borle are wonderful in their roles - singing two songs not in the movie. Stephen Moyer is an aptly stern captain till his heart is melted by Maria and her music.
And the kids were all amazing! Kudos to them for doing this live 3 hour play flawlessly.

All in all this is one fun play to watch. I highly recommend it.",1387238400,2,1264,4.329113924050633
6034196,5,B00FWMVVLS,"There's a BIG difference between the movie and this live musical play, While the movie is great entertainment and had advantages in adding peripheral ++ like incredibly beautiful scenery and time to edit and make it perfect. Julie Andrews was delightful and I loved hearing her sing the wonderful songs. This musical play gave me a different view of the story and three very heartfelt scenes that made me cry where the movie never brought me to tears at all. It made the relationship between Mother Abbess and Maria much deeper and when they sing My Favorite Things Together- it's childhood delight so later on in another scene when Maria cried and begged the Rev Mother not to send her back to the Captain, it was very emotional when Audra sings Climb Every Mountain magnificently to her - I just sobbed with tears. Extraordinary scene with top notch acting from both Carrie Underwood and Audra McDonald. The second scene was the one where Maria gets tearful as she tells the Captain he is neglecting his children - Maria having lost her parents and being sent to the Abbey at a young age felt the pain of the children and here the Captain was still alive!! I was brought to tears at her acting there. The Nazi occupation was oppressively felt in this play which made the ending scene that much more powerful seeing the children flee at night away from their home forever ,I was brought to tears again. Each version has alot to offer - I also felt the children were outstanding- the casting remarkable as they did seem to be a family and Max and Elsa singing two extra songs together rounded out their characters and allowing one to know them better. Great singing and acting all around. Bravo to all involved! I wish those taking the time to come here and give it 1 star would open their hearts and minds and realize this musical isn't a threat to the legend that is the movie - or maybe they think so, why else would they take the time?",1387238400,5,1939,4.527065527065527
6034197,4,B00FWMVVLS,"When it comes to the acting and sound quality of the show, I wasn't in awe. The technical glitches, lighting, and even the queue cards were a little distracting - but I let them slide. It was fun. Carrie Underwood's acting performance, in particular, was quite charming but a little underwhelming. I'll forgive her as I know that I could not accomplish the same task.

Having said that, Carrie Underwood's singing performance was awe-inspiring. She gave a wonderful nod to the originals by staying true to their sound and tenor. But her performance, though not as iconic as the original, was mesmerizing. The soundtrack version is even more impressive. Her range and singing stamina are an absolute wonder to behold.

In my opinion, insofar as her singing career, this is Underwood's masterpiece. I don't want to overstate it; I realize this is just the Sound of Music. But new music is easy to make your own. Taking an existing, much-loved soundtrack like the Sound of Music and managing what she managed is a treat to the ears and a marvel of an accomplishment.

Personally, I hope this is the beginning of a new season of on-air musicals.

In our world, everyone has their own unrelated shows; nobody has a common thread for conversation anymore. An on-air musical is novel and magnetic. It's great for the water cooler and for families to enjoy together. The Sound of Music will need to be remastering before I'd watch it again. But I would watch it again.

6034198,4,B00FWMVVLS,"Being old enough and living in NY as a kid I remember seeing the original stage production a long time ago. Of course the movie has enshrined itself in my memory over the years. It was wonderful to hear the omitted songs between Elsa and Max (and also the captain) that really set up the dynamic between all of them. I remember finding those songs not as much fun as a kid. Christian Borle is a favorite and he was a great Max. I was doubtful about Carrie Underwood and she didn't entirely win me over. She clicked, jut not all the way.....great voice, acting????, just something. Was pleasantly surprised with Stephen Moyer he lightened up when expected more than Chris Plummer and that was more real. In the end I enjoyed it more than I thought I would, as much because it took me back to all the wonderful musicals I saw on Broadway as a kid and was not a movie remake with all the extras that a film can include. While I can't think of anyone else to cast as Maria off hand, there must be someone.....an older Lea Michele, Idina Menzel, but to pull off a live primetime musical a big name has to be attached....all in all....4 out of 5.",1387065600,,1140,4.306976744186047

Carrie Underwood gave a close singing  performance to Julie Andrews in the original 1965 version. WOW! What a singing voice. Her acting may have been a bit off, (I believe this was her first major acting part),  however, that was made up for by her singing. Can't wait to watch it again when the DVD arrives.",1387065600,6,433,4.6103896103896105
6034201,5,B00FWMVVLS,"First, to the negative reviewers -- this is a stage production based on the original stage production, not a movie or based on the movie with Julie Andrews.  There was ONE take and all the performances were live with more elaborate sets that what you find in any stage production.  Having seen hundreds of broadway productions, the acting was typical of what you find in that medium, and while Carrie Underwood may not be the finest actress to have graced the stage, she does a respectable job here and plays this role with an innocence not portrayed in the Movie version.  Overall the cast and production was very entertaining.  Those comparing her to the great Julie Andrews, well it'd be a lot easier to climb mountains, stairs, dance, jump on beds and the like while being able to overdub your music, plus be able to shoot and re-shoot scenes until the director likes the product!  Having watched this a second time I still can't believe it came out as good as it did.

Second, to anyone tired of the wasteland of TV and Movies, this is just great family entertainment and worthwhile of your support.  There is a reason why ratings were so high, people will support this kind of entertainment if presented with choice.  Carrie Underwood does a great job on the vocals, and despite her detractors she just has star quality, and the differences with the stage production make the story seem fresh again.  Audra was fabulous, and I think a new star (Ariane Rinehart, playing Liesl) may have been discovered as well.

I hope future live productions like this use a similar formula and mix in a singing star from outside the Broadway world in order to get the magnitude of audience that this production achieved.  The Broadway critics/snobs may not want this but it works.  Bravo!

As to the quality of the  DVD ordered here, once it is released I'll update if anything is above or below my expectations.  Some of the audio issues/background noise in the live broadcast will hopefully be fixed a little in the DVD and we'll see if the bonus features might include some of the behind the scenes footage, such as provided by the ""making of"" special which aired the week before the live broadcast.",1386979200,16,2193,4.674479166666667
6034202,1,B00FWMVVLS,"First I want to say that they should do more made for TV big musical productions; however maybe later they can get other people to do a better job. Well where we should start on this amateur, in parts, production.  Starting with Carrie Underwood's amateur acting which was terrible at best. Why would they put all that money into this professional production and hire an amateur ""temp"" actress. She better not give up her night job as a singer. She sang too hard and too loud. Who does she think she is Ethel Merman? She couldn't come close to  Ethel Merman with a 20 foot megaphone. Some of these songs should start softly. She was forcing the notes like an NFL quarterback can force the ball and miss his man. The musical orchestration was poorly directed. When a singer starts singing the first note the music starts jumping in at the same second, like jumping your car with the dead battery. Traditionally the music should slowly come in, for a lead in, before the actress starts singing.
There was bad casting in this play. The captain was too young and too green looking to be in command of a warship. He looks like he has no salt in his legs and would throw up the second any ship left the dock. Let's look at the Abby where the mother superior nun is a black woman. Excuse me this is Arian white Nazi Germany time in Austria. Is Hollywood trying to be too PC? Yes. Hey, I'm not even white but I want to see all whites in this musical so that at least they'll look Austrian; which took place just before WWII in that part of the world. The nuns did not sing in beautiful harmony. To be honest I stopped watching it before the second half. When you know the teams losing; why suffer anymore.

Comparing this to the Robert Wise's production with Julie Andrews, as Maria, would only insult the master. The comparison should not be uttered in the same breath. Don't waste your money. Go buy the Blu-ray of Robert Wise's production of The Sound of Music.",1386979200,6,1956,4.427777777777778

Also folks are criticizing Carrie Underwood's acting ability...give her a break!  If this were a Broadway show in NYC I believe it would have done well.  Many have suggested that bigger movie stars should have played the lead roles, but at what price? Why?  I watched this version with the mindset that I have never seen or heard of the sound of music which is why I rated it 5 stars.  If a stage performance entertains, has wonderful music, beautiful set designs and costumes then why not give it praise?  There is so much crap on television today that it is so easy to dislike more then half of what Hollywood or the major networks call entertainment.  I have the original on DVD which is a timeless classic.  We all know that the story is mostly fictional, made purely for entertainment.  So that being said enjoy this version and stop complaining about a job I believe that all involved did the best they could with the talent they have.

6034204,5,B00FWMVVLS,"This is the Broadway show version, quite different from the movie. In this review, I'm not comparing this to the movie and the incomparable Julie Andrews. The producers have done an excellent job in overcoming the challenges of doing this show live. I've watched this twice so far, and the second time was even more enjoyable than the first.

Carrie Underwood is admittedly inexperienced as an actor. However, her joyous innocence completely makes up for any shortcomings. In short, she commands the stage in every scene, and her energy and flawless singing are amazing. Moyer is certainly ""good enough"" and fills out the production well.

Aside from Underwood and Moyer, the other leads are experienced theater performers. There is definitely a contrast between them and the Underwood/Moyer pair. At times this contrast is a bit strange, but overall the show works.

Five stars for Carrie Underwwod for undertaking a challenging role in the live production, and doing it very well. Four stars for Moyer who is fine, but otherwise unremarkable. Four stars for the other experienced theater actors. Five stars for the overall production, staging, sets, and so forth. Five stars for the live production, which really was amazing.

6034206,3,B00FWMVVLS,"I've watched this performance twice - on the night it aired live and then again about a week later. Or, rather, I suppose it would be more accurate to say I watched about 1 and a half performances. I came in midway through the live broadcast, during Laura and Christian's first number (How Can Love Survive). They were fantastic - their mannerisms were natural, they were listening to each other even while they were singing, they were playing off each other beautifully. They were playing off Stephen beautifully. Stephen was over acting just a touch, but nothing unforgivable.
But then came Carrie...I really wanted to like her. But compared to what I had just seen, there was no way I could. Her acting was just...not good. It wasn't awful. But there were no layers to her performance. The goal of modern acting is to behave truthfully under imaginary circumstances (to quote Meisner). Just like in real life, when you interact with someone you have other things coloring the words you're saying - are you impatient bc you're hungry? Are you excited because you're going out on a date in 20 min? Without those things woven into a performance, the performance will be flat. Which is what hers was. Also, she wasn't truly listening to her fellow actors.

That said, I don't blame her for any of that. She's a very new actor. There's no way that she could be expected to hold her own with seasoned Broadway professionals. It was unfair, in my opinion, to put her in the situation so under-prepared. They should have had her take acting lessons for a year and then put the production on next Christmas. It wouldn't have eliminated the divide, but it would have leveled the playing field somewhat.
Carrie did what she was paid to do, though. She brought in the viewers. Her singing was gorgeous, as expected (though I would have loved to have seen her NOT belt all of the songs), and her scenes with the children were better than her others. The supporting cast was amazing. Audra was spectacular. The sets were beautiful. It's a shame they were only used once.

Overall, it's not a bad performance. I don't regret watching it - and the second time through was much more enjoyable than the first, once I knew what to expect.",1386892800,,2222,4.665816326530612
6034207,4,B00FWMVVLS,"To doubters or skeptics, before watching this, do NOT try to compare it to the movie: It is not the movie, nor is it trying to be. It is a live play, not a studio production with multiple takes to perfect. Ms. Underwood and the actors were NOT trying to be/copy/imitate Julie Andrews and the original cast, but putting their own take/spin on the characters.

That being said, I found the production charming, fun, and was smiling throughout the whole time I was watching. The acting was a little wooden to start (particularly from Mr. Moyer as Capt. Von Trapp) but I would attribute it to nervousness at doing this live + the enormity of what they are trying to attempt. However, as the play progressed  you can clearly see everyone become more comfortable, settle down into their roles and deliver wonderful performances.

I must highlight that Ms. Underwood's singing was nothing short of... AMAZING. Very well suited - perhaps more suited - to classical hits like this rather than the pop-music we hear today. After watching this I have little doubt her voice is one of the best in current music. And although her acting inexperience showed, she managed to capture brilliantly one aspect of Julie Andrews in the original: You can't help but love her and want to root for her character in the play.

Overall, well recommended to original SoM fans. Newcomers I would recommend watching the original film first before watching this charming and worthy homage to the original play and film.",1386892800,6,1489,4.8046875

I have to agree with some of the reviews that the quality of this is equivalent to a day time soap opera, or a B movie at best. It's a total fail. Stephen Moyer was giving his best vampire like performance (no pun intended). His acting was as good as a cinder block, and his singing... what?! You call that singing? Carrie Underwood was not much better. She could carry a note or two but her acting was comparable to Stephen. She basically over-sings every song, which is a pity because the songs are supposed to be light and fun. The added new songs were all disjointed mess and didn't enrich the story or the original repertoire.",1386892800,6,689,4.433070866141732

Carrie Underwood is pretty, and sings well, but is NOT an actress. That was very apparent. There were a lot of awkward pauses between dialogue with a weird microphone hiss in the background. Also, Carrie Underwood seemed like she was the only actor with an American accent. Maybe not, but it was super obvious since she was the lead actor. Couldn't she at least try to sound a little European? I understand this was a huge NBC event filmed live, but it just could have been so much better with a more experienced cast. I also don't understand why her picture on the cover of the DVD is so freakishly photoshopped. She's naturally beautiful and she looks like plastic on the cover. Why NBC?

It may not be the true story of the Trapp Family but that is typical of  Hollywood. More fiction than fact. I would have preferred  to see the family leaving Austria by train  rather that  walking over the hills to freedom. They  actually  left by train in real life.

6034215,3,B00FWMVVLS,"I admire NBC and the show's producers for attempting this kind of programming. The network accomplished what it wanted -- appointment television that made me want to watch it live and not just record it to watch later. I hope that night's ratings will compel the networks to try more of this type of classy and family programming.

The show, overall, was pretty good. The staging, the sets and costumes were quite nice and I thought that the choreography was clever, considering the small space they had to work with. The supporting cast were all fantastic, from Frau Schrader and The Mother Abbess to all the children (particularly the actress who played Liesl).

If I could, I would give this show 3.5 stars. I wish I could give it 4 stars but I cannot ignore the lead actors' performances. I am a fan of Carrie Underwood's music and she sang beautifully in her role as Maria. It is not easy to remember her lines, the lyrics to all the songs and do all that choreography in front of a camera for millions of viewers and she successfully did it all. However, her lack of experience in acting was pretty obvious, especially next to seasoned Broadway actors. She didn't act terribly but since she was the pivotal character of this musical, it was essential to emote and bring us, as the audience, with her throughout the story. Her voice was flat and therefore, she sounded bored. I thought Stephen Moyer as the Captain did well, under the circumstances. I didn't know he could sing and that was a pleasant surprise but it sounded like he was trying too hard and therefore, he lacked the subtle transition from coldness to tenderness.

Ultimately, what was missing entirely was the chemistry between Maria and Captain von Trapp. The chemistry is the reason the whole story took place; a young nun initiate falls in love with a man who thought he lost love.

Carrie looked cute of course and she is a good singer. Sounded good mostly except on  the song that opens the show ""The Sound of Music"" for which she simply does not have the voice.  She had to sing it in a lower key which ruined it and there was simply no emotion in it.  I'm telling you when Julie Andrews spun around on that mountain top and started singing that song the hair stood up on the back of my neck. Not so with Underwood.  Why on earth did they surround her with nuns with magnificent voices so that she just sounded worse. Unfortunately, she is a terrible actress.  Every scene she was in was like a high school show with,of course, an  amateur.  And, why did they do l0 versions of ""My Favorite Things"" right at the start of the show when that song is supposed to come much later when she is actually with the children.  The same song just went on endlessly.  And went on through the show so that it seemed like ""My Favorite Things"" was the title of the show. Whose idea was it to do this live anyway.  It just looked stiff and fake.  And, couldn't they have found cuter kids especially for the youngest girl.  The whole thing was just awful.

6034218,2,B00FWMVVLS,"""The hills are alive..."" After failing to really fit in at the Abbey, Maria (Underwood) is sent off to become governess to the children of a widow (Moyer) and his many children. She finds a strict run household and tries to transform the children and their father with the power of song. I'll skip most of what I would normally say because the original is a classic and needs to explanation of the plot and story. On the other hand because this is such a classic it is a hard movie to remake and will no doubt be hit with criticisms. The only problem is all the critiques of this are misplaced. 90% of what people didn't like (most before they saw it) was the casting choice of Carrie Underwood. This blind hatred took away from the real problem with the remake, the fact that the story had no flow, no character development and none of the feeling and excitement of the original. Without trying to give too much away...the songs are moved all around and they don't fit in the new places. To get Maria to feel comfortable about leaving, her and the Reverend Mother sing ""My Favorite Things""...the same reverend mother who is against her singing in the original. Because this song is used ""The Lonely Goat-herder"" is used to calm the children down in the thunderstorm. One final travesty is 5 minutes after she shows up and meets the kids they sing ""Do-Re-Mi"". This movement of the songs affects the power of the ""My Favorite Things"" song as it is supposed to finally bond the children to her. Captain Von Trapp is also singing a lot in the movie which is something he forbade. I could go on and on about this because I not only loved but grew up on the original but I will just say the reason why this shouldn't have been remade has nothing to do with the casting. In order to really fully understand the story you have to have seen the original, but by watching that you will again see how bad this version was. Overall, all the power and emotion of the original is lost in this version due to the song placement...not the casting. I give this a C.",1386633600,2,2049,4.394736842105263

To those who want to compare it to the movie (produced over long months with retake after retake and rewrite and changes from the Play on Broadway which came well before it), you deserve no credit for not knowing (caring) that  this was the re-presenting of the play - some of  the songs that were in different places than in the movie are where they were IN THE PLAY - which makes perfectly good sense if you noticed there were an number of lines, songs even situations that were different between play and moviel  Get over it.

6034221,4,B00FWMVVLS,"#1  Carrie (30) is older than Julie Andrews was (28) when she filmed the movie and she looks younger, like the age of the real Maria when she married Georg Von Trapp (24)

#2 She does a very good job of toning down her Oklahoma accent keeping it a general American dialect in tune with her fellow performers. OMG no German accents? No matter. They each behave according to their stations in life. Maria is an innocent girl while Elsa is a wealthy socialite, Max is an ambitious businessman, Geog is a wealthy aristocrat and Mother Abbess is the head nun. Its about ATTITUDE not accent.

#3 She acts like the sets are real which of course they are not. Her acting may not be at the same level as Laura Bennanti or Audra MacDonald but after all she is a ""novice"" when it comes to acting and she plays a novice so it makes a lot of sense. Anyway why should we expect the sets to appear real when this is theater, not a movie. In fact between the accents and the look of the set, the whole story could have been set in Vermont rather than Austria but so what? This is an American musical and again this is THEATER, NOT A MOVIE.  Still I was impressed with how they opened up the sets for television especially Nonnberg Abbey and the Von Trapp mansion for ""Do Re Mi""

#4 Carrie does an excellent job singing considering her repertoire is mainly country music. I especially enjoyed ""The Lonely Goatherd"" which is my favorite song from the score keeping in tune with the folk music the actual Trapp  Family Singers performed back in the day. Plus she has lots of fun with the children in the cast. I hope Carrie attempts more show music because she has a good ear and tonality for it.

#5 Carrie pulls off the innocent Maria at the beginning with her ""Heidi braids"" and again pulls off the mature Maria in the second half. Of course she seems to emulate Elsa but how else is she supposed to win her man but look like a fashion plate of the 1930's? And as far as chemistry with her leading man the script does not allow for much except for one kiss which works for me.  At least ""Something Good"" is in this production because the original ""An Ordinary Couple"" is arguably the worst song written by Rogers and Hammerstein. Also the script requires Georg to behave very stiff, even in scenes with Elsa so no time really for any sexual chemistry. The movie did allow for more making out for Maria and Georg but then again it is 30 minutes longer than the 130 minutes of this production. A plus for this DVD is watching this without all the commercial interruptions because the stop-start pacing made the story feels rushed. But sitting for a little over two hours without the breaks is easier for than the almost three hours of the 1965 movie. Plus it makes more sense for a theatrical production.

#6 She is NEVER out of tune. Never a bad note the entire performance. Which is saying a lot since there were a few on American Idol.  She never could have accomplished this when she started. She has really come a long way. I look forward to more live theater productions starring Carrie Underwood!",1386547200,40,3085,4.396491228070175

NBC must have paid amazon users to rate this highly, as I can't believe the high praise I've read in previous posts.

Even Hoda and Kathie Lee talked up the live musical on their Thursday show, the day of the live musical on NBC, before it aired.

6034226,4,B00FWMVVLS,"Very enjoyable production, following the original stage presentation as opposed to the theatrical release.  Those only familiar with the latter may have been disappointed by the limitations imposed on this live, single-pass showing.  NBC is to be commended on this risk, presenting a live play like this for the first time in +50 years.  Carrie Underwood held up her end with the singing, and the rest of the cast performed well also.",1386547200,4,434,5.0
6034227,4,B00FWMVVLS,"Firstly I understand this was based on the stage version, not the film. But it's still somewhat difficult for me having grown up watching the film. I've heard Mary Martin's recordings as Maria and as talented as she is, Julie Andrews is Maria for me. Likewise The Sound of Music is sweeping vistas, stunning views of the Alps and the grandeur of the Von Trapp estate.

But I tried to come to this with an open mind. After all, this was the first time in 50 years that a musical was produced live for television. I am grateful to NBC for taking a huge risk in airing that. I understand that they could not have done that without a big name star in the lead. Enter Carrie Underwood. Underwood sang it a la Mary Martin, not Julie Andrews (as I said I prefer Andrews) but her voice lacked the warmth of Martin. Not that it was terrible. I was impressed that she managed to tone down her twang and cut down on some her pop-isms. But the biggest problem is that she can't act. For the entire first act (up to ""Climb Ev'ry Mountain"") she was visibly nervous. I can excuse that for the first 20-30 minutes. If she had eased into her performance at that point I wouldn't have held it against her at all. But it lasted nearly 2 hours before she eased into it. I noticed her look directly into the camera at several points early on. When she sang ""Do-Re-Mi"" she was huffing and puffing so much she sounded like she'd run a marathon. I wasn't sure if she'd hit the final note and when she did there  was a look of visible relief on her face. Her most comfortable number was definitely ""The Lonely Goatherd"". She actually looked like she was having fun! Still the singing wasn't my biggest problems with her. In terms of creating a character; well, she didn't. She read her lines with the inflection that had clearly been coached. She was missing the joie de vivre of the character, and there was no journey from willful stubborn girl, to strong woman.

I've seen a lot of people bashing Stephen Moyer's performance; basically saying that he appeared, stiff, cold, and one note. Um, isn't that what Captain Von Trap is? The difference is that when he's paired with a lively, charismatic Maria they play off one another in a fun way.  When his Maria  is stiff and wooden that dynamic is impossible. I see the fault more on her part than his. Maybe ""fault"" is the wrong word. She was an inexperienced actress in a role that demanded more than she was able to give (though her attempt was sincere and brave). But just because Moyer is the more experienced actor doesn't make the lack of chemistry his fault. As for his singing, I thought he had a nice voice. Not the strongest in the world, but then the guy.who dubbed Christopher Plummer didn't have the strongest voice either;. And I think that Moyer was responsible for two of the more emotionally resonant moments in the piece. The first was when he hears the children singing the reprise of the title song, looks at them, realizes that he doesn't know them at all, so looks at the Alps that are so familiar to him, and begins to join in their song and finally embracing them. The other was during ""Edelweiss"" when he started playing the song on the guitar (which looked like he was doing for real...)  and singing, and then became overcome with emotion and got choked up. Maria then comes in and joins him and he visibly takes strength from her presence beside him and nails the end of the song

Moyer's other strong work came in his scenes with Max (Christian Borle) and Elsa (Laura Benanti).  Borle and Benanti are stage veterans (Benanti actually played Maria in the 1999 Broadway Revival of the show) and it shows. Their two songs (cut from the film) ""How Can Love Survive"" and ""No Way To Stop It""  were comic relief highlights. The first is a duet between Elsa and Max and the second is a trio in which the Captain is included as well. Working alongside these pros elevates Moyer's performance to the level it could have been through out if he'd been given a strong costar. In ""No Way To Stop It"" there's a great moment where the Captain and Elsa realizes how poorly suited they really are. They end the song singing the same thing in the same place but miles apart. I found Borle's Max less fun than what I'm used to. He seemed more opportunistic and calculating. In contrast I found Benanti's Elsa to be far more sympathetic as Elsa than the ice queen portrayal that I'm used to. In spite of her ""me first"" attitude I felt bad for her when she realized that the engagement to the Captain wasn't going to go anywhere.

However the award for the evening goes to Audra McDonald. She opens the show with a prelude (as opposed to Maria twirling around the hills like in the movie) alongside the other nuns (all stage vets including Christiane Noll, Nikki Renee Daniels, Elena Shaddow- who recently played Maria at the Papermill Playhouse, Ashley Brown- who played Maria at The Muny in 2010, Gina Farrell- who placed one of the nuns in the 99 Revival, and more; virtually all of whom have Broadway and operatic credits) and she sounds absolutely divine. Unfortunately the move to Carrie Underwood's title song is a bit of a let down after that.  I prefer ""My Favorite Things"" as a song Maria sings with the children- it makes more sense in that context. But Audra sounds so pretty singing it that I don't mind at all that it doesn't make a great deal of dramatic sense for it to be done that way (I feel that moving it was an improvement on the part of the film). However it is her ""Climb Ev'ry Mountain"" that is the high point of the broadcast. That's the point where even Carrie Underwood shows what appears to be some genuine emotion. Not only does she have a great voice, she's always an interesting, charismatic performer who never skips the character work in favor of the vocals.

Overall this was not a perfect broadcast. It had a miscast leading lady, and a general ""made for television"" feeling. There were some technical problems such as poor sound mixing at times, and occasionally an audible hiss.  However,  I think that for the first time doing this in 50 years the network needed both a well known title and a big national star as a leading lady. I applaud the effort put forth from everyone involved and especially appreciate the successful elements. But since it got great ratings, hopefully NBC will do this again. When they do, I think it might be wise to do a musical with name recognition (maybe a ""name"" actor/actress who can sing rather than a singer who can't act) in the lead, but a less iconic film version. For example Brigadoon and Camelot are family friendly musicals with flawed film adaptations that aren't nearly as ingrained in popular culture as The Sound of Music.",1386547200,3,6739,4.504091653027824

Many people are complaining about Carrie Underwood's acting. I think they are really just comparing her to Julie Andrews because I don't think it was that bad. I think the guy who played Georg was worse. I didn't think his character was very likable and he couldn't sing that well. Carrie Underwood proved she can sing just as well as any Broadway singer. There were moments where she showed emotion, even tears, and they were all performing live so I have to give them all props for that. I still like the Julie Andrew's version the best, but I think the vitriol that Underwood has received since tackling this role is messed up!",1386460800,4,953,4.578947368421052
6034232,2,B00FWMVVLS,"I watched with a mixture of equal parts incredulity, fascination and horror, all mixed with a bit of sentimental forgiveness. There's no getting around the fact that Carrie Underwood cannot act.  Dreadful doesn't begin to describe the awkward, clipped delivery of Frau Maria's lines, which, to begin with, are hardly Ibsen, Shakespeare or Moss Hart. With a pleasant, beautiful voice, she was obviously not coached in the correct style for this type of music, chopping off words, forgoing portamento in favor of a sterile crispness that stripped most of the songs of sentimentality which, in order to work,, these songs absolutely demand.

Frequently looking nervous, she appeared to be cribbing cues or lines from teleprompters or cue cards at angles uncomfortably placed for so tiny a creature (particularly when precariously perched on heels inconceivable for a recent former postulate gone wild.  Her opening number was similarly clipped and one could almost hear the voice in her head saying, ""Go here. Stand there. Turn right. Hug the tree.""

Watching Underwood play against stage pros like Benanti and McDonald felt like cruel and unusual punishment for all parties concerned, particularly the audience . . . or at least this audience.

Nonetheless, I enjoyed the presentation and applaud NBC's efforts for undertaking a monumental project and doing it all (sort of) live. The sets looked terrificly lavish so there's that, but throughout there was a loud ""quiet"" whoosh during the non-musical portions which instead of being able to ignore grew increasingly more irritating.  I'm certain this will be cleaned up before the DVD release.  I look forward to NBC's upcoming presentation of Mame: Live! starring Celine Dion, Miley Cyrus, Johnny Depp and Justin Bieber as Patrick.",1386460800,5,1781,5.27208480565371

6034235,2,B00FWMVVLS,"To show I am not a ""hater"" or that I live to be snarky, I want to state at the start that there are reasons to celebrate the recent ""live"" production of The sound of Music. The first reason is that it was done in the first place, giving people who never get to the theatre a chance to see what basically amounts to the stage version of this classic musical for themselves. Secondly, NBC was gracious enough to cast many Broadway veterans in supporting roles, and they give splendid performances. Much mention has been made here of Audra McDonald's turn as the Reverend Mother, and she deserves all the accolades. So does Laura Benanti as Elsa Schrader; she was warm and funny and made us understand why she might have captured Von Trapp's interest, if not his heart. Kristine Nielsen, whom I had the pleasure of seeing onstage in Vanya & Sonya & Masha & Spike, (she was hysterical as Sonia) played the housekeeper with pleasing restraint. And while Christian Borle seemed too young for Max, he brought much-needed humor to the festivities. I even got to see one of my favorite singers, Christianne Noll, in a rare television appearance as Sister Margaretta!

That said, I would not recommend buying this DVD, and the main reason would be Carrie Underwood. Now people are being harshly criticized for harshly criticizing Ms. Underwood; she, herself, has said of her critics that they need to bring Jesus into their hearts. Without meaning any unkindness, it becomes clear from the first moments she appears on the screen that Ms. Underwood cannot act. And since Maria carries this show for beginning to end, I deem it important that Maria should be able to successfully interpret the lines as well as the songs. In a weird way, the presence of strong Broadway performers becomes something of a detriment here as we compare their work side by side with Ms. Underwood's flat interpretation of lines. I also wasn't a fan of Steven Moyer's brooding Captain Von Trapp. He played it too harshly, and he had no singing voice to fall back on.

Fans of Carrie Underwood might be better off purchasing the CD. And you might also try and understand that many of us appreciate musicals for their libretto as well as their score. We look to directors to cast performers who can successfully bring off all aspects of a performance. Cable TV is not cheap, and we invested three hours of our lives in this production. I think that entitles us to a Maria of substance and not to an experiment in stunt casting. However, I still give kudos to NBC for trying this. I've heard the ratings were a lot better than the reviews, so perhaps other classic musicals might be in the offing. I'll just have to keep my fingers crossed that the next attempt will be cast more appropriately.",1386460800,18,2758,4.661190965092403
6034236,5,B00FWMVVLS,"It's been 3 days since this aired live & I'm still trying to figure out why there is so much hateful negativity from a few people over this production.

I think Carrie Underwood did an exceptional job! What she may have lacked in acting experience, she more than made up for when she sang. And boy did she sing!  I loved seeing her & I loved seeing the whole thing unfold. She was genuinely brave to step out of her comfort zone to take a risk on something she had to have known she would be chastised for either way!

I've seen so many ugly comments about the kids, the set, the Captain, the ""Black Nun"" (are you kidding me?!), the order of the songs, a missing gazebo, and of course, Carrie Underwood. You could see the heart & hard work that went into this to bring it to TV and I'm disappointed to now see some people taking the criticism to a dangerous low. If you didn't like it, fine. But you don't have to stoop to a pitiful low to try and get your point across and it certainly isn't a contest to see who can be the snarkiest.

It is what it is and it is a musical that was meant to be entertaining, fun, and different. It wasn't meant to replace the original or Julie Andrews, wasn't made to personally offend anyone, and it wasn't made for us ""fans"" to purposely try and tear down all that heart and hard work that went into making it.

Yeah, it had its quirks but that's what made it so great to watch! It was fresh and live and exciting to see, and I, for one, totally enjoyed the heck out of it and I think they all, especially Carrie, did an absolutely excellent job!",1386460800,17,1582,4.1568627450980395
6034237,5,B00FWMVVLS,"How dare they? I, along with my 9-year old son (along with a lot of other folks) are so thankful that NBC dared to present this production. Finally, we were able to sit down and watch TV together at a time formerly known as ""Family Hour"" on network television (that is now a vast wasteland of violence, adult themes, and demoralizing raunchiness). We were not disappointed by this production. Unlike others, we did not watch it to compare it to other productions (movies or Broadway). We watched it to be entertained by a wholesome family show. We were thoroughly entertained. In fact, my son's eager to watch again. Hence, I've placed my order ASAP.
I'm glad Carrie Underwood took up the challenge to do this three-hour long production. Being that this is a musical, that seems to have been the main reason casting her. She's got a really sweet tone to her voice -- that along, with her sweet Christian ""girl-next-door"" image. Had the amount of viewers tuned in had it been some unknown or another Broadway star? I doubt it. Sure, she's not a seasoned actress like Mary Martin and Julie Andrews, but she was able to deliver her own sweetness to Maria. And to do it in a live 3-hour show without once flubbing a line, singing off-key (especially while dancing or jumping around), or tripping on the stairs or falling into the water is quite commendable.

One thing puzzles me though. I decided to buy the CD soundtrack, but Carrie is only listed as performing the title song. The other ""Maria"" songs are performed by someone named Grace Rundhaug. What's up with that?",1386374400,,476,4.666666666666667
6034239,5,B00FWMVVLS,"Let's cut to Carrie Underwood's acting -- not the best.  But NOT BAD, either.  In fact, it was a superb, nearly monumental effort for this young star making her acting debut.  And this wasn't just an acting debut, it was LIVE in front of the entire nation (biggest Thursday night NBC audience in several years).  Anyone, therefore, who compares this lovely production unfavorably to the movie is suffering from poor reality testing.  Since this version debuted, I've watched the incomparable Julie Andrews, and Carrie's singing compares very well with it, including the incredible three octave jump on the high note at the end of ""Do Re Mi.""  It turns out that it's so difficult to achieve that it wasn't written into the movie score; rather Julie Andrews told Robert Wise she could do it, and he allowed her to improvise it.  Carrie Underwood therefore sort of had to match it, and she did!
You can coach the acting, but a set of pipes like that just doesn't come along very often, and almost never is it packaged as nicely as Miss Underwood manages.  Without her ""star power,"" the whole project probably could not have found backing, and I'm not sure who else could have done it.  Perhaps Anne Hatheway or Amy Adams might have pulled it off, but I think they would have been budget busters.
This is a reproduction of the stage version, including the Rogers and Hammerstein songs that were omitted from the movie and without ""I Have Confidence in Me,"" which was written for the movie.  Compare this production, therefore, to the stage play from the 1950s, and you'll find that it acquits itself marvelously well.",1386374400,6,1613,4.749103942652329
6034240,5,B00FWMVVLS,"I was worried about Ms. Underwood doing the role. Diction when she sings her usual rep is only so-so. BUT in this TV production she was marvelous. I also thought her acting was good, too. She was delightfully animated with the children and the scenes with von Trapp were good. She did not milk the drama, true, and she wasn't as ""natural"" as Julie Andrews. But this was not the movie, it was a staged play, something that hasn't hit TV live in WAY too long. (I must point out that Mary Martin was a wonderful actress, but none of us have really seen her do any of the role.) Captain von Trapp (sorry, I don't remember many names) was actually very good. His voice is a bit dry - lacking in vibrato - but he was convincing as an actor, and his singing was way above Theodore Bikel or whoever dubbed Christopher Plummer. The actor for Max (straight from Smash) was very good. He did not play lines for laughs at all. The children were amazing, but for more reasons than given in other reviews. Did anyone notice they actually looked a little like the Captain? and they could believably be brothers and sisters. Audra McDonald was wonderful. Don't I have quibbles? Yes, the opening chant should have had less vibrato. Chapel choirs don't sing with that much vibrato. Listen to the original cast album (not the movie) and you'll hear it. (The original chorus had Tatiana Troyanos - later of the Metropolitan Opera, Patricia Brooks - later of NYC opera, and Joey Heatherton. Wow.)
The stage production of course could not give the sweeping vistas of the Alps, but the stage version pays more attention to the coming Anschluss. The tension is palpable, even in ""light"" hearted songs like ""No way to stop it."" (which was not in the film.  There was some editing of music: a little more for Maria as she goes to the von Trapp house, and more for the Captain to sing (maybe because he could.)

The rest of the vocals were OK.",1386374400,10,357,4.268656716417911
6034245,5,B00FWMVVLS,"I was giddy about watching this after I saw the ""Making of it"" a week prior to the Live Event.

While not perfect, I was SO impressed with this production.

Carrie Underwood sounded amazing....while it's clear she's not a seasoned actress, she was still able to pull it off.
On the other hand, Stephen Moyer is clearly not a seasoned singer, but he is an amazing actor, and he completely pulled it off.
Audra McDonald was simply spectacular as Mother Abbess....pure perfection.

My mother was pregnant with me when she first saw the movie....so I was raised on the music from this show.  I remember being a child and dancing around the living room singing songs with the record.  The music is infectious.

I found the entire production simply delightful....and, yes, certain scenes even brought me (and my best friend) to tears.  Especially the ""Climb Every Mountain"" number.  Wow, just wow.

Ordered the DVD today.  I'm hoping the sound quality of the DVD is better than the broadcast quality.  At times the orchestra was too loud and the singing seemed muffled.

Regardless, I thoroughly enjoyed this production, and I am excited to add it to my library.",1386374400,7,1156,4.812182741116751
6034246,1,B00FWMVVLS,Carrie has a nice voice but is not an actor. With years of practice that could change. Doing a live performance was a huge mistake. If the cast had been doing their performances in front of a live audience for a year or two maybe it would have worked some. The movie with Julie Andrews and Christopher Plummer was so spectacular why would anyone dare mess with perfection.,1386374400,9,372,4.485294117647059

6034248,5,B00FWMVVLS,"Ms. Underwood is not Julie Andrews.  So there is no reason to compare but having her play the role, sing and act in a live performance is a feat by itself. She is a singer first and foremost and critics would definitely bag down her acting but hey for her deduct acting, live performance, that is hard to beat.  She is not even the most prettiest actress out there but boy oh boy her being Carrie Underwood, the humble country singer who won American Idol will just make you appreciate her more and more.",1386288000,7,504,4.351063829787234
6034249,5,B00FWMVVLS,"To all the nay-sayers, The Sound of Music was the very first movie I ever went to as a kid. Since that time when I was 8, I have seen it dozens of times. How does the movie compare to the new version of the stage-adaptation?  They are two different animals. Last night's performance was live, with some flaws. I love it!  That's why I'd much rather listen to live musical recordings. I love the subtle imperfections. Carrie Underwood is an awesome singer. Her acting leaves a bit to be desired, but how many times has she really acted?  I have to say that the 3 hours I spent watching it were the most enjoyable 3 hours in front of the boob tube in a long time. I couldn't help singing along and shedding a few tears. I just ordered 4 copies to share with my adult kids and grand kids. Plus one for me. :-)  It may not have been perfect, but it was the best TV show I have seen in a long time. Sure beats the crap that's usually on.",1386288000,9,932,4.076502732240437

6034251,4,B00FWMVVLS,"I'm not a Carrie Underwood fan.  She's probably OK, but I can't name a song she sings off the top of my head.  I am, however, a fan of The Sound of Music with Julie Andrews.  That's my dad's favorite movie - I can't count  the number of times I've watched it.

I sat down to watch this version with my kids.  I was hoping I'd get enough peace and quiet that I could kind of pay attention.  They were enthralled (ages 5, 8, & 11).  I was entertained.  I expected something on par with Donny Osmond's Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat or Hugh Jackman's Oklahoma.  The production values for this were much better than either of those.

As for comparing it with the movie, I don't think the comparison is really fair.  This is a recording of the stage musical version - the movie changed some things.  The largest of these changes, in my mind, is that we really get a better view of the political environment in this version.  We really understand why the von Trapps must leave Austria, why the Captain is struggling against Hitler's regime.  There is also one scene I found quite powerful in this version.  As Maria leaves the Abbey, she is scared to death and sings ""My Favorite Things"" to comfort herself.  It was quite moving.  That has always been my least favorite song from The Sound of Music, but it isn't my least favorite anymore.

Most of the criticism of this is geared towards Carrie's performance.  News sources are publishing the criticisms that appeared on Twitter during the live broadcast as if it were breaking news (""This just in!  People on Twitter are jerks!""  Duh).  I think she tried to play Maria as a kind of deer-in-the-headlights person - someone who is overwhelmed by what's going on around her.  Sometimes she does better than other times - hence the loss of a star.

I'll tell you this, though - if NBC makes more like this, I'll watch them and buy them.",1386288000,16,1892,4.4941176470588236
6034252,5,B00FWMVVLS,"My use of the  word  sound has two meanings.  I feel the production was  done as well as a stage  production allows.  They followed the film version as closely as was possible, with sets gliding from one to another smoothly.  For me, the outstanding performance was Audra McDonald and her magnificent voice.  The other ""sound"" that was not so pleasant was the orchestra. it was too over powering, often drowning out the singers.  But I still feel it was an evening enveloped in wonderful music  and worth seeing.",1386288000,6,512,4.715909090909091
6034253,5,B00FWMVVLS,"Considering the amount of time they had to put this production together, and the fact that it was ""live,"" I think they did a great job. Carrie, Stephen, and the children are not professional broadway actors. Watch ""The Making Of"" piece. The kids were chosen based on charisma and singing ability. There were some great broadway singers hired to fill out the cast, which was a definite plus. You have to remember that they had only a fraction of the time to prepare as they do for a movie. Often movies take years to put together. They only had a few months for this. By the time the cast was picked, and sets built...there was only a short amount of time left to perfect dance routines and musical numbers. Also, remember the director of a movie can re-film parts he's not happy with over and over 'til he or she is happy with it. A live performace doesn't have that luxury. Carrie surprised me with how well she did the numbers. Admittedly, the show is dated and corny by today's standards. But, there's nothing anyone can do about that. If you watch the whole show, and appreciate what they accomplished....I think you'll feel it was worthwhile...",1386288000,13,1149,4.58252427184466
6034254,3,B00FWMVVLS,"I applaud the folks who made this production available on live tv! Applause for a number of things about the production. However, I could wish the director had refrained from almost constant unnecessary moving around from the players on several occasions. I would also wish they had hired sound people who would lower the level of the music when the actors were only speaking. It would also have been less irritating had they turned the recorded sound track off or turned it down to SILENT while actors were only speaking. Can't imagine anyone enjoying listening to the hiss while trying to follow the dialog. Miss Underwood may be hot stuff in her genre, but in typical country fashion she rides her larynx and produces a harsh sound much of the time. Additionally, she couldn't act her way out of a wet paper bag! The other players were adequate, except for the children. The children were remarkable! They learned their songs and sang them beautifully! They learned their choreography and performed it beautifully! As I understand it, they carefully chose ordinary school children and taught them all they had to do, live, in the allotted time. Whoever is responsible for that training deserves an award. Not a well done, but a damned well done!",1386288000,2,1248,4.863849765258216
6034255,4,B00FWMVVLS,"Overall I would rate it 4-1/2 stars out of 5. The only negative was Carrie Underwood, she didn't have the voice for the part and can't act and didn't show any life. She appeared to sleep-walk through the show with the same blank look on her face. At times it appeared as if she was reading from a teleprompter. The only reason she got the part was for her name. The rest of the cast, including the children, were good.

A lot of people have been comparing it to the movie which should not be done. We have seen numerous professional stage versions of The Sound of Music which starred all sort of actresses, including Debbie Boone of all people and they all had some good and bad points.

The show might have been better had it been performed before a live audience.",1386288000,2,765,4.3426573426573425

6034259,3,B00FWMVVLS,"I tried my best to watch this NBC production with an open mind and not with the ""Julie Andrews WAS Maria, Christopher Plummer WAS Captain von Trapp, Eleanor Parker WAS the Baroness."" mentality even though I completely adore the 1965 film and always will.

The production values and staging of the sequences were fairly good but there are two things that detracted me from fully enjoying the performance.

1. Carrie Underwood sings fairly well but her acting stinks--hardly surprising since she isn't a trained actress. She says all her lines in almost the exact same monotone cadence--mouth open, mouth shut, no inflection. Even the scene where she's supposed to be upset and having a hard time telling Reverend Mother that she's in love with the Captain she says her lines like she's sight reading the newspaper and her face is as calm, cool, collected and composed as if she's taking a walk in the park. I can imagine how much better this production would have been if Amy Adams (who gave a marvelous performance singing AND acting in Enchanted) had been cast as Maria instead.

2. The nun's choir is unforgivably coarse and unmusical and have WAAAAAAY too much vibrato which makes them sound a little off-key at times. They seem to have only two ways of singing--forte and more forte. My goodness, the soft, reverent Latin hymn at the beginning was belted out with all the subtlety and finesse of a sledgehammer.

On the other there were some fine supporting performances. Laura Benanti (Baroness Elsa) sings carefully and musically and her acting is very natural and un-self-conscious. Ditto to Christian Borle as Max. Stephen Moyer (not technically a supporting role but STILL) has the right amount of sternness and reserve to play Captain von Trapp and does a very good job making the smooth transition to a warm, gentle family man but his chemistry with Maria is basically non-existent because Carrie Underwood is just such a darn awful actress. The best singing by far was Audra McDonald as Mother Superior and Christiane Noll as Sister Margareta--her voice is so soft, light, delicate and crystal clear--heck she would have made a better Maria any day than Underwood but of course NBC had to go for a iconic household name to draw the masses to their televisions.

Taken as a whole, this isn't a bad performance of The Sound of Music but it could have been better.",1386288000,10,2373,4.834975369458128
6034260,3,B00FWMVVLS,"I wasn't expecting much from this when I heard about it. I just couldn't picture Carrie Underwood playing Maria.

That's the one I recommend, but if you're a huge Carrie fan this isn't too bad.",1386288000,7,378,4.492753623188406

6034262,2,B00FWMVVLS,"I am surprised and amused by the glowing reviews - must all be die-hard Carrie Underwood fans.  Of course her voice is great, but simply put, it is obvious Underwood needs acting classes before her next attempt at theatre, TV or film,  Audra McDonald shines.",1386288000,11,258,4.711111111111111
6034263,4,B00FWMVVLS,"This was a bold and wonderful idea ... a three hour live presentation of the Sound of Music ... with the wise move of pinning most of the casting on musical ability rather than star recognition. I really can't remember much like this being attempted since the famous Mary Martin portrayal of Peter Pan in the early 1960s!

They pulled it off. The sets were detailed and very attractive. Costume changes happened frequently, and my wife and I couldn't help but pay attention to how long the commercial breaks were and how long certain characters were off-stage for that reason. Carrie Underwood's costume change from her ""kickin' around the castle outfit"" to her wedding gown was an impressive feat! LOL There were myriad camera angle changes, including seamless changes from full body views to close ups, which meant that the actors had to be right on their marks every moment of the performance.

There were a couple of little wiggles in the dialogue ... hesitations at the most ... which lent to the charm of the production and underscored the fact that it was live. There were really no gaffes, but that possibility kept us a bit on the edge of our seats.

All the music and the singing was top notch. The performance of the orchestra was full and flawless, and reminded me in impressive fashion of the orchestra's performance in the movie. Every part was sung with vigor and most importantly ... talent.

Carrie Underwood was a touch wooden on the acting side, but that isn't her strength and it wasn't a surprise. Her performance in the songs was top notch. You wouldn't want to compare it back to back to listening to Julie Andrews, but that could be said for all but a handful of female singers all time. Her performance was quite satisfactory and detracted nothing from the show.

Stephen Moyer was asked to play the part of the stiff Captain and he played the part of the stiff Captain, at times a bit too stiffly I thought. He was at his best after the story allowed him to break down and show some personality and warmth. His singing was surprisingly strong, and most important ... on key.

Laura Benanti, who many may most readily recognize from her recent role on Royal Pains, looked stunning in the role of the Countess, and her singing was professional stage quality.

Audra McDonald as the Mother Abbess showed off the voice that has propelled her to five ... count 'em FIVE, Tony Awards. She's also an outstanding actress and showed off all of her talents in this production.

Christian Borle was solid as the promoter Max Detweiler. While he was not as smarmy as Richard Haydn in the 1965 musical, he didn't need to be. He gave the role his own personality and spirit, and made a very entertaining Max.

This production has an extra song not included in the film, probably because it could not have been successfully carried off by Haydn, Eleanor Parker, and Christopher Plummer. It was an artful song that segued from the Captain's engagement to the Countess to a break-up based on the inability to come to terms on political ideology. That transition was handled very differently in the film and I found this treatment to be more believable.

I hold back a star from the product, rather than the overall performance. Blu ray has been out a LONG time and has plenty of product penetration. Why just a DVD for this? Possibly the DVD is easier to deliver and we'll see a Blu ray sometime down the road. I hope so, as the sets, costumes and music certainly deserve the detail that Blu ray could bring us.

Highly recommended.",1386288000,17,3541,4.640575079872204
6034264,5,B00FWMVVLS,"It was bold and even risky for NBC to produce this live, three-hour version of one of the most beloved musicals of all time. I would commend the network even if the presentation were subpar. But the production was entertaining and at times enchanting, and it constituted a real gift to viewers seeking a satisfying evening-at-home theatrical experience.

I was pleased that the staging was based significantly on the original 1959 Broadway production featuring Mary Martin and Theodore Bikel. Many viewers were likely unaware that in fact, the 1965 film,  as fabulous as it was, was not really the ""original"" version. There were three songs from the Broadway version that were omitted from the film, which instead substituted several new songs that in my curmudgeonly opinion remain eminently forgettable. But ""How Can Love Survive?"" and ""No Way To Stop It"" are wonderful, clever, tuneful numbers that I confess brought tears of renewed recognition to my eyes when they were performed last night. Apparently the  third omitted song, ""An Ordinary Couple,"" has been removed from the stage version canon, so its absence is  understandable.

The Big Issue, of course, is, ""how did Carrie Underwood do?"" The woman can flat-out sing, and given the demands of live, choreographed musical performance, she did remarkably well, I think. At this point she is not strong as an actress, and though she clearly gave it her all, emotional expressiveness was lacking overall. I am appalled, however, that people have sent her negative Tweets and that some critics have panned her performance. My goodness, she is trying to follow the performances of two world-historically fantastic entertainers, Mary Martin and Julie Andrews. I think she deserves a bit of a break, and kudos to her for making the effort under such intense and critical scrutiny.

The rest of the cast ranged from serviceable to fantastic, with special kudos to Laura Benanti as Elsa, Christian Berle as Uncle Max, and Ariane Rinehart as Liesl.  I give an extended standing ovation to Audra McDonald, who virtually stole the show as the Mother Abbess.

Yes, I plan to buy the DVD when it is released, and assuming that the seemingly endless commercials will be removed from the broadcast (can I assume this?) I know it will make a wonderful addition to our library of recordings of great musicals.",1386288000,13,2350,5.038659793814433

I've seen some of the performers in person in shows in New York City and knew they would be superb.  But I was so impressed with Carrie Underwood.  She brought a certain freshness to the role.

6034268,5,B00FWMVVLS,"Its safe to say that each one of us had a conflicting opinion about this production  and thats just fine. The way I looked at this was that it was no different than going to a live Broadway production (Ive not seen this on Broadway though did catch a local production and it was fun), only you were invited to watch the story everyone knows and loves from the comfort of your own living room. That sounded heavenly. Multiple interviews of the cast revealed that their production wasn't a remake of the classic 1965 film starring Julie Andrews, instead this was an adaptation of the original stage production and as such, it was going to be its own interpretation that meant no disrespect to the movie. With its all-star cast (a country superstar, well-known television star and familiar Broadway cast), the more videos and teases that came out, I knew this was an event Id not be able to miss.

Music first; I eagerly downloaded Carrie and Companys beautiful recordings of the classic songs we all know and love for a new generation, and... Carrie commanded the songs whether it was the catchy tune, Do-Re-Me (no country twang to be heard) or My Favorite Things. Fortunately, everyone does well with the songs which is paramount and when it came to actually watching the choreographed dances on television, I think the most memorable (although Maria and the Captain's dance was... pretty) was The Lonely Goatherd. It was charismatic plus was a nice substitute to the ever-popular puppet scene from the film not to mention props to the cast for performing a difficult choreographed scene, in terms of their vocals. I was very impressed by the children also  none of them were familiar names or faces (largely this is due to the fact that for many of them, theyd not acted before), though that didn't stop them from being professionally delightful in the production. Despite this being a live production, I didn't catch on to any major flubs on anyones part, which is kind of an extraordinary feat considering the understandable nerves in doing a live production. Some of the vocalists did seem winded a time or two, yet through it all, everyone made this 3-hour televised event a night to remember.

There is heaps of criticism of NBC undertaking this and of the cast, however I have nothing of worth to complain about. This was a unique event and I for one came away a fan. Anyone who is loyal to the film will notice this production moves at a different pace (key scenes come earlier/later or relationships are formed swifter) and of course, some of the sets are limiting  the scope of each scene isn't as big (particularly noticeable in The Hills are Alive); the live airing added a ""realness"" to the story that is missing from the film. With all that out in the open, 'The Sound of Music Live!' was a jewel. Its not something Ill soon forget and cannot thank and props to the cast, crew and NBC powers that be for putting on this event; its a familiar story for a new generation to discover and the result is just lovely.",1386288000,57,3024,4.644859813084112

Most of us have only seen the movie and Julie Andrews cannot be compared with anyone. She was brilliant. But you cannot ignore this very well delivered version of the original stage play by Carrie Underwood and the rest of the cast. I absolutely enjoyed sitting in my easy chair watching a live play on TV. The sets were beautiful, the acting was very good and the music had me singing along with each song the cast members sang.

The music, song, story, scenery, and the overall presentation were excellent.  Other than News and Sports, I suspect this is the first ""live TV"" that I have seen since the 1960s.  I, for one, did not see any ""live TV issues"" ... timing was perfect with no errors ... truly professional.

Carrie Underwood was at her best ... true also for Audra McDonald (for whom, Climb Every Mountain was probably written).  And those kids ... each one cuter than the next.

Only negative ... at points there was a sound hum in the background.  A bit annoying, but not unexpected on ""live TV"".  Hopefully this will be gone on DVD Version.

6034277,5,B00FWMVVLS,"Loved it! Carrie has a wonderful voice and is just lovely. I am always amazed at the work and coordination that must take place to pull off a live 3-hour show. A 50-second scene from Limitless, starring Bradley Cooper, was shot in my office in Philadelphia a few years back and they took one day to setup and another full day to shoot the scene. They must have shot the scene 25 - 30 times to get everything they needed for a small part of the move. On live TV, they have one shot at it and while it wasn't flawless, I applaud all the preparation needed to pull off such a show. I hope those who have criticized the show realize that it isn't a movie with months of shooting and several months of additional editing and voice overs. All-in-all, I found it thoroughly enjoyable and will be pre-ordering the DVD.",1386201600,21,810,4.3355263157894735
6034278,5,B00FWMVVLS,"I fell in love with the movie as a child when it first came out. This version obviously is based more on the Broadway musical and fills in so many gaps in the story line. The music remains stellar, the cast are ALL very believable as real people of the time. Call it age (obviously I am over 50) but i rather appreciate this production in many ways so much more than the film version.

6034280,5,B00FWMVVLS,"I was pleasantly surprised with this tv production. Carrie Underwood was a surprising choice and I had my doubts but while her acting at times seemed forced, her singing was better than I expected and overall it was a wonderful experience. The entire cast was terrific, the production beautiful. The only real criticism I have? There were times when the orchestra almost completely drowned out the singers.
But this was a live performance on a massive scale we rarely see. I even felt nervous watching it.
With all the horrible reality shows saturating tv, it was a great delight to watch, hear and experience this version of The Sound of Music.
And I have to say again how impressed I was with Carrie Underwood. This was a very daring move and, to me, they pulled it off beautifully.",1386201600,84,784,4.688405797101449
6034281,5,B00FWMVVLS,"Carrie Underwood did a super job and the children were fantastic!  It was nice to see it as a play with a stage set.  As much as I like Julie Andrew and the original version, I really enjoyed the musical stage play tonight.  The soundtrack was awesome and you couldn't tell the difference from the original.  The photography was outstanding!  I think this stands right next to the original because in its own right it is new because it is a play.  Very nice!  Yes, the Sound of Music Live has brought the original back to life again!",1386201600,15,533,4.377551020408164
6034282,5,B00FWMVVLS,"The first time I saw the promo on NBC (about a month ago), I gasped, ""No! They can't redo Sound of Music!"". Fast forward 30 or so days, and I was intrigued by the prospect of a live musical.

First off, let me say that I might like this musical even more than the movie (and I LOVE the movie). The musical was fresh and interesting, but also familiar and heartwarming. The musical numbers were the same, only in different settings (save for My Favorite Things--first performed by Underwood and McDonald). At times, I couldn't hear the cast as well because of the orchestra, which was most prominent in ""Do-Re-Mi"", but the singing grew stronger as the musical progressed.

The sets were well-done, and contrary to Carrie's prediction, no one tripped on the stairs. Of course, not all settings could be remade, but I don't feel the musical suffered for that. It was a little interesting for Maria to teach the children how to sing in the mansion (not on a day trip), and not see Liesl and Rolf dancing in the gazebo. However, it was good enough for me.

Casting in this musical was something I was skeptical about at first, because I found it hard for anyone to replace the original actors and actresses. But, once I learned Audra McDonald was cast in the musical, I knew I was going to watch this event. She was wonderful as Mother Abbess, and her voice is *stunning*. Not to leave out mention of Carrie Underwood (who proved to be a pretty good Maria), and Stephen Moyer, who was one of my favorite characters in the musical. The children--though I wish some had more lines--did fantastically capturing the characters from the movie. Liesl was still Liesl, Gretl was still Gretl, and we can't forget Kurt. Overall, great job in casting.

I did notice a few mistakes, but only small ones. Overall, none too drastic that ruined the mood of a scene. There were a couple of times that I saw Kurt tap Gretl and Brigitta on the shoulder, almost to remind them of their cues, which I thought was sweet. For a three-hour live TV musical, it was practically perfect.

First believing this musical would be a bomb, I found myself captivated by the whole thing, and anxiously waiting for the commercials to end. The songs were entertaining and fun, and the freshness of the cast made me love the musical even more. 5 stars from me.",1386201600,100,2320,4.5673076923076925
6034283,5,B00FWMVVLS,When I first heard about this I was also skeptical but then I saw the making of this remake and had to change my mind.  I grew up listening to the old Mary Martin recording and have seen the  movie more times than I can remember.  I watched this with some of my other musician friends tonight on TV and we all loved it. The live performance delivered and I had waves of goosebumps throughout the night.  Audra McDonald as the Abbess was a surprise.  I had seen her on Private Practice and had no idea that she could sing like that.  Wow!,1386201600,10,537,4.165048543689321
6034284,2,B00FWMVVLS,"I really wanted to like this and reminded my family, etc to watch.  But at times Carrie Underwood sounded like she was reciting the lines by rote from a script without feeling them. The previews looked good.  But she seemed honestly too old for the role, not a young girl, a novice nun.  Her deeper voice reinforced that.

The actress who played the Baroness sang well, but her character was disconcertingly nice (so politically correct) rather than going for the evil step-mother role.  And what was that nonsense about her being a ""corporation president""?  She was a Baroness in the 1930's not a 2013 career woman. Can't they produce a story true to the times it was set in without feeling the need to revise it to the point of politically correct inanity? The story loses much of its historical punch and sense of the times it was set in when the writers do this inane rewriting.

Stephen Moyer could not sing; his acting seemed forced at times.  And the expressions on his face were more constipated than stern.  His stuttering and panic when the Admiral showed up with his commission was lame.  I was sadly disappointed in him.

Obviously a live TV production is not a movie production, but even for a TV production it was a jangling anachronistic mess.  I was looking forward to a new ""stage"" production of this classic based on a historical cusp  but then the production dumbed down the history.  Some of the costumes and hairstyles were jarringly not period.  And given this was supposed to be a story about the von Trapp family fleeing the Nazis, I found it grating and ironic that the script had to be so politically correct they refused to even say the name Hitler, in the Heil Hitler salute. To hear them repeatedly  saying just  ""Heil!"" and having the Captain snapping about people saying Heil  to him and how it offended him (without the Hitler) was just utter ludicrousness.

And while she could certainly sing, the casting of the Mother Abbess was another jarring non period note.  Her voice in dialogue was often without inflection too, as if she was reading a teleprompter rather than feeling the lines.

I thought the young actor who played Kurt was good, and the actress who played Liesel.  Also, the Dettweiler character.

But most of this production, sadly, was just weighed down by bad acting, bad singing, inconsistent production values, and changing what was meant to be a historical story to a 2013 political correctness.

But I'm going to be watching my DVD of the original Sound of Music to remove the jangling discordancies of this one from my mind.",1386201600,10,2578,4.703125

Stage adaptations can never be compared with the movie version as they are different breeds and are entirely different mediums.
I am a Julie Andrews loyalist and was skeptical, but after seeing it tonight, I am a fan of both this production and Carrie Underwood.
Of course, Audra McDonald upstages everyone with her world renowned talent. We, as television viewers are privileged to be delighted by such a performer on television.  Television entertainment of this caliber is rare. Thank you NBC.",1386201600,136,625,5.377551020408164

8618903,3,B00FWMVVLS,"When Julie Andrews was interviewed 5 years ago that Carrie Underwood is going to portray Maria Von Trapp in an NBC remake of the ""The Sound Of Music"" musical, she wished her the best considering she knows how difficult the role was for her when she did it back in 1965. Instead of a TV movie, NBC did it by having a live musical stage play. No question that that NBC avoided turning it into a TV movie considering that it will draw comparisons with the iconic 1965 film as well as that of Underwood and Andrews. While it was reported that there were 18 million people who saw this on TV,many were disappointed. Obviously, many were expecting another iconic film. Too bad that it was far from it. And that turned against the musical from the people who saw the 1965 film especially against Carrie Underwood's portrayal as well as her singing the classic songs from it. That included from a cast of the former film Kym Karath,who played Gretl Von Trapp,who stated that the role of Maria isn't right for Carrie Underwood.

But in spite of it, I still gave it an ""okay"" rating(3/5) considering that I tried not expect another iconic movie like the 1965 film which I gave a great rating(5/5).I decided not expect too much from it considering that Carrie Underwood is a non-actress unlike Julie Andrews,who just won the Oscar Best Actress Award for Mary Poppins for 1964,when he did the original film the year after. Added to that, it was obvious that Carrie would not be up to par with Julie in terms of singing as the former is a popular country singer who happens to be a throaty singer at most who probably never had vocal training unlike the latter who is formally trained to sing songs using her head tone vocals which makes Julie the better singer. Finally,the story setting was almost the same despite a few changes in the 2013 version like Maria not singing ""I Have Confidence In Me"" when she was going to the Von Trapp's home. So there is nothing much to compare.

So viewers who are able to see this musical should just enjoy it and treat it as another version that does not need to be iconic. Besides,I did appreciate Carrie Underwood's guts to portray Maria knowing that there will be comparisons between her and Andrews and her effort to make it a decent musical. Despite being a non-actress and basically a country singer, I would say that she did give her best in the musical. Doing her best was average at best and made the musical a decent enough despite the fact that she isn't at par with Andrews in both acting and singing nor was the musical at the same level with the iconic 1965 film. The same goes for the members of the cast. That's all that matters.

Viewers should just enjoy another decent version of it. Others just presented negative reviews of it because of their high expectations and for it to live up to the iconic 1965 film.",1530230400,,2854,4.505791505791506
