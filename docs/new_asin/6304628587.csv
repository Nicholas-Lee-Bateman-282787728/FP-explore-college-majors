911993,5,6304628587,"The most outstanding series of westerns began in 1935 from Paramount Pictures ""Hopalong Cassidy"", under the guiding hand of producer Harry ""Pop"" Sherman...continued well into the '40s proved to be the most successful 'B' Westerns ever made...based on Clarence E. Mulford's stories, they strived in changing Cassidy's image, which was both original and influential...the hero, played by William Lawrence Boyd, was mature and a man of his word...the plots were solid with a sudden burst of climactic action in the last reel, usually a frantic chase backed by tension-building music.

In all, Boyd made sixty-six Hopalong Cassidy Westerns, early films included Uncle Ben and Windy Halliday, both played by veteran actor George ""Gabby"" Hayes...was a steady favorite as a hitchrack, was chosen five years in succession as one of the 10 best money-making Western sidekick stars...like most western comics, had his share of narrow escapes being thrown from his horse, burned by blanks...but that was all in a days work...his one-liners will never be forgotten...""You're dern tootin'""...""Never trust a female, they're pure poyzin""...or my all-time favorite ~ ""Persnickgordy Women""...this crusty old-timer stole many a scene from John Wayne, Randolph Scott and yes even William Boyd.

William Lawrence Boyd, known as Hop-A-Long Cassidy never wears any outfit except his charactertistic black shirt, trousers, boots and Stetson...Hoppy rode, grinned and fought his way into our hearts on the silver screen and then right into our living rooms with a new inventions called...Television! ... Great Cast of Jimmy Ellison (Johnny Nelson) always hot-headed & getting into trouble...but the scene stealer is George ""Gabby"" Hayes, as the old-timer Uncle Ben, gives the a film shot in the arm with his down-to-earth humor and sentimentality, as the father figure to Hoppy the interaction with Boyd's character is pure Americana!

Must mention that it was sure good to see one of my all-time-favorite sidekicks George ""Gabby"" Hayes throw in with Hoppy ... The added special features are simply great ~ Coming Attractions:""Hopalong Cassidy:Public Hero #1"", plus a poster gallery, still gallery and my favorite is original materials from ""Merchandising King of the Cowboys"" museum exhibit. Hope ""Image Entertainment"" will keep releasing this outstanding series featuring Hopalong Cassidy in glorious black & white. I'll be standing in line for the next adventure with the Bar-20 wranglers ... William Boyd (Hopalong Cassidy), they'll never be another like him.

Hoppy's interaction with California Carlson (Andy Clyde) is always a shot in the arm with his down-to-earth humor and sentimentality, theses scenes are pure Americana! Boyd, with his silver hair, black clothes and white horse (Topper) rode into our lives and we've never been the same since...your children and grandchildren will enjoy this clean wholesome entertainment ... Hoppy always wore two silver white handle six shooters, never drank or smoked, when the good guys always won and the moral to the story was fair-play...outstanding role model...gotta love it!

Another pick for ""Pop"" Sherman was a new sidekick for the Cassidy films ... a newcomer Lucky Jenkins, played by Russell Hayden had his job cut out for him, with Boyd (as the hero) and Andy Clyde (California Carlson) for comedy, left the field of romance and action wide open, Hayden filled those ""boots"" perfectly.

William Boyd was my hero, this collection of his films are perfect, clear and give me hope for the future. Our youth should have such a hero to look up to today. Must mention the fact that I still miss one of my all-time-favorite sidekicks though, George ""Gabby"" Hayes, you're durn tootin'!

Paramount and Clarence E. Mulford's fictional western character Hopalong Cassidy comes to life through William Boyd as Hoppy and Andy Clyde as California with films from the '40s...horse operas directed by Lesley Selander and George Archainbaud...some of the best hard riding and smokin' gunplay that ever came across the big screen from the Bar 20 boys ... just the way we like 'em.",1162252800,,4100,5.317901234567901

First up ""HOPALONG CASSIDY"" (1935) (60 mins/B&W) --- our story has a range war with two ranchers against each other, while the foreman of the one ranch is behind all of the rustling ... it's up to Hoppy and Jimmy Ellison to make things right and keep peace among neighboring ranchers.

Second we have ""BAR 20 RIDES AGAIN"" (1935) (63 mins/B&W) --- our plot line has Nevada and his outlaw rustling gang taking cattle from the local ranchers ... enters Hoppy posing as a gambler who is trying to get to the bottom of this and bring the owl hoots to justice ... Nevada has this fixation that he is another Napoleon, but they can't find his hideout ... maybe a smoke signal from Hoppy would do the trick in locating Nevada's den of thieves.

911995,4,6304628587,Frontiersman was an excellent HopalongCassidy movie because children got abigger role with the message of minding and respecting your schoolteachers and teachers and adults interacting with children. Great Hoppymovie,1021334400,,216,6.482758620689655
911996,4,6304628587,"This film was the first of 66 films, between 1935-48, that William Boyd made as Hopalong Cassidy. In the heyday of the B Western no-one rode longer or straighter than Hoppy into the hearts and minds of adults and children alike. Boyd was more than an American cowboy hero he was a global hero, particularly in the 1950's when Hoppy captured a whole new juvenile audience, (on TV and radio), as well as the crooks. Originally released as Hop-A-Long Cassidy, later retitled Hopalong Cassidy Enters,the plot involves a group of rustlers fomenting trouble between Jim Meeker's H2 and the Bar 20 as a screen for their own cattle stealing activities. Tensions mount on the range until Hoppy produces the evidence of the perfidy of the outlaws and then, of course, there is the climatic gun battle between the good guys and the owlhoots. Ironically, Boyd really did have a limp during the shooting of this film, due to a riding injury, but his accident was turned to advantage with an extra scene being inserted in which Cassidy is shot in the leg during a rescue attempt. Hence, Hoppy was able to comment,""I can hop-along with the best of them."" William Boyd may have disliked horses, been a poor rider and  physically inept but he could act and his distinctive voice, laugh and stage presence turned him into an enduring star whose personal acts of kindness, particularly to children,really turned him into his character, and for over 20 years he was Hopalong Cassidy. For anyone wanting to relive the nostalgia of yesteryear or to look at the best of the old B westerns-then you start here, with the entrance of Hopalong Cassidy.",975369600,22,1625,4.782918149466192

912089,5,6304628587,"For whatever the reason, Hopalong Cassidy movies were often at least a cut above - and often several cuts above - the average westerns of their time.  I think it was just something about how Cassidy went about his business.  I'd never seen this one before and really enjoyed it, as this seems to be the jumping off point for the character.  The plot is not terribly more complex or interesting than most of its contemporaries, but ""Hopalong Cassidy Enters"" is a really fun and interesting look back in time.  I remember my Mom and Pop taking me to something at Stanford's Stadium, probably an East-West football game back in the early-mid-1950s and pointing out William Boyd, dressed as always in black, on his white horse, not knowing a thing about which they spoke, but still being impressed with the two as they rode by in a parade.",1459209600,,835,4.621621621621622

William Boyd's first film appearance was as an extra in Cecil B. DeMille's ""Old Wives For New"" (1918). He soon became a star and remained one all through the '20s. Boyd's reputation was damaged when a newspaper mistakenly placed his photo over a story on actor William 'Stage' Boyd's arrest for gambling and liquor violations. When Boyd was later offered the role of ""Hoppy"" in 1935, he decided to change the character from a gruff, hard-living cowpoke to a squeaky-clean hero who never threw the first punch.

HOPALONG CASSIDY (1935) was the first in a run of over five dozen western programmers starring Boyd and his white horse, Topper. The cast includes George Hayes (before he was called 'Gabby') and Charles Middleton, who was also famous for his portrayal of Ming the Merciless in several ""Flash Gordon"" serials.

SYNOPSIS--
Two cattlemen feud over grazing land rights. The foreman for one of them tries to start a war by having his gang rustle from both and alter their brands. During a skirmish caused by this scheme, Bill Cassidy is shot in the leg; he claims ""I can still hop along,"" and thus a western legend is born.
