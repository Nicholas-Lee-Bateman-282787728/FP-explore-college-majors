2522322,3,B000EM7R4G,"This is a somewhat odd little Pilates workout. On the one hand, it initially appears to be designed for beginners--Kathy spends several minutes reviewing basic Pilates principles prior to the start of the workout--but on the other, it seems to be more appropriate for experienced Pilates practitioners, as Kathy's instruction is not overly detailed, and some more intermediate/advanced Pilates exercises are included.

Kathy does not perform the moves herself; rather, she leads three other exercisers, one of whom shows modifications and one of whom sometimes incorporates more advanced versions. The workout begins with traditional Pilates sequencing, starting with the hundred, the roll-up, and then the roll-over, a more intermediate/advanced move. Other basic Pilates moves included are rolling like a ball, the series of five, and swimming; additional intermediate/advanced moves included hip circles, leg pull-downs, and leg pull-ups. Kathy also adds a move I've never seen before, upper body circles, but she does not do any of the side kick series. The practice ends with the mermaid stretch.

I've seen this workout reported as being both 20 mintues and 25 minutes; minus Kathy's initial instruction, I clocked it at about 22-23 minutes. If you are looking for a short, moderate-paced, basic Pilates mat workout that includes a few more challenging moves, you will probably enjoy this. However, I definitely would NOT recommend this workout for those who are brand-new to Pilates.",1142812800,10,1490,5.473913043478261
2522323,5,B000EM7R4G,"I really enjoy working out with thise Dvd set, Kathy is so good at what she does,  I had fun.  I would say that this set is for begginers to intermediate.",1370217600,,154,3.935483870967742
2522324,4,B000EM7R4G,"I usually do Jillian, Bob, Tony or Shaun when I want an a** kicking workout. But some days I take it down a notch, but still get a
really good/sweaty workout! Ms..Smith, is your girl for that workout! I think she worth the price.",1363996800,,229,4.2272727272727275
2522325,5,B000EM7R4G,Great video!  Plays perfect.  Great price! I will be buying more videos from this website in the future. I would recommend this video to anyone trying to lose weight.,1347840000,,166,4.689655172413793
2522326,5,B000EM7R4G,"I love this DVD set. It has everything you need: cardio, weight lifting, core strengthening and stretching. Great value for your money. You can start as a beginner and advance with time. Excercises accommodate for ladies who are just starting out to those who are in shape. I have successfully lost weight with this program after both of my girls. I am talking about loosing over 40 lbs each time. I am 5'9"" and 130 lbs now. And I can exercise with Project You while girls are sleeping. I love yoga and pilates workouts because it gives me a break and much needed stretching and core exercise. These workouts give me enough endurance and strenghth to run after my 3 yo and carry heavy car seat and baby on my shoulder. I don't have to leave my kids with anyone to exercise. Workouts broken into 20 and 30 min, with one long workout that is almost 60 min but even this one you can break in two if needed.",1343260800,2,903,4.349112426035503
2522327,5,B000EM7R4G,"I am in my late 60's and always looking for something that will be fun to do, but that I can do at my own pace.  Kathy Smith is always easy to follow and never dull.  This workout combines cardio and weights.  I can make the workout harder or easier just by varying my own intensity and the weights I use.  As usual her cues are excellent.  This workout would be good for anyone who has a little experience under their belts to intermediate.  More advanced people would probably find it too easy.",1331769600,2,496,4.279569892473118
2522328,4,B000EM7R4G,This is an all encompassing upper body workout.  She covers every muscle in the upper body including three sets of 50 crunches.  Recommend this wholeheartedly.!,1270598400,3,160,5.36
2522329,5,B000EM7R4G,"I really enjoy this DVD.  I ordered the whole set separately on here and got all 8 workouts for about $40.  I saved an enormouse amount of money compared to what the brand new set from Beach Body costs.

Kathy Smith is terrific, not annoying.  She will give you a tough upper body workout.  She uses high reps and you can just add more weight as you progress.  The exercises are effective.  I am in good shape, at an intermediate level and this still gave me an effective and challenging workout.

All the Project You DVD's are like this.  They are all great!",1237852800,6,559,4.349514563106796
2522330,5,B000EM7R4G,"I bought this DVD after seeing an advertisement for it on my Turbo Jam DVD.  Since I love home workouts and am always looking for something new and different, I bought this.  Like another Reviewer said, this is not the complete 8 workout set, this is just one DVD with 3 workouts.

I just got this in today and immediatly got started.  Surprisingly, I had never done a workout DVD with Kathy Smith before so I honestly did not know what to expect.  She is a really good instructor- not annoying at all.

The Cardio Portion-Fat Burning: Foundation:
Is fun.  It got my heart-rate up there.  It is a mix of basic knee lifts and similar basic moves I've done in other workout DVD's.  It also has some kickboxing basics and moves similar to those I've done in Turbo Jam.  This is no where near as fun as Turbo Jam, but is nice if I feel I need a change of pace.

The Strength: Lower Body/Abs:
I am already in good shape as I've been exercising regularly for over a year now and this was challenging- Challenging in a good way.  Some of the exercises include squats, lunges, deadlifts, leg lifts and curls which focus on the hamstrings and glutes, etc.
The DVD is good because you can modify the exercises to make it easier or harder.  You can also use no weight, light, medium, or heavy weights.  This is nice cause once this gets easier I can just add heavier weights.  The workout can progress with you.  The abs section was killer.  I really enjoyed it.  I know if I keep this up I will see more muscle tone and definition.
You will need various sized weights based on your needs, a stability ball-helpful, but not required, and a chair.

I have not done the Pilates section yet, but am looking forward to doing it on my Pilates day.  I like leaving reviews on products because this is what helps me decide if I want to buy something or not.  Unfortunetly, I am a busy mom with not much help and can't always get on the computer to leave a review.  Since I had a moment while my little one naps, I decided to leave this review.
I hope this helps.",1237766400,16,2044,4.295811518324608
2522331,5,B000EM7R4G,"I absolutely love this DVD set. It is really a great workout. There are two discs. One contains an hour combination of strength training and cardio. She works each muscle group (abs, arms, back, chest, legs, etc.) throughly, which is something I think a lot of other workout dvds lack. The other disc contains three workouts: 30 minutes of strength training for the lower body and abs. I find this is a great leg workout; 20 minutes of pilates/core for abs. This is also great and really works each part of the abdominal and also the back. Also, a 30 minute foundation, which is a cardio workout.

The DVDs also come with a diet plan. I think it was definitely worth the money. I use the DVDs a lot and they are a good mix of workouts.",1150329600,6,735,4.364963503649635
