8039051,5,B00065GVGQ,"Buy ""That's Amore"" if you want to see Dean perform. Buy this if you want a wide history of the life of this great performer. Personal interviews with Dean in later years. Footage of some of Dean's movies. Jerry Lewis, John Wayne, Montgomery Clift, Frank Sinatra, Sammy Davis, Jr., etc. A loving tribute to the ""One and Only""",1198454400,5,324,4.603448275862069
8039052,3,B00065GVGQ,"The title of this DVD says it all pallies.  Dean Martin is one of a kind.  Unfortunately the quality of this DVD does not live up to the person it is all about.  There is far too much chatter

by Dino-want-a-be ""experts,"" and far too little of Dino himself.

For me, the clip of the live interview with Dino is the most important part of the DVD.  Anything that has Dino in it is worthy of purchase, but this DVD would give us dinoholics so much

more pleasure if if were purely Dino focused.",1127260800,17,492,4.170212765957447
8039053,3,B00065GVGQ,"This is an interesting historical perspective of Dino with rather an excess of the partnership b/w footage. Whilst it is obvious that the makers have been affectionate with the material, unfortunately it seems to me, they had limited access to choice material (like his tv shows) and miniscule genuine interviews with people who actually knew him. If you want a potted history of the great entertainer, then this is ok. If you would like to experience his true genius on dvd, treat yourself to 'Thats Amore'. Hey producers!.. more tv compilations plleeease!!",1104451200,25,558,5.076086956521739
