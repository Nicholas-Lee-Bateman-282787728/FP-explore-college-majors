It tells the story of The Eastern Lowland Gorilla-- the documentary is mainly taken up with these
A short section is on another group who live in another area -- which is more rainforest type
This second group share byes with Elephants and a variety of other animals-- they seem to enjoy themselves in wading around in the water and eating tender shoot.
Mountaint Gorillas don't appear to be covered

The main story is that of one Gorilla with one breeding silver backed male Gorilla
He has a harem of several females, one of whom has just joined the group.-- she is still to produce the all important infant.
I think there are 4 females including the new arrival
Mothers watch over there young closely and only breed every 4 years ( children weaned age 3 years )
There are 6 children, the youngest 4 months
The documentary follows the family for some months-- the latest female to join is heavily pregnant but the arrival of the infant isn't shown so it is about the gestation period along that is covered.
A helpful insight into Gorillas-- I was pleased I watched it",1433721600,,1109,4.545
