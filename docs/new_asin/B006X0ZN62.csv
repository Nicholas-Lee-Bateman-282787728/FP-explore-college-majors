5028485,4,B006X0ZN62,"This film is an example of the Hollywood Machine in its heyday producing a rare ""offbeat"" attempt at everyday realism. It is an ""adult"" treatment of a common but awkward and unrespectable situation.  You can hear the studio execs screaming about how downbeat and unpleasant it was.  It very much reminded me of  MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT with Kim Novak and Fredric March.  As a result, even when such things were somehow produced, the studio did not support them with proper publicity and they would sink fast.  The fact is that this is a masterfully and imaginatively directed film with a generally good script and fine actors giving their all.  It deserves to be seen, especially by those seriously interested in Hollywood films of the period.  Viewers like Mr. One To Skip are exactly the type the execs always had in mind.  Luckily, film makers and actors felt differently and very occasionally got to pursue their vision.

Olives transfer of this film is exemplary, sharp and showing strong contrast.  It could pass as a BD.",1389139200,7,1023,4.7942857142857145
5028486,2,B006X0ZN62,"One has to commend Olive Films for releasing neglected little gems like the Stanwyck ""No Man Of Her Own"" or ""The Dark Mirror"" starring Olivia De Havilland, but this (very) minor entry by director George Stevens just didn't cut it for me. This film, ""Something To Live For"", is sandwiched between his ""A Place In The Sun"" and ""Shane"", so it comes across as a minor little something the studio tossed at him to keep him from getting bored between ""important"" gigs, so an uninterested talent made an uninteresting movie. The film, about alcoholic lovers torn between their ""illicit"" romance and duty to others, simply refuses to get up and breathe, much less walk. Everything about it seems, well, listless; I could barely keep my eyes open, and mind you I usually like the work of Stevens and Fontaine. The cast tries very hard, but they got no help from their director who seems to have been catching naps behind the camera for most of the time. Also, for a romantic film to work there has to be a modicum of chemistry between the leads which is completely absent here.

There are the usual Stevens touches, like his extended dissolves that worked so well in ""A Place In The Sun"", that simply become meaningless here. Lots of scenes were shot through curtains and shadows for no apparent reason other than being different. Maybe Stevens hated his cast. The pacing is akin to that of a tired snail that is simply not going to make it. Was Stevens trying his hand at Neo-Realism, Hollywood style? Well, there's more action in an Antonioni movie than there is here. There are also some ludicrous elements as in the choice of theater play (about ancient Egypt!) that is supposed to launch Fontaine's character into stage stardom towards the end of the plot that seem more like a send-up than a realistic, viable vehicle - one expects the ""audience"" in the movie to laugh, yet they sit through it all with a straight face. What on earth were they thinking of? She was an aspiring actress, not an aspiring Opera singer. It is truly disappointing to watch so many talented people come up with such a klutzy stinker.

For far more powerful entries about characters coping with alcoholism, try ""The Lost Weekend"", ""Smash-Up, The Story Of A Woman"", or ""I'll Cry Tomorrow.""

Two stars for the DVD transfer that presents clean, sharp images with excellent contrast and good sound, but I would only recommend it  to die-hard fans of Stevens, Fontaine, Milland or Wright, but even if your preference is romance, I would stay away from this lethal snoozer even as a rental.",1388361600,4,2557,4.700892857142857
5028487,3,B006X0ZN62,"Ray Milland and Joan Fontaine are really great actors.  I feel that Joan Fontaine is not quite convincing enough in this role as a drunk.  She is such a lady. I felt that Teresa Wright gave a more convincing and powerful performance as the wife of an advertising man who is recovering alcohol and who falls in love with an alcoholic and aspiring actress,  There are some strange and awkward scenes between the leads and segues.  One particular scene is hearing only their voices in a darkened theatre.  Or an Egyptian sculpture fading to Teresa Wright's face.",1387411200,2,559,4.721649484536083

5028489,5,B006X0ZN62,"A brand new DVD of this film will be out on March 27,2012  and I eagerly await to see it, hoping it will have a much better picture quality than the bad copy I already have. The film itself is so beautiful and so realistic, it makes you enter into the lives of the heroes and share their feelings. The inspired direction of George Stevens gives this film its quaracter, poetic and everyday life at the same time. The performances by Ray Milland and Joan Fontaine are unique, touching, humorous and tender... They match so well together, their great chemistry is apparent in every scene. Ray Milland has never shown such a vulnerability, such a need for the love of a woman as in this film, probably that's why I consider it one of my most favorites.
Not the usual Hollywood happy end for this romance, though... The end is bitter-sweet , but there is still an optimistic notion, that as long as you have the knowledge of someone out there that you love and who loves you back,  it's OK, you can go on living, and be happy with what you have, even though you are not allowed to be together.
This film has a very special place in my DVD collection and I highly recommend it.",1331510400,37,1172,4.371559633027523
8506084,2,B006X0ZN62,"I saw this film in the 50's when it came out on a double bill with another film. I can't remember if I liked it that much or not at the time. But I recently bought it because of the classic stars of Hollywood's Golden Age. Joan Fontaine, Ray Milland and Teresa Wright were all three academy award actors in a badly made film.
Today the movie comes off as rather 'soap opera-ish. And that awful background music proves my point. Victor Young's music is wonderful-but not here. It ruins the film. By today's standards the plot of two alcoholic's is terribly predictable. I thought maybe people in A.A. might enjoy this film but it is too phony and very bland. A slow moving movie also. George Steven's was a great director, but he must have been asleep 'at the wheel' here.
The subject of alcoholism is a very serious matter. Especially today now that more is known about it. Joan Fontaine looked and acted good in the role of the practicing alcoholic, but as any of us alcoholics know nobody can sober up in an hour or so before going on stage as Joan played an actress in the film. And it takes a member of the same sex to help another alcoholic in A.A. It is TOO easy to get involved with another alcoholic in a romantic involvment  . Many do but pay a dear price. A.A. is NOT a lonely hearts club. But Ray Milland's character did mention that it should be a 'woman helping another woman'.. But naughty naughty Milland's character did get in too deep and both of these characters got hurt. It does happen, but A.A. does not work that way.
Anyway I don't think this movie went anywhere. Maybe it was considered a ""B"" movie in spite of the very good actors who were in the film.
Joan Fontaine has always been one of my favorite's. Why she did this film is anybody's guess.
But as the great Alfred Hitchcogk said at one time, ""It's only a movie"".",1528416000,,1844,4.344927536231884
