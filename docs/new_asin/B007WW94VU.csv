5113723,5,B007WW94VU,This new slice of Troma sleaze is an absolutely out of hand gore fest. Excellent 70's/Grindhouse feel with all the guts you could ever want. I highly recommend this film for anyone who can appreciate the out-of-control low budget sleaze that Astron-6/Troma wear like a badge of honor!,1347148800,8,284,4.9375
5113724,5,B007WW94VU,"This film is definitely not for everyone - it's insane from start to finish. At times it seems like a horror flick before it becomes a Grindhouse styled action flick before it becomes a wild trip to hell. Full of violence and depravity, it's cult classic material.

The movie, in my opinion, was great, but this set is even better. It's presented beautifully, has four discs, includes the music from the movie, the Blu-ray, the DVD, and special features. If you're a fan of this film, this is definitively the version you want to own.",1345507200,6,534,4.621052631578947

If you love Troma and the latest grindhouse-era revival flicks (Hobo With A Shotgun etc), then this film is a must see. Everything about this release oozes retro packaging and features.

Definitely for the jaded and perverse, this is Troma's best release since Tromeo & Juliet. A must have Blu Ray for horror and exploitation fans.",1344988800,,472,4.827160493827161
5113727,5,B007WW94VU,"This is a review for the movie itself, not the actual product because, well, it's not released yet!

I saw this film a few months ago in Tampa, and it is utterly fantastic. I had recently gotten into a car accident, and had a rental car. Tampa is about a two hour drive from my house. But since the insurance was covering the milage for the car, there was NO way I was missing out on a new Troma film, seeing it on a big screen!

By now, you've read the synopsis of the film, so you know what it's all about. If you're a fan of Troma, you know what you're getting into. I saw this with a bunch of people in the screening and the dude next to me seemed to be pretty bothered by some of the stuff in this film, which makes me love it even more to tell you the truth.

The story behind this, is that Lloyd Kaufman gave Astron 6 $10,000 to make a feature length film, based on the trailer for the faux film (at the time), ""Father's Day"". This film is in now way, shape, or form, directed by Lloyd Kaufman. It's directed by Astron 6 (just to clear up any confusion). This is probably, without a doubt, my favorite ""non Lloyd"" directed Troma film. It's right up there with, ""Bloodsucking Freaks"" (my all time favorite Troma pick up), in terms of crazy moments.

One thing that I heard a lot of people comparing this to is ""Hobo with a Shotgun"". While that is an AWESOME movie, I believe that this absolutely destroys that film. There's so many references to 80s films, that I lost count. There's also an AMAZING Ray Harryhausen-esque fight towards the end of the film (that's all I'm saying about that scene. I don't want to spoil it).

I know the original release of this blu-ray had some stuff that has since been taking out. No matter. As long as the movie gets released (and not pushed back another week!), I'll be a happy camper. The fact that it's a 4 disc set makes me incredibly happy as well.

If you're a Troma film, check it out. It doesn't feel anything like what they've released...ever, yet, it feels so right!

Pre-Order now!",1339977600,10,2034,4.267532467532468

5113729,5,B007WW94VU,"Being a Troma fan isn't easy these days. With the company essentially blackballed from being on TV in any fashion, you really have to seek out Troma releases. To get one thats actually showing in a limited theatrical release is even more rare, which brings us to Father's Day. I won't bore everyone with the story of how this came about (that can easily be googled), but I will say that it gives hope that we'll see more Troma releases made by talented up and comers like Astron 6 (who also have a great DVD of their short films available from Troma and here on Amazon). The Hollywood system would never be able to give us something as wild and creative as this film is, so with that in mind I urge everyone to take a chance on this film. I really believe it will greatly exceed your expectations, as it did my own. One more thing: Astron 6 were kind enough to help me with some film making questions I had via Twitter, and I want to thank them for that. Always good to never forget to help others who are just starting out. Very classy.",1335744000,22,1037,4.269035532994923

5113731,5,B007WW94VU,"There is a father serial killer on the loose. The killer also sodomizes the victim as well as removing their manhood with his teeth. This type of killing has happened before. Ahab (Adam Brooks) whose father was killed by this man, Chris Fuchman (Mackenzie Murdock) is summoned to help go after him by a blind priest (Kevin Anderson). He is aided by a lousy Priest (Matthew Kennedy); a Billy Idol looking Twink (Conor Sweeney); and his sister (Amy Groening).  Twink is both his name and occupation.

This is a Troma style film. It is a spoof on grindhouse films and perhaps even spoofs Troma films which are spoofs themselves. The dialogue is campy and laughable. The film is on the sacrilegious side of the spectrum.

The film has names such as ""Sleazy Mary""  who runs the ""Low Life Club"" a strip joint where Ahab teams up with his sister. My has she grown. I enjoyed the silly dialogue, even the discussion of the metaphor that wasn't a metaphor.

Perv guide: F-bomb, sex, male rape, ample nudity including male full frontal which may or may not be real. I would guess this film would have less appeal than ""Toxic Avenger"" but more appeal than ""Blood Sucking Freaks.""

5113747,4,B007WW94VU,"Ahhh, Father's Day...where to begin? The violence. The butt rape. Revenge. Demons. Strippers with chainsaws. Maple syrup. Tasty berries. A sexy priest. A gay prostitute. Did I mention the stripper with the chainsaw?

Father's Day is a wild, violent, sometimes trippy, sometimes old-school, always fun little flick best viewed at night (the film even opens with a commercial telling you you're watching it late at night, a midnight movie so to speak) and with a group of friends who are ready to laugh.

Boy watches father raped and killed, gets eye cut out, grows up, wants revenge, kills wrong person, goes to prison, 10 years later is let out, seeks peace in the woods. That's only the first 5 minutes! What happens next will please fans of other Troma releases, as well as fans of ""Hobo With A Shotgun"" and ""Planet Terror"", two other films that are a little more well-known but equally as good.

The film gets even crazier when our group of heroes go to hell, literally.

Good for a few laughs and some over-the-top gore/nudity. Movie: 4/5 stars.

The blu-ray has good video quality, considering the source material was made to look like an old movie much like ""Hobo With A Shotgun"" and ""Planet Terror"". Some scenes have a lot of detail to them, while others don't. Video: 4/5 stars.

Audio is okay at best. I wasn't particularly blown away, but it serves the ""feel"" of the movie well. Audio: 3/5 stars.

There aren't any extras on this one-disk blu-ray edition, though I've heard other editions of the movie come with more disks and some extra content. I own this version, the single disk blu-ray, with only a theatrical trailer. Extras of single-disk blu-ray: 0/5 stars.

Overall: 4/5 stars. I don't find this film as memorable as some of the other crazy films I've mentioned, especially ""Planet Terror"", but its still good and provides some fun entertainment for fans of this genre. Video is good, Audio is okay. Rent it if you're not sure. Buy it if you enjoy other films in this genre.

Rating: Not Rated, likely NC-17. Language is comical, Nudity is raw and Sexual content tends to be very mature. The violence is over-the-top and extreme, but some of it can be shocking (genital mutilation, for example) and some of the violence mixes in with sexual content, making it possibly uncomfortable for some viewers.

If you're into 80s movies, you'll dig this. If you're into stoner movies, rapist movies, noir movies, priest movies, demonic movies, man hunt movies, stripper movies, movies about male prostitutes, you'll love Father's Day.",1367625600,2,469,5.090909090909091
5113750,4,B007WW94VU,"Lloyd Kaufman and Troma Entertainment, have a well deserved reputation for extreme exploitation cinema, and Father's Day (2011) is certainly not for the meek, with some extreme gore that includes dismemberment, cannibalism, and penile and eye mutilation.  Other controversial subject matter includes male rape, incest, and even an appearance by God (played by Lloyd Kaufman).  If that brief description hasn't offended your sensibilities, then proceed further at your own risk.

Known as the ""Father's Day Killer"", Chris Fuchman (Mackenzie Murdock) is a rapist and murderer whose preferred victims are men who are fathers.  The sons of two of his victims, Twink (Conor Sweeney), and Ahab (Adam Brooks), join forces with priest Father John Sullivan (Matthew Kennedy), to try and track down the killer.  The search causes Ahab to make contact with his estranged sister Chelsea (Amy Groening), and she is just one of many who are in danger, as Fuchman begins to kill again.

Wild, raunchy, and gory, the adventure eventually leaves the bounds of reality, becoming quite surreal, and sickly twisted.  Violent, irreverent, sadistic, and disgusting, this is the kind of outrageous stuff Troma is known for.  Some of it is so extreme, that viewing it could result in irreparable brain damage, for those who are sensitive.  Yet, for all blood and insanity, the story runs deeper than it may appear.

The four disc limited collector's edition (5000 units) includes both the Bluray and DVD versions of the movie, a DVD with bonus materials, and a CD with songs from the film's soundtrack.  Unfortunately there isn't too much in the way of making of featurettes, but otherwise, the bonus material is pretty solid.  The film often goes for a sleazy grindhouse look, so the Bluray does not always provide the visual enhancements you would typically expect.  For those with a casual interest, the DVD edition might be sufficient to capture the brutal experience that is Father's Day.",1365724800,2,1969,5.154088050314465

Bloody, sexy, nasty and wrong in many ways (I mean all that in the best possible way of course.)

5113757,4,B007WW94VU,"Holy moley! This film contains bad acting, cheap extreme gore effects, groan-inducing comedy and dime store stop-motion animation (which makes Brett Piper's work look like the late Ray Harryhausen), but I'll be damned if it all doesn't work as a whole to make a highly entertaining film, as long as you are not one to get easily queasy. Ten years ago, the eyepatch-wearing Ahab (Adam Brooks) was convicted of murdering an innocent man he thought was Chris Fuchman (pronounced ""F***man""), a rapist and serial killer of fathers. Fuchman (Mackenzie Murdock) assaulted and murdered Ahab's father when he was just a kid and then sliced Ahab's right eye with a box cutter (all shown lovingly in close-up) and since then Ahab was on the search for the deadly serial killer. After being set-up for murder and sent to jail, Ahab does his time and is released from prison, where he goes into hiding at a cabin in the woods, collecting toxic berries (don't ask) and making maple syrup from trees that aren't maples (really, don't ask). Priest Father John Sullivan (Matthew Kennedy) finds Ahab and talks him into coming back to civilization. The assaulting and killing of fathers starts again as soon as he is released from prison, so Detective Stegel (Brent Neale, who talks and bears a resemblance to James Woods) thinks Ahab is responsible. The latest victim is the father of male prostitute/thief Twink (Conor Sweeney), who is assaulted in his posterior and then set on fire. Twink joins Ahab and Father Sullivan to try and bring Fuchman down, but first Ahab tries to talk his sister Chelsea (Amy Groening) into leaving the strip club she works at and live a normal life. Chelsea wants to join the trio in their pursuit of Fuchman (she has been tracking his progress over the years in a journal she keeps), but Ahab refuses. Fuchman tries to kidnap Chelsea after assaulting and killing Twink's best friend Walnut (Garrett Hnatiuk) by biting his manhood off (it seems Walnut got several girls pregnant, which technically makes him a father), but Ahab and his new-found friends foil it. Fuchman finally kidnaps Chelsea at the strip club, killing all the strippers (one has her head sliced in half with a chainsaw) and the patrons. Ahab nearly dies after giving chase in a car to save Chelsea (he is impaled on the tire iron he is carrying after falling off Fuchman's truck) and Twink and Father Sullivan crash their car. This leads to a night in the woods, where Twink and Father Sullivan eats some of Ahab's toxic berries and trip out (it's one of the film's funny highlights) and force feed Ahab some of the berries. The berries heal Ahab and they end up at Fuchman's hideout (after the film stops for a short fake commercial for a film to be shown later that day, which ends with a hilarious stinger), where they find Chelsea chained up and Fuchman on the run. Ahab kills Fuchman by shotgunning him in the groin, stomping on his head and throwing him off a dam wall, thereby ending the menace (there's a funny shot at the end of this scene that involves a train coming out of a tunnel). Do you really think it would be that easy? Father Sullivan finds a book under the murdered Father O'Flynn's (Kevin Anderson) bed, which details that the Fuchmanus is actually a demon reincarnated in Hell after incest between a brother and sister that produces an offspring. When Chelsea shows up at Ahab's motel room dressed scantily and coming on to him, Ahab gives in and has sex with his sister (cringe-worthy to say the least). Chelsea is now in Hell (see if you can spot the STAR WARS [1977] homage) and the trio decide to kill themselves so they can go to Hell and save her. Ahab and Twink end up in Hell, but Father Sullivan ends up in Heaven, where he puts a gun to his angel guide's (Falcon Van Der Baek) head and forces him to take him to God (played by Troma head Lloyd Kaufman, who released this film on home video). Father O'Flynn appears in God's office and forces him at gunpoint to send Father Sullivan to Hell (since Father O'Flynn is blind, he really doesn't know where to aim the gun, which leads to a bit of funny dialogue by Kaufman). What happens next is best for the viewers to discover, but I will say that the final stinger is funny as hell (look for THE DEER HUNTER [1978] reference).  Directed and written (among many other duties behind the camera) by a Canadian group that call themselves ""Astron-6"", which includes stars Brooks, Sweeney and Kennedy, as well as Jeremy Gillespie (who has a bit part here and co-wrote most of the film's original music) and Steven Kostanski (who directed Astron-6's equally funny and low rent MANBORG - 2011), FATHER'S DAY was a surprise to me from the start. It contains everything I usually hate, including giving it that fake ""grindhouse"" look by inserting emulsion scratches, some out of fucus photography and hairs on the projector bulb, but this is a great way to spend 99 minutes if you just want a good, old-fashioned 70's or 80's-like gore film with a plot that is sometimes inventive and sometimes offensive. Nothing is left to the imagination, including the aforementioned manhood-biting, gunshots to the head, bodies torn in half and many other bloody bits. The comedy and acting are definitely hit-or miss, but that just adds to its charm. Troma founders Kaufman and Michael Herz produced the film and released it in a four disc limited edition Blu-Ray, 2 DVDs & a CD music soundtrack box set, with many extras (a Troma trademark), including a couple of Astron-6 short films and liner notes by acclaimed Canadian independent director Guy Maddin (THE SADDEST MUSIC IN THE WORLD - 2003), who gets a ""Thanks"" during the end credits. This is way better than most of the crap that Troma releases and it gets my highest recommendation. Also starring Meredith Sweeney, Kyle Young, Zsuzsi, Billy Sadoo and Murray Davidson. A Troma Entertainment Blu-Ray/DVD Release. Unrated for all the right reasons, including copious nudity and an extremely uncomfortable scene where Fuchman injects his manhood with some unknown substance and then cuts it with a knife, rubbing the blood on Chelsea's face. NOTE: Astron 6 believed that Troma released the first release on Blu-Ray too early before the film was fully edited, so they released a new version when it was done.

I am glad to have this in my collection, it was well done and well packaged - but I would of loved to see the making of Documentary and wish the soundtrack included here, was the actual soundtrack and not a few rock band songs.  Still support Astron-6, these guys need to keep making movies!",1357948800,,669,4.387096774193548

5113760,5,B007WW94VU,"The first time I saw ""Father's Day"" was at a screening in NYC at Times Scare on Father's Day.  It was one of the best movies I have seen in a theater in a very long time.  I am now the proud owner of #3380.  As a filmmaker who has primarily worked in independent cinema for the past five years, I am so impressed with what Astron 6 was able to create with this project .  This film is funny, smart, original, and even though it was shot for $10,000, it looks like it was shot for $100,000.  Making a feature for $10,000 and making it look good has about the same odds as winning the lottery.  99% of films made for under $100,000 fail.  That's what makes this movie such an important chapter in independent horror. It gives the rest of us hope that it can be done.",1356652800,,764,4.087248322147651

5113762,2,B007WW94VU,"This title was banned by the censors from screening in a film festival in Australia recently, so as a freedom of speech supporter who hates censorship, I went straight to my Amazon account and out of sheer curiosity ordered a copy. Ah, the benefits of a favourable exchange rate and free trade agreements...

I watched the introductory comments about the process used to recreate the feel of early 1980's pics of similar aspirations, which was interesting. That aspect of the film was definitely quite intringuing in terms of the techniques used to create such effects.

I WILL NOT INCLUDE ANY PLOT SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW.

I also found the recreation of the style overall of that earlier era of films was quite superbly done. Acting, cinematography, voices, makeup, wardrobe - all was very well executed.

I am not an expert in this genre nor of movies from the 1980s that generally cover such subjects, but I can't say I will be rushing out to see any more of this kind. I can't really say I was glad I saw it.

The story itself is hardly new, and that in itself (the basic plot) did not worry me. It was some of the intensely graphic scenes that I will refrain from describing here that I found not just shocking but actually disturbing.

I am not criticising the story itself - the extremely graphic scenes, in the context of the plot, made sense - but it was totally too much for this viewer.

To put this in perspective, as someone who has seen his fair share of slasher movies and classics such as Passolini's SALO, I thought I could take just about anything served up within the Amazon catalogue. How wrong I was!

I am sure (a) the makers of this film were entirely faithful to the genre, and (b) that what they have created is not a travesty. In many ways it was a very interesting and cleverly constructed film - the detail and skill that went into it is obvious to see.

I felt I could not give this film three stars as I do not think it to be OK. While I think it should never have been censored - discerning adults should have the right to choose for themselves - I would strongly urge prospective viewers who may be unfamiliar with this genre to read up about the film, and its genre generally, before watching it.

It literally has taken me 72 hours to recover from the shocking scenes that really do almost defy description - I do not think words could do justice to the brutality of the sequences in question.

I guess my suggestion would be...be careful wading into a viewing of this kind of material, this film will I feel definitely go way beyond just offending or confronting many of you.

Having said that - I still believe in the transformative power of art - and there is as I said above an awful lot of talent that has gone into this film. Like certain painters who I find disturbing, this film is just as outrageous and pulls no punches, and avoided any compromise to achieve the intended effect.

I would like to celebrate the skills of all those involved - unfortunately my central nervous system is not quite recovered to be at that point yet.

For those into this genre and the particular filmmakers, you will not be disappointed.

Me, I'm off to walk in the sunshine, sit on a park bench, and listen to the birds chirping for a while.",1355097600,12,3267,4.44891122278057
5113763,5,B007WW94VU,"From the team of Astron 6, Father's Day is about as wrong a film as you will ever see in your whole life.  If you think you've seen over-the-top surreal displays of just plain wrong before in other Troma classics like Tromeo & Juliet, Terror Firmer, or Poultrygeist; Father's Day takes it all to a whole new level of disgusting hilarity.  What happens when a serial killer/rapist that targets father's begins racking up the body count after a lengthy absence?  Oh boy, I really wish I could spill more here, but I can't; there's just certain things about Father's Day that you have to see to believe, if you can stomach it that is.  Everything about this movie, from the over-the-top grindhouse/exploitation nature/tributes to the brilliant soundtrack to the gut-wrenching gore will make you stand up and applaud.  It's sick, vile, twisted, and immensely enjoyable.  Don't believe any negative hype about this film that you may have heard, check it out.  You'll be glad that you did.",1353715200,2,983,4.850299401197605

5113768,2,B007WW94VU,"I first read about this movie in Rue Morgue - It was a pretty extensive article, and actually the cover story for that issue.  I almost feel bad about writing a negative review knowing the backstory of how difficult this was to make.  But after dropping $26 on this...

Based on how crazy and over the top the reviews made this out to be,  I ran out to my local Amoeba to pick up a copy.  All I can really say is, don't believe the hype about this one.  Yes, it's a pretty tasteless and shocking idea, and sounds like a great exploitation throwback along the lines of 'Hobo with a Shotgun', or 'Tromeo and Juliet'. However, a lot of outrageous ideas and dialogue don't add up to anything if the execution isn't there.  I don't recall the last time I was this disappointed with a movie - From everything I've read about this, it was initially a short or a fake trailer that was expanded to a feature.  Problem is, they didn't seem to have enough material to pull it off. It seems like they mistake randomness for humor with a lot of the dialogue, and it just doesn't work. Remember how stupid and out of place the 'pancakes' scene was in Cabin Fever? The whole thing is like that.

One thing I will give them credit for - The look of the movie is impressive - A lot of reds and blues, cool camerawork, and a couple of impressive stunts.  It's frustrating, because these guys seem like they really have some talent, and are capable of making an exploitation masterpiece some day. This isn't it.",1349395200,7,1492,4.353790613718411

When I saw that this film was out on Blu-Ray and it looked like it had all the trappings of the grindhouse...I was in! the movie is ridiculous and entertaining and over the top. That's exactly what I wanted. The issue I have is...where are all the special features?!? The disc has a trailer for special features. That's pretty weak. Maybe I'm spoiled with all the Arrow Video, Grindhouse Releasing and Scream Factory stuff that's coming out lately, but c'mon - you could've added something to the disc.
