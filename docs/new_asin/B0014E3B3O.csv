You get the feeling that you need to be on Muhammed Ali street back in ole school to get the full flavor.  Soheir?  Be still my heart!  They don't make costumes like that anymore.  It's amazing how these dancers take the most basic core moves and turn them into laudable performances.  If Egyptian is your dance of choice and you can refrain from hatin', you will be 100% satisfied with this mostly black & white film.  There is skill, beauty, humor, drama, love, not-so-love-, love loss, weddings, night clubs and more.  If I could dance back in time.....sigh!",1367452800,,639,4.684684684684685
8255388,4,B0014E3B3O,"If you like to read about the history of your dance form, there are certain names you keep running into.  This DVD, composed of clips from mainly Egyptian movies from mainly the 1950's, will give you the opportunity to see what some of those dancers you keep reading about actually looked (and moved) like.  While the subtitles give you enough info to know who was dancing in what film and what other big names (not necessarily dancers) were involved with the production, as well as when the film was made, there is a drawback.  Just when you get interested in the story that seems to be going on around the dance--the clip ends.  And while you're watching, unless your Arabic is more extensive than my few words relating to dance, you are likely to be frustrated by the sense that if you could just turn the volume up--or down--or something--you would be able to understand what is being said.  The clips themselves are much clearer than some old films I've seen.",1333929600,2,964,4.614035087719298
8255389,4,B0014E3B3O,"This DVD is a must for the dancer/dance historian.  It is great to see these icons of Belly Dance in action. Most of us have just seen photos of these dancers.

However, there is a down side to this DVD.  I could only run it on my computer, and not on my other DVD players.  Therefore, I cannot share this item with my dance students during dance class.  Bummer!",1325894400,2,362,4.188405797101449
