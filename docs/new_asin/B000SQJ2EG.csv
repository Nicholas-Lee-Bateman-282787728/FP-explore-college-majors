8206361,5,B000SQJ2EG,"All things considered, the best of my many DVDs of ""Die Lustige Witwe."" It's the only one done in Lehar's homeland of Austria with the slightly corrupt and more than slightly raunchy Austrian touch. The title role is sung, danced, and acted deliciously and voluptuously by a Hispanic American, but she was justly chosen for the part over what must have been formidable native-German-speaking competition. Hausmann was slightly more than half the age of Arellano, but it isn't noticeable, and they're marvelous and believable together. Starzinger is an amazing Valencienne. I don't have time to cite all the other excellent performances, including dancers in non-singing roles. This is the one to get, but if your taste is more refined and decorous, or the microphone headsets irritate you, Dagmar Schellenberger and the Zrich folks, including the same choreographer, also turned out a five-star DVD, which I enjoy almost as much. I provided both of these DVDs to a brilliant young soprano starring in a regional production, and she was singled out by reviews. No other DVDs come close to these two, but if you insist on an English version, go for the BBC San Francisco version with Yvonne Kenny. Avoid Sutherland, who should have quit while she was ahead.",1511395200,,1255,5.038461538461538

8206363,5,B000SQJ2EG,"I thoroughly enjoyed this production... what a marvelous treatmentnt of the Franz Lehar classic... the beautiful, melodic score,especially the waltz from the very begininning of the opera plays out and you are whisked away in the lilting music and the humerous, ironic story.. the cast is tremendous.. both the principal lovers are wonderful in their performance.. the count is handsome,debonair with an exceptional tenor voice, and Anna is gorgeous,sensous,and what a beautiful voice.. Initially I waited on purchasing this in German, but having a familiarity based only on operas, I am glad Idid purchase this version of the opera...It is the completed score, and it is a delight to the soul! enjoy!",1340841600,,701,5.267857142857143
8206364,1,B000SQJ2EG,"An operetta is a musical production in which the songs are crucially important.  If the sound is so poor that you hardly hear the singer, how can you possibly enjoy this?  A typical Morbisch prodution has pathetic sound, and this Merry Widow is no exception.  It is filmed on an outdoor stage with tiny microphones on each performer and it does not work.  Act III at Maxim's does not feel Parisian at all.  Choreography is poor or non-existent, dances do not flow.  This Maxim's feels like an amateur 3-ring circus.  There is no feeling between the performers and they are supposed to be in love!  This version has tried to add some humor to the dialogue and it fails miserably.  This is the very worst performance I have seen of the Merry Widow, either on stage in Europe or on tape.  I own an old VHS tape of a Sydney Opera House performance, with Joan Sutherland as Anna, wow!",1295395200,3,879,4.471698113207547
8206365,5,B000SQJ2EG,"To  be  in  the  audience,  one  would  have  to  have  binoculars,  but  watching  this  operetta  on  DVD  is  very  enjoyable.  The  music  is  light  and  one  finds  ones-self  hummintg  the  tunes.
The  action  is  fast  moving,  the  stagesettings  and  the  costumes  very  colorful.  One  reviewer  found  criticism,  but  one  has  to  remember,  that  the  stage  is  gigantic  and  the  large  outdoor  audience  has  to  be  controlled  with  the  actions  on  the  stage.",1206403200,16,485,4.777777777777778
8206366,5,B000SQJ2EG,"After the San Francisco production of The Merry widow (in english), with a marvelous stage and costumes design, I thought there was not going to be another one in DVD. This is even better. Fist of all in the original language and the original score.

Margarita de Arellano (much much better than Yvonne Kenny at the San francisco production)looks nice, has a great voice and sings and acts wondeful as Hanna. Mathias Haussmann is a great Danilo physycally, vocally and as an actor (in this case Skhovus is as good as him or even better at the San Francisco production). The rest of the cast are superb too in their roles, vocally and acting.

The most importante of all is to see the whole cast having a great time on the stage.

The stage design and lightning are traditional and magnificent, and profits of all the possiblities that brings that gigantic stage surrounded by water. There are also some special effects like fireworks.

The same for the costume design, pretty, classical and coloured.

The stage direction, is great too, and must have been difficult to design it considering that the stage is crowded during most of the 150 minutes of opera. Specially apropriate and funny is the ballet of the third act (at Maxim's)

The sound is ver good. Dolby Digital 5.0, and the format 16:9 and not 4:3 as is written in the back of the case. Subtitles in english, french and Italian.

I think this is a very very good tribute to Franz Lehr. He would have been proud of his greatest work.

Buy it (I have to thank to mr. Ponessa's review that helped me to decide to buy this DVD), you won't regret. Enjoy it as I am doing.",1196208000,39,1626,4.525597269624574
8206367,5,B000SQJ2EG,"I picked up a DVD of this production in Berlin last year, and have watched it several times, and it has become one of my favorites.  This DVD records an outdoor Summer 2005 production of DIE LUSTIGE WITWE (The Merry Widow) to commemorate the hundredth anniversary of its premiere in December of 1905.  The text is complete, and the little nonstop joys of the libretto remain intact, unlike any other performance available on home video.  That alone would make this DVD worthwhile, but in addition the staging is absolutely superb.  A cast of hundreds enact an entire universe of precisely staged tableaux, while the spirit of Lehar energizes the musical team.  At the same time, at the heart of all this, the feelings of the principal characters find real mutual chemistry.  The sun goes down as the performance begins, and the fireworks at the end perfectly punctuate a great ensemble performance.  Wow, and more wow!",1185062400,49,918,4.883870967741935
