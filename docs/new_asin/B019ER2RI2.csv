8745004,3,B019ER2RI2,"Catching Milat is an Australian two-part mini-series based on the book 'Sins of the Brother' by Mark Whittaker and Les Kennedy about 'The Backpacker Murders' and serial killer Ivan Milat. The 'Wolf Creek' movies are for the most part based on these murders.

 It begins with the discovery of the bodies of seven young backpackers in Belanglo State Forest in New South Wales and focuses much more heavily on the authorities attempt to catch him than Milat himself. I would've appreciated it if they had have gone into a lot more detail about Ivan Milat's life, why he kills and his supposedly crazy family instead it's almost all about the clashes of personalities and egos in Task Force Air the task force set up to catch the killer focusing on Detective Paul Gordon (Richard Cawthorne, from the excellent 'Killing Time' TV show).

 Ivan Milat is played well by Malcolm Kennard (also from 'Killing Time') and you get a real sense of the charismatic personality Milat supposedly had whilst also being a brutal psychopathic killer. The shots of Belanglo State Forest are incredible and with it's massive size and relative isolation it's easy to see how these crimes could've happened out there and remain undetected for years.

 Now being made for TV there isn't much blood here but 'Catching Milat' could've been so much better than it was which all up was really just average. Despite having always been interested in serial killers strangely I didn't have much knowledge of Ivan Milat and The Backpacker Murders going into this even though I've seen both of the Wolf Creek movies so for me it was reasonably informative as a procedural drama.",1463702400,,1643,4.870967741935484
8745005,4,B019ER2RI2,"Ivan Milat was one of Australias most infamous murderers and this two-part mini-series provides a police procedural account of the investigation. The series is based on true events but there are some inaccuracies which have received criticism from the real detectives involved with the case. Ultimately the narrative presents a fairly detailed profile of Milat and the investigation, and the edgy mood throughout the series causes many anxious moments.

8745006,4,B019ER2RI2,"I admit I didn't watch the Blu-Ray version of this two-part Australian mini-series, so I can't comment on the quality of the picture and sound, etc. As for the show itself, however, it is pretty well done overall.  It follows a long investigation of serial killings, first by individual detectives, and then by a huge task force assembled to close the case.  The program also follows Ivan Milat, the man who develops into the lead suspect, as well as his family to some extent.

The show seems to have stereotypical scenes here and there concerning a young detective who butts heads with superiors that he feels are too cautious and moving too slow.  I feel like I have seen this sort of plot before, but I can only assume in this case it is based on actual events. It does feel real in one respect at least. Unlike with a lot of fictional police thrillers, the bad guy here makes a few mistakes and isn't a super criminal to be brought down in the last ten minutes of the last episode.

At the end of the second episode we get brought up to date on what happened to the three main characters, including pictures of the actors and the people they played. It made for an interesting wrap -up.  This isn't a show I would want to buy or even watch a second time, but I have no regrets or complaints about watching it once.",1446249600,,1319,4.363265306122449
