Done by Draw Magazine editor Maike Manley (and artist Bret Blevins) along with Write Now! Magazine editor Danny Fingeroth, who know and work in the business, this is a great place to start and a great resource.",1170633600,,354,4.725806451612903

With a title like ""From Script To Print"", I was expecting to see the artist draw ""Starting with a BLANK page"".",1124755200,22,332,4.39344262295082
