5180425,5,B008S2NAC2,"Lukewarm is a charming Christian film about forgiveness. The best part is that actor, singer JOHN SCHNEIDER (Dukes of Hazzard, Smallville, Collier & Company) is cast in a supporting role as the absent father of a boy who grows up not knowing exactly what to do with his life. If you see a preview, it shows practically the whole story of Christian awareness of hurt, betrayal, love, and forgiveness not easily given but finally earned. A good family film.

Unfortunately, my purchased copy from Amazon was broken upon arrival, and I am awaiting a new one, but I did get to see the film online as a rental.",1353974400,,605,4.601851851851852

5180446,5,B008S2NAC2,"I'm not sure why this movie got so many negative reviews.  It was a simple movie with a good moral premise an uplifting ending- exactly what I expected.  The acting was as good as anything that is on prime time television today and the story was positive.  I am new to the christian movie genre, but am finding that every movie I have seen thus far is better than anything out in the theater.  'Lukewarm' is no exception.  I enjoyed the clean family entertainment and believe it was worth the $3 to rent it.  My only complaint is that I would have like to know what happened to George and Sam in the long term- whether they grew in faith and used the time in jail to turn their lives around.",1443830400,5,691,4.236641221374046

5180457,4,B008S2NAC2,"I really enjoyed this movie.

Obviously it comes with a lot of Christian-movie elements, however, unlike some of the more sub-par Christian produced movies, the acting in this one feels natural and the story is interesting.

The message is especially relevant for us today.",1425081600,,273,5.181818181818182

5180466,4,B008S2NAC2,"The movie was a very good movie. I would certainly recommend it. However, my real review is for Amazon.com. During the movie we experienced periodic freezes -- I assumed was from a slow internet. It was rather annoying, but we did get to see the entire movie. We didn't complain to Amazon because I just figured it probably wasn't their fault either, just an internet thing that occurs from time-to-time. Just today (a few days after we ordered the movie) I got an email stating that we were getting a credit for the movie. I didn't know why and was actually going to email back that we didn't request a refund. But then I noticed a second email from Amazon that gave the reason for the credit. Without us calling to complain about the problem with the movie, Amazon must have detected the problem and credited us the amount of the rental. We did get to see the whole movie and would have no problem paying the rental fee even with the problems. Anyway, kudos to Amazon.com for their fantastic customer service. Not just with this situation, but anytime I had an issue they were there to immediately correct a problem. That's why Amazon.com is one of the very few internet companies I would trust!! Although we basically rented this movie for free, we will certainly be back to rent many, many more movies from Amazon. Sorry NetFlix!",1409961600,,1333,4.605042016806722
5180467,1,B008S2NAC2,"My family typically loves the corny christian movies...however, this one was so boring. We gave it to the 30 min mark, but just couldn't take it anymore. John Schneider was great, as always, but he was only on screen for several minutes.",1409443200,2,237,4.666666666666667
5180468,3,B008S2NAC2,"This christian film is laced with smoking and drinking, It also is one of the darkest I have seen.

5180471,2,B008S2NAC2,Very poor cast. John Schneider should have passed on this one. The supporting cast was too green.,1407369600,2,97,4.764705882352941

5180477,4,B008S2NAC2,I like the movie however like all Christian movies the acting isn't the best. maybe that's because it isn't acting and the people in these types of movies are true to their characters never the less I would say its worth a watch. ENJOY and may GOD BLESS YOU YOUR FAMILY and FRIENDS,1400284800,,281,4.320754716981132
5180478,5,B008S2NAC2,"This was a wonderful movie, one that you can sit down with the entire family and enjoy. It is a story filled with the hope of redemption and salvation. I am not one to one to cry, but at the cost of my ""machismo"", I did while watching an older copy. Better yet thet were tears filled with joy at the thought of another's realization about God's greatness.",1399939200,,355,4.235294117647059
5180479,1,B008S2NAC2,"This film isn't worth renting.  There was one character (the elderly black man) that captured the essence of Christian life/living, but most of the film focused on 'being good' and 'not sinning' .. not a peep about the power of the Holy Spirit and very little about walking in a daily personal relationship with Jesus.  The very bad acting, illogical setting, make it awkward to watch. The kid was a good actor, Schneider, too, but neither of them have a significant amount of screentime.  My greatest concern (as a Christian) is how this film would be viewed by a non-believer.  The focus was on 'working hard' and 'being good' .. and not focused on living for Jesus.  Will this film drive people away from Jesus by ignoring the power of God for Christian living? We need to pray for the producers of this movie to learn about and live in the anointing of the Holy Spirit before embarking on another project.",1399852800,28,909,4.62111801242236
5180480,5,B008S2NAC2,"Lukewarm is a movie that will give the simple truth about living the life as a Christian.  That as a Christian there is no middle ground, only the straight and narrow road that leads to life.",1398038400,,191,4.305555555555555
5180481,5,B008S2NAC2,This is a good moral movie that the whole family can watch together. I would recommend this movie to you as well.,1397260800,2,113,4.181818181818182
5180482,5,B008S2NAC2,"I really like John, it is a very good actor and enjoyed this move very much. It is hard to find my type of movie because I don't watch R rated. Like good clean movies and this was one.",1393804800,2,184,3.7435897435897436
5180483,5,B008S2NAC2,"This movie tells the story of a son and how his life takes some twists and the results of a father who isn't in the son's life after divorce. It is very good at telling the story with including how someone else has a life fully filled with Christian spirit that cannot be broken, in spite of adversity. Great movie. Highly recommend for family.",1392854400,3,344,4.390625
5180484,3,B008S2NAC2,John Schneider has a very small part in this movie..You see him in flash backs & once in the present time. This movie was just ok for me. Not a movie I would watch over & over....Saw it once on uplifting entertainment.. I thought you would see more of a relationship between the dad and his son. But they only showed flash backs of that. They connected once for a very brief time when his son was all grown up..As I said this movie was just ok for me...,1391385600,2,453,4.101123595505618

5180489,3,B008S2NAC2,"The movie wasn't bad, though it could have been improved upon. Some of the acting was good, some a bit amateur. The scene where the guy was beat up looked way too fake.

The thing I had a problem with, was the couple living together and they were both supposedly Christians. The movie makes a lot about him not being a very good Christian, but if the girl was a Christian, then why was she living with her boyfriend?

I don't feel like I wasted my time by watching it, but wish it had been a little better",1388880000,2,505,4.142857142857143

5180498,5,B008S2NAC2,"I liked this DVD a lot! It protrays life as it is today! Every one struggles with doing the what's right!  ! Luke's life started off wrong when He was a little Boy .It wasn't His fault !  He was so lost! He realized He could make It on His Own(do it His way"")  He was haunted for Years. He resented His Dad so Much He wouldn't take His calls!  I loved this movies because it Shows how Much Courage it takes to do the right thing! ! He was so bitter He wouldn't talk to His Dad on the phone when He called! John Schneider played  His Dad & He as always did a Great acting Job! Luke learned about ""Truth & Consequences BEFORE He ruined His Life! It was a story that made Me laugh & than CRY! It was wonderfully written showing living takes a ""Lot of Courage ""There are some very SAD Scenes in the story showing You have the Choice of standing FIRM in what You  believe or suffering down the road because You took the easy way out for You at the time.  It is very true to life""Problems happen to Everyone! ! it is the WAY We chose to handle Them that counts! Jeremy Jones Played Luke & He did a FINE JOB playing His Role! He was really trying to decide if He wanted to commit to His girl friend( Played by Nicole Gale Andrews.)  Jason Burkey (October Baby)did a great Job being the Guy Who ""felt the Laws were written for other People to obey ?
  Without giving too much of the movie's ending away I would encourage Anyone to get a Copy,I don't think You will be disappointed! In the end We are left to see It Does promote COURAGE & FAITH to make the right Choices! Forgiveness is a MUST! All this said It isn't a boring Movie,It's actually moving My emotions through the whole movie! More than anything We have forgotten some of Our Values .Today it seems like everything is always ""Someone Elses fault "" & There are no consequences just because It was Made to be Someone Elses Fault .
 I am glad John Schneider name was used to ""promote the Movie""  I have seen Him in a few Faith Based Movies .I'm glad He is willing to appear ! Most are operating on a LOW Budjet & Need a BIG name to attract the  Audience ..He is a great actor,Well known & People will watch this movie just because His Name is with this Movie! However,the other Actors did a great jpb! That's why I gave it 5 stars .I will buy at least one more copy to give My Family.",1369440000,,2336,4.0964912280701755

The way front cover is designed could even lead us to believe that John Schneider plays the lead role but actually NOT because he's only in the film for a matter of minutes !  Jason Burkey, who plays a likable character in October Baby, plays a really unlikable drunk bar owner in this movie...not so good. The star of the show is Bill Cobbs (also of the Ultimate Gift, another great movie) who plays an old man who really lives out what he believes.",1363996800,,609,4.691588785046729

The message is so powerful that we cant say Forgive me without taking a stand and living forgiveness. As a writer I see this as many women send their experiences and are struggling with this. I hope those that see this movie really meditate. great over all.,1362182400,4,371,4.470588235294118
5180507,3,B008S2NAC2,The movie is somewhat confusing if you miss any part of it.  It's a good movie.  I bought it because John Schneider was in it.  Not a big a role as I would have liked.  This movie isn't one I would order again.,1362182400,,210,3.813953488372093
5180508,3,B008S2NAC2,"The movie was well made.  The acting was pretty good.  Over-all quality was way above earlier Christian flicks.

But, I wish John had been in the movie more.  I wish the characters were a bit more like-able/love-able.
I wish the movie had more real people reactions to what was going on.

The hero just doesn't flow as a ""good guy"".  The girl-friend of the hero who is a major player here is just SOOO stupid when it comes to the ""life-long-admirer""... (For that matter he should be put away by the hero way earlier because the girl-friend should have told the hero much earlier how terrible the jerk was.

I think this movie tried to be ""gritty"";  Bartender hero.  Disfunctional family backgrounds. Nasty characters.  Heros living in sin!  Gritty just seemed more like a Christian movie trying to be more ....worldly while trying to keep the Christian idea going.

The saving grace in this movie is the usual fine performance of the black guy who is leading in the solid Christian Christ-like character through-out his time in the movie.

""Gritty"" is not what comes across here.... stupid humans making totally dumb decisions in poor fashion is what comes across..... kinda like what we all do in our lives.........................",1361145600,,1232,4.865384615384615
5180509,4,B008S2NAC2,A powerful message of forgiveness. We must be able to forgive like Thomas in this movie could! It is not easy but our blessings won't come before this takes place.,1358640000,6,163,4.466666666666667
5180510,5,B008S2NAC2,"This movie covers many bases or issues in ones life.  It makes one think and also how to treat others.  Forgiveness, love, kindness, anger, helping others.  Well done movie highly recommend.  Keeps one thinking and on your toes. humbling at that!!!",1357603200,2,248,4.975609756097561
5180511,2,B008S2NAC2,"Here's the plain-and-simple deal: the message in the film is basically fine but the production quality and acting leaves a lot to be desired.  If you think you might want to check it out, you're probably better off renting it first before purchasing to see if you really might want to buy it. If you're new to the Christian/faith movie type genre, there are much higher quality productions out there like Courageous, October Baby, Fireproof, The Second Chance, The Climb, etc.

5180512,3,B008S2NAC2,"I preordered this movie, because I like John Schneider, and I was very impressed with Jason Burkey's acting in October Baby.  I guess my expectations for this film were high, because October Baby was fresh in my mind, and it was a quality film-- great acting, plot, music, cinematography, etc.  Lukewarm had a promising storyline, but the acting was hit and miss, and the music was uninspiring.  John Schneider did a fine job, as always, but he had a small part (contrary to his prominent picture on the cover!).  I'm still quite impressed with Jason Burkey.  He was as believable in this bad boy role as he was as every girl's dream guy in October Baby.  The main character was only so-so-- kind of stiff.  The ending was very abrupt.  With better acting, music, and production, this could've been a wonderful film.  As it is, it is probably worth your time if you enjoy any of these actors, or if you're not too picky.  My advice: rent or borrow it before/instead of buying it.
For Christian parents: the only potentially offensive element I noticed was the excessive drinking and the lifestyle choices that resulted.  But the consequences are portrayed, and they are very negative.",1354492800,40,1184,4.754901960784314
5180513,2,B008S2NAC2,"I am normally a positive reviewer, and have been criticized for being too much so.  However, this film doesn't provide much to be positive about.  But there were some bright spots in this movie.  The Christian message and lifestyle example was aptly presented by Bill Cobbs (black man on DVD cover).  And of course, John Schneider and Jason Burkey are both excellent actors.  I've seen other work by Director, Tom Makowski (DVD, Decision), and he pretty much utilized the same tool set in directing and editing both films... loose directing of the actors, and very loose editing of the final footage. Ok, lets talk about values of the young Christian couple Jessie(Nicole Anderson), Luke (Jermey Jones) our protagonists in this story.  They are shown living together out of wedlock in a converted motel.  Yes, he does propose to her later. We never see any ill consequences of this.  In fact Luke is a blessed man.  He's seen tooling around in a perfectly restored, classic Corvette. Then there is the mom, Rose (Jenna van Oy).  Makowski never caught that maybe there were times when we saw a little too much of her feminine pulchritude.  I'll say no more about that.  Later in the film we are introduced to Matthew (Brett Pack).  It turns out that he has been madly in love with Jessie since birth.  Luke is clueless of course, and leaves Jessie alone with him in a restaurant to ""catch up"". Do you think our Christian heroine runs from Matthew to protect her bond with Luke?  Why would a Christian girl do that!  She's clueless too, and even stays in the car after he expresses his undying love for her.  Later she visits him at his hotel room.  By the way, Matthew is a blessed man too driving a tricked-out, late model Camaro.  Alas, our heroes are anything but role model examples to young viewers.  This film has no energy. Slow cuts between actors, and slow delivery of lines, would indicate that Mr Makowski pretty much let the actors call the shots. One final item.  This film is way over priced. Another large retailer is selling it for half the price.",1354406400,6,2062,4.6565096952908585
