1636965,5,B00005NQGM,"The DVD release of Bruiser, which shamefully has never had an American theatrical release that I'm aware of, should be a bright spot on the horizon not only for George Romero's fans but for film fans in general. This is a thoughtful, deeply personal film which stands far apart from commercial dreck like The Mummy Returns.
  Horror fans who have enjoyed Romero's past efforts, most notably Martin and Knightriders, will find much to love in Bruiser. The story deals with an Everyman named Henry Creedlow (the name is an indicator of his station in life, sort of like Willy Lowman) who finds it impossible to take control of his own life and consequently allows others to walk all over him. One morning he awakes to find that his identity has been stolen from him in a literal as well as a figurative sense, and finally takes steps to regain some of what he has lost.
  The story is at the same time original yet classically Romeroesque. The DVD itself is well-produced, with all the features that I, as a Romero fan, could have hoped for. The commentary is insightful, as I've come to expect on the basis of his previous commentary for Night of the Living Dead, Martin, and Knightriders. There is also a great music video, directed by Romero, for the Misfits song ""Scream"", which they perform at a party in the climax of the film.
  To tell you any more about the film would be to do you a disservice. Suffice to say that if you have an interest in suspense films which have something more to say than ""Aren't these pretty digital effects?"", check this one out.",1003708800,3,1562,4.560714285714286
1636966,5,B00005NQGM,"George Romero is incredibly insightful.  The kind of  insightfulness that allows you into, not only the world at large, but your own world, staring backwards at the covers and folly.
I wrote the score for Bruiser and I am always amazed at the character, the poignancy, the railing arms flailing of a lost hope and frustration.

Well then you'll love ""Bruiser"", the story of an everyday guy whose identity is stripped from him and the only way to regain who he was is by revenge.  Roemero does not disappoint with his first feature film since ""The Dark Half.""  Romero's unique style of filmmaking sets this film apart from similiar films of the same genre.

1636969,4,B00005NQGM,"Romero proves that he hasn't fallen off the map with Bruiser, his first film in a good many years. An insightful look at a down-trodden and walked upon man,it has slasher-revenge overtones, but Romero's stamp is clear, as the film is also funny (look for the scene where the kid with the amyl-nitrates gets pummeled). Fans won't be disapointed as it contains shades of his earlier work (Martin) exploring similar outcast themes. Genuine sympathy for the faceless character is created and it looks like Romero might be making a come-back.

1636994,3,B00005NQGM,"On the one hand, ""Bruiser"" is one of Romero's most polished movies.  It looks good, sounds good and the actors are consistently a cut above the typical Romero movies.  On the other hand, it lacks the visceral punch of his zombie flicks and lacks the disconcerting creepiness of ""Martin"".  ""Bruiser""is an amusing but unengaging portrait of an underdog gone bad.  Unfortunate, because the mask archetype had potential but wasn't convincingly explored.

Henry Creedlow is closer to Martin than to the Patrick Bateman character of ""American Psycho"" after whom Henry seems to be modeled.  The actor Jason Flemyng is good, but either he lacks the undercurrent of the handsome misfit about to explode, or else the character simply isn't drawn convincingly.

Peter Stormare, as usual, entertainingly chews up the scenery whenever he appears.  But his cad character is so over the top he's more a parody of an evil boss and not quite vile enough for us to cheer for Henry against this superficially charming oaf.

Pretty much for Romero fans only.",1375574400,,1038,5.023391812865497
1636995,3,B00005NQGM,"I bought this movie years and years ago but recently lost my only copy, that's where this purchase comes in, I just needed a cheap replacement.

There's no problems with the film or the disc but the issue I have is with the box art and method of shipping.

First the box art is so torn and destroyed they might as well have sent me a blank DVD case with the disc in because the fact they would send this out to a customer(even if it's a used DVD case) makes them seem so unprofessional.  Another thing is that there was nothing in the items description or sales page to make me think I'd be getting the box-art that has ""Wal-Mart"" postered all over it in white and black.

This is a shame because I got this to replace a missing DVD in my collection but this thing looks so awful I just can't bring myself to put it on the shelf unless I print out new cover-art or buy a new copy of the DVD.

Final note would be to buy the movie and enjoy it, but never buy used if you want to get good quality out of this seller.",1370390400,,1014,4.0
1636996,3,B00005NQGM,One of the best 90s slashers out there in my opinion and very underrated film by George Romero. The whole story of a guy that just takes people's crap non-stop finally snaps and that's where the movie takes off. The acting is pretty good all the way through it. Not very gory but very entertaining movie to say the least. Also it's very cheap to pick up and add to your horror movie collection so I would suggest picking it up.

1636997,4,B00005NQGM,"Bruiser is the name of the magazine that reserved Henry (Jason Flemyng) is employed. He imagines himself choking and killing people who push him around. At a company party he sees his wife  Nina Garbiras) pleasing his crude boss (Peter Stormare) with her hand. They are having an affair. His dog hates him. His maid steals from him and his friend is robbing him blind. Henry describes himself as ""house broke.""  Leslie Hope plays the understanding fellow co-worker and sometimes wife of Stormare who is just as disgusted with him as is Henry. She supplies him with the mask.

One miraculous day Henry wakes up with that same plain white mask as a face (see DVD cover). He now has the ability to act out his destructive fantasies...and he does.

The movie is an ""artsy"" dark comedy with a horror/slasher background. George C. Romero likes his symbols and metaphors to be subtle, like zombies walking aimlessly around a mall. This movie is not for everyone as it creates its own genre. It is not really a slasher, although before get killed. It doesn't generate real horror. It is not a LOL comedy, but it has humorous moments.

Romero exploring the situation of a man who has lost everything, including his identity, sufferings from a small budget and some ridiculous character acting from the support cast. Jason Flemyng is believable as nice guy Henry and the revenge seeking man once the blank face appears, even if his American accent isn't quite on...

1636999,2,B00005NQGM,"George Romero directs this straight to video thriller starring Guy Ritchie regular Jason Flemyng. Henry Creedlow (Flemyng) is a man beaten by life. His wife emasculates him, his best friend steals from him, and his boss Milo (Peter Stormare) embarrasses him during staff meetings. The only person who's nice to Henry is Rosie (Leslie Hope), the boss's wife. When Milo throws a backyard barbecue, Henry learns that Rosie makes masks for all of her friends. She  makes a mold of their faces and then has them decorate it so that it best represents their personality. When she tries it with Henry it fails because he's too shy and empty to decorate it. The next morning he wakes up and discovers that his old face is gone, replaced by his blank mask. He tries to tear it off but scratches himself in the process. Originally horrified, Henry becomes emboldened by his new anonymity and seeks revenge against those who have been taking advantage of him. The film is fun despite having it's fair share of problems. The police become aware of a masked vigilante and a cliched manhunt ensues. Flemyng does well while Stormare hams it up severely. The acting overall is weak. A decent little thriller from the legendary Romero that's worth a watch on DVD.",1246147200,4,1246,4.768518518518518
1637020,4,B00005NQGM,"George A Romero is a well known master of the horror genre. He also happens to have a big fan in Sid for a few reasons. The first would be the childhood enjoyment he's given us and Santa with the Tales from the Darkside tv series. Next would be Creepshow & the cherished Creepshow 2 which opened up the door to the work Pancho. The guy pumps out some classic works that are always fun to watch which is what brings us to tonights review. This film called Bruiser came out in 2000, the year of the classic cruise, and really packed a punch for Sid.

The film starts out with a nice guy named Harry who pretty much gets abused by everyone in life. He has a wife that just uses for his money, a ""best friend"" who rips him off, and a boss (Slippery Pete) who bashes him non-stop. The final icing on the cake comes when he finds his wife cheating on him with his boss. When he wakes up the morning after he has a white face that looks like a mask, hiding his true identity. From this point on you see a different Harry whose purpose is to get revenge. And he get this! It's a classic tale of the nice guy hitting his boiling point on simply going ape***t.

Bruiser isn't the best horror film you will see, but it is pretty darn good. It's not scary but definitely has the suspense/revenge thing going on. By far it's another solid work from Romero with a great storyline and the perfect ending.",1239321600,,1389,4.198501872659176
1637021,4,B00005NQGM,"""Bruiser"" is a great revenge/suspense film that features a cameo and soundtrack by the Misfits.

This movie has a great villain as played by Peter Stormare.  The arrogant, womanizing, jerk boss is hilariously entertaining-he's the man that you love to hate.  Stormare's Milo is the perfect foil to Jason Flemyng's timidness.

His portrayal of the villain really makes the scene where the ""Hero"" gets his revenge that much sweeter.

The movie is more suspense than horror, there's not alot of gore, just violence and creepy images.

The party scene with the Misfits is the reason I saw the movie and it's great to see/hear them throughout the film.  The Misfits song ""Descending Angel"" is used during the intro to the costume party scene, while ""Bruiser (If looks Could Kill)"" is played during the party itself.

Michale Graves, the lead singer of the Misfits actually has a cameo as a cop after the ""Hero"" gets his revenge on his wife/girlfriend.

Then ""Fiend Without A Face"" is played over the credits.

The movie does drag in some parts, like when he's getting revenge on his ""Friend"" who has been stealing his money, but overall it is a great watch, I recommend it.",1209081600,,1168,4.795
1637022,5,B00005NQGM,"it is an unusual film in many ways. The true monsters here are the ""normal"", decadent cheating human creatures surrounding him: like his wife, his ""friend"", his boss. They're all modern egomaniacs and psychic manipulating vampires. Bruiser is the naive, gentle guy who just... but watch it yourself.",1206489600,,299,5.25
1637023,3,B00005NQGM,"I had put off seeing Bruiser for some time, basically because I had heard not so great things about it.  As much as I love George Romero though, I had to give Bruiser a look, and the end result wasn't anything terrible in the least, but it was definitely not as good as it could have beeen either.  Bruiser stars Jason Flemyng (Lock, Stock, & Two Smoking Barrels, League of Extraordinary Gentlemen) as Henry Creedlow; a young executive who has been walked on his whole life.  His gorgeous wife (Nina Garbiras) cheats on him with his abusive boss (Peter Stormare), his best friend (Andrew Tarbet) has been stealing money from him, and generally nobody notices him.  Everything changes however when he wakes up one day to find his face is gone, replaced instead with a white, blank mask resembling those made by his bosses' wife (Leslie Hope).  Henry's sudden loss of identity allows him to seek bloody revenge against those who have wronged him, which works out pretty well throughout the film's first half, but sadly Bruiser loses steam after passing its halfway point.  Despite some moments of dark humor, Bruiser just ends up being an average revenge fantasy with some corny dialogue, and kind of a lame ending, but you still have to admire Romero's imagination.  Also featuring genre stalwart Tom Atkins and legendary horror punk rockers The Misfits.",1205193600,,1353,4.856521739130435
1637024,3,B00005NQGM,"Jason Flemyng plays Henry, a beaten-down exec at a glamor magazine who is being taken advantage of by his wife, his best friend, his boss, etc.  Of course, the movie is about his taking revenge, though he does so only by losing his identity.

There's the overview, so let me now say that what would have greatly helped this film would have been to instill it from the beginning with the kind of humor and playfyulness that the last half hour had.  Henry is a little too obvious about what he's oblivious to, and though Jason Flemyng plays the part well, he just doesn't have a very convincing character to portray.  Peter Stormare of course stomps through the screen as Milo (pronounced mee-lo), an immigrant executive who has taken in the American Dream of consumption to its extreme, but Stormare seems to be a good barometer for the general quality of a movie--when he is over-the-top, as in this and in something like Armageddon, it is clear that you are not going to be watching a very good movie.  However, when he is toned down, as in Fargo or (hell) even in Seinfeld as Slippery Pete, you know you are in for a good show.  Henry's wife is more and more uninteresting as she gets nastier and nastier, and even the Hispanic maid is grossly overexaggerrated as she also takes advantage of poor, little Henry.  That Henry has to become faceless to finally stand up for himself is an interesting move, but even when the transition occurs, the deaths are a little too lacking in creativity, and the events just plod along.

Until the Halloween party finally emerges.  The Misfits are on stage, unusual costumes abound, and even when Tom Atkins appears as (guess what) a cop, his appearance is more of a clearing of the air rather than a dreadful move of casting.  The finale shows promise, though the first hour gets to be an unfortunate bear.  I am going to avoid spoiling any endings here, but it might be worth jumping over the first 55 minutes or so to get to the good stuff--no doubt, you'll be able to catch up pretty quickly.

The DVD also has a music video for The Misfits' ""Scream,"" also directed by Romero--evidently, the video was removed from any kind of MTV rotation for being too violent, but it shows a glimpse of the grandfather of gore at some of his most natural work.  Romero has certainly initiated a flood of great horror, and I am glad to see him trying something a little atypical, but I wish he could have worked a little more backwards and let the whole movie swing to a lighter mood.",1192838400,4,2511,4.516556291390729
1637025,3,B00005NQGM,"I was a little disappointed in this George Romero film. Maybe I was expecting a little bit more of the horror aspect of his movies. This is a story of revenge of someone that has lost everything or what Henry perceives as ""everything"". Henry systematically takes his revenge out on anyone that has screwed him over or out of something in his life. It is also a story of a mental breakdown of a ""victim"" and how Henry would deal with it. To me, there are many other movies that are the same and better than this one. Use your discretion on this one.",1188691200,,548,4.278846153846154
1637026,2,B00005NQGM,"This movie was very strange and not very scarey at all. It was more like a long episode of the outer limits that was bad and just wouldnt end. The acting is good and bad. The plot seems to run all over the place. The makeup on the main character is amazing, but the plot and acting doesnt fall through to save this from being all around bad. Jason Flemyng is very good in this movie but the pore man just cant do it alone. The movie also has a very amazing cameo by The Misfits which is awesome. Which leads me to my point if your a huge Misfits fan and collect all the merchendise then pick this one up, however if your just a big horror movie lover pass this one up. This could have been something good, but it just fails big time.",1188259200,,733,4.027397260273973
1637027,3,B00005NQGM,"The best thing I can say about BRUISER is that it isn't totally awful. It isn't great either. I kept waiting for the pace to pick up. Once Henry's odious wife bites the dust, things get fairly interesting, but never overly exciting or thought provoking. Now, I love Romero. I mean, his DEAD films, THE CRAZIES, MARTIN, and CREEPSHOW are all great fun. BRUISER is a so-so movie w/ few jolts or scares, and no real drama. I did enjoy Henry's gruesome daydreams and the basic idea of becoming a faceless killer in order to avenge the wrongs he's suffered. However, the ending seems very long in coming  w/ not much of a payoff for the wait! Oh well, I did like seeing THE MISFITS clowning around...",1176422400,,695,4.47244094488189
1637028,3,B00005NQGM,"BRUISER marked the return of director George Romero after an extended absence.  It's a strange, enigmatic film with its focus on identity, how ""invisible"" some of us can be, and how once afforded an opportunity to rebel, it becomes a Death Wish fantasy.

Jason Flemyng plays the nerdish hero who is humiliated by his boss and unfaithful wife, and who wakes up one morning without a face.  He seeks out all those who have wronged him.

Romero's direction is appropriate and most of the performances are good:  Leslie Hope as the hapless wife of Flemyng's boss; Peter Stormare as the sex-driven and greedy head of Bruiser magazine.  The movie fails to make any real sense and it's ending is darkly perverse.  Not a classic but entertaining in its own weird way.",1170979200,,759,4.748091603053435

1637031,3,B00005NQGM,"I guess I'd have to say that this movie is a bit underrated.  It's not brilliant, and it peters out towards the end, but it's generally well made and sufficiently entertaining.  Lots of people out there seem to be disappointed in this film at least partially because it wasn't what they expected. So I'd better say up front that this really isn't a horror film.  It's pretty much just drama, with a bit of a horrific edge to it, I suppose.  It's certainly not as good as Martin or Dawn or Night, but it's a respectable addition to Romero's filmography.

Here, George is taking on the modern corporate world, (and by extension, modern society as a whole) as is quite popular in film today, as evinced by the severe cult popularity of Office Space and Fight Club.  Bruiser takes a different approach than either of those films. eschewing the comic or black-comic approach for a more straight dramatic approach. (Well, it's actually got a fair bit of dark humor in it, but not enough to classify it as a black comedy)  Lots of people will, I'm sure, find it's approach problematic, as our unnoticed, put-upon protagonist Henry decides to resort to violence (murder) to reclaim his identity, and the film never condemns Henry's actions on any level.(Though it does suggest that he could do other things which would make him happy)  I, for one, don't believe that George Romero is suggesting that we all go out and kill everyone who we feel is using us or treats us badly, but well, that IS what Henry does.  That right there pretty much serves as a plot-synopsis.  We are introduced to Henry, and see how everyone uses him and how miserable he is. He later wakes up with a white mime-face, and decides to take action, reassert himself, and get revenge.  That's about it,  and it works well enough.  The acting is quite good, though the characterization is occasionally problematic.  Flemyng is solid as Henry, he looks just right for the part, and does a fine job throughout the later portion of the film, despite the limitations of the mask.  Everyone is fine, though I do have some problems with Peter Stormare as Henry's boss, and the primary villain of the film.  He's probably best known as the terrifying and taciturn Gaer Grimsley (or something like that) in 'Fargo', but he takes a completely different route this time.  Simply put, his character is too over the top.  I don't doubt that there are at least a couple bosses out their who act a lot as he does, but he's just too much of a spectacle to work completely.  Having him be just as much of a jerk, but in a somewhat less flamboyant way would've been more effective, I think.  But, what can I say, I did dislike his character, as I was supposed to, so it can't be called a real failure.

The film opens up particularly well, and we are introduced to Henry's world quite efficiently.  I think the brief little fantasy sequences are especially effective, and do a good job of showing us the disparity between how Henry acts, and how he actually feels.  The middle section is fine too, if not as good, as he starts to take his revenge, but it dips quite a bit at the end.  The last section of the film, during a huge, wild party, is dragged out too long, and nothing much really happens.  And, it gets a little weird too and overly elaborate for no apparent reason.  And the very last scene of the movie is a bit cheesy and pointless, too.  Still, the film works as a whole.  It's got a nice visual style, with sorta of sleek and beautiful sets which are cold and inhuman as well, just as they ought to be.  Romero's rapid-fire editing is toned down to have more long, calm shots.  I like his older style, but this one fits the film pretty well.  Lots of people dislike the score, but I think it works very well.  It's a bit unconventional, which I like, and it fits the whole tone of the film pretty well.  It's often sad, but in a sorta dull, flat way, nicely representing the dreary, low-key tedium of Henry's life.

That's it.  Certainly not Romero's best, but his fans ought to at least check it out.",1103414400,,4063,4.481632653061224

The premise is strong, the actors are all terrific, and there are a handful of classic Romero scenes that emphasize his humorous and satrical side rather that his flesh-eating side, but the script has a not-quite-finished flavor that keeps the film from being satisfying. Instead of focusing on the main characters, we have a pretty useless subplot involving the police that adds nothing to the film, and the Halloween party climax is badly edited and disappointing.
A good film, but not a great one. If you forget about flesh-eating zombies and pay attention to Romero's scathing, cynical attacks on consumer culture and the loss of identity in the modern world, then you will find this film worth a viewing.",1086220800,,1044,4.9375

Let Me Start Of By Saying If You Plan On Compareing This Film To NOTLD Then Your Not Likely Going To Injoy Bruiser, But In No Way Does That Make It A Bad Film. I Bought This Film After Reading The Liner Notes In The Misfits Album ""Cuts From The Crypt"" Which Contains 2 Of The 4 Misfits Songs Featured In This Film, Which I Will Get To Later. The Film In Short IS Not In My Opinion Horror. But Then Again It's Not Drama, Action, Suspense, SCI-FI, Or Any One Genre Of Film. The Story Is That Of Henry. A Young Bussiness Man Who Works For A Magazine Called Bruiser (Hence The Title). All His Life He Gets Steped On By The People He Trust And Loves Mos. His Wife, His Best Friend, And His Boss. But One Man Can Only Take So Much. One Day He Wakes Up To Discover His Face Has Turned Into A Living Mask. Thus His Revenge Begins. Some Sceans Seem To Linger On A Tad But Not Too Much (The Films Only 99 Minutes Long). Half Of The Film Is Much Of Henrys Stress Which Leads Up To Him Finnaly Standing Up For Him Self. The Second Half Is Pure Revenge. Liek I Said The Deaths Arent Grusome Or Bloody, But To An Extent Thats What Makes Them Seem Very Real. Although The Reason For Henrys Face Turning To A White Mask Is Never Explained It Does Add A Certin Mistique To The Film. And Seeing As His Mask Isn't Like The Run Of The Mill Horror Mask I Say It's A Good Thing.  There Isn't Much Gore Here But The Feel You Get From The Film Seems Very Satisfing. One Of Those Things Were You Love The Killer And Hate The Victims.

1637036,4,B00005NQGM,"After eight years, Romero returns.  This movie, was of course, NOT WHAT I WAS EXPECTING.  Not from George...
However, I enjoyed the movie as it is a odd mix of Kafka's The Metamorphosis meets Joel Schumacher's Falling Down with Michael Douglas.
Poor, meek, downtrodden Henry Creedlow finally wakes up & realizes that human beings are treating him like crap.  He has hallucinations during these bad times about doing the things, and bad things they are, to the whole, insensitive human race.
Henry is getting screwed by life & he ain't gonna take it anymore! He wife is screwing his megalomaniac & sexually charged boss, his best friend in the world is screwing Henry, GEEZ, does this guy get a break? Even the hired help is screwing poor Henry, strangers on the street are rude & the yippy pampered family poodle treats him with contempt!
Until...
Henry gets some HUGE cojones, with the aid of a white mask replacing his face.  Thus, making him the ultimate in an anonymous killers.
Speaking of killers... There is an excellent soundtrack and appearance by The Misfits in an ultimate, hedonistic head banging, party scene.
This isn't REALLY a horror movie, per se.  It is a quietly crafted and sophisticated revenge of the downtrodden picture that I really and truly enjoyed!
Happy Watching!",1081468800,22,1291,4.9036697247706424
1637037,2,B00005NQGM,"Bruiser, written and directed by George A. Romero, legendary horror creator of one of the scariest movies of all time, Night Of the Living Dead, tells a sort of flat tale of what happens when an unassuming mouse of a man wakes one day to find he has lost his face, only to be replaced with a white, featureless mask.  The title refers to a fashion magazine where the lead character works.
Henry Creedlow (Jason Flemyng) is your typical 'nice' guy who struggles with many aspects of his life.  His wife has absolutely no respect for him, claiming he's a loser and going nowhere, while engaging in an affair with Henry's boss (Peter Stormere) who verbally abuses Henry every chance he gets.  Not only that, but Henry's best friend and financial advisor has been stealing from Henry, causing Henry to go deep into debt in his efforts to try and create a lavish house only to satisfy his wife.  Henry's world is a bleak one, fleshed out with revenge fantasies and the occasional thoughts of suicide.
Then, one day, Henry wakes up to find his face is gone.  In its' place is a white, featureless mask which empowers Henry to take matters into his own hands, righting the wrongs, dealing with those, in a rather bloody fashion, who've taken from Henry for so long.
Given this movie was written and directed by George Romero, I was, as probably many others, expecting more than what we got.  There were brief moments of visceral violence, but not nearly as much as I would have expected.  I never really felt a sense of suspense as the faceless terror stalked his victims.  The kinder, gentler horror of George Romero I suppose.  The makeup to create the 'new' Henry certainly looked spooky, but the meandering of the plot squashed any possibilities of chills and thrills out of the movie for me.  And given the fact that there were no likeable characters in the movie, there was no real fondness ever developed, no attachments made, and thus, not much interest when various characters met their fate.  Even the character of Henry never provided any bonding to the audience, as first he is this meek, little man we may feel sorry for, but sympathy is far from liking, and then he turns into this brutal, remorseless killer finally dealing with matters that could he himself let deteriorate to the point they did.
The movie on this disc is presented in wide screen format, and special features include a trailer for this movie and a couple other Lion's Gate releases, production commentary, and a Misfits' music video, as the band, in its' form current to the time, makes an appearance in the movie.  Bruiser had much potential, but lacked the bite I was really looking for...Romero fans will probably be disappointed if they are looking for something along the lines of his other releases like NOTLD, The Crazies, or Martin.  While those movies definitely reside out of the mainstream, this one plops itself right in the center of it, and suffers.",1075593600,,2940,4.707602339181286
1637038,2,B00005NQGM,"George Romero's contributions to the horror genre are legendary. Here is the guy who made ""Night of the Living Dead"" in the late 1960s, single-handedly bringing flesh-eating zombies into the lexicon of millions of horror fans. Two sequels followed with differing levels of success, but Romero's zombie films most importantly inspired several Italian directors, most notably Lucio Fulci and Umberto Lenzi, to churn out a plethora of grue drenched films featuring the shambling dead. Of course, Romero didn't just sit around during the intervals between zombie films; he made other films that, while not as well known as the trilogy of ""Dead"" films, are eerie in there own right. There is, of course, the gritty picture ""The Crazies,"" a film about a viral infection's devastating impact on the residents of a small Pennsylvania town. Another one of these movies is his latest one, ""Bruiser."" ""The Crazies"" was a great, low budget effort that really worked on many levels. Sadly, ""Bruiser"" is a poor vehicle that, in my humble opinion, rarely works on any level and sullies this director's reputation in the horror genre.
Bruiser is the name of a fashion magazine where the film's protagonist, Henry Creedlow, spends his day trying to earn a buck. And work he must, for his life appears to be one huge money pit. His gorgeous wife Janine expects a lot from her husband, like nice cars, fancy clothes, and a huge house decorated with expensive accoutrements. Not content when she receives these nice things, Janine hounds Henry constantly about not standing up for himself. We soon learn that she has a point: Creedlow wines to his stockbroker pal, who just happens to handle Henry's finances, about not earning enough money on his investments. Henry doesn't really do anything drastic, like change brokers, but instead stews quietly to himself about his cash flow problems. More challenges await Henry in the deteriorating relationship with his boss at the magazine. Milos Styles is a world-class jerk; a domineering, spastic dragon who takes great joy in belittling those around him. Although Creedlow has a good relationship with Styles's estranged photographer/mask sculpturing wife, Milos makes him want to scream. But what's a guy in debt up to his eyeballs going to do? Quit? That's out of the question. Instead, Henry Creedlow internalizes his anger, only occasionally indulging in imaginative acts of bloody violence carried out against his persecutors. For example, when a pushy woman elbows her way ahead of Henry at the train station, he fantasizes about pushing her underneath the train and revels in seeing the wheels roll over her head.
Things are about to get worse to the nth degree. Problems arise when he sees wife Janine and boss Milo fooling around at a work party. His wife actually has the nerve, when confronted by Henry about her indiscretions, to argue with him over his meek acceptance of her adultery. This incident is the straw that breaks the proverbial camel's back, and Janine secretly plans to leave her weak willed husband. At this point, something interesting happens. Henry awakens from a night's sleep and discovers his face covered by a mask eerily similar to one Milos's wife gave him the day before. Our hero panics when he realizes the mask is somehow molded to his face, completely impervious to any attempts at removal, and now really is anonymous to the outside world. He uses the mask as a means to get revenge against his oppressors and chooses Janine as his first target. When Creedlow learns how successful the operation against his wife was, he plans other attacks that threaten his embryonic relationship with Milos's wife while bringing in unwanted attention from the police. The movie concludes at a party thrown by Milos for his employees and models, where Creedlow must decide if his ultimate revenge plot is worth risking his life.
I loved the first twenty or thirty minutes of ""Bruiser."" Only a cold-hearted jerk would fail to empathize with Henry's plight. Here's a successful guy who has got it all, and no one pays him an ounce of respect. Romero makes sure that the enemies arrayed against Creedlow adequately embody evil, from the snotty Janine to the overbearing Styles. You just know ""Bruiser"" is going to turn into a revenge film with Creedlow gunning for his enemies. The only question is what type of revenge film we will see, and it is in this aspect that ""Bruiser"" ultimately disappoints. After Creedlow woke up with his white mask, the movie started to drag horribly. I knew I was in trouble when I kept glancing at the clock on the mantle and found myself astonished that only a few minutes had gone by when it felt like hours. This film is horribly arthritic for a revenge picture, with so much time passing between killings that boredom rapidly sets in. Even worse, the murders we do see are rather tepid affairs definitely not worth the wait.
A few things really work for the movie. I can't remember the last time I saw such a stylish film, with characters wearing expensive looking clothing interacting in houses loaded with sumptuous decorations. A few of the characters, particularly Styles's wife, appear downright patrician in their demeanor and appearance. If only Romero had contrasted the posh surroundings with some gritty violence, ""Bruiser"" could have been a real winner. As far as the DVD goes, you get a gore filled music video from The Misfits, a commentary from director Romero, and trailers for ""Bruiser,"" ""O,"" and ""Faust."" You get a nice picture transfer too. Romero will have to do better than this if he wants me to sit down with one of his pictures in the future, however.",1073952000,7,5661,4.935010482180293

he wakes up one day, to find a blank face. he then proceeds to get revenge on those who have done him wrong. the final murder was a little weak, but still a good movie..the misfits did a really good job in the club scene. while the 'fits perform scream, fiend without a face, and bruiser, henry takes a laser and kills his boss who is suspended from the ceiling as if part of the show.

1637050,1,B00005NQGM,"Perhaps what makes this movie so bad is the fact that it could easily have been so good.  With legendary horror director George Romero, and a cameo appearance from the greatest band of all time, the Misfits, ""Bruiser"" seemed like a sure shot.  The surreal, Kafka-esque story that formed its basis was solid, and for the most part, the acting was up to snuff.  So where does this movie fail?  The script.
  It starts out stunningly well, and continues to go strong right up to the point where Henry murders his light-fingered maid.  Unfortunately, from that point on, it quickly disintigrates into greater and greater absurdity, bottoming out with a climax so ridiculous that it left me shaking my head.  The film could have been a harrowing study of the terrible price of revenge on man's soul.  Instead, the protagonist comes off as a twisted role-model for the power and benefits of self-assertion.  Apparently, the most efficient way to take charge of your life is to strangle your wife to death with an extension cord.
  Even through the muck and mire of this film, Romero still manages to serve up some very poignant imagery, and the Misfits video on the DVD edition is great, but I would counsil you to stay away from this movie.  Or if you absolutely must see it, rent it first and check it out before spending your hard-earned money.",1057536000,6,1341,4.67948717948718
1637051,5,B00005NQGM,"Bruiser is a film that many will pass over.  In fact on the box it is obviously trying to lure either Horror fanatics or people into weird movies.  Bruiser is a weird movie and I expected nothing less from George Romero.
Bruiser is about a man who works for an overbearing sexed up boss (who in the beggining flashes his staff) has an unfaithful wife, and best bud who steals thousands of dollars from him.  All this stress, and the fact that he is a nice guy eventually takes it's toll as his face is literally erased.  He became nothing, a no body.
At this point he tries to regain his identity by taking out those wh wronged him.  Despite the premise that it turns into a typical psycho or slasher flick he only targets three people, those who wronged him.  The cops can't trace him, because he has no face.

1637054,1,B00005NQGM,"I have enjoyed the work of George Romero for a long time, however, I must be honest: BRUISER is dreadful ...
 Romero was once a firey film maker, a man who could not only horrify, but do it with style and depth ... And always within a minimal budget ... And while I was not expecting something as monumental as NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD or DAWN OF THE DEAD, I had hopes that the man responsible for those 2 classics, along with other films like MARTIN or CREEPSHOW, still had ""it"" ... Oh, was I disappointed ...

 There is really no excuse for this film's failures ... It looks awful, much like a made-for-TV series from the late 80s ( I fully expected Shannon Tweed to wander aimlessly into any given scene )... The dialog is atrocious, and the ending will leave you wincing and frustrated, due to 2 hours of wasted time ...

 I might add that there is one line in the film that is almost worth the price of a rental ... It's completely unintentional, and delivered in the way only a bad actor can make a serious line laughable - ""Does ... my .... appearance .... scare you ???"" ... yikes :)
 Romero fans might want to rent before buying. however, I completely recommend all fans of horror to steer clear of this mess ... It's not just a bad film, but a sad showing from a once important and meaningful film maker ...",1044144000,2,1317,4.269076305220883
1637055,1,B00005NQGM,"George Romero is definately one of the most interesting directors of his generation. This film however is very poor. It is not really a film, more a badly acted TV movie.
There is a promising premise to the film about a man stripped of his identity and there are parrallels with the Phantom of the Opera and elements of grand guignol. All this however is left to rot in what is simply a mediocre, schlocky, exploitation B-movie, and that makes it sound more interesting than it is. Avoid.
I wonder how talented directors are reduced to making such mediocre product? John Carpenter is another genius who has fallen on hard times.
Do yourself a favour and check out the 'Dead' trilogy, Martin, Knightriders, Season of the Witch and The Crazies (the last two not available on DVD), to see Romero at his innovative best.",1041552000,,816,4.673611111111111

This is ""Bruiser"" Country. In Psychologicalville, the 'tude toward this film's lead is--""it's Henry's fault. His wife wouldn't have cheated on him, his boss wouldn't have treated him like dog meat, his best friend wouldn't have betrayed him, if Henry hadn't let them. Henry has to take responsibility for his actions. He should stop having a pity party, yadayada."" So he fights back instead. Having no face, he thinks he's allowed.
Instead of getting Ophra opened some afternoon, so Dr. Phil can stick his big fat head inside you and come on like he owns you, see instead ""Bruiser."" It is a tonic against the bull dozers who justify their own and others who all are ""little murderers."" They take pieces of you, like the people in the film take pieces of Henry, who is so used to it, he doesn't really think about it anymore. That's how they win.
The mask means no one ever notices him, so why have a face? It could also symbolize the comedy and tragedy masks, and perhaps a nod to mimes who are never heard and little noticed these days. Perhaps Anthony Newley's white face clown, Littlechap, from ""Stop the World.."" might also be in the mix. People get treated like clowns, by blowhards who know the scum rises to the top, and that's how to fit in with most of society.
 The murders are great fun. Very cathartic. They remind me of a line from an ""Outer Limits"" episode in which a man is explaining why he killed another man in cold blood. The ""victim"" had been hurting the man's sister. He was asked to stop. He did not. So, what was the difference between his sister being murdered by the inch, and killing her tormentor all at once?
 ...--their kind. is done constantly. It is legal. You commit it by word and by silence and by betrayal. And you have the clean up boys come along and make you feel guilty because people have done these things to you. ""Bruiser"" hits the spot, feels good, has a wonderful head knock-yes...--ending.

Romero delves into PHANTOM OF THE OPERA territory as Creednow sets out for revenge on his sleazy boss, his unfaithful wife and his scummy best friend. Though visually interesting and initially intriguing with a unique jazz soundtrack, BRUISER is not one of Romero's masterworks, but his fans will enjoy it anyway.

It's violent, strange, disturbing at times...only rarely ""horrific"" by modern standards, as few shocks are administered.  Still and all, a very good film that makes us question who we are.

1637080,2,B00005NQGM,"I always welcome any works by great creators of this genre -- I even went to theater to watch John Carpenter's vampire flick -- and the name of George A. Romero never fails to interest me.  But his newest film, made after 8 year absence since not-so-good ""The Dark Half,"" is a big disappontment.
Jason Flemyng is Henry, who is leading an unhappy life with his unfaithful wife.  At his office, uncompromising tyranny of his  boss is waiting for him.  One day, he finds his face is turned into total blank as if completely erased -- like a white mask he saw at the party last night.  Is this a chance to do something he normally can't?  Or is this a curse?  So, what he's gonna do?
Though the idea is original, Romero fails to develop it fully, being content with the initial half-baked concept.  I am sorry to say this, and I don't change my attitude to this respected director, but I think Romero needs to show what he wants to do in the film.  Sometimes the film is unexpectedly funny (the ending scene is pretty funny and cool), and sometimes scary (especially his first reaction to his housemaid), and those parts are OK, I admit.  But Romero seems to find too much sense in Henry's white, expresionless face.  Is he going to revenge all the people who bullied him in the past?  Or should he stop, listening to a piece of good advice his female friend kindly gives?  Between those options Henry wavers -- and I know that's supposed to be the point -- but the film takes too much time to show his conflict, which is a too obvious one.  Romero's horror masterpieces in the past indeed dealt with these philosophical topics, but not so heavy-handedly to destory the good pace of the entire film.
And in the end, Henry does what he does in the most contrived fashion, using laser, with the sound of The Misfits (who also appears).  I admire Romero's usually underrated works, which are sometimes unduely labeled ""cult"" films, but here, in ""Bruiser,"" he put more ponderous things than he should have.",1019174400,7,1998,4.5264623955431755

1637083,4,B00005NQGM,"""Bruiser"" begins very well, yet in the last half hour dwindled somewhat into a more routine formula. Nonetheless, it still had me enthrawled- Romero's perfect pacing, framing and editing is as bold as ever. Also the subdued/over-the-top use of music impressed me greatly. His recurring theme of what makes a person who they are is revived- a similar theme being found in earlier films ""The Dark Half"" and ""Martin"". Yet, I must say I was miss-led. I think this films advertising campaign is completely wrong for the movies content. From the front cover I was expecting just another slasher film- and this does not do this film justice. If it hadn't been for the words ""A George Romero film"" I would have skipped this movie and grabbed another off the shelf. Bruiser is everything you wouldn't expect and in many ways reaches into a very David Lynchian vein- although Lynch did this better in his ""Lost Highway."" But I still had a ripsnorting time with this feast... It has a different atmosphere and flavour to Romero's earlier work, but his macabre sense of humour prevails. There are times I was unsure of whether to laugh or cringe- this being Romero's truly horrific trademark (it was perfected in Dawn of the Dead). If only the high sense of tension and frustration could have been held ... the film has a dissapointing and un-convincing ending. But it is with high hopes that I await for Romero's adaptation of Stephen Kings ""The Girl who loved Tom Gordon"" - if there ever was an example of perfect director to suit perfect material- it was this. Bruiser is a film that SHOULD be seen on DVD- the VHS transfer (in Australia anyway) is really terrible. This film is interesting, intreauging and very un-conventional. George A. Romero is a very tallented man , but lets all be honest- aren't we all hoping his next will be truly terrifying? Bruiser hits us on an intellectual level, but I still cannot help wanting to be hit in the face with a bucket of blood, intestines and brains.

Well, one day he wakes up with a kabuki mask glued to his face, becomes a metaphorical 'invisible man' and goes on a killing spree, and by now you should know where you stand on this film.  There are no zombies, none of the malevolence or social commentary that punctuated Romero's past films, and, maybe most appallingly, nothing ORIGINAL about ""Bruiser"" (save for the strong production values and expert direction).  It doesn't take a rocket scientist to see the parallels between this and ""The Crow,"" another film that had nothing original to say but was immortalized all the same.  As the masked revenger, Jason Flemyng is just too nice, even when he's picking off his enemies; the always-charismatic oddball Peter Stormare is wasted in a one-note performance as a sexist magazine editor, his presence reduced to yammering lines like a loon.

1637086,4,B00005NQGM,"Bruiser (George Romero, 2000)
George Romero and the Hollywood mainstream have been making moves towards compromise for almost thirty years now. Romero's been getting less graphic in relation to the rest of the world, and the rest of the world has been getting more graphic in relation to him. Because of this, it should be no surprise to anyone that some of the purists (actually, quite a few of them) have labelled Romero a sellout or worse, leading to the commercial failures of Monkey Shines (a fine movie) and The Dark Half (a not so fine movie), and Romero's subsequent self-removal from the film world for seven long years. He returns with Bruiser, a film which never received theatrical distro in the United States. Thankfully, someone at Lion's Gate had the sense to at least put the VHS and DVD out over here in preparation for Romero's first bonafide blockbuster, an adaptation of King's The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon due out in 2002.
Bruiser is another slice of Romero's favorite pie-- an examination of the role of the outcast in a satirized version of society. Twenty years ago, Romero enjoyed forcing his point home with buckets of gore, but he's grown up a little these days and gone out on a limb. Bruiser is, for the most part, gore-free, leaving us to ask ourselves whether Romero's filmmaking style alone is enough to make Bruiser as relevant as Knightriders, as savage as Dawn of the Dead, and/or as heartbreaking as Martin. My answer, after a few days of reflection, is a qualified yes.
I say ""qualified"" because, while the subject matter is unmistakably Romero, the style of direction here is just as unquestionably Argento. This is a giallo film without the violence and with more of a backing story; Romero has replaced the gore with Argento's operatic, sweeping style of filmmaking. So the gimmick hasn't disappeared as much as it has changed.
In the new episode of Pie a la George, Everyman, known here as Henry Creedlow (Jason Flemyng, late of _From Hell_ and every Guy Ritchie film ever made), wakes up one morning and realizes two things: a. he's losing it, and b. he may have never had it in the first place. Henry Creedlow's first morning as these revelations come to him is filled with fantasties of violent things he'd like to do to himself and others (cf. Jennifer Connelly's forking of Sean Gullette in Requiem for a Dream last year). While this is happening, he comes to realize that no one he knows actually thinks about him in anything more than a surface way, including his boss Miles (Peter Stormare, of Chocolat, 8MM, Playing God, et [many] al.), his wife Janine (Nina Garbiras, recently of the short-lived TV series ""The $treet,"" who bears more than a passing resemblance to the ""dream girl"" in Argento's Tenebre), and his high school chum/stockbroker James (Andrew Tarbet, known for The Famous Jett Jackson... heh). The two revelations eventually coalesce to turn Henry into something of a nasty bent-on-being-noticed sociopath.
Many reviews of the film seem to be panning it for relative lack of acting skills; I didn't see it that way at all. Some characters come off as artificial, but they're supposed to be, a la Argento or (as an even better example) Joe Mantegna in Mamet's House of Games. It's all part of the satire. this isn't, thankfully, society as we know it; just as the shopping mall zombies of Dawn of the Dead were American consumer culture, the shallow husks we are handed here are Hollywood power-structure culture. They're no less mindless for not being caked with blue makeup and covered with the blood of their recent meals.
Bruiser is definitely worth a look, especially if seven years of Romerolessness have had you climbing the walls. While its lack of groundbreaking psyche-related revelations don't put it in the same class as Dawn of the Dead or Martin, it's good, solid filmmaking. *** 1/2
(one other note I couldn't pass up. Having The Misfits in the movie without Glenn Danzig is kind of like putting Sammy Hagar in front of the E Street Band and selling it as a Springsteen show. The new vocalist has a better voice than Glenn Danzig ever dreamt of, but... jeez, it's the MISFITS, you know?)",1007078400,2,4166,4.779472954230235
1637087,2,B00005NQGM,"This latest effort from ""The Godfather of Zombies"",wreaks of desperation,lethargy,and contempt for his fans. What truly disappointed me was the blatant mysogyny,something that's becoming a habit for MR. Romero. He seemed to have a certain amount of respect for Women in his dead films,they were headstrong,intelligent,and capable of defending themselves(with the exception of Night 68).In this film,most of the women are portrayed as man crazy,promiscuous,lower class sexpots(i expect this type of behavior from Argento,but he's always been about that).It seems as though the abuse that women endure in this film(real and imagined)is a reflection of Romero's own secret hatred for the audience. It's beginning to become clear that the dead series is all he can do effectively,all his other offerings were average at bestThere is nothing to recommend about this film,it fails on almost every level from direction,cinematography,sound,characterization,acting,and narrative. The whole ""experiment""feels like an excercise in pandering to the potential new crop of fans,some who have no idea who he is. A once intelligent,insightful,classy director's attempt at a  comeback of sorts,comes across as a pathetic dirty old man in the process. I urge anyone even thinking about buying this to rent it first. I'm patiently waiting for the 4th installment of the dead series,it's the only thing that can get this bad taste out of my mouth.",1004313600,,1428,5.580645161290323
1637088,5,B00005NQGM,"Loss of identity is the key aspect of this striking film about an ordinary man who gets walked over by everyone he knows. The result of not sticking up for himself is a plain white mask which has replaced his face. Thats when the fun begins. Combined with humor, action, and little bit of gore, Bruiser turned out to be a very good movie.",1003795200,,338,4.296875
7947772,2,B00005NQGM,"It was pretty good at the start, but then I got bored half way through, and hardly made it to the end.  Not the least bit scary.

Night of the Living Dead, it was not even close.  Romaro should have quit while he was ahead.  2.5 Stars.",1524182400,,235,3.9361702127659575
7947773,3,B00005NQGM,"Bruiser is a movie that could've been much better, were it actual written as a horror movie. The premise is of a weakling man who spends his life attempting to make the other people in his life happy, only to get taken advantage of at every turn. After his boss, his wife and his best friend show him their true colors, he loses the last bit of will he has to remain sane, and wakes to find he's become his own faceless avenger. Behind a featureless white mask, he sets out to settle the score with those who've wronged him. More of a revenge story with a few scary moments, it seems to have been watered down in an attempt to reach a broader audience. There's a cameo by Michael Graves era horror-punk band Misfits, which is cool if you are into them. Overall, this is really not Romero's best. If you are a completist, it won't kill you to own this movie. If you area looking for something to really scare you, I'd skip over this one.",1516492800,,936,4.264044943820225
