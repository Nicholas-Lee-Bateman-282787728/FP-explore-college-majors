6408806,5,B00KA0VEGO,"I cannot believe this aired on NBC, or any broadcast network. It carries the same malicious heft that the stupendous original did. Don't listen to the critics, they just hate all remakes. I was leary of this one as soon as I heard it was being remade, due to my absolute love of the first. I had nothing to worry about. Zaldana brings her own vibe to Rosemary, something that could have been very easy to foul up. The real stars here are Jason Isaacs and Carole Bouquet. Isaacs is positively devilish in the best of ways, in a role I was sure he was miscast in, boy did he prove me so wrong. Bouquet... where do I start? She is simply astonishing here. Every one of her scenes she shreds like a master. I could watch her and Isaacs in these roles forever!

In the end, there are elements of this update that I love more than the original, and that is saying something. Don't hesitate, buy right now!",1401235200,9,899,4.288235294117647

6408808,5,B00KA0VEGO,"I don't know if anyone remembers or knows of NBC's Sunday Night At The Movies series that ran from 1981 to 2000 but when the first half of this first aired on Sunday night on May 11th, I kind of felt like they were going a bit retro and I really enjoyed that. Sorry, I'm a big nostalgia fan!

This 2 part mini-series remakes, stars Zoe Saldana as the soon to be trouble mother, Rosemary, while Patrick J. Adams stars as her husband, Guy.

In this remake, Rosemary and Guy move from New York City to Paris, France and rent out an admirable apartment, looking to start their lives over together. Soon after they find comfort in locals and neighbors Roman and Margaux Castevet who become very involved in their lives. Rosemary ends up becoming pregnant, while Guy's career as a writer, elevates. Meanwhile, Guy's co-worker, Julie as well as Margaux begin spending a lot of time with Rosemary and Margaux informs Rosemary that herbs and holistics will help with her pregnancy.

After Margaux performs a spell on soup that she was preparing for Rosemary, Rosemary's health declines in the worst way and she ends up in the hospital. After Rosemary miraculously recovers, she becomes suspicious of her doctor and the Castevets and feels that there's more to this evil French couple than they're letting on. After Rosemary discovers a shocking revelation about the apartment they're living in, its past, and an evil secret about Roman Castevet, she pleads with Guy to leave France but he thinks its all in her mind.

Along the way, Rosemary's closest peers who get too closely bonded with Rosemary to try and help her, are met with unfortunate and gruesome deaths. Once Rosemary puts the pieces together, she realizes what the Castevets are up to and how her soon to be born baby is linked to Satan himself.

Overall: Despite what the negative critics may say, this mini-series remake was a treat to watch. Unlike the movie, this setting takes place outside of the US and in France, which adds an overall exciting and different element with the characters involved in this. Because both 2 hour episodes equal 4 hours, you may tend to lose a bit of focus at times but it's not long before it grabs your attention again as the plot thickens and so do our characters. In addition, I was also expecting there to be quite a bit of controversy about Saldana playing the main character as Rosemary due to racial reasons, but fortunately, there were none....that I know of. Overall, you'll have to build up the courage to keep yourself watching this for 4 hours, otherwise you may lose interest in it. I can't speak for everyone, but I truly enjoyed this remake of the original and can't wait for it to be released on DVD",1400112000,8,2705,4.662473794549266

6408818,3,B00KA0VEGO,not nearly the psycho thriller of the Polanski original - why re-do a masterpiece in the first place? See the original,1423353600,,118,4.666666666666667
6408819,3,B00KA0VEGO,"Remakes have a place in film and television history, but this remake could not hold a candle to the original masterpiece, either the book by Ira Levin or the film by Roman Polanski.  Aspects of the original book and film are clearly dated today, and this remake brought things up to speed as best they could.  However, where this falls short is putting a lot of things before you rather than the subtle nuances of the original.  Plus, the miniseries died in television 25+ years ago, and giving this the two part treatment of two nights on television really was not necessary.

Rosemary Woodhouse (played well by a stronger yet still dainty Zoe Saldana) and her husband Guy have moved to Paris, France as her husband's work has taken them to a university where he hopes to work.  One day Rosemary intercepts a mugger who dropped a wallet.  Inside the wallet, Rosemary finds the owner, Margo Castevet (updated from the older sounding Minnie).  To thank her for being so kind, Margo invites Rosemary and Guy to a party, and from there their friendship begins.  In this version, Rosemary is not dismayed by the sudden and generous friendship of the Castevets, but she sees them as equals rather than friendly older people.  She finds it a bit odd, but dismisses it ultimately as their new friends being helpful and genuinely interested in her and Guy.  Suddenly, Guy's rival for the first position chair at the university dies a horrible death, and he is now in the front running for department chair.  Things are all of a sudden coming up roses for them and Rosemary is eager to get pregnant and start their family.  When she shares this with Margo and Roman, they are caring for her night and day, so excited for her baby to be born.  Little does she know that she has been tricked into having the devil's child, as Margo and Roman are witches (as well as their friends who are all part of a coven) and are bringing Satan back to the world.

The acting was good in this movie, but they added in a few things in for modernization.  When Rosemary and Guy learn of the Trench sisters who lived in the apartment building years before practicing cannibalism, we see it rather than are left to imagine.  The friends who come to terrible ends who are trying to help her see the truth (ex. Hutch) are seen rather than left in the distance.  While all the older people in the witch coven in the original are grey haired, wrinkled and dress out of date, the witch coven tries to make themselves look as young and chipper as possible without looking like residents of an assisted living facility.  In general, people do not like to look and act their age anymore.  They add in a touch of homosexuality (as it's cute and trendy for women to do so now), to see the evil Satan at the moment of conception, and pay homage to Mia Farrow's pixie cut when Zoe gets a horrible haircut (which looks terrible on her but gave Mia a certain edge about her at the time.)  And, partially due to the fact that the original film was made in the 1960s and the technology did not exist at the time, we never saw the horrible creature that the baby is.  In this version, we see the creature, which is a normal looking baby with magnetic blue eyes like his father, Satan.  In this version, Rosemary still accepts the fact that this child is hers.  I was hoping for something drastically different, but what mother could resist her child?

I will give compliments to the fact that this adaptation managed to stay true to the old school kind of horror feeling.  Even though full frontal violence is seen, we still get the sense that they are coming for her and her paranoia is real.  Moving the scene to Paris, in that sense, was a welcome change from the original, in that in the original you wondered why she didn't go to a friend once she realized everyone was in on it, but it made more sense since she is completely isolated from friends and family who might help her.  It will pass a lonely night or rainy afternoon.  Have fun with it.",1422748800,2,4007,4.47455295735901

6408825,5,B00KA0VEGO,"I will begin by saying this: THIS REMAKE CANNOT HOLD A CANDLE TO THE ORIGINAL POLANSKI MOVIE WITH MIA FARROW AND RUTH GORDON!  That is because arguably Polanski's movie was so exquisite and carefully cast that it is probably the best movie ever made.  In it's own way, though, this modernized sequel has merit.  The actress who plays Rosemary is remarkable in her role, a very believable actress.  I LOVE PARIS FRANCE SO IT WAS A HUGE ADDED BONUS FOR ME THAT THIS FILM TAKES PLACE THERE!  The woman who replaces ""Ruth Gordon"" thankfully is cast as somebody completely different because you are not going to find another Ruth Gordon!  The only improvement on the  original masterpiece is the ending because they actually showed the baby and I always felt ripped off right at the end of the original when Mia Farrow looks into the bassinet and the credits come on; however, this film was not daring enough to show horns and tail.  Can't win 'em all.  This movie I believe will be especially interesting to somebody who never saw the original; for me, though it had it's own form of fascination just to see how they can try to transform the original; guess it was a real sign of the times because she looked up Roman Castevet on the computer; can't compare to 1968 when they didn't exist; the drama was better without modern technology!  As a side note in the original film the devil was SCARY AND UGLY and had yellow eyes, not so in this film, the devil looked like some blue eyed player at a nightclub. And one last thing; please don't enter this blindly and by that I mean if you already have seen the original keep in mind you cannot compete with a masterpiece so look upon this with new eyes because otherwise expect the obvious; IT PALES IN COMPARISON.",1414281600,,1755,4.525316455696203

6408832,4,B00KA0VEGO,"I really enjoyed this movie very much. It was nice to have a modern take on the original. Don't get me wrong, the classic version is the best, but this movie is also good. It had diversity. French culture, and a black and white couple. It was easy to hate the bad guys in the original, but it was harder for me to hate the bad guys in this one. Roman made sure that Guy showed Rosemary the support she needed, and Margot was such a class A manipulator coated in sumptuous caramel. The acting was more realistic, and better in some areas. The characters seemed more real. Guy clearly held on to a lot of guilt, versus the original Guy portraying a heartless bastard- but of course we all know that John Cassavetes was luscious, yet excellent at portraying a bastard in some roles. I felt that the modern Rosemary was more trusting and easily sucked into the deception, and then it was too late. However, I felt that the modern Rosemary should have taken longer to piece together the puzzle. She had it pieced together in about ten minutes, whereas the original Rosemary really entertained us while she took some time to piece everything together, more suspense.  I was expecting to see a mutated demon-from-hell baby, but was surprised to see an angelic baby that could be featured in a Huggies commercial. Overall, 4 stars.",1411171200,,1323,4.582278481012659
6408833,2,B00KA0VEGO,"A part of me has such mixed feelings about all these remakes of various classic movies that now have Black starring characters. Not because I am against seeing diversity, but because Id rather see money put into original media than rehashes of old media. Especially when, in films like Rosemarys Baby, all that seems to change is the skin tone. There is no cultural adaptation, or even a recognition that something has changed in comparison to the original, it is just a darker face which once was played by a white person. For more on the film, look below.

Characters & Story

If youve seen the original, not much has changed structure wise. A young woman and her husband find themselves moving into a building with strange owners; the wife is unemployed, but not without things to do; and as her husband finds himself rising both economically and socially, she finds him changing in ways which makes him not seem like the man she fell in love with. And while, at first, she has a decent relationship with her neighbors, her landlords in this film, as time wears on they become odder and odder, and while she slightly questions things, she never pursues running away from the situation fully. This is despite multiple warnings, horrible nightmares, and coincidental murders which would be red flags for normal people. But with things going well, until nearly the end, there is the question of how ignorant is Rosemary and why was this film remade?

Praise

A part of me feels like Zoe Saldana should be applauded for becoming the new Halle Berry. Someone who looks exotic, has the ability to come off vulnerable or strong, and can bring that to any role. Something which helps ease the boredom which comes with watching Rosemarys Baby, especially if youve seen the original.

Criticism

However, like with the many remakes that decide to put a physical racial spin on things, you are sort of left wondering what was the point? For while the Whitney Houston and Brandy starring Cinderella,  Dorothy Dandrige in Carmen Jones, and maybe this years Annie maybe an exception, generally it just seems like the money put into these remakes could have gone to better places. Take for example: rather than do a remake of a well-known movie, and use the name of the movie and a few recognizable actors as the basis of why people should watch, why not make something original or inspired? What was really keeping Rosemarys Baby from taking place in Louisiana and adapting things to which perhaps Hollywoods perception of Voodoo could have been used in lieu of Satanism? I mean, while there are some remakes which many have fallen in love with, and would argue are on par, or better, than the original, when movies are simply new faces in old roles; a modern retelling; or even race swaps which either don't seem culturally influenced, or are done for some shallow type of diversity, it makes me wonder who is the person so willing to throw money away on media like this?

Overall: Skip It

As said in the overview, just watch the original. For while Saldana certainly isn't horrible as Rosemary, at the same time you can see she is more so channeling Mia Farrow than making this her role and trying to make you feel any of this is original. I guess, like the Psycho remake of the 90s, this film wanted to cash in on a known brand with new actors. Something which it doesnt succeed in doing in any sense since the film tries to change things to create some sense of originality, but in the end it feels like no one really wanted to put their own spin on things and only changed things just enough so no one could say this was a modernized shot for shot remake to add onto its deserved criticism.",1410652800,2,3685,4.63093415007657
6408834,2,B00KA0VEGO,"Why a mini-series?  Nothing against the actors, but this movie was waaaay too long.  We all know what's really going on to begin with, so there was no need to stretch this out into two parts.  Valium doesn't work as well as this flick when it comes to relaxation.  Can't sleep?  Put on this remake, child.",1410566400,2,305,4.375
6408835,2,B00KA0VEGO,"ROSEMARY'S BABY - the original 1968 film version directed by Roman Polanski - was smart, stylish, sardonic, sensational and superb - all the things, indeed, that this needless remake is not.  This allegedly ""modern"" retelling is, in fact, what it actually is: and that is a TV movie fatiguingly drawn out to accommodate its every-few-minutes commercial breaks - so, therefore, it is laden with all the myriad and predictable cliff-hanging moments indicative of those coming commercial breaks.  Of course, there are no actual commercials during the film on this DVD - except for the irritating previews one must either watch or skip through to get to the main event - but the rapid succession of fade-to-blacks are the ""fingerprints"" of this production's primary commercial function. In short, it is dragged out and padded and instead of keeping viewers on the edge of their seat, it is equally likely to cause one to snuggle back in their seat - and possibly even doze off.

It isn't that this take on Ira Levin's classic is awfully bad - it just isn't terribly good.  In listening to the director and star/producer Zoe ""Rosemary"" Saldana talk of their undertaking and the need to offer this day and age a newer perspective on Rosemary's character just made me laugh - for there is nothing in this vision and version of Rosemary that isn't in the character as first exquisitely embodied by Mia Farrow - and, in all honestly, there is a far amount less.  Also postulated - especially by director Agnieszka Holland - is that in her version she tried to offer up not so much a horror tale, but a psychological one wherein viewers never quite know what is real or what is merely imagined by Rosemary in her eventually pregnant and possibly paranoidal state.  But this is hogwash!  Yes, indeed, such a perspective can be most definitely applied to the Polanski version - until the last, chilling moments.  However, we see the Devil in the first few minutes in Holland's film.  We also are privy to a series of gratuitously violent rub-outs of various characters who get too close to the truth of the very-real witchery involved.  And this body-count of deaths-by-Devil are so imitative in style and feel to the killings in THE OMEN, that this miniseries seems like a weird hybrid of both ROSEMARY'S BABY and THE OMEN.

One saving grace:  Jason Isaacs (playing the Satan sycophant) is always a pleasurable pain to watch, ever since his evil incarnate turn in THE PATRIOT.  French actress Carole Bouquet as his sincerely hypocritical wife is also a delight.  But Patrick Adams doesn't fit in John Cassavetes shoes and hardly seems to be wearing any all his own, and Zoe Saldana is, well, no Mia Farrow.  And not that she should be - except, in not bringing anything new and unique to the role herself, well, comparisons are inevitable.  Curiously, on the back of the DVD we are told in fairly large letters without quotation marks or critical attribution that ZOE SALDANA HYPNOTIZES.  But she really doesn't.  And how curious that nowhere on the DVD casing are any of the others actors (with the exception of Patrick Adams) even mentioned, nor is the director or any of the production team.  Well, with four Saldanas as producers - including the film's star - I suspect these omissions may very well have been by commission.

One good thing: given the coming Halloween season my appetite has been whetted to watch ROSEMARY'S BABY again - the Polanski version, that is.",1409875200,10,3461,4.804384485666104
6408836,5,B00KA0VEGO,Just What I Thought It Was,1409788800,,26,3.5
6408837,4,B00KA0VEGO,"Theres two ways you can react to a new version of Rosemarys Baby. The first one is to completely write it off and make the assumption that no one could do a better job of adapting Ira Levins bestseller than Roma Polanski did in 1968. The other reaction is to take it as a new vision of the book that isn't trying to be a remake of the first movie and enjoy or hate it for what it is according to its own merits.

I think the one thing we can all agree on is that if the Satanic Panic-type films of the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s are going to be introduced to a whole new generation of viewers, theres no better place to start than with Rosemarys Baby. After all, it really is where the trend began for mainstream moviegoers.

Young Rosemary Woodhouse (Zoe Saldana) and her husband (Patrick J. Adams) move to Paris after he is offered a job there. After a residential fire, the couple are invited to live in a luxurious apartment by landlords Roman (Jason Isaacs) and Margaux Castevet (Carole Bouquet). Rosemary becomes pregnant and her eccentric neighbors shower her with kindness and devotion. She begins to suspect they're only after one thing following an investigation into the buildings mysterious ties to the occult. Rosemary believes the supportive bunch are a coven of witches looking to sacrifice her baby to stay young.

Theres no doubt in my mind that everyone involved in the new version of Rosemarys Baby was dedicated to the project. Zoe Saldana completely embraces her role as the damaged-yet-hopeful Rosemary, who desperately wants to do the right thing for her unborn child. Jason Isaacs and Carole Bouquet are deliciously wicked playing the reserved but extremely persuasive Castevets.

Rosemarys Baby is not rated. However, I would give it a PG-13 rating for adult situations, sensuality, and disturbing images. Theres a bit of gore and some sex scenes without nudity.

Theres no heavy religious message to be found within Rosemarys Baby. If it teaches you anything, its that you need to be careful what you're willing to sacrifice for material success and temporary happiness. Although it deals with Satan and his powers, its not evangelical in any form and doesnt preach at the viewer in regards to their spiritual life.

The DVD version of ""Rosemary's Baby"" contains some limited bonus material. Two featurettes explore behind the scenes of the movie in ""Fear is Born: The Making of 'Rosemary's Baby'"" and ""Grand Guignol: Parisian Production Design."" The cast and crew are interviewed about their roles in the film and expand on filming in the most romantic city on Earth.

People who have never seen Roman Polanskis Rosemarys Baby and haven't read anything about it will no doubt enjoy this updated version more than those already exposed to the classic tale. I found it to be entertaining and thrilling at times. Was it as good as Polanskis 1968 version? I wouldnt say so. Did it seem to dig a little deeper and expand on the concept more than the original? Yes, considering it was a two-part movie and had around 34 minutes more to flesh things out.",1409270400,3,3071,4.772128060263653
6408838,5,B00KA0VEGO,Modernized version of the old movie.  It works focusing on young Rosemary Woodhouse's suspicions that her neighbors may belong to a Satanic cult who are hell bent on getting one thing: the baby she is carrying. Still like the original better,1409270400,,241,4.878048780487805
6408839,1,B00KA0VEGO,So says the female protagonist. Terrible letdown vs. the 1968 original. Reinforces the cliche that remakes are not a good idea.

6408842,2,B00KA0VEGO,"Some movies shouldn't be remade no matter how tempting it is to see Zoe Saldana in her underwear.  But, I guess after 46 years NBC figured why not?  There is a whole new generation out there, perhaps two, who have no awareness of the original movie (1968), or Ira Levin's book (1966) that it was based on.  So, we get this glamorous redux, set in Paris no less, with the major characters bearing the same names.  I guess Castevet sounds French, no?  Of course Guy and Rosemary are Americans in Paris, who soon find themselves enjoying the good graces of the very handsome Castevets.

In an interview before the premier, Zoe said it took a great deal of ""cajones"" to go back to the classic and give it a bold new look.  That would have been fine if the two-part mini-series offered a daring new interpretation.  Instead, all we get is a reshuffling of the narrative and characters like a pack of tarot cards, bringing the story up to the 21st century.  It seems Zoe was the driving force behind this movie, making it her baby, so to speak, dragging in her siblings as co-producers.  Agnieszka Holland appeared to be there to steer things, not direct the movie.  It didn't strike me as her style at all.

Perhaps the most jarring aspect is the lack of humor, which is what made the original story so disarming.  What we get here is a very earnest film with very earnest performances.  The devil is made manifest right from the start, so there is no mystery, let alone suspense here.  Rather than a doddering coven of old witches, we get immaculately dressed middle-aged witches living in one of the most exclusive addresses in Paris, the Chimera.  The building itself looks straight out of the Art Nouveau era.  There isn't even a grimy basement where Rosemary first met Terry doing laundry and learned about the Castavets.  Instead, we see a woman, apparently of some ancient Turkish descent, jump off the balcony, and Rosemary spends the rest of the movie trying to figure out why.  We know this is going to be a sinister movie, and have no trust in the Castevets.

Recasting guy as an English professor and writer also wasn't a very wise move.  Getting tenure is not something you just happen into, especially at his tender age.  Being an actor was perfect, as all it took was a lucky break, which Guy got when a rival actor was all the sudden struck blind.  Guy was on his way.  Instead, we get a gruesome scene where the apparently much better qualified woman (judging by the stack of books she carries) loses her mind, stabbing the interviewer, with the scene ending in a bloody heap, literally.  Where is the ""wit and cajones"" here?  Of course, young Guy (woodenly played by Patrick J. Adams) gets the job, thanks to Roman who is a professor at the same university and has his connections.  The Woodhouses move from their cramped teachers' dorm to the Chimera, right into the waiting arms of the Castevets.  The creative juices soon start to flow.

The good conscience is played by Christina Cole as Julie.  She is best friends with Zoe and apparently Guy's former lover.  Or, was it an act of indiscretion at some point?  I wasn't exactly sure.  She is an aspiring chef in Paris and gets together with Rosemary in cooking class from time to time.  Julie is an amalgamation of several characters from the original story.  She senses something is amiss during Ro's pregnancy and gets her another doctor, who has the benefit of ultrasound to see the devil within.  You know things are not going to end well for Julie.

With Hutch out, Zoe or Agnieszka decided to create a police commissioner, Msr. Fontaine, to act as the second voice of conscience.  He is well played by Olivier Rabourdin.  You're not quite sure whether he is part of the coven or not.  One of the few mysteries in this movie.  Zoe comes to put all her faith in him, but it is a foregone conclusion how this film will turn out.  The poor commissioner doesn't stand a chance against the likes of the Castevets.

Roman and Margaux are quite a departure from the original, but it was a master stroke to cast Carole Bouquet as Margaux.  She is ravishing and devious, orchestrating events like the devil herself, although as in the original we find out that Roman is the latest reincarnation of the devil, a lineage he has carried forth in Rosemary.  No real surprise here, but Jason Isaacs fits the role well.  So, yes, this movie ends the same as did the first, otherwise it wouldn't be Rosemary's Baby.",1407974400,4,4471,4.581336696090794

6408844,3,B00KA0VEGO,"The major problem with the story is that we know it. If you don't know the story of ""Rosemary' Baby"" stop reading reviews right now and go watch it and I would suggest the newer version to newer audience. Pardon my sacrilege. Having said that, placing the story in France doesn't really add anything to the tale. With the surprise element gone and not having to figure out the mystery, the film needs an ""A"" game to distinguish itself. Unfortunately this film doesn't get interesting until after the pregnancy.

Like most made for TV offerings, the acting was uneven. Zoe Saldana was acceptable. Patrick J. Adams was bland.",1404691200,,623,4.768518518518518
6408845,2,B00KA0VEGO,"There are a few car accident scenes in this movie.  But in truth, the entire production is one mesmerizing car crash.

There was no need to remake Rosemary's Baby.  I viewed the original for the first time two years ago, and it didn't seem so dated as to warrant a new version.  The original is a classic; this is forgettable.  What's worse, this version is very long.  In its television ""miniseries"" broadcast, it was split into two movie-length parts.  The only thing worse than a bad movie is a long bad movie.

What's different between the two versions?  Plot-wise, not much at all.  Some of the few significant changes, though, are off the mark and only serve to distract the viewer.  First and foremost among them:  Rosemary is black!  Casting decided to fill the role memorably portrayed by Mia Farrow with a black actress that I've never heard of before...within a script that completely ignores the fact that she's black.  She and her white husband, Guy, are urban Americans residing in France, and yet Rosemary is the whitest American black woman next to Halle Berry:  soft-spoken, delicate, dainty, and actually emulative of Mia Farrow's depiction of the character, which this movie was reputedly meant to bring forward into the modern age.  Why?  What was the point?  By all means, there would be no problem with making her black, but at least allow the character to be informed by that identity.  Having her be black is also somewhat odd, though, since Rosemary isn't exactly the most common name given to urban black women.  It isn't as though they could have changed that detail, though, without changing the title of the movie.  At one point another character (Margaux) comments on the strangeness of her name, but only manages to respond to it by calling it ""feminine.""  As opposed to what?  All the butch girls' names out there?  Even the writers could sense that something was off, but they could barely put a finger on it, let alone offer a rebuttal.  How bizarre.

Another change is the age of the main antagonists, the Castevets.  In the original, these were played by the elderly.  Here in the remake, the couple, Roman and Margaux, are middle aged.  This alteration is actually more of a problem than one might first think.  In both versions the Castevets have an ulterior motive for befriending Guy and Rosemary, but in the original this comes off as more plausible, as an old retired couple doting upon their younger neighbors.  Played by a younger couple, though, their interest in Guy and Rosemary is strikingly odd, so much so that a sane Guy and Rosemary should have been turned off by the scarcely warranted attention.  This is papered over by having Rosemary do a good deed for Margaux in returning her ""stolen"" wallet, but the scale of the favors that Margaux returns to her in exchange are glaringly lopsided (a cat, an apartment, a closet of fitted clothes, unyielding attention).  And this is all before Guy makes a deal with the devil.  It doesn't make sense.

Rosemary has two advocates.  One is Julie, who is her peer (and, as the plot requires, a convenient expert on Coptic Christian trivia), and the other is police Commissioner Fontaine, who she meets initially at Roman's party.  This is also problematic, in that the incorruptible officer is introduced to the viewer in a venue otherwise populated by Roman's sycophantic satanists.  It would seem sloppy for Roman to have included him on the guest list.  Nonetheless, the script, actors, and director do a good job with these two characters, who are unique to the remake, and their inevitable death scenes are fun.

All the other major plot points are straight out of the original movie, phoned in with little in the way of inspiration.  I think the only difference in the final ""cradle"" scene is that it's shot from the opposite end of the room from the original.  This movie is not up to the caliber of a truly good miniseries remake, such as Steven King's the Shining.  Despite its length, it brings nothing new to the table and fails to make a case for its needing to have been produced.",1404691200,4,4086,4.744318181818182
6408846,1,B00KA0VEGO,"Just like the original 1968 movie, this one has an unsatisfying ending. The suspense builds up nicely, and Zoe Saldana does a superb acting job. But about half-way through the movie we know what's going on with her troublesome pregnancy, and so the only thing left, really, is what will they do with the baby? The tension builds up and then fizzles out at the end. This movie, as well as the 1968 original, suffer from the same fatal flaw of cheating the viewer of the expectations built from the increasing suspense along the way. Just imagine how viewers would  feel if they were watching an increasingly suspenseful who-dunnit, and in the end the chief detective declares,""Sorry, folks, we made a mistake. There was no murder. It was just a mannequin!""",1403740800,3,755,4.763358778625954
6408847,2,B00KA0VEGO,"With all due respect to reviewer John Bowen, one does not need to be a person who ""hates all remakes"" to find this one sadly lacking. Yes, the production values are high and the acting is good. But it is now an entirely different, and far less effective, movie.

For starters, to pander to today's audiences' bloodlust, a lot of graphic gore has been added, something that was completely absent in the magnificent original. For instance, when Rosemary is told that her apartment building once housed the notorious ""Trench Sisters,"" who allegedly indulged in cannibalism, instead of learning about it through a casual reference in conversation, as in the original, here we have to be subjected to a flashback sequence showing the sisters kill and graphically dismember a man, blood squirting in their faces, a hatchet hacking off his arm, etc. And where Rosemary's friend Hutch, who tries to warn her, discreetly dies off camera in a coma in the original (and teasingly leaves us wondering what exactly happened), here he (changed now to an investigative police officer) has convulsions in his car with blood running out of his nose before being squashed like a bug by a large truck that smears him all over the pavement like a giant packet of ketchup. What was gained by this?

More detrimental is the fact that this remake gives away too much, way too soon. What made the original such an effective chiller was the fact that so much was left ambiguous up until the end. The viewer of that version has to piece together the various bits of evidence at the same time Rosemary does, so that we share in her gradual discovery and growing horror. In the remake, it is quickly established upfront that the Castevets are evil Satanists who have supernatural powers and can grotesquely kill people at their whim, which they do in several additional scenes of gratuitous bloodshed. As a result, the final revelation that was so shocking in the original becomes entirely anticlimactic, almost beside the point.

One is forced to ask why this remake was undertaken at all. Was it just to add visible bloodshed? Why didn't they just come up with a new story in which victims are mangled in graphic detail by Satanists instead of trashing what was and remains a masterpiece? In the hands of Roman Polanski, who adhered remarkably to the details of the original novel, ""Rosemary's Baby"" was an extraordinarily effective and subtle psychological thriller that actually made you think even as it more and more scared the bejeezus out of you. Agnieszka Holland, on the other hand, who directed this tasteless trash, has managed to transform it into just another gory slasher flick. No need to think, no need for innuendo, just buckets of blood to satisfy adolescent hunger for gross-out violence. Perhaps Holland should have renamed her hatchet-job ""Rosemary's Abortion.""",1402617600,35,2855,4.919087136929461

One of the stupidest, most boring, predictable, awful ending things I have ever seen.  On top of that, the acting, if one would call it that, was about as dry as a tumble weed who has lived in the desert for a hundred years.  I actually only watched because I was bored.  I would never again watch this version.  Such a lame version.

8656891,1,B00KA0VEGO,"Don't waste your time and money on this remake. It's no comparison to the original Polanski film with Mia Farrow, John Cassavetes and Ruth Gordon. This one was ""Made for TV"" and that shows throughout. Production values reveal the budget and shooting schedule constraints in everything from set, props, lighting and costuming to visual and audio special effects. Polanski's film has tight pacing and is compact without sacrificing the story. The result is well-paced and builds suspense to the denouement in the final scene. By comparison, this remake reduces the suspense to near zero, replacing it with unnecessary action and gratuitous violence, the lack of which added to the psychological power and horror achieved in the original. The producers, screenwriters and director completely missed the boat. Rosemary's Baby is a psychological horror story, NOT an action or physical one. Pacing is ruined by the two factors that destroy it in very nearly every ""Made for TV"" movie: length that's bloated to fit the time slot(s), and attempts to time plot cliffhangers for every commercial break. Among the worst of all is timing of the overall story for the split between the two parts. As a result, pacing is inconsistent with a story muddled by extraneous fluff. The lack of psychological suspense combined with a pacing that runs in fits and starts for commercial breaks and the two-part split in a story bogged down by unnecessary bloat eventually meanders its way to an anti-climactic final scene. It's an ending that was completely predictable well beforehand and has none of the psychological shock value the 1968 original contains in its denouement.

The purpose of this Made for TV remake was ratings sweeps. They network only needed to con the TV viewing audience into watching it one time to achieve that, and it had all manner of hype beforehand. The first part had ratings that OK but nothing to brag about, as they didn't have the desired boost. It showed in the second part several days later with very mediocre ratings as substantial fewer viewers didn't bother to watch it. I recorded it on one of my TiVos and watched it later when I could skip through the commercials. At the end I extremely disappointed, felt it was time utterly wasted, and promptly erased it (versus downloading it to disc for future viewing). That it's out on DVD and Blu-ray now is beyond me, but I suppose there are those that can be hoodwinked into buying it on disc if they weren't conned into watching it when it was originally broadcast.",1466726400,,2531,4.913551401869159
