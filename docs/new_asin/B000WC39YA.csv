8222416,5,B000WC39YA,"Being half Italian this movie was made for me. The loud, loving, craziness of an Italian family with it's ups and downs make for a funny enjoyable evening. Cher and Nicholas Cage and the rest of the cast bring their own brand of inclusion in a big family. The movie is accompanied by Dean Martin (also an Italian-American) singing the theme song ""That's Amore."" If you need a punch to your stressful day this is just the movie you need.",1470182400,,436,4.4625

8222419,5,B000WC39YA,"This is one of those romantic comedy movies that only seldom comes along.  Of course their are Cher and Nicholas Cage, but also Olympia Dukakis and others here who absolutely make this treasure what it is.  This particular recording is okay I guess but it could have been better.  But once you start watching the movie you will forget all the techno stuff and have a really good time.",1361836800,,384,4.536231884057971
8222420,5,B000WC39YA,"Loretta Castorini, a Brooklyn bookkeeper in her late 30s whose husband died several years earlier in a bus accident, decides it's time to get married again. So she accepts the proposal of a nice, middle-aged fellow named Johnny Cammareri. Loretta is convinced her first marriage was cursed because she and her husband had gotten married at City Hall; this time, she's determined to do things right, even as she admits to her mother, Rose, that she's not really in love with Johnny. Rose speaks from rueful experience; she suspects, with good reason, that her husband, Cosmo, is cheating on her. Loretta is convinced that marrying Johnny is the safe and sure thing to do - until she meets his estranged younger brother Ronny, who tends the ovens in a neighborhood bakery. Loretta discovers that in startling contrast to the pleasant, mild-mannered Johnny, Ronny is moody and passionate; what follow are complications worthy of a comic opera. So wonderful, so quirky, so romantic, so Italian. This movie is so feather -light you float off into its refracted reality and you never want to return to the humdrum again. This movie has something for everyone with a heart and leaves you filled with joy in the end.",1266883200,4,1208,4.897560975609756

8222422,5,B000WC39YA,"This is one of my favorite movies of all time.  It is part comedy, part tragedy, part fantasy, with a little bit of Cinderella mixed in.  It is beautifully written and the stars do a wonderful job.  It is one of those pick-me-up movies that I like to watch when I am feeling a little blue.  A staple in my DVD library.",1252886400,2,318,4.080645161290323
