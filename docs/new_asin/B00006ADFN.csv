One pointer - DO NOT DRINK ANYTHING WHILE WATCHING THIS MOVIE.  It may wind up in your sinuses, and you're going to laugh so hard that an accident may be imminent to begin with.",1025222400,2,399,4.089743589743589

Also, thrown in for extra hilarity are two ruthless Federal Agents, two bored cops, and two idiot conmen. The story revolves around random acts of comedy, One faitful, Comedic Night, and on screen chemistrey between a great cast, including Tim Allen, Rene Russo, Zooey Deschanel, Ben Foster, Stanley Tucci, Janeane Garofalo, Patrick Warburton, Jason Lee, Sofa Vergaram and Johnny Knoxville.",1024704000,2,640,5.474747474747475

1735685,5,B00006ADFN,"This star packed movie is non stop action. You will not find one clich or un-original thought in this movie. There is no way to anticipate the plot.

Actually it is like reading a Dave Berry novel; that could be because the story was based on one. As with all his works it starts off reasonable builds up to incredulous and then over the top. You are carried along with out even realizing it.

The story starts off with many overlapping threads. We have a young hit man from school out to get a school girl all wet. There is an unscrupulous character (Stanley Ticci) with a graphic (close your eyes) toe (belonging to Sofa Vergara) fetish. The mother (Rene Russo) goes down of the would-be hit man. The television is shot. Nina meets her maker Puggy. The dog finds aromas. Need I say more?

O.K. there is a frog, goats, and a portable garbage disposal.

On a deeper level it is about families and trust. But don't mind that now just sit back and have some fun.",1503792000,,960,4.376404494382022

1735697,4,B00006ADFN,"Well, I'm a huge fan of Dave Barry.  Loved his syndicated column, love his hilarious novels and helpful advice books on just about any topic imaginable.  After reading ""Big Trouble"" and laughing so much and so hard throughout the funny and suspenseful plot, I had to see the movie version of this hysterical, rib-tickling story.  I think it could be described as a ""comedy-drama"".
As an avid bookworm, I've come to realize how rarely it is that a movie adaptation lives up to the excellence of the author's original work.  I can't say this movie was an exception, but it wasn't terrible either.  The cast was well chosen, the script gave up several laughs, and the plot was true to the book.  They even kept that freaky frog and neurotic dog in :)  I'm glad to have it among my collection of movies for those ""feeling-kinda-blue-days"".",1489795200,,835,4.678082191780822

Great scene inside Joe's Stone Crab in Miami Beach and the Bayside Marketplace in Miami.  The directors narrative adds a new dimension to the movie and I keep going back to it.  The original release of this movie was delayed because it was scheduled for late September 2001.  When it was eventually release, folks were still sensitive about 9/11 and airport security.

1735811,5,B00006ADFN,"ROFLMAO. This movie had some purely hilarious moments--and was generally funny all the way through. I have of course read the book, and I think the movie was fairly faithful to Dave Barry's stream of consciousness style of writing and his at times outrageous sense of comedy. If you haven't read his work, you should do so, as the movie was faithful enough to the style that you could find yourself getting lost in the lack of structure and the odd, almost random, flow of the film. If you HAVE read this book and his other works--then definitely see this movie. The casting was superb, the cinematography was very good, and there was a high level of natural chemistry between the actors that worked very well. If you're looking for refined humor, or outright slapstick, then this wouldn't be your first choice. If, however, you appreciate the sheer slings and arrows of outrageous bourbon (or fortune, as the case may be) where ""truth"" really is far stranger than ""fiction""--you'll like this.

You'll especially like this if you are one of those people who is a nexxus for the improbable. The whole plot and premise range from slightly improbable to absolutely impossible--but it works, as does the typical life.",1441152000,5,1213,4.831730769230769

If you know Dave Barry and his off-beat humor, then you'll recognize it here. If you ever lived in Miami and know how weird Miami is - you'll really appreciate this movie. All the characters are over the top, but that's what makes it so perfect Dave-Barry-ish.

The cast may be the factor that makes it worthwhile. The movie appears to have been made around 2001 and was held off the market due to ""terrorist"" implications (which do not amount to very much but hey this is the 21st century). in addition to Tim Allen, there is a blond Rene Russo, Zooey De Chanel? is in it and several others whom are recognizable as mainstream actors today.

1735993,5,B00006ADFN,"This is one of our favorite movies ever. Justice has truly been done to Dave Barry's hilarious novel set in Miami. Tim Allen is at his best as Eliot Arnold, a likable father of a sullen teenage son, who gets caught up in an adventure he could never have imagined. Renee Russo, Jason Lee, the late Dennis Farina, Stanley Tucci, Janeane Garofalo, Sofia Vergara, Ben Foster, and Zooey Deschanel are each one better than the next. We've seen it a number of times and had to buy it recently. Most unfortunately, it was originally scheduled to come out a couple of weeks after 9/11. With an airplane bomb as part of the plot, this hysterically funny movie was shelved and never really advertised later when it did come out.

1735996,5,B00006ADFN,"I laugh at almost every scene in this film. The cast is large and almost every character has something fun to add. Jason Lee's comic talents get buried in this one, but everyone else creates laughs with a great cast, Tim Allen and Rene Russo are good, but the real gold is produced by Sizemore, Knoxville, Deschanel, Heavy D, The late great Dennis Farina, Jack Kehler, Stanley Tucci, Patrick Warburton (heck, even Garofalo is funny in this one!) and a young Sofia Vergara including a side splitting toe sucking scene with Stanley Tucci.  Sometimes you find a movie that just clicks and you find it funny over and over, and this is a top 5 of all time for me.",1399766400,2,658,4.483333333333333

1735999,5,B00006ADFN,One of those movies that leaves the whole family with catch phrases which apparently will be used FOREVER and make us all laugh every time they are remembered.  PLEASE Dave Barry - write more hysterical novels and PLEASE HOLLYWOOD make more of them into movies.  We all need to have a good laugh!  This also features the incomparable Dennis Farina R.I.P. - and he is at his best.  My daughter lives in Miami and has an extra copy of this movie just to make sure her friends all get to see it.

Unfortunately, it was due to be released around 9-11, and since it involves an airplane hijacking, was not released until much later.  Too bad -- we needed it sooner.

It's very funny.  Warning:  It can be habit forming.  I've watched it at least 12 times since I learned of its existence!  Best part is you can watch it with your kids with only 1 incident of  'adult language' and is nothing that they don't hear in school yards daily!  Tim Allen, Patrick Warburton, Janeane Garofalo,  Jason Lee (of  ""My Name is Earl"")  and Sofia Vergara  (I liked her as she looked in this movie- BEFORE she had her naughty bits weaponized!  lol)  are at their funniest and most endearing.

There's a guy who looks like Jesus who lives in a tree. Two NYC hit men. A loser newspaperman. Teenagers with attitude. A pair of dim-witted thugs. A pair of cops who are not having any fun. A toe-sucking white-collar crook and his disgusted wife. A dog. An hallucenogenic toad. And Martha Stewart. Though it sags a bit at the end, it's fine fun overall. 1st rate cast incl.

Tim Allen plays the lead role with TV talent level adequacy. It is the supporting cast that carries the day. Dennis Farina (RIP) is top notch as, as always, playing a mobster. I don't know all the other actors names, Johnny Knoxville and his partner expertly portray the common idiot petty criminal so common in Florida. Rene Russo and her high-roller wanabe husband are a riot and their daughter, played by Zooey Deschanel is sufficiently smart assy. It's a worth seeing movie.",1375228800,,632,4.798165137614679

1736204,4,B00006ADFN,"I actually find `Big Trouble' a lot of fun.  It has its moments of audacity and unhinged stupidity, and yet it all folds together rather enjoyably.  I think it's the fact that the entire cast really understands the films intentional humor and frenetic overtones.  It's like they are all feeding off of it.  Tim Allen, Rene Russo, Stanley Tucci, Patrick Warburton, Dennis Farina, Zooey Deschanel and Jason Lee as a Frito loving Jesus lookalike are the films standouts.

Yes, this film is silly.  It is also extremely stuffed.  There are mobsters and FBI agents and assassins and petty criminals and dimwitted cops and bombs and weird toads and unlikely heroes, but it all works.  It never gets confusing, as it certainly could have.  I know that some had an issue with the bomb scene, especially with this being released not too long after the horrendous 9/11 attacks, but it's done in a completely ridiculous manner and so I still found it rather hilarious, especially Warburton's streaking moment.

1736245,2,B00006ADFN,"This is a movie based on the novel by Dave Barry, and based in Miami, Florida.  It's key characters are two Russian mobsters (Snake and Eddie) and two cops from Newark (Janeane Garofalo and Patrick Warburton).  The Russian mobsters want a big silver box that contains a nuclear bomb.  This is what the movie revolves around.

Although there are plenty of stars in the cast, it does not help the movie.  The all-star cast includes Tim Allen who plays Eliot Arnold and his love interest is Rene Russo who plays Anna Herk, wife of the insane moneyman Arthur Herk (Stanley Tucci).  Zooey Deschanel plays Anna's daughter Jenny who develops a crush on Eliot's son.  Anna gets a divorce from Arthur in order to marry Eliot.

The plot is a screwball complicated chase for the silver box.  The movie full of wacky characters, besides the Herks, Russian mobsters and two hit-men from Newark (Dennis Farina and Jack Kehler).  Jason Lee plays Puggy, a young homeless man who loves Frito's and lives in a tree outside the Herk's home.  He falls in love with the Herk's Latino maid.

The movie culminates in the Russians attempting an escape, by taking the silver box with a nuclear bomb to the airport.  They use cash bribes as they buy airline tickets for a small commuter airline to the Bahamas.  Because of the volume of passengers, and their cash bribes, they pass Security, all under the name of ""Smith"".  During the baggage check they say the bomb is a garbage disposal with a timer, which they turn on for the Security Officer to see.  Now the bomb is ticking and will go off in 30 minutes.  They all board the plane and as the plane taxi's with the steps to the entry down,  Eliot sneaks on the plane and attacks the Russian mobsters.

Eliot knocks Eddie out with a fire extinguisher and then blasts the extinguisher at Snake.  On seeing the bomb is now close to detonation, Eliot hurls it out of the open plane door, only for Snake to leap after it.  Snake manages to cling onto some steps still coupled to the plane. Despite Eliot's persistence, Snake just opens fire on him, prompting Eliot to pull an emergency lever, decoupling said stairs. Snake plunges into the ocean with the bomb, which detonates safely in the water. Eliot is congratulated by the FBI, promised he will receive presidential cowboy boots and a hat, and told the events that took place are strictly top secret.",1260057600,,2379,4.630071599045346

1736311,3,B00006ADFN,"The book ""Big Trouble"" was Dave Barry's first novel and was his first effort into 'full length' literature.  Of course, Dave Barry had already been writing for several years before he penned ""Big Trouble"" but most of his works up to that time had been ten-minute stories for the Miami Herald.  Even his many books were little more than compilations of his weekly newspaper pieces.  But ""Big Trouble"" was different.  It had a story to tell.  It was a funny story (how could Dave Barry do anything else?) and I enjoyed it tremendously!

But now, ""Big Trouble"" has been made into a movie and like all other movies-from-books, I expected ""Big Trouble"", the movie, to have very little in common with ""Big Trouble"", the book.  But I was pleasently surprised because the movie followed the book very closely!  Everything that I thought was funny in the book was repeated, mostly word-for-word, in the movie.  The producer and director aparrently didn't feel that they could improve on Dave Barry's writing style and the video audience is so much the better for it.  (Now if we could only convince other movie producers to follow the original books more faithfully...)

Anyway, my wife and I (both big Dave Barry fans) watched the movie on a quiet evening during the Christmas holidays and we thoroughly enjoyed it.  We didn't expect the movie to be a statement on any current politics (the Iraq War, The Bush Administration, Britney Spears nekkid internet pictures, etc) nor did we expect the movie to solve any of mankind's problems (world hungar, disease, Britney Spears, etc.)  What we got was what we expected - silly, corny humor and a good reason to sit on the couch and wolf down a bucket of popcorn.

1736314,5,B00006ADFN,"This film was probably hurt a bit by the fact it had to have its fall 2001 release postponed due to 9/11(it's plot included terrorists that sell a bomb). I also imagine the marketing was tough since it had to be sold based on Tim Allen and the comparisons to ""Get Shorty"" rather than as a plot driven movie. I tell you though, this film is simply funny.

Just like an old Marx Brothers film, the plot is there only to set in motion the quick-witted dialogue and interaction between the characters. I have enjoyed both of Dave Barry's humor novels(this and ""Tricky Business""). They made me laugh out loud as did this movie. I think it captures the spirit of the book perfectly.  For those that have laughed at Dennis Farina from his roles in ""Get Shorty and even ""Snatch,""  he has never been funnier as a hit man who encounters unexpected roadblocks(literally) on his trip to do a quick sniper job.  Tom Sizemore is also excellent as the dumbest crook you'll ever see.

1736316,4,B00006ADFN,"'Big Trouble' has a lot of big things going for it...big laughs, big plot, big cast...and because of all this it loses a peg or two...for there's just sooooo much for it to keep up with itself...you get somewhat lost in the jumble.  The film stars Tim Allen in the central role, if you could call it that, as a journalist who gets himself and his son (Foster) thrown into one weirdly twisted plot involving crazed criminals (Sizemore & Knocksville) a hitman (Farina) a wealthy jerk-off of a man (Tucci), the mans wife (Russo) her daughter (Zooey) a homeless man that resembles Jesus (Lee in a histerical role) some mobsters, dimwitt cops (Garofalo & Warburton), FBI agents with attitude (Heavy-D & Epps) and a toad that sprays hallucinogenic saliva.  See all that and I haven't even got to the plot, but it's one of those things you'd have to see to really understand.  Lets just say everyone has a different agenda and they all get in each others way until everyones agenda changes to be someone elses entirly.  Does that sum it up?  It's funny, real funny, but it's also tightly woven without much room to adjust since it moves at such a frantic pace, keeping you watching closly to understand all that's going on.  It'll mae sense in the end though, I promise.",1152230400,,1263,4.616071428571429
1736317,5,B00006ADFN,"""Big Trouble"" is directed by Barry Sonnenfeld ('Get Shorty') and is just one of those comedies that is destined to recieve bad reviews. Which it did. It's stupid, completely implausible, and has at least one plot hole; but it's actually a very funny, smart (I guess), and entertaining comedy with a great cast. That cast includes Tim Allen ('The Shaggy Dog'), Rene Russo ('The Thomas Crown Affair'), Stanley Tucci ('Shall We Dance'), Ben Foster ('Hostage'), Dennis Farina ('Get Shorty'), Jason Lee ('Mallrats'), Omar Epps ('In Too Deep'), Patrick Warburton ('Family Guy'), Janeane Garofalo ('Mystery Men'), Zooey Deschanel ('Elf'), Tom Sizemore ('Natural Born Killers'), and Johnny Knoxville ('The Ringer') to name a few. The reason I rented this movie, hell the reason I had heard of it, was because I think Zooey Deschanel is hot so I was scanning her filmography. Well, even looking beyond Deschanel this is a good movie. It plays a little bit like ""Get Shorty"" mixed with it's so-so sequel ""Be Cool."" It's funny, witty, but also stupid and implausible...As I mentioned above. The movie is a comedy of errors and coincidences and is basically like this. Allen plays Eliot Arnold, Foster plays his son Matt Arnold. Rene Russo and Zooey Deschanel play Anna and Jenny. Tucci plays Anna's husband Arthur Herk. Jason Lee plays Puggy, a homeless man living in a tree on Arthur's property. Dennis Farina and Jack Kehler play two hitmen named Henry and Leonard. Garofalo & Warburton are two cops Romero and Kramitz. Epps and Heavy D play two FBI agents

and finally, Knoxville and Sizmore play two crooks named Eddie and Snake.

Explaining the plot is a pit complicated, but here goes...Eliot is a recently divorced, former-columnist who nows runs an advertising business. His son, Matt and his friend Andrew (D.J. Qualls, 'The New Guy') have to shoot Jenny with a squirt gun...It's a game. As Matt and Andrew arrive at Jenny's house, so do Henry and Leonard to kill Arthur Herk who has been skimming money from his company. As Matt runs up to the house to shoot Jenny, the hitmen take a shot and break Arthur's TV. Kramitz and Romero show up and settle things down...Except now Anna has a crush on Eliot and Arthur realizes that his company is trying to kill him. Arthur goes to a bar that's ran by two Russians to buy a bomb, but get's caught up in the middle of a robbery by Snake and Eddie. After they rob the bar, Snake and Eddie go with Arthur back to his house. At this point, the two FBI agents show up and then things get really stupid. The movie runs a lot smoother than my synopsis. So, yeah...The movie's stupid. We've settled that. Also, the cops and airport security are completely unrealistic. I don't care how closely it resembles a garbage disposal, you're not getting a bomb into the airport. The cops are, at times, dumber than the regular characters. But the movie is charming, goofy, and Farina and Kehler are hilarious as the hitmen. This is a funny movie and I'm sure than anyone who likes Sonnenfeld will like this movie.

1736355,2,B00006ADFN,"Big Trouble was Dave Barry's first published novel, I believe, and it was so good that it immediately warranted comparisons to Elmore Leonard by many major reviewers including Mr. Leonard himself.

I read the book and laughed that kind of laugh that you only get once in awhile - the kind of laugh where the tears roll down your face and people turn their heads to stare a ""what-ARE-you-laughing-at!?"" kind of stare.

I say all of the above to establish that I was ready for this film to be released.  When I saw that Barry Sonenfield was directing (He had helmed the FANTASTIC film version of Elmore Leonard's ""Get Shorty"") I anticipated it like a ""Lord of the Rings"" installment.

What I saw was.... a letdown.  I really like Tim Allen.  Same for Rene Russo.  Dennis Farina shows up in a role similar to the one he had in ""Shorty"".  The total effect wasn't even as good as a bad sitcom pilot.  Where the book describes absolutely ridiculous goings-on with descriptions by Barry.... in the movie we just get to watch ridiculous goings-on, and being familiar with the book it was like watching a movie with the sound off.... something was SERIOUSLY missing.

It's gross! It's so full of crude and sexual humor that it is almost displeasing to my comfort and satisfaction. I should say that most anybody should not watch this! And when I say it should go in the trash, then I even mean that it is so indecent in humor and behavior, and is so dense in fowl language, that it is totally impossible for any company to ever be able to edit and clean it. Yes, some of this movie is funny and parts of it make you get a kick out of it, like some of the actions that Tim Allen and Ben Foster perform (like where Tim Allen's character kicks his boss's computer, and walks around with it stuck on his foot in the next scene, and where Ben Foster's character plans to and does try to squirt his friend (Zooey Deschanel), and attacking her family the first time he tries to, too. Also, with another two guys who also want to shoot the owner of that house, played by Stanley Tucci, but are interrupted the first time by Ben's character, and something else after that turn; and plenty of the action and challenges that take place at the airport, going up to around the end). Plenty of what the father, son, and the girl's mother in the movie do are pretty decent, and 80 % of the time the girl (Zooey Deschanel) is, too. But a lot of what the chief thug (Tom Sizemore), Stanley Tucci, and a rude character played by Michael McShane do are just so perverted and is revolting. I mean, just those people in it (out of everyone else) are pretty much just so indecently corrupt, and talk a lot of the time like they need their mouths washed out with soap. And the policeman in it should not be publicly focused on sexual content plenty of the time, and running naked through a public airport and having a nudist party with women around the end, either. All though almost everybody says a bad word any in the movie and does any perverted acts of any kind, at least the father (Tim Allen) and his crush (Rene Russo) and the hippy-haired looking guy (Jason Lee), plus, in some degree, the girl (Zooey Deschanel) and the son (Ben Foster) and  all seemed like the five cleanest ones, in both language and most of their behavior.

1736374,5,B00006ADFN,"One of the most under-rated comedies in the last twenty years. Like Kelly's Heroes in the early seventies, this just suffered from bad timing.
Kelly's Heroes bombed at the box office because it was a war movie at the peak of the anti-war sentiment inspired by Vietnam. It has since been recognized as a classic comedy.
Similarly, Big Trouble just hit at the wrong time, right after the terrorist attacks of 9/11. But give it time, and it will similarly become recognized as a classic.
If you've read the book, you'll be impressed with the casting, which is almost perfect. Only Puggy seemed a little off, and even that wasn't too bad. Tim Allen is perfect as the protagonist, and he also does the narration, which is excellent. The hitmen (Dennis Farina and Jack Kehler) are just right. I have to give Dennis Farina particular note - he was probably the funniest person in the cast. Barry Sonnenfeld is, of course, a great comedic director, and he keeps the whole thing flowing with good comic timing.
The movie's kind of wacky, but if you read and appreciate Dave Barry's humor columns, then you'll probably love it.

1736397,4,B00006ADFN,"Big Trouble (based on the novel by Dave Barry) has a fast-paced, complicated plot that works as well on screen as it does in print.

There's an advertising guy (Tim Allen) whose son (Ben Foster) is supposed to shoot a girl (Zooey Deschanel) with a squirt gun as a part of a game at school. Meanwhile, a pair of hit men (Jack Kehler and Dennis Farina) are after the girl's step-dad (Stanley Tucci) - and his wife (Rene Russo) couldn't care less.

As Allen put when introducing a character, ""he was on of the few Floridians who was NOT confused when he voted for Pat Bucanan."" The story then goes on to introduce a barage of characters including Allen's son and his two friends, a maid, two burglars, two russian weapons dealers, two cops, a carnival security officer, two hitmen (one well played by Dennis Farina), and of course, Puggy.  The story takes place when the two burglars eventually get hold of a bomb about halfway through the movie. A chase ensues and the laughs just keep coming.

1736402,3,B00006ADFN,"Miami Herald Pulitzer-prize winning collumnist Dave Barry wrote this frantic farce that plays off like a Saturday Night/Sunday Morning hangover, leaving you confused and looking for answers of Who, What, When, Where, and most importantly, How.  Ok, maybe not...but it still is pretty weird when it comes to comedies that try not to be comedies of that sort.  In reason, director Barry Sonnenfeld does only two-types of movies: funny ones (i.e. ""Men in Black"", ""Get Shorty"") and movies you're embarassed to admit you saw (""Wild Wild West"").  This goes down the middle line of Sonnenfeld's genre.  To be frank, the film is a Deja Fu of ""Get Shorty"" without the funny twist and clear plot...actually, it goes without plot.
There really isn't any plot to ""Big Trouble"".  However, many talented directors have made one singular mistake in their career in at least one of their movies...the more celebrities, there is much less need for a plot.  Steven Spielberg learned this lesson harshly with his God-awful unfunny comedy, ""1941"", and Rob Reiner too, with ""North"".  But what can you say?  It works...very little of the time.  Being virtually plotless, it showcases a different approach to the average zero-to-hero story without any theatrics.  It's not really Good vs. Bad, but more like a race of who is the Goodest and who is the Badest.  Some characters aren't even fitted into the story, but are still shown copously for no apperant reason.  It's still funny though.  I suggest at least renting it.  Other than that, stay away.

That's the best word to describe ""Big Trouble"", a decent, belly-laugh of a movie with history's worst timing. With its subject matter of a nuclear weapon smuggled onboard an airplane (past the most clueless security people in history), it was set to debut the week of 9/11.
Oops.
And that's a darn shame since the movie is truly filled with laughs, particularly if you are the kind that responds to characters that are complete idiots. Think ""Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World"" for a new generation. My wife and I both enjoyed this comedy and we have distinctly different senses of humor.
The movie isn't perfect, though. When you are firing this many jokes at the audience at once, some are bound to miss. And there are probably more misses than hits in ""Big Trouble"". Still, the sheer volume of schtick will guarantee more than enough chuckles. Compared with some of director Barry Sonnenfeld's recent comedic misfires (""MIB II"", ""Wild Wild West"") this movie seems like sheer genius.
Many people have reviewed the story, but few the DVD package. This one is far from special, and given the death sentence the movie received due to its horrid timing in the market, one would hardly be surprised that it isn't loaded with material. You do get a director's commentary that's adequate and a strange, eight minute ""Cliff's Notes"" version of the film, but that is about it as far as the extras go. Do we really need trailers from other films included? And the fact that the author of the book from which the film arose, the wacky Dave Barry, has nothing to contribute to the DVD commentary-wise is an absolute crime. The lack of effort put into this DVD cost it a star.
One last comment: though the film is rated ""PG-13"", it has an overabundance of profanities that made me question the rating. It should have been ""R"" for language and brief nudity. Parents should find something else for the kids to watch.
If you would like have a movie night for adults that highlights the inner idiot in all of us, consider ""Big Trouble"" along with films like ""Zoolander"", ""Airplane"", ""This Is 'Spinal Tap'"", and ""A Fish Called Wanda"". You won't go wrong.",1042761600,4,2137,4.701333333333333

And even afterwards, parts of it (about bombs on planes and airport security) just didn't seem that funny anymore. Even so, it's a hilarious slapstick ride (well duh, it's based on a Dave Barry book)
Eliot Arnold (Tim Allen) has a job he hates, a car his son Matt (Ben Foster) hates, and a loud obnoxious client that everyone hates. A bomb in a footlocker arrives in Miami, in a lowlife bar run by Russian arms dealers. (No I am not making this up) Meanwhile, a pair of assassins called Henry (Dennis Farina) and Leo (Jack Kehler) arrive in Miami to shoot a crooked embezzling foot-fetishist businessman called Arthur Herk (Stanley Tucci). Their assassination plot goes awry when Matt leaps out at Arthur's stepdaughter Jenny (Zooey Deschanel) with a squirt gun, and is promptly tackled by Jenny and her mom Anna (Rene Russo, in a peroxide-blonde wig).
Eliot and Anna immediately are attracted to one another. As Eliot tries to figure out his relationship with Matt, Arthur buys the bomb, but soon the two assassins, two street thugs trying to become kingpins, two deadpan FBI agents, an immigrant maid, a spacey homeless guy and two irritable cops are in the middle of a wild chase over a nuclear bomb. And Miami has about forty-five minutes left...
Confused? Oh yeah. This movie is far from simple, in a slapstick sort of way. The humor is unashamedly stupid, making fun of teens, dogs, hallucinogenic toads, goats, people who smoke a lot in restaurants, newspaper bosses, dumb street thugs,  Miami in general, and airline security. (Somehow this last one isn't as funny as it used to be) They even get in a nod to the original author Dave Barry. Most of the violence and romance isn't serious either (like the frantic makeout scene where Anna and Eliot gyrate around his office, spilling hot coffee and breaking knicknacks). The one exception is the adorable romance between sweet-natured bum Puggy (Jason Lee, who looks like Jesus impersonator) and maid Nina (Sofa Vergara), who are so sweet and shy that it brings a tear to your eye.
Tim Allen is hilarious as the ad-agent-turned-national-hero, especially the scene where he chases the airplane down the runway. Rene Russo is also great, balancing out the funniness with serious acting;  Ben Foster is great as Matt; Farina and Kehler are a pair of endearingly straightforward hit men who are enjoying the whole fiasco; Janeane Garofalo and Patrick Warburton are great as well, as the cop who focuses on crime and protecting the public, and the other cop who merely wants to sleep with any halfway attractive female. Stanley Tucci is outrageously hateable as Arthur.
There's a lot of sex-related humor (nothing too hideous), plenty of swearing, and the makeout scene. There's also violence, but none of it is gory and some is just absurd (like when Eliot runs the car into the goat). The best scenes are probably when the enormous toad spritzes Arthur in the face. What happens? Watch for yourself! I'm not going to tell you!

1736405,4,B00006ADFN,"This is a film starring Tim Allen, Rene Russo and others, which is based on a story by columnist Dave Barry.
The film has a quick pace, and editing similar to other recent films like Ocean's 11.  The soundtrack is excellent also.
OK, so the gags are a bit silly, and the plot is too coincidental, I understand that.  However, when watching it unfold I laughed until my sides hurt, enjoyed every minute, and when it ended I wished it hadn't.  This film is simply hilarious!  Of special note is the actor from Seinfeld fame replaying the role of Puddy, and he delivers a classic line from the film in that dry ""Puddy"" style:  ""Was that a goat""?
Forget the expectations and artistic critiques and simply sit back, relax, and prepare to laugh.  Isn't that what comedy's are for anyway?",1042243200,6,781,4.542857142857143
1736406,5,B00006ADFN,"I have to agree with all the 4+ star reviews. My wife and I saw this at my Sister's and there was not a dry eye in the house. This was truly one of the funniest movies I have seen in a long time.

1736420,2,B00006ADFN,"""Big Trouble"" is an attempt at a high-flying movie farce with a bunch of crazy, madcap people doing a bunch of crazy, madcap things.  Based on a novel by humorist Dave Barry, the film features a plot involving hit men, Russian arms dealers, petty gangsters, police officers, FBI agents, a corporate embezzler, his unsatisfied wife, three prankish teenagers, a pretty Cuban maid, and a homeless person who looks like Jesus, who all somehow converge at the Miami airport with a nuclear bomb stuffed in a metal suitcase.  It was this last bit that caused Touchstone Pictures to delay the film's initial theatrical release in the wake of the 9/11 tragedy.  And rightly so, for it is indeed painful to watch the scenes involving the crashing of airport security and the waving of guns in a plane's cockpit - especially given the fact that the film itself is intended as a comedy.  What might have seemed boldly satirical two years ago seems decidedly crass and tasteless today.
Actually, the best one can say for ""Big Trouble"" is that it does manage to achieve a certain level of manic energy.  The problem is that, as a farceur, director Barry Sonnenfeld lacks the skills necessary to carry such a project off.  The screenplay by Robert Ramsey and Matthew Stone, so concerned with keeping its manifold characters and plot complications in focus, often forgets to inject any real humor into the setups and dialogue.  Sonnenfeld has everyone running around like mad, yet the attempts at both verbal and slapstick humor rarely make us laugh.  ""Big Trouble"" isn't a terrible film; it just feels slapdash and wastes the talents of a number of truly talented performers like Tim Allen, Rene Russo, Stanley Tucci, Janeane Garofalo and Tom Sizemore, all of whom deserve better.
Farce is, in many ways, possibly the most difficult form of comedy to pull off.  It requires the most assured form of split-second timing to keep it from spilling over into undisciplined silliness.  Done well, farce can provide hours of rib-aching entertainment; done poorly, it can make an audience wince with embarrassment for all concerned.  Unfortunately, the aptly named ""Big Trouble,"" despite a few good moments, winds up soundly in the second category.",1041206400,,2225,4.9703504043126685
1736421,5,B00006ADFN,"The makers of this movie did a heck of a job because it was just like reading the book again. If u haven't read the book yet don't sweat it, rent the movie they are almost identical (atleast to me) This movie is hilarious, so if u like funny movies, hot chicks, strange hitmen, and a nuclear bomb, this is The movie to see",1040169600,2,322,4.046875
1736422,5,B00006ADFN,"Known as the ""Sunshine State"" to many tourists due to it's abundant good weather and beautiful beaches, Florida has always been painted as a modern-day paradise in today's world. With large population gains every ten years, a plethora of smiling retirees, the absence of a state income tax, or the popularity of Disney World, Florida seems like a place where there are no wrongs, but right. Besides the screwing up of a nation election, that opinion is not true and ""Big Trouble"" shows us that even paradise can (or in this film, could have) affected the history of mankind.
Based on Dave Barry's novel, ""Big Trouble,"" star Tim Allen (television's ""Home Improvement"") as a former Pulitzer Prize winning reporter on the Miami Herald (where Barry has been a reporter for years) who has seen his luck run dry. Now working for an advertising firm, Elliot Arnold (Allen) is having father-son problems with his offspring, Matt, (Ben Foster of ""Get Over It""), is single, and having problems producing a successful advertising campaign.
One evening, after Matt gets himself in trouble with the law with a squirt gun incident at the home of a classmate (Zooey Deschanel of ""The New Guy"") Elliot meets an unhappily married woman (Rene Russo of ""Lethal Weapon 3"") and her obnoxious, rude husband Arthur Herk (Stanley Tucci of ""Maid in Manhattan""). Little do they know that two hitman (Dennis Farina and Jack Kehler) are after Arthur due to his knowledge of too much information in a government scandal.
Throughout the film, other supporting characters join the chaos that is about to take place, including a drifter name Buggy (Jason Lee of ""Mallrats""), the Herk's Peruvian housekeeper Nina (played by Colombian blonde bombshell Sofia Vergara, who is a major celebrity in Latin America), a jaded cop (Janeane Garofalo, ""Reality Bites"") and two bumbling crooks (Johnny Knoxville and Tom Sizemore) who happened to steal a ticking nuclear bomb they intend to smuggle out of the United States on a flight to the Bahamas and live a life in luxury.
In the tradition of classic screwball comedies, director Barry Sonnenfeld (""Men in Black"") captures the zaniness, and comic suspense Barry's novel contained. Unfortunately, when it was released in the spring of 2002, ""Big Trouble"" never received the deserved attention it should have received due to the events that had taken place in September 2001. Originally scheduled to be released on Friday, September 14, 2001, the film's release was scrapped due to the September 11 attacks in the United States. Due to the sensitivity of a bomb on a plane and a smuggled nuclear device, the studio pushed it's release to the spring. Doing so might have generated some negative publicity for this film, but when it was filming, no one could have predicted that such an evil event would have occurred.
Satisfyingly funny, ""Big Trouble"" is a comedic rollecoaster of a ride. It is definitely one of 2002's best comedy films.",1038700800,12,2944,4.997963340122199
1736423,5,B00006ADFN,"Okay, so when Dave Barry set about writing a novel, with much coaching from Carl Hiaasen, the general expectation of it was that it would be outrageous, hilarious, and possibly even comprehensible.  The result, Big Trouble, was all of these things in spades.  The novel Big Trouble is wildly hilarious and written with such a fast pace and stellar wit that it identifies Barry as a uniquely capable talent.
And then news of the movie came along.  It was one of those I truly expected to be a let down, another entry in the movies-that-don't-live-up-to-the-book trash bin.  Thanks to Barry Sonnenfeld (the guy who did Get Shorty and Men in Black, two of the coolest, in the sense of attitude, and funniest movies of recent years) it avoided that category.  The movie is outstanding, and just as wild as the book.  My only regret is that more of the details in the book didn't show up in the movie (and, okay, the actress playing the girl needs to emote just once in her life).",1038441600,2,975,4.574712643678161
1736424,1,B00006ADFN,"This movie has to be one of the dumbest movies I've seen in a long time. One would think of humor when they see Tim Allen's name and Rene Russo has always been one of my favorites.  The lady can act and she's proven that time and again, especially in ""The Thomas Crown Affair"". I was so disheartened with her performance in this movie. If Russo's agent suggested she do this movie, then perhaps she should think about getting a new agent. I've come to expect anything from Tim Allen, but really, this movie was just totally stupid. My thinking, is don't waste your money on this one.",1037923200,4,583,4.398148148148148
1736425,4,B00006ADFN,"As an unabashed fan of columnist Dave Barry, I was very excited when I found out that his first novel was going to be turned into a movie. I was even more excited when I heard about the casting. Tim Allen may have done some schmaltz, but when given a good script (such as ""Galaxy Quest,"") he's great. Jason Lee is good in anything (well... except ""Stealing Harvard,"" but NOBODY could have saved that one), Janeane Garofalo is one of the funniest (and most underused) women in America, and Zooey Deschanel is just plain cute.
Then Sept. 11 happened. And this movie pretty much vanished.
I can't really tell you WHY Sept. 11 pushed this back without blowing the ending, but once you see it, you'll understand. For months I was afraid this film would never see the light of day. Disney finally released it last spring to little fanfare, although I managed to catch it, and I dug it a lot.
It's hard to describe the twisting, meandering plot -- Tim Allen is an ad exec whose son has to shoot a girl he has a crush on with a water pistol, not knowing that a couple of bumbling hitmen are targeting her stepfather whose tree is currently occupied by a homeless man who knows a couple of Russian smugglers with heavy weaponry...
See how tangled it gets? But the weird tangling of all these various, unrelated plot threads is exactly what made the book such a satisfying read and made the movie so much fun to watch. It's not a great film, it'll never make any all-time great comedies lists, but it's a fun diversion that'll get you to laugh for a while. Check it out.",1034726400,5,1560,4.420138888888889
1736426,3,B00006ADFN,"""Big Trouble' is a serviceable comedy for people in the mood for slapstick, ridiculous characters, outlandish situations and silly one-liners. This is not in the same league as director Barry Sonnenfeld's best comedy, ""Get Shorty"", nor is it nearly as imaginative as his ""Men in Black"".
The story concerns a diverse group of people whose lives intersect one balmy Miami night. These include two inept hit men, two bumbling thieves, a crooked businessman and his dysfunctional family, a reporter-turned-ad executive and his teenage son, two Russians with some very nasty goods for sale, and a drifter who may or may not be Jesus. And, oh, I should mention the dog, the frog and the goats. With such a ditzy array of characters, it's surprising that ""Big Trouble"" misses the laughter mark as often as it hits it.
The fine cast includes Tim Allen, Rene Russo, Stanley Tucci, Tom Sizemore, Johnny Knoxville and Jason Lee. All but Knoxville have had much better roles in the past.
""Big Trouble"" was withheld from release for several months because of its subplot involving terrorists and a bomb on a plane. It's nothing really. This is a broad farce, and if there's a problem, it's that the movie reminds us of a happier, more innocent time.",1034467200,,1236,4.862559241706161

  Well Big Trouble's release was heald back and when it was released it got some bad reviews.  I think critics need their sense of humors checked out as this movie is the funniest movie of the year and has an excellent cast. I think it's one of the years best actually. It's stylist, story is well put together and the jokes are well thought out and delivered. Tim Allen I think has shown he's ready for a lot more challenging and much different roles, mean I'm starting to look at him more than just Tim the tool man Taylor. Besides him being good, Stanley Tucci, Tom Sizemore and Jason Lee are funny in supporting roles as well. Don't remember his name but the former star of the Tick is just hilarious, he should have a role in every comedy. ... Dennis Farina is in the movie too of course, ... Here he's a bit different though, he doesn't curse as much, haha, plus he's a bit more likeable too. Rene Russo is a good actress but here she doesn't have  much to do, had a much better role in Get Shorty. Other than that there's a fine esamble cast that just work great together. I strongly recommend Big Trouble to anyone who needs a good laugh.",1034121600,7,1150,4.285714285714286

Then, two cops arrive at the scene and it isn't long before a Russian bar-owner is selling a nuclear bomb to the man who was supposed to get killed, and that's just the first ten minutes, folks.

1736429,5,B00006ADFN,"In September 2001 Big Trouble was oringally supposed to come out in theatres and then they delayed it because it had to do with bomb related subjects on an airpor and in the wake of September 11th they moved it to April 2002. I was very upset and had to wait the 8th months before it was released to the public. When I saw the movie I thought it was very funny and was one of the greatets that I have ever seen. The thought of it is too funny. A guy could get through airport security with 3 guns and a nucelar war bomb.
The plot has alot of characters who all get connected to each other from random acts of faith and then most of them come together to get a bomb off of an airplane. Tim Allen plays Elliot Arnold who is an advertiser ever since his wife divorced him and his teenage son Matt hates him. He gets a call from Matt one day and Matt has to ""kill"" a girl as part of a game at school. He has to squirit her with a watergun at night in front of one witness. He tries to do it but get's attacked by the girl's(Jenny)mother Anna(Rene Russo).At the same moment the two boys went into the house a real bullet was shot by Henry(Dennis Farnia)is is trying to kills Anna's husband Arthur. Arthur becomes afraid and goes to two Russians who pretend a nuclear war bomb warehouse is a bar and he asks for a missile and the closet thing that the Russians have is a bomb. On the way out Arthur takes the suitcase with the bomb but is stopped by two crooks named Snake(Tom Sizemore)and Eddie(Johney Knoxville of Jackass fame)who think that there are drugs in the suitcase and hold the place hostage. Snake and Eddie take the suitcase to the airport where they also take Jenny and now Elliot,Anna,and a whole group of people to stop the bomb was going off and causing big trouble.
Also involved the the caper are two FBI agents played by Heavy D and Omar Epps,two police officers played by Jeanenee Galufaro and Patrick Warburton,and Martha Stewart is a very funny cameo.
