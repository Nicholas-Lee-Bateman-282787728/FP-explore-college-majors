1300977,5,B00003CXXI,"Shrek is a great film when you consider it has a lot of fun pop-culture jokes and amazing animation (look for the scene with the grass hill and watch the grass)
It's weakest element is the storyline - a few holes are in it but it still manages to hold together.  The overall look, feel and laughter are infectious and you will enjoy this no matter the age, no matter if kids are in tow or not.",990144000,2,393,4.103896103896104
1300978,5,B00003CXXI,"SHREK fights the forces of Hollywood mediocrity and wins!  GREAT WRITING, vivid characters, bang-on humor, ground-breaking computer graphics animation...  And an anti-formula story that hits home with viewers of all ages.  SEE IT!",990144000,,230,5.909090909090909
1300979,5,B00003CXXI,"Shrek is the movie to see this summer!  This movie is not only for little kids, but for everyone!  Mike Myers is great as the title character, though my favorite was Eddie Murphy as Donkey.  This film has it all - comedy, romance, and action.  I really can't say enough about this movie.  See it!

1300981,5,B00003CXXI,"Forget exploding battleships, cheesey love stories and mummies, SHREK is going to be the movie of the summer! It is the most hilarious romp I've seen for ages with what is probably Eddie Murphy's greatest performance to date. It's a great send-up of every fairy tale you've ever loved including quite a few pokes at Disney! It looks fabulous too, even better animation than Pixar's latest movies. This is going to be a SHREK summer.",988934400,64,432,4.773333333333333

1301180,5,B00003CXXI,"shrek is our lord and savior
Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me
I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed
She was looking kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb
In the shape of an ""L"" on her forehead
Well the years start coming and they don't stop coming
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
Didn't make sense not to live for fun
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
So much to do, so much to see
So what's wrong with taking the back streets?
You'll never know if you don't go
You'll never shine if you don't glow
Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play
Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold
It's a cool place and they say it gets colder
You're bundled up now, wait till you get older
But the meteor men beg to differ
Judging by the hole in the satellite picture
The ice we skate is getting pretty thin
The water's getting warm so you might as well swim
My world's on fire, how about yours?
That's the way I like it and I never get bored
Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play
Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid
All that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold
Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play
Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show, on get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars
Somebody once asked could I spare some change for gas?
I need to get myself away from this place
I said yep what a concept
I could use a little fuel myself
And we could all use a little change
Well, the years start coming and they don't stop coming
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
Didn't make sense not to live for fun
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
So much to do, so much to see
So what's wrong with taking the back streets?
You'll never know if you don't go (go!)
You'll never shine if you don't glow
Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play
Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold
And all that glitters is gold
Only shooting stars break the mold",1520380800,,2169,3.954337899543379

You can still watch the bonus features on the disc but the Vudu bonus features are only accessible if you purchase the movie through Vudu. Moreover, the digital bonus features are slightly different than the disc bonus features (for example, the digital version of Shrek includes The Ghost of Lord Farquad while the Blu-ray version does not).

In fact, I have purchased over 140 (ONE HUNDRED FORTY) movies on Amazon Video in reliance on her ability to view them on her television, which she is not able to do on other televisions we own, such as Sony televisions, having complex menu systems.  Now, TODAY, JUNE 15, 2016, Amazon has decided to discontinue support of Amazon Video on her Vizio television and instead wants me to buy a Firestick for $50, which she will undoubtedly be unable to use!

1303237,5,B00003CXXI,"This skewering of the Disney fairy tale formula is a classic. Shrek, a grumpy ogre, finds pigs, bears, fairy godmothers, and other sundry Grimm figures occupying his swamp. After determining that they've been exiled by the vertically challenged Lord Farquaad, he goes on a quest with a gregarious donkey to retrieve a princess and get his home back to its gross glory.

While the film is easily appreciated by the upper elementary and up set, teens and adults will find great wit in the film. Between the gags and allusions is a questioning of the fairy tale formula, which is ironic given the Campbell-esque hero's arc of the story. And then there are questions of power, friendship, male and female roles, love, and loyalty. The film deftly balances gross-out humor and poignant moments. This animated film has aged surprisingly well. Although the animated style might seem passe in  2016, the story's heart still works well.",1463443200,,927,4.974193548387097

1303421,5,B00003CXXI,"A single word describes Shrek- brilliant. Not in a long time have I enjoyed a movie as much as I enjoyed Shrek. This is a movie that plays on a few different levels, and manages to be entertaining on all of them. Plus, they stick it to Disney something good!

Mike Myers is Shrek, a big green, smelly ogre trying to live a peaceful life in his swamp. He spends his day brushing his teeth with bug goo and bathing in swamp mud. All is well until the vertically challenged Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow in a brilliant performance) banishes all the kingdoms fairytale inhabitants to Shrek's swamp. In an effort to regain his peace and sanity, Shrek, aided by his unwanted sidekick Donkey (Eddie Murphy), make a deal with Farquaad to rescue the Princess Fiona from The Dragon and bring her back so Farquaad can marry her.

It's well known that DreamWorks and Disney have had an ongoing feud for years, and Shrek is the latest and most destructive shot yet. The makers (led by ex-Disney, DreamWorks co-founder Jeffrey Katzenberg) hits Disney where it hurts most - animated features. No Disney chestnut is sacred. Various characters pop in and out of the film, and the sight gags playing on Disney's theme parks alone are enough to keep anybody entertained. Without giving anything away, one of the most hysterical gags in the film involve the Princess and a little bird in a very Disney, very Snow White singing sort of way.

The non-stop punches at Disney are one of the levels Shrek succeeds. The other is that it's a pure, heart warming story that anybody of any age can enjoy. Unlike most recent movies (animated or live action), Shrek is story driven. Watching the film you come to care about the characters and get involved in their feelings. I even found myself caring about characters that in any other movie would be pushed into the background soon after their ""big scene"". I would also like to say that I commend the DreamWorkers for the ending. It was unexpected and appreciated because it shows that beauty has many levels.

In general, Shrek can do no wrong. I usually see at least one thing I would've done differently, but not with this movie. I have racked my brain, and can't come up with a single thing I'd do differently. Shrek is visually stunning, hugely engaging and has a strong heartfelt moral.",1459987200,8,2311,4.6568627450980395
1303422,5,B00003CXXI,Dem feeeels! Watched this the other day and I do feel soooo old now. Will make sure that my kids and their sons would be able to watch this.,1459382400,,140,3.8620689655172415

1303425,5,B00003CXXI,Just as expected,1459209600,,16,4.666666666666667
1303426,5,B00003CXXI,"If you're looking for something a little less wholesome then Disney, but still well within the limits of 'Family values', then may I recommend Shrek. I have not had this much fun watching a movie in a long time. A fantastically fractured fairy tale that prods fun at every childhood story character and plot line that ever existed. No one is left unscathed, including Disney. There are a few major shameless blasts made at the mouse house enterprise but when it's all over, it's mostly harmless. In fact, you may think it was done out of jealousy. Shrek is incredibly animated, with textures and motions that surpass the famed Toy Story series. Every year computer animation gets better and better and this movie uses it to the fullest extent. There is no better format for this movie either. The number and diversity of the characters is well played out and well displayed in computer generation. Standard animation would not have cut it in this movie. The story line is simple; a large imposing Ogre (voiced by Mike Myers in his perfected Scottish brogue) who only wants to be left alone in his swamp, is suddenly imposed upon by every fairy tale character as they are thrown out of the kingdom. They have nowhere else to go. Out of selfishness, Shrek goes to see Lord Farquaad and ends up striking a deal to rescue a princess in order to get his swamp back. Followed menacingly by a Donkey (Eddie Murphy, in his second and even funnier voiceover roll), Shrek ventures off to a dark Castle to rescue the Princess. Upon doing this, in a spectacular battle scene no less, the three head back to Farquaad. Along the way, Shrek finds more to the princess then he thought he ever would, strangely there is something of a soul mate in this beautiful fairy tale lady. Well played also by Cameron Diaz, she is not your typical royalty. She can very well take care of herself, fighting off bandits in Matrix style kung fu precision and keeping up with Shrek in a display of bodily functions. This all leads up to a nice morality play ending that doesn't push the issue and lends to nice surprise as well. All the actors do a splendid job of voicing their characters. Everyone is alive and flowing. Murphy is especially hilarious, topping his performance as the mini-dragon in Mulan, mainly because he doesn't seem to have to hold back as much. The movie is so well paced that there are no lags, it flows right to the end. Funny, satirical, playful and beautifully animated, this movie holds all the right cards for entertainment. Even if you haven't seen it, I would recommend buying it.
Not unlike ""Beauty and the Beast,"" ""Shrek"" engages the viewer to know beauty is what is beyond the skin.
The DVD is loaded with extras, but frankly, you might not bother with them. Your kid will play with them, exploring them once or twice, but the movie is the real treat. The mock interviews with the characters are intriguing, and worth watching. The re-voice studio is a hoot, and you'll dig showing it off to your friends, but it loses its novelty soon enough. Because it is a DVD, your kids can watch it into eternity without worry of it wearing out.

Lithgow is very Lithgow, much the same personality as he was on ""Third Rock from the Sun.""
Cameron Diaz's princess character looks remarkably like her.
Eddie Murphy makes a great sidekick. I was skeptical that he might be too over-the-top, but found his voicings to hit the tone perfectly, with great comedic skill. In short, he's hilarious.
The movie is packed wirth allusions to old great movies and cartoons, mostly Disney, and adults will smile everytime they discover a new line or sequence from a movie they grew up with. Watch for ""The Princess Bride,"" ""Robin Hood,"" ""The Sound of Music"" and a bevy of other homages.
The ending surprised me, but I'll not spoil it for you.
I fully recommend ""Shrek.""

Shrek has grossed over 260 million in the theaters (as of Aug. 14, 2001). That's within .05% of the top grossing animation of all times, Toy Story (@ 262 million). Shrek is a great 3D movie. The 3D computer animation is second, only to Final Fantasy. The story is more involving than what I expected. The voices were well cast and performed. The whole film awsome. I'm sure you're aware of that or you wouldn't be reading this now. It has both adult (clean adult) and kids humor. The writers plagerized just about everyone and it was hilarious. Okay, now for the DVD. This DVD is created as 2 parts. One disc is aimed for the kids and the format is ""full Screen"" (pan & scan) and includes 17 DVD-ROM games. The other disc is geared more for adults and is letterbox formatted. Both discs have 3 minutes of extended ending that was never scene in the theatrical release. There's 'Making Of' and 'Behind The Scenes'. It encludes 11 hours of extras. There are also running commentaries. This DVD will actually allow you to replace a charector's voice with you own with ""Sherk's Revoice Studio"" effects. There are 15 minutes of newly animated footage specifically for the DVD interactive menues.. . . . . Shall I go on? . . . There is a sticker on EVERY box saying it's a winner. Each box has eligebility to win a prize, from a Kia car to X-Box game consoles to Baskin Robins Ice cream. So, we have a fantastic movie, the most massive extras features ever on a DVD, and free give-aways. And yould be nuts not to take advantage of this offer.",1459123200,2,5398,4.586956521739131

It is like the world is all new and exciting to them or something.  I certainly don't get it because sleep is my love language but who am I to judge ... Unfortunately, I work late hours and there is not enough coffee in all of Columbia to make me a morning person.  So when I have been up working until 3 am and my kids are up at 5 am, I'll admit it, sometimes I do a little through the eyelid parenting from my couch.  No I don't do this all the time and yes my children are happy and healthy and well cared for ... The thing is, sometimes mommy needs 30 minutes of quiet time after the drinking of my coffee to feel like a human.  So I put on a little bit of TV, 30 minutes at most and the rest of the day just goes so much better.

I have to admit things had been rough in the house ever since there was a terrible gas leak and Daniel Tiger's neighborhood blew up.  I had been on the hunt for a good replacement, but kid's shows are the absolute worst.  Most of them make no logical sense the voices are high pitched and annoying, and after 2 hours of sleep I can't even deal with all that mess.

Then one day I forgot to lock down my tablet and the kids somehow stumbled upon a Shrek trailer.  They watched that thing like 50 times.  They were completely mesmerized.  It was better than that lady on YouTube that plays with playdough.  I knew I had struck gold.

So while I can't tell you anything about the plot, I can tell you Shrek's scottish accent is oddly soothing and the movie is like crack to my kids.  Which means mama gets to rest!",1454976000,8,1720,3.9853801169590644

The story is about and Ogre who is forced by the King of the land to go with a talking donkey to a forgotten castle with dangers in order to rescue a princess who has a secret curse to hide from the world. The moral of the story is that you don't have to be perfect to be able to find love and that the world isn't filled with all size zero's and perfect faces and we are perfect the way we are made and we are the only ones who can determine if we are of value, not everyone else.

1303938,2,B00003CXXI,"Shrek is a well-known and popular movie, as evidenced by its sequels and offshoots like Puss 'n Boots. Shrek is similar to ""Beauty and the Beast"", although in the end is more ""Beast and the Beast"", I guess. Based on this premise, after Princess Fiona is rescued by Shrek from a dragon, the journey home turns into the obligatory journey of love, with side characters providing a refreshing break from the main couple, like Eddie Murphy's donkey, Monsieur Hood, and even the villain Lord Farquaad, who has the stereo-typical ""short-man-power"" syndrome. Despite the tongue-in-cheek tone towards fairy-tales, the ending is all-too fairy-tale-like, no matter how much they dress it up with pop music. In its effort to break the mold of a typical hero and heroine, the main characters are hard to like.

""Beauty and the Beast"" was grounded on love beyond appearances, and Shrek tries to build on the same premise - human falls in love with beast, and vice-versa. The flaw in this version is Fiona transforms into an ogre every night, so she's really half-ogre, conveniently the same species as Shrek. There is also a plug here for being overweight - Shrek in ogre form is not only large, but pear-shaped, and Fiona in the same form is noticeably chunkier in every way. What would happen if Fiona transformed into an ogre while retaining her human shape - would the match between them look as appealing? And can she still perform her athletic martial-art capabilities in pudgy ogre form? That would be a serious downgrade if she couldn't, assuming she uses it defensively (she doesn't), which brings us to some unflattering character issues.

Besides the obvious temper and patience problems with Shrek, he himself makes disparaging remarks about the physical appearances of Farquaad, ironic given that he's also the victim of prejudice. Fiona exposes a violent side when encountering Monsieur Hood and his clan. It is somewhat understandable that the would-be rescuers made the wrong assumption about Fionas circumstances. Her first reaction to the unwanted rescue? Jump-kick Hood and knock him out, finishing with the statement ""man that's annoying"". Would other annoyances receive similar responses? One has to wonder about the long-term viability of a relationship where patience is seriously lacking on both sides.

It is really the side characters that are more likeable  donkey, while being outspoken, proves loyal and patient. The gingerbread man is cute. Farquaads executioner is entertainingly daft, and the magic mirror down-to-earth. Ah, but you say, perhaps there is too much being read into the flaws instead of enjoying Shrek for what it is - a lighthearted journey with lovable characters. Perhaps that is true too. Except the lovable characters are not the main ones.",1449187200,,2778,5.125827814569536

1304932,4,B00003CXXI,"Shrek an ogre who lives in the swamp goes on a journey to save a princess only to get his swamp back from the king.

Great work form the voice talents - Eddie Murphy, Antonio Banderas, and Mike Myers all stand out as the principals but I really enjoyed even the lesser characters like pinocchio and the ginger bread man.

It's the first of three movies and probably the best one.  Kids and adults can enjoy this movie as it's just the right balance for both.",1435536000,,458,4.3023255813953485

1305189,5,B00003CXXI,"Funny, somewhat sarcastic humor, which appeals to me. It also requires some acceptance of people who are different from what you may think yourself to be. That's fine with me. I recommend Shrek highly.",1433030400,,201,4.9411764705882355
1305190,5,B00003CXXI,"You've seen it before, the classic knight and his noble steed saves the sleeping damsel in distress story. But what we have here is much more than that. Stemming from the literary masterpiece, shrek, by William steig, mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, and Cameron diaz come together in what many of my colleagues have described as ""cinematic GOLD."" We are immediately introduced to our ""antihero"" Shrek at home on his swamp. This ain't your classic hero, this is your crude, fatty, bad ass green ogre of a hero. Some have compared him to bilbo baggins (the hobbit, lord of the rings) because of his initial unwillingness to be a leader. But when EVIL fun-sized Lord Farquad  threatens Shrek's privacy by exiling al the fairy tale creatures to his swamp, things get a little more serious. Shrek, being VERY type A, takes it upon himself to meet with lord Farquad where he is then presented with a compromise. He'll get his swamp back if he goes and rescues Princess Fiona from the evil dragon for Lord F.
So this is where our journey begins, shrek on a quest with his trusty ass sidekick, Donkey. The journey to find the princess (Cameron diaz) poses many obstacles and growing tensions between type b donkey and type a shrek.
I will not spoil the rest of this film for you but I will leave you with some more insight. This film is for everyone; the outcasts, the royals, the intellectuals, the comics. This movie is NOT for people that have. A bad attitude, can't take a joke or like to be haters!!!! This is a movie full of passion, romance, dragons and friendship. Highly recommend for a movie night with friends.",1432944000,,1607,4.618881118881119

1305297,5,B00003CXXI,I love shrek. It's a funny movie and eddie murphy and donkey always makes me laugh. I love how they have a couple of fairy tale creatures. I think kids will love the movie too but there are some jokes and language that might not be appropriate for them. Overall i'm impressed with the movie. Who would've thought an ogre would make a great movie. I love gingy. He's my favorite character and i hope nobody messes with his gum drop buttons. If you're having a movie night with family then you should pick shrek. It's a funny movie and you'll be sure to love it.,1431302400,,560,4.2924528301886795

1306577,2,B00003CXXI,"I've seen every Shrek in the theater when they were first released and kept a warm, fuzzy place so deep I bought the DVD's when they came out and stored for safe keeping, hoping to share this treasure with my little one whenever that day came. I never bothered to watch them in the meantime.

Many years later, I broke them open and, unlike wine, found they haven't aged well. That s as sad for me as it is for anyone giving it a five star reading my review. Mind you, I like most Mike Meyers and Murphy films (Austin Powers, Coming to America! Etc.) and believe they're doing their best here but the humor is really tied to the early 2000's (e.g. Robin hood's men doing the 'Lord of the Dance' routine) and other Hollywood biz tropes. Also, the Shrek character is so unlovable. It's always been hard to root for him, but now that I'm older I'm willing to objectively ask myself 'why should I?' Just because he's the protagonist? Because no one likes him? Because people judge him harshly before they get to know him? Well, I've gotten to know him and he seems like a jerk. Why should I like an unhappy jerk?

But then there's the bigger issue here, which is who this cartoon is really aimed at. Show it to most kids under 7 and you'll have to explain everything, including the jokes. Never mind the crude language and twisting familiar characters (e.g. Pinocchio) into different and hardly lovable incarnations of what your children are familiar with. Think about it, do you want your children growing up thinking of Pinocchio as a weak willed, effeminate liar or the Big Bad Wolf as a cross-dresser? How about the ginger bread man saying 'eat me!' And spitting into the nemesis's eye? It's novel but classic, or even children's fare?

Grumpy ogre, door-mat sidekick and dated humor geared toward adults... sadly not quite what I remember or feel comfortable showing around kids.",1410739200,,1880,4.605970149253731

It's easy to cop out and write whatever's ""naughty"" or a little ""smutty.""  It's a kid's movie... why not keep it clean?",1400284800,2,263,4.416666666666667

1307180,5,B00003CXXI,"My 18 month old son loves Shrek.  He loves movies with music and Shrek does not disappoint.  Great choices of music and actors to play the cast of characters.  Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz, John Lithgow and the others are great actors when they are on screen so when they are just voicing characters the quality is still high but with outstanding scenes and a well written script.  Great jokes for all ages in this movie which is nice because you get to enjoy the movie as an adult and your children can enjoy it as well.  This movie also was the first animated movie to win an oscar for best animated feature so you know it is worth downloading.",1399420800,,656,4.3884297520661155

1307275,5,B00003CXXI,"I gave this movie 5 stars because it was a great film, very funny, and just all around pretty cool. The only thing I would say bad about it, is if your seeing it with little kids (ranging ages 2-14) they do say a few curse words to look out for. That is all :)",1397088000,,260,3.7454545454545456

1307278,5,B00003CXXI,"This is some of the best work Mike Myers has done--along with rest of the cast
I know I am just repeating what others have said but we ordered for our 19 mo old grandson and he loves the gentle ogre--
just enough scary parts to spice up the viewing w/o actually causing nightmares or anything and the humor is always there for the adults...compassion and empathy makes it a worthwhile viewing for people of any age...",1396742400,,417,4.428571428571429
1307279,3,B00003CXXI,"Shrek is clever, straight forward, and just fun to watch. Very appealing to the eyes also. The characters can spread a few laughs here and there, but it is not extremely hilarious. There are a few jokes only adults could catch on too and chuckle. The voice acting fits perfectly, and the character designs are intriguing. Recommended to anyone in a ""Ogre"" mood, this'll cheer you up.",1396396800,,383,4.731343283582089

1307390,5,B00003CXXI,Adult humor geniously hidden in a children's animated comedy - reminds me of the old political Bugs Bunny cartoons because both are great fun for children AND adults alike.,1395187200,,172,4.9655172413793105
1307391,5,B00003CXXI,"Another animated jewel that is useful in teaching children  that making judgments on an outward appearance or preconceived prejudice is wrong. And, if you practice this you may be losing out on a lot of awesome people, and wonderful opportunities.",1395014400,,247,5.175
1307392,4,B00003CXXI,When my two year old has this movie on repeat for days on end I don't feel the need to shove cotton balls in my ears or gouge out my eyes in order to get an ounce of relief from the annoyances that you can get from some children's movies.  This movie has just enough adult humor mixed into the scenes that your child doesn't catch on or lose interest himself but enough to keep the parent from bashing their head off the wall.,1394841600,,426,4.071428571428571

1307396,3,B00003CXXI,"The over all message of the film is excellent. It is based on not judging others on their outward appearance but on who they are as a person. It also focuses on letting your self become vulnerable to others but shows that vulnerability is a key to developing a deeper relationship. However, the film has too many inappropriate content to be considered an acceptable family film. Shrek's ill-manners are condoned and the language is a little heavy. In summary, I would rate the film a 3.5 out of 5.",1393459200,,497,4.595505617977528
1307397,4,B00003CXXI,"We watched this with our 3-year old, knowing it was good and funny already. I thought we could talk him through the scary dragon parts but he actually got scared of Shrek! We talked him through that,too, and he ended up liking it a lot.",1393200000,,236,4.266666666666667

1307582,5,B00003CXXI,I'm writing this in the off chance that you've never seen it before. You can't go wrong with this one. It has humor that kids love and some that's so underhanded that only parents will get it. ...and that's half the fun! Eddie Murphy fills in the other half of the fun.,1388275200,,269,4.1923076923076925

1307805,5,B00003CXXI,Dreamworks Shrek may be one of the best animated movies of all time. Many of todays animated features borrow from the Shrek formula. Where else can one have an animated movie that appeals to both kids and adults equally? What a fun movie where classic fairy tale creatures and characters get warped and turned inside out from their classically accepted and told tales. My grown-up kids have watched this movie countless times since they were young.  Now they laugh out loud at all the parts they missed when they were watching with younger eyes.,1378252800,,545,4.797872340425532
1307806,5,B00003CXXI,"This is a great modern fairy tale. Shrek the Ogre with plenty of attitude was perfectly done by Mike Myers. Eddie Murphy's donkey - named Donkey, stole the show. And Cameron Diaz did a decent job with voicing Princess Fiona. The evil Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow) was more funny than evil. We've watched this movie numerous times. A true keeper in the kid's movie collection.",1377734400,,374,4.769230769230769

1307808,3,B00003CXXI,Donkey shows perseverance and unconditional love and friendship. Lady Ogre learns to accept the beauty of who she really is and learns she can be loved for who she really is. Contains Eddie Murphy's typical quick wit & humor. Good quality animation but too much language for me to want to see again.,1376870400,,299,4.660377358490566

 there was nothing in here even remotely aesthetic and beautiful. Shrek farts and burps and anything else disgusting you can think of which they portray as funny. It also has a lot of violence in it that scares kids.",1363046400,,564,4.175925925925926

1308438,5,B00003CXXI,"I cannot imagine ANYONE of any age who would not find this film to be a delight. A first viewing is pure entertainment.  Subsequent viewings reveal how truly outstanding the screenwriters are with their sly presentation of story, characters, and settings. I might have missed ""Shrek"" if it weren't an absolute favorite of my grandson, and am so happy that I didn't.  I confess to watching it even when he isn't visiting and marvel at the fact that I find something new each time we watch it.  The actors voicing the parts are perfection, and Eddie Murphy was robbed when he didn't receive an Oscar for his ""Donkey"" role.  While highly entertaining and filled with brilliant double entendres, ""Shrek"" is very much a subtle morality play that reminds us that beauty and wealth can never replace innate goodness, and being ""different"" is just fine.

1308887,5,B00003CXXI,"This is the movie that made me enthusiastic about computer animation. For some reason, I did not like Toy Story. Maybe I was afraid it would mean the end of traditional animation, which I think is a fine art form (I am glad those movies are still out there), or perhaps it was just the story itself. Toy Story is what I would personally call a ""boy movie."" Anyway, at first glance, Shrek being an ogre seems to make this a boy movie, but then it has the princess story also. I think this movie is good for just about everyone. I notice some reviewers complain that it is not necessarily appropriate for kids. I did not really enjoy the exploding bird, and it had a little too much bathroom humor for my personal taste, but I don't have kids myself, so I didn't have any of that to worry about.

I liked the story, I liked the characters, I liked the cultural references, I liked the jokes... I could go on. Much of it seemed to be funny without even trying! Most of the movies I own are dramas, or psychological movies, or science fiction, and I love them. It is not that I dislike comedies. I really enjoy comedies. It is just really hard to find a good comedy. And Shrek is a good comedy!

Back to my first comment, I was especially impressed by the animation. (If I could have any career I wanted, working on movies like this would be my dream job.) The attention to detail was amazing. The fiery flame pits at the dragon's castle. The stones that built the castle. Shrek's skin. Fiona's pretty red hair. Even the grass and flowers. Everything was just beautiful. And I'd swear there were real live humans mixed in that dancing scene! (Just a disclaimer: I think there are many movies that overdo the CGI these days. We do need SOME acting and plot!)

I love the three sequels and give them all 5 stars as well. They just get better and better! Well, the first may be the best, with the most charm, but the sequels keep up the high standard of quality.",1335571200,,1955,4.321525885558583

1308890,5,B00003CXXI,"This is a Great Movie, especially the Donkey. Everytime he opened up his mouth he busted me up with laughter.  Shrek #2 was not nearly as good, but you can't go wrong with this one.",1332806400,,181,4.171428571428572
1308891,5,B00003CXXI,"This is one of my all-time favorite movies. If you've never seen it, then it's a must. Funny, heart warming, good story line. Quality acting and well made movie.",1331942400,,161,4.586206896551724
1308960,5,B00003CXXI,"I still remember the first time I saw this. It made my six-year-old self actually sit still for an hour and a half.
I think the first reason was the characters. The title character, played by Mike Myers, is funny and although he is not a nice person at the beginning (being a stereotypical ogre), everyone likes him. A scene in the middle of the movie makes us feel sorry for him, in fact. ""People take one look at me and go 'Aah! Help! Run! A big, stupid, ugly ogre.' They judge me before they even know me.""
Later, the line about judging is echoed back to Shrek by the film's female lead, Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz). Although she begins as a typical fairytale princess, she proves independent, fearless and skilled. She turns out to be the perfect match for Shrek.
The villain, the dwarf Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow) is also very funny. He's snobby, superficial, and overall just cruel.
But I think the credit should really go to Eddie Murphy, who plays the role of Shrek's sidekick, Donkey. He was probably the first person to befriend Shrek, who at first finds him annoying, but becomes quite friendly with him. Nearly every joke makes me laugh every time, especially when Donkey freaks out because Shrek got shot by an arrow. ""Shrek's hurt? Shrek's hurt?! Oh no, Shrek's gonna die!""
The jokes, as I said, are hilarious, and the storyline is perfect. It's a parody of a fairytale, and works extremely well. Out of the four Shrek movies, this is probably the second best, close behind the second movie. I strongly advise you to buy it.",1331683200,,1541,4.607272727272727

1308964,5,B00003CXXI,"This animated tale of a giant green ogre living in the swamps of Never Neverland remains one of my favorite films of the genre.  Joining ""Toy Story"" of a couple years earlier, animated filmmakers began to make movies that would keep the youngsters entertained as well as mom and dad.  While the computer generated animation doesn't compare to the Pixar fare, the writing does.

Shrek the ogre (Mike Myers) agrees to rescue the beautiful princess (Cameron Diaz) for a dwarf Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow).  This will allow Farquaad to become king.  In return, Shrek will regain control of his swamp that the lord had populated with old Disney cartoon characters.  No I'm not kidding.  Aiding Shrek on his quest is Donkey (a very very funny Eddie Murphy).  A secret that Princess Fiona has kept will upset the applecart as it were as the story progresses.  The kids will love this movie and there are plenty of inside jokes that will be recognized by the adults.

They had ""crap,"" a song with the repeated chorus ""I don't give a damn,"" and about a dozen ""shut up's.""  So if you're ok with a mild amount of cursing, the movie is fine. It ranks right up there with Cars and Toy Story.  But I have no idea why they couldn't have refined just the language to make it an all-around hit for younger ears.

I have been entertained each time I've watched it.  My concern with this film is that it has been repeatedly marketed as a children's movie when it clearly is not. There are elements of the film that children would enjoy, just like there are elements of drugs and alcohol that children would enjoy; just because children would find something fun and entertaining does not mean they should be allowed to take part in it.  As an adult, I have the cognitive ability to watch and enjoy this film.  I can filter out the jokes that are too crude or crass for my tastes and enjoy the finer aspects of the story, such as the emphasis on true beauty coming from within. As a parent, however, I will not allow my child to watch this movie until she is old enough to have developed this filter of her own.  She is a child, and it is my responsibility to protect her until she is old enough to fend for herself.  I am unapologetic about this because I understand that ""Shrek"" is not a children's movie.

Few of us will ever forget the original characters voiced by the likes of Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz, Mike Myers, and John Lithgow. Shrek is a giant orgre who attempts to resue his Princess from evil clutches, while at the same time trying to regain his rights to his swamp from the Lord Farquaad.
 The plot was written mainly for children, but adults will love it as there are many adult-orriented jokes throughout the picture.
 The movie went on to be one of the most successful animated movies of all-time grossing over $480,000,000 on a $60,000,000 budget while spawning several sequels over the years.
 The DVD is filled to the brim with extras including an alternate ending, behind-the-scenes featurette, commentary, and much more.

1309244,5,B00003CXXI,"This movie is a creative milestone for animated movies, not only for the animation but for its warmth, charm and delightfully loopy dialogue.  There are also underlying positive themes of forgiveness, acceptance and helping each other out that are refreshing.

Shrek is the story of an ogre who starts out on a quest to save his home and finds love and friendship along the way. His journey is told from a ""fractured fairy tale"" point of view that keeps you laughing and engaged.  Every character from every fairy tale seems to be in the movie and that is part of what makes it so hilarious.

The interaction between the main characters is the main reason the movie is so funny: Shrek, the mean ogre who actually has a heart of gold and just wants to be accepted as he is; the obnoxious but lovable Donkey who turns out to be a loyal friend; and the idealistic but tough Princess Fiona who is looking for her true love.  They have issues and bicker and get on each other's nerves at first, but they discover they have more in common than they realized and that they really care about each other.

I compared it to the full screen version and found that, indeed, the top and bottom areas of the full screen version are missing in the widescreen version.

While I absolutely love the original Shrek, my great joy in viewing the widescreen version of any movie is seeing all of the image that was originally shot.  Somehow that did not occur in the transfer to DVD in this ""widescreen"" version.

1309404,1,B00003CXXI,"Once upon a time, there lived an ogre named Shrek (Mike Meyers). Shrek liked the quiet life in his swamp, until Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow)evicted all of the fairy tale animals from his Kingdom. The animals move into Shrek's swamp, which he is not happy about. So he and the fast-talking Donkey (Eddie Murphy) visit Farquaad to work out a deal: Shrek will rescue Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) from a fire-breathing dragon, in exchange for taking the animals back.  While spoofing every fairy tale from Three Blind Mice to Three Little Pigs, and taking numerous shots at Disney, Shrek's message is not lost. One cannot always see beauty from the outside.

1309410,5,B00003CXXI,"Shrek is one hour and thirty-one minutes long and was released on April 22, 2001. Shrek tells the story of an ogre (Shrek) who lives alone in a swamp and his life is turned upside down when fairy tales creatures are relocated to his swamp by royal decree of Lord Farquaad. Shrek along with Donkey goes to visit Lord Farquaad who is holding a tournament with his knights. The winning knight will be the one chosen to rescue Princess Fiona. However, Shrek walks in just as about the tournament is about to begin. When Lord Farquaad sees he changes the rules. The knight who can defeat the ogre will be the one chosen for the noble quest. Shrek in turns defeat all the knights and Lord Farquaad is left to make a deal with Shrek. The deal is the Lord Farquaad will clear out his swamp and return the swamp to its original beauty in return Shrek must rescue Princess Fiona. Shrek accepts the deal and head towards the castle where Princess Fiona is locked up in the highest tower and is guarded by a female fire breathing dragon. Shrek and Donkey arrive at the castle and rescue Princess Fiona. On the way back to DuLoc, Shrek begins to fall in love with Fiona. The night before the arrival to DuLoc, Shrek, Donkey, and Fiona take shelter by a windmill. Fiona camps inside the windmill while the other two sleep outside. On his way to visit Fiona, Shrek overhears Donkey and Fiona talking. Shrek over hears both of them talking and he believes they are talking about him being ugly. Shrek heads directly to the castle to inform Lord Farquaad where Princess Fiona is staying. When morning arrives, Shrek greets Princess Fiona with the arrival of Lord Farquaad and his guards. Farquaad gives Shrek his deed and Fiona and Farquaad head off to get married. Shrek now back at his swamp and deserted as well, finds he is lonely and misses Fiona. Donkey arrives to tell Shrek that Fiona loves him and not Farquaad. Donkey has bought the dragon with him so Shrek can make it to the wedding and tell Fiona how much he loves her. In the end, Shrek and Fiona are riding off into the sunset. Shrek is a very good movie to watch. The plot rolls right along and keeps you laughing at the right moments to laugh. Shrek gets an AAAA++++.

1309520,4,B00003CXXI,"Ever since I saw the movie Shrek when it first came out in theaters, I saw it as a story intentionally subversive to empire (not just the ""Disney Empire"").  However I have not found anyone else explicate these themes.  So I thought now is as good a time as any to do that.  And so here are my thoughts on the movie Shrek as 'imperial' critique.

Shrek is an Ogre.  A monster.  Something to be feared.  Those who are hunting for him with torches and pitchforks have their fantasy-projections of what ogres are like.  But is he really as bad as his pursuers think?  Perhaps monsters are mere projections of our prejudices and fears onto those who represent the unknown.  In this way, 'the other' is part of our mythologizing, whose identity is constructed by the dominant story-tellers of society.  Toward the beginning of the movie various 'others', the defected fairy-tale characters, are bought, sold, and rejected.  The motif of colonialism arises as the fairy-tale creatures are relocated to the mirky swamp by the orders of Farquad, and thus disrupting the ogre's peace.  (Recall the ginger bread man calls Farquad a ""monster"").

  King Farquad represents the ruling elite.  He is a white male with a Napolean complex - that is, he is short and often tries to appear taller than he actually is.  This is an indication of shame and part of his fabricating identity by bullying others;  rising to power is not merely compensation but is a contrived way of affirming his significance.  This is part of a very important theme:  Farquad is a pretend king.  He is playing make-believe, and whether he knows he is or not is a worthy conversation.  He seems to deceive himself by his making-believe and forcing the others to participate.  Notice his control of the authentic.  During a festivity his servants are made to display cards reminding the crowd to ""Applause"" or ""Boo"".  The magic mirror tells him what he wants to hear, but under threat.  He maintains his image with violence.  His power and glory are a fabrication that is established by a play of fear and of prejudice.  Most noteworthy and more central is his ongoing struggle to establish the ""perfect kingdom"" - and so he attempts to capture the ""happily ever after"" for himself.  Yet this ""perfect"" kingdom - with no ambiguity and perfect conformity to his liking - is really a utilization of social construction with which he manipulates his reality.  In this way the movie is suggestive of how people see themselves as within a story.

  There is a general understanding among anthropologists that we interpret our world through story, allowing our expectations to be shaped by them.  We assume the stories are prescriptive and so we live by them, when really they may confine our interpretation of lived experience.  Hence, the princess was waiting to be rescued by the prince.  The dragon was 'supposed' to be killed.  This is how one is ""supposed"" to find ""true love"" - a fixation the princess sees within a narratival framework.  The story isn't 'perfect.'  She learns that along the way.

  Within the theme of the imperial pursuit of the 'perfect' and its corollary dehumanizing of the other, a feminist critique can be found.  Notice the chivalry of Robin Hood.  Hood believes he is saving a damsel in distress.  This reflects the chivalrous will to establish identity in relation to the damsel by conquoring evil - the ""threat.""  Every classic horror film where a beautiful woman is victimized by a gothic creature serves to a particular perspective of good and evil through a particular construction of women.  According to the script, it is a scandal for a woman to be with an ogre.  This points to the complication of gender construction in an imperial context.  It is widely recognized by sociologists that the constructions of gender-relations are integrated with other social constructions such as 'race' and 'class'.  In general, the 'other' plays a role in the construction of power and privilege through its contradistinction from a construction of authentic humanity ('white', 'male', 'middle-upper' class).  Hence chivalry is part of a narrative construct of how masculinity is established in its distinction to the 'other.'  But this depiction of chivalry seeks to affirm adequacy or power in battle against an other - defining its power in terms of defeat and conquest, and restoration of a well-defined order.

  Moreover, in its presumption of the weak and passive role of the woman, there is suggestive here a weakness in patriarchy itself.  Both Robin Hood and Farquad need to fit themselves in a defining narrative whereby it is easy to manipulate their identity.  Robin Hood is insecure because he needs to define himself in just this way.  The Robin Hood scene nicely upsets the imperial/patriarchical assumption of chivalry.  The princess doesn't need Robin Hood's help.  In fact she sees herself as a victim of his presumed heroism.  Robin Hood's sing-and-dance routine reveals his motives are really not pure at all.  He is using the role of chivalry and its play on otherness (the ogre) to placate his desires (which may include remaining a hero of sexual conquest and earning or keeping the respect of his band of merry men).  Princess Fiona proves to be stronger than Robin Hood, revealing his weakness and deconstructing his facade.

  At the end of the movie, the princess kisses Shrek, the spell is broken, and she remains an ogre - only permanently.  It's actually as if her day-time identity as a fairy-tale depiction of a fair-maden is the fake - the curse.  It's not so much that Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, but rather escapes social construction.  King Farquad is exposed as a fraud, and his kingdom built on inauthentic and is itself truly anti-human.  The Shrek story effectively deconstructs the fairy-tale narrative - but does so in the formation of another narrative.  What I come away with is a sense that to live by a pre-scriptive narrative, and to mediate one's identity through it, is to be fake, inauthentic, and to transcend;  only in transcending the expected can we find what is true, good, and beautiful.

  Now, by explicating these themes, I don't mean to imply that there are no race or gender typology being used here.  For instance, all people in this movie are white.  Some may see the donkey character as resembling the stereotypical non-white side kick.  The hero is still a male.  At very least, I would like to suggest that these stereotypes serves the movies critique.

  In summary, Shrek is a commentary on empire.  The power of empire is its story.  It is in story that people interpret their role, through which they mediate identity and are predisposed in an interpersonal and political trajectory.  Story gives meaning.  The empire controls the story-telling of a society, and manipulates it in order to type-cast itself into the heroic and the salvific.",1228003200,,6902,4.896193771626297

1309592,5,B00003CXXI,"The original Shrek movie is easily the best in the series and for a variety of reasons that are pretty clear to most of the viewers. Unfortunately, the things that we can see wrong with the subsequent adventures seem not to be so apparent to the people behind the magic curtain. They seemed to focus on the slight things that might've been problematic in the first film and then magnify them to the Nth degree for the following episodes trying to propel the franchise on its faults.

The best thing about Shrek was that even a two-year old could sit and watch the movie in rapt attention without drifting away. Shrek has enough light-hearted childishness to propel it along, forcing the viewer to smile repeatedly. The fart jokes work, the tongue-in-cheek anachronistic references make sense and give the film a sense of backward-nostalgic appeal. Everything about the film from the fight scenes to the music and the gross habits of the ogre are all endearing. Mike Myers shines bright in this and comes off as a true original.

Shrek has a solid formula within the writing that doesn't take itself too serious. It also seems that it knew way back in 2001 that they were making a movie to compete with Pixar's 'Monster's, Inc', which was released around the same time. They also knew that they were targeting their audience somewhere between 3 and 13, but had hoped to make it appealing enough for adults. Well, they succeeded, because the film still stands up strong to repeated viewings and when you have a toddler, trust me, you'll be watching this movie a lot.

There's not much in the film to find fault with. All of the extras are interesting or fun and the movie is very kid friendly.",1224892800,,1691,4.667785234899329

What in the world is so hilarious about passing gas, for crying out loud, besides it being utterly embarrassing?  The animation by Pacific Data Images is first rate, although does not hold a candle in comparison to the scope, effort, and complexity that was placed in Square's ""Final Fantasy"". As for story, I've actually found the story in ""Final Fantasy"" to be more touching and more involving than the story of ""Shrek"". Don't get me wrong, ""Shrek"" has a decent story, but it's not quite as elaborate as ""Final Fantasy"".  (In ""Final Fantasy"", you may have to watch the movie a second time to get it. It is hard to follow, but it introduces a level of intrigue that makes it more interesting. If you can actually understand the story clearly, then it actually feels far more powerful than what you would originally think.)",1222819200,,913,4.595092024539877

1309597,5,B00003CXXI,"The original Shrek was a CG classic or masterpiece.  It's truly a work of art in the computer graphics field.  The detail in the CGI was AMAZING for its time and it still manages to impress me today.  Other animated films like ""Finding Nemo"" and ""Monsters Inc"" compare to the beautiful composure, however Shrek is dominantly more humourous.

The movie just has the word clever written all over it.  It can definately satisfy a group of young children while also managing to get some adults to laugh hysterically.  With this in mind I would advise some parents to view the content before having their children view the film.  There is some suggestive material and curse words hidden througout the film.  Most parents I've known have avoided showing this film to young children, so if you are one of those kinds of parents, I advise you to have them view some of the Disney films instead. Remember Disney did not make this film.

The voice-overs are great.  Some films have tried to make a great voice-over team and sadly failed.  Murphy, Myers, and Diaz definately raised the bar and set an example for CGI movies to come.  So pretty much what makes this movie work is the talent, humor, and clever animation.

So if you haven't seen this film, pay some tribute to American filmmaking and get this American Classic.  It was a huge success because it was such an original and fun film.  Don't miss it for the world.",1203292800,2,1413,4.618473895582329

But who doesn't love `Shrek'?  I mean I guess it has it's detractors but come on people, if ever there was an animated feature perfectly designed to entertain EVERYONE `Shrek' is that movie.  It's funny, fresh, entertaining and exciting.  In fact just about every scene is memorable and every character brilliantly crafted.  Kids love `Shrek', there is no denying that, but adults have plenty to adore as well.

The story behind `Shrek' is that of Shrek, a grumpy, lonely Ogre.  When Lord Farquaad banishes all the fairytale creatures to the forest Shrek finds that his secluded swamp is now more crowded than ever.  In a selfish attempt to gain sole custody of his land he agrees to rescue a certain Princess from her captivity for Lord Farquaad.  Accompanying Shrek on this journey is Donkey, a talking donkey who forms an unhealthy attachment to the miserable Ogre.  Princess Fiona is being held captive by a dragon in a tower far, far away awaiting her true love to come rescue her, breaking her dreaded curse with love's first kiss.  Shrek was not what she had in mind, but upon her rescue and journey back home is becomes apparent that Shrek and Fiona may be kindred spirits after all.

The plot behind `Shrek' is not the most original, I'll give you that, but its execution is as original as it comes.  `Shrek' plays out more like a spoof on every Disney cartoon out there (kind of like this year's masterful `Enchanted'); in fact a lot of former Disney characters appear in this film (and its two sequels).  `Shrek' has a lot of fun poking fun at the very characters and stories that inspired it and this leads to plenty of laughs.

Helping to create some extremely memorable characters is the cast of vocal talents.  Mike Myers and Cameron Diaz tackle the lead roles of Shrek and Fiona and do so splendidly.  Mike Myers has proven time and time again that voice work is his forte; I mean what would any of his `Austin Powers' characters be without their signature accents.  John Lithgow is hilarious as the devious Lord Farquaad.  He adds spunk and humor to every line.  Of course everyone talks of Eddie Murphy's brilliant voice work as Donkey (why is Eddie not in every cartoon?) and rightfully so.  With quick wit and Murphy's signature attitude he creates the perfect companion, the perfect sidekick equipped with an amalgam of memorable and quotable catchphrases (""We can stay up late, swapping manly stories, and in the morning, I'm making waffles!"").  One can't go without mentioning the expansive cast of supporting players though, because it's within the supporting players that we find many of our laughs.  Voice work done by Bobby Block, Chris Miller, Cody Cameron, Christopher Knights, Simon J. Smith & Conrad Vernon just to name a few deliver such memorable characters as Pinocchio, The Three Pigs, The Blind Mice and of course The Gingerbread Man (who's whole `Muffin Man' routine is my FAVORITE scene in the film).

Beautifully animated and magically brought to life `Shrek' is the animated film of this generation, a cartoon that paved the way for bigger and better animated spectacles.  It started here and so rightfully so it deserves our praise and admiration.  There is rarely a treat this sweet so dig in and enjoy every last minute of it.",1200441600,,3280,4.802139037433155
1309669,5,B00003CXXI,I bought this DVD for my grandkids.  They love it.  I admit that I laughed through most of it too.  Good for kids of all ages.,1198368000,,126,3.769230769230769
1309670,5,B00003CXXI,"I thought I had ordered Shrek 3 from NetFlix but received the first one instead. I had seen it earlier and since I truly enjoyed it, I decided to watch it again.  And guess what? It was just as entertaining as I remembered.

Shrek is so ""ugly he's cute"" and the wise-cracking Donkey is hilarious. They make unlikely traveling companions as Donkey attaches himself to Shrek as he heads off to regain his swamp by bringing a princess to a scheming lord who fancies himself to be the king.

Wait until you see the array of fairy-tale characters who've taken over Shrek's swamp. What happens to them? And what happens when Shrek meets the lovely princess? Will she accompany them willingly? Will she be forced to marry the despicable lord? Or will Shrek and Donkey save the fair princess and regain his swamp?

And most important, what is Fiona's secret? Shrek is pleasantly surprised when he learns her secret, and I think you will be too.

Unless someone else is a ""spoiler"" and has already told you, you'll have to see for yourself.  But whatever ... I'm sure you'll enjoy this simple story that's brought to life by such lovable characters.

I just returned this DVD to Netflix and have ordered Shrek 2 and 3, so I'll be reviewing those shortly. They'll have to be really good to be as good as this first one, but I hope they are.",1196726400,3,1330,4.516666666666667
1309671,4,B00003CXXI,"While the sequel wasn't bad it just wasn't as funny as this one. This is probably the only Shrek I actually care to own. I do plan on seeing Shrek the Third but I don't think it'll be this good.

Shrek: An awesome ogre who starts off like the mean old, grouchy Grinch and finally comes around. Before that though he bosses people around and is very rude to them all. He eventually simmers down and then falls for Fiona.

Donkey: This jackass is a hoot! Eddie Murphy plays the voice actor and he is as hilarious here as in some of his classic movies. Donkey is very, very silly but a little stubborn.

Princess Fiona is a royal pain. She wants to meet some imaginary prince who will be valiant, strong and handsome which we all know *they're* few, far and in between. She is pretty yet when dawn approaches she transforms into a ""hideous"" ogre like Shrek. Gracefully played by

Lord Farquaad: He's short, hotheaded and enticed by the Princess. Lord F. tries to marry Fiona but Shrek opens her eyes and she sees that she is right for him and him only. John Lithgow plays his role convincingly.

Hilarious. Pushes Envelopes. Witty. Interesting. Musical. Slightly Clichd. Animated Goodness.

1309673,2,B00003CXXI,"Superb for adults, rotten for very small kids, if you can believe that.  I'll explain: For many months, we've been allowing our tots to watch this movie (and other CGI-type ""classics"" like Toy Story I & II, Bugs Life, Monsters Inc., etc).  Of late, we realized, with horror, that our kids' recent aggression, and usage of snide and obnoxious remarks has been due to these ""modern kids classics.""---rude comments and demands like ""WHERE'S MY FOOD!!!"" (courtesy of ""Bugs Life""); ""YOU'RE STUPID!""; ""YOU IDIOT"" (Toy Story); ""YOU STINK""....and the like.  Even the brilliant (for adults, that is) Monsters, Inc., and this movie, have the characters castigating, berating, ridiculing, and being rude and contemptuous of each other.  Tots don't need to see characters being eaten alive by dragons, farting for entertainment, denigrating someone's bad breath, blowing-up mother birds with high-pitch signing so as to obtain the nest eggs for cooking, people being pilloried for being too short or different looking, etc. etc.
Maybe ""Finding Nemo"" is the least objectionable of the bunch.  In retrospect, all the CLASSIC Disney movies in our collection are safe, tame, and benign by comparison, and far less objectionable if even at all.  (e.g., Cinderella, Snow White, etc).  I wish we'd stuck to safer products for toddlers, like the afore-mentioned Disney titles, or The Wiggles, Baby Einstein, Bob the Builder, etc.  I choose politically correct but safe, over slyly entertaining and wickedly cutting-edge, any day!  Those ""modern classics"" are great for adults, what with their modern spin, dialogue, etc----but why give the kids a head-start on learning objectionable phrases and vocabulary that they're going to learn later from others? No one wants their kid to be the FIRST SOURCE of the poor habits and language being adopted by the other kids in the neighborhood and amongst the extended family.
The golden rule now in our house: If the adults enjoy it, and it's not tedious and boring, it's probably inappropriate for kids.",1193356800,8,2025,5.2253086419753085

1309677,5,B00003CXXI,"The answer to the question is that Shrek is one of a kind. Mike Myers is the voice behind the best-known ogre in the movie industry. Shrek lives in a secluded area of the forest, but when Lord Farquaad resolves that all the fairy creatures need to live in this area, Shrek's peace is seriously affected. Thus, he focuses on scaring everyone away, even though at heart he is a big teddy-bear. One day, he sees a regiment from the kingdom of Far Far Away capturing fairies. Lord Farquaad, the leader of the oppressors, thinks that the talking donkey deserves to be incarcerated, but Shrek cannot help himself and rescues the poor thing.

This is not the last Shrek and Farquaad will see of each other. The latter decides that he would like to marry Princess Fiona, but there is a small obstacle in the way. She is held hostage in a castle defended by a fierce dragon and many have succumbed in their rescue attempts. Therefore, Farquaad organizes a tournament to decide who should go to bring back his wife-to-be. You can take a guess as to who the lucky winner is.

This is not your typical fairy tale, and it is definitely intended for an audience a little more mature, but it is an enjoyable one. There is one word that defines this movie to the T: humor. The actors selected to give voice to the characters of Shrek (Myers), Lady Fionna (Cameron Diaz) and Donkey (Eddie Murphy) are perfect for their roles. The writers also did an excellent job in picking the jokes and the funny comments throughout the production are something to cherish.

There is also a wide selection of extra features in the two-disc DVD; including an area designated as Dreamwork Kids that allows you to select you favorite scenes, watch two music videos (Baha Men and Smash Mouth), and play interactive games and trivia. My favorite extra feature was the one that discusses the technical aspects of the animation, because this is one of the most amazing aspects of this film. Nowadays there are many examples of animation of this quality, but when ""Shrek"" first came out, it was one of a kind. Finally, the music completes the total package, since it blends perfectly with the different parts of the plot and it is catchy and enjoyable. Overall, a great effort that cannot be missed!",1187308800,,2260,4.630922693266833
1309845,4,B00003CXXI,I don't watch many animated features but I did watch Shrek and I thought it was an excellent movie.  The actors brought the characters to life and I really liked the movie. In fact we bought the other two Shreks.,1183593600,,212,4.3
1309846,1,B00003CXXI,"Well, I think that I've pinpointed the reason I hate this movie: I hate the main character.  He's boisterous, rude, mean, disgusting, and that ""soft side"" of his that's displayed later doesn't even come close to redeeming him.  In fact, if anything, it's awkward to watch because no one likes a whiney lovesick person, and they're even worse when you already hate them... that and Mike Meyers is a bad actor when it comes to displaying angst.  I'm not saying that it's because Shrek's ugly.  In Shrek 2, when he's handsome, I still found him annoying and repulsive.  I have no idea why Fiona fell in love with him.  Not that I was that big a fan of Fiona either, mind you.

Oh, and I agree with the people who said that the film contradicts its message by making Fiona an ogre at the end.  If they really wanted to be subversive to the fairy tale movie genre, they should have had her stay pretty and marry the ogre anyway.  Shrek's message is the same as Beauty and the Beast's, only it's two ugly people (or ogres) instead or two beautiful ones.  Way to stick it to Disney... not.",1183507200,5,1082,4.391959798994975

1309849,5,B00003CXXI,"The first time I saw ""Shrek"" I enjoyed it, thought it had some neat characters and really good animation.  But that was about it; I wasn't bowled right over and didn't see how it ranked up there with other animated movies from the early 2000s like ""Spirited Away"" and ""Lilo & Stitch"".  But quite a while later they brought out ""Shrek 2"", and more recently the third chapter, and they both looked good, and I decided that instead of going right into the newer ones, I'd go back.  Rent the first one over again and see if there was something I missed - even if there wasn't, it was pretty good the first time and would probably be a good refresher for the next ones.

  I don't know if the stars were way out of alignment that first time, or if I just wasn't in the proper frame of mind; but the most recent time around I enjoyed ""Shrek"" ten times as much.  So I stand corrected, it does belong up there in the same breath with ""Lilo & Stitch"" and ""Spirited Away"" and so on.

  In a fabulous kingdom, a monarch named Lord Farquand has banned all 'fairy tale creatures', and the elves, blind mice (3 of 'em), little pigs (3 again), and so on seek refuge anywhere they can, ending up en masse in the swamp around Shrek's wooden hovel, where Farquand's soldiers fear to tread.  Shrek is a big, green, powerful and occasionally bumbling ogre who isn't 'trying to be cranky while hiding his tenderness underneath' - he's sumltaneously a cranky lummox and a sweet-minded, noble creature of great heart (although that latter part is kind of a light hidden under a barrel for the first half of the movie).  So as not to give the whole story away, I'll skip to the jist - in order to force Farquand to lift his ban on the fairy tale creatures (thus enabling them to leave his home and leave Shrek in peace and solitude), Shrek agrees to embark on a journey (which a talking donkey named, appropriately enough, Donkey, accompanies him on) to rescue a sleeping princess from a castle guarded by a fierce dragon.

  The three main players of the show - Shrek, Donkey, and Princess Fiona - are brilliant characters who play great off of one another.  The supporting cast is loaded with colorful individuals (the Gingerbread Man is a great show-stealer), and the movie is full of humorous fantasy action and some great, often wry, wit.  If one wanted to quibble, I still think it could have done without as much of an emphasis on flatulence-humor, but when it's got as much prime comedy and as much heart as ""Shrek"" does, who wants to quibble?  It's got everything you want in an All Ages movie, full of charm, adventure, humor, love and fantastic visuals, and textured - like some of the old bugs Bunny cartoons - with extra, subtly hidden, little jokes and moments that older viewers will appreciate but won't elicit too many awkward-to-answer questions from three year-old viewers.  And as a last note, don't forget to stay past the end credits for some final treats.  It's priceless.",1181001600,,2971,4.52808988764045

It does have a few concepts that are not appropriate, but are presented in a way that is way over the heads of children adn does have a few scenes that very concervative parents may term violent or inappropriate.

1309935,4,B00003CXXI,"Shrek (Mike Myers) is an ugly green ogre who only likes life when he is alone.  Naturally, he's rather upset when his swamp is invaded by all kinds of magical creatures.  Seems that Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow) is trying to create the perfect kingdom.  And everyone knows that you can't have a perfect kingdom with magical creatures around.

But Shrek is not going to take this lightly.  Setting out with a talking Donkey (Eddie Murphy), he goes to meet Lord Farquaad to demand his swamp back.

But Farquaad has other ideas.  He's looking for someone to go on a quest for him.  The mission, to rescue Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) from a fire breathing dragon.  So he makes a deal with Shrek - rescue the girl, and he can have his swamp back.

Naturally, Shrek agrees to the deal.  But Fiona is not at all what Shrek thought she'd be like.  And she has a secret.  All this makes the perfect fractured fairytale.

This computer animated movie is a riot.  It takes many fairytale conventions and turns them on their ear.  There are also lots of great small gags, usually at the expense of a classic story.  And Disney.  Katzenberg obviously feels the need to get back at his ex-employer.  But, Disney fanatic that I am, I must admit some of those jokes are my favorites.  Along the way, the movie develops a great heart as well and subtly slips in a message about loving people for who they are.  The animation, while a bit rough on the ""extras"" is wonderful on the main characters.

The only problem with the movie, and it's a big one, is the crude humor.  Shrek's on ogre.  We get it.  Fortunately, these jokes lessen as the movie progresses.  There are a few jokes that are questionable for young children as well.

Of course, most of them probably won't get many of the jokes anyway.  This is a fairytale for adults.  And a fun one at that.",1171152000,2,1842,4.463855421686747

1309939,5,B00003CXXI,"When Shrek first came out in theaters it was instantly recognized as an animated classic.  The script, voices, and animation all combined to create a film that all ages could enjoy.  The humor caters to both children and adults, though there are times when the kids won't know why the adults are laughing.  And like every good animated fairy tale, Shrek supplies morals to the story -and these are blended in throughout the film.  Shrek, for instance, wishes people wouldn't judge him for his appearance.  Instead they just think Shrek is ""a big, ugly, stupid ogre.""  The only fault I could find with the film's logic is that Shrek and Donkey continually make fun of the king's short stature throughout the movie.  We don't like the king because he is BAD, not because he is SHORT!

  Overall this is a must have that you can enjoy watching time and time again.

Besides, just about everyone who will be buying this item will be buying it for SHREK 3-D anyway.  SHREK 3-D is a short animated segment that takes place right after SHREK.  It bridges part of the gap between SHREK and SHREK 2.  Shrek and Fiona are preparing to leave on their honeymoon, but before they can get very far Fiona is kidnapped.  Shrek and Donkey race off to rescue her and are led into a creepy cemetery where they find the ""gravestone"" of Lord Farquad.  Turns out Farquad is just a big of conniver as a dead ghost as he was alive.  He's led Shrek and Donkey there to meet their doom while he also kills Fiona by throwing her over a waterfall so that she will be his queen in the underworld.  The short doesn't add much to the Shrek series (though it does show how Farquad is eliminated for good), but it is entertaining.

SHREK 3-D comes with a set of 3-D glasses, but the short can be watched as a normal cartoon as well.  The short is actually a ride at Universal studios, but even before that the events of this little cartoon where distributed on a promo cd a year and a half before SHREK 2 was released.

ALOT IS GOING ON, BUT IT IS ALL FUN & HOLDS OUR INTEREST --

As with ""Ice Age,"" I found myself watching and re-watching this new, animated epic which has quickly become a favorite of our family -- children and adults alike. For some reason, my wife thought this film might be too ""mature"" for our youngest [age 5] to enjoy appropriately, but like ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"", the adult jokes go over the toddlers' heads without so much as an expectant look. Part of what makes this film so good is the way it lampoons the usual cliches. Somehow in the process, Shrek seems to avoid those overdone, tired cliches by suspending our disbelief and redefining the genre in a way we may not have expected [for a change] and moving the power of the story up a notch, keeping pace with the soaring technologies and budgets now available to bring these epics to us, the audience.

SHREK IS A FILM THAT WORKS & IS IDEAL FOR FAMILY TOGETHER TIME

Also like ""Ice Age"", the plot really moves cleanly and concisely and does not get caught up in song. Disney can make the songs work for the plot, but no other studio could have us humming ""The Bare Necessities"" 35 years after it was released in ""The Jungle Book"". In Shrek, the ending is satisfying, although it would be much like ""Beauty and the Beast"" ending with Belle becoming a beast too (courtesy of Jeffrey Katzenberg, the K is Dreamworks SKG)!

THE DVD & SPECIAL FEATURES --

The DVD played wonderfully and had hours of features that the kids enjoyed, with Eddie Murphy's character Donkey imploring humorously, ""PICK ME""! SHREK is a real winner.",1154131200,2,1802,4.495412844036697
1310042,5,B00003CXXI,"Whereas Pixar always focused on good, clean family fun in its pictures, Shrek came into the spotlight because Dreamworks decided to skew the jokes a little more towards the older audience, while maintaing the basic family-friendly atmosphere. It worked, and Shrek was the film that proved it didn't take Disney/Pixar to create animated box-office gold.

This first movie in the series still holds up well. Some of the pop culture jokes are instantly dated (this was done when everyone had to do a Matrix spoof), but others like the jabs at Disney are still hilarious. It helps that at its heart, Shrek still has all the usual fairy tale elements, albeit twisted. Myers, Diaz, and Murphy turn in top performances. And some of the dialogue is quite memorable (""Ogres are like onions"").

The dvd has some decent extras, as well as a sampling of dvd rom games that are better than most extras of this sort. It's still not a really loaded set, but it's good for a family release and worth looking into.",1153785600,3,997,4.724137931034483

So, we hunkered down to watch the film, and am I ever glad that I did. It was absolutely hilarious! This totally irreverent film pokes fun at many fairytale icons. Based upon the book of the same name by William Steig, this is a no holds barred, fractured fairytale, laden with humor, superlative animation, a great script, and a surprising ending. What more can a film lover ask for? It is simply a fabulous film that is sure to appeal to young and old alike.

Shrek (Mike Myers) is a giant, green ogre, who is definitely not a candidate for Mr. America. He lives a solitairy, sterile, and lonely life in a swamp. One day, his whole world is turned up side down. When the diminutive and evil Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow) decides to evict all fairytale characters from their homes, the homeless begin squatting in Shrek's swamp, and Shrek is outraged. After making the acquaintance of a loudmouthed, infectiously funny, talking donkey (Eddie Murphy) who has muscled in on Shrek's swamp, an outraged Shrek pays Lord Farquaad a visit, demanding answers about the influx of the homeless in his swamp. What happens at their meeting results in Shrek agreeing to rescue a Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) from a dragon's den and bring her to the ambitious Lord Farquaad, so that he may make her his bride. In return for a successful rescue, Shrek will once again be allowed to reign supreme in his swamp.

The adventures that the donkey and Shrek have in their determination to fulfill their quest are fun filled and funny. Shrek, who speaks with a soft Scottish burr, is an ogre whose size and fearsome demeanor is belied by his tender heart. Mike Myers infuses this gentle, green giant with a tenderness that makes the viewer fall in love with Shrek. The donkey is brash as only Eddie Murphy can be, totally irreverent and outrageously funny. John Lithgow is wickedly droll, as the size conscious, power hungry, scheming Lord Farquaad. Cameron Diaz, who probably had the toughest role of all, is fine as the fiercely independent Princess Fiona. As Ms. Diaz does not, however, have a distinctive voice, her characterization pales alongside that of the other characters and is the weakest link in this otherwise sensational movie. The film has a surprise ending that is utterly charming and novel. It is an appropriate one for this unique and fiendishly clever film. Shrek is simply a great movie, animated or otherwise.

Shrek is not a guilty pleasure for sophisticated movie-goers; it is, purely and simply, a pleasure.

When it comes to computer-generated motion pictures, Shrek has once more raised the bar - and this one was already at an impressively high level in the wake of Toy Story 2 and Dinosaur. Yet Shrek outshines them both, boasting the most impressive detail and most amazingly rendered creatures of any motion picture in its class. And, although the human beings still don't look entirely realistic, they're getting close. In fact, this is the first major computer animated film in which human beings have had a significant role (they played secondary parts in the two Toy Storys), and their appearance is such that we have no more trouble accepting them than we do in traditional animated fare.

Shrek is essentially Beauty and the Beast with a few clever twists. In the quirky, irreverent way that it views fairy tales and their conventions, it's not unlike The Princess Bride. Fans of those two stories will find much to like here. And, both kids and adults can play a game of ""guess how many famous faces we can see"". There are certainly a large number of cameos: Pinnochio (a ""possessed toy""), Snow White and the Seven Dwarves, Cinderella, the Big Bad Wolf, the Three Little Pigs, the Gingerbread Man, the Three Blind Mice, the Mirror (as in ""Mirror, mirror on the wall, who's the fairest of them all...""), and many others.

Our protagonist is an ogre named Shrek (voice of Mike Myers, using a Scottish accent). Except for scaring off the odd knight who comes in search of his hide-out, Shrek leads a relatively peaceful life, until the day that he stumbles into Donkey (voice of Eddie Murphy). Donkey is fleeing soldiers who are rounding up all the fairy tale creatures with the intent of resettling them. Unfortunately for Shrek, the local landholder, Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow), has decided to deport them to Shrek's swamp. This causes the irritated ogre, accompanied by his new best friend, Donkey, to head for the city of Duloc, where Farquaad holds court. There, he makes a deal with the noble - in return for getting back his swamp, Shrek will perform a quest and rescue Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) from the tower where she is held prisoner. The catch: she's guarded by a fire-breathing dragon. Farquaad wants Fiona for his wife (he chose her over Cinderella and Snow White), and figures that the ogre might be his best chance to rescue her. But what he doesn't count on, and what Shrek doesn't expect, is that the beauty and the beast will develop feelings for each other.

Many of Shrek's funniest lines (like ""a castle that big must mean he's compensating for something"") will go over younger viewer's heads, but there are still plenty that won't (""I'm going to save my ass"", referring to Donkey). The screenplay was obviously written with all age groups in mind. Shrek is not on such a lofty plane that children will feel as if they're missing something, but it isn't lobotomized in a way that will insult the intelligence of older viewers.

As impressive as the visuals are - and they are very impressive - Shrek wouldn't be the movie it is without a quartet of effective vocal performances. As this kind of animation becomes more prevalent, the importance of choosing the right voices will need equal care and attention. Voices help to define the characters, and a bad choice can do irreparable damage. Just as not all silent stars were suitable for talkie roles, so not all live-action actors can do vocal performances. Fortunately, Shrek has four capable actors. First and foremost is Mike Myers, who is known as a vocal chameleon. Without seeing his name in the opening credits, you'd never know it was him. John Lithgow plays Faquaad as nasty and short-sighted, but not really evil, which makes a pleasant change from the usual animated villain. Eddie Murphy shows that a real comic genius can get laughs without relying on his own facial expressions and body language. Murphy's Donkey is one of the funniest characters he has brought to the screen. (Here, he improves upon what he did in Mulan.) Finally, Cameron Diaz's princess is equal parts sugar and vinegar. She believes in true love and Prince Charming, but, like her Charlie's Angels alter-ego, she's not afraid to do a little Matrix-style [back] kicking.

The interplay between Shrek and Princess Fiona is sweet and tender, while the exchanges between the ogre and the ass are often barbed and subversively funny. Like The Princess Bride, Shrek breaks with convention, but not so far that viewers will be put off by it. And, while there is a happy ending (as there must be in any fairy tale, no matter how unconventional), it's not necessarily the conclusion that many people will be expecting (at least up until the 2/3 point, when the movie reveals its hand). First-time co-directors Andrew Adamson and Vicky Jenson (he has worked as a visual supervisor on other films, including the two Joel Schumacher Batmans; this is her first credit) have crafted a movie to be proud of, and one that will hopefully receive a lot of attention, even during the crowded summer season.

It has all sorts of funny and vulgar moments in it, and the characters are well put together. Shrek is both heroic, cool, funny, and everything a big, irritable green ogre should be. Donkey is annoying, but in a funny way. You should've seen the part where he sings, and then he says: ""And then I ate some rotten berries, man I had some strong gases eking out of my butt that day!"" It's a classic moment! Oh, and the best part concerning Shrek himself(as far as I'm concerned)is the part where he is with Fiona, and she says: ""Wait! Where are you going?!"" and then he replies: ""Well, I have to save my ass!"" The catch is, he doesn't mean he needs to save himself, he's referring to the donkey! Get it? HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! Okay, next we go to Princess Fiona! She is very beautiful as a human, and better looking than most ogres when she turns into an ogress at night. She is very feisty and has terrific karate skills which I enjoyed seeing. Finally, she has a good way of snapping when she needs something. Then there's Lord Farquadd, who is an excellent villain. He is evil and malicious, just like a baddie should be. And he's funny, too. He's so vile, yet he's two feet tall! Remember at the end of the movie where he keeps saying he will be king, he will rule all and he will be master of the world and all that stuff, but then he gets eaten by a dragon, and isn't seen again except inside the dragon! What a terrific part! Absolutely perfect! And what makes it even more humiliating for Farquadd is that he didn't just get eaten by a dragon, but a girl one! Oh, and speaking of Dragon, here is my opinion on her! She has always been my favorite of all characters in the Shrek movie(due to her power, beauty, grace, and of course amazing knack for being funny)and still is to this day. The fact she's a girl makes it even better, for I love the ladies! Oh, back to Shrek! This movie is absolutely wonderful, and gutbustingly funny!

1310306,5,B00003CXXI,"The three little pigs dancing breakdance. Pinnochio sold by Gepetto. Cinderella and Snow White fighting for the wedding bouquet. The seven dwarfs on a band rock. Can you imagine such a crazy story?

It's not a nightmare. It's Shrek, a a wonderful animated film that, among his many surprises, mocks classic fairytales.

The movie cleverly shows a tale similar to The Ugly Ducking, but in this case, the star is a green ogre that lives in a swamp and uses ear wax to light his home.

Close to Shrek's home, is the magic kingdom of Duloc (sarcastic) where lord Farquaad sends to exile all of the fairytales' characters, whom inevitably arrive at Shrek's swamp. From this point, a non-stop talking donkey becomes Shrek's sidekick, and they both make a deal with Farquaad to rescue Princess Fiona from a dragon-guard castle so she can marry Farquaad.

But in this story, the ogre will be the hero; the donkey the best friend, the prince will be the villain and the princess a martial arts expert with an obscure secret.

There's nothing sweet in Shrek, a fabulous parody of fairytales. The movie entertains everybody and has no mercy, while its dialogs spread pop culture references that adults will enjoy tremendously. The Macarena, Riverdance, Matrix and some more will have their stellar moment in Shrek.

And the heart of the film is his leading man, a beast not so ugly as he thinks and whose fear of rejection is masked with solitude and a bad mood.

The animation is more than extraordinary, particularly the detailed facial expressions and the skin textures. But the best animation wouldn't have made Shrek a success if it wasn't for his original story and fresh characters.

The message of the movie offers a true and timeless quality: we should not judge people based on their appearances, because like onions, all human beings have layers. We can't determine what's in somebody's heart just by looking at them.

Even an ogre like Shrek, who shut himself out from others, had deep inside a wish for company and friendship. Like we all have.",1121385600,,2046,4.806267806267806
1310307,5,B00003CXXI,"It took me a while to get into this film.  Blame it on an ogre with a Scottish(?) accent, an ethnic donkey, and a a bit too much information about bodily functions.  Definitely kid's unalloyed stuff.  But, deep down inside, I'm a rebel and a romantic, and very gradually I found myself cheering the lovelorn troll as he heads out on a quest to find someone else their one true love.

So mule and ogre head of across their world to defeat a dragon and rescue the beautiful princess.  Only the princess has a few surprises, Shrek's feelings get jumbled up, and nothing is quite what it should be.  If you've ever thought you were the ugly duckling, if you ever felt you weren't quite good enough, this film is for you.  For once, the fairy tale is turned upside down, we are reminded that beauty is what's under the skin, and yes, that ogres need love too.

This isn't a deep film, other than that it takes aim at all the phony and superficial values that people mistake for what's really important.  And that it does very well despite it's declared preteen audience.  Its message is universal, and it's reverse charm is infectious.  For all its fairy tale mimicry this is as much a film for the disillusioned as it is for anyone else.

The animation and music are excellent.  Characters are expressive and the writing takes repeated jabs at many of our fondest icons.  This is a laugh and feel good film, and we don't really get enough of those.",1120262400,17,1444,4.461832061068702

1310309,4,B00003CXXI,"Mike Myers is Shrek, an Ogre who finds he has a heart of gold. Happy just to bathe in the mud all day and dine alone by candle light (the candles are made with his very own ear wax), wants nothing more than to be left alone in peace. (He scares the occasional intruder without harming a fly) The peaceful existence is shattered when Shrek's swamp becomes overrun with refugee fairy-tale characters seeking asylum from the wicked Lord Farquad (voiced by John Lithgow). Living puppets, gingerbread men, dwarves, fairies and the odd talking donkey (voiced by Eddie Murphy) - all flee from Farquaad's onslaught to make his realm a perfect kingdom. Not caring much for Shrek's peace, Farquaad has his own ambitions. To become king, he needs to marry a princess. With the help of a magic mirror, Farquaad rashly settles on the lovely Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz), a lone waif trapped in the high tower of a palace besieged by a fearsome dragon and surrounded by a mote of fire. Shrek strikes a deal with the would-be king - Fiona for the return of his swamp. With the help of the talking Donkey, Shrek saves the princess and they set for Farquaad's kingdom of Du Loc, sharing some adventures along the way, but managing not to learn that the princess has some secrets of her own.

Shrek has a simple story, with a simple message - inner beauty counts - which clashes with the sumptuous animation but also with the ludicrous appearance of the villainous Farquaad. That said, this is a great flick because of the talent - Mike Myers does Shrek with his trademark Scotsman shtick, while Eddie Murphy invents a whole new facet as the annoying sidekick who never knows when to leave. The flick pokes fun at fairy tales (a page of which is consigned early in the flick as toilet paper; instead of waking the sleeping Fiona with a kiss, Shrek just shakes her violently awake), but also at Disney - the kingdom of Du Loc bares a facial resemblance to Disneyworld, complete with gift shops and, my favorite bit, an automated info booth obviously patterned on ""It's a Small World"". Shrek is a fairy tale, good for kids (who may miss most of the references) but aimed at grown-ups sick of the treacly sentiment of animated features from that...other company. As always, this is the VCR review, so I'm not vouching for DVD extras.",1119571200,,2313,4.6414634146341465

I eventually ended up watching it a while later, and regretted the fact that I didn't see it in the movies.  Though the movie is great for all ages, the adults would find something that they like, as well as the kids.

I'm not going to give away the movie, but I did like the story.  I'm glad that Fiona and Shrek got together, but at the same time, Lord Whatever (cannot spell his name if my life depended on it) shows us just how superficial we can be.  Heck, he didn't look all that good, either!

1310422,5,B00003CXXI,"Man, I feel like Rip Van Winkle after watching ""Shrek."" Let me explain. I rarely watch animated shows, let alone animated movies, so I was totally unaware of how much they've changed in the last ten or fifteen years. The only reason I popped ""Shrek"" into the DVD player was because I stumbled over a website that said this film earned a place in the list of all time top ten grossing movies. I couldn't believe that claim, considering it's an animated feature, so curiosity forced my hand. All I can say after seeing this DreamWorks production is WOW! When did they start using CGI for animated features? Moreover, when did they start using CGI to such great effect? I'm not totally ignorant, by the way. I'm aware that some animated films look like what I saw in ""Shrek"" since I've seen advertisements and stills from movies like ""Toy Story,"" but I had no idea of the depth involved in every frame of the movie. Most of the films I've seen with heavy CGI usually contain one or two scenes where the effects look simply awful or fail because the script puts the plot and characters on the backburner so as to make room for the computerized images. Not so in this movie: everything we see is a computer-generated effect and the characters stand front and center.

Shrek is, of course, a large green ogre with huge teeth and cone shaped ears voiced by the incomparable Mike Myers. When we first meet up with this lovable rogue he's hanging up no trespassing signs on the outskirts of his beloved swamp. Shrek likes his privacy because...well, he's an ogre and ogres need their privacy. Why would anyone want to hang around with an ogre anyway? They're ugly, crass, and mean. If the movie is any indication, they also like to bath in muck and offal. Fun. Nonetheless, Shrek soon discovers that faraway events threaten his self-imposed exile. The diminutive and evil Lord Farquaad (voiced by John Lithgow), in his evil way, issued an edict ordering the deportation of all the fairytale creatures from his domain. What a jerk! He sends the seven dwarfs, Pinocchio, a gingerbread man, and assorted other lovable creatures out into the cold, heartless world. The only place left to these poor wretches is, predictably, Shrek's swamp. The ogre opens his front door to find literally hundreds of talking animals, beasties big and small, and assorted magical creations slumming about the swamp. Enraged, Shrek embarks on a mission to Lord Farquaad's palace with the aim of obtaining the deed to his property. He takes along with him the talking Donkey (voiced by Eddie Murphy) as his sole companion.

Farquaad isn't one to cave into demands lightly, however, as Shrek and Donkey soon discover. The evil nobleman wishes to acquire a princess as his bride, and he promises to deliver the deed into Shrek's hands if the ogre will procure this woman for him. The woman in question is Fiona (Cameron Diaz), a beautiful young lady imprisoned in an imposing castle watched over by a fire-breathing dragon. Shrek and Donkey accept their mission and soon liberate Fiona from her prison, but things don't go quite right from this point forward. Shrek grows fond of the imaginative Fiona, and she of him, but their physical forms seem to prohibit any possible romantic union. After all, how can an ogre ever hope to marry a human princess? Well, in the fairytale world people aren't always as they seem. Fiona harbors an intriguing secret that would astound Shrek if he knew the truth, but Farquaad enters the picture before the ogre learns what's going on. Will Fiona marry the evil Farquaad and live unhappily ever after? Will Shrek muster up the courage necessary to rescue his beloved from the evil lord? Most importantly, will the ogre take Fiona with him back to the swamp so the two can share his cherished privacy? You ought to know the answers to these questions before the film even starts, but seeing how everything turns out is the fun part.

""Shrek"" is quite possibly the most enjoyable animated feature, television or movie, that I've ever seen. The secret to its success is difficult to summarize adequately in a mere paragraph. First, the voiceovers are wonderfully full of energy and emotion. Moreover, the animators made sure to craft the main characters so that they look like their actor counterparts, i.e. Shrek looks like Mike Myers, Donkey resembles Eddie Murphy, and so on. Second, the CGI effects are incredibly detailed, so much so that it's almost frighteningly realistic. Third, ""Shrek"" is contemporary while staying true to the old fairytale form. From the music by Smashmouth to the pop culture references to the multifaceted dialogue, modern audiences ought to find much to appreciate here. Speaking of the dialogue, I couldn't believe some of the stuff that came out of these characters' mouths. The part where Shrek points out Lord Farquaad's huge castle and says, ""You think he's trying to compensate for something?"" is absolutely hilarious. I couldn't believe he said it in what is essentially a cartoon. The movie's loaded with great double entendres that little kids won't likely understand but will keep adults engaged.

I'm not even going to get into the extras on the disc except to say there's some great stuff here that takes hours to watch. My favorite supplements included a look at Myers, Diaz, Lithgow, and Murphy doing the voiceover work and the behind the scenes stuff describing how the animators performed their computerized magic. I can't believe I waited this long to watch such a fantastic film. Sadly, the sequel isn't as good due in large part to an overemphasis on the pop references and adult humor.",1114646400,4,5635,4.842323651452282
1310423,5,B00003CXXI,"A modern-day fairy tale rife with cutting edge humor, Shrek is a computer-animated film for the ages. In the tradition of Disney (the recipient of a number of clever jibes throughout the movie), Dreamworks manages to create a film that adults (and not just parents) will enjoy as much as children. The comedy is clean, witty, and refreshing. The animation is mind-blowing, and the characters are as likeable as any ever created.

The story follows the life of Shrek (voiced by Mike Myers), a green ogre with a friendly disposition who lives in a swamp during medieval times. When ever-so-short, midget nobleman Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow) banishes all local fairy-tale creatures from his land, they are forced to resettle in Shrek's swamp. Shrek, who prefers to live in solitude, sets off, accompanied by a wisecracking mule named Donkey (Eddie Murphy), to find Lord Farquaad and convince him to leave the fairy-tale characters where they belong, and leave his leave his swampland alone. Lord Farquaad agrees to honor Shrek and Donkey's request under one condition. The odd couple must locate the beautiful Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) and bring her back to Duloc so that he can marry her (he chooses her as his bride over Snow White and Sleeping Beauty because he wants to become king). Although Princess Fiona is held in a tower guarded by a fire-breathing dragon, the task is one Shrek and Donkey are more than capable of taking on...

Shrek is quite simply of one of the best films of its time. The computer-generated image animation creates a fantastic setting filled with unique, groundbreaking characters. The storyline (basically Beauty and the Beast) is timeless, and the comedy manages to stand on its own in a movie that pushes the outer-boundaries of excellence. Eddie Murphy is at his best playing the Donkey, and Mike Myers may also have put in his best cinematic performance to date. Shrek is one of the few animated films ever made that should be seen by adults who don't have children (in other words, those who otherwise wouldn't bother to see an animated film). So if you haven't seen it, do yourself a favor and give Shrek a try...

I watched it again after enjoying it in the theatre twice when it came out and was pleased to discover that it not only looks remarkably clear but remains as funny today as the first time. Amid the layered humor and references to various fairy tales, ""Shrek"" has a message about judging people based on their hearts rather than their appearances that works for kids and adults alike.

1310511,1,B00003CXXI,"I wish there was a zero star rating, because that's exactly what I would have given it. I hate this movie with a passion. I don't think I've ever hated any other kids' movie as much as I hate Shrek. It's an overrated, inane, pedestrian, and completely pointless film. There's not an ounce of originality, imagination, depth or moral in it. What, ""looks aren't as important as what's on the inside""? Please. Make more fun of Farquad's short stature and small, er, manhood throughout the entire film, why don't you - now THAT will get your message across... And it's not even this hypocritical tidbit that renders the film's message void. A young woman like Fiona who belches and makes birds explode without any sign of remorse is bound to be called an ogre regardless of whether she turns into one at night or not.

It wants to be clever but it's not. It wants to be creative but it's not. It wants to be revolutionary but it is most definitely not. Its formula is trite and ludicrous: take a couple of famous actors' voices, throw it together with every character and storyline from classic fairytales you can think of, add badly-remade pop-music hits, and garnish with a monstrous amount of potty humor, and there you go. An instant ""masterpiece"". NOT.

This movie is trash. Don't waste your money or time, go see ""Monsters Inc."" or ""Toy Story"" or ""Finding Nemo"" or even ""Ice Age"" instead - all of which incite powerful emotions and teach important lessons a child can actually learn from.",1102982400,15,1490,4.661596958174905

Usually our taste in entertainment is miles apart from our kid's and grandkids, but this film hit a home run with me. I laughed so hard I hurt the next day. The really neat part is that no one character stole the show. Even though it kind of followed a traditional story line it was just enough different to keep ya guessing. The actors chosen to do the characters were perfect. Mike Meyers is a genius with voices, Eddie Murphy's donkey was absolutely right on. Great story, great characters and a happy ending...what more could you want? Highly recommend.",1101254400,6,712,4.484615384615385
1310513,4,B00003CXXI,"This isn't so much a review as a comment on some complaints on ""morals"" in the movie. One reviewer said that since the moral of the movie is bascially ""don't judge a book by it's cover"" Shrek shouldn't be making fun of Farquaads height. This is a fair point, and I can see why some might object. However in the DVD if you play the ""Filmmakers commentry"" Vicky Jenson makes the remark that

""We're not disaparaging short people. Farquaad has issues. He just can't recognize that of everyone he's kicking out,he would consider himself part of them, but he's got blinders. It's his own form of denial""

So you could argue that Farquaad is initially guilty of the hypocrisy. And since Farquaad sends Shrek on a quest to rescue a Princess so that he can have his swamp back which Farquaad populated with creatures initially, I think Shrek is entitled to some bitterness!

One reviewers commented that Shrek is an allegory for Americas foreign policy, where Shrek represents America, and the dragon symbolises the atomic bomb. Shrek plays the role of world policeman, like America. The ""vandalism"" scene in the church supposedly represents Americas centuries-old hatred of Catholicism. Well,
if you stare at flower design wallpaper long enough you can pick out certain patterns that can represent rudimentary human faces. The designers of the wallpaper sure didn't mean there to be but if the will's there, you'll see what you want to see. My point is that you could find some kind of pseudo allegory in any movie if you look long enough, regardless if the makers meant there to be any. What next, the shark in Jaws representing the threat of Communist Russia in the mid 70s?

Some complain of the crude humour. I don't care really. I watch Red Dwarf because it can be both intelligent and potty mouthed. It's the contrast between the two styles that I like. If everything was all intelligent, witty, charming and adorable in Shrek, it would be like candy floss. Appealing initially, but soon to overdose on the charming and become tiresome and sickly. And vice versa. That's just my opinion, and if others disagree then I won't argue. It's not about right and wrong, but about personal taste. The potty humpour to me is about being irreverent, not just grossing out for it's own sake. It's Dreamworks The Rolling Stones to Disney's The Beatles. (Hey, I like The Beatles more than Stones in general, but theres nothing wrong with taking a different approach!)

And finally the exploding bird scene, where some said that children cried in the cinema where they saw it. That scene is something that Monty Python might have used. Funny to some, but not to others. It's intentional bad taste. In my view that's the only scene that might warrant the ""Parental Guidance"" That's the only scene I personally have a problem with.

But frankly I don't watch Shrek for the ""morals"". It's effective on diffeent levels, and I enjoy it for the laugh out loud humour and the visual feast of it's graphics.",1100736000,8,2984,4.773255813953488
1310514,5,B00003CXXI,"I loved this movie!! It was a wonderful story about storybook love with a twist.

The best part about this movie is that you as an adult won't be bored with it. The children are entertained by the colors and the simple storyline, and you are entertained by the music and ALL of the jokes. IT IS HILARIOUS!

It was so refreshing to see a cartoon movie ending in such a way. Love winning over appearance, you gotta love that! It shows the viewer that appearance shouldn't be as important as our society makes it seem to be. The movie tells you that happiness can be found no matter what you look like, and above all you should love yourself just the way you are.

Very cute. Very clear. VERY funny. Very entertaining. Something you WILL watch over and over again when the kids get a hold on it. :)",1100563200,5,795,4.286666666666667

1310595,4,B00003CXXI,"I wrote a review titled ""Entertaining"" a short while ago (see below) praising Shrek while saying that the Donkey was annoying. Seeing it again I can now appreciate the humour of the character more, I suppose he's too frenetic at first impression.

And I say again that the ""adult"" content is very mild, and much worse is watched by kids on TV every day. And poot humour is something that all kids find funny, like it or not. But I still think the film is too short!

BTW the Shrek DVD I managed to obtain had an added 15 minute 3D section in an extra disc. If you liked the original you'll love Shrek in 3D!",1100304000,,607,4.224137931034483
1310596,2,B00003CXXI,"This movie is based on the book by William Steig.  I have not read the book but the movie was a bit of a disappointment.  The story is quite simple and proceeds in a very linear manner.  There are no real challenges, no twists, no setbacks.  Everything just moves steadily forward.

Shrek, an Irish-accented Ogre with a Yiddish name, just wants to be left alone.  But suddenly his swamp is filled with fairy tale creatures who have been exiled by a local lord.  Shrek decides to see the Lord and set things straight.  To get his swamp back, Shrek agrees to rescue the princess that the Lord needs to become a king.  Romance ensues.

That's really it.  Not much more at all.  Some of the movie makes no sense at all.  At first we see the Lord's men paying rewards for the capture of fairy-tale creatures.  In the next scene all of these creatures are camped outside Shrek's door.  Did they escape?  Why pay for their capture if you are just going to let them loose?  Although there are many cameos from popular tales, only two actually get used.  One is the Gingerbread Man and the other is the Magic Mirror.  Why have all of these characters if they aren't used?

The movie is rated PG and contains plenty of bathroom and adult humor and some strong language.  I personally do not feel this is appropriate for young children but you can make up your own mind.

All in all I was quite disappointed.  The extras are okay although in the quiz the writers did not know that sulfur and brimstone are the same thing.  Ultimately, I am happy that I waited for a very good price before buying this one.",1099958400,3,1594,4.398625429553265
1310597,5,B00003CXXI,"Shrek dominated the animated full length feature category in 2001 (and some would say it still does) and the reasons why are clear: The movie moves at a good pace, with excellent painstaking animation and perfectly chosen voices for the characters. There is much humor for both adults and children; I know even some comparatively conservative adults who brought this children to see this movie and they certainly didn't regret it! GRIN

In many ways the film (as you probably already know) sets the traditional fairy tale type of story on its head--the guy who saves the princess is an irascible ogre named Shrek, voiced by Mike Myers. Shrek has a somewhat manic Donkey (voiced by Eddie Murphy) for a pal. Donkey, as the donkey is called--will do anything for Shrek's friendship--except keep quiet. hahaha I thought that the donkey helped balance Shrek's irritable nature well into the film but perhaps the donkey could have been given a few more clever lines in the second half of the film. Then there's the princess. The princess herself is someone with whom we all can relate to because she's not really a beautiful image of perfection--in actuality she's not what she seems! (Don't want to spoil the plot here so I'm being vague; please understand!) Some other interesting relationships develop along the way involving a dragon, Lord Farquaad, who wants to marry Fiona, the princess, just so he could be king, and the fairy-tale people of other classic fairy tales! However, too much of the plot I am certainly not about to give away! GRIN

I was most amused by how the film pokes fun at classic fairy tales such as Snow White and Pinocchio. The most amusing lampoon was of Disney's Magic Kingdom which in the movie is actually the not too friendly home of Lord Farquaad. Watch it and see which famous Disney attraction is made fun of first! Hehehe

The animation and quality of the picture are excellent. The sound is excellent, too. But the good news is this: DreamWorks went much further! The two DVDs offer much more than just the film in both full screen and wide screen. Indeed, the list of extras on both DVDs seems to simply go on and on! There are many children's games along with numerous interviews and story plots that were deleted. There are some technical goofs which are good for another laugh and even a short featurette about the dubbing of the film for international audiences. You get to see how the drawing of each main character developed and there's even playing hints for Xbox Shrek games!

In short, please get this movie and enjoy it! It's a pleasure for whole family! Yes, as some reviewers pointed out, there is a handful of minor sexual jokes that could offend some adults but I think from the many parents with whom I've spoken these will go completely over the children's heads without their losing any interest in the film. Thank goodness for Shrek 2! I know what I'm watching next! GRIN",1099526400,3,2922,4.723529411764706

With a movie as visually interesting as this, it is not worth losing so much movie for an O.K. 3D short.

Buy the widescreen version instead.",1099094400,3,330,4.32258064516129
1310599,4,B00003CXXI,"I saw Shrek on video yesterday. I'm unaware of the general consensus about it, so termr like overrated or underrated can't really apply with me with that in mind.

I sat down to watch it in a bad mood. To be honest  I was wanting to hate the damn stupid kiddie movie, but ten minutes in the first smile appeared on my face and I looked forward to more. By the end I had laughed out loud a few times, tapped my toes to the music and actually read the title credits. My bad mood had been dispelled and was replaced by that most emabrassing of thing sto admit, a ""feel good"" factor. Yes, Shrek had cheered me up!

Okay it's not really a kid's movie I agree. Body functions and mild sexual innuendo are the main gripes. But unless you're a diehard Puritan I don't think it's that big a deal. Let your kids see if they want, that's my view.  None of the PG rated elements are going to  make much of an impact on them in my opinion.

There are a few problems. The Donkey is amusing the first 5 minutes, but there's is simply too much of him. You can actually feel Shreks annoyance at thim. Which isn't really something the audience should have to bear though! The plot is thin to say the least. (And to Americans who complain about the ""annoying"" accents- have you heard yourself talk?:P ) And it's too short!

But forget all that. Shrek is good escapist fun. People who find it cynical are being...well...cynical! Ireverent? You bet.  But anything sinsiter lurking within it's frames is a figment of your imagination. I find the CG images astonishing, and it's a movies that you can watch many times just to savour the images and see what subtleties you missed the first time around.  Although in theory CG animation is not much more than a deluxe cartoon animation, the fascination is that soemthing as clinical and soulless as a computer can produce something so full of life and character. And whether it's the Gingerbread man saying ""eat me!"" to seeing Snow White disco dancing with one of the Three bears, to the princess being subjected to a song and dance routine by Robin Hood and his Merry Men and saying ""man, that was annoying!"" fun is poked at fairy tale cliches. Yet it's always done good naturedly.

Flatulent ogres, belching princesses, crass humour ,thinly veiled statement on the state of America or what, or whatever criticisms, I DON'T CARE! As a piece of good old fashioned feel good entertainment Shrek is a winner. The finale of the the entire cast dancing to The Monkees I'm A Believer should make everyone laugh. And you know what? I'm ordering the DVD version through Amazon. Maybe these reviews do have a use!",1098921600,3,2630,4.506302521008403

1310601,5,B00003CXXI,"Shrek was hilarious!  There was so much comedy, and the story was so entertaining.  The characters were memorable, and each had something to offer.  For example, Shrek offered his loner personality, and yet, showed feelings for the brave and independant Princess Fiona.  Donkey is yet another comical character that deserves a lot of credit!  I think he is the best character I've ever seen Eddie Murphy play.  Even my parents thought this movie was funny, which shows that it's not childish humor.  The setting of the movie was interesting and original, too: A medieval fairy-tale land.

Overall, I would say this is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen!  I recommend it to anyone looking for a good laugh, but parents who don't approve of ""potty humor"" might find it to be crude.  Like I said, though, I think it's hilarious, and worth a watch.",1098576000,,851,4.767123287671233

1310603,4,B00003CXXI,"Perhaps the most pertinent thing to note about ""Shrek"" is that it's not a kid's film.  That may be ""old news,"" so to speak, but some are still not aware of that; I wasn't.  I rented this to watch with my 6-year-old daughter, and the film opens with a lovely little fairy tale about a princess and a charming prince who find true love.  Shrek then crushes the storybook and says with bitterness, ""Well, THAT will never happen.""

My 6-year-old gave me a look as if I had killed Santa Claus.  Fortunately she got past that and enjoyed the film, but its humor is occasionally mature enough that I wished I'd chosen a different film.

""Shrek"" is for older children and for us grownups.  It has the occasional mild profanity and sly sexual reference that make it less desirable for tots.  However, having said all that, yeah, it's a hoot.

Shrek (voice of Michael Myers) is a big green ogre with the temperament that goes along with the job description.  He's always been left alone because everyone is scared of him, and that's just fine with him, as we see from the opening scenes of exposition.  The film really picks up, however, when he gets unwillingly hooked up with an overbearing little donkey (voice of Eddie Murphy) who latches onto the large smelly title character like a leech, forcing Shrek to deal with someone other than himself, if only minimally.

Through a series of fairy tale turns, Shrek finds himself on a quest to release a beautiful princess from a dragon, where she (voice of Cameron Diaz) has been trapped by a horrifying dragon.  It's not giving much away to say that the story otherwise seldom resembles the tales inferred by those Rapunzel/Snow White/Sleeping Beauty trappings, but there is a familiar yet uniquely handled moral to this story that warms one's heart in spite of itself.

""Shrek"" walks the tightrope very nicely between being a grown-up take on fairy tales and still providing a solidly positive message.  I'd watch it again sometime....just not with a 6-year-old.",1097193600,3,2003,4.7485549132947975

1310704,2,B00003CXXI,"Shrek and its sequel are bland, trite, uncreative, wannabe-witty, and boring, but, inexplicably, both critics and audiences adore them. I've seen good movies, and Shrek is just not a good movie. Shrek is the Craig Kilborn of movies: it's smug and self-satisfied in its so-called irreverent attitude, while it faithfully repeats all the cliches it purports to lampoon.

How many viewers over the age of 4 didn't see the ending of Shrek (or Shrek 2) lumbering up Fifth Avenue? What a surprise! The princess chooses to be ugly! How incredibly irreverent in the most mind-numbingly politically correct way! What's the moral here? Be yourself? What attitude! What originality! Hamlet, step aside.

Hey, I know! Let's make a movie starring a kind-hearted but misunderstood hero with a witty, flippant sidekick! Never been done before. Oh wait, it has, but that's ok, because we're satirizing Disney! Let's fill it full of jokes that the parents will get but the kids won't! What a concept! Have we forgotten so soon what true attitude in kids' movies can be like? Can Shrek hold a candle to anything created by Jim Henson? I guess in the 21st century, jokes about bodily functions count as wit and attitude.

Shrek is product, plain and simple. Take big-name actors, throw in some snipes at Disney, throw in some crude jokes. But we have to make sure the movie succeeds: follow the standard cartoon movie story. Oh, we also have to make sure we don't offend anyone: Give it four or five passes through the political correctness machine.

I have to say that Eddie Murphy as the sidekick is funny. Restrained and subdued in a strange way, like the rest of the movie, but still funny. And Mike Myers does a decent job with the Scottish accent. I've seen many worse movies than Shrek; it's just that the obsequious fawning that everyone does is finally starting to get to me (can you tell?)

The Bourbon Chicken place at my local food court has a sign above it that reads: ""It's not spicy! You'll love it!"" I think that would be a perfect slogan for the Shrek movies. Shrek rips off Disney while claiming to parody it, while replacing Disney's warmth, humor, and character with cynicism, fart jokes, and cheap attempts at laughs.",1092873600,9,2219,4.783289817232376

1310783,5,B00003CXXI,"I sometimes manage to be among the last individuals on earth to see a blockbuster movie, and such is the case with Shrek.  Having finally seen the film, however, I will certainly echo the high praises it has received from those who have come before me.  Shrek is visually stunning, continuously hilarious, and uplifting in its message.  It's fun for the entire family, appealing to adults and children in equal measure, and it just makes you feel good after the credits roll.  The DVD throws in tons of extras, giving you more Shrek bang for the bucks.
The look of this film is amazing; animation has definitely entered the twenty-first century, and the guys and gals at Dreamworks are forging the way ever onward and upward.  You really have to see the animation in Shrek to appreciate it - I can tell you that it is in stunning 3-D detail, that each character has more incredibly realistic and subtle facial expressions than I do, that you could sometimes swear (especially when watching Princess Fiona) that you are watching real people on the screen, and that Shrek transports you to a world unlike any you have seen before, but that barely begins to describe the animation magic at play here.  The real proof of the pudding is in the details, and you will be amazed at all the subtle nuances you pick up each time you watch the film: you can see the wind in the grass, leaves blowing, dust rising, clothes wrinkling and moving naturally in relation to each character's body movements, hair stirring characters' hair (except for Shrek, of course, who is quite bald - not to mention green and altogether ogrely), etc..  The attention to detail is simply amazing, and I can't help but wonder why this film didn't cost about fifty billion dollars to make based on what I saw.
Of course, the incredible animation would all go for naught without great actors supplying the voices of the characters, and you would have to look long and hard to beat the cast of Shrek.  Start with the two funniest men in Hollywood, Mike Myers and Eddie Murphy, as Shrek the lovable ogre and his sidekick Donkey; then throw in Cameron Diaz as Princess Fiona and John Lithgow as the bad guy.  Myers and Murphy will keep you in stitches from start to finish.  I won't go into the whole plot of the story here, as I'm sure that information is pretty easy to find hereabouts, but I will say the story is incredibly witty and is truly the stuff that all-time classic films are made of.  While it turns the world of fairy tales on its ear, it does come bearing some important morals, the most important of which is the advice to not judge a person by his/her appearance.  Shrek is much more than a disgusting, disagreeable ogre, and Fiona turns out to be the least typical princess you could ever hope to meet.
The extras on the DVD give you a good idea of the creative process that went into bringing Shrek to life: storyboards of deleted scenes, an HBO special on the making of the movie, technical goofs, and an informative commentary by the filmmakers.  In terms of pure entertainment, you also get the complete extended dance party ending of the film, the means to jump directly to many of the funnier or more visually stunning scenes, music videos from Smashmouth and Baha Men, and a number of silly little games to play.  Consider all of these extras as icing on the proverbial cake, however, as the movie alone packs more entertainment than almost any other DVD you will ever find.",1087776000,,3463,4.591572123176661
1310882,5,B00003CXXI,"I love this movie because of the adorable little donkey. He is so cute! He is obnoxious, yet adorable and friendly. He is also the most underrated character in the movie. Shrek and Fiona would not have been anywhere without all Donkey's loving, sweet help. I say let's band together and give Donkey the respect he deserves.",1087257600,2,323,4.684210526315789
1310883,5,B00003CXXI,"Shrek is so funny. It starts with our hero Shrek(Mike Myers)who is a pretty amiable sort of ogre whose only goal in life is to live and let live. That is until Lord Farqaard (John Lithgow)tries to capture all of the fairy tale creatures, who happen to find solace in Shrek's swamp. An outraged Shrek demands that Lord Farquaard remove the creatures. They strike up a deal that if Shrek rescues the beautiful damsel Fiona (Cameron Diaz)from her fiery keep for Lord Farqaard, then he would remove the fairy tale things.
  So off goes Shrek, with his noble steed Donkey. A excessive talking donkey who lacks the capacity to be still even for a moment. They reach the keep which happens to be guarded by a female dragon who falls madly in love with Donkey. The princess is rescued and brought back to Lord Farqaard. But trouble pops up, Fiona has fallen in love with Shrek. But can she make him love her just in time before she marries Farqaard?
  A romantic antidoce that never lets you stop laughing. A clean and wholesome film for the whole family. A must see",1087171200,3,1058,4.523560209424084
1310884,5,B00003CXXI,"This review is about this full screen single disc edition. I got it only yesterday. I love it. I've seen ""Shrek"" several times through rental and watching it on a VHS dubbed in Spanish in a Spanish class. Seeing as how that was even funny, I decided to watch in Spanish for myself through the DVD simply because it's good learning. About the film itself, viewing it for the first time makes the viewer astounded. Shrek is a not-all-that mean but loveable green ogre,
the Donkey is adorable and the most comical character, Princess Fiona is absolutely gorgeous even when she becomes an ogre like Shrek, and Lord Farquaad is quite droll and persistent as the ""bad guy"" who seems to get a big head and wants to become king. Of course you might know about the ""I'm A Believer"" finale; that is the worth waiting for. The ""Shrek In The Swamp Karaoke Dance Party"" seems to pick up where the film left off originally. Thank goodness this little treat was included. It'll have you singing along and laughing! The voice talents of Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz, and John Lithgow are perfect cast picks. Personally, nobody could've done Donkey like Eddie Murphy. Perfect! About the DVD; flawless! When the menu comes on and the fairy tale charcters are standing around and Donkey hops up and down saying ""Oh, pick me! Me, me, me!!"", you could easily let that play forever. It's funny. There are more special features than those listed on the page. They include the filmmakers' commentary heard when you watch the movie, an HBO documentary, sketches of outtakes as the artist run through them, technical ""goofs"" (hilarious!), interviews with the characters (neat-o!) and more. The entire DVD is worth it. Wonderful music, neat scenery, and the humor of the loveable, memorable characters are such sumptious formulas. The scenery especially makes you want to be there. You'd also want to appreciate the characters and their feelings as if they were real. ""Shrek"" is such a fabulous movie for all ages.

1310888,5,B00003CXXI,"The hilariously perverse answer to the entire Disney fairy-tale franchise is the CGI-animated, solidly PG-rated SHREK (2001). Considering the fact that Jeffrey Katzenberg, the ""K"" in the still-new (and highly successful) Dreamworks SKG studio, worked for Disney in the early 1990's and suffered under an extremely acrimonious relationship with CEO Michael Eisner (who infamously referred to Katzenberg as ""that little midget""), this flip-of-the-bird spoof was inevitable. But this movie is not a letter of anger directed at Disney; no, it's a satirical ode *to* Disney---albeit one that is full of adult humor with a definite ""Saturday Night Live"" sensibility to it. Starring Mike Myers and Eddie Murphy---both of them ""SNL"" alums---this is a movie that makes many grownups laugh even louder than kids!
Mike Myers, as the titular ogre, gives one of his greatest comedic performances ever, doing basically a variation on his Scottish ""Fat Bastard"" character from the AUSTIN POWERS films (which in itself was a variation on his ""SNL"" character, the All Things Scottish storeowner---you know, the one who used to greet his customers by barking at them, ""If it ain't Scottish, it's crap!""). Anyone who wonders how an ogre with a Scottish brogue ended up with the name Shrek, here's your answer: Originally, Shrek was a German-accented ogre (sounding quite a bit like the Dieter character that Myers used to play on the ""SNL"" skit ""Sprockets""); however, during production, it was decided that the character came off funnier with Myers' hilarious---and dead-on accurate---Scottish accent. Because the film already had SHREK as a working title, the German name was kept for the character and the film. (The name was derived from ""schreck"" which is a German and Yiddish exclamation, used in place of ""Oh damn"" and ""Oh sh*t."") Just to be helpful. :)
Anyway, the tone for the film is set with the green ogre narrating the beginning of a typical fairy tale book, and then ripping out a page and using it for toilet paper---with Smashmouth's hit song ""All Star"" playing in the background! It doesn't slow down from there: soon, the aggressively alone Shrek is being pursued for friendship by a motormouth donkey---known simply as ""Donkey""--- whose life he saves, and who is voiced by an irrepressable Eddie Murphy (who also gives one of the most inspired comedic performances of his own career). Tasked with rescuing the feisty Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) from an ivory castle tower by the tiny and full-of-himself Lord Farquaad (voiced by an equally-inspired John Lithgow), Shrek and Donkey set out on...well, as the tagline says, The Greatest Fairy Tale Never Told.
You know all this already. Chances are, you have probably seen this incredibly rude and hilarious film more times than I have. So have your kids, I'm sure. (Although I do not believe this film to be appropriate for any child under the age of 8, I suffer not from any illusion that aussmes most kids under this age have not seen it by now.) Considering the fact that I first saw SHREK in the theater during the last glorious summer of 2001 and have owned it on DVD for the past two years now (seeing it probably about five to six times during this time), I can't believe that I have waited this long to review it here on Amazon. This was not by design; rather, I think it has been out of sheer laziness. However, laziness had nothing to do with my running to my local multiplex today to see SHREK 2, which has set a brand-new five-day opening record for any film---that's right, beating even the revered recent film made by Mel Gibson! It's an amazing film in its own right, but I'll get to reviewing it in a minute...in the meantime, the original SHREK is

1310889,2,B00003CXXI,"Most people are missing the point of the short film featuring Shrek. The short film is the tie in between the first Shrek movie and where the second one begins. The short feature is only 16 minutes long and was originally made for Universal Studios. I saw this film in October of 2003 knowing that the new Shrek film would be out in 2004. The thing is if you have seen this film at Universal Studios in Orlando Florida and try to see this film with 3-d glasses at home, you will be very disappointed. 3-d at home is a lose lose proposition. At universal orlando the 3-d effects were out of this world. As well at Disney World. They also adde elements of feathers on your heels, spraying of mist and even scent. I want the short and been trying to find it by itself but have been unsuccessful. You have to buy the short with the first movie. I do recommend getting the short movie because it is a great Shrek ""movie"" but I don't recommend watching it in 3-d. I wonder now what will Universal Orlando show because the 2nd one is out? I rated it two stars because 3-d movies like this one and spy kids 3d have poor 3-d quality when viewed at home.

1310923,2,B00003CXXI,"Some people absolutely adore this movie.  I really wanted to like ""Shrek"".  Unfortunately, and I know I'm in the minority on this, I didn't.  The tale is a promising one.  Beast (with a heart) meets Beauty (who has a secret).  They fight, fall in love, her secret is revealed, they fight some more, then end up together, in typical fairy tale fashion.  However, this story is told, infused with crude humor and really only one likeable character: the Donkey, voiced by Eddie Murphy.  Even this character gets obnoxious.  Anachronistic touches, like adding Joan Jett's ""Bad Reputation"" (a song of which I am a fan) do not further the story and bring into question what audience this movie is trying to reach.  (The lyric clearly says, ""I don't give a damn 'bout my Bad Reputation"").  Is this necessary in a family film?  I'm not a prude about language, but this doesn't add anything.

1310928,3,B00003CXXI,"Let's break it down.  This bundled package comes with two DVDs individually wrapped in separate keep cases: Shrek and Shrek 3-D.
Shrek - Great film.  Totally lame pan-and-scan version.  I envision two scenarios. 1) Dreamworks executives think kids won't enjoy letterbox on standard TVs and so bundled Shrek 3-D with the pan-and-scan version of the original. Or, more likely, 2) they figured they could charge a lot more for only 16-minutes worth of new material by only selling it with the dumbed-down release (read: cheapest to reproduce) version of the original, which was the 1-disc so-called ""full frame"" version, as opposed to the double disc, extras-laden widescreen version.
Shrek 3-D - Fun but short continuation of the first film's storyline.  The use of Anaglyph 3-D, rather than Field Sequential, is a shame but luckily there's a non-3-D version on the disc as well.  It's interesting to note that, despite the version of Shrek it comes bundled with, Shrek 3-D is anamorphic widescreen.
My recommendation: Skip this unless, like me, you absolutely must have Shrek 3-D for your collection (you can always sell the pan-and-scan version to a friend or on Amazon or eBay) or you have kids who don't give a hoot one way or another about aspect ratio or Anaglyph vs. FS 3-D and just love Shrek.

I HIGHLY recommend that you buy the ASIN=B00003CXXJ version of Shrek which is both Widescreen and Fullscreen DVD, with great extras. The Shrek in this DVD pack is just Full Screen, which is an insult to this amazing film.
Then, there's Shrek 3-D, which is a great ""4-D"" theme park attraction at Universal Studios. It looses some of it's funniness going from 4-D to 3-D...so see it at the theme park, in all it's glory. Here, it is only presented in Anaglyph (Latin for ""annoying""). The 15 minute short is presented in 2 formats, 2-D (why?!?) and Anaglyph (Red/Cyan glasses). Very bad move not to have included a Field Sequential 3-D version, which is what all the 3-D film lovers were readying their wallets for. Anaglyph looks like bad 3-D on all TVs, while Field Sequential looks great, but only works some TVs. Including both would've sold very well.
Lastly...there's NO ""Making Of Shrek 3-D"" on the 3-D DVD...just 2 versions of a 15 minute short, and an interesting ad/trailer for Shrek 2.
Skip this 2 pack. Buy the Widescreen DVD of Shrek. And hope they re-release Shrek 3-D in Field Sequential 3-D, with a Making Of, as a single DVD, later.",1084320000,34,1279,4.688888888888889

Just about all of the humor is adolescent-idiot crude and disgusting, that is, when it isn't aimed at sexual innuendo.  This movie is not appropriate for children at all (unless you want them to learn swearing and farting as a standard of humor).  I am truly disappointed with the movie ratings board for allowing the movie to get by without a PG-13.  And what is really awful, is that all of that crude humor wasn't even funny!
It's a real shame, because the story was a really great one for children, showing the value of open communication (instead of making assumptions about overheard parts of conversation) and judging people by their hearts and minds (instead of outward appearances).
The only thing that saved this movie from absolute dustbin status wasn't even in the movie.  There is an extra on the DVD (not sure about the VHS) that is a karaoke rap-sing using mostly old eighties songs.

1311197,4,B00003CXXI,"Shrek is a fun movie that pokes fun at other fairytales while being a fairytale itself.

Anyway along the way Shrek falls for the Princess and is afraid that she could never love a Ogar. The script gives us a clever twist where she's cursed and becomes Ogar at night time. Shrek doesn't know this though.
  Many call Shrek too vulgar but it's not that bad compared to other movies these days that are so called family films. It has a heart, it's funny and the voice acting is great. The short 3-D ride/movie from Universal Studios is just as entertaining and it's cool that it's being released on dvd. Anyway it starts off where the movie ended.

1311198,5,B00003CXXI,"Dreamworks Shrek is one of the best technical by then in quite some time
Shrek was not just a box office hit, but it was a hit among childrens and fans of all ages. Shrek's success lay on Dreamworks success formula of mixing in all their previous characters that audiences loved, along with making a great adventure that had audiences entertained.
I have watched the movie before several but the dvd is amazing, it's literally
like watching the movie all over again with the featuretts and some added
scenes .
The movie Shrek also had a great number of musical songs used in the movie such as Smashmouth's ''All Star'', Willie Nelson's ''On The Road Again'', ''The Pina Colada Song'' by Robert Holmes.
Shrek (Michael Myers) is not your typical fairy tale hero, which is another reason why audiences loved the movie. Shrek is proof that not every hero needs to be a tall, perfect being that rescues the princess.
Shrek is virtually a whose who of all fairy tales: Pinocchio, The 3 Little Pigs, The Big
Bad Wolf from Little Red Riding Hood, are just a couple examples of fairy tale characters provide not only humor, but another chance for kids and audiences to love their fairy tale character that they heard as kids.
Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow) evicts all the Fairy Tale Creatures from their homes, and makes them move to the swamp.
Farquaad in a funny scenes tries to capture the big, loving orge, Shrek outside his kingdom of Duloc, but Shrek defeats the men in a hilarious display including a spoof of wrestling.
The wrestling spoof done by Shrek is absolute hilarious is no doubt a shot at Pro Wrestling at it's best.
Farquaad helpless against Shrek, offers him the chance to get his swamp back but tells Shrek that he must complete a special journey to get his home back.
That journey of course entails not only Shrek defeating a mysterious dragon,
but a beautiful princess named Fiona (Cameron Diaz).
Fiona is the beautiful princess who is somewhat chained to Lord Farquaad
but who dreams of being rescued by a great knignt of course that's when
Shrek comes in...
The ending was a bit of a surprise but it was a welcome surprise, in fact
compared to that garbage of a movie called ''Shallow Hal'' , ''Shrek'' actually
does live up to theme of the inner beauty within someone to find love.
The DVD is loaded, I mean loaded with special features, in fact I think that the Academy Awards should add a category for best DVD'S because they are alot of great dvd's out there that deserve their awards.
The DVD of Shrek is one such great dvd, it comes loaded with many features including:
Trailer of The Film
Interview with the Cast of The Film (In their Animated form)
HBO First Look at Shrek
A Tech Look at the Making of Shrek
A Sneak Peek at other upcoming animated films
A Special hint section for the XBOX game of Shrek
A Special Dubbing featurette
and many more features!!!

From the information I've read on the web, this disc appears to be the movie that is used for the Shrek 4-D attraction at Universal Studios. And if it is, I could not be happier! When I visited Universal Orlando this past October (2003) I went to see this attraction 4 times. It is simply great. The story and quality of animation is as good as the original feature, and the 3D in the theater was clear and the best of anything 3-D I've seen. Hopefully the 3-D will translate to TV well, but even if it doesn't there will be a standard version as well.
Too bad we don't get the preshow for the Universal attraction as it includes some background information as well as lead-up to the short movie itself. Oh well, I have my home video for that. (...)
If you enjoy Shrek, I would highly recommend getting this disc. It carries the story directly from the last frame of the original Shrek, and has some information that leads up to Shrek 2.",1081728000,2,987,4.369565217391305

One scene that made me gasp, when I thought about the kids seeing it was when the prince looked under the covers while pondering his princess!  I couldn't believe that that was in a movie, where the majority of the audience is under 13!

1311265,5,B00003CXXI,"He's big. He's green. He's smelly. And he's funny all over. The name is Shrek, and he and his movie are one of the best things to come out of animation in a long time. I am kicking myself right now that it took me three years to finally see this magnificent gem of a film. Animation has really taken great leaps and bounds in the last ten years. With the release of the first ""Toy Story"" back in 1995, animation changed. The technology was more breathtaking and the imagery was as clear, precise, and beautiful as it can get. ""Shrek"" was different from the Pixar fair. It's animation was so detailed and rich, that sometimes you thought something looked real. I was also astounded by the clarity and sharpness of the animation to this film. The tale for the film, while quite simple, is steeped in traditinal fairy tale lore and has an epic feel and quality to it like any good fairy tale. Shrek The Ogre(voiced by Mike Meyers)lives alone in his swamp until one day he befriends a donkey(hilariously voiced by Eddie Murphy). Soon afterwards, all of the most famous characters from fairy tales, like Pinnochio, Three Blind Mice, Three Little Pigs, Gingerbread Man, and many others, have been banished to Shrek's peaceful little surroundings by the evil Lord Farquaad(voiced by John Lithgow). With the help of his new friend donkey, Shrek makes a deal with Farquaad. If Shrek finds and brings back Princess Fiona(voiced by Cameron Diaz), so that Farquaad can marry her and become a king, then Farquaad will give Shrek back his peaceful living existence. Then it's off for our two heroes to find and bring back the lovely princess. What follows is a fun adventure that has our two guys trying to save the princess from a scary castle and fire breathing dragon. What is most surprising, and ultimately different and refreshing, about the movie, is that it is not a typical animated film. The humor can get quite adult, as well as some of the dialogue. I was quite surprised when I heard some things in the film. This is what sets it apart from the pact, among a few other things, and it is it's riskiness in this area that makes the film stronger than most every other animation film. The voice talent is well cast and brilliant. Lithgow brings his usual brilliance to give a big voice to an evil character that is small in stature. Meyers does his usual scottish type schtick that he does all the time. But it's Murphy that gives the best performance and gives the movie most of it's bite. The characters, thanks in big part to the incredible cast, all have their own distinction and character to them. They are all three dimensional and that sometimes doesn't come off in an animated movie. The music selection is odd, but inspired. Where else are you going to hear the old Joan Jett hit ""Bad Reputation"" during an animated fight scene?. It's kind of like ""Moulin Rouge"" in that regard. Modern day music in a film that clearly takes place in a time long ago. The movie is so cleverly put together, intelligently written, and brilliant in it's artistic delivery, that it can't be classified as anything less than an animation classic and treasure. This is one for the vault.",1076889600,,3171,4.624113475177305

1311267,5,B00003CXXI,"Shrek is one of the best animated features to come along in a very long time (and I say this as a huge fan of Disney).  It provides excellent entertainment for all ages.  There may be some humour that is not overly appropriate for children, but it is done in such a way that the kids don't even catch it.  Dreamworks did an amazing job of bringing together big talent for such a piece of animation - and you can completley immerse yourself in the story.  Mike Myers is outstanding as Shrek (as usual) and Eddie Murphy is a hoot.  John Lithgow and Cameron Diaz are excellent additions to the cast.  Personally, I can't wait for Shrek 2 to come out - same cast, continuing the story - should be great!  I would recommend this DVD before any other.",1076803200,,745,4.316546762589928

This will allow Shrek to go back to his lifestlye of scaring the townfolk as the King promises to take back all the creatures that take over his swamp. What Shrek doesn't count on is that he would fall in love with the princess.
Sometimes a movie comes along that bridges the generation gap, this is one of them. While watching this with a female friend and 3 children it was amazing how at times we would be laughing at different things. The children would laugh at scenes that they remember but wouldn't laugh at the scenes we were as they hadn't grown up with the movies we did.

1311368,2,B00003CXXI,"The rivalry between the Walt Disney Company and Dreamworks S.K.G. never seems to get old as each one does something to out do the other though it usually involves Dreamworks copy-cating Disney's moves. For example, Dreamworks partnered up with the computer animation studio, PDI, which is eerily familiar to the partnership made between Disney and Pixar Animation Studios just a few years earlier. Their first feature film together, Antz, was a modest success compared to Pixar's A Bug's Life, which was released nearly one month after. Now Dreamworks once again turns to PDI to create a full length animated film based on a children's book entitled Shrek. Mixing in the voice talents of rising stars Mike Myers and Cameron Diaz as well the famous comedian, Eddie Murphy, might make this relatively modest feature a big hit. But are Katzenberg's intentions more then making an entertaining family film? Did somebody forget to mention it takes more then a few jabs at Disney and their fairy-tale oriented films? Bet Disney is real happy about that and they'll be even happier if it proves successful.
The story for Shrek takes a twisted look at the classic fairy tales like Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, and Pinocchio. The story goes that Shrek is an ugly, green ogre who lives alone in his swamp wanting only to be left alone and for travelers to stay off his property. But things don't go quite as they should when a load of fairy tale creatures evade his swamp and take over his home. It seems they were dumped there by Lord Farquaad in order to rid his perfect kingdom of Duloc from the ""fairy tale trash"". Among the creatures is an annoying talking donkey named Donkey. He befriends the crabby Shrek as they travel together to the kingdom of Duloc to talk to short-statured ruler. Farquaad agrees to hand over the deed to the swamp if Shrek fetches his new wife, Princess Fiona, from the keep of the fire breathing dragon. Along the way, Shrek discovers that it doesn't matter what you look like on the outside but how people feel about you on the inside. The story for Shrek seemed like any other fairy tale telling but falls way short of the classics. Too much time was spent picking on the Walt Disney Company and their fairy-tale animated films for much original ideas that worked.
Though the animated film showcases a wide-variety of voice talent, you really couldn't see that in this film. And in many instances, it is not the fault of the actors and actresses but rather the writing talent. Mike Myers, known for his comedic roles in such films as Austin Powers and Wayne's World, unfortunately down plays his comedic genius in this film. Myers isn't given much to work with here and when does fall upon something, it usually involved Donkey. The best lines of Shrek come from Eddie Murphy's annoying talking donkey named ...well, Donkey. The bad thing about this is that the side-kick draws too much attention away from the rest of the cast. Cameron Diaz, who voices Princess Fiona, is decent but nothing extraordinary unlike John Lithgow who voices Lord Farquuad. He is nothing short, pardon the joke, of spectacular and the movie-going public wouldn't expect less from a Shakespearian actor.
Overall, Shrek is a moderate film at best and doesn't even come close to living up to the hype that DreamWorks and the movie going public built it up to be. The problem is that there really isn't anything in the two hour feature that is all that original. Many of the jokes that are made are aimed at Disney and have probably been seen millions of times at one point or another. Is this the real reason Katzenberg agreed to the film? To make fun of his former bosses? If so then he needs some serious psychological help. But the bottom line is that Shrek lacks the greatness of other computer animated films like Toy Story, A Bug's Life, or Monsters Inc.",1072742400,4,3859,4.735512630014859
1311369,5,B00003CXXI,"""Some of you might die on this quest"" says the John Lithgow character Lord Faraquaad of Duloc, ""but it's a sacrifice I'm willing to make"".  There's plenty to love about this movie besides the great writing and wonderful banter between Donkey and Shrek, the animation is superb and the story has lots of under lying humor and subtly.
I've probably seen this about thirty times at least, because it's one of my two year olds favorites, and it's definitely a movie that appeals to young and old alike, the teens get into watching it too and even with multiple viewing it's never boring.  The dvd has some good extras including a great music video.
I'd highly recommend this to any as one of the greatest family movies ever, it's worth owning and watching over and over.",1071878400,,766,4.625

1311371,5,B00003CXXI,"Shrek is a hilariously funny love story that would be enjoyed by anyone age 1 to 100.  The movie combines life-like animation for the children, and wild humor for adults.  Known for their riotously funny and naughty humor, it's incredible how Mike Myers, star of Austin Powers and Eddie Murphy, star of 48 hours pulled off a movie for kids.  Murphy really delivers the donkey character.
  I laughed through the whole movie.  I'm not one to watch a movie over and over again, but each time the kids wanted to see it again, I was right there with them holding my side from the laughter.  The cast includes the voices of Mike Myers (Shrek), Eddie Murphy (Donkey), Cameron Diaz (Princess Fiona), and John Lithgow (Lord Farquaad).
  The action really starts when Lord Farquaad decides to rid the kingdom of all the fairy tale creatures by dumping them into a swamp area belonging to a fearsome orge, Shrek, who just wants to live peaceably and ALONE.
  In an effort to reclaim his swamp, the orge agrees to go on a quest for Lord Farquaad to rescue the princess and slay the dragon that guards her.  Farquaad would then marry the princess and become king.  Tagging along side of him is the sweet but chattery donkey.  Piece of cake!  This action pack movie never has a dull moment!
  Parents will enjoy the trip down memory lane with all the favorite fairy tale characters like Cinderella, Snow White, the seven dwarfs, Robin Hood, the gingerbread man, Pinocchio, the three blind mice, the three little pigs, and many, many more.
  I would definitely recommend buying this movie on DVD.  The game and music video is a must see.  For those looking for morality, it sends a wonderful message that beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and that God has a special someone for everybody.

1311372,5,B00003CXXI,"Mike Meyers is the voice of Shrek: an ugly yet endearing ogre who is sent on daring quest with the help of his loudmouthed donkey friend (brilliantly named Donkey, voice by Eddie Murphy) to rescue the somewhat annoying and feisty princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) by the evil spirited Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow), who is too much of a chicken to do it himself. He promises Shrek the deed to his beloved swamp back in exchange for the Princess. But, this journey gives Shrek a lot more than he EVER bargained for: friends, introspection, and love!!!
I love this movie and I love that my kids love this movie! During the course of the movie it is revealed that there is a spell on Princess Fiona - during the day she is a beautiful princess - but as soon as the sun sets, she is turned into a very much less attractive ogre. She is mortified by this and tries to keep it a secret, but by the end of the movie she realizes that beauty is not only in the eye of the beholder, but it truly is what lies within. I love that the movie sends this message out to young girls -- with so many movies out there that tell girls that they have to be beautiful or change who they are to be accepted (i.e. Grease, The Princess Diaries, Ms. Congeniality, etc.)... I'm glad to see that there is a movie out there that lets girls know that it's okay to be who you are and to be proud!
I recommended this movie for everyone!
And the DVD-Rom has a really fun feature for kids that lets them dub their voices to the characters lines exactly! It keeps kids entertained for hours!",1069545600,,1553,4.2677966101694915
1311373,5,B00003CXXI,"To me, it seems that people are overstating how much tweaking Disney's taking in ""Shrek."" Unless I missed something, fairy tales didn't begin with the House That Walt Built, and that's what ""Shrek"" spends most of its time chipping away at. (Of course, there's also a very funny riff on Disneyland when Shrek arrives to see Lord Farquar, but that's really it for pure Disney-bashing.)
Adults who might think that they've seen all the funny fairy tales they can handle should think again: While there's enough fart jokes, talking animals and slapstick to keep the kids entertained, ""Shrek"" is an adult movie, with low key racy jokes (kids who even notice the ""big castle compensating for Lord Farquar's deficiencies"" gag will likely assume it's talking about his height, or lack thereof), some very (post-)modern looks at fairy tales (Cinderella's described as being emotionally abused ... well, that sounds about right) and the nerve to say that the princess/Prince Charming fantasy so many fairy tales were built around is garbage.
Sure, anyone who's ever seen a major motion picture can guess that it ends up with ""They All Lived Happily Ever After,"" but any movie that starts off with an ogre using a book of classic fairy tales as toilet paper is going to get there in its own backhanded style. Surprisingly, ""Shrek"" steers around the pitfalls and never becomes cloying or trite or gives up on its own cockeyed realist view of fairy tales and destructive fantasies (as opposed to the perfectly fine and rather sweet, in their own dim way, fairy tale creatures endangered by the evil pro-rationality and pro-order lord).
While it's the writing that really makes ""Shrek"" work, John Lithgow and Eddie Murphy fling themselves into their roles, making what could have been fairly generic animated characters into memorable performances. Murphy in particular seems freed to do his best work when he's hidden from view as in ""Mulan,"" and Lithgow, whom many now only know through his goofy ""Third Rock from the Sun"" role, gets to stretch out his more threatening riffs, as he used to prior to landing on the sitcom.
""Shrek"" is that rarest of animated movies: One that's genuinely fun for the whole family. See it with or without kids, but see it.
All of this is further enhanced by a DVD package that, if not stuffed with extras, has all high quality additions actually worth checking out.
Highly recommended for kids from 8-80.",1069372800,,2423,4.912195121951219

I have to tell you... I could not stop laughing from beginning to end.  Mike Meyers and Eddie Murphy providing the voices for Shrek and Donkey are the best comedic pairing.  And Cameron Diaz is just as hilarious as Princess Fiona.
But it's the little things like the Gingerbread Man being tourtured with milk, Robin Hood and his merry men dancing like there in Riverdance, the fairy tale characters being sold, it's insane and funny as hell!

1311456,5,B00003CXXI,"I was totally blown away when I finished seeing this awesome animated movie at the big screen. I thought that the ""Toy Story"" movies could not be topped but ""Shrek"" proved me wrong. ""Shrek"" surpassed Pixar's previous movies and today, it is already a much-beloved classic. I don't know how they do but Pixar have managed to create a truly original story every time they make a movie. Not only that , their movies have had the fun and welcoming atmosphere to appeal to younger audiences yet also have enough sophistication and dialog to win over the adult audience and ""Shrek"" is one of the shining examples of such movies.
On this round of animated Disney fun, the typical fairy tale storyline is severely warped into a charmingly funny adventure starring a modestly unfriendly green Ogre named Shrek played by Mike Myers, a loquacious donkey played by none other than than the eccentric comedian actor Eddie Murphy, whose role in this rejuvenated his career which was going through a stagnant stage with turkey after turkey (""I Spy"" anyone?), and a princess named Fione played by Cameron Diaz.
The story begins with a huge solitary Ogre named Shrek who has enjoyed most of his life in peace alone on his swamp/home. However, the harmony of isolation is completely destroyed when one night, all of the Disney characters such as Cinderella, Snow White and her Seven Dwarfs, Tinkerbelle, and Pinocchio, are banished from their homelands and to Shrek's utter horror and dismay, to his very own swamp, which he hates sharing with others thanks to a tyrannical royal kind names Lord Farquaad. Back at his dungeon-like castle, Farquaad seeks to become king but his ambitions have hit a brick wall time and time again because he has to marry a princess in order to do so. Back at the swamp, Shrek tries to drive the cartoon exiles off his swamp but eventually gives in, and decides to confront Farquaad to return the `cartoon exiles' back to their homes. Along the way, Shrek meets a loquacious, eccentric donkey along the way whose talkative ways get on Shrek's nerves but in the end a strong friendship forms between the two as they go up against numerous forces to return the exiles back to their homes.
During that time, Shrek has to rescue a princess named Fione from a horrible dungeonlike castle that is guarded by an extremely `dangerous' dragon that breaths fire in order to `regain' his swamp back from the exiled beings. But from there, the so called fairytale is completely warped into a comedic adventure full of fun, laughs, and excellent storylines. But not only those make this movie great, it also has a highly important message about what true love really is about that personality is far more important than physical appearance and I tell you, it is for this reason taht ""Shrek"" is in fact, not only a great and fun movie, but also an important must-have for the ages. I tell you, even if it buts heads against ""Monsters Inc."" or ""Finding Nemo"" as my favorite animated movie, there is no denying that ""Shrek"" ushered in a new golden age in animated moviemaking.

1311457,5,B00003CXXI,"This great movie follows in the tradition of other animated films like ""Toy Story"", ""Ice Age"", and ""Monsters Inc."" where adults and children alike will enjoy it.  Shrek (Mike Myers) is a lovable ogre who wants nothing more than to live in his happy little swamp, but unknown to him, Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow) has revoked the deed to his swamp.  Meanwhile, Lord Farquaad has fallen in love with the beautiful Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz), but she is being held captive in a castle guarded by an angry dragon. Shrek wins a competition held by Farquaad to rescue Fiona on the condition that he gets his swamp back.  So, with his new friend Donkey (Eddie Murphy), Shrek sets off on his quest.
Finally, Fiona is rescued from the dragon, but Shrek is experiencing a feeling he's never felt before; love.

What will become of Fiona, Shrek, and Farquaad?  Will Shrek get his beloved swamp back?

1311553,5,B00003CXXI,"I loved 'Shrek' from the first time I saw it at the theater, and left thinking, 'that soundtrack was great.' I especially liked the track, 'Halleluiah' by Leonard Cohen.
Since then, I've made a digital recording (Tivo) of 'Shrek' and watched it 10+ times. (My wife says, 'Are you watching Shrek again? Well, yes I am ...)
From the opening minute to the closing credits, this film is a delight - visually, musically, and narratively. There isn't a wasted minute. And that is why I consider it a perfect film. From beginning to end you will be thoroughly entertained.
I love Mike Myers' voice as Shrek, and the animation gives him a real heart. Eddie Murphy as Donkey is superb. I guess Eddie might not appreciate this, but Shrek is a high point in his career. His constant prattle is hilarious. I still laugh outloud at his lines, and 10+ times later, I still cry when he meets Dragon at the stream.
The pop-culture references - 'Matrix' and 'Disney World' get reamed - still seem very fresh to me. And then Lord Farquaad meets his demise and Donkey exclaims, 'Celebrity marriages. They never last!' It's a very clever script, beautifully animated, beautifully execited.
There's a sweet message in Shrek, and it touches the heart.
It richly deserved the 2002 Oscar for 'Best Animated Film'. I just wonder, wasn't it the best film of 2002? Yes.",1056499200,2,1342,4.714893617021277

When the movie was on VHS I rented it, a bit reluctanctly must say, and took it home. I have to say I haven't laughed that loud and much for years!
You could say children will be more addicted to it, I concede that, but also adults will find entertainment and enjoy a bit more than an hour of fine humor.
The plot is really well thought and it makes fun of all those fairy tales you used to read when little (like Cinderella, Snowwhite and such).
The voices are excellent and Mike Myers & Eddie Murphy characterizations are superb!

Shrek is about an Ogre and a talking Donkey on a journey to rescue a Princess from a fire-breathing dragon so that Shrek can get his swamp back from all of the Fairy Tale creatures that have been evicted by Lord Farquaad in an attempt to make himself more popular.
There is so much adult humor in this movie!!  In all the times I've seen the movie - I still catch something new I missed the first 25 times around!! The animation is awesome! There's even a song at the end with all of the fairy tale creatures involved - be sure not to stop & rewind too early!!

1311557,5,B00003CXXI,"When SHREK came out in 2001, I was immediately convinced that it might be something of a breakthrough for CGI film.  While TOY STORY and the other Pixar films had been first rate and enormously entertaining, they were still primarily targeted at children.  SHREK, on the other hand, seemed clearly targeted at both an adult and child audience.  The humor appeals to kids, but has more of an adult sophistication.  It reminded me a bit of the original Rocky and Bullwinkle cartoons in this way, just as the movie as a whole seems akin to their Fractured Fairy Tales.  Whether the film is a breakthrough will be determined by what comes after it, but at the very least, it indicated that CGI could be used not merely to adorn a more adult tale, as in THE LORD OF THE RINGS or THE HULK, but could be used to create the entire movie.
The movie contains more wonderful moments of parody than in any other animated film.  The pastiche on Robin Hood (voiced by the French actor who played the bad guy in BROTHERHOOD OF THE WOLF) was superb, as was the brief take off on THE MATRIX during that sequence.  And no lover of the movie BABE will miss the great moment when Shrek pets Donkey on the head and says, ""That'll do mule, that'll do.""  Lord Farquaad's Dulac definitely is a parody of Disneyland, and there are scores of take offs on a variety of ""Fairyland Creatures.""  The movie even ends on a parodic note, with the Gingerbread Man mimicking Tiny Tim.
The movie looks awesome.  I have seen parts of this film a dozen or so times by now, and no part of it fails to be an utter delight to look at.  And while the figures all move a little stiffly, their appearance is a huge leap forward for CGI animation.  My only concern is with the teeth.  Why do teeth look so odd in CGI?  I'm sure they will fix it eventually, but the teeth need to look a heck of a lot more natural than they already do.  Interestingly, the huge, exaggerated teeth of Shrek and Donkey are less of a bother than Princess Fiona.
In most animated films, the voices usually could be better accomplished by professional voice-over artists, or as well done by a score of other performers.  That is not the case in SHREK, and unquestionably the case for Mike Meyers and Eddie Murphy.  It is not an exaggeration to assert that in both cases this is some of the best work either has done in film.  Like many fans of the film, I am delighted that all four principles.  In SHREK 4-D, a 15-minute short, Lord Farquaad returns as a ghost, which I assume will be how he will appear in the sequel.  In whatever form, his reappearance will be welcomed.  This will definitely be one of the films of 2004 that I will be looking most excitedly towards.",1054425600,2,2702,4.385542168674699

In order to reclaim his peace and quiet, Shrek agrees to go on a quest, with donkey in tow, to rescue the Princess Fiona and deliver her to Lord Farquaar.
The bare bones of this story only hints at the wonderfully demented sensibility of this movie, and the delightful ways familiar fairy tales are turned on their heads.  Kids and parents alike will love the many sight gags, one-liners and instances of potty humor.  Mike Myers and Eddie Murphy are just plain funny.

What's most impressive to me is the care and compassion with which the filmmakers treat the characters while still making sure that this film is a blast.
The story has its limitations, and it's not the most original of stories, but then again, neither was anything that Shakespeare wrote--Shakespeare borrowed well-known plots and created exceptional characters with wonderful lines, and I find the same thing here.  If you want to enjoy a funny, thoughtful, reverent film, pull up a chair and be ready to laugh, to be angry at the silly little king wanna-be, and to be sad that things might not work out for our hero and heroine--just enjoy this one, because that's what it was made for.",1051228800,,968,4.75
1311661,3,B00003CXXI,"WARNING : I give away the  ending of this film. Don't read if you haven't seen the film .

First, the film is funny, it has a lot of good lines, the quality of the work is very high....But...

I have misgivings about this film.

It's not the ""vulgarity"" of the film that bothers me, and let me take a moment to expres my condolences to the unfortunate children who have to put up with the parents who've ranted about the (very mild) belch and fart jokes in this film. Hang in there , kids ; age 18 is coming.

No , what bothers me is this :

Princess Fiona is a human female. Her genotype/phenotype is that of a tall, slender redhead. That's what she's MEANT  to look like. Her ogreish appearance after sundown and before sunrise is solely the result of a curse or evil spell, and it will be broken by ""love's first kiss"".

So she and Shrek fall in love, he kisses her....and she's left permanently in the ogreish form.

Exactly  WHAT message is that supposed to send, anyway? Is it ""don't judge by appearances"" ? Well, how *can* it be, when apparently Princess Fiona MUST  look like Shrek to make it believable that she truly loves him? Are we supposed to believe that if she stayed beautiful, she'd eventually  ""have to"" dump  Shrek and find someone her physical equal? If they  really, truly love each other, WHY can't Fiona keep the face and form she was BORN to have-why does she have to look like Shrek for it to be believed that she truly loves him? Far from being an antilookist message, it's as if the filmmakers are saying, 'if you're ugly, you'll only find true love with someone who looks just like you. Forget ""love conquers all"", or ""opposites attract"", and don't get above yourself : Your inner worth means NOTHING , it's only your outward appearance that counts.

Or is it rather that, as a female, Princess Fiona is just destined to be an appendage of whatever man she chooses, so of course she has to match her mate? Like she isn't an individual in her own right.

I really don't think I'm making too big a deal over ""just a kid's film"" here. Adults are allowed to just enjoy themselves and have fun with 'eye candy' TV shows and films, or beach novels. Everything for kids is so didactic it hurts, and no story for them is allowed to just be fun ; no, everything has to ""teach them a  good lesson"". Just like every freakin'  toy for kids has to be some educational instrument of torture from Zany Brainy or some boredom factory like it. Can't turn children into little production instruments too soon, can we ? How are they supposed to grow up and make good money so they can support their parents, if they're allowed to just play and fantasize and day dream as children?

So it's safe to say that this film is meant to teach children A Lesson....and I think it is quite appropriate to question just what message it sends.",1050883200,5,2841,4.387404580152672
1311662,5,B00003CXXI,"When I saw this one film advertised on television around the time of its theatrical release, I just saw it as an annoying and extremely overrated little kids animation with bad dialogue. Yes, the film was Shrek. Everyone was going crazy for it, and I criticised it for months. I finally caught onto the film when I reluctantly borrowed the DVD from one of my friends. My opinions totally changed. This film is hilarious! Easily the best animated film of 2001, Shrek dominated the box office worldwide, raking in almost $500 million and making almost the same amount in video and DVD sales in its first eight weeks on release. The film is simply remarkable, and boasts a fantastic script, beautiful animation, extremely humorous dialogue and some great twists. With all this secured, it is a film that is sure to appeal to people of all ages.

Shrek (Mike Myers) is a big green ogre, who is loathed by many other creatures who live around him. They see him as fat, ugly and clumsy. Because of this, he lives a lonely and miserable life. One day things take a turn for the worse when the heartless Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow) decides upon evicting all the fairytale characters of his land from their homes. They all begin to squat on Shrek's swamp - and he's furious. Along with an outrageous and hilarious talking donkey (Eddie Murphy) who has squeezed in with the other squatters, Shrek decides to pay a visit to Lord Farquaad demanding answers and a reasonable conclusion for the squatters incident. By the time their meeting has finished with Lord Farquaad at his castle, Shrek and the donkey have been selected to rescue Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) from a dragon's lair and bring her back safely so Lord Farquaad can marry her. If the mission is a success, Shrek will be free to rule his swamp without any squatters.

And so Shrek and the donkey set off on their mission. The action begins, along with the humour. The two argue all the time, but make a great comedy-duo. Mike Myers fills his role as Shrek with a determined effort that shines throughout the entire film, and makes you feel a range of emotions for the giant but gentle ogre. The compassion he emits in his voice for Shrek is wonderful. Eddie Murphy is equally successful in providing a simply triumphant voice for the donkey. Personality wise, the two have a lot in common; they're both brash, hilarious, outrageous and loud. And while the donkey is not the central part of the storyline, he definitely provides the most laughs and has some classic scenes. Witness his horror as the female dragon gently tries to seduce him, batting her eyelids as he just goes along with it all to save his own skin as he complements her on her dental hygiene! Cameron Diaz has perhaps the most difficult voice to play in Shrek. She doesn't have a character who is outspoken or permenantly angry to make the character memorable. Princess Fiona is a brilliant character, but Diaz is the dull link in a chain of excellent and radiant aspects of this film. Disney's past few films have all been badly produced and general flops at box offices. DreamWorks takes advantage of Disney's recent slump, showing them how brilliant child's comedy films should be made. Overall, this is a fabulous film that appeals to all ages, has a witty and charming conclusion, and is destined to become a future classic. A film that is definitely worthy of a sequel, Shrek is a winner on all accounts!",1050624000,,3434,4.683774834437086

But the unlikely hero of this movie is a green ogre named Shrek. He's a huge, scary monster who lives alone in his swamp, guarding it from any intruders. But in this land where the movie is set there are lots of other fairy tale creatures.
One strange animal is the Donkey, who knows how to talk. He's been rejected by his owner, and now he meets Shrek. What ensues is a hilarious and cute friendship that brings these two characters together to save the princess for the prince.

Sherk is a ogre and a loner to the highest degree.  He doesn't believe in fairy tales, and that point is made clear within the first 10 mintues of the film by a very outrageously funny scene in the out house.  Sherk isn't prepared for love, or friendship, but he finds both.
This is a film that the whole family can enjoy.  It is laced with adult caliber humor that is easily hidden from the children in your company by making them laugh at the same time due to a facial expression or action placed at the same time as the witty remark.

1311804,3,B00003CXXI,"Shrek got rave reviews over here, and everyone said it was brilliant.  I quite enjoy kids' movies (no blood, guts or horror ^_^) and I enjoyed other CG movies such as the Toy Story films, and Antz.  I also loved the idea of a movie satirising Disney fairy tales!  So I was very keen to see Shrek and had high hopes for it.
Maybe that was the problem.  Because although I wasn't shocked by the movie, I definitely didn't come away bowled over either.  I didn't mind the animation or the music, so what was it?
I don't really know, but having recently seen the movie again, I've come to the conclusion that Shrek has something nasty at its core.  I'm not sure what this is, but I do know that unlike Toy Story, Cats And Dogs or even the Hey Arnold! movie, Shrek leaves a bad taste in my mouth.
Maybe it's the humour, which is either adult or toilet-related.  Okay, that's partly a personal thing (I don't really get on with that sort of humour) but I would have thought that a movie that sets itself up to be a parody would be able to generate humour from satire rather than flatulence jokes.  In fact, I don't feel that the movie was a successful parody at all.  It was more like a Disney story with gross-out humour and a slightly manic/nasty edge to it - that is, the worst of both worlds.
The plot had some holes in it - why exactly did Farquaard arrest the fairy tale characters, and how did they then all end up in the swamp, for instance?  The characters were variable - I found Shrek unlikeable, Donkey was okay but swiftly got annoying, and Fiona was average.  I also didn't like the treatment of Fiona.  Note the way Shrek picks her up and carries her away, humiliating her because she won't do what he wants.  And the way he tries to shut her in the cave!  Also, how can people say the movie shows people can be good and evil, not one or the other?  Farquaard is just as wicked as any Disney villain.
There are some humorous parts to this movie, and some excitement, and some poignancy.  But it's not half as good as it's said to be, and as a biting satire on Disney movies, it fails miserably.",1041206400,2,2103,4.259445843828716

Eddie Murphy almost steals the spotlight in his highly entertaining voice of the donkey and Mike Myers does an equally good job of Shrek, an ogre, the main character of the film. The humour in this movie provides so many laughs and some of the jokes couldn't possibly have been aimed at children as they are often very mature and subtle!! The animation is fantastic and the cameos from favourite nursery rhymes/children's stories make the movie even more interesting for children!!
The music featured in the film is also a highlight!! It has a wonderful musical repertoire of remakes of old songs as well as brand new ones including ""I'm a Believer"" by Smash Mouth... the music in this movie will have you up dancing and to have it sung and performed by animated characters will bring laugter all around!

Don't get me wrong there have been others as well (like TOY STORY and TOY STORY 2), but Shrek really stands apart from them all because, it's funny, witty and a great movie all together.
Shrek (Mike Myers) is an Ogre who just wants to be left alone but because of evil Lord Farquadd (John Lithgow) who has made a declaration to find and rid his land of all fairy tale creatures. In turn, they all getted dumped into Shrek's swamp and he's not too happy about that. Along with his companion Donkey (Eddie Murphy), Shrek sets out to go meet with Lord Farquadd to get all of the fairy tale characters out of his swap. Farquadd then tells Shrek that he will get rid of them if Shrek can defeat a dragon and rescue sleeping Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) so that Farquadd can marry her and become King.

Not only does this movie deliver exceptionally good attention to detail in its computer generated images. (the maggots and slime..ewww)

1311809,5,B00003CXXI,"Have you ever noticed that all the other romantic fairy-tales always involve a dashingly handsome prince and a beautiful young princess falling madly in love at first sight and then living happily ever after (at least as portrayed by Hollywood)? I mean, how shallow must their knowledge and understanding of each other be! And love? Not to say there is no such thing as love at first sight, but marriage -- a life-time commitement after one kiss (in the case of Snow White)? And do we even know they are good people? Could it be possible that Cinderella would marry the prince just to escape her torturous life from the step-mother and step-sisters? And what do we know about the Prince Charming who revived Snow White with a kiss? Beauty and the Beast is probably as far as Hollywood had ever departed from the beauty and prince rule, but wait -- Beast is *really* a prince! How wonderful! And good for Beauty! Bottom line? It's not only unrealistic, but also devoid of any valueable lesson or even advisable message for today's kids and teenagers.
Enter Shrek! A totally unattractive, unorthodox, irreverent, a bit scary, but humorous creature who lives not in a castle but a swamp, who has no white horse, but an uninvited annoying donkey as his sidekick. The initial impression of Shrek isn't pretty, but we know he has a thousand times more personality than a poster prince whose character seems to be defined by his props. He may not come off immediately as like-able, but at least we see an individual, full of life, with his own thoughts and emotions.
By now you should know the plot already, which I won't repeat. It is to Shrek's creaters' credit that we automatically want to say, ""Wait a minute: this is all wrong! *Lord Faaqua* should be the one rescuing Princess Fiona, not *Shrek*!"" What a great setup! Part of the movie's attraction is how it deviates from the cliches of the traditional romantic fairy-tale. As the movie progresses, we become aware of our own prejudice with the realization that Shrek, just like Princess Fiona, is not what we perceived him to be in the first place. In the romance that ensues between the two, we see the wonder of love in the characters: true emotions; from joy, hesitation, to the attempt to resist love, to even fear. We see that love in fairy-tales can also happen between an average-looking princess who burps knows kung-fu and an ogre with bad manners but a soft heart, and that fairy-tale creatures do not have to be either absolutely perfect or pure evil -- much like the real world, actually. And we learn this in a movie that is didactic without being preachy or boring, but fun and hilarious!
Honestly, can you think of another fairy-tale movie that is as inspired, three-dimensional, heart-warming, entertaining, and morally conscious all at the same time? Then what are you waiting for? Grab your copy of the Shrek right now! Enjoy! :)",1039824000,,2899,4.7312252964426875

It is romantic, addresses moral issues in a manner that are not offensive, and includes a number of warm, beautiful songs that enhance the overall experience of this viewing.

Cons: Cameron Diaz's stiff acting could could take the animation out  of a cartoon - who knew?  After great work as a stright-woman for Jim Carey in the Mask and Ben Stiller in Something About Mary I had high hopes, but I think she had too many lines.  Or maybe they were written down.

Shrek was so lovable and the princess was not your normal princess. She was rough and tough. I was shocked when she turned into an Ogre. That was the LAST thing I would have expected to happen!!!!

1311897,5,B00003CXXI,"Shrek is one of the greatest films of all time.  Although it appears to be a children's movie, the humor has been directed at all age groups and maturity levels.  My family loved it so much, that we've passed it on to even my grandmother!  The simple jokes and allusions (especially to Lord Farquad's height) are creative and sly.  Although Shrek (Mike Meyers) does a fabulous job in this film, I would have to say that Eddie Murphy (Donkey) steals the show with his witty commentary and wisecracks.  You must see Shrek, whether you are a kid or an adult.  Don't be ashamed to rent it...the guy behind the counter will understand.",1037059200,,630,4.580357142857143
1311967,3,B00003CXXI,"Based on William Steig's bizzare backwards fairy tale, DreamWork's SHREK has fantastic animation, great voice casting and infamous ""irreverent"" humor. An ogre and a donkey rescuing a princess for an under-endowed King. How cleverly post-modern. Ha and indeed ha. Yes, it's a worldwide cartoon phenomenon or something like that. Now don't get me wrong, I like the recent movies like this one that trade traditional cute jokes for movie lampooning and irreverent gags, but I find it hard to avoid the fact that this ""hilarious"" comedy is somewhat overrated. Shrek (Mike Myers) and Donkey (Eddie Murphy) are a good odd-couple and there are some great jabs at Disney throughout the film's running time. But fart gags and weird humor aside, it's not as clever as it thinks it is. There are some fantastically funny moments in the film, especially the gingerbread man sequence and lines like ""In the morning, i'm making waffles!"" And the escape from the dragon's castle is a tour-de-force of fantastic animation and strange gags. However it's far more funnier if you take it as the sum of its parts rather than the movie as a whole. It may sound like just knocking success, but if you actually sit back and watch it, well, it really depends on if you want to sit through a cartoon with gross-out humour and fart gags. From a technical standpoint, the CGI photo-realistic water and fur simulation is brilliant. Since the success of TOY STORY, computer-generated cartoons have come a long way and it's impossible to deny that the CG is impressive. But then, so was the CG in Godzilla (Lesson: Impressive effects do not a good movie make). Watching SHREK in comparison to Pixar's competition MONSTERS INC, the latter is a more clever premise. Shrek gets 5 stars for animation, but it's a 3 star movie for laughs. the DVD extras are impressive though, with Commentaries, mock interviews, 'making of' docos and trailers.",1036972800,,1909,4.913312693498452
1311968,3,B00003CXXI,"Shrek tries desperately to be funny, in a Disney's Aladdin sort of way.  And, sometimes, it is.  Amazingly, as Disney's movies descend further and further into mediocrity, and as digitally animated films like Toy Story and Monsters, Inc. deliver mildly amusing kiddy jokes, Shrek seems almost witty by comparison.  The trouble is, however, that there are more witty insights and genuinely intellectual humor in a single episode of the Simpsons than in all of Shrek.  It's fairly easy to see why.  Shrek has the look and feel of an edgy film made by a committee of bankers.  Again, there are clever moments here, but nothing great.  It's simply too bad that this represents perhaps the best animated film in years.  That's the state of the art, unfortunately.
Mike Myer's voice characterization is bland and unremarkable ...  One can only imagine how wonderful it would have been to have Chris Farley voice the lovable green lump.  Chris died, of course, before he could complete his work.  Eddie Murphy is similarly forgettable.
Finally, the ""inside"" Disney jokes are okay, but just that.  Put some bright teenagers to work and they could come up with stuff that is much funnier.  I've seen it happen, in fact.
I'm not disappointed I watched this.  It's pretty good.  And it gives some hope after seeing awful movies like Ice Age.",1036972800,,1330,4.875

1311973,3,B00003CXXI,"What is there left to say about Shrek that has not been said? Who knows? My own feelings on the movie are like an onion.
First, I love Mike Myers as Shrek. He is a disagreeable yet lovable hero. From the opening shower seen to the closing song, this movie is dependent upon Myers as the lead--and he does not falter.
As for Murphy and Diaz, this is the best movie from either of them in a long while. The eagerness of the Donkey fits nicely with Murphy's talents. Diaz does pretty well as the straight man (straight princess I guess).
The true joy for me in Shrek were the (fractured) fairy tale references and the subtle (and not-so-subtle) digs at Disney. In particular the scene where Shrek and Donkey arrive in Lord Farquaad's realm cracks me up. The photo is priceless.
Enough of my rambling though. Shrek is a funny, funny movie. If you haven't seen it--I suggest you do so. I know I'll be watching this one again.
I give Shrek my heartfelt recommendation.",1036713600,,962,4.471590909090909

It's a pretty funny movie and there're some moment that'll make you burst out laughing, but I felt that Mike Myers and Eddie Murphy's performancer her toned down. These are two of the funniest men in hollywood and if given the freedom, they could have made one of the funniest films ever, but that's not the case. Not that they're bad in the roles. They both do fine jobs, just not up to their usual stanards. John Lithgow is a wonderfully incomptent villian. His role let him really strut his stuff and show of his comedi skillsThe graphics in this film are really nice. They remind me of video game graphics  in their style, but they're much smoother and more detailed In my opinion, the best part of this movie were the stabs towards Disney and the totally twisted takes on fairy tale character (the interigation of the ginger bread man in priceless)All in all, this is a good film to kill a couple of hours, it's fun and a decent film for the entire family",1036713600,,1052,4.422680412371134

Beside the amazing graphics, the story line was what you would expect without being overly predictable.  But the real story is the characters.  Mike Myers was a phenomenal Shrek.  The voice, it's accent, and inflections really made the character both funny and endearing.  Eddie Murphy was beyond hysterical as Donkey.  In fact, Donkey was a real scene-stealer.  This is an instant classic that you should be able to enjoy time and again.  You can't not like this movie!

1312026,4,B00003CXXI,"Disney has often followed on a set of ""guidelines"" to making all of their films work: a beautiful princess in some kind of peril (ie: Sleeping Beauty is under a spell to make her sleep, Snow White ate the poisoned apple, Cinderella wants to go the ball, etc.). These films often work on some level, but originality is often lacking in fairy tales, which always come from some source. Plus, they teach lessons that don't exactly behoove the viewer, often the impressionable young child (lessons in infatuation--what fairy tale didn't have some prince with a superiority complex wanting to be king, and spotting a beautiful girl from across the room, and saying ""She's the one.""???? You NEVER see Prince Wonderful courting Lovely Lady around, do you? Ok, ok, I'll get off my soapbox now. ""Shrek"" completely goes against the grain in terms of fairy tale concepts by adding a whole new twist to the genre, and the result is nothing short of spectacular.
Shrek (voice of Mike Myers) is an ugly green ogre living in a ramshackle house in the swamp by himself, without a care in the world. When Lord Farquaad (voice of John Lithgow) banishes all ""fairy tale creatures"" from the land, Donkey (voice of Eddie Murphy), who talks too much, escapes from his owner and the clutches of the people who are taking him away, and goes to Shrek's swamp and begs Shrek to take him in, and Shrek unwillingly does just that. When all the fairy tale creatures are dumped on his property, Shrek complains to Farquaad. Farquaad, a diminuitive lord with a superiority complex, wants to be king, and after consulting his magic mirror, he sees the woman he would like to have for his bride, and tells Shrek that he will remove the fairy tale creatures from his property if Shrek can bring him his future bride, Princess Fiona (voice of Cameron Diaz).
This movie is probably one of the funniest animated movies I've seen in a long time. I'm a Disney fan, but I've strayed from their ""fairy tale"" pictures due to a lack of interest, and have geared my interest to different (and original) animated stories. This one is truly original in every way, even though it recycles familiar fairy tale characters (the 7 dwarfs, Pinochio, Cinderella, Snow White, Little Red Riding Hood, etc), but in a humorous way. The actors themselves (Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz, and John Lithgow) are great in their parts, and the supporting voices and characters are what makes this film great. There are so many inside jokes that this movie would tend to fly right over a child's head. there are also alot of sight gags that the viewer would easily miss the first time around.
I don't have one absolute favorite scene, because this whole movie was hysterically funny and smart. However, some of them stand out in mind. The ""gingerbread man"" was classic, with the famous cookie lying on a cookie pan, legs broken off, with a glass of milk next to him. His ""tourture"" was getting dipped in the milk and the threat of his buttons getting ripped off. When Farquaad tells him to confess, Gingerbread Man screams ""Eat me!"" and spits. Another great scene was the ""Merry Men"" singing their song, which turns into the suspended-motion scene from ""The Matrix"" with Fiona lifting into the air in the ""karate-kick"" motion, the action freezes, the angle rotates, and Fiona kicks two Merry Men at the same time. The part with the magic mirror was also hillarious. I like how the mirror was honest with Farquaad, informing him that ""he really wasn't a king, and this isn't a kingdom,"" to which Farquaad gestures to Thelonious as to what happens to a ""lying"" mirror (Thelonious punches a small handheld mirror), and the mirror counteracts ""...but you can be king,"" and shows three different women, ""Dating Game"" style. The scene at Farquaad's amusement park was hillarious, especially with the ""It's a Small World""-esque puppets singing.
This was a great film, complete with a great cast, and is a fun story. This definitely breaks all those rules that fairy tales tend to set (and believe me, rules were made to be broken). I am anxiously awaiting the sequel in 2004, and highly recommend this to everyone and their 5th cousin once removed (LOL! just kidding). This is a great story of romance and wonder, and it is sure to be a hit for years to come.
Donkey: Hi, Princess. Fiona: It talks! Shrek: Yeah, it's getting him to shutup that's the trick!

1312028,4,B00003CXXI,"The movie Shrek is certainly a winner, but some of the music selections could have been better in order to set a tone or the mood of certain scenes. For example; the raunchy rock music used when Shrek and Donkey first arrived at Farquaad's castle and do battle with his guards was bad and loud. However, the rock song ""Im A Believer"" at the end of the movie was appropriate for the scene. The music selected throughout the movie, with a few exceptions, was brilliant and moving and was appropriate for the scenes. The theme music at the begining of the movie which sports the DreamWorks logo is just epic, although the naration started just before the last few notes was somewhat disappointing because the music here is so beautiful and so moving that you'll want to hear every note.  The music used at the end of the dragon chase was excellent. The movie's theme of not judging a book by its cover, and the aspect of falling in true love, and the meaning of true friendship, are strong themes throughout the movie. The picture quality was first-rate. The attention to color, texture of objects, contrast, lighting, and shadow detail puts pressure on non-animated films to do as well. The shadow detail that could be seen in the dimly lighted Dragon's castle was great!
A DVD dub with an audio over-ride on certain music selections will turn this movie from a four star status into a five star movie.

Part of the reason I find Shrek so wonderful, is that this is a hero that we can all relate to. So maybe our table manners are a bit better, but we can all relate to some of the emotions that are expressed. Underneath the ogre is a prince with a very tender heart. And perhaps another reason, without giving too much away, is that this movie shows that you don't have to look beautiful to be beautiful. The sly jabs to Disney and other pillars of children's entertainment kept both my children and myself laughing, and a sense of justice is held.

Shrek our hero is sent out to find the princess so our king err prince can truelly claim his title.

1312161,4,B00003CXXI,"Shrek is on of a long line of growing computer animated movies that began with Toy Story. Each movie becomes more realistic. The characters almost look like real people and animals. The story centers around an outcast Ogre who finds his swamp being invaded by fairtale creatures. These fairytale creatures have been evicted by an evil ruler lord Farquaad. Lord Farquaad decides to get a wife. He chooses the lovely Princess Fiona. But Princess Fiona is held prisoner by a fierce dragon. Shrek the Ogre is sent on a quest with his donkey sidekick voiced to perfection by Eddie Murphy. In return he wants to get his swamp back.
Shrek basically pokes fun at the fairy tale gender. One funny scene is when Lord Farquaad tortures the gingerbread man (who sounds a lot like Mr. Bill of Saturday Night Live).Eddie Murphy was his hysterical best as the voice of the donkey.
The basic message of this movie is that one must not judge a person by his or her appearance. The quality of the animation is amazing. Each movie is more realistic. Final Fantasy and Disney's Dinosuars are the nmost realistic to date. Computer 3D modeling and animation is a rapidly growing field. There are many software programs on the market.

From the kids point of view it has characters and color and action and lot of slapstick cartoon humor. For the adults it has innuendos and under tones and a lot of intellectual humor. The subtleties of the dialogue and action of our main characters cannot really be appreciated until you have seen this movie more than once.
The story is great. There is an ogar named Shrek who wants to be left alone in his area of the forest. Due to an egocentric and selfish `shot-sighted' king - ruler, Shrek is invaded by all the old fairytale character every created by the Brothers Grimm and all the other fairytales we grew up with and loved. From snow white to Peter Pan, Robin Hood, Goldilocks, the Gingerbread Man, the Magic Mirror, Pinocchio and a talking Donkey. A talking Donkey you say...hence the adventure begins.
From this point forward the two opposites (Shrek and the Donkey) must convince the king to get rid of tall the fairytale characters but they found out there is a price.  They must rescue a princess from a mean dragon.
The movie is best represented by the talents of Mike Meyers (Shrek), Eddie Murphy (The Donkey), John Lithgow (The King to be) and Cameron Diaz as Princess Fiona - these are the people that make this humorous and touching.
The DVD extras a really great. A bunch of stuff for the kids but for the adult there is the documentaries and the detailing of the computer animation process.

One day Shrek finds a flyer posted for cash for fairy tale creatures and figures out why there hunting him.
Trying to get cash is an old lady giving away her talking donkey named Donkey. Donkey runs away and bumps into Shrek and takes an instant liking to him. Donkey is voiced by Eddie Murphey. Donkey asks to stay with Shrek and after much resistance he agrees.
That night Shrek finds out that a whole bunch of fairy tale creatures have been sent to live outside Shrek's swamp by order of Lord Farqquad who is voiced by John Liftgow. Farqquaad wants everything to be perfect untill he learns from a Magic Mirror that he is not a king and has to get married.

I think that the humour in Shrek is a little more cutting, and therefore appeals more to the older viewer (I'm 30), and the film also doesn't quite indulge with the schmaltz factor as much as the TS ones did. Also, even though the rapport between Buzz and Woody is great, the same can also be said of that between Shrek and Donkey. I've already seen Shrek about 5 times, which says quite a bit considering that animated films aren't normally a genre I normally go for.

1312326,4,B00003CXXI,"""Shrek"" has been hailed as the greatest thing in animation since sliced bread, if sliced bread had ever been animated. ""Shrek"" has been hyped to death and won the first ever Oscar for Best Animated Feature Film.
Make no mistake, this movie is great fun. Mike Myers is great fun as Shrek, the ogre with the Greta Garbo complex, whose quiet existence in his swamp is disrupted by Lord Farquaad, voiced in hissably evil style by John Lithgow, who has evicted all the local fairy-tale creatures and dumped them in Shrek's swamp. Shrek and his unwelcome new side-kick a talking donkey, voiced hysterically Eddie Murphy), reach a deal with Farquaad to fetch the short prince a bride in the form of Princess Fiona, voiced by Cameron Diaz, who they must rescue from a dragon's lair, complete with fire-breathing dragon.
All well and good, and lot's of fun is to be had by all. Parents should be warned that this film has a harder edge than Disney's typical animation, and the ""PG"" rating is well-deserved.
But there are problems with this film. First, there's the troubling Hollywood hypocrisy. This film's laudable message is not to judge other's on their appearance. Great. Swell. So what do we have? A villian with a Napoleon Complex, and a slew of short jokes.
Also, a great deal of the humor in this film comes from the skewering of Mouse, Inc., not that there's anything wrong with lampooning Mickey & Co. The jokes are great, the problem is that there are so many Disney gags that the film gets sidetracked at times, disrupting the pacing of the film. One get's the feeling that a lot of the praise this film has received has been because there has finally been a legitimate animated film produced by someone other than Disney.
Despite these flaws and cautions, ""Shrek"" is a whole lot of fun. Eddie Murphy steals the show as Donkey. Mike Myers gives Shreck a Scottish accent, and Cameron Diaz has fun with her role of Princess Fiona. While the Disney bashing detracts from the flow of the film, the jokes are hysterical and the satire is dead-on, and well deserved.
This DVD contains a number of nice goodies, such as the kaoroke number and some storyboards presentations of deleted scenes, and it has a fun and enjoyable soundtrack.
I reccomend this film despite the flaws, as the fun factor for ""Shrek"" is as big as an ogre.",1025049600,2,2325,4.673170731707317
1312327,5,B00003CXXI,"Although marketed as a kids' movie, SHREK is one of those films with layers. (Much like an onion, or an ogre...) Our antihero is a reclusive green scary ogre (Shrek, voiced by the excellent Mike Myers) who lives in a swamp. His sidekick, an enthusiastic talking donkey (Eddie Murphy) who has decided that Shrek is his best friend. Shrek, unused to people trying to befriend him instead of running away in terror, reluctantly lets Donkey stay with him. When his swamp is invaded by an assortment of fairy-tale creatures, a deeply annoyed Shrek is determined to talk to Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow), who has evicted these creatures from Duloc. Unfortunately, the only person who's willing to accompany him on this journey is the ever-eager Donkey, and so they set off, Shrek regretting this decision every time Donkey opens his mouth. (""The trick is getting him to shut up,"" he laments.)
On arriving in Duloc, Shrek finds himself caught in the middle of a competition of knights to see which one will earn the ""right"" to rescue a sleeping Princess Fiona from a castle. (""Some of you may die, but it's a sacrifice I'm willing to make,"" the vertically-challenged Lord Farquaad, who wishes to marry her, tells them.) He ends up being chosen to go on this mission, and in return, he will get his swamp back.
In one of the ""awww!"" moments of the movie, Shrek manoeuvres Donkey across the rickety bridge to the castle by shaking it until Donkey makes his own way over, rather than turn back. It's a perfect example of how fond Shrek has become of his friend, although he would never admit it. On finding the princess, he unceremoniously drags her out of there. Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) is not impressed. She was expecting a more romantic rescue, and is disappointed that the helmeted Shrek won't even recite an epic poem or a sonnet for her. (""A limerick?"" she suggests in desperation.)
""You didn't slay the dragon??"" she asks in horror as the fire-breathing monster comes after her and Shrek. As it turns out, though, the dragon is female, lonely and looking for love - which she finds in the form of Donkey. He isn't too pleased about this. ""I'm an asthmatic!"" he pleads.
As the three journey back to Duloc, Fiona grows past her initial horror at Shrek's appearance, while her lack of helplessness is shown as she successfully fights off an attacker. The Merry Men show up, of course, and do a bit of Riverdance. Shrek and Fiona blow up reptiles and hand them to one another, walking along romantically with their animal balloons. Donkey and Shrek's late-night conversations point out Shrek's hidden loneliness and isolation. ""They judge me before they even know me,"" he says sadly. And how could a beautiful princess like Fiona ever love such a hideous beast as him?
But the beauty of this film is that these misfits - the ugly ogre, the lonely dragon, the talking donkey, the cursed princess - suit each other perfectly. It plays with the stereotypical fairy tale characters (lord, ogre, princess) and turns them on their head, while giving us a happy ending that tells us that beauty really is in the eye of the beholder, and that love and friendship are wonderful things to have. So the moral of the story is . . . ogres are really lovely people, talking donkeys are fun to have around, and if you're an evil diminutive ruler of a kingdom, you might just get eaten by a dragon.",1024876800,3,3380,4.691919191919192

Donkey won't talk for the kingsmen, so ends up getting away, until his former owner knocks over a fairy in a cage and donkey can fly.  Only then does he start talking and the fairy dust wears off and he comes falling from the sky.  The kingsmen run after him, and Donkey hides behind Shrek.

1312383,5,B00003CXXI,"Not unlike ""Beauty and the Beast,"" ""Shrek"" engages the viewer to know beauty is what is beyond the skin.
The DVD is loaded with extras, but frankly, you might not bother with them. Your kid will play with them, exploring them once or twice, but the movie is the real treat. The mock interviews with the characters are intriguing, and worth watching. The re-voice studio is a hoot, and you'll dig showing it off to your friends, but it loses its novelty soon enough. Because it is a DVD, your kids can watch it into eternity without worry of it wearing out.
Lithgow is very Lithgow, much the same personality as he was on ""Third Rock from the Sun.""
Cameron Diaz's princess character looks remarkably like her.
Eddie Murphy makes a great sidekick. I was skeptical that he might be too over-the-top, but found his voicings to hit the tone perfectly, with great comedic skill. In short, he's hilarious.
The movie is packed wirth allusions to old great movies and cartoons, mostly Disney, and adults will smile everytime they discover a new line or sequence from a movie they grew up with. Watch for ""The Princess Bride,"" ""Robin Hood,"" ""The Sound of Music"" and a bevy of other homages.
The ending surprised me, but I'll not spoil it for you.
I fully recommend ""Shrek.""

1312391,5,B00003CXXI,"When my nineteen year old son suggested that we watch Shrek, I only grudgingly agreed, especially as he had already seen it. Still, how often can one get a teenager to do anything with his mother? So, we hunkered down to watch the film, and am I ever glad that I did. It was absolutely hilarious! This totally irreverent film pokes fun at many fairytale icons. Based upon the book of the same name by William Steig, this is a no holds barred, fractured fairytale, laden with humor, superlative animation, a great script, and a surprising ending. What more can a film lover ask for? It is simply a fabulous film that is sure to appeal to young and old alike.
Shrek (Mike Myers) is a giant, green ogre, who is definitely not a candidate for Mr. America. He lives a solitairy, sterile, and lonely life in a swamp. One day, his whole world is turned up side down. When the diminutive and evil Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow) decides to evict all fairytale characters from their homes, the homeless begin squatting in Shrek's swamp, and Shrek is outraged. After making the acquaintance of a loudmouthed, infectiously funny, talking donkey (Eddie Murphy) who has muscled in on Shrek's swamp, an outraged Shrek pays Lord Farquaad a visit, demanding answers about the influx of the homeless in his swamp. What happens at their meeting results in Shrek agreeing to rescue a Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) from a dragon's den and bring her to the ambitious Lord Farquaad, so that he may make her his bride. In return for a successful rescue, Shrek will once again be allowed to reign supreme in his swamp.
The adventures that the donkey and Shrek have in their determination to fulfill their quest are fun filled and funny. Shrek, who speaks with a soft Scottish burr, is an ogre whose size and fearsome demeanor is belied by his tender heart. Mike Myers infuses this gentle, green giant with a tenderness that makes the viewer fall in love with Shrek. The donkey is brash as only Eddie Murphy can be, totally irreverent and outrageously funny. John Lithgow is wickedly droll, as the size conscious, power hungry, scheming Lord Farquaad. Cameron Diaz, who probably had the toughest role of all, is fine as the fiercely independent Princess Fiona. As Ms. Diaz does not, however, have a distinctive voice, her characterization pales alongside that of the other characters and is the weakest link in this otherwise sensational movie. The film has a surprise ending that is utterly charming and novel. It is an appropriate one for this unique and fiendishly clever film. Shrek is simply a great movie, animated or otherwise. Bravo!
This two disc DVD is loaded with eleven hours of bonus features that will provide fun for the whole family. It allows one to record one's voice over that of one's favorite characters' lines and star in one of twelve entire scenes. It also provides over fifteen interactive games.

Ok, you've seen it now? Good. Didn't you enjoy yourself? What was your favorite part? I don't know that I can actually pinpoint a favorite moment in the movie. I think the reason I like this movie so much (aside from the gorgeous animation) is how irreverently <i>fun</i> it is. This movie pokes fun at nearly every fairy tale held sacred by our society, and does so with unabashed glee.
Shrek (Mike Meyers) is a big, surly, anti-social, unfriendly ogre. Oh yeah, and he's green. Shrek would like nothing better than to live in peace in his swamp shack, but finds that his routine is shattered by an influx of displaced fairy tale characters, including Donkey (Eddie Murphy), a small, grey, outgoing, talkative, well... donkey. Shrek sets off to find the source of the sudden flood of fairy folk into his realm accompanied (much to his dismay) by Donkey.
As part of a bargain with Lord Farquaad of Duloc (John Lithgow), Shrek is tasked with rescuing Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) from the obligatory dragon. Unable to shake his donkey companion, Shrek heads off to fulfill his half of the bargain. All sorts of merriment ensues, and romance and surprises are at every turn.
The phrase ""for kids of all ages"" may be old and trite, but it describes this movie to a T. There's plenty of overt humor and pratfall silliness (not to mention bright, colorful animation) to fill any youth with glee, but the movie also has much to offer the adult viewer. Subtle (and not-so-subtle) references to other fairy tails, the aforementioned gorgeous animation, and humor abound.",1022371200,4,1638,4.77112676056338

and needlessly provocative; it would be a better film without.  But it's so much fun, so energetic, and the computer generated animation looks so good, that I suppose
it can be grudgingly forgiven a few excesses.
The filmmakers have taken William Steig's fairly minimal story and expanded it into a full blown fairy tale, complete with an evil lord, a dragon, and a plot
borrowed from Beauty and the Beast.  Then they've given the whole thing a post-Modern twist that Steig would surely approve of, with insider jabs at Disney,
Princess Fiona reenacting slo-mo kung fu scenes from Cameron Diaz's Charlie's Angels role, and various other humorous touches that give an adult overlay to a
film that kids enjoy at an entirely different level.
But for all the snarky humor, the Mike Myers and Eddie Murphy antics, and the impressive technology, the most delightful irony is that movie ends up working
because of the way it taps into classic themes.  Shrek, the ugly and much-feared ogre, goes and rescues the princess after Lord Farquaad promises to restore the
misanthropic privacy of his swampy home.  But over the course of their adventure the previously solitary ogre becomes friends with donkey and falls in love with
Fiona.  Together they learn timeless lessons about friendship, loyalty, love, and the true nature of beauty.  Those involved may think themselves hip and daring
heroes of counterculture for calling a donkey a ""jack..."" in a kids' film, but the joke's on them as they retreat into homey bourgeois homilies by film's end, which
Mr. Steig seem likely to have disapproved of.  I very much like the poetic justice of the filmmakers retreat.  But, of course, I'm a bourgeois and believe in those
homilies.

My 3 year old daughter went to see it with her father and when it came on DVD, she begged for it. I went against my better judgment and bought it. I ignored the first 3 minutes of it, missing the storybook, and so, missing the link between spell and princess. Then within the first 5 minutes, a fart and burp joke, I rolled my eyes. From then on, I ended up interested in it, enjoying it. I've been a fan of Disney movies for a long time, but this was so fresh and new. All the Disney-in-jokes were a trip. Everytime Donkey tried to sing, Shrek shut him up, and we all know how Disney loves to throw a song in when there is nothing else to say. I LOVE the Gingerbread Man scene, he should have had more screen time. And the voice actors were wonderful for their parts! There were some adult oriented jokes, but they went over the kids heads completely. I have yet to know a child that got the joke about Lord Farquaad's ""big castle"". And if they do get it, their parents should be shamed :P The whole story was just adorable. Beauty and the Beast, but just who is the Beast and who is Beauty?

How original! NOT!
 Shrek is so dull and lacking in wit, I literally tried to sleep but the stupid fart sounds kept me awake.
 The main character was so thrown together, it sounds like the creators realized too late he absoloutly stunk, so they had to keep him. Fiona plain rots. Nuff said.

 The animation is nothing spectacular, and never had me ""ooing or aahhing"" about any of it. But, then again, that could've been because I was rolling my eyes over the lousy dialogue and [dumb] one-liners.

However, Shrek is certainly not a traditional fairytale.
For a start, the hero is, by his own admission, a big, smelly, ugly ogre. Secondly, this is not only a movie for kids - much of the humour will only be fully appreciated by adults. And Shrek will have *everyone* smiling, giggling and laughing out loud. All of the characters have their funny and memorable quotes and scenes, but the best lines come from Donkey (although occasionally he seems to be trying just a little too hard for comic effect).
The computer animation is stunning and with a just a little imagination you can see that the characters somewhat resemble the actors who provide their voices. There is definitely a bit of Eddie Murphy in Donkey anyway. It is perhaps the attention to detail that is most impressive - the facial expressions are just fabulous.
Shrek is a must-see film, because almost everyone will find something to like about it (although perhaps not those who like their fairy tales to be predictable and perfect).

Although people have complained about the ""one-liner"" feel about the movie, Donkey never ceases to make me laugh, no matter how many times I've watched the movie. John Lithgow is terrific as well, perfectly devious as Lord Farquad. My one (very big) complaint is Cameron Diaz's performance as Princess Fiona - during the entire movie, she sounds like she's reading monotonous text, and at the same time trying a little too hard to be excited. Her interpretation of her character comes off like someone in a bad high school play, and the dialog could have been written better for her part.

This animation takes the time to dirty up it's characters a little bit, providing more realism, which I like.
The movie's also terrific in that it does work at both the adult and child levels.  The kids will like seeing some of their favorite fantasy characters in another context.  While they may have less than pleasant personalities in this movie, I don't think that's going to emotionally scar our nation's youth, and the adults can enjoy the many zingers that get thrown in.
But the familiar characters take a back seat to the brand new creations of this story.  Eddie Murphy as the donkey is great, if standard sidekick material.  But the animation of the Shrek character is more enjoyable with each viewing.  We've had slobs as heroes before, but never has such delightfully rude behavior been so incorporated into a lifestyle.  How Shrek brushes his teeth, catches fish for dinner, and provides a candle to light his dinner table are done so well they may become the new way of polite society.
Well, maybe just in the movies.  But I think the Shrek character has a lot of potential for a string of movies.  I anxiously await the next one.",1016582400,,1386,4.616326530612245
1312592,5,B00003CXXI,"This is one of the most innovative concepts to come out of Hollywood in some time.  It's a production that combines animation with subtle adult humor.  It parodies fairy tales, martial arts movies & makes fun of traditional constitutions of behavoir.  Somehow, it manages to not offend.  (Anyone who IS offended by this film needs to look up in the encyclopedia the following phrase:  lighten up).
The special effects and animation on this movie are absolutely stunning.  They certainly pulled out all the stops.  Visually speaking, this work is nothing short of spectacular.
The talent pool displayed is also very impressive.  Mike Myers is great as Shrek, Cameron Diaz is wonderful as the frustrated damsel-in-distress (with a twist!).  Eddie Murphy is a stupendous choice as the comic-relief donkey (although comic-relief in a movie like this is a bit of an outrageous term).
Here is a family friendly movie complete with some border-line raunchy humor.  But don't worry - most children will not be apt to pick up on the latter.

Hilariously funny and enjoyable movie with great music, great DVD features.
Review:
Great story with a solid script with good cohesion, flow and development; great acting voices (Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz, John Lithgow), great animation, design and implementation, great direction and great movie.  Great DVD features that are extensive and  generous!  And, a wonderful Filmakers' Commentary.
My kids loved the movie, got some of the good jokes, love the story, and enjoy playing the DVD Special Features including games, a Kareoki video and others.
Mike Meyers shows himself to be a gifted comedian with lots of wonderfully creative ideas and a moral to tell in the end.
Storyline
A charming ogre (Myers) is coerced into rescuing a feisty Princess Fiona (Diaz) with an overly talkative donkey (Murphy) in order to get his swamp back from the overcompensating (read that ""short"") Lord Farquaad (Lithgow).  Princess Fiona is obsessed with having ""loves first kiss"" with her ""true love"", and of course, cannot wait to be with her great Lord Farquaad whom she supposes is her true love.
Moral:
There may be much more to people than meets the eye!",1016323200,,1165,5.11578947368421
1312595,4,B00003CXXI,"If you think all fairytales should feature a tender-hearted, beautiful heroine and a handsome prince, both almost perfect and even their imperfections attractive to us (like Ariel's stubborness, for example) than this movie is not for you. Our hero is an ogre who shuns people and eats eyes. Our heroine is a princess who is well-trained in the martial arts and hasn't got any voice.
Many facts in this movie will offend the tender-hearted -- I'll admit that one scene was too much even for me, when Fiona's  singing kills a bluebird whose eggs she cooks afterwards ... ugh, that was TOO much. Also, it ridiculizes many other cartoons with its backwards humor, or movies like the Matrix. All these facts sum up to a little bit -- or more -- kitsch.
The ever present funny character - in this case the talkative donkey with Eddie Murphy's voice - is another cartoon cliche, but somehow it is not as annoying as others -- see Mushu in Mulan, also voiced by Eddie Murphy, now *that* was an annoying character.
Still, the movie IS funny and very, very enjoyable. And the basic meaning of the story, that is that you do not have to be physically perfect in order to find true love, is a very, very welcome change and very, very true. It warmed my heart.",1016064000,,1248,4.546666666666667
1312661,5,B00003CXXI,"Michael Eisner is the man who rules the Walt Disney Company. For many years, Jeffrey Katzenberg was his second-in-command. Katzenberg's most notable achievement was the revival of Disney's stagnant animated movie division. Under his guidance, the studio made commercially and artistically successful movies like The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast and The Lion King. Several years ago, the two executives had a falling out, and Katzenberg exited Disney. He soon co-founded Dreamworks Studio with Steven Spielburg and David Geffen. That enterprise has been highly successful. Katzenberg is openly out to unseat Disney as the undisputed king of animation. Dreamworks had moderate success with The Prince of Egypt and The Road to El Dorado. Antz and Chicken Run were hits. Now comes Shrek, which is the highest grossing movie of 2001 so far. Since Mr. K's departure, Disney has had its share of hits [Tarzan] and misses Pocahantas]. This all goes to prove that the American competitive spirit is alive and well in Hollywood. Not only has the consumer benefited, so has the industry as a whole.
Shrek is one of the merriest and most mischievous animated movies ever made. It operates on two levels. Kids will see it as one thing, parent and older viewers as another. All age groups will have a great time. You might call it a revisionist fairy tale, one that manages to be smart, funny and thoroughly modern without once drifting into cynicism.
Shrek [voice of Mike Myers] is an ogre, a big, tall, lumbering creature who has ears that look like trumpets. One day the short, pompous, egotistical Lord Farquaad [John Lithgow] decides to kick all the fairy tale creatures [Snow White, Pinocchio, the Three Little Pigs, etc.] out of his kingdom. They take refuge on Shrek's swampy property, and he gets really mad. He's been alone for so long that he takes his privacy very seriously. Accompanied by a loud, obnoxious, yet somehow lovable donkey [Eddie Murphy] he can't get rid of, Shrek goes to confront Farquaad. The lord tells him that if he will rescue Princess Fiona [Cameron Diaz], whom he has decided to marry, he will rescind his banishment of the fairy tale folks and give Shrek his privacy back. Off Shrek goes to a dragon-guarded castle to retrieve Fiona, who is no ordinary fairy tale princess. But, then, this is no ordinary movie.
The actors' voice talents are all quite good, but the one who is absolutely perfect is Eddie Murphy as the donkey. This animal could easily have gotten on our nerves, but Murphy makes him so funny that we are too busy laughing at him to get upset.
For the first time this year, there is an Oscar category for best animated movie. It will be a battle between Shrek and Disney's Monsters Inc. Here's to competition!",1015891200,,2755,4.863829787234042
1312662,1,B00003CXXI,"...of everything that's wrong with the film industry of America today.
In writing this review, the question I'd like to ask everyone who has given this film such a high rating is simply, WHY??  What is so special about this VASTLY overrated piece of garbage that's been hailed by so many critics and moviegoers alike as being unique, clever, a masterpiece, and so on?
Like so many other curious film buffs out there, I wasn't even interested in seeing ""Shrek"" when it came out in theaters, but after hearing so many great things about it from so many people, I finally decided to go ahead and give it a look when it came out on video.  Just for the record, I didn't spend any money on it, but some of my friends had rented it and I decided that I'd give it a try and find out what all the fuss was about.
And now, after having seen ""Shrek"", I still don't know what all the fuss was about!  What you have here, is an ogre that speaks with an annoying Scottish accent supplied by, the usually likeable, Mike Myers, an annoying donkey sidekick given voice by the even more annoying Eddie Murphy, a stuck-up airhead of a princess personified by the equally stuck-up airhead Cameron Diaz, and a whiny little wiener of a Lord voiced by the somewhat talented John Lithgow.
The PG rating awarded to ""Shrek"" is just as much of a joke as the movie itself is, with there being no small amount of farting/belching cracks and crude humor spread throughout the film, foul words a plenty, and enough not-so-subtle suggestive references to make even the most liberal of grandmothers blush.  ""Shrek"" even has the nerve to try and rob children of their imaginations and love for classic fairytales as the movie continuously portrays timeless and wonderful characters like Snow White and Cinderella (the two Princesses, at one point, get into an argument which leads to a fist fight!), among others, as being nothing more than sleezy, snobbish burdens on society!
And now, as is the current trend of major motion picture studios to crank out rather unremarkable run-of-the-mill sequels to their animated films (I'm sure it's only a matter of time before Di$ney releases ""Snow White and the EIGHT Dwarves""), I hear there's going to be a ""Shrek 2"", and I imagine all the same mindless, shallow, superficial critics and moviegoers who helped make the first such an undeserved success will do the same for its follow-up as well!
That's really just about all I have to say regarding the movie ""Shrek"".  I've already wasted more time on it in writing this review than it's worth.
Thank you.",1015891200,8,2565,4.665929203539823
1312663,5,B00003CXXI,Believe it or not but this is a movie everyone will love.  It's got some slight innuendos only adults might catch and funny moment kids will love.  I highly recommend this video in everyone's collection.,1015804800,,203,4.771428571428571
1312664,1,B00003CXXI,"A love story between a farting ogre and a belching princess, *Shrek* poses as an iconoclastic movie, gleefully destroying the romance and spirituality of classic fairy tales with a mixture of teenage irreverence, bad taste, rock'n roll music, anachronisms and trendy cynical humour. Apparently, noone realizes just how formulaic the whole movie is (cliche-bashing being just as predictable as the cliches it bashes), down to the buddy-movie stereotype of the taciturn hero developing a friendship with an annoyingly talkative sidekick. Even the short-legged king coveting the hero's love interest is borrowed from the French animated masterpiece, *Le Roi et l'Oiseau*- a much more subtle attempt to reinvent the fairy tale (even though Prevert was not that subtle himself.)
Now what explains the success of *Shrek*, apart from the massive advertising campaign and the current popularity of outrageously bad taste?
I think America has recognized itself in the main character. Shrek lives in a cabin in the wilderness, like the pioneers of old, and is mostly concerned with the defense of his property rights and the ousting of squatters from his land : the typical American mindset. His individualistic, don't-tread-on-me attitude leads him into conflict with a despotic King, symbolizing the Old-World order which Republican America has been so sucessful at overthrowing over the centuries. And in the pursuit of his own self-interest, Shrek uses his awesome physical power (soon seconded by that of a Dragon, probably symbolic of the atomic bomb) to become a kind of benevolent world policeman, vandalizing churches with the same glee as modern Americans' French Huguenot ancestors, echoing America's centuries-old hatred of Catholicism. Finally, Shrek's obesity and rough manners suggest a life of abundance where high culture and the life of the spirit have been sacrificed to the pursuit of more down-to-earth materialistic pleasures.
(If you are interested in this analysis of America's historical role, I highly recommend the short, five-volume history of the United States published by Angelus Press under the title *Puritans's Progress*. Interestingly, in volume 3 p102, the authors mention a late 19th century Uruguayan essay entitled *Ariel*, in which the author, Jose Enrique Rodo,  contrasted the spirituality and culture of Latin America, which he likened to Shakespeare's Ariel, with what he considered to be US materialism- Caliban . Shrek is just that : a cartoon Caliban, and the same symbolism applies.)
Another factor in the success of the movie, I think, is that it exploits the neuroses of modern Americans. It tells fat, ugly-looking people that they can actually get the girl. And it reassures girls who know exactly what they would look like without the plastic surgery, the make-up, the collagen, the silicon breasts, the intricate hairdo, the candlelight and the alcohol imbibed by their male prey. What the movie is saying is that we are all flawed individuals, and that we deserve to get the girl, because underneath, she is just as unappetizing as we are, and just as devoid of manners.
It is a pity that so much technology and animating talent should be forced to serve such ugliness : if you really want to see what beauty computer animation can achieve, rent *Final Fantasy* instead.",1015718400,13,3315,5.290322580645161
1312665,5,B00003CXXI,"A very charming funny portrayal -both a spoof of fairy tales and a fairy tale in itself.
There where some particularly memorable moments and this together with the great humour ,animation,acting and music is what makes it great  , and provides so much originality that the simple plot doesn't matter in the least.
All the characters where great -Shrek (Mike Myers) ,the Donkey (Eddy Murphy with his unmistakeable spunk) ,Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) and the evil Lord Farquarson but so was the portrayal of the minor characters , many of whom where famous tales from many Fairy Tales-including a Ginger Bread Man who had been cruelly maimed by Lord Farquarson and an incorrigible French-accented Robin Hood and his band of thieves.
I loved the subplot of the romance between the donkey and the girl-dragon ,especially the scene near the end where they play the Leonard Cohen classic 'Hallelujah ' flashing from a moping Shrek to the Princess to the Donkey visiting the love-sick dragon and putting their romance  into place.
I thought the dragon was a particularly delightful, character though she didn't actually talk.

The big bad Ogre is a good guy and the princess is under a spell with an unusual twist.  Her freedom, and transformation scene is clever.  The little folk do survive the ""dastardly deeds"" of the Prince,  and  manage to live happily ever after.  It's all wonderful fun.

1312668,5,B00003CXXI,"Shrek is the best kind of a comedy. From the opening credits to the last moment of screentime I was laughing my head off in fear I'd wet my pants. It rips on Disney big time, but that's one of its greatest treats. From the multible occurences of fairytale creatures (most of whom are convently from a Disney movie) to Lord Farccads (sp?) kingdom which bares a strange resembelence to Disney World, this movie understands the pleasure in a good ol fashion Mouse Bashing (and why not with the poorly made sequals Disney has been poping out with recently that insult their earlier masterpieces just to make some MORE money).
Some people may claim this movie is not approperate for children. People, there are only two ""pottie"" jokes in this feature, one in the opening credits that I missed the first time I watched it. There's really only one reference that I wouldn't let my cousions watch, the part upon seeing Lord what's his names castle and Shrek goes ""Do you think he's making up for something?"" (well actually they touch on that joke again when the Donkey goes ""and I think Shrek means he thinks Lord something has a really small-). That's why it's rated PG. Besides these jokes, everything else is perfectly fine for children who I'm sure have seen Disney movies and are perfectly capable of laughing at them.
I personally found Shrek lovable. He's this old grouch, but it's so refreshing to see a hero in a animated movie with a temper. As the Donkey says ""You've got that I don't care what nobody thinks of me thing, I like that. I respect that"". So do I. The Donkey had me in stiches. Many of his jokes would not be funny on paper, but are funny because Eddie Murphy is a comical genius. Ex: ""I like that boulder. That is a nice boulder"" The princess is sassy, and adds heart to this feature. The Lord guy has some great visual gags, although the gingerbread man really stole a lot of scenes from him.
I've heard some people bash this movie because they think the ""true"" theme is the opposite of what it seems to be. Namely, that the movie is REALLY saying fat, ugly people deserve to be with other fat, ugly people. Honestly, I think this is a case where people delve too deeply into a work of arts message. Shrek needed a plot twist. If Princess Fiana stayed a princess the second act would have had no conflict. Shrek do not concentrate on ""theme"", it doesn't take itself seriously as few comedies do. It concentrates on laughter, jokes and being a funny movie (which it is). My favorite scene? The look on Shrek's face after the ""It's a Small World"" number.

1312733,4,B00003CXXI,"To say this movie is a laugh a minute is almost an understatement. I have never been so intrigued by any animation to date.

The fact that characters from various fairy tales kept appearing was highly amusing to both my husband and I. We could not stop laughing! Finally, we found another movie we could both enjoy. We loved the three blind mice!

Basically, the fairy-tale characters are driven from their land/homes and they are sent to the swamp inhabited by Shrek the ogre. In his attempt to get Lord Farquaad to allow the characters to return to their homes, he finds a new purpose and mission. He is sent to rescue the fair Princess Fiona who is quite the character.

The fact that this animation also included a dragon and a princess in a castle tower was just so perfect. Everything was spectacular as far as the animation went and I was especially impressed with the castles and molten lava.

Without Eddie Murphy's voice, the donkey would not have been half as funny. Shrek also has a wonderful Scottish accent. The friendship between Shrek and the donkey kept reminding me of the movie: ""What about Bob?"" for some reason and was equally comical.

I didn't enjoy the Karaoke scenes, but those are after the movie. Most kids won't get the adult humor, but the crudeness here and there was definitely not necessary and was just too ""adolescent male"" for my ""over 30 female"" tastes.

Not for younger kids because of the adult humor in places. Pity, this could have been a really good family film and it brings out various aspects I thought could be great lessons for kids. Like accepting people for who they are, not for how they look, etc.

Romantic in places and ROFLOL funny. In a way, it is a reality check for everyone who likes to live in fantasy land.

1312781,4,B00003CXXI,"Shrek (Andrew Adamson and Vicky Jenson, 2001)

Shrek is the consummate fairytale, a sendup of hundreds of fairy tales that have come before while still being one  itself. It also has one of the finest endings in modern filmmaking, but by the time you get there, that's almost beside the point; you've had so much fun on the journey  that you hate to see it end.

Shrek (Mike Myers) is your typical fairytale ogre. He's big, green, and scares the natives. His fondest wish is to  be left alone in his swamp to live his life in peace. That wish, however, is tossed to the wind when Shrek first meets Donkey, who is, surprisingly enough, a talking donkey (Eddie  Murphy), and then later that day finds out that the evil Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow) is evicting fairy tale creatures, all of whom are taking up residence in Shrek's swamp.  Shrek heads off to see Lord Farquaad to work something out, and is given the following deal: rescue the fair Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) and you'll get your swamp back. Of  course, Farquaad has his own plans...

Nothing new here. Just combine the usual saving-the-princess-from-the-dragon fairytale with the frog-prince  fairytale (where your hero isn't Prince Charming) and you've got a good idea of what's going on. The ending, while somewhat surprising at first blush, is also pretty standard  fairytale fare. (That doesn't make it any less great. After all, we all knew how Before Night Falls was going to end, too.) What separates Shrek from the usual fairytale fare, and makes  it equally palatable to adults and kids, is that preternatural combination of adult-themed humor and kid-friendly animation that, while still too rarely seen, is starting to  become more common. Add the House of Pacific Data to the short list of folks who are capable of pulling it off, and eagerly await their next picture. Hopefully, it'll be this good.  ****",1012780800,,1882,4.840625
1312782,5,B00003CXXI,"There are several good reviews of the movie so I will not say anything other then it had me smiling from the first minute right to the end.
I want to talk a bit about the DVD. It's a two DVD set, the first is pan and scan, the second wide screen. I'm not interested in the pan and scan version myself but the disk is worth having for the extras included on the disc, and you may like it if you have a small TV or young kids. But the second disk rocks! Wide screen and DTS sound. The mix on the DTS track has greater dynamic range, more like the original theater sound track. Turn up the volume and you realy hear what ""home theater"" can do.
Lots of good extras too. Tech of Shrek was interesting and even funny. The directors commentary track on most DVDs puts me to sleep, but Shrek's didn't. The extras on a lot of DVDs are just filler, but the extras on Shrek really add to the enjoyment of the movie.
I've watched Shrek three times already, and I've never watched a movie three times in a week before.

This isn't your average kids movie, if you haven't seen this one yet, you haven't seen animation at its current best.  the humor is more for the adults than the kids, and the ingeniousnness of taking all of our favorite fairytales and twisting them, is just pure delight to watch over and over and over, i must admit to watching this at least 2x a week with my son (every Saturday is a must), it's just one of those movies that a healthy dose of Shrek will do ya just fine, just like watching the Simpsons episodes over and over.

I wish I had never seen it.  I almost believe that my blind faith in its ""horridness"" prior to my seeing it should have been left as it was.  After viewing the movie on DVD once (and not wanting the movie to ever touch the tray on my DVD player ever again), I wondered suddenly to myself, ""what was it about this movie that every critic (and person for that matter) found so compelling?""  I could personally not see past the numerous fart jokes and bathroom humour clouding up the picture.  The premise of the entire movie was sentenced to death past the 45 minute point, the uphill struggle had begun at that point.  The tiring Donkey character (a far cry from anything even remotely entertaining that Disney has ever done) really got on my nerves.  Along with that, Shrek, as horribly unlikeable as he is, had become such a moronic character at that point that I simply wanted snap the disc in half and never speak of it again.
In order to leave this review short, let me suggest that all who decide to watch or listen to this movie must please consider a blindfold and some earplugs.

The humor is sometimes subtle, sometimes obvious and very nearly continuous. Chances are good that just about anyone in the Western world will find something funny here. And maybe even beyond.
As if that weren't enough, however, the DVD is packed with extra features; sadly, many of these extras have limited replay value, although they are all laced with the same tongue-in-cheek attitude of the movie itself and are certainly worth going through at least once, if for nothing else but the info on how the movie was made and other details.
Also, unlike another movie, the outtakes are genuine technical goofs, rather than contrived screw-ups; many of them are funny in their own right, although some of them are just wierd.

I am a cartoom-movie fan so I especially liked it because it was unusual and funny, but still a nice fairy tale and very well drawn and animated. The animation is actually absolutely brilliant, it really looks more like a movie than a cartoon!
I think some kids can watch this movie and enjoy the fairy tale aspect, but on the other hand, I think that some kids around 7 and 8 won't get, as one reviewer objected, some of the jokes, which are actually not targeted for that age, but more for a late teen and adult audience. I would not say the jokes are downright dirty, some have a double meaning but they are not vulgar or offensive and I don't see the need to get offended.

1312951,4,B00003CXXI,"This excellent animated feature from Dreamworks is basically a swipe at rivals Disney.  It turns the fairytale story on its head, with the hero being a big, ugly but amicable ogre (Mike Myers).  With his sidekick Donkey (Eddie Murphy) he goes off to rescue Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) in order to reclaim his land back from Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow), which has been overrun by fairytale beasts.
'Shrek' is most fun when taking a stony-faced literal look at the fairytale world - i.e. the three blind mice carry canes, Snow White isn't easy despite living with seven men and there's also a wonderful gingerbread man that yells 'eat me' at his tormentors.  The distraction of toilet humour is, unfortunately, to be expected in such movies.  Also good is the acting, with Eddie Murphy having the time of his life.  In fact, 'Shrek' is worth watching for his performance alone.  The big name advertising for the movie does beg the question though, of where is animation headed?  The answer is, that the producers wanted to capitalise on its winning formula of good jokes and winning animation, where you can literally see each blade of grass rustling in the wind.  Most importantly, it's a movie that both adults and children will enjoy, which is always a treat amongst most of today's animated fare.
Even so, the light-rock soundtrack doesn't always fit and sometimes you're left feeling whether 'Shrek' is intentionally modern.  Plus there's the obvious comparisons to the 'Toy Story' movies, which could hardly be bettered by many movies, let alone another animated one.  Saying that, 'Shrek' really is excellent, a break from tradition and its slightly bitter asides will be loved by adults.",1011830400,,1696,4.9822695035460995

I'm upset because the movie uses dirty jokes to be funny and claims to be a kids' film. Sometimes dirty jokes can be funny, I know that, but when you're a little kid you don't know what they mean or why they're funny. After one punchline one of my brothers turned around as if to ask me what it meant. That made me sick.  It makes me sick how people make movies they say are for kids and then put dirty, even mean, material in them. Don't moviemakers know how sensitive and easily influenced kids are?

1312953,4,B00003CXXI,"Note to Disney: that noise you hear behind you is the footsteps of Dreamworks as they catch up to you...
In a very short time, the brains behind Dreamworks SKG has established the studio near or at the top of the animation industry. In a monumental leap since the above average ""Prince of Egypt,"" Dreamworks unleashed ""Shrek"" -- an action- and humor-filled fantasy/adventure whose hero is, well, a little unorthodox.
Shrek (Mike Myers) is an ogre who uses his hideousness to keep people out of ""his"" swamp. He unwillingly takes on a talking donkey (Eddie Murphy) as his sidekick as they journey to free a princess (Cameron Diaz) from a fire-breathing dragon. Along the way, they manage to have a lot of fun with the traditional nursery rhymes and bedtime stories that most of us heard when we were children.
Unfortunately, they also have a little too much fun with double-entendres and body noises, which makes this a film which parents should watch with their children (if they even allow their children to watch). Without a doubt, it is not the animation that Walt Disney would have imagined in the 1950s. Rather, it is a cleverly designed tale which engages the minds of adults while tickling the visual senses of the younger generations. (The Gingerbread Man/Muffin Man scene alone makes this movie worth watching).
In the realm of DVDs, ""Shrek"" also establishes itself as a cut above. The menus are incredibly interactive, and even entertaining. The several features about the making of ""Shrek"" are definitely worth watching, and the ""karaoke"" video (which appeared after the credits in the theatrical release) is available for viewing by itself. This is definitely worth adding to any DVD collection.",1011744000,,1706,4.989473684210527

Some people found Shrek to be descriminatory and prejudiced.  Personally, I didn't. However, the bottom line is IT JUST WAS NOT FUNNY. The humor, despite acclaim from adults and children alike, was repetitive, stale and un-intelligent. No person over the age of 10, would find this remotely funny.

Shrek (Mike Meyers, doing his terrific Scottish brogue) is upset because the evil Lord Farquaad has evicted a bunch of fairy tale characters, and these characters have taken over his home. Shrek, an ogre, wants to be alone, or so he says. So he sets out to see Farquaad (the brilliant John Lithgow) so that he can have his home back. He ends up being accompanied by Donkey, voiced by a hilarious Eddie Murphy.  Cameron Diaz plays the obligatory fairy tale princess. As you'd expect, Shrek ends up rescuing her from Farquaad. However, there's a twist in this aspect of the plot I don't want to reveal).
The voice work was just outstanding. I couldn't imagine anyone else playing these characters. The actors really invested time and effort into the roles, and they became their characters just as they would in a live action movie. I laughed at Donkey, fretted about the princess, and hissed every time I saw Farquaad, and cheered Shrek on. Can't ask for much more.
The animation is also spectacular. I was impressed by how distinct the facial expressions were. As well, the scenery was amazing.
The one thing I didn't like about Shrek was that it had a lot of gross out humor, particularly in the beginning. However, as the story evolved, I really got into the film.

It is that Gingerbread Man scene? Is it the fact that an ugly ogre is the savior of a hot chick? Actually, for me it's that wisecracking Donkey, who, done by Eddie Murphy, is hilarious for his comments. More important, he does his stunts to get a reaction out of Shrek, which creates tension between the characters (let's face it, it took a long time for Shrek to like Donkey). Perhaps it's the rendition of ""I'm a Believer."" Whatever, I say. If you watch Shrek, prepare to laugh. Hard. Painfully.

1313020,5,B00003CXXI,"I have to say that this must be the best movie ever. And like Shrek, the ogre, Shrek, the movie, is like an onion. It has layers!!!
There is the first layer of animation, which is superb. The characters, although cartoony, are very detailed, and the voices are superb. I didn't mind the cartoony part too much, because the main character, after all is a big green ogre, and how can you have a non cartoony green ogre??
Then there is the other layer of humor. The jokes are side splitting, and although some of them are a bit ""bathroom humor"" - it's not too bad. The jokes are done very tastefully, and they are definetly much more decent than the way kids talk nowdays. Older kids(7-15) and adults will love the humor. Younger kids may not get some of the humor. Eddie Murphy is excellent as the DOnkey, and I could watch the entire DVD just watching Donkey and nothing else. There are potshots at Disney characters, which can be quite entertaining
The next layer is the story, which is sort of a farce on the traditional fairytale, which would be expected to be predictable. It does have a slight twist at the end though
Next are the characters and the relationships between the characters. Shrek and Fiona, and even Donkey too some extent are quite deep. Both Shrek and Fiona have their wishes, hopes and desires. Both the characters have paradoxes within them. Shrek is a green ogre that everybody hates, and who is quite content living in the swamp alone. However, he wants to be loved, and deep inside he wants company. He has built up a facade of a big macho guy who lives alone, to keep people from hurting him. Fiona is a female who has pre-set notions of ""true love"", and has her life planned down to the last detail. However, life doesnt turn out the way she planned, when a big ugly ogre comes and saves her. Part of the story is how she comes to term with the circumstances, and in doing so, finds her true self. The characters could have been much to complex for a children's story, however the story has been played out sobeautifully that it's not too hard to understand them. The realtionship between Donkey and Shrek as best friends is really beautiful and so realistic
Next is the dialogue. The dialogue is full of humor, but it also at the same time manage to be quite deep. The conversation between Shrek and Onion on how Ogres are like onions is astonishingly simple and yet so descriptive of the character. The author must have given a lot of thought on how to represent the character in such a simple, clean, easy yet meaningful terms
Last is the music. There are song and dance sequneces in the movie, and there is a karoake scene as an extra that the kids will enjoy
So, I would say definetly buy this DVD, I know I am going to. Kids, and even some adults will love watching it again adn again and again",1011052800,3,2827,4.428023032629558

1313086,5,B00003CXXI,"First of all let me start by saying, I'm 32 years old and I don't like Disney or any other kids movies much (with the exception of The Iron Giant, although I also enjoyed Toy Story 2). I took my nephews to see Shrek at the theater last summer and they absolutely loved it but much to my surprise I loved it too.
This is the movie that has made $472 m at the box office and has made $420 m in two months of DVD and video sales. This is the gift that everybody got for Christmas. This is the gift I gave everybody for Christmas. This is the DVD I got for Christmas and this is the movie I've seen about six times so far BUT it doesn't matter how many times you watch Shrek, it still amuses, it still entertains and it doesn't ever disappoint. It has that rare quality of appealing to both children and adults, which is extremely beneficial if you have kids who liked to watch movies over and over and over again.
It is a beautifully written send up of Disney films, fairytales, and other movies, with so many clever visual and verbal jokes; only some of which (thankfully) kids will understand. All of which adults (with a sense of humour) will love. It is a perfectly cast movie with Mike Myers voicing the mild-mannered ogre Shrek and Eddie Murphy in his best form for many a year as his sidekick donkey. John Lithgow stars as the villain Lord Farquaad and Cameron Diaz voices the feisty Princess Fiona. They are all magnificent but it was a stroke of genius to cast Myers and Murphy together as they spark off each other and excel with comic ad-libs.
Whats more the extras on this DVD are just magnificent. There are games, deleted scenes, behind the scenes stuff, hilarious fake interviews etc. etc. and with reported sales of the DVD worldwide, at 10m and rising, Dreamworks have put together a fantastic package and really hit the jackpot. I don't know anybody, young or old who doesn't like this movie and for once I'm pretty happy to be in the majority.",1010448000,3,1959,4.384615384615385

Watching it in the movie theatre I found that I just couldn't stop laughing. As always Eddie Murphy is genius(great cast). We got the DVD for Christmas and I can't stop watching it. I especially love the karaoke music video at the end. Plus the DVD has great special features including the revoice studio on DVD-rom. 2 thumbs up!",1010361600,,467,4.306818181818182
1313090,4,B00003CXXI,"I must admit, I am a Disney-a-holic, so when a computer animated film made by Dreamworks was getting high acclaim, I avoided it.  I didn't see it in the movies, but once released on DVD, I got a bit curious and was suprised at what I found.
  As this movie is aimed at a wide audience, I found enough to engross many children and enough to also engage an older crowd.  At first I was extremely skeptical of the cast, as I don't usually like Mike Meyers at all, but his voice was disguised enough that I didn't mind.  Also, Cameron Diaz usually annoys me, but her voice and character were well cast.
  Shrek became a loveable creature and even though the plot is not complicated and somewhat predictable, it was definately enjoyable.  There were many stabs at Disney, but I didn't get too offended.
  All-in-all, Shrek was a well done movie with creative dialogue, beautiful scenes and an entertaining plot.  I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys computer animated movies.",1010361600,,977,4.622093023255814

Then Shrek rips the page out of the fairy-tale book and uses it to wipe himself in the outhouse (yes, we are spared the details).  Between the killer commentary from Eddie Murphy and Mike Meyers, kids and adults will be kept riveted to the screen.  In many ways, this movie was enjoyable the way Aladin was -- Robin Williams jokes were funny to kids on one level but enjoyable for adults on another.
Highly recommend.  Just be careful about singing to the birds...",1010275200,,570,4.6138613861386135

Could the movie ever be more funny? I think that this is most hilarious, facinating movie on earth.  Donkey is anoying i admit, but he is very funny.  Shrek the great green fright machine might be a little mean to donkey sometimes, but he's also funny.  Princess Fiona, I would say isn't much of a joker, she's more quiet, I would say, but if ever she wants something badly she screams REAL LOUD. Lord Farquaad probably the person that you will hate the most in this movie, is dum.
The graphics on this movie are great, the movie is even 3D.  The sound comes out clear, the charaters are very well made, and well everything is perfect!!!!If you want a good laugh buy this movie.  It's worth it I swear.",1010275200,,861,4.417721518987341

I did like most of the characters and their voices, Shrek was one of the best. The computer animation was fantastic, much better than Final Fantasy, I thought you could almost think the characters were people in rubber suits. I think that I read the animators gave the people a little less than realistic movement in order to preserve the cartoon aspect, that seemed evident at times.

1313158,2,B00003CXXI,"Shrek (Mike Myers) is a big, green ogre who lives alone in a swamp and wants to keep it that way.  His beloved swamp is soon overrun with fairy-tale folk who have been evicted from Lord Farquaad's (John Lithgow) kingdom and must now settle in the swamp.  Also invading his privacy is a smart-mouthed donkey (Eddie Murphy) who is determined to make a friend of the ogre.  In order to rid  his swamp of the fairy-tale creatures, Shrek pays a visit to Lord Farquaad, a diminutive, nasty man who has schemed to get the deed to Shrek's swamp.....and succeeded.  Farquaad agrees to give the deed back to Shrek if the ogre will rescue the fair princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) from the tower of a dilapidated castle so the lord can marry her.  The castle is protected by a fire breathing dragon but Shrek and Donkey outwit the dragon and rescue the princess.  On the journey back to Farquaad's kingdom, Shrek and Fiona fall in love but Fiona is set on marrying Farquaad thinking that ""love's first kiss"" will dispel a curse that she has fallen under.  But true love wins out in the end.  Pretty predictable ending.
I was very disappointed when I saw this movie for the first time.  It fell way short of all the hype!  This is not appropriate for very young children as they will not be able to follow the storyline and the movie does have adult humor.  Older children will probably enjoy the ""potty"" humor but I really don't think this movie should be viewed by anyone under 15/16.  Call me a prude if you want, but I don't think a movie aimed at children should have any adult humor in it and I'm not necessarily talking about the potty humor.  The only things I liked about this DVD were the computer animation, which was wonderful, and the bonus features on the 2-disc set, which were fun.  But I will admit that my 28-year old son thought the movie was hilarious.  He said it was the best computer animated movie he had ever seen and he has watched it again and again.",1010188800,5,1962,4.43854748603352
1313159,4,B00003CXXI,"SHREK is a computer-animated fairy tale.  It is a computer-animated fairy tale with comedian voiceovers.  It is a computer-animated fairy tale with comedian voiceovers, and not a Disney production.  It is a computer-animated fairy tale with comedian voiceovers, not a Disney production, and is proud of it.  In fact, it is a Dreamworks Production, the company started by what's his name---you know---ah yes---Steven Spielberg.  The movie is based on the book by William Steig.  SHREK is directed by Andrew Adamson and Vicky Jenson.
SHREK is unlike Disney in the sense that this story is a fractured fairy tale, while Disney has a more serious tone to its pictures; nevertheless, SHREK is supposed to be fractured.  The viewer can assume that the tale will be fractured due to its two leading fractured comedians, Mike Myers and Eddie Murphy.  It is interesting to note that all through the movie, Dreamworks takes potshots at its rival Disney with cutting remarks and jokes, as well as fairytales in general.
The story line reveals SHREK living peacefully in the woods and content to stay that way until a band of outcast characters ---many of which are Disney---invade his swamp.  When SHREK discovers that the characters were evicted from the kingdom by the evil Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow), he makes haste to the castle for a conference with the king.
In the meantime, Farquaad has been frantically searching for a wife, but not any wife.  He must have a princess, someone of royalty; therefore, he consults the Magic Mirror from Snow White who gives him a choice of three available princesses.  In this humorous scene, Farquaad settles on Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz), a beautiful young lass, living high in a castle tower guarded by a fire-breathing dragon; therefore, it becomes  SHREK's mission to rescue her and return her to Farquaad.  Assisted by his crazy sidekick, Donkey (Eddie Murphy), the story takes on some interesting twists and turns, infused with sharp wit and humor.
THE GOOD...  This is a funny movie, full of one-liners aimed specifically at the adult audience.  There are flatulent faux pas for the male segment, especially for teenage boys, who love this sort of thing.  However, SHREK (Mike Myers) appeared to give up his seat in the humor section to Donkey (Eddie Murphy), who was rambunctiously funny, but nothing close to Robin Williams' performance as the Genie in Disney's ALADDIN.
The animation is similar to that of ANTZ, a very good computer-generated work of art, in which DREAMWORKS specializes.  This makes it a very entertaining film for all.  As for a moral to the story, there is one, and it gives meaning and substance to this fractured fairytale; however, this must not be divulged by the reviewer.
THE BAD...  One really needs to pay close attention to the humor, some is inappropriate for young kids, but with all the animated action, children will more than likely not be attuned to it.",1010102400,,2933,4.973360655737705

I spend half the time selecting the wrong thing, can't get out of the menu, and the ""trivia"" has to be read. There's no real ""extras"" on this DVD.

If you thought Antz was funnier and more hard-hitting than ""A Bug's Life"", then you are likely to appreciate this more than Disney's computer-animated product like the Toy Story series.
Before I had seen Shrek, I was rather put off it by the publicity artwork, which made it look cartoonish and basic. In fact, nothing on the billboards prepares you for the vibrancy and sharp grown-up humour of this film. And have you ever before seen a cartoon in which the heroine had (in the most tasteful possible way) a genuine female sexuality?

1313163,5,B00003CXXI,"This is one of the more entertaining films I have seen in a long time. Although a kids film, Shrek is a bit like Bugs Bunny cartoons in that it has been designed to be have a number of levels of humour which attract all age groups.
The reason why it is so good is the plot density. Each scene is carefully built up not only to keep up a narrative flow but to develop a multitude of jokes and parodies. At any point there will be a number of ongoing jokes which mean that your attention is continually engaged and you are never bored.
It is difficult to speculate but probably with a film using real actors the writers don't have to be as continually inventive. An audience can engage in either an adventure or a romance with real actors with reasonably limited dialogue. With an animation you probably need a lot of dialogue or action to distract an audience's attention away from the fact that the cast are animated figures.
Anyway this is a classic film. All of the actors who do the voice overs, Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy and Carmen Diaz are brilliant. The plot is inovative altough it has some parrallels with Wagner's ring cycle.",1010102400,,1133,4.425837320574162

1313225,3,B00003CXXI,"SHREK obviously has received a lot of praise from movie critics and audiences world-wide. Well, I decided to rent this DVD to see what all the fuss was about since I didn't go and see it in theaters. I have to say that as hilarious as it is, SHREK was not the best film I've ever seen. I have to say that I enjoyed exploring all the special features more than the movie itself! The DVD is quite excellent and a good treat to all fans of DVDs. The computer animation of the film is pretty well-done, too (though I tend not to like computer animation and prefer the regular cartoon drawing animation). And the voice performances are one of the best parts of the film!
SHREK stars Mike Myers as the voice of Shrek--a giant, friendly ogre, Eddie Murphy as the voice of Donkey--Shrek's sidekick who is obviously a donkey, Cameron Diaz as the voice of Princess Fiona--who's not like any normal princess and does not act like a princess, and John Lithgow as the voice of Lord Farquaad--the evil lord who has proved all fairy tales politically incorrect. SHREK basically spoofs all Disney animated movies, but it does it in a way which young children can enjoy and not in a gross way like what SCARY MOVIE did to teen horror movies.
But the movie is not the best part--the special features on this DVD is the best part! On this DVD, you can go behind-the-scenes to the world of Shrek. You can play games, read fake biographies and listen to fake interviews with the main characters, and a lot more. If you loved the movie SHREK, than this DVD is highly recommended. But if you just love good DVDs and need more good DVDs for your collection, then buy this DVD for the special features! It is a good DVD and good movie.",1009843200,,1710,4.4145569620253164

But if you take away all of the ground breaking animation, what you have is an average movie.  Mike Myers voices Shrek and does a great job but from the first scenes we know Shrek in an Ogre who only appears mean to hide the low self esteem he harbors.  Nothing new here.
Eddie Murphy voices the donkey, the trusty side kick to Shrek who always has a wise crack to make but is truly Shreks friend when it counts.
Then there is Princess Fiona.  She is your typical princess in a fairy tale, waiting to be rescued by her Prince Charming.
Shrek could never decide what kind of movie it wanted to be.  Parts of it are satire on Disney films, parts are satire on fairy tales, and parts are blatant morality tales.  If the creators had settled on one path, they would have had a better movie...
Maybe I'm so down on this movie because others love it so much.  This is a good movie, just not the best movie that was ever made.  Of course I'm an adult.  Kids will love it.",1009756800,,1217,4.252173913043478

1313336,5,B00003CXXI,"So much has already been written about this movie (and the DVD) it's hard to come up with more superlatives for this review, but I enjoyed ""Shrek"" so much I have to take a stab at it.  To start, the story is excellent; it's cute without being juvenile, and moves with great pace.  The plot has been rehashed repeatedly here so suffice it to say that ""Shrek"" is a ""fractured fairytale"" in the tradition of the old cartoons by the same name.  Everything is completely familiar, and yet somehow completely out of whack.  The movie is also loaded with inside jokes, innuendo and oblique references that make it as much fun for adults as children.  It reminds me of Disney's ""Aladdin"" in its ability to contain a high level of sophistication while still being enjoyable as a ""children's"" movie.
The animation is also gorgeous; the elaborate and fantastic nature of the story set a high bar for the animators, and they cleared it easily.  Water, faces, fur, all are animated beautifully, but not in an overly precise fashion.  By that I mean that while this movie is undeniably a technological triumph, it doesn't where technology on its sleeve.  The difference between technology and art is heart, and the animators clearly recognized this fact.  The settings and characters all have a sense of whimsy and innocence absent from other CGI (Star Wars for example).
It is the voice talent that really makes the movie, however.  Mike Meyer's provides the voice for the gruff, but lovable Shrek, Cameron Diaz's spirit shines through as the princess, and Eddie Murphy is brilliant as the Donkey.  In fact, I would say that his performance, while overshadowed by Meyers' is the best in the movie.  The supporting cast is likewise outstanding, particularly John Lithgow as Lord Farquart.
As for the DVD, it is loaded with extras.  My personal favorites were the ""actor"" interviews, in which Shrek (for example), the CGI character not Mike Meyers, is interviewed about his role in the film, and the animation bloopers reel which highlights some of the bizarre animations resulting from programming errors.  The DVD is also very kid friendly, featuring a variety of games and a sing-a-long.
In the end, ""Shrek"" is rightly being touted as one of the best movies of 2001.  It is sophisticated enough for an adult to enjoy, while at the same time a parent can let their kids watch it without worrying.  The voice talent and animation are both superb, and the story is entertaining and has great messages about inner beauty and the importance of friendship.

But after weeks of hearing how this was ""the thing"" to watch, I was disappointed in the weak overall plot layout: we have no background about the area or kingdom in which the characters live, we have little explanation for the fairy-tale character roundup, and why is the prince obsessed with marriage if he is already royalty?",1009411200,,406,4.898550724637682

The music makes them (and us) want to crank up the surround sound system and get up and dance, and we all laugh hysterically throughout it...especially at Donkey's antics, Shrek's comments and tolerance of Donkey, and Fiona's singing.  While amusing and colorful to watch, it also supports the underlying message that beauty is in the eye of the beholder and that everyone has feelings to consider.  I definitely recommend this to anyone that wants to see, or even hear, a fun movie, or who wants to find themselves laughing repeatedly.

1313433,5,B00003CXXI,"SHREK is one of the best movies of 2001. Granted it's a CGI film. However, before the holiday season, there weren't many movies to arrive in theatres in 2001 that were so entertaining for both children and adults.  Like The Simpsons, The Muppets, Veggie Tales, and the TOY STORY films, SHREK contains a lot of obvious humor that kids seem to enjoy (especially the fart jokes), but also tons of jokes that most children won't get, but that adults will chuckle at. The basic plot of the movie is this. Shrek is an ogre who lives alone in his swamp and is quite happy there until one day he saves a talking donkey from a group of guards. Donkey befriends Shrek and before the ogre knows it, his swamp becomes a safehaven to all sorts of fairy tale creatures who have been displaced from their homes by the Napoleon-complexed Lord Farquaad. Shrek and Donkey set forth to meet Farquaad and end up going on a quest to save the beautiful Princess Fiona (who happens to have a beauty secret).SHREK is a modern-day fairy tale told using computer animation. It doesn't deconstruct fairy tales as some have suggested. However, it does rip on Disney big time. That specific satirical cartooning is one of SHREK's biggest treats. And even if you don't pick up on or enjoy the Mouse House bashing, there are plenty of flatulence references to make you laugh.",1008979200,2,1344,4.623430962343096

1313509,5,B00003CXXI,"This movie presents a funny and silly tale of an ogre (Mike Myers), a donkey (Eddie Murphy) and a princess (Cameron Diaz). Shrek is your average mean, grumpy ogre who lives in a swamp who just wants to be left alone. He then runs across Donkey, who is an amazingly annoying talking donkey who keeps you rolling on the floor laughing with his jokes. And then the two go off on a quest (complicated reasons why) to rescue the lovely Princess Fiona, who somehow isn't very wooed when she realizes her rescuer is nothing but a rather ugly ogre (sorry Shrek) and his noble steed is but a donkey. But the Princess and Shrek become great friends, and it becomes harder and harder for Fiona to keep her deep dark secret a secret much longer...
This movie is absloluetly hilarious! For all ages, really. There are jokes that only adults (and teens) would understand, and some rather nasty hidden tibits within the dialog.

We put this DVD on when a few 'rugrats' were visiting and their eyes were glued to the set watching the show. When we asked them if they liked the movie we got a resounding 'NO' but, their eyen never left the set and when they were leaving they all wanted to stay and asked their parent to came back so that they could watch more great movies.
My kids are pretty well grown now and I remember that we used to take them to the movies regularily. Unfortunately some of them were so sweet that I think they should be banned for 'cruelty' to the parents that have to endure them and avoid from falling asleep. I certainly will never forget jumping at least 4 feet out of my seat when one of the mean bears in the 'Care Bear' movie jumped out of the bushes and growled so loud that most grandparents got heart palpitations.

When you see the dressed up guard running through the snaked lines when he sees Shrek, be sure to catch the ""Wait from this point: 45 minutes"" sign.

1313515,5,B00003CXXI,"I am a longtime fan of Pixar, but found ""Antz"" from Dreamworks to be hard to look at and tedious to sit through.  As a result, I stayed away from Shrek in the theaters.  I finally bought the DVD -- mostly for my daughter -- and was surprised to find a great animated film.  ""Witty"" and ""warm"" are two cliches that deserved to be trotted out here; ""Shrek"" is clever without pretension, sharp without being mean, and warm without being sappy.  Like Disney's ""Emporer's New Groove"", ""Shrek"" abandons the sentimental mush and goes for a smart retake on the traditional, Disney-esque school.

""Shrek"" outdoes ""Groove"", though, in its astonishing computer animation.  Toys and bugs have been the subject of CGI animation because, until recently, the systems could not reliable handle skin and other organic materials.  No longer.  ""Shrek"" sets the bar very high for the computer generated film; the animation here is on par with the work being done by Lucasfilm for the new ""Star Wars"" movies.  Shrek the Ogre, however, is much more likable than Jar-Jar Binks.  Seriously, from fields of waving grass to balls of dragonfire -- not to mention the winning characters -- the animation of ""Shrek ""is nothing less than amazing.
Finally, ""Shrek"" would be cold and lackluster without the human voices that inform the characters.  Michael Myers voices the ogre with a heart of gold using his familiar Scottish accent.  However, it is turned way down from the caricature levels used in ""So I Married An Axe Murderer"" and ""Austin Powers 2.""  Eddie Murphy plays Donkey, a sidekick voiced in a suspicously similar fashion to his dragon Mu-Shu in ""Mulan.""  That quibble aside, I should say that Donkey is the most perfect marriage of voice and character design I've ever seen in an animated film.  Carmen Diaz does a lot with what might have been a little as Princess Fiona, and John Lithgow is suitably honey-voiced as the despicable Lord Farquad.
If you aren't interested in the quality of the animation or the dynamics of the voice performances, you'll probably be won over by the satire.  Farquad's kingdom Duloc is, in a bit of inspired lunacy, envisioned as a wicked satire of Disneyland, from the huge parking lots (YOU ARE PARKED IN LANCELOT, reads a sign) to a hilarious parody of the Disneyland staple, 'It's A Small World.'  Dreamwork's co-founded Jeffrey Katzenberg must have loved it.
The DVD is a winner, coming on two disks stuffed with bonus features -- commentaries, deleted scenes, storyboard pitches, making-of documentaries and, maybe best of all, a precious two minutes of ""Shrek's Karaoke Music Swamp.""

But showing this to children is a bad idea for two reasons:
  -vulgarity.  Eddie Murphy's character uses words we don't use in our house.  If I hear my children's friends using these words, we tell their parents about it.

Look at Snow white's innocense and the simplicity of its animation.  Take Pinocchio and the water scenes that you believe because they're not too real.  Dreamworks tries too hard to make things look real and limits your imagination.

It's become acceptable to associate negative traits with certain dialects.  For instance an ""appalachian"" or deep southern accent with ignorance and baseness.

1313664,3,B00003CXXI,"Let's face it:  Shrek is overrated. Don't get me wrong, the animation is spectacular, it's very funny at times and I enjoyed it enough to get the DVD. It does a fairly good job of skewering fairytales, but does so in a mean-spirited way. I suppose that that very irreverance is supposed to be shockingly funny, but for a movie that inspires to be a fairytale itself, it's the wrong way to go (for an example of how to do this correctly, see ""The Princess Bride.""). Despite being a ""cartoon,"" this movie is not for children (do parents bother to check ratings anymore?) since its humor relies heavily on bodily functions, innuendo and mild profanities. The opening sequence pretty much sets the tone for the rest of the movie, as it should, in case you have any doubts.
Now on to the DVD content itself. As with most of their releases, Dreamworks has done a good job of loading the DVD with extra content, but I have to question the validity of the content. Disc 1 contains the full-screen presentation of the film and a featurette, but mostly it's full of a heap of DVD-ROM content. That's great if your computer has a DVD-ROM drive and uses Windows, but for everyone else it's an extra disc that won't receive much use. I understand that some of the DVD-ROM stuff is great, particularly the voice-dubbing studio, but I personally wouldn't know since I use a Mac.
While Disc 1 appears to be aimed at the new wave of DVD consumer (those who don't like letterboxing because they feel like they're not getting full use of their TV screen, among other things), Disc 2 is targeted toward the original DVD consumer (those who love the ""film school on a disc"" premise and will watch nothing but letterboxed movies). It contains a running commentary by the filmmakers that, while occasionally offering insightful information into the laborous animation process, is too often like listening to the geeks at the corner lunchroom table laughing and revelling in their very geekiness (I can say that because I sat at that table). The remaining content concentrates on the ""tech of Shrek,"" like storyboard pitches, computer glitches, character design, etc. This is nice, but left me unsatisfied since the presentation is somewhat half-baked.
If PDI/Dreamworks was going to try to copy the content of Pixar's ""Toy Story Ultimate Toy Box,"" they should have gone all the way. They should have released a basic DVD with perhaps full- and widescreen versions on the same disc, along with DVD-ROM content. Then they should have released a special, 2-disc set with as much technical stuff as they could cram on there. By releasing it the way they have, the content has been compromised. You might be attracted to this set by the box's promise of a cartoon for the kiddies loaded with special features (2-discs! 11 hours of content!), but the moral of the story is to not judge based on outer appearances; it's what's on the inside that counts.",1008115200,,2923,4.742632612966601
1313715,5,B00003CXXI,"I really mean it.  Every time I watch Shrek I find something that I missed before and I enjoy the movie more.  My 21 month old has picked Shrekn as her new favorite so I feel confident after 6 viewings in 4 days I can speak on this.
This is a movie that pokes fun at Disney, has the fairy tale ending and shows that inner beauty is all that matters.
I must say that the animation is wonderful; the computerized characters look real, not the cartoony way that cartoons (duh!) can look.  The picture quality is awesome, clear and sharp.
The extras on this DVD make this movie all the more enjoyable, for those who just gotta see how the animators did it there are goofs, a making of spot andthe best of all, the dance party.

The overall result is that of a very well polished cartoon depicting a fairy tale story world with a modern twist. This movie is irreverent and a little savage, which, again goes down well both with children and adults. There are a lot of nods to other movies, including the ""that'll do"" phrase out of ""Babe"". Myself a counted half a dozen such instances and probably they are twice as many - this works nicely. To its merit the movie does not take itself very seriously.
Unfortunately its makers do; the special features are filled with expressions such as ""the first"", ""the most"", ""revolutionary not evolutionary"", ""the only one with believable human characters"" and such. In fact Shrek is evolutionary only, if you want to have a revolutionary visual experience, see ""Final Fantasy"", a contemporary photo realistic computer generated movie. ""Shrek"" for all its merits, does not quite achieve what ""Final Fantasy"" and ""A Bug's Life"" did: to create a new world.

1313780,4,B00003CXXI,"Looking for a family film in the best sense of the word? ""SHREK"", the most successful film of the year (so far pre ""Harry Potter"" and ""Lord of the Rings"") brings to life a surrealistic, three dimensional world inhabited by all manner of extreme but believable characters with their own, very human, problems and agendas. Mike Meyers inspired voice work for the title ogre is dead on and implies much more humanity than the mere words he says.  Eddie Murphy is consistently in the zone as the up-beat, bluntly honest (...) Donkey (is that redundant?). Cameron Diaz and John Lithgow bring the princess and the vertically challenged,  king to life. But the most interesting thing that looms over this film about self acceptance is the personal war between Disney's Michael Eisner and DreamWorks' ""Shrek"" producer Jeffrey Katzenberg. The rivalry and bitterness between the two former Disney associates has resulted in several extraordinary animated products that are probably much better than they might have been. Let's hope they keep competing on a personal level because ""Shrek"" is just about perfect.
Except for one thing. And that's the politically correct ending. It would've made anotgher hudnred million if the two ogres in love were transformed into perfect and beautiful and forever young beings.

1313783,5,B00003CXXI,"When I saw the first part of the show,my eyes sticked to the screen as it was very enthralling. I especially liked the talking donkey which could flatter people as he makes me laugh.
 This show is about an ogre who despises anyone to come and live with him as he likes his own privacy. The talking donkey wants to stay with him as the king banishes any fairytale creatures in his kingdom. The King Faaquad sends all these creatures to the ogre's place. To get his swamp back,he has to save Princess Fiona from the dragon and marry her to King Faaquad so that he can have his swamp back. Shrek,the ogre willingly went to rescue the princess with the talking,annoying donkey. I especially like the part when the dragon was chasing the donkey. The donkey had no where to run so he had to use his mouth to flatter the dragon. The dragon was so touched by what the donkey said until the dragon fell in love with the donkey. That was the best part in the show.
 On the journey back to King Faaquard's kingdom,Shrek and Princess Fiona had fallen in love with each other. But when Shrek misunderstood something that Fiona said,he gave up hope to marry her.

""Shrek"" strarted out really funny. There were many fantasy characters being locked away such as snow white and the twelve dwarfs, fairies, etc. The donkey (eddie m.) tries to get away and runs into Shrek.  The humans try and catch the donkey, but Shrek is right there and they are scared and run away. The donkey and Shrek eventually become friends ( even after Shrek repeated many times to the donkey that he wasn't looking for any friends). The King of the land orders that Shrek's land will be taken away and the only way for Shrek to save it is to go on an adventure to save a princess (cameron d.)

This has to be one of the funniest and best made films of all time,  a future classic.",1007596800,,459,4.337209302325581
1313873,1,B00003CXXI,"I am a big fan of CG-films, and I admire the leaps that each new one makes over the previous ones, but this film just didn't cut it for me.  I know I may be going over some people's heads here, but the walk cycles on some of the characters were just annoyingly dull.  I expected creativity to be dripping from this film, oozing out of the celluloid, but it just felt uninspired.
The plot was pretty much warmed over fairy tale with an anti-Disney stripe (which apparently appeals to many people, but not this reviewer) and the animation really didn't blow my mind the way I expected it to.  The fart and ""pee-pee poo-poo"" jokes got old VERY quickly, and when you strip away all that, all you're left with some fairly impressive voice talent.  The problem is, the actors really didn't get to do much.  Cameron Diaz pretty much reprised her ""Something About Mary"" performance, Eddie Murphy brought out his ""Mushu"" characterization from ""Mulan,"" John Lithgow played a short Dick Solomon from ""Third Rock from the Sun"" and Mike Myers phoned in with an extended ""Fat Bastard"" schtick from Austin Powers 2.  What's more, I swear all four of these actors' voices were tinkered with in the computer, and the sound just didn't quite work.
I know this is a lot of nitpicking, but I walked out of this movie feeling COMPLETELY underwhelmed and wanting my $8 back.  If shoddy craftsmanship, lack of a decent storyline, an overabundance of fart jokes, and a half-hearted attempt at computer animation don't bother you, by all means, watch this movie.  If you're holding out for something better, go watch Toy Story 2 or Monsters Inc. or something that reflects the effort and craftsmanship that went into it.",1007596800,14,1695,4.702702702702703

I was surprised that the Ogre, Shrek, liked any one at all.  In the beginning, he didn't seem to like himself or his talk-all- the-time donkey friend much less all the characters from every other fairy tail relocated to his swamp. Well, once a loner always a loner.
John Lithgow played his character well.  What a shame his character only chose a wife because she was a beautiful princess by day and all the others were spoken for except her. It's a shame someone with a small stature couldn't see past the bridge of his upturned nose.  Didn't he have the nerve to jilt this princess just because she wasn't what he thought she was?  He only wanted her to stay in power. Love?? Ha!
Granted, some of the scenes in this movie had me laughing so hard it made me sore, but that didn't happen too often.  That's why I recommend renting this movie before deciding to buy it.  There is definitely no comparison of ""Shrek"" to other Disney movies like ""Aladdin"" and ""Beauty and the Beast"".",1007510400,,1178,4.425925925925926

There was actually a coherent, engaging, and comedic tale to go along with them. And what I like best is that it pleases everyone! The characters are easy to get to know, the plot is simple enough for kids to understand, but not so childish that parents won't enjoy watching it too, with many a play on words that the younger set will understand one way, and that the adults will understand another-really quite funny. There's even a moral or two at the end for the littluns.
This is a great family movie. With three sarcastic characters, a laughable antagonist, and a hilarious plot with a twist you won't see coming, Shrek has got the goods to please anyone between the ages of seven to seventy! Enjoy!",1007424000,,819,4.578231292517007

A little shocking really, from all the other 'kids' videos out there.  Obviously they tried to appeal more to adults.  The down side to the video - there is a lot of  'toilette' humor and innuendos that are inappropriate for most children.  Little songs that seemingly are about to end rhyming in words that most parents wouldn't allow their kids to say and at the last moment changing the words.  The princess singing a duet with a bird (cute), but them the bird explodes and she cooks her eggs.

1313974,4,B00003CXXI,"""Shrek"" is the ultimate fractured fairy tale, a film that manages to simultaneously honor and lampoon the conventions of its genre without becoming smug or condescending in the process.  For while it is sardonic, ""Shrek"" is never cynical, so confident and assured are its makers in establishing and maintaining just the right tone for a revisionist exercise such as this one.  The film certainly conveys a modern sensibility, yet it is a gentle sort of iconoclasm that allows us to enjoy the more conventional aspects of the story (the happily-ever-after ending, for example) even as we are laughing at the obvious absurdities contained within them.
The revisionism begins with Shrek himself, as unromantic a figure as has ever earned the title of ""hero"" in a fairy tale adventure.  For Shrek is an ogre, plain and simple, an ugly, cranky, decidedly standoffish beast who wants nothing more than to rid his swamp of all the classic fairy tale figures (Pinocchio, the Three Little Pigs, The Three Bears, The Three Blind Mice et al), who have been consigned there by the dastardly Lord Farquaad, who is attempting to purge his land of all those bothersome folkloric personalities.  To earn the deed to his land and thereby have authority to evict the squatters, Shrek agrees to go in search of the beautiful Princess Fiona, rescue her from her dragon-guarded castle, and bring her back for Lord Farquaad to marry (thereby earning the latter the legitimate title of Prince of the Land).  Of course, every valiant hero needs his own wisecracking sidekick to accompany him on his journey and Shrek finds his in Donkey, a companion whose sardonic humor serves as both a thorn in the side and as a source of moral inspiration for the unlikely, often socially backward hero.
It is hard to overestimate the seemingly boundless originality, ingenuity and creativity that have gone into the making of ""Shrek.""  Here is a film that can truly be enjoyed by viewers of all ages.  Children will revel in the glorious animation and the assorted lowbrow comic antics of Shrek, Donkey and even Princess Fiona, while more seasoned adults will delight in the sly in-jokes, bawdy innuendoes and clever anachronisms that pour forth in amazing abundance from the mouths of the characters.  There is never a dull moment, since the writers, William Steig and Ted Elliott, and the directors, Andrew Adamson and Vicky Jenson, always seem to have new and clever tricks up their sleeves.  Donkey, in particular, is the most amusing and endearing sidekick since the Robin Williams genie in ""Aladdin.""
The script pokes marvelous fun not only at the whole fairy tale mentality, but also at the romanticized conventions of medieval life.  There are jousting knights, damsels in distress and an Inquisition-like rounding up of all those caught demonstrating any proclivity for the supernatural and the magical.  So much seems to be happening throughout the course of the film that a second viewing is surely in order, just so one can catch all those delicious details that might have slipped by on the first go-round.  (The gingerbread man interrogation scene is particularly hilarious).
Despite its tone of sardonic playfulness, ""Shrek"" is, happily, not afraid to indulge in a bit of heartwarming sentimentality at times.  The romantic feelings that develop between the Princess and the Ogre are genuine and heartfelt, made palatable by all the flippancy going on around them.  In fact, Princess Fiona is very much a modern heroine, shrewd, matter-of-fact and able to roughhouse with the best of the boys this strange land has to offer.
Special note must be made of the superb voice work, which is largely responsible for bringing these extraordinarily well-delineated animated characters to life on the screen.  Mike Myers (Shrek), Cameron Diaz (Princess Fiona), John Lithgow (Lord Farquaad) and, especially, the brilliant Eddie Murphy (Donkey) all turn in bell ringer performances.
In every area of the filmmaking process, ""Shrek"" excels like no general audience film since ""Toy Story 2.""  Like that earlier work, ""Shrek"" provides audiences of all ages and all types with the joy that comes from seeing a superb idea superbly executed.  ""Shrek"" is an intelligent, witty and imaginative family film.  Be sure to catch it.  Films like this don't come along very often.",1007251200,2,4335,5.080281690140845
1313975,4,B00003CXXI,"It's been a while since I watched this movie at the cinemas, and I absolutely loved it then.  Coming back to it, this isn't so good.  Sure it's brilliant, but there are far better animated films out there, most of them including the words 'Toy' and 'Story'.  Of course, by choosing to use computer animation, Dreamworks' fantastic film will always fall short of the 'Toy Story' movies that it can't hope to compete with.
However, let me go onto why this film is good!  First of all, the voices are well chosen, with Eddie Murphy being completely hilarious in all of his scenes.  There's also Mike Myers with a Scottish accent and the excellent Camerion Diaz, who just defies to be pigeon-holed.  On top of that there is superb animation, with the viewer being able to see every individual hair on the animals etc.  Of course, that's all very out-dated now that 'Final Fantasy' has been released.  The most important thing about this film though is the fact that it's very funny.  There's toilet humour for the kids and jokes for the adults, who will lap up the Gingerbread Man who screams 'Eat me' at his torturers.  It's even quite touching at the end, yet however much you might admire the ending, you can't help but wish that Cameron Diaz's character had remained pretty.  For instance, why did she have to morph for her and Shrek to be in love?  Probably because it would have been too disturbing for a children's film, but still...
Now onto the bad points.  The funny send-up of the Disney films is actually quite bitter, with the guy that made 'Shrek' having parted company from the Disney studios.  After all, there's nothing wrong with good old-fashioned fairytale.  This is a decidedly modern piece, and this is perhaps why it doesn't quite have the magic of films such as 'Beauty and the Beast' and it's nowhere near as sophisticated as the 'Toy Story' films.
However, definitely one to watch, for adults and children.  And in appealing to both age groups it has certainly achieved something.",1007251200,,2002,4.693409742120344
1313976,1,B00003CXXI,"To start, he animation is good, and there are a few good visual jokes.
But the plot is so thin, so contrived that it would not have filled out an episode of Power Rangers.
Shrek is an ogre who only wants to be left alone.  Lord Farquaad rounds up all the Fairy Tale Creatures in the land, and relocates them to Shrek's swamp, less than a mile away.  Why?  Apparently for absolutely no reason other than there is no movie if he doesn't.  Farquaad says he will relocate them again (to where?) if Shrek will retreve the Princess he needs to marry to become a King.  Only complication is that the Princess is under a curse (which seems to take the night off while Shrek and Donkey are talking by the light of the moon).
(Adult) inunendo and toilet humor make this unsuitable for small children.  Lack of characterization, plot or internal consistancy make it unsuitable for anyone else.",1007251200,4,882,4.515723270440252

This movie starts out... pretty much poking fun at your classic fairy tale creatures. With Mike Meyers (austin powers), Eddie Murphy (Dr. Dolittle), Cameron Diaz (Charlie's Angels) and John Lithgow (3rd Rock from the Sun) paired in this movie it is a must see! The comedy is priceless.
Shrek, an ogre with a big heart, and a faithful side-kick (who he is trying to ditch) they set out to save Shrek's swamp/home by rescueing a princess.
It is a great film for both kid's and adults, with enough humor to keep both laughing through the film.

1313981,5,B00003CXXI,"The vocalizations really make this movie.  Being a rabid Mike Myers fan I think he did an awesome job with Shrek, but Eddie Murphy really stole the show with Donkey.  Especially his spiel about Parfaits.  You can see the actors characteristics coming out in the animation also, especially Cameron Diaz as Princess Fiona.
Shrek must leave his swamp and rescue Princess Fiona from her imprisonment in a Dragon guarded castle, and take her to Lord Farquaad so that he can have his swamp back again.  He winds out with Donkey as his companion on his quest, and to sum it up, it is laugh after laugh.
Just lighten up and don't expect great art, and remember that The English Patient in all it's painful and anesthetizing duration actually won awards for boring audiences to death.  Shrek is a hilarious movie never intended to send an important message, it just silly and fun.  The Karaoke tune at the very end is a riot!!
Besides, a good fart joke is fun, because farts are funny.  My favorite line?  ""Was that you Shrek?  Man!  You gotta warn me before you just crack one off like that!  My mouth was open and everything!""",1007078400,,1119,4.57286432160804

1314032,5,B00003CXXI,"Shrek (voiced by Mike Myers) is not your typical hero.  He is a big, clumsy ogre that uses his looks to strike fear in the hearts of others and keep everyone away from him.  Everyone, that is, except a talking donkey (voiced by Eddie Murphy) who does not know when to keep his mouth shut.  The evil Lord Farquaad (voiced by John Lithgow) has captured all of the traditional fairy tale creatures and banished them to Shrek's swamp.  Desperate to have his home back, Shrek meets with the Farquaad and strikes a deal with him.  Farquaad needs to marry a princess if he wants to become a king.  If Shrek will rescue a princess being kept by a deadly fire-breathing dragon(voiced by Cameron Diaz,) Farquaad will remove the characters from his land.  Along the way is adventure, friendship, and hilarious Disney references.
As every fairy tale has its ""moral of the story,"" we learn that just because you are different doesn't mean that you are any less of a person than anyone else.  That no matter how alone you feel, there is someone else in this world that feels that way, too.  And that beauty truly is in the eye of the beholder.

1314039,5,B00003CXXI,"This has got to be one of my favorite animated movies, up qith Antz, Beauty & the Best and Mulan.  I look for movies with strong female characters, or at least strong individuals.  Shrek contains both.
Shrek is an unlikely hero, an antisocial [troll|ogre] who lives in a swamp away from people.  He doesn't have any friends, but soon his lonely swamp becomes home to dozens of fairytale creatures that have been pushed out of the rest of the world.  Similarly, he is pushed into helping them out, along with the help of a donkey sidekick.  He ends up saving a beautiful princess in a tower.
Sounds pretty typical right?  Well, the princess isn't exactly typical.  She likes his sense of humor and seems to be pretty laidback herself - nothing like they'd expect from a princess.  He ends up following in love with her, and vice versa.
I don't want to spoil the movie for you, so I won't give you the whole plot.  Let's just say things don't end up how you expect.  I left the theater with a big smile on my face - the movie ended even better than I could have expected.",1006905600,,1069,4.380710659898477

1314129,5,B00003CXXI,"I'm a great fan of light fiction, particularly clever fiction, so when our gang collected at a friend's house for Thanksgiving dinner, and we settled in for the usual low key after dinner recovery period in front of  the TV set, I voted for the Shrek film on DVD.  Although I hadn't gone to see it  in the theaters because it was a ""kids"" film, I had ""broken down"" and purchased the DVD on the recommendation of a friend's daughter (Grace, aged 8 years), and loved it.  So did the friends with whom I watched it at Thanksgiving.
As with any successful comedy, whether cartoon or human driven, the story has various layers to it, appealing  in different ways to different age groups.  For those of us who have grown up on works like Monty Python, Saturday Night Live and other irreverent fare, the punch in the eye to standard fairytales is enjoyable.  (Early on  Shrek tears out the ""and she was awakened by true loves' first  kiss"" page out of his book in disgust and uses it as toilet tissue!)  Younger children will probably love the cute little donkey character, young girls the Zena like princess, young boys the mud bath of the ogre, etc.
As usual, Eddie Murphy does a superlative job as the ""annoying, miniature beast of burden.""  As with his little dragon character, Moushu in the Disney film Mulan, he is both dear and slightly idiotic at the same time.  He has all the genius for delivery that Robin Williams exhibited in Aladden, but brings with it his own style, a  more direct and more connected sense, that one finds in all of his work.  His was by far my favorite character.  I hope he does lots of other voice over parts like this in the future; he's truly gifted.
Mike Meyers is the real surprise, at least to me.  I've only seen bits and pieces of Austin Powers in trailers and was not impressed.  When I was told that it was he who played the central character Shrek, I have to admit I was impressed.  Maybe CGI characters are his forte!
One of the facits of the work I liked best was the clear message--lost entirely, I might point out,  in the Disney version of Beauty and the Beast of which Shrek might be considered a modern day version--that happily ever after, love, and happiness do not come packaged in a pretty or handsome face.  Although the Disney movie pointed out that, as the old adage has it, ""handsome is as handsome does,"" it botched the works by changing the beast into a handsome prince as his reward for being a person worthy of love.  Any school dance wall-flower knows for a fact that this never happens.  Shrek makes it clear that, while a person may not be what the rest of the world considers attractive, they are beautiful as long as the one they love sees them as so.  In fact, the movie makes several points important for adults as well as children to learn.
The visual effects of the film were impressive.  The hair, facial affect, and movement of the characters was very real.  The movements and habits of the little donkey kept reminding me of my great danes Courageous and Tempo.  Expressions on faces created a sense of person and mental and emotional content that most cartoon characters lack or can only approximate by physically ""aping"" human behaviors.  The humans were not quite as real as some of the central individuals  in Final Fantasy, for instance, but the fact that they had to interact with totally make believe characters in a believable manner, made this less an inadequacy and more a means of promoting the story.  In fact, the facial affect of those in Shrek were far superior to Final Fantasy despite their overall less ""real"" appearence.  Probably the most impressive innovations in the film were in environmental design.  Many of the effects were very realistic, even more so than the much awaited monument to CGI, Final Fantasy.
The double DVD edition, in addition to providing the wide screen and the pan and scan versions of the film,  has several special features.  My favorite was the ""out takes,"" that is the computer bloopers that produced bizarre results.
This is definitely a wonderful addition to a family library of videos or DVDs and would make a lovely holiday gift for almost any age group.",1006819200,,4176,4.592442645074224

1314134,5,B00003CXXI,"SHREK is a hilarious comedy that will win over audiences of children and adults alike. Shrek is a fearsome green ogre living in isolation in his own cozy little swamp. He is not receptive to visitors, and fends off the occasional party of torch-wielding villagers with ease. But when the power-hungry Lord Farquaad turns Shrek's swamp into a relocation camp for dozens of banished fairy-tale characters Shrek's peace and solitude is disrupted especially by the talkative Donkey. Shrek makes his way to Farquaad's realm of Duloc, where the Lord promises makes Shrek and offer: He will rid Shrek's land of the unwanted visitors if Shrek will go on a simple quest to free Princess Fiona from her remote, dragon-guarded castle and convince her to marry Farquaad. On their quest, Shrek and Donkey run into a number of bizarre situations, and Shrek finds himself realizing that he isn't quite the fearsome monster he has always made himself out to be.
The Donkey's least likely love the Dragon keeps you smiling. The Princess with her dark secret keeps you crossing your fingers that all will go well. Shrek himself mellowing to the warmth of love. Interesting for the romantic at heart and kids still into fairy tales.",1006732800,2,1213,4.921951219512195
1314135,4,B00003CXXI,"I imagine few people exited the theater disappointed after watching Shrek.  It is, quite simply, an all around good film that excels in every single category.  Visually, it is, of course, stunning.  I find that even though it concerns a world of fairy tale creatures, I am more apt to believe in their existence than I am the humans of a competing CG film, Final Fantasy.  The environments of Final Fantasy might have undeniably modeled real-life, but it lacked natural realism of living expression, something that Shrek exceeds at even in the most blatantly fictional species.  Shrek himself is more convincing and more likely to jump from the screen than anything offered to us from Final Fantasy.
If humor is the object, than Shrek no doubt appeals to all demographics, catering to the young, the old, and everything in between for a hilarious romp that never stops.  The story is simple and inspiring enough to be successful, though admittedly predictable.  One criticism I must proclaim is that the whole film seems somewhat rushed.  Obviously, manipulating computer characters is a time-consuming process, but it shouldn't feel like the filmmakers were rushing to the end throughout the entire film.  Sometimes the audience needs a few seconds to pause and become in tune with everything that is happening on screen. Moreover, the film seems to hark back to ""road trip"" comedies, but fails to sustain this aspect long enough to completely assume a definite momentum in that path, leaving the viewer somewhat bewildered as to how to classify this film.  Unfortunately, the final sprint to the conclusion comes at the audience with such breakneck speed that one is left with the vague sensation of feeling unfulfilled; but all of this is nitpicking at best, since the film works well beyond even the most trivial of faults.
And behind it all is some phenomenal acting; an especial kudos to John Lithgow and Eddie Murphy, the latter of which seems to be directly superimposed over his character in all manner of attitude, expression, and gestures--half of Donkey's entertainment value seems to be derived by the letter perfect animation of his movements.  What remains is a near flawless film that cannot fail to entertain, to amuse, to rouse every person willing to make the journey.  Great acting and great animation couple with an amusing story that collects into one of the greatest animated films of all time, certainly one of the best, and certainly one of the most unusual in film history.  Shrek is well worth your attention!",1006732800,,2536,4.981042654028436
1314213,4,B00003CXXI,"I would give the movie 4-1/2 stars, because while I enjoyed the barbs and send-ups and concept, I'm not into gross-out humor.  Normally I round up when I'm between stars, but there is one very disturbing problem with this DVD edition --  the thirteen games and Revoice Studio don't work on Macs or DVD players -- majorly lame! -- so I rounded down instead.
The extras that *are* accessible to all of us are very good: an HBO feature about the making of the movie; interviews with the cast and filmmakers; funny fake character interviews; filmmakers' commentary; a trailer; the progression of characters as they were developed; and some very interesting (and sometimes creepy) digital goofs that result in missing body parts, etc.  You can watch the film with English, Spanish or French audio and subtitles.
This is a great example of what can be done with the DVD format, and if you don't mind toilet (and booger and fart and burp) humor, it is essential.  (If you do mind toilet humor, try the even more spectacularly belled and whistled Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs DVD.)

At a glance, Shrek seems like a cruel old ogre, but once you get to know him, you realize that he's just an angry, insecure creature who is just looking for love. He finds just that when the lovely Princess Fiona comes into his life. The two of them have many ups and downs, but in the end, their love for each other and their understanding of one another's pasts brings them together for life.

There is SO much in this movie that it's hard to even know where to begin. The voices are fantastic. The animation is fantastic. The plot is great! There are certain scenes in there, the gingerbread man on especially, that get me laughing even after many, many viewings.

Shrek just wants peace and quiet, but soon finds his swamp overrun by a bunch of nasty disney characters (surprised they didn't get into a huge lawsuit considering all the Disney vs. Dreamworks flak).  In order to clear out his homeland from these uninvited guests, Shrek sets off on what soon becomes an epic adventure rescuing a damsel in distress from a terrible (but also lonely) fire-breathing dragon.  In the process he learns a lot about himself, friendship, and love.  With quotes like ""Snow White?  She lives with seven men, but she's not easy"", the bathroom humor and mild sexual innuendos will keep the kids giggling, but there's not enough to restrict their viewing.

Mike Myers is fantastic as Shrek who is a green troll who everyone thinks is a savage beast, when in fact he is just a lonely guy who longs for someone to love himm, for who he is and not what he is.

1314369,4,B00003CXXI,"While the movie is as good as it's gonna get and the quality of the audio and video on the DVD are excellent, it's fair to say that the extras are not worth it.
As for the film, Shrek is a funny, smart and wicked look at fairy tales, with the ocassional pun on Disney. The quality of the CGI is extraordinary, showing great detail and improved character movement -- check out the grass, the trees, the pouring of milk, the beer mud and the hair on the donkey, all truly amazing.
The voice talent is also quite good, with an outstanding performance by Eddie Murphy.
The extras on this DVD are what are a real disappointment (at least for me). Differently from other studios, Dreamworks decided to include both the full-screen and the widescreen versions (one on each disc), instead of releasing two different versions - this takes up a lot of memory so two discs are needed. Then, the technical goofs are not entertaining, or informative, or even amusing (except maybe for the 'chia donkey' thingee), the character interviews are boring, the international dubbing feature is a waste of time, the Xbox playing hints are of no use as is the storyboard pitch of deleted scenes.
Not all extras are bad, mind you, as there's a lot of stuff in there for the kiddies, and Shrek's re-voice studio is fun (but you have to have DVD-ROM, though). Also, Shrek's music hall is amusing, but wears off pretty quick. Finally, the documentary 'The tech of Shrek' is probably the best extra for the grownups or for people interested in the process of making such a film (check out the screen they had made up as a forest hut, with trees, rocks and whatnot, cool!).
All in all, Shrek is a very entertaining, technically amazing, funny movie, but just a good DVD -- buy it for the film!",1006387200,,1765,4.553459119496855

For the kids you have the amazing animation and fairy tail characters.  For adults there is a wonderful story, fantastic characters, and of course those wonderful allusions (made famous in the Simpsons and Toy Story 1+2) that just go right over kids heads but will have you rolling with laughter.
Then animation and attention to detail in this film are nothing short of breathtaking.  There are many times you will forget you are watching a computer-animated movie.  The characters are all brilliant but the Gingerbread Man and Eddie Murphy as the talking Donkey absolutely steal every scene they are in.  If you loved the Toy Stories, or you are breathing, or you even have an ounce of a sense of humor then this movie is absolutely a must have.
The DVD version comes with 2 Disks.  Disk one is a Standard TV width.  Disk 2 is the real treasure for those with HDTV and surround sound system as it sports anamorphic widescreen (put your TV on full mode and if fills the entire screen without any sort of distortion) and a wonderful DTS soundtrack in addition to the Dolby 5.1.  There is also the usual assortment of DVD goodies spread over both disks.  One of the more interesting goodies is a Magic Mirror version of The Magic 8 ball.  Should you buy this DVD?

Soon, he discovers that there is a bounty out on all fairy tale creature and are being located to a namely location [Shrek's swamp]. During this Shrek encounters excellent characters all perfectly voiced with a donkey being voiced by Eddie Murphy, Princess Fiona voiced by Cameron Diaz and the Evil Lord Farquaad who is superbly voiced by John Lithgow. There were very few points in this movie that I could not even remotely describe as low. The movie is hilarious as it pokes fun at Disney a lot and was found to be pretty funny. The movie overall does deserves five stars as it lives up to the hype [lack of better word] originally put into it and was ultimately very enjoyable to watch.

1314462,5,B00003CXXI,"Set in a strange, colorful land populated by fairy tale characters, SHREK is a hilarious comedy that will win over audiences of children and adults alike. Shrek (voiced by Mike Myers) is a fearsome green ogre living in isolation in his own cozy little swamp. He is not receptive to visitors, and fends off the occasional party of torch-wielding villagers with ease. But when the power-hungry Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow) turns Shrek's swamp into a relocation camp for dozens of banished fairy-tale characters (including some pesky dwarves, wolves, and fairies) Shrek's quiet, introverted life is ruined. Joined by the talkative Donkey (Eddie Murphy), Shrek makes his way to Farquaad's realm of Duloc, where the Lord promises makes Shrek and offer: He will rid Shrek's land of the unwanted visitors if Shrek will go on a simple quest to free Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) from her remote, dragon-guarded castle and convince her to marry Farquaad. On their quest, Shrek and Donkey run into a number of bizarre situations, and Shrek finds himself realizing that he isn't quite the fearsome monster he has always made himself out to be. Reinventing the traditional fairy tale adventure, SHREK features gorgeous computer animation, a unique sense of humor, and compelling characters--especially Eddie Murphy's lovable Donkey.
This movie is worth the DVD alone.  The problem only lies in the DVD itself.  Some may find the extras to be lacking.  This is a double disc DVD, so you would expect the 1st disc to have the movie and a few extras and the 2nd disc to have alot of extras, not the case here.  The 1st disc has a widescreen presentation and 2nd has a full screen, but the real problem is they both have the same extras but in differnt places.  I let down nontheless.  Still the documuntry is worth it, but the Karokee Dance Party were the cast sings varouis songs is great.  The donkey singing Sir Mix Alot's ""I like Big Butts"" is the funniest thing on the DVD.",1006214400,3,1963,4.841791044776119
1314463,1,B00003CXXI,"It is a pity that the minimum number of stars I can give is 1, because I don't think this Shrek movie deserves any. It is an insult to all the genuine 1-star movies out there.
Is it a sign of the times that a woeful excuse for entertainment such as this travesty is so popular? Where is the discernment in today's movie-going public? There are fantastic animated movies (Toy Story 1 & 2, A Bug's Life) and there are fantastic children's movies (A Princess Bride) and then there is this.
Shallow humour that relies almost solely on flatulence, the most confused moral/message EVER seen in a movie, a plot that is so predictable as to induce a coma in an insomniac, and an inane script all add up to one of the worst movies ever made.
If you laughed at this movie, if you overlooked the messages (fat girls are hideous and unloveable, slender girls are beautiful, lovely, sweet and normal, short guys are evil and deserve death because of it, hairy guys are ugly, short hairy guys are fair game for bullying) just because ""it's funny"", then you need to take a good long hard look at yourself and your values.
If you agreed with what you thought the message was (beauty comes from within, or something like that), then how do you reconcile the conflicting messages from the rest of the movie? It is a sign that the creative team behind this movie had no idea how to tell a story, they just wanted a few cheap laughs and a showcase for their animation skills.
Save your money. Read a book. Take a class in drawing and learn how to look at people. You'll see the beauty in people, even if they are 'round', or 'short', or even 'hairy'.",1006128000,14,1630,4.400662251655629

Dreamworks threw all the effort away with this DVD, the extras suck big time, they are not even funny. The characters interviews are a waste of Memory and processors time. And why they repeat some of the same features in both DVD's?
The set is full of games that are somewhat worth the price of what you are paying, but if you are not into learning how to draw Shrek's face, and singing along with the characters, the games are just a waste of space.

While the film offers animation that puts everything from Pixar to shame, the thing that shines through the most in this production is the cast, most notably Eddie Murphy as Donkey. Mike Myers was hilarious as Shrek, but the accent couldn't make me stop picturing his Fat ... character from ""Austin Powers II"".
The DVD presents a fine presentation of the film, better then it was in theatres. While it is one of the top 3 DVDs of the year, there is some room for improvement. When it was announced that 'Shrek' would contain 11 hours of extra's, I wanted to label it right away the best DVD of 2001. I'm glad I didn't. The behind the scenes doc, audio commentary, and a few other extras (including great menus) do give big points to the Discs, but the rest of the 11 hours seem to be games, or other extra that do not provide insight to the movie and where just placed there to take up remaining room.

""Shrek"" is an absolute must-see for children that will give them a good upstanding idea how this world should really be about people may they be ugly or gorgeous all people should be treated and loved the same.
Definitely should be a contender for Oscar as best picture.  A fun, predictable love story with a twist of an ending.  All I can say is when I saw the movie in the theater I am just glad Shrek fell in love with the lady for ALL the right reasons.",1005782400,,747,4.054421768707483

""Shrek"" is a Joe Frazier left hook, for sure - this DVD has the works: great plot, fine animation, excellent music (the number that ends the film is simply terrific), and loads of extra features.  Productions such as this one are tailor-made for the Digital Theater System sound and the widescreen format - no doubt about it.
Now to see what Disney's response is with ""Monsters, Inc.""...they have their work cut out for them in trying to equal ""Shrek"".  I just feel bad about not going to see this film when it was in theatrical release...",1005782400,,639,4.6371681415929205

(Apparently some kids like the movie too)  Sit back and enjoy a masterful comedy.  It's a great laugh and relaxing escape for the whole family.",1005782400,4,452,4.439024390243903
1314715,2,B00003CXXI,"Prior to viewing ""Shrek"", I was intrigued by the animation I had seen in the previews and I had liked the idea it had of parodying fairy tales. I loved ""The Princess Bride"" and how it mocked the standard fairy tale in a way that both crucified the genre and honored it. It made fun of the frivolousness of the tales, but still also offered an experience that rivaled even the best traditional fairy tales. It was also a ""family"" movie and it managed at times to capture the grandeur of a fairy tale through the emotional attachment. A good story has to at least hit us on an emotional level. The score itself was moving enough to be worthy of a serious dramatic tale. ""The Princess Bride"" was a much better paced piece of work and did not attempt to simply crack jokes every few seconds as ""Shrek"" did. The major flaw of ""Shrek"" was that it tried to be too funny too often and managed little effective humor at all. The audience is numbed by the lack of emotion to counter all the frenzied dippy humor that no child could ever understand anyhow.
As well as the jokes being way too adult oriented than children could possibly understand, I was absolutely apalled by the music used in Shrek. I could understand pop music being used in Disney movies like ""Beauty and the Beast"" because those Disney movies always wound up being musicals anyway. At least in the case of those Disney movies the music had something to do with the movie. I cringed right off the bat when Smashmouth's ""Allstar"" started playing early in the movie. I thought,""Why use that in a movie about an ogre?"" It had nothing to do with what was happening on the screen.
So watch ""Shrek"" once renting it and laugh at some of the adult oriented humor.(Some of it is funny) Quickly forget about what you saw because it sure wasn't anything memorable. The actual story of ""Shrek"" is weak to say the least. So ""Shrek"" winds up a mix of humor for adults with a (...) story for kids that moves at a pace of a Concorde jet. The sales are huge. I wonder why.(Sarcasm intended)",1005782400,,2032,4.421333333333333

It has wit, humor, heart, intergrity, morales, lessons, positive messages, etc.  'Shrek' is a very unique comedy as it is enjoyable to both young and old.

'Shrek' mocks Disney movies, The Matrix, Riverdance, and more!  The mocking isn't malicious, just cute and *hilarious*!
Cameron Diaz, Mike Myers, and Eddie Murphy are amazing!  Their voices really bring their special characters alive.  The animation is fantastic!

Well, when she is supposed to be ""beautiful"" she has a body that doesn't happen to mortals without extensive plastic surgery (typical tiny waist massive breasts).  Then when she turns ""ugly"" she gets a nice, ripe and ATTRACTIVE figure that mirrors most of America and the donkey cruelly shrieks, ""YOU ATE PRINCESS FIONA"".

1314718,5,B00003CXXI,"To me as a teen I have to say that from my personal experiences Shrek is definetly for all ages! This movie just lifts your spirits with its dry humor. William Steig did a delightful job at depicting a fairy-tale world that we have known for ages...but somehow this movie of the fairy tale world seemed different and definetly more fun. It wasn't just the same boring old thing!!
Now on to the movie. Our main-character a big green ferocoius looking ogre named Shrek(Voiced by Mike Meyers) lives in solitude from the rest of the world. Kinda like a hermit in our world. All he wishes is to be left alone in his swamp because unfortunately the world doesn't exactly appreciate ugly ogres. So to his immense disliking fairy-tale creatures captured by Lord Farquaa have flocked his whole swamp. Accompanied by a self-centered annoying talking donkey(Voiced by Eddie Murphy) he sets out to find Lord Farquaa and get back his rights to the swamp. However, he ends up getting the job of rescuing Princess Fiona (a fair maiden Farquaad wants as his bride) from a castle guarded by a ferocious dragon.
With a serious of fast-paced events Shrek and his pal donkey manage to save Princess Fiona, unfortunately not before the dragon fell in love with the talking donkey.(I found that totally hilirous!!
As Shrek leads Princess Fiona back toward Farquaad's castle, adventure begin, which does introduce a blossoming romance of sorts! This story was filled with great humor such as when the very short Lord Farquaa tears off the Gingerbread Man's legs which resulted in a bunch of laughter from the audience.

All the vocal talents are spot on. And the bonuses on the DVD are also worthwhile- I particularly liked the interviews with the cast members. I personally look forward to Fiona and Snow White remaking ""Thelma & Louise"".

The worst part is easy: the toilet humor.  The film could easily have been bumped up a star or two without it.
I find it odd that some parents can wring their hands over the word ""damn"", but have no compunctions at all about their kids being exposed to the continual (and disgusting) bodily-function/fluid ""humor"".  And conversely, I also find it ironic that some folks would use the word ""wholesome"" in any sentence related to this film; it's nothing remotely of the sort.
It's an ok and entertaining film overall, but it would be better if Dreamworks realized there are other laughs you can earn besides cheap ones, and there are other ways to do it besides wallowing in scatology.",1005609600,2,934,4.746913580246914

The second disc has the more technically detailed special features, as well as the full widescreen movie (the one you should watch, since it has the whole thing - it also has a superior soundtrack since there's a DTS soundtrack).

Now I enjoy toilet humor as much as the next guy, but I don't know if being in the same league as Beavis and Butthead is really where they should be aiming.
Shrek likes to make fun of Disney movies, but it would have been nice if they could have had the quality of one.  For example, Eddie Murphy played an annoying dragon in Mulan, but the movie as a whole had a better story and was more enjoyable.
I guess the story was passable, but it didn't smack of quality like most Disney movies do.
As for the animation, I thought some of the scenery was good, but overall the character animation was poor. Any scene with a crowd reminded me of Scooby Doo. Really, I think a modern video card (say a geforce 3) could probably do a similar rendering job in real time.  Compare the animation on Shrek to Toy Story 2 or A Bug's Life -- much lower quality, less attention to detail.  Those were older movies, but still their animation held up and their stories were far superior in my opinion.  There really is no comparison between Shrek and Monsters, Inc.

I also heard a review(s) saying that the language was another reason.  Not to offend people, but I am currently in 8th grade, and even the 6th and 5th graders have heard MUCH worse language and humor than in SHREK.  Now to the actual content of the movie....
It was unbelievable how different the movie was than what I thought it would be, despite how my friend tried to convince me.  I saw it with her though, and was completely surprised!  The storyline is not run-of-the-mill, and the actors seemed born to play their roles.  At first I couldn't get over SHREK having a British accent, but then it seemed as if it was one of the most natural things in the world.  Of course you know that Donkey is going to be quite a humorous character because of Eddie Murphy speaking him, but Mike Myers still becomes the real star of the movie.  Usually in movies that are based off of fairy tales the creators make the heroine helpless and dependent on the hero.  I enjoyed Princess Fiona because of her fiery self, and her independence.  Lord Farquaad was my favorite character because (as I heard in the DVD) of all the creatures he was throwing out of Duloc, he would consider himself one of those people!  He just can't get over how great he thinks he is, and him being so short gives the movie more humorous gags.

it was horribly predictable, trite to degrees that i had not had the displeasure of witnessing until then, and most importantly - it WAS NOT FUNNY.
ok, predictability isn't a huge deal: lets face it, its a kids movie. there aren't going to be plot twists to deal with. but come on, didn't everyone see the whole hackneyed 'moral' coming a mile away? the whole judging a book by its cover/beauty is in the eye of the beholder theme is horribly overused and resolution was pretty apparent from the start. it was just a matter of sitting and groaning through the tripe that led up to the end.
why does everyone think this movie was funny? it WASNT. AT ALL. and before everyone starts getting upset about having no sense of humor, or relaxing because its a kids movie, i'd like to say that i liked Toy Story, A Bugs Life, Chicken Run (and all of the Wallace and Gromit movies), and absolutely LOVED Toy Story 2. honestly, when i went to see TS2, i was like ""ok, it'll be cute like the first one."" much to my surprise (and delight) i was stomach hurt from laughing so much. i was rolling in the aisle. it was an absolutely marvelous movie.
but shrek wasn't funny. at. all.
scratch that, the only remotely funny parts were not the sexual innuendos, but the fact that when shrek made the innuendos, the rest of the characters didn't get it. example:
shrek (looking at the prince's tower): do you think he's making up for something? *wink* *wink*
other characters: what?
that was a little funny. but everything else? NO!! the jokes weren't funny and eddie murphy was just annoying.

1314882,5,B00003CXXI,"Shrek is without a doubt one of the most fresh and original films to come along in a long while.  While some might frown upon its rather ""adult oriented"" material (something that helped Dreamworks's last computer animated movie, Antz, work so well) others will realize this movie is more for us adults in the first place.  Sure, we've all seen the Disney films like Snow White, Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty etc.  The thought of turning those classics on their ears with a comic twist is enough to entice many of us to see Shrek, even if only out of curiosity.  And with comic talents such as Mike Myers (as Shrek), Eddie Murphy (as Donkey), Camerine Diaz (as Princess Fiona) & John Lithgow (as Lord Farquaad) you know you're going to be howling all the way through the picture.
The story, like most great animated features, is pretty simple, but with added intrigue.  Because of Lord Farquaad, all the fairytale creatures have been banished to Shrek (the Ogre)'s swamp.  So to get them off his land he goes to the kingdom of DuLoc (accompanied by a talking Donkey) where Farquaad offers him a deal...free Princess Fiona from the clutches of an hideous dragon, and he will give him back his swamp as well as get rid of all the fairytale characters.  Then you have your typical ""Quest Scenerio"" (with a twist) having Shrek (w/Donkey) going to save the Princess.  (see the movie to learn more :-)
Even the background characters such as the Gingerbread Man are a hoot.  And to any ""Red Dwarf"" fan out there...doesn't Farquaads's magic mirror look a whole lot like Kryton (the robot)'s head?  From the Fantastic computer animation that just makes you say ""WOW"" to wonderful Fairytale surroundings, Shrek is an instant classic that kids & adults alike will be watching for decades to come.
The DVD is a 2 Disc set, mostly 2 discs so the filmmakers could make everybody happy by giving us both a Full Frame (Pan & Scan) version of Shrek to watch (1.33:1) as well as a Widescreen (Letterboxed) version (1.78:1).  A very cute scene is added at the very end of the movie (after all the credits have finished) that is just hilarious!  The DVDs have quite a lot of special features, such as a Behind the scenes featurette with interviews from the cast & crew.  The Tech of Shrek: a small look behind the creation of the revolutionary visual computer anmimation, is quite interesting.  Plus there are technical goofs (the Chia Pet Donkey is just a gas!) and much much more.  But not everything came out perfect.  The Game Swamp section is somewhat disappointing.  With any game you play, not only do you not receive any type of reward or congradulations for winning, but for many choices you make in the game, it's mostly up to chance to get them correct (choose 1 out of 3 doors to continue your quest...but they all look the same!).  Dreamworks should take a look at the fun games Disney has been giving us, namely Dopey's Wild Mine Ride, which is a lot of fun.  Disney has even done DVD games where the winner gets to see a bonus cartoon as his reward.  Take notes, Dreamworks.  And the audio commentary is pretty good, but what I wouldn't give for an ""Actors commentary"" with Mike, Eddie, Cameron & John altogether (for the first time it would seem) discussing the film with hilarous anecdotes and laugh out loud humor.  But don't let this in any way stop you from buying the movie.  It's still very much worth it!  Plus id you have a DVD-ROM, there's even more fun!

1314984,5,B00003CXXI,"Movies are not usually on my want list...but ever since I saw the ads for this one, I've wanted it. Made my husband go right out and buy it. I don't think Hollywood or Disney realize how difficult it is for us deaf people to lipread cartoon characters! Though the animation is far beyond what was seen five years ago, normally it would not be enough to carry the story. What makes it all the more valuable is the original story and the voices and personalities of the characters. It is amazing how much personality the graphic artists can give these computer characters. I know I cannot hear the voices and tones, but I certainly got the humor and recognized the artists behind the voices (through the drawings and through the attitudes of the characters).
the story is sweet and poignant, and is essential viewing for children because of the concepts it teaches. However, the humor is way beyond most children. The writing is definitely geared toward adults, though my granddaughter at three was mesmerized for the entire length of the film! My husband and I were laughing so hard...tears were falling.
This will definitely be a family favorite. It serves to remind us that it is what inside that counts, not the surface beauty which too often the world puts such importance on. Kudos to everyone involved.

1314985,5,B00003CXXI,"I watched Shrek with my 3 year old sone when it was released in theaters and enjoyed it tremendously.  I could not wait to get the tape--it is a masterpiece worth having in your video library even if you do not have kids.
The story about the unfriendly ogre in search and defence of his privacy is very cute.  Trying to save his swamp-home from the invasion of the fairy tales creatures, Shrek goes on a quest to save a princess. He meets a talking donkey who decides that Shrek would be his friend.  The journey is quite funny and the happy ending quite unconventional.
There are several things that make this movie superb entertainment:
1. It is movie for kids and adults alike.  The fairy tale story line is fun for the kids.  The various puns, allegories and jokes are fun for the adults.  Do not be misled by the fact that it is animation--it is not a cheesy, all-cute Disney type feature.  On the contrary, it makes fun of features like that.
2. The animation is great.  The 3D animation is superb--detailed, bright and realistic (as realistic as an ogre can be)
3. The voices of the actors are excellent.  Mike Meyers, Eddie Murphie and Cameron Diaz do a great job giving the characters a life of their own.  Especially Eddie Murphy.
4. Finally, the sound track is so much fun, I had to get the CD as well.",1005177600,4,1313,4.410788381742739
1314986,5,B00003CXXI,I like this movie soooo much. Lots of allusions to other movies. A perfect computer-animation...great. The Special Edition is worth every little penny. A must have for every collector.,1005177600,2,184,5.379310344827586
1314987,3,B00003CXXI,"I waited for one month in great expectation of the DVD verson of Shrek.  There were games and other cool features on this two disk set that I couldn't wait to tear into.  Looks like lots of fun, right?  Pretty disapointing.  The cool games won't run off the DVD player on your TV.  You have to have a PC running Windows 98, an internet connection and a DVD rom.  We all have internet connection with our computers, and most of us have CD- roms on our computers.  But I doubt that all the people who buy this DVD will have computers with DVD players.  And while I have one that does, it's a Mac.  No good.
 On the other hand, there's still a lot to enjoy on the DVD verson.  There are two versons of the movie(formatted and widescreen) behind the scenes footage, and other interesting stuff.  I really haven't looked at everything yet, and while it's worth the price, it doesn't deliver on the interactive games.  Guess I got burned . . . I'll know better next time.",1005177600,,965,4.324022346368715
1314988,5,B00003CXXI,"I'll come right out and say it: ""Shrek"" is one of the best movies of the year, a nonstop laugh riot with a morality lesson and extremely likeable characters in tow. In fact, this highly unconventional fairy tale boasts so many winning voices performances and completely riotous humor that it's impossible not to be dazzled by its irresistible charm and tenacious wit. Of course, this is no Disney movie, but it doesn't attempt to be, and that makes it even better.
Perhaps the most winning aspect of this delight is its successful ability to turn the clichd fairy tale into a fresh and inviting premise, where nothing is what we have come to believe it should be. Poking fun at the Disney franchise, the plot surrounds a lonely ogre named Shrek (voiced by Mike Myers), who lives in solitude not so much because he wants to, but because he feels his physical appearance is appalling to others. So it comes as a shock when several Disney characters appear at his door, cast out of their kingdom by the devious Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow).
This is where the movie takes everything we know about fantasy and reverses it. Shrek becomes the hero of sorts, the gallant knight in shining armor who journeys to rescue the beautiful Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz), who lays sleeping in the tower of a castle guarded by a fire-breathing dragon. Why does he do it? Not for love, but for the deed to his swampland, which he will receive upon delivering the princess to Farquaad's kingdom.
And just as Shrek is characterized out of the ordinary, so is Princess Fiona, who becomes a witty, easily irritable kung-fu goddess instead of the clichd waif of standard fairy tales. This new spin on the damsel in distress is frequently funny, showcased most notably in a scene in which a French Robin Hood attempts to win her heart, only to feel the heel of her boot (add this scene to the list of ongoing ""Matrix"" spoofs). Her awaiting Lord Farquaad is also not the standard villain: his height leaves much to be desired, providing for various jokes and humor at his expense.
These characters are some of the best of their kind, completely animated yet easy to get a feel for. The combined talents of Myers, Murphy, Diaz and Lithgow all combust to make these characters more convincing and humorous than most others of the genre. The computer animation aspect is not new, but has developed over the years since ""Toy Story;"" here, its purpose is not to instill a sense of realism (we can discern it as fantasy), but to add to the cheeriness and freshness of the already exuberant plot.
The layout of the film's script is amazing, a work of comedic art that transcends all comedy genres to become a good-natured laugh riot. The constant ramblings of Eddie Murphy will no doubt please kids and adults alike, while the various spoofs of fairy tales will induce fits of laughter. At one point, Lord Farquaad interrogates the Gingerbread Man by dangling him over a glass of milk, then questions Snow White's magic mirror as to who his bride will be. A few instances of toilet humor make this animated feature somewhat ambitious, but it knows its limits and complies with them.
The film's morality lesson about the judgmental society is also one of its strong points. Shrek is seen as monstrous by various characters, though his winning charm and sense of humor provide the age-old lesson that it's what's inside a person that truly counts. The secret behind Princess Fiona also helps to advance this point, and by the film's end, it has succeeded in making that point splendidly.
My face bore a great smile during the beginning moments of ""Shrek,"" and remained that way throughout the entire movie. The film is a wondrous spectacle of animation, well-liked characters, and some of the most enlightening humor of any movie this year. It's ability to turn our vision of a fairy tale completely upside down is a rousing success, as is virtually everything else about this enormously entertaining treat.",1005091200,2,3972,4.757971014492754
1315036,5,B00003CXXI,"What a great, refreshing movie this is! I was so pleasantly surprised with it. I think what I like most about it is that it does not take itself too seriously and pokes fun at other movies in this similar genre (such as Disney movies). It really is a hoot and great entertainment. This film is not really for kids, more like young adults and adults young at heart. I found it much more fun than anything by Disney or Pixar.
The DVD presentation is wonderful and the DTS soundtrack is so involving it practically tickles your ears!",1005091200,,530,4.418367346938775
1315037,5,B00003CXXI,"""Shrek"" is very funny, and is probably the best movie I've seen this year. The extra features are also very fun including two short documentaries (together equal apx 1 hr); humorous ""interviews"" with the cast: Shrek, Princess Fiona, & Donkey; and music videos. An added plus is disc 1 has the full-frame version, and disc 2 has the widescreen version. It also has some funny games, many of which you must do with a DVDrom drive.
The only flaw is the promotional sticker on the front of the case. Unlike usual DVDs which put stickers on the shrink wrap, this movie has the sticker directly on the case. I (foolishly) attempted to remove it, and just made more sticky residue. I suggest you purchase this DVD [it's great] and then contact DreamWorks (the studio which released this DVD) at (972) 293-5903 and request a replacement case as I have done.

1315038,4,B00003CXXI,"So before I go out and rent Shrek, I am told that it is the best movie of the year. I get my hopes up, believing that Shrek will entertain me and all that, but I was a little disappointed. Don't get me wrong. It was a hilarious movie with a cute story line, but I don't think I can consider it the best movie of the year. Yes, the donkey, or I should say Eddie Murphy, does do a great job with the little humorous dialogue here and there but it just needed a little bit more from every character.
 The day before I rented Shrek, I saw the movie Monsters Inc.. I definetly compared the two and I thought Monsters a more all around cute, hilarious, and great story line movie. This is probably my source of comparison and is probably where my synicism arised from. I guess the two movies are very much different but I definetly believe Shrek really uncomparable to Monsters Inc.",1005091200,,876,4.245508982035928

One warning:  There's a lot of, er, bathroom humor in the movie, especially related to, er, flatulence.  It's over the head of a 3-4 year old, but I'm not sure I'd want an 8-year-old watching it.",1005091200,,484,4.454545454545454

comical fantasy adventure , Mike Myers brings out a comical and
touching side to the green ogre Shrek who just want's people to
accept him for who he is. A furry mouthy Donky who is delighfully
played by none other then Eddie Murphy who is just called Donkey.
Who accompanys Shrek on a quest from Lord Farquadd played by the
funny Jhon Lithgow , Shrek want's his land back after winning a
tourniment Farquadd tells him that he will have his land back the

One thing I haven't heard anyone mention yet, however, is the wonderful message it sends to girls or to anyone who has ever felt less than a perfect ""10."" To say more might jeopardize the ending, so suffice it to say that this tale is a twist on the beauty and the beast theme, but has the courage on more than one level not to bale out at the end and pretty the beast up to conform to superficial ideals of romantic love. The movie dares us to accept ourselves as we are and to see women as equals to men. Fiona is quite capable of taking care of herself, thank you very much, and doesn't have to look like, well, like Cameron Diaz to be worthy of love.
 I was also very impressed by Mike Myers's performance as Shrek. He completely loses himself in the character; he's at once gruff and vulnerable, and at no time does he grandstand for a cheap laugh.

Dreamworks has put together an excellent DVD.  The transfer is just flawless.  The picture is clean and there is no edge enhancement.

It is easily one of the funniest movie of its genre up there with Disney's ""Toy Story,"" ""The Emperor's New Groove"" and now with ""Monsters, Inc."" Ironically enough, a large part of the fun you can have is directly tied to the parody the movie makes of Disney classic fairy tales such as ""Snow White"" and ""Cinderella"".

In addition to this, there is a very original combination of contemporary pop/rock tunes with the scenes of the movie which takes it out of the traditional fairy tale genre.

1315277,1,B00003CXXI,"Whilst the animation was superb, the content was disturbing.
Eddy Murphy was actually the funniest and better voice over. Mike Myers was extremely unconvincing as an ogre and what a poor attempt at a Scottish accent, his performance was dull and lacked emotion. Cameron Diaz could have been anyone - nothing outstanding there.
This is a kids' movie??? We were shocked by the violence and the extremely unfunny cruelty to animals. Once we had endured the fight scene, the parts that really bothered us were firstly, when the Princess sings to a bird, delightfully heartwarming at first, then she purposefully sings so loudly and high pitched that the bird explodes, leaving its legs and three eggs behind, the eggs are promptly fried up for breakfast. Secondly, when Shrek blows into a frog's mouth, inflating it into a balloon. These scenes are completely unsuitable for children - what do they teach our impressionable youngsters? We gave up watching at this point, glad that we had decided to censor before our four year old got a chance to see the movie.

It's characters are curt, wholesome characters, the humor I found boring and undermining to the likes of Eddie Murphy and Cameron Diaz.  Do they really need to work so badly as to diminish themselves to hidden comedy.  It's a far cry from their acting abilities so well demonstrated in the likes of ""The Golden Child"", and ""Something About Mary"".  Cummon, do they need to make themselves so invisible here?
If you like comedy, go find the artistic expression in its live form; bury this ""Toy Story"" nonsense already.  It's played out with Tom Hanks.  Give me something like the presence of Paula Poundstone or Rodney Dangerfield, live.  Even Rodney strut his ""stuff"" in ""Caddyshack"".  :)  And please, let the kids find something less contrived to laugh at, like the ""Tubbies"" or ""Smerfs"".

1315280,4,B00003CXXI,"I just LOVE this movie, but am frustrated because I'd love for my kids to be able to own it and they can't.
What's great about this movie:  The story line is awesome, the female lead [Princess Fiona, Cameron Diaz] is a phenomenal *strong* woman, the sound track rules, the animation is gorgeous, the movie is absolutely HYSTERICAL in many places, the sly takes on Disney are very entertaining, etc.  [This is the best fairly tale *I've* ever seen or read].
What stinks about this movie:  I have a 3 year old daughter who LOVED this movie and Princess Fiona [a great antidote to one too many Disney heroines she's been exposed to], but I can't buy this DVD for her and I feel a little chagrinned that we let her watch it once to begin with.  The word ""Damn"" is used twice [Gads - I know its not the end of the world, but I don't need my sweet little girl saying ""damn"" to grandma...].  The ""potty humor"" is over the top [and, having a preschooler, I'm pretty tolerant of potty humor].  The ""gross out factor"" in the beginning is a little over the top too.  Some of the situations are ""adult"" as well.
I'm just sad - by leaving a few little things out here and there [like curse words and fart jokes], this could have been an awesome fairly tale for little girls who NEED to see a heroine who can take up for herself.  And what a GREAT message for little girls in the age of anorexia anyway...[if you've seen the end, you know what I mean here].  We wouldn't need to ""Revive Ophelia"" if we had more heroines like Fiona around.
This is a GREAT movie - I just wish I could buy it for my kids.",1004659200,14,1588,4.231788079470198
1315281,5,B00003CXXI,"The DVD actually out does the theatrical version. The extended ending gave me belly laughs and the extras are worth 5 stars by themselves. I'd agree that Shrek lacks the sweetness of Toy Story but it more than makes up for that with its visual and verbal barbs aimed everywhere (The Matrix, Disney, Snow White, classic rock songs, fairytales, etc.). Shrek manages to spoof a number of genres all within less than two hours.
The dual disc release is a great way to cram as many extras on without sacrificing picture quality. The second disc has a director commentary that's both fun and enlightening. Additional extras are animation tests and a DVD rom game. Including both the widescreen and full screen versions is perfect for this family; I prefer the widescreen films to the pan and scanned versions while my wife and kids prefer the full screened. We're both kept happy in the process.
The picture quality is crisp, sharp and has a depth that is at times startling. The sound mix is great whether you're watching it on your television or in DTS.

Someone compared it to ""Princess Bride"". I agree that both are great funny family movies, but that's as far as the comparison can go. Shrek has it's own original flavor. I didn't feel like I was seeing a remake of anything else. Which is quite a fete considering the number of animated and other stories out there. I was happy with the mix of actors used for this movie. Myers, Murphy, Diaz, and Lithgow did great jobs. They worked well together and made a fantasy have believable characters. I was impressed with how well Michael Myers pulled off the Scottish accent. As we know some actors/actresses (i.e. Kevin Costner in Robin Hood) can't do foreign accents. The movie pokes jabs at a number of Disney and other movies and there is so many off hand remarks that it will take several viewings to catch them all.

Shrek has neither of these problems.  In this highly entertaining film, the monster isn't a monster, the evil dragon isn't all that evil, and the beautiful damsel who needs to be rescued isn't a beautiful damsel, and she's perfectly capable of rescuing herself.  It's full of tons of positive messages about tolerance, prejudism, inner beauty, gender equality, and other such noble ideas that simply don't come across clearly in other films...Shrek is well animated, well written, and very well acted.  It's absolutely hilarious at times, and very touching at others.  I can't imagine anyone not falling in love with it and wanting to watch it over and over again.",1004313600,,884,5.027397260273973
1315365,3,B00003CXXI,"SHREK has some appealing moments. It also has some nice things to say about how society focuses too much on external beauty and not enough about a person's soul. Unfortunately, a lot of the film's inherent charm is diminished by the crude way in which it is handled. This is really a shame, because the film could have been so much more.
Apparently, studio executives dread the ""G"" rating like the plague. Instead, they insert unnecessary scatological humor to ""beef up"" the rating. Hopefully, this pattern will change, but it doesn't appear likely.
In short, you might want to keep the little kids away from this one. It might pass for older kids and teenagers, but you might want to consider other alternatives first. If in doubt, pre-screen the film first.",1004313600,3,759,4.801526717557252

There is no flaw to be found in the animators' strive to bring the voice actors expressions and emotions to every word of dialouge, you really get every nuance. You will laugh again, and again at this witty and beautiful movie. There are several extra features packed onto the 2 disc set, enough to keep children AND adults entertained long after the movie has ended.
The only thing questionable about this edition is that the feature does appear on BOTH discs, disc one is Pan & Scan (4:3) and in DDS only, and disc 2 has the Widescreen (16:9 enhanced) in DTS also. This nugget of info seemed to be a secret I did not discover until after watching (to my 16:9 tv's dismay) disc one, and viewing the extras on Disc 2.

After i saw it, i took my baby cousins, my friend, my mum and my grandmother to go and see it. It is rare that you will find a movie that appeals to all these demogrpahic groups but in Shrek you have the answer to the family movie dilemma.
The quality of the image is magnificent, the characters colourful and the voice acting superb. Eddie Murphy is at his best since Beverly Hills Cop as the fast talking donkey, and although many people have criticised Cameron Diaz's role, it is beyond reproach. Mike Meyers and John Lithgow turn in similarly professional efforts as Shrek and Lord Farquaad.
The humour is razor sharp and there is enough witty sarcasm to appeal to the adults, as well as Shrek's disgusting habits to appeal to the little ones. Disney will not be happy with some of the biting satire aimed in its direction!

 Staring a likeable if not slightly repulsive ogre, Shrek takes place in a swamp.  Shrek, the ogre has lived peacefully all alone in his swamp until Lord Farquaad, the shortest ruler you will have ever seen, evicts all Fairy Tale Creatures to the swamp.  Shrek sets out on a quest, accompanied by ""Donkey"", to give Farquaad a good talking to and regain his home.  Lord Farquaad meanwhile, has just been told by his trusty Mirror on The Wall, that he is not a true king until he weds a princess.  The Mirror shows him Princess Fiona, held captive in a castle guarded by a dragon, and he is determined to find her.  Only he'd rather not be the one doing the finding.
  When Shrek arrives, demanding his swamp back, Farquaad sees his opportunity.  He assigns Shrek the quest of finding Princess Fiona, and in return Farquaad will return the swamp.  So Shrek and the perpetually annoying Donkey set off in search of the fair Fiona.  Shrek is prepared to run and retrive the princess, but he is not prepared to face the emotion he finds after rescuing Fiona, Love.

Mike Meyers supplies the voice for Shrek, a mysanthopic green ogre who lives in a cave deep in the forest.

1315502,4,B00003CXXI,"This movie has some of the best 3D animation so far. The story is great, pulling from many children's storybook characters, and delving into social issues through the simple story of good versus the not-so-good. However, I did have a few problems with it. I'll give a short list of the good and the bad (as I think the movie is great, but could have been even better):
The good:
1) The animation and artwork is phenomenal.
2) The story is fun, interesting, and even surprising.
3) The characters are well developed, and the voices are great.
4) There is a message of good intentions.
The bad:
1) This movie doesn't know if it is for kids or adults. I say this with all good intentions. Anyone can enjoy this movie, but I can't help but wonder how good it could have been if focused on one specific audience.
2) The green ogre versus the short little bad guy is misguided. There is a mixed message here. I think the movie fails in it's intention of teaching people to look beyond first impressions. Whoops! It proves that the writer and director have little ability to recognize their own prejudices. I think this is a huge failure if this is a movie for children.
3) The movie can become somewhat clich. If this is a movie for adults, the movies central romance follows the map of two characters who don't get along at first, are forced to be together, and suddenly find themselves falling in love during there adventure. Of course, there is the occasional pandering burp choke for children, and the sidekick donkey. Again, is this a kid movie or an adult movie?
I don't want anyone to see this as a negative review. I think Shrek was one of the most enjoyable movies to come out last year. However, I feel, with something so well done in it's character development, artwork, and basic storyline, this movie has failed to focus on a target audience, and sometimes relies too much on Hollywood clichs to fill in the gaps. If you're going to spend this kind of time making a movie, make it a masterpiece.

This movie would fit most cleanly into the category of a fractured fairy tale, although it goes beyond the genre.  In fact what makes Shrek (and Shrek 2) so enjoyable is the quirky sence of humor as it pokes fun and paradies elements of not only fairy tails but all sorts of pop culture.  Characters from all sorts of Nursery rhymes and fairy tales make amusing appearances, from the Gingerbread man to Pinnochio, 3 Blind Mice, Robin Hood and Sleeping Beauty.  There are references and tributes to other movies such as the Matrix and in the second movie, the Lord of the Rings and Jurassic Park.  In fact this movie wouldn't be half as fun if you weren't well versed in the various fairy tales and cultural references the movie relies on.

There is a little bit of mild language in the film, and a lot of the humour I don't think is recommended for any children under the age of ten, however, they still may enjoy the movie.
One of the things that makes this movie great has to be Eddie Murphy.  If you have a character that's completely comical, then he's the one to get.  Not to mention he does a dang good job of it, too.
It's a twisted fairy tale with plenty of added humour, and personally, I urge everyone to at least rent it.",1001894400,2,670,4.21875

Sure, there is a little ""potty humor"" as one reviewer wrote, but so mild that the kids laugh and look at you like ""boy, are we getting away with something"". This movie has so much heart and feeling, I never would have expected anything close to this. I am NOT an Eddie Murphy fan, and I absolutely LOVE him as Donkey in this movie. I don't know a lot of people who can't identify with some aspect of Donkey's character. This is such a clever movie, even after seeing it so much, there is always something else to see. This definitely isn't Disney, but not everything has to be to be good.
Shrek is a keeper, and I can't wait for the video. I almost hope they don't make a sequel. I don't see how they can top this one. It was wonderful.",1001808000,,824,4.15625
1315636,4,B00003CXXI,"When a good lady friend insisted that I watch a movie-length animation featuring the party responsible for unleashing the nauseating Austin Powers oeuvre on the world, I cringed inside. For agonizing minutes, I honestly suspected that this friend had lost the critical faculties I'd admired (no, let's face it, fell in love with) in her since we were both in high school, but the film was only a couple of hours... and the friend's company was worth so very much more than a trivial period of discomfort, so I went with her. I needn't have worried.
Mike Myers and Steven Spielberg labored, like the proverbial elephant, for two years and brought forth - ahh, the heck with that metaphor, they made a fine movie.  Much finer than I expected, or given Myers' dismal track record after the first ""Wayne's World"" movie, had any reason to expect.
The movie Shrek both inhabits the fairy tale genre and sends it up without a trace of self-consciousness. Myers is wonderful as the gruff, unapologetically gross ogre with a Scots brogue (imagine Sean Connery in his latter, one-accent-fits-all-acting, decrepit digestive system days, dealing with the aftermath of too much haggis and McEwan's) and Eddie Murphy turns in a solid supporting performance as his wise-cracking donkey sidekick.

John Lithgow reprises his self-absorbed egotist persona which has served him so well in his other recent work and bends it adroitly to the needs of his current role as the nasty autarch of the fairy-tale kingdom, and Cameron Diaz is refreshing as the much-besought fairy-tale princess imbued with a healthy dollop of 21st century gurl attitude.
The other supporting characters, down to the wind-up singing musicbox dolls which greet visitors to the kingdom, duchy, whatever with an insanely funny recitation of its laws, are also well-crafted and hugely entertaining. I came away from the film with sidestitches from laughing. I shouldn't really have been surprised - when Spielberg sets himself a task, even as seemingly trivial a job as an animated feature, he almost always delivers a benchmark product, and this is no exception.
And the ending... well, the ending is something special, and quite unexpected.  You may have to watch the show a few times to totally appreciate the ending, but I won't spoil it for you. It's just a great ending, trust me.
So why did I hold back the fifth star?  Because the plot did seem to drag (Steven, Steeeeeveeeennn, you of all people!);  because parodies, even masterful ones, necessarily have a degree of triteness to them (I'm waiting to be proven wrong on that), and because it wasn't enough for Mike Myers to not be as bad as he was in the Austin Powers films... he could have turned in a better job of acting than he did, but I can't give him better than solid ""B"" grades for his job in ""Shrek"" (even though I was relieved that he chose to climb out of the sewer his spy parodies inhabit).
I owe my friend many thanks (over the many I already owe her) for insisting we see this film... her judgment in these matters  remains unvarnished.  Thanks, Fiona.
Watch ""Shrek."" Take the kids. Buy the DVD, as it's unlikely that mere videotape will suffice to reproduce the whole computer-generated viewing experience that is ""Shrek.""
In ""Shrek,"" Steven Spielberg has finally produced the ""killer app"" for DVD technology, the movie that makes it worth the hundred dollars or so for most people to buy a DVD player if they don't already have one.",1001808000,,3462,4.857627118644068
1315637,4,B00003CXXI,"Shrek is a film I enjoyed watching just as much as my 11 year old and 9 year old children did. The main character in this computer animated fairy tale is an ogre named Shrek (voiced by Mike Myers). He's not handsome, he's not friendly and he's not happy. But his life changes when he sets off to rescue a princess from the mean and conceited Lord Farquaad (voiced by John Lithgow). Accompanied by a witty donkey (voiced by Eddie Murphy), he outsmarts a fire-breathing dragon and tolerates a strong-willed princess (voiced by Cameron Diaz). When he falls in love with the princess he faces his greatest challenge and that is to feel worthy of her love. There's a transformation after they kiss which is the big surprise in this movie. From its ""Once Upon a Time"" beginning to its ""Happily Ever After"" ending, Shrek will warm your heart, tickle your funny bone and remind us all of the true meaning of beauty.

This movie is fabulous. The computer graphics are so real that they jump off the screen. The characters emotions, expressions and mannerisms are so real that you can't help but get involved and find them endearing and loveable. The cast it perfect, from Mike Myers to John Lithgow and the script is genius. This is a movie that you and your children will LOVE, your children will love the fairy tale characters and the animations and any adult will find the ""grown up"" humor to be hilarious. My only warning is that this isn't a movie (even though animated) for small children, they just won't get it. The dialogue is very adult and sometimes raunchy and even the animation won't make the story clear for small children.

The character development is amazing for an animated film, and takes on such detail and feeling that you feel almost like shrek and his donkey are you and your best friend.

This 93 minute hell-bent-for-leather fairly tale will make you smile, laugh out loud, maybe shed a tear, and clap your hands together at the end. Mike Myers does the best job of voice since Tom Hanks did ""Woody"" in ""Toy Story"". Instantly likable as the ogre ""Shrek""... his wit and subtle humor is drawn out by the fast talking donkey (also played to a tee by Eddie Murphy). Cameron Diaz does a good job as the Princess and John Lithgow plays the mean villain Lord Farquaad (Lithgow is exceptional at ""bad guy"" roles - if you haven't seem him in ""Cliffhanger"" - that is one to rent or buy). Farquaad's kingdome is a spoof on everything Disney... naturally this film is made by an less than happy ex-Disney employee (Katzenburg). Check out all the Disney characters and listen to the funny remarks that are said about them... one for example regarding Snow White - the Magic Mirror says: ""She lives with seven men, but she's not easy."" Other memorable lines... Princess: ""What kind of knight are you?"" Shrek: ""One of a kind."" Donkey: ""I'm a donkey on the edge!"" and ""Hey, what about Shrek? He's ugly 24/7!"" and ""I ain't never met someone who didn't like parfait. You never hear someone say, 'Hey, you want some parfait?' 'Hell no, I don't want no parfait!'""... the donkey had so many great lines - great comic relief. Also note a great time had by the entire cartoon cast singing ""I'm A Believer"" (made famous by the Monkees) at the conclusion. Fact: Chris Farley was slated as the original Shrek. When he died, the lead role was given to his SNL buddy Mike Myers. Myers changed the voice 3/4's the way thru the production - from English to Scotish. Great flick... excellent widescreen visual effects, sound & music.

1315705,5,B00003CXXI,"Shrek is the perfect film for a not so perfect family. Every fairy tale in the movie is fractured in some way, or badly criticized. This is what makes Shrek plenty of fun. Shrek is an anti hero, someone who doesn't expect anything coming his way. Everytime an eventual adventure approaches him, Shrek always reluctantly steps up to the plate. That's what Disney heroes lack. Second, Shrek isn't exactly prince charming. That's brilliantly funny since Mike Myers provides a Scottish type accent. Not too handsome and not too ugly, Shrek can somehow convince you that he can steal a princess' heart. The supporting cast blew me away too. Princess Fiona boasts the best computer animation and Cameron Diaz provided a good voice for her. The comic relief of this tale is Donkey, played by Eddie Murphy. Every single joke brought so many laughes. I'm sure it will for you too. John Lithgow is the voice for the stature challenged Lord Farquaad. He is a villain filled with an egotistical mind and an eye for a dream kingdom. So, to sum it all up, Shrek should be noted for two things.

1315772,5,B00003CXXI,"If you're looking for something a little less wholesome then Disney, but still well within the limits of 'Family values', then may I recommend Shrek. I have not had this much fun watching a movie in a long time. A fantastically fractured fairy tale that prods fun at every childhood story character and plot line that ever existed. No one is left unscathed, including Disney. There are a few major shameless blasts made at the mouse house enterprise but when it's all over, it's mostly harmless.  In fact, you may think it was done out of jealousy. Shrek is incredibly animated, with textures and motions that surpass the famed Toy Story series. Every year computer animation gets better and better and this movie uses it to the fullest extent. There is no better format for this movie either. The number and diversity of the characters is well played out and well displayed in computer generation. Standard animation would not have cut it in this movie. The story line is simple; a large imposing Ogre (voiced by Mike Myers in his perfected Scottish brogue) who only wants to be left alone in his swamp, is suddenly imposed upon by every fairy tale character as they are thrown out of the kingdom. They have nowhere else to go. Out of selfishness, Shrek goes to see Lord Farquaad and ends up striking a deal to rescue a princess in order to get his swamp back. Followed menacingly by a Donkey (Eddie Murphy, in his second and even funnier voiceover roll), Shrek ventures off to a dark Castle to rescue the Princess. Upon doing this, in a spectacular battle scene no less, the three head back to Farquaad. Along the way, Shrek finds more to the princess then he thought he ever would, strangely there is something of a soul mate in this beautiful fairy tale lady. Well played also by Cameron Diaz, she is not your typical royalty. She can very well take care of herself, fighting off bandits in Matrix style kung fu precision and keeping up with Shrek in a display of bodily functions. This all leads up to a nice morality play ending that doesn't push the issue and lends to nice surprise as well. All the actors do a splendid job of voicing their characters. Everyone is alive and flowing. Murphy is especially hilarious, topping his performance as the mini-dragon in Mulan, mainly because he doesn't seem to have to hold back as much. The movie is so well paced that there are no lags, it flows right to the end. Funny, satirical, playful and beautifully animated, this movie holds all the right cards for entertainment.

In the end, I cried and cried because I relate to Shrek now that I am alone.  When this story ended up like Cinderella or Sleeping Beauty I couldn't believe it; I just cried.  I recommended it to everyone I know and they all enjoyed it, too.  I think the story is just so universally enjoyable it has to be an all time hit!",998352000,,552,4.036697247706422

On seeing the film I didn't find the first half very funny at all, but once the donkey is introduced with the hillarious voice over from Eddie Murphy the film actually is fun. Technically it's great no doubts there and the rest of the voice overs are good...but for me the stuff from PIXAR is still the best. The two Toy Story's and a Bugs Life are great to watch, very funny, action packed and overall great story telling. Not to forget the great outtakes at the end of there movies.

But John Lithgos character is based on a person from Disney who knocked back the movie and i reckon good on them for doing that!

Mike Myers and Eddie Murphy add their voice talent to this pleasant surprise!  Now this film is proof, that Disney doesn't have the ""greatest"" animated hits ever!  I wonder if a computer animated film could win Best Picture at the Academy Awards?  If so, it should definetely be at least nominated.  Shrek is spectacular!",998092800,,518,4.873563218390805
1315831,5,B00003CXXI,"An ogre Shrek (Mike Myers) thunders out of a fairy tale storybook to steer clear of him; a donkey (Eddie Murphy) follows his saviour when his fairy-tale land is devastated by the evil plans of Lord Farquaad who is narcissistic and short-tempered. Even the heroine, Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) is not your typical stereotyped beauty, but a spoiled, independent woman who rules with her dry wits and sardonic humour. Shrek makes a pact with the Lord Farquaad (voiced superbly by John Lithglow) to rescue his bride from the sentinel dragon in the castle, but falls in love with Fiona as they learn more about themselves in the rollicking adventure.
SHREK coming from DREAMWORKS, takes a stab at Disney's imagery on fairy tale and that reality bites - this fractured story tale from the hands of William Steinburg is an instant classic with its wits and dry humour that charms not even the children but finally a cartoon feature that is sophisticatedly computer-animated even to make the adults captivated. The morality is devastatingly told - when the audience learns about beauty is only skin-deep and that ugliness could be a form of tender beauty. Savagely touching and poignant, it transcends the boundaries of a mediocre fairy tale to bring truth and learning to accept who you are.
Shrek brings in fairy-tale characters that all of us can relate to  - from Pinochio to the Gingerbread man, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, it is a rambunctious parody and a wicked satire which has all the elements of a good fable - friendship, bigotry and love. Not to mention the spectacular 3D animation that is almost realistically done to match the actors voicing them - and the ""Matrix"" and Star Wars spoofs. Its outrageousness - and sublime creativity - may make even Disney cringe in awe of their aggressive competitor.",998092800,,1815,4.892857142857143

This is a hilarious movie, that IMO only fails at the end, by using a sitcom cliche, and by having a moral that it doesn't matter how you look as long as you can find someone as ugly as you are. Kind of insulting, I think. Still, this movie has wonderful characters, is incredibly well done, has all kind of jokes and gags, and I'm definitely going to buy the DVD.",998006400,,506,4.173469387755102
1315834,4,B00003CXXI,"Dear Reader, Shrek is sometimes gross good for the whole family, kind of movie. Funny almost all the time, and a great cast that brings good voices to the humorous characters.
The cast of shrek is Mike Myers (shrek) Cameron Diaz (Princess) John Lithgow (Prince) and the heart of the comedy in this movie Eddie Murphy (Donkey). Distributed by Dreamworks, who brought othe great animations like Prince of Egypt, and Antz.
I didn't expect this movie to be as good as everyone told me it was, but yes i was suprised. This movie gaining $250 million+ which is wonderful, this kind of gross would of been good for Titanic and any of the Star Wars (But they got more all of those films got like $350 million+ which is wonderful for them).
I went to this film with a little girl, i believe her age is 5, she loved it and i loved it, exactly i think i loved it more than her. This movie has more humor for adults than for children, which i didn't expect. Recommend for anyone looking for a good and funny time. I bet the soundtrack is good too, but i couldn't promise that.",998006400,,1064,4.351758793969849
1315835,5,B00003CXXI,"I'll be honest. The only reason I went to see this movie is because the movie I was waiting in line for, sold out four people in front of me. After recovering from that, we checked the movie times and Shrek was the only movie that fit into our schedule. We went expecting to be seated next to three year olds with their grandmothers but after laughing soda out of my nose in the first scene, I knew we had made a poor judgement call. I have never laughed out loud so many times in a movie theatere before. Besides being hilarious, the plot is actually pretty cute too, and all the fairy tale creatures living in a modern times kind of world was pretty interesting. For once, I was glad the movie I wanted to see was sold out, even though I burned my nose with soda.",998006400,2,765,4.175675675675675

Shrek is a great 3D movie. The 3D computer animation is second, only to Final Fantasy. The story is more involving than what I expected. The voices were well cast and performed. The whole film awsome. I'm sure you're aware of that or you wouldn't be reading this now. It has both adult (clean adult) and kids humor. The writers plagerized just about everyone and it was hilarious.  Okay, now for the DVD. This DVD is created as 2 parts. One disc is aimed for the kids and the format is ""full Screen"" (pan & scan) and includes 17 DVD-ROM games. The other disc is geared more for adults and is letterbox formatted. Both discs have 3 minutes of extended ending that was never scene in the theatrical release. There's 'Making Of' and 'Behind The Scenes'. It encludes 11 hours of extras. There are also running commentaries. This DVD will actually allow you to replace a charector's voice with you own with ""Sherk's Revoice Studio"" effects.

Cameron Diaz is also wonderful as the princess. A Wonderful story and the animation is outstanding. I would recommend this movie for anyone at any age.,997488000,,303,4.241379310344827

The first thing I'm going to do is to go back and try to watch the parts that I missed because I was laughing too hard the first time. I couldn't even breathe for much of this movie.
The second thing will be to go through again and get a better look at the many subtle - almost throw-away - jokes in both the dialog and the animation.
I will say that this movie is not appropriate for all kids. It gets a little gross, containing some bathroom humor and some gore (at least, talk of gore). Parents of sensitive kids may want to preview it.",997401600,,586,4.017094017094017

However, after the princess is saved, the movie just seems to drag.  Then comes the movie's moral: ""don't judge by appearances.""  It's nice and all, but it seemed to get shoved at you during every turn.  This is a movie I would show kids, but for adults it could go either way (love/hate).

Mike Myers plays Shrek and he does a wonderful job. Co starring are Eddie Murphy as the donkey and Cameron Diaz as Pricess Fiona. It starts off that Shrek has some of his land stolen and he goes to Lord Farquuad(John Lithgow)and he makes a deal with him... he gets his land back if Shrek will go on a journey and get the pricess that Farquuad wants. Shrek saves the princess but something unexpected happens.. he starts to fall in love with her, but doesn't believe she will love him back.

1315906,3,B00003CXXI,"That's what I was recently on a transatlantic flight, with ""Shrek"" the in-flight movie. While my friends had seen this movie and raved about it, it just didn't appeal to me enough to want to go see it myself. Now, buckled into my seat, I saw ""Shrek""--and was pleasantly surprised. Shrek is an ogre who finds a host of fairy tale characters deposited in his swamp. When he goes off to complain, the ruling prince cuts a deal with him: Go and rescue a princess for me to marry, and the swamp is yours. Accompanied by a talking donkey, Shrek manages to save the princess, and as so often happens with proxy marriages, the princess and this unlikely ""ambassador"" become interested in each other. A commonplace story line, really, but what puts ""Shrek"" on the map is its outstanding animation and its homage to the baby boomer generation, such as a take-off on ""The Dating Game"" in an early segment. Most tiresome feature: Too many jokes about flatulence.",996969600,,950,4.660714285714286

1315908,5,B00003CXXI,"I grumbled about going to see this movie, but I took my goddaughter and had more fun than she did I think!  I think a lot of the humor was geared more toward adults than children.  There were some things I was falling all over myself laughing at, and my goddaughter was just sitting there smiling like ""what is the joke here?"" There is a great moral ending to this movie especially in a society today when everyone has to be  size 6 and perfect.  It was just an all around good family movie.",996710400,3,491,4.191489361702128
1315909,3,B00003CXXI,"It is, of course, Dreamworks' prerogative to mock the cultural superiority of its animation rival, and the Dimco sequence here is a funny, much-needed dig at that company's Oceanic ambitions, as well as more recent celluloid excresences, such as 'Gladiator'.  I am even willing to overlook the hypocrisy of one giant globalising corporate company taking moral potshots at another.
The fact remains that, by removing all the things that made the best Disney films so potent, unforgettable markers in almost every adult's personal development (archetypal fairy-tale narratives with recognisable, but mythic characters we could identify with), and replacing them with a few superficial jokes and politically correct caricatures, 'Shrek' foregoes the resonance that might have made it memorable and important for generations to come.  It is also far too long, and not nearly as visually 'stunning' as the propaganda suggests.",996710400,,921,5.571428571428571
1315910,4,B00003CXXI,"An entertaining film with a bit of a mean streak which I, for one, appreciated.  An evil prince persecutes the fairy tale characters who inhabit his realm and it falls to an ogre named Shrek both to protect them and to rescue a princess.  It's a lot of fun to watch the familiar characters in a new context.  There's plenty of action and an uplifting message for the kids, as well as more adult humor to keep grown-ups involved as well.  The music is also used well, contributing to scenes (particularly at the beginning and end) that just made me feel happy.
Just one question: in a film whose message is supposed to be that we should look beyond appearences to appreciate the person beneath, why is it still okay to make fun of the little guy?  There were times when I expected Randy Newman's old hit ""Short People"" to appear on the soundtrack.  It wasn't enough to sour me on the film but, being verically challenged myself, I just had to wonder.",996364800,,949,4.456647398843931

I thought the laughs were few and far between myself.  I was expecting to laugh, waiting to laugh,and well, maybe, I just didn't get it.  Shrek was not bad at all, it was cute, and it had a great message in the end that was very endearing. It's a cute movie, I just don't think it was all that funny.
the gingerbread man being interrogated by the prince..DO YOU KNOW THE MUFFIN MAN? THE MUFFIN MAN? and ""YOU MONSTER!"" okay, this was very funny.  but true hiliarous films have you constantly laughing.  This was almost half way through the movie.  And the ending was very funny.

1315982,3,B00003CXXI,"There are movies I hate that I just think are aweful, and then there are movies I just don't like but can still understand how others could enjoy. Shrek would be the latter. The problem I found in Shrek is that it tried too hard to be all sorts of different things and to appeal to the broadest audience possible, instead of just building off its own creativity and imagination. Shrek had potential- there were some interesting characters and it had hints of creative writing (and the animation was great), but in my opinion it fell short of that potential. Far too many fart jokes; too many (I think almost intentional but ineffective) genre cliches; the movie took advantage of current and popular trends and fads etc far too much, taking away from its sense of creativity and originality (such as 'the Matrix scene') making the movie one that screams ""2000s"" instead of one that will age well; and I thought the movie took a dive near the end when it went for the typical Disney-esque plot and ending.
I also found the character Shrek to be rather annoying after a while, and Eddie Murphy gives a rather obnoxious performance in this movie.  But neither does much to detract from the movie.
It's not like I didn't enjoy Shrek (I'd give it 3/5 stars tops), but it just wasn't all that. Certainly didn't live up to my expectations after all the media, critical and viewer hype that surrounded it.  If you're a fan of animated movies, this is definately worth checking out.  Just don't expect a story that will stick with you your whole life.",995500800,,1542,4.6

The story has great potential but is full of lazy, dumb jokes like references to movies nobody will remember in 10 years and multiple fart jokes that the children at the theater I saw it at seemed to love. The actors do a fine job with the voice characterizations but the writing doesn't match their talent. One of the highlights of the film was when they had bits involving other fairy tale characters, particularly the Gingerbread Man interrogation. One more thing- the animation itself is rather odd and ugly looking.",995414400,,606,4.836538461538462
1315984,5,B00003CXXI,"Family movie, animation, fairytale kind figures, a bit of romance..... Disney is what comes to mind.... but it's not. This movie is all but Disney.
Sure there is romance in this story, but it is spinkled with good humor. It could be a fairy tale yes, but it is a fun fairy tale. And yes it is a family movie because whether you are a child of 3 or a grown-up of 90 this movie brings happiness into everybody's life.
The story in a nutshell: Shrek (Mike Meyers), angry because his swamp has been taken over, is sent by the evil Farquaad (John Lithgow) to get the beautifull, or is she, princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) so Farquaad can marry her.  But the ""hero"" of the story could not be a good hero if he did not have the companionship of a side kick, in this case a donkey (Eddie Murphy). Allthough companionship is perphaps a too big a word it is more a love-hate relationship is a comic kind of way. The donkey rides along with Shrek because Shrek saved the donkey's life.
One thing is for sure, the characters in this movie are all very well played by the actors both animated and voice of the ""real"" actor.
When I went to see this movie I didn't really know what to expect. I read and saw reviews on tv. It sounded like it could be a fun way to spend a saturdaynight. But I never expected it to be this fun. Everyone around me was laughing out loud at one point in the movie or another.
Knowing that DreamWorks likes to toy whit its rival I was curious how the ""disney""-like moments, as they started of, would end. They ended very well and in a very, very comic way.
If I had the power to send you to this movie I would, but I can't and so I can only say: This movie is worth every penny, dollar or what currency you might use to see it on a full sized theater screen.

 It easily qualifies as the funniest movie of its genre I've seen in a while, right there with Disney's 'The Emperor's New Groove'. Ironically enough, a large part of the fun you can have is directly tied to the parody the movie makes of classics such as 'Snow White' and 'Cinderella'. Not that it's a slight detail: it's hard not to notice it, but it is highly enjoyable.
 In addition to this, there is a very original combination of contemporary pop/rock tunes with the scenes of the movie which takes it out of the traditional fairy tale genre.
 However, the ending, I have to say, is quite predictable, which basically is the only reason I give it 4 stars. Otherwise, it's awesome!",995068800,,773,4.627737226277373

I thought it was really great that they didn't make it those movies where the people don't have to be good looking like other movies. It has a nice turn at the end of the movie that suprises me. It is a whole new twist of a fairy tale. My favorite character was Donkey. (voice by Eddie Murphy DR.DOLITTLE 2) He was a funny character with really funny lines. Princess Fiona (voice by Cameron Diaz CHARLIES ANGELS) is a not so very typical, but in a way typical princess. She is like a karate queen! She has a big secret she can't tell anyone because it embarreses her. Lord Farquadd (voice by John Lithgow 3RD ROCK FROM THE SUN) plays the very small greedy king who is dying to be king one day. The way he cane become one is by marrying a princess. That's when he asks his magic mirror to tell him about princesses. Then the mirror gives him choices and he picks of course Princess Fiona. Shrek(voice by Mike Myers AUSTIN POWERS: THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME) was of course the main character. He was a very grumpy ogre who didn't have any friends.

Those with a very delicate temprament, allergic to bathroom humor, should probably stay at home, and people of less than average stature might be offended at one of the characterisations; but otherwise it is a terrific family film, which will appeal to children of all ages and adults alike.  The story is clever, with a plot twist at the end that your kids will be proud they figured out ahead of time.  The snappy dialogue is full of laughs, but with some important points to make, too; and unlike Disney's Hunchback of Notre Dame, the ugly monster gets the girl!  Mike Myers is actually subdued in the title role.  Eddie Murphy steals the show as Donkey, Shrek's sidekick, essentially reprising his role as the dragon in Mulan.  The animation is truly wonderful, but Final Fantasy really steals Shrek's thunder as the animation miracle of the summer of 2001.",995068800,3,1027,4.806818181818182

Little did I expect to be as entertained as she was.  SHREK is the best of both worlds: a movie the kids can understand and like while being just right for the parents to enjoy as well.  While seeing the film I was reminded of all the fairy tales I had read as a child.  I was relieved that Eddie Murphy's voice portrayal of the donkey character was good as I had heard.  The young lady in the film is both personable and fun to watch.  SHREK is the kind of creature you would like to see your daughter come home with.  The ending is both fun and unexpected.

The graphics are great, all the background details including the sunflowers, Shrek's house, the castles and other fields are greatly depicted.
The dialogs are funny and eventough Shrek would be considered at first sight like an anti-hero ( he's green, has a big belly and not polite at all) he turns out to be envolving and you just wish everything will be fine for him.
No wonder this movie was a threat to Disney legacy, it brought a new dimension for animation. Specially by not including those boring songs in the middle of the scenes and definetly it is a movie for Children and Adults to watch and laugh together.",994377600,,783,4.36986301369863

1316118,5,B00003CXXI,"The movie industry has flooded us with sexist fairy tales for far too long. There are too many perfectly beautiful damsels in distress, awaiting their chilvarous knights to come rescue them. From Rapunzel to Ariel, from Cinderella to Sleeping Beauty, these characters have appeared on movie screens and personal TV sets. It's enough to make feminists (I am the Feminism Host at Bella Online) and those with like-minded values cry out ""Enough already! Give our daughters real heroines, good messages, and more brains than beauty.""
And, voila! Finally the movie industry has answered us: with the cartoon called Shrek.
Most movie-goers are drawn to the cartoon because of its famous cast of characters, including Mike Myers as the voice of Shrek, Caremon Diaz as the voice of the Princess, Eddie Murphy as the voice of the donkey, and John Lithgow as the voice of the Prince.
Once movie-goers arrive at the theatre, or home viewers pop in the DVD or VHS, however, they will be surprised to find that Shrek also has many other refreshingly unique qualities. It is funny on many different levels, so that both children and adults keep laughing the whole way through. The animation is superb and the soundtrack consists of diverse, fun songs. The plot is fast-paced, and... best of all, the message is excellent.
Shrek teaches children - and reminds adult viewers - that beauty comes from within, and that real friends value strong inside qualities instead of superficial outside ones.
Perhaps the strongest feminist message in the movie comes at its most humanistic part. Shrek sees the princess in her natural state, and she's confused because the one who cast a spell on her told her it would be reversed when she found true love. ""But... I was supposed to be beautiful,"" she says. Shrek's reply- ""You are beautiful,"" captures the movie's entire message in three simple but powerful words.
Shrek is a refreshing change to the familiar fairy tale movies. It will restore your faith in the children's movie industry, and allow you to feel confident that you can reinforce feminist values while taking your children - or just yourself - to see it.",994032000,,2142,4.919889502762431
1316119,5,B00003CXXI,"In this film the title character Shrek (voiced by Mike Myers) is a big, green, ugly ogre who lives alone in a swamp. When Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow) overruns his swamp with famous fairy tale characters he goes off on a quest with a wisecracking donkey (Eddie Murphy) to rescue the kidnapped Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) from a fire-breathing dragon, and (you guessed it) falls in love with her on the way home.
The plot of this film is like a normal fairy tale turned upside-down - as  well as being quite sweet  it contains some very funny jokes (there are some digs at the Disney studio, and a great sequence which spoofs ""The Matrix""). A special mention must also go to the computer animation, which looks phenomenal.
Despite what some people may say, this is not just a movie for young children, as a number of the references to other movies and some of the humor (which can be rather lewd) will fly right over their heads. This film will entertain both adults and children though, as it works on two levels - the charming story is in its` own way a fairy tale, while also being a parody of more traditional fairy tale movies, poking fun at established characters. (There is a surprising twist at the end, but I won`t spoil it for you).
Overall, I think this is an excellent movie - a cute plot combined with some great humor proves that cartoons aren`t only for kids. Superb.",994032000,12,1383,4.50597609561753

1316122,5,B00003CXXI,"This is one of the best movies I have seen in ages.  It is rare treat finding a movie that is both as entertaining and intelligent as this one.  There is some potty humour, especially during the opening credits, but this is only a small part of the movie.  The rest of the movie is a wonderful satire of fairy tales, twisting around such common notions as ugly = evil and beautiful = good, and pokes fun at the capitalist power-driven nature of the Disney empire and at Michael Eisner and his shortcomings (Katzenberg getting revenge?).
Shrek's life of solitude is disrupted when the local tyrant decides to evict all fairy-tale characters from his kingdom, sending them to live in the swamp.  In order to get back his privacy, Shrek makes a deal with the tyrant to retrieve a bride. Joining him on his quest is a talking mule voiced by Eddie Murphy who is, to my pleasant surprise, actually very amusing.  And the princess is not a typical ""damsel in distress"".  All of the voice talents pull off a wonderful job, and the computer animation is some of the best I've ever seen.  They even pull of the most difficult task of portraying facial expressions in such a realistic manner that you can really make out distinctive emotions.
This film strongly appeals to an adult audience.  And unlike most recent Disney films, there isn't a surplus of musical scenes that become sickening after a while.  On the other hand, some younger viewers may find scenes, e.g., of Shrek eating eyeballs disturbing, but the strength of a child's stomach is usually underappreciated by adults who have forgotten what childhood is like (come on, I bet you sang the songs about Gopher Guts and old women swallowing flies and spiders when you were a kid too).

It's packed with laughs that would even entertain, not only a child, but an adult! It's a spoof on almost every fairytale, filled with the Gingerbread Man, Snow White an even the three blind mice!!! The only part you have to watch out for, is Eddie Murphy, playing the donkey. He's fast, and has a big mouth, that might irritate you at times, or make your crack a large smile.

1316180,5,B00003CXXI,"Have you ever read the book Shrek by William Steig? This fantastic movie is about his delightfully fractured fairy tale. This movie is the right stuff for this computer-animated adaptation full of verve and wit. Shrek, The Ogre (voiced by Mike Myers) is an agreeable enough ogre who wants to live his days in peace. But when the mean, and evil Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow) evicts local fairy-tale creatures (including the Seven Dwarfs, Pinocchio, and the Gingerbread Man),from there own home, they settle in Shrek's swamp and Shrek wants answers from Farquaad. A quest of freedom starts for Shrek and his new buddy, a talking donkey, who was one of the creatures evicted ( voiced by Eddie Murphy), where battles have to be won and a princess(voiced by Cameron Diaz) must be rescued from a dragon lair. The story is stronger than most animated fare, but it's the humor that makes Shrek a winner.  Shrek is never as warm and inspired as both Toy Story films, but the perfect realistic computer animation and an pretty good soundtrack (Smash Mouth, Baha Men) keep the entertainment in fine form. Know I know what you are thinking, ""It has to be a famous Disney movie!"" But it's not. It's is prouduced by DreamWorks, who does a spectacular job.",993340800,6,1240,4.767441860465116

Besides the catchy pop soundtrack, many other scripted fairy-tale rules are thrown out the tower.  Shrek the ogre isn't your conventional knght in shining armor- he didn't even want to be. But to make the short, not-so-intimidating villain Lord Farquaad get the fairy-tale animals off his property, he has to rescue the rather typical fairy tale princess Fiona from a tower guarded by a dragon and bring her back to Farquaad.  His donkey sidekick, hilariously played by Eddie Murphy, tags along with Shrek.  The trip back to the castle makes for many comical adventures.  But a fat ugly ogre couldn't possibly get together with a beautiful perfect princess...or maybe...

This movie will be liked by anybody who has a funnybone..well, if he or she doesn't, I think they will be forced to let loose a chuckle here and a smile there. About the characters, Mike Myers is believable as a Ogre's voice. John Lithgow as Prince Farquaad gives animated villainy a new dimension. Cameron Diaz as Princess Fiona's voice shows the spirit of the character so well that you might believe her to be a 21st century career woman.
Coming to the most delightful character in the movie. The donkey ! Eddie Murphy has us laughing like jackasses with his witty one liners and retorts. After seeing this donkey, if you happen to see a real one, you might just be tempted to talk to it. Not that the movie needs any support to stand on its feet,but the donkey will bowl you over if nothing else does(which, again, is very highly improbable).

The casting is excellent.  Mike Meyers is hysterical as Shrek, a great choice IMO.  And Eddie Murphy plays his most likeable character since ""Coming To America"".  John Lithgow, however, steals the show when he's onscreen -- for such a tall man in real life he portrays the Napolean little-man complex perfectly.
As for the animation, it's mind-blowing.  Although possibly the best compliment I can give this movie is this: I barely NOTICED the animation for most of the film -- I was laughing too hard!  But in a few of the quieter scenes I made a point to check out the details, and the animation is truly amazing.  But the best part is the facial detail; the voice talent need to give the animators a big THANK YOU for bringing such expressiveness to these characters' faces.
Overall this was the most fun I've had in a theater in a long time.  Go see it, and when it comes out on DVD, buy it! :)",992822400,,1116,4.512437810945274
1316231,5,B00003CXXI,"Dreamworks has finally found their way to the world of animation. Their past animations are far from good, but Shrek would definitely be a breakthrough for them.
The computer graphics were drawn in detail (you could even see the finger prints!), and the backgrounds are spectacular. Although at certain places, you could still feel the characters moving like line-drawn puppets, but in terms of facial expressions and movements, Dreamworks had really paid a very good effort in it.
Nonetheless, the main selling point should not be just on the graphics for the story is hilarious. You would never be able to imagine how innovative the directors could be on simple and ordinary fairy tale characters. You can see all the classical fairy tale characters in the movie, and even more. The main role - Shrek, who was an Ogre was disgustingly funny. You could not accept some of his behaviours or ""abilities"", but they would really give you a good laugh in the theatre. The talking donkey was also fabulous. It is as talkative and nagging as Jar Jar Bink in the Phantom Menance, but it is 200% funnier than Jar Jar Bink. This is probably due to the fact that this kind of characher is more suitable to be in a crazy animation instead of a serious SF movie. Eddy Murphy's voice dubbing really made the donkey alive. Princess Fiona is basically a Final Fantasy version of Cameron Diaz with Charlie's Angel's capability and character. Watch out for her cool moves. You could feel Cameron Diaz's superb performance in animated format.
However, despite the 5 star cast and computer graphics, Shrek might not be the best choice for kids. Not only that some gags are tailored for adults (not in terms of sex or violence, but comprehension ability), but also if the kids really act like Shrek after finishing the moive, parents would hope that they have never taken their kids to the theatre.",992736000,,1878,4.781538461538462
1316232,4,B00003CXXI,"I will admit I was hoping to get a bit more out of Shrek than I did. I noticed all the great reviews and the fantastic trailer and the idea of spoofing all the Disney movies if fabulous. But, since most of the gags were included in the trailer the funny scenes simply left a smile on your face instead of a roar of a laugh and sometimes this movie simply tried too hard to be Toy Story. But, it was none-the-less a very good watch with fantastically developed characters and a storyline that actually works. There is a plot in this movie, which is more than can be said for some recent animated films. But, sometimes the movie can be a little bit boring and carries on when it thinks too highly of itself. Still, Shrek is clever animated entertainment with good adult humour and children will enjoy it too.",992649600,,806,4.344370860927152

There are some parts that small kids may not like if they scare easily (the dragon and its castle could be scary).  Eddie Murphy makes the movie.  Without him the second half of the movie wouldn't be very etertaining, but because he is there it is very enjoyable.  I would recommend that you see this movie.",992649600,,579,4.572815533980583

I don't think they could have cast a better group of actors for the voices then they did. Eddie Murphy brings in a lot of comic relief to Donkey, John Lithgow adds the right amount of lordly overtone to Lord Farquaad, a pint sized man wanting the perfect kingdom, and Mike Meyers and Cameron Diaz give depth to Shrek and Princess Fiona.
The references to other movies are humorous and well done, and the animation is outstanding.  In some places the scenery looks almost real, and all the characters move like real people and animals would move. This is one of the few movies I can say I really loved, and if I had the time, I would see it many more times.

1316275,5,B00003CXXI,"""Shrek"" opens with the usual fairy tale movie beginning but quickly becomes a laugh riot that is tame enough for kids but has enough adult material to satisfy the adults. The story begins with Shrek(voiced by Mike Myers), an extremely large ogre who is feared and hated by the people. He is fine with his normal life of living in a swamp and being alone until Donkey(voiced by Eddie Murphy); a runaway donkey literally runs into him. Shrek's peaceful swamp becomes overrun with fairy tale creatures(most of which are from Disney films) and therefore he must go to save the fair Princess Fiona(voiced by Cameron Diaz) from her castle for the short Lord Farquaad(voiced by John Lithgow) to get his swamp back. With Lord Farquaad's short stature and his mean attitude, it seams that he is a mix of both Michael Eisner and Jeffery Katzenberg. Furthermore, it seems that the use of Disney characters in the movie are pokes at the dispute between Katzenberg and Disney. This movie has been so long in the making that Chris Farley was originally intended to voice the role of Shrek but with his passing Mike Myers took the role and did a great job. His voice closely resembles the Scottish voiced character of Fat Bastard in ""Auston Powers the Spy who Shagged Me"".  This film is not the usual fairy tale by any means. Princess Fiona tries to be the princess that you would read about in stories but she is not the average princess. From kung fu to singing at a pitch so high that a bird blows up, her character gets many laughs. As for Eddie Murphy; he supplies a great majority of humor with his straight talking Donkey that is both honest and heartfelt. ""Shrek"" is not a normal fairy tale nor is it a normal film"".

1316281,5,B00003CXXI,"SHREK is one of those rare animated films that really DOES have something for all ages, be it slapstick humor to a rather satiric look at fairy tales and how commercialism has made them too ""cutesy"" in today's PC age.  This film, of course, tells the tale of a big, green ogre who sets out to rescue a Princess in order to regain his home, which has been overrun by the likes of 3 blind mice, 7 dwarves and a girl in a glass coffin, and a cross-dressing wolf, among other fairy-tale types.  Mike Myers is solid as the Scots-speaking hero, while Eddie Murphy hams it up as his talking-donkey of a sidekick.  Cameron Diaz and John Lithgow also add solid characters with their voice work.  The computer animation is nothing short of astounding, and the film has just enough heart to keep it from being totally overrun from its skewed view of the world.

I went in expecting to miss a lot visually, since I really liked the trailers, and particularly the Eddie Murphy lines. I wasn't disappointed. He really ties things together.
The allusions to other movies were phenominal. There's so much going on in just the Robin Hood scene - Riverdance, the Matrix, West Side Story.
On to the animation - artistry and technology collide with brilliance! The details - hair blowing in the breeze. This is a movie which needs to be seen several times to be fully appreciated. I'm looking forward to it being available on DVD. I'll probably watch it with the sound muted, just to gain a better appreciation for the visuals.",991872000,,769,4.62043795620438

A Bug's Life is incredible!  But, SHREK is the BEST one yet (in my humble opinion).  If you think it looks silly or ridiculous, or if you just don't like Mike Meyers or Eddie Murphy, PLEASE, I beg of you, DON'T let that keep you from seeing this masterpiece from a truly innovative studio - DREAMWORKS.

Mike Myers plays an adorable ogre with a friendly side-kick, Eddie Murphy as the talking, and most of the time, obnoxious donkey.  Murphy's role is spectacular!  The comedy in the film is, at times, over the heads of the younger audience but they will still laugh right along with the adults because the humor keeps rolling.  The only draw back to the film is the use of foul language and the movie would have been just as powerful without the obscenities.  Cameron Diaz plays the princess who is rescued from a dragon lair by the ogre and donkey.  Her performance is just plain cute.  The movie has a strong story-line, the animation is excellent, and the characters are played beautifully.  You won't walk away from this film disappointed!",991872000,,834,4.743055555555555
1316333,5,B00003CXXI,"For a studio that has so much creative power at its command, Dreamworks has managed to really fall flat with animation. Think about it: Antz, Prince of Egypt - not titles to inspire a strong repsonse from anyone except biblical scholars and Woody Allen fans.
Shrek is a complete success - the animation is really well-executed and technically great, but FINALLY they got a script with originality and given energy by an excellent voice talent cast. Eddie Murphy is of course excellent as the comedic foil Donkey, and Cameron Dias plays an excellent Princess Cameron Dias (not her name in the movie, but who else could she play?) - and Mike Myers is excellent and restrained as the grumpy ogre who just wants everyone to get out of his swamp.
Everyone in the theater got some great laughs - parents and kids alike. When you weren't laughing at Donkey, you could enjoy a good round of Disney-bashing written into the script. Like Antz, the humor borders on a string of pop-culture references, but the jokes are more varied and numerous - by the end of the film you've had a great time. There's a couple of ""damn's"" and one ""crap"" in there, but for the most part it's pretty clean.

1316334,2,B00003CXXI,"Shrek is the newest animated film from Dreamworks Pictures and PDI animation studio.  It stars the voices of Mike Myers, Cameron Diaz, Eddie Murphy, and John Lithgow.  Mike Myers is the voice of the ogre misanthrope, Shrek.  He is content living alone in his swamp until his home is invaded by a horde of fairytale  creatures that have been evicted by the evil would be king, Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow.)  Shrek makes an agreement with Lord Farquaad to go and rescue Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) from a dragon so Farquaad can marry her and become a real king.  Exactly why he has evicted the fairytale creatures is not clear.  Apparently they have made his kingdom somewhat imperfect so his remedy was to cast them out.  It really doesn't make any logical sense.  One of the fairytale creatures is a talking donkey (Eddie Murphy) that escapes his owner and befriends Shrek. The Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) fights with super-human ability at one point.  How, why, there is no explanation. It seem like it's just an excuse to throw in a lame Matrix joke that might have played better two years ago.  The film is full of anachronisms such as recent pop music tunes and numerous references to TV with applause and laugh signs.  Donkey refers to contemporary things like Tic-Tacs for Shrek's bad breath.  There are turnstiles and an abandoned Disney-esque theme park.  Shrek is entirely derivative of every other classic fairytale and I believe the filmmakers attempted to use this to create an original twist on the classic fairytale but it doesn't work here.  Shrek is full of shallow characters that are just thrown in for no other purpose than a cheap laugh.  Robin Hood and his  merry men make an appearance and he's French.  Since when was Robin Hood a Frenchman?  He's English.  What gives?!  They've put in nearly every public domain, royalty free fairytale character into this movie which makes for a twisted amalgam of a story with very little focus. Its attempts to satirize some of Disney's classics like Pinocchio, Cinderella, and Sleeping Beauty.  By doing so it only succeeds in illustrating how far superior the characters and story telling are in Disney's animated features.
The crux of Shrek's story is don't judge people by there looks.  This is a fine moral to impart to youngsters but the characters in the film make fun of  Lord Farquaad  height every chance they get.  Looks aren't important but height is an appropriate target for ridicule in this film.
For a film that was three years in the making, given the time, effort, and money that was dedicated to it, there should have been more effort paid toward the ill conceived badly structured story that's filled with hollow filler.  It's beautifully animated and rendered.  The scenic environments and main characters are great to look at but this is one of the few redeeming qualities that keeps the movie from getting an even lower score that I'm going it give it.  Perhaps if you're a youngster you'll find this film more enjoyable that I did.  Some may find themselves mesmerized by the beautifully animated and rendered scenes, I was not.
Disney's Toy Story 1 and 2 kick butt all over Shrek, which is nearly dreck.  Don't go!",991785600,7,3204,4.813186813186813
1316335,5,B00003CXXI,"I loved it. This is a movie that is not only made for kids, but has jokes put in for the adults also! It is one of my favorite movies ever! I can't wait till it comes out on DVD!",991699200,,178,3.475
1316336,5,B00003CXXI,"This is a funny, funny movie.  You should definitely go see it, but be aware that it has a satirical edge that makes it more like ""Wayne's World"" than ""Snow White"".
One thing I wanted to point out that I forgot to mention earlier (May 20) was that what makes this movie as good as it is, is the quality of the comedic acting (or at least voice-overs) by Mike Myers and John Lithgow particularly.
For those of you who are recent fans of Mike Myers (post ""Wayne's World"" and ""Austin Powers""), you should definitely check out ""So I Married an Axe-Murderer"".  This is the movie where Myers worked out the kinks on his ""misanthropic Scotsman"" character, with hilarious effect: I saw SIMAM over seven years ago and I still grin whenever I recall Myers' character singing Rod Stewart and Bay City Rollers songs.
Lithgow is possibly one of the most under-utilized comedians working today.  His role as John Whorfin in ""The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai"" deserves to be on the comedians' wall of fame.  With the tragic death of Phil Hartman, perhaps Lithgow will get more of the exposure he truly merits. Like Myers, Hartman, Lily Tomlin, Al Franken and Jack Black (""High Fidelity""), Lithgow is a thinking comedian.  While they will never get as much popular attention as morons like Adam Sandler (somebody hand me a seal club) their work will ultimately be remembered alongside that of comedy greats such as Carey Grant and Buster Keaton.
Eddie Murphy did well in this movie too but this was not one of his truly stellar performances. This is in part because his humor is really an extension of his stand-up work. For all his undoubted talents, Murphy is not good at sharing the spotlight.  Certainly Donkey was a good fit for Murphy but it's nothing like the sparks he generates when he has center stage but also has a rein on his ego (""Beverly Hills Cop 1"", ""Nutty Professor"", ""Dr. Dolittle"").  Personally, I think Cedric the Entertainer and Steve Harvey (""The Original Kings of Comedy"") are much funnier performers and team players. However, their humor is more old-school than Murphy's.
Murphy is also not well-served by the script this time, a similar fate to that which regularly befalls the hilariously funny Chris Rock.  (If you want to see Rock at his best, watch his comedy show on cable.  A small hint of his talent can be found in ""Nurse Betty"" where he is outstanding.  However, do NOT treat his performance in ""Dogma"" as a good indication of what he can do)
The sleeper find here is Cameron Diaz, hopefully she will get to do more than be ""the girl"" in her future work (Fiona had more than a little of other Diaz characters in ""There's Something About Mary"" and ""The Mask"" about her).  But check her out in ""Being John Malkovich"" a very funny (though ultimately rather dark)art-house movie.
Go see Shrek, and then go rent the other movies these fine actors have done.  This movie is a good example of what can be done with a reasonably funny (with the exception of Donkey) script and great comedic talent.",991699200,,3011,4.671077504725898
1316337,4,B00003CXXI,"""Shrek"" will appeal to both children and adults for many (different) reasons. Children will adore it for the plot and the characters, as well as for the animation. Adults will enjoy it for artistic and thematic merits, which are voiced by the finest drmatic and comedic actors of our time. John Lithgow (and perhaps) Cameron Diaz provide rather scintillating performances with their somewhat ""Olde English"" dialogue translations, especially Lithgow, whom I presume has had many years of theatrical studies applied to his acting resume. Mike Myers utilizes a portion of his comedic talents while verbalizing a nifty Gaelic accent to his character ""Shrek"", as opposed to Myers' rather banal, square British dialect for his ""Austin Powers"" character. Eddie Murphy's vocal stylings are, well, Eddie Murphy's. His vocal characterizations, although somewhat overplayed and overreptitious here, add a spicy and unique comedic element all their own. As far as the animated artwork is concerned, it is in a class all by itself, complete with its worldly, English countryside nuances and themes. There's one small detail, though. The animated movements of certain characters lack some depth, in that some movements seem forced and herky-jerky, creating a slow motion, fast-forward type atmosphere. Credit must be given where credit is due, since these animated features are not all that easy to make, and everything must fall into place exactly. Upon the initial viewing of ""Shrek"", one will easily notice this feature was filmed with great artistic vision and expression, thus containing an element many of the claymation features are missing (a la ""Chicken Run"" - a Claymation monstrosity in itself, although the Claymation stylings of ""The California Raisins"" are worth their weight in gold), and that element is a form of ""objet d'art"".In discussing the entertainment value of ""Shrek"", as was previously mentioned, both kids and adults will truly find various elements of this artistic jewel to appreciate. Plus, the kids will come out of watching ""Shrek"" learning a valuable life lesson, which they'll have to see and hear for themselves. But, to truly appreciate all the glorious wonder of ""Shrek"", you'll just have to view it for yourself. You can bet the video stores will have a hard time keeping this one on the shelves!",991612800,2,2320,5.256064690026954
1316338,5,B00003CXXI,"To me, it seems that people are overstating how much tweaking Disney's taking in ""Shrek."" Unless I missed something, fairy tales didn't begin with the House That Walt Built, and that's what ""Shrek"" spends most of its time chipping away at. (Of course, there's also a very funny riff on Disneyland when Shrek arrives to see Lord Farquar, but that's really it for pure Disney-bashing.)
Adults who might think that they've seen all the funny fairy tales they can handle should think again: While there's enough fart jokes, talking animals and slapstick to keep the kids entertained, ""Shrek"" is an adult movie, with low key racy jokes (kids who even notice the ""big castle compensating for Lord Farquar's deficiencies"" gag will likely assume it's talking about his height, or lack thereof), some very (post-)modern looks at fairy tales (Cinderella's described as being emotionally abused ... well, that sounds about right) and the nerve to say that the princess/Prince Charming fantasy so many fairy tales were built around is garbage.
Sure, anyone who's ever seen a major motion picture can guess that it ends up with ""They All Lived Happily Ever After,"" but any movie that starts off with an ogre using a book of classic fairy tales as toilet paper is going to get there in its own backhanded style. Surprisingly, ""Shrek"" steers around the pitfalls and never becomes cloying or trite or gives up on its own cockeyed realist view of fairy tales and destructive fantasies (as opposed to the perfectly fine and rather sweet, in their own dim way, fairy tale creatures endangered by the evil pro-rationality and pro-order lord).
While it's the writing that really makes ""Shrek"" work, John Lithgow and Eddie Murphy fling themselves into their roles, making what could have been fairly generic animated characters into memorable performances. Murphy in particular seems freed to do his best work when he's hidden from view as in ""Mulan,"" and Lithgow, whom many now only know through his goofy ""Third Rock from the Sun"" role, gets to stretch out his more threatening riffs, as he used to prior to landing on the sitcom.
""Shrek"" is that rarest of summer animated movies: One that's genuinely fun for the whole family. See it with or without kids, but see it.",991612800,5,2248,4.918421052631579
1316339,5,B00003CXXI,"I'm a teen, and being a big Eddie Murphy fan, I suggested to my parents that we see this movie with my two younger brothers, and we were FAR from disappointed!  Aside from the great cast and beautiful animation, the most fun was seeking out the next joke, most of which were made to make fun of Disney, which no one has really attempted to do so much.  From such things as Main Street Disneyland to It's a Small World to the end where it was a flat out copy of the scene in Disney's ""Beauty and the Beast"" where Beast is lifted in the air and has beams of light coming from every appendage.  Some may not notice a few of the other copies, like flying through the air on a dragon (that SO reminded me of ""A Never Ending Story"").  It was a great film, and we can't get my four year old brother to stop saying, ""We can stay up late, and in the morning, I can make you WAFFLES!""",991612800,,874,4.034682080924855
1316387,3,B00003CXXI,"The animation I adore presents us with the vision of a world that is unaware of the viewer's presence. Princess Mononoke, The Iron Giant, The Nightmare Before Christmas. They let you watch, quite uncaringly, absorbed in the drama. And they can afford that attitude.
Shrek is very different. The movie looks at you all the time  and winks. And winks... Very soon these incessant winks develop into the nervous twitch.
The plot is minimal. I know we do not have to apply the logic and common sense to a fairy tale but still I wonder how come the evil prince rounds up the fairy tale creatures for deportation - in order not to see them any more - and then tortures the Gingerbread Man to learn their whereabouts.  It's just one of the episodes where the screenwriters show they did a really sloppy job. There are more.
Some of the jokes are mildly disgusting. I have no reason to be offended personally by the sickly puns on the prince's...hm... diminitiveness - I am 195 cm tall, and the main point is not that there is a lot of people out there who are not happy with such taunting. More important is that the height jokes show the gaps in taste and reason of the film's creators. The prince is a bad guy not because he does not qualify for NBA. That's not the reason to see him as evil. In fact, the short man eager to marry a beauty is not as revolting as the film tries to show.  And in the real life these untall guys succeed in the task very often!
The visuals are eerily unsettling. The colors look they were not intended for a human eye. The figures' moves are wooden. The knights look like dummies in a dully shining armour. I like puppet animation - especially, Czech - and the clayanimation of Wallace & Gromit creators. These computer-generated dummies are something else. Here I had an impression I am looking at these crappy 3D monitor wallpapers came alive - the weird textures, the rigid figures of outlandish creatures, the  nerdish fantasy scenery.
This time DreamWorks came up with the most annoying sidekick in the recent animation history. When Eddie Murphy lent his voice to Disney - in Mulan - the result was much more tasteful and still hilarious. Yes, we are told the Donkey can drive anyone crazy with his frenetic banter but do we really need a proof SO convincing?
The studio makes the point of showing us they are different from Disney. In that case it doesn't mean they are better.",991612800,,2410,4.508009153318078
1316388,3,B00003CXXI,"While I can certainly agree with everyone that ""Shrek"" is a good movie, especially given the dearth of even acceptable movies recently, the movie doesn't really transcend the fairy tale boundaries that it claims to, and ultimately falls short of its lofty goals.  On the one hand, Shrek is indeed funny, and chock-full of pop culture references and jokes that will have you laughing out loud.  Eddie Murphy as the Donkey is especially entertaining, although the entire cast is strong as well.  But on the other hand, the movie's plot is itself a formula overlaid with enough distractions that its creators hope you won't notice.  Although it attempts to spoof the traditional rescue-the-princess plotline with an unconventional antihero and non-traditional heroine, the moral -- don't judge a book by it's cover -- is frankly a little trite and overdone at this point.  And unfortunately, the moral isn't even consistent: the king Farquaad is continuously made fun of for his short stature, which is curiously at odds with the movie's intended purpose.  Coupled with an unfortunate tendency to substitute bathroom humor and double entendres for true wit, Shrek is by no means a bad movie, but not a great one either.",991526400,,1216,5.055
1316389,4,B00003CXXI,"A fractured fairy tale if there ever was one, ""Shrek,"" directed by Andrew Adamson and Vicky Jenson, is a highly imaginative, animated comedy that has something in it for everyone.  It's funny, witty, at times gross, while at other times, poignant.  And there's plenty of humor for children of all ages, while the adult humor (with which it's loaded) is for the most part implied, so parents can rest easy sitting next to their eight-or-ten-year-old sons or daughters; there's nothing in this film that's going to cause any embarrassing moments, and the only question you're likely to hear when it's over is, ""Can we see it again?""
 When the local Monarch, Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow) decrees that his kingdom must be rid of all fairy tale creatures, he has them rounded up and deposited across the line, as it were, into a swamp that just happens to belong to a big green Ogre named Shrek (Mike Myers).  Much to his chagrin, as he happens to value his privacy above all else, Shrek soon finds himself bedeviled by a talking donkey (Eddie Murphy), as well as having his sensibilities assaulted by the hordes of fairy tale squatters who don't have a clue as to what to do next.  Quickly Shrek sees no recourse but to go to Farquaad himself and settle the matter without further ado.  And when they meet, the diminutive Farquaad strikes a bargain with Shrek; it seems that in order to become a real King, Farquaad must marry a Princess.  But his chosen one, Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz), is currently being held captive in the highest tower of a castle guarded by a fierce dragon who has slain all that have attempted to rescue her.  If Shrek can successfully effect her release, Farquaad promises to restore his swamp and rid Shrek of the pesky fairy tale creatures encamped there.  The fearless Shrek agrees, and with the donkey in tow, sets off on his quest.
 Besides the humor, the wide appeal of this movie is due in part to the many clever references to other movies, stories and cultural icons it incorporates so well into the story.  There's the fairy tale's themselves, of course, like ""Snow White,"" ""Pinocchio"" and ""Cinderella;"" and movies like ""The Matrix,"" as well as the cultural phenomenon of ""Riverdance.""  There's a scene that fans of professional wrestling will get a hoot out of, and the scene involving Princess Fiona and Robin Hood and his dancing band of Merry Men is beyond hilarious.  There is some bathroom humor, as well, but it's fairly brief and inoffensive-- miles away from anything remotely resembling what you'd expect to find in the latest Jim Carrey movie.
 The actors supplying the voices do a great job, especially Mike Myers who brings Shrek so vividly to life, complete with a Scottish accent.  Murphy has some great lines as the donkey and makes the most of them, and Cameron Diaz as Princess Fiona is perfect, as is Lithgow as Lord Farquaad.  Other notable voices are supplied by Vincent Cassel (Monsieur Hood), Kathleen Freeman (The Old Woman) and Conrad Vernon (Gingerbread Man).  The use of music in this film is exceptional, also.  A number of familiar, popular songs are integrated into the story and the action to great effect throughout, and repeatedly, the filmmakers seemed to have an innate sense of knowing just the right song to plug into any particular moment or scene.  As with virtually everything else about this movie, it all came together beautifully.  In the final analysis, ""Shrek"" is an innovative, entertaining movie for the whole family that is guaranteed to keep you laughing and smiling for a lot longer than the 89 minutes it's on the screen.  This one's going to have you chuckling for the rest of the day-- and beyond.  And it all comes down to one thing.  It's the magic of the movies.",991526400,,3752,4.756172839506172
1316390,5,B00003CXXI,"With SHREK, Dreamworks has more than upped the ante for Disney's faltering animation arm -- this movie will blow everyone away, kids, their parents, and their grandparents.  Defying every cliche, and somehow still retaining the sweetness and goodness all good fables should have, Shrek is simply enchanting.  The computer animation looks wonderful, and must be seen on a big screen -- each created character comes to dazzling life.  The story, which involved a disgruntled ogre, a tiny Lord, a donkey who talks, and a princess in need of rescue, takes more than a few knowing jabs at Disney characters/lore we have all come to know and love, and will surprise even the most sophisticated viewers.  And kids will love the adventure of it all (though there are some truly frightening moments in the Dragon's Castle, for those younger, more impressionable tots).  The voices, most notably the hilarious. laugh-out-loud Eddie Murphy as the Donkey, are wondrous, and are matched second-by-second through their cleverly conceived animation.  This movie has more truly funny comic bits than any other release out there; the use an eclectic mix of well-known pop music only adds to the charm and fun.

1316394,4,B00003CXXI,"I don't think there's a 10 second period that goes by without a joke. It is literally packed with comedy. None of it is bad, most is a amusing and a good portion is down right hilarious.
The gist of the movie: Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow) is rounding up fairy tale creatures (When Geppetto turns in Pinocchio, he gets ""10 shillings for the possessed toy!"") and because they can't coerce Shrek the ogre out of his swamp, they put all of the fairy tale creatures there. Shrek isn't all that happy about it, so raises a stink (literally and figuratively). Lord Farquad makes a deal to clear out Shrek's swamp if Shrek rescues a damsel in distress for him.
My favorite: Lord Farquaad (the voice of John Lithgow is perfect for th part) is interrogating The Gingerbread Man (how'd he catch him anyway?) by dipping his legs in milk. The Gingerbread Man, gets tough during the torture and spits out, ""Eat me!"".
The movie was definitely made for both adults and children. Almost all of the jokes have an adult slant on them, but there are so many quirky, cute characters that the kids are sure to be entertained. Eddie Murphy as ""The donkey"" was, like John Lithgow, perfectly cast. The donkey almost looks like Eddie Murphy, which makes it that much funnier.
The movie can't really dissapoint unless you're somehow opposed to funny AND cute.",991353600,,1332,4.648305084745763

The beauty is a captive in the tower, held by a dragon who we find out also needs love. The beauty has more going on as we see when she goes into action, which is quite a surprise, who knew she had that in her? The donkey is adorable and I think every animated movie needs one character written especially for Eddie Murphy! I'm sure I need to watch this several times to catch on to all the subtle innuendoes, etc. Shrek is animated to the max and the animators outdid themselves on this one by completely capturing all of Mike Myer's facial expressions! How could they do that? Awesome! So I think this fable tells an important story, that we all have more inside to share and once you get to know someone that is the beauty that captures our attention as we get to know someone. That sometimes even dragons just need to be loved and occasionally we all make a donkey of ourselves.(smile) What a surprise ending!

The animation is done quite well and the individual performances were all rather humerous.  (Although I think basically Eddie Murphy played Eddie Murphy rather than a talking donkey no matter eddie Murphy as himself is pretty funny.)  The plot was kind a very basic fairy tale with the basic fairy tale ending (with a tiny twist).  The kids will laugh and the grownups (who this movie is really for.) will smile at the inside jokes.  John Lithgow doing ""The Muffin Man"" is a riot, but the french version of Robin Hood was a bit of a pain.  The money spent on this one won't be wasted, but don't expect a classic, just expect to be entertained, after all thats what movies are for",991267200,,780,4.419580419580419

Dreamworks did a great job with this movie, and could become the biggest movie of the year and surpass Pearl Harbor.  If you haven't seen this movie yet, you should see it.

I really thought about the movie. These are the finer points in the flick:  1. Whoever thought of the gingerbread man being tortured is a pure genius. I laughed so hard ... 2. An ogre's ideas of being clean are definetly unique... not to mention they have a abundence of gas.  3. Although I don't ever remember reading about a talking donkey in my fairy tale books... putting Eddie Murphy as the ""...comedy relief"" worked really well. ""SHREK! I'M LOOKING DOWN!"" (not getting down) 4. For those of you who have seen the movie, you know exactly how big the prince is. Shrek and Donkey constantly ""tease"" him about his size... ...5. Over all... the script was semi-predictable... but still great... the characters were funny and even though the movie was full of sarcasm and humor... it still had its ""romantic twist""... not to mention the predictable misunderstanding between Shrek and the Princess...

It is a hilarious and happy family movie; a moral tale for small fry (although it is rated Parental Guidance for mild language and some crude humor) and a laugh-a-thon treat for adults. The animation is more realistic than cartoon.  Special tools called ""Shapers"" (see shrek.com) enabled the animators to imitate actual movement of bone, muscle, fat and skin with a layer of clothing for the human characters and a layer of fur for the animal characters.  The result is astounding. Landscapes are especially real as evidenced by water flowing over river rocks in a small creek and a flowing lava moat surrounding the castle.  Then there are smoking campfires and dissipating dusty footfalls as the ogre, Shrek, and his wise cracking donkey walk the mountain. Disney defector and now Dream Works partner pokes fun at Main Street Disneyland, Small World and a myriad of ""Disneymania"".  The fairy tales are fractured and innuendoes abound in this hysterical comedy.

1316450,5,B00003CXXI,"Easily the funniest movie of the year.  I can't say enough about the fun poked at traditional animation.  Disney is given a good working over from the movies, to the parks, to the chief executive.  There's a fantastic moral that isn't bashed over your head to make the point.  The voice acting is perfectly cast, which is no mean feat in an animated feature.  Also, the actors do a great job of properly pronouncing ""Lord Farquaad.""  What's the big deal?  Drop the ""r"" in the last name and say it a little faster than normal.  Great adult joke eh?  Listen for Cameron Diaz to almost blow the pronunciation a couple of times.
That brings me to a good point.  This is a PG movie.  Dreamworks could be chided for marketing it as a kids movie, but I believe a good parent will look into a movie beforehand anyway. Use your judgement.
One last bone to pick.  Yes the ""bullet time"" scene may seem a little old, but it is an homage to Diaz's character in Charlie's Angels that I think works very well.

This movie had humor, suspence and even touched on the emotional side for the star the Ogar.  It had an unusual ending to it which I thought was great because usually the endings are predictible and without giving it away even though it dosen't end the way you think you are glad it does because it shows that beauty is only skin deep and it's whats inside that counts.  It holds your attention for adults and children.  My nephews who are 7 and 9 loved it and have seen it 3 times already.  Although maybe for real young children they wouldn't understand the story but Eddie Murphy alone as the donkey is so funny that he could make anyone laugh just to watch his movements and they way he speaks.  I can't say enough good things about this movie...it's definately worth the price of admission and I can't wait to buy it when it comes out on video!!",991094400,,968,4.320441988950276

The little princess was beautiful and the talking mule was hysterical (thank you Eddy Murphy for being Eddy Murphy).

This movie is, by all means, absolutely hilarious. The film is undercut with so many innuendos and allusions to fairy tales that it's hard to keep up, but if you catch them, you laugh in appreciation.
There are numerous clever scenes, among them the evil Lord Faarquad's interrogation of the gingerbread man. Wait for the princess to sing to the bluebird...and luagh at what happens. The whole scene is an ingenuous parody of the whole ""Sleeping Beauty"" singing in the forest scene.
Aside from the clever hilarity, the movie, intended for children as well as adults, incorporates the obligatory moral, but it isn't so overpowering that it gets in the way of the story.
This is a must see movie, and an instant classic that isn't too childish for adults to enjoy, and at the same time isn't beyond the grasp of children.",991094400,,1003,4.672316384180791
1316490,4,B00003CXXI,"Shrek is one of those movies where you know exactly what's going to happen from the very outset, but it manages to pull its premise off with such style that you don't mind the predictability.  Myers does an admirable job of giving Shrek a likable personality, despite the toned-down Fat Bastard brogue.  Eddie Murphy performs well as the donkey and is exceptionally funny, but my main beef with him is the same as ever: he needs more vocal range, as he typically sounds too much like himself.  Many of the scenes are almost photorealistic in their rendering, and more than once I ""wowed"" to myself.  The animation is nothing less than stunning, if occasionally a little too stylized for my tastes.  I thoroughly enjoyed the film, and I'd like to see more animated movies done on this level, without descending into the dreadful mire of childish musicals for which American animation is best known.
Decidedly aimed at a 10-25 age group, Shrek may not be for the wee ones, but you'd be hard pressed to find a better ""family"" film lately.",991094400,,1035,4.696132596685083

1316498,5,B00003CXXI,"In the fine tradition of other great animatronic films like Toy Story, Antz and A Bug's Life, Shrek is another solid outing in this genre.  This is such a great film from several perspectives.  The story, while formulaic (beautiful princess that needs rescuing, an evil tyrant King, etc) this film combines all the elements of a great film:  comedy (tons of it with Mike Meyers and Eddie Murphy), action, and of course, the lovey-dubbey romance.  It also combines all the classic elements of a great fantasy (which this is):  noble knights, dragons and other mythical creatures, action, adventure and yes, romance.  Plus, the underlying theme of love, true love for that matter, is just such a great message.  All in all, it's just a great story - period.
Two elements that made this film so enjoyable for me was the open use of ""children's fantasy characters"" throughout the movie.  The first sequence of the film showed such mainstays of children's tales as:  Hansel and Grettle, the Three Little Pigs and the Big Bad Wolf, Robin Hood and his Merry Men, the Ginger Bread Man (in a HILARIOUS torture scene), the Three Blind Mice, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, etc.  These depictions alone made it a jewel for older people like myself who remember growing up hearing these stories.  This also makes it a jewel for children of THIS generation.
The other great element in this movie was the great chemistry between Mike Meyers and Eddie Murphy.  Meyers, who voices Shrek, sounds just like he did in another role he did a few years ago - Fat Bastard from the Austin Powers movie.  Murphy also seems to reprise his hilarity from his Mushu character from Mulan.  Together, they combine HILARIOUS repartee that just keeps you rolling throughout the film.
I whole-heartedly recommend this to all.  It's a great way to spend a few hours, whether you're seeing it with your friends, your kids (definitely see this with the kids), your boyfriend/girlfriend/spouse or your family.  You'll be laughing the whole time.

My husband and I laughed out loud more in this movie than in any movie, for kids or adults, than we have in years. You will have a hard time believing that Mike Myers is the one doing Shrek's voice with the fabulous accent he does.
Another pleasant surprise was the soundtrack. All the songs are hits from when we were kids: a new rendition of Petula Clarks's ""You Belong to Me"" and ending with Eddie Murphy doing a great job updating The Monkee's song ""I'm A Believer"" to end the film. Not one person left during his song, in fact, the theater was filled with the sound of all the adults singing along. It was amazing!

The storyline is good.  A vane Lord, who seems to have an unexplained problem with fairy tales, wants to become the perfect King. He cannot, unless he marries a princess.  To do so, he must rescue her from a fire-breathing dragon. But a man of his stature can't do this, so he enlists Shrek, a local Ogre. Thus the story begins. Through all the jokes and fun, a simple love story appears, and the movie carries a very good moral.  Casting was excellent, in both the major and minor characters.

Everyone in the theater enjoyed the matrix scene and the macarena scene and all the other references to other films.  I kind of think that this was the point of a lot of the humor in the movie.  For those that watched the movie and don't understand this or have a problem with it, rethink the music you listen to and the software you use.  Then just get over it.

I had read the the Wall Street Journal article on how Linux was used for achieving frame rates 10 times faster than what used to be possible on a Windows or SGI based workstations. As a programmer I really wanted to see the difference it made.
The verdict? Its astounding!! Everything from shadows to textures is captured like never before. If you thought Bugs Life is as good as it gets, go watch this. After seeing the results SKG Productions has gotten through Linux, Pixar (makers of Bugs Life et al) is also in the process of ditching Windows for Linux :-)

I thought when I sat down in the crowded theater that, as it so often is, the hype for this movie was probably fabricated by the film industry, and the ""Shrek-obsession"" that people claimed to have was simply due to the superb graphics. I assumed that the story line would be nothing but toilet humor.
 I WAS WRONG!
 This movie is wonderfully witty and absolutely, 100% entertaining. Yes, the plot is unoriginal, but that's okay! The reason it's unoriginal is because of the fact that it's been used so many times. Why has it been used so many times? Well, it works.
  I strongly advise young and old to come and see this divine Fairy Tale farce.",990748800,,813,4.6573426573426575

I saw it the day after it opened.  The audience was very diverse; all races of all ages, and everyone in the audience enjoyed it.  In particular, when the ""Matrix"" parody began every single person in the theater burst into huge fits of laughter, myself included.
Everyone in the cast did a great job voicing, but Eddie Murphy, with his talking-nonstop Donkey, and John Lithgow, with his deliciously evil Lord Farquaad, really stole the show.
C'mon.  You *know* an animated film is good when a male teenage college student recommends it.",990662400,,643,4.862385321100917

1316715,5,B00003CXXI,"I'll be honest; I've been waiting for this movie since I saw the very first trailer back in November.  I didn't need to see much to make me enthused: fully CGI-rendered movie; fantasy world setting; and voiced by Mike Meyers, Eddie Murphy, John Lithgow, and Cameron Diaz.  I knew just from that short preview that I'd be laughing my patookus off!
 So I've been doing my best to avoid the marketing blitz, since it started in earnest 3 months ago.  I didn't want all the good lines ingrained in my brain before I'd even seen the film.  Oh, I still shopped at Ralphs, and got (free) ice cream at 31 Flavors, but I wanted to let the film unfold all by itself.  I was mostly successful in avoiding the DreamWorks marketing machine, so the movie was able to speak for itself.
 And I didn't leave the theater disappointed!
 Shrek is a very funny movie, which turns every storybook convention on its ear (or cone-shaped ear-like appendage).  Starting out with its protagonist: Shrek (voiced by a Meyers in a decidedly NON-obnoxious Scottish brogue) is large, green, and has terrible hygiene.  But that's normal for an ogre.  He goes about his daily routine of bathing in filth, sprucing up the land around his swamp-home, and frightening away those pesky torch-bearing humans that come to hunt him down.
 It seems that Lord Farquaad (fiendishly portrayed by Lithgow), has got a Napoleon complex and wants his land of Dulac to be the happiest place on earth.  A few things getting in the way of his plan are that he's not actually a king, and the presence of all those darn pixies, dwarves, and talking animals.  The Magic Mirror he's captured directs his attention to the fair Princess Fiona, whom he plans to marry, in order to attain king-hood.  He has also decreed that all fairy-tale creatures in the land are to be rounded up and sent to ""relocation camps"" so that his domain will be ""perfect.""
 Murphy plays a talking Donkey, in a role eerily similar to Mu Shu from Disney's Mulan, but funnier. He manages to avoid capture by Farquaad's men, with some help from Shrek, a decision Shrek immediately regrets when the Donkey follows him home, and shows just why the Donkey was turned in to the authorities in the first place (he just can't stop talking).  Shrek soon learns that the Donkey is the least of his problems when all the relocated fairy-folk have been dropped at his front door.  In order to gain some peace, and get back to his solitary existence, Shrek decides to pay a visit to this Lord Farquaad to demand that the fairy-folk be re-relocated OFF his land.  Lord Farquaad decides that Shrek shall become his ""champion"" to free Princess Fiona from her prison (tall tower, fire-breathing dragon, enchantments, the usual), and return her to the kingdom, so that Lord Farquaad can marry her, and become a king.  In return, Shrek shall get his home back.
 And so begins a wonderful fairy tale!  Like all great family films, Shrek works on many levels.  There is plenty of toilet humor and physical comedy for the wee lads and lasses; lots of references to classic tales that 'tweens will instantly understand, action for your adolescents, and satire for the parents (what? No one else noticed the digs at that OTHER movie studio... the one that owns the theme park?).  The film does have a PG rating, mostly for the raunchiness of some of its humor and language (though you can't expect a movie with a donkey as one of its main characters NOT to use the word ""ass,"" can you?).  The jokes that could be the most offensive will be lost on the young ones, anyway, since the filmmakers take great delight in hinting at its crudeness, rather than explicitly stating it (perhaps they're, heh heh...""compensating"" for something, eh?).
There is a moral, naturally.  And there is True Love.  The film always stays true to its roots as a fairy tale.  I'll let you figure out what the moral is (so as not to ruin the ending), but suffice to say that it is an important thing for kids to learn. It's probably not the first time that we've seen it, but it is better realized than I have seen it before.  Don't get me wrong, the film isn't preachy; there is plenty of action.  Princess Fiona shows off some moves she taught herself while in captivity (apparently she had a DVD player, with The Matrix handy).  They even manage to do the old ""out-running-the-fireball"" gag.  Surprisingly, I didn't mind so much this time around (and I HATE that bit).
 On technical grounds, Shrek is amazing.  The computer graphics were so natural looking, as to be ignored (so I could focus on the characters and story).  Now THAT is a testament to the skill of the filmmakers!  The crew of Shrek is the same crew that worked on Antz, and they took the facial animations up another notch, by giving their humans realistic features.  The characters' faces are so well animated that emotions are made possible by subtle facial changes.  Combined with the excellent voice acting of the cast, the characters become 3-dimensional in emotion, as well as space.  The filmmakers prove that Shrek is about more than just flashy eye-candy (as if The Iron Giant hadn't already taught us a CGI character can move us to tears).  The soundtrack to Shrek is made up of an eclectic mix of contemporary hits, from Smashmouth to The Proclaimers to Rufus Wainwright.  Unlike A Knight's Tale, however, the anachronistic music works, since the animation style already breaks us out of ""reality.""  Instead the music is simply used to fit the mood of the scene.  Eddie Murphy's constant chatter, too, is full of modern references, and this may end up dating Shrek before it can become a ""classic.""  The fairy tale references, of course, should remain timeless.
This film has a lot of charm, and it made me laugh consistently.  It proves that a film that relies on technology can only succeed if it has a heart to support it.  So please, take time out to see the ogre who is deeper than he lets on (""like an ONION!""), the princess who is more than she seems, the noble who tries to be more than he is, and the donkey... who always lets you know how he's doing.",990662400,,6110,4.631383472609099

What I really liked about this movies was that duality-that one set of lines can be almost making me wet my pants while the more innocent version is keeping the little guys and gals glued to the screen.  I found it to be reminiscent of the first Toy Story and the underlying message is easy for kids of all shapes and sizes to understand without being so cookie cutter sweet and sappy.

1316789,5,B00003CXXI,"Shrek is a WONDERFUL surprise--especially for adults. It is so good you'll forget you're watching animation. The jokes are hilarious and they poke fun at many fairy tales and conventions of society.
A word of warning however: some of the humor and language is a bit edgy--much like the Simpsons on TV. Nothing too bad here, but the way little ones repeat words they hear, you may want to view it before they do to see if you're comfortable with them seeing it. But even if they don't go, you're sure to love the lovable Shrek!",990489600,15,526,4.489583333333333
1316790,3,B00003CXXI,"Shrek is a very cute movie. Contrary to what I've heard others say though, I don't think it is a movie for kids and adults. This is a movie for kids only. There are a few occasions of language that could be considered inappropriate for children (something that was a problem in Dreamworks' Antz as well - why are they afraid to make a straight forward kids' movie?), but the movie isn't satisfying for adult tastes. First let me say what was good: Eddie Murphy stole the movie flat out. His performance was perfect! Cameron Diaz was very good as Princess Fiona. The animation is excellent, rivaling that of Disney/Pixar's Bug's Life. Now what isn't all that good? John Lithgow and Mike Meyers both seem out of place in their character's bodies - I couldn't think of them as anyone other than themselves. The story is very shallow - typical animated fair - it didn't have the depth for an adult audience. The humor - quite frankly I didn't think the movie was that funny. I laughed in a few places, but mostly just grinned, and quite a few of the jokes fell flat. The Matrix joke with the princess is an obvious example; it seemed dated in the commercial, and is even more out of place in the scene its in. There are some holes in the story toward the end that have bothered me more and more since leaving the theater - where did the fairy tale people go when they left the swamp? Farquad obviously had something nasty up his sleeve but we never find out what ( was this trimmed for time?), and how did the gingerbread man get one of his legs back? and why not both? I admit these are minor points, but they've just been bugging me. All in all, I highly recommend Shrek for kids, but if you are not an animation fan and don't have kids, don't bother - there isn't enough here to keep an adult audience satisfied.",990489600,8,1811,4.3609467455621305

1316795,5,B00003CXXI,"Shrek is a playful comedy is full of love, comedy, action, retrospection, and fairy tale creatures that actively flirts with the audience from the beginning to the end. The film tied me up with humor that was meant for young and old, lay and expert, men and women. Nevertheless, the humor was not the best characteristic of the film. No, the best characteristic of the film was the concerns of real life that were brought up with charm and seriousness, which was made easily digested with the humor. Some of these real life concerns was friendship, love, discrimination, intolerance, and greed. The only aspect that I did not like was the villain's short stature, which was used as a tool for slapstick humor. However, I am willing to let this one slide, since it reflects the ambiguity of each individual personality.

Shrek offers stunning animation, interesting characters, engaging voices, a classic storyline, even a noble moral to the story. Why not a 5-star rating, then? Well, I don't consider myself a moralistic prude, but I honestly do not think that the nature and extent of flatulence and excrement-based humor is desirable in a movie directed at children, nor was it necessary for this story.
Sure, I laughed at most of it, but why do people who obviously possess the tremendous creative capacity necessary to create a ""Shrek"" insist on stooping to the lowest forms of humor? I just don't get it. I didn't get it years ago when ""Roger Rabbit"" used jokes that took it out of the ""kid pix"" category for me and I don't get it now. Sorry.

Other family movies may have more depth to their stories (Toy Story 1/2, Chicken Run) or more slam-bang action and adventure (Spy Kids), but nothing combines both of those with a near-overdose of hilarity like Shrek.  I laughed so hard I cried, and the weird thing is, my wife and my 3, 6, and 9-year-old daughters were all hysterical at the same time!  A smidgeon of ""potty"" humour for the kiddies, but done lightly enough that even the parents couldn't help laughing, plus enough farce and social satire to add really enjoyable depth to the slapstick (the Robin Hood / Riverdance / Bruce Lee / The Matrix sequence was inspired movie making!).

It's about Shrek, who's a gruff on the outside but soft inside ogre played my Mike Meyers, who sets off on a quest to rid his swamp of all the fairy tale creatures that have been exiled there, and as his companion for his adventures he has a donkey, voiced by Eddie Murphy.
I would not exactly call this a kid's movie.  It is rated PG and they will love it, but most of the humor is actually aimed at adults, and it hits the mark.  I laughed all the way through it - something I haven't done at the movies in some time.  There are a lot of clever physical gags (pretty much anything that's bodily and gross) centered around Shrek and then there's Murphy's character of the donkey.  Murphy's performance here equals anything else he has done.  If you are a fan of Eddie Murphy, you won't be disappointed  with his character.
This movie is not just one long comedy though.  Remember, this is a fairy tale, so there is a romance story going on as well, but it never takes itself too seriously, keeping the movie's light atmosphere from bogging down.
Cameron Diaz as Princess Fiona and John Lithgow as the rotten Farquaad are simply superb.  All the actors were well picked for their characters.
You won't regret going to see this show.  In fact, you may consider going a second time.  I know I am.",990316800,27,1599,4.431506849315069
1316910,5,B00003CXXI,"What can I say? Shrek was fantastic. I have been following the development of this movie for over a year now and knew it would be a movie I enjoyed. And enjoy it I did. Mike Myers, Cameron Diaz and Eddie Murphy are terrific. Don't deprive yourself from seeing this film because you think it's for kids. Adults will get a kick out of it as well. Long Live Shrek!!",990316800,,362,4.185714285714286
1316911,5,B00003CXXI,"If you loved Babe or Beauty and the Beast, you'll love SHREK.  It's hip, funny and very irreverent.  Where else can you see a big green ogre ""break wind"" in a pond and watch dead fish float to the top of the water??  Kids are going to love this movie, and adults are going to enjoy it just as much.  I've seen it twice and would happily go back a third time.  Great soundtrack too.  This movie WILL be one of the biggest of the entire summer.  Guaranteed!",990316800,,455,4.1022727272727275
1316912,5,B00003CXXI,"This is one of the most enjoyable and halarious movies I have seen in a long time. I saw it the day it came out in theaters with my wife and 9 year-old-son. We loved the movie so much we went to go and see it again the next day and enjoyed it just as much!  Shrek is a very likable and reluctant hero who is well-potrayed in the movie. His mannerisms and facial expressions are so detailed. Mike Myer's famous Scottish accent fits Shrek's personality so well. I am sure he will be around to star in a sequel.  Eddie Murphy simply steals the show as Shrek's cowardly motor-mouthed side-kick ""Donkey"" who just want to be Shrek's friend even though Shrek would just like to shut him up in the worst way. Donkey is so funny in the movie! By the middle of the film, Donkey had me laughing so hard I missed little funny parts because my eyes were filled with tears from laughing so hard.
  John Lithgow was excellent as the prince with a Napoleon complex that does not escape the notice of Shrek and Donkey. Lithgow's voice fits the prince so well. His funny name will go over most kids head as will many of the jokes in the film( But there is still plenty left for them to get).
  Shrek is a fast moving adventure that leaves you begging for more but doesn't drag on. There is lots of action and some fairy-tale romance that the kiddies will appreciate. The computer generation is state of the art, dowm to a single blade of grass.  The only flaw in the film is that some of the characters moves like puppets sometimes( the princess mostly being the culprit). I do not understand how the animation with Shrek himself can be doe so well and not some of the other charcters. This little quirk could never tarnish the beauty of this film. Film-goers will just ignore it and enjoy the show, especially if they realize they have never heard their kids laugh so hard.

1316913,5,B00003CXXI,"I loved Shrek!  It delivers the multilayered story that characterizes many of the best animations.  As an adult, I loved the good-natured pokes at Disney and the animated characters of my youth (Snow White, Tinkerbell, Pinnochio), but all the kids around me were laughing as well.
 The story steals from many fairy tales, including The Princess Bride, in a way that is derivative yet fresh, twisting old conventions for humor.  Yes, you can see where it's going, but the journey remains fun.  The computer animation is excellent.  See it with or without kids.",990316800,,559,4.956989247311828
1316914,5,B00003CXXI,"This is the 1st great movie of the summer. Animation fans rejoice with this blockbuster from Dreamworks that is basically a re-work of Beauty and the Beast. It is a wonderful reworking without the Disney schmaltz (and also minus the incredible songs).  The voice talent is amazing with Eddie Murphy (as the donkey companion to Shrek) practically stealing the show from Mike Myers (voicing Shrek). Cameron Diaz is wonderful as Fiona the beautiful princess (and a whole lot more). John Lithgow is splendid as the king wannabe Farquad.  The film is awash in funny lines to fabulous jokes at the expense of Disney Films. It is also incredibly charming (if slightly predictable). Great for small children, older kids and the whole darn family!!",990230400,2,739,5.0
1316915,5,B00003CXXI,"WOW!  I laughed so hard I had tears in my eyes.  The 14 8-year-old girls infront of me found me amusing, if not bizarre.  Great lines, great characters, appeal for everyone -- young-old-all.  We all know what to expect from archtype characters -- well these don't fit the mold, which adds a twist you won't soon forget.  SEE IT!",990230400,,328,4.491525423728813
1316916,5,B00003CXXI,"We almost passed up seeing it and what a mistake that would have been.  Shrek turns out to be funny and thought provoking.  It really dissed Disney which made it even more hilarious.  Mike Meyers and Eddy Murphy were excellent.  The PG rating is due to the use of a few minor curse words, which had the children in the audience 'AAWWWING', though it was probably nothing they haven't heard before.  My children and I highly recommend seeing this movie.",990230400,,452,4.6
1316917,3,B00003CXXI,"First the good news- Shrek is a wonderfully animated movie with plenty of tonal shifts and ever-changing moods. The donkey is probably the best animated character I've seen. The only downer was the Princess character - she has a great bod and a few good expressions, but she was the most fake looking character in the movie. Now the bad news - the movie simply isn't funny. The jokes are in short supply and are very thin. The movie doesn't get annoyingly cute, but the plot is so obvious that the film never really gets interesting.  I give it three stars on the strength of its dazzling animation.",990230400,,599,4.546296296296297
1316918,5,B00003CXXI,"Superbly executed, another excellent work from DreamWork. Very ""witty""(you will be amazed), nice voice by eddie Murphy, and gratifying graphics. The main plot was just like all the other ""save the princess"" movies, but this one had many interesting twists, the whole theater was laughing so wild all the time, it made me feel dizzy even now. I would say it was the best Carton of the year, and you definitely should bring your whole family to see it!",990230400,,450,4.708860759493671
1316919,5,B00003CXXI,"Funny and charming!!!. Just when you think you've seen them all, Dreamworks comes out with Shrek. New and impressive animation style to a wonderful story. Recomend this one for all ages.",990230400,,186,5.032258064516129
1316969,5,B00003CXXI,"This movie was awesome!  Everything about it was great.  It's perfect for both kids and adults.  The humor of this movie fits all ages.  You can find both high end and low end humor.  The animation is amazing.  A quarter of the way through the movie you begin to forget that it's animated, then you are treated to a close up of Shrek and you can see everone of his PORES!  That's insane.  The story has a good message of not judging someone based on appearances, but looking inside them.  The performances are flawless and the theatre was laughing almost the entire time. Mike Myers and Eddie Murphy have such great chemistry together, and Donkey is one of the greatest characters.",990230400,,681,4.56198347107438
1316970,5,B00003CXXI,"Good day, people!  Well, I saw this movie last night, opening night, here in lovely old Seattle, Washington.  I went in expecting a moderately funny kids show, but let me tell you, that is NOT what I saw.
This show starts out funny, and only gets better.  Yes, it is an animation, full of Disney characters, but this movie reaches out to all ages in many ways.  First and foremost, the animation and Disney characters and childish plot (save the princess!) will appeal to kids.  The references to other movies, the very NON-standard way they go about things, and the other adult jokes that kids will miss... those will appeal to adults.
I highly recommend that anybody interested go see this movie.  It teaches a good lesson for kids, but the teaching isn't so overbearing as to make adults cringe and say, ""Yeah, it's for kids.""",990230400,,829,4.6438356164383565

1316973,5,B00003CXXI,"I took my son and his two small daughters to see Shrek last night, and three generations had a wonderful time.  The movie hits the ground running, with the opening sequence setting the pace for drollity, surprise, and outright bellylaughs.  It gently lampoons fairy tales, Disney, the Matrix...  I forget how many other little barbs festoon this jewel, but I cannot remember the last time I have laughed this hard at the movies, or left a theater in a better mood.  The cool part was that all three generations seemed to share the same experience.  And the dragon is FABULOUS!  This is definitely a must-see movie.",990230400,,614,4.745283018867925
1316974,5,B00003CXXI,"Great fun, with more humor for adults than 99% of the live-action ""comedies"" we get. Myers and Murphy make an excellent team and one has to wonder what would have happened had Dreamworks broken the tradition of having voice-overs recorded individually?  Alone these two are great and possibly some of the best ad-libbers around.  Together...an idea for Shrek 2?
A billion pop culture references color this film but more than that, seeing your old fairy tale critters put on the screen in a less than ""normal"" light is worth the price of admission alone.  The interrogation of the Gingerbread Man is possibly the funniest thing I've witnessed in ages.
Strangely even the film's core moral is not as bad as I had feared.  I expected the worst and Dreamworks at least gave us a decent ending.
With Memento and now Shrek, at least 2001 will have some quality films to remember.",990230400,,873,4.76158940397351
1316975,5,B00003CXXI,"This movie was one of the best I've seen in a while.  Being 16 most animated movies are either dumb or have cheesy humor. This had niether.  It was funny and it kept moving.  They made quite a few pokes at Disney (Beauty and the Beast, Pinnochio...) as wll as other movies (The Matrix...) which only added to the humor.  The music was entertaining too, and it fit with the scenes, which doesn't always happen.  A few things to keep in mind;  1.)If you find that Donkey is becoming annoying, remember, this is why donkeys don't talk.  2.)Ogres are like onions.  All in all this is a great movie that I highly suggest seeing. The dirty language is only mild (a couple of words here and there and nothing horrible - for example, the other word for donkey is about as bad as it gets.)  I suggest going to the theaters with you kids and seeing it.",990230400,,842,4.312101910828026
1316976,5,B00003CXXI,"Shrek is a movie that both the young and the adults can easily enjoy.
The story, in a nutshell is all about an ogre who has enjoyed a life of solitude suddenly has all the mythical denzines of the kingdom suddenly dumped on his swamp land.  He wants this situation rectified immediatly.
The king, a tiny little fellow with a 'taste' for torture offers him a deal he can't refuse.  Rescue a princess he wants to marry, slay the dragon and the creatures will be removed.
Along the way he is joined by a talking donkey.
The princess isn't the hapless damsel that you would expect either, and there is a very unusual plot twist which comes to a head at the end of the movie.
A must see.
The humor is both for adults and children, and hardly a minute goes by without the audience laughing. There are also tributes paid to various movies, such as Robin Hood, Matrix and so forth.
It is a movie that you could more than likely see several times and not grow tired of it.",990144000,2,963,4.285714285714286

When a king want-a-be ,vanshies all the fairtale creatures too his swamp. Inorder too get rid of these pest .Sherk must go too the castle(or is it an amusment(disney maybe?lol) park?).There he is talked into rescuing the lovely princess from the dragon. To rid his home of the fair tale critters he takes the job. And so the movie goes-as we follow Shrek and his side kick donkey on there adventure. Along the way We learn its not what's on the out side that counts,but who we are inside. Lead by the voice of Mike Myres(shrek) & Eddy Murphy(donkey):This movie pokes fun at just about every fairtale  in history & Disney. from the Wizard of Oz too the Lion King. From Mother Goose too  Robin Hood(the human not the fox).from slap stick humor too sex related humor. This covers all the bases thanks too a PG -RATING. Although some  young kids(6 under) may find fairtale charecters beging knocked around  offensive it's a reltivly safe movie for everyone.  On a final note if you listen too the music and songs they help tell the story very nicely and move it along. The piece Hallelhujah captures the entire story. Here is another spot Dream works takes yet another crack at Disney:With the new and improved version of ""It's a Small World""(lol).
