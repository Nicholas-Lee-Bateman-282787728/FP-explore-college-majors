7978417,1,B00007L4LW,Don't believe the fake good reviews. It's about as good as Slaughter Claus is from 2011.,1514505600,,88,4.5625
7978418,1,B00007L4LW,"Step right up folks and see how you,too,can make a zero ""slasher"" flick for about one dollar or less--and then manage to see it available on Amazon for purchase.

First, just any ole video camera will do. Borrow the one your grandparents brought at Wal-Mart when  they shot  their church choir singing. You don't want to worry about such things like lighting, special effects, effective angles.

Just point your camera at your  neighbors and you're on your way!

Now, for the really terrifying ""psycho santa"", just tell your tall, lanky trailer park bud to wear just what he usually does with mowing his lawn or fishing down at the creek. So we see him wearing faded, cut-off jeans, white socks and a patch over one eye. Dab his face with some red stuff that might look like blood and there you have him--the scariest psycho monster since Mickey Mouse.

In your first  scene, have a young lad in the front seat  of his car and his girlfriend. Give him about l0 pages of dialogue, as he drones on about the legend of a poor misfit who was forced to wear a white sock and no shoe--or something like that. I had already nodded off to dreamland halfway through his endless droning and his attentive girlfriend who keeps nodding her head as if totally fascinated.

They're murdered by the psycho Santa. You knew they were terrified beause we see both tragic victims by the way they  open their eyes real wide and squeal.

Then the movie moves to a lake and some more neighbors of the film maker sit around a table arguging about the psycho Santa. They appear to be actually drunk from all the Bud Lite we see them guzzling. Two of the fun-lovers get into a canoe, with the male hero strumming a guitar.

I think this must have been a sign of the psycho santa because he suddenly emerges from the water,gasping for breath, and the couple don't see him. A few minutes later, we see the doomed couple recoiling in fake horror as they suddenly see psycho santa. He kills them with some more red stuff squirting toward the camera

The director shows us what a raunchy guy he is by having all the girls taking off their tops. One of them is shown for a long time soaping up her upper torso. This really scared me. I knew this had something to  do  with psycho  Santa but  by then I'm afraid my heavy lids finally closed for a long sleep.

Oh,by the way,I don't know what the title means, since I saw no sign of Christmas anywhere in this amateur exercise in movie making. And as for psycho Santa, he looked more like a semi-drunk guy from a trailer park who can always brag to his bar buddies  how he appeared as a terrifying psycho slasher in a  video that looks like it was made by  a buncha junior high guys during their lunch break.",1359504000,2,2725,4.408
7978419,1,B00007L4LW,"This is below bad. An absolute mockery of film making Thankfully, CHRISTMAS SEASON MASSACRE does offer a few gruesome gore scenes and some absurd humor that almost makes the 55m run time worth sitting through. A group of old high school friends get together to celebrate the holidays, but their festivities are cut short when Oneshoe McGroo, the eye patch-clad teen they had tormented in high school, returns to exact his revenge. What results is a grueling hour of the absolute worst acting imaginable padded out with a pointless series of unrelated events that is supposed to constitute a plot. Many characters are killed before they are even introduced, and those that do have names garner no sympathy from the audience as they get drunk and act a fool. There are very few moments that didn't suck in the entire film, two of which involved uninspired gore consisting of nothing more than McGroo rifling through pig intestines, and the other two being hilarious moments where a little pirate flag pops up signaling impending doom for whichever two idiots are on screen. With next to nothing to do with Christmas, one would be hard pressed to find anything worth watching in this one. Anyone could make this film, there is no skill in any aspect of the film making, and it is an unforgivably bad entry even for B-movie Horror.

Some of the comedy was clever and some was downright nasty, but it all worked well with its main slasher movie theme.  The characters were all fun and unique from the crazed storyteller to the nerd, to the serenading lover-boy.  I recommend taking a trip to ""Camp Lame Dog Hollow"" and join this group of oddballs in a game of ""strip Trivia Pursuit"" by picking this movie up.",1123459200,,448,4.439024390243903
7978421,1,B00007L4LW,"to be honest i'm not even going to waste my time to say how bad this film is, its just plain bad.  somethin about a killer named one shoe magroo or somethin.  anyways about a group of people who pretty much just sit around and do nothin until their killed one by one.  movie is just utterly boring and doesn't go nowhere fast.  its from sub rosa studios if that tells ya most of it.  terrible film and i do mean terrible low budget movie.  you've been warned.",1051056000,4,459,4.159090909090909
