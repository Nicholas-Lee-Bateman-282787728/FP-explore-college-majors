8296376,5,B001E52U58,"What a hoot!  Taylor is a university president.  Buckley is Buckley.

Universities, then as now, take heat for being politically skewed.  Academic freedom is trotted out as the reason higher education does not seek balance.

Buckley attempts to show that academic freedom is a ruse, selectively used to protect some political viewpoints but not others.

Buckley succeeds mightily in highlighting that unfavored viewpoints are excluded from the shield of academic freedom when Dr. Taylor says he says he won't employ racists as professors. Point established.

Taylor says racists are excluded because racists cannot possess cognitive abilities sufficient to be scholars.  Buckley effectively refutes that by pointing to an example of someone accepted as both a scholar and a racist, which Taylor accepts.

Buckley's point is that racism is suppressed in higher ed because it is unpopular, and of course, academic freedom is supposed to protect unpopular ideas.

Anyone who is familiar with Buckley knows he supported minority rights ardently. He is not arguing for racism, but is illustrating how academic freedom is misused.

Taylor sees where Buckley is going and spends 25 minutes dodging Buckley's questions as skillfully as any politician.  It's real entertainment.

Buckley's argument is that if schools should not employ racists as professors because their values are incompatible with today's society of freedom, tolerance, and democracy, then communists, too, whose values violently conflict with freedom, tolerance, and democracy should be excluded from professorships.

In my view, Taylor's evasiveness is a forfeit. Buckley prevails.

Further, higher education is not a refuge of academic freedom. Instead it suppresses expression it disfavors.  My conclusion (which I don't think is much disputed) - in a hierarchy of values possessed by institutions of higher education...

...political correctness ranks higher than intellectual honesty.",1399939200,,1951,5.672413793103448

8296378,4,B001E52U58,"This 1967 snapshot of academic discourse is certainly a primer for future David Frye-like impersonators of William F. Buckley, Jr. Here, Dr. Harold Taylor, academic-at-large, fends himself uncomfortably from the various insinuations of communism sympathy in the guise of hypothetical inquiry by Buckley for half the program, before successfully moving the heated polemics to Berkeley, defending academic freedom and student free speech away from the tyrannical trustee-control that Buckley upholds. This is a seminal look at education's naive caving into student wants as ""serous change."" By then communism was no longer the enemy, it was being a ""stuffed shirt,"" or un-groovy. Over time we know that this all led to laxity and unequal standards to produce the factories universities are tday. Neither the rigid traditionalism Mr. Buckley speaks for or the relaxed openness of Dr. Taylor signals well for education's role in shaping America's future. A wonderful Buckley wrestling match.",1239580800,2,987,5.586666666666667
