7809392,5,6300988619,"They go to a world that is run by an evil computer. Actually this world is some kind of space ship, but the computer tells the people on it that they are on a planet. So there is fake sky. There is an attractive lady there who falls in love with McCoy. It's a good show.",1296345600,,270,3.8392857142857144
7809393,4,6300988619,"Screw the amazon review-this episode is never given the credit it deserves. I think McCoy succeeds on a higher level than Kirk as a lover because he is not a seducer-he's a gentleman but still quite passionate. Anyone who thinks on the surface McCoy is no chick magnet should look at his eyes-that's where the passion is. I like the love-at-first sight scenario too-it seems like a McCoy kind of relationship starter. I especially like the scene in which they chat and eventually admit their feelings to each other-this is something McCoy never gets to do and DeForest Kelley handled it wonderfully-it is not a seduction as with the Kirk liasons, but the doctor sees a chance to retire in love.",1278979200,,694,4.743801652892562
7809394,4,6300988619,"This episode is average for the original series and barely rates 4 stars. But it would be extraordinary in any other series.

On the surface, this is yet another episode in which Kirk must straighten out a computer-controlled culture. For once it is McCoy who gets to fall in love with the high priestess, a refreshing change, although McCoy seems uncomfortable -- or perhaps just unpracticed -- kissing a girl on camera. Kirk got more practice.

But watch this episode for the religious references. The computer is ""the Oracle."" There is a Holy Book. There are religious rites, prophecies, and a promised Millienium in which the faithful will be delivered. In the meantime, the minds of the people must be carefully controlled. Like a vengeful God, the Oracle zaps anyone who dares question the literal truth of the prophecies.

What's really going on is that the people are travelling in a spaceship carefully designed to look like an asteroid, or small planet. It was created by their ancestors for a benign purpose. But (due to a computer malfunction?) the metaphor has become mistaken for reality, the computer has come to think that it's God, and the inflexibility of religion threatens the survival of society. You see, the ""spaceship"" has gotten off course and is about to collide with a planet. Kirk and company have to straighten things out before it's too late. But the Oracle computer zaps them when they come aboard and question the computer's infallibilty.

This thinly veiled criticism of religion could never have gotten on the air in 1960s TV if done directly. The genius of Star Trek is that it could make such a statement by clothing it in sci-fi terms. To be fair, the series occasionally made a mildly pro-Christian statement (Bread and Circuses, The Empath) as well. And it is only inflexible religion that is criticized, not necessarily all religion. But the message is clear: maybe you should think twice before interpreting your prophets and holy books too literally and dogmatically.

(Note: Microsoft employees might find it amusing today that an ""Oracle computer"" could be the source of such error and arrogance!)",1188172800,,2141,4.9692737430167595
7809395,2,6300988619,"This one is pretty weak overall. The ultra-aggressive high priestess gets McCoy to marry her within a few days, but hours later, she encourages him to leave. The oracle has the ability to ""zap"" the boys, but when they go for the book at the end, it only yells at them, ""NO! STOP!"" Pretty decent idea, rather poorly executed, McCoy utterly passionless as the man ""in love"".",1075766400,,372,4.567164179104478
7809396,3,6300988619,"The Enterprise crew land on a moving asteroid that is in the form of a planet on the interior and find it to be ruled by a computer, similar to ""The Apple"". At the same time, Dr. McCoy finds he has succumed to  an incurable disease with less than a year to live. This is one of the few  episodes shown with McCoy in love. Kate Woodville, who played the high  priestess Natira, never had a very illustrious career and apparently quit  the movie business long ago. A shame for such a beautiful and talented  actress. She also co-starred with Kirk Douglas in Posse.",954201600,3,562,4.365384615384615
