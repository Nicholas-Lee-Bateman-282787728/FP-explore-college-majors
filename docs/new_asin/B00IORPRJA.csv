8644250,4,B00IORPRJA,"Childs Pose (2013 release from Romania; 112 min.) brings the story of Cornelia, a well to do (and even better politically connected) 60 yr. old woman, and her grown-up son. As the movie opens, we see Cornelia complaining to a friend how little she sees of her 30-something son, who is in a longtime relationship with Carmen, whom Cornelia does not care for. Its not long into the movie that Cornelia gets the news that her son has been involved in a serious car accident, in which he runs over and kills a 14 yr. old boy who had stupidly run across the freeway. Was her son speeding? Or under the influence? At that point nobody, including us the viewers, knows the full circumstances of the incident. To Cornelia, none of that matters, as she goes into overdrive to call on her connections, political and otherwise, to keep her son out of jail. Along the way we get to know more and more of the son, who turns out to be a no-good, heartless scumbag who despises both his parents. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, youll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first, this is a stunning movie on so many levels. Initially it looks like this might be a police thriller (putting the pieces and facts together so as to understand what really happened at the time of the accident), and/or political statement (on how the 1% in Romania manipulate things to their advantage) but as the movie progresses, the focus shift towards the relationship between mother and son. Despite both of them being unlikeable characters (its tough to favor either of the controlling (at one point, Cornelias husband sneeringly calls her Controlia, ha!), manipulating, yet loving mother over the ungrateful, patronizing son, or the other way around), the movie pulls you in and the movie gets better and better as it moves forward. The movies second half goes from one key scene to the next, each one better than the other, until we get to the concluding scene. Sorry, I don't want to spoil but just brace yourself Not surprisingly, this movie is chockfull of towering performances, none more so than Luminita Gheorghiu as Cornelia, who is in practically every scene of the movie. She will just floor you. This movie was Romanias official entrance for the Foreign Language Movie Oscar from earlier this year (it was not nominatedand that gives you a good indication how stacked the field of foreign movies was this year). Kudos to director Calin Peter Netzer for bringing us this compelling psychological family drama.

I stumbled upon this movie when recently browsing the foreign movie section of my local library. So glad I picked it up! If you are in the mood for a top-notch quality foreign movie that is light years away from the standard Hollywood fare, you cannot go wrong with this. Childs Pose is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1418428800,,2853,4.7269076305220885

8644253,4,B00IORPRJA,"A haunting slide-of-life drama from Romania, ""Child's Pose"" explores the strained relationship between a middle-aged mother and her adult son, set within the context of an unspeakable human tragedy.

Cornelia Keneres, portrayed with masterful understatement and restraint by Luminita Gheorghiu, is a haughty, emotionally aloof woman who, nevertheless, just can't seem to cut the cords that bind her to her only child, Barbu (Bogdan Dumitrache). Barbu, of course, resents his mother's endless interference in his life, an interference that is only intensified when he tragically runs over and kills a 14-year-old boy who's crossing a freeway on which Barbu is driving recklessly. Because Barbu seems devoid of initiative in trying to make things right with both the legal system and the family of the victim, Cornelia launches into full Mama Bear mode, lavishing large sums of money in her wake as she attempts to clean up the life-shattering mess her son has made for himself and others. Is Cornelia now paying the consequences for treating her son as a child for so long? Is that why he now finds himself unable to step up to the plate and accept responsibility for his actions as a mature adult should?

Filmed in a wholly realistic and naturalistic style, ""Child's Pose"" is about as far from melodrama as a movie about life-and-death issues could possibly be. There are no grand speeches, no emotional outbursts springing from the tragic events of the story. The movie makes us feel as if we are eavesdropping on these people as they go about the business of trying to make sense of an entirely senseless situation. As such, we get to witness first-hand the agony and grief, the bitterness and guilt, and the thirst for redemption that the various characters are going through.

As embodied by the extraordinary Gheorghiu, Cornelia becomes a fascinatingly complex character made up of any number of inconsistencies and contradictions. For instance, she's constantly deriding Barbu for not being a man, for making a mess of his life and not fulfilling the hopes she and his father had for him when he was younger. Yet, it is her very insistence on meddling, mothering him and stepping in to solve all his problems that is the key factor in making him this way. And is she truly moved by the concerns of the grieving parties or is she motivated more by the fate of her own son and the guilt she might be feeling for the way she raised him?

Flawlessly written and directed by Cailin Peter Netzer (with Razvan Radulescu as co-writer), the movie ends on a powerful note, one that hints at the barest possibility for reconciliation and redemption for the individuals involved. It's a largely wordless moment, heartbreakingly silent and obliquely shot, and it is a moment that will linger long in the memory of anyone who sees it.",1406073600,,2827,4.920335429769392
8644254,5,B00IORPRJA,"I find it a little amusing that lately, the topic of Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy has come up between my wife and I and our families.  The conversations have never stemmed from this movie, but the fact remains that they have been had, and quite frequently.  While most cases reported of this type of abuse come in extreme forms, or at least those are the kinds that we tend to talk about, I couldn't help but recall this movie every time the conversation came up.

Less direct, just as damaging.

Basically, MSbP describes the exaggeration, fabrication or deliberate inducement of physical or psychological harm to those who are in their care.  Mostly, this is associated with parent/child treatment and the need for attention the parents feed off of, causing them to abuse their children in order to remain in the limelight.

Look how much suffering Im enduring for the sake of my child!

On the outset, one may not draw that conclusion from Childs Pose, but taking a step back to take in the entirety of the film could cause your viewpoint to shift.  The films Romanian name is Pozitia Copilului, which translates to Position the Child.  Taking this translation into account while watching the film could put things in perspective.  The entire time, no matter the circumstances, Cornelia is looming like a domineering Chess player, positioning her son in the best way possible to feed off his distress and cement herself as the dominant caretaker.

Munchausen Syndrome by Proxy.

Childs Pose is a brilliantly constructed character study that, as Ive outlined, is far more than it appears.  What seems on the outset to be a simple case of a mother trying to protect her son is truly something much deeper and far more disturbing.  Yes, it goes even deeper than my theory of MSbP, for there is the son, Barbu, to take a look at, and the films hint towards Oedipal Complex (which is a internalized competition with his father for the affections and overall dominance of his mother) and these themes collide in a rather sordid tale that involves a familial dynamic like youve never seen.  Its strange how the films core subject, which deals with the death of a child, takes a backseat to the heated honesty pouring from the familys life.

And lets take a moment to immortalize what Luminita Gheorghiu accomplished with this incredible performance.  She had so many moments to explode with ACTING and yet she knew how to present every facet of this woman and her emotional and psychological issues with such honesty, depth and naturalism.  Shes absolutely stunning to watch.

Some films simply tell a story, and thats great.  Other films insert themselves into your soul and demand that you take a deeper look at yourselves and the people around you.  Childs Pose is just such a film.",1404777600,2,2781,4.800420168067227
8644255,4,B00IORPRJA,"An interesting plot; well-acted and scripted.  I watched it in two parts due to having had a very hard time getting into it.  Had negative reactions to both mother and son, a sign that the acting is excellent in making you forget these are actors, not real people.  But I returned to give the second half another chance and enjoyed it immensely.",1404604800,2,345,4.532258064516129
8644256,5,B00IORPRJA,"A great foreign language art film and top prize winner at the 2013 Berlin Film Festival in which Luminitia Gheorghiu playing the mother, Cornialia Keneris Fagarasana steals the show.

Cornelia is a totally unlikeable controlling women who wants to manipulate everyone into doing her bidding, but she most despises her husband Relu and wants to get her claws back into her 30 something yo son, Barbu, after he marries Carmen who she sees as a threat for control of him. She gets her chance when Barbu is speeding home to be with Carmen, played to perfection by Illinca Goia, and ends up killing a 14yo boy in a traffic accident. This gives Cornelia a chance to exert her controlling infuence once again. She tries to manipulate the police at the station offering them bribes when threats don't work, especially with the female cop; she tries to bribe the one witness to say he was going much slower than he was as Barbu passed him thereby proving Barbu was speeding and at fault.

Cornelia never has a kind word for anyone unless it is to manipulate them into doing her bidding. She tells her husband, Relu, that he is a wimp for allowing her to push him around and lets her son beat on her quite often to show off her bruises/scars to prove she loves him.  She enlists her sister, Olga, a physician, to help her in all this. We can tell early on that both Relu and Barbu have no spine.

Cornelia likes her sex, when it gains her an advantage for something she really wants, chain smokes cigatettes and doesn't mind having a drink or two in the morning. Yet as all these machinations play out, it is sad to see how the little 14yo boy run over by Barbu and his poor family are treated by the system.

Cornelia even shows contempt for her loyal maid Clara, when she offers her a bribe of a new 200 euro pair of shoes for some information. When Clara says her feet are too big and won't fit into the shoes, Cornelia says, then give them to your daughter. She is especially contemptuous of her daughter-in-law, wanting to know why she hasn't had any children with her son, although she has a daughter from her first husband.  She tells Carmen we are both rathe UNATTRACTIVE women [actually Carmen was cute],so is that why Barbu doesn't want to have anything to do with her.

The scenes are both bleak and generally dreary, and the mood is decidedly downbeat throughout, but the acting was superb, and if you like drama you are sure to like this story, UNLESS you don't like a tell-all like MOMMIE DEAREST. No special effects, but lots of four-lettered words from everyone in this movie, especially Cornelia.",1402185600,3,2603,4.537313432835821
