8066188,1,B0009SCUW4,"BEWARE! somehow it has been crossed over that this contains the 1976 film ""gang wars"" AKA ""devil's express"".

I purchased this title with the same name and even the same UPC code from ebay which shows the same cover art, but with the Blaxploitation art in place of the incredibly bad, unnecessarily violent towards animals movie that this actually contains.

HUGE disappointment.",1293580800,5,379,5.096774193548387
8066189,5,B0009SCUW4,"I basing my review from watching a screener.

The Rapist is a very disturbing Hong Kong film based on a true story about a rapist roaming through a project compound.

What makes this film so different is the way it's filmed, almost documentary style or more like the camera happened to be there.

The rapist is a normal looking guy who takes girls and even one old woman and rapes them in an isolated area in the projects.

It's very disturbing stuff actually.

The camera just takes in the action like a cold spectator.

It's in the original language with sub titles and a very good transfer even though it's fullscreen.

Devil's Express is not the 1970's film blaxploitation film by the same name.

The artwork on this review copy is different and the movie is a Hong Kong film.

Lots of gore and worms coming out of body holes galore.

It's the kind of film I'm sure Andy Warhol would have put on a pedestal.

Widescreen and engish version.

Just a note on the Rapist-It's not for kids. Lots of realistic rape scenes.",1126569600,18,1020,4.483695652173913
