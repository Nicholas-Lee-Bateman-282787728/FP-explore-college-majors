8276501,5,B000289UYC,"The Current version of this is titled:  Teaching the Professional Swing.  It is absolutely sensational.  If you have Read books on Hitting,  this is an amazing supplement.  Essentially he takes the best ideas from Ted Williams,  Charlie Lau and Walt Hriniak  and puts them together to teach how to build a professional swing.

If you do not understand the principles of Rotational hitting,  Do not buy this until you do.  It is short and when he discusses concepts, he moves quickly.  This is an awesome supplement for a hitting coach, but you better have a strong foundation on hitting mechanics before you watch it or it may confuse you -  I think that's why the guy who reviewed it as Poor, was so upset, it assumes you have at least a basic understanding of how to hit a baseball",1420502400,,783,4.553956834532374

Mallee's credentials as a professional coach are impressive, but a major league understanding of the game does not autmatically make one a good teacher or provide a quality video.
In this case it does!
First, John Mallee is an excellent teacher.  He explains how the mechanics of a swing works.  He makes it simple.
But you don't have to understand how the baseball swing works to gain an advantage with his drills.  John's drills are designed to produce proper hitting mechanics without making the hitter think too much.
Second, he is great at building confidence and helping hitters discover a positive approach to hitting.
I highly recommend this video.  Guaranteed to make you better.",1087344000,2,690,4.973913043478261
