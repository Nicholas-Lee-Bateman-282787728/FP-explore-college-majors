1536455,5,B00005JOAP,"Love the season so far as I did when watching on television, BUT do not like how the discs are packaged (all stacked together in one pile)  Very tiresome having to remove all to get to one.  Please do not do that again.  Discs a bit jumpy in places.",1488672000,,249,4.040816326530612

1536459,1,B00005JOAP,I'm complaining about most of the Survivor seasons.  Some are $8.00 some $15.00  then you go to $32.00_$47.00 Ish..... why tell huge amount in difference each season?  I'm very interested in knowing and upset.,1484352000,3,209,5.088235294117647
1536460,5,B00005JOAP,It's all good.  No complaints at all.  A good vendor for sure.,1481155200,,62,4.083333333333333

1536462,2,B00005JOAP,The product is good but this season sucks... It is a very unfair season where there are two good players but a terrible twist that basically doomed half the cast right from the start. Only for fans of yau man and earl or for those that want to complete their collections. Terrible season.,1479772800,,288,4.452830188679245

1536533,3,B00005JOAP,Very cheesy packing. Definitely not the boxes like other DVD sets. All 5 disks in same case. Mine played just fine but thought I might get some better cases with info about shows listed somewhere. Can't give 5's to items not pack in their entirety.,1470614400,,248,4.533333333333333
1536534,1,B00005JOAP,Don't waste your money.  This was the worst produced survivor EVER.  So glad they abandoned that effort for future seasons.,1467763200,,123,5.1
1536535,4,B00005JOAP,"Still watching it. Interesting location, challenging participants, and the usual tropical downpours. Who pictures a deluge when fantasizing about a tropical island? By-play between contestants is constant, changing, interesting. Wanna see the social interplay that happens when a woman is harrassed, talks herself out of it, he talks himself out of it, she rethinks it all, and the people around them both get to chime in? It's all here in living color.",1464998400,,453,5.305555555555555

1536542,5,B00005JOAP,"I bought this for my mom for Christmas, and we loved re-watching this season. We have watched the show since the first season, and have a fondess for the first couple of seasons. Africa has been the one season we have been really wanting to re-watch, given how unique the setting and challenges were. I think it's one of the few seasons that hasn't taken place on an island. It was so much fun remembering all of the cast members and watching the extras. I really would like to purchase the other seasons, I feel like this show is kind of timeless.",1459382400,,548,4.382352941176471

1536605,3,B00005JOAP,"This season started out a little boring the first two episodes, with both boots being very predictable. From there the season picked up and was very interesting, with a great ending, a great final 4, and a great winner. The season had a very entertaining cast, with a great mix of extremely likable and those I loved to hate, which was coupled with great editing so nearly everyone got decent airtime. Camp life was great, the challenges were interesting, and almost every castaway was memorable in some way. I even liked Boston Rob this season, even though he is my least favourite Survivor of all time. The only reason this gets a star knocked off (would have been 4 stars) is because of the awful packaging. Seriously, why are the five discs all stacked on top of each other, instead of in a disc tray? This is the first time I've seen the five stacked on top method, and I hope it's the last. Unpacking and repacking the discs was laborious, and I really hope all future seasons are in a disc tray. The discs were also a little jumpy in some episodes (mostly the first) but did not affect viewing pleasure.

Overall, a good season. The final five is the most likable final five I've ever seen, and I would have been happy with any one of them winning. The winner was a very good one in the end. I consider this a middle season, probably ranked in between 10-20 of the 31 seasons. I just wish they had packed the discs better.",1453593600,,1429,4.412878787878788

1536696,5,B00005JOAP,"I love Survivor especially the older seasons (not so much the newer seasons since they are all manufactured and keep using the same contestants over and over again). I was a little nervous about ordering a dvd that was Manufactured On Demand since I worried about it being a boot leg copy per say. This is not the case with this dvd set. All the episodes played fine, no skips, and the audio quality was good. This is a really made well set and it arrived a day early for me to enjoy a little sooner. I was so impressed with the packaging and quality of this Survivor Thailand (season 5) dvd set that I just ordered Survivor Amazon (season 6). Way to go Amazon.com for making such a good dvd set. I will be buying all the older seasons in the near future!!",1441584000,,756,4.256944444444445

1536700,4,B00005JOAP,Love! Only problem was that the DVD kept skipping and made it very difficult to keep watching due to my frustration at it skipping and pausing and removing speech here and there.,1434758400,,178,4.59375
1536701,3,B00005JOAP,Love all of the Survivor episodes.  The quality of some of the dvd was bad.  We had to skip entire sections to get through.  I have bought a couple seasons and had the same problem.,1434499200,,181,4.114285714285714

1536869,5,B00005JOAP,"I recently became a collector of Survivor Seasons, starting with my favorites, all the All Star Seasons, then branching out to include seasons that had the most compelling characters. I wasn't sure I even remembered Boston Rob in this one, so it was enjoyable watching him cut his teeth. Most of the great seasons seem to include blindsides, brilliant stratagems and great characters. Early Survivor seasons had a lot more struggling with morality and moral choices. Over time, it has become more acceptable to lie and deceive and reverse alliances because the show has been around a long time. The main feature of Marquesas is a lot of hugging and pathos and characters you end up caring about. I really liked all of them and usually, there's one or two who are annoying. But I got a serious man crush on Kathy, admired Vecepia's quiet and deep faith, felt a lot for Pascal and the General and Shawn, with all his bravado and early laziness. Shawn had a great arc. By the end of the season I felt something that many on the show said. I am going to miss them. This must be why I like all-star shows.",1409184000,,1100,4.532663316582915
1536870,5,B00005JOAP,I loved it.  Great show!  Great season!,1408492800,,39,4.428571428571429
1536871,1,B00005JOAP,"Survivor 5 sucked. This is coming from a fan of the show who owns about 15 seasons, applied for the show twice, and owns a buff. It is never a good thing to cast people who no one can root for. Every cast member is either annoying, sexist, immature, or a houseplant. The winner was a jerk and the sole good, nice, honest, lovable cast member was walked all over by her team (I'm talking about Helen). It's a very disappointing season and I'd only recommend watching it if you enjoy getting pissed off.",1407801600,2,501,4.340425531914893

1536951,3,B00005JOAP,This was early in the series. The challenges were somewhat rudimentary. The whole Gandhia grinding thing kinda creeped me out. Hard to watch. Trainwreck city. But it's worth watching as the winner is typically considered one of the top winners of all time. Controlled the game throughout.,1404086400,,288,5.148936170212766
1536952,4,B00005JOAP,"It was good to see some of the players I knew only from 'All Stars'.  Saying that, the final few players were all just a bit nice for my liking.  Alliances stuck and people got to play with integrity etc, which made for rather ho-hum viewing.  I thought I would be happy with the winner but in the end I realize the person who played the hardest got voted out at #3.  Still a good season though and I'd recommend taking a look :)",1403308800,,429,4.071428571428571
1536953,4,B00005JOAP,"Overall the season was great, one of my favorites in fact. The only reason I didn't give five stars was because of the actual DVDs/case. When I first opened the case, there was a piece broken off and one of the later discs has an episode that skips over a good five or so minutes. Looking past these though I was satisfied and look forward to rewatching it again.",1398470400,,363,4.27536231884058
1536954,3,B00005JOAP,"It doens't have the flashiest rep of 'Survivor"" seasons but it's actually quite solid wiht enough twists and shocks to keep you interested. Quite a few major ""Survivor' firsts also occur, making this an important season, historically.

The set itself has the standard MOD features (extended Exit and Today show interviews).",1397779200,,323,5.333333333333333

My son and I anticipated the arrival of this season and our night was ruined trying all our computers and DVD players only to find the same thing--no tribal council for any episode 2s on the discs, and NO episode 3s. Obviously, the discs are garbage and the show didn't even make it all the way onto them. In the morning, when I have time, I'll have to pack it all up and send it back, waste time on the computer and possibly phone, trying to iron this out.

1537092,5,B00005JOAP,"I saw other reviews where people were complaining of packaging and picture quality??? I have to disagree with them because the picture quality was EXCELLENT and I love the slimmer packaging....5 discs in one case. That is so much better than the packaging of season 1 & 2 (each disc was in a separate case and kept together by a box/sleeve).

I've enjoyed going back through the beginning seasons to see how this show all started. I never watched it back then, but I sure am enjoying watching it now. No commercials and can watch whenever I feel like it. I am able to watch one entire season in a week's time. Season 3 so far is my favorite season of all. I LOVED the views of Africa and of all the wild animals running around. I actually liked the contestants better too. At first Big Tom kind of rubbed me the wrong way, but as the show went on, I became a fan of him.

After viewing each season, I find myself going online and searching the contestants to see how they are doing today and to see how they've aged, or have starred in any other shows since being on Survivor. I found out that Ethan Zohn was diagnosed with a rare form of lymphoma in 2009 and went through two stem-cell transplants. How awful. He was my favorite contestant on season 3.

I really think you will enjoy this season and don't let the negative reviews scare you away about the packaging and the picture quality. I think that if you purchase it new on Amazon (like I did), that the packaging has been improved! They must have gotten the complaints about it.",1373500800,,1536,4.363636363636363

I put 4 stars instead of 5 not for the season by itself but because of the picture/resolution quality.

Poor DVD quality, 4/3 resolution. Does not really fit  a 201x 16/9 - 42"" screen.
This was very good in 2002 but now, in 2013, the TV screens have evolved to bigger sizes and resolution (Plasma, LCD, etc.) and a remastering of the image wouldn't be a big luxury.

1537312,5,B00005JOAP,"I have always thought Africa was the most underrated Survivor season. Its location was beautiful, unique and interesting. Not that islands are bad, but they all seem more or less the same. I'm disappointed that Mark Burnett has said and seems to be sticking to his vow that they would not return to Africa. While all the locations the show has filmed have been ""dangerous"" in their own way, the African savannah is one of the few environments on earth where you will literally and definitely die if you don't show respect for the land and wildlife. The casting wasn't as good as some of the other seasons, but it wasn't as bad as some people are saying. There was very much a ""good vs evil"" feel to the 2 tribes, which may have been intentional or maybe just coincidence. Either way it gave us somebody to cheer for. (or at least against) And of course Africa brought the debut of the tribe switch twist.

Regarding the product itself I must say that I was very pleasantly surprised. After reading several reviews complaining of dirty, scratched, non-working discs, I wasn't expecting a lot but still wanted to have the show on DVD even if the quality wasn't perfect. While it isn't a ""box set"" in the sense that it doesn't come with a cardboard slipcover to hold the cases together, that really didn't matter to me. To be honest I find those covers to be more annoying than useful and often throw them away anyway. And yes, the cover art is the same on all 3 cases but that didn't bother me at all. I suppose some people just like to complain. The discs themselves are good quality and all work in both my Samsung blu-ray player and the DVD drive on my computer. None arrived dirty or scratched. I don't doubt the truthfulness of those complaints, but Amazon seems to have greatly improved their production techniques to the point that those complaints should not influence your purchasing decision. The discs are not like the DVD-Rs that you would buy at the store; they are laser printed with the Survivor Africa logo, disc number and episode names. They look like mass produced commercial DVDs. While I have not watched every episode yet, the picture and sound quality on those I have watched is perfectly acceptable. It is in SD so if you're used to watching stuff in HD you will definitely notice a difference and might find the picture quality disappointing but this season was shot in 2001, well before HD was widely adopted. Not a ton of extra features but it does include stuff like the full exit interview of each contestant after they got voted off as well as their Early Show interview.

In all, the negative reviews here seem to be either nitpicking non-issues for the sake of complaining, or factually inaccurate. (or the problems cited have since been fixed) I definitely recommend this set to any fan of the show. On a side note, the on demand production process had no negative effect on shipping time. I ordered with 2 day free Prime shipping, and the product shipped within hours and arrived the next day.",1337817600,2,3025,4.6103896103896105

The packaging isn't as nice as the original Survivor releases, but if this is how they are doing them now, that's how I'll get them. The season itself was pretty good. My only complaint is that they found a lot of really annoying people for this season. I've been watching since season one, and I don't remember ever having this many people on a single season that I wanted to punch in the face. The winner isn't who I'd have picked on episode one as someone that I'd call an obvious candidate for the finals, but I was satisfied with how this season played out. There were definitely a lot of strong personalities that I still remember and use as models to compare current Survivor contestants too.

 This season, however, was EXTREMELY irritating, and I lost interest in it after my favorite player got voted off. The cast of this season are all a bunch of wimpy, tree hugging hippies, churchy do-gooders, loud-mouthed idiots, or just plain boring. I pretty much hated EVERYONE on the show. The only interesting and likable person I thought, was Boston Rob. The other people they portrayed to be ""villains"" were really pretty boring and not at all interesting or even good at the game. I lost COMPLETE interest after only about 4 episodes, but only continued to watch to see who won because I didn't want to feel like I wasted money.

I HATED this season!! Even pretty just ""OK"" seasons like Vanuatu at least were semi fun to watch in that there were interesting people, even if they were totally inept at playing. This is a season where it seemed like no one was really TRYING to WIN. It was more like they were all sitting around singing Kum By Ya and hugging trees while reading the bible. You'd think you were watching a camping show at some hippie resort. This season SUCKED!!!

I regret buying it, and if you are really curious about it, RENT it. But even then, I don't think that its worth your time watching. Not entertaining at ALL!!! VERY disappointed with this season.

Also, don't be hatin' on my review just because you don't agree with me, this is just a warning to regular fans who may have a passing interest and not ""die hard"" fans of the show.

The packaging is very professional. High quality discs, cases and finally more than 2 episodes on every discs. Only 5 discs for all 15 episodes! This is a great value and I would definitely put it on your Christmas list!",1321574400,,911,5.033112582781457
1537521,3,B00005JOAP,"As a superfan of the show, I'm really happy to see the release of Survivor Thailand.  However, this season is Jeff Probst's least favorite season for a reason.  The challenges were great, the location was great, the music was great, Jeff was great, BUT the cast was not.  This is one of the most BORING casts of all time.  With the exceptions of Helen, Ken, and Shii Ann, I think that most of this cast we could have done without.  The Ted and Ghandia thing was a little ridiculous, Robb Z was ridiculous, Clay was just awful, and Jan was one of the stupidest players the game has ever seen.  And on top of all those negatives, the winner, not saying who, just has a cake walk to the end.  It does have its moments though, the fake merge, the lost boat, all of Helen's confessionals were great.  I would say if you like Survivor and have yet to see it, buy it.  Just don't expect a great season or great bonus features.  No commentaries :( No updates on the players, its pretty bare.",1321488000,2,983,4.293478260869565
1537522,3,B00005JOAP,"Survivor Thailand got a bad rap...I don't why people disliked this season so much. The right guy won and there was major drama once it started moving along. If you go back and watch the earlier seasons the casts really had no idea what to do. Brian Heidik really set the bar playing these people like a fiddle he set the trend to play this as a game with strategy  manipulating, lying, and outwitting the others. He controlled the game in every aspect after the merge and made sure he brought Clay with him to the final knowing that everyone was annoyed with Clay and the victory was in his pocket. He was the first to think about who to bring with him the the final and everyone followed that in post seasons. Now the silly drama let's see the whole Ghandia and the guy (forgot his name)thing where she felt uncomfortable around him accusing him of making advances at her was hilarious and who could forget Robb getting stung by the jellyfish and crying like a baby. Clay bold outlandish mysoginy and how much it got under Shi Ann's skin classic! Go back and watch this season again it was entertaining.",1321228800,,1104,4.465346534653466

I also noticed how much of the cast has a southern accent (especially Jan, Clay, and Penny.  Despite this the season really did well.  Robb was funny, Brian was evil, and the cast was LIKABLE!!

These earlier seasons are perfect for a fan because you can't find a season like Thailand in better quality or with the extra features you get with this anywhere else.  It's perfect quality and great to rewatch these old seasons and compare them to what the show is now.
You get CBS interviews and extended exit speeches.  A few other extra videos...more than worth the buy.
The fans need to throw the cash down and keep these releases coming because if they stop because of poor sales this time we can pretty much count on never seeing the rest of the series released.",1320451200,,686,4.524193548387097

1537527,5,B00005JOAP,"I know Survivor: Thailand has this stigma attached to it amongst Survivor fans as a poor season and ask me a few years ago and I'd have to agree. However, years on I have come to appreciate it a lot more and would definetely count it amongst the underrated seasons now. I am very pleased to finally see it released on DVD.

In a world where Survivor is now so gameplay orientated and editing has degenerated into showing only a handful of people each season, rewatching Thailand is a breath of fresh air. It may have quite a few unlikeable players and a predictable endgame, but the episodes hold up remarkably well because it's packed full of those amazing character moments and camp life moments that go largely ignored nowadays. Jan's pet cemetary, Helen's birthday celebrations, the Chuay Gahn guys playing golf on the beach, Sook Jai bonding after so much fueding etc. etc. etc. Thailand is a testament to how well Survivor used to be produced compared to today. You only have to compare it to Redemption Island to see that even the bad seasons back then are still worth watching.

Now when it comes to the DVD's, I am pleased to see the number of disks has been downsized (Thailand is 5 discs all in one case) without any real noticeable dip in quality. Plus the bonus features aren't bad for a season that's about 9 years old now. Overall, I'm very happy with my Survivor DVD's as usual and really hope there are more to come in the future after Amazon finally gets its much anticipated release.",1319673600,9,1502,4.559259259259259

However, I was VERY UPSET that the discs froze or refused to load. I have had to return them and hopefully the replacements will work appropriately. Even with the inconvenience, I wait expectantly for the replacement and for more seasons to be released.",1319673600,2,527,4.739130434782608

After reading some of the other reviews I became a bit skeptical, because of the lack of case, the quality issues people had talked about, the fact that they looked pirated, etc. After receiving my Survivor: Africa DVD, I can say that not one of those complaints rang true. The three DVDs are packaged individually, which I agree that I would definitely prefer them to come in a box set like the others, but that is far from a deal breaker for me. The DVDs are packaged with artwork on each case, every disc itself has the Survivor DVD logo on it, the quality is superb, there are tons of bonus features, literally no different from the retail box sets such as Australia, Borneo, All-Stars, or Pearl Islands. The only other complaint I would have is that I wish there were more than two episodes per disc, simply because I tend to have Survivor marathons and watch several episodes at once, and it can be a pain having to change the disc out after every other episode, but that is one small and trivial problem compared to all of the great things this DVD has to offer.

1537591,4,B00005JOAP,"I haven't seen the Africa season since it first aired in 2001 and am surprised now to find that it was really one of the better seasons of Survivor.  The cast was great; in age, they ranged from early 20s to mid-50s with a wide mix of personalities and backgrounds, and the tribes seemed to be put together with some thought as to how conflict might arise naturally (for example, putting ultra-conservative Frank and openly gay Brandon together on the Samburu tribe) but without the gimmicky men vs. women or old vs. young divisions of later seasons.  The setting was gorgeous.  Set in Kenya's Shaba National Reserve, the animals living in the reserve were an integral part of the season.  The tribes had to take precautions to guard against animals coming into their living area and there were often encounters with elephants, cape buffalo, and lions; in addition, there's a lot of footage of giraffes, zebras, baboons, and other animals living within the reserve.  Immediately after the season ended, Mark Burnett said that they would no longer be doing Survivor in an non-beach environment since the audience hated it, although that's hard to understand given how really interesting and pretty the setting was here.  (Also, it turned out to be untrue since just three seasons later they were in the Amazon and have since done several seasons in a jungle setting.)

For the most part, this is old school Survivor.  Two tribes of eight people each, competing each week for reward and immunity.  No hidden idols, no exile island, no redemption island, no returning previous players.  The one twist introduced this season was the shuffling of tribe members before the merge, and the scrambling and subsequent ousters that resulted from that were hilarious and well-deserved.  A brief immunity run at the end led to an unexpected final two, a jury that was only bitter enough to be entertaining but not hateful, and a reasonably deserving winner.  All in all, a good season.

Other reviewers have mentioned the quality of this DVD set since it's manufactured-on-demand, but I can say that I had no problems playing the disks on either a 7-year-old DVD player or a new player purchased this year.  One person mentioned that his disks were dirty and scratched; mine were not dirty although some of them had odd scuff marks on the playable side and a small shallow horizontal scratch, which must have resulted from the production process since the scratch was identical on three or four of the disks.  None of that affected playability, however.  All the disks played without skipping or freezing.

The picture and sound quality are both very good.  A few minor complaints:  there are no subtitles, which would be nice to have since the players often talk in whispers (and really any season with Big Tom is going to makes subtitles a necessity even when he's speaking at full volume).  The chapter marks are not set at scene breaks, instead, they're just set at every ten minutes, which makes navigating kind of a pain if you're looking for something specific.  And although it's great to have as extras the Early Show interviews of the most recently booted contestant, the way the interviews are labelled means you'll be spoiled for the second episode on each disk (which is really only an issue the first time you watch).  Also, a box to hold the disk cases together (there are nine disks in three separate disk cases) would be nice.  Minor complaints aside, I'm really glad to have more seasons out on DVD and I won't hesitate to purchase the manufactured-on-demand sets in the future.",1314576000,3,3583,4.847290640394089
1537592,3,B00005JOAP,"Alright, this review is both what the product will be, and the season itself.  If you know anything about Survivor, you know that Thailand is...bad.  Arguably the worst season ever, though it's generally agreed Survivor Fiji takes that prize.  That being said, this one is a contender for multiple reasons.

First, this cast sucks.  Aside from Shi-Ann, Helen ""kick butt"" Glover, and Jake, if these misfits fell into the ocean and drowned, we would loose nothing.  Brian is a brilliant player, but a sleaze-ball.  Clay is a lazy misogynist dick.  Jan is nuttier then a banned foods list at an allergy ward.  And don't get me started on Ghandia.

Second, this season is really boring!  It's kind of like Big Brother 9, or TAR:Family Edition.  People will tell you how bad it is because of a bunch of different things, but they leave out that it's so bad because it's so dull.  The location and challenges are good, but the show is dull and has a layer of sleaze over all of it.

Third, the ending can be seen coming from a mile away.  Since Brian is so much better then the other seven pinheads on his tribe, he's playing everyone and no one can stop him.  The very first vote is an example.  The guy who goes first was one of the strongest and smartest people on the tribe, but he was as smart as Brian.  So he went instead of the girl who had a break-down in the middle of a challenge.  Now just imagine that scenario played out a thousand times.

Finally, this season gave us one of the dumbest twists ever, the fake merge, which resulted in the vote off of Shii-Ann.  It was cruel, stupid, and added nothing to the season.

Now, the DVD's for this season have two episodes on each disc.  Yes really.  Plus the finale (but not the reunion) alone on one.  So you've got three boxes with a ton of discs.  They have a lot of special features, but I'd rather have less discs.",1314144000,10,1872,4.384839650145772
1537593,5,B00005JOAP,"Back in august i wrote a review about how excited i was to see this being released. now that it is available for purchase i thought i would write a review about the product itself...

I was so glad a few months ago to see that Survivor Thailand & Survivor Amazon were finally going to be released on DVD!!! However, I was discouraged to see that it was again going to be another DVD-R (On-Demand Product). I would love to see future releases made as most other DVDs are.

About The Packaging & Make of the Discs...
I was happy that the set came with  only 5 discs in one standard size case, as opposed to the previously released seasons having 3 cases & 9 discs (with only about 2 episodes on each disc and no cardboard sleeve to put the cases in). For this set, Disc 1 has episodes 1-3. Disc 2 has episodes 4-6. Disc 3 has 7-9. Disc 4 has episodes 10-13 & Disc 5 has episodes 14 & 15 (The 2 hour finale & the reunion). Each disc has extended exit interviews and the early show interviews with the contestants as well as a few other specials features.
The discs I received have glossy labels and a purple tint on the other side. The purple tint indicates that these are made ""on demand."" What sucks is that video on DVD-R only last about 10 years due to some complicated way that the discs are made. The weird part is...I ordered survivor amazon at the same time...and the packaging and make of the discs for this set were different. Survivor Amazon comes with 5 discs in a DOUBLE SIZE DVD case with not glossy, but more rough feeling labels on each disc, and the discs do not have a purple tint on the backside but the regular silver color. I still don't understand why Survivor Amazon needs a bigger case when they contain the same amount of discs!?!

About Survivor Thailand ***SPOILER  ALERT***
I know everyone says that this is absolutely or one of the worst seasons of survivor!! All I have to say is...I enjoyed watching this season only because it was my first time watching it. It was more of a relaxed season (There was very little strategy and no big moves). As soon as chuay gaun had the advantage with players after the merge...it was obvious who would be voted in the next few episodes. Even when all of the sook jai members were gone...it was obvious who would go and who would stay. It has very few to no memorable players or moments.

I hope that CBS and amazon.com continue to release more. The only way this would happen is if a good amount of these sets are sold, proving that other seasons would be hot sellers!!! So keep buying these please!!! I know that if more are released...they will probably be done in order of each season...but I hope to see some of my favorite seasons like...12, 13, 15, 16, 17, & 21 be released sooner!!! Hopfully we will see some in late winter or early spring as we did with Heroes VS Villains last year!!

1537675,4,B00005JOAP,"Many of the reviews deal with the season / content itself. I didn't especially like or dislike the winner. Actually, I'm happy for the winner. But I agree with the most outspoken person on the jury that the third place finisher was indeed the most deserving of the grand prize. Two *classic* moments involved the ""arrival of Cleopatra"" and ""Can someone pee on my hand?!"" (Those were just too, too funny - and enough to make this season worthy of purchase.) However, the gushy relationship between a 57 year old man and a 21 year old woman seemed pervy to me at worst and sickening (sweet?) at best. I REALLY disliked those two. (Yeah, I'll give you my USED mint! What an idiot.) The reunion show with Rosie O'Donnell was a bust in my view as well. They need to just keep Jeff Probst for those things - which for most seasons they have done.

But my big issue with this product is the unnecessary number of discs - NINE! Why do they have to put them on so many?! Other seasons like Palau or Vanuatu fit on four discs. That is perfect for a Survivor marathon viewing session because you don't have to get up to constantly change discs. There is no reason that a season of Survivor has to be stretched out onto NINE discs. There weren't that many extras (I don't think) that they couldn't have conserved some discs.

I buy these dvds because I live overseas and I'm also a Survivor fan. So I want all of the seasons that I can get and I want to conserve room in my separate disc folder. I don't see why I should have to allocate nine spaces for a season like this - when four or five would do! But, sadly, this seems to be their new / preferred format.

I had nothing to be worried about.  Survivor Africa ended up becoming one of my favorite seasons, and is in my opinion, the most underated season of all.

1537719,5,B00005JOAP,"Survivor Season 3 Africa on DVD is definetly worth it. I got to relive the classic moments those many years ago when I first saw it on TV. I personally think its the best season followed by Exile Island, then Australia. Least favorite seasons are China and Micronesia. But any Survivor is a good Survivor. The DVD came with a handful of cool special features like the CBS Early Show Interviews and the special premiere episode with past cast aways, an episode which I never saw. And of course I get to see my favorite survivor in action, Frank Garrison. The man played with the most honesty and integrity than any of the others. And our personalities are similar in many ways and I love it when he is 'communicating' with the elephant or when he is put with Brandon in the reward challenge they win. Either way Africa was an amazing season and any fan of Survivor needs to get it.",1299196800,,880,4.438271604938271

The packaging could be better and the fact that there are only two episodes per dvd with no 'play all' option is a little lame. My biggest complaint is the same with every season that has came out though. Why the hell is the winner's picture centered and bigger than all the others on the cover? Some people ARE watching for the first time. On the whole though, it is great to finally feel like a collection that I started building is getting pieces to finish it. The sound and picture are as good as I could hope for. The back of the case said that some music is changed from the original tv airing and I kept listening to hear a difference, but, close enough that I couldn't. If you think this is some bootleg low quality copy, you'd be wrong. If you can deal with extra dvd cases and want to see this season, buy it.",1297728000,,934,4.109289617486339

I hadn't seen AFRICA or MARQUESAS because I really only started being a fan at AMAZON, then went and bought Borneo and Australia when they came on DVD>

What I thought, watching AFRICA, was that it had some of the BEST castaways I'd seen in a season of Survivor so far...
Likeable, not likeable, they were ALL interesting to a certain degree. My favourites, near the end, turned out to be TERESA, KIM POWERS, BIG TOM and ETHAN.

It is rare, I find, that you root for more than one OR TWO people. Or cry (...relax, I was tearing up!) when they get betrayed by a friend or get the boot.

I think a reason for this season being different is mainly the LOCATION. Because of the wildlife (which, in my opinion, RARELY shows up for real on the show...as in comes face to face with the castaways), they are forced to stay pretty much enclosed within their shelter. This is a TOTALLY different social experiment, since there is limited amount of strategizing that can be done.

This may be less enjoyable to some. But I'd rather a REALLY interesting cast, who you love to root for, (or love to hate), than a cast of ignorant, less-interesting people who claim to be master strategists (Hint...Marty - Nayonka - ...List goes on)

I recommend this season because of the cast. They make the show. And the location is stunning and unique...You FEEL the SURVIVOR aspect in this season. It feels real.",1297209600,,1624,4.621527777777778

1537767,4,B00005JOAP,"Survivor: Africa was a fairly decent early season, with not a lot of ""great TV moments"" or twists compared to current seasons because they were still more or less working out the formula.  All I remembered was that Ethan, Lex, and Big Tom were the dominant players.  Still, it had been YEARS since I watched it, and my wife never had, so I took the plunge and tried out the ""produced on demand"" DVD set.  It was definitely worth the price.

The video quality is essentially perfect for its time -- the show is in standard definition, so you'll never get blu-ray quality out of the picture, but I didn't see any problems with it.  There are great bonuses like the full exit interviews with each player and the next-day appearances on talk shows where the players discuss their experiences.  There is a nice ""journey to Africa"" making-of special included as well.

Mostly, I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the package.  I knew it would be DVDRs from the item description, but they came with full silkscreened disc art/labeling and a proper storage case configuration.

Any fan of the show will really enjoy watching (or re-watching) this season -- even though the game was still pretty basic compared to now, the players were interesting and there was real intrigue in how the game played out.  Marquesas is a brutal game location and the players really struggle with the insects, so much so that Jeff Probst has said he will never go back.  And, you get to see the most absurd tiebreaker ever, so much so that CBS changed the rules afterward to avoid ever repeating it.  No spoilers.

When you see the players play the game, and plot against each other, you can't help but to root for them, and chuckle when people you don't like get voted out.

This has a fantastic cast. People you love, and people you love to hate.  Two strong players that stand out are Kathy and Boston Rob. It's easy to see why they were brought back to for All-Stars.  I also liked to see how the different people bonded together.

The day they arrived was a great day for this Survivor fan. I must say for a Createspace DVD set (something I hadn't heard of before), they've exceeded my expectations. The packaging is excellent and the footage is of as high a quality as the previous sets. Unfortunately, there's no commentaries from the contestants like on past releases, but the extras more than make up for that. Besides, Marquesas is a fantastic season which can stand on its own and still be a worthy release. I advise all Survivor fans out there to get this season, as you won't be disappointed.

I'm very thankful that CBS has finally released these episodes on DVD so that fans can watch them without having to go one of the illegal routes.  I question the need for nine discs when other seasons need far fewer for the same number of episodes plus extras (more on the extras later), including such obvious padding that the penultimate episode, the finale, and the reunion are on three separate discs, but I have missed this season so much that even if each episode had been given its own disc, I would still love it.

Unfortunately, all you're really getting is the episodes.  Yes, technically, extended ""final words"" footage and Early Show interviews are extra, but they're almost never interesting.  For other seasons, CBS has invited players back to record commentary tracks, which I love.  The commentaries really give the viewer a look behind the editing to see what really went on, and I was especially looking forward to, say, what the players who so self-righteously refused to admit being part of an ""alliance"" think about the complete lack of moral judgments on alliances eight years later.  This season introduced the purple rock tie-breaker that has terrified players ever since.  I would love even a quick ten-minute set of interviews with survivors, Probst, Burnett, or just about anyone else who wants to put some thought into the impact of this season after nearly a decade.

These are released separately as if they're in Volumes 1, 2 and 3, making up the season.  It's just a small complaint, but overall, I'm very happy because the quality of the DVDs is excellent.  As long as it's taken for CBS to release another season of Survivor, I'm happy they came out with these 2 seasons.  Hopefully, they'll do the rest since they've only released 8 of the 20 complete seasons of Survivor to this point.  Maybe that'll depend on how the sale of these 2 seasons go.

There was so little strategy by these contestants, so little drama, so few heroics, and certainly no memorable villains.  Neither of the final 2 really seemed very deserving (in terms of controlling the game or in terms of dominating challenges).  The whole season was just very ""meh"" in hindsight.

At any rate it is still great to finally be able to collect the unreleased seasons.",1286582400,4,536,4.37
1537972,5,B00005JOAP,Thank you CBS for finally releasing Survivor Africa.  It was one of my favorite seasons.  I was really sad after it aired on tv that it was never released.  I even called from my house in Virgnia to California to CBS and asked why it wasn't released.  i was given the reason that they did not feel it would sell that well.  I beg to differ.  I look forward to purchasing this.,1286496000,2,376,4.152777777777778
1537973,4,B00005JOAP,"Well, if you're a diehard fan of Survivor like I am then you have probably waited a long time to see Survivor: Africa be released on DVD. Now that it's out I can say that for the most part I am satisfied.

There are a couple of exceptions though. Basically I consider the release of Survivor: Vanuatu to be the end of the first era of Survivor DVD sets. Those DVDs were packaged in compact cases and even came with a nice cardboard sleeve to put them all in. This set comes in 3 regular-sized plastic cases (talk about wanting to be more environmentally friendly) marked Part 1, Part 2, Part 3, etc. and does not have the box/sleeve. Makes it kind of difficult to organize things.

But the main disappointment, more than anything else, is the lack of what I consider to be the quality bonus features that were included on the previous DVD sets, most notably the commentaries, which I enjoyed immensely. They provided so much insight to the things that we don't see on TV. On these DVD sets, all we have as far as bonus features go are the full versions of the Tribal Council confessionals of each contestant, as well as their subsequent appearances on The Early Show. There's also a little video clip that basically is of a shot of the Tribal Council area at daytime. And that's it. No commentaries, no DVD exclusive interviews with the contestants, or anything you came to expect from the previous Survivor DVD sets.

On the plus side though I am happy to say that the overall quality of the DVDs seems to be about what we'd expect, also I am happy to say that they do play on my computer's DVD player (something that it said that they wouldn't do in the description on the main Amazon page).

So, aside from the minor disappointments, I am satisfied, and this is a must-have for any diehard Survivor fan.",1286409600,10,1806,4.463636363636364

Even though this particular season wasn't one of my favs, it still had a lot of good memorable moments (except for the winner)! Kathy was great the whole season.
I have been waiting years to buy this, and now that it is finally for sale...I find myself being reluctant to make the plunge for the DVD-R version. Do I get a nice box set with the castaways' pictures...doubt it, are there tons of extra features and behind the scenes footage...don't know.
I really want to, but don't know what to expect...

I have thought about trying to Audition for the show, and even used it as motivation to lose 100lbs.

Because I have a strong respect for copyright laws, I have never watched the pirated copy I have right here in my house.  But when CBS keeps putting off the release date, the temptation grows stronger.

Last time I checked here on Amazon, there was a release date for late February this year.  Now there's no tentative release date at all.  I don't know what the reason is for stringing us along like this, but I'm royally disgusted.",1179100800,4,688,4.456

Holding back season's three thru six of Survivor only encourages not only the production, but the purchase of the very thing they say they want to avoid.  Perhaps they should put their DVD sniffing dogs to work on Mark Burnett's bank account and find the real reason CBS is holding back the release of these much sought after season's.

Also, Africa had one of the stronger positive messages...when the reward challenge visitors went to visit an orphanage, it wasn't the sort of forced ""ethnic interactions"" that recent seasons have staged (the Cook Islands, anyone?).

This was one of the HARDEST Survivors ever. Why? Yes, they had food, rations, (that stopped Survivor four), but they had no Water. Both Samburu and Boran had muddy watering holes where Elephants frequented frequently (lol). It had (to date) harder challenges, lions and other animals came dangerously close... It was real and exciting.

The first ""twist"" came here (the switching of the tribes). The Survivor that we all know and love, betray your teammates so you can get further, but basic morals still shine through. We still had the loyal inner sanctum (The Boran Boys of Ethan Lex and Tom). We had the first major boo-boo mistake by Jeff Probst, later rectifed.

So with the amazingness of this season, WHY on earth are we still waiting for? I am tired of Paramout releasing the later seasons of Survivor, ones that is still fresh in our minds. Survivor is more something that Survivor fans purchase than other people, so I speak for a lot of fans when I wish they would now go in order. Several shows have a season come out every 4 months.

Firstly, I think that whilst the competitors didn't think the location was good, as a TV viewer, I thought it was great because it was different from all the other series where there is either a beach or a river.  Secondly, I loved the mix of people and the mix of age groups.  The dynamics of everyones personalities mixed together was great.  Ethan of course was my favourite regardless of the outcome, because it was refreshing to have a genuine nice guy out there, and the way he got along with every other player was so nice to watch.  Lex was a surprise favourite of mine too.  It shows why prejudice is so bad.  I thought I'd never like someone like him, because he'd be so different than myself.  But in fact with his fantastic personality and sense of humour and overall niceness, I ended up loving him.
