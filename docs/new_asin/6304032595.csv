I've been told that it simply isn't as good as the book, but that's not a fair comparison.  This film actually  serves to compliment the book by really making you think about the depth of  the characters -who they are in the book, who they are in the film and who  they are in our very own lives.  It's hard to put into words how good a  film this is, but it can only serve to make you enjoy Hugo's great work  even more.  It's rare to ever find a film that can make you cry because  you're happy and sad at the same time.  Buy it.",932601600,5,638,3.984126984126984

760636,5,6304032595,"Beautiful 1995 adaption of Les Miserables (the book, not the play) set in Nazi occupied France during WWII.  First heard of it via Siskel & Ebert, who both loved it and bemoaned that it did not have wide theatre release in the US. Rumor was that it withheld from Oscar competition by the French because it portrayed collaboration with the enemy. It is one of my favorite all-time movies and almost impossible to find in the US except for video streaming on Amazon. All French (hey, it is set in France) with English subtitles. The adaption is loose and the only specific LM reference is that Jean Valjean-like character portrayed by Belmondo has been told my friends that he reminds them of Jean Valjean. But all the the LM characters are there, even the minor ones, and it is fun to try to spot them as they are not obvious. this is a movie that stands the test of time!

In this film, the story has been recast into the time of the Second World War. One of the greatest of all French movie stars, Jean-Paul Belmondo takes on the role of the hero of the story, Jean Valjean. Belmondo is perfect in the role of a working class hero, and of course, Nazis and their collaborators make great villains.

This is a bit lighter than some versions of the story, but it is true to the original.

An epic film with grandeur, passion, brilliant acting, and consummate story telling - all come together like fine silk in ""Les Miserables"" (1995, in French; directed by Claude Lelouch; staring a superb cast led by Jean-Paul Belmondo as Henri Fortin and Jean Valjean). The sun rose again on Victor Hugo's classic novel; the screenwriter, Lelouch himself, has mastered the art of film adaptation meshed with stunning cinematography and scene frame-up, natural settings, scene and story transitions from one beautifully-distilled reality to another. Time is not lost on either story; crescendo, decrescendo, and denouement are so richly-textured within the film - that these qualities somehow transcend the limitations of traditional cinema. In the end, Lelouch, Belmondo, and a cast of stellar performers (the silver lining in any movie) accomplish a superior feat of visual story telling. Quite remarkable how Lelouch kept the precise, complementary balance between Fortin, Valjean, and the other characters. All unities of plot, character, time, place, and theme were heavenly present.

Highly recommend this motion picture as a most serious classic within its genre. Remarkable attributes only add to its artistic finishing touches.

Nella fine, Lelouch, Belmondo ed un lancio di esecutori stellari (l'argento che riveste in qualunque film) realizza un'azione superiore di storia visuale che dice. Abbastanza eccezionale come Lelouch ha tenuto l'equilibrio preciso, complementare tra Fortin, Valjean e gli altri caratteri. Tutte le unit di complotto, il carattere, il tempo, il luogo ed il tema erano dei presenti celesti.

760687,5,6304032595,"I still remember when I watched this movie for the first time so long ago, I remember I had good expectations for it but never thought those expectations would be so highly exceeded, normally is the other way around, is easier for a movie not to be as good as I'd like, but in this one you're transported to a different form of filmaking, storytelling, and it all falls into place so flawlessly you may end up believing that kind of harmony is easily achieved, but I haven't seen it very often, maybe its me but I think this movie is one of a kind.

  There are other great reviews here so I don't have much to add but my own opinion, the other thing is I WOULD LOVE to get the DVD for this one, I have it on VHS but my VCR has died and I don't want to buy one just for this movie, I haven't found it online either so if anyone has a hint where to find it please let me know. I really want the DVD, Blu-ray or Digital service that could rent it or buy it.

Thanks

Update: I'VE GOT THE DVD !!!!!
Even though its in french and I don't speak any, I still love watching this film, I may be on my way to learning the language.

you will need to be somewhat familiar with the Hugo novel of Les Miserables to connect the names, similarities and allusions in this movie but it is a masterful weaving of a larger story which shows how one theme can exhibit itself in so many lives and take so many forms.  Belmondo plays multiple roles so it is important that the viewer realize which time in history they are watching, whether the original novel, the father, or son.  it does not deserve an 'R' rating by today's relaxed standards.

This movie is outstanding with the story by Victor Hugo being read as the vehicle for a riveting story about the French occupation by the bouch (Nazi's).

Its almost 3 hours but they do not drag and you are left not disappointed.  The end is necessary gentle after a sometimes harsh journey through the life of a man, who seems destined for bad look.

I was torn between 4 and 5 stars, but decided on 4 as the film is not quite perfect (which is not an insult!).  Un Long Dimanche Des Fiances (A very long engagement) I would give 5 because as well as beautifully shot, attractive, well acted and a great story - it left me with a real sensation of it not being able to be improved.  Les Miserables, maybe due to its length, or just a few minor things i can not put my finger on, just did not quite make it.  But still an excellent film and guaranteed to be better than your average (or even well made) Hollywood flick.

Jean Paul Belmondo is a giant of an actor and in this film he shows us what a tour de force really means. The casting was based on acting ability rather than star power or aesthetic appeal.
The adaptation is fantastic. I am a high school history teacher and use this piece in my world history and have seen 280 lb jocks reduced to tears by the moving storyline.",1192752000,,525,4.313131313131313

Belmondo is a retired boxer, who despite the countless punches received during his career has not the human condition and tries the best he can in order to save a desperate Jewish family in the WW2.

A film that really transcends the well known anecdote, and that obligates to rethink the human misery is always present,but wears different clothes.

Jean Paul Belmondo's performance, while breath-taking is well and truly matched by the incredible ensemble cast's performances. The beautifully measured pace of the film and the exceptional story telling transported us through every emotion possible and left us not only wanting to live better lives, but with a shared experience that cemented our friendship forever.

That's the power of great story telling.

I rank this film as among the best ever made and can not recommend it highly enough to others, seeking to experience its rare riches.

ps. Of course, all good stories end with the morals firmly in place - For me, Les Mis's is ""Be True""  -  Oh.... and the girl is now my wife and we will be celebrating the tenth anniversary of our Les Mis outing in a few days.

UPDATE: The quality and power of this film notwithstanding I can't express my sadness and disappointment vigorously enough to learn that it is NOT available on DVD or BLU RAY with English - utterly ridiculous .... to deny so many people the chance to enjoy the film in its fullness because of this is just plain dumb.

It opens with a scene of a gorgeous, turn-of-the-century ball, a robbery afterwards, and wrongful imprisonment. Quickly fast forward to WWII France, the Resistance and the awful plight of the Jews. Jean-Paul Belmondo is a truck driver whose decent heart leads him to hide some Jews, and his quiet courage and strength as the Nazis try to find out his secrets are amazing. As he is driving one of the Jewish escapees to freedom, the man regales him with the story of the Hugo novel, which he has never heard. The twists and turns of the story are truly bizarre and horrifying, but amazingly Claude Lelouche has made a movie of hope. The film ends with a reprise of the gorgeous ball in a very different setting. One can only sigh with satisfaction.

This is one of the most moving films I have ever seen. It got scant notice at the time, perhaps because it wasn't dubbed from the French (thank god!) but the subtitles didn't bother my husband at all, and he's hard to please. Jean-Paul Belmondo has a gorgeous, rugged, weathered, expressive face--truly a wonderful actor. The plot is riveting, the music gorgeous--what more can I say?",1142208000,4,1262,4.710407239819005

That would be the 1978 w/ Perkins, Jordan, Gielgud, Holm, etc.  If you get that you have to get the full-length VHS version.

 This is neither a movie based on the book or the broadway musical; it is not merely a retelling of Hugo's novel in modern times- it is a beautiful masterpiece that follows a period of time filled with fear, ignorance, oppression, suffering, miserable ones, war, greed, and betrayal. We follow the story of Henri Fortin (Jean Paul Belmondo), whose father died while trying to escape from a prison that unjustly sentenced him based on appearances. Henri Sr. was the driver of a man who commited suicide, and the police assumed that Henri Sr. killed the man. His wife, much like Fantine in the book, does everything she can to raise money for a lawyer, making her son Leopold, who she now calls Henri, work to raise money. She is forced into prostitution. Henri Sr. dies on an attempt to escape, so the wife kills herself. Henri Jr. starts a boxing career, and World War I ends. However, peaceful times never come because soon comes World War II. The Jews are being betrayed by all their friends. Henri is called a Jean Valjean because many people feel that his life parallels that of Jean Valjean. He helps a family of Jews travel towards Switzerland and gets their daughter into the Academy of the Sacred Heart for safety. As they drive they read him Les Miserables since he cannot read or write. He is amazed at the story and feels that Les Miserables can be applied to any situation in life. He starts seeing parallels to Cosette and Valjean.

 It is a beautiful story that will surely make you cry! It is in French and has subtitles. I don't speak French but I had no problem with it. I read quickly and I had to rewind a couple of times because the subtitles go by so quickly, but that was no problem for me! I highly recommend this video if you want to see how Les Miserables is so true in today's world and is still a masterpiece. It is a wonderful movie! There is lots of violence in it, so it's not necessarily for younger viewers. it is beautifully done. I only hope they come out with a DVD version in the future with commentary and extras!

The piano music is so dramatic and appealing to the situations.  Is the piece the German fellow plays a Mahler composition?  Sounds like Mahler.  Email me if you know! :)

The plight of La Resistance as well as the Jews is artistically  overlapping in betrayal, greed, and especially rage.
Most importantly, for me, is the urge to simply cry.  The pathos in this film are so common and low that anyone could empathize with the characters.  But, in their misery, they lived a life of perpetual memory making.  We should be so lucky to have a such a meaningful existence as the ones who have died and fought to keep their lineage alive.",1059177600,5,769,4.610294117647059

760887,5,6304032595,"Carried on the winds of fate, injustice often settles upon the poor and downtrodden, whose only link to salvation may lie in the truth they carry in their hearts and the manifested courage of their convictions.  And sometimes that quest for justice and truth must be mounted against all odds, as in this 1995 version of ""Les Miserables,"" written for the screen and directed by Claude Lelouch.  An imaginative retelling of the Hugo classic, Lelouch updates the story to the Twentieth Century, beginning with the stroke of midnight that ushers in the New Era.  It's an inauspicious beginning of a new year for Henri Fortin (Jean-Paul Belmondo), however, as he becomes a victim of circumstance and is convicted of a crime he did not commit.  As he goes off to prison, he leaves behind a wife and a young son (also named Henri), who must fend for themselves as best they can.  It leads to a miserable existence for all concerned, but steels the young Henri for what is yet to come, and he quickly learns that when things seemingly cannot get any worse, they not only can, but do.
 Ultimately, this becomes the story of the young Henri, whom we next encounter at the end of World War I.  Now a boxer, he is soon to become a contender.  By 1931, however (when we next meet him), that part of his life is behind him as well, and he has become a furniture mover; and with his own truck, he is able to at least make a passable living.  But at this point, we are introduced to Andre Ziman (Michel Boujenah) who has just met the soon-to-be Mme Ziman (Alessandra Martines), who by the beginning of the Second World War are destined, along with their young daughter, Salome (Salome), to become an integral part of Henri's (also played by Jean-Paul Belmondo) life.
 Henri, like his father, is illiterate; and when circumstances bring him together with the Ziman's, he is inadvertently introduced to Hugo's novel, and soon begins to realize how his own life parallels that of, initially, Cosette, and later-- and most significantly-- Jean Valjean.  When they end up taking a journey together, Henri implores Ziman to read the story to him as they travel.  And it's as if in the words of Hugo and the life of Jean Valjean, Henri discovers within himself all that is good and worthwhile.
 Lelouch has crafted and delivered a poignant version of the familiar tale of injustice and perseverance that borders on the profound.  By interspersing scenes of the Hugo story as they are being read to Henri (in which Belmondo is Jean Valjean), we see the parallels being drawn even as they become clear to Henri.  The film is fraught with irony and succinctly captures the essence of Hugo's novel; it's as if Lelouch had been possessed of Hugo's spirit when he wrote the screenplay, as well as later when he brought his vision to fruition, the finished product of which has to rank among the best interpretations of the story ever.
 The supporting cast includes Annie Girardot (Farmer's Wife), Philippe Leotard (Farmer), Clementine Celarie (Mme Fortin), Philippe Khorsand (Javert), Nicole Croisille (Thenardiere), Rufus (Thenardier), William Leymergie (Toureiffel) and Micheline Presle (Mother Superior).  An emotionally engaging, riveting drama that will sweep you up and carry you away, ""Les Miserables"" is a tale of dignity and courage, and of what it takes to overcome betrayal and injustice.  But even more than that, it's a study of morality; of right against wrong and of good that in the end must triumph over evil.  A superior cinematic rendering of the classic story, this film-- especially for those to who love the novel-- is not to be missed.",988156800,13,3629,4.796147672552167
760888,5,6304032595,"Claude Lelouch's audacious and exciting epic is neither a film version of the long-running musical nor a traditional adaptation of Victor Hugo's classic novel. Rather, it is a sweeping and sensationally passionate drama that succeeds brilliantly on its own merits as a celebration of storytelling (and, of course, moviemaking) as inspiration and illumination. A magnificently ravaged Jean-Paul Belmondo plays Henri Fortin, an ordinary man whose life spans an extraordinary period in French history: Born at the turn of the century, he lives long enough to endure the cruelties of the Nazi occupation. Rootless and illiterate, he is introduced to ""Les Miserables"" at an early age -- in a silent movie! -- and embraces Jean Valjean as his hero, mentor and alter ego. So much so, in fact, that Henri agrees to help a Jewish family escape from Paris, setting into motion a fateful series of betrayals, reconciliations, reversals of fortune and triumphs of the spirit. There are images in ""Les Miserables"" that are as hauntingly beautiful as any in the history of cinema. And there are entire sequences that are nothing short of astonishing. Lelouch is one of the few contemporary filmmakers who remains capable of the grand romantic gestures that made many of us fall in love with movies in the first place.",986860800,5,1303,5.093457943925234

It was the first movie ever to make me cry, every single one of the five times i've seen it.  Any every time I see it, I understand it more deeply.

760890,5,6304032595,"This original interpretation of Hugo's story well told deserves its own recognition as a work of art. Here are the details why:
First, because it tells a great story. While recounting Hugo's original story to an illiterate man, this director manages to incorporate him and us into the human condition. The director is well aware that he is retelling a story, one of the two or three that all humans live, and that we each know a sheltered Cosette, a dashing Marius, a self righteous Javert, a hideous Thenardier and noble Jean Valjean.
Second, the director uses his medium to the upmost. Gone are the broad strokes of stereotyping the characters, melodramatic music cues or the constraints of an ""adaptation"" of a novel to a 120 minute film. Instead, we get real people with real conflicts, overlapping dramatic renditions of original and familiar musical scores and, especially on the wide screen, grandiose framing shots of the French countryside and beach. Each added detail helps the audience feel the human condition.
Lastly, the experienced director knows his audience well. While the neophyte will certainly enjoy the film for the first two reasons listed above, the accustomed viewer will recognize how the renditions of Hugo flow into anyone's life experience. Its target audience is not the Les Miserables illiterate, quite on the contrary, the movie is produced in French and for French audience that has heard Valjean's story in many ways throughout their lives. He pains in showing details of the many artistic interpretations of Hugo's masterpiece: the ballet, symphonies, early film versions, book editions. Each of these is subsumed into the new work of art that this film is.
This work of art shows that it's the details that count.",978566400,2,1749,5.055363321799308
760891,5,6304032595,"Rarely does a film come along that makes the audiences feel rather than just see its content. This is the only version of Les Miserables worth seeing. Leave the Uma Thurman and Claire Danes version to those of limited  intelligence. Although this version is a variation of the story by Victor  Hugo and is set during World War II, it nevertheless has an uncanny ability  to render the viewer breathless. Its combination of cinematography and  music complements the beauty and treachery of well crafted scenes and the  best acting one will ever see. This film has the ability to take the viewer  into the Second World War, and experience the personal losses and triumphs,  which touch the lives of the main characters. I am not exaggerating when I  say that Les Miserables is a film about beautiful beings-both from literal  and metaphorical standpoints. Les Mis is a perfect concoction of suave,  elegant and rough-edged characters. Each one being from a different walk of  life does not diminish even slightly the fact that they each need one  another as badly as the next.",959817600,4,1074,4.84065934065934
760892,5,6304032595,"This movie is an original work of art and will go down as one of the world's greatest films.
This wasn't Victor Hugo's ""Les Miserables"".  Liam Neeson and gang tried to do that in their  ""adaptation"".  Nor was it a version set in a different time, such  as ""The Fujitive"".
The producers of this film took a fresh  approach - let's see how the life of a 1930's French prizefighter  parallel's the life of Hugo's Valjean.
Frequent references were made as  to how people this man was meeting were like the character's in Hugo's  book.  In fact, one of the things that maintained my interest was trying to  figure out - when new characters were introduced - who they were supposed  to symbolize.
Some may be turned off by the length of the film - I  believe it is close to 4 hours.  However, the story and the characters are  so strong, that the time will pass quickly.

I missed the others's comments about the CC IN ENGLISH not being provided and it is a HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT that it does not have CC IN ENGLISH, SPANISH HOWEVER NOT IN ENGLISH.

At this point I am not sure what I am going to do, HOWEVER I AM SHARING HERE WITH MY REVIEW MY GREAT DISAPPOINTMENT!!! I enjoy movies and EVEN MORE GREAT MOVIES. I have a number of films from around the world AND EVERY ONE HAS ENGLISH IN ITS' LIST OF SUBTITLES, EVEN A WORLD WAR 2 CLASSIC FROM RUSSIA.

Again it is among my all time favorite movies, HOWEVER IT IS NOW AMONG MY ALL TIME DISAPPOINTMENTS THAT SOMEONE LACKED THE COMMON SENSE TO PROVIDE ENGLISH AS A CC OPTION.

I CHECKED THE ZONE AND IT IS ZONED FOR NORTH AMERICA HOWEVER IT ONLY HAS SPAINSH SUBTITLES NOT EVEN THE OPTION OF ENGLISH. THE VHS TAPE CAME WITH ENGLISH SUBTITLES WHY WOULDN'T THE COMPANY KEEP ENGLISH ON FOR SALES IN THE USA AND NORTH AMERICA. We are going to try to return the DVD with a magnifying glass we found THIS DVD WAS PRESSED AND MANUFACTURED IN MEXICO FOR MEXICANS. WHY DOESN'T SOMEONE PROVIDE LIKE THE REST OF THE INTERNATIONAL DVDS WE HAVE A COMPLETE LIST OF LANGUAGE SUBTITLES NOT JUST SPANISH?
