4712905,4,B005JJSGAI,"I've waited like everyone else to see this band live. The music is great, but I thought the filming was not very good. It is too dark, sometimes you can't see the band, the 1 or 2 second showing of the players is too short. This is not a music video but a live show, couldve been a lot better.",1321401600,2,293,3.9
4712906,5,B005JJSGAI,"been watching some concerts on the television (neil young, david gilmour) and i happen to come across part of this broadcast.  intrigued, i recorded it and was simply blown away.  raised on grateful dead, allman brothers and classic rock and roll, but always leaned towards led zepplin more than deep purple, sabbath, etc.  once i saw the recording, i haven't stopped watching it and i am anxiously awaiting the blue ray. don't be fooled by others comments...this is true, un-adultered rock and roll that will kick your (blank).  crack a beer, crank the volume and prepare yourself.  gives me a new venue to start exploring what else each of them has done.  hopefully they will go on tour in the usa and they can stop by and share a couple brews with me.",1321056000,,754,4.631578947368421
4712907,5,B005JJSGAI,"This band keeps growing on me more and more as I listen. I own both CD's but was worried the DVD would be something thrown together just to say they have a DVD..But I was wrong, sound quality and Video are outstanding!! If you liked 70's rock you will love these guys!",1320451200,,268,4.173076923076923
4712908,5,B005JJSGAI,"This is a great group...terrific show...
and cool bonus features on the second disc ...a strong value for money!

It is not 1:33 aspect ratio as amazon.com states which is old 4x3 full screen, but sadly its also not the current 1:78 or 1:85 but the older movie extreme widescreen ratio of 2:35 which means even with current state of the art widescreen tvs we will either have to crop image or have dead space at the top and bottom... sorry if this seems picky it just seems odd that when the world has standardized on a widescreen size they would purposely shoot this format ....

I am a purchaser and have written this after viewing not after reading specs etc.  and again sorry to sound picky but it leaves about 1/4th of the screen black...why waste it?",1320105600,2,756,4.463768115942029
4712909,5,B005JJSGAI,"Great show! Great sound. My VERY minor gripes are that the lighting is a tad dark for my tastes and the guitar could be 10% louder in the mix as well. Both of these issues seem to diminish as the show progresses. The bass sound is awesome with nice definition, and drums sound great too. Hughes & Bonamassa represent the greatest duel -vocalist line up I have ever heard. Jason is playing great here too. Glenn Hughes is an under-rated bassist. He makes it look very easy, and he takes more chances than some bassists. The fact that he can sing so well and play at the same time is amazing.

The DVD is really well done. The editing is not the rapid-fire cuts that are annoying. The director shows the right amount of patience in terms of pacing for the camera angles. There's a nice overhead of Bonham which allows for good views of his fills. This DVD delivers what the band are...a good 70's style rock band with just the right amount of looseness. The extra mini- documentary is very good as well. Overall I cannot imagine someone being unhappy with this piece. *Hughes claims there is no auto-tune or overdubbing on the vocals. Note worthy is how Bonham and Bonamassa do backup vocals. Bonamassa is a GREAT lead vocalist as well and his songs really take on a new life on this DVD. A refreshing example of a hard rock band with no real trickery in 2011.",1320019200,,1358,4.432
4712910,5,B005JJSGAI,"There are alot of guys out there who think they are ROCK STARS, Glenn Hughes however is in fact a Rock Star.  This is a Hot band and nice document of the power of a great band live.  I am always impressed by what Joe Bonamassa does but being alittle too young to remember Glenn's Deep Purple heyday I had never really heard or seen him in his element.  I don't know how old he is now but he still brings it live and in the studio.  Definitely check this out if you are a fan of great 70's and 80's classic ""arena"" style rock.",1319932800,,525,3.9714285714285715
4712911,5,B005JJSGAI,"A must have concert dvd. Innovatively filmed with a blazing soundtrack. I've been a fan of Glenn Hughes' singing and bass playing since his time with British power trio Trapeze and this latest release is amongst his finest work. Joe Bonamassa hits the stratosphere with his guitar playing, and Jason Bonham's drumming is fascinating to watch. Derek Sherinian wonderfully adds all the right textures on keyboards. One word to describe BCCs' performance - Tremendous! It'll rock yer socks off.",1319846400,2,491,5.227848101265823
4712912,5,B005JJSGAI,"If you don't know who they are then you don't know music but
you should order this dvd concert and first two albums now!
Glenn Hughes of Trapeze and Deep Purple and solo work is one
of the greatest singers/writers/bassist of all time. He should
have a bigger audience and same goes for John Bonamassa who is
in the same league as Gary Moore for rock blues guitarist fans!
His solo work is also incredible and deserves a bigger audience.
Together with Jason Bonham on drums and Sheridan on Keyboards
they form a great 70's sounding hard rock band without being
a copy sounding band! No they don't reinvent the wheel but who
can anymore but their sound is original and fresh especially with
every band doing the same exact thing with boring songs and
production. They are all excellent musicians and live are just
unbelievable. If your a big fan of 70's and early 80's hard rock
and tired of listening to the crap that is out there get this now.
The dvd is filmed and directed very well and they rock out!",1319846400,5,1003,4.456521739130435
4712913,5,B005JJSGAI,"Pre-ordered this thru the BCC website and it arrived a day or two ago, ahead of general release... so here's my 2-cent mini-review...

WOW! What a great video document of an outstanding band in their element and a great way to celebrate your support for what rock n' roll should sound like in 2011.

It truly captures Black Country Communion and the essence of the band, from their tour earlier this year and clearly reminds me of the two shows I was in attendance at in the very beginning of their long live run.

I won't go through the songs, as we're all familiar with them, but standouts to make mention of in this package have to include ""Black Country"", ""Crossfire"", ""Faithless"", ""I Can See Your Spirit"", ""Cold"", ""The Outsider"", ""The Great Divide"", ""Sista Jane"" and ""Man In The Middle"".

It truly captures 100% Glenn Hughes vocally, live in 2011, especially on ""Cold"", where emotion pours out of his performance at every twist and turn.

This is how a DVD package should be... hopefully in the future, we can expect another of this quality, but from Glenn solo... that would be the icing on the cake!

It's great to hear both Derek Sherinian and Jason Bonham too - they're both at the top of their game. Although live in the flesh, at least at the gigs I attended, Derek S. was low in the mix, so it's good to hear him included a whole lot more here. What can you say about Joe Bonamassa... a real talent for sure and you get to hear him loud and clear.

I really like the way they cut in between some of the songs, either with scenes from the cities their playing or interview segments. Makes for a real sense that your involved from beginning to end. Oh and the rock doc. is cool too... funny as hell in places... great still shots included in the picture gallery as well.

The only real criticisms I have are that there aren't enough crowd interaction shots and too many close-ups... it would of been good to see a more wider angle during some scenes... but neither of these detract from the overall enjoyment... just be sure to crank your volume to 11!

Roll on a titled... No. 3 ...new album!",1318636800,17,2103,4.441558441558442
4712914,5,B005JJSGAI,"Ordered this from Joe Bonamassa's website and it came in yesterday over a week before the official release. This is the closest I will ever get to see this band live so to me it is well worth the purchase.

4712936,3,B005JJSGAI,"This disc disappoints only in it's production values. The music is pretty fun. The two different singers have very distinct voices. On that note I wish they would have sung together more. In the end I just couldn't get over the Very bad sound . With the Blu-ray format we have the joy of UNCOMPRESSED Dolby and DTS, both of which can sound awesome. And I mean that in it's literal term. This disc sounds more like mediocre Dolby Digital , the compressed format for the old dvd format. I heard much better audio from that old format on concert dvd's like Peter Gabriell's Digging in The Dirt DVD. The sins of this discs audio are of omission. So for some of you just turn up the volume and enjoy . For me ,I'm not so pleased. Some of us have purchased very good equipment because audio is our hobby(or our passion,you know who you are LOL) And we buy concert dvd's because we might not get another chance to connect with that artists music , or we don't enjoy large drunk smoky  crowds. The concert disc ,now that we have these wonderful potentially UNCOMPRESSED recording formats, should be a reference recording of that space and time.
  Here's where we come to this disc's sonic omissions. There is absolutely no sense of the space their in while playing this music. I know live sound can be and usually is awful.  But it is obvious they either removed every last hint of the venues acoustics , or dubbed a very dead studio performance over the video. Speaking of which the video is dvd quality at best, but I'm more of an audio geek than a video. Another omission is any hint of dynamics. You can here the different instruments modulate according to how many of them are playing . The drums are the focus ? They are forceful and immediate like drums should be. But listen to when the other band members join in , the toms fade into the background and the kick drum loses most of the weight it just had.
This kind of thing happens multiple times during the recording. Very disappointing. The three stars are for MR. Bonamassa. I really dig his voice and his guitar playing is a rush. Here's hoping for more pleasure from the live from the beacon theater.",1380931200,3,2156,4.450632911392405
4712937,5,B005JJSGAI,"This DVD is a must have for anyone into 70's and 80's rock. Joe Bonamassa and his band set out to recreate a sound like the days of Zeppelin - and boy did they! You won't know any of these songs, but you'll feel like you do immediately. It's really well shot and a treat to watch. The performances are noteworthy.",1374796800,3,313,4.147540983606557
4712938,4,B005JJSGAI,"Overall, the band is pretty good.  Joe and Jason really play well (especially when Joe is featured).  However, Glenn's nearly constant mugging gets a little old to the point where I thought I was watching ""Spinal Tap"".  I bought this since I loved Joe at the Beacon Theater so I was a little disappointed, but I guess fans of Glenn will like it better than I did.",1371772800,2,363,4.388059701492537

4712944,5,B005JJSGAI,"Since I found out about Joe Bonamassa, he has become my favorite guitar player of all time. I've been around guitars for 65 years and knew one of the best blues players of his time, Roy Buchanann. Whatever Joe plays is golden. Put him with great musicians like Glen Hughes and Jason Bonham, you have a concert that will blow your socks of. Glen's voice is as good now as in his Deep Purple days and Jason has far surpassed his father as a drummer. Why can't these guys be the half time show at the Super Bowl? People would forget the game. Get this DVD.",1361577600,2,553,4.226415094339623

4712947,5,B005JJSGAI,Glenn Huges sings and plays bass like a man possessed with talent! Joe Bonamassa is great and of course Jason Bonham on drums is wonderful. The songs sounds like yesterday's hits today! A great DVD that every fan of rock music should own!,1357862400,,238,4.558139534883721

  What can you say about Glen Hughes, he's never looked or sounded better....and Joe Bonamassa?  This guy will go down in history as one of the hottest guitar players of all time, as he famously says ""everybody has an addiction, this is mine"".  Then there's Jason, the son of a legendary drummer.  His daddy would be proud.  Couple times during one of Joe's outbreaks I got the feeling that the others were working overtime to keep up but not to worry, it is a masterful performance and right to the end they all looked like they were having so much fun doing what they each do best.

4712966,5,B005JJSGAI,"Just discover this band on You Tube, and first i thought it was another Aerosmith, then i listened to the whole concert on Blu-Ray and it's definitely another Led Zeppelin. All songs are good classic rock music with a very energetic bassist-vocalist (Glen Hugues), a gifted guitarist (Joe Bonamassa), and no other than Jason Bonham on drums. Derek Sherinian is on the keyboards to create a interesting atmosphere on the music. The quality of picture is great despite the fact that we see footage from different venues. The DTS Master-audio is decent, not overwhelming with many surround effects. I was surprised by the quality of the music with only 2 cd's on their belt. The performance is what you expect from a good rock'n roll band : enthusiast and focused.

I am glad to have discover this band, and to know that good classic rock band still exist after The Who, Deep Purple and Led Zeppelin. This is a must for those who already know the band, and a good place to start to discover the band.",1326672000,2,997,4.632768361581921
4712967,5,B005JJSGAI,This is a Awesome DVD If you like Glenn Hughes or Jason on drums and Joe on guitar. This DVD rocks and as a Deep Purple fan it's a must have.,1325980800,2,141,3.5806451612903225
4712968,3,B005JJSGAI,"Some of this blu ray makes me nauseous. Way too much distorted imagery and washed out colors that super saturate. Not my system. This was done on purpose. This was filmed at multiple venues in Europe and while the music is for the most part good the 60's acid trip type special effects, warping, out of focus and distorting the video is really really annoying.

Sound quality is good bordering on real good. Though Joe's guitar could have been brought up a few db's.

I like most of what all of these guys have done over the years. They all put in fairly good performances here. But for the most part I'm not even sure why Sherinian even bothers. You'll be hard pressed to know that he's even playing. He's definitely been relegated to filler. Also, Hughes can be kind of a freak and at times you'd swear it's the Glenn Hughes show. Jason Bohnam is a competent drummer and his performance here is quite good.

If you're a Bonamassa fan his live at Royal Albert Hall is FAR superior in every respect. He puts in some great playing here but he's much better off with his own band.

I have both of Black Country's studio CD's and all of Joe's and Derek's stuff. This is a welcome addition and worth having. Just wish they would have done without the cheesy special effects.",1325203200,5,1270,4.437768240343348
4712969,5,B005JJSGAI,"Just finished watching this, really great, but I'm deducting half a star for two reasons.  First because Glenn's bass is strictly deep, deep low end with no mid-range whatsoever, and it leaves a bit of a hole in the sound.  I'm not saying to use as much mid-range as say Billy Sheehan or John Entwistle, but just a little more for definition, and so we can appreciate some of those very tasty licks he plays.  Secondly, Derek Sherinian is way too low in the mix, even some of his solos, and once again it leaves a bit of a hole in the sound, especially when Joe solos.  I think he is rather under-utilized in this group, which is odd considering that Bonamassa has specifically stated that he didn't want a power trio, and yet that's exactly what it sounds like some of the time.  Derek should appear in the mix similar to the level of say Jon Lord or Don Airey in Purple.  Not a huge thing, but something that jumped out at me anyway right away.

Those points aside, this was an extremely enjoyable show (4 venues actually), and as always I'm just in awe of Glenn Hughes' singing.  I'm not sure I would agree with producer Kevin Shirley's statement in the booklet that Joe Bonamassa is ""the finest blues-rock guitar player today"", but he is certainly one of the best and a really good singer as well, and his performance on this Blu-Ray is sensational.

A very worthwhile purchase....buy it.",1324598400,2,1392,4.492063492063492
4712970,5,B005JJSGAI,"This ""Super Group"" rocks down. Being a fan of Hughes and Bonamassa made this one of my favorits DVD concerts. Worth watching more than once.",1324598400,,140,4.64
4712971,5,B005JJSGAI,"Short and Sweet review.  This is a stunning Live DVD.  Like many, many others I'm a huge fan of Joe and Glenn.  Together they rip it up.  Brilliant, just brilliant.  A 110% pure rock n' roll DVD.  DTS sound is stunning and the songs just leap out of my speakers.  Bonzo Jnr pounds the stuffing out of his kit and Derek just stands tall and fills the gaps.  If you like any of these 4 artists at any time in their careers, then pay your money, sit back with a cold beer and enjoy the hell out of it.  :-)",1324598400,3,503,3.95
4712972,5,B005JJSGAI,"Zep & Purp fans won't be disappointed. This BCC music performance is second to none in my collection. I guess I benefit from having seen them live. No concert can obviously beat a live show so if you have a chance to see them, do it. Just wonderful song writing, hard playing from these gifted musicians. If you're a fan of John Bonham's heavy drums you'll really enjoy his kid.

Technically, this blu-ray is good but not as clear or focused as you might expect. The audio is terrific. If you enjoy TOTO, pick up their ""Falling in Line"" concert in blu-ray and compare the two. The TOTO show is one of the best blu-rays I've seen. You can see the coils on Leland Sklar's bass. Outstanding.",1324339200,3,688,4.417322834645669

4712974,5,B005JJSGAI,"Was prepared to be underwhelmed when I saw the lineup. I had never REALLY been a fan of any of these guys, even though I'm a musician, but something about the unlikely mixture just seemed ""right"", so I bought it without even listening to the demos...

And RIGHT is just the beginning of the words needed to describe this set. ""Powerful"", ""Ageless"", ""Beautiful"", ""Loud"", ""Exciting"", ""perfect"", etc., all come to mind. This is Bar Room Rock the way you WANT it to be: loud, with attitude, and all the pretentiousness of ""Spinal Tap"" (via Glen Hughes) but it is just SOOO ""Right"".

As a guitarist, Joe's sound/tone  is absolutely KILLER, and I had no idea how wonderfully buttery his vocals were. He takes Hughes to task on some songs and in fact, probably even has a better vocal ""purity"" than does Glenn, but Hughes has ALL the attitude, despite his age. I really respect that, and it doesn't seem like a ""caricature"" in this setting.

As someone mentioned, the bass guitar is WAAY understated, but that's about the only sonic gripe I have about this DVD. Probably because they were in small venues, and most of the bass guitar was from the monitor instead of the board, and Hughes was using vintage equipment that doesn't have (now) standard ""direct outs"" that would allow a significant remix to  be done without rerecording the bass. And I am SOOO glad they didn't do any rerecording...the flubs are there, just as a live show, even a live show with professionals---that's how you know it BREATHES and LIVES. I wish more people would ""keep it real"" and not try to fix every little thing. The ""American Idol"" Generation has RUINED the ears of the general listening public---""perfect"" doesn't mean ""good"".

If you love vintage rock and roll, or are a fan of any of these guys, or want to hear some GREAT music with just 4 instruments and a lot of attitude, then you've found it.

we need MORE of this kind  of music---it's been MIA. So glad BCC has found it!",1322956800,21,1957,4.603448275862069
4712975,5,B005JJSGAI,"What else is there to say...these guys are great live and the Blu-ray is technically excellent.  The show includes all the best songs from the two BCC albums plus Joe B's ""Ballad of John Henry"" and Deep Purple's ""Burn"".  I can't wait for these guys to tour the US in 2012...I hope.",1322784000,,281,4.384615384615385
4712976,5,B005JJSGAI,"At first, I wasn't sure about getting this. First of all, I wasn't a big fan of their first album (some songs didn't have a good production) with some exceptions obviously, like Song Of Yesterday, Black Country and Sista Jane, for example.

Their second album was much better, with much better production, song writing and better tracks overall: Little Secret (which is one of my favorites and sadly is not on this DVD), Save Me, Hadrian's Wall, I Can See Your Spirit, Cold, Crossfire, and it goes on...

But this Live Release beats them both, this band is much better live, it has an amazing energy on stage and it's entretainment at it's best.
Joe Bonamassa's playing is spot on, not a single note is played wrong, and his solos are top-notch, my favorites being Song Of Yesterday and his own The Ballad Of John Henry, but he delivers at 110% on every song in the set.

Glenn Hughes' bass playing is amazing, being honest I don't know Deep Purple very much so I didn't know who he was, and his singing and playing surprised me a lot, it's quite incredible what he can do being 60 years old!

Jason Bonham rips it too, he has a great rhythmic base and has amazing solos and fill-ups. Derek's a little on the back in the mix, but he has his moments too.

I think the only problem with this DVD is that, during the first verse in the song ""Save Me"", you can clearly see that Glenn is not playing his bass, but you can clearly hear it! Is it playing itself? Is it a loop from the intro? I don't know, I hope it's not an overdub, I hate that crap (AC/DC's Live At Donington is a prime example).*****EDIT: I've just seen a Youtube video from this song played live and Glenn does the same thing, so probably it's just a loop, no overdubs in this*****

And during ""The Battle for Hadrian's Wall"", if you have a good ear, you will notice that Glenn's 1st String is out of tune (tho he doesn't play it that much) but it seems he realized and tuned it cause after a while it's on tune again. But it's no big deal.

Best songs in the DVD in my opinion include: Crossfire, Faithless, Song Of Yesteday, I Can See Your Spirit, Cold, The Ballad Of John Henry, Sista Jane and Burn. But the others rock hard aswell!

I really liked the camera work here, there's some Drum shots that are quite inusual, like the bass-drum shot, which is quite nice. There's also some effects that worked really good, unlike many concert DVDs.
I really don't mind the aspect ratio cause I still have a 4:3 TV so I'm used to it, and even if I had a Widescreen TV, I wouldn't mind, cause it's REALLY no big deal, only spoiled people cry about these things...

I liked that it wasn't just 1 show, cause it shows you that the band gives everything it's got for every gig (or at least, the ones they filmed, haha)

Overall, this is highly recommended for any rock fan, you will want to watch this all over again, I got it yesterday and already watched it twice!

Go for it! And hopes for a 3rd album!",1322697600,,2960,4.296229802513465

If you like Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple, Dream Theater, the Who and other classic rock acts, you'll fall in love with this band instantly. It's rock music the way it's supposed to be- none of the commercial artificial stuff- this is a real rock band and this collection from their European tour showcases their immense talent. The blu-ray itself is really good as well and features DTS- HD sound. I would rate this in the top 5 blu-ray concerts out there.",1322524800,,547,4.591836734693878

4712979,3,B005JJSGAI,"An AllStar band formed by Glenn Hughes.  It features some great ""licks"" by Joe Bonamassa.  Joe is better by himself with his own band in my opinion.  Sometimes a collection of All Stars doesnt quite work.  Hughes is better in Deep Purple and Bonham was better in Foreigner and other projects and, as I said, Bonamassa is better as solo artist with his own backing band.  The quality of his Blu-ray concert at Royal Albert Hall is better than this one in all respects. The Highlite of the concert is Bonamassa's ""Ballad of John Henry"" which allows each performer to ""do his thing"".",1322438400,4,580,4.592233009708738

4712981,5,B005JJSGAI,"I second Dave's review on this concert.  If you are a fan of classic rock, killer vocals, guitar, keyboards and drums, you must get this disc now.  I have been a fan of all these musicians for a very long time.  Glenn Hughes, the Voice of Rock, has never sounded better than he does on this video. He is a living legend (just check out Deep Purple's Come Taste the Band and Burn for starters).  Joe Bonamassa is the best blues guitarist on the planet, and seriously close to one of the best guitarists period.  Joe's voice is also stellar.  Keyboardist of the starts Derek Sherinian is no slouch either.  Check out his latest release Oceana, for some killer instrumental fusion (also highly recommended is his album Inertia).  Rounding out the pack is the son of another legend (John Bonham) and a legend in the making himself, Jason Bonham.

If you have even remotely considered getting this blu-ray, then order it now.  Stellar performance and sound.  As Dave's review stated, I also have a lot of performance video's and this one ranks among the best.  This is most definately a 10 out of 10.",1322006400,11,1095,4.587628865979381
4712982,4,B005JJSGAI,"Black Country Communion released their first live outing, Live Over Europe in late 2011 just a few short months after their second studio album `2' and only about a year after their self-titled debut.

The band, which is something of a super group featuring the talented Joe Bonamassa, Glen Hughes, Jason Bonham and Derek Sherinham. Between them they've worked in all sorts of interesting and important bands like Deep Purple, Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin (sort of), Jimmy Page's solo works, Dream Theater and lots of other solo and guest work.

There are some good things going for Live Over Europe. The set-list for example is pretty fabulous, featuring fifteen live original songs by the band (with another studio version in the credits, inexplicably listed on the back) as well as a Bonamassa solo track and one Deep Purple cover (`Burn.') This is a pretty impressive turn out considering the band only have twenty-three songs at the time it was recorded.

In terms of non-concert extras, the booklet has linear notes and there is a documentary bonus feature along with some photo galleries.

The biggest problem with this release however is the format; it is taken from different shows on different European dates, instead of just picking one to film and release in its entirety. Some of the shows are indoor, some are festivals and as such the sound quality and mixing from each is a little different, which can prevent it from flowing as well as a single show would.

The editing job isn't exactly the best either, with the first song `Black Country' especially suffering. The track is split up between the different concerts and stitched together, with little sections of documentary dialogue in there too. Luckily though, this is the only song to be spoiled in such a way and the rest of the release displays each song intact and complete from beginning to end at the one show, although sometimes the transition between shows will feature a few seconds of documentary footage.

If you can get by the format and forgive the editing (and the aspect ratio), this is still a good enough release that is fairly enjoyable. I have watched it a fair few times since it came out and do not regret buying it despite its flaws.

While quality isn't consistent, some of the shows have very good sound and visuals. In each show, the band are always great performers and the songs themselves are very good so it really does still offer a lot of quality for fans, so long as they aren't put off by the aforementioned format and editing.

Overall; Live Over Europe isn't everything you could hope for in a Black Country Communion live release, so take that into consideration before picking up a copy, but at the same time it is a Black Country Communion live release, which should be enough for a lot of people. The wonderful playing and superb vocals from Joe and Glen really do make up for a heck of a lot and tracks like 'The Battle For Hadrian's Wall' and 'The Ballad Of John Henry' are absolutely phenomenal live.",1321660800,,3011,4.732824427480916
4712983,5,B005JJSGAI,"First, these four are OUTSTANDING musicians. The engineering on this dvd is top notch. How many live cocert dvds do you own that you can hear both the keyboards and bass this clearly in the mix??? I saw BCC at the Casino in Hampton Beach NH at the beginning of their tour last summer and being a Zep & Purp fan was just overwhelmed by how good these four are, playing mostly their own stuff. There are influences of the two bands in most songs and Bonamassa's ""Ballad of John Henry"" (his own composition) will leave you playing the first 8 bars in your sleep.

There isn't a poor song in this concert and if you can't be inspired by the playing and singing in ""Cold"" and ""Song of Yesterday"" there'a problem.

I usually judge musical performances by how much, if any, I look forward to listening/viewing the show again. This one qualifies again and again and again..............and again.",1321574400,,887,4.572327044025157

The drums are well balanced and the mix is just as you would expect with regard to stage positioning and volume, as well as the lead vocals being in the forfront. The finale with Glen Hughes singing Deep Purples 'Burn' is a fitting finish. I have over 150 quality concert DVD's and @ 50+ are Blu-ray and this ranks in the Best of the Best. Jason Bonham has never sounded better and Joe Bonamassa has matured beyond belief as an elite Rock guitarist/singer. The venue's in Hamburg and Munich.
