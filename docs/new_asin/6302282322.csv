7823542,1,6302282322,"This movie holds the unique distinction of being without question the worst movie I have ever seen. Don't get me wrong - if you are reading this you should buy this movie for the shear experience of horrifically terrible cinema that this film will give you. All other movies will seem like Oscar contenders after you watch this one.
The are so many scenes I could share - but the one with the two very large black men who have been greased up in thongs and wrestle for a woman to be taken as the prize... well to be honest that's as far as I got so I can't tell you any more.
If you and your spouse love to watch movies and criticize them for how bad they are - here's your complete Christmas shopping list in one awesome DVD.",1492473600,,726,4.156028368794326
7823543,3,6302282322,Having spent several decades in KeyWest & knowing Capt Tony I had to see the movie he talked so often about.  I thoroughly enjoyed it. A must see for anyone who has spent time in KW or had. the pleasure of knowing the Capt,1439856000,,222,4.045454545454546
7823544,1,6302282322,"I couldn't stick with the movie. There are some good actors in it, but like others have said, the quality of the video is poor. Some, apparently flashbacks or flash forward scenes, seem to have been shot through a dirty fishbowl -- an odd sort of blurry oval with more blurry stuff surrounding it.  It was just too distracting to watch.

Some might say it's unfair to rate a move I haven't seen through, but I think it's fair to point out that it's hard to see clearly much of anything. At least I got to see something of the interior of Captain Tony's. And that is why I took a chance on the DVD and why I watched for as long as I did.",1383696000,2,636,4.08
7823545,3,6302282322,It's quite dated but interesting.  I watched it to gain more insight on Key West before visiting. It supposed to be based on true story.,1356480000,,136,4.44
7823546,1,6302282322,"The movie was very interesting, but was almost unwatchable because the quality was so bad! It is amazing that someone actually released something of such poor quality. It looks like it was dubbed from a really really bad VHS tape.",1228780800,5,230,4.775
7823547,1,6302282322,"The transfer on this DVD is actually WORSE that the VHS version I purchased a while back. In fact, my old ex-rental Beta tape is much clearer than this. I keep hoping that one day an official DVD release will appear. For now, be warned do not waste your hard eraned cash on this.",1184889600,5,279,4.185185185185185
7823548,1,6302282322,"Sheesh, the fact that a 60-year-old Stuart Whitman was supposed to be a sex symbol to hot young babes in this loser of a movie was enough to put me off my dinner for a while!  What a silly waste of my time!  The plot was ridiculous (vengeful Robert Vaughn out to assassinate Castro) and the acting deplorable.",1168128000,,309,4.310344827586207
7823549,3,6302282322,"This film had particular interest to me because I was in Key West when this film was being made and I even stayed at the same motel where the film crew was staying. If you are familiar with Key West and Captain Tony (a real person), this flick may appeal to you. Unfortunately, the big loggerhead, I have foregotten what his name was, definitely the best actor in the movie passed away some years ago. Captain Cisco - Bradenton, Fl",1123027200,5,431,4.4
