8013180,5,B0001J2KLC,"Here's the essence, in my opinion, of the Gumology technique on how to brush your teeth:

1.  Brush should have soft/extra soft bristles
2.  Bristles should not be same size
3.  Never brush ""up and down"" or sideways
4.  Brush ONLY DOWN when brushing top teeth.
5.  Brush ONLY UP when brushing bottom teeth.
6.  If you want, you can use circular strokes for about 2 seconds in any spot.
7.  Don't use a lot of pressure when brushing.  After brushing it should feel your MASSAGED, not HURT your gums.

It also talks about how to hold your toothbrush and how to visualize your teeth in different sections, and some other minor things, but I think what I wrote above is the essence.",1264896000,,678,4.439024390243903

But finally I watched it and was convinced from the information presented that I needed to try the brushing technique.  The technique took about a week to feel comfortable, but after that I found myself unable to go back to brushing the old ""normal"" way.  The next step I figured was to see if it made a difference at my next dental appointment, six months later.  And sure enough, according to the dentist and dental hygienist, my gums looked healthier.  The information is presented well and makes sense.  I recommend Gumology to anyone interested in improving the health of their teeth and gums for the long term.",1150761600,3,696,4.617886178861789
