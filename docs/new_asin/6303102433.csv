570126,5,6303102433,"This is the film version of a book which reported the activities how hundreds of British documents including THE INVASION OF NORMANDY were stolen by the valet (James Mason) to the British ambassador to Turkey during WW2. Even though the British government was aware of the thefts they could not find the culprit. ""Operation Cicero"" was created to uncover this thief (spy) who was passing the most sensitive information to the Germans . This valet did not seem to favor either power. Since he had the opportunity to sell for extremely large sums of money the documents in his employers possession he did not hesitate to take advantage of his position. He was a person without any feeling towards either side. It seemed to be only about the money.
 In the film the valet comes off very British but in actuality he was from an eastern european country. However,  Mason played the gentlemans gentleman to the hilt as only he could with his charm and mannerisms. When dealing with his german contacts another person emerged confident and at times even ruthless. It is a great performance by James Mason and cast . A great and frightening story that such things happened and as we know from our own  history have happened in our recent past.",1488758400,2,1235,4.734883720930233

570344,4,6303102433,I gave this movie a 4 star rating because it is a classic kung-fu movie. The main character has to overcome adversary many times to continue his kung-fu training and to be successful in the final tournament. I would recommend this to anyone who was into kung-fu theater back in the 70s,1380931200,,285,4.5
570395,4,6303102433,"This was the first kung fu film to be shown on the BBC television programme Film 73 (now Film 13 I guess) but as others have already said, it was then known as King Boxer.  It immediately popularised the genre, for no-one had seen anything like it before on UK mainstream cinema screens.  It was a sensation, and soon we were able to watch a regular diet of kung fu films culminating for many people in the Bruce Lee canon of work.  Yes, the film could be better lit and the sound, scriptwriting and acting could be improved, but it was of its time and by modern standards it will always seem quite poor.  Even the early Bruce Lee films suffered by comparison, and it was only with Enter the Dragon that we had true Hollywood values and western (albeit 1970s) quality.  King Boxer/5 Fingers of Death is a classic though, and worth watching for that alone.  Watching it again recently I still enjoyed the fight sequences and laughed like a drain at the script and acting, just as I did as a young kid.  Worth buying and watching over a few beers.",1376006400,2,1045,4.383419689119171

570404,5,6303102433,"I bought this film because I like Michael Rennie - then I found out he was in WWII and this was an important story -  The character of the servant (James Mason) who steels top secret information and sells the photographs to the Germans, does this for money only - He has no philosophical reason - just for money -  He starts to take himself too seriously and is loosing on many levels, but doesn't know it. The serious, but relaxed performance by Michael Rennie balances with the over-confident James Mason. When watching this, I became the one who was tense or afraid - or even shocked -  So I think this film is good story telling. For a serious war, there seem to be alot of shallow people.",1360972800,,693,4.3565891472868215

It may pack a lot in its 102 minutes of running time but it is never dull. It takes itself seriously. The hero has a nice style on screen. The final fight scene our hero against a bad Japanese dude who looked short but deadly and he was. This was a highlight of the film. Buy this DVD. You won't be disappointed.,1338163200,,419,4.0
570480,5,6303102433,"""Five fingers of death"" is the ""one and the original"". I am a certified second generation Bruce Lee instructor under Dan Inosanto, Bruce Lee's protege and best friend. This movie came out just before ""Enter the dragon"" and from the first time I layed eyes on it, started to self teach myself martial arts. I was 8 years old and when It came out in the theatre like so many kids, I was kiaaing all over the neighborhood. The difference was after a few days when the other kids settled in, I was hooked. Born in 1962, this movie allowed me to become a martial artist in 1973 and join the Inosanto Academy in 1987. Even before Bruce, this movie is responsible for my career as an instructor and martial artist. I am now 50 and I have to credit this movie for my life.
Since it was the first, I went to the theatre at least 3 times and played out the tournement scene at the end day after day. It was an inspiration. Anyone who got caught up from this movie knows that the content was amazing for the day. And even if its dated today, it was the first release in the U.S. and needs to be given its due respect for launching not only many people into martial arts, but starting the Kung Fu craze. I think it was about 6 months before Enter the Dragon followed and then Bruces' first 2 movies and all the other Chop Socky movies and eventually Return of the dragon, Sonny Chiba, Three the hard way, Billy Jack and Bruce Li.
Enjoy this DVD. It really was the first and started the whole Kung fu craze. Even before ""Kung Fu"" the series.",1323388800,3,1528,4.236301369863014
570481,4,6303102433,"This DVD is a spy story with a twist.  The twist is that the spy is a Nazi spy stealing secrets from the British.

James Mason turns in a bravura performance in this early 50s film as the spy. The story is based on fact and is thoroughly fascinating.  So for fans of this genre, this is a terrific buy.",1304985600,,302,4.0
570482,5,6303102433,"The plot has already been gone over in the other reviews in detail, so I won't discuss all of the details other to say that the story  is even more incredible because it is true.
I'd like to talk about the performances. James Mason is superb and this ranks as one of his best-ever performances in a long and distinguished career. He uses his best attributes, i.e. his cultivated British accent and mannerisms, to great effect here and it is wonderful to watch. His cleverness is also both wonderful to see and almost impossible to believe his character got away with for so long, which in life this man Diello actually did. The Nazis let their arrogance become stupidity and their eventual downfall, which is a blessing and a lot of fun to watch as they tramp out their arrogance for all to see.
Towards the second half of the film comes another classy Englishman, Michael Rennie, as an agent sent by the British to try to weed out the spy they now know is somewhere in their midst in Turkey. Rennie becomes more and more sure that Diello is the man, and their eventual near-confrontation, with the Nazis on Diello's tail, is a fascinating dance and a tribute to both of these actors. Rennie is so often overlooked but he was one of England's best character actors, as was Mason, and he plays this plum of a supporting role beautifully. They were both transplanted Yorkshiremen and extremely talented, and this film does them both proud.
In short, this is a fine, fine film with great acting by both lead and supporting actors and well worth a look, especially if you enjoy true stories about espionage or are a fan of either or both of these actors. Great movie!",1288742400,,1663,4.561872909698996
570483,5,6303102433,"I was thinking about how great an actor James Mason was and decided to go fishing on Amazon to see what else I could find on him and came across this absolute GEM.  Throw in director Joseph L. Mankiewicz and musical score by Bernard Hermann...plus an outstanding supporting cast and you have one great movie.  Mankiewicz and Hermann also worked together on 1947's ""The Ghost and Mrs. Muir,"" another great film - no - the most romantic film ever made.  If you listen closely to Hermann's musical score in Five Fingers, you will also hear some parts that reappear again in Mason's greatest ever acting role and performance, 1957's ""North by Northwest.""  Listen for the oboes and you'll see what I mean.  Michael Rennie is also excellent in this film as the British counter-espionage expert.  Another good WWII film with Rennie is ""Sailor for the King"" where he plays a British Navy admiral.  Anyway, back to Five Fingers.  What a great film to discover!  But with Mason, can you ever go wrong?  One of the greatest actors ever....oh, those golden vocal chords.  He is just absolutely excellent.  The plot also is great.  I never once found myself questioning its legitimacy.  The only part of it I will say I had a question about:  the existence of Ultra...the reading of the German codes...was not disclosed until 1970.  In fact, right after the war ended, Winston Churchill went to British code-breaking center Bletchley Park and ordered everything pulled out into the center courtyard, burned, and everyone sworn to an oath of secrecy forever....they did this in Churchill's presence.  So...how does a film made in 1952 disclose the British breaking of diplomatic codes prior to Ultra's disclosure in 1970?  After all, Five Fingers is based on a true story.  Maybe the explanation is that the German diplomatic codes were not part of the Ultra operation.  That is certainly possible.  It must have been the case if we are to accept this story to be completely true, which it claims to be.  Or another way to look at it is that the German author of the book that served as the basis for this movie was actually the first to disclose Ultra indirectly.  But then...he was German so how would he have known?  Ah! Another plot within a plot!  In sum, if you want a truly great film with great acting, great music, great plot, and great script, then Five Fingers is for you.  It is thoroughly enjoyable.  I loved all of it.  If only movies today would rely on these solid foundations instead of all those ridiculous special effects.  RIP James Mason.

This film and others like it paved the way for the likes of Bruce Lee, Chuck Norris, Jim Kelly, and more.

570597,4,6303102433,"the Interrogation technique of this movie is definitely being used to those terrorist suspects prisoned by us. very brutal, vicious, cunning, coercing, intimidating, cruel, and inhumane. this is how to completely dismantle a person's mind. if compare to my recent viewing of 'the lives of others', one of the best movies i've ever seen, those coerce, threaten techniques used by the east germany stasi, seems to suddenly become too gentle, too kind and too polite. cutting off fingers one by one because of the wrong answers indeed is the most efficient way to destroy a trained deep-cover person. all the actors in this film are talented veteran performers. with a good screenplay as a plus, the simple in-house setting never bored the viewers. those flashback memories sometimes loosened up the tense a little bit, but still necessary.

after watched this movie, i often looked at my ten fingers and couldn't help thinking that if somebody threatens to cut off my fingers, even just one, or just the tip of that finger, merely for the purpose of knowing whether i've done that or this....well, would i confess it right away? but what if i simply couldn't remember?

my reason of given 4 stars instead of 5 is this:

i've cut and wounded my fingers and my other parts of my hands so many times during the current life span. there were large and long cuts on my fingers, palms and on the back of my hands that most of the times the bleedings simply couldn't stop and i had to rush to the e.r. to sew them up.

what i could tell you is that even that wound was generated from a careless paper cut, it would hurt like hell and that throbbing pain would also prolong for at least two to three days, sometimes even longer. and during the healing time, you have to keep your whole hand and arm raised higher than your heart to reduce the constant throbbing pain generated by the damaged nerves and from the blood pressure. if you carelessly lowered down your arm, guess what? you might cry out loud by the sudden increase of the shocking pain.

so based upon my personal experiences, if a finger was brutally cut off, the pain would be absolutely unimaginable and unbearable, not to imagine what the pain would be if the fingers were cut off one by one and during prolonged intervals.

but what the aftermaths played by the actor who played that finger-cutting prisoner were simply not true and realistic enough. he screamed his heart out every time when one of his fingers was cut off, but the pain seemed to subside and ebb away right afterward and so soon. and he could also lower down that arm and talk normally. that is absolutely impossible! just like what i've seen in 'kiss, kiss, bang, bang', a finger crashed by a door, like cut off by a knife, fell to the floor, and the guy simply didn't mind and care, still joked around and used that hand normally. it's not just impossible, it's ridiculous!",1171411200,,2900,4.5996131528046424
570598,5,6303102433,"The only question raised by this superb spy story is why it is called ""5 Fingers"". The title seems to have nothing to do with the story: perhaps I missed something. It is a supremely well-directed, well-written, well-acted, well-shot movie, as one might expect from the director of ""All About Eve"". Taut, convincing, suspenseful, gripping and humorous. James Mason was never better cast, or delivered better --- or more astonishingly valuable --- goods. There is a delicious class edge to the interplay between him, as a gentleman's gentleman, and his nemesis, Countess Danielle Darrieux. The introduction to the film heavily stresses the absolute truth of the details of this espionage caper set in Turkey in WWII, in the period shortly preceding D-Day, 1944. This seems incredible, but even if the facts have been embroidered, it is still a riveting piece of film-making. The ending is brilliant.

570601,5,6303102433,"All you guys who (righty) point out the facts that ""5 Fingers of Death"" has bad acting, effects and editing, entirly miss the point. From Wang Yu to Master Bruce Lee, they all have foibles.

Indeed, I also saw every Kung Fu movie made in the 70s, and as much as I enjoyed many of them, this is the one that I remember the most (except Master Bruce's), and in fact found inspiring. Get off your high horses and accept and enjoy it dispite all its foibles. In my humble opinion, the story was engaging, the actors intresting and the fight scenes exciting. The current Kung Fu movies to me are boring and unwatchable. So what if through CGI the actors can fly and walk on water? It's all phony and looks so. Expensive garbage. At 51 I could do the same with the help of a computer.

This is by far the best Kung Fu movie without Bruce Lee. For many  reasons I won't go into here. And Bruce Lee's movies (all 5 of them) are far superiour to any of the slick, packaged, expensive stuff being turned out today. He's still remembered and adored more than 30 years after his death. Will any of the Kung Fu actors or movies of today be remembered in 2037? Ha!!! But 5 Fingers of Death is, and so is Bruce's films, dispite thier shortcomings. The person I find the most intreaging in this film is Chen Leng. The guy who hits his opponents with his head. When we first meet him he destroys the Mongolian fighter. Then kicks ass at the other Kung Fu school until he fights the schools master. Then beats him with trickery. Then he fights the hero and almost beats him, but then loses. So. Is he a winner? Or a loser?

He's both!!! Just like you and me. Then at the end he redeems himself by saving the heros life after a bout of guilt by working  with persons who are truly evil. I hope you can all see my point and look past ""I'll see you later"". After all he saved the heros life and sacrificed his own in the process. And all with complete courage, and self confidence that I doubt I would have. There is some real deep thinking being displayed here. I encourage any fan of martial arts movies to add this one to their collection. And enjoy it for what it is. It's a great movie in its own way, and anyone who was as deeply affected by it as I was in 1973 will surly agree. Sometimes it matters more to enjoy something rather than to judge it.

570683,5,6303102433,"Rather astonishingly, ""5 Fingers"" is based on a true story of WWII espionage in Turkey.  In the British consulate in Ankara, an enigmatic spy is selling confidential information to the Germans.  James Mason plays Ulysses Diello, a practically perfect manservant who dreams of a better life.  He plots to become a 'gentleman' via his spying and teams up with an impoverished Polish Countess (Danielle Darrieux).  Buckle your seatbelts, because it's going to be a bumpy night!

Mason's suave British demeanor has never been used to such perfect effect.  He's spectacular as the pragmatic spy, who is given the codename ""Cicero.""  Danielle Darrieux is nearly as good in her role, as are the supporting cast.  The film is as enjoyable and well-made a spy flick as you're likely to ever see.  The Oscar nominated script is filled with sharp writing, unforeseen plot twists, and some genuine laughs.  Joseph L. Mankiewicz (""All About Eve"") directed and received an Oscar nomination -- it's among his very best work.  Why this movie is not better known is a mystery.  ""5 Fingers"" has every element of a true classic -- most highly recommended.

Trivia: The movie was made into a short lived 1955 TV series (""Operation Cicero""), with Ricardo Montalban in the Mason role!",1117324800,45,1262,4.980861244019139
570684,1,6303102433,"OK... you've gotta be kidding right?! I remember going to see this flick at a local cinema one afternoon back in the 70s when me and a few buddies had nothing better to do than smoke a reefer and sit down for some mindless entertainment. I have to admit we laughed our guts out but I don't believe for a second that this flick was made as a satire. It's just unbelievably bad! We used to reminisce over one too many suds about things like:

- Who was the ugliest girl you ever pooched
- What is the worst album you ever bought
- (other than The Clamdiggers Daughter) was there ever a movie as bad as 5 Funny Fingers of Death?

Am I the only one who noticed that it's not really possible for people to jump over houses and attack each other in mid air?!

Why are there always at least twenty or more bad guys jumping around kicking at the air fifteen feet or more from the guy they want to beat up?!

Did the producers of this movie have to pay some sort of royalty for using the theme from IRONSIDE when the hero's hands glowed red? (an obvious consequence of having them shoved into hot coals).

Why do all these Asians sound like John Wayne or Matt Helm?

It's hard to say if the acting is really the worst of any movie made in the last fourty years or if it might be that the dubbing doesn't do the acting the justice it deserves. Either way this is definitely one of the worst movies ever made. As a spoof it might be entertaining for a half-hour or so but if you're really still being entertained by the end of this flick then I'd like some of what you and your buddies have been smokin!",1099094400,3,1592,4.135922330097087
570685,3,6303102433,"""Five Fingers of Death"" was apparently the movie that launched the kung-fu craze of the 1970s in America. Released by Warner Bros., it had an elaborate marketing campaign and ended up being a big hit. It's actually a very typical, not extremely interesting movie for the genre. There are some good fight scenes and a couple of moments that really stand out (like when the guy gets his eyes poked out), but the story isn't interesting even by 70s kung-fu standards, and the star isn't charismatic. Still, its minor historical significance makes it worth seeing for a hard-core kung-fu fan.
The DVD (""limited widescreen edition"") is in its correct 2.35:1 aspect ratio, which automatically makes it better than the millions of bad kung-fu DVDs clogged up a remainder bin near you. Still, the picture quality is far from perfect, with many scratches and some truly horrible colour bleeding. It looks very similar to a VHS tape. The sound is the English dubbed version from the 70s, which, if you ask me, adds to the fun of this goofy flick. There are no extras whatsoever, which is a disappointment considering the relatively high price tag (I bought it for $24.99). Are a trailer, photo gallery, production notes, biographies, or liner notes too much to ask?",1092096000,10,1255,4.869158878504673

570687,5,6303102433,"Pardon the awkward pun but ""5 Fingers"" is a first rate cloak and dagger tale set in Ankara, Turkey during WW2. James Mason is a valet to the British ambassador. Coldly and chillingly self- assured, he decides to make a fortune by stealing war secrets and selling them to a contact at the German embassy. All goes well until ""someone"" gets suspicious and the film jumps into high gear. ""5F"" is the type of film where it is quintessentially necessary for a reviewer to not even HINT at the ending. Any plot details must end here. This reviewer can report that the movie's settings are top notch. Documentary backgrounds were shot in Istanbul, Ankara and Berlin to generate realism and solid effect. The supporting cast is excellent, especially those playing the Germans. Michael Rennie, one of the ""suspicious"" folks, is the only ""name"" among them. All support Mr. Mason who carries ""5F"" virtually single-handed.  Mason has that certain evil charm to play the semi-likeable villain. (One wonders if people are so cool under fire in real life!) The producers had the foresight to shoot ""5F""in black and white. This movie in the ""High Noon"", ""Psycho"" and ""Casablanca"" tradition, should not be colorized. I've read reviews stating that ""5F"" is too long but this reviewer disagrees. It runs under 2 hours and anyone into suspense, detective or secret agent tales should NOT become restless. Most seem to agree that ""5F"" was based on a real life incident.

570688,5,6303102433,"This movie is rather interesting despite the quality of the film.  The film is really old but there are many good points to the movie.  Here are some of the reasons why.
First, I would like to address the accuracy of the film in terms of actual Kung-fu.  The Iron Fist kung-fu is a true kung-fu technique.  However, even though my title says the movie is true it is true in the sense of how you do iron fist not necessarily based on actual fact of the story.  The story of course is fiction and really makes very little sense but the actual working up to be an Iron Fist grandmaster there is some truth to how the movie depicts the training.  In reality, Iron fist kills with one hit.  And no they don't fly in the air to hit someone like they showed in the movie.  The way you train for Iron Fist is correct but they only showed the end of the training.  Nobody starts out burning their hands first like he did in the hot coals.  Actually that is last in the training.  Imagine if it was your first time doing Iron Fist and you had to melt your hands in coals first.  Ya right then nobody would learn it.  Actually what happens is you work up to that skill then when you burn your hands in coals you already feel nothing.  You also train to kill with one hit not 50 hits.  BUt of course the movie would be boring if someone hit and killed everyone with one hit.  Also the Iron Fist only needed one strike not 50 strikes to actually hit somone but then again it would make a very boring film.
Secondly, if you were to train Iron Fist you started with hitting a brick but you laid a piece of cloth on the brick so you won't hurt your hand.  Then when you progressed you took the cloth off.  Later you hit iron, then again last you burned your hands in coal.  After each work out you dipped your hands in herbal chinese medicine to make the injuries you sustained to your hands heal quicker and lessen the pain.  Well you get the point.
Pros:
-General Accurate Depiction of Iron Fist technique.
-Uses Interesting rather modern fight coreography for such an old film.
Cons:
-Poor story telling.  You understand what they are trying to explain but its not well done.
-Old reused storyline.  I mean come on Japanese vs. Chinese kung-fu fights get a little old don't they.  I mean Chinese Connection with Bruce Lee, Fist of Legend w/ Jet Li are some of the other martial art films w/ chinese vs Japanese.",1055980800,,2398,4.2682926829268295
570689,4,6303102433,"James Mason plays the role of valet to the British Ambassador to Turkey. Mason's character - Diello - hates the British. He would happily sell British secrets to the Germans.(During World War 2, Turkey was a neutral country, and so had diplomatic outposts of Allied and Axis nations.)
Mason learns how to open the Ambassador's safe, and he photographs the secret documents stored within. Somehow he manages to return the scene of the crime to normal. Then he offers the photographic negatives to the Nazis in the German Embassy. Though they buy the negatives from the valet, the Germans are suspicious of him and of his motives.
Mason's Diello keeps returning to the Ambassador's safe, where he finds and photographs the secret documents. These repeated trips to the Ambassador's safe provide some of the supense of this film, but not all.
The British begin to supect that their papers aren't secure, and as the Allied invasion of Europe is being prepared, they become suspicious of their own embassy personnel.
The film becomes a manhunt and a romance, but continues as an espionage thriller right to the end. The ending here is quite a surprise. Joseph L. Mankiewicz seems to have had a good time writng and directing this film. Despite the fact that it is a thriller, it has a comedic aspect which comes through clearly at the end.
Mason's performance as the valet is quite interesting. It combines elements of menace, an oily charm and a clear desire to be master of his own fate - not the servant he now is. There's a romantic subplot here that involves an indigent and widowed Polish countess, whose husband was formerly Diello's employer. This last element of the movie may be pure fancy, something that Mankiewicz simply added to spice up the story.
