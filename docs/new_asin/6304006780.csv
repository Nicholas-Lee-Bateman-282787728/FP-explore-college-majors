7858877,5,6304006780,"A powerful film about the ways in which bigotry and hatred is fought with community organizing and alliance-building. BALLOT MEASURE 9 is a thrilling, terrifying, and ultimately empowering true story about a state that was divided by irrational fears flamed by groups that felt disenfranchised from progress a perfect film to watch to know how to live and fight back in Trump's America.",1488672000,,386,5.142857142857143

7858882,5,6304006780,"My husband and I, both activists against the now ""legal"" Proposition 8 in California, just finished watching this outstanding documentary, followed by the incredible bonus ""reunion"" track. We were so strongly moved that I had to write a review immediately.

While fighting Prop. 8, although we were aware of previous attempts by the religious right, both within California and without, to legislate their ongoing dehumanization of gays and lesbians, we did not realize that there existed this 1995 documentary about Oregon's ballot measure 9, let alone the fact that Heather MacDonald had updated her film in 2007 with new footage in which some of the activists were reunited and discuss what they learned during that fight. The resemblance of the still-recent Prop. 8 battle to what happened in Oregon in 1992 is uncanny. But the comments made fifteen years later, on the bonus track, about the campaign against ballot measure 9 by activists Kathleen Saadat and Donna Red Wing were chillingly on target about what happened just last year in California, even though that battle had yet to be fought. Frustratingly, Californians could have learned a very important lesson from this monumental struggle, yet our ignorance and complacency prevented us from doing so.

The film portrays in vivid detail the extreme climate of fear, hate and violence that proponents of BM 9 created for gays and lesbians all over the state of Oregon. Yes, people actually died as a direct result of pro-BM 9 violence. Watching the film, it was hard to believe that something like that could happen in America, yet we know very well from the venom spewed by anti-gay churches and other organization what these modern fascists are capable of. Although the forces of justice prevailed on election night in Oregon, the message the film conveys is that all of us have a responsibility to continue to fight the forces of hate, ignorance, lies and misinformation that conspire to take anyone's rights away, whether it is our own or our neighbor's. The gay community has so long been oppressed -- and continues to be so -- that we often forget that we too must come to the table and speak out against injustices against others, even in ""times of peace,"" not just when there's a raging legislative battle, because then it's too late. If we truly want the loving, tolerant society we dream of living in, where every human being has value, we must all work to create it. That means having the courage to come out and be visible. Even those of us who are already out often choose to remain invisible, to not push the envelope, to not cause controversy by something as simple as holding hands. Unfortunately, this only allows us to be oppressed further.

Ballot Measure 9 conveys the message of community-building and common humanity so effectively, so touchingly, that I believe every university, high school, library and community group should have a copy and show it freely and often. Buy a copy! Have a movie-viewing party at your house with friends and family! This message is too important to ignore.",1247875200,,3072,4.926640926640927
7858883,5,6304006780,"In an election year where everything is close, something like this could show up as a Constitutinal Amendment: No Special Rights amendment. You could get people ,at the federal level, who say it will never make it through the states.
This movie illustrates how a mob menatality on anything, in this case Gay Rights, could actually be made into law. Fortunately, they lost this round. It illustrates the mindless mentality of the bully in the tactics employed against those who fought this amendment. Now ,at least, we have the Australion Ballot System.
What is really scary is that it would be so easy to have something like this go through the process to become an amendment to the constitution at the national level. It would take around less than 1/5th of the countries population pressuring their state legislatures to approve one.  Remember that the small states that would have an equal vote is usually the states that go to the Conservative mentality on issues like this.
Then there would be no support from the courts because it would be the de facto law of the land in the constitution. 2/3rds of the state legislatures is a scary thing to envisage. It is not that hard to get. Look at the current spate of Protecting Marriage laws on the books concerning Gay Marriage.",1216684800,2,1278,4.756756756756757
7858884,5,6304006780,"I'm so happy to find this video here. I have a copy that is worn out from playing for my students every year. It shows the human side of the impact of the anti-gay hate movement. The level of ignorance from the hate mongers about homosexuality would be comical if not for the fact that some fearful homophobes turn to violence, as this important film illustrates.",1139788800,2,363,4.515151515151516
7858885,5,6304006780,"The first time I saw this video, I was alone, at home, and broke down into tears at the surreal level of hate aimed at lesbians and gay men. The second time I saw it was at the New York LGBT Film Festival; I could hear that scores of other adults were weeping with me in the dark. We've come a long way since 1992, thank God, farther than most of us would have expected at the time. But it's still good to know how recently lesbians and gay men were utter pariahs, and how much irrational hatred still could erupt if encouraged by public leaders--either towards lesbians, gay men, bisexuals, and transgendered folks or toward other unpopular groups, if the majority does not come to their aid.",1136678400,3,693,4.421875
