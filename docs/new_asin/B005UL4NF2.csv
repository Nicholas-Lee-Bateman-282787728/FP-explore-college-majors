4893961,5,B005UL4NF2,"I highly recommend these dvds. There are others that have done a great job of describing the stories, the actors so I'll refer you to the other 5 star reviews.",1326758400,2,159,4.333333333333333
4893962,5,B005UL4NF2,"Season five takes flight immediately with a deliciously acerbic and dark-humored tale starring Lawrence Harvey, scream queen Hazel Court and Patrick Macnee that's a sumptuous treat from beginning to end, and with direction by Hitch, how can it possibly get any better? The 'abdominal snowman' (as he refers to himself) returns to the director's chair for the second episode that takes place on the Swiss Alps, reminiscent of his earlier British and first few American films, a saddening love story that takes place over the course of 40 years.

From here, each and every episode is captivating, rewarding and worth several viewings - even though you may know the outcome, the way the stories are acted, directed and paced insures continuous entertainment and enjoyment, and how many TV shows can you say that about? The picture and audio are absolutely splendid, leaving little room for improvement - no blu-ray version necessary, IMO. The actors involved are among the best of the times (or any other before or since) - even those character actors you don't necessarily know by name but whose faces are familiar from your past as they were constantly utilized due to their consummate professionalism - and include Dick Van Dyke, Laurence Harvey, Suzanne Pleshette, Macdonald Carey, Robert Vaughn, James Coburn, Burt Reynolds, Edgar Buchannan, Walter Matthau, Brian Keith, Patrick Macnee (in several episodes that pre-date his nine year tenure on 'The Avengers'), Peter Lorre, Steve McQueen, William Shatner, Robert Morley, Harry Morgan, Jackie Coogan, Joseph Cotten, Raymond Massey, Dick York,  etc. The list goes on and on and is delightful to see these charming folks weave in and out of each episode. They bring something unique and special to the table to those of us who can ""remember when"".

All prejudices aside, it seems to me that each season gets stronger and better than its predecessor and, like most other reviewers here, I hope we don't have to wait two years to get our sweaty little palms on the remainder of one of television's high points and template for the best drama that can come out of this medium. Long live Hitchcock, the master of mystery and suspense, peppered with some comically caustic black humor and sarcastic social commentary.",1325980800,51,2262,5.075268817204301
4893963,5,B005UL4NF2,"Season five is one of the most entertaining of the series' run. The occasional emphasis on the macabre is simply delicious. If you enjoyed the ironic fate of Robert Morley in ""Theater Of Blood"",being forced to eat his pet poodles baked in a pie,you'll enjoy the just desserts he receives in the episode,""Specialty of the House"" as he finally discovers what ingredient makes the specialty of the house so unique and why a lifetime membership in this dining club is a short-term privilege. Another standout episode is ""The Cure"". Even though you see the ending coming, The storyline hinging on a woman being sent down a South American river after attacking her husband with a knife,to be cured by a head shrinker is nontheless,compelling. Hopefully,the rest of the series' seasons along with the Hitchcock Hour will all summarily be released.",1325808000,5,840,5.007142857142857

Now I'm four years shy of 40, all my loans are paid off, I make 60K a year with a wife and 14-month old daughter to take care of and here comes Season Five.

4893969,5,B005UL4NF2,"For us fans of Mr. Hitchcock, we get to start off 2012 with a great classic release, that is season 5 of Alfred Hitchcock Presents.

Season 5 has one of my favorite episodes of the entire series. The episode is called ""MAN FROM THE SOUTH"". It is about a man (Steve McQueen) who bets his finger that his cigarette lighter will lite 10 consecutive times. That is all I'm gonna tell you cuz I would be spoiling the story if you haven't seen it yet. The episode also stars Peter Lorre. When you get this set, watch ""MAN FROM THE SOUTH"" first before any other episode. You'll be glad you did! It is very NERVE WRACKING! WHEW! I have this episode on a video tape, but now I am looking forward to having it on DVD, along with all the others.

4893974,5,B005UL4NF2,"No sub-par episodes in Season Five (1959-60) of Alfred Hitchcock Presents : 38 superbly crafted instalments of Hitch inspired mysteries with a wonderful diversity of plots and with quirky and memorable conclusions.
Each episode is hosted by Mr. H himself and his pithy remarks and colorful vocal delivery, backgrounded with clever props and sets, have never been better and offer a priceless bonus to each program.
Hitch directed the opening two episodes: beautifully made tales featuring Laurence Harvey as an experimental chicken farmer determined to remain a bachelor (""Arthur"") and Patricia Owens, widowed as a young woman due to a freak mountaineering accident, waiting into old age for her entombed husband to thaw out (""The Crystal Trench""), based on an old A.E.W. Mason story.
Just the tip of the iceberg, as all the remaining stories are as good if not better with the following sampler of a few selected gems.
- ""Anniversary Gift"", based on a John Collier story, with hen-pecked Henry Morgan gifting a poisonous snake to wife Barbara Baxley and her menagerie of exotic animals.
- ""Special Delivery"", a Ray Bradbury creation, telling the story of  a young boy and his special delivery of mysterious mushrooms.
- ""The Schartz-Metterklune Method"" with the enchanting Hermione Gingold, simply delicious as an assumed governess who wreaks havoc in a Victorian-era household.
- ""An Occurrence at Owl Creek"", another version of the famous Ambrose Bierce classic Civil War story, featuring Ronald Howard as the unfortunate Confederate soldier.
As usual, the series presented an A-list of fine actors, including Walter Matthau, Raymond Massey, Wendy Hiller, Steve McQueen, Peter Lorre, Robert Vaughn, Joseph Cotten, Beatrice Straight, Judy Canova, Stella Stevens, Oskar Homolka, Dennis Weaver, John McIntire, Suzanne Pleshette, William Shatner,  Robert Morse, Julia Adams, Dick Van Dyke and Nehemiah Persoff.
The show's associate producer Norman Lloyd directed six of the episodes and also starred in the very nifty story ""The Little Man Who Was There"".
Other directors include Herschel Daugherty  and John Brahm, each with five, Arthur Hiller and Stuart Rosenberg (four each) and Paul Henreid with three.
All in all, 38 excellent programs which remain fresh and entertainingly relevant, more than half a century later.",1466035200,4,2320,5.403314917127072

The fun came watching the pros at work: Steve McQueen, Peter Lorre and Katherine Squire turn in great performances.

4894028,5,B005UL4NF2,"I was born in 1980, so I unfortunately wasn't around at the time this show aired on network television. But I was lucky enough to have parents that often watched these re-runs, along with those of ""The Twilight Zone,"" ""The Outer Limits,"" etc. As an adult, I now appreciate these shows in a whole new way. Hitchcock is, of course, the Master of Suspense. Everyone loves his movies, but I think his tv shows (this one and the later ""Alfred Hitchcock Hour"") often get overlooked.

Before watching this DVD set, I wasn't familiar with most of the episodes of this season. After my first viewing, I initially thought that the earlier seasons were much better, with the exception of a few. But after re-watching, I've changed my mind. This season, while perhaps not as strong as the earlier seasons, does hold its own - which is pretty impressive for a fifth season. I would imagine after so many shows, it's difficult to come up with original ideas; and, in fact, many of these episodes were borrowed/adapted from books.

""Man From the South"" is the obvious stand-out episode here. I recall my parents watching that episode and talking about how great Steve McQueen was in it. Peter Lorre, as usual, brings the creep factor. Those two are brilliant together. ""Special Delivery"" is my favorite one in the set. It exemplifies the alien craze which shrouded the nation in the early '60's. ""Specialty of the House"" is another great one. You can see the ending coming from a mile away, but it's still delightfully gruesome.

Until seasons 6 and 7 are released, those episodes have been uploaded onto youtube with pretty decent quality. I can't get enough of this show and watch it often. It sounds cliche' to say, but I do really prefer classic tv to most of our current tv shows. I'm hoping my generation continues to pass down these classics to the next generations.",1362787200,27,1858,4.71076923076923

4894040,5,B005UL4NF2,"If you are unfamiliar with Alfred Hitchcock, this series offers you the opportunity to get a sense of the man himself.  At the beginning of each show, he does a humorous introductory skit.  After the show reaches its conclusion, Alfred returns with an embellishment on the story.  Occasionally, even Hitchcock will get in on the fun and terminate a hapless actor or meet his own demise . . . .

Most shows, or plays as Alfred likes to call them, involves death, either by murder, accident, or execution.  Each story is unique with a different set of actors.  As you might expect, all stories are not written to the same level, but most rate 4 or 5.  The stories that Hitchcock presents are known for their plot twists: the one you think is about to be murdered, is not, and many times, the real motives of the characters are not apparent until the last minute.

If you are a fan of Twilight Zone, you will be surprised to learn that one of these shows is an earlier version of an episode that appeared during season five of Twilight Zone in 1964.  It's called: ""An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge""; a story of a man about to be summarily hanged off the side of a bridge during the American Civil War.  Warning: There is no humor in this one.

If you already own Season Four, you will be happy to know that Season Five is of the same quality.

Picture (DVD): generally 3.5, except for the first episode which is very grainy rating only a 3.  Packaging: discs overlap - 2 on top of 3 and 4 on top of 5.  Subtitles: English.",1335139200,5,1520,4.343971631205674
4894041,5,B005UL4NF2,"I do wish this set had the American Hitchcock intro, I've seen episodes with the American intro and they were funnier.
Non the less I bought this series for the show primarily.
Its a great series and a necessary addition to anyone who likes TV from the 50's.
I feel sorry for you folks who have been waiting for these season releases since 2005.
By the time I decided to get this set, seasons 1-5 were already out. So I didn't have to do the long wait that many of you had to make.
Though I have a feeling it is going to be a while before the next 5 seasons are released.
I have heard that season 6 should be available November 2012, which I will pick up.
But I am also looking forward to getting the Alfred Hitchcock Hour seasons.",1334880000,5,731,4.154929577464789
4894042,5,B005UL4NF2,I love the Alfred Hitchcock Presents show so much and cannot wait until seasons 6 and so forth are released in the USA.  This series is absolutely incredible and well worth the money as its so classic and well produced quality suspense drama.  There is so rival to Alfred Hitchcock in my opinion.  This is well worth owning all seasons available ( I own seasons 1-5 ) as this is timeless and great for the whole family no matter what age group.,1331942400,2,444,4.390243902439025
4894043,5,B005UL4NF2,"It goes without saying that the gruel that is served up today on television cannot hold a candle to the rich fare that was our regular diet in ""THE GOLDEN AGE OF TELEVISION"". Indeed, as good as TV was in those halycon days of 1955-1965, the absolute ""gold standard"" of TV series was undoubtedly the various Alfred Hitchcock shows; ie, ""ALFRED HITCHCOCK PRESENTS"" ""SUSPICION"", & ""THE ALFRED HITCHCOCK HOUR"". Superb scripts, exemplary acting, provocative themes, and plots with an 'edge' were the Hitchcock trademarks, making these DVD's invaluable additions to the collections of anyone who enjoys quality television.",1331510400,,616,5.295918367346939

I tried to stretch out the suspense, but I must admit that I watched all the episodes in less than 2 weeks. It's always fun to see the familiar actors that pop up in some of the episodes. In Season Five, you can see Burt Reynolds and Steve McQueen, among others.",1330300800,,336,4.349206349206349

With Alfred we never know what we will be getting: murder, comedy, Sci-Fi or just how much fun murder can be (using his words). His antics before and after the show are great and priceless. For those of you that are blooper buffs: watch the watch on APPOINTMENT AT ELEVEN and for all of you mushroom lovers, you NEED to watch: SPECIAL DELIVERY. As someone very famous said on Laugh-In : verrry interesting. Great entertainment at a decent price. The quality of the DVDs are great, but I don't like the folder with the DVDs piggy-backed. I wish that they were separate, which is my only complaint. +JMJ+",1329177600,5,758,4.421428571428572

4894048,5,B005UL4NF2,Back in the days there were 30+ episodes in a season and each episode was about three minutes longer than they are now.  It's a treat to see major stars early in their careers and the always clever stories never fail to entertain.

4894051,5,B005UL4NF2,"""Alfred Hitchcock Presents: Season Five"" contains 38 episodes from the 1959-1960 season, including two -- ""Arthur"" and ""The Crystal Trench"" -- directed by Hitchcock himself.

The shows are presented in the concise, half-hour format.  Hitchcock introduces and closes each program with humorous comments about the story at hand.  Some stars in Season Five episodes are Dick Van Dyke, Laurence Harvey, Robert Vaughn, William Shatner, Hermione Gingold, Joseph Cotten, Walter Matthau, Dick York, Raymond Massey, Mary Astor, and Suzanne Pleshette.  The Hitchcock shows were known for their twist or ironic endings and included mysteries, humorous tales, suspense yarns, ghost stories, and the occasional horror tale.

There are a number of standout episodes in Season Five. In Roald Dahl's ""Man From the South,"" a fellow (Steve McQueen) agrees to an unusual wager that could result in the loss of more than cash.  In ""Specialty of the House,"" a gourmand (Robert Morley) eagerly desires to become a life member of an ultra-exclusive gourmet club and to see inside the usually off-limits kitchen.  ""Special Delivery"" is a creepy tale about a young boy who orders mushrooms through the mail and raises them as his parents begin to suspect their presence in the house is causing odd changes in their son.  ""Escape to Sonoita"" is an ironic take on human nature as two truck drivers (Burt Reynolds, James Bell) in the Arizona desert encounter kidnappers who steal their truck and leave them to die.

Hitchcock's introductions and post-epsode commentary are always witty and original.  Hitchcock was busy making feature films (""North By Northwest,"" ""Psycho"") while his show was on the air, so he didn't have time to direct every episode.  His contract allowed him to direct only those he had a particular fondness for.  Other directors were hired for the balance of each season's episodes.",1326758400,20,1876,5.216666666666667
