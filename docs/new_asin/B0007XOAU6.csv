8535791,5,B0007XOAU6,"As someone who teaches about the arts of Africa, I often find that quality video resources are hard to come by. ""African Weaving"" is certainly an exception. This video highlights the entire weaving process in great detail, and includes insightful narrative throughout. The shorter run-time (about 20 minutes) is great for use in the classroom, and leaves enough time for discussion. It's great to see the extent of the process, as well as the impressive dexterity of the weavers themselves - these aspects are often overlooked when one simply views the completed textile. In addition, the scenes of spinning and dying are equally impressive, and show the rich diversity of textile arts throughout the region.",1209772800,3,708,5.165217391304348
