2191552,5,B0006Q7F2Y,"I just purchased through Amazon the 3 DVD set ""American Knitter"" and

LOVED it.  I have wanted to learn how to knit for years but the

""instructional"" books are to confusing for me. The DVD set is perfect.  The

verbal and visual intructions are easy to follow, and I can pause or turn it

off until a step is completed. I have knitted a few pot holders, and I'm

still trying to make a perfect one so I can continue to the next DVD. I just

want to be sure I have it before I try to add something new.",1148342400,,502,3.95
2191553,5,B0006Q7F2Y,"I really enjoyed learning to knit with this set. This was so well done, I started knitting in two days! Highly recommended! I had absolutly no experience knitting and now I'm becoming better and better. I hope the next lesson comes out soon! Thanks for a job well done! My projects are coming along great!",1147737600,,305,4.5636363636363635
2191554,5,B0006Q7F2Y,"I purchased the Learn to Knit DVD Set and love them.  Tracie is a wonderful

teacher and made knitting so simple for me that I can actually knit now with

ease.",1146700800,,160,4.096774193548387
2191555,5,B0006Q7F2Y,I enjoyed the lessons from Tracie Wunderlich.  They would be an asset for any non knitter (like my former self).  In fact I will take them to my local yarn store and suggest that they carry this product.,1146700800,,203,4.315789473684211
2191556,3,B0006Q7F2Y,"I had to ""ding"" this rating by 2 points because, although Tracie is fairly good at explaining how to knit, she makes some strange and contradictory choices that actually stand in the way of her instructions. The first thing that will stand out to anyone watching this DVD is that she is wearing extremely long acrylic TALONS that are additionally painted in tiger stripes. These are incredibly distracting for a film that's supposed to teach knitting. Second, she tells the audience it's hard to see your stitches if you use a yarn with variegated colors, or is dark, or is a textured yarn. She then proceeds to teach the basics in an extremely dark shade of forest green, then does one project (a dishcloth) with variegated yarn and the next project (mittens) with charcoal -- really, almost black -- textured yarn. I also would have liked for her to have explained more about her background in knitting other than to say, ""I've been knitting for 10 years and I'm a wonderful knitter."" I think that all these things were really the fault of the producers, who should have advised Ms. Wunderlich to have a shorter, plainer manicure and to choose lighter, solid-color yarns.

Finally, I wish that Ms. Wunderlich would have explained to new knitters the difference between the Continental and English method, and the benefits of each. Most instructors seem to just pick one method and never talk about the other, an unfortunate omission since different people usually find one method much easier than the other.

The amazing thing is that DESPITE all these problems, Ms. Wunderlich managed to teach me in a day what I was never able to learn despite many attempts as a teenager. I just wish that Hill Bros. would re-shoot this DVD and correct the problems mentioned here.",1142035200,,1769,4.815789473684211
2191557,4,B0006Q7F2Y,"I bought this DVD for my niece who is 9 yrs old.  She started on Saturday and by the next day she already knew what a slip knot was, casting on and the knit stitch! Great teaching methods very easy and is set at the correct pace for a beginner.

We can't wait to start our first project together!!!",1116201600,,298,4.033898305084746
2191558,5,B0006Q7F2Y,"I just received this dvd set on tuesday and by thursday I have learned to cast on the proper way, knit, purl, increase, decrease, cast off, hold my yarn the proper way etc. etc. Tracy is the greatest!! I feel like I went from an insecure beginner to a confident intermediate knitter in just two days.  I haven't even begun dvd lesson number 3, but I am secure in the fact that I will master it and become an intermediate or better knitter because of this awesome teacher.  She is friendly, patient, and very pleasant and caring as she guides you through each step of the way.  I hope she will put out another series where she teaches you to understand knitting patterns.  Thanks Tracy!!",1111017600,,686,4.464
2191559,5,B0006Q7F2Y,"Applause, applause for this OUTSTANDING video.  The instructor gives clear, explicit directions and the camera shots are excellent.  The instructor speaks clearly and is pleasant to look at.  Her directions are easy to follow and reinforces each lesson with a review.  I highly recommend this video.  You will be most pleased.",1109894400,,326,5.313725490196078
2191560,5,B0006Q7F2Y,"This fabulous DVD series is a MUST for those young and younger who, like me, can't knit and feel like they cannot learn.  The instructions are so easy to follow that even I could do it with ease!  The end result is well worth the investment. I highly recommend this DVD set!  It would also make a great gift for some lucky recipient.  Have fun!",1105401600,,344,4.246153846153846
2191561,5,B0006Q7F2Y,This dvd was easy to understand.  I was knitting before I knew it. The instructions were clear and precise and the camera focused on the hands knitting showing me exactly what I needed to see in order to duplicate the steps. When I was through I had a completed item to use and I could hardly wait to go to the next dvd and get started.  I actually can knit.  Thanxamillion,1105401600,,373,4.225352112676056
2191572,5,B0006Q7F2Y,"I recently purchased, American Knitter's, ""Learn How to Knit"" and I am THRILLED! These DVD's actually teach three knitting projects from start to finish! These are the lessons I have been waiting for. They are well filmed, the sound is good, and the lessons are great. Professional knitting instructor, Tracie Wunderlich, is personable and communicates the knitting techniques with real enthusiasm! Knitting is a craft to be enjoyed! I certainly enjoyed watching all 3 DVD's. If you love to knit and to learn new stuff like I do, you'll love American Knitter's, ""Learn How to Knit"".",1102896000,,582,5.072916666666667
8042479,3,B0006Q7F2Y,"I am not sure if this would help someone else learn to knit or not. I still don't know how. I am more of a show me and I can do it kind of person, but didn't gain much form this. But then, maybe its me. I want to learn to knit, but this dvd set didn't do it for me.",1354147200,,265,3.360655737704918
8042480,3,B0006Q7F2Y,"I agree with the other reviewers. It is very hard to see the stitches using dark yarn -- much easier to see stitches and how the stitches are made using light/white colored yarn. However, I do think Tracie does a good job instructing how to knit mittens. I have a number of learning DVDs and her disk 2 is the first one that showed me clearly how to knit mittens -- and gave me the confidence to proceed with the project. She demonstrates at a good pace, and I really like the instructions of how to figure your pattern from inches/ calculations vs following specific rows. This allows much greater flexibility to knit mittens for others and in my opinion is easier to follow the project (as a beginner knitter).",1321401600,,712,4.484615384615385
8042481,4,B0006Q7F2Y,"I have always wanted to learn to knit and make my own scarves, hats, and couch throws.  After spending 40 years sewing I wanted to learn a new needlecraft skill.  I bought this DVD set and found the instructor was helpful; however I agree with several other reviewers that her fingernails were very distracting.  Instead of concentrating on the needles and yarn and her hand movements, I found myself looking at the long tiger-striped fingernails, which actually get in the way of the knitting in some of the scenes.  I don't understand why the producer or someone didn't ask the teacher to cut her nails because every knitter that I know has short nails!  I would think long fingernails would impede your knitting speed and just be very annoying.  I am still learning, and other than the nails I found this video set helpful.",1246492800,,826,4.701388888888889
8042482,4,B0006Q7F2Y,"Yes, there are things about this video that are a little annoying, but, the bottom line is that the directions are clear and easy to follow so even a novice knitter can complete the projects. There are lots of good close ups, and she uses nice big needles and yarn so it is easy to see what she is doing. If you are a beginner knitter, get this DVD, it will really help you get started.",1242259200,,386,4.092105263157895
8042483,1,B0006Q7F2Y,"I'm posting this review on ALL of the disc sites I can find for any of these discs!
I didn't have any reviews to go by when I bought this, and I wish I'd waited, but then that would have been someone else's tough luck.

I ordered the set of 5 videos and WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT!

First, each DVD contains MAYBE one hour of instruction, so these could have all been put on one video & been a much better deal.
Secondly, altho the teaching is fair, this doesn't teach anything you couldn't learn yourself from a product called ""I Taught Myself How to Knit!"", which comes with needles & the basic necessities you need to start knitting.
The Fair Isle DVD doesn't actually teach you two-handed Fair Isle color knitting, which is what I really wanted to learn. It teaches you how to knit right-handed with two colors, laying one down & picking the other up - THIS IS NOT 2-HANDED KNITTING!

All in all, I'm very disappointed in the set of DVDs; I wouldn't recommend them to anyone, unless you find a used set of all 5 DVDs (probably mine!), here or at a garage sale; and I wouldn't recommend you spend more than $5 for all of them.",1236211200,,1124,4.317535545023697
8042484,5,B0006Q7F2Y,"I love this DVD.  I've never knitted before, and the instructor in this DVD is great.  She teaches slowly step by step, and there are clear places in the DVD to pause, continue your work at your own speed, and then pick right back up at the next step by pressing play.  The camera work is perfect, and the instructors hands stay in the frame the whole time.

I also bought the ""I Can't Believe I'm Crocheting"" DVD to learn that as well, and this knitting DVD blows that one out of the water.  There is no comparison; this one is great for beginners!!!",1233100800,,551,4.259615384615385
8042485,1,B0006Q7F2Y,"I can't believe how unprofessional this product is. To start, she's sitting in a chair. She looks like a mess! The camera angle is over her right shoulder. EVERY stitch she does is blocked by her right hand. THANK goodness I already know how to knit. I wanted to learn a little more but I didn't. If your a BEGINNER DO NOT buy this. She goes so so fast you won't be able to keep up. Plus,like I said already, her hand blocks every stitch she makes. How can you see how to put the yarn around the needle when she blocks the view of the camera with her big hand. She should be over a white table and light yarn. She uses Dark Green yarn to start off. How can a beginner see anything when she knits in that manner. It's a joke. The camera should be over her hands so what you see on TV is what the KNITTER is looking at. She doesn't have patterns for the 3 items she makes. In the items she knits she does increases and decreases WITHOUT TELLING YOU the name of it. What good does it do if a beginner doesn't have the name of the increase/decrease. You can't apply it to a your own items/patterns. There are half a dozen EACH. She doesn't tell you the other increases/decreases. She does things without even explaining them. For example CABLES. Sometimes the camera is completely off of her hand.

I was SO looking forward to this but IT'S GETTING RETURNED!!",1212364800,,1355,4.251937984496124
8042486,3,B0006Q7F2Y,"I got a preview of these DVD's in another product I ordered.  Tracie is enthusiastic and a good instructor, however, I returned my DVD set (unopened) because of Tracie's nails -- dragon lady nails with stripes painted on them, it is VERY distracting, your eyes really keep going to her nails. I looked at the video and thought, how can someone allow that?  I have other DVD's and all of the instructors have clean, cut nails. If HillsBros, comes out with a revised version of this DVD, I'll be happy to order it again.",1192492800,,518,4.5
8042487,4,B0006Q7F2Y,"For those of you for which the book instruction is not enough. This is a GREAT instructional dvd. This is a wonderful way to learn to knit using needles. You can stop, start, and slow down the dvd.  The pace was slow enough for you to follow along, but not too slow.  The speech was clear and concise. Just perfect for the beginner. You learn at YOUR own pace. Repeat something as many times as you need to get it right.  No pressure!  It was great!  When I completed my first project, I was so proud!  This is a great dvd and a wonderfully pleasant way to learn. I would also like to highly recommend the round loom knitting dvd by the same company.  [...] has a sample clip of a lesson.",1169164800,,688,4.166666666666667
8042488,5,B0006Q7F2Y,I enjoyed this dvd set.  It was very helpful and I've already knitted 5 pot holders from disc 1.  This is a perfect dvd learning set for American/Throw knitters. Good buy for the price -- recommended.,1163116800,,200,4.527777777777778
