8532166,5,B008XGTXVU,"Not to be missed.

If you love BBC then take a ride with Hunderby and enjoy some bloody great British humor.  So tongue and cheek, Hunderby will have you gasping and jaw dropping from the start. Not at all what you are expecting.

This is a storylline you just can't guess.",1491004800,,273,4.313725490196078
8532167,3,B008XGTXVU,"I stumbled across Hunderby looking for good Briitish shows.  Good gracious in heaven above -- what an irreverent dark comedy that only British humor could devise. You'll either be appalled or will laugh your head off.  I sat midground. The show does have it's redeeming qualities (or maybe not).  This type of humor, however, has never been my cup of tea. Nevertheless, it is clever but a morally shocking comedic story of 1830 England and one very strange group of people.

The story begins with a shipwreck and a woman who washes up on shore by the name of Helene.  However, that's not really her name because she's a stowaway running from her past.  Immediately, after being revived by the doctor while others took her for dead, she is courted by Edmund, a brimstone preaching vicar who is a crude man.  When Helene marries him and comes to live in his rather large house, things turn even darker and creepier than Jane Eyre and the mad wife locked away.  Frankly, there is a madwoman, but she's wandering around as the as the housekeeper named Dorothy.

Helene quickly becomes disillusioned with her new life and falls for the advances of the doctor who saved her life. They begin this rather entertaining affair, copulating at every turn.  In the meantime, her vicar husband is finding that he has a sexual propensity toward men and, in particular, one of his servants.  All the while in the background, the crazy housekeeper is out to discredit Helene any way that she can because she's in love with Edmund.

The series is dark. The humor is crude.  And the ending a hoot.  If you like the kind of twisted dark humor that will give you a laugh and the willies at the same time, Hunderby is the one for you!",1430092800,,1712,4.588815789473684
8532168,5,B008XGTXVU,"Puts Downton Abbey to shame. OK, I confess going into it that I thought it was straight, but quickly wised up. The fellow who plays our romantic hero, the good doctor, is especially hilarious. You have to love lines such as ""Your hair is looking well.""",1427068800,,252,4.5
8532169,5,B008XGTXVU,I don't remember how I discovered this show but it's HILARIOUS!,1417392000,,63,4.818181818181818
8532170,5,B008XGTXVU,"Great spoof on all the BBC period serial dramas (soap operas).  I loved it.  It's refreshing to find the BBC poking fun at itself and some of the more ""serious"" dramas it produces.  Hunderby is a fun and enjoyable trip into the past.",1415491200,2,233,4.372093023255814
8532171,5,B008XGTXVU,"When I first became aware of this strange show set in the early 19th century written by Julia Davis (whose work I adore!) I knew I had to see/own it. However, the few clips I watched online made me somewhat hesitant as the show came off as a bit over-the-top silly. Still, despite my skepticism I went ahead and ordered it and I am so glad I did.

I fell in love with the style, language, atmosphere, comedy and deliciously written characters from the very start and ended up watching the entire series all the way through in one evening.  And just like the previous reviewer I was literally howling with laughter throughout.

Highly recommended for anyone who appreciates dark humour, silliness and very well made period costume dramas :)",1381449600,2,739,4.6692307692307695
8532172,5,B008XGTXVU,"Have to say I howled with laughter watching this.

Must watch if you like surreal/british comedy (Spaced, The IT Crowd etc)",1379289600,2,123,4.857142857142857
