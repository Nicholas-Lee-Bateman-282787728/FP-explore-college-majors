2775043,4,B000NO2416,"If you're looking for a good overview of the major themes of the Early Middle Ages, this is a good place to start. Picking up on the recent spate of ""Late Antiquity"" scholarship, it begins the story of the Early Middle Ages with fall of Rome. There are rampaging Visigoths aplenty as Rome falls to Alaric and his pals in 410 AD.

The section on Byzantium will look familiar to those who have seen the History Channel series on ""Engineering An Empire"" - but still fits nicely here. Historical re-enactments are better than average, and the scholars slightly less bizarre than the usual History Channel lot.",1199664000,7,605,4.7075471698113205

The rise of the barbarian kingdoms (which would later become nation-states), Byzantine intrigue, the Plague, the role of the Church, the expansion of Islam and the Viking raids are all presented to the viewer. The use of some computer graphics and actor portrayals makes the subject come alive. Of course, this can hardly be considered an in-depth look but as an introduction or just a dalliance into a field you have no intention of becoming an expert in it serves well. The seperate program on The Plague is also quite interesting and well done.",1197763200,22,689,4.8474576271186445

Suffice it to say that there is almost nothing good I can say about it--I guess maybe the music is ok, but otherwise it's worthless: the reenactments are cheap, juvenile, cheesy,laughable and misleading, especially the portrayal of Justinian, as well as the battle scenes (complete with horsemen riding with stirrups which would not appear in the west for another 300 years).

2775050,5,B000NO2416,"The History Channel really delivers in this awesome documentary on the history of The Dark Ages, the period between the Fall of the Roman Empire and the rise of the Middle Ages.  It is generally remembered as a bleak  period when civilization in the West teetered on the verge of total collapse and barbarian warlords fought with each other when they weren't busy fighting Viking hordes, Muslim invaders, or Byzantine armies.

The Dark Ages uses recent scholarship and high production values to recreate the period just after the fall of Rome in the late 5th century A.D.  The Roman Empire in the West had collapsed and a ragtag band of barbarians made up of Goths, Vandals, Franks, and Lombards wage bloody warfare against each other to divide up the pieces of the once-great Empire.  In the East, the remnants of the Empire live on under the Emperor Justinian who becomes obsessed with recapturing Rome and reconquering the West.  Meanwhile, the Franks, easily the most powerful of the post-Roman tribes, have begun to establish a great kingdom under the Merovingian dynasty, led by King Clovis, whose conversion to Christianity helps secure its place in the history of Europe.  The documentary then touches on the Viking raids along the English and Irish coasts, the desperate struggle to crush the invading Muslim armies that threaten to capture all of Spain and France, and ultimately, the consolidation of Western Europe as part of the Holy Roman Empire under Charlemagne.

This is probably one of the best History Channel DVDs out there and shows that a good amount of time and effort went into create this production.  While of course it cannot tell every detail of the nearly 500 year period of the Dark Ages, it does a good job of providing an excellent introduction to the subject.  It is one which recommends itself to anyone who claims to be a student of history.",1184198400,219,1876,4.852664576802508

2775080,3,B000NO2416,"Generally speaking is very, very good but it could have been great.

Cons 1: Mostly the initial part where it talks about the fall of western Rome. The Alaric chapter is awful. They mention Alaric pursued promotion inside the hierarchy when what he actually wanted was land to settle which Rome promised was a topic that Honorius always dodged. btw no mention to Stylicho or Honorius. Even way before in the timeline there is no mention on the Hunnic migration that forced the vandal, visigoth, saxon, frank migration and the battle of Adrianopole, why it occured and why was it so important. No mention to Genseric, Odoacre & Romulus Agustulus; Atila & Aetius; nor Theodoric, Zenon, the Ostrogothic reign  etc. All this is critical to understand the fall of Rome.  On Justinian campaign there is no mention to the main general Belisarius. Too much time spent on Justinian and her wife. I know.. the film is not focused on the fall on Rome but what happened after. Anyway if they speak of the fall of rome it could have been better.

Cons 2: Lastly it is weird there is no mention to the raids of Vikings in France and Italy nor mention to the origin of the Normans in those 2 regions and what about William the conqueror plus battle of Hastings?. That would have been nice to close the loop on the AngloSaxon-Viking-Norman-Franks salad and prelude to the Crusades.

Anyway there is a lot of interesting material by the interviewed historians.",1478044800,,1443,4.7103174603174605

I read many of the reviews before purchasing and have to comment on some of the negatives. Yes, some of the details are inaccurate: the costumes, the housing, the actual living conditions. This period covers hundreds of years. If one were to do a documentary today of the USA from 1776 to 2016, the conditions, costumes, housing have changed dramatically. How would a filmmaker depict the age of USA? It is, to my mind, more important to convey the events as accurately as possible and this film does exactly that. The history is a matter of record. The film attempts to make the history palatable to the current generation. It succeeds. I was particularly interested in the bonus feature about the details of the plague of the 14th century and its after effect on the modern evolution of Europe. With the demise of half the population because of plague, Europe prospered in a way that would not have been possible which, in turn, led to mechanization and to our modern era.

2775130,2,B000NO2416,"I'm surprised they still make documentaries like this one. The Dark Ages contains all the usual stereotypes and distortions about how the glorious Roman Empire fell to the barbarians and most of Europe descended into the dark and gloomy Middle Ages, until the light of the Renaissance dawned 1000 years later. The pun is probably unintended, but it *is* funny that the barbarians are often referred to as Gothic rather than Goths. Not wrong per se, but it does conjure up the right wiccan-Satanic images. There is a Gothic obsession in this show with torture chambers and their screaming victims, some of which are shown repeatedly. The Dark Ages is apparently not for kids, or those faint of heart!

I'm not saying everything in this documentary is wrong. In fact, the historians interviewed often make correct statements which the narrator then distorts beyond recognition. Thus, several talking heads point out that Europe's development turned around for the better already during the High Middle Ages, yet the narrator then interprets this as a reference to the Renaissance! Another historian mentions the salient fact that it was Emperor Justinian's armies, not the barbarians, who devastated most of Italy. So whose fault was the Dark Age *really*? While some scholars interviewed have a very positive view of the Roman Empire, others point out (correctly) that the empire's decline began several centuries before the much touted fall of Rome. Civil wars, economic stagnation and (admittedly) invasion attempts by Germanic tribes were facts of life long before Alaric's infamous sack of Rome.

The most egregious factual error is surely the claim that the Visigoths were heathens. Actually, they were Arian Christians. By not even mentioning Visigoth Spain, Ostrogoth Italy and Vandal North Africa  three barbarian kingdoms which were on a relatively high level economically and culturally  the documentary creates the false impression that the darkest period of the Middle Ages began almost immediately after the fall of Rome to the Visigoths, and that only the East Roman Empire preserved a modicum of civilization. The Dark Ages is also confusing at times, shifting attention back and forth between the Frankish realms and Britain, as if they were the same political entity. And while the Vikings were indeed a bunch of butchers, even the Devil should be given his due. The Vikings (or rather the Norse) didn't come as marauders to Iceland or Vinland, they created regular settlements there. Iceland was uninhabited before the Norse colonization, apart from a few Irish monks.

On the plus side, Charles Martell and Charlemagne are treated as the good guys, and we are spared all the pro-Muslim (really pro-Islamist) propaganda. The treatment of Christianity is rather weak, but the civilizing mission of Christian monks during the Early Middle Ages is stressed. The role of Bede is emphasized in particular.

However, this can't change the basic fact that the simplistic view of the Middle Ages presented in The Dark Ages feels both dark and very aged

2775131,3,B000NO2416,"Good revelations. I liked the video, even though it missed out on some of the influences that revitalized the euro-civilizations.

2775174,5,B000NO2416,"This lushly produced 90-minute History Channel documentary does a pretty admirable job of covering some major figures and events of the Early Middle Ages or ""Dark Ages,"" i.e. the period of European history between the fall of the Roman Empire in the 5th century that represented the end of classical antiquity and the First Crusade in the 11th century that heralded the start of Europe's rise to world dominance.

It finds an admirable central narrative regarding Europe's emergence from political and cultural chaos after the fall of Rome, depicting both the negative elements (continual war) and positive elements (monastic outposts of learning under men like St. Benedict and St. Bede) of that period. Much is omitted, of course, but what's included moves pretty quickly and is fairly compelling. This video is really one of the best History Channel documentaries I've seen, giving us a relatively balanced view of history (both the good and bad) while avoiding many of the staple weaknesses of that channel's productions. Unlike the 1990s documentaries, it isn't talky or biased, reveling in anti-religious intellectual hubris. Unlike the early 2000s documentaries, including the lamentable production ""The Plague"" that is appended to this disc as a special feature, it also doesn't revel in the grotesque elements of past events in an effort to convince us how ignorant people were in the past and how enlightened we are today by comparison. (There is one fairly gruesome and unnecessary re-creation of a Viking disembowlment torture, but that's about it.) Nor does it give us endless, repetitive, or cheesy battle re-enactments that limit our view of history to military events. Rather, we get a fast-moving overview of Europe's gradual emergence from post-Roman chaos that embraces multiple elements of medieval life, including well-chosen experts who are quoted in acceptable sound bytes to supplement a narrator who (unlike some History Channel documentaries) doesn't go to excess in over-simplifying events.

I was pleasantly surprised that the film even treated the Crusades with a reasonable amount of balance, declining to engage in the relentless criticism favored by many post-9/11 scholars, and that it is also fair to the medieval Catholic Church. Although the film admits that Christian knights wrought a great deal of destruction in the Middle East, it also notes that the Muslims had invaded Spain in the 8th century, acknowledging at least tacitly that the Crusades were in fact a much-belated counter-attack on Europe's part to check several centuries of Islamic aggression and expansion. It generally presents the Catholic Church as a humanizing rather than incendiary influence on Europe's plunder-driven knights, directing them outward in a necessary effort to unite Europe against Islamic incursion after centuries of internal warfare -- a unity that is arguably unduplicated in all of Europe's subsequent history down to the present day. It's odd that the narrator at one point calls the Crusades an act of ""vengeance"" despite the film showing far more nuance overall in explaining European motives. In fact, the film concludes on the surprising and rather nuanced note that Crusaders brought back knowledge and culture from the Holy Land that aided Europe's rise to global prominence. That level of nuance (i.e. that the primary benefit of the Crusades to Europe was NOT loot, plunder, or bloodlust) is something I haven't seen in any other History Channel or A&E documentary -- and is almost worth the DVD purchase in itself.

The drama where the citizens turn on Justinian and he is about to flee, but Theodora refuses and instead he massacres the Byzantium's citizenry is splendidly captured.

For people that have a difficult time reading or listening, it does provide a titillating visual narrative that vaguely resembles something involving the period; and if nothing else it teaches viewers a few important names they may have not previously heard.

Whenever there is an opportunity to employ gratuitous gore or salacity, despite actual historical veracity or certainty, they take it. And they take it over the top. As a result, it is very hard to take much of anything here seriously. The opening vignette about Alaric and the Visigothic ""sack"" of Rome in 410AD mischaracterizes the event at a very fundamental level...and without deconstructing every detail, the ""history"" content goes downhill from there. Despite having rather clownish and over-the-top commentaries from actual historians (that apparently hold positions in universities), I cannot imagine this material as a whole was vetted by a professional historian.

The use of live actors in short dramatic vignettes (whom we never actually hear speak) that are closely based on depictions in Renaissance paintings is really quite comical. And in the case of Justinian, the live actor is made to look exactly like the depiction of him in the famous San Vitale mosaic in Ravenna. I laughed. Out loud. Repeatedly.

Comedy aside, I think a lot of viewers will find the way historical personages come alive very appealing. And therein lies this mockudramas only merit. And if that prompts people to read actual/real history, then indeed that would be a positive.",1356134400,9,1591,5.251968503937008

No nuances about the Arabian Middle Ages, the role of the Jewish culture, the positive role of the Vikings in trade and exploration. Simplistic repetition of common places that may be expected in a Hollywood movie. But this is the History Channel! Could they not have used Romanic Churches and contemporary monasteries? Perhaps just avoided using buildings that belong to ten centuries after? There are very many surviving illustrations, sculptures and paintings of the centuries from V to X as to get it right. Unfortunately they opted for a cheap solution, ""outsourcing"" the production to totally wrong locations. This documentary was a serious dissapointment.

Several specific dates are mentioned, using a readable graphic and maps as necessary to impress.

Surprisingly, it doesn't fall into the myths propagated by public education. Sure, it still focuses on the ""dark"" parts of the Middle Ages, but it shows how Christianity pulled people out of the darkness and even in the worst of times gave them hope. Yes, it didn't stop all the death and destruction and there were those who abused it, but that is the fallen nature of man. The DVD includes an additional special on the Black Death and gives it a full treatment. Not as good as the main show and it likes to repeat things, but it expands on the event that almost ended the progress the late Middle Ages was experiencing. Ironically, the Black Death would open things up in many ways for society to bounce back even more (but of course, losing 50% of the population wasn't the most ideal way to proceed). The ""Dark Ages"" is a worthwhile production, but like any show, any one of the events or people it touchs on can be expanded into many more productions.

2775233,4,B000NO2416,"The History Channel's ""The Dark Ages"" is an entertaining documentary with exciting narrative, music, graphics, and reenactments.  A lot of actors, costumes, and sets were used in Lithuania to show the events from those times.  A glimpse of ""The Making of the Dark Ages"" is included as a bonus on this DVD.  The documentary covers the year Rome fell (410 A.D.) until the Crusades were launched on the Middle East in 1095 A.D.  The 90-minute documentary covers about seven centuries of history; thus, scholars will no doubt find important events or persons left out or glossed over.  For those wanting a general overview of the period that might spark an interest in specific events and people, I think they did a good job.  Documentaries on The History Channel are meant to be entertaining first and foremost and this one is.

Although, experts occasionally point out that the Dark Ages weren't always ""dark"" and were not ""dark"" for everyone, one would not be keen to live back in those days after watching this documentary.  It focuses on violence, superstition, starvation, disease, and suffering. It was a time where society seemed to digress from the days of Rome that left the great architectural structures laying in ruins around them.

Some of the subjects covered are Clovis, whose conversion to Christianity united the barbarian tribes of France to become the superpower known as the Franks; Justinian and his wife Theodora, Eastern rulers who wanted to reunite with the West; Charles ""The Hammer"" Martel (which sounds like the name of a wrestler), who led the Franks in their defeat of the Moors in 732 A.D.; and his grandson Charlemagne, King of the Franks, who encouraged education, creativity, and literacy.  Other topics covered are St. Benedict, the Vikings, the roles of knights and the clergy (Christianity is looked at as a source of violence but also as a unifying force in this documentary), and the aftermath of the Crusades which spawned advances in architecture, markets, infrastructure, tourism and were aided by the good luck of warmer weather.  One thing I learned was, unlike romantic tales, ""Your typical Medieval Knight had much more in common with Tony Soprano than with Lancelot"" (Philip Daileader, professor at William and Mary).

One curious fault I found in this documentary is, there is a misuse in designating centuries.  For example, they mention the year 730 A.D. and call it the seventh century.  It is actually the eighth century just like the 2000s today is the 21st century.  I do not remember whether it is the narrator or the experts being interviewed doing this, but it happened several times and is quite an obvious error.  This error aside, the documentary is fast-paced and well-done.  Besides the 11-minute ""Making of"" extra, it also includes the 90-minute bonus documentary ""The Plague"" which really makes this DVD a good value.",1324252800,2,2877,5.010504201680672
2775234,4,B000NO2416,"My first complaint is that it's too short. It's virtually impossible to cover 685 years into a 90 minute Documentary. However, considering the History Channel can be Hit and Misses with their documentaries, it's a solid video. My second complaint, not accurate with the weaponry and armor, but at least they didn't have the actors talk in English when they did speak.

Enough of the complaints, for now. This video was to be an introduction for getting more involved with the History of the 'Dark Ages'(I prefer the term Middle Ages). It does a good job of highlighting certain events and people, with Clovis, Charlemagne, Battle of Tours, Justinian, and Alfred. They also take notice to mention of the rise of power of the Catholic church, and the start of the Benedictine Monasteries, which usually goes unmentioned in the so-called Dark Ages. This should be taken as a introduction video for people who wish to get interested in this era, and nothing more. For example, I could say, they mention a practical unknown king Aella of Northumbria, and Ivar the Boneless just because of his nickname origins and a torture method, when Rollo the Viking is the most important Viking of the time period (considering he settled in Normandy, future siting of William the Conqueror). Or the lack of talk of the Byzantine Empire past Justinian,(when they could mention details their battles to stop the Islamic conquest campaigns in Eastern Europe before Martel at Tours), or not enough detail of Al-Andalus (which Moorish Spain was very instrumental in providing mathematical, science, and idealogical information to Europe, the Iberian Penisula mainly, before the Crusades), or even the fact that the Muslims reached as far as Italy before the time period of the video (1095) ends. Or even Attila the Hun's attempt to conquer Rome, or the Great Schism. But I don't need to judge factors just as these with 'starter' videos.

But they mention events/people such as the Viking Raids, Spread of Islam, Venerable Bede, the Plague of Justinian, (not confused with the 'Black Death', as that consisted of the bubonic and pneumonic plagues, Justinian's plague was just bubonic) in a summarizing fashion, which is to be done with introduction-type videos. Those who rate it low are obviously viewing it in the wrong perspective, as you can't give an entire history of The 'Dark Ages' in 90 minutes, you just do your best to mention the highpoints. I still think it's too short, but they did a good job with the time alloted. 3.8 out of 5(round to 4).",1323129600,,2534,4.918224299065421

2775238,1,B000NO2416,"Trying to pack 1000 years of history into a one hour program is setting oneself up for failure from the start.

In this production, we learn little about social or political organizations and absolutely nothing about the daily lives of people, the technologies available to them and how those developed and improved over the years. We don't get as much as a hint at which crops they grew, how they grew them, how they stored and prepared food, built their homes and other structures, made clothing, treated injuries and illnesses, or defended themselves against wild animals.

Instead, we are treated to the usual ""the Dark Ages were filthy and violent"" fair, complete with detailed descriptions of torture. We witness the same mutilations and executions time after time, hear the same screams over and over, and see the same battle scene reenactments again and again (complete, as another reviewer pointed out, with cavalry using historically inaccurate gear, such as saddles, horseshoes and stirrups). Unfortunately, we don't get much information about why these people fought, and this leads me right back to the start of this review: It is impossible to give more than the most superficial overview of 1000 years of history in one hour.

This low-budget program does not educate viewers. All it does is depict popular prejudices against the Middle Ages.

This film follows closely the traditional view of the ""Dark Ages"" as overflowing with bloodshed, disease, isolation, illiteracy, and death of anything culturally ""advanced"". This was true to some extent but from the reading I've done it seems that this is not at all the consensus view among historians anymore. I would have liked this film a little better if they had shown other view points on the period as well, this would give a more balanced understanding. Overall Still a great buy. I do recommend this film, just be aware that this is not the end-all-be-all of understanding the ""Dark Ages"". Do your own research.

2775244,5,B000NO2416,"I highly recommend this introduction to the so called dark ages of Western Europe. The narration and recreations (well accomplished) go from 410 ac when the Visigoths sacked Rome for the first time since Celts did it in 390 bc, to the preliminaries of the First Crusade in 1095 ac. Contrary to other documentaries I have seen recently (e.g., The Normans, Kultur), this one has a frequent use of maps that help viewers to appreciate the spatial context of actions. I enjoyed as it touched some not so known episodes such as plagues that affected Byzantine plans to reestablish Western Roman Empire. Contrary to at least one previous reviewer, the DVD transfer comes with English captions. At least I was able to see them in my old TV.",1275782400,4,733,4.734375
2775245,3,B000NO2416,"At this time in history, the Byzantine Empire was more civilized and interesting than the Western Empire. While this video does mention Justinian and Theodora, it does so negatively, and otherwise ignores the East. Yet it was the East that recaptured large portions of the Western Empire and established some measure of order at its western capital of Ravenna.

Plenty of mention of Alaric, Clovis and Charlemagne, but none of Belisarius or Theodoric, both of whom played major roles in Italy.

A nice feature in the bonus tracks is a long program on the Plague, which I thought was better than the main program.",1273795200,11,612,4.875
2775246,4,B000NO2416,"Mixed bag, but when the chapters are good, they're really good. The most lacking chapter is the one on Alaric where they've glossed over his background (why the Visigoths wanted to take over Rome in the first place) and rush through the sacking of Rome in just under 8 minutes.  Other chapters are AMAZING: Rise of Christianity (Clovis) and the Fravks v. Moors in Ch8 especially .  Here's a full lineup if it helps anyone:

First of all, the video is 90 minutes so please ignore the posts that say only 30 minutes!  I actually used this video to help bring my junior high text alive for students and they loved it!  It took us three days to go through the video, discuss scenes, and read the corresponding text from our book.  Students really enjoyed the parts concerning the Vikings - especially the ""blood eagle"".  As a teacher, I was please with the Vikings portion because our book only contained a footnote concerning their role in the Dark Ages.  However the video does not discuss their travels to America.  Basil II is not mentioned at all and Constantine not nearly enough.  However Justinian, Theodora, the plague, Charlemagne, the priesthood/Catholic Church, Clovis, and more are discussed at length!

2775250,5,B000NO2416,"I agree with the person who wrote the ""Not so dark ages"" one; it does leave you wanting more.  It is sad because in the amount of time they had they hardly touched the Vikings, the crusades, the black plague, and the fall of Rome was very brief as well.  For 90 minutes they did a very good job placing as much as they could in it.  I just wish it would have been a week special with five 50 minute episodes making it closer to 250 minutes.  They could have focused more on all of it.
It goes back and forth a little too.  This makes it hard if you get interrupted once or twice. One minute they are discussing 700's then they jump back in time to the 500's for a moment.  It is brought together very well, when you watch it.  Just pause and rewind for all interruptions so you do not get lost.

2775251,5,B000NO2416,"I caught this installment of the History Channel earlier this week, and I was hooked from beginning to end. Providing acting that managed to get the point across without being overly dramatic and cheesy (as you would expect), and giving a well formed synopsis of the Dark Ages, it is a must see for anyone who is fascinated by history.

What amazed me was that there was enough commentary by historians to provide the necessary substance to a show like this, but plenty on a purely entertainment level as well. My three-year-old daughter even watched alongside me, something she has never been interested in doing before.

A+ in my book, and worth a look for anyone who has an interest in the nature of empires and modern society.",1244851200,4,730,4.6953125

There's enough here for a good horror movie. Kids will enjoy this. I did.",1241308800,4,331,4.928571428571429
2775263,5,B000NO2416,"Personally for me, this ""Age"" of history has long held a fascination for me.  History channel seems to have a talent for presenting complex issues and events in a concise manner.  One reviewer mentioned it only being 30 minutes long, but I watched 94 minutes of well presented history.

Besides the content, it always amazes me the level of competence in these films, and the narration that allows one to understand the material.  One is always left with a hunger for more, which is usually satisfied in the next segment.

The names and characters are presented well, and often, so I could add this knowledge to my base understanding.  If there is a complaint, it would be yearning for a more developed presentation of the culture that survived in the East, versus the West, yet that may be material for a separate DVD.  Being raised in the West, we are often not told what the East did in culture and maintaining ""classical"" knowledge, when the Fall of the Western Roman Empire started the loss of all that was good.

I left this DVD with a better understanding of the age, and a desire to dig deeper, which for me, is a winner!",1236384000,6,1129,4.554455445544554

This DVD follows a typical History Channel pattern of breaking up history into meaningful segments and illustrating broad social changes by focusing on specific events and individuals for illustration.

I have one minor production complaint:  Artistically, I thought that most of the re-enactments and computer-generated animations were fair.  Scenes featuring groups of people (notably armies) often seemed to be filmed from angles which would hide the fact that a small number of actors were involved.  Sadly for documentary producers, Hollywood has recently raised the bar on this sort of thing with big-budget productions like ""Gladiator"".  Transition graphics and narration are dramatic and slick, though I wish the maps were more precise and less artistic.",1230336000,5,921,5.398601398601398

2775268,3,B000NO2416,"This isn't one of the best of History Channel's documentaries for good reason -- it wasn't a well documented period in world history.  Consequently, the series seemed superficial at best and didn't convince me that it accurately portrayed this time period.  It seemed to have a limited budget and was a half baked effort.  Perhaps the depressing theme made it less than palatable for the production team.  Perhaps it was already known most people wouldn't bother to watch it for more than a few minutes because it was a boring expose of a dark period in human history.

There did seem to be a responsible toning down of the twisted dark things of that period as far as torture for fear of sensationalizing these aspects.  However, I must say this series was extremely boring and made me want to pick up a book of history rather than watch this drab documentary. It seemed to blame the entire Dark Ages on the fall of the Roman Empire and completely overlooked the harm fanatical religion caused.",1218326400,11,995,4.689655172413793

Only good thing about it, that this is only available documentary about early middle ages that exist in English. If not, it would receive two. Anyway the beginning was promising, the first problems began with Justinian and cheap acting. After that things went worse with portrayal of Charlemagne, it was more said about his love affairs than his campaigns and renovation of Europe. Then I left stunned - there wasn't any mention about HRE, but instead some story about one viking warlord, totally uncomparable with other rulers in DA! After all there wasn't any mention about Basil II, one of greatest persons on the end of early medieval time, there were some sad explanations about beginning of crusades, but more child stories then real history. Sad. It started very promising, but last 30 minutes was BIG waste of time.
