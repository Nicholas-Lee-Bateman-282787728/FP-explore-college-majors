7897355,5,6305875642,"The Franklin series of videos and books offer wonderful animation and these stories will teach your children valuable lessons.  ""Franklin in the Dark"" illustrates that you don't need to fear the dark through a lovely story told by Mrs. Turtle.
The adventures of Franklin, Bear, Beaver, Fox, and Goose allow kids to learn while still having fun. The diversity of the characters (Badger walks with two canes) demonstrates that all kids can play together, no matter what may look different.
A pleasant series to enjoy (I watch Franklin  sometimes without my kids! Because I am still a kid at heart).  Worth 5 stars.",1031961600,,612,4.922330097087379
