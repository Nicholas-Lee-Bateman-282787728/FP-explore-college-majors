8641609,5,B00IEQC34S,This is my favorite barre DVD with Finis.  It provides a good amount of workout and the exercises are very effective on strengthening your feet (which is essential for ballet).  The movements are so elegant and well paired with the music that I feel like dancing at the barre.  It was fun and effective.  Can't be done better.  Thank you Finis!,1507593600,4,344,4.573770491803279
8641610,5,B00IEQC34S,Yet another wonderful DVD by Finis Jhung! Finis has made it possible to practice and study ballet at a sophisticated level for dancers who do not live in NYC. His library of DVDs is a treasure! I have used them for years and value them greatly.,1470355200,5,244,4.326086956521739

8641614,5,B00IEQC34S,"I've only had a chance to repeat the first few exercises so far, & his approach is already revolutionizing my functional balance from the feet and toes through the core muscles.  That is no exaggeration. Long-time issues are being functionally addressed, & under-active muscles are getting into the game as they should have been all along.",1404259200,34,339,5.053571428571429
