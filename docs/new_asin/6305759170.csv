7893764,4,6305759170,Not your typical kind of vampire film it goes back to the okd ages about the oldest of all vampires or something like that. Its an alright movie once it gets into the action the first half tells the story witch isn't a bad story if you sit down and follow it. I like this movie and give it a positive review.,1503360000,,308,3.9838709677419355

7893767,1,6305759170,"I need to go on record and say that everybody HAS to see this film. Why the certainty here? Figure it had to be a great film if I'm that adamant about it, right? Far from it. It's bad. Painfully bad.
I've yet to see all of the films that Fangoria has released, but I have caught a few. There was ""I, Zombie"" wgere an English guy begins eating people and gets morose for what seems like 12 hours. Then there was ""Lady of the Lake"" where a red headed girl gets naked... a lot. ""Angel"" wins the award for film I stared at hardest wondering why I'm wasting my life watching these things. It's basically a European vampire flick (I have little patience for wierdo foriegn directors. I'll tolerate Dario Argenta, but only because his daughters hot). Her's a plot synopsis in as few words as I can go:
Three friends go to a spooky old mansion that once belonged to a vampire. One of the friends is the great, great, etc. granddaughter of the old vamp. She tells the tale of a priest getting bitten by a muppet and changing into... an entirely different actor. This is Rico the vampire (Rico?). Upon hearing this story, the other two share thier tales of Rico the vampire (Rico?). The movie jumps around and stuff happens, but it never really commits to what. Just random vampire stories that try to leave out as much plot as possible so as not to comfuse the viewers. Finally (deep breath), the grandaughter ressurects Rico the vampire (Rico?), just so she can stab him, but not before he goes and bites one of the friends who is upstairs fooling around with the grandaughters boyfriend who manages to walk out of the movie unharmed even though he was the worst actor in the movie (and this film was dubbed so you know he had to reek). The movie ends with Rico (?) turning back into the actor from the beginning of the film and an angel carries him away (I really wish I was making some of this up).
Not only did the movie hurt, it was dubbed so bad, I kept expecting Godzilla to pop up.
So why is this film a must see? There's a guy in this movie that looks JUST LIKE ME!!! I mean it, total twin (If your at all interested, it's the lead gang member in the second story). This got me thinking. What if it's not just a similarity, but a clone created for the sole purpose of starring in Eurotrash movies that are to be unleashed on an unwitting American society causing a break down of all we hold dear?!? How cool would that be? It would make a pretty sweet film at the very least. I think I'll give Fangoria films a call.",1006473600,2,2516,4.28781512605042
7893768,3,6305759170,"The gore flows and the Dutch scream in this European import.  The fact that they rip off almost every vampire movie made after ""The Lost Boys"" is almost redeemed by a nicely paced screenplay and good effects.",982281600,,208,4.621621621621622
7893769,5,6305759170,"I saw this film via Pay Per View at about 5am.  I was expecting to watch 30 mins and then end up sleeping through the rest. I was so wrong!  If you're able to look past the influence from ""From Dusk Till  Dawn"", there lies an absolutely wonderful film - humorous, gory and  quiet smart. I'm glad I had the chance to see this on PayPerView, I  probably never would have seen it had I not been up all night channel  surfing!",961459200,,422,4.085365853658536
