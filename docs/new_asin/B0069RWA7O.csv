8495477,2,B0069RWA7O,"I have friends who produced a couple of these, so I wanted to see them, but I was a bit bored with some of the shorts. Check out Where the Bears Are online for other good gay bear content.",1387670400,,188,3.8461538461538463
8495478,4,B0069RWA7O,"I bought this item because I wanted to expand my bear film collection, there aren't a whole lot of movies/shows about bears. It came on time, watched and enjoyed, but wish that it had been a bit cheaper or that there had been more shorts on it. There are 12 altogether of those 3-4 have alot of nudity that leave you thinking ""Umm....o okay"" so you should view before viewing with friends or family. For that reason it feels more like there are only 7-8 shorts on the DvD, but those are still really great shorts that'll make you laugh alot.",1369094400,,541,4.366336633663367
8495479,4,B0069RWA7O,"it is 10 very cute shorts that anyone would enjoy, gay or straight. Very worthwhile to watch. very woofy men and good stories.",1339459200,,126,4.521739130434782
8495480,5,B0069RWA7O,"Overall these shorts are pretty good. There are a couple of great music videos, and the short narratives are really funny. My favorite is a toss up between 'Bearly Haunted' and 'Lord Cockworthy.'",1323388800,,195,4.9393939393939394
