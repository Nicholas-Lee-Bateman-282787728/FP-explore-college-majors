The Goonies is certainly a little dated (I didn't realize how much time the kids spent shouting nearly unintelligible and always unfunny adlibs) but satisfying to anyone who grew up on the film.  Beetlejuice still holds up well, probably due to the great art direction and music.  Both are great for little kids looking for spooky movies that won't traumatize them for life (both titles are PG-rated).",1189123200,,505,4.848837209302325

Beetlejuice is rated PG.
This coupling is an excellent idea.  Both films are original and have cult followings.
There's only so long fake reviewers can pretend....",1086739200,2,176,5.285714285714286
