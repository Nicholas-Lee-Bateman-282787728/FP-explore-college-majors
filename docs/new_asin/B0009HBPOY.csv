2290828,4,B0009HBPOY,"The show opens with the Gracie hunter Kazushi Sakuraba in a rematch with Nino Elvis Schembri.  In their previous fight Sakuraba was dominating until Schembri kneed him in the head, and Schembri picked up a surprise win.  Here in this fight, Sakuraba comes out in pajamas to make the point that the prior fight was just a bad dream, and now he's awake.  Sakuraba must be considered the favorite to win, going in, since he has a much stronger reputation.  Can Schembri pull out another upset?

The next match is an elimination bout to determine who will challenge Wanderlei Silva for the Pride championship belt.  Ricardo Arona, a Brazilian grappler, goes against Quinton Rampage Jackson, a black fighter with a lot of personality and a victory over Kevin Randleman.  Arona is known for his many Brazilian jiu jitsu championships, and Jackson is known for lifting his opponents high off the ground and slamming their heads down on the mat.  You have to watch when you do that, because you may end up cracking heads if you're not careful.  I can't say there is any particular favorite in this matchup.

I suppose that 7 foot tall Semmy Schilt could be considered the favorite in his match with Russian sambo expert Sergei Kharitonov, but not by much despite his 9 inch height advantage and sizeable weight advantage.  Kharitonov is a master of body positioning and grappling, so what he needs to do is get the big man down and nullify his size.  Schilt is a great striker, with knees and fists, and not just a big guy.  When Schilt is on his back he uses his awesome grip to restrain the other man's wrists.

In a battle of smooth technique against brawn, star grappler Naoya Ogawa, a confident crowd favorite, takes on the likeable Giant Silva.  Bas Rutten begins the interview with Silva by standing on a stool and looking down at the 7 foot 2 Goliath.  Silva has an awkward fighting style, so the question is really whether his extreme size advantage is enough against Ogawa's technique.

Master grappler Hidehiko Yoshida provides the very first MMA challenge to newcomer Mark Hunt of New Zealand.  Hunt is one of the best strikers in the world, a champion kick boxer who is new to mixed martial arts.  He is pretty chubby, but that doesn't hurt him.  One thing I will tell you in advance about this fight is that Mark Hunt clearly got a lot of good training in grappling because he isn't helpless at it.  Back in the early days of MMA Yoshida would have killed Hunt, but these days a guy like Hunt can get a crash course in grappling and put up a good showing.

The great submission artist Antonio Minotauro Nogueira takes on Heath Herring, a big strong guy who can hit.  Herring is known for his unique hair styles, with different designs shaved into his head.  It's Herring's toughness against Minotauro's wizardry on the ground.

The final match is world champion Fedor Emelianenko, ranked as the world's toughest man by most MMA fans, against Kevin Randleman, charismatic black fighter with bleached blonde crewcut.  Randleman is coming off an upset knockout victory over Mirko Crocop, but now he is in the ring against the world's toughest man, so obviously he has his work cut out.  Fedor is such a mild mannered man.  He reminds me of my father.  He's always pleasant and cheerful, never excited, and he generally has a gentle smile ready for whoever is unfortunate enough to be in the ring against him.  Obviously Fedor is an overwhelming favorite to win, but can Randleman pull out another stunning upset?  He has knockout power and a puncher's chance.",1144454400,4,3562,4.696774193548387

Lawrence M. Wold (in his review) said everything SO well. I'll try to add a little more.

For all the UFC fans that have not seen PRIDE, watch this and see what you have been missing. If you are new to the Mixed Martial Arts / Ultimate Fighting scene, this would be an awesome starter VIDEO.

The Fedor vs Randleman fight is one of my favorites, it is intense, could go both ways and had flair. Clips from that fight are shown on most Fedor highlight videos and on many PRIDE compilations.

These are good fights and good fighters. Check out Sherdog.com to see their stats. Here are some highlights of fighters that make this video exciting:

Antonio Rodrigo ""Minotauro"" Nogueira = one of the best of the best fighters in PRIDE, thus far he has only lost in 2 decision matches.

Herring = Good fighter, excellent striker, flamboyant

Silva = he is a 7'2 giant, 385lbs, it is awesome to see how he uses his amazing high.

Fedor Emelianenko = Currently the Champion of PRIDE. The only one to have beaten ""Nogueira"" twice (Decision though, but great fights). His consistant amazing fighting makes him one of my favorites.

Mark Hunt = extremely famous fighter from wayy back. The first DVD on MMA fighting was a highlight of his career. Great to see trying to make a come back.

Kazushi ""The Gracie Hunter"" Sakuraba = One of the most famous Japanese fighers in PRIDE. His style stands out.",1137888000,,1400,4.564

8060947,4,B0009HBPOY,"Critical Countdown was the second (semi-final) round of the 2004 Pride Heavyweight Grand Prix. Despite the field of sixteen challengers having been narrowed to eight, it remained an incredibly star-studded event: the list of fighters on this card is a virtual ""Who's Who"" -- not only of the heavyweight division, but, when you throw in the additional matches, of the best fighters of mixed martial arts during the mid-2000s.

The fight card featured the following bouts:

Antonio Rodrigo Nogueira vs Heath ""Texas Crazy Horse"" Herring: A highly motivated Herring looks for revenge against the guy who'd beaten him once before, Pride's interim heavyweight champion, Big Nog.

Fedor Emilianenko vs. Kevin Randelman: Randelman had just buried his father and came into this match on Father's Day, 2004; Fedor, on the other hand, was the reigning Pride heavyweight champ, yet coming off an injury. It features one of the great slams in the history of MMA, and considering what else happened on this card, that is saying something.

Sergei Kharitonov vs. Semmy Schilt: ""The Russian Mercenary"" Kharitonov had exploded onto the MMA scene with a brutal KO of Ninja Rua, but in Schilt he faced a kickboxing legend who scaled in at 7' tall. (I've seen Semmy in person, and he is HUGE.)

Naoya Ogawa vs Paulo ""Giant"" Silva: Speaking of seven-footers, this match pits Judo expert and ""great Japanese hope"" Ogawa vs. Giant Silva, who was 7'3"" and weighed 365 lbs. It's a case of skill vs. size...lots and LOTS of size.

Non-Tournament Bouts:

Kazushi Sakuraba vs. Elivs Schembri: The first time these two fought, Saku put a beating on the jiu-jitsu expert only to get caught with a knee and KO'd. The Japanese legend came looking for revenge, and Elvis came looking to repeat.

Quinton :""Rampage"" Jackson vs. Ricardo Arona; Two dangerous and colorful middleweight contenders meet in a fight that featured THE most notorious slam in MMA history.

Hidehiko Yoshida vs. Mark Hunt: Hunt is a minor MMA legend today, but at the time he was a K-1 champion looking to transition into MMA...against one of the best Judoka ever to strap on a gi.

Critical Countdown was a damned good card, much in the tradition of Pride and its wonderful Grand Prix tournaments, which allowed reigning divisional champions to compete for the GP belt without putting their own titles on the line. In addition to featuring more MMA legends you can shake a stick at, as well as all the glamor and pageantry that came with Pride shows, there are some genuinely entertaining fights here, including two bouts Fedor - Randelman and Jackson - Arona, which have rightly become legends. This DVD also includes a second disc loaded with special features, so all in all it's hard to go wrong. Enjoy the countdown!",1384128000,,2761,4.918279569892473

It's one of the most Ridiculously Awesome things I've ever scene in a MMA fight.  Anyways, I hope that we the fans will be able to purchase the entire Heavy Weight 2004 Grand Prix one day in the US. I did find the complete 2004 Grand Prix on Amazon UK, but when I watched it, it did not look the same. It didn't look live, it almost looked like they tried to convert it to a different lesser format and it came out looking stale and drab kind of when you watch shows from england like old Dr. Who or even the way the american show Unsolved Mysteries looked.",1332979200,,843,4.403846153846154
