3856479,5,B0026P61FA,"My daughter picked the Loki detective up Vol 1-Vol 5

I wasn't too thrilled when she showed them to me but once

we started watching them I could not wait to get home from work

to see the next vol. I was told that Vol 6 would be coming out

sometime later in Month of July but Vol 7 would not be out til

Sept. I like it a lot better when you have so many vols to a set,

if they would have them where you can buy them together and not have to wait. This was a great set and I would highly recommend everyone who likes norse gods and mysteries to buy this. You have several gods who are trying to kill Loki the god of mischief. As an adult he was a ladysman, but Odin put him in the body of a child and the ladies just think he is cute. When Loki is in his adult body all the girls fall over themselves. Loki battles evil and keeps it in flames in the storeroom in the basement of his home and when he collects enough he hopes to return to his normal size and return home to Asgard. Odin sends many gods to try to kill him and Loki is confused as to what he has done to deserve banishment and to have to defend himself from the other gods. Several of the gods that are on earth ended up being his friend and help him when the Gods sent to kill him come after him. Really a great addition to your DVD collection!!!",1153180800,4,1314,3.866171003717472
3856480,3,B0026P61FA,"Loki, the Norse God of mischief, has been thrown out of Asgard by his father Odin and trapped in the form of a little boy, a little fairy boy who runs around in shorts and a big bowtie, waving around a Cardcaptor Sakura staff, all of which seems a little weird in and of itself. Even though he looks like a normal human boy, his mind has not been effected, and he still has some magical powers, though reduced. Along with his assistant Yamino he runs the Enjaku Detective Agency which seems to investigate only paranormal activities. When a young girl named Mayura who happens to be a mystery otaku comes to Loki wanting his help to find a ghostly talking doll, Loki reluctantly takes the case. Of course, you know Mayura is going to bully her way into becoming the third member of the agency after the case is solved! There are other gods lurking in the shadows along with Loki, and some of them are following the orders of Odin, the order to KILL Loki!

Loki Ragnarok is a show I would describe best as ""harmless"". The character designs for the kids especially come off as entirely too dorky for my taste. I mean at least let Loki retain some dignity with his wardrobe for Pete's sake! You could put a dress on him and he'd be Cardcaptor Sakura! But this first volume does have its moments of humor, even if it's dragged down by the Loki pulling out his wand power-up sequences. Probably the best episode here is when Mayura's dad forbids her to hang out with the Detective Agency and to leave her little girl interests behind her. Loki, in A Christmas Carol like manner, lets them relive their memories of how Mayura first got it into her head to be a sleuth. While Loki is a decent show, I let it remain for future volumes to make me a real fan.",1153094400,,1749,4.365030674846626
3856481,5,B0026P61FA,"If you loved Case Closed or Spiral than this anime I recommend to you. It's mystery with a dash of comedy and Norse gods, a strange combination you might think but it actually works quite nicely. I loved volumes 1&2 and now I'm anxious to get volume 3, this series makes me giggle like a little school girl with it's humor and it's childish looks make me just want to smother the characters in hugs (especially Loki).",1139616000,4,417,4.428571428571429
3856482,4,B0026P61FA,"I bought this DVD simply because it sounded a bit interesting and, as it turns out, it was well worth the money. The opening and ending animations are gorgeous and the plot ranges from serious to very funny. After all, what could be more amusing than watching a god dress up in a giant anteater outfit to pay his rent?",1131408000,4,318,4.316666666666666
3856483,5,B0026P61FA,"This is a great show. I bought the edition with the collectors box and it was great, the collectors box is huge. This is a great show about Loki a Norse god sent down to earth in a childs body. It is a great show full of mystery and comedy like no other.

3856549,3,B0026P61FA,"Mythical Detective Loki Ragnarok is a great casual anime with charming characters and an entertaining story revolving around superstitions, aparitions and ghosts, and other nods to folklore. It's a delight to watch but does not delve too deeply into details or character development. The series is littered sufficiently with tropes for the casual anime watcher to enjoy without being bored. I rated it 3 stars as it is nothing fantastical nor new, but it is a great little series to watch or listen to as you do other tasks.",1447632000,3,524,4.898876404494382

3856558,3,B0026P61FA,"I love this series mostly because of nostalgia; I watched it when I was much younger, and adored it. Now it seems cheesy and silly, but I still sort of love it. Unfortunately it only got the one season, and its end is unsatisfying. It's an interesting (if selectively accurate) take on Norse mythology, and the animation is enjoyable. I wish various characters and relationships had gotten more development, and for more plotline resolution, but I'd say it's worth a watch if you're bored and looking for something to watch. The English dub isn't terrible, though there's some of the usual mild awkwardness. It's cliche overall, but cute with a little bit of spooky.",1442102400,2,666,4.850877192982456

3856562,3,B0026P61FA,Just so you know. It's an entertaining series. I first saw it subtitled and had no problems with the subtitles (subtitle tip: don't subvocalize). In English it just sounds goofy and I couldn't make it through the first five minutes.,1439942400,,232,4.825

3856612,2,B0026P61FA,These characters do not at all take on the persona of the Norese gods. The only mystery that Loki is being  a detective about is himself. Why did Odin cast him to earth was it because of his relationship with his daughter? Makes no sense especially when the characters are not what they have been portrade as in other books and comics. If Loki would have been mischiefing I could see the plot better but being humble and being subservant to his fellow gods and humans made no sense. They didn't even give a back story that gave a clue to his banishment and child like form.,1394841600,,573,4.355140186915888

3856618,5,B0026P61FA,At first I bought these DVDs on a whim becouse the name Loki was in the title and I am a huge fan of anime but now that I have watched the series I have no regrets the show catches you from the very beginning. I will be careful not to spoil anything but the story is enchanting watching as Loki is forced to midgard and to fight many that he once held so dear...but why would his blood brother Odin do this he must learn the reason of his banishment but can he before he is killed by someone he once held dear this should be an easy feat for Loki God of mischief but when a mystery loving girl tags along...will Loki ever return to Asgard?

3856621,2,B0026P61FA,I couldn't watch all of this. It wasn't anything new. The idea was but the characters were all stock. I felt I'd seen it before and better. What's worse is it's trying to make one feel emotional about it's storylines... but doesn't spend enough time building them up. They spend their time and development in the wrong places; a lot of times nothing relevant is going on. It feels as though they were trying to be dramatic but didn't really understand drama. Sometimes I get the feeling they were trying to be funny... but don't really understand humour. The action was brief and not very well done. Not terribly done. Just not well. The voice acting was the same (dub version). Nothing here is *terrible*... but it leaves a underwhelming feeling and gives no reason to continue watching.,1373155200,,788,4.717391304347826

3856629,4,B0026P61FA,"I over all liked the story, thou I would not have followed the Norse twist, if I had not read some reviews after watching an episode on Prime in the beginning, which was very helpful. It is an amusing (oriental) twist on norse gods, in human form, with odd adventures, and with this it is fun and a bit light hearted with a large back ground plot that builds along with it well. My only two complaints are the clothes Loki wears, given they seem badly outdated in comparison to the others clothes. And the move he does to get his staff in a mystical way, it is simply stupid and is repeated often. So if you can get past those two things I think it is worth a watch, particularly if you aren't buying it, as I would not see the value in owning it; but it maybe worth one watch.",1363219200,,777,4.118421052631579

3856635,3,B0026P61FA,"Let me begin by saying that I should give this two separate reviews. I can't do that, however. I can give one review with my complete opinion.

So: if I rate this based on enjoyment of the plot, characters and art, with the original Japanese voice actors and English subtitles, I really, really like this anime and it gets 5 stars. HOWEVER, if I review the English dubs separately, this gets NO STARS. It gets sent to Hel with no hope of reprieve.

I'm not Asatru myself, though I have a lot of friends who are - I'm a Druid, so these are not my gods, although they're friends of my gods, so to speak. I might feel very different if I were Asatru (those who honor the Norse gods in modern times), but as it is, I love this. My gods are not easily offended and are well-known for their sense of humor; I don't know the Norse gods so well, but many of them strike me as much the same, so the portrayals of their characters in this anime are a lot of fun for me.

The plot is both entertaining and inventive, and the art is absolutely adorable; the art is so adorable, in fact, that the reason I came here at all was because I could not find another source to stream this anime that did not have horrifically bad quality video.

And now we come to the less pleasant half of the review:

I was thrilled to come here and find this, until the speaking began; once the speaking began, I was in the Abyss of Torment, whatever your religion may call that. I came here to give a review of 1 star because I was so enraged over the pathetic, disgusting, insipid English dubs - then I had to revise my thinking because the anime itself deserves a really high rating. It's only when it gets raped by whoever decided to dub it that it becomes a thing of hideous horror.

Guys, come on. >.< The Japanese voice actors lent so much elegance and precision to this script, and I can *ABSOLUTELY* guarantee you that my three children and I could do a better job of dubbing this in English than these voice actors did - even though we only know a little bit of Japanese.

So, to summarize: Really horrible job on the part of the English-dub team. Vomitously pathetic. Love it in Japanese with English subs, though.",1349395200,,2192,4.267469879518072
3856636,3,B0026P61FA,"This is child detective presented piece which doesn't involve any real detective work or for that matter, any real child detective like Case Closed doesn't.
There is a Norse mythology theme but that doesn't really bring anything to the table.
It is not bad and it is not great, it is predictable with a few likeable characters and the dumb as a box of rocks female lead.
There is some humor but not enough to call this a comedy. All in all you will not hate this piece but you will not rave about it either.
The voice acting will be familiar and is just fine for the most part.",1349222400,8,577,4.254545454545455
3856637,5,B0026P61FA,"This use of the Norse mythology is delightful. Loki is adorable, and I appreciate the honorable presentation of him. The story of Odin's bad-parenting as a trigger for Loki's mis-deeds is included, and Odin is NOT played up as the ""hero"" and honorable ""adopted parent"" of Loki. And the inclusion of two of Loki's offspring, Jormangander and Fenrir adds to the fun of the whole series! Loved it all. Its well worth watching again and again.",1344556800,,439,4.7894736842105265

3856639,2,B0026P61FA,"While this anime has good voice acting, good animtaion as well as some funny parts; its really not that special when compared to many other animes that don't take themselves too seriously like this one does. Anyway, this anime's issues are what keeps it from being a good one and makes it become more like a mediocre one. It's issues are:

- Its plot is paper thin and the characters aren't developed enough.

- This anime relies heavily on filler and not enough on plot and character development, filler dominates this entire anime and makes it boring.

- It's script is weak and too light-hearted.

- It's action scenes don't have enough substance to them and are too simplistic. They need to be a bit longer and a lot more exciting.

- This anime is too light hearted in its plot, its execution and its main antagonist: Odin, has a very weak reason for wanting to kill Loki. This god basically wants Loki to die because this god found out that through a prediction that Loki will bring darkness upon the world around us. This is a weak reason for Odin to want Loki dead, when there is a so much better way for Odin to deal with Loki about this.

-Nothing really happens in terms of plot development in this anime.

- Hel a.k.a. Loki's daughter, is a pointless character and doesn't really add anything to this anime; she is part of the filler in this anime.

[...]

Overall these issues plague this show and make it more along the lines of mediocre rather than the opposite of this. 5/10",1301011200,2,1490,4.468634686346864
3856640,5,B0026P61FA,"I grew up with an interest in Norse mythology, so when I saw an anime with both 'Loki' and 'Ragnarok' in the title, I was immediately interested. Reading the description I knew that not to expect too much of a connection to the old stories, but I thought it would fun none the less. I am glad I picked it up :)

Loki, the god of mischief, was cast from the world of the gods down to the human world. In order to return he must collect the spirits of evil that posses human hearts. The thing is, for reasons unknown, during his stay in the human world he is bound to the form of a child. In order to hunt down his quarry, he starts a detective agency and somehow manages to get stuck with a teenage girl named Mayura as an assistant. Things aren't going to bad for Loki, until the other Norse gods and goddesses start showing up trying to kill him!

The Nose mythology was my favorite part of this series, but I also enjoyed the plot and characters. Loki is an entertaining character and Mayura an endearing one. The supporting cast is large and diverse, and it is always fun when a new god is introduced. I think this series would be most entertaining for people who know a little bit about the myths and legends this series draws from. I showed it to one friend who knew pretty much nothing about Norse mythology, and she found it cute and entertaining, but wasn't all that thrilled with it. But my sisters, who are all familiar with the Norse gods, all really enjoyed it.

If you enjoy the series and decide to hunt down the manga, be aware of two things - first, the manga this is based on is actually called Mythical Detective Loki and Mythical Detective Loki Ragnarok is the sequel (which the anime has no relation too). Second, only the first two volumes of the second series are available in the US. For some reason, Singapore released an English translation of both manga series, and it is possible to find them on eBay. I liked the manga better than the anime, but after paying international shipping + the cost of the books, it is cheaper to get the anime!",1287446400,7,2066,4.347150259067358

3856642,4,B0026P61FA,"If you are thinking that this follows exactly the story of Loki as in the Norse myths, you would be wrong.  The basic premise is there, but the characters are slightly different and the ending is completely different.  For example, in the myths, Loki is the father of at least three children by a giantess, all monsters - here 2 of his children appear as ""monsters"" if you could call them that (post trasformation), and one as a very angry girl (not a monster, and no transformation into one).
  Reading the Norse myths extras on the DVD is helpful if you know nothing about them and want to compare them to the anime.  If not, check out [...]
  There are Wordsworth poems in one of the episodes on the last disk.  If you are looking for them in full, the first lines are ""My heart leaps up when I behold a rainbow in the sky"" and, less obviously, ""Five years have past; five summers, with the length of five long winters..."" (this latter for the ""While with an eye made quiet by the power of harmony...."").
  Spoiler alert - There's a happy ending.  Ragnarok doesn't happen because Loki decides to stay on Earth.  Except for his 2 surviving children, all the other gods go back.  It'll be easier for you if you suspend your thinking about what will happen in future when Mayura grows up but Loki doesn't.",1230422400,,1305,4.432773109243698
