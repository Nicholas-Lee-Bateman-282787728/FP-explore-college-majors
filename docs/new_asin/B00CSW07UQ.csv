5737991,5,B00CSW07UQ,"As enjoyable as it is to listen to Tom and Ross recount their adventures and long running relationship, the real star of this show is the incredible HD footage from inside massive waves. Few of us are born with the huevos to drop in on a 50' plus bomb. By managing to have the skill and presence of mind to handle a camera stuck on the end of a pole while negotiating huge drops where the face bumps are bigger than the waves most of us see at our home breaks, this film gives us a unique perspective from deep within the throat of the beast.",1392940800,3,542,4.122641509433962

8585947,2,B00CSW07UQ,"The footage of the waves is good, but we tried twice to watch it all the way through and failed both times.  They should have cut down the interviews and focus on the waves instead.  Sorry, but hearing about the so-called struggles that people who are paid to surf go through is a bit much to take and not very interesting.  The voice-over is also irritating.",1404864000,3,359,4.409090909090909
