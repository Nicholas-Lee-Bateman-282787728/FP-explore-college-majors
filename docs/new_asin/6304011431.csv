Jeff Goldblum is, once again, Jeff Goldblum and you  can't ask for much better than that.

I've never been a huge fan of Mary Steenburgen but she was good in this. As for Lance Hendrickson and Ray Wise they always come through.

I'm not going to comment on Victor Salwa everyone else has done that.
I'll just say he owes God a debt and let it go at that.

However, the story has good qualities for preteens and teens and takes on bullying in a caring adequate way.  The concept of the hero's existence (his ""gifts"") is still interesting and intriguing.  Considering that I bought it for a teen, who enjoyed it, it was worth the price.",1473984000,,521,4.5

757755,1,6304011431,"Very difficult to get past the fact that the director Victor Salva was arrested and convicted of child molestation and child pornography just three years before releasing this film. Disney claims they never knew of the directors arrest and jail time as the film came from another production company and cried ignorant when this news was reveled. True he served his time but the crime isn't erasable.  There are scenes in the film that once you know the directors history make you cringe like in the scene where Goldblum affectionately caresses the boy's face.

The main character Powder unveils for us the infinite possibilities of what it means to be truly human... compassionate.  Powder is far ahead of his time with healing abilities which seemingly spring from his innocent spirit; he sees past the everyday veneer of personalities to the deeper wounds within each of those he encounters.  This is a deeply spiritual film and a suspenseful script at the same time.

758189,2,6304011431,"POWDER is a movie that made me extremely uncomfortable watching it. Not because of the subject matter or even the characters. It came from the knowledge of writer/director Victor Salva's background. He was a convicted child molester who served time in prison. Apparently he had a thing with young boys. One of them tried to get the movie pulled from theaters back in winter, of 1995. The boy worked on one of his previous films, which I believe was called CLOWN STOPPERS, or something like that.

POWDER has scenes that clearly indicate two things about Victor Salva: he has a thing for half naked young men, and he was an abused child. The latter comes from the way the title character, whose real name is Jeremy Reed (Sean Patrick Flanery) gets treated by almost everybody. Jeremy is a teenager with an IQ that a school official describes as ""right off the charts"". He has powerful telepathy skill, and is unable to be around electricity. As a science teacher (Jeff Goldblum) says to a doctor, ""He IS electrolysis.""

The science teacher is one of a very few people who are kind to Jeremy. The others are the Texas sheriff (Lance Hendrickson), and a social worker who runs a boys' orphanage (Mary Steenburgen), and Lindsey, a girl who actually develops an attraction to Jeremy. Everybody else is mean and cruel to Jeremy, including the sheriff's chief deputy, Lindsey's father, and one of the other teens at the orphanage (Bradford Tatum). These people are mean to him even when he clearly demonstrates his abilities. And in one scene they strip him naked, where the mean teenager observes, ""he is like a newborn baby.""

But what was even more uncomfortable were several scenes of young shirtless men. It's not because they were seen shirtless. It's because of the way the camera shows them. One shot had the camera following a shirtless teen from his neck down to his belly. And in another scene that I felt was way out of line, the science teacher improperly touches Jeremy, after he explains that his grandparents were afraid to touch him.

A filmmaker's personal baggage isn't something I usually think about if the movie is really good. But POWDER made me unable to distance myself from Victor Salva's. What he did to his victim was evil and unforgiving. Even if POWDER were a really good film, which it isn't, I could not watch it without knowing that horrible knowledge in the background.

Victor Salva demonstrated his continued attraction to half naked boys even more in JEEPERS CREEPERS 2. Watching that movie was like looking at soft-core gay porn. I wondered if his victim ever saw POWDER. If he did, I imagine that it created more than a sense of being uncomfortable. He was clearly outraged when he attempted to get it pulled from the theaters. Disney, who distributed the film pointed out that there was never any incidents of improper handling by Victor Salva on the set. From what I know, nobody even knew about Salva's background. But I wonder if they felt as uncomfortable as I did when the movie came out.",1442016000,,3026,4.745247148288973

758644,5,6304011431,"The movie 'Powder' was highly recommended to me. I can understand why. It was moving, every segment with a powerful message of the negativity of FEAR and how destructive when it perpetuates and that strength, power and mental understanding are capable of existing without control which is clearly depicted in this movie. Jeremy takes us beyond the physical as an energetic being into the realm of feeling. This is a must movie. I was deeply moved by it.

The storyline really is current day in how mankind stereo types certain people groups only because of a visual difference. It serves to show the viewer just how evil we really are, and to what lengths we'll go to and how because we don't want to understand other, that the reason we don't understand them is simple, at the pinnacle of the story how ""we have a blind spot right there between our eyes that prevents us from seeing the true value of others and really everything.""

I can only imagine what could be done in today's Fx that would have served to add more hype to its Hollywood appeal.",1417651200,,807,4.38

Another in a long list of films about an outcast who is slowly accepted due to some special stand out skill.  And of course you have a host of sympathetic characters who rush to support him, so unrealistic.  The glaring flaw is that the characters are all so unlikeable.  Goldblum, again plays the ""know it all"" researcher who nobody believes but is always right.  Steenburgen plays the stereotypical sympathetic instructor.  All the teens are bullies.  The Powder character actually turns out to be kind a jerk with an attitude.  The ending is weird and makes no sense.  They show Powder staring at a shirtless teen boy who is rubbing water on his bare chest.  He catches Powder staring at him and gets angry.  Powder runs off and explodes.  WTF!?!?!  After reading about the director Salva, I kind of understand that weird homoerotic scene.  Otherwise it makes no sense.  Probably better to skip this film if you haven't seen it.

I cannot understand why it is usually rated so low.  Perhaps because its implications are too frightening for some?  It displays brilliantly how man's inhumanity to man can make life unbearable, especially to the most sensitive among us.  ""Powder,"" the boy who uses 100% of his brain, played wonderfully and poignantly by Sean Patrick Flanery, was a portrait of the beauty that is possible when we see that we are all connected, and a portrait, too, of the meanness that fear can create.

I understand that some people have actually laughed at the ending.  How horribly sad I find that.  Such people must be painfully ignorant to have missed the point of the film entirely.  Yet, we are all connected, so thank you to those of you who remind me and us that there are and will ever be ass souls for God.

759553,5,6304011431,"""Powder"" was the first of two films that came out in 1995-1996 dealing with a gifted individual who is super-smart and has paranormal powers; the second was ""Phenomenon"" with John Travolta. ""Powder"" is the superior. While ""Phenomenon"" is good, ""Powder"" reaches for greatness and, in some ways, achieves it.

Sean Patrick Flanery plays a hairless albino teen in East Texas, nicknamed Powder, who's discovered living in a basement after his grandfather's sudden death. As a ward of the state, he is placed in a boy's school where his uniqueness stirs up trouble.

For a film like this to work you have to buy into the character, and this is one of the movie's strengths. Flanery reveals his acting expertise in his utterly convincing portrayal of the gifted teen. Seriously, Flannery's Powder stands strong with the greatest misfits in cinema, like Nimoy's Spock and Hank's Forrest Gump.

Actually, the acting is great across the board: Lance Henriksen as the hardened-but-open sheriff, Mary Steenburgen as a psychologist who grows to really love Powder (in a motherly way),Jeff Goldblum as a science teacher who's astonished, Bradford Tatum as Powder's main enemy at school, Brandon Smith as a redneck deputy who instinctively hates him, but actually fears him, and the beautiful redhead Missy Crider, Powder's fellow student and potential love interest.

Roger Ebert dissed the film for a number of reasons, one being Powder's enemy's don't learn from him. On the contrary, one enemy makes a 180 after being enlightened, but ultimately reverts back to his former base mentality. This happens all the time in real life. On another occasion Powder does something miraculous and you can clearly see the change on his enemy's face -- the realization & acceptance. Whether this will prove to be a lasting change or temporary, we'll never know.

Ebert also complained that Powder's electrical tricks upstage his emotional insights. Really? I think it's the reverse. While the electrical tricks are there to maintain the attention of those with cinematic ADHD, it's the film's potent insights that stay with the viewer. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy the electrical tricks, but they're way too overdone to be realistic. At the same time, I understand why the writer/director (Victor Salva) included them -- this is a MOVIE, not real life; it's meant to transfer ideas AND entertain, and it does both pretty effectively.

Ebert also griped that the ending is unsatisfying the more you think about it. Actually, the ending makes a powerful statement and is reminiscent of the spectacular translations of Elijah and Enoch in the Bible. Let's just say Powder was too good, too spiritual, for the simpleminded and mundane.

I'm not saying the film doesn't have flaws or roll-your-eyes moments, but they can be overlooked in view of the big picture and the film's successes.

As for the paranormal phenomena featured in the story -- like psychokinesis, telepathy, extraordinary empathy and what the Bible calls ""the word of knowledge"" -- although some of these are exaggerated in the film I have a secret:

They're real.

759599,4,6304011431,"The unusually controversial 90s cult classic Powder is one of those films that works best when the audience watches it knowing little about it. Powder is a beautiful and touching picture with serious artistic value and imagery, but it also gives you plenty to think about as its credits roll. I'll get into all of that later on in this review, and I promised myself that I wouldn't get too into the messiness of the behind-the-scenes antics that have gone on. It is a magnificent film in a lot of ways, and I truly love it. However, I highly recommend that nobody read the IMDB message boards for the film and it's director. If I had the ability, I would tell the world that director Victor Salva is a completely different person than who he used to be, and for people to just move on. His behind-the-scenes drunken behavior on the set of his theatrical debut Clownhouse was unacceptable, and I'm not denying that. It was completely disgusting what he did and I doubt I'll ever have the respect for him as a person as I do as an artist, but I'm not going to go into detail about it here and publicize it any more than it already has been. It's not the kind of thing I like to talk about when I talk about films that I love. That's the only problem this film technically has, however, despite the fact that nothing like that took place behind the scenes of this film. The film has been forever tainted because of the man who made it. People hate the director. People cannot seem to separate the fiction of this film from the reality of the director, and so they'll find questionable material here to gawk over and re-examine despite the fact that none of those ideas existed in the film in the first place.

Two novels that I love are The Education of Little Tree by Asa Earl ""Forrest"" Carter and Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card. Those books were written by people who I cannot, in good conscience, call anything other than scumbags. However, they were both able to write beautiful novels all the same. At least director Victor Salva was convicted of his crimes and did the time that was required of him. Sure, there will be people out there who say that nothing can ever change the fact that he did what he did, and I totally agree. Nothing can, so lets move on because all you're doing is making the people who suffered out to be nothing more than victims. People are too quick to see them as nothing more than victims. I don't think that a lot of folks realize just how tough it can be to be called a victim for your entire life, and if people would just smarten up and realize that these sorts of bad things happen all the time, they would realize that the true measure of a man is how fast they can pick themselves back up. People who label Victor Salva as nothing more than a monster are simply slowing down the process, and I feel the same way about those who label people like Roman Polanski and Woody Allen as similar things. Folks, just please move on. There's nothing more that you can call him that he hasn't been called, and guess what. He's still making films. Not only that, but he's making good films. In my opinion, his best film is Powder.

Anyway, Powder tells the story of an electromagnetic albino boy named Jeremy Reed who is nicknamed ""Powder"" (Sean Patrick Flanery) due to his pale complexion. Powder spent his childhood in the basement of his grandparents reading and re-reading every single book he could manage to get his hands on. By the time he was discovered by the public, he had learned so much but had yet to try and survive in the outside world. Things don't go so well for him as he ends up becoming an outcast to society at large. He is misunderstood almost constantly by his peers. His one brave attempt to make them laugh or even smile falls flat. He is bullied at his reform school almost relentlessly and is shunned by the people around him accept for the sheriff (Lance Henriksen), a psychologist (Mary Steenburgen), and his physics professor (Jeff Goldblum). Eventually it is established that Powder has unique, almost messiah-like abilities and a level of intelligence far beyond any human being in existence. It may be possible that Powder is simply a lost soul whose innocence and purity has been corrupted by this angry and complicated world full of people who are simply afraid of themselves and afraid to take any chances. People like to adapt to habits and hobbies in order to try and define themselves and shield themselves from the public out of fear for the people around them to find out who they really are. This film is simply about a man who is unable to hide who he is from the public and cannot adapt to rituals and hobbies like everyone else can, and therefore he becomes victimized by a harsh and unforgiving world that refuses to even make an attempt to try and understand him. Powder is a man who is born an irreversible non-conformist.

Powder is basically a fable, not unlike films such as Edward Scissorhands or Danny Deckchair. To me, however, it is a film that was ahead of its time and will not be able to be fully appreciated by anyone other than those who take the entire film on its own merits. Even for those people, however, there will be some challenges. The film is a lot like Powder, the character. I'm going to be honest. This film's magic did not work on me the first time I viewed it. I thought it was an enjoyable film, but I was also young and it didn't fully resonate with me. Sure, many of the images certainly stuck with me and I found the film to be quite emotional, but I couldn't really see past what made the whole thing so damn exceptional other than the fact that there was a lot of passion and emotion involved in the picture itself. The scene with the deer made me cry when I was little, but I didn't really understand why. This is the kind of film that obeys a lot of pretty typical genre conventions, but then has moments of terrifying realism, not unlike the film Monster's Ball, that made the whole picture very bizarre, surprising, and disturbing. It's sort of like Werner Herzog's Invincible, only without the unbelievable heartache and tragedy. Powder is a much more misunderstood and unhappy character, but never once does he just let his own situations get the better of him. He feels weak and damaged, but that's only because he is. Powder is meant to be portrayed lightly as a kind of messiah, but this isn't so that small-minded viewers can pretend that Victor Salva was trying to paint a portrait of Jesus Christ and all of his glory. Salva directed the film this way because he wanted to craft a metaphor for Powder being a misunderstood man like Jesus Christ was, because lets face it. Who was more misunderstood than Jesus Christ? Abraham Lincoln? Michael Jackson? I think not. To me, if you're going to make a film about a selfless human being, you need to go all the way in showing how helpless man can become as it progresses through its many turmoils. Powder is too pure for this world, and may always will be. This is why this film worked so damn well to me, because it was lightly traumatic and emotional and it didn't pour it all on screen for people to gawk at and hail it as a masterpiece when it's really a freak show. The film approaches the material with a fearlessness, but also with a sense of tactfulness. This is a film made up of small moments in order to convey a story with a lot of heart, passion, and humanity. I was very moved by it.

Powder is a powerful and quiet film for me, but it doesn't try to overstay it's welcome either. There are a lot of ideas in this film that are put forth, and many people may be frustrated by the fact that the film doesn't take the time to explore a lot of it. People have a similar problem with the Ken Russell film Altered States. I think that, in general, if you can at least establish the essence of what is going on and make the viewer at least feel that they are getting the chance to explore such heavy material that it doesn't matter to me if it works completely. For me, I appreciated the fact that this film brought so many ideas to the table without trying to dwell on them. This film wasn't meant to be like Sphere, which I personally found to be scary but which many people found to be preachy. Powder certainly isn't preachy, but it can be misconstrued for being that way due to the fact that it has it's occasional moments where it will dwell on certain characters and events. Many folks like to bring up a scene in which Powder passionately watches a young teen wring his wet shirt over his body and claim it to be homoerotic when in reality it is supposed to symbolize the fact that Powder doesn't have any bodily hair on him and wishes that he could have experienced what it would have been like to grow up and develop hair in various places on the body, which was a time in the lives of many adolescent boys that was unpleasant and unnerving. Ironically, the character of Powder is also judged after being witnessed gawking at the boy. I think that's one of the most challenging aspects of the film for a lot of people. There's an ominous temptation to read into aspects of the film that don't actually exist. There always will be with a Victor Salva film, and because of this I don't think that many people will unfortunately be able to ever comprehend how truly deep and powerful this film really is. However, the ending to Powder has an element of optimism to it. Powder is too pure and too innocent for this world to accept him, but the characters that surround him hold out hope that there is a place for someone like him to go where he will never be judged or harassed for who he is.

in it and that's why I had so wanted my own copy.  I have never had any trouble with the words
showing up on any movie I have bought before this so it was quite a surprise on this DVD--it just
kept flipping the words off right after it showed up so you couldn't even read them.  Once in a while
the words would stay so you  could read them, but most of the time the words would try to come on
and then flip off extremely quickly.

759773,5,6304011431,"""Powder"" is a deeply moving film about the very difficult topic of what we humans do when someone different is in our midst and we have to deal with him or her. Some people have difficulty with 'difference', and this can be the cause of much pain and suffering.

The movie is basically dealing with this topic, while also offering some quasi-spiritual/psychological insights into the nature of the Universe and who we really are, specifically something like: ""All matter is energy. We are matter. Therefore, we are energy."" Whether or not you agree with this logic, it makes the premise of the 'difference' in the movie.

Other reviewers discuss the plot and script, and their strong and weak points, but what I found outstanding in the movie was the character -- Sheriff Doug Barnum -- played brilliantly by Lance Henriksen.

I think he has not received proper credit for the compelling job he has done in this film.

Henriksen is mostly known for his roles in horror films (i.e. some of the Alien movie franchise, Pumpkinhead, Near Dark, etc.) and he can certainly play a ""baddie"" with conviction. He's always fun to watch and brings a lot of energy and menace to his roles. But his acting ability far exceeds these roles, and he has a much greater depth than the villains he plays - entertaining as they are.

In ""Powder"", we get to see more of that wonderful depth as Henriksen delivers a stellar performance that stands out. This is a real accomplishment when you consider he is working with other powerful actors, including Jeff Goldblum, Mary Steenbergen, and Sean Patrick Flannery -- who also demand our attention. They are, of course, excellent. But Henriksen somehow brings something extra to his role, a spirit, an energy that compliments, yet rises above, these marvelous actors and their characters.

The character that Henriksen plays, Sheriff Doug Barnum, is at heart a good and decent man, trying to honor his role as law officer and balance it with the tragedy in his personal life. As an officer, he must do what the law says, whether he agrees with it or not, but as a human being, he can do so with compassion and dignity. That is what Henriksen brings to the role and it is wonderful to watch.

He is tough, no nonsense, strong, yet at times so compassionate and tender. Watch the scene between the Sheriff and his son as they reconcile their differences very carefully. Henriksen makes his character poignantly human, not just a part in a film. It is completely believable and heart wrenching. You really feel for the guy and what he is going through. This happens throughout the film.

Of course, much of this is in the script, and is supported by the excellent musical score. The trick is to WATCH Henriksen closely, his facial expressions and his body language, the way he cocks his head, rolls his very expressive eyes. This is where his skills as an actor shine through. He delivers a beautiful performance filled with pathos and emotion, which is the strong point of the film.

If you are a Lance Henriksen fan but are used to his horror roles, I think you will find this performance different and refreshing, and a tribute to his skill as an actor.

And the movie is very good too.

Enjoy!",1364947200,,3218,4.698046181172291

760003,4,6304011431,"Fine, underrated film loosely based on/ripped off from Olaf Stapeldon's SF classic early novel ODD JOHN (available via Amazon, among other sources).  ODD JOHN is about an incredibly intelligent, not-like-us albino child and what happens to him and those around him as he matures.  POWDER is about an incredibly intelligent, not-like-us albino child and what happens to and those around him as he matures.

That caveat/complaint aside, POWDER is a fine example of how to make a a science-fiction film that deals with ideas instead of smash-ups on a reasonable budget.  Excellent casting from the stars to the minor roles.  An intelligent human being, Jeff Goldblum gets to play an intelligent role, though I do get a bit tired of his singular stare-of-wonder from time to time (Director: ""Jeff, it's okay to close your mouth once in a while"").  Usual pro score by Jerry Goldsmith, right up there with his little-known work for BALTO.  Film gets 4 stars instead of 5 because of occasional plot contrivances that substitute story convenience for logic.  For example, both Goldblum and Mary Steenburgen's character quickly recognize Powder's exceptionalism, yet neither thinks to apply to take him home with them or otherwise find a proper venue for his maturation.  They can only repeatedly stick him in a home for boys that borders on the Dickensian, thereby jeopardizing his life and wasting his abilities.  In real (as opposed to cinematic) life, as soon as these abilities manifested themselves, Powder would find himself taken in and treated properly by the first university to be made aware of his uniqueness.  Instead, for dramatic purposes the plot is compelled to keep him stuck in a small Texas town.  There are additional breaks in logic that leave the viewer shaking their head...but are necessary for director Salva to hammer his point across to the viewing audience (and judging by some of the thick-headed negative reviews here he could have hammered twice as hard and certain viewers still wouldn't have got it).

The acting and direction are a bit heavy-handed, but that's the conundrum faced by anyone wishing to make a science-fiction film about ideas.  Witness the first (negative) reviews of Kubrick's 2001.  The uncredited ""borrowing"" from Stapeldon aside, POWDER is well worth seeing.  Just as ODD JOHN, and all of Stapeldon's pioneering works, are well worth reading.",1349136000,,2388,5.131782945736434

I think every middle school should show this movie to their students. It portrays bullying in its coldest form. Powder is a very kind and loving, advanced human being. And for the people around him to act as they did must have been what Christ faced.

760161,5,6304011431,"While there are several movies I consider to be my favorites, this movie, POWDER, has risen to (and stayed at!) the top of my list for years now.
In fact, the more I watch this movie, the more deeply it affects me.
""Powder"" is the main character's nickname, due to his albinism.
But ""Powder"" is sooooo much more than his condition.....
He is extremely intelligent, and extraordinarily sensitive.
Of course, as with almost all those who are ""different""---he is not understood, and therefore--subject to cruelty by others.
As the movie unfolds, one will see---and hopefully come to LOVE and RESPECT---all of ""Powder's"" incredible gifts.
I, for one, wish that ""Powder"" were a real person.....we would become INSTANT friends, because of who he is.....and especially, we would share our deep and powerful love for ANIMALS!!!
As I've said, this movie has touched me so deeply.....even just hearing the movie's musical score, reduces me to tears every time.
""Powder"", like my sister, Eva---believed that God is in EVERYONE, and in EVERY LIVING THING......
Perhaps if we all TRULY understood this, we would treat eachother sooooo much better than we do!

760163,3,6304011431,"Directed by Victor Salva (Jeepers Creepers series), Powder (1995) is an odd tale about a young man with paranormal abilities, who has problems adjusting to society.  The story bumps along slowly unfolding like a mystery, developing on several fronts.  The film seems to have aspirations of saying something quite profound, but it perhaps falls short of meeting them.

Jimmy Reed (Sean Patrick Flannery) was raised by his grandparents, who because of his unique physical characteristics educated him at home, and never let him leave their house.  The teenager, nicknamed `Powder', is left alone in the world, when his grandfather passes away, and is found in the basement of his home by Sheriff Doug Barnum (Lance Hendriksen), and Jessie Caldwell (Mary Steenburgen) a psychologist.  The young man is an albino, extremely intelligent, but not used to dealing with people.  His body has a strange electrical charge that draws electricity to him.

The story follows Reed's adventures as a ward of the state in a boy's home, and in high school.  Wherever is he is, he doesn't exactly fit in, and strange things keep happening.  An experiment in Donald Ripley's (Jeff Goldblum) physics class, demonstrates how electricity has an affinity for Jimmy, as an arc shoots through his body.  Powder displays many strange abilities, acting as a telepath between Barnum and his dying wife, and displaying an ability to tap into people's thoughts.  Powder is found to be a super-genius, and though Caldwell and Ripley try to help him, no one really understands him or can comprehend that he just wants to go home.  With no place left to go, Powder finds freedom in his own unique way.

This is more a drama with some supernatural elements, rather than a science fiction horror film.  Sean Patrick Flannery performance is very strong, and Lance Hendriksen shows his sensitive side.  This may make an interesting watch for some, as the viewer is mostly left to fill in many of the blanks.",1312675200,,1970,4.981651376146789

I love everything about this film, from the direction, acting, photography and score... which provides the perfect mood for every scene. The acting especially is incredible... with Sean P Flannery delivering hands down, his best work to date...  a dream role for any actor really.... but its good that he didn't overplay it.... gave it just the right amount of intensity and especially, subtlety to make it authentic and not pretentious. Jeff Goldblum is pretty much perfect in anything he does to me..  and even more when he's playing middle aged intellectuals... pretty much his forte.. lol  Lance Herickssen is amazing in it as well... and there is a scene involving Powder, him and his wife that will remind you what an underated and underused actor the guy is...  guy is another one of those... wipes the floor w most of the hollywood elite kinda actors that truly doesnt get the work that he deserves... what a shame. The message in this film is incredible and really makes you understand how flawed and ignorant society is... especially around things which we don't understand. Some people treat others very bad and the majority of the time, its based on fear or just plain ignorance, which is the case in this film....  but there is always room for growth and this movie reminds u of that....  often more than not, we get caught up in our own little existence and don't really give others the respect and attention that they deserve, not knowing that those others could lead to become very important people in our lives if we give them more entry into our existence... there's a lot to learn from the most unexpected sources.

The movie was released in 1994 a year after Jurassic Park Jeff Goldblum in my mind did his best work in this movie. The movie is based around a young boy who has a skin problem where he has no pigmintation and who is smarter then albert Einstein supposedly. The police come to the house to find that his grandparents are dead. and they believe they just died of natural causes. Downstairs lives there grandchild who everyone thinks is a freak just because of the color of his skin. Which goes into deeper depth of racial conflicts. They take him from his house to put him into schooling because they see of his inteligence. Threw the whole movie the only thing Powder wants to do is go back to his farm house.

  During Powders first day of school he is in lunch and the Aka: Bullies come to pick on him and Powder shows his first true showings of power by putting all the metal in the room together and making a spoon dance across the table leaving the whole room in shock and silence. You soon come to find out that the Police Sergent has a wife who is sick and slowly fading and how him and his son have fallin out of touch.

  Powder and his class go on a hiking trip soon to find out that one of the police officers and a bunch of his classmates went up to the trails to hunt,  when powder hears gunfire and see's a deer slowly dieing he grabs the arm of the officer and the neck of the dear showing the officer what death really is like changing the officer for good, where he does not wanna go hunting anymore.

  The Movie has so much going on and is so deep it truly is a amazing movie. the two must touching scenes in the movie is when powder communicates what the sergents wife wants to tell him and he breaks down when she dies, His son shows up only to know that she has died and there is a deep emotional scene when the son and father embrass for the first time.  The other deep Scene is at the end of the Movie when Powder finally gets back to his orignal home and he takes off into the field and Jeff Goldblum and everybody else is following him and he is getting hit by lightening and he disappears and everyone feels him around them... The scenes are even made deeper by the music composed by Jerry Goldsmith Who probably did some of his best music on this and is not known for this movie.

It also shows the vulnerability of each person for different reasons throughout.  The character of Powder is so full, yet powerfully quiet.  He harnassed energy and humanity in abundance.

I was disturbed by reviews that this movie points towards homosexuality...I don't believe that was the intent at all.  In the poignant scene where Powder is staring at another boy in the locker room, it's quite obvious it's NOT in a sexual way but in comparison.  He was seeing what it truly was that HE was not.  He could not have any body hair, yet this other boy had long hair and body hair that HE did not.  This other boy was tanned and ""healthy"" looking, one more thing he could not have...pigment.

Victor Salva's ""Powder"" is the kind of movie that when you first read the screenplay, you think... God, this is so full of potential.

Think of the endless possibilities. It just needs a rewrite, maybe even a script doctor and we can make this the talked-about film of the year.

But the movie gets rushed into filming and it's left with an unfinished feeling.

It feels like the studio or the director wanted to make a movie about persecuted outsiders and then thought, ""Well, we want this movie to drive people here in hoards. We need a mainstream film... so lets not make it too smart for people to follow and too deep for people to want to get into. We don't wanna go over people's heads.""

It takes a truly original character and plugs him into a movie as routine and unremarkable as the bullying, red-neck catalysts who flaunt 85% of the film's supporting roles. Who just gawk and insult 'cause they're so damn screwed-up themselves, on a personal level.

Who's fault is this? The director... or the executives?

""Powder"" has some moments that are almost Spielberg-Ian and insights that cause you to think. But there are too many others that almost feel phoned in.

Sean Patrick Flanery plays Jeremy Reed, nicknamed ""Powder"" is an amazing superhuman who is almost pure energy and conducts electricity better than water or metal. He has the ability to read minds, magnetize and he can also shatter glass telepathically. He is also a genius.

The movie begins with an establishing scene where an expectant mother is driven screaming in an ambulance to the nearest hospital. And not only has her water broke, she has just been struck by lightning.

The father demands to see him. The baby is screaming inside the oxygen tent as if it's a burn victim. It almost seems to know what's going on right now. The cries are deafening and heartbreaking.

And the father abandons him. The boy lives with his grandparents until they die and poor Powder is once again without family.

People who find Powder downstairs in the basement, hiding. From them. From outsiders. From the world.

They bundle him up, take him away to a reform school. Why?

Um...shouldn't he be sent to an orphanage or something? Why throw him in with criminals who can't be tried as adults?

Oh, the formula. Sorry, I forgot.

Jeremy is bullied all throughout the movie and takes way too long to retaliate. As if the director is getting too damn into this or has time to kill. Even when it's clear there's no other choice. ""Not much fight in you, huh?"" asks one of them at one point. Obviously not.

I can't tell if we takes so long to just use his abilities because he's afraid, he's too good... or the film's gotta too much time to kill and the director's enjoying lashing back.

We see Jeremy's pale as death skin and his defined male form. Salva incorporates this scene because of his preference for the male physique. He shows male nudity in a lot of his movies and homosexual elements. There is a moment that suggests that Jeremy might be gay or some of the other kids in the film might have those elements as well.

These scenes are well-drawn, no doubt related to Salva's experiences dealing with his own sexuality. Salva himself is gay, yes.

Which explains a lot of the endless elaborate homo put-downs throughout the movie and male nudity as well. Even the southern redneck kids don't mind too much getting a gander at Powder's privates.

Of course we need (yes, NEED) scenes where Jeremy is persecuted for the way he is. But there are too many of those. They take up way too much of the movie. A scene in a cafeteria, in the woods and in the gymnasium that moves outside onto the field.

There are many, many scenes where Jeremy shows his endless powers. Yet too many people are slow to catch on, even the smart ones.

There's a truly great scene where a redneck hick deputy sheriff (Brandon Smith) shoots a deer and Powder uses an empathy power so the deputy can feel the deer's pain and suffering.

And another where Jeremy is getting involved with the only sweet girl in town and they have a moment where they share kind of Vulcan mind-meld.

He has every superpower known to man. He's smart, sweet, kind and all-powerful.

But for some reason, he lacks the ability to do the simplest thing and the most obvious thing when the opportunity is right there. So does pretty much everyone else in this film most of the time.

I asked myself, why?

Oh, the formula. Sorry, I forgot.

Jeff Goldblum believes in Jeremy and thinks he could be an advanced step in human evolution. He delivers eloquence about where he explains what Powder is and again later with everything wrong with humanity and how we haven't moved very far in the great human race. And Jeremy could be humanity's answer.

The ending is inevitable, but sad. I guess there was just no other way for Powder or the movie. But you walk away wishing Powder AND the movie itself just did more than have big moments involving special effects, dealing with antagonists and only occasionally having a real moment.

Still, it's a nice renter. Goldblum's lines about humanity will make you think and Patrick Flanery's performance as the title character are all worthwhile.

And there are several scenes that really do stay stuck with you....

760491,5,6304011431,"Apparently Mr. Victor Salva had a message to deliver but unfortunately he couldn't live up to his lofty idealized realm of human attainment-that he got caught molesting a child.  Well, he is only a man with undesirable urges that got out of control.  At least he had improved or learned to control himself admirably.  He had to direct Sean Patrick Flanery being molested in nude by the tough boys in the movie.  Flanery is a very goodlooking or, may I say, a young man of great beauty.  May be the director is not gay, in the editor's review he didn't say whether the child Salva molested was a boy or girl.  Or may be Mr. Salva doesn't like grownup boy.

However, we really shouldn't take issue with Mr. Salva's sexual  inadequacy and concentrate instead on the message that he tried to convey to the viewing public--HUMANITY OVER TECHNOLOGY.  This is an age-old issue of human morality deficiency that man has not been able to correct or improve.  Not only that human cruelty has not been subsided it seems to increase in abominable degree. Just look at the world around you, have you seen any improvement at all.  I don't mean materially of course.

Now let come back to the movie, I give it a five-star rating because it's not only quite meaningful, it also very entertaining.  All the actors are good and adequate for their roles, especially, the bad boy who takes great pleasure in harassing Powder.  I don't think Powder is looking at the young man who takes off his shirt and splashes water over himself in front of the mirror in the bathroom with homosexual overtone.  He is only curious and fascinated by a normal barechested male body, all right with admiration if you have to make it that way.  Mr. Salva is undeniably a very intelligent man to be able to write and direct a movie like this.  He is very good in depicting the narrow-mindedness of men.  To involve the divine power and intention to test the human potentiality of human advancement to a higher plane spiritually is more viable or interesting than scientifically.  I don't care if there are flaws in it, to me it's a watchable film, good and entertaining.",1190851200,,2131,4.61968085106383

My wife won't even entertain the thought of watching this movie lest she become tainted by some underlining pedophile message transcoded in the subtext of the movie.  Hmmmm.  I remember way back when this movie came out and I saw the preview at the theater.  I kinda wanted to see it.  But then the whole child-molester thing came to surface and years went by.  Well, I finally bout it of Amazon for like five bucks and I gave it a try.  Know whart?  It was pretty damn good.  Sure the whole freaky-looking outcast with super powers thing has been done, but this was a decent flick.  Jeff Goldblum and Steenburgen co-star.

After his pregnant mother is struck by lightning, Powder is born an albino with a strange electrical current in his system that makes him a target for lightning, and ridicule from people who don't understand him.

There's an unforgettable scene after a hunter shoots a deer. This movie left its mark on my heart. A 'must watch'.

I think it can give humanity the hope that somewhere inside all of us, we all have to some extent the ""gift"" that Powder has.  Maybe one day, we'll all try and use ""our energy"" to the best of our ability just as Jesus Christ (whether you believe in him as God or not) is still trying to show us by his word; he had the faith that one day, we can all get in touch with our humanity to change the world if we would all only do it.  I disagree with one person's view that the shower scene had an homosexual feel to it.  I think it was related to Powder's longing to have his body look like the guy's body in the shower so he wouldn't have as hard of a time fitting in this world.  I think there was an admiration on Powder's part, and in this instance, I think it's easy to misinterpret is and sexualize it.

I've thought about it a couple times over the years, but figured I would probably never see it again.  Well it happened to be on a movie channel tonight and I watched it again.  It still had the same effect on me and my kids were really interested in it.  Unfortunatley, I turned it on 35 minutes after it had started and the kids still had homework to do and showers to take.  So I decided to check here to see if they sell it.  They do and I bought it immediately!  It is one movie I will LOVE to share with my kids.  It is such a powerful movie with a powerful message that is still relevent today.  I think it has a great message about how we treat people that are different.

Some of the reviews I read focused on the part in the movie where Powder is watching the guy in the bathroom but I'd guess those folks had their own issues with sexuality.

The central character of this movie is defintely an outcast. Called ""Powder"" because of his snow-white skin, this teenager was kept in his grandparent's basement his entire life. He is brought into the school system where kids ridicule, abuse, misunderstand, and even fear him. His science teacher (played by Jeff Goldblum) and the schoolmaster (played by Mary Steenburgen) discover that Powder can control electricity--and has profound wisdom and empathetic insight.

Powder is peaceful, tragic Christ-figure who is persecuted for being different and, perhaps, for being prophetic and ""otherworldly"" as well.

The ending is powerful and satisfying, especially given the gut-wrenching treatment that Powder endures.

I remember my mom saying ""were they his friend or what towards the end they all practicaly turned on him"" I agreed. And the ignorant prejudice against powder for being an albino was exaggerated. I remember saying HE'S JUST REALLY WHITE, so what, but from the very beginning, even before they knew of his powers, they said WHAT THE F*CK WAS THAT? As if he was some sort of inanimate object. It's weird. jUST Stupid demented ideas throughout the story. For instance the spoon scene. The purpose of that failed to be obvious. What is suppose to be cool? Did he do it to show off his abilities but if he was smart and knew people were already very discriminating against him, why let the whole school know that he had powers? WEIRD movie. Nothing made sense. The only scene that did make sense was the deer scene. I'm against sport hunting and i liked it when he put the deers pain and suffering death into the shooter so he could feel what the deer was feeling. That was the one message i had no problem with. THAT and the ""don't judge a book by it's cover"" but that message fails miserably because no one seems to learn that message. The characters keep getting stupider and stupider. And the terminally ill scene was also moving, but like i said they used him, and then turned on him. I haven't seen this movie in years but i remember it quite well. It's full of flaws and weird scenes, and comes off as being cheesy at times, and it gets you mad at times TOO.

760605,5,6304011431,"Victor Salva's POWDER fuses science with religion perhaps even better than Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, because it goes to the heart of what life may be all about - that every living thing is actually an indestructible bundle of living energy, a belief held by Albert Einstein.

  As Jeff Goldblum's character in the movie eloquently says to Sean Patrick Flanery's, the movie's title character a/k/a Jeremy, this was also the basis for Einstein's belief in life after death.  Goldblum's monologue goes on to suggest that the almost perfect human - possibly represented by ""Powder"" (Jeremy) himself - would evolve through eons of love, understanding, and the 100% use of his or her brain (as opposed to the apparently less than 10% most of us are using now) to the point that he or she would no longer require the human body and would literally become the purest form of that human energy - as ""Conversations with God"" author Neale Donald Walsch might call it, a living flame finally prepared to interact lovingly with other living flames (not to mention God) without fear.

  Goldblum further quotes Einstein later in the movie even more poignantly:  ""It has become appallingly clear that our technology has surpassed our humanity.""  However, with its heartfelt direction by Victor Salva, superb acting by Goldblum, Flanery, Mary Steenburgen and Lance Henriksen, other-worldly photography by Jerry Zielinski, and J.S. Bach-level score by the late great Jerry Goldsmith, POWDER is proof positive that sometimes our humanity DOES surpass our technology, even in Hollywood.",1116028800,,1582,5.172549019607843

760669,5,6304011431,"One thing that Powder brings to mind is that humanity has failed.  Humanity has been succumbed to insatible greed, violence, destruction, religious fundamentalism in a bid to have dominance, power and control over others, so insecure male supremacists can play people for fools while laughing all the way to the bank.  Most of the customers who gave this movie a bad review, are more or less likely to be racist, sexist, homophobic, and were angered by the movies' universal themes for they found their faults through Powder's character.  It is irrelevant whether or not ""god"" is simply energy that relays from live form to another.  The message in this movie is that humans before male supremacy were loving, caring, empathetic, sympathetic, open-minded, intellectuals whose values were not the least bid superficial or materialistic.  Their motives for being was working for leisure, living for pleasure, enjoying one another, laughing and loving and reflecting upon themselves and others around them.  People must take the time to connect with others as well as the universe and maybe then the human race will finally stumble OUT of the Dark Ages of which we still reside today.  Jerald Brockert wrote the best review of this movie and emphasized that those who feared this movie (as I have come to notice) are incredibly prejudiced and narrow-minded, and can only feel ""superior"" to others by destroying the lives of otehrs.  Powder represented what humanity was and what it should return to being.  Living for living.  I, personally, don't take any pleasure in destroying the lives of others and if you do, then I don't recommend you watch this film for you are the very evil that you feared most seeing reflected in this film.  Having suffered immense discrimination for my ""liberal-minded"" views, my being mixed-race, and being female as well, I can relate to Powder on every level of this film.
All of the scenes were well-planned.  It was a pleasure to finally see de-sexualized women as full human beings and not sex objects to be raped for the picking nor properties of men but contributors to human society.  Jeff Goldblum was outstanding as the science teacher.  Mary Steinburger, although having good intentions, still did not do what she thought best for Powder giving him a supposedly ""adequate"" home.
I believe that if you have the humanity and compassion, which most of us all lacking, to cry then you truly are human.  Those of us who are selfish, arrogant, and narrow-minded enough to think we are superior to others because of ""what"" we are as opposed to what one thinks, is a pathetic excuse of existence on Earth.  If we keep whining about violence, racism and prejudice then let's do something about it...eliminate it...if you're down with capitalism or supremacy of any RACE...then let Powder set the example that with compassion, empathy, and an ""attached"" vision with which to look at the world we can overcome all.
Brilliant, stunning, captivating, and remarkably touching for those of us with even a little humanity inside.  Powder will remind us all that our technology has surpassed our humanity.  That in the end we are all connected to one another.  If you are MATURE, a FreeThinker, with your own sense of individuality, never longing to be oppressed by any ideology, or fundamentalist behavior (like our beloved Muslim terrorists or capitalist junkies) than liberate yourself, free your soul and try just being HUMAN for once in your life...
An eye-opener...Powder plays on your fears like Madonna plays on feminism.

760674,5,6304011431,"What would happen if a being with an I.Q. off the measuring scale ,and near god-like powers, were born in rural Texas? Why, he would automatically be labeled as a freak, defective, retardate, and deviant, of course!

 That's the message of this message film, namely, that all you have to do to be denigrated and dehumanized in most of American society is to be ""different."" Whether that difference makes you fundamentally superior or inferior to the norm is irrelevant- all that matters is the fact that one is different. If you don't ""smell right"" to the dominant ape-like personalities in charge, then you must be rejected and driven out. I wish that I could say that the hateful characters in this film came across as cartoonish, but the fact is that they do not- they are perfect examples of the American norm. Even the more intelligent and sympathetic characters, such as Mary Steenburgen's character, participate in the dehumanization by mindlessly following the rules like good ""professionals.""  So, what you have here are the two extremes of human evolution, the god-like man, and the ape-like majority.

While it is the writing and message that stands out in this film, the special effects and the quality of dramatic acting are also far above the average. There are scenes here that you never forget: the father's rejection in the hospital, the ""friends don't"" scene in the councilor's office, the wedding ring scene, the dying deer scene.... Any one of them would have made a film memorable, but all together they make this a classic.

The film isn't all together depressing by any means. It is about hope. It shows what man may yet become, by contrasting the ideal with the all-too-prevalent current state of the species. As Jeff Goldblum states at the end, ""I see you and I think that one day our humanity may one day surpass our technology.""

I've found that there are few neutral opinions on this movie- people tend to either love it or hate it. The people that hate it seem to have a problem with the basic humanity and honesty of the character- they want to attack him too. Watch it with a friend- it will tell you if that person is worth keeping as a friend....",1077580800,,2179,4.721052631578948

760676,5,6304011431,"There are few films I have had the privilege of viewing that have had the ability to profoundly change the way I think about myself, and of my fellow humans on this Journey called Life.  I first saw this movie on television a couple of years ago now, and at the time had only managed to see about half of it, as it was a good hour into running when I tuned in.  Even so, the messages within the film were so touching, that I couldn't wait to try and purchase a copy of it on DVD.  Luckily for all of us, it was, in fact, available!
I loved everything about this film, from the special effects and cinematography, to the soul-stirring musical score by Jerry Goldsmith.  The role of 'Jeremy', brilliantly portrayed by then newcomer Sean Patrick Flanery, was a simple joy to witness.  Other supporting castmembers, including Jeff Goldblum, Mary Steenburgen and Lance Henriksen also provided us with very strong and memorable performances.  There are many lessons in this movie that each and every person on this Earth should be guided by.  That's exactly one of the main reasons this film is so important; because sadly, so many people around the world tend to live their lives shrouded in fear and hatred of those things they do not understand.  For example, there is a very  moving sequence in which the Sherrif (Henriksen) and Jeremy (Flanery), aka 'Powder' are in the same room alongside the Sherrif's dying wife.  I will not provide a narrative of the details here, but suffice to say at the scene's conclusion I challenge anyone caught in the middle of a family dispute, or refusing to surrender a deep-seated grudge with a loved one, or living daily life in an atmosphere of intolerance not to admit to the fact that this movie will leave you, at the very least, rethinking your position.
I would highly recommend this film be watched by young and old alike, as the lessons contained therein are of significant spiritual importance.  It is indeed gratifying to know that in an age of absurd violence against humanity and our planet, Hollywood has forever given us a wonderful glimpse of what our world might be like in the absence of fear, hatred, prejudice and intolerance, as seen through the eyes of one very special and gifted young man.
See this movie.  Better still, own this movie.  It is a timeless tale that beautifully encompasses a much deeper and broader understanding of hope, love, compassion and acceptance of those things that are well beyond our level of comprehension.",1075680000,,2490,4.709677419354839

As a teenager Powder's grandfather dies of natural causes, leaving him alone with the legal system. Because he's different he automatically attracts attention of the bad kind, which leads to some amazing and spectacular displays of what you can do with electricity, a Jacob's Ladder, and a dancing spoon.
This isn't your normal sort of movie, with ""poor child with a problem turns out to be amazing, the bad guys become his friends and he gets the girl"". Instead he was always amazing, he doesn't get really get the girl, the bad guys mainly stay trapped by fear, but Powder shows us the potential of the human heart and mind. It focusses on a theory of Einstein, who believed in life after death simply because energy does not disappear, it simply changes form. Powder can 'see inside' people, hear their thoughts, even those in a coma.

Take the ""abnormal"" personality that, without choice, maintains innocence into adulthood, insert it into a world of ""normal"" personalities, and watch the paradox unfold.  What sets Powder apart from the others is the depth of emotions evoked from the talents of second tier actors (with the exception of Jeff Goldblum), especially Sean Patrick Flanery as the lead character, and the feeling that you have just witnessed the unbelievable transform into the believable.

760846,3,6304011431,"I liked Powder.  It's not a great movie--there are a few too many problems for that accolade.  But it is creative in a number of respects, and certainly worth seeing.  I must admit, however, that having recently seen that creepy interview with Michael Jackson, he might have seen this movie too, and his skin bleachings may well be proof.
First, the flaws.  There's a gnawing and out-of-left-field piece of this film that is suggestive that one of the filmmaker's points was to glorify the ""odd, smart, and sensitive, yet persecuted homosexual"" stereotype.  Perhaps the clearest indication of this is the scene in which Powder stares at a muscular jock in a boy's locker room.  It was a scene that felt entirely out of place in the movie--an add-on that seemed to be intended as an ""in your face"" revelation that Powder represents gays.  The camera also seem to linger a bit too long on the male characters, with the female characters left oddly de-sexualized.  What was irritating about this apparent subtext was that it took away and trivialized what seemed to be a broader message, the message that human beings might well kill someone meant to save them.  In this regard, the more powerful metaphor for Powder seemed to be a Jesus story--with an odd, highly empathic, and powerful ""savior"" born under strange circumstances and ultimately persecuted by those he tried to help.  For me, it work on that level.
A number of critics pointed out that the story was derivative.  I agree.  But I thought it took various pieces from other stories and movies and wove them together in a compelling new way.  For me, Powder also worked as a kind of comic book tale of how a superhero might come to pass, and what a person with such powers might be like in real life.  (It was more successful in humanizing a superhero than Unbreakable, in my opinion.)
The casting could have been better, though.  Jeff Goldblum was awful.  Apart from his role in the Fly, where I thought he was perfect, he hasn't been able to pull together a decent performance.  I hope Igby Goes Down, which I have yet to see, is redemptive for him.  I've never liked Mary Steenbergen, and found nothing admirable in her performance.  I thought the young actor who played Powder was solid in the role.

The main answer is that powder is an overlooked work of art and if you stand back and take a breath, can see the many religeous implications that you can get from viewing. I have been hesitant in reviewing powder for the past few months, because I feared that I wouldn't do it justice. I wanted to prepare myself and grow in my writing skills so that you would understand exactly why Powder is so effective.
When you think of enduring characters, you may think of Citizen Kane, or William Wallace, maybe even Forest Gump, but due to the unabashadly blatant remarks from Hollywoods critics you are unlikely to think of powder. This is a shame. Though powder is not the all time greatest film, nor will it ever be, it falls into the category of ""timeless"". The special effects were done with next to zero computer effects, so that when C.G. are so realistic you can't tell the difference between real and artificial actors, powder will still be terrific in appearance style wise.
At the heart of the story is Jeremy, an albino that is cursed and blessed with multiple abilities. His mind is plagued with clarity and soaks knowledge like a sponge. Jeremy's body is electromagnetic and can manipulate the energy around him. One of the many scenes that catches you with your mouth open, is when his teacher brings in a Jacobs latter (two rods that channel an electric current which climbs up them in a strand). Jeremy grips his desk as a thick electrical bolt rushes him and raises him into the air by his heart.
Jeremy is surrounded by people that love and hate him. Or, like the sherrif, just don't understand him. Though his eyes must be shielded from the light of the sun, Jeremy radiates and equally bright amount of love and care on those that need it.

(USA - 1995)

Aspect ratio: 1.85:1
Theatrical soundtrack: Dolby Digital

Every so often, a movie comes out of nowhere which touches you so deeply, on so many levels, that it stays in your heart forever. POWDER is such a movie.

The premise is deceptively simple: Following the death of his last remaining adult guardian on their isolated farm, a young albino man nicknamed 'Powder' (Sean Patrick Flanery) is taken into the custody of local authorities. But his genius IQ and ability to harness electricity - leading to spectacular displays of apparently 'magical' behavior - arouses the suspicions of frightened townsfolk, and while he's able to change some people's lives for the better (and how!), others are too consumed by hatred to accept this strange, unique outsider. Thus, the stage is set for potential tragedy...

Writer-director Victor Salva (also responsible for the superb RITES OF PASSAGE, 1998) has constructed a modern parable which works both as a simple entertainment and as a powerful meditation on the nature of Good and Evil. Episodic in structure, the narrative pitches Powder's strange appearance and gentle manner against some of the worst aspects of the human condition - bigotry, mistrust, cruelty - and though Salva makes a brave attempt to portray these shameful characteristics in various shades of grey, his script acknowledges that some people are defined by their hatred and cannot easily be changed. That said, whilst the film doesn't flinch from the rough stuff, it's ultimately a joyous celebration of the human spirit: Though evil flourishes, goodness prevails.

POWDER contains a wealth of memorable moments, but some scenes are truly outstanding, such as Powder's first appearance as a ghost-like figure hovering in the darkness of the cellar where he's been hiding since his grandfather's death; the beautiful/terrible moment in the dining hall of the reformatory when Powder realizes he's never going to be accepted by his peers, no matter how hard he tries; the emotionally devastating sequence with the wounded deer (absolutely unforgettable!); and the sheriff's (Lance Henriksen) last desperate attempt to communicate with his terminally-ill wife (a touching, wordless performance by Dannete McMann). Few other 'fantasy' films of recent years have been so deeply, profoundly moving as this.

Production values are top-notch all the way down the line: From Jerzy Zielinski's beautiful, flawless cinematography, to Jerry Goldsmith's low-key score; from Waldemar Kalinowski's unobtrusive production design, to Dennis M. Hill's expert editing - this is the work of talented craftspeople operating at the top of their game, perfectly in tune with the director's intentions. But the real magic is conjured by a superb cast: Top-billed Mary Steenburgen and Jeff Goldblum are quietly effective in virtual supporting roles, while Brandon Smith underplays the part of a bigoted deputy sheriff whose life is changed forever by his encounter with the title character. As always, Lance Henriksen (who also played the lead in Salva's earlier THE NATURE OF THE BEAST, 1994) distinguishes himself as a humane but disillusioned lawman whose convictions are thoroughly shaken by Powder's remarkable abilities. Look out, also, for terrific turns by Bradford Tatum (as the leader of the bullies who make life a misery for Powder), Missy Crider (the potential love-interest) and the always-wonderful Susan Tyrrell (the sheriff's well-meaning but narrow-minded housekepeper) in small but crucial roles.

But the heart and soul of the picture is, of course, Powder himself, played with heartbreaking sensitivity by Sean Patrick Flanery. Almost unrecognizable beneath an unusual makeup job (by industry veterans Thomas R. Burman and Bari Dreiband-Burman) which preserves much of his natural beauty whilst also emphasizing the characters' appealing otherworldliness, he plays Powder without any trace of self-pity; instead, he highlights the kindness and vulnerability of a Christ-like figure whose greatest curse is his total comprehension of the world and its inequities, and by his understanding that he'll never be a part of it (when a vicious thug whispers in his ear: ""You really think you can be like us...?"", you half-expect Powder to reply: ""Who'd WANT to be?!""). Powder embodies many of the qualities which are largely absent from our own lives - goodness, compassion, and an appreciation of Nature in all its rich diversity - and Flanery captures those qualities with vivid grace. Of all the fine performances in this exceptional film, his is the most dignified and triumphant.

Though aimed at the widest possible audience, POWDER's theme of the persecuted loner will strike a real emotional chord with anyone who's ever found themselves on the sidelines, watching the rest of the world go by. This is a movie which speaks loudest to the outsiders amongst us, the disenfranchised and the dispossessed. It will be warmly embraced by anyone who's ever reached out to others and been rejected... anyone who's ever felt lost and afraid, or found themselves alone in the dark... anyone who's ever believed that the world has turned its back on them because of WHO and WHAT they are... anyone who's ever stood aside from the crowd and refused to relinquish their ideals in the face of overwhelming odds... POWDER is THEIR movie, their glimmer of hope. Once seen, never forgotten.",995587200,,5411,5.3341148886283705
760907,3,6304011431,"This is one of the more uneven films I've seen in the last few years.  There are moments that are blindingly inappropriate and ones that are deeply touching. There is a lot of pain here, and a sense of reconciliation that is undeniable, and I think that's why it had such an appeal for younger viewers.
The performances are uneven, too, though in some cases I think this has more to do with how the characters were written than with any lack of ability on the part of an excellent cast.  Lance Henriksen has rarely gotten roles this good. He is allowed a range of emotion that is way beyond most of the stuff he's been doing in the last couple of years. I really think this is one of his best performances, and if he doesn't have tears running down your face at least once during the film, you're a no-hoper.

Since the untimely death of Michael Jackson, I am compelled to update my review to include my thoughts about the character Powder and the strong parallel he makes to the King of Pop.  If ever there was a man who suffered such senseless persecution and indignities because he was ""different"", it was Michael Jackson.  Brilliantly gifted, highly evolved, and amazingly gentle and kind, he compelled us to care, to help to change the world.  How incredibly heart-breaking that he died before the mainstream recognized his message.

Michael Jackson was the  modern day poster child for ""bullying"".  This film is so relevant for today.  It's an amazing story and should be considered as educational curriculum in schools.

Powder was recommended by a friend. I saw it two years ago and found myself overcome with emotion and in tears at the end.  Yesterday evening, I happened to catch it on a local station and found myself as absorbed in the movie as if I had never seen it before!  As others have stated, the movie  has flaws but nothing is perfect!  Powder was so enlightened and  sensitive.  His strength came not from bravado, but from insight, caring,  and a deep respect for and love of life.

Because I'm an animal lover, the  scene with the dying doe was almost more than I could watch.  It's as if I  knew what he was going to do before he did it!  It was scary!  I knew that  Powder was only going to exist on Earth a short time.  He was far too  intelligent and elevated in his thinking and empathy to live among us  humans in this world. I could sense the pain he experienced from watching  how we treat each other and other creatures. It was a well-done example of  the best and worst of humanity--exposing the fears that form our  prejudices, and opening our hearts to allow the purest, deepest feelings to  surface.

This is a beautiful story about a beautiful human being.  I  highly recommend it to everyone!",964137600,,1934,4.627218934911243

760959,2,6304011431,"Powder I found to be a real disappointing film. And the main reason being because it has so much potential. Loads up potential, and a great concept. Yet it takes the concept and throws it into all these boring, barely  believable storylines, and never really goes where it needs to go. The  acting isn't very good at all, and we fail to even really get to know  Powder that well. How does he do the amazing things he does? Why? Seeing  something on screen anymore isn't enough to convince people it really could  happen. Good acting can sometimes do the job, and Powder certainly lacks  that. I mean Powder, if you're as smart and awesome as they display you in  this film, do something to shake the world up a bit, make everyone take  notice. Have your way.  And why does everyone automatically dislike him so  from the very get-go. I mean, before the kids at the bad behavior center or  whatever it is even know who Powder is they hate him, and they never get  him a chance to prove himself otherwise.  One last complaint, so many  issues fly through Powder. Being different, acceptance, tolerance, unseen  intelligence, electrical phenomenon, even a bit of homosexuality (which  didn't make much since). The issues are not given enough time and focused  on enough. We're at one thing, zoom, we go to another, without good  explanations.

761014,5,6304011431,"The first time I saw this movie I was really moved by it. It seemed the kind of thing I wish I had written as a story, or the kind of movie I would like to make.
After reading the reviews, most of which were negative, I  almost wondered if I had seen a different movie. Yes, there were flaws.  Perhaps, many, and reference to a Michael Jackson look-a-like might apply  in some eyes.
However, what I saw was a view of the best and worst of  humanity. Yes, it has been done before and perhaps better. But I felt it  was one of the few times when science and religion were tied to a common  ground.
Many laughed at this movie, especially the end and I wonder why,  unless I am wrong in it's overall interpretation.
To me, what it was  saying is that humanity is special in that we can know that we are part of  everything around us, and all is part of us. We can most of all touch each  other in powerful life giving ways. To feel each others pain, and even the  pain of everything around us that lives.
 To me the ending was a  self-sacrifice. He was giving, in a special way, his energy, love and  understanding, which was the best part of himself, to the universe and to  others. He knew that he was going to be limited in living a free life.  People would not ever leave him alone, and he could never be alone again,  now that he had been out in society.
Some have said that the other  characters in the movie were overdone. Perhaps, they were just  uncomfortable at seeing parts of themselves. Having been a victim of  prejudice and hatred myself, I have lived among some of these people, and  some of them are as close as next door to me, and I do not see anything  overdone about them at all.
 Mankind can be very cruel. Killing is cruel  when it is done for the pure sport of it. Unlike many others, I found that  scene very powerful when the boy passes the pain of a dying animal, who is  dying for no reason other than man's pleasure, on to the man who shot him.
The movie might have failed in many ways to make some of the points it  tried to make. Some of the scenes were not well done, but overall it was a  movie to ponder and to make us think, and a mirror for the best and worst  of ourselves. The characters were all of us. I believe that we are energy  and light, and goodness and darkness. But  in giving to each other and  loving each other, we can tap into our full humanity. That is what the  movie said to me. We are capable of so much, and life, the universe and  ourselves are so sacred.
 Sorry folks, I agree it was not a perfect  movie, but open your eyes. Neither are we, yet look at our recent around  the world celebration of 2000.
 We should be proud that it went without  incident all over the world. We deserved it after much of the pain and  torture of this past century. To me,  this movie was saying that the human  spirit is about peace, love, energy and light, and it is a gift we can  daily give to others, but some are too closed to see it, and for some their  pain is too great. We need to reach out to others, loving them and  ourselves more.
