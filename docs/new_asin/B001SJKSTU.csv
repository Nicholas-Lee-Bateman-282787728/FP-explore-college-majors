First, John Bianchi is one of most notable holster making experts you are going to find.  He started making holsters on side when he was a police officer, and wound up starting what was (and still may be, for all I know) the largest holster maker in the US.  You can find a display of Bianchi holsters in any gunshop in the US.  He also designed and manufactured the holster for the US military's standard Beretta 9mm sidearm.  Bianchi now spends his time on his first love - western holsters and teaching holster making.

Bianchi covers pattern making, leather, tools, cutout, stitching, wet fitting, and finishing.  Topics he hits along the way include sharpening of the head/round knife, edge burnishing, some hand stitching details, curve fitting (for belts), welting, and a host of others.  This is a really detailed presentation of not just a buscadero gunbelt and holster, but instruction on how to make generic fitting patterns and one/two holster versions without re-doing your work.

The total time taken is some 5-6 hours.  The really amazing thing is that he creates a gunbelt (with cartridge loops) and holster in real-time on the video.  That's right - he can scratch pattern, cut, stitch, line, and finish the belt and holster in a few hours - all the while taking considerable extra time to explain what he's doing.

There are some things that some people would pick over - perhaps the leather weights he uses, or his finishing technique (neatsfoot soak, basically).  Such nits should not deter anyone from ordering these videos, however, as you just aren't going to get better instruction anywhere, except perhaps at one of Bianchi's workshops in person.

The quality of the video and audio in this DVD series is superb.  It just doesn't get any better.

Absolutely 5 stars.",1235347200,,1885,4.862068965517241
