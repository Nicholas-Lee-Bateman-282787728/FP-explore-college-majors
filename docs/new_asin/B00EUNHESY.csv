8609616,3,B00EUNHESY,"This is a very brief video showing a beginner-level routine based on Yang style Tai Chi movements. Each movement is repeated several times, alternating from side to side. In the first part of the presentation, the teacher shows the hand movements only, without the feet movements; this part is easy to follow along and fairly interesting. In the second part, the teacher and an assistant show the movements with footwork included. This portion is poorly shot and edited. The camera periodically zooms in on only the feet, leaving you confused about what the hands are supposed to be doing at that time. Also, when it changes from one shot to another, the teacher seems to be at a different part of the form, so the effect is disconnected and difficult to follow along. There is no warmup and no detailed discussion of the finer points of the movements or mistakes to avoid. On the plus side, the instructor seems to be likable enough, and the form can be practiced in very little space. Just wish the video had a better director.",1494547200,,1029,4.69060773480663

8609618,4,B00EUNHESY,I like that he explains what each movement he is doing and its purpose and a smooth flowing transition from one movement to the next.,1478044800,,133,4.36

8609620,2,B00EUNHESY,"I have studied Tai Chi for 3 years. I lost my group and was hoping to find a dvd that would take its place.
This dvd is very basic and is not worth the money for anyone with any experience. I feel its description does not reflect its content.",1394323200,5,242,3.9591836734693877
