8427631,1,B004EU7W5S,"I went and bought one after hearing how infinitely superior this opera was to any of other modern operas, including all the A.L. Weber opuses (which I find mostly, but not entirely awful) and also Ca Ira by Roger Waters (which I found absolutely brilliant).
Someone compared it to the giants of the past, like Boris Godunov, by Mussorgsky.
So I prepared myself for a real treat.
Sorry to say, what a laughable mess I discovered through my headphones. The concept that would without a doubt work in some bombastic Hollywood production, simply does not work if you listen to it.
Lyrics is one complete flop. Too many unconvincing and sometimes unintentionally funny phrases following each other in rather wobbly order and glued together onto rather portentous conceptual framework does not make a good libretto.
Well, Oppenheim made an atomic bomb. He was a scientist. And he was asked rather nicely by US government. And his name became well known. He got celebrity status. That makes him worthy of TV time or cinema screen. But does it make his story a good opera material? I seriously doubt it. Ayatollah Khomeini would make better opera. Just think of it. Khomeini is a natural character, like Dimitri in Boris Godunov.
Oppenheimer is a geek amongst other geeks in grey suits caught between powers struggling for world domination. You cannot  blow him up into a character no matter how brilliant the opera singer is or how sophisticated the music you make. Atomic bomb already blown him up quite enough, pardon my bad pun.
Some non-Americans, especially from Middle East would agree, too.

The music is another point. It is not beautiful. It is beautifully executed, rather like an animation in the recent Hobbit movies. Well done! But as someone well put, this music is just like a scaffolding for the lyrics, and when lyrics is a laughing stock, it could not be saved by music, oh no. Exactly like that terrible Hobbit cannot be saved by nicely drawn hair on the computer models. When the whole concept is awful, the music just enhances and encrusts that awfulness.
Listening to that highly acclaimed Batter My Heart aria, which certainly has its moments - literally seconds of great singing and great melodic texture, one cannot shake off the background boredom and irritation. What a waste! Complete waste of money, combined talents, my time, someone else's time. Exactly like the The Hobbit. But someone made great money on it, it is popular, so it cannot be wrong. We need to justify its existence. Likewise, we have to justify the existence of the Atomic Bomb. Sure we do. Or at least have an excuse that looks legitimate enough.

This was done by REAL musician (not like that puny amateur Waters), totally different species of the human being. Like Peter Jackson is a professional cinematographer. Well, both have overall high ratings and highly accepted amongst other professionals of the sort. Can't argue with that!",1397088000,,2928,4.899193548387097
8427632,5,B004EU7W5S,"I never thought that the events surrounding the first ever, detonation of an atomic bomb(known as the ""Trinity"" test), in world history, on July 16, 1945, in Los Alamos, New Mexico, could be made into an opera, but Peter Sellars and John Adams, have composed the story, based on the diaries, archives, and government documents of J. Robert Oppenheimer, and the major players in his inner circle, with dazzling imagery and musical score.

This theatrical drama, performed through harmonious choruses and powerful solos, gives the audience greater insight into the scientists' conscience, personal conflicts and fears, and their lively discussions and debates, during this very pivotal moment in human history.",1326240000,,708,5.4363636363636365
8427633,5,B004EU7W5S,"John Adam's Doctor Atomic is riveting and this production brings out fine performances all around. Gerald Finley's interpretation of Oppenheimer's agonizing decision-making is outstanding! Additionally, Mr. Finley has a truly beautifully produced voice that he colors in just the right way to bring the character to life!",1311465600,,321,5.851063829787234
8427634,3,B004EU7W5S,"I saw this production at a local theater in the Metropolitan Opera's HD LIVE series on November 8th, 2008.

DOCTOR ATOMIC has its moments.  The first act builds up to a tremendous aria, Gerald Finley singing ""Batter My Heart,"" one of the Holy Sonnets of John Donne, as the character of Robert Oppenheimer.  The first scene is the assembled throng of Manhattan Project workers.  I was decidedly underwhelmed.  The second scene is a love scene with Oppenheimer and his wife Kitty -- much better, with Finley in fine form.  Then back to the bomb, with the test blast impending and a rainstorm, building tension.

Finally, the Faustian scene with Oppenheimer singing to God.  The problem with this is that Oppenheimer was Jewish, and not observant.  Yes, he did in fact use Donne's sonnet for the name of the Trinity Test Site in southern New Mexico, but this discrepancy undercut the power of the most powerful scene in DOCTOR ATOMIC for me.

The second act I found to be poorly conceived.  The weather and the delay in the test, which took place July 16th, 1945, drives the action, which strikes me as a small and mundane aspect of such a literally earth-shattering series of events.  The best part of Act II is Kitty, who in real life was a committed leftist and opponent of the Project, and who in the opera symbolizes the human conscience as well as the archetypal Woman standing against the deadly plans of the men, generals and scientists alike.

I was not at all convinced by the addition of a Noble Savage role for the Indian maid Pasqualita and a gallery of impassive male Indians in full regalia.  The ending is weak, with a pointed message about Hiroshima and Nagasaki, yes, (148,000 people were killed immediately by the only two atomic bombs ever to have been used in war, and 340,000 including those killed later by radiation poisoning and other effects), but not nearly as effective musically and dramatically as the ending of Act I.

As far as Adams's position as a leading American composer, I remain underwhelmed.  Minimalism has become merely one element in his eclectic but tonal style, now a sort of audience-friendly PoMo Lite, an acceptable badge of hipness, and Adams continually strives to be a contemporary composer for those who don't like New Music.",1308182400,7,2274,4.7774936061381075
8427635,3,B004EU7W5S,"After being very impressed with the Peter Sellars production of ""Doctor Atomic"" in Chicago, I was mildly disappointed with what Penny Woolcock did to it at the Met.  I guess that interpretation was supposed to be postmodern or something but I found it unnescessarily static and stodgy by comparison.  So my recommendation for a DVD would be the OPUS ARTE recording of the lively Sellars-directed production at the Het Muziektheater in Amsterdam.",1297555200,10,445,5.166666666666667
8427636,4,B004EU7W5S,"I recently watched the video of an earlier, completely different production from The Netherland, and found a copy of the score to study, which has sent me to review this once again. I believe this to be a major work of American opera, flaws and all. I discovered my ""issues"" with it have more to do with this production than the piece itself. With score in hand, I discovered how much interesting counterpoint the piece has. Solo lines weave their way throughout, especially some beautiful writing for solo horn. Alas, the nature of the ""everything is amplified"" writing style tends to bury much of that. But it is there, if you know to listen for it. I must admit, the more I listen to it, the more my appreciation grows. But had I never seen the other production, I doubt I would have spent the hours truly getting to know it. It's a tough nut to crack. Its demands on an audience are many. (For one thing, it is very long.) Its ambitions are high.

So how could an alternative production and a study score change things so much for me? It's complicated. In all ways but two, this production is stronger than the other. The score went through re-writes between three different iterations and all of them were for the better. The role of Kitty Opoenheimer was recast as a mezzo instead of the dramatic soprano it was in the other production. The vocal lines were rewritten to use the middle range of the voice in a more sophisticated manner. The high-lying phrases are fewer and more powerful for that. In contrast, the vocal line of J.Robert Oppenheimer has been adjusted up in several places, making them more powerful, too, and more easily projected over the orchestrations. Some ""natural"" sounds were laid on top of some sections to give them a different color. One choral part was rewritten. This affects no more than thirty minutes spread throughout a three hour opera. Only Kitty Oppenheimer's music is  recognizably different, if you watched them close together, as I did. The score I used was for a pre-Met production, so the changes were obvious. Unusually, for a new opera, there were no cuts.

The singing in this later incarnation is either held over from the earlier production, equally good, or superior. This is particularly evident in the woman singing Kitty Oppenheimer. From the earlier cast, Jessica Rivera is a fine musician, but the strain of the role, and a strident tone, work against her. Not that she is bad. In fact, she's great in most ways that count. She makes good character choices and understands how to make the music work. But she is no match for Sasha Cooke from the Met. She has a beautiful voice, evenly produced throughout the range, and she is no less a powerful singer and musician than her counterpoint. To be completely fair, the lowered lines help immensely. And of course, the raised lines just give Gerald Finley even more chances to shine.

So what are the two ways in which the earlier performance is better? One, the music in the second act is played with more variety. This aids all the musicians--in the pit and on the stage--and helps the length less noticeable. And two? Well, the major issue I have with the Met is the treatment of the character of Pasqualita. And no wonder! In the score and on the original stage, she is written as a housekeeper / nanny for the Oppenheimers. Her music is meant as a comfort for her children who are upset by the storm (not to mention the behavior of their employers). She sings what amounts to a LULLABY appropriate for older children!! She is a living, breathing person, trying to live with all that is going on around her without losing herself in the process...just like all the other characters. At the Met, she is a walking cliche of an Earth mother, a generic ""spiritual"" stand-in for all ""oppressed"" people. Her rather stock costume could have come from any Western of the 50's or 60's. She moves around the stage like a ghost. She has one expression for most of it. Her music is taken far too slowly. Meredith Arwady sings it beautifully, exceptionally so, but not much else. It does not impart wisdom, it invites scorn. Reducing a culture to its most obvious trappings is ludicrous,even offensive. Think of it this way: Christianity is more than The Beatitudes. Gay culture is more than drag queens and hairdressers. And she isn't the character John Adams and Peter Sellers, the librettist, wrote! Just watch Ellen Rabiner from the Netherlands. She doesn't have the beauty of voice that Arwady has, nor the heft, but she is creating a person like great singers ought to do. She's marvelous, if in a quiet way. I don't blame Arwady. She was doomed when she put on the costume. Since Sellers did not direct the Met production, I'll assume it isn't his idea, even if he went along with it. For these two reasons, the first production is a necessity if you want to capture all the power of the piece.

And the opera itself? Most of Doctor Atomic works beautifully. Certainly, the subject matter--the making and testing of the atomic bomb and its effects on those involved--is a strong foundation for an opera. The singing is top-notch throughout: It is, in turns, dramatic, luxurious, accomplished, moving, characterful, beautiful. But no one is quite as wonderful as Gerald Finley, one of the great singing actors in the world.  The heart of the score is the music of Oppenheimer and his painful confrontation of the moral ambiguities involved in making and testing a nuclear weapon. The musical setting of John Donne's text, ""Batter My Heart Three-Person'd God"" is some of the best music Adams has written, a modern Baroque lament. Finley sings it incomparably. Heart-wrenching and marvelous. On the whole, Act One, though a bit long, is always interesting, emotional, thought provoking and well-composed. And happily, on video, the large cast of men is more easily distinguished than when just listening.

Act Two is just too long to be completely successful. True, most of it is quite effective. (Especially in the Netherlands production.)  The highly emotional end builds to a sad, painful, quite disturbing conclusion (as it should be.)  And none of it is bad music. But to me, it just doesn't merit all that time. Once I truly got to know it, I can't say I was bored, but I wasn't always completely engaged either. This act is filled with good ideas--musically and dramatically--but not all of it pays off like it should. The earlier production does a better job of pacing it. In this production, the tempo changes are less differentiated which makes it all seem longer.

I wish it was just a difference in one production and another, but things get complicated when comparing the filming choices. The Netherlands production has perversely nonsensical shots. There are multiple images of Jessica Rivera's ear! It feels like a camera person had to run to the bathroom and didn't notice where the camera was pointed. It's ridiculous. It somewhat spoils the effect of the build to the end. The Met production doesn't make any of those kinds of mistakes, though we do get to look into a few character's noses. The sound of the recording is much better in the Met production. Certainly, the orchestras do not compare. As productions go, both have their strong points and their weak points. I'm not sure I prefer one or the other. If I had to choose? Taking into account the better singing in this production, I award it the prize.

This staging is very strong, given the nature of the piece, Part of the set is the periodic table made three-dimensional. It's is a great idea used wisely (with the horrible exception of the Native American scene, which is living statuary with musical accompaniment.) Production values are high. The actual detonation should get a comment. It is not depicted with a simple explosion. Personal taste will dictate if it works or not (I think it does.)

So I've happily changed my mind about Doctor Atomic. But I just can't award it the fifth star. I still feel it is an essential work of American opera. If you believe in the importance of new music, then you need this. The best way to appreciate it is by owning BOTH productions.",1296259200,21,8159,4.729957805907173
8427637,5,B004EU7W5S,"Doctor Atomic appears to be one of those operas one either loves or hates:  there is (apparently) no middle ground.  I'm strongly in the camp of those who love it - every minute, every note.  A fan of the original production by Peter Sellars, I was concerned with what I heard what director Penny Woolcock was doing with it I had misgivings.  They flew out the window as soon as I took my seat at the Metropolitan Opera, then again several weeks later at the cinema and now from the comfort of my sofa.  The production is unconventional, but then so is Adams' opera.

Julian Crouch's twin walls of boxes represent the periodic chart of the elements, but also let one's imagination morph them into scientific workplace cubicles, symbols of government intrusion and solitary confinement - individuals trapped or lost in a metaphysical maze - and more.  The ""special effects"" used to operate them are minimal but dramatically effective, particularly toward the opera's bone chilling finale.

Adams score - his richest to this point is filled with arias, duets, ensembles, choruses moving fluidly between stylized and realistic dramas, contemplative reminisces on man's plight, governmental responsibility, , actual drama and prayer, most notably in the Act I closing aria for Oppenheimer, ""Batter my heart, three person'd God"" - a remarkable setting of John Donne's sonnet, sung with an almost unbearable intensity and purity of sound by the remarkable Gerald Finley in what may well be the role of his career.

Richard Paul Fink, Eric Owens, Sasha Cooke, Earle Patriarco, Roger Honeywell, Thomas Glenn and Meredith Arwady all make their characters believable, with Miss Cooke making a frightfully vulnerable Kitty Oppenheimer.

I don't think Adams ever wants his work to be easy on his audience.  He is probing, inquisitive, suggestive, menacing, thoughtful, arbitrary and indirect.  His operas lay open every possibility for exploration of their drama - usually with an objectivity not found in most of the cut-and-dry scenarios we like in our opera.  In almost all of Adams' work, every character emerges both as hero and monster.  Understandably, for some people, such ambiguity of character is disturbing in that they find themselves unable to relate to the characters they're trying to understand.  Who is the villain?  Who, the hero?

Critics and audiences alike have wrestled with not only the difficult theme of this Manhattan Project  project, but the very manner by which it was constructed:  with elements of  electronic etude, symphonic sturm und drang, ancient and modern
philosophies, dance, ballet, and a libretto about as far away from ""standard issue dramaturgy"" as Philip Glass's Bhagavad Git- inspired ""Satyagraha.""  (Adams and Sellars also draw from the Indian epic for ""Dr. Atomic"").  Poetry - especially in the guise of ""sonnets"" (the word itself sounding affected to many audiences, particularly American ones), is not what one expects in plays, lyrics, songs - and barely in arias.

Making his debut is conductor Alan Gilbert shortly before his assumption as Music Director of the New York Philharmonic.  He seems to feel the score down to his marrow and elicits a performance that is in every way a stunning achievement.

I believe if one gives oneself over to Messrs. Adams and Sellars and Miss Woolcock, this DVD of the Metropolitan Opera's production of a genuine masterpiece will provoke thought and haunt your dreams for days . . . or longer.",1296000000,14,3470,5.120781527531084
