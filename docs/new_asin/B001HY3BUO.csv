3645306,4,B001HY3BUO,"God's Army started the LDS film industry by making a movie that packed everything dramatic that could possibly happen in mission into the course of a single transfer in a single district. The protagonist is the only member in his family, they heal a crippled man, one missionary leaves the Church, and [Spoiler Alert] another dies. It's entertaining, it has strong character development and a raising climax and plot twists.

Errand of Angels is the antithesis of God's Army. This movie is about a young woman who spends 18 months in Austria. She starts out with a companion she gets along with really well then gets a companion that's strange but has good qualities when you get to know her. She serves and loves the people she works with, regardless of where those people's interests go. She, along with her companion, works, and works and works by knocking doors and talking to people on the street. It's often monotonous and tiring. I particularly liked the part when a man says he would be interested in their message and it take her a little while to figure out how to respond since she's used to people outright rejecting her invitations. However, her labors do bear fruit, mostly in small-yet rewarding ways and once or twice in big ways. The movie shows the little rewards, coupled with the personal growth the young woman experiences, make her mission a positive, life changing experience.

I highly recommend this movie to LDS youth as a way of getting a taste of what missions are actually like. The phenomenal, home-coming-talk stuff happens, but most of it is day-to-day work that is tiring and can be monotonous and unpleasant, yet is rewarding in and of itself. I recommend it to all Latter-day Saints as a good portrayal of how missionary work is. I can't imagine that non-LDS will enjoy this movie much. To them I suggest watching the Saratov Approach as a good movie about LDS missionaries.",1393804800,5,1909,4.781818181818182

3645308,5,B001HY3BUO,"I loved this movie.  My 6 year old daughter loves this movie. As someone who served a mission, I found I could not only identify with those experiences, but feel the same feelings I had felt from my mission all over again.  It brought back so many memories.  I did not go to a different country but I can truly relate to all of the different experiences these missionaries had.  Loved it.",1321315200,3,388,4.347222222222222

3645312,5,B001HY3BUO,"I completely enjoyed this movie. I often recommend this movie to friends and have given it as a gift as well. I felt like it really captured what life is like as a young female missionary; and how it is to live in a foreign country with people you don't always understand. This is a drama about real people, with real feelings; no crazy unbelievable things or characters.",1279670400,7,371,4.470588235294118

8309975,5,B001HY3BUO,"The story line is of a missionary who is serving a Mormon mission for 18 months. The movie starts with the missionary receiving orders and ends with a few flash backs and having learned some of life's lessons. In particular, how to live with people who are different than you are. Over all I though the movie accurately reflects life as a missionary, there is probably a bit more tension, but definitely a lot of humor mixed in with quieter moments. The fact that simply being the best person possible and remaining faithful even when no one is remotely interested in hearing your message is the norm. It is a great movie for the whole family. Sisters who have been on missions will be reminded of the bitter and sweet of their own mission experience. What makes the movie exceptional is the quality of the script, acting, cinematography, wardrobe, etc.",1453248000,3,853,4.693333333333333
