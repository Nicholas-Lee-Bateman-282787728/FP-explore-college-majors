7916732,4,B000035Z33,"Comedians Steve Martin and Eddie Murphy team up with a talented cast of supporting actors, which include Terrence Stamp, Heather Graham, Robert Downey Jr., Christine Baranski, and many others to give us an original comedy unlike any other for some time.

In this 1999 motion picture, which was directed by Frank Oz, Martin plays Bowfinger, a movie director who is down on his luck and close to broke, who is brought a script by one of his employees-friend. As Bowfinger reads the script, he realizes that this script could make him famous. As the story unfolds, Bowfinger starts to call his friends in to help him make the picture. Christine Baranski chips in a wonderful performance as another one of Bowfinger's close friends that he calls when he is in need.

As Bowfinger goes to pitch the movie to a big budget producer played by Robert Downey Jr., he realizes that he needs a big time star to put the movie on the map. Due to financial difficulties, Bowfinger and his henchmen have to film the movie without Eddie Murphy's character, Kit Ramsey, who is all the rave of Hollywood at that moment, having knowledge that they are including him in the scenes without his knowledge of the fact.

In shooting some of the scenes, Martin, who wrote the screenplay, shows some of his comedic genius with some of the situations that he puts the actors in. The garage scene with the dog is one of the funniest scenes I have ever seen. I couldn't stop laughing as I thought about how they got the dog to do the scene.

 Heather Graham plays an innocent looking girl from Ohio, who when it all comes down to it, will do anything it takes to get into the movies.

 Terrence Stamp plays the head of a cult called Mind Head which Kit Ramsey seems to be their biggest contributor of. As Kit goes to Mind Head to help him with his anxiety about being a black man in racist Hollywood, the Mind Head gurus use him to help fund their extracurricular activities.

I'm not sure what Steve Martin was trying to accomplish by poking fun at the people and what it takes to make a movie in Hollywood but ninety-seven minutes of sheer fun is what he did accomplish.",1111017600,,2142,4.516795865633075
7916733,4,B000035Z33,"There are some movies that are just pure fun.  Bowfinger is one of them. Steve Martin plays a down-and-out movie producer.  He decides to make a film without the star, Eddie Murphy, knowing about it.  So he gets a film  crew and follows Murphy around, placing him in situations and capturing it  on film.
Murphy plays two roles, one of the film star and one of a rather  dumb guy hired to play the film star's double.  He is so good I thought it  was two different actors.  He has the ability to twist his face into  outrageous expressions and get laughs from just a gesture.
The whole  story is satire and done well.  I found myself laughing throughout and,  even though the film was predictable from start to finish, I wasn't bored  for a moment.
It's a silly movie and that's what it's supposed to be.",952560000,5,804,4.380952380952381
7916734,3,B000035Z33,"Uneven comedy.  Several hilarious scenes, but also long, boring sequences that fails to be funny, especially in the beginning.  Inspired by Ed Wood, but not a  remake.  Ed Wood was a funny drama, this is an occasionally  funny comedy. Best scene: Eddie Murhpy being followed by footsteps in a  dark parking lot.",950400000,,311,4.884615384615385
7916735,4,B000035Z33,"I expected this movie to be a little hokey and lame, but instead I found it entertaining and definitely worthwhile. It's very well written and acted. Probably the best Steve Martin film since Parenthood. And Eddie  Murphy is at his best!",949363200,,237,4.780487804878049
7916736,2,B000035Z33,"I couldn't find too many things to chuckle about in this one, just like all of the other Steve Martin movies. I thought that at least Eddie Murphy can save this one, but then again, it was written by Steve Martin.  Although there was a great plot, the jokes were too bland for my taste.  "" Tom Cruise didn't know he was in a vampire flick until two years  later.""..that and how Martin's character rounded up his crew for the  movie were two of the funniest moments from Bowfinger, but that's it. The  rest was comedy that anyone can find from a saturday morning cartoon.",948585600,,570,4.390476190476191
7916737,1,B000035Z33,"I just got done watching this movie, and had to come on line to tell everyone how bad it is. The only bright spot is Eddie Murphys dual role. This reminds me of another dog Bullworth. If you liked that movie you will  like this one. Rent or buy ED WOOD with Johnny Depp and Bill Murray.",948412800,2,286,4.017543859649122
7916738,5,B000035Z33,This is probably the funniest comedy of the year. The plot concerns a down-on-his-luck producer(?)named Bobby Bowfinger who's next film will star a famous action star named Kit Ramsey without his knowledge!,943142400,6,206,5.46875
