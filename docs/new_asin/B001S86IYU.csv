3784850,5,B001S86IYU,"""LIFE OF RYAN"" is an MTV series created by Joey Carbone (Carbone Entertainment) which the first two seasons aired on MTV and the third season is featured on this complete series on DVD.

The series focuses on the life of pro skateboarder Ryan Sheckler, the youngest winner of the X-Games at the age of 13 and now focusing on the teenager from age 16-18, as he tries to become champion again.

Unfortunately, things are not as simple for the life of Ryan as his parents Gretchen and Randy have gotten into a divorce which both parents try to be civil but it for Ryan, it has hurt him emotionally.

As he tries to live life with his younger brothers Shane and Kane and his mother/manager Gretchen in surfer town San Clemente, he tries to have a relationship with his father who has found a new girlfriend.  Helping Ryan deal with life are his best friends Casey, Tony, Taylor and Mitch.  But throughout the series, Ryan struggles with divorce, his mother as his manager, his relationship with his father, his friends and also trying to find a girlfriend, managing multiple businesses and just dealing with his fandom and his ""haters"" while pursuing his quest to win another X-Games.

  1. MY HOUSE, MY RULES - Ryan has moved into his new house but he starts to have many parties and everyone invited.

  6. WHAT'S NEXT? - Ryan finds out that Casey and Mitch have been accepted to a college in Colorado and are moving in two weeks.  For Ryan, this is devastating and a life changing experience.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

What I enjoy about ""LIFE OF RYAN"" are the  various shots of San Clemente, outdoors, sunshine and it really helps the picture quality.  With many reality TV series, when indoor scenes are captured, the amount of noise is just enormous.  So, it was pretty cool to watch the series and notice how cool and vibrant the colors are and overall, looked good.

Audio quality features Dolby Digital stereo and dialogue is clearly heard.  If anything, the series is front-heavy and there is a lot of utilization of music, thus you get a good dialogue/music driven audio track.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""LIFE OF RYAN"" features three special features which are Ryan Sheckler skateboarding footage from various competitions.  Included are:

  * ""KAMIKAZES"" Skate Video (2:01)
  * ""PEACE WITH NOTHING"" Skate Video (2:13)
  * ""CALL IT OFF!"" Skate Video (3:16)

""LIFE OF RYAN"" is really entertaining and if anything, I think the film really showcases the personal life of pro skater Ryan Sheckler.  Showing that he's just a normal teenager who experiences the same emotions, stresses out and has real-life problems like every teen out there.

Granted, Sheckler is a multi-millionaire, has several businesses and is quite successful but the series is not so much about his skateboarding competitions and business life but mainly about how this athlete is dealing with his parent's divorce, dealing with his relationships with family and friends but how he has to live these separate lives of being a professional and having to be a regular teen and learning that for him, it's difficult.

But the heart of the series is his relationship with his mother and father.  His mother Gretchen is a manager that wants to make sure his son knows what his schedule is and what he has to prepare for but during these tough times, when he needs his mother, she's often in manager mode and it cause a bit of friction between the both of them.

As for his father Randy, the divorce has hurt him financially and emotionally.  And as tough as he looks as a businessman and biker, he cares about his son a lot and gives him advice.  But because his father is more businesses minded and logical, it causes some friction between father and son as well.

If anything, the problems that Ryan goes through is trying to be the middle man between his father and mother.  While dealing with the stress of competition and high school life, it's more than a teen can handle and it shows on camera.

Ryan seems to stress out with each episode and granted, he has every reason to.  And you can see how that worry over his personal relationships with family has somewhat transcended into his relationships with friends, which are like family to him, it's understandable why his life seems quite dramatic on TV.

But the positive of the series is that many children and teens feel they have no way to go when they get into this stressed out or depressed state.  When you have so many things coming after you, it all depends on how you deal with it.  And for Sheckler, despite his parents divorce, his parents love him and no matter what little squabbles they have, he is the first one to offer the olive branch and realize that he doesn't want to have any negative vibes around him, even with his friendships.  He's always eager to work things out.

For many young athletes, you could only read about these types of situations in autobiographies but this a first that documents the life of a teen athlete and what goes behind-the-scenes in his personal life.  No matter how much money, cars or fame that he has accumulated, he's still a young guy with emotions and he hurts like everyone else and people get to see that.

I will say that the first two seasons are very well-done but once you get to the third season, many wonder why it wasn't aired on MTV and watching it, I can see why.  The first episode alone, shows Sheckler at his new home, constantly partying and coin toss into cups, partiers getting drunk and getting into fights and even a scene where Ryan has to pickup Tony's used condoms around his house (which I can't believe he didn't use gloves or something aside from his bare hands to pick it up with), the third season may be a bit hardcore for the young MTV audience.

The unfortunate thing about the third season not being aired is that Sheckler does accomplish in getting his second gold medal at the X-Games but also shows how his fame has made him infamous.  The scene where he is booed by the audience is just sad but it's the price an athlete pays, you're going to have people who love you and hate you but for a teenager, it may be a bit much.  Fortunately, he turns that negative energy to something positive.

The third season was canceled at six episodes but fortunately, everyone can watch these six episodes on this complete series on DVD.

Overall, ""LIFE OF RYAN"" is an addicting show.  Very dramatic and more on the male side as opposed to shows like MTV's ""LAGUNA BEACH"" which focused more on the drama on the female end.

Similar to ""LAGUNA BEACH"", Ryan's friends have a hard time being around the camera at times, especially when it looks like he's about to give them a tonguelashing for something they did wrong.

But this series is addicting and fun.  I found myself glued watching episode after episode and even my wife who never watched an episode on MTV, found herself watching episodes back-to-back. It's a fun reality TV drama series.

All in all, If you enjoyed ""LIFE OF RYAN"" on MTV, then definitely check out the ""LIFE OF RYAN: THE COMPLETE SERIES"" as it also contains the unaired third season.  A lot of episodes and you can find it for a great price! Definitely worth checking out!",1240272000,9,12174,4.452445652173913
3784851,5,B001S86IYU,"Before MTV started airing this series, the only thing I really knew about skateboarding was that it was an ""extreme sport"" and it's biggest star was Tony Hawk. This was mainly because of the multiple video games that were released bearing his name.

But, as I was about to learn, there was a kid on the skateboarding scene who was making noise and looking to possibly become the next big name in the sport. Ryan Scheckler started skateboarding and winning competitions at a young age. This documentary/reality series sees him going through many changes. These include: working, winning, losing, being injured, getting back on his feet, dealing with his parents' divorce, dating, maintaining a relationship with his brothers, navigating issues with his group of friends, buying his own home, and getting a role in a Disney film...all at the age of 18.

The series does a good job at looking at Ryan's life, past and present, at appropriate times to bring the whole story home. It gives the viewer an entertaining look at the work life and personal life of this young skater. My only criticism of Ryan is that he comes off at a crybaby in alot of the situations and may come off like a brat. I made comments while watching about this, but looking back, I'm sure even he would say now that he was acting immature. Think about it. A kid that is 17 or 18 years old who is dealing with all kinds of unrest in his personal life all while trying to maintain a high-paying skating career and image for his fans and advertisers can probably become overwhelmed. Anyone, regardless of age or pay that has that much on their plate would probably struggle with it. I kind of wish that the series was made now that he's older, but I think that would take away from the growth theme documented in this time period.

Virtually no stone is left unturned in Ryan's life. His love of skating is obvious. He spends alot of time skating with friends, training, designing skate parks and thinking about his craft. His relationships with family, friends, his manager, other skaters, fans, sponsors, girlfriends...it's all here.

If you're mildly interested, even though it's a few years old, I suggest that you give this series a look! It's far more entertaining and better produced than something like Jersey Shore or the Hills because it IS reality.",1239062400,,2327,4.724137931034483

8339477,5,B001S86IYU,I'm not a fan of Ryan Sheckler but had vaguely heard of him when I came across this DVD set.  I had seen a few episodes on MTV and wanted to see the whole series.  Overall Seasons 1-3 put together a great story about this man.  It's easy to find a lot of things in common with him even not being a skateboarder myself.  I especially enjoyed watching him build his business and seeing the struggles and dedication it takes to run a business while still being a celebrity skateboarder.,1337472000,,483,4.333333333333333
