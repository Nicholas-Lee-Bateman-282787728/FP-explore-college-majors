8284887,4,B001BTZV76,"I've enjoyed working with this video. It presents the basic rhythms you need to know in a clear and orderly matter. That being said, there are segments where the material is demonstrated just too fast for a beginner to pick up on, even if watched repetitively. In particular where he demonstrates ""putting it all together"" musically after each instructional segment. Particularly the concept of ""running"".

In addition, wish there was a segment on what type of drum works best with this video.

I sense this video is a great adjunct to those studying with an instructor and not one's only source of instruction. Unless an individual is exceptionally gifted and grasps the material it's tough.

I welcome any suggestions reviewers/instructors, players, etc. have towards tackling the obstacles I describe.
If any reviewer out there has any suggestions how to approach..",1428364800,,868,5.185714285714286
8284888,5,B001BTZV76,"Great teaching material. I love Karim Nagi, his teaching methods are not boring at all. You should also try his dvd for playing the Riq.",1392249600,2,136,4.48
8284889,5,B001BTZV76,I am very pleased with this video! Each time I practice I get better.  It goes beyond what other beginner videos have taught me!  I am practicing for a parade and this is a big help and inspiration.,1380844800,,198,4.184210526315789
8284890,5,B001BTZV76,For all you intermediate drummers out there this is the DVD for you.  If you want to learn more advanced rhythms? how to transition in and out of them? every fill and ornament you can think of? as well as learning how to communicate with dancers and have fun doing it with Karim Nagi and special guest dancer Ava Fleming!!!  Hello??? This is it.  Of course for Beginners there is Rhythms of the Arab World 1.  Enjoy!,1379635200,2,416,4.363636363636363
8284891,4,B001BTZV76,"I recommend this product to all intermediate players who are looking for different rhythms and approach.

Pros:
- The product stands out from the others with its rich and unique rhythms.
- Good video and audio record.
- The instructor is a master in his Arabic technique.
- Very clear explanations about the rhythms.
- He explains important points while performing with a dancer.
- His attitude is very warm.

Cons:
- His technique is traditional Arabic technique. If you are looking for a modern and promising technique like Turkish technique (split finger technique) you will be dissappointed.",1346716800,2,595,5.061224489795919
8284892,5,B001BTZV76,"As followup instruction to Rhythms of the Arab World 1, this DVD takes you further into techniques and rhythms. As an intermediate player, I bought both together, previewed both and am working solely on Rhythms 1 until I master that.  Rhythms 2 is the same excellent instruction but too advanced for me at the moment.  I like knowing that I have this further instruction available as soon as I am ready.  Highly recommend.",1282348800,,422,4.7534246575342465
8284893,5,B001BTZV76,"Karim Nagi has created the perfect follow-on to his first video here with Rhythms of the Arab World, Volume 2.  By that I mean that it builds on Volume 1 but isn't more of the same, but by the same token doesn't suddenly leave us behind by going too advanced suddenly.  This DVD is a generous offering in 4 parts:  advanced techniques, rhythms, switching between rhythms, and drumming for a dancer (this last part alone sets it far apart from any other drumming video I've seen).

The techniques he presents are as usual laid out very logically, and they are illustrated alone and in the context of the Ayoub and Belledi (Masmudi Seghir) rhythms.  From left-hand rolls to fills such as triplets, quadruplets, and sextuplets (and oh what a beautiful sextuplet he lays down!  I'm still trying to master it months later), and then to the ""Sak with both hands,"" more widely known as a ""pop,"" demonstrating several versions of this important accent.

From there we're treated to a wonderful array of advanced rhythms including the Masmudi Kabir, Samai, York Samai, Maghrebi, Karatchi, Adani, and a few others.  Karim lays down each rhythm very clearly and slowly at first so it's easy to get the feel of them, then plays at a couple speeds, moderate and then overdrive, to demonstrate several ways to fill or ornament each rhythm, always ending with a flourish.

Karim then demonstrates how to switch back and forth seemlessly between two complementary rhythms, a section which I found extremely helpful and fun, as it's too easy as a drummer to play a single rhythm ad nauseum.  This will definitely add spice and interest to your playing.

Finally, the excellent section on drumming for a dancer is essential for those drumming for bellydancers.  Karim demonstrates how a drummer can both express his creativity while still staying ""grounded"" in the rhythm, so as to keep the dancer in the groove.

All in all, a very professional, very important video for those who really want to reach the next step in the amazing world of Arabic drumming.  Definitely worth getting if you love the drumming and the rhythms.",1253491200,5,2107,4.832869080779944
8284894,5,B001BTZV76,"This is the second of Karim Nagi's instructional videos on learning the doumbek. It builds on Vol 1 which introduces fundamental techniques for playing the drum.  Even if you are an experienced player, and especially if you are a beginner I suggest starting with Vol 1.

I'm a professional drummer, percussionist, teacher who had some familiarity with middle eastern rhythms but was having difficulty finding good instructional material or good teachers for the doumbek.  Not only can Karim play the drum but he is a true musician. He presents the material in a way that builds on previous lessons, emphasizes getting a good sound and offers suggestions to play more musically.  It is also filmed in a way that the student can watch and hear simultaneously.  I highly recommend this.  I hope to take some lessons from him the next time we're in the same city!!",1231286400,5,860,4.8561643835616435
