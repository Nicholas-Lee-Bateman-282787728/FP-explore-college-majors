8537263,4,B00979KQ18,"""Change of Heart"" (1934) was the last of the films of Charles Farrell and Janet Gaynor and a fine swan song it is. With a good script and sensitive direction, the couple join James Dunn and Ginger Rogers as a quartet of college graduates setting off to New York to make their way.  This is a depression movie so unemployment is a major issue. The film's situations are credible as they sort out their personal relationships and establish careers. While the contrast of the snazzy Ginger Rogers in a rare but convincing unsympathetic role to Gaynor is obvious, the former ushering in a new era of modern leading lady, it is Gaynor's beautiful performance which holds the film together. She was a great film actress because she used her eyes to convey emotion and with suitably restrained close-ups, the audience always knows her thoughts. There is a rich array of supporting actors, the stand out being Beryl Mercer as the owner of a charity shop which trades in finding homes for orphans. The film also preserves a realistic vision of life in the Depression in New York and for that reason in 2015, it now has historical value beyond its low-key entertainment values.

The film has been issued in the Fox Cinema Archives series which is very basic. The print is not very good with splicing jumps and poor contrast but at least we have it to view.",1451692800,4,1346,4.651260504201681

8537265,5,B00979KQ18,"""Change of Heart,"" starring the unbeatable romantic team of Janet Gaynor and Charles Farrell, need not have been their last film together. Had there been a Frank Borzage to direct them in films worthy of their talents, they could have left a deeper legacy beyond compare. ""Change of Heart"" is not a great film, or even close to it, but it shows two things quite clearly: First, Gaynor and Farrell still possessed the magic to win the hearts of audiences, even with less-than-first-rate material. Second, Hollywood, even at that early date, had begun its downward spiral away from stories that touch the heart to stories that offer second-rate mediocrities to entertain the masses. We will never see the likes of Gaynor and Farrell again.",1403481600,10,737,4.951612903225806

Thank you.",1389052800,,274,4.074074074074074
