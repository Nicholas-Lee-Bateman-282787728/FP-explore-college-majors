761759,5,6304005989,"With all the fuss over the re-release of Rififi not so long ago, I had hoped that there would be an equal or greater to-do over Topkapi, hands down the better of the two films.  A brilliant cast, exotic locales, superb story, adult humor, a timeless score, and heart-pounding suspense make this one of the most enjoyable films I have ever seen.  This is really a classic, and I for one am hoping for a DVD; I would love to hear some behind-the-scenes reminiscences or see a making-of documentary, if one exists.  I guarantee you will want to see Topkapi more than once...",991353600,5,571,4.524271844660194
761760,5,6304005989,"One of my favorite films, and quite possibly the most entertaining caper movie of all time.  A jewell thief (Melina Mercouri) has her heart set on a fabulous emerald-encrusted dagger.  The priceless object is being kept at the high-security Topkapi Museum in Istanbul.  Mercouri enlists the aid of sometime lover (and professional thief) Maximilian Schell to devise and execute an intricate plan of stealing the dagger.  Schell assembles a team that includes Robert Morley as an inventor and electronics expert, and Peter Ustinov as a small-time con man who doesn't realize that he's part of the scheme.  Ustinov is persuaded to spy on Mercouri's group by Turkish authorities who think the gang members are terrorists, but he is eventually made aware of the actual intentions of the thieves.  The first few minutes of TOPKAPI may lead you to believe that you're in store for one of those hopelessly fluffy ""comedies"" of the 60's.  But don't be fooled.  From the moment the jovially frantic music score is played over the opening credits, rest assured that you're about to be treated to a light-hearted, fast-paced movie that expertly combines humor, suspense, and thrills.  The international cast is great, but Peter Ustinov is especially delightful to watch in the role that won him the 1964 Oscar for best supporting actor.  As Arthur Simpson, a shifty yet sympathetic character who gets used by just about everyone in the film, Ustinov easily steals the movie (although Akim Tamiroff also has his share of funny moments as a drunken cook).  This film has all the elements for a first-rate piece of entertainment:  an engaging cast, exotic locales, good dialogue, and artful direction by Jules Dassin whose earlier work in RIFIFI partly inspired this movie.  TOPKAPI is a wonderfully entertaining motion picture that should appeal to everyone.",978134400,28,1845,5.11

So in an effort to get there, the film just goes there without logic or connection of the dots. There is a reason why few I know have heard of this film, which wastes some reasonably good performances in an albeit very contrived and badly dated film. I give it 2 stars for the scenery and acting. I could barely understand a word of Mercouri's performance and she was far from being the dazzler that she is portrayed. But that really isn't the worst of it. The awkward manner the twist in this film is handled as well as there being absolutely no connection at all between the conspirators and the act made this film a total loser.

762047,3,6304005989,"Written and directed by Jules Dassin, Never On A Sunday (1960) propelled Melina Mecouri to international stardom.  Dassin and Mecouri were a couple who eventually married in 1966, and would do several films together, including the caper film Topkapi (1964).

Although heist films seldom end with a roaring success, the genre has generally remained a popular one, as there is often great entertainment value in the planning and execution of many a criminal act.  Having previously worked on the highly regarded Rififi (1955), which was also about a jewel robbery, Dassin was very familiar with the genre.  Topkapi has a much lighter tone, and incorporates some of the trademark elements of caper flicks, as a band of thieves attempts to steal a priceless dagger from the Topkapi Palace in Istanbul, Turkey.

Elizabeth Lipp (Mecouri) puts together a team, headed by Walter Harper (Maximilian Schell) to execute her plan to steal the dagger.  Technical expert Cedric Page (Robert Morley), and acrobat Giulio (Giles Segal) are also onboard.  The gang hires petty hustler Arthur Simpson (Peter Ustinov), who knows nothing about the robbery scheme, to drive a car loaded with arms and explosives into Turkey.  The cache of contraband is discovered, and Simpson is forced into working for the police, to uncover the details of what they believe is an assassination attempt.  Through a chain of circumstances, Simpson becomes a critical player in the daring robbery attempt, that requires brute strength, stealth, patience, and athletic skill.  Things are going as planned, but as crime can't be shown to pay, the unexpected happens, and Lipp has to come up with a new scheme.

Topkapi is a fine example of a quirky 60's caper film.  It is strong in the technical execution department, and there is some humor, but it is not excessive.  There's not a great deal of camaraderie among the group, but they perform most ably when it counts.  While Elizabeth Lipp is the mastermind, she has very little to do with the actual theft, except as a decoy who laughs a lot.  As Mecouri slides into the background, Ustinov steps into the spotlight in a performance that earned him an Academy Award.  Maximilian Schell is quite capable and debonair, while Giles Segal performs some impressive athletic feats.

Approaching fifty years in age, Topkapi probably won't seem very impressive to today's audiences used to spectacular action, but for its time it was entertaining and fairly edgy.  Melina Mecouri may be a product of the times, and something of an acquired taste, but the film's humor and intrigue with the police, do stand the test of time a little better.  It's not an absolute classic like A Shot In The Dark (1964), but with a solid cast and some tense moments, it is worth checking out for anyone interested in heist films from that time period.",1311811200,3,2837,4.959830866807611
762048,5,6304005989,"Beyond having a realistic scenario, what makes or breaks a caper are the characters:  they have to be funny, smart, manipulative, and self-destructive.  By this measure, there simply isn't a better caper film.  Even my kids, who prefer films made after 2000, watched this and laughed along with us, the parents.

The caper is to replace a priceless artifact in a museum with a fake.  The masterminds, the charming and brilliant Schell and the seductive Mercouri, unite a motley crew of amateurs, starting with Ustinov, a sleazy twit exploiter of tourists.  Schell plans every detail meticulously, with many contingencies should complications arise, which he must continually re-set in the face of the screwups of his colleagues.  First, Ustinov is arrested at the border and is drafted into spying on the group, though he gets co-opted into their vision.  THen the muscle man is injured, so Ustinov must replace him.  Finally, they have to speed up their schedule because the intelligence services think they are planing something later.

Perhaps the most arresting scene in the film is the precision operation in the museum itself.  Really fun, scary, and lives up to the maxim that any time you plan a crime, 50 things can go wrong, 25 if you're a genius.

This is not a film to have on in the background, but one that deserves the viewer's full attention.  Warmly recommended.",1307664000,3,1379,4.943478260869565

762050,5,6304005989,"My favorite Peter Ustinov movie role is in Director Jules Dassin's 1964 comic thriller.

Ustinov won an Academy Award as a hapless small-time black-marketer oblivious to the real scheme of jet-setting thieves Maximilian Schell and Melina Mercouri who plan to steal a priceless, jewel-encrusted dagger from Istanbul's Topkapi museum.  When the authorities nab Ustinov, he agrees to act as a spy in order to thwart the planned robbery.  Eventually, he must choose between saving his own skin and betraying the alluring Mercouri.  Ustinov's marvelously accented, self-serving, sweaty, rumpled, petty, whining, obsequious character is all the more remarkable because it's what he brought to the project and not defined in the screenplay.

The movie is terrific, but one can also argue that Ustinov's fleckless performance alone makes this a must see.  From MGM.  (1964, Not Rated, Widescreen, 120 Minutes))",1283731200,,902,5.492753623188406

Nonetheless, I thought the story of it all was interesting enough to keep one's attention, Peter Ustinov won honors for his performance which, indeed, steals the spotlight from the two others stars of the film, Melina Mercouri and Maximllian Shell.

There is decent photography in here and some good Greek music which plays throughout the film. It gives the movie a unique flavor, something akin to the zither played in ""The Third Man.""",1243900800,2,705,4.915966386554622
762122,5,6304005989,"Connecticut-born, HUAC blacklisted, director-in-exile Jules Dassin of ""Brute Force"" fame pokes fun at his earlier crime caper movie ""Rififi"" (French-1955) with ""Topkapi,"" a leisurely, light-hearted lark about an elaborate crime set in Constantinople in the early 1960s loosely based on an Eric Ambler's novel ""Light of Day.""  ""Topkapi"" qualifies as one of the top ten heist capers of all time.  Mind you, the filmmakers had to abide by the censorship rules of the day which dictated that crime could not pay.  Adroitly, they skirt the issue so that realism never intrudes too serious on their amoral shenanigans.  The actual heist itself is a breath-taking.  Naturally, later filmmakers would imitate it.

Larcenous Elizabeth Lipp (Melina Mercouri of ""Never On Sunday"") must steal a priceless sultan's jewel-encrusted dagger from the Topkapi Palace museum in Istanbul.  She induces a former lover, Walter Harper (Maximilian Schell of ""Avalanche Express""), to plot the operation.  A Swiss native who's the epitome of efficiency and urbanity, Walter lays down several ground rules that he forces Elizabeth to accept.  He demands that their accomplices all be amateurs without criminal records.  Since they have no criminal records, they should be able to elude the world's best policemen.  He stipulates the three cardinal rules of thief.  First, plot meticulously.  Second, execute cleanly.  Third, don't get caught before, during, or afterward.  Indeed, Walter doesn't want anybody with a criminal record as a participant.

The first conspirator that Walter recruits is portly Cedric Page (Robert Morley of ""Beat the Devil"") who is a genius with all things mechanical.  He creates all sorts of toys in his studio, including a cute, little mechanical dog that walks and barks.  He has a facsimile of a parrot that records voices and plays them back.  He explains to Elizabeth and Walter that the museum boasts a complex alarm system.  If you so much as bounce a ping-pong ball on the museum floor, it will trigger their sophisticated alarm system.  Clearly, stealing the dagger cannot be accomplished with the usual smash and grab tactics of conventional crime thriller.

Instead, Walter concocts an intricate plan for entering the museum without touching off the alarms and he brings in a strong man, Hans Fisher (Jess Hahn of ""Bad Man's River""), and an aerial artist Giulio the Human Fly (Gilles Sgal of ""Without Apparent Motive""), who work together in tandem.  Rather than enter the museum in the obvious, ordinary way, the thieves plan to ascend from the roof.  Next, Walter pulls in a con artist, Arthur Simon Simpson (Peter Ustinov), a small potatoes thief who takes advantage of tourists and looks for schmucks.  Elizabeth and Walter hire him to take a Lincoln convertible across the border to Istanbul and leave the keys for a Mrs. Plimpton.  Arthur is likeable enough because he is a bumbling thief.  He is so cretinous that he doesn't even realize that his Egyptian passport has expired so that when he tries to pass through customs, the Turks detain him, point out his expired passport, and then thoroughly search his automobile and discover a dismantled rifle and several grenades.

Initially, they accuse Arthur of being a terrorist, but he convinces them that he hasn't a terrorist bone in his ample torso.  The authorities accept his explanation that he is just ferrying the car across the border, but they still insist that he is part of a terrorist plot to kill their leaders in an important day not far off called Army Day.  The Turkish authorities agree to release Arthur as long as he serves as their informant.  They instruct him in how to pass messages to them without his bosses knowing about his perfidy.  They tell him to hide his messages in a cigarette package that is empty and throw it away as litter and their agents shadowing him in a Volkswagen will retrieve them.  Reluctantly, in over his head more than he could have imagined, Arthur has to go along with their plan.

The beauty of Danischewsky's screenplay is the way she creates obstacles that not only the thieves but also the authorities encounter.  Once Arthur delivers the car, he has no reason to continue as part of Walter's well-thought out scenario.  The authorities refuse to let Cedric drive the car because he is neither the owner nor does he have a driver's license.  Only the owner or a qualified driver, the police explain, can drive the car in Turkey.  Cedric calls on Arthur and Walter has a new knot in his plan that he doesn't like but must unravel for the success of the heist.  The authorities are constantly on the tails of our thieves.  Plans go further awry when Jess tries to get tough with Arthur and Arthur slams Jess's hands in an iron grate, ruining them.  Originally, the heist called for Jess to use his enormous strength to hold the ropes that they planned to use to suspend Giulio from the roof of the museum.  The suspense escalates when Arthur accidentally reveals that the Turks suspect them of being terrorists, not thieves.  Furthermore, the Turks--who keep them under constant surveillance--have taken many photos of them, only to learn that none of these people have a criminal dossier!

Dassin's wife Melina Mercouri toplines a top-drawer cast, including a hilarious Peter Ustinov who received not only the Best Supporting Actor Oscar, but also copped the Golden Laurel award, along with similar Best Supporting Actor Golden Globe nomination.  Scenic and suspenseful and shot on actual locations, this spine-tingling tale about several intrepid thieves is a delight to watch, unless you are afflicted with attention-deficit-syndrome.  Like its intricate crime, ""Topkapi"" spins out a lot of plot in ""Battle of the Sexes"" scenarist Monja Danischewsky's screenplay that adds one character to Ambler's original story and shuffles the others in order of priority.  Nevertheless, you'll quickly understand why Peter Ustinov walks off with top acting honors.  He ushers in hilarity and bolsters the suspense with is dizzy antics.

Director Jules Dassin paces ""Topkapi"" for maximum suspense right up to the last five minutes when you still aren't sure what's going to transpire.  Masterful entertainment with a delightful score by Manos Hadjidakis. The DVD comes only with a trailer.

What can be in that car? The secret police arrest Simpson and double him. [I didn't find it funny.] There are scenes of everyday life in Turkey.

Sightseeing shows more scenes of everyday life. The secret police trail and photograph all the suspects. There is drama and humor in their personal conflicts. Will a mistake ruin their plans? Will Arthur Simpson get a chance at a big score? Will Walter hatch a new plan? The agents are rotated to avoid suspicion. They watch a mass wrestling match exhibition in a stadium.

Like Eartha Kitt, a little of Melina Mercouri goes a long way (even more so a surprisingly unfunny and irritating Akim Tamiroff), but the rest of the cast - which includes Maximilian Schell and Robert Morley - are on good form. Peter Ustinov is a particular delight as local historian, guide and schmo Arthur Simon Simpson, a carbuncle on the backside of humanity the crooks literally rope into being an accomplice in their ingenious high wire jewel robbery. With good location work, gorgeous rich Sixties colour, a catchy score by Manos Hadjidakis and a sense of fun, it has worn a lot better than most of its Sixties contemporaries.

An early ""caper"" film, Topkapi set the standard for the genre, with an interesting plot, a beautiful location (many consider the city of Istanbul to be the star of the film), and a great cast (Peter Ustinov later won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for his role in the film).

Although I purchased it after a (very pleasant) trip to Istanbul as a way to relive that visit, I found myself enjoying every aspect of the film. This is one you turn on and want to keep watching all the way through to the end.

Sadly, Melina Mercouri (1920 - 1994) and Peter Ustinov (1921 - 2004) are no longer with us. This is a great chance to enjoy them as they were in their primes.

Each comedy he plays he gives us the gift of his extraordinary talent as comediant. He is elegant,with thousand faces, ductil, he is a chamaeleon who can play any role he wants. All his misfortunes are ours in this film, achieved through his mastery in acting. I do recommend this film as a must.

762161,5,6304005989,"The 1964 movie Topkapi was based on British novelist Eric Ambler's 1962 best seller ""The Light of Day"".  I am often wary of watching movies of books I have liked but director Jules Dassin has done a terrific job.  He has taken one of Ambler's more lighthearted, almost whimsical, suspense novels and turned it successfully into a lighthearted, funny suspense movie.

The plot is straightforward.  Elizabeth Lipp and Walter Harper (wonderfully played by Melina Mercouri and Maximillian Schell) plan to pull off the heist of a lifetime.  They want to steal a priceless, jewel-encrusted knife and scabbard from the famed Topkapi palace/museum in Istanbul.  Harper realizes that if they are successful the world's police will go after every known jewel thief in the world.  Harper and Lipp decide to recruit non-professionals with useful skills to pull of an ingeniously planned heist.  To that end they recruit Arthur Simpson.  Simpson is something of a part-time con man. Part English and part Egyptian Simpson makes a living hustling tourists in Greece.

As the plot develops Dassin takes us on a grand tour of Istanbul as it looked in the early 1960s.  Dassin and his cinematographers do a great job conveying the sights and sounds of the city.  Although the movie is played for laughs in some respects the planning and execution of the robbery makes for great viewing.  The robbery itself is bold and audacious and Dassin and the cast do a great job in creating a feeling of tense anticipation as the movie reaches its climactic moments.  It should not be a surprise that the creator of the TV series Mission Impossible was inspired by Topkapi.  It may be a surprise to find out that there was a museum robbery in New York six months after Topkapi whose planning and execution was based on the film.

The acting throughout is excellent.  Peter Ustinov won a Best Supporting Actor Academy award for his portrayal of Simpson.  Mercouri was both funny and flirtatious and carried off her role flawlessly.  The great character actor Akim Tamiroff also did a great job playing a the always drunk, raging chef to the jewel thieves.

Topkapi is a fun, lighthearted movie.  It is well worth seeing.

762162,4,6304005989,"18 years ago, I traveled to Turkey, fell in love with the magnificent city of Istanbul, and then searched in vain for videos of this movie, which every guide book mentioned when describing the museum in the exquisite Topkapi palace.  I'm delighted that it's finally available.  Much of the movie was shot on location, and it does as much justice as film can do to the great monuments of that city, as well as its picturesque but ramshackle poor districts.  The wrestling championship that the jewel thieves use as their alibi during the heist was fascinating, and the competitors look like authentic Turkish athletes rather than actors.  The competition seems to be a direct descendant of ancient Greek and Roman athletics, including the athletes' practice of covering their bodies with oil before the contest.

The plot is entertainingly complex, especially because although you see the preparations underway for the heist, you don't know just how they are supposed to work until you see the plans unfold.  So although this movie makes no pretense to be intellectual, it does require you to use your brain in order to follow the plot.  All the performances are wonderful, although frankly, Mercouri was too old for the character she's playing.  The close-ups of her heavily made-up face, unfortunately, tend to undermine her bravura acting.  But Ustinov makes the most of his unprepossessing physique to create a wonderfully comic character as the poor ""shmoe"" caught up in her schemes.  He deserved his Oscar, but I wish there were a prize for best performance by a city.

P.S. -- after seeing this movie, check out the short film ""The Wrong Trousers"" on the DVD ""Wallace and Gromit in Three Amazing Adventures.""  The parody of the jewel heist in Topkapi, complete with jewel thief dangling from a museum ceiling, is priceless.",1147996800,31,1829,4.980263157894737

762164,4,6304005989,"Jules Dassin, talented director banished from the U.S., once again displays his brilliance in the handling of his cast in the Eric Ambler written comic action thriller ""Topkapi"".

A crew masterminded by professional jewel thief Walter Harper played by Maximilian Schell and ably assisted by Elizabeth Lipp played by Mrs. Jules Dassin, Melina Mercouri conspires to steal a fabled emerald encrusted sultan's dagger from the Topkapi museum in Istanbul.  Schell in his cleverly designed scheme, decides to use a team comprised entirely of amateurs.  Included among them in an Oscar winning performance, is dishonest British tour guide working in Greece Arthur Simpson played by the accomplished Peter Ustinov.  Ustinov is used as a dupe initially by Schell's team and in the process alerts Turkish authorities to some strange goings on.  Due to an injury to a circus strongman who is part of the team, the bumbling, acrophobic Ustinov must take his place.  The crew carries out its plans under the noses of authorities who are convinced they are dealing with terrorists and not thieves.

Dassin's cleverly plotted film mixes together equal measures of suspense, intrigue and humor to create an entertaining film.

762168,3,6304005989,"This is in the end a good caper movie and maybe worth watching because its possible a lot its elements have been emulated in other films like the Pink Panther, Mission:Impossible and Entrapment.
It is a jewel theft caper involving a hypersensitive floor security system, where you drop in from the roof. I am not giving anything away that isn't in the trailer. But it is stuff you have now seen many times before. The gymnastics and plotting of how that is carried out is the variance. There is some pretty good tension in pulling off the crime.
As in any movie like this, whether you like it depends a lot more on whether you like the characters. And this is the point where the film gets a little iffy for me. This is the first Melina Mercouri I have seen. So I don't have the perspective of years prior knowing what a great beauty she was. I am going to get in trouble for calling it as I see it her. Melina Mercouri is an attractive enough older woman but well past her prime and trying and failing to hide it behind hair died from silver gray to blonde and heavy mascara and eyeshadow. But perhaps she is merely past her prime and just unapologetic and sassy about it.
The effect is the same. She is a little grotesque. Maximillian Schell on the other hand is a truly handsome and suave as the organizer of the plot.
  Peter Ustinov is cute. As a fairly early role you see him here developing a lot of his most popular affectations that will serve him well in future roles. This production seems a little low budget and doesn't show off his distinctive voice and mannerisms as well as a film with more deft camera direction and better sound can. The stalwart British character actor Robert Morely as the inventor is very good. Also on the team is a brutish strong man who seems to have little purpose in the film who is partnered with an acrobat who cleverly mimes most of his part because he is a mute.
  Ordinarily I don't have much trouble making allowances for the style of films of the various decades but Topkapi has a style that to me seems particularly dated and tips the hand of its minimal budget badly. There are many filler shots of the marketplace and locals of Istanbul that aren't particularly interesting and slow the pace of the film down. Also the image and sound is of marginal quality and frequently dubbed though it is an english speaking film. Its not out of synch but it has that odd unnatural feel to it.  If you mind has the mental alacrity to make allowances for this its a clever enough film to keep you entertained. But I can't imagine anyone under 25 raised on modern production values not being a little antsy and impatient deciphering some of the slightly muffled heavy accents of the international cast.
Certainly a better film than Entrapment. I think overall the film is merely OK. Either of the Ocean's Eleven films does has a more entertaining ensemble cast and are more fun to watch in this genre.",1074384000,10,2939,4.455390334572491
