7985356,5,B00008LUN8,I love this workout!! It is one of my favorites!! I bought this in VHS years and years ago and it was the best exercise tape I have done. When I tried to upgrade to a DVD I literally could not find it anywhere; on the internet or in stores. There were only two carriers of All the Right Moves workout and both were on Amazon. One wanted over $100 for it and the other was the one I got. I think it was used but it works well. I highly recommend trying this workout.,1442102400,,465,3.905263157894737
7985357,5,B00008LUN8,"This workout is great for someone like me who enjoys a combination of yoga, ballet and pilates.  It's really challenging-in a good way.  Yes, she does use props, however I have found some easy substitutions such as a small weight instead of weighted ball and an old broom handle for the bar.",1358812800,,291,4.576923076923077
7985358,4,B00008LUN8,"In ALL THE RIGHT MOVES, instructor Grace Lazenby does a nice job of blending traditional sculpting with other methods, mainly yoga but also a bit of pilates and ballet-type conditioning. Her warm up begins with a focus on breathing and incorporates simple sun salutation moves from yoga. (Note: Grace does not use very good form for the yoga poses, thus some prior familiarity with proper form is helpful, although not necessary.)

Following the warm-up, Grace moves on to standing toning exercises. She uses a body bar for balance (a chair can be substituted), and the moves are similar to what you would do with a ballet barre--fans of Callanetics and/or the Lotte Berk Method will see some similarities here. Grace also uses a weighted ball between her legs; I didn't have one, but I found that the exercises were tough enough without the ball! She performs several sets of each exercise, thoroughly fatiguing the muscles. After these moves, Grace returns to the mat for a yoga warrior series which incorporates many down dog poses.

The workout then moves to the floor, beginning with some light weight work for the chest and shoulders. This is only a short section of the video; the overall focus of this workout is definitely on the lower body. The abs section comes next, and here's where the Pilates moves are woven in: Grace starts with the hundred and also does a variation on the roll up using a dumbell. This abs work was a bit of a disappointment to me, as I didn't feel like my abs got a thorough workout doing the few exercises here.

The remaining floor work which follows focuses on the thighs and glutes, and I found it somewhat similar to Karen Voight's Total Body Toning (minus the fitness ring). The moves are simple to execute, yet the many repetitions make them TOUGH to do--just when you think you must be done, Grace throws in another set. Finally, the tape ends with a ""warm down"" section which provides a nice stretch.

I enjoyed this video: I found the transitions from one method to the next to be smooth and flowing, and the varied workout held my interest. However, at 65 minutes long, I did find the length to be a bit prohibitive.  Grace is a good instructor--encouraging without being overly chatty--although mirrored cuing and proper form would have made this tape even better.  Despite the flaws, if you are looking for a workout that includes a blend of styles and really challenges the lower body with a bit of fun thrown in, check out this DVD!",1155081600,4,2483,4.696551724137931
7985359,3,B00008LUN8,"In febraury, Ms. Lazenby personally emailed me about some new DVds that she was creating. I had initially emailed her to compliment her on All the Right Moves.  So I purchased two workout packages and they never came. When I initially made the order, I emailed them after a couple of weeks and there was a reply.  Then I emailed several more times and no reply.  Now it seems as if her website is not so easy to find anymore, so maybew several people have been screwed over. So I am telling everyone: DO NOT BUY FROM THE WEBSITE IF YOU CAN FIND IT!!!!!!!!",1087776000,4,555,4.3173076923076925
