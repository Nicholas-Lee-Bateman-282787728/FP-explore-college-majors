915128,5,6304653417,"As Judith, Maggie Smith turns in the performance of a lifetime and one

of the best and most complete portrayals by any actor on film. This is

an astonishing film, full of bleak Irish heartbreak, yet with the

promise of hope.

Smith is a no less than a revelation in the title role and one cannot

help but route for this desperate character even when all looks

hopeless. The screenplay had been fought over for years by actresses of

every stripe, with, for a while, Jane Fonda, leading the pack of

actresses trying to get Judith onto the screen. It's a good thing

Maggie Smith won out.

The ensemble cast of actors led by Bob Hoskins is fully up to Smith's

standard and the emotional wallops this movie packs are big ones

indeed.

George Delarue's score is simply perfect underlying with the exact

weight and gravity - and sweetness - of every situation.

When is this thing coming out on DVD? It's simply ridiculous it hasn't

yet appeared.

Highest recommendation.",1115683200,18,976,4.647058823529412
915129,5,6304653417,"Maggie Smith hasn't played the lead for such a long time that part of the  joy of this 1987 British film directed by Jack Clayton is seeing her again.  Based on the wonderful novel by Irish Brian Moore published in 1955, this  project was optioned at various times by Geraldine Page, Katharine Hepburn,  Rachel Roberts and Deborah Kerr but circumstances failed them. Perhaps we  were lucky to have waited for Smith since she is heartbreakingly good as  the aging spinster who has her last chance at romance when she moves into a  Dublin boardinghouse. Smith's large sorrowful dark blue eyes express the  waste of her life and her yearning for happiness yet she is never pathetic,  even when we see her lying about her relationship with American Bob  Hoskins. Their romance is a based on a misunderstanding that you wait to  unravel. I particularly like the scene after Smith has learnt the truth  when she gets progressively drunker and funnier as she talks to a family  who barely tolerate her visits. Hoskins acts with his eyebrows, like a  hyper-Groucho, though strangely his weakness adds a dimension to the  ending. Worth noting are Marie Kean as the landlady, whose smiles conceal  malice; Ian McNeice as her son, a piggy Dylan Thomas; and the lovely music  of Georges Delerue.",960681600,9,1283,4.838709677419355

7876203,5,6304653417,"It's a great film, based on a great novel. But for those of you who have a bad copy - there's a perfect print of it available which has different cover art to the one pictured. That's the one to buy. The film itself could have been written by Alan Bennett, it has the same bleak, but very funny tone to it that his work has. The cast is flawless, it's touching, gorgeously photographed, and it's easily one of Maggie's best performances. At the time it was first released it was criminally neglected because of a legal hitch with the distribution. But now, we can all see it. Marie Keen as the landlady from hell is stunningly good in this, as is Ian Mc. Niece as her hopeless repulsive son. It's very British, very touching, sometimes confronting, and totally wonderful.",1454976000,6,771,4.514285714285714

7876205,5,6304653417,"Set in 1950 Dublin, an aging spinster (Maggie Smith) with a secret drinking problem arrives at a shabby boarding house hoping for a new start. When she meets the landlady's (Marie Kean, BARRY LYNDON) unrefined brother (Bob Hoskins), she fancies he's attracted to her and thinks that she has finally met the man she's been waiting for all her life. But fate has other things in store for her. If asked, most people would probably say THE PRIME OF MISS JEAN BRODIE is Smith's best performance. It's not. It's THE LONELY PASSION OF MISS JUDITH HEARNE. All the actress-y mannerisms that her fans love are absent here. Smith's performance is open and raw and ultimately heartbreaking, a devastating portrait of a desperate woman at the end of her tether, a woman whose illusions and beliefs have been torn from her and who now sees the abyss. Jack Clayton is a director who understands women and several actresses have done some of their very best work under his direction (Simone Signoret, Anne Bancroft, Deborah Kerr) and under his guidance, Smith gives a blistering performance. The subtle score is by Georges Delerue. George Harrison and Elton John are among the producers. With Wendy Hiller and Ian McNiece.

The region 4 DVD from Australia is a nice anamorphic wide screen (1.77) transfer.",1388880000,5,1290,4.890410958904109
7876206,1,6304653417,"The Lonely Passion of Julie Hearne - as Gimlie would say ""you'd find more cheer in a grave yard"" Maggie Smith chews up the scenery in this two hour flick about a lonely, down on her luck alcoholic older lady who wants to get married, to anybody but happens on Bob Hoskins (sp) who is a greedy and only sees her as a means to getting some ready cash. Two hours... two long hours.

The rape scene was fluffed over and that bothered me.",1369612800,,433,4.154761904761905
7876207,5,6304653417,"Having just read the book, the movie provided me with visual  images of the characters, and I was pleased that the movie followed the original storyline fairly closely. Maggie Smith is great in this role as she is a master at portraying subtle emotional changes with her eyes or facial expression.  Much of the story deals with the inner struggles, fears,  longings and misunderstandings of the main characters.  This type of story can be harder to do justice on the screen,  as opposed to one that  has a lot of action moving it along, but I think they did a great job with this one !!",1362787200,6,586,4.481132075471698
7876208,5,6304653417,"Wonderful movie.  It's been a while since I've watched something that made me cry.  This movie certainly did.  What a wonderful portrayal of a woman who had always wanted to be loved, but never had been.  Unless you've felt the pain, you'd never understand the heartache or longing portrayed.  I was right there with her in the church screaming her cries to find God to ask him why. In our weaknesses to fill the empty spaces, we all turn to something to numb the pain.  Maggie Smith is wonderful.  Fantastic performance.",1332547200,7,521,4.65934065934066
7876209,5,6304653417,"-- and one of the most moving.

Smith plays a lonely Irish woman who is struggling with near poverty and a drinking problem, and who relies on her religious faith, and a man she meets, to cope with her life. When her faith and the man seem to be failing her, she has to find strength from within herself.

Don't let this one get away. If a DVD isn't available, get a VHS -- preferably an original one, not one that's been burned onto a DVD. Check the reviews to learn about the quality of the various recordings that are offered.",1245974400,6,529,4.227722772277228
7876210,5,6304653417,"What a great movie, and why it's not on DVD is beyond me. Maggie Smith plays the spinster Judith Hearne, a lonely Dublin woman who's spent her life caring for her sick aunt, seeking refuge in the teachings of the Catholic Church, and when that fails, the bottle. She meets an American Babbitt type (played by Bob Hoskins) who shows her some attention, especially after he learns she's got money. She immediately fancies he's in love with her and she throws herself at him, only to be rebuked. This pushes her off the deep end: she renounces her faith, hits the bottle hard, and ends up in an institution.

Years go by after which Hoskins shows up again and asks Smith to marry him; she realizes it's just for her money now and sends him packing. Her lonely life will remain just that.

Smith is superb as Hearne; in fact, everyone is outstanding. The boarding house in which much of the action takes place is occupied by some of the meanest people you're likely to find. Although most of the action takes place in the present, Hearne's life is revealed to us through an excellent use of flashbacks - just enough to fill us in on her past without detracting from the story. It's a terrific production; I wonder if the loneliness of an aging woman has ever been better captured in a movie. It's poignant and sad - and a magnificent film. Definitely worth a watch. And should be on DVD!!",1133049600,8,1384,4.488095238095238
7876211,5,6304653417,after seeing this movie I said WoW!!! Maggie Smith was excelent in this movie and so was Bob Hoskins.  There were no bad actors in this movie.  For someone who never has seen this check it out. It is one of Maggie Smith's best performances.  The book is excelent as well.,1126915200,11,271,4.2745098039215685
