It seems a rendering from a VHS, somewhat dark and not so clear.",1398297600,,99,4.0
8060428,5,B0009GX1TM,"Los hijos de Sanchez is a real good story that Anthony Quinn, Lupita Ferrer and Dolores del Rio have made. The soundtrack od this movie is excellent as well Chuck Mangione, I recommend  to anyone to buy it.",1322956800,,206,4.421052631578948
8060429,4,B0009GX1TM,"The story of a philanderer who like most mexican men of his generation justify their irresponsible behaviour. His bark is louder than his bite.
Not sure which children are his and which are not, he moves clumsily through his torentious relationships. The winning of a lotto ticket allows him to build a house of his very own giving him the sense that he is now a true man and that all his children are his because he loves them
regardless of blood.",1241913600,3,448,4.475609756097561
8060430,5,B0009GX1TM,"The story was true but it does not represent the case of all Mexican people. The release and music are good.
This was the last film of our great Mexican Diva Dolores del Rio.",1200787200,4,174,4.147058823529412
