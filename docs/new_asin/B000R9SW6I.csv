8199790,5,B000R9SW6I,"I LOVE TO PRACTICE THIS 101 DVD AFTER I FINISH MY 001 DVD. STARTING WITH THE SITTING DOWN IN A FLAT CHAIR IS WHAT YOU NEED TO ALWAYS DO WITH ALL OF DR. CHEN'S SITTING IN A CHAR DVDS. WHEN YOU FINISH THE CHAIR EXERCISES I FIND IT FUN AND SPECIAL TO FOLLOW THEN WITH STANDING UP DR. CHEN FOLLOWING DVDS. 001 & 101, 002 &201. NOW THAT I HAVE BEEN DOING DR.CHEN'S DVDS FOR FOUR YEARS I NOW HAVE ADDED  DR. CHEN;S EXERCISES IN CHAIR AND FOLLOW IT WITH DR. CHEN;S QIGONG FOR BEGINNERS.
I AN AMAZED AT THE MANY, MANY PEOPLE WHO HAVE LOVED WATCHING ME MOVE AND ASK ME TO SHOW THEN HOW TO DO IT. I AM AMAZED AND SAY "" YOU NEED TO BUY DR. CHEN'S DVDS AND START WITH DR. CHEN'S 001 AND 101 AND DR. CHEN'S 002 AND 201. THEY DO AND HAVE FUN DOING IT FOR THEM SELVES AND ARE AMAZED AT HOW MUCH THEY GET RELAXED AND RELEASED.
YOU ALL WILL HAVE FUN WITH DR. CHEN'S DVDS TOO.",1401840000,,858,3.847457627118644
8199791,5,B000R9SW6I,"This DVD is excellent for the purpose intended; for pre-beginners, for those not accustomed to exercise who need to just get their body in motion. It sets the stage for more advanced Tai Chi work if you like low-impact exercise.  It's not for those with some Tai Chi practice experience, it's too basic, but if you need something to get you up off the couch, this is it.  It's brief, it's easy. It's also good for older, more fragile folks.  I recommend this DVD, but only to first-time, absolute beginners.",1285200000,4,507,4.611111111111111
8199792,3,B000R9SW6I,"This tape is okay, but not really worth buying. It's like a very short intro to Tai Chi, the minute you get what going on, it's over.",1240012800,2,133,3.962962962962963
8199793,4,B000R9SW6I,I was under the impression this was for beginners.  I think the instructor should have explained each move before they were done.  Let you know what you were going to do.  Instead he changes and you have to try to figure out what he's doing.,1206316800,2,241,4.311111111111111
8199794,4,B000R9SW6I,I ordered this DVD for my mother who suffers with arthritis.  It is easy for her to do and she is beginning to see some improvement in her mobility. This DVD is a good choice for those who need low/no impact exercise.,1201046400,4,217,4.166666666666667
8199795,4,B000R9SW6I,"For a 66 year old, this is a good 15 minute routine for stretching balance and easy instruction.  Wouldn't recommend for the younger and more agile, but great to keep older bones moving!",1197676800,,186,4.636363636363637
