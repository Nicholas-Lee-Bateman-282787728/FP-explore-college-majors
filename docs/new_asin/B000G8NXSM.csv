8129397,1,B000G8NXSM,"Stan... Yes, you have successfully imparted the most horrific stereotypes imaginable against black family... Nothing short of a propagandist A bomb! I don't fully know your motives, but you can't call this transparent mockery art!... This film is simply hateful propaganda worse than that of the early 20th century depictions of black ""life""... I am surprised no-one else has voiced their utter offense to the garbage he portrays as ""family""...",1258243200,,444,5.357142857142857
8129398,2,B000G8NXSM,"After looking at the back of the DVD and reading 'Rump', I thought this film would be a knock off of Nutty (professor Clump).  I was wrong.  This was an amateur production with the ENTIRE film taking place at the dinner table.  Yes...the entire film.  I was expecting at some point the audience would see the scientist (main character)at work, play or doing a love scene.  But no, all we see is dialogue, dialogue, dialogue.  The discussions at the table (which are with the main characters family) range from healthcare, science and relationships.  There are some funny jokes made from one family member but overall the film remains a the same pace.  A bore.",1199836800,2,659,4.719298245614035
