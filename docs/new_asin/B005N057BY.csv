4841856,4,B005N057BY,"The only reason I didn't give this a five-star rating is that it's not in high-definition: the aspect ratio is 4:3 or ""fullscreen"" rather than the 16:9 ratio used by HD. Otherwise it's excellent: very professional editing by the ESPN producers plus bonus features--the championship celebration after the game, the awarding of the Heisman Trophy to Alabama's Mark Ingram, and a feature called Shortcuts, which are highlight plays in the order in which they occurred during the game. This is a must-have DVD for all Alabama fans. I've been one since Coach Bryant came home from Texas A&M in 1958.",1272672000,5,594,4.95
4841857,5,B005N057BY,"Im an old Alabama boy,it was right nice to see us whoop Texas;and with my DVD I can see it over,and over,and over...",1269216000,7,116,4.086956521739131
4841858,4,B005N057BY,"I was at the game and wanted to see what the live broadcast seen by everyone at home was.  The main problem I have here is that Alabama still won.  (Sorry, I couldn't resist.)  The clarity was not quite what I wanted, and there's a little more edited out than I wanted, but a great game nevertheless.  For Alabama fans, you really need to have this at home.  I've got great Texas games on DVD at home and I'm glad I do.  I AM missing the Cotton Bowl back in the '80's vs. Alabama, but, that's OK.  ""To the victors go the spoils"", so Tide fans, enjoy!",1268352000,5,550,4.08411214953271
4841859,4,B005N057BY,Great picture. Would like it better if it were the combo pack with DVD.  Great football game...  Get to play it for years to come...,1367193600,,132,4.24
4841860,5,B005N057BY,"A must buy!! great quality and no commercials! Buy the 2013 Discover for your collection. Same great quality and don't forget to add ""Nick Saban: Game Changer"". All 3 are excellent! RTR!!",1362441600,,187,4.875
4841861,1,B005N057BY,"I would expect this to look as good or better than the original HD recording.  From a distance the players are blurry and distorted.  The grass is blurry and distorted.  Very disappointing.  I already had this on DVD--this Blu Ray isn't much of an upgrade.

Garbage.",1359504000,,266,4.695652173913044
4841862,5,B005N057BY,"This mixed with 3 other Bama items was the best thing he got for Christmas, except for the SEC Championship tickets!",1356652800,,116,4.571428571428571
4841863,5,B005N057BY,i was reluctant to buy this because i too was unsure about the format.  I went ahead and bought it and it is blu ray and great quality. Just waiting for the 2012 blu ray version now....,1328572800,3,185,4.0
4841864,5,B005N057BY,"The picture and title are bluray.  The details say DVD.  Which is it?  I want to order the bluray.  I am so confused not good.

Ordered and can't wait to watch...

It is bluray, it includes all 152 minutes of the game with chapter breaks at the beginning of the 2nd, 3rd and 4th quarters.  It also has the post-game interview/presentation of crystal.  There is no halftime show if you're into that.  5 stars for Alabama fans, 1 star for anyone else.",1328400000,3,449,4.378048780487805
4841865,5,B005N057BY,This DVD was bought as a gift for a UT fan and close friend.  They were unable to attend the game and wanted a copy to safe.,1313884800,,124,3.5925925925925926
4841866,3,B005N057BY,"Not an excellent master of the game video, but that's not really important to me. This game was fun from the word go, and as the first National Championship for Bama in 19 years, a treasured event for Bama fans. I wish Colt McCoy hadn't gotten hurt early, because there were a lot of sour grapes from some Texas fans and a few others about that. However, he got hurt because he goofed up a play and froze ... it's all part of the game. His replacement did an excellent job in the 3rd quarter and made the game uncomfortably interesting for a while.

It was the culmination of a well coached season and a fitting end for a talented group of players who bought into Saban's coaching style and philosophy. Mark Ingram and Trent Richardson made up a running duo the like of which don't come along very often on one team, and they were as much fun to watch in this game as they had been all year long.

When Texas took the early lead, it was a tense time for Bama fans. By the time the Texas shuffle pass resulted in a Bama TD to end the first half, I felt that the game was over. With long runs, long passes for both sides, and some great defense by Bama when they needed it most, the game was probably more entertaining than the average NC game for non-affiliated fans as well.

Congratulations to Texas for a fine season too. They were a worthy opponent and had a host of talented young men on that team.

I will warn that I docked two stars for the picture quality. The contrast on this picture is ridiculously low ... you may actually have to adjust your TV settings to be able to fully enjoy it. The sharpness of the image reminds you of something recorded on an overused VHS tape.

Still, recommended for collectors of NC game films, and Bama fans in particular.",1312848000,,1764,4.285285285285285

8480067,5,B005N057BY,"Although I'm a Texas fan, it was still a great game. Too bad McCoy got hurt. It would have been an even better game. Credit Alabama-great team also. Video quality is good.",1502323200,,171,4.375

8480073,5,B005N057BY,An excellent edition for any Bama football fan.  A classic involving a staunch Alabama defense accompanied by a pounding ground game only added to the anticipation of returning to college footballs national title lore.  This was the Crimson Tides 13th National Title.  It was both needed and much desired.,1401321600,,305,5.183673469387755
