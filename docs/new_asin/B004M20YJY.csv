8435445,4,B004M20YJY,Beautiful music! Just a little disappointing that all shows are black and white instead of colorful as shown on the disc cover. He was quite an accomplished and talented piano performer! I love to watch his fingers fly over the keys with flair!,1490400000,,244,4.6976744186046515

8435447,2,B004M20YJY,"I wish I had never bought this DVD, it changed my perception of Liberace. I will never enjoy his music again. I cannot imagine anyone agreeing to act in this movie.",1392768000,,164,4.32258064516129
8435448,2,B004M20YJY,Was disappointed with this video.  I thought it might contain some of his show stopping antics and fabulous costumes as performed so brilliantly in his later performances.  This video is worth listening to but not watching.,1364428800,2,223,5.166666666666667
8435449,5,B004M20YJY,"This DVD has highlights of Liberace's 1950's TV show.  Over 3 hours long, I've watched this many times over and can never tire of the Great Liberace!  I highly recommend this DVD to all Liberace fans.",1356134400,7,200,4.527777777777778
8435450,4,B004M20YJY,"Despite the glitzy package photos, this is a collection of the famous LIBERACE B&W TV SHOWS of the 50s - with commercials left in. Not a bad collection, though most of it has been seen before, without commercials, which have a sort of historical life & humor of their own. If you're a collector, though, you won't go wrong at this price.",1336435200,5,337,4.451612903225806
