1904128,4,B0000A5A2P,"GREAT winding down for bed DVD.  The VHS started to show its playing time so we purchased the DVD which has some very good additions. ""Happy Birthday Moon"" is one of the most charming simple young children's movies I have ever seen or read. ""The Paperboy"" is my favorite.  My 3-year-old son seems to like ""Patrick"" even though I always play The Paperboy first. The one exception is entitled ""The Hat"" which does not seem to fit with the other movies innocent charm.  ""The Hat"" contains smoking (a cigar) and guns.  Again, it is just not appropriate. They could have easily found another story...  Anyway, most are great pre-bed movies.  I hope this helps.",1100390400,6,655,4.701754385964913
1904129,4,B0000A5A2P,"THIS DVD IS AMAZING FOR GETTING YOUNG ONES TO SETTLE DOWN AND GET READY FOR BEDTIME. EACH STORY HAS A VERY SOOTHING AND CALMING EFFECT,NOT TO MENTION EACH STORY IS EDUCATIONAL AND COLORFUL. THE ONLY PROBLEM THAT I FOUND WITH THIS DVD IS THE LAST STORY. THE NAME OF THE STORY IS THE HAT. IT IS TOO GRAPHIC FOR ANY CHILD. THERE IS A SCENE WHERE SOLDIERS ARE KILLING EACH OTHER,NOT WHAT I WANT MY DAUGHTER TO REMEMBER AS SHES DRIFTING OFF TO SLEEP.",1094947200,7,445,4.309523809523809
1904130,5,B0000A5A2P,"Bedtime is a difficult time at my house. My 2 year old does not need to sleep.  I purchased this hoping that it had bedtime stories on it that would keep his attention but put him to sleep.  It is wonderful.  Aside from hte wonderful selction of books, the stories are narrated by gentle voices and there is soft lullabye type music in the background.  It has been a real tool in helping our child fall asleep.",1076198400,15,410,4.285714285714286
1904131,5,B0000A5A2P,"A wonderful collection of animated tales based on popular children's books.  I bought this one because Good-Night Gorilla and The Napping House are favorites at home.
In Good-Night Gorilla a small gorilla manages to sneak out of the zoo and takes the other animals with him to the zookeeper's house.  Very true to the original book.
In How Do Dinosaurs Say Goodnight, we learn that they do not fuss and fume and neither should you.  Very interestingly done as the story moves from house to house.
Happy Birthday Moon is about a little bear who decides the Moon must have a birthday and sets out celebrate.  A charming story.
The Napping House is creatively done with stills to show a house where everyone is sleeping and what happens when an awake flea comes by.
Patrick is a wonderful wordless story of a boy/man who buys a fiddle and fills the world with wonder and color.
The Paperboy tells the story of a small boy and how he runs his paper route when the rest of the world is sleeping.  Illustrated with sequential stills to simulate movement.
The Hat is the story of a penniless veteran who comes across a marvelous hat that changes his fortunes around.",1063584000,49,1159,4.606796116504855
1904132,5,B0000A5A2P,"My 2 1/2 yr old son and 3 1/2 yr. old daughter love this dvd.  My daughter loves the gorilla and although the hyenna tends to look like a bear, this dvd does the book well and gets its giggles.  The other stories are winners too, my son loves How Dinosaurs say Good Night.  I recommend this one and if you don't have Where the Wild Things Are, I recommend that one as well.",1062028800,13,373,4.013513513513513
1904143,5,B0000A5A2P,"My 2.5 year old fell in love with this when we checked it out from the library. Now we own it. He requests it almost every day. It was well worth the investment. I don't agree with other reviews that the ""How Dinasours Say Goodnight"" is too scary. My little guy thinks it is funny and it is one of his favorites. He likes all of the stories as they all have something to offer: ""Goonight Gorilla"" has great visuals and subtle humor. ""How Dinasours Say Goodnight"" is clever showing the habits of children at night and how dinasours might act if they were children. ""The Napping House"" has poetry and good humor. ""The Paper Boy"" is beautiful and soothing as told by Forest Whitiker. ""The Violin"" is delightful in music and the visual. ""The Hat"" is an exciting adventure with an ordinary object. You can't miss with this video~!",1207008000,,825,4.506666666666667
1904144,5,B0000A5A2P,"I don't allow my 3 yr old son to watch many videos, movies & tv, but the title story is one of his very favorite picture books - which we turned into great fun with our own colorful keys, little gorilla and animals. We bought this video for him when he was 18 months old, not intending for him to watch it until he was older. But he saw the cover as I was trying to hide it and he instantly recognized the picture on the front and became very excited. At first he would only let us play the title story, completely excited & thrilled to see his favorite in 'motion' - which really encouraged him to talk more, to tell us what he saw or heard. We watch together and the best part is that we've put our own motions to the story & act them out together along with the video & book.

The other stories have now also become very familiar to him & we now have a several books of both these stories and more from the same authors. One night, several months ago, I used the goodnight ritual at the end of 'How Do Dinosaurs Say Goodnight?' when he would not settle & go to bed. He knew the routine, then settled down for sleep & stayed in bed. Wow.

The animations stay true to the books because they use the actual pictures from the books, with music & sounds behind the storytellers & character voices, no moving mouths. If you want exciting stories with slick animation, these aren't for you. These are for quiet time, settling in for nap or bedtime and so are mostly soothing, not too noisy and without a lot of fast moving animation. The videos are older and so production is equal to the time frame when they were made.

While these are calming night time oriented stories, only 2 of the stories are actually about going to bed for the night, 'Goodnight Gorilla' & 'How Do Dinosaurs Say Good Night'. 'Happy Birthday Moon' is a simple illustration of a simple tale of a bear & the moon who share a birthday. 'The Napping House' is about a naptime at grandma's, 'The Paperboy', narrated by Forrest Whitaker, is a quiet story of a paperboy who has to get up while it's still dark out & gets to go back to bed when he's through. 'Patrick' is a fanciful visual story of a man & his magical violin & the hope & joy they bring. There is a piece of classical music used in the story that my son later recognized on our PBS radio station! The last story, 'The Hat' is a wonderful tale of a magic hat that helps bring a man to prosperity & happiness while helping him to help others, then flying away who knows where.
A good video without the fast moving action of most kids movies & shows. I use it now & then to help my boy settle before beginning our bedtime ritual, it's both quietly entertaining & reminding to him of how my little dinosaur should go to bed.",1206057600,2,2750,4.214421252371917
1904145,5,B0000A5A2P,I really enjoy this video as do my two toddlers. It faithfully follows the book and includes charming music. The book and video have little dialog so you don't have the annoyance of listening to someone read the story completely differently than you do. My older daughter (3) likes to watch and narrate the story for her younger brother (19 months). It is a favorite for both of my children.,1203292800,,391,4.6
1904146,5,B0000A5A2P,"This DVD is so great...  I've read Good Night Gorilla to my 2.5 yr-old daughter since she was born, so I wanted to get the DVD.  We discovered the rest of the titles, How Do Dinosaurs Say Good Night, as well as Happy Birthday Moon and The Napping House, three bonus shows (including a great one, The Hat) - and all the titles I've mentioned are so entertaining to our daughter.  We've even bought the Dinosaur book which she absolutely loves, thanks to the DVD!",1203206400,,461,4.4
1904147,5,B0000A5A2P,"I loved this story when my ten year old was a baby.  Now, my one year old loves to watch this video before bed every night while I tell the story to him.  It winds him down just enough to get him ready for bedtime.  Great nightime tradition!!",1186531200,,242,4.0
1904148,5,B0000A5A2P,"Our daughter LOVES books and Goodnight Gorilla has been one of her favourites since she was 6 months old. The story is easy to follow and can become more complex as the child matures. My daughter and I found the Scholastic Goodnight Gorilla video at the local library. We watched it a few times and returned it to the library. However, my daughter would go looking for the video. She wanted to see Goodnight Gorilla along with the two other books on video: Happy Birthday Moon and How Do Dinosaurs Say Goodnight. I highly recommend this video over all others. It is not only pleasing to watch (over and over), but it introduced us to two other great authors: Frank Asch and Jane Yolen. I would always suggest to buy the books first and then buy the video to enhance the experience.",1185062400,2,781,4.507042253521127
1904149,5,B0000A5A2P,"This collection of stories is absolutely wonderful! My son loves every story and asks for each one repeatedly. I can and do watch them over and over again without getting sick of them, and I have my favorites as well (The Hat and Patrick).

'How do Dinosaurs Say Goodnight' is well done visually and the narration by Jane Yolen is excellent. When my son was very small this one was a little scary for him, but later it became a major favorite.

Goodnight Gorilla: Actually works better as an animation than a book (just my opinion). Simply charming.

Happy Birthday Moon: Although I don't really love this one, my son really does and that's all that counts after all.

The Napping House: I didn't think my son would like this one, but he loves it. I love it too. Very soothing, simple and sweet.

The Paper Boy: Magical! The animation is beautiful and the musical score soars with grace and feeling. Forest Whittaker's narration is understated and brilliant.

Patrick: Just Music and animation, but a great story full of joy. The music is brilliant and the animation visually exciting. Love it!

The Hat: A wonderful story full of wit and humor. A magical hat, a good man down on his luck, heroic deeds rewarded, and a happy ending. My favorite!",1176336000,2,1245,4.631818181818182
1904150,5,B0000A5A2P,My son really likes to watch this DVD and does get tired when watching the relaxing stories to put him to sleep. Highly recommend.,1176336000,,130,4.458333333333333
1904151,5,B0000A5A2P,This video is excellent for giving the stories more depth.  Especially good for pairing with the literature itself and don't forget to look at the extra bonus stories.  I'm a special ed teacher and I find them invaluable.  The students ask for them over and over again.,1172361600,,269,4.680851063829787
1904152,5,B0000A5A2P,"We purchased the DVD in March 2006 when our daughter was 1 1/2. She hasn't tired of watching it yet. We have other DVDs including others from the Scholastic Video Collection. This is by far the Best and continues to be the most watched. Our daughter wants to watch every story. For those older parents, who remember Parent's Press Books from the 70's, ""The Hat"" will bring back memories. Highly recommend.",1171670400,,405,4.71830985915493
1904163,4,B0000A5A2P,"My daughter is 2 and loves the quiet tone of the Goodnight Moon, Happy Birthday Moon, and Paperboy. We usually skip the dinosaur one because the creatures are a little scary for her at 2, but would be appropriate for kids a little older who would appreciate the story that is being told. All in all a great DVD with some fine actors lending their voices (Anthony Edwards, Forest Whitaker.)",1169164800,,389,4.571428571428571
1904164,5,B0000A5A2P,"This is one of our twins' favorite bedtime shows.  The collection of animated children's stories is sweet, colorful and creative.  The music is wonderful as well.  This DVD is as good as it gets for our 2 year old girls!",1143158400,,220,4.45
1904165,5,B0000A5A2P,"My daughter absolutely loves the book and got so excited when she saw the characters come alive on the tv. She is always asking for ""Goodnight Gorilla"" when it is time for movie.",1142553600,,178,4.424242424242424
1904166,5,B0000A5A2P,My 1 and 4 year old love to watch this video and really like the story about the gorilla.  Scholastic books on dvd are great addition to parents trying to encourage their kids to read.,1142553600,,184,4.257142857142857
1904167,5,B0000A5A2P,"If you have children from age 18 months to around 5 years, this is the single best bedtime video you will find.  The music is soothing, the narrations are warm, the pacing is slow - everything is designed to hold your toddler's attention while quietly lulling them into a peaceful, sleepy state.

The DVD includes 7 short stories that last from 4.5 ~ 9 minutes each, with the average around 6.5 min.  One nice feature is that, in addition to picking individual stories, you can also select ""Play All"" from the menu and they will all run in succession.  From start to finish, it lasts about 45 minutes, but don't let its brevity keep you from purchasing it.  Honestly, what price can you put on a stress-free transition to bedtime?  And isn't this the kind of video where the object really is to put the viewer to sleep before the end?

Each story is heart-warming, sometimes with a simple lesson and sometimes just simply snooze-inducing.  We got this when our oldest child was just a 18 months and he was captivated by the characters in ""Happy Birthday Moon"", ""Goodnight Gorilla"", and ""The Hat"" from the very start.  He would often request a bedtime video by name (sometimes as a delaying tactic) and it always relaxed him.  As he's grown from toddler to pre-schooler, he connected more with the children in ""How Do Dinosaurs Say Goodnight"" and recognized the humor in ""The Napping House"".

This is a great way for the entire family to wind-down before putting your child(ren) to bed.  In a market flooded with commercialized programming for kids, this is a stand-out in the crowd.  A great tool for parents, a quiet bonding time for families, and a comforting way for little ones to close their eyes and drift away into dreamland.",1134172800,7,1732,4.676567656765677
1904168,5,B0000A5A2P,"Like all the Scholastic videos, this features true-to-book animated versions of good children's stories. ""Good Night Gorilla"" is a favorite book of my son's, and he likes the animated version just as much. Anthony Edwards' narration is pleasantly low-key and that trouble-making gorilla is as cute as in the book.

But for my money, the treasure here is ""How Do Dinosaurs Say Good Night?"" by Jane Yolen. I hadn't been familiar with the book beforehand (although we have it now that it's my son's favorite thing ever). The reading is pitch-perfect -- not surprising, since it's read by the author herself. The animation is elegant and any kid who goes from sweet child to foot-stomping, roaring, throwing, crying monster at bedtime will relate to the children here. Of course, as the author admonishes, ""No.. Dinosaurs don't"" do those things. Dinosaurs ultimately provide model behavior for going to bed, and might even soothe your own savage tot. Even the music is excellent. An outstanding six minutes.

""Happy Birthday Moon"" has wonderful pictures. Personally, I find the story kind of insipid, but my son likes it, so I guess that's good. It's very simple; I guess that's its appeal. ""The Napping House"" is guaranteed to put you to sleep. Its images are charming and the lulling text might just persuade your kid that napping is a good idea. All the stories get repeat viewing (sometimes several times a day) in our house, and that's the sign of an indispensible item. Plus, they're just books set to motion, so even anti-TV parents can't feel too guilty about letting kids watch them.",1131753600,3,1588,4.9216417910447765
1904169,4,B0000A5A2P,"I bought this DVD ages ago and just put it in tonight for the first time (since we've become a TV-on-Fridays-only-family).  I had reservations about letting the little ones (16 months and 3 years old) watch ""The Hat"" based on the reviews I had remembered.

Let me say, I think that ""The Hat"" is outstanding.  Yes, the baby's pram gets set on fire and rolls on down the staircase -- but the magic top hat saves the day.  I often have to remind myself that children are drawn to things that sometimes surprise us by their violence (Grimms' fairy tales, Alice in Wonderland, etc).  But, having said that, I don't find the darker elements in the hat to have much impact.  Rather, I enjoy its whimsy and magic and -- I think -- so did my 3 year old.

The sentient Hat has the power to change people's lives.  Once its magic is unleashed, the Hat can rescue rare birds, save babies, capture criminals, and make people fall in love.  Plus, the Italian setting (although the characters sound Eastern European) is lush and colorful.

I am one who far prefers the moving animation.  The shorts that are simply stills from the text don't do much for me at all (I liked least ""The Napping House""), although my 3 year old boy did seem to like it (well, he liked them all, I'd say).

My 3 year old boy's favorite, I should mention, was the one about How Dinosaurs Go to Bed.  Let me go on record as saying that THIS ONE TOTALLY CREEPS ME OUT!!!  (My son watched it 4 times). In this one, young children appear to be morphed into grotesque and terrifying dinosaurs.  Yes, the soundtrack is lovely lullabies and the point (which I don't fully understand) is that dinosaurs go to bed more pliantly than misbehaving children.  But my son certainly didn't understand the metaphor.  He wanted to know how the dinosaurs got in the house and I'm preparing to intervene in case of any troubling dreams tonight.  I'm pretty sure he won't be having any nightmares because of ""The Hat.""",1131667200,,1960,4.488700564971752
1904170,4,B0000A5A2P,"Since others have ably described what is on the video, I will not repeat, but only add my voice to those that describe Good Night, Gorilla as a mellow, easy-listening sort of children's video.

My only complaint, again like some other reviewers, is that the story of ""The Hat"" is strangely discordant and out of line with the rest of the stories.  Instead of being soft spoken with mellow music, it is loud and 'violent' with fires, shooting, and talk about cannons.  Not something I would have my little ones' introduced to, especially not before bed.

That said, I wouldn't let this one story keep you from buying this wonderful video.",1116201600,2,637,4.711711711711712
1904171,4,B0000A5A2P,"This is a good DVD. While my kids like watching this anytime, we have found it a good video for watching when the day has been too long or the girls are too tired for us to sit down and READ stories. We have also played it LATE at night when someone wakes up and just can't seem to get back to sleep. It is Very calming and soothing. I like most of the Scholastic Video Collection titles.",1111536000,,388,3.9871794871794872
1904172,5,B0000A5A2P,"This is a nice video. It features drawings from a book with a person reading. The lady reading the story is very mellow and calm. This is not a video that will get anyone worked up but rather it is just a nice way to wind down after a long day. My children really enjoy this video.

The stories themselves are great. Good Night Gorilla is adorable with a sense of humor. The Napping House is a favorit book at our house.  Happy Birthday Moon is a sweet story of Bear giving the moon a gift.

I may have a different version of this video however because mine does not have ""the hat"" that several reviewers have discussed in their reviews. My video has Good Night Gorrilla, How Do Dinosaurs go to bed?, The Napping House, Happy Birthday Moon and another short story.

Overall, I would buy this video again. I am looking at buying other Scholastic videos similar to this because they are just so well done.

Enjoy.",1110499200,9,911,4.366863905325443

Thought the voice was too meek for the book, but other than that, a very calming and cute dvd.  definitely old school in the way that they aren't really animated stories, but just a video with pictures of the books & narration.
