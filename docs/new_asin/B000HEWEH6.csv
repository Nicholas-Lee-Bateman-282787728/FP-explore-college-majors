2636964,5,B000HEWEH6,"I have just begun to use this exercise video set but, so far, it has been excellent! It's a great value and the instructor is very encouraging! So far, I am just using two targeted areas for 10 minutes each and they fit into my day very easily. As I progress, I plan to increase my workout time. This is a very motivational program for a reasonable cost!",1462233600,,354,4.220588235294118

2636969,5,B000HEWEH6,"I became a Chris Freytag fan (sorry not sure if that's how you spell her name) when she was on Comcast On Demand. She is motivating but not annoying. I received the 3-2-1 and did the workout the next morning before work in my living room. I told myself if it's too hard I'll only do so many of the circuits. Well I did the whole thing, it was about 45-50 minutes and I had a great sweaty workout. There was only one section where I wasn't crazy about the moves but so what you can always improvise although I didn't. I love the fact that you can pick and choose the sections and they are easily identified on the main menu. Even the warm up and cool down and separate. The nice thing is you can choose ""play all"" and just go with it. I highly recommend these workouts. The next day I did the Belly Butt and Thighs and my butt was really burning. Good workout. That one is about 30 minutes so easy to fit into your day. Plus you can't beat the price. Oh and the bonus sections at the end are really neat too!",1440201600,,1007,4.065326633165829

2636972,5,B000HEWEH6,"Good video - I worked out most of my life, but recently have gotten out of shape. These dvds are gentle enough you don't make you feel worse and they utilize effective familiar moves. Highly recommend.",1427068800,,201,4.611111111111111

2636987,5,B000HEWEH6,"This is a set of two wonderful fitness DVD's that will keep you coming back for more. Chris Freytag's amazing passion for exercising is so contagious that I'm already looking for her other DVD's. The fitness program is very diverse, nicely targets different parts of the body, but her smile, motivation, and constant encouragement while working out is what makes this DVD so much better than others.",1397606400,,399,4.970149253731344
2636988,5,B000HEWEH6,Really enjoyed the 3-2-1 workout.  I like that you have several shorter routines that one that drags on for the entire DVD.,1347494400,,123,4.590909090909091
2636989,4,B000HEWEH6,"The 3-2-1 workout is great for those individuals that get bored easily during a workout. Chris Freytag as designed the workout to do all at once or it can be broken up into smaller portions. It has six circuit intervals each one has 3 minutes of cardio, 2 minutes of strength which weights are needed (I use 3 lb hand weights) & 1 minute of ab work. I like this workout because if I'm too tired to do all 6 intervals I don't have to. I do 3 segments fast forward to the cool down and call it a day.

The Belly, Butt, and Thighs workout is very nice also because Chris Freytag has designed this workout to include a 10 minute segment for the belly, butt and thighs. If you do not have the time or energy to do the entire workout at once you can do one or more segments. After, I do the butt segment my bottom is burning. I just do the butt portion of this workout and I'm tired. Chris uses practical moves that are simple to do, but that are very effective. I have never had a toned tush, butt I do now!",1288051200,,1002,4.035175879396985

2636991,4,B000HEWEH6,"It was a good dvd, but it wasn't quite what I was looking for.  I was looking for more aerobics, this is more of a toning dvd, and a good one if you are looking to tone, not lose weight",1189036800,,185,3.625
