8182371,2,B000NY1EDK,Maybe I got a lemon. The quality of this disc is almost unwatchable. The picture is blurry and the sound is distorted.,1317772800,,118,4.409090909090909
8182372,4,B000NY1EDK,"Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce made 14 Sherlock Holmes pictures over the course of 1939-1946. While one could argue that the four movies featured on this DVD are not necessarily the ""best"" of those 14 movies, it is still a fine collection. Anyone who is a Sherlock Holmes enthusiast would be well rewarded in purchasing this DVD. The affordable price makes it a good buy for a fan who has recently discovered Holmes and is not ready to purchase a full collection of movies.
Spend some time with Basil Rathbone's Holmes; you'll be witnessing THE Holmes for the ages.",1257292800,,565,4.717171717171717

8182376,5,B000NY1EDK,I always enjoy a good Sherlock Holmes movie.  Basil Rathbone is a classic Sherlock Holmes.  He is my favorite next to Ronald Howard in the short series of Sherlock Holmes TV movies made.  Always a must watch.,1201219200,5,208,4.5675675675675675
8182377,4,B000NY1EDK,"Basil Rathbone was an Afrikkaner whose family relocated to Britain when Basil was 3 years old. Rathbone began appearing on stage in 1911, but his acting career was interrupted by war service four years later. Rathbone's first film role was in 1921. He had a somewhat undistinguished career until 1939, when he was fortuitously paired with Nigel Bruce (as Dr. John Watson) in the first of 14 Sherlock Holmes mysteries. The last movie Rathbone acted in was released in 1968, a year after his death (heart attack-- age 75).

CONTENTS

SHERLOCK HOLMES AND THE SECRET WEAPON is curiously set in modern times and involves a bombsight the Allies are trying to keep from the Nazis. All of Doyle's characters are here, including the evil Prof. Moriarity, and none are worse for wear with the half-century time shift.

DRESSED TO KILL is also set in the year of its release, 1946. This last Rathbone/Bruce pairing involves missing Bank of England printing plates, three music boxes and murder.

TERROR BY NIGHT is the tale of a famous diamond stolen while being transported via train from Edinburgh to London. The son of the Star of Rhodesia's owner is murdered, and Holmes has to figure out which of the train's passengers did it.

THE WOMAN IN GREEN is Hillary Brooke (of the Abbott & Costello TV show). The trail of a series of murders leads right to the lady in this story's title.
