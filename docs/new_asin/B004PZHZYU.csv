8437828,5,B004PZHZYU,"Antardwand is based on a true incidents and about a practice that is common in the Bihar and in certain parts of North India : groom kidnapping.  In Indian Cinema we have mainly seen films that have about  focussed on oppression of the female brides because of dowry related issues but this is an novel plot about Pakrauah Shaadi i.e. groom kidnapping that is supposedly rampant even to this day not only in Bihar but many parts of northern India.
This is a very interesting film that talks about reality through some rivetting direction and amazing performances by the cast.
Raghubir ( Raj Singh Chaudhary) is an intelligent young man who is destined for the Indian Administrative services and has his future planned out by his father Vinay Pathak,so much that his parents have also selected the woman that they want him to marry. However the father does not know that the son is in love with another woman and has a baby on the way as well. When the dad refuses to accept this situation, the son walks out on them- but is kidnapped by another father trying to find a suitable groom for his young daughter. The kidnappers attempt at initial coercion fail and they finally resort to brutality and intoxicants to get the groom to do the needful
This is an introduction to another world - the rural India, where men dominate and women play by the rules. After Raghubir is kidnapped he is forced to marry  Akhilendra Mishra's daughter but only after  drugging him and filling him up with alcohol.
The debutant director Sushil Rajpal takes this story and makes it very watchable- what also works is the language and the rural setting, that is beautiful but also very bleak. This is an region of India where lawlessness is widespread and kidnappings is  serious business.
If the first half of the film was about the helplessness of the groom, the second part of the film is about the anguish of the young bride and her attempts to cajole her new husband. Her frustration is palpable but yet she finds understanding in her sister-in-law, a very beautiful Jaya Bhattacharya. The ending of the film is open to our interpretation.
This is a not to be missed film. Five stars. 5/6/2013",1368144000,2,2175,4.668407310704961
8437829,4,B004PZHZYU,"A powerful portrayal of a sad social reality in Bihar and Eastern Uttar Pradesh in India. The movie shows abduction of a highly educated young man who is forced in marriage while tangled in his own relationships with his city girl friend and traditional father. The actors live their roles, movie is paced in a gentle documentary-drama style and the plot is a haunting portral of tragedy, inner conflict and womens' plight. Music, cinematography, ambience are just superb. A must see.",1339718400,,484,4.987654320987654
