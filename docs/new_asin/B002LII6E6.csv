3948248,4,B002LII6E6,"This is an excellent look at the career of the greatest lyricist of all time - Johnny Mercer.  His songs are so much a part of American life from Hooray for Hollywood, You Must Have Been a Beautiful Baby, Jeepers Creepers, One for My Baby and One for the Road, Laura, Autumn Leaves, Glow Worm, Moon River, and Days of Wine and Roses - to name just a few.  He had a way with words that no other lyricist has been able to repeat.  This documentary contains numerous clips of Mercer - who had a great voice - along with other greats such as Sinatra, Nat King Cole, Ella Fitzgerald, Louis Armstrong, and so many others.  You get a good look at Mercer's career.  My only criticism is I would have liked to have known what happened to his wife and son.  Like so many biographies, it did not tie up the loose ends of those important in his life but I would still highly recommend it.",1257638400,29,876,4.2155688622754495
3948249,5,B002LII6E6,"Clint Eastwood gives us a loving and carefully produced look at one the true musical geniuses of the 20th Century. This is as much a celebration of Johnny Mercer's life and music as it is a biography. It plays out like a catalogue of all the great songs, performers and writers that we grew up with. Mr Mercer seems to have had some involvement in virtually every facet of ""The Great American Songbook"" and he excelled in all of them. Most of all this is an enormously enjoyable and entertaining 2 hours that I could watch over and over again. That's what makes this DVD worth buying. You'll want to take it off the shelf and play it regularly.",1257465600,35,644,4.420168067226891
3948250,5,B002LII6E6,"We sat watching the documentary on Turner Classic Movies: ""The Dream's On Me."" The ""dreamer"" was Johnny Mercer, the songwriter whose name has cropped up time and time again in my life whenever I found a song I really loved.

We sat there, stunned to realize how much a part of our lives this Southern gentleman had been. ""Did he write THAT!"" ""My gosh! Was THAT his too?"" ""Wow! I learned 'Jeepers creepers' in the fourth grade!""

""Lazybones"" and ""Day In and Day Out,"" ""I'm An Old Cowhand from the Rio Grande"" and ""That Old Black Magic""--all by the same writer? ""Come Rain or Come Shine"" and ""Autumn Leaves""?

The documentary features great clips by the best singers of the 20th century, vocalizing or playing with Mercer or while he listens: Bing Crosby, the Mills Brothers, Andy Williams, Ella Fitzgerald, Lena Horne, Fred Astaire, Judy Garland (found out something about her we didn't know!), Tony Bennett, Nat ""King"" Cole--on and on.

The documentary follows Mercer's career into the Seventies, when music trends changed and his kind of ballad passed from popularity, and when I no longer learned the words of dozens of songs. More than any other lyricist in the world, Johnny Mercer was the man who gave my generation its love songs. What a debt we owe him!  His tombstone uses yet another of his unforgettable phrases: ""And the Angels Sing.""  Indeed they did.",1257379200,91,1363,4.778723404255319

His daughter only appears for a few seconds of the whole film.  Granted, she is apparently in ill health, but I had hoped she would be able to provide more information.  His son did not appear at all except in old footage.  It's nice that Nancy Gerard was in the film considering she died last year.  Clint Eastwood shamelessly promoted his daughter, but I suppose there is a point to be made from the younger generation learning Mercer's tunes.

The pictures are lovely, and the old footage of Johnny is fun.  And the extra performances on the 2nd CD are interesting, too.",1395187200,,701,4.56

Fred Astaire was right to want to collaborate so much with Johnny Mercer.  I mean Skylark and Moon River, The Days of Wine and Roses, You Smile and the Angels Sing?  Come on....everyone interested in the background of music and Hollywood in the 30's, 40's, 50's, should own this DVD. A chance to see clips of Andy Williams, Dinah Shore, Ray Charles, Bing Crosby, Jack Teagarden, Louis Armstrong, Bing Crosby, Hoagy Carmichael.

3948272,5,B002LII6E6,"Johnny Mercer: The Dream's on Me, is just a wonderful documentary and performance video bringing to the eyes and ears of the viewer the legendary musical accomplishments of one of America's greatest popular song writers.  The beautiful production is a two DVD set, one containing the main documentary and the supplementary one a collection of family photographs and a collection of performances of his most memorable compositions by a diverse array of performers.  Apparently the biographical story of Mercer was originally created as a broadcast television special for the TCM Network, but its so neat to have it to enjoy as a DVD movie which is decidedly worth viewing and enjoying repeatedly.  Johnny Mercer not only enjoyed performing his music,
as a singer, but for a generation was the preferred go to man, as a lyricist, for countless memorable motion picture scores.  The documentary is a well balanced look at Mercer's career, exploring his cultural roots in the deep South, the same stomping ground that also produced Hoagy Carmichael.  Through interviews with some of those who knew him the story of Mercer's life
unfolds and we learn of both his genius and his dependencies.  Clint Eastwood produced the great tribute to Mercer and his
Great American Songbook and serves as on-camera host to notable musicians playing his works. The guests include Eastwood's
daughter, Morgan Eastwood, composer John Williams, singer Jamie Cullum, and many others.  We also see Mercer perform in early television recordings made at the height of his career.  This show is just a terrific reprise of some of the last century's
greatest popular music, and is highly recommended.",1366761600,5,1671,5.162962962962963

3948276,5,B002LII6E6,"[Excerpted from Vocalstandards.com Review]

The life story of an amazing man...

...woven into a superb documentary. In Johnny Mercer: The Dream's on Me Special Edition DVD, Clint Eastwood and Bruce Ricker simply perform magic.

Eastwood and Ricker distill Johnny Mercer's almost unimaginably successful career, and life into an immersive 90 minute ""Mercer Experience"" theme park ride ... rich with the nuance and anecdotes of Johnny's contemporaries and ambient with the music that made Mercer THE singular singer/songwriter of an era.

I'm saying it... So, I think we should get this out of the way right up front ... Johnny Mercer was the best, the absolute best singer/songwriter in the Great American Songbook era (from the '30s to the '70s) and -- in my opinion -- still remains atop the long and distinguished list of great popular standards lyricists.

Johnny may not have written the Great American Songbook single handedly, but he had lots to say in virtually every chapter. Whether swing or jazz; Broadway or Hollywood; waltzes or war ditties; love songs, torch numbers or the blues ... whatever page the book falls open to Mercer is there.

Mercer by the numbers...

I'm not going to regurgitate Johnny's career in this review ... that would sort of defeat the purpose of extolling the virtues of this great documentary and spoil the fun for your watching.

But to give you a sense for how much influence this unassuming, gentleman-poet had in the music we all listen to and love today, just take in some stats from Johnny's career (drawn from ""Johnny Mercer: Southern Songwriter for the World"" - a book by Glenn T. Eskew)...

Mercer wrote/published over 1,500 songs
100 of Johnny's songs became hits
In 13 of those hits we find Johnny singing his own song
4 of the ""Johnny sung"" hits reached #1
In one particular week in 1942 Mercer had 4 songs in top 10 of The Hit Parade!
Johnny collaborated with well over 100 composers (Carmichael, Arlen, Mancini... all the greats)
Mercer wrote music for nearly 400 movies (four... hundred!)
He was nominated for 18 Academy Awards
Won 4 ""Best Song"" Oscars

Oh, and in his spare time he thought it might be cool to start a record company ... he founded a little concern you may have heard of -- Capitol Records. He not only signed and nurtured some of the best talent of the day (Nat King Cole, Peggy Lee...) but was also Capitol's most successful artist for several years selling over 10 Million records.
Johnny Mercer - ""The Dream's on Me""...

All the stats and numbers are great but they only sketch the outline of Johnny's career and just begin to tell his story.  This Turner Classic Movies/Warner Bros. DVD release paints the complete JM picture ... weaving a series of great BBC ""looking back"" interviews Johnny did late in his career with sidebars and song snippets from more than 45 of his contemporaries.

A blend of period interviews from his many composer collaborators, comments from music historians and warm remembrances from a veritable cornucopia of artists -- Fred Astair, Andy Williams, Ella, Frank, Bing, Tony Bennett, Nat, Louis Armstrong, Ray Charles ... far too many to comprehensively list. In the aggregate, the mosaic they paint is one of a genuine and truly unique man with a singular talent for poetic expression, melody and life.

A man like any other...

Like all of us, Johnny had his foibles. He may not have been an alcoholic, but he was a self-admited ""mean drunk"", often warning people in advance to his proclivities. He also apparently kept quite a few florists in business with his signature next morning ""Apology Arrangement"" flower deliveries!

He also had it bad for Judy Garland. They had the worst kept secret affair running for awhile until Johnny's wife stopped by the studio and confronted Judy. Johnny's interest though never waned and many of his great songs like ""Laura"", ""Emily""  and ""I Remember You"" are thought to be the outpouring of Johnny's life long semi-requited love for Judy.

Clint and the production team give appropriate weight to Johnny's imperfections without trying to make the documentary an expos. Likewise they did not go into detail on Johnny's passing in 1976. Sadly, John was taken from us too soon by a brain tumor. He was only 66 and I can't help thinking about the songs we might be hearing out of Diana Krall, Michael Bubl, Steve Tyrell and the rest of the New Guard if we had 20 or so more Mercer years.

The DVD...

This is a pretty straightforward DVD package but Disc 2 does harbor some interesting extra features. Clint briefly interviews John Williams and Jamie Cullum (separately) ""at the piano"", which is pretty neat, and there are two nice photo essays narrated by Mercer's niece.

The first photo essay is a series of family shots that was OK, but it was the second essay I found particularly interesting. Like Tony Bennett (or maybe vice versa) Johnny painted a great deal ... seeing Johnny's creativity expressed in another medium added something extra and unexpected to what I know about the man that was cool.

The best extra feature though are the 10 studio performances. You see significant slices of these performance pieces woven into the mainline of the documentary but here they are rendered complete and some of them are simply stunning. The best of the lot are...

""That Old Black Magic"" (Mercer/Harold Arlen) performed by Jamie Cullum ... just Jamie and his piano
""Laura"" (Mercer/David Raksin) performed by Michael Feinstein with Bucky Pizzarelli on guitar
""Skylark"" (Mercer/Hoagy Carmichael) sung by Maude Maggart with Jamie Cullum on piano (see it on video below)
If you like these new era artists performing Mercer's best, check out the soundtrack LP -- ""Clint Eastwood Presents: Johnny Mercer ""The Dream's On Me"" A Celebration of His Music"" where they roll up the audio from the 10 performance videos on the DVD and add 8 additional numbers.
Overall...

I can't give this DVD enough recommendation props ... If you're reading this piece that means you have some -- probably a lot of -- interest in the American Songbook. Johnny Mercer: The Dream's on Me DVD is MANDATORY viewing.

Even though I've been a Johnny Mercer fan for many years. I still expected to learn some new stuff from watching the DVD. I did, but that's not what I really took away from this cool documentary. It's the additive buildup of pure awe that you get as the 90 minute ""Mercer experience"" washes over you ... the songs, the movies, the collaborations, his talent, his life. It's really too much for any single person to accomplish ... even knowing most of it in advance doesn't blunt the awe (or the fun!).

My wife says ... ""He wrote everything!"" ... after watching this DVD, it's hard to argue with her.",1341792000,7,6732,4.832173913043478

3948289,5,B002LII6E6,"As someone who developed an appreciation of Johnny Mercer via the Philip Furia book ""Skylark"" (why is it so unavailable), this is simply marvelous.

Just a short list of the lyrics Mercer wrote brings up some of the greatest songs ever, Moon River, I'll Remember You, Too Marvelous For Words, Emily, One For My Baby, I Wanna Be Around, Dream, That Old Black Magic.

There are flaws as mentioned by others.  The Lena Horne clips are unwatchable, the mugging she does is pathetic.  So little Sinatra, Judy Garland or Ella Fitzgerald.  Way too much Andy Williams.

But some of the clips are astonishing.  There are three clips from a Merv Griffin show with Fred Astaire, Tony Bennett, Pearl Bailey, and Dinah Shore that are jaw-dropping.  If that entire show exists in some archive, can someone make it available to the general public.  Hearing Mercer and Astaire singing ""Something's Gotta Give"" on that show knocked me off my chair.

I was also amazed at how good Mercer was as a singer.  The clips with him singing solo or with others are fascinating.  There is a non-Mercer song clip in the show, him singing Carmichael's ""Georgia On My Mind"" with Ray Charles.

I also appreciated that the documentary did not gloss over some of the sadder facets of Mercer's life, that his marriage that went bad, his affair with Judy Garland, his drinking problem (he was a very bad drinker, probably an alcoholic).

One point that was not mentioned that was in the Furia book, that Mercer would write multiple versions of lyrics to a song.  It would have been interesting to have someone sing the alternate lyrics he wrote for Moon River.

It is great to watch this on TCM, better to have it on DVD.

Thank you TCM, thank you Clint Eastwood, thank you Johnny Mercer.",1261526400,23,1753,4.676470588235294
3948290,5,B002LII6E6,"With all the crap and garbage on TV these days, thank God for Turner Classic Movies.  They have done it again, with a splendid documentary on the underrated (my opinion) and great song writer, Johnny Mercer.  He wrote an astonishing number of great songs, a few where he wrote the music and lyrics by himself, but mostly writing the lyrics and working with many melody writers, including Harold Arlen, Harry Warren, Richard Whiting, and later, Henry Mancini.
There are some wonderful clips of Johnny with Bing Crosby, Louis Armstrong, Fred Astaire, and many others, and lots of clips of singers perfroming his songs.  Two minor complaints: There was only a brief clip of Sinatra, singing ""One For My Baby""--should have had more of him.  And they chose to show a simply dreadful rendition of ""Day in-Day Out"", ""sung"" by Lena Horne--couldn't they have shown one of Sinatra's versions?
