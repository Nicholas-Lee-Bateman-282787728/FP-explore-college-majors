This story is set in 1864 Missouri, a state torn by violent guerilla warfare. This was followed by the many outlaws in this Border Region during Reconstruction. Miss Jean Shelby rides alone. Sergeant James conducts her to Major Parker. Big Chief White Cloud knows something about Bob Shelby. There is a reward for Quantrill's men. Is Jean a danger? She outwits her guard and escapes to warn her parents and brother Bob. They flee from the Yankee Cavalry. Captain Fred Raymond follows their trail, as does White Cloud (who finds Bob). Jean saves the Captain from Quantrill. What will she do? The Captain agrees to help her. Is it love? White Cloud plans to attack the Shelby's for revenge and loot.

Can Jean (and Raymond) save the Shelby's against a larger force? The Doctor says Jean can recover. Months later she recovers her health. She will hunt White Cloud in revenge. The conversation is slightly comic. Jerry Long and the other men will continue Quantrill's battle. They are wanted men anyway. Jean agrees to help if they will go after White Cloud. Captain Raymond arrives to find Jean gone. Jean offers to marry the man who helps to kill White Cloud. The gang stages many successful robberies. White Cloud's gang is also active. Jean learns of White Cloud's location and asks Jerry's gang to go and get him. They plan an ambush. But there is a new problem now. Jerry brings news of Yankee Cavalry, who are looking for White Cloud and the outlaw gangs. A disagreement among the outlaws is ironed out. ""I reckon so, honey."" Jean takes over. ""What have I done?""

A passing Cavalry troop finds Jean. She doesn't say much, and is brought to the Captain. Will Jean find true love now? Jerry talks a lot. The Cavalry ride to Gilmore to intercept White Cloud's gang. Jean arrives first. Will there be a tragic ending? [This provides a moral ending to resolve the story.]

Overall, this is an average movie that covers the many conflicts in the post-Civil War era. Quantrill's band was composed of the James brothers, the Younger brothers, etc. whose bandit exploits continued until the 1870s. They wound up dead or imprisoned. The movie industry used these conflicts in many westerns. Missouri is west of the river the state is named for.
