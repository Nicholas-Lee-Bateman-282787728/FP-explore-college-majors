4922440,5,B0060QC7ZY,"Such a great series that ended way too soon. Very believable and very well executed stories, duty and personal. I am of the opinion that Dennis Haysbert is truely a fantastic actor with great presense, which is what was needed to give The Unit that extra power and momentum.

I will definately be getting this series, as money permits...",1260144000,7,337,4.711864406779661
4922441,5,B0060QC7ZY,"The Television show ""The Unit"" is well written with outstanding acting. It's a series of stories with a special unit of men who take on tasks for the United States armed forces. Although the stories aren't true, they are acted out with such serious focus and detailed thinking which can be related to actual events that occur with Middle East terrorism. The Unit also includes scenarios of potential nuclear theft and germ warfare with sub-stories that include the wives of these men who can not know their missions as they stay within their homes on base and tackle issues of secrecy about their husbands in everyday life. I recommend these videos for anyone interested in action packed television as well as gaining insight on what actually goes on from the inside perspective of special agents protecting our country. This includes perspective understanding on the party crashers at a recent social White House event. (11/09)",1259625600,65,928,5.032467532467533

4922535,5,B0060QC7ZY,"I love this series. I was disappointed when it was cancelled after 4 seasons. I liked the filming style between the Unit Missions and the family stories. It felt like I was watching two different shows with the same characters. Dennis Haysbert was a much better leader in this series than he was as Senator/President Palmer in 24. Max Martini is a great actor who brings that to 13 Hours as Mark ""Oz"" Geist.",1470268800,4,407,4.513513513513513

4922638,5,B0060QC7ZY,"The first three seasons are awesome.  Everyone who watches these episodes with me has commented on what wonderful things these soldiers are doing - based on the actual doings of a real life operator.  Of course there is plenty of artistic license taken, but military or not; with an interest in the military or not; the acting is great, the charecters are wonderful, and the stories are exciting. It's like Army Wives, Rat Patrol and your favorite who-dunnit drama all rolled up in one program.",1395705600,,494,4.8

4922716,5,B0060QC7ZY,"No effort was spared seeking realism. For my own satisfaction, the actors were well trained by experts. With a very welcome anti-Hollywood philosophy, the bad guys not all the time got what they deserved. That happens in real life too. I wish they had been as realistic in the love scenes: shy on nudity is not my preference. Abby Brammell as Tiffy is marvelous and so seductive. Seeing more of her would have added a lot to her love scenes. All in all, an excellent series, magnificently acted by everybody, especially Dennis Haysbert who steals every scene. The last chapter closed the series in a logical and natural way leaving me wishing for more, which is the sign of artistry at its best. And I felt more patriotic than ever before.",1369612800,,739,4.648854961832061

4922718,5,B0060QC7ZY,"I haven't purchased the series yet. However, I've seen it before and it is a very good show. I agree with most here that this series is one of the all time best and it was sickening when CBS cancelled this great series. I really believe this series could have gone another couple of more seasons, easily. I was hoping another station would pick up the series and was somewhat saddened when that didn't happen either. At one time I did have the series as a gift, but I let a female friend of mine check it out, she fell in love with the show and never give it back. My point is that if you like action, drama, suspense or what have you, anyone will like this series. At the end you will feel like the rest of us; That the series ended or was cancelled prematurely.",1368835200,,763,4.162162162162162

4922733,4,B0060QC7ZY,"The story of our military doing what needs to be done when no one else can.  It kind of lost it's way when the CIA took up arms against them.  As it is true in our or any Government, there are good guys and bad guys.  Sometimes the betrayal comes from someone very close to you, sometimes from a complete stranger.  It is hard to know who you can count on, but the men of the unit have a bond, they know they can count on each other.",1360368000,3,433,3.8863636363636362

I can safely assume that if you're buying this set, you're gonna be watching/using these DVD's often. They packed each season into ONE DVD container. And they did not use good packaging as well. Mine are all ripped and that was just from removing the plastic from the DVDs. The end result from this (and I already read some of u experienced similar issues) one of the DVDs had glue stuck to the playing side. I ordered from the vidiot and I brought this to their attention. The response was quick and they sent me a replacement DVD. Consequently, I have moved all the DVDs to better cases. This is a GREAT series and an even greater deal!.

The only way to really appreciate the intricacies of the multi-season story arc is view the whole four seasons, all the episodes, back to back. Since the series is so widely syndicated, the pricing of the DVD set is attractive.

What a great experience. Better than a lot of full length movies. The Unit ranks up there with Babylon 5, The Wire and The Shield as being some of television's best. The writers did a great job of melding each season together, leaving clues in one season that end up leading to plot twists in a following one. It's too bad it had to end, but at least the writers tied up the story in the last episodes reasonably well, although it would have been nice to know what eventually happened to Molly, Snake Doctor's (Dennis Haysbert) wife. Every time I see an Allstate commercial with Dennis Haysbert, I imagine him clocking some mindless doof after having an auto accident. To me, he'll always be the Snake Doctor.",1333411200,,1083,4.582474226804123

Once she started watching the series with me (and viewing episodes she had never seen) she agreed that this was a good purchase and a great value. It's great to be able to watch The Unit whenever we want to, in sequence. I wasn't a one to just buy a TV series, especially one that is still being broadcast, but this purchase has really changed my mind about that.

4922811,5,B0060QC7ZY,"""The Unit"" is the best military show around.  Not just shoot-em-up stuff, but the real deal when it comes to Special Forces. The whole idea for the series comes from a commander of a Unit who served as an advisor on the set. As a military spouse, I appreciated the real-world view of what it's like to be those who sit home and wait and that the wives weren't ""fluff"" but real people who have a separate life, as it were.

Outer package is great quality and surrounds the four separate season releases.  The long box (picture two DVD cases side-by-side) lends an impressive picture.  My only complaint is you can't sit it on the shelf with all the other DVDs.  We lay ours down on a shelf and that isn't all bad.  I mean ... how awful is it to get a glimpse of Dennis Haysbert and the other guys in the cast, now and then? (Sorry ...

The package from Amazon is beautifully done with a nice cover, 4 DVDs containing all 4 series. I can now watch these DVDs over and over again until I am 50 and not get bored.

The least CBS could have done is allowed one more season to wrap up the story lines.  I agree with another reviewer - the head of CBS that cancelled this is an idiot.  What are they pushing now - Paula Abdul's dancing show?!  Are you kidding me?  Does anyone think that viewers from American Idol are missing Paula so much they'll watch this?

Well-written, well-acted, and reflective of the bravery of the men and women who are unsung heroes, the series starred the amazing Dennis Haysbert as Team Leader Jonas Blaine. We followed the team's exploits through 3 seasons where the show was jerked around from one spot to another before finally ending up after Sunday night football. We never knew when it would start so we had to play with the DVR recording time in order to get it all.

When they canceled it, I felt like telling the head idiot of CBS programming who was responsible for the decision what I thought. The only thing that stopped me was that I didn't know who that might be or what his or her phone number or personal email address was. I had to content myself with posting irate messages on forums with other like-minded people. Why do intelligent, entertaining shows get canceled and crap remains on ad infinitum ad nauseum?

4922872,5,B0060QC7ZY,"This series is awesome. Granted there are some seasons when they just made some weird episodes, probably trying to expand their market. In my opinion, I hated the subplots about the soldiers wives. Pointless. Who are the people watching this show? People who love spec ops. They watered down some episodes to attract a broader viewer base and that weakened the series. Honestly who cares about one of the wives finding an old coin and spending an entire episode on if she should sell it and how she should use the money. Or the episode about the wives staring an investment club and getting involved in a real estate scam. Really that's just lame to force those storylines into a show that is about special forces. But there are plenty of high quality episodes that make it well worth the buy, and it's easy enough to fast forward or skip over the crap. And to get all the seasons in this discounted package is definitely the way to go. If you liked the Bourne movies then you'll love this.

Such his the case here, The Units rating were fine, however foolish network owners are now using other factors to cancel shows Apparently the show was a hit for CBS and Fox didn't like this because they didn't own the show.  This is a disturbing trend that has to STOP. Hello network owners WE THE PEOPLE like the show and want to watch the so cut out your political B.S. and LEAVE ON shows that people want to watch ON THE AIR OK? The bottom line is that greed killed The Unit and several other shows that suddenly disappeared. The producers of The Unit should have done what the producers of JAG did after the first year. Take the show back from the network and find a proper place to air it. The audience IS out there. JAG went on to become a BIG HIT because the producers of the show DID NOT give up on it. To the producers of The Unit (Mr. Military) please consider this option.",1270425600,2,1170,4.246636771300448

4922923,5,B0060QC7ZY,"The Unit in my opinion is one of the most outstanding TV Series ever made. After a slightly slower start in Season 1 it went on to become, through the end of Season 2 and through Seasons 3 and 4, one of the most gripping and well written action series ever produced. For it to be cancelled after only four seasons when it was at it's best was an unfathomable decision. Unlike Galactica which was at it's best through it's first couple of seasons this just kept getting better! ""Go for Blane!""",1267833600,18,492,4.358695652173913
4922924,5,B0060QC7ZY,"This ensemble cast delivers at every turn...after only four seasons, to have CBS (care of Fox Production) cancel it, was frustrating to say the least. I couldn't be more grateful to see the box set offered at such a reasonable price. Now...at the very least I get ""The Unit"" any time I want! Highly recommend investing...I received as a gift and I couldn't be more thrilled!",1267747200,,374,4.681818181818182

4922926,3,B0060QC7ZY,"I found the action sequences and the plot to this series extremely good. The sub plots involving the wives were also pretty watchable.
As a non American it's hard to stomach the ultra patriotism, xenophobia and arrogance that all the main characters display. At times it seemed as if the storyline was a product of Fox News rather than Fox Entertainment.

Overall it's a good watch though. It's just a pity Fox has a habit of cancelling their good shows before they've run their course.",1267315200,4,486,4.7176470588235295

I guess the network Gods feel better about producing more of the same shows they already have then keeping any good and original programming.  The gift set is a great value the complete series in a very nice box.  A definite must for any Unit fan or someone that collects good programming.  Hopefully there will be new box set soon if the networks decide to pick up a season five.",1265414400,4,480,4.184782608695652

4922931,5,B0060QC7ZY,"In response to another reviewer's comment that the Season 3 and 4 discs are of poor quality: I have checked my Season 3 and Season 4 discs, and there is no problem with the quality whatsover. The entire cast of ""The Unit"" is terrific. Ditto the writing. I had been watching rerun episodes on ""Sleuth"" and ""My Tv"", but got super-frustrated because they were not rerun in order (a Season 3 episode one week, a Season 1 episode the next week). Besides,I wanted to have this show available for rewatch the rest of my life! I'm a penny pincher, but I just had to fork over the money for this set! And you save a good bit of money buying the 4-Season Boxed Set,as opposed to buying each season separately.",1264982400,,699,4.384615384615385
4922932,5,B0060QC7ZY,"I bought this entire series as a gift for my wife for Christmas as we enjoyed watching this show on television.  Having gone through the series again, I can say that this is one of the best shows I have ever watched.

The show focuses around the ""Unit"", a secret special forces branch of the army that takes care of any and all military issues around the world.  The second part of the show revolves around the wives of the main characters and how they cope with the secret lives of their husbands.

It is a real shame that this show has been cancelled because it is entertaining, informative, and does a tremendous job with character development.  The first three seasons had long running story lines, but each episode could be watched on its own.  The fourth and final season was put together much more as a serial show, and I enjoyed it most of all.  A great buy if you have any interest in action/drama in your shows.",1264896000,,921,4.414201183431953
