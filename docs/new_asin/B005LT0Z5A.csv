4830205,5,B005LT0Z5A,"Accidents can change people as this beautifully crafted film from Argentina written and directed by Sebastin Borensztein proves. It is a lovely mixture of fantasy (the fantasy is actually based on a true story) and the reality of how immigrants to any country adjust and the need for the kindness of strangers.

The film opens in a beautiful scene in Fucheng, China where a young couple about to marry are on a picturesque little boat in the middle of a river, celebrating their future. Suddenly a cow drops out of the sky, smashes the boat, kills the girl and the young man Jun (Ignacio Huang) survives.

Jump immediately to Buenos Aires where we meet the bitter and methodic Roberto as a lonely owner of a hardware store. Roberto (Ricardo Darn) collects strangely bizarre worldwide happenings he finds in the many newspapers to which he subscribes and pastes them in an album as a hobby. The man who delivers the stack of newspapers has a sister-in-law Mari (Muriel Santa Ana) who has an unrequited love for Roberto, but Roberto is always evasive. One day, while watching the landing of airplanes at the airport, Roberto sees a Chinese lad named Jun being thrown out of a taxi: he helps the man to stand up. Jun does not speak Spanish and shows a tattoo with an address on his arm. Roberto heads to the address of the tattoo with Jun and discover that the place belonged to Jun's uncle that sold it three and half years ago. Roberto goes with Jun to the police station (where Roberto slugs the desk policeman for insisting that Jun spend the night in jail), to the China's embassy and to a Chinese neighborhood to seek out his uncle but it is a fruitless search. Roberto sees the only option is to allow Jun in his house (`for a certain number of days only!') and after a series of incidents, he finds a Chinese take-out delivery boy to translate for Jun.

Roberto explains to Jun through the translator that life is absurd, does not have any sense, and shares his hobby of the news he had collected including one about some men stealing cows in China with a plane and how a group of peasants follows and shoots the plane in flight, the plane's back door is opened, and two cows are dropped, one of them killing a girlfriend in a boat, who happens to be Jun's, as the translator then explains to Roberto. Roberto then shares his childhood reasons for his current worldview and they are dramatic. A series of incidents occurs in which Jun is able to payback the kindness of Roberto, but the major impact is the relationship that forms between Roberto and Jun, a relationship without language communication but with so much more. The small accidental ironies include the Latin American belief that what falls from the sky is usually a sign of good luck, and the final `gift' Jun leaves Roberto is a drawing of a cow's head on the back of Roberto's store - the space Jun ad cleaned for his room and board.

This is a delicate and very tender story and succeeds because of the sterling performances by Ricardo Darn, Ignacio Huang, and Muriel Santa Ana. Perhaps it doesn't `take a village' to make changes, but the reciprocity of two disparate people thrown together by fate certainly does. In Spanish and Chinese with subtitles.

4830207,5,B005LT0Z5A,"I admit that I am a huge fan of Darin based on half a dozen of his earlier films -- but this is undoubtedly the best and he is in practically every frame.  Touching, amusing, nuanced -- just an all-around great film.  Why can't we have more films like this one?  Hope it gets wide release in the U.S. so everyone here can see it.",1331856000,,329,4.030769230769231
4830208,5,B005LT0Z5A,"This is an excellent film with a brilliant Argentinian actor, Ricardo Darn.  It is touching, funny and sad, and very topical.",1329004800,3,125,4.9523809523809526
4830209,5,B005LT0Z5A,I also watched this movie in a flight and loved it. Movies don't have to be complicated or with exaggerated special effects to be funny. I wish it'd be available on amazon.,1326153600,6,172,4.40625
4830210,5,B005LT0Z5A,"I watched this movie coming from Argentina on LAN Airlines.  This movie made me laugh, cry, laugh, and cry again.  I am trying to find a DVD of this movie because I think my mom and dad would really enjoy it.  I want to do more research on the film because the film claimed to be based on a true story.  Some parts of the movie are just too incredible to believe. But, that's what made the movie so good.",1325980800,4,404,4.0125
4830211,5,B005LT0Z5A,"No secret to anybody that Ricardo Darin is one of the finest latin american actors nowadays. So, it's not surprising that here - once more - he plays a great role. Actually, most of the dramatic interest of this movie lies on his character whom he portraits to perfection. What IS surprising is the acting of this chinese young fellow who arrives to Argentina after suffering a most absurd, tragi-comic incident: a cow falling down from the sky kills his girlfriend while rowing in a lake. Later, we'll come to know that this initiating sequence is not a dream or an imaginary situation, but real! (don't worry, I won't give you spoilers).
The relation between the hardware owner and this chinese imigrant looking for a distant relative in Argentinian lands is the heart and soul of this bittersweet story about loneliness and the effects of past extreme situations on our present lives. The story is so simple, so unpretentious and the leading actings so natural and fresh (specially in the case of the japanese youngster) that it soon conquers your reason and your feelings.
Wonderfully directed, true to life and inspiring, this chinese tale is a real MUST. As it does not concern local issues, the film will satisfy viewers from any foreign culture.
Don't miss it: it's a tiny, wonderful piece of jewerly.",1321660800,10,1309,4.848214285714286

8478523,4,B005LT0Z5A,"A unpretentious and witty fable about the nature of a solitary life, the happenstance of a needly Chinese man who speaks no Spanish all, and the hero""s sense of responsibility, under his gruff acceptance of a solitary life. It is a movie about the fact that unlikely events take place  -  the hero collects such material  from the daily newspapers. He believes that life is absurd, till he discovers his capacity for frienhship, and, again by coincidence, love. A pretty fable.",1385596800,,477,4.864197530864198
8478524,5,B005LT0Z5A,"Ricardo Darin demonstrates one more time why he is one of the best Argentinian actors. This movie is delightful and shows an unusual story. He is a very grumpy guy, who finds a Chinese, who is lost and looking for help. The trickiest part is that the Chinese does not speak Spanish, nor Darn speaks Chinese.",1369008000,,307,4.5
8478525,5,B005LT0Z5A,"Not many people can take a weird news story and come up with an idea for a movie based on it. But that is exactly what Sebastian Borensztein did, and the result is truly outstanding. When a freak accident ends with the death of his fiance, Jun decides to leave his country of China and move to Argentina, where his uncle, the only family member left, lives. There things are not easy, he does not speak the language and he starts off on the wrong foot. But he also gets to meet Roberto, a grumpy middle-age man that owns a hardware store and is stuck in life. The quest to find Jun's uncle, while Roberto tries to endure living with this person, and at the same time deal with his inner demons, provides us with plenty of entertainment, laughs aplenty and even a few sad moments.

I have to be honest, the reason I picked this movie was because Ricardo Darin was in it, so imagine my surprise when his performance was at least equaled by the unknown Ignacio Huang. It is hard to have an actor you can't understand move you with his performance, but Huang, in the role of Jun, does just that. Don't get me wrong, Darin is outstanding as always, but Huang's performance was a delightful surprise.

I wish more people are exposed to this film, since I think it has all the elements of a great production and is a true depiction of the quality that you can get from Latin American movies, especially those from Argentina. I will try to do my part and yell about it from the rooftops. Hope you are one of the people I convince to give it a try.",1363305600,,1539,4.303448275862069
8478526,5,B005LT0Z5A,"Saw this movie at the cinema and couldn't wait for it to make it to DVD.  This is worth watching, provided you have no issues with subtitles.",1358380800,,141,4.222222222222222
8478527,5,B005LT0Z5A,"I came across this movie quite by accident while on a return flight from Chile.  I've been a fan of Ricardo Darin for years but had not heard of this 2011 film.  It's a gem.  I'm sure I kept up the coach section with my laughter at 1 a.m..  The story line, the characters, the actors were all simply outstanding.  The plot is highly improbable and wonderfully endearing.  Cannot recommend this film more highly.",1358035200,,411,4.486486486486487
