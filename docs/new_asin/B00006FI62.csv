8216599,5,B00006FI62,"I kept waiting for this to come out in a region one format. I ordered it from Amazon UK a few weeks ago. [I had planned to convert one of my DVD players so I could watch it.]

Although the case is plainly marked region two, it plays on my home DVD player with no problems. I think it must be a region zero disk.

It cost around $16 US. And I used my Amazon.com password and bought it just like I was ordering in the US.

My only complaint is that it is only 55 minutes long. It does have a picture gallery of John Mills and a biography. I would recommend this to anyone who is a Mills fan.",1151366400,9,589,3.8512396694214877
