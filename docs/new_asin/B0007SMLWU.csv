8051168,4,B0007SMLWU,"I have been ""revisiting"" a few of my VHS workouts by Cory Everson -- I sure do wish she'd put some of them on DVD!  Anyway, this workout is led mainly by Michelle LeMay, with Cory providing the ""name brand"" (she is a six-time Ms. Olympia) as well as form pointers, etc.  There is a third exerciser as well, and there is some bantering among them -- especially when Michelle refers to one of the moves as ""sexercises!""  While the workout is definitely dated, it still provides a nice balance of both standing work and floorwork.",1300320000,,527,4.46875
