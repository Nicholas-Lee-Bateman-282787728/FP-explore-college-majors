2676477,5,B000JLTRIG,"I think this is a great season! but, then again I love every Season of Charmed! I think this season is very much worth buying! and hey have you guys noticed that we got the pretty cover this time! I saw a different copy somewhere else I think it was ebay it was a ugly yellow! the cover we have is much prettier! well guys we only have one more season to get and our collection will be complete!",1162339200,7,395,4.012658227848101
2676478,5,B000JLTRIG,"Season 7 is a very interesting year for the world of Charmed. When it is bad, it is REALLY bad but when it is good, it is REALLY good. It really is a hit or miss situation.

The best episodes would have to be the ones near the end of the season but there are also some spread out through the season. Some of the best: Something Wicca This Way Goes, Witchness Protection, Charmed Noir, The Seven Year Witch, Srcy Hard and Death Becomes Them.

The worst episodes: A Call To Arms, The Bare Witch Project, and Once In A Blue Moon.

The Complete Rundown:

1. A Call To Arms - When Piper and Leo attend a Hindu wedding, they become possessed by Hindu gods. This episode is alright, but doesn't seem strong enough to be a season opener.

2. The Bare Witch Project - A student at magic school accidently conjures Lady Godiva, and the sisters must help return her to her time so she can finish her ride. Slightly better than the premiere but still doesn't live up to ""Classic Charmed""

3. Cheaper By The Coven - Chris' wiccaning is upon us and the sister summon Grams for help, but when a spell goes awry, the sisters revert to their teenage selves. Fun episode that brings back favorites like Grams, Patty and Victor.

4. Charrrmed! - A pirate comes to town searching for the fountain of youth. Most people did not like this episode, but I did find it entertaining. Depends on your tastes.

5. Styx Feet Under - The Angel of Death is back after Paige casts a spell that blocks all death. Very well done episode, really good acting here.

6. Once In A Blue Moon - The sisters are transformed into beasts. Bad episode. Really boring.

7. Someone To Witch Over Me - Guardian Angels are being captured. Meanwhile Leo goes on a vision quest. Fans of Drew Fuller will enjoy this because Chris makes an appearance.

8. Charmed Noir - Paige and Angent Brody are trapped in a 40's Noir book. One of the best episodes of the season. Smart, fun and true to the time period.

9. There's Something About Leo - The sisters find out Leo is an avatar and the consequences are dire when Kyle Brody finds out. Interesting episode.

10. Witchness Protection - The Seer is under attack and the sisters reluctantly help her. One of my favorites, Charisma Carpenter is great as the Seer and she finally gets more screen time than in Cheaper By The Coven and Styx Feet Under.

11. Ordinary Witches - Paige takes Kyle back to the past to find out how his parents died. Interesting episode, but more leading up to the next episode/s.

12. Extreme Makeover: World Edition - The sisters are about ready to makeover the world, when Kyle casts a paranoia spell on them. Good episode. Serves as a part one to Charmageddon.

13. Charmageddon - Leo forms an unlikely alliance with Zankou so he can try to reverse the change. Good episode, conclusion to Extreme Makeover: World Edition.

14. Carpe Demon - Drake, an ex-demon, applies for a teaching position at magic school and ends up taking Phoebe on a wild ride around San Francisco as Robin Hood.

15. Show Ghouls - Phoebe and Drake are transported back to 1899, to help find out what happened at a cabaret. Fun episode.

16. The Seven Year Witch - Piper ends up in a coma, Leo loses his memory and tries to find his way back to his family and Cole returns to restore Phoebe's faith in love. GREAT episode, and also features the final appearance of Cole.

17. Scry Hard - Wyatt shrinks Piper and Leo into a dollhouse. Good episode, exciting.

18. Little Box Of Horrors - The sisters must find Pandora's box before someone unleashes the evil inside. Good episode but not as exciting as some episodes before it.

19. Freaky Phoebe - An ugly sorceress switches bodies with Phoebe. Alright episode.

20. Imaginary Fiends - Wyatt's imaginary friend is a demon who is trying to turn him evil. Good episode, also sees the return of Adult Wyatt.

21. Death Becomes Them - Dead innocents from the sisters' past comes back to haunt them, thanks to Zankou. Great episode. Dramatic, emotional and all around good. Also serves as a part 1 to Something Wicca This Way Goes.

22. Something Wicca This Way Goes - The girls finally go after Zankou when he gains control of the Nexus. Great episode. Was originally intended to be both a season finale and a series finale. Conclusion to Death Becomes Them.

As you can see, there are many more good episodes here than bad. There are just as many clunkers here than with any other season, perhaps even less than usual. With the show still up in the air, the finale was intended to be a series finale if necessary, but thankfully we get one final season.

I recommend this to all fans of the show, especially seeing as we are now in the home stretch. 7 down, 1 to go! Enjoy it while it lasts!",1162080000,137,4734,4.455388180764774

2676682,5,B000JLTRIG,"I just finished watching the entire Season 7 of Charmed and I found it to be one of the most entertaining and interesting seasons of the series. This season the Charmed Ones go up against Zankou, an upper level demon whose desire is to gain control of the Nexus and become unstoppable. At the start of this season, emphasis is put on Leo, who has difficulty trusting the elders after the fact that Gideon was an elder and he tried to hurt the Charmed Ones. He is then acquainted with the Avatars, an ancient group of extremely powerful beings who aren't classified as good or evil, but are neutral. They want to create a Utopia where there is no such thing as evil. When Leo and the Charmed Ones join forces with the Avatars, they believe they are making the right decision, but soon figure out that the Avatars will remove anyone who causes conflict from existence. Wanting to stop the Avatars, Leo joins forces with Zankou to undo the change. Leo death shocks the sisters back to reality and they team up with Zankou to stop them. When confronted by the Charmed Ones, the Avatars rewind time back to before the Utopia was created.

With the Avatars gone, focus is put back on Zankou, who finds a way to get the Book of Shadows. He hires a Demon to kill Phoebe's friend Tim right in front of her eyes and works together with an Alchemist to bring Tim and some lost innocents back to life, and with Paige helping her sisters, she leaves her charge unprotected from Zankou. By weakening the sisters by overloading them with guilt, he weakens the Book enough to make it his. With the Book of Shadows finally in his possession, Zankou plans to open the Spiritual Nexus and take in the power of the Shadow. To divert Zankou's attention away from the Nexus, Piper, Phoebe and Paige successfully goad him into coming after them instead. The sisters come to the realization that the only way to stop Zankou may be to sacrifice themselves, but they manage to survive and escape to then meet up with Leo in an attempt to get their lives back, a prelude to the eighth and final season.

Sounds pretty cool huh? At first, I was hesitant to watch Season 7 after reading the mediocre reviews of it on Amazon, but I decided to watch it anyways and I'm glad I did.",1412121600,,2249,4.456310679611651

2676781,5,B000JLTRIG,"This 7th Season prepared me for their 'Final Season' (of which, I just ordered).  I loved all the 'actors/actresses' whether they played the 'good' guys or the 'bad' guys. I loved the fact that these Women )Phoebe, Piper and Paige had taken on each scene 'totally different' from their 1, 2 and 3 seasons.  They were 'sure' of their powers, they 'added' new powers to their 'list'.  They had lovers that became husbands and Piper still loved her hubby.  At times, their lives were 'intense' and 'emotional' but they found themselves and stayed focus and true to their art as ''WITCHES'' do.  They stayed together as 'families' do and helped each other when the going was rough.  I would recommend everyone of 'all ages' to open their mind to a world of magic.",1383004800,,759,4.669172932330827

2676790,5,B000JLTRIG,Normally I can't stand watching anything that's more than 5 years old.  I just don't have the attention for it.  Movies are just so much better now.  Charmed is one of the few exceptions.  It doesn't seem old.  The stories are fun and I enjoy re-watching these episodes with my kids.  We all love Chris!!,1374710400,,304,4.4363636363636365

2676842,5,B000JLTRIG,"Hey fellow Charmed fans;
I only have a question; ""WHAT DOES IT MEAN """"CHARMED THE COMPLETE 7TH SEASON (CHECKPOINT)""""? It also only shows one DVD, definately not enough for a season. Is it like an overall update?",1335657600,,211,4.72972972972973

I love charmed This was a great set of disc charmed season finally will make me cry Paige phoebe piper pure Leo Chris Wyatt forever",1326844800,,143,4.296296296296297
2676864,3,B000JLTRIG,"The seventh season of Charmed fell short.  The story line was a bit scattered.  It seemed like the story arcs were no longer spanning the entire season in order to bring meaning, but each episode stood alone.  I felt that this made the story lack and took a lot of the heart out of the series.  In my opinion, they should have ended the show with Chris being born at the end of season 6.  I bought this season to complete my series collection, but it's not worth it on its own.",1312761600,,477,4.141304347826087
2676865,5,B000JLTRIG,"One of many great shows from the late 90s in my opinion. ""Early Edition"" and ""Charmed"" being two of my favourites. Shows combining everyday life and something supernatural, which I think is an awesome and very entertaining combination. That was a very popular trend in TV shows created between 1995 and 2000 (""Buffy"", ""Angel"" and ""Touched by an Angel"" are other examples of that kind of TV series). For those who don't know what this is all about, it follows three witch sisters living in San Fransisco. They have three different powers (bring time to a standstill, see the future and move objects using only the mind), but (almost) no one except them know they have these powers or know they are witches. They have to use these powers to deal with everything from demons to more regular stuff. You can probably imagine how entertaining it is. I also happen to find Holly Marie Combs and Alyssa Milano VERY HOT! Highly recommended. I have always just really liked the atmosphere in this show.",1310256000,,992,4.7398843930635834

2676873,5,B000JLTRIG,"I watch my videos from the first season to the last, usually a half an episode per day, and when I get to the end, I usually wait a few weeks and start again, though I admit I have begun to be able to recite some of the lines verbatim. I was recording them on television and watching them, but they got to the end too fast, and I did not like being tied to that much recorded television every day. This is ideal.
NO, I am not obsessed. I watch some Charmed each night as part of my unwinding before going to bed. Something very familiar is soothing and routine is helpful in getting to sleep. I teach high school, and though most are really good people, some of my students would not know a positive thought or action if it came up and kissed them on the cheek. These young charmed ladies always end up vanquishing evil in short order, setting me up for a peaceful thought before going to lala land. All the Charmed series videos are fun, and the series lets you see these fictional girls blossom into something strong and good.
I recommend the series.",1265846400,,1052,4.265
2676877,5,B000JLTRIG,I purchased the entire set of charmed. I couldn't stop watching them! One of the best paranormal shows ever,1264723200,,107,4.684210526315789
2676878,5,B000JLTRIG,"for the Charmed Ones and the series as a whole.  Piper, Phoebe and Paige continue in their quest to have a normal life all the while battling demons both physical and their own inner demons.  A special quest from Phoebe's past comes in to ""help"" in an episode.  When one of the Charmed Sisters goes down in the fight, literally.  Leo continues his battle with his own feelins and powers as he's brought into the fold of the group known as the ""Avatars"".  They are out to rid the world of evil completely by remaking it.  He gains new and profound powers while trying to convince the Charmed Ones that this is in their best interest.

That is a task in of itself and Paige meets up with our favorite inspector from the FBI (Kerr Smith) and they hit it off.  He has own interests in this but works together with the Charmed ones through several episodes this season.  I believe that Season 7 is one of the better ones in the Charmed series.  An excellent series in its own rights, i miss this one not being on TV anymore.  But regardless it doesnt change a thing.  I love the Charmed series without question.",1263168000,3,1106,4.367647058823529

Contrary to the item listing, the set IS, obviously, closed captioned. The captions are fair, overall--some deletions, and some music seems to be kind of forgotten at times.",1221264000,,342,4.813559322033898

2677004,5,B000JLTRIG,"CHAMRED: Season Seven=Seven Year Witch. Just kidding. That's just my way of introducing CHARMED: The Complete Seventh Season. This is season, just like the first six seasons, is jam packed with more intense storylines. But those intense storylines can't seem to get the best of THE CHARMED ONES. PIPER (again played by Holly Marie Combs), PHOEBE (again played by Alyssa Milano), & PAIGE (again played by Rose McGowan) are back for a seventh round of defeating demons, warlocks, and many more.

""A Call to Arms""

Reeling from the loss of their future son Chris, an overprotective Piper and Barbas-obsessed Leo are forced by Phoebe and Paige to attend a Hindu wedding, where they inadvertently receive the powers of the Hindu's Ultimate Lovers, Shakti, the Goddess of Creation and her lover, Shiva, the God of Destruction.

 ""The Bare Witch Project""

Paige almost loses her fight to save Magic School when a bored student accidentally conjures Lady Godiva and Lord Dyson, a demonic land baron who feeds off humans' repressed emotions.

 ""Cheaper by the Coven""

Against Piper's wishes, Paige and Phoebe summon Grams for Chris's wiccaning. To put an end to the brother's sibling rivalry, Grams puts a spell on them, but in the process turns the sisters back to bickering teenagers.

 ""Charrrmed!""

On a search to find witches who have been disappearing, Paige encounters Captain Black Jack Cutting, an infamous 18th century pirate who is searching for the Fountain of Youth to reverse a curse that causes him to age but never die.

 ""Styx Feet Under""

When a demon, Sirk, tries to destroy his human half by killing off his remaining blood relatives, Paige casts a spell that inadvertently blocks all death from occurring. Annoyed that he now has a back-log of work, the Angel of Death insists that the Charmed Ones help him clean up the mess and ""kills"" Piper so she can help him restore the Grand Design.

 ""Once in a Blue Moon""

The Elders' suspicion of Leo causes them to assign a new Whitelighter to the girls. However, when the new Whitelighter is nearly killed by beasts, the Elders blame the attack on Leo. Trying to prove Leo's innocence, Piper, Phoebe and Paige discover that the beasts are actually the Charmed Ones' themselves, transformed by a blue moon.

 ""Someone to Witch Over Me""

Agent Brody convinces Paige to help him solve a mysterious string of accidents, only to discover that the demon Sarpedon is capturing innocents' Guardian angels and using them to protect himself from the forthcoming threat of a New Power.

 ""Charmed Noir""

While investigating a murder at Magic School, Paige and Agent Brody are sucked into an unfinished novel written twenty years ago by two students. They suddenly find themselves in a 1930s film noir, where they are chased by gangsters in pursuit of the famed Burmese Falcon.

 ""There's Something About Leo""

Leo reveals to Piper that he is an Avatar, despite the warnings from Alpha and Beta that Piper should find out in her own time. Phoebe and Paige call on Kyle for help, but his reaction to the news causes disastrous results.

 ""Witchness Protection""

The Avatars insist that Leo protect the Seer because she has information that can help them destroy the demons. The Seer shares with Phoebe a vision of a future in which there are no demons, leading the sisters to consider the possibility that the Avatars might be good and allowing Leo the opportunity to admit he is an Avatar.

 ""Ordinary Witches""

Still not completely sure that the Avatars mean well, Piper agrees to switch powers with Phoebe so that she too can see Phoebe's premonition of a Utopian world. During the spell, Zankou, the most powerful demon in the underworld, senses the girls' vulnerability and attacks them, accidentally transferring their powers to innocent bystanders, who run amok with their new abilities.

 ""Extreme Makeover: World Edition""

While the Avatars prepare to transform the world into a Utopia, they inform the Charmed Ones that the human world must be put to sleep so that they can kill any remaining demons. Brody, doubting the Avatars good intentions, calls the Elders for help but is instead kidnapped by Zankou and agrees to help Zankou stop the change by placing a paranoia spell on Piper, Phoebe and Paige. During the Utopian transformation, Brody uses Paige's paranoia to attract and kill an Avatar. However, Brody pays a high price for his actions.

 ""Charmageddon""

While the Charmed Ones enjoy their new conflict-free world, Leo learns that in order for the Avatars to protect their Utopian world, they also control everyone's destiny by deciding who lives and dies. Wanting to stop the Avatars, Leo joins forces with Zankou to undo the change. Paige receives a special surprise and Leo's fate relies on the Elders.

 ""Carpe Demon""

When Paige attempts to hire a new professor for Magic School, she learns that one of the candidates, Drake, is an ex-demon who made a deal with a demonic Sorcerer to become human.

 ""Show Ghouls""

When Darryl fears his friend Mike is possessed, Phoebe, Paige and Drake discover that Mike had been working close to a site where a cabaret was destroyed in a fire in 1899, killing hundreds of people. The spirit of one of the victims is using Mike to plead for help on behalf of all the Lost Souls who are trapped in the cabaret, forced to relive that night for eternity.

 ""The Seven Year Witch""

Already stressed out awaiting word on Leo's fate, Piper is attacked by demons and ends up in a coma. Stuck in the cosmic void between life and death, Piper's spirit is surprised to find Cole waiting for her and even more surprised when he tells her that he is there to help keep her and Leo together, which he hopes will restore Phoebe's faith in love.

 ""Scry Hard ""

Zankou sends his underlings to attack Leo in hopes of luring the sisters out of their house so that he can search for the Nexus and release the Shadow, the ultimate power. Terrified after witnessing demons attack his parents, Wyatt magically shrinks Piper and Leo and traps them inside a dollhouse for their protection.

 ""Little Box of Horrors""

The Charmed Ones are in a race against time when the mythological Pandora's Box falls into the hands of Katya, a shapeshifting demon who intends to open the box and fill the world with all of its sorrows. Phoebe and Piper try to find Hope, the Guardian who can return any released evil spirits to the box.

 ""Freaky Phoebe""

After a spell is cast on Phoebe by the power-hungry sorceress Imara, their souls switch bodies and Phoebe ends up becoming trapped in a cage.

 ""Imaginary Fiends""

Unbeknownst to the Charmed Ones, baby Wyatt's new ""imaginary"" friend is actually the demon Vicus, who is trying to win Wyatt's trust to turn him evil. Piper casts a spell to be able to understand baby Wyatt, but inadvertently brings 25-year-old Wyatt back from the future.

 ""Death Becomes Them""

Zankou's plan to make the sisters vulnerable so that he can take control of the Book of Shadows starts to work when Phoebe is left guilt-ridden after a classmate is brutally killed in front of her and comes back from the dead to blame her. Also part of Zankou's plan, Paige is devastated when she finds her new charge dead and realizes she was powerless to save her.

 ""Something Wicca This Way Goes""

With the Book of Shadows finally in his possession, Zankou plans to open the Spiritual Nexus and take in the power of the Shadow. To divert Zankou's attention away from the Nexus, Piper, Phoebe and Paige successfully goad him into coming after them instead. The sisters come to the realization that the only way to stop Zankou may be to sacrifice themselves.

Also, the small circular tabs that hold the center of the DVD have arrived broken in pretty much every season, on every disk. This varies from 3-4 tabs to almost all of them.",1173312000,,347,4.2727272727272725
2677092,3,B000JLTRIG,"I've loved Charmed ever since it first came out. On the other hand the sisters were all very discontent with having to ""save the world"" and their powers. When before it's always been about be who you are. Then again everyone gets tired of just being themselves every once in a while. Anyway, it's still Charmed, that didn't change.",1173312000,,331,4.627118644067797
2677105,4,B000JLTRIG,"This season is the culmination of several seasons' hints and story lines.  We finally see Utopia, learn about the Avatars, and the girls finally get a break in the end.  I had to knock 1 star off my rating because the ending of this season made me extremely angry and apprehensive when it first aired.  I vowed that if the ""Charmed Ones"" were going to remain in those young, twenty-something bodies, that Charmed had lost a lot of loyal fans including myself.  I was relieved when the girls I knew returned in the next season.  Another reason this season is only ""almost perfect"" is that I simply miss Chris.  I couldn't stand him at first, but by the time he ""died"", he was part of the family.

If a spin-off ever occurred, my vote would be setting it about 20 years in the future and feature Wyatt, Chris and the other 7 Charmed children.",1172275200,,840,4.415584415584416
2677106,5,B000JLTRIG,"Not the best season of Charmed nor the Worse. After the events of last season Leo's lost his direction and beings seeing talking heads. I liked the build up to the Avators not sure if they were good or evil. The Charmed Ones originally being against them then working with them to bring about Utopia only to realize its not what they want. I like that Piper, Pboebe and Paige come to the realization and chose to go back to the normal good vs. evil world by teaming up with the demons. It was fun to see them all on one side. Phoebe and Paige each find a love interest in Les and Kyle but neither romance was that interesting. Billy Zane was an exciting addition for three epsoides. I wish they had him on longer. I liked Zankou, he was a very good demon and had the Charmed Ones on the run ending in the wonderful season finale in Something Wicca Goes This Way. Other good epsoides were Carpe Demon, Cheaper By the Dozen, and Charmed Noir.",1171929600,4,940,4.286516853932584
2677107,4,B000JLTRIG,"After the stagnant and lackluster season 6 I was reluctant to pick up what I believed to be the final season.  As a result of season 6 many long-time fans jumped ship and really didn't care if the show floundered and sank.  This is really a shame as season 7 picks up a gust of magical wind and sails the show off into the sunset on a strong current of good shows.  The first half of the season deals with the Avatars and is basically a through story with many different character dimensions that were absent in season 6.  This slow burn lasts until the story is resolved.  After this the show seems a bit directionless, but with the help of a riotous Billy Zane for a few shows ""Charmed"" regains the humor of those hilarious early years.  There is even one great scene where he dances with Phoebe while dressed up as Gene Kelly from ""Singin' in the Rain.""  Great stuff!  There is even a surprise cameo appearance by one of the former cast members during one episode (no, I won't spoil who re-appears) that had me smiling a bit.  The final episodes attempt to bring closure to the story while leaving a hopeful ""out"" for a possible future return of the Charmed Ones.  Recommended.  (Final Note: I heard a rumor that there is a season 8?  Season 7 wraps everything up into a tidy bundle, so it would be hard to imagine where the show could go from here, anyway.)",1171497600,5,1361,4.357142857142857
2677108,5,B000JLTRIG,"I have watched all the Seasons On TNT. in the morning and in the evening and I love all of them. I don't dislike this Season but my Favorite Seasons are 4,5,6, and the last Season witch is Season 8.the Only thing i never liked about the last season is when they make Billie out to be a bad witch. Does any One know when Season 8 is coming out on DVD.",1171497600,3,350,3.875
2677109,4,B000JLTRIG,"This is not the best season of Charmed, but I preferred it to season 5 and 6, which I thought were a little on the boring side. That may be because I prefer the darker story lines and here we had a revival of some of the darker themes of the Charmed mythology.

I enjoyed watching Leo's inner conflict with the elders, his grappling with his inner deamons, namely anger and revenge, and the chasing of the dream of a world without the good and evil polarity. Great to see him and the sisters eventually realize that the tensions between good and evil is linked to free will and that a world without free will, however peaceful on the surface, is actually worst than the ills the utopian dream proclaimed to cure.

The episodes after the dismantelling of Utopia and the leaving of the avatars were not particularly riveting and could have been better. The story itself was good: the demonic world with a new leader attempts to take hold of the Nexus and Book of shadows, almost defeating the Charmed ones for good. These could have been great episodes if the leader of the underworld had been a bit more convincing. This chief deamon however did not have much of an edge...nothing compared to the charisma we encountered say in the first Source or even better in the Cole/Baltazar deamon of season 4. I have missed Cole since season 4, he was such a great character, which, by the way, makes a short guest appearance in ""the seventh year witch"" episode in this season.

All in all however, this was a good season and I had fun watching it...and the twist at the end is pretty neat(which I will not reveal, just in case you have not watched it yet, as it would spoil your fun). I am looking forward to see how the last season will be played out given this last development.",1171324800,5,1771,4.443076923076923
2677110,2,B000JLTRIG,Ive seen a bunch of this season on TV and I don't have this dvd yet but season 7 was pretty darn dull. I found that the avatars and Zankou were on the show way too long. If you found that Cole was a good character but wasted a lot of show space with all of his problems then the avatars and Zankou will have the same effect. Great show iffy season.,1171238400,3,348,3.8472222222222223
2677111,5,B000JLTRIG,I loved it! I just wonder if any of these will ever come out on High definition? like HD DVD or Blu-ray dvds? It would be awesome!! Can't wait for the 8th season!!!,1171065600,,164,4.0
2677112,5,B000JLTRIG,"I've read some negative reviews of Season 7, but I have to say it's one of my favorites.  After a lot of lighter, more comedic episodes in seasons 5 and 6, Season 7 returned the series to the darker glory days of seasons 3 and 4.  I loved the story arcs in the season, and the writing and direction were dead on.

Season 7 picks up where season 6 ended; adult Chris is dead and Leo can't stop grieving and move on.  As his marriage to Piper continues to fall apart he is courted (in rather strange fashion) by Avatars (we saw them in Season 5 in the episode ""Sam I Am,"" where Paige is reunited with her real father, Sam)to change the world and end the struggle between good and evil.  Woven into this storyline are Paige's romance with the Avatar-obsessed Agent Brody (Kerr Smith) and Phoebe's romance with Les (Nick Lachey) and her sabbatical to find herself.  The Avatar story only lasted half the season but segued nicely into the rise of Zankou.  As Zankour terrorizes the sisters during the final half of the season in his quest for the Book of Shadows and the Nexus, Phoebe has a romance with an ex-demon and returns to school.  Paige decides running magic school isn't for her; she passes the baton to a newly mortal Leo and is thrust into double duty as a witch and a whitelighter.  Piper, after nearly dying, tries to rework her marriage to Leo, who gives up his powers to be with his family.",1170806400,19,1401,4.378378378378378

But I know that some episodes were good and I can't wait to buy this. I am glad that they finall have seasons 1-7 on dvd after so many years of it being on.,1170806400,,449,3.838709677419355
2677114,2,B000JLTRIG,"I must admit,season 7 was perhaps the worst of the post Shannon Dougherty years. After hitting a creative peak in seasons four and five.(Season six despite the negative reviews was a solid season.)The series seemingly hit a wall in season seven. I honestly believe (sorry Charmed Fans) that 7 & 8 should have been combined to form one great final season instead of a bad season and a mediocre one.

UPDATE:Season 8 is slated to come out during September 2007,but the music (including the theme song) will be changed. I recently found out that budget cuts caused Daryl and Leo's disappearance (well Leo's semi-disappearance!) but can someone explain Billie & Christy to me? Their addition to the storyline...uh,yuck!

It wasn't supposed to show Wicca in a good light or a bad light or even a remotely correct light - it was just a clever metaphor for the relationship between the sisters, which was the real point of the series. It was supposed to be sappy and corny at times. It was supposed to be like a soap opera. I never loved Rose McGowan as Paige, but, to be truthful, I never liked Shannon Dougherty as Prue that much either. I always enjoyed watching until Billie joined in the last season. How could it be that a witch, not related to the Charmed Ones, is more powerful than they? If so, why were they even called the Charmed Ones in the first place? That is why this seventh season should have been the final one. I thought that the plots in season eight were at times more powerful and clever than season seven, but Billie's antics just got in the way of enjoying it. Plus, the season seven finale did such a good job of wrapping everything up it just seemed like an appropriate place to end the series.

Season seven is definitely much better than season six. It seemed like Charmed drifted for a season and a half after Cole's death in the middle of season five since the show had so much invested in that storyline, but here they are back on track. Being an ""Angel"" fan, I particularly liked Charisma Carpenter's guest appearances, even if she does come across like the Buffy-era Cordelia except with magical powers. I also liked ""Cheaper by the Coven"" where the sisters revert to their teenage personas and Wyatt creates a demon in the image of his dad because he feels like it is his fault that Leo isn't around and Gideon is dead. It shows just how much the parents' relationship affects their children, and also how much parents don't realize that their interactions with each other affect their children. This episode sees Piper and Leo putting aside their differences to help their son, and it was really great to see that again. Overall, highly recommended.",1168819200,29,2142,4.549222797927461

2677133,5,B000JLTRIG,"I just wanted to say that Charmed was and still is my favorite TV show.  I was upset to see that it ended so soon and to find out that 7th Heaven is still going.  I really wish that they continued it for a couple more seasons to see Phoebe and Paige have children of their own.  I found that I liked Charmed a lot better once they got rid of a certain actress.  I hope they decide to start it up again, but I doubt it.  I liked Charmed so much because it gave me an escape of reality for a while.  It gave me a break and I really go into it!

2677134,5,B000JLTRIG,"While this may not be the BEST Season of Charmed, it definitally is up in the top 3.... The only regret that I have is that, like all the other Season released so far, there won't be extra's on it.... It looks like we'll have to wait for the 8th and final Season to be released to get those.... Hopefully we won't have to wait too long for that....",1163894400,21,348,4.057971014492754

8151904,5,B000JLTRIG,"Of course, this show has had so many great or ultimate powers, you may need a scorecard. This time, the next ultimate threat comes from a storyline started in Season 5, and fleshed out more here--the Avatars. Trying to recruit Leo to build their ""utopia."" A world without conflict--sounds like a nice idea, until you realize Utopia comes without freewill.

And then, there's Zankou, another threat to the old Source, who gets freed and becomes another great enemy--once again trying to vanquish the sisters. Not the final battle--obviously--but a lot of allusions to themes from the past & the return of a few familiar faces (The Angel of Death).

Looking forward to the final year--magic number 8....",1507593600,,701,4.982905982905983
