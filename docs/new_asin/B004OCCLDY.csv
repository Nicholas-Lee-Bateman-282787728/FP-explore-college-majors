4438431,5,B004OCCLDY,"This is one of those movies that if you are going to watch it, you already know you're going to see something over the top. That's why I liked it.",1367452800,4,146,3.9
4438432,3,B004OCCLDY,Yep I watched it the story was true to its description however B B B- Grade mmm yep wet winter day time killer I almost cracked a smile but yep. If you like it its up to you,1323388800,,173,3.5789473684210527
4438433,3,B004OCCLDY,"Normally I'd say: [Folks, brace yourselves.  These Tokyo Shocklets tend to have all the subtlety of a Thai whorehouse.  There are so many scenes in these movies where you put on a big smile and think ""that makes absolutely no sense"" and love it!]  This made me smile, but way less than most movies of such ilk.  All in all, this was a disappointing and shockless Tokyo Shocker.  It falls short of the goretastic silliness of its predecessors. It'll provoke a few ridiculous laughs, but you may not have the patience to watch the whole thing.

 This one opens with some manner of casino, fight club, BDSM den where our star has come to execute the dome-y den mother for her sins.  Naturally, everyone in the club is armed, on the boss lady's payroll, and will fight to the death to defend her.  I don't know why she needs protecting, though.  I mean, she's a master of two-bladed skull-sword-thingy style.  Our ""Lolita"" starlet, Yuki, is armed with an umbrella-spear and wears some sexy Hot Topic leather boots.

 Yuki's father is a wheelchair-bound Catholic priest who helps her avenge her mother's death.  How?  By ripping off Whistler from Blade.  You see, Yuki is killing off members of a caped cadre of baddies that killed mom and crippled dad.  The second baddie is apparently a perverted chemistry teacher.  His fighting style: Telekinetic Seated Mop!  After him, it's a one-eyed schoolgirl-chic-ette with bladed pistols and a sunny disposition.

 By now you're probably wondering where the ""Psycho"" demon-hybrid chick from the DVD cover is going to show up.  Bummer alert!  Not `til the end.

 For the subgenre, I quickly noticed that the martial arts in this are about as good as they get in this subgenre--which isn't great.  But the gore and villains are noticeably less innovating.  Compared to Tokyo Gore Police this falls short by about 100 gallons of arterial spray and 100 pounds of rubber guts and disembodied limbs.  There were also no goofy prosthetics until the final demon scene.  All in all, this was a disappointing Tokyo Shocker.",1319155200,3,2052,4.8328530259366
4438434,4,B004OCCLDY,"I watched this and it was basically 50/50. The Whole idea of a gothic lolita with an umbrella as a deadly weapon is actually pretty cool. The Action sequences were cool, but the two flaws in this move was that it only had some bloody moments and the story sometimes leaves questions unanswered. But this movie was designed to confuse you. Even though it didn't make a big budget, I still thought it was a pretty decent movie for those who love japanese b-horror films, like ""Tokyo gore police"", ""The machine girl"" and ""Vampire girl vs. frankenstein girl"", and it was still fun to watch. It's not exactly the WORST film ever but it was all right. That's why this movie is 50/50.",1312848000,,677,4.512195121951219
4438435,2,B004OCCLDY,"I found this inferior to Machine Girl, Tokyo Gore police, and Vampire Girl. The budget is obviously much smaller than those three and there is almost no story to speak of. It basically a sequence of five fight scenes. For hardcore fans of this genre only.",1311897600,2,255,4.565217391304348
4438436,4,B004OCCLDY,"Psycho Gothic Loita  has the best beginning I have seen in the genre. The ending is the only disappointment. I would recommend Psycho Gothic Loita , it is one of the better titles in the genre of Gore out there.",1309996800,3,211,4.275
8437106,5,B004OCCLDY,"Great film.  Its over the top, cartoonish violence only makes it better.  The bad guys - similar to the big bosses you need to beat in a video game - do a great job too - and Lady Elle is one of the best villains I've ever seen.",1516924800,,228,3.7291666666666665
8437107,4,B004OCCLDY,This is a rather good revenge flic in the vein of a Japanese rendition of Kill Bill.  Lots of gore and action.,1516838400,,110,4.0
8437108,3,B004OCCLDY,"The first 15-20 minutes (Yuki's first kill) and last final 15-20 minutes (Yuki's last kill) are totally worth a watch. If the entire movie was a good as these two scenes, then it would have been a 5 star movie, but it just isn't. The rest of the movie lacked the gore, violence, quirkiness, and darkness that I really expected to get from this film. It's worth renting for $1-$2, but not worth buying for $10. I recommend you find it to rent for really cheap first, if you are more impressed than I was, then go ahead and buy it for full price.",1465603200,,544,4.240384615384615
8437109,5,B004OCCLDY,"Watch it and be amzed of the special effects, acting and most racially diverse gang ever. This movie is best watched with friends because it's so good",1437004800,,150,4.592592592592593
8437110,5,B004OCCLDY,"sooooo much fun ,watched a few times already",1427155200,2,44,4.625

8437112,3,B004OCCLDY,I guess I was hoping for better...it was an ok watch...it's got a cutie girl...in goth Lolita outfits...blood and carnage...and if you're like me...and you have a voracious voyeuristic appetite...it serves its purpose...though it probably would be a while before I might ever think about watching it again,1404864000,2,305,5.375
8437113,5,B004OCCLDY,"This movie, if you like these movies, is really awesome! I love the action in this movie and Yuki looks legit in her lolita costume. If you like action and movies of this type, this is definitely a movie for you!",1393977600,2,212,4.195121951219512
8437114,1,B004OCCLDY,there isn't much to the movie.  a girl's mother gets killed and she dresses in a Lolita style outfit and kills everyone involved in her mother's murder.  naturally she does it with a parasol and some martial arts fighting skills but that's about it....until the final battle.  just when i thought the movie couldn't get any less stupid the final battle occurs and all of a sudden...yep something supernatural occurs!  the movie was just not cohesive.  i know this type of movie doesn't have much of a plot but it could have been tied together a little better. needless to say the acting was cheesey and the plot unoriginal.  the parasol could have been more interesting if they had varied the ways she used it.,1374278400,,710,4.64
8437115,5,B004OCCLDY,"I love this movie. I love the sword action; I'm a big fan of gory samuri films. An I like Lolita's character; the whole goth look design with the tutu and umbrella. Her umbrella has a spike one minute and it's a gun like the Penguin's from Batman Returns the next. I love it, I love it, I love it!!!!!",1372291200,6,301,4.033333333333333
