8377855,4,B002QPG9GQ,"I bought this triple feature because it had Oh heavenly Dog In It and it is a rare DVd to find. I like Far From Home also, but have not tried watching Rusty as it seemed more of a juvenille type movie.
  Oh Heavenly Dog stars Benji which one enver hears about these days, but used to be a popular animal star. A young Chevy Chase and Jane Seymour make this movie outstanding and the ending is really good. I would highly recommend it.",1378944000,,434,4.154761904761905
8377856,5,B002QPG9GQ,"I purchased this triple feature, only for the ""Oh Heavenly Dog"" movie that I remember watching many years ago.  It is over 30 years old and is one of many in my collection of good movies, that I would watch over and over again.  The other two in this selection I still have not watch, so I can not comment on them, good or bad.",1360195200,,327,4.015384615384615

8377858,3,B002QPG9GQ,"I selected this item because I was looking for ""Oh Heavenly Dog"" and it came with two other movies which I considered a wild card bonus.

""Oh Heavenly Dog"" is probably the best of the Benji movies, with well-known human actors Chevy Chase, Jane Seymour & Omar Sharif, and a compelling story line that holds the viewer's interest.  Alone, I would rate this film 5 stars.

""Far From Home"" was pretty average 'boy and dog have an adventure in the wilderness' family fare.  Pleasant enough but nothing remarkable.

But I was really quite appalled at the production quality of ""Rusty the Great Rescue"".  Despite featuring well-known actors in both human and voice-over form, it looked like it was made on someone's back 40 over a long weekend, and to say the dialogue was trite and stilted would be kind.  I have yet to meet a real live child who talks the way these two do.  I don't think I'll be watching this one again!",1302480000,2,917,4.548780487804878
