6897749,5,B00R0HUEWK,"I ordered this as soon as it was released and got it in the mail today.  I was so excited that Jessica did another walking DVD.  I just finished the first workout...Cardio Core.  I am now 50 and have exercised most of my adult life and I also love to go hiking.  I have owned dozens of exercise videos.  Let me say that I only do Jessica's exercises now.  She is so fun and motivating and you can tell she really knows her stuff...I trust her.  I would say I am intermediate, but any one can do her workouts.  She builds upon her moves, so that you can take it to where you need it to go...or just stay with the base move.  I follow her YouTube channel and she posts workout schedules for her YouTube workouts (she has a great variety of types and lengths of workouts).  I exercise in the morning with those, but I sit at a desk all day and I decided to start doing her walking workouts in the late afternoon to give me energy.  It is not just about weight loss...it's about balance, posture, energy, wellness, flexibility, strength, back health - and she talks about all of those things.  I recommend Jessica Smith in general, and I also recommend this set of workouts.  I wish it wasn't called ""21 day weight loss plan"", because if you try it, hopefully you will enjoy it as much as I do and make it a lifelong habit.
She makes it fun...this walking workout series would be a great place to start.  And if you already follow Jessica, the one I tried was fresh and new, not the same routines as her YouTube...but still in the same style.",1420156800,,1538,4.258620689655173
6897750,4,B00R0HUEWK,I love Jessica but I'm undecided.  It didn't seem as fun as her other DVDs.  Maybe I was over tired?  I love this girl's dvds.  I'll give them another whirl and update .,1513209600,,169,4.03030303030303

6897752,5,B00R0HUEWK,"I didn't purchase this on amazon (I don't have a dvd player anymore) but felt compelled to leave a review. I purchased this set thru Jessica Smith's streaming site. I am not new to exercise, but fell off the wagon for a few years and am getting back to it. I had never done a Jessica Smith workout before, but felt I needed to take it down a notch from my previous Beachbody videos and the like. I am turning 50 in two weeks, and want to get back to regular exercising again, not only for weight management, but for health. I stumbled upon Jessica on youtube, and tried out a few of her walking and kickboxing videos. She is so motivating and friendly, and her workouts are fun. After a couple of weeks, I decided to purchase a video set, and Walk on: 21 Day Weight Loss Plan, seemed just right. Love this set. It's got great music, shows modifiers for lower and higher levels and they are each a half hour. There are four total workouts, First one is sustained cardio, walking, with some standing ab work. Second, is a HIIT interval workout, you put in as much effort as you can with each HIIT, third is a walking with weights (I started with 3 pound dumbbells and was fatigued by the end) and the fourth is a walking/stretch workout. Love each one. They are not crazy like the Beachbody ones I was doing (and am not ready for now). Also, I injured my self multiple times doing some of those workouts, pulled calf, messed up my back. These are lower impact and you can take them up a notch to higher if you want to. Perfect for where I am right now, and lots of room to grow. LOVE Jessica, she is wonderful, motivating, and makes you want to keep going. Her common sense approach just what I need to motivate me to continue on my health journey. I will definitely be purchasing more of her workouts. Don't hesitate to buy this set!",1508198400,6,1832,4.297687861271676

6897758,5,B00R0HUEWK,"I LOVE these videos. I have a lot of work out videos and I never stick with them. They're either too difficult, too long, or the instructor isn't too my liking. These videos are 30 minutes long - long enough to feel like you're actually accomplishing something, but short enough that I don't feel like I'm spending all of my free time exercising. These are as difficult as you make them. There are three people in each video, each working at a different level of intensity, so you just follow the one that matches your level. So much better than videos that start really difficult and then show modifications in the last 15 seconds of an exercise. And Jessica is just the best. She's positive and encouraging and feels so much more real and genuine than the exercise robots in midst other videos who tell you to keep working if you don't want to be flabby. I don't enjoy exercising, but I really enjoy these, and actually look forward to them. Cannot recommend enough. And now I'm going to go buy her other videos :)",1491091200,5,1016,4.4972972972972975

6897760,3,B00R0HUEWK,"I loved the actual workouts and the fact that there are modification choices to each set of exercises. Also liked that each workout was timed 30 minutes, a perfect time to give it everything you have without exhausting yourself or injuring yourself by over extending. Sorry to say that I had to return both sets I received because the second of the two discs skipped and froze in the exact same place. How disappointing!!!! Would appreciate if the product would have better monitoring of quality assurance. Don't know if I will try a third time. :-(",1489968000,3,549,4.729166666666667

6897763,5,B00R0HUEWK,I have been walking with Leslie Sansone for years but I started getting bored with the same routine. I needed more of a challenge but still wanted a walking workout. I'm so glad I found this one love it !,1486857600,3,204,4.125

6897765,5,B00R0HUEWK,"I absolutely love Jessica Smith's approach to exercise!  I rarely ever give anyone 5 stars.  Since I am an exercise junkie I have a library of over 350 exercise videos including many categories.  Over the last several months I have consistently turned to Jessica's workouts.  She is friendly, and seems to love what she does.  It is fun to see her work out with her mom and friends.  You can watch her mom for lower impact options or her friend for higher impact.  I am constantly on the lookout for her newest workouts.  Thanks Jessica for making working out fun!  Please do more soon.",1486512000,4,586,4.5576923076923075
6897766,5,B00R0HUEWK,I HATE to exercise. I usually start out all gung ho and fizzle out. I can honestly say I thoroughly enjoy this DVD. My hubby and kids are shocked that I'm still exercising! LOL,1486252800,5,176,4.205882352941177

6897768,5,B00R0HUEWK,"**UPDATE** Since I started this workout on Jan. 10, I have lost two inches around my waist, one around my thighs and my calves got just a smidge bigger!  I can honestly say that I cannot WAIT to do my workout!  I purchased another one of Jessica's DVD's, the Walk On: 15-Minute Fast Fat Blasts and love them equally!  So much fun and seeing results, physically and mentally!!!!!!!!  Just did my first day workout and loved it. Some history on me. I used to be very fit, taught fitness classes, size two and ripped! Then entered into a not so good phase of life and gained 50 lbs with no activity. I bought many workout dvds which were discouraging for my fitness level and left me unmotivated and dreading my next workout. This workout elevated my heart rate, made me sweat and I feel amazing after day one. I took my measurements and will update this review after my 21 days! I am excited for the next workout! Which says a lot!!!",1484006400,28,931,4.395348837209302
6897769,1,B00R0HUEWK,I was not able to open either of the 2 DVD's that came with this purchase; however ALL other DVD's work on my PC - so unfortunately I am not able to provide a fair review of the product,1483488000,,185,3.769230769230769

6897773,3,B00R0HUEWK,I admire Jessica Smith and follow her exercise videos regularly and Walk On: 21 Day Weight Loss Plan is a helpful one but one of the four work outs in the video is too difficult for me and one is challenging but I can do it.  Keep in mind I am a 68 year old but I have exercised continuously for the last 38 years so I am in better shape than many my age.,1480636800,4,355,3.7333333333333334

6897775,5,B00R0HUEWK,"It isn't easy to make a video that can be watched over-and-over, but Jessica Smith has done it. The workouts are efficient and upbeat with great cues about posture and upcoming moves. I love that her (gorgeous!) mom is involved as well as a friend - both mom and friend look like normal people who have a life outside of the gym. Above all, Jessica's excellent technique as a trainer and friendly down-to-earth personality is what makes it all work so well. Check-out her videos online. If you like her approach, you'll be pleased with this product.

Special note to folks (re)starting an exercise routine. As someone who has to lose 50 pounds (and was feeling very uninspired), I found this video motivating - the sunny local, Jessica's down-to-earth approach, and the effective use of time have combined to get me on the path to health. I hope it can do the same for you. :-)",1479945600,9,880,4.611464968152866

6897781,5,B00R0HUEWK,"I just happened to find this workout while looking at other walking DVDs. I love these walking workouts. This has helped me so much to stay active as I eat better and live a healthier lifestyle. Jessica is fantastic, motivating, and gives great cues to follow along. My stamina and strength have improved so much because each workout is diverse and that keeps it interesting. I look forward to exercising and walking everyday now. There is no boredom with Jessica, her mom and others in these workouts. It great to choose your level and get moving. I am planning to use all her workout programs. Thanks for making exercise fun again!",1476230400,3,633,4.711711711711712
6897782,5,B00R0HUEWK,"I love this workout.  I am generally opposed to workout DVDs, but this one has blown me away and really become my favorite.  After a few years out of college my regular work out and dancing came to an end, and I gained a good 30 pounds and have been working tirelessly on shredding them off - I found just eating right didn't shred all the weight.  This DVD I did alone for a week to get use to, along with walking 30 minutes a day (and eating correctly), and then after the first week I coupled it with ""Walk On: 15-Minute Fast Fat Blasts"" as recommended and I feel so good.  This is a great workout DVD, I think the host is peppy, not obnoxious, and when I was doing a move I'd wonder if I was doing it right and it's like she read my mind and I would straighten out.  This is a great workout to kickoff getting back on track, or even get in 5,000 steps (I use my fitbit to track my cardio and steps).  This was definitely worth the money - nothing can compare to the great feeling after completing a workout!",1476144000,4,1011,4.08080808080808
6897783,5,B00R0HUEWK,"I just discovered Jessica Smith because I found a knee strengthening video by her on My Fitness Pal. I liked her bright personality and saw that she had other work-out videos, so I decided to start with this one.  I am 26 and I have some knee and wrist pain which made it hard to find a method of exercise that I could enjoy without aggravating these areas. I really don't like using a gym and I find it difficult to really push myself on the cardio machines.  Also a lot of the cardio machines use very repetitive motions which I notice can worsen my knee pain.  I found these dvds to be so much fun and easy on my knees.  I am relieved to have found Jessica Smith and that I can actually enjoy working out again!  I also was surprised at how challenging these videos can be. Jessica is a great motivator and I find myself pushing my body to work harder than I would do on my own.  I have also already seen excellent results in my mood, cardiovascular strength, and body image in the few weeks that I have been using this routine. I feel healthier, happier, and more confident! I recently purchased the 30-day plan and am excited to try more of Jessica's workouts!",1475971200,2,1165,4.296803652968037

6897786,5,B00R0HUEWK,"This is an excellent workout.  I needed to try something new after not exercising for over a month after breaking a bone in my foot.  Jessica is very real and very motivating.  This two DVD pack has several different  30 minute workouts and I never get bored of them.  This is not just a walking DVD, but she incorporates a lot of standing abdominal work and upper body work.  I would recommend this to anyone as a great new workout to get yourself motivated and re-energized.",1475366400,,476,4.476744186046512

6897790,5,B00R0HUEWK,I was looking for a simple workout that I can do in the morning but not over work myself so I tried this. So far it's harder than I expect which is great gives me room to grow and get better. I love the routine and how she keeps you motivated. I really enjoy this workout video.,1473552000,,278,3.8947368421052633

6897792,5,B00R0HUEWK,"I just love everything Jessica does and these workouts do not disappoint. I have lower back issues but am always able to modify her moves easily. Something I notice from all of her workouts (I think I have all the DVDs) is that while I'm doing the workout it feels doable and at the end I'm sweating and exhausted, but not super sore the next day. I also love the workout schedules she provides for free! This was purchased to go along with her new Fall 2016 Challenge. I like following a plan so for me it's perfect. Sign up for her emails and she sends the workout challenges, weekly motivation and even coupon codes - it's awesome!",1473379200,,634,4.38135593220339
6897793,5,B00R0HUEWK,"For those of you unfamiliar with Jessica Smith, she has a lot of free workouts available on YouTube so you can get an idea of her personality and training methods. I was introduced to her through a low-impact, high intensity workout regimen featured on My Fitness Pal and was greatly impressed. The exercises were effective and they could be performed while standing, which is important for those of us who haven't worked out in a while. The fact that she offers workouts for free is what moved me to make this purchase. She seems committed to promoting a healthy lifestyle and that deserves our support.",1473292800,2,604,4.761904761904762

6897796,5,B00R0HUEWK,"Did my first day of Walk On 21 Day Weight Loss Plan, and I love it! I started my weight loss journey 3 years ago today, and have come pretty far using MyFitnessPal (where I first learned about Jessica and her Walk Strong programs and videos) and some aerobics videos that I've been doing since the 1980's! I decided it was time for a change, with a new, updated series of videos to get my heart pumping and my muscles stronger. Jessica (along with her mother Debbie and friend Beth) really rock out the exercise in the first session, with encouragement and tips all along the way. Can't wait to move on to Day 2!",1472688000,,612,4.3304347826086955
6897797,5,B00R0HUEWK,"The cardio core walk is the best cardio video I've ever used. It's especially good for beginners. Jessica explains each step and somehow also keeps the pace going. She is enthusiastic and makes the workout fun. The moves are simple but effective. The pace increases, of course, but isn't life-threatening, and it slows down a bit at the end. I would recommend this to anyone, beginner or intermediate, who wants a good, solid--but not manic or drill-sergeant tough--workout.",1471737600,2,474,5.089743589743589
6897798,5,B00R0HUEWK,"Most exercise dvds I've found over the years (MANY years) have left me bored or overwhelmed. Jessica's dvds have completely captivated me; I was astounded at the energy I had after completing the Day One program, and now I am well into the 21 Day Plan. While I cannot yet claim that the 15 lbs I need to lose is coming off, at least I have not gained more and feel back in control of my body. The most important issue: I WANT to do these daily exercises; I look forward to the 30-min. segments because I feel unusually refreshed and productive for the remainder of my day. There is no one in this field who presents a better mix of movements or explains them more clearly than this instructor. No time is wasted in the segments, and it is extremely easy to fall into the rhythm of each movement. Jessica also suggests how to get a lower or higher impact workout by following her mom Deb or friend Beth in the background. I am a full-time-working 62 yr old in decent enough shape to keep up with Jessica 90% of the time and LOVE this routine. My goal is to get to the ""Beth"" level during the workouts :-)) Am now looking forward to working Jessica's yoga dvd program into my weekly fitness routine.

6897801,5,B00R0HUEWK,"If you are New to Jessica Smith workouts, this is a great place to start. Her gentle encouragement is such a nice change from the bootcamp mentality out there. No robot women in this DVD. She gives very safe instruction and her moves and cues are excellent. The workouts are all different and a good complement to each other.

6897802,4,B00R0HUEWK,"Jessica has become my go-to instructor-leader in cardio low impact walking routines. I am 67 years old and able to keep up with Jessica or her mom. There is a third exerciser, Beth, who does more high impact moves that you can follow. I am all about counting steps and I am able to get almost 4000 steps from the 30 minute ab conditioner and HIIT cardio and almost 3000 steps from the strength training. The stretch and flexibility is just that and you get very few steps from it. I wish these were chaptered to combine them but I don't think that Jessica designed them to be combined. I also wish that for the money there were more routines instead of just three active and one mostly stretching.",1468022400,3,697,4.410852713178294
6897803,5,B00R0HUEWK,I really love these workouts. They are well designed to help people at varying levels of fitness. This set contains one of my favorite HIIT workouts. I really like that Jessica tells the viewer to do posture checks during the routine with weights. It really helps minimize the chances for injury. Another nice thing about this set is that it stays true to the nature of her YouTube videos with minimal editing and helpful tips for getting the most out of a fitness program. I did the 21 day program 2 times over earlier this year and it helped improve my overall fitness.,1467849600,,571,4.553398058252427

6897805,5,B00R0HUEWK,I love this program! Jessica is a great motivator and I felt really encouraged to stick with it and stay on the plan.

6897806,5,B00R0HUEWK,"I absolutely love all four workouts on this DVD, and especially the HIIT (high intensity interval training) workout.  Jessica is a wonderful instructor, always friendly and encouraging, never obnoxious or annoying.  Her workouts are a great ""next step"" after graduating from Leslie Sansone and other walking-based programs.  I definitely feel like I've made a lot of improvements in stamina and strength since switching to Jessica's workouts.  Highly recommend this set.

6897810,5,B00R0HUEWK,"I have tried almost all the workout DVDs over the years and Jessica Smith is the best! All moves are back and knee safe and yet still a great workout! I don't know how she does that because other videos say to modify moves and then I didn't get a good workout. Also, no skimpy outfits even though she could pull it off. That's class!",1459468800,,333,4.138461538461539
6897811,5,B00R0HUEWK,"Much more than I thought it would be. I was skeptical, but have been quite impressed with the workouts. Being 55 and not in the best shape, I can keep up ( for the most part). I really feel like I've accomplished something when I finish.  I look forward to the workouts every day.",1459036800,2,280,4.185185185185185

8693628,5,B00R0HUEWK,This is one of my favorite Jessica Smith sets. I have almost all her DVDs. These ones give you a great workout. I like being able to workout at home and feel like I really worked hard in a short amount of time. These are good for beginner to intermediate users. This may be too easy for someone who is really advanced.,1531008000,,318,4.145161290322581

8693631,3,B00R0HUEWK,"Jessica was wonderful, as always.  She gives clear, easy to follow directions, and it's always a plus having three different levels of intensity to choose from.  However, I didn't enjoy this dvd as much as I have her other ones, mainly because of the set.  The glaring white background was hard on the eyes, and the lighting on Debbie, Jessica, and Beth was awful.  Also, there seemed to be some rather chatty crew members off camera, and you could hear them making muffled comments - a further unnecessary distraction.  If it wasn't for the lighting and sound problems, I would've given this dvd 5 stars instead of 3.",1527465600,,618,4.685185185185185

8693635,4,B00R0HUEWK,"Nice mixture of workout choices, some mostly cardio and some with toning and less cardio.  Overall the workouts felt easy to medium - a great way to get some exercise without going over the top.  The one workout I didn't like and won't do again was the one with the bands - it felt very awkward and contrived.  I would recommend this set as a go-to group of workouts.  Easy to follow, and Jessica is very likable.",1517011200,,413,4.324675324675325
8693636,4,B00R0HUEWK,"My doctors will not allow me to do a regular exercise program, but they agreed to me trying this one, I really enjoy this program, because it is not so overwhelming that it is difficult to keep up with, and because it does make you feel like you have someone in your corner, hoping you to learn how to effectively exercise, without necessarily overdoing it. When I first started, I was not exercising very often, and sometimes when you first start, you feel sore, with this program, I felt like I was able to do a fair amount of work without pain. I would recommend this program to someone who does not have the ability to go out to the gym, or perhaps they are just starting out.",1516752000,,680,4.3203125
8693637,5,B00R0HUEWK,"I just got this series and completed all 4 workouts 4 days in a row -- really looking forward to continuing this cycle to get to the 21 days because I think these workouts are great. I really like Jessica's workouts -- this year I was feeling like I had lost all my fitness over the holidays and I wanted to give myself a jumpstart, and I wanted new work outs because as much as I love her other DVDs I just needed some new routines. I worked HARD this week, I think they will do exactly what I'm looking for in terms of getting me back on track. Also, I like these workouts because I'm 51 years old and have to watch my lower back, knees and hips at times - I feel like they aren't so crazy that I'm going to hurt myself, and there's always the option to tone them down or up depending on who you follow when watching them.  GREAT program!!!",1515888000,4,842,4.072289156626506
