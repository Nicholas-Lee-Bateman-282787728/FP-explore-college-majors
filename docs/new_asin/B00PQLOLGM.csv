I was thinking it would be along the lines and quality of ""Who Dares WIns"" aka ""The Final Option."" Boy was I wrong. This movie was more like an extremely low budget made for TV movie. The writer obviously knows nothing about military or police protocol which shows in this dreadful film. It appeared like a ripoff of the movie ""Die Hard."" The way that the bad guys casually took over the PM's residence was ridiculous and totally unbelievable. At least ""Die Hard"" presented the takeover of the Nakatomi Building in a manner that seem somewhat believable. Also, the low budget really shows through with the lack of any functioning weapons. All of the firearm discharges are nothing but digital effects that are very cheaply (think Sy Fy Channel movies cheap effects). There are no weapons that actual fire (just a digital fake flash) and none of the weapons ejects any spent casings. Also, the bullet hits are all fake, cheaply done digital (CGI) fake blood splatters. Almost everyone in the movie are able to make head shots without even aiming their guns.

The actors seemed like they were capable actors, but the script writing was such total crap that the poor actors had nothing to work with. If anyone is remotely thinking about purchasing this movie my advice is don't waste your money. If you dont' already have these movies than get them instead. ""Who Dares WIns"" aka ""The Final Option"" and ""The WIld Geese."" Both are British movies and are professionally written, and obviously used real military, police, mercenaries, and SAS as technical advisers. These movies are great movies, not crap like this ""Downing Street Siege."" I'd give this movie a negative star if I could.",1438646400,,1768,4.8737541528239205
8688975,1,B00PQLOLGM,"This ranks high up there amongst the WORST movie ever made.  Everything about it was fake, flawed and flat-out filth.  Can't get over the fact that I was duped into purchasing this so called 'movie' that reeks of being made by a 12 year old's school project.  Urgh.......!!!  Move along folks, this circus is scandalous.  Cheers ><>",1433894400,,332,4.754385964912281

The film opens with heavy flashbacks and news reports from the first film to help your memory, or in case you missed it. Our personable bad guy Alexander Holt (Simon Phillips) survives a bullet wound to the should quiet well and is involved in an improbable rescue.

Meanwhile our hero Chris Lowe (Tom Benedict Knight) is drummed out of the service for acting without authority. Now if you peaked at the title of the film, you know we are in for a remake, an English version of ""Die Harder"" and we know the outcome. What I loved about this hack formula film is Simon Phillips who kills like a sociopath. Without him, this is a basic 2-3 star action film.
