8316540,4,B001KYNCMS,"There have been 4 film versions, and 1 television production of Agatha Christie's book Ten Little Indians (And Then There Were None).  I have never seen the television version but have seen all 4 film versions. All versions have followed the modified structure of the play version Christie did.  (If you haven't ever read the book, read it!  It goes in different directions in several places.)  The first movie was made in 1945 and is excellent, by far the most faithful to the play.  The 1965 version switches the setting and is fun, with a good cast.  The version I am reviewing here is the 1974 version.  Again the setting is changed; this time becoming a hotel in the middle of the Iranian desert.  The cast is very good, even Oliver Reed and  Elke Sommer are better than usual.  As a rule, I find Reed somewhat annoying and Sommer  is very beautiful,  but usually not much of an actress. Attenborough, Lom, and Audran are all quite good. The setting is interesting and actually very impressive. It's a beautiful hotel and the ruins nearby are also fascinating.  If you have never seen a movie version of this play, you will like this; if you have, you may very well find it not quite as good as the first 2 films but much, much better than the pitiful 1989 remake.  I am reviewing the video tape version,  which was not in widescreen; this version of the film hasn't been released in the US on dvd as of yet.  It would be interesting to see it widescreen and with commentary and extras.",1304726400,13,1491,4.4869888475836435
8316541,2,B001KYNCMS,"'And Then There Were None' is an updating of Agatha Christie's 'Ten Little Indians'  ( originally titled 'Ten Little N*****s'  and soon no doubt, there'll be those shrieking for it to be re-named 'Ten Little Sociological Racial Minorities' !)  set in a deserted hotel in Iran (!) and featuring a fading - and rather gruff - 'all-star' cast.

Notably, 'And Then There Were None' carries the stamp of Harry Alan Towers ~ a sort of artless, swishless euro-tinker. He raises money then gives it to the likes of Jess Franco to make infinite numbers of non-studio films about blaise murderers and their bland victims. Credit wise, 'The Face of Fu Manchu' is probably his pealing glory; while two early nineties Christopher Lee/Sherlock Holmes yarns also warrant a mention.
Adopting many aliases - script-writer Peter Welbeck being principle - he was still producing films in his mid-eighties. That he NEEDED TO tells you much....

He's been responsible for at least three versions of this tale ~ this one directed by Peter Collinson, who also did the kitchen sink flag-waver 'Up The Junction' and the excellent suspense slasher 'Fright.'  ~  but to be fair, this one's a plodder.
There's limited mild amusement to be garnered trying to guess the murderer from amidst the legion of 'celebrities' hamming it up like Spam, but even here, it's difficult to glean much sympathy for the nasty likes of Herbert Lom, Adolpho Celi and Charles Aznavour; each jostling like feeding geckos for the red herring of the Caspian award.
Surprisingly, it's left to Oliver Reed (!) and Elke Sommer (swoon!) to add some dignity to the dusty old pot-boiling and what poor old Dickie Attenborough is doing shuffling around in the murk is anyone's guess.

Fans of Ollie, though, will find much to enjoy; his is quite a restrained performance (for full blown Ollie - outside of Ken Russell, obviously - you need 'The Shuttered Room.') with only splinters of bullishness here and there. The fact that his character is the most likeable of the guests betrays much about the philosophy of 'ATTWN.'
Personally, I like to see lithe, mammiferous doxies getting iced because no matter how stupid and annoying they are, you can usually feel decently compensated that you've at least seen SOMETHING worthwhile !
When all you have is Orson Welles' voice curling from a tape, and Gert Froebe rolling his eyes trying to appear guilty - you haven't even got that.

Harsh, but it's a hard place we're living.  Avid Ollie-watchers will lap this up, but unless Charles Aznavour doing a punk version of the title song or Stephane Audren's sensual punt at the well-worn 'famous-actress-playing-a-famous-actress' routine floats your boat, there's only bits and bobs for the rest of us.",1304294400,5,2736,4.967177242888402
