1989690,3,B0001DCBUS,This is a made for television soap opera movie acted by tv actors. Wife (Mandy) unhappy in marriage and wants divorce. Her best friend (Jane) is visiting and we see sparks between Jane and husband. When husband takes Jane to the airport they kiss - yawn. Husband pursues Jane with letters and phone messages. At the same time Mandy sending Jane (Cheryl Ladd) updates of her life moving on like opening store. Work brings Jane back for a visit - another predictable story line. When visiting Jane also interested in younger man to the annoyance of husband who is pursuing Jane. Doesn't look like a chance for younger man as Jane and husband make love in bed. Another big yawn for suspense. More love making. Mandy thinks Jane is having affair with younger man - not her husband. By accident Mandy's daughter sees her father and Jane kissing and tells her mom. Mandy waiting at husband's place when husband and Jane show up kissing and undressing. Mandy explodes and tells Jane friendship is over for good. Jane asks husband if they are in love...more love making. Movie ends with Jane and Mandy wanting their best friend back - embrace and friends again. Jane walks toward husband. NO SUSPENSE; TV ACTING; YAWN!,1336089600,3,1210,4.739336492890995
1989691,5,B0001DCBUS,"This is a story about mourning, break up, rekindled love, best friends and so much more.  This movie shows the complexities of relationships, guilt and desire.  The acting is terrific, with Cheryl Ladd as a powerful lead.  Bess Armstrong and William R. Moses also carry their weight.  This is a movie that demands to be watched more than once.  It's also verrrrrry affordable at $5.99.",1335139200,6,385,4.861538461538461

1989694,1,B0001DCBUS,"Nothing much really to say! I might not be the right person to judge this movie, or this movie is so cold and not excited. Before I write my review I saw what others said about it in imdb website. It has got 4 out of 10! The reason why I bought this movie was the price. It was inexpensive and I like drama, but this one lacks lots of what real drama is. Some people may have other opinions and I do respect all opinions.",1282003200,8,421,3.9069767441860463

1989699,4,B0001DCBUS,"This is a fairly well done movie about an unusual subject.  Question is - if the wife doesn't want the husband anymore is it alright for her best friend to take him.  I think it would have been wiser for the husband and the friend to let things settle a bit before starting an affair but then we wouldn't have had a movie.  It reeks of the friend still grieving over her husband's death and him grieving over the fact that his wife just let him know she doesn't want to be married to him anymore.  Can two people in this situation find true happiness together.  They leave that unanswered.  It's a pretty good movie, well acted by everyone.",1410220800,,640,4.336134453781512

1989701,4,B0001DCBUS,"Jane Thornton (Cheryl Ladd) is a successful attorney coping with the loss of her husband.

For the first time since his death, she is visiting her best friends Mandy (Bess Armstrong) and Will (William R. Moses). Years ago, Jane and Will were lovers. When their romance ended, Jane introduced Will to Mandy, and they've been happily married ever since - or so Jane thinks. Soon after her arrival, Jane senses something is wrong between them. Mandy confides in Jane that she feels unfulfilled and plans to leave Will. Jane is stunned. She begs Mandy to reconsider, but later Mandy erupts and asks a shocked Will for a divorce.

When Jane agrees to double with Will in a tennis match, they find they make a great team. Swept up in the excitement of the moment, Will and Jane passionately kiss. Despite their obvious attraction, Jane is hesitant to betray Mandy's trust, and tries to get her friends back together. At the gala opening of Mandy's new design shop, a distraught Will tells Jane that he and Mandy are finished.

After the party, he offers to drive Jane home. Having more in common than ever, Will and Jane give in to their long-simmering desire. The next morning, Will and Jane are filled with remorse, but their rekindled passion is too strong for either of them to deny, and they continue their secret trysts.

Meanwhile, Mandy surmises that Jane is seeing someone and is happy for her friend, unaware it's her husband that Jane is involved with. The next day, however, Mandy's mother sees Will and Jane together. Mandy confronts Jane, telling her their friendship is over.

Devastated, Jane is torn between the best friend she cherishes and the lover she can't live without, until she makes a surprising decision that will affect all their lives.",1390780800,2,1758,4.788778877887789
