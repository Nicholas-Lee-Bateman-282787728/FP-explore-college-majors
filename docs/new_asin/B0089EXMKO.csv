The included PDF Tear Sheet even says Guitar World August 2011 at the bottom of page.  I always enjoy the In Deep articles, and I save my Guitar World back issues.  I assumed that it was an ""In Depth"" exploration of these topics, beyond the GW monthly column.  I have these exact articles in my personal archives.  I proficient at reading music, and don't need video demonstrations.

I'm disappointed with my purchase, but i'm still giving it 3 stars because Andy Aledort always has some tasty licks.",1430179200,,601,4.730769230769231
