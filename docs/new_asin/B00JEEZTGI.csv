6355479,4,B00JEEZTGI,I'm not familiar with Brent Butt but all through the movie I tried to place him as he reminded me of an actor somewhere. I'm not usually flummoxed like that so I bio'ed him after the movie and found him to be exclusively Canadian. I liked him enough to pursue his other work. And Amy Smart was very good. The both dark and light premise kept me interested to the end.,1406246400,4,367,4.183098591549296
6355480,5,B00JEEZTGI,"All I can say is that this film could easily become a cult classic. If you enjoyed Brent Butt in ""Corner Gas"", you'll love him as a bumbling ""detective"". Much more fun than a pet rock...",1405036800,3,186,4.194444444444445
6355481,4,B00JEEZTGI,"This is a kind of low-budget Canadian Rom-Com throwback to the 1940s.

Leo is a schlub of a novelty sales-man.  When a hot blonde named Kyra walks into his office and mistakes him for a detective who can help her find her missing brother he decides to give it a go.  Comedic complications ensue because Leo is believably inept and unheroic, but has just enough gumption - or lack of situational awareness - to persevere.

I liked the characters.  Brent Butt's depiction of Leo was respectful of his character, an overweight, sad sack middle-aged man, who knows that he really doesn't have a chance at the hot blonde, but still gives it a go because who knows what could happen?
Likewise, Amy Smart's Kyra came across with an innocence for a character we know the trope requires to be a manipulator of sad sacks like Leo.  And a nice supporting performance was offered by David Koechner as Ernie, Leo's neighbor.  (Koechner is a terrific supporting actor who you will remember from a number of movies, and the TV show The Office, without knowing who he is.)

No Clue does not set a high bar for itself, but it is an enjoyable - occasionally funny - but not embarrassing, gross or abusive comedy, and decent way to burn an evening.",1404604800,6,1229,4.579908675799087

6355484,5,B00JEEZTGI,"Brent Butt became a huge Canadian star with his low-key, deadpan comedy. His sitcom timing is put to good use in this film; the script and its execution are extremely entertaining.",1402963200,3,180,4.838709677419355

6355503,5,B00JEEZTGI,"Brent Butt is one of the funniest guys out there; just about anything he touches turns to gold. In this case a very regular guy trying to impress a cute girl leads to all sorts of silliness. But then again, who says that P.I.s have to be cool.",1421798400,2,243,4.083333333333333

6355508,5,B00JEEZTGI,"As a Brent Butt aficionado, I found this movie to be an incredibly fun, witty, and enjoyable waste of a few hours.  The writing was very tight and no potential gags were missed.  And best of all, reflecting the high-brow blue-collar styles of Mr. Butt, the bathroom scene did not become an over-the-top episode of bathroom humor that most lazier comedians would have let it become.",1413676800,3,381,4.757575757575758
6355509,4,B00JEEZTGI,This a much better movie than most big comedies.  The acting and production quality are surprisingly good.  There are plenty of laughs and a better than average plot.  I enjoyed it!!  It is well scripted and cast.,1413417600,,213,4.675675675675675

6355511,4,B00JEEZTGI,...  not that there's anything wrong with that. Perfect movie to watch on an airplane....,1409529600,,89,4.933333333333334
6355512,5,B00JEEZTGI,"This is a great example of a film noir whodunnit with the witty comedy of Brent Butt.  If you enjoy watching mysteries and trying to figure out whodunnit, you will not be disappointed by this film.  Add that to the comedy of Brent Butt, and this is part of great Saturday afternoon popcorn and movie fest.",1408147200,2,305,4.428571428571429

This is not a bad movie, but will not cause a major change in your world or views.
it is just a fun, silly movie, like movies are supposed to be.",1509062400,,185,3.769230769230769
8650180,5,B00JEEZTGI,"Although it's in a different vein from his classic Corner Gas series, this movie totally reeks of Butt... Brent Butt's distinctively twisted brand of gentle humor, that is.  If you've enjoyed any of his other projects, you'll definitely enjoy this movie. Initially enthralled with Corner Gas, I sought out other projects by that show's cast -- almost all of which I would also recommend highly (especially the Hiccups series and, of course, Corner Gas: The Movie).",1499126400,,464,5.105263157894737
8650181,5,B00JEEZTGI,Typical Brent Butt.  Not as funny as Corner Gas but a decent movie.  I wasn't disappointed.,1492473600,,91,4.625

8650186,3,B00JEEZTGI,"If you're a fan of Corner Gas, there's lots to like about this movie. Brent Butt is a first rate comedy writer, and no one can deliver deadpan craziness the way he can. For example, he describes Amy Smart as a stone cold, gorgeous dish full of red-hot fox meat set up under a hottie lamp until it was smoking. The weakest thing about the movie is the somewhat flimsy plot, but the whole thing hangs together and it does a better job than most comedies of keeping up the momentum. Nancy Robertson has a cameo, too, though not as Wanda Dollard.",1484697600,3,542,4.323529411764706
