7864344,2,630419546X,"Who wrote this script?  What a terrible way to end the Shaft dynasty.
In one of the scenes Ninjas are on on top of huge boulders shooting arrows at Shaft.  Shaft manages to catch one of the arrows and throws it back at the Ninja, fatally killing him.  Can you believe that?  The Batman television series has better actions scenes.  I've seen better acting in Fast Actin' Tinactin!
Do yourself a favor and buy a Dirty Harry movie in lieu of Diamond Shaft.",989798400,2,454,4.421686746987952

7864346,1,630419546X,Richard Roundtree's character isn't even named Shaft. He is actaully named Archie. This is a story about a jewel-thief released from prison / trying to do the right thing.  A person would think by the title 'Shaft' that it  would be as good as the trilogy;this isn't the case.  Put your  blaxploitation spending cash back in your wallet and walk away. This is  garbage and chances are your vcr will  break in the process.,920246400,3,421,4.621621621621622
