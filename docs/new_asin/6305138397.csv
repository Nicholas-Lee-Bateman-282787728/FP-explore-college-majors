7883976,2,6305138397,"Ian Jacklin is pretty busy these days peddling pseudoscience to cancer patients, but in 1993, he was approaching the peak of his career as an action hero and releasing the first of two solo vehicles. Disappointingly, he did so through Cine Excel Entertainment  a film studio that made PM Entertainment look like Paramount and Cannon Films like Warner Bros. Expert Weapon has a couple unique touches that will make it appeal to hardcore B-movie fans, but general karate devotees will be hard-pressed to find much to like about this one.

The story: A convicted killer bound for the gas chamber (Jacklin,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Death-Match/dp/6303236898/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Death Match</a>) is recruited by a shadowy government organization to become a specialized assassin.

Essentially, this is a macho take on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/La-Femme-Nikita/dp/B0037TPGJQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">La Femme Nikita</a>&nbsp;with kickboxing. There is some potential: the training scenes are fairly entertaining, and the meat of the plot is a decently-handled romance that Jacklins character initiates with a murdered targets wife (Julie Merril,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mirror-of-Death/dp/B000286R8Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mirror of Death</a>). Its mildly fun at times, but the film struggles to keep up a basic level of intrigue. Cine Excels legendary cheapness is on full display in scenes that have clearly been shot without sound and dubbed in post-production, as well as the frequent fudging of action shots (e.g. explosions obviously filmed at different locations than where they take place in the story). The pace of the picture is not quite as meandering as it could be, but its exacerbated by the empty bleakness of the films world  giving the production an uncomfortably emaciated feel. Basically, its hard to stay glued to the screen with this one.

Jacklin is the star here, but as much as I wish I could say that he was one of the best parts of the film, he isnt. Ians character is given a couple interesting character quirks, but hes largely bland and leaves no dramatic impression whatsoever. B-movie staple Mel Novak (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Game-Of-Death/dp/B0015RCURI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Game Of Death</a>) is much more interesting in his role of Jacklins mentor, especially after making an entrance wherein hes dressed like a priest and beats up Ian for urinating on his bible. And while The Jackal may be the professional kickboxer among the cast, Novak definitely has the better fights. I wish this were high praise, but few of the eleven awkwardly-staged, poorly-paced brawls are in any condition to entertain. Though the finale allows for Ian to engage in a rare stickfight against enforcer David Loo (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pocket-Ninjas/dp/B0001WTVK2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pocket Ninjas</a>), its nothing special.

The inclusion of low budget stars Sam Jones and Joe Estevez sadly does not elevate the movie at all, leaving the film as nothing more than a weak time-waster. Ian Jacklin never appeared in any great movies, but hes definitely done better than this. Dont bother.",1449964800,,3362,6.203862660944206
7883977,1,6305138397,"Sam Jones who burst on to the scene way back in 1980s FLASH GORDON co-stars in this ridiculously trite and boring movie.  He plays the head of an agency called...TA DUM...THE PROGRAM!!  The participants in the Program are ASSASSINS who kill for the government, or so Mr. Jones says.  Whether they really do or not is never fully revealed.  Suffice to say, assassin and non-actor Ian Jacklin becomes his newest recruit.  There's one scene where Jacklin is told he has to take acting classes to help in undercover roles.  He tells instructor, the vacuous Judy Landers, ""I'm no actor!"".  Amen, truer words could never be spoken.  Mel Novak in his toupee and let's make me look younger makeup plays Jacklin's mentor, who also has asthma.  Joe Estevez brings further shame to the Sheen clan as a baseball spouting psycho, in one of the worst performances I've seen in a year!  Julie Merrill tags along as the blind wife of a mob leader whom Jacklin snuffs.  Of course, he falls in love with her and vows to take down the agency, which he does in a really dead climax.  In a truly inspired scene, prisoner Jacklin urinates on his priest's bible and tells him to go to hell.  The priest, who is really Novak undercover, kicks him in the privates and convinces him to join the Program.

Dull, daffy and definitely not worth renting or buying.",1092268800,2,1334,4.621276595744681
7883978,1,6305138397,"I was very disappointed with Expert Weapon. Sam Jones was great in Flash Gordon but in this movie well i think he should have left it alone. The acting and fighting scenes were so stupidly made,it was like as if a actor  was standing there waiting to be hit. This is the type of film that reminded  me of the early '80's low and cheap. Please do not waste your money on a  low budget film like this. Rent it or look for a diffrent type of action  film.",962409600,,452,4.044943820224719
