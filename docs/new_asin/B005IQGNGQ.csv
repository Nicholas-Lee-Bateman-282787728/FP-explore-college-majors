4709722,5,B005IQGNGQ,I LOVE this video!!  I will warn you that if you have never done dance videos before it may take you while to get down the move but don't let that stop you! The instructor is awesome and makes you want to dance your hardest! I have thought that most of the dance videos out there are not enough of a workout but this one is! Even when the moves are slow you are working your muscles and working up a sweat!  You will feel it after this one!  This is probably the most fun I have ever had working out!  I HIGHLY recommend this one!!!!,1355788800,3,533,4.0
4709723,5,B005IQGNGQ,"I read the overwhelmingly postive reviews on Amazon and decided to take a chance on this DVD.  My husband and I are so glad I did.  We work out together almost every night and have both enjoyed the simple-yet-fun choreography and the instructor's positive attitude and funny, encouraging comments.  We were literally both grinning the whole time we tried the workout, and we laughed out loud several times at Marc Santa Maria's funny cueing and comments delivered in a slighty sing-song tempo to match the dance/music, ""Where's your booty? Over there.""  ""You're cool when you're dancin'.""  After 3 or 4 times, we had the routine down and had enjoyed every workout, which felt more like a fun dance lesson.  The other great thing?  You FEEL THIS in your thighs and core and work up a respectable sweat.  If you're just looking for a fun, quick shot of cardio to liven up your workout routine, this is the answer.  Great price, too.",1346457600,3,930,4.726708074534161
4709724,5,B005IQGNGQ,"Ok..I love this Cardio Dance Party, I can feel the vibe. You can work out a sweat by the third routine or maybe even sooner it's work out every area of your body no body part goes un-noticed. I love how he pretends like the dance is coming to an end and then out of no where he throws in another dance step, he got me every time. I became a junkie for this video I will rewind, rewind, rewind and rewind until I get the dance steps down pack. (It works) I became addicted and I'm afraid to order something from Marc Santa Maria again because I might get even more addicted.

I'm not a club person but this sure do makes me want to go just to show these dance moves off..It was a good investment for me..if you love to dance, can endure fast pace routines than this my dear is for you.",1342483200,,784,4.0256410256410255
4709725,4,B005IQGNGQ,"This is a good dance workout DVD. Still have to get some of the routines, but overall I'm back to doing moves I haven't done in awhile. Feel great after each 20 min. routine.",1334102400,,174,4.147058823529412
4709726,4,B005IQGNGQ,"I loved the 3 routines on this DVD. At first I was skeptical cause I've never really felt like I get a good work out following other dance videos.. But these routines are different, they really get your heart rate up and you feel the burn in your buns, thighs and core which is great. They're also fun routines to learn.. My only problem is that I would've liked there to be more routines on the DVD. At least 6 would have been better..",1334102400,10,436,4.2023809523809526
4709727,5,B005IQGNGQ,"This is the BEST dance workout out there right now. I previewed some clips on CollageVideo.com, and immediately knew it was going to be so much fun! It was my first time working out to instructor MARC SANTA MARIA--and he didn't disappoint at aLL! He's such a SUPERSTAR!!!--Sexy, encouraging, slick, {and most importantly} his electric energy was oozing out the tv screen!...I felt like he was in the same room as me! (Cheesy, yes, but all true.) The dance moves felt like actual dance moves you could take to the club, as opposed to lame aerobic-style moves I've seen in other ""hip hop"" dance dvds. I found myself laughing most of the time--which to me, is a pretty good sign of a great workout! I hope Marc puts out more dvds similar to this one, cause' he's great! There needs to be more male dance instructors putting out dvds like this!!!",1325030400,,842,4.582781456953643
8474906,1,B005IQGNGQ,I watched it but I didn't lose weight. Maybe it's defective.,1408406400,,60,4.545454545454546
8474907,2,B005IQGNGQ,I couldn't keep up with the steps. Tried again and again until I got frustrated and I haven't picked it up again...,1383177600,,115,4.2727272727272725
8474908,4,B005IQGNGQ,Had a lot of fun and worked up a sweat. The instructor led you through the steps clearly so you enjoyed working out.,1382054400,,116,4.086956521739131
8474909,1,B005IQGNGQ,"This video has three different workouts.  The format if each is to show a move in slow pace five or so times then do it fast, move to the next move show it five or so times, then do it fast, then add to the first move fast and so on.  The problem is the moves are not simple enough to get so quickly.
Every workout video has some of a learning curve issue, but good ones (like Zumba and Turbo Jam) have moves that at least get your heart rate up even if you do them part-way because you are learning.  This video doesn't.  So instead of a good workout, you end up shuffling around and feeling frustrated.",1379635200,,604,4.050420168067227
8474910,5,B005IQGNGQ,"I have a collection of more than 20 dance DVD and so far this is my favorite.
Marc is very funny and moves are cool.",1376092800,,116,3.68
8474911,2,B005IQGNGQ,I just put this in my DVD player for the first time. Took me about 3 seconds to be completely frustrated. I'm usually a yoga girl. I can't dance. The trainer took off pretty quick. There was no easing into anything. No way can I grasp this stuff. Plus the guy is annoying. I need to find something else.,1373500800,,303,4.1525423728813555
8474912,2,B005IQGNGQ,"I was looking for a dance DVD that could teach me moves I could actually USE, whether at a club or just dancing around with my friends, but all of these moves are super outdated and though the instructor is friendly and clear enough, it just progresses too fast without enough breakdown to even learn the moves. Overall, BORING. I didn't even want to finish it and regret buying it. Search harder if you want a good dance workout that is also fun to do.",1367193600,,453,4.341176470588235
8474913,5,B005IQGNGQ,"This the very first fitness dvd I've ever bought and I totally love it. It has 3 different segments: House Party Fitness, Hip Hop Dance and Latin Dance. Each segment has 2-3 dance routines. I have crappy knees, two left feet and zero rhythm so I was somewhat dubious but the reviews were so spectacular that I thought if I was ever going to try one, this would be the one to experiment with.

Imagine my surprise when I found I could do the routines! The lead guy (who has 2 female backup dancers) is engaging and encouraging and makes understanding the moves very very simple (perfect for an idiot like me:) Plus they run through the move slowly several times over before doing it in real time. Once you learn a move, you move on to the next one. After you learn that one, they string the two moves together. Then you go on to the 3rd move and so on and so forth.

There was only 1-2 moves that didn't make sense for me with my creaky knees so I would insert a move I learned from a different dance to keep time.

I really dug the music too. It's some sort of house synth but it has a nice little repetition to it.

Overall, I would say this is an excellent dance fitness DVD for most people and worth the money I spent on it. I recommend it.",1366761600,,1243,4.145228215767635
8474914,5,B005IQGNGQ,"I am very particular about my workout DVDs for a number of reasons, most important being I have back and knee troubles, so I can't keep up with most instructors and their fancy moves.

I was able to see a preview of the DVD on Youtube beforehand, and Marc's enthusiasm grabbed me right off the bat! His excitement comes off as very genuine, not too over-the-top (no shade to Richard Simmons), like he's really into everything that he's doing, and helping ""you"" to do it, too. I have to imagine that's something hard to do given you're recording it in a studio talking to a camera.

The routines are fun! The music isn't bad. And if the moves begin to feel a little ""hellish"" on my knees, I modify them to something more my speed while still hanging in there. I'm still in the beginning stages of working out, so I haven't been able to finish the entire DVD, but it is one that I would definitely recommend. It's not boring at all. And Marc is FABULOUS!

SN: One of the backup girls--the blond named Heather--looks EXACTLY like Andrea from The Walking Dead. Just something I noticed.",1362096000,4,1082,4.482233502538071
8474915,3,B005IQGNGQ,"I think this would be great if you already know how to dance. I do not and I found the routines way too difficult. They show you the steps but they go too fast, so you can't really see/figure out what they're doing.",1360281600,4,215,4.023255813953488
