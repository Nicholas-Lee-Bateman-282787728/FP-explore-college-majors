1943259,5,B0000TG98I,"I have always read to my son, now 4 since he was an infant.  He loves it, and knew all of his letters by sight, but that was about it.  After watching Letter Factory and then later, Word Factory, he was making phonic sounds and understanding vowels/consonants in a matter of hours! He went around singing the Leapfrog phonics songs, how words are 'stuck together' by vowels and basically reading 3 letter words after a few days of this.  And people say videos/DVD's are bad for kids!  These two videos are a PERFECT way for absolute beginners to grasp their phonics and letter sounds in a very fast way, and be on their way to not only reading words but spelling them!  I am so impressed with the Leap Frog letter/word factory videos..absolute jewels for young childhood learning.  Now my son will excel and learn faster once he gets into formal preschool and kindergarten.",1088726400,9,873,4.636363636363637
1943260,5,B0000TG98I,"These movies are very addicting to my 4 year old daughter and her friends and they don't even realize that they are learning!!!  My daughter went from absolutely NO interest in phonics and letters to wanting to write letters, practice sounds, etc. ALL the time!!  Several friends have gotten the set too and have seen wonderful results as well.
The DVD's make it a story and Leap, Lily, and Tad go around their Dad's ""talking dictionary"" company. Tad goes from room to room meeting letters and having unique ways learn the sounds. (A pretend monster scares him and the A's, the yelling of Ah! explains how the short A sounds). Each letter room has letters doing something different which makes it easier for the child to remember the letter by what it does.
Buying the Neurosmith phonics tiles to go along has really helped too!!!",1086825600,2,830,4.7172413793103445
1943261,5,B0000TG98I,"An amazing set of DVD's. The first ""The letter factory"" taught my 2 and 4 yr. old letter identification and letter sounds. I was amazed at how fast they were learning.  They wanted to watch ""letters"" all the time. I know I heard ""the A say Ahh!"" at least a million times. When they finally know all the letters and their sounds completely; it took about 2 weeks (yes, I'm serious- just 2 weeks). We watched the next DVD ""The Word Factory"" this video taught them how to sound out words for reading and writing. My children loved ""Sticky letters"" as much ""letters"".  It amazed us how quick they learned using the simple concepts and silly songs in the movies. We have had the videos a little over a month and both children can say the alphabet identify letters by sight and give the sound the letters make. My 2 year old can tell what letter most words start with and my 4 year old can sound out most simple 3 and 4 letter words. My only regret is not having bought this product sooner. Did I mention how fast they were learning?",1086220800,,1027,4.316062176165803
1943262,5,B0000TG98I,My son is 2 1/2 and he loves the Letter Factory Dvd (the 2nd dvd Talking Word Factory is still a little advanced for him) He watched it at least 3 times a day for the first 3 days and now can recognize all the letters and know the sounds they make.  The audio and visuals they use for each letter are so catchy that ALL kids will love it and will be repeating the letters in no time!!!!!  A must for every parent with a pre-schooler!,1078876800,3,433,3.9655172413793105
1943263,5,B0000TG98I,I absolutely love these dvd's.  Both my children (23 months and 3 years)love them.  A perfect addition to the Leap Frog products.  A MUST!!!!!!!!,1072569600,2,145,4.958333333333333
1943264,5,B0000TG98I,"This is such a great DVD.  I wanted to get my stubborn three-year-old ready for Pre-K next September.  He's not very easy to sit down and teach and he frustrates easily.  Since viewing the Letter Factory, he's surprisingly familiar with many of the letters and their sounds.  Kudos Leap Frog!  Thanks a bunch for such a fundamental start.",1072137600,6,338,4.758620689655173
1943265,5,B0000TG98I,My son and daughter both knew the alphabet phonetically before they were four by merely watching this video (I hadn't even gone over the letter's sounds yet!).  They make have a catchy song for each letter.  And the word factory gives them a head-start into reading with a great explaination of vowels.  I was recommended this video by a friend who raved about it and now I sing it's praises.  I've even just donated the set to my daughter's Kindergarten class and the teacher loves it!,1128902400,3,486,4.616279069767442

1943267,5,B0000TG98I,"This was the best buy we made for my daughter last christmas. After a year she is still watching these DVD's.

After watching these DVD's twice she knew the whole alphabet and all the sounds of the letters. The word factory had actually encouraged her to start writing and putting leters together to form words. I recomend this product to everyone and hope people have as much succes as we had with my daughter. Im looking foward to purchasing the new DVD's this year.",1100476800,,468,4.571428571428571
1943268,5,B0000TG98I,"We just found these dvds at our library and i was fascinated at how great these are.  My son is 5 and has just begun to put sounds and words together.  In this dvd in a matter of minutes he was reading and putting words together like a pro.<br />
The great thing is that it kept his attention from beginning to end.  At the end they even have an interactive game for the tv.  Must buy!!!",1100476800,,387,3.987012987012987
1943269,5,B0000TG98I,"This 2 Disk, Leap Frog dvd Set is a Great Learning tool for all little ones.

We bought it for our 2 year old daughter and she really loves it!  She is already making a Great improvement on her vocabulary after only watching it a few times.

The dvds explore the alphabet and the sounds the different letters make.  As well as putting the letters together to make small words.

~ The characters are cute and friendly and the graphics are very colorful.  Add all that along with their ""catchy"" music and these dvd's are a great way to keep your little ones busy learning and Having Lots of Fun!

He knows his letters, the sounds they make, and he can also write his letters. I'm looking forward to the next set of Dvd's and so is he.",1097107200,,270,3.593220338983051
1943271,5,B0000TG98I,"Add me to the list of folks raving about these videos. Our 2.5 year old son is sounding out words. We don't let him watch much TV but these videos pass the test with flying colors.  They are entertaining, well-crafted with good production value and educationally sound. I did my graduate work in children's educational media and I give these highest honors.

Also worth checking out: the ""Little Leap"" frog that teaches letter names and phonics.  Our son's been playing with that since before his 1st birthday and he learned letters and phonics from it long before we started letting him watch videos.",1095120000,3,601,4.815533980582524
1943272,4,B0000TG98I,A good friend of mine recomended that I buy this DVD set for my Kindergartener.  She loves it.  I am impressed with how fast she is learning her ABC's and the sounds they make.  Thank you Leap Frog!!,1095033600,,199,4.184210526315789

8002577,2,B0000TG98I,"This item I am sure would have been great.  But, after about 2 or 3 weeks of waiting with this item on back order I never got the product.  So, it is hard to actually reaview it.  I did end up just purchasing the DVD by itself and my twins liked it ok.  They really don't watch it that often though.  It is ok but a little expensive on the price if you ask me.",1264982400,,360,3.7466666666666666
8002578,5,B0000TG98I,My son really loves these videos and when we first got them he wanted to watch them every day. I think they definitely helped him learn his letters and words. He loves books and anything with the alphabet. I would totally recommend these for any parent who's child is ready to learn letters.,1251158400,,291,4.509433962264151
8002579,5,B0000TG98I,"I was so not sure when I bought this and even played it to myself as to how it would go down with my just barely turned 2 y.o. son. WOW BOOM BOOM .. I so totally was taken aback when he became fixated by this DVD and would make me play it again and again .. and next thing WOW he knew the entire alphabet and their phonetics in under 2 weeks as someone else said .. Within that time he was picking out letters anywhere and everywhere he saw them.

I thought it was magical .. THANKS guys who made this DVD ... I am now going to collect ALL the stuff the Leap Frog guys have put out there.

So FIVE STAR!!!",1227225600,,605,3.832
8002580,5,B0000TG98I,MY LITTLE GIRL LOVED THIS GIFT BOX. SHE CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF THE VIDEOS AND THAT CUTE PLUCH FROG. THERE IS A BOOK THAT IS NOT MENTION IN THE INFO ABOUT THIS PRODUCT THAT IS IN THE GIFTBOX. THE BOOK GIVES HERE SO MUCH JOY AND TO SEE HER LEARN AND ENJOY THIS MAKES ME FEEL GREAT AND I'M SO GLAD I GOT THIS PRODUCT. IN THE FUTURE I HOPE TO SEE AND BUY MORE LEAPFROG FOR MY DAUGHTER'S LEARNING AND ENJOYMENT.,1201046400,,403,3.926829268292683
8002581,4,B0000TG98I,"After watching this once, I decided that my 17-month old daugher is too young to appreciate it, and may let her see it when she is a few months older.

The package came slightly smashed, but the contents were okay.  There is a small frog doll and a small board book that is for the letter factory.  The book follows the video.

We haven't viewed the Talking Words video yet.

The Letter Factory is a cartoony video of Leap's family of frogs, and they have to prepare for a presentation to some important person.  The youngest frog child can't read yet, and gets into trouble.  Then, he meets the scientist character who then proceeds to show him around into each room that has each letter, and they sing a song that is very repetitive and gets boring after a while.  It gets really boring so you might not want to watch the whole thing as my daughter really lost interest in it about 1/4 of the way through the alphabet.

The cartoon quality of the video seems a bit dated and there are no special effects to the graphics.  I would say it's a safe video for toddlers.  The vocal quality of the video isn't that bad, and isn't that great either, but bearable.

I can see how this video would probably help my daughter in her attempts to talk.

Overall, I would recommend this, although I would stick to the age range on the product, which is 2-5 years.  My daughter liked the doll a lot, and has looked at the board book several times.",1185235200,,1434,4.342105263157895
8002582,5,B0000TG98I,"My 2-year old son watches this video at least twice a week and without me teaching him anything he can recognize about half the alphabet and their sounds.  With a little work, we'll have them all in a short time.  He's only been watching the video a few weeks.  I'm very satisfied with this product and almost all other Leap Frog Products.",1174348800,,339,4.435483870967742
8002583,5,B0000TG98I,"I bought Letter Factory for my son when he turned two years old.  Within a month, he was able to recognize most of his letters and was able to verbalize the entire alphabet from A to Z.  He loved this video and constantly watched it for two years.  He is now four and I am going to purchase Talking Words Factory for him since he is in Pre-K, now.  We have given Letter Factory to my two-year-old niece and she loves it, too.  My son didn't want to give it to her, though, because he often watched it and can't now that she has it.  I'm going to purchase this set for my son for Christmas so he will have both videos.  I'm sure the second will be as wonderful for him as the first was.",1161820800,2,685,3.9926470588235294
8002584,5,B0000TG98I,"No matter what I did to try and help my 3 year old daughter learn her ABCs she wasn't able to grasp every single one. I don't know how she could work the DVD player just from watching me use it twice, but not know all of her ABCs after the several months and various songs/toys we used (including Leap Frog's Fridge Phonics set which had worked to an extent). She'd repeat the song with me, but often skipped several letters. After watching the Letter Factory a few times she not only learned more letters, but their sounds too!

We've retired Letter Factory after only a short couple of months because she mastered her letters (and their sounds) already. We moved onto Talking Word Factory next. It's a little harder for hewr to grasp, but since she's only 3.5 I don't expect her to be spelling words. However, whenever we pass letters she'll call them out, and if I tell her what the word is she'll repeat it. Now everytime we pass a stop sign I get to hear, ""S T O P Stop!"" followed by a lot of giggling.",1154736000,3,1007,4.3
8002585,5,B0000TG98I,My daughter got Letter Factory and Code Word Caper for her 3rd birthday and I wished I'd had them sooner!  She has learned so much from these videos.  I now give them and the other titles to everyone else's kids as they turn 2!,1134604800,,227,4.136363636363637
8002586,5,B0000TG98I,"We have all of the Leapfrog videos and I can not recommend them enough.  Certainly it is some of the best educational programming out there.  [Read the individual reviews for each product to see how many 5 Star votes and thumbs up these products get.]

In the Letter Factory, children are introduced to all of the letters in the alphabet and their sounds.  In the Talking Word Factory, children are taught how words are formed using vowels and consonants.

Five Stars.  My children and their friends simply love these videos.  And what amazes me is that my 2.5 year old went from having no knowledge of the alphabet, to being able to identify all of the capital letters and their sounds in under 2 weeks.  Great gift.",1134172800,5,717,4.590551181102362
