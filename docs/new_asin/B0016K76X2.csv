8262788,3,B0016K76X2,"Supposedly dubbed, but only sub-titled. Simple cross-dressing harem comedy. Decent art, reasonable stories. Doesn't bring a lot of new angles to the party.",1440547200,,155,5.782608695652174

8262790,5,B0016K76X2,"In my opinion, this story is a nice blend between ""Strawberry Eggs"" and ""Strawberry Panic"" where you have an unusaul situation for the main charactor to cope with and over-come. The Main charactor has a fun secret that gets more exciting as the story goes on. There's a little love, warm hearted comedy, a little bit of sadness, and a happy ending! Just a light and fluffy, fun, heart-warming anime. -My Kind of story! ^_^",1227916800,4,422,4.64
8262791,4,B0016K76X2,"When Mizuho hears that his recently deceased grandfather wished him to attend a prestigious private school, Seio Academy, as his last dying wish, Mizuho was prepared to fulfill it. But then he finds out that Seio is a girls only school, and he has one small problem....Mizuho is a guy! Mariya, his best friend since childhood, already attends Seio, and quickly slaps our hapless hero into make-up and and a dress, bringing his already feminine features and body shape to the fore. Mizuho reluctantly agrees to go along with it, but the question is, will the girls at school see through his disguise? Only the headmaster and his homeroom teacher know his real gender. Mariya is there to make sure he doesn't slip into any boyish mannerisms, like peeing standing up, or playing too rough during PE. He meets two other dormmates, Yukari and Kana. Yukari is Mariya's ""sister"". Much like Maria Watches Over Us, at Seio Academy, there is a big sister/little sister dynamic in which an upperclassman becomes the guardian and guide for a lower classman. Mizuho's sister is the charming and cute Kana, who sports a bow that looks suspiciously like cat ears. There is one girl, Shion, that sees through Mizuho's deception almost instantly. She's kinda like the school princess, and was its ""Elder"" last year before she became sick and had to give up her position. The Elder of the school is the highest social position and honor you can attain at Seio, which ranks even above the student body president. Incredibly, Shion agrees to keep Mizuho's secret, mainly because she thinks Mizuho is a nice person. Things heat up politically when Mizuho's friends nominate him to be this year's school Elder, much to the consternation of Takako, the student president.

Otoboku seems to be a title that uses its premise as an excuse to show fan service and girls snuggling, or I mean, girls and cross dressed boys snuggling together. There is a bit of fan service, and even Shion, who seems to be the ideal of respectability and elegance, has a perverted streak and enjoys feeling Mizuho's fake boobs. In fact, we don't really find out what exactly Mizuho is sporting under his shirt. Did he get implants? It would seem like this would be the first thing that would tip off these touchy feely girls. The fact that Mizuho is able to pull off his disguise seems a bit far fetched, but stranger things have been chronicled in the annals of anime. And what possible reason could a grandfather have to make his grandson dress up as a girl and attend a school where all kinds of civil rights violations and abuses could occur? Thankfully, Mizuho is a nice guy and not a horn dog, so he tries to keep his life clean and family friendly. The fact that the girls surrounding him think he will make a good Elder after knowing him just for a few days also seems a bit crazy.",1225584000,,2843,4.674650698602794
8262792,5,B0016K76X2,"Now this one is a weird one, how can a young man fulfill his grandfathers desire to graduate from the same school as his mother did?  Easy have his childhood friend dress him up as a girl.  the reason is that the school is an elite school for girls.  not only does he have to act ladylike (especially when he has to go to the restroom), he has to work hard to keep it a secret.  while his friend, the headmistress and homeroom teacher knows, what will happen when one of the most respected girls in his class figures it out.  Then throw in that he is a candiate to be the Elder (the ""big sister"") for the school, and also a ghost who was in love with his mother, this story has lots of laughs.

now while I first though it would be bad since the only track is in japanese with subtitles, i realized that the english language could not handle the nuances of the script.  I can not wait to see the next disk",1217635200,,905,4.0790960451977405
