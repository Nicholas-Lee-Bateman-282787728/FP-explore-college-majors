8625232,3,B00GO2M8QW,"This is a made for TV SyFy movie. A group of tourists are tricked into entering a realm filled with the characters from Grimm's fairy tales, with some slight modifications such as the seven dwarfs being cannibals. The film seems to be geared toward kids with some mild swearing. As they search for a missing infant, the stories take their toll.",1388102400,2,344,4.655737704918033
