628819,5,6303338569,"This legendary Emmy-winning 1978 TV miniseries is remarkable for many reasons, not the least for featuring Meryl Streep in an early role. Here she wears long blonde-auburn hair and is very focused. Perhaps her ambition explains the lack of affectation so wearying in her star performances. Playing a Polish Catholic with ironic comparisons with her later Sophie's Choice, she uses her American accent. In fact the international cast which includes James Woods, Fritz Weaver, Sam Wanamaker, Rosemary Harris, Ian Holm, David Warner and Michael Moriarty are a mix of accents but it does not jar since the script by Gerald Green and the direction by Marvin J Chomsky are so good. The video release  is 3 tapes and 7.5 hours long, presenting the story of the members of the Jewish Weiss family as they live and die through Europe from 1935-1945. Cynics may baulk at the chance of someone being present or involved in every major event but Weiss is a big family and the approach personalises historical abstraction. I particularly like Green's insight into Nazi internal politics, the fact that there is no Hitler character, and Chomsky's decision not to show inside the gas chambers. Any attempt would be a disappointment and seeing someone eyehole it and then describe it as like ""Dante's Inferno"" allows you to imagine your own nightmare. A moving and intelligent must see. It should be noted that the original series ran 9.5 hours.",992131200,22,1429,4.97907949790795
628820,5,6303338569,"I didn't watch the video ( It was on when I was two or three years old), but I read the book, Holocaust, that was based on the miniseries. Based upon the book, I think that the story was exciting and sad.  For instance, I read that the characters Uncle Sasha, Zalman, and other fought the Nazis in Warsaw,from 1942-43. Also, the way that Eric's uncle realized the truth about the Nazis' "" final solution"", while managing his plant.
I hope that I will have a chance to watch the miniseries on basic television, such as Channel 26, 11, or 38. Nevertheless, I like the book, and hopefully the miniseries.

628821,5,6303338569,"I was absolutely captivated from beginning to end with this movie.  In fact, so much so that I watched this movie from beginning to end in one sitting(all 7 1/2 hours).  This movie gives you a good idea of what it was  like to live in Germany from 1935-1945 as a Aryan German and a Jew, by  following two German families in during this time period.  The characters  in this movie are very real and very believable.  The plot and acting is  excellent.  I highly reccomend this movie.",961545600,8,482,4.386363636363637
628822,5,6303338569,"The story related in this film is nothing new. What is (to me at least) unique about it is the way it is presented.
We follow two families from the rise to power of the Nazi party in German (circa 1934 or so) to the end  of World War II. The Weiss family (a Jewish family) and the Dorf's, who  portrays an SS family man's perspective.
As the film unfolds we are  treated to the unjustness, apprehension and then horror to which the Jews  of Europe were subjected -- thru the experiences of the family Weiss -  their family slowly broken up and sent away, first to ghettos, then  ultimately to the death camps.
On the other side, we see where a  'typical' SS man comes from. Erik Dorf is an unemployed lawyer whose wife  is sickly (and under the care of Dr Josef Weiss) without even the liklihood  of a job. Concerned with how to pay his debts, he ends up a lieutenant of  the SS working directly for Heydrich.
What is most interesting to me in  the story is the transformation of young Dorf from a conscientous young man  with high hopes into an SS Major, a merciless killer. It provides an  insight as to why so many were anxious to wear the black uniform of the SS.  One has to ask the question, ""What would I do if I were living in  those times and in that situation? Would I speak out and end up in a labor  camp with the outcasts, or would I follow society and try to survive the  turmoil?"".
Characterizations are good and wholly believable. There  is much which tells of the dilemma some of the German aryan people must  have felt. For instance, Inga Helms Weiss -- aryan wife of the Jewish Karl  Weiss; 'Uncle' Kurt Dorf -- who tried to keep a handful of Jews from  Auswitz's death chambers; and Father Lichtenberg -- a christian priest who  spoke out for the Jews and their plight.
If you'd like to understand what  human beings must have felt and had to endure in Nazi Germany - on both  sides of the fence - this is a good film to watch. If you're looking for an  action story, you'll be disappointed.

628823,4,6303338569,"This aired as a mini-series on NBC back in the 1978 - 1979 time frame, before VCRs were really household gadgets.  It haunted me then and I never forgot it.  I look for a long time before locating a copy of it to see it  again.  I honestly believe that this telling of the events had more of an  impact on me than did ""Shindler's List"".  I don't say that to  distract from it, but to add credibility to this feature.  I think it takes  about seven hours to watch it from end to end, but it is riveting and  unforgetful.  It's not Hollywood's special effects, it is GREAT acting and  an awesome chain of events that makes this worth watching.",948844800,11,641,4.206611570247934

It really stuck with me through the years, especially as Meryl Streep and James Woods, who play the lead characters, became big stars. I was reminded of the series whenever I saw them in movies. When I finally came across the DVDs on Amazon, I immediately ordered them. The story of a Jewish doctor, his wife, 2 sons, a daughter and a German daughter-in-law set in Berlin and Eastern European locations during the Nazi years is moving, tragic and riveting.

CBS Home Video -  Paramount Studios -big names, right?  You would expect decent quality, wouldn't you?  Well, you would be wrong.  The miniseries itself holds up pretty well considering that it was made for broadcast on one of the three major networks of the time.  I think it's something everybody should see at least once but the quality of this release borders on criminal. I truly believe this was mastered from a second or third generation vhs copy.  The end credits are so blurry you can hardly read them.  That's how fuzzy it is.  Whoever the mastering engineer was on this project, he or she should be ashamed.  They would have done better to simply copy the hootleg and issue it  as a pressed (as opposed to a burned) dvd.",1504224000,,926,4.3882352941176475

629226,1,6303338569,"I have never before written a review giving only 1 star, but here I must.  I also have to thank Amazon for providing customers with the feedback sectioneven though, because of it, I would not consider buying this DVD set.  For reasons that make no sense at all, it has been shortened, greatly diluting its historical importance.  It appears there is a Spanish version that might be better, but the price is extreme, and it won't play on most US DVD players.  As many of the serious reviewers correctly point out, a full and accurate DVD version is absolutely necessary.  I wouldnt even mind the original commercials being included!
For most, the reason to buy Holocaust is for its importance in history, more than for any dramatic excellence it might have.  In fact, it is obvious that many of those reviewers who did not see the series in its original broadcasts in the late 1970s criticize the program for its less than perfect productiondrama has improved since then in many cases.  But, in German modern history (and even somewhat in the USA), I believe Holocaust was a landmark.  Confirmation from TV scholars is needed, but during my service in the Army in Heidelberg Germany 1980-1984 many Germans, both old and young, told me that the broadcast of this series contributed to the first ever major review among Germans of the WW II era.  After all, it was their parents and grandparents who were involved.  I was often told that, in German schools, before this series, history teaching stopped with 1918.  After this series, interest in getting some perspective on the horrors of WW II went nationwide.  Today, Germany and Germans are among the strongest proponents of avoiding wars.  I should remind more chauvinistic Americans that there are only cultural and historical differences, not genetic differences, between us and the Germans who were swept up by the Hitler eraso we all should learn how we too are all susceptible to horrible behavior if cultural and historical events were to become as extreme as in post-WW I Germany and the Great Depression.  This series is not just entertainment; in context, it can humble any serious viewer.  But to have that value, it must be a true and complete version of what was originally produced.  So, as for this film, Ill have to wait for a more accurate edition, hopefully also at a reasonable pricemaybe even with some scholarly extras.  In the meantime, Ill shop elsewhere on Amazon.",1462233600,5,2438,4.836144578313253

629290,1,6303338569,"I saw the following comments written by a Polish Jew, Sigmund Gorson, about the movie.  It addressess the problems that I see with the movie, namely the despicably false depictions of Poles.  This is a propaganda movie, comparable in the hate mongering category to the Nazi produced Heimkehr.  Hereon are the comments of Mr. Gorson:
No one in the world can alter the truth, therefore, regardless of the consequences, I refuse  to keep my silence any longer.  When I see and hear the Jewish producers of the Holocaust series together with the so-called self-appointed Jewish Leaders perpetrating upon the American people, Christians and Jews alike, a horrendous lie which is an assault and desecration to the millions of Christians and Jews who perished together during the greatest calamity on earth, and tragedy of mankind, to say the least, I can no longer remain silent.
They did not even show one percent of the naked brutal truth.  There were no smiling faces, no women with men in the camps, no love stories, there was only systematic murder, wholesale slaughter, mass rapes of young girls and women in the presence of their husbands, children and parents; conveyorized hangings and burning alive of men, women, children, Jews and Christians.  The hero of the Warsaw Jewish Ghetto Uprising, Mordechaj Anielewicz, was not an ardent Zionist, as depicted in the series, he was an ardent youthful leader of the Communist party of Warsaw.  It is perfectly clear to me, that the series was produced, filmed and shown to deliberately malign Poland, and its valiant people with the dastardly accusation of helping the Nazis destroying the Polish Jews.

The series showed how a Jewish partisan of the Warsaw Ghetto paid a Pole a large sum of money to buy weapons.  The Polish freedom fighter supposedly gives the Jew one empty revolver to fight the Nazis.  Then the very same night of showing this terrible lie, only thirty minutes later, the Jewish Ghetto defenders are fighting the Nazis with machine guns, flame throwers and grenades.  And who do you think gave the Jews those weapons?  The Bad Poles, of course.  Who saved thousands of Warsaws Jews from Nazi death, taking them through the sewers of Warsaw to freedom, risking their very own life?  The Bad Poles, of course.  Who brought food and water at great and unbelievable odds to the starving and persecuted Jews throughout Poland?  The Bad Poles, of course!  The fabricators of lies and, innuendoes, smears and unjustified attacks upon Poland and the Polish people also showed on that same night, several soldiers who were dressed in typical uniforms of the Polish military shooting  and executing Jewish women and men while the victims were strapped to chairs.  Only God can forgive these filthy perpetrators and merchants of lies and hate directed against everything that a Poles holds dear in his heart.  These same writers and producers of the Holocaust did a pretty good hatchet job on the Poles by intimidation, or did they?  They were desperately trying to blame Poland and the Polish people for the Jewish tragedy before the vast American viewing audience, Christians and Jews.",1448755200,4,3144,4.982758620689655

While I give this series 5 stars, I believe that the series Winds of War and War and Remembrance are a better series.  They cover a total of about 18 DVDs and because of the length they do a much more thorough job of covering the Holocaust.

I really didn't have an understanding at all of the Holocaust until I watched the mini series in 1978.  It gave me a basic understanding of what happened.  But when I watched Winds of War / War and Remembrance in the 1980, I got a thorough understanding of the Holocaust.

As time goes on the lawyer becomes more of a monster without intending to but realizing he must in order to fit in with the evil regime he has become a willing part of.  The family Weiss are torn apart with their oldest son arrested and put in a Concentration camp while the younger son leaves home to fight the Nazis as a Partisan in the Ukraine.  There are may twists and turns in the plot and it shows the best and worst qualities of many of the characters.

629515,4,6303338569,"This is an in-depth, personal account of the Holocaust as I have never seen before.  It chronicles the impact of the war on specific individuals  the family Weiss, some friends they make along the way and one Nazi family named Dorf.  You will come to care for the Weiss family and their friends as they face atrocious cruelty and death with grace and dignity.  Dorf and his wife, however, you will despise. The Nazis often comment they cannot understand why the Jews are so cooperative, noting they don't fight back at every turn.  Given the malevolent Nazi mind-set, it is easy to see why they could not recognize estimable character traits like dignity.  After the war is over, picking up the pieces would seem a most impossible task.  Yet, survivors still managed to smile and even find a little joy.

Having spent hours in the Holocaust Museum in Washington DC, I can attest to the authenticity of the black and white clips shown to the Nazi leadership as proof their subordinates were doing their jobs.  The nonchalant attitude of the Nazis throughout is emotionally chilling and, from what I have heard survivors state, a quite accurate portrayal.  When asked about understanding evil, I once heard an Amish man say that he didn't try to figure it out because what you understand you risk becoming.  Hitler, Himmler, Heydrich and Eichmann were utterly evil men whose minds I hope never to fathom.

If you are looking for a war movie, this is not for you.  There are some energizing battle scenes between the Zionist Resistance and the German troops, but the focus of this series is primarily along the line of personal struggles and the will to survive.  This is a mini-series you will not soon forget.  (I would advise teens to adult age range.)

629688,5,6303338569,"Holocaust, 1978 film

This was filmed on location in Germany and Austria. It uses the history of two fictional families to portray the atrocities during the Third Reich from the 1930s to 1945. The three DVDs have five parts that run for 7.5 hours. Did it try to cover too many topics and run too long? Yes, but it is educational not a history record; you need a book for that.

Part 1 introduces the characters. This is the story of the Weiss family. The Gathering Darkness. There is a wedding reception outdoors. The conversations tell about the people (note their facial expressions). Old news films are shown. What else can they do? [No mention of the Great Depression and its effects on people.] They show Kristallnacht: broken windows, burning books, and attacks on Jews. Property is confiscated, even insurance payments. A priest asks for a prayer for the Children of Abraham and warns against a newspaper; people walk out of church. He is warned. What will you do when they come for you? People are expelled to Poland.

Part 2 continues this story. Can a wife get in touch with her imprisoned husband? Rudy leaves his family. People are pushed into a house which is then set on fire! Real photographs are shown. Does fomenting hatred have a political purpose? [Can you think of recent examples?] Mental patients are given a treatment. Inga pays to get a letter to her husband. The SS makes plans for special treatment of certain types of peoples. They don't want witnesses with photographs of the murders. Dorf tidies up in the field.

Part 3 shows life in the Ghetto in Warsaw. They learn of the murders in Russia but don't believe it. Smugglers are punished harshly. Some will resist. They show movies of the killings. The Nazi occupation of Kiev has unexpected problems. There is another mass killing in Babi Yar: men, women, and children. Its resettlement. A messenger brings news about mass killings in other areas and advises resistance. You must buy guns. More historic photographs are shown. The Fuehrer gave an order for a final solution. They show Terezin, which is used for propaganda purposes because of its good conditions. Are there more efficient ways of killing? Does Heydrich know too much? Jewish Partisans acquired guns and ammunition.

Part 4 continues at Terezin. Can the Jews of Warsaw obtain weapons and ammunition? In 1942 Heydrich was killed. America entered the war. Inga is sent to Terezin to see Karl. The Nazis will send 6,000 Jews a day frm the Warsaw Ghetto to a resettlement camp in Russia (but its Treblinka). There is no news about this on the BBC radio (its not for publication). Doctor Weiss selects a few for the clinic, they are unfit to travel. The SS investigates those drawings, the artists are taken away to a jail. Will beating make them talk? We learn details about the mass murders at Auschwitz. Absolutely fantastic says the Professor. Doctor Weiss clinic will be dismantled. In Warsaw Jews prepare for an uprising and bargain for arms.

Part 5 shows the surgery on a man under primitive conditions. A suitcase of pistols arrives in time, so too grenades. This allows the capture of more arms. Then the prisoners are sent to the showers, babies too. I only follow orders. The Jews shoot at the soldiers in the street. The soldiers return after dark in force. The shooting begins again. Mortars explode, but the SS are repelled again. The Jews fight on. They send a message for help, but it is stopped. Some decide to leave the buildings and are captured by the Nazis. Move over to the wall! Take hands. There is a volley of rifle fire. The Nazis eat dinner and complain about the smell from the chimney. Railroad trains are used for transporting Jews to the extermination camps, not for army supplies. Jewish Partisans plant a mine in the road, but it is detected! Rudy is captured and put in a camp.

The Red Army prisoners trust Rudy (in Sobibor). The SS high command discusses the policy on Auschwitz and other resettlement camps. The experienced soldiers in Sobibor know what to do and when to do it. Arms are acquired from the enemy and then returned. The prisoners escape, but Rudy does not go with them. The next scene is after the war. Major Dorf is questioned. The Poles and Russians want Dorf for the atrocities (shown in the photographs). Dorf takes a powder. His wife gets a letter. Was Dorf a hero or a War Criminal? Later Inga meets Rudy after the war. Rudy is offered a job as a shepherd for Greek orphans. He has the work experience. One reason for the Nuremberg Trials is to reveal to the world just what happened in Nazi Germany. No one could no longer express disbelief.

I have some comments (not complaints). Most of these prisoner look too well-fed compared to the actual captives (but I do not expect actors to be starved for realism, maybe some make-up could have been used. It takes a good guy with a gun to stop a bad guy with a gun seem to be the message of this movie. Is this why it is never shown on broadcast television? I read that Jaws had some electronic editing to remove the firearms shown in some scenes. How much has changed since the 1970s?",1417392000,,5132,4.644273127753304

Dealing first with German Jews good lives in Germany and their loyalty, Hitlers rise to power and the dissilusioment that follows as the Nuremberg Laws and boycott of Jewish Goods is in effect, and event after event in the order it would have unfolded in history is demonstrated.

Its a great introduction and I used it as a visual aid for teaching my daughter the basics of the Holocaust a and after playing say an hour at a time for my daughter when she was a teen, demonstrate what was happening and add my own studies of the subject to her knowledge of The Holocaust. And then view documentaries which would go in further depth and now that she has the skeletal outline via the movie, she could get down to the nitty gritty of that horrible era.

The story of the younger son of the Doctors activities I could then supplement with the Documentary ""Partisans of Vilna""

The eyewitnesses she could listen too in the Documentary ""Shoah"" and see and hear from real German Jews and not be too surprised that the TV characters were actually based on people living and dead.

At that time, I was very disappointed by the lack of closure for the characters at the end of the movie. But because I'd seen it on TV, in what I assumed was syndication, I just thought that some of the scenes had been cut in order to make room for more commercials and that I'd get to see those scenes when it was released on home video (or later on, on DVD or Blu-Ray). But several years later, when the movie was finally released on DVD, and I bought one, I saw that the ending of the movie was still just as abrupt as the version I saw on TV, and was hugely disappointed to read that the DVD ""may be edited from its original network version"". Since I wasn't even born yet, when the network version aired, I never got to see that version, so I had no way of knowing what scenes had been cut (and were missing) from the DVD version -- and even though I got an official VHS set that said it was the original full-length version of the movie, the ending was still the same as both the TV version I saw as well as the DVD set.

I have been extremely interested in the subject/era of the Holocaust ever since I was around 9 years old, and I saw some of the concentration-camp scenes in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/War-and-Remembrance/dp/B001CDLATY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">War and Remembrance</a>&nbsp;which had a profound effect on me. Although it gave me terrible nightmares for awhile (as did reading Viktor Frankl's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Man-s-Search-for-Meaning/dp/080701429X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Man's Search for Meaning</a>&nbsp;which I'd read some passages of around that same time) it sparked a very deep & lifelong interest (some family members have even called it an ""obsession"") in the Holocaust.

Although this is a GREAT movie, the DVD release itself is very shoddy! Not only have they admitted that scenes have been cut (though I don't know/can't tell yet what they are) the quality of the video & sound shows how cheaply its been produced and released -- utterly NOT representative of all the technology available at their disposal to remaster the video & sound to modern, digital & even HD standards!

***** 5 STARS for the movie itself!
*** 3 STARS for this MEDIOCRE DVD Release!

**** 4 STARS overall but yet a HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!!

A Story of Hope in a Time of Despair

Oscar winner Meryl Streep, James Woods and Michael Moriarty star in this epic miniseries, winner of numerous awards including eight Emmy Awards, two Golden Globes and a Peabody Award. This three-disc anniversary edition marks the first presentation of the groundbreaking miniseries on DVD.

Holocaust follows the tragedy and triumph of the Weiss famly of Berlin, and intertwines their fate as European Jews with the story of a German family, the Dorfs, whose members include a high-ranking Nazi officer. Filmed on location in Germany and Austria, Holocaust uses the stories of these fictional families to portray the atrocities against the Jewish people from the 1930s to 1945, and presents a heart-wrenching portrait of their struggle.

** POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD!! **

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Holocaust/dp/B00005JMLR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Holocaust</a>&nbsp;is the harrowing & heartbreaking story of two German families from Berlin, prior to, and during World War II -- one a Christian family who become Nazis out of economic necessity, and eventually become bloodthirsty, remorseless mass murderers, and the other, a Jewish family who become their victims, and whose lives are gradually but systematically destroyed in the diabolically evil genocide known as the ""Shoah, or more commonly called the HOLOCAUST.

The ""Aryan"" Dorf family, is headed by Erik (played to CHILLING perfection by Michael Moriarty [of the early seasons of the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Law-Order/dp/B005HU0TBI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Law & Order</a>&nbsp;TV series])  a charming & brilliant, yet unemployed German lawyer who struggles to to find work to support his wife Marta (Deborah Norton) and two young children, Peter and Laura. At the insistence of sickly (but yet, still extremely ambitious-for-her-husband) wife, Erik joins the Nazi Party out of sheer desperation to earn income, but then rapidly advances within the SS, and in a short time, becomes essentially the ""right-hand man"" for Reinhard Heydrich (David Warner) a top-level Nazi and one of the engineers of the ""Final Solution"". As Erik rises up the ranks, and is constantly bombarded with & brainwashed by Nazi ideology, he is soon transformed from someone who, in the beginning, had little to no interest in politics, and is such a meek, mild-mannered & gentle man, that seems the type unable to harm even a fly and becomes a ruthless cold-blooded killer who's main & primary concern is career advancement, and loyalty to ""the Fatherland"" & the Fhrer. Encouraged by Marta, who is insanely obsessed with her husband's ambition (and at least in the beginning, his lack thereof!) and career advancement to the exclusion of nearly everything else, Erik abandons all morals, empathy, values & ethics, and is able to not only justify but order and even actively participate in the slaughter of millions.

The other family is the completely assimilated German-Jewish, and at least in the beginning, the middle to upper-class Weiss family, headed by Dr. Josef Weiss (Fritz Weaver) a Polish-born & raised, general physician, and his cultured, aristocratic, and usually domineering German-born & raised wife, Berta (Rosemary Harris), who came from a ""Hoch-Deutsch"" family, whose ancestors were ethnic German ""court Jews"" and friends of princes & cardinals. Together, Josef & Berta have three children -- and in the beginning of the book, they are twenty-something artist, Karl (James Woods), teenage athlete & star soccer player Rudi (Joseph Bottoms), and preteen Anna (Blanche Baker)

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Holocaust/dp/B00005JMLR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Holocaust</a>&nbsp;begins in 1935 in Berlin, with the wedding of Karl and and Inga Helms (Meryl Streep) an ""Aryan"" Christian woman. Meanwhile, the unemployed Erik and his ill wife Marta, go to see Dr. Josef Weiss, who diagnoses a systolic heart murmur, and discover that Dr. Weiss had also treated Erik Dorf's parents, as well as Erik during his childhood, decades earlier. Later, unable to find decent employment, and struggling to support his family, at the insistence of his wife, Erik interviews with Reinhard Heydrich for a job in the Nazi Party and as the old saying goes, ""the rest is history!""

Beginning with the wedding of Karl & Inga in 1935, this miniseries spans the period from 1938 to 1945 and covers all the events in the Holocaust, from Kristallnacht to the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, the Sobibor death camp revolt, and ultimately the end of World War II & the liberation of the camps.  It portrays all the crimes of the Nazis, including ""Kristallnacht"", the ""Action T4 euthanasia"" murders of the disabled, the Babi Yar massacres, the deportations to & imprisonment in the ghettos, and of course, the murders of millions in the death camps.

After seeing this TV miniseries, I just felt so bereft at the thought of how many happy & loving families like the Weiss family were ruthlessly destroyed for no reason.

Just like with the majority of the Holocaust-related books or films that I've read or seen over the years, I was left feeling drained, defeated and devastated at how millions of innocent people were senselessly & brutally murdered -- and especially that the rest of the world just sat by  day after day, week after week, and month after month for YEARS and just let it happen, and worse, keep happening. For all the claims & promises of ""Never Again"", the rest of the world has still sat by while genocide after genocide continues to happen -- in Cambodia, in North Korea, in Israel/Palestine, in Serbia/Croatia/Bosnia-Hercegovina, in Rwanda, the Sudan, and Sierra Leone, and in Uganda, the Congo, Darfur and so many others!

Unfortunately, the world seems to have learned NOTHING from the Holocaust, and that is one of the saddest & scariest things of all!! :(",1399680000,10,9035,5.462365591397849

there is a first rate cast - Meryl Streep, James Woods, Michael Moriarty, etc - also, an excellent musicial score by Morton Gould.
Very fine presentation, but not for the faint of heart - there are graphic depictions of the gassing of victims at Auschwitz, and the mass murders committed by Hitler's Special Action Groups [Einsatzgruppen] in conquered Russian territories.

629987,5,6303338569,"I remember when I saw this on TV when it was originally released. I had read Anne Frank and many other histories on WW II. It was shortly after this that discovered that my Father had been involved in the liberation of Buchenwald. My parents and I sat and watched the Holocaust unfold on our televisions. Real people were broadcast to us and we got to know them. At the end of the series we were left in silence to contemplate the loss of lives. Not just to war, but to bitter and pure hatred. This hatred enabled by complacency, a blind eye, ignorance, and indifference resulted in the murder of 6 million Jews. Millions more of the infirm, gypsies, and other so called undesirables were murdered.

All people should watch this movie to learn what unfettered hatred can do to people. Not just the victims but the minions that became animals killing their fellow humans in unspeakable sadistic ways.

630057,5,6303338569,"The television mini series ""Holocaust"" is one that covered the persecution of the Jewish people by the Nazis early on, long before ""War and Remembrance"" came to our small screens and it does it very well. The story follows a family, the Weiss's, and their trials and tribulations across Europe at this brutally difficult time. The series was notable for the appearance of Meryl Streep as a German girl, Inga Helms Weiss, married to a Jewish husband, Karl, James Woods. In four parts the series covers Kristallnacht, the formation of the Jewish ghettos and the later use of Gas Chambers. The cast is uniformly good with Fritz Weaver, Timothy Bottoms, David Warner, T P McKenna and others filling important roles. For me though the outstanding character is Michael Moriarty as Erik Dorff a lawyer who joins the SS and gradually changes from a reasonably decent man to a fanatical Nazi. His showing this change and the smooth, seemingly pleasant face he presents concealing his menacing reality is a formidable acting triumph.
Holocaust is demanding and not always easy to watch but it is excellent for those who have an interest in this period in our recent past and the complexities of the human character which it explores.

My wife and I just finished Fortunes of War and are almost done with War & Remembrance.  This mini-series was quite below par when compared with those two series.  One can see why good writing is important to a mini-series and why Holocaust fell miserably short in this endeavor.  I also didn't understand why the director had some of the key Nazi roles (Dorf, Heydrich, & Eichman) played so one-dimensionally.

630253,4,6303338569,"Holocaust was initially presented as a five part mini series on TV.  The DVD set is the entire series sans commercials.  The story is a TV version of a historical novel about events that occurred between 1935 and 1945.  The fictional part is in color, laced with actual black and white photos of actual scenes.  The family Weiss is a large Jewish family, consisting of a husband, wife, grandfather, two boys, and a girl.  The grandfather is brutalized in one of the Nazi inspired street riots.  The oldest boy, an artist, almost survives the various concentration camps that he was sent to.  The daughter is assaulted on the streets, becomes mentally unstable and is executed in a Nazi mental hospital.  The youngest boy flees Germany into Eastern Europe and survives as a guerilla fighting the Nazis.  The wife, at first, refuses to believe the Nazis were that bad but later actively participates in the Jewish uprizing during the Warsaw ghetto revolt.  The husband, a doctor, emphasizes what it took to survive, yet effectively oppose the Nazi efforts.  Finally the character Dorf is a brilliant starving German, who becomes involved in the Nazi effort in order to feed his family, accepts it, and gradually becomes a fanatic in their nefarious schemes.
The action is well crafted and acting is very well done.  Many of the locations and incidents are historically accurate.  If anybody wants to believe the Holocaust didn't happen, should watch this video.",1348185600,,1459,4.954732510288066

630283,5,6303338569,"This is the story of the Weiss family and The Dorff family during the holocaust.  The Weisses, an affluent well educated Jewish family living in Germany befalls the fate of all Jews living in Germany and Poland during WWII.  The Dorff family is a German family whose fortunes exceed their highest expectations by virtue of their persecution of the Jews.  Dr. Weiss and his family are all well rounded believable characters.  However, Dr. Weiss & his wife tend to view the world through rose colored glasses.  Like most German Jews they did not see the danger coming and believed it would all blow over until it was too late to leave.  I think the reality of what was about to happen was so horrific that people didn't want to believe it. Mr. Dorff who committs grevious crimes both personally and through his policies against the Jewish people is also seen as a good family man singing xmas carrols at home with his family. Mr Dorff is totally deluded in his assessment of his own conduct.  Prior to restrictions preventing Jewish doctors from treating Arayan patients Joseph Weiss treats the Dorff family.  Yet the Dorffs refuse to help them when Dr. Weisses son, Carl, is arrested.  One of my complaints about dramatizations of holocaust experiences is that the people portrayed always look a lot healthier than they were.  These actors were not thin enough for their roles.  Of course, if they had to have visual accuracy the actors would have been on death's door and unable to work.  Still anyone living in the ghettos or the camps were terribly thin and undernourished.  They had myriad bones protuding.  The characters in this movie some of whom like Mrs. Weiss who was plump were not credible.  James Woods who is  normally thin and Meryl Streep were more believable in body type.  The partisans normally healthier than ghetto or camp inmates still subsisted on meager diets of turnips and potatoes.  Rudy, his wife and the other partisans just don't  look like they are living on a subsistance diet.  There were a few Germans and clergy who helped but they were very few in number.  The clergy and the church in general bears substantial responsibility for this calamity.  Not enough Preists spoke out against it and of course, the Vatican which was the first foreign power to sign an accord with Hitler said and did nothing.  For more on this read Constantine's Sword by Carrol.  This is not a movie of happy endings.  Most of the characters perish.  In many families not one member survived Germany's goal of making the world Jew free.  The movie made an excellent point.  Hitler knew that the French and the British would say nothing about his perscution of the Jews, and they did not.  However, he was surprised at how little reaction he got from President Roosevelt.  The Germans were right.  No one wanted the Jews.  They are still right.  Today's anti-semitism is now cloaked in political thought as anti-Israeli sentiment.  Any rational person knowing the facts of the middle east dispute should come down on the side of the Israelis but we all know that Britain and France tend to side with the Arabs in any dispute with the Israelis.  Anti-semitism is alive and well in Europe. It is just wearing a different hat.
Our DVD set is missing some of the beginning footage.  Apparently our DVD set is missing about 1/2 hour of the footage. I don't know if other sets have the footage and ours was just defective.  Still for a good mini-series on the holocaust I recommend this set of DVD's.  We spent an entire afternoon watching the whole series at one sitting with a break for a meal. Yet for a realistic portrait of the horrible conditions in which Jews lived during that time there is no substitute for the documentaries with actual film footage of the real ghettos and the camps.  If you are a teacher using this as a history teaching tool, it must be supllemented with footage of the real camps and ghettos.",1304899200,2,3926,4.700879765395895

630288,4,6303338569,"I just finished watching Holocaust for the first time and have been haunted by bad dreams for 2 days now. The plot is ably covered in other reviews, so I will just talk about one character in the DVD.  The most unforgettable character is the chillingly cold-blooded German, Erik Dorf, played by Michael Moriarty.  His soul-less blue eyes will haunt you long after the story is finished.  One of Heydrich's SS hacks, Dorf is the master of the euphemism- calling the Nazi Final Solution for the annihilation of millions of Jews ""special handling"", calling the death camps ""Family Camps"", justifying his cruel acts as ""just following orders"", the way so many Nazis tried to justify their barbarous deeds. The scenes of the higher echelon Nazi officers reviewing the slides of the various methods of efficiently killing Jews are unfathomable in their coldness and snide comments.

 One particularly unforgettable scene is when various cripples, mental defectives, and psychiatric patients arrive at Haldamar, a ""sanitarium"", who willingly enter a long room where they are summarily gassed to death by carbon monoxide exhaust from a truck engine.  This was one of the early methods of purifying the Aryan race from undesirables. The question has been asked, ""How was it humanly possible?""  There will never be an adequate answer, yet we must never forget!",1297555200,,1350,5.109090909090909

630290,5,6303338569,"For those who may remember the initial airing of this miniseries in 1978 but didn't see it (some of us were more concerned with hitting the discos and learning the lastest dance moves)-- take the opportunity to catch up on what you missed. These characters beautifully represent all the real-life people who were caught up in the madness of WWII Germany. The cast is exceptional, playing both victims and tormentors--believable and very moving. Ms. Streep is generally mentioned most often, and of course earns her accolades, but she's matched every step of the way by the rest of the players. Decades before teen audiences were introduced to her as Peter Parker's Aunt May in the ""Spiderman"" series, Rosemary Harris established a solid career, and as Berta Weiss in ""Holocaust"", she can break your heart with one look. Michael Moriarty and Deborah Norton are horrifyingly convincing as the nice, lower-middle-class couple who fall for the SS propaganda hook, line, and sinker.  Particularly disturbing is a scene showing them singing Christmas carols as a family, around the piano while one child burns photos of the victimized Weiss family in the fireplace. For me, that remains more indelible and monstrous than the usual images of the thin-lipped, cruel SS officers who tortured their victims in the concentration camps...although those scenes are chillingly present as well. Marta Dorf and her easily-manipulated husband Erik represent the most dangerous, unlikely monsters of World War II:  the nice, everyday people who went about their Christian, family-oriented, churchgoing lives while they pretended they weren't actively involved in the slaughter of millions of innocent people....didn't they ever stop to imagine that it could have been their own families, their own children,literally ripped apart?  Well worth your time to see this----the ending is a bit abrupt, but so was life at that time.  It was real.",1292457600,,1921,5.26797385620915
630345,5,6303338569,"POWERFUL saga on TV in '78-emotionally entranced from the 40th Anniversary DVD of Holocaust. Even after seeing it on TV years ago, a revisit is well worth the time. It is a fictional account of families on both sides of the Nazi/Jewish account. It was not really Germany, but political and ambitious desire coupled with individual egos that caused the atrocity to happen. This story is about the families Weiss, Dorf, Helms, Lowy, & the Berlin SS staff.
Years after 9-11, Viet Nam, Korea, well, so many conflicts, the look back at WWII and the systematic annihilation attempt toward the European Jewish population takes on even more significance. Can it happen again? Who will say no?

In this dramatization of wartime relationships, love till death, survival struggles, accountability, and history itself, a fantastic cast was assembled. At the time some of the cast were less known, such as Meryl Streep who did magnificently as Inga. But others, Rudi (Joseph Bottoms), Dr. Weiss (Fritz Weaver), Berta Weiss (Rosemary Harris), and others made you feel a part of their family. Tovah Feldshuh as Helena turned heads with her beauty as well as her emotional acting. Capt/Maj Dorf (Michael Moriarty) was so convincing that you soon got to hate him and his 'kill anyone' drive to promotion. Artist Karl Weiss (James Woods) began a huge career after this performance. The potential for picking out great acting moments is endless over this 3 DVD-5 part miniseries. One bad role was the Weiss youngest, perhaps a writing fault, not acting.

The show is timeless, being a period presentation (1935-45). The division of families and the directions their lives take them, makes this show give a comprehensive look at what took place, not just in Germany, but Poland, Russia, 'work' camps, and more. There is no definitive DVD on the Holocaust topic. ""Schindler's List"" is another that should be seen by everyone for a perspective of what happened, and the fact that not all were to blame.

This is truly a must see for anyone remotely interested in knowing more of the emotion and heartache that was caused by the Holocaust. It got me thinking of my own 3/4 German ancestry, the predominant German community where I live, and the fact that politics can become so corrupted that horror can win over humanity. It's been said that some guilty Nazi participants tried to confess due to the TV airing of this saga series. It's that impacting. it does have a short lighter ending which helps settle the nerves after watching for 7 1/2 hours.

630348,4,6303338569,The original of this series I saw in Germany on German TV and later on armed forces tv.  The series shocked many Germans and was a great success.  I waited quite a while for the release of this series that I loved.  It was moving and realistic.  It was one of the best performances of Streep and James Woods.  I was disappointed with quality of production.  The picture was not as sharp as most 1940's conversions from film to digital format.  Also the missing segments left the series disjointed. The transition form one scene to the next made no sense.  Who ever did this release did not do a favor to this wonderful series.  Young people today are taught such historical gibberish.  A complete Holocaust presentation would show them that there are truly bad people in the world who are not just misunderstood and misguided but who do want to hurt others.

630349,5,6303338569,"This was a miniseries, which makes it rather long but I loved every minute of it. The price was so low for a movie of this length and depth that I was amazed. It's the story of how WWII changed the lives of two families, one German Jews and one German Nazis. They were related by the marriage of a son and daughter and the horror that follows is so true to history, that it leaves you simply stunned that it could have happened at all. It could almost be used as a history lesson. It will draw you in as you watch real photographs of Nazi horror artfully mixed in the movie. It's a tribute to how the Jewish people of that era lived, loved, fought and died.",1259280000,,657,4.10077519379845
630350,5,6303338569,"Excellent 5 part mini series.  This follows the family of a Jewish doctor beginning in Berlin just as the Nazi regime is raising to power. Deportation, Warsaw ghetto, concentration camps, gassing, fighting in the resistance, the story follows each family member. While it cannot actually show the horror, it does give an excellent account of what happened and the progression from prewar life to the ghetto and then the death camps.  It also follows a German man who needs a job so joins the SS and slowly becomes a very cold blooded planner of Jewish extermination.

The cast is top notch and acting excellent. I usually don't watch movies twice but I am now watching this series for the second time.  I like the way it is set up as a series and I watch one episode per evening.

But I was moved by how truly affecting it really is. Although it is a story that deals with the lives of I think 8 different characters, and therefore suffers from a slight loss in character identification, it remains a powerful film. The production values are superb, most of the acting is outstanding, and from what I know of that period in history (via Richard Evans' great books and others I've read) it manages to convey, accurately, the main events through the characters' experiences, and without undue exposition. Having said that, I think one's appreciation of the of the story can be helped by knowing the basic outline of the major events of the period, and the prime players in the Third Reich before watching the film.

Indeed, the 1970's was the time that placed the Holocaust in a dominant position in US culture and education. See Peczkis Listmania: FORGOTTEN HOLOCAUST...

(The cast is made up of German, Polish, Russian, British, Hungarian, and American actors. It is sometimes difficult to understand the dialog without the guide of a glossary of terms.) Some of the acting is a little overdone, but overall, all of the characters are made believable. The historical locations become vivid, also, so much so, that students want to visit these places in 2009. I would highly recommend this film for those just beginning the study of the Holocaust.

630401,5,6303338569,"I remember watching this when I was a junior high student.  It was the first I had heard of the horrible fate of six million European Jews under Hitler's Nazi Europe.  It was so moving and heartbreaking that I remember crying several times.  When I visited the Holocaust museum in Washington, D.C., one of the curators told me that this series really gave Americans their first realistic glimpse of Jewish life in Nazi Germany

I watched it again and was still incredibly moved.  The Family Weiss is the story of many families in 1930's Germany,  Josef, the kind hearted doctor, heads the family, his wife Berta, the strong musically gifted mother, Karl, the shy sensitive artist so in love with his Christian wife Inga, Rudi the hotheaded athlete just coming into manhood and finally teenager Anna.  Paralleling the lives of the Weiss family is the Dorf family, Erik is the up and coming SS man and his wife is the ambitious proud Aryan who totally believes in the new Germany.

This movie unfolds over time and the viewer sees the seeds of Nazi destruction right from the beginning.  Karl, played by a very good James Woods, is married to his wife Inga (Meryl Streep, who is exceptional) right before laws are passed forbidding marriage between Jews and Christians.  Brown shirts are visible even at the wedding.

Soon more anti-Semitic Nazi ideology is sweeping across Germany and the Weiss family is separated, Karl is imprisoned in Buchenwald and Dr. Weiss, a Polish citizen is deported to Poland, even young Anna is separated due to a breakdown.  These scenes are absolutely heart wrenching, especially so is Anna's.

Feeling restless, Rudi leaves the family and joins resistance fighters in Eastern Europe.  Along the way he finds a woman he grows to care for greatly.  The horrors they see of mass killings are nightmarish.

Meanwhile Berta joins her husband in Poland and there they try to piece together a semblance of sanity without their children in Warsaw.  Soon, though the  freight trains headed toward Auschwitz arrive to empty the Warsaw ghetto.

Inga and Karl's love is touching and Inga is willing to do anything to be with her husband, even if it means demeaning herself.  Meryl Streep is fantastic; she adds just the right touch of desperation in her voice whenever she even mentions her husband's name.

The Dorf family's rise to fame is parallel to the Weiss's demise and the amazing part of this story is that these two families know one another, were once cordial and friendly.  So easily Erik Dorf (Michael Moriarty is good as a shy somewhat awkward SS man in the beginning) forgets his scruples all in the name of personal ambition.

630442,3,6303338569,"I am a a student of history and militaria and first saw this programme whilst in hospital in 1978.  When I saw the DVD was available and I had to obtain it for my library as it such a good production.  I could finally 'pension off' my old VHS tapes.

That said, my complaint concerns the uniforms.  The rank collar patches for some of the SS Officers, especially Heydrich, were incorrect and on one occasion an SS-Obersturmbannfuhrer [ Lt Colonel ] is referred to a Major [ SS-Sturmbannfuhrer ].

The black SS uniform was phased out in 1938 and replaced by the field gray to match the Army and Waffen [ armed ] SS formations.  The SS Officers in 'Holocaust' are still, on occasion, seen wearing the black uniform.

The ReichsSicherheitDienst [ SD ] RFSS was the internal and external intelligence and information office and its members wore the field grey uniform and carried SS ranks.  The right hand collar patch in the SS carried the runes but in the SD the patch was black.  The SD was identified by the letters SD inside a diamond shaped badge called a rauter that was displayed on the lower left sleeve of the tunic.

If a member of the SD was also in the Geheime StatsPolizei [ GeStaPo ] the silver letters SD were edged in silver instead of the plain black badge.  When Dorf joined the SS he was depicted with both the SS runes and the SD rauter on his uniform - the two were not worn together.

The collar rank patches for the SS were re-designed in 1942 when a new rank of SS-Oberstgruppenfuher [ eq to the Army's Generaloberst ] was promulgated.  The new rank had three oak leaves pointed inward and three diamond shaped pips.

At the time of his assassination in Prague Heydrich was an SS-Obergruppenfuhrer [ General ] and his collar patches in the later part of the series should have been depicted as three oak leaves pointed inward above two diamond shaped pips.  I don't believe this was accurately illustrated.

I have noticed on many occasions concerning German [ especially SS ] uniforms where accuracy has been ignored.  The SS - Standartenfuhrer  [Colonel ] in 'Indiana Jones/ Last Crusade' was wearing at one time the SS black uniform then, in the desert scenes, a uniform I don't believe ever existed in the SS.  He also had  black lampassen [ stripes on the trouser legs ]- this distinction was only for generals.  I may be wrong but I believe the SS generals did not have lampassen on their uniforms.

Himmler, Reichsfuhrer - SS, was very pedantic on uniform matters and issued orders that SS men were not to address each other by Army titles, as some did.  Some SS officers also wanted to have coloured piping on their caps to denote their specialist fields [ as the Army did ].  Himmler insisted that the piping was to be silver only.

630649,4,6303338569,"In the early days of the 21st century it is hard for us to imagine, but following World War II the subject of the Nazi holocaust was hardly spoken about.  The majority of those who survived did not speak about the atrocities they witnessed and suffered.

The subject of the holocaust began to appear in literature in the late 1950's and 1960's with the publication of ""The Diary of Anne Frank"" and ""Night"" by Elie Wiesel; and later in films such as ""Judgement at Nuremberg"" and the ""Pawnbroker"".  However, by the 1970's universities and high schools began introducing the topic in history and literature classes.  Encouraged by the overwhelmingly postive response from educators, students and the general public, survivors began to tell their stories and thus a genre of literature was born.

As the topic of the holocaust covers a wide swath of geography and time (1933-1945) the mini-series format seemed ideal.  With their success in the mini-series genre in the 1970's NBC decided approach the topic of the holocaust in the same manner.

The stars were aligned when the cast was assembled, as it included:  Meryl Streep, James Woods, Michael Moriarty, Rosemary Harris, Tovah Feldshuh, Tom Bell, Sam Wanamaker, Ian Holm, Robert Stephens, Fritz Weaver, Michael Beck, Blanche Baker & Joe Bottoms.  This brilliant ensemble was made up of classically trained American & British actors all at the top of their game.  Streep was just becoming known having appeared in the ""Deer Hunter"" just before Holocaust and had not yet done ""Sophie's Choice"".  Moriarty and Woods were known as top-notch actors within the industry, but neither had yet attained name recognition, they would later achieve.

Holocaust only faultered in two respects.  It greatly santized historical events and it relied on stereotypes in creating characters.  Bottoms and Feldshuh beautiful healthy looks belied the fact that Rudy and Helena were hiding out in the woods of eastern Europe for 4 years.  The family Weiss are a stereotypical Jewish family.  A renowned Jewish doctor's family; his well-to-do cultured German wife; his sensitive artist son; his lovely daughter, Anna who is supposed to evoke Anne Frank, who plays the family Bechstein; and lastly Rudy, the athlete and fighter, who will be the prototype for the new Jew re-born in Palestine/Israel.

These however, are my only critiques, as everything else about Holocaust was done brilliantly. The musical score is haunting; the writing was clear and strong despite the difficulty of competing plotlines; and the brilliant performances by Wood, Streep & Moriarty are unforgettable 30 years later.

A decade later, Dan Curtis and ABC Television would take on the subject of World War II and the holocaust in greater and more detailed study in Herman Wouk's ""Winds of War"" and ""War & Remembrance"".  My recommendation is to see Holocaust then follow-up with the two ABC programs to see a different and more detailed look at the same events.",1213056000,,2967,5.105590062111801

630655,5,6303338569,"I am so happy this is finally being released on DVD after having been forgotten for so many years. Not only does this movie have some fine actors/actresses (James Woods, Merryl Streep, and more)but it is the most realistic, historically accurate depiction of the events that transpired in Germany and Europe.

Two families (1 Jewish, 1 German) are followed from the mid-1930's until after Worl War 2. Historical events are made especially personal by depicting how events affected one middle class Jewish family who chose to remain in  Berlin after a multitude of Jews had fled. The events surrounding Krystallnacht, Nazi invasion of Poland, Babi Yar, Nazi euthanasia of the mentally ill, Auschwitz, Warsaw Gheto uprising, and Germany's defeat are all well depicted here.

Society here is a microcosm showing all the feelings, events and angles of the Holocaust: Jews who thought the country of Beethoven and Shiller were incapable of inhumanity, Unemployed Germans seeking livelihood who were transformed into evil monsters, drastically changed attitudes of germans towards the Jews as nazism trimuphed, complicity of Jews who collaborated, devoted German war enthusiasts appalled at learning how Jews were treated,and the anti-semitism taht ran rampant within the Polish underground.

This movie also sheds light on  that perennial misguided question asked over and over: Why did the Jews allow themselves to be led like sheep to the slaughter?  This movie shows how  the Holocaust occurred in gradual stages and how Many German Jews especially were the most patriotic and asimilated of all Jews.

A must-see for any Holocaust scholar or ordinary American wanting to understand how it all happened.",1207353600,6,1700,5.340823970037453
630656,5,6303338569,"Finally, this arrives on DVD! I have it on VHS, but some works, like ""Holocaust"", have earned the right to be presented on DVD.

While not entirely historically accurate in the details -- most of the characters are fictional aggregates of real people -- the depiction of the events is realistic and, sadly, not in the least bit exaggerated. If anything, it had to be toned down because the brutality of what transpired is simply too intense for most viewers -- and probably movie-makers -- to stomach.

This mini-series is probably not appropriate for very young children, but it is definitely appropriate for teenagers. A place should be made in history classes (they do still teach history, right?) for viewing and discussing movies like ""Holocaust"" and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Roots/dp/B000NA21S6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Roots</a>. If the school doesn't do it, the parents should.

Before people start thinking that ""Holocaust"" is little more than a thinly-veiled documentary, let me assure you that it's story telling at its best. In fact, there are many stories happening against the backdrop of the holocaust. Some are tragic, some inspiring, some triumphant, and some... well, some personal downfalls are just sweet to savor.

As a counterpoint to this intensely dramatic series, I recommend the blood-chilling&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Wannsee-Conference/dp/6302919789/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Wannsee Conference</a>&nbsp;for a mind-numbing inside look at the event that launched the holocaust proper.

630657,5,6303338569,It is about time this was brought to DVD. As a Professor of Holocaust studies I know that this television mini-series was a turning point in Holocaust awareness and Holocaust education in this country. As a result of this film the American (and German) people became more familiar with and more interested in learning about the Shoah. This motivated many survivors who had never told their story to start telling it because now people were interested in hearing about their experiences.,1204243200,6,486,5.012345679012346
630658,5,6303338569,"I used to teach Holocaust history for about 8 years at the high school level, and have not only read many books on the subject but also watched numerous films on the genre. This 1978 mini-series is in my opinion, one of the best depictions of the Holocaust on screen.

The series is set in Germany right about the time Adolf Hitler and the Nazi party are in power [the period covered is about 1935-45]. The series focusses on the trials of the Weiss family, a prominent Jewish family with the patriarch being a decorated war veteran, a grandmother, two sons, Dr Josef Weiss [Fritz Weaver] and his wife Berta [Rosemary Harris], a pharmacist Moses Weiss [Sam Wanamaker], and three grandchildren, an artist Karl [James Woods], a rebel Rudi [Joseph Bottoms], and young Anna.

The series begins with the celebration of the marriage between Karl [James Woods] and his Aryan wife Inga [Meryl Streep]. The Weiss portray the assimilated Jewish family, they are not particularly religious yet proud to be Jewish, and are at ease with their Gentile friends. Yet, dark clouds are starting to gather over them and the rest of Germany's Jews as the Nazi party's anti-semitic policies are about to be put into action. It begins with little things like Dr Josef Weiss not being able to treat his Aryan patients anymore and things get worse from that point on. Kristallnacht [Night of the Broken Glass] sees the destruction of Jewish property and businesses and worse is to come.

The series tries to portray the gradual persecution of the Jews before the escalation into the horror that became the Shoah. Dr Weiss is deported to Poland, where he ends up with his brother Moses in the Warsaw Ghetto. The other members of the family are also to suffer as Karl the artist is sent off to a concentration camp, leaving his wife Inga desperate to hear news of him. Rudi leaves home to join the partisans, and his mother and sister are left to fend for themselves.

There are some truly horrifying scenes in this series and may not be suitable for younger viewers. Mass murder, such as Jews being burned alive, the Babi Yar Massacre in the Ukraine, and of course the gassings are all portrayed with a high degree of realism that makes one flinch and grieve at the same time for all the innocent lives lost.

The series not only focusses on the Weiss family, for there is a parallel storyline involving a German named Erik Dorff [Michael Moriarty], an unemployed lawyer who at the behest of his wife decides to join the infamous SS, reporting directly to Reinhard Heydrich[ David Warner], the blond beast who was responsible for implementing many of Hitler's sadistic policies against the Jews. We see how Erik keeps justifying the murder of innocents [""We must keep killing them, don't you see? If we stop it's an admission of guilt!], and how he turns out to be such a cold-blooded human with no feelings whatsoever [a brief attack of conscience is soon forgotten]. This is very reminiscent of many of the high-ranking SS officers in history, as Rudolf Hoss, the Commandant of Auschwitz himself remained unrepentant till the end.

I am very glad that this amazing series of such important historic significance is to be finally made available on DVD and i hope that it will portray the series in its entirety with preferably added features such as interviews with the cast etc. A must-have for anyone interested in the Holocaust!

UPDATE: The DVD set contains 3 discs, and is NR. It runs approx. 7 hrs and 29 mins. When I compared my much worn out VHS version with the DVD set, I did notice some missing scenes. I'm not sure why this is so. Another customer actually commented that up to an hour of the original show is missing [?]. Once again, I'm not sure as to the justification for this. Also, there are no bonus features which is a disappointment considering this is the 30 year Anniversary edition. It would have been nice to have some interviews with cast members, the director, producer , even a Making Of segment. The quality of the picture transfer is average. However, despite these flaws, and considering the fact that it has taken 3 decades for this epic mini-series to be released on DVD, I would still recommend ""Holocaust"" as a must-watch for those interested in the genre.",1203638400,272,4267,4.7117962466487935

630735,5,6303338569,"Words fail to describe what this fine production shows as the ""final solution"" was born and grew into the worst example of man's capacity for pure evil. The cast(Joseph Bottoms , James Woods , Meryl Streep , Fritz Weaver , and Michael Moriarty) is stunning as the Weiss family and friends as the story takes us from 1935 til the end of the war in Europe.
  Streep won an Emmy award as James Woods non Jewish wife, who must endure horror after horror in her attempt to keep her husband alive in one camp.  A real stand out is Mr. Moriarty as a friend and a man who works for the Nazi party at the lower level who lets ambition and his wife push him up to the point that he is in charge of the ""camps"". He is soft spoken, almost a wallflower, who cries at the demonstrations of the gas chambers, yet orders new and faster ways of death to be found. It is his role that shows the true horror of the ""solution"", a decent man who lets the ""evil"" spread because he wants to get ahead. His last scene, in a small office surrounded by to American officers trying to justify his role and his horror at their revulsion of him and his speech is one of the best ever put on screen and lays the truth of the story bare. Mr. Moriarty makes a monster very human and even makes you feel sorry for him as the reality of his crime becomes apparent to him and his total meltdown leaves you drained.
  This is not for the faint of heart as nothing is spared and the worst is seen. Even after all these years, the anger at the death of a group of mentally ill persons in the back of a van, wells up and as the film moves on the feeling that this couldn't have happened gives way to the sad truth that it did happen and if not watched has and will happen again.

The year before, my girlfriend had told me the story of her
Father's escape from Poland to Denmark as an infant, sometime during this
horrible ordeal.

Her Father was blue eyed, and very blond, nevertheless Jewish.
This account, as well as just being around the Jewish kids at
school and the Jewish stores in the Richmond district
in San Francisco, made the series interesting, and heartfelt.

Had it not been for this series,
and Jeanie, I might have had little or no interest at all
about the persecution of other groups of people besides
my own.

An interesting side note;
Her father was blessed to have been spared the fate of so many
others,
however was still affected negativly, I'm sure in many ways,
but with certainty, he hated black people,
she never explained to me why he felt that way,
but my imagination says you could probably not survive
the Holocaust without some psycological challenges.

I'm ending by saying that I enjoyed all the positive reveiws

No one metioned that the late great MARIUS GORING

The parallel sagas keep the story interesting.  It is not a stylized drama; it does not gloss over the ugliness of Europe during the period but it does not glory in violence and gore.  It also provides a few interesting moments on the German side, as the tensions, rivalries, and ultimate destruction of the Gestapo/SS elite are explored.

Interestly, I moved to Germany one year later and visited Dachau which forever seared visual images of remnant horrors that took place there  and many concentration/death camps spread throughout Germany and other parts of Europe. Unbeknownst to me at the time, this movie and subsequent visit to Dachau, sparked an incredible thirst for historical knowledge and understanding surrounding WWII, Nazi Germany, Adolf Hitler/Third Reich, anti-semitism, and racial-superiority/inferiority.  As one who has spoken with Holocaust survivors and have lectured to a group on Yom HaShoah (Day of Remembrance)I realize the Holocaust encompasses a lifetime of study that proves to be significantly valuable to this present day and for the future.
  It is not enough to view this and simply say ""aww, that's sad"", rather should be a wake-up call for people to understand the Holocaust from a proper perspective as the same ideals, philosphies, rhetoric, values, beliefs, pseudo-science, and psuedo-religious mindsets that lead to and enabled such atrocities continue to thrive in modern societies throughout the world.",1161734400,3,1262,5.4512820512820515

630793,5,6303338569,"This was enthralling television at its best; Streep and Moriarty were at the top of their form.  The cinematography is excellent, and the story is chilling and heart-breaking.  It puts the shameful horror of the holocaust into personal stories of all sides.

The fact that this miniseries is not available on DVD is unfortunate; I think many would like to watch this again, or for the first time.  While the subject matter is depressing, it's important for all of us to face even the most unpleasant episodes in human history, to feel kinship with those harmed, and to be aware of the danger of this horror repeating itself.

Highly recommended, if you can find a copy.  Please bring this out on DVD soon!",1109289600,6,705,4.691056910569106

630845,5,6303338569,"The ""Holocaust"" mini-series is still the most accurate depiction of the Jewish plight during the Second World War.  The Holocaust mini-series was NBC's answer to ABC's ""Roots"".  Although the mini-series is over seven hours long, it never misses a beat.  The mini-series is over 25 years old and it can hardly qualify as dated.  The only thing that remains is a crisp DVD transfer. For the time being if one wants the best picture quality available, I recommend tracking down a copy recorded in SP.

""Holocaust"" is very appealing due to its historical accuracy and completeness.  The time span that the miniseries covers is equivalent to that of the reign of the Third Reich (1933-1945). True events are depicted with the broad frame of the Holocaust.  But in the end, the most likeable part of ""Holocaust"" is its character portrayals be it historical or fictional.  The historical characters are brilliantly portrayed by some of England's finest actors. David Warner plays Reinhard Heydrich with the utmost conviction.  It is no wonder that he won an Emmy for his performance.  Ian Holm (known to today's audience as Bilbo from Lord of the Rings) likewise is excellent as Heinrich Himmler. Other historical characters that are well portrayed are Adolf Eichmann, Hans Frank, Ernst Kaltenbrunner, Rudolf Hoess, and Mordecai Anielewicz.  The fictional characters of the Weiss family and Erik Dorf (astounding performance by Michael Moriarty) serves a purpose as well to say the least.  The Weiss family characters were created to give the viewer the Jewish perspective of the war.  When the family is eventually separated from each other, the viewer has the opportunity to witness the events of Babi Yar, Auschwitz, Buchenwald, Kristallnacht, and the Warsaw uprising to name a few. James Woods, Meryl Streep and Rosemary Harris (she currently plays Aunt May in the Spider-man movies) do a wonderful job bringing these characters to life. But it is ultimately Michael Moriarty who really shines with his brilliant performance as the cold-blooded Nazi Erik Dorf. Although the character of Erik Dorf is fictional, it provides the viewer with a plausible scenario as to how an ""ordinary"" obscure German can rise through the ranks of the Third Reich and become evil personified.

The soundtrack to ""Holocaust"" consists of original music composed by Morton Gould as well as samples of music by Mozart, Beethoven, and Chopin. The music in general has its hints of melancholy and echoes of an earlier peaceful German society.

""Holocaust"" also correctly portrays the Catholic Church in good light by presenting the true historical figure of Fr. Bernhard Lichtenberg (who along with Maximilian Kolbe and Edith Stein died for their faith).  It is an important aspect of the mini-series because recently the Catholic Church has been unjustly attacked with the accusation that Pope Pius XII did nothing for the Jews during the war. Nothing could be further from the truth. After all, shortly after the war Jewish leaders ranging from Golda Meir to Albert Einstein praised Pope Pius XII for saving tens of thousands of Jews.  It was only with the release of the fictional play ""The Deputy"" that people jumped on the bandwagon and began their assaults on Pius XII.  It is a pity that a man who saved more lives than Oskar Schindler and Raoul Wallenberg combined should be so vilified.  The fact of the matter is that today's liberal media now downplays Pope Pius XII's heroic achievements so as to make them appear as if they never occurred.  For further illumination on the subject, I highly recommend the book ""Hitler, the War, and the Pope"" by Ronald J. Rychlak.",1107216000,11,3648,5.038269550748752
630846,5,6303338569,"This made for TV Saga was one of the best presentations I have ever seen on the Holocaust.  I believe that all people of conscience should view this excellent and important film.

630847,3,6303338569,"This film is more important for its historical impact than either its verisimilitude or aethestic quality as drama.  It is a well-intentioned melodrama that is great on making people cry and not so great on making them think very much.  Not sure what to say about the scene when Meryl Streep walks up to a concentration camp gate, knocks on the gate, in order to join her husband who is a prisoner.  But there is no denying the film's importance in getting people on both sides of the Atlantic to look at the event of the Holocaust.",1083888000,5,532,4.463917525773196
630848,5,6303338569,"*(If anyone knows when this DVD will be released please say so i would very much like to know)
I have only recently come across this mini-series after renting it from my videostore and only even heard of this when researching more on Meryl Streep after viewing her incredible performnce in ""Sophie's Choice"".
Admirers of Ms. Streep won't be dissapointed in her performance nor will they with the rest.
Spanning over a decade (1935-1945), ""Holocaust"" focuses on the Weiss Family of Berlin and all the terror that each individual faces during their darkest days.
The characters are endearing and audiences will easily empathise with the strife they face.
This docu-drama is an accurate and on several occasions, highly disturbing account of man's inhumanity to mankind.
It's won 8 out of 16 emmy awards (1 Emmy which Meryl Streep won) and deserves each one.
I believe that every jewish man and woman should see this film and anyone else who is interested in History's blackest decade.",1057190400,49,982,4.957575757575758
630849,4,6303338569,"I was a kid when I saw the mini-series on TV in Italy. I remember sitting on the couch with my entire family since my mother wanted us to see what happened to the Jews during WWII in Nazi Germany. Back then, what I saw made an everlasting impression and got me hooked on everything that was Jewish. Since then, I've been reading books and watching movies and documentaries on the Children of Abraham... Anyway, after more than twenty years, I rented this TV movie to bring back the memories of the old times. The movie is moving and compelling. The only criticism that I have is that it uses the broad term Christianity when it's actually specifically referring to Catholicism; also, in a couple of scenes it looks like an apologetic portrayal of Catholicism as the last bastion against the Nazi horror, when it is common knowledge that the Catholic church had at last a dubious role in the handling of the matter of the Jews during that period. Other than that, the movie is truly poignant and well acted by the protagonists. Perhaps, the most incredible thing is how those monsters could coldly murders millions of innocent people and then go back to their families at Christmas, sing ""Silent Night,"" and boldly proclaim to their children that they were defending the civilization of Western Europe from the threat of the Jews, the killers of Christ, like they themselves, with their folly, were not killing the spirit of Christ not one, but six million times.",1023494400,12,1462,4.71484375

630851,5,6303338569,"Although much has been said about the performances of James Woods and Meryl Streep, the standout performance is that of Michael Moriarty as the SS officer who so completely succeeds in subjugating his own personality in service of the Nazis that his statements are uttered in a dull, emotionless monotone.  It's a frightening performance, because one truly senses the coldness and indifference of these architects of death.  Sam Wanamaker, as the older hero of the Warsaw uprising, is equally deserving of commendation.  He aptly conveys both the weariness and the inspiration of his character.  ""For the first time in my life, I feel the blood of King David in me!"" he shouts triumphantly as he fires at the German soldiers sent to quell the uprising and resume the roundup for the death-camps.",994723200,3,795,5.0
