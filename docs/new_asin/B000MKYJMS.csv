8169721,1,B000MKYJMS,"I was totally pissed when this DVD arrived. IT was used, and I paid like 30 bucks for it. I wanted to return it but there was so many hoops to jump through it wasn't worth my time!!!!! The DVD was all scratched up and some of it did not play. So big waste of money!!!!! READ THE FINE PRINT and make sure you're buying the NEW product you want. Mine still did not say anything about being USED, scratched, and a better frisbee than a DVD",1379808000,,436,4.022988505747127

8169723,5,B000MKYJMS,"In the world of motorcycle racing, few riders had as much fun -- and sorrow -- as Barry Sheene. Plus, he was just a likeable guy. This video chronicles his rise to the top of GP racing, along with bits and pieces of his personal life ... including some ""ouch"" video of surgeons removing a repair rod from one of his legs. The show is well worth the time and money.",1334534400,,364,4.140845070422535
