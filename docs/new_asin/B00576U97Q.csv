4594217,4,B00576U97Q,"Came on to order this today but now I look and see there may be something wrong with the supply? This is very uncommon for Funimation material of any sort. I've been very happy with the other 5 I've gotten (no. 6 is on its way for me), but this makes me worry about getting this last box set. Does anyone know why amazon yanked their suppy after just one day on the market?",1318377600,2,373,4.054054054054054

Now to the films box, ""Dragon Box: The Movies"" was announced on FUNimation's Twitter account sometime ago, but please note, it will contain the Dragon Ball Z films (the Z Specials may come with in the same box, i.e The Movies Box), they are yet to announce if they've gotten the license for the Dragon Ball ones.

And, Dragon Ball GT has a TV Special not a film (movie).

Feels great knowing Dragon Box Z is close to complete and then the rest of the Dragon Boxes will be remaining (Dragon Ball, Dragon Ball GT and The Movies).

Update: The Dragon Box Z 7 comes with the Original DBGT NEP of Episode 01 (this was not originally included on the Japanese Dragon Box Z, so it's a nice add to the collection).",1311033600,27,5088,4.854819976771196
4594219,5,B00576U97Q,"Why is it called Dbox 7 and not Dragon Box 7.  Also, the box art is out, but not on here?",1310688000,,89,3.238095238095238
4594220,5,B00576U97Q,"Came in quickly and in great condition
Package was a big debted but with all the bubble wrap that was applied it was perfectly fine and in perfect condition!",1372896000,,157,4.448275862068965
4594221,5,B00576U97Q,"it was awesome my boyfriend was very happy it brand new  it was the right one color condition
 awesome no tears or rips came on  package very well. awesome service I will order again from you. thank you so much your an awesome seller",1358899200,,233,4.25
4594222,5,B00576U97Q,wahou dragon ball always has been the best cartoon i've watch when i was a kid. i've collect all seven box. it was wonderfull to see them al over and the box sets are beautiful,1358121600,,176,4.057142857142857
4594223,5,B00576U97Q,"This was an amazing product I love Dragon Ball Z, so I decided to get the Dragon Boxes. So far I have two of them. The only problem with these sets is that there is no english dubbed soundtrack/Music. But its not a big problem. The Picture is great and there is no improper cropping of the video. Its in 4:3 but I don't have a problem with it. If you plan on buying Dragon Ball Z on DVD then you should get this se. But be Warned at the time of this writing the 1st Volume sells for around $80-$130 and Volume 2 Sells for around $110-$300 depending on the vender.",1356393600,,563,4.035714285714286
4594224,5,B00576U97Q,"If you've ordered Dragon Box sets then you already know what you're getting. If not then expect this: The remastering process for these sets are absolutely top notch. Thanks to how well it's been processed for it's release the show doesn't show it's exact age. Now as for the content of the anime it's self well, the end of it was less than stellar. Dragon Ball Z was a great part of my childhood and I watched almost all of it. This set contained the last bit I was missing. It just strayed too far what made me love the series from the beginning. That's honestly just my opinion. It was nice though seeing what happened even if it was weird to me.",1356307200,,649,4.284552845528455
4594225,5,B00576U97Q,"I am overjoyed to finnally have this. A must for any dragonball z fan! It has origional japaneese or dubbed english, also subtitles if you prefer. Its all origional uncut dbz which is a lil drawn out but i love it. If you want all the action with none of the filler you may prefer dragonball z kai.",1333670400,3,298,4.155172413793103
4594226,5,B00576U97Q,"The Dragon Boxes are superb quality, especially compared to the terrible remastered orange bricks FUNimation put out. You don't really need anything else if you've got the Dragon Boxes, unless you just can't live without Bruce Faulconer's music.

Get these and enjoy the series as it should be.",1330041600,6,294,5.125
4594227,5,B00576U97Q,The Dragon Box 7 is one of my best purchases. The picture and sound is great. This set contains the Fusion Saga and Kid Buu Saga. It comes with a booklet that has alot of information about the episodes and characters. This is a must buy for any DBZ Fan.,1319414400,,253,4.08
4594228,5,B00576U97Q,"Just what I expected. Ordered it Sunday night and received it Tuesday morning thanks to Amazon Prime. One interesting thing that I noticed, now that I have the whole set, is that in the first 5 boxes when you open up the disc covers, the first disc is on the right side as a tribute to the Japanese way of reading from right to left. But interestingly enough, in the last two boxes this is not the case. The discs go from left to right just as you would expect it to in English. Did Funimation just forget as they reached the last two boxes that they were doing this? Who made this mistake? Of course this does not effect the quality of the sets. Which is why of course this gets 5 stars. But it is interesting none the least...
Can't wait for DBOX the movies!",1318896000,,760,4.1768707482993195
4594229,4,B00576U97Q,"Sincerely this is the best way to view Dragon Ball Z in my opinion.  However, I don't know if its just isolated to certain copies but one of the episode titles is mistranslated in the English version.  The episode titled: ""Run away Satan, An Angry Buu Emerges"" came up as: ""What the Z Sword Broken?!""  Like I said I don't know if its every copy but that's how mine is which is kind of sad considering the money both Funi and I dumped into getting this series.  Outside of that expect the same packaging and same quality of sound and video that you've come to expect from the previous boxes.  In no way is the mess up a deal breaker just kind of a ""what the crap?"" moment.",1318464000,,671,4.2109375
8460333,5,B00576U97Q,THIS IS FOR ANY DBZ fan who watched DBZ in it when growing up. Ther is no Bruce falcuner music just the tradioninal japanesee music which is better. It set the tone of the show.,1487462400,,177,4.085714285714285
8460334,5,B00576U97Q,Great,1470960000,,5,5.0
8460335,5,B00576U97Q,"Not worth the price despite it's terrific quality and packaging. That being said, on the video quality side of things the Blu-Ray collection is equal to or greater than the quality of the Dragon Box sets and much cheaper. I also recommend Kai. Don't let the Nicktoons syndication of Kai fool you, it's uncut and great, with no filler.",1447200000,2,334,4.677966101694915
8460336,1,B00576U97Q,"$700.00 really guys?!? $50-$70.00 maybe, not 500.00",1439078400,2,51,6.428571428571429

8460339,5,B00576U97Q,Best series every. This is by far one of my most favorite and loved series. Has Great Action/Adventure/Fighting and a really great story plot. A must have for any anime fan :).,1399680000,,176,4.53125
8460340,5,B00576U97Q,Dragon Ball is one of the greatest animes of all time. It was nice to finally get the Z series in a box set. I have them all. Perfect addition for anyone's collection.,1395187200,,167,4.090909090909091
8460341,5,B00576U97Q,"The best release of dragon ball z for the buu saga. Original Japanese soundtrack which is way better than the us soundtrack. Amazing picture quality, awesome booklet. Amazing",1380672000,,174,5.25
8460342,5,B00576U97Q,It's DBZ! It's japanese uncut! It's 4:3! It's have Japanese BGM with English voice over! This is the one we've been waiting for all these years!,1373155200,,144,4.576923076923077
