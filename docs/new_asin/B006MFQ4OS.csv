5004415,3,B006MFQ4OS,"I remember this TV show when it originally aired - I was around 15, and had been wanted to watch it again ever since. I finally found someone in eBay that sold it in VHS and bought it.

I killed one of the myths from my teens. The show didn't age well at all, and it definitely doesn't survive the aging of the viewer himself.

If you have been waiting for this DVD release for a long time and plan to revisit a TV show that you loved back them - be warned what you might be very disappointed and spoil a nice memory.",1324166400,16,517,3.9615384615384617

5004441,5,B006MFQ4OS,"I remember watching this as a boy in the UK in late seventies.
My vivid memories of it are the hovercraft car with four wheels that Logan used. Sandman's car.
The Night Visitors episode which was kind of creepy with the curtain being pulled back at the end.
Watching them again. I'm appreciating Jessica this time. But this time, I get to watch and enjoy them all again. The stories have a nice moral about them, and some sad endings on some.
It's a real shame they didn't continue the series. It's wonderful even now.",1488067200,,518,4.463157894736842

5004461,4,B006MFQ4OS,"I would give 5 stars if I could but the show needs to be remastered in HD for that.  The special effects were great, the stories were intelligently written and the actors quite likable.  As for the DVD's they are just acceptable quality, there was no remastering done.

interesting discovery,tho'it is to a degree typical of 1970s tv scifi it is
well worth a watch Gregory Harrison makes a very effective logan 5
and heather menzies is fabulous as Jessica 6 and the addition of a
character called rem who is an android really sets things off but don't
compare this to the Michael York/jenny agutter movie just take it on it's
own merits and you will be very pleasantly surprised",1465084800,2,481,4.355555555555555
5004492,4,B006MFQ4OS,"Campy 70's sci-fi fun. Limited budget forced TV in the 70's to rely on writing and acting more and this show was pretty good at both. Gregory Harrison in an early staring role, before Trapper John MD made him famous, is more subdued in this role but he has to be since he is the lead in this show. It isn't as good as the movie with Michael York as Logan but it is good. If you loved the movie, you will like this TV show version.",1464652800,,430,3.954022988505747

5004519,5,B006MFQ4OS,This is a series I never seen before and even though made in the 1970s it is excellent. The performances and story ideas are so much better than most of today's offerings despite the dated effects. A shame this was not appreciated as well at the times. It may have been because of the new cast chosen than the popular actors from the movie version. This cast appear more suited than the movie counterpart in many ways and it will be considered a gem of the past for me that was ahead of it's time for sure. If you can forget the dated effects then I am sure you can appreciate everything else this has to offer. This is a must see for sure  and one I would watch more than once.,1440028800,,678,4.136363636363637

5004538,4,B006MFQ4OS,"As with most of the TV shows of the 1970's Logan's Run is suitable for the whole family. It's cute. The story lines are o.k. (for the most part.) Although the show jumps the shark when Logan and Jessica have to deal with aliens (the kind from outer space.) The special effects and props are mediocre. An average show. But I felt sad when I viewed the last show. Then I realized I was being nostalgic and had enjoyed the fact that there is little violence (what violence there is is mild and not graphic) and not a lot of sex (but there is sexiness.) All in all, if you like science fiction or you want a show you can view with the kids (although they'll tell you they're smarter than Rem the android) this is a good show for the price. There is a bonus. If you watched the show in 1977-78 you didn't see all the episodes produced. You get three unaired episodes. You might even want to watch it in the Winter because 75% of the show takes place in a desert environment and you'll probably warm up to it quicker.",1431475200,4,1011,4.216494845360825
5004539,5,B006MFQ4OS,"This series was based on one of the early sci-fi movies without aliens or fake looking villains. They were the first to use a holographic image and also used miniature models, blue screen, matt paintings, and special effects to create a future world.

The story shows how an ecologically balanced world (after man has wrecked the planet) becomes a great place to live until you are executed at 30. Two people who have opposing views at first must rely on each other and end up discovering love in a society where that does not exist.",1429833600,,533,4.610526315789474
5004540,3,B006MFQ4OS,"Good packaging and clean Discs. 3-4 of the 12 Episodes are good the others suffer from bad acting, poor effects and props. Decent Entertainment if you are a Fan. Comes with 3 Discs, plastic Case and Cardboard Storage.",1427241600,,217,4.7368421052631575
5004541,4,B006MFQ4OS,"If you're familiar with this TV series, then it's definitely worth the $14.10 paid for all 14 episodes.  It's really a nostalgic slice of some of the 70's cheesiest Sci-Fi, but that's what makes it endearing to older Sci-Fi fans/collectors such as myself.  It's not worth a lot more than that, because the quality of the video (or lack thereof) is quite poor (hence the one star deduction). Still, it's pretty much the same as it was when it was first aired.  So as long as you know what you're getting (cheesy 70's Sci-Fi, and not great quality), it's definitely worth the cheap price for a nostalgic look back at this short lived Sci-Fi series.",1425513600,,646,4.6

Unfortunately in the South Florida market it was always preempted by something and not all the episodes were broadcast, so I'm enjoying seeing some of the episodes for the first time.

5004576,3,B006MFQ4OS,"The series isn't very good, but I got the DVDs because I remember watching the show when I was younger.  What is funny is how none of the stories really have anything to do with Logan's Run.  They wanted to be Star Trek I think, including stories by DC Fontana and lots of Star Trek sound effects.  The quality is pretty bad.  Around episode six the quality starts getting real streaky and jumpy almost as if it were pulled from old VHS.

The episode by Harlan Ellison was pretty sad, and I bet he wasn't pleased with it either (this was the episode I was looking forward to).

Oh, and one episode has a very young Kim Cattrall  Took me a while to realize who she was!

Best for collectors of old SCIFI or nostalgia buffs.",1410307200,,722,4.257352941176471

When I saw this was coming out on dvd I was very happy, I stayed away from the YT episodes online because I wanted to watch them as they were intended to be seen, on my Blu-ray player! I was astounded how good this series was! They used many props and items in the original movies, but the stories were SO well written it was mind blowing. I am a huge Donald Moffat fan so I was super stoked to see him in the series, and I remember Heather Menzies from the Robert Urich 70s days so it was all a treat. To me, this also really fits in with my post apocalyptic love, a lot of the show takes place outdoors looking for sanctuary and the landscapes are very reminiscent with that type of atmosphere.",1398297600,,781,4.111111111111111

I would wonder when they would put out a DVD of this show  Logan's Run. It was good to see Gregory Harrison as I have seen him is a few shows at that time. I was glad that it finally came on out DVD and I bought it, I and my mother enjoy watching it again and knowing bits of what I remember when I was a boy and some were like new episodes to see. It really show how many years it ago it was made at that time.

5004598,5,B006MFQ4OS,"Logan's Run was a very short lived series, only 14 episodes were created before the series was cancelled.  It was loosely based on the hit movie, but with some significant differences.  The movie was a bit of an oddity too, but it had a rather indefinite ending.  Logan's Run deals with a post nuclear war society kept prisoner in a multi-domed city.  It was a completely hedonistic society, which was emphasized much more completely in the movie version, but was undoubtedly toned down for the censored TV of the 70s.  No doubt it was created for the golden ""family hour"" that was popular with the networks at the time in a failed effort to create shows that were appropriate for the entire family (read lacking sexual/adult content).  The down side to living in the City of Domes was that people were promised a reincarnation at the age of 30, but were really be put to death in a colorful ritual call ""carousel"" when they reached that age.  It was never fully explained why this was so--whether it was for population control or some other reason; but it was forbidden for anyone to visit the outside world and whatever the original plan was had been long since lost or corrupted.  We might assume that they were being kept in the city until a day where the surface of the Earth was more habitable for human being, but if that was the case the mission was completely lost (in the movie version it appears faulty computers were to blame).  To prevent people from leaving the city executioners called Sandmen were employed to annihilate people who wouldnt go to carousel or those trying to escape.  Logan's Run deals with Logan (a Sandman who questioned the order of things) and Jessica, who didn't to become incinerated at 30,  and became runners who manage to escape together.  In the ruins of Washington DC they find an old solar hovercraft and set off to find ""Sanctuary"", a place said to be where people could live beyond 30 in safety; but no one knew where it was.  Along the way they pick up a clever and witty android name Rem.

I watched the show as a teenager, but wasn't able to keep up with it due to changing time slots and other conflicts--which was what undoubtedly lead to it's demise.  I don't think that it was deliberately campy, it was just the style of those types of series in those days--like the original Battlestar Galactica series.  It was definitely better than the later Buck Rogers series, which had better effects but poor writing.

This was not a lame show, on what appeared to be a very limited budget it attempted to be a decent science fiction show.  Deeply involved was DC Fontana who was a major writer and consultant for the original Star Trek series.  They had some decent and known science fiction writers do stories for them.  The exploration of a post apocalyptic USA was intriguing, although there were some continuity problems if one looked deeply enough, for the most part the stories were well written.  I believe Rem was Ms. Fontana's attempt to add a Spock-like character to the mix and made a good addition to the show's cast.  Like Spock he was highly analytical and had capabilities beyond that of human beings.  There were some well know TV actors who played guest spots as well as some who had been in other science fiction shows.

There is no attempt at restoration on this series, the episodes are ""as-is"" and there is not bonus materials or extras of any kind, which is a shame because I think that this much overlooked show deserved a little better treatment even if they just dug up some archival materials about it. Shows like NIght Gallery and Time Tunnel got much kinder treatment for their DVD releases.  I hope that future releases rectify this oversight.  I highly recommend the series to those who liked the movie if they can overlook the somewhat rudimentary special effects and mat paintings, because the story deserves a 2nd look.  I think Logan's Run is ripe for a update like was done with Battlestar Galactica and V, perhaps if enough people buy the DVDs the studios will give it some thought.",1388793600,10,4063,4.630404463040446

5004602,5,B006MFQ4OS,"The TV Series itself has only recently become available again (relatively speaking - around for a few years now) via digital streaming, but I wonder about the treatment of the TV Series on DVD in terms of picture quality (which is lacking in the streaming or digital formats).  As someone who owns all of the episodes via online services, I am not sure if I should wait for a possible Blu-Ray or restored version of some sort down the road.  Sure having the discs and artwork is nice, but this TV Series (and the movie for that matter) deserve better treatment and restoring.

As for the TV Series itself, it's fantastic, light-hearted but full of suspense and danger, interesting storylines with all kinds of ethical, moral and spiritual issues, and it is well acted and written for a lower budget TV Series at the time.  The alternate take on the original film (based on the book) is the first episode, which is 90 minutes long.  I was surprised at how much I liked it, being a big fan of the film adaption.  And then there's dodging that troublemaker Francis, always looking to ""do his job"" and not question anything, there's plenty of him and his lackeys hunting down Logan/Jessica at all costs, as they look for ""Sanctuary"" and end-up running into a fragmented landscape of cultures and groups that survived the holocaust, all with different levels of scientific knowledge and advancement.

Really entertaining for kids and adults, and a great nostalgia trip for those who grew up as pre-adolescents in the 70's, in particular.  The campy but far-out-cool retro Sci-Fi sets are almost worth the price and time alone.

Well-paced, the acting is great, the writing is solid for this time period/situation, and the whole campy nature of it is as charming as the storylines and suspense that occurs in every episode.  I have no idea why this show was canceled after one season.",1388102400,,1878,4.768518518518518

5004630,4,B006MFQ4OS,"My initial interest in Logan's Run was purely nostalgic. I watched the show regularly during its initial run (I'm surprised, seeing it for the first time since then, how much of the pilot I remember). I figured it had to be a pretty cheesy show, considering the budget and the fact that it didn't last even a full season. Yet I wanted to take a look at it again. I've always thought Gregory Harrison was a likable actor, and I remember Heather Menzies as one of the von Trapp children in The Sound of Music.  Donald Moffat's android character REM was neat. And I'm a huge fan of both the original novel and the movie (which are very different from each other, and both different from the series). So I was curious how it holds up. It's definitely a mixed bag, but ultimately the strengths outweigh the weaknesses.

The weaknesses first. The biggest is that the shows all seem to be terribly directed, or at least directed by people not concerned about performances. Pacing is good, but everyone in the show is stiff and awkward. At first I just put this down to bad acting, but watching episode after episode, it's very strange the way the action is staged. For instance, almost never does anyone move naturally or actually touch each other. Even when people are supposed to be expressing romance or violence they tend to almost get near to each other, then just stop and stand there, no matter how impassioned their voices are.  Most of the actors spend entire episodes simply standing around, arms awkwardly at their sides or folded across their chests/behind their backs.  That can't be laid at the actors' feet, considering it cuts across all barriers of experience: young actors, older actors, newcomers and seasoned veterans.  Donald Moffat as the android REM comes off best, but that isn't surprising, since as an android he isn't expected to mimic realistic human interaction. Harrison comes off second best, as bad as any of them at first, but as the episodes progress developing the ability to appear relaxed and natural in most situations, and convey emotion even though his physical interaction with others is still restricted (again, making me think the actors were left stranded by directors who didn't care).

Related to this (I'm not actually sure which complaint should go first) the show seems from the beginning to have been straight-jacketed as a show for children, so the selling point of the movie--the decadent delights of the City of Domes and the relationship between Jessica and Logan as lovers--are completely removed. The city just seems some dull, Jetson-style futuristic set and Jessica and Logan are not only not defined as lovers, they are, worse, not even defined as *not* lovers. Again, I think this plays into why the leads aren't particularly strong, and REM comes off best. He has a defined character as an android who sees mankind as a hopeless mess (he's  Spock essentially, and that can't be accidental) which gives the actor a basic foothold to build a character around. Gregory Harrison and Heather Menzies are put in the position of smiling at each other but not touching, saying nice things about each other but conveying no desire for each other. When a guest character asks them about their relationship, they reply eagerly but innocently  as if they were 9-year-olds who don't know what ""liking each other"" really means. It's not surprising then, and really no fault of the actors, that they have no chemistry and aren't particularly interesting.

A slight step up from this. The production style of the series is either going to appeal to you warmly as nostalgia or coldly as camp. The sets aren't sophisticated and the look of the show, with the emphasis on natural settings and naturalistic photography is very setting. Nearly every woman in the cast is given the hairdo made famous by--as she was then known--Farah Fawcett-Majors (where in this post-apocalyptic world they are all getting a hold of heavy 70's style make up, not to mention the hair dryers necessary for that feathered look is anyone's guess). A shot in the opening credits of the futuristic car heading into the setting sun, the four points of light reflecting in the camera lens, is the very picture of a stylistic age. Personally, I enjoy it, but I can imagine the show creating a lot of unintentional laughs.

So one giant miss with poor direction, one kinda hit with a distinctly 70's era production. What makes the show worth watching for people who don't just want to relive their childhood memories? Why bother with it now?

Two things: the basic concept is fascinating and uniquely handled, and the scripts.

The concept. In the original novel, there actually is a place called Sanctuary. Where it is and whether Logan and Jessica arrive there, I'll leave you to read the novel and find out for yourself. In the movie, Sanctuary turns out to be a myth. There is just a desolate (but capable of survival in) outside world with apparently one sole remaining inhabitant. Sanctuary is a dream that must be forgotten. But the television series takes a different, and kind of existentialist approach. Everything about their experiences should prove to Logan and Jessica that there is no Sanctuary. They have no idea in which direction it might be located, and though they find various alternative small communities of people, clearly none of these are it. Yet they continue pushing on, with no guidance or hint whatsoever, continue insisting against all reason that somewhere around the bend is the place they are looking for, though they have no information of what that place is like or how they are to identify it. There's something there--whether intentional or not--that resonates with humanity's obsession with religion, or the perfection of the arts of the sciences, an irrational but fascinating impulse--the kind of impulse almost solely analyzed in the realm of science fiction. Which leads to the series' other major strength.

The scripts. With the exception of a hokey early entry utilizing the ""Man is the Most Dangerous Game"" concept, these are some of the best written episodes of a science fiction series ever. This may be something that isn't all that important to a lot of people, but most science fiction movies and series are not really science fiction. They may take place on ships, and there may be cool looking guns and impressive effects. But the stories are basic soap opera or serial dramas that could be set in any time (Star Wars, for instance, could almost entirely take place in ancient Rome as easily it does in the ancient Empire of its galaxy). Logan's Run really considers the effect of the basic science fiction premise, and introduces different science fiction ideas in various episodes. REM himself is a fascinating commentator on man's (degenerated) condition. And he's subject to Asimov's robotic laws (the accidental violation of one provides the dramatic arc of a script). The show considers how futuristic people might have survived a nuclear catastrophe, what invented technologies they might have had available, and how the availability of those technologies would alter their behavior. And the series takes a hard look at the human condition. Despite most episodes ending with the trio driving off with a smile on their faces, the various attempts of humanity to deal with a post-nuclear war, and their belief that their technologies have given them a superior edge, almost always end up showing humanity at its worse (one interesting entry has six cryogenically suspended geniuses in their respective fields brought back to life, but due to a plot complication, a decision must be made which three can live; the squabbling and petty behavior of all of them make a fairly strong case that none of them deserved to survive). REM himself is pacifistic misanthropy incarnate. He doesn't understand humans because humans by definition are not logical beings. It's an interesting thought.

I genuinely believe, whatever the shortcomings of the series realization, that had the series continued for a full season or two, simply on the basis of the scripts, it would have survived perpetually in syndication, and  would be ranked in the 70's and 80's as the second best sci-fi continuing drama series after Star Trek. Yes, there are flaws, and there are hit or miss moments. A dud episode or two.

5004633,3,B006MFQ4OS,"Based on the hit movie of the same name, Logan's Run shares the basic premise: a post-nuclear society doesn't allow people to live past 30; those who try to escape the hermetically-sealed City of Domes are called Runners and the agents who seek to terminate runners and enforce the standard are Sandmen.

But in the TV show Logan is not part of a Sandman plot to find Sanctuary, where Runners go to find freedom, but rather is a Sandman who has growing doubts about ""renewal"" and the order of things. He escapes with Jessica and the series then centers around the adventures of the two (plus their trusty robot companion) in the Outside as they look for Sanctuary. Oh, and are pursued by teams of Sandmen also operating on the outside.

Instead of focusing their plots on post-nuclear holocaust societies (which might have provided some interesting social commentary) and mutations, radiation dangers, etc. the program seemed to try to recycle many of the ST TOS plots involving aliens, humans being split into ""good"" and ""evil"" halves, time travel, robots mimicing human society etc. I felt that if the series had focused on plots truly unique to their ""environment"" it would have done better. Still, the show was the only sci-fi series going at the time (if I remember correctly) and the special effects were the best available at the time. This is also a unique opportunity to watch the ENTIRE series, including three which never aired due to the program being unceremoniously yanked off TV. One of them, Night Visitors, was arguably one of the best episodes of the series.

 Not a TERRIFIC show but not bad either. Worth reviewing if you are a sci-fi fan. It DOES have one of the most annoying theme songs ever, though.",1350950400,3,1723,4.771812080536913

5004635,5,B006MFQ4OS,"Yes, that's what REM stands for!

Adapted from Michael Anderson's 1976 movie, based on the 1968 novel by William F Nolan and George Clayton Johnson.

It's the year 2319 and the survivors of the nuclear war 200 years earlier are scattered all over the world having evolved into wildly different societies, largely unaware of each others' existence.  One of these societies is the City Of Domes where life is unending bliss and pleasure - until your 30th birthday when you have to enter the quasi-religious ritual of Carousel to be reborn into a new life-cycle.  But Carousel is actually an exterminating machine, and those who suspect the truth become runners, fleeing from the system and hunted by elite policeman called Sandmen whose job is to terminate, or kill, runners.  Logan is a Sandman, partnered by Francis.  Jessica is a member of an underground movement that helps runners.  Logan has been having doubts himself and finds himself on the run with Jessica and an android called Rem.  They are now hunted by Francis, who also knows the truth and has been promised a life beyond 30 and a seat on the Council of Elders, by the elderly men who secretly run the City behind the scenes, if he brings them back for brainwashing to testify in favour of Carousel and against running.  Logan, Jessica and Rem discover strange new societies as they explore the world outside the Domes and try to keep one step ahead of Francis.

Objectively, this series is no lost masterpiece due for re-evaluation. It's actually a pretty tame, sanitized reworking of a much better movie which nevertheless itself threw away most of the source novel's original ideas in favour of SF cliches.

But as nostalgia for Seventies Sunday afternoons (for those of us in the UK), it is priceless magic. And it's not all bad. Man Out Of Time fills in the details of how Logan's world came to be, a time paradox story with a bitter sting in the tail. The Judas Goat has a Sandman altered to resemble a runner known to Jessica, in order to trick the runners into going back to the City Of Domes, plus their meeting with the first ever runner, Matthew 12. This too has a number of surprises and a fittingly ironic ending. Captured shows Logan and Francis operating as a team, as they must have done before Logan ran.

The main problem seems to have been the producers' desire to aim the series at family audiences - the fundamentally dark concept of a society where citizens have to die at 30 (or 21 in the novel) is at odds with this approach. Perhaps if it had lasted a little longer, this might have been addressed.

Still, for all it's faults, there's much to enjoy here - Donald Moffatt brings a dignity and - ironically - a humanity to Rem the android, a character created for the TV series, who could have been simply embarassing in the hands of a lesser actor.

And male viewers will certainly appreciate Heather Menzies' skimpy little minidress!",1343779200,2,2923,4.66147859922179
5004636,5,B006MFQ4OS,"I was 17 when this show was on TV and didn't watch it. I was to busy being 17 and going to Rocky Horror  on Fri nights.  I am now a big fan of the show. I have always been a fan of the movie. This show, like other great sci fi shows of the 70's and 80's  ""Planet of the Apes"", ""Battle Star"", ""Quark"", ""V"" , ""Starman"" , ""Alien Nation."", ""The Man from Atlantis"", ""Shazam"", ""The Powers of Matthew Starr""  and ""Voyagers""  didn't get a chance to grow and were cancelled far to soon.  This show might be cheesy and cheap, but for it's time it had great stories.  Most of all near the end when  they did stories that centered around cults and religion,  "" Night Visitors"" and ""Turnabout.""  I also  like that they allowed Francis to do some fancy sword play "" star wars style""  in the episode ""Turnabout"".  I liked Francis and thought he should have been used more often.  The  old friendship between Logan and Francis should have been developed more.  I see Rem as a forfather of Data in Star Trek Next Gen.  At least Rem didn't get on my nerves like Data.  I often wished someone would just pull the plug on Data for a whole episode.  I am glad they are releasing the old sci fi shows on DVD.  The quality of the DVDs are fine.  It is to bad there are no extras.  You'd think they could at least get in a few interviews or info about the production.  Seems like they are doing these shows on the cheap.

5004637,4,B006MFQ4OS,"there is a good rule of thumb about reviews. If they go on about how bad effeccts were on a decent show from 3 + decades ago then completely ignore them.  The effects and such were fine for a this effort which was from 1977. The movie was better of course and I remember being completely thrilled by that movie. Everyone was. This didn't have the money of the movie but they did some decent work here. The best episodes feature the runners out ine post apocaplytic world, the not so great feature aliens and such. But they were trying to make a interesting series here with different bad guys each episode. Most of this series is pretty good actually as they runners make their way accross the world. For a sci fi effort from this era. This wasn't low budget , it was just a regular tv series budget though which was far less than lets say 'battlestar gallactica' of a year later. ALthough the cost of that one and not the ratings drove it from the air. I do like the android addition in this story. He adds alot to the show and I think the acting was up to par for what was required. The andriod steals the show though, this could have been called the ram show. The series looks mostly pretty good , however some scenes have some ugly print damage on them. But many do not and that makes this a good set considering that there was a good chance that we were never going to see this on dvd ever. All 14 epsidoes are here and they are worth watching because the whole premise is a good one. However snobs who snicker at older sci fi need look elsewhere. Of course the sets are well of their era and not of higher grade even with spaceships that have clearly panels of the 1970's era!  This isn't near the standard of 'v' which came out five years later but it was a welcome sight for sci fi fans of the seventies.  It wasn't great but it engaging.  And in terms of the seventies you didn't have much sci fi ever on tv. You had some good brit shows and some good sci fi movies but rare indeed was the sci fi tv series.  The hair and sexy outfits the women wear are from the seventies too, at least they aren't dressed in disgusting baggy clothes like the nostyle 90's!",1337904000,3,2166,4.209638554216867

5004643,4,B006MFQ4OS,"I remember watching the TV version of Logan's Run when I was a teenager.  Back then I didn't find the stories terribly interesting but my love of the original movie gave me a reason to pick up the DVD of the TV series to reevaluate this show.

First off, everyone is correct regarding the image quality of the DVD.  While the images are sharp and clear, there are lots of scratches and other blemishes that make the episodes less than pristine.

Gregory Harrison is a bit stiff as Logan, though he comes across as a sincere character who is concerned about the predicament he finds himself in.

Heather Menzies is also effective in her role.  She's not just a companion or a ""damsel in distress"".  She is written to be a very independent and smart character who is integral to solving the problems encountered week to week.

Donald Moffat really stands out as REM however.  He tends to get the best lines and delivers them in his lovely drole yet dispassionate voice.  He is of course the show's Mr. Spock or Lt. Data.  He's the outsider who can comment on human condition in ways that Logan and Jessica cannot.

Let's face it, this show was attempting to be Star Trek on land instead of space.  Certainly their over-riding goal was to find Sanctuary but it's the people and situations they encounter from week to week that makes the show interesting.  In many cases Logan, Jessica and REM take a back seat to the characters they encounter but the stars of the show don't quite gel as a team like Kirk, Spock and McCoy did in Trek.  If the show had made it past its initial 13 episodes, ways would have been found to make us care more for the main cast of the show.

Having gone through the show's flaws, I do find the episodes to be remarkably interesting and relevant.  Credit certainly goes to D.C. Fontana, the show's story editor, who was a Star Trek veteran.  She recruited some top-notch talent to contribute story ideas to the show.  While the show's basic format resembles ""The Fugitive"", the stories elevate the basic premise into something more interesting.  There are some great concepts, though there are a couple of clunkers as well.

Credit must also be given to the set designers and special effects crew.  I cringed when I saw that most of the optical effects were in fact video effects mastered on film.  I did begin to appreciate how well many of these video effects were actually incorporated into the show and some impressive effects were certainly achieved.

The design of the hovercar looks like something borrowed from a Flash Gordon serial of the 1930's but the prop works very well and allows Logan, Jessica and REM to get from story to story with a minimum of fuss.

A great deal of the show takes place outdoors, but the interior sets are surprisingly large and detailed.  Props and elements were reused from week to week and the sets have that odd 1970's cheap TV look.  However, the set designers obviously had fun and some of the sets are nicely realized.

All in all, I'm very happy to have purchased this DVD.  The 1970's were pretty hit and miss when it came to Sci-Fi entertainment on TV, especially from the three main networks at the time.  However, Logan's Run was certainly a very well done show and its a pity that it wasn't given a chance to meet its full potential.",1336694400,3,3307,4.555932203389831
5004644,4,B006MFQ4OS,"I really liked the Movie ""Logan's Run"" with Michael York. The TV Series just never made it. Jessica and Logan where wandering all over the country side and running into ""Rem"" and situations that never really made good TV viewing. It would have been nice if Jessica and Logan did find sanctuary and have it as a standard back drop to every weeks shows. You know, have other runners get to sanctuary and if a sandman or two would arrive. Have the deprogram in some way. Go back to the city of domes and direct other runners to the new found Sanctuary, etc, etc.",1335830400,,559,4.384615384615385

Recommended!",1335657600,2,293,4.88
5004646,5,B006MFQ4OS,"While I have not purchased the set as yet, I am interested in the fact that there are three un-aired episodes. I have them all on tape (transferred to digital) from the SciFi (now SyFy) Channel and really like them. I thought this series was important in SF TV history and should be remembered.

In my opinion, the book wasn't very good and the film mediocre, with Peter Ustinov's appearance offering the only attraction for me (that and Jerry Goldsmith's terrific score). We all know the plot: in the City of Domes people live a kind of idyllic existence of hedonistic excess until they reach the age of thirty, at which time they must go through the ritual of Carousel to ""renew"". What is really happening is that all who go to Carousel are marked for death. Logan 5 is a Sandman, a kind of policeman who chases down ""runners"" who do not want to lay down their lives in the ritual. Logan meets Jessica 6 who is working with an underground group who have come to the conclusion that Carousel is a lie and that renewal is impossible. They help runners escape ""outside"" and send them to a place called ""Sanctuary."" The city computer knows that this group exists so it sends for Logan, accelerates his life clock (an implant in every citizen's hand that flashes red on their ""lastday"") so that he may infiltrate the group, find Sanctuary and destroy it.

Logan eventually comes to the realization that the promise of Carousel is a lie and decides to run rather than give Jessica and her group over. After a series of harrowing adventures, Logan and Jessica escape from the city and venture outside. Following close on their heels is Francis 7, Logan's partner and best friend. Eventually, they end up in a deserted and overgrown Washington DC. There they meet ""The Old Man"" played by Peter Ustinov. I am not going to go into it too much, suffice to say, Mr. Ustinov's performance and skill at ad libbing elevate the material and is worth the price of admission. Logan tells The Old Man and Jessica that they have to go back to the city. The Old Man will prove that Carousel is a lie, that life is viable after thirty and, hopefully, the people will revolt. Before they go back, Logan and Jessica are confronted by Francis. Logan dukes it out with Francis and kills him. The three leave and return to the city.

Logan and Jessica leave The Old Man at the outskirts of the city and go back in. During Carousel, Logan screams to the rooftops that the ritual is a lie. Naturally he and Jessica are captured. The computer, thinking Logan has found Sanctuary interrogates him but it's no use. Logan must've been watching reruns of Captain Kirk take on Nomad or Landru because he keeps telling the computer ""There IS NO SANCTUARY!"" and computer refuses to believe him. It eventually freaks out and explodes. I guess no one ever considered a backup. In any event, the people now have no direction and have to fend for themselves. They come outside, see The Old Man, realize that Carousel WAS a lie and the movie ends there. Humanity CAN rebuild!

I had to tell you that so I could relate the differences in the overall plot of the series, which make more sense than the movie, to me. First off, the City of Domes is not run by a computer but by a secret council of elders. This council, headed by Morgan Woodward, devised the Carousel ritual as a resources saving measure. By making the life expectancy of everyone thirty, the population of the city is kept to manageable levels. Second, once Logan and Jessica escape, the council gives Francis an offer he can't refuse: if he finds Logan and Jessica and brings them back, he'll be made a council member when the time comes and be able to bypass Carousel altogether. In the movie, Francis bought into renewal until the very end. In the show, he knows renewal is false so it makes it easier to root against him. Sanctuary is still the goal for Logan and Jessica (in the movie, Logan realizes that Sanctuary is as false as Carousel) even when they actually find it in the great episode ""Man Out of Time,"" by David Gerrold who had his name taken off of it for creative differences with the producers.

The addition of REM, the android played by the fantastic Donald Moffat, makes the show. Like Spock, REM is used to comment on the human condition and comment he does. His performance is brilliant.

The only thing they shouldn't have changed was removing the life clocks from the characters. It was the one iconic trapping from the film that made sense.

As far as the series being cheesy. Sorry, it's cheesy for now, but for 1977 every dollar is on the screen. The hover cars, designed by auto customizer Dean Jeffries, were not cheap. Typically, when custom vehicles are called for in a TV show, there are usually three or more. The proof is that when Francis would call a team of Sandmen on the comm for backup they would come driving up in their own hover cars. The sets in the series are lush and well designed. They were using the same laser effects as they did in the movie. They had beautiful matte paintings done by Matthew Yurichich who did the ones in the film. The costumes are even better than the movie.

The music is pretty good too. The theme by Laurence Rosenthal, while not Goldsmith, is a very catchy theme with a lot of synth. Bruce Broughton, Jerrold Immel and Jeff Alexander supply the background scores, most of which are very effective. The music from the series is out on CD and I am going to seek this out too.

Overall, if you are a fan of 70's SF you will appreciate this collection. All episodes uncut in their aired order. I will revise with an update when I have them in hand.",1335312000,5,5645,4.510263929618769
5004647,5,B006MFQ4OS,"I recently finished viewing all fourteen episodes of ""LOGAN'S RUN:  The Complete Series.""  It is great to finally have this series on DVD.  I taped all the episodes back in 1990 when TNT used to air them, so I have had years to enjoy them, but it had been a while since I last watched them, so most of them were new to me, again.  The series is fun and suitable for all ages.  I also have to admit that the quality could have been a little bit better.  A lot of late '70s and '80s series had a harsh film look to them and sometimes I wonder if the original prints look any better.  The editing on commercial breaks where they cut away hard was quite common back then, and sometimes we see the segments fade out and fade in at the commercial breaks.  This appears to have been added optically before broadcast on those particular episodes.  There is at least one or two episodes where the picture jerks at the beginning of every new scene from the opening scenes and main title through the rest of the show.  That was the only thing that I found distressing in watching this series on DVD.  I enjoyed every minute of this series again, but I did forget how goofy science fiction on television was in the late 1970s.  Gregory Harrison as Logan, Heather Menzies as Jessica, and Donald Moffat as Rem were a great combination that worked in my opinion.

I remember my mother running into the room, turning on my black and white TV with a ""clicker"" remote and I remember seeing people walking to ""Carousel."" I was hooked, even at age 7. And I do remember it being preempted often and never could get into the flow of it. Between 77 and today, I saw it a few times in reruns but never had the time to rediscover it.

Now with the DVD release, I get to enjoy it all over again. Once you get past the low budget, you are in for a surprise. Especially when Donald Moffat makes his appearance as REM. His character gave the pilot the needed spark to bringing more ""humanity"" to the show. Despite the low budget, I often could feel the ""bleakness"" of post-war outside and how it drove people to make sects and learn to live again. In the episode ""The Innocent"", my first reaction to the robot was ""goodness no"" but as the episode went along, I saw what DC Fontana was going for in the childlike atmosphere of the episode and really enjoyed it. A fan favorite has been MAN OUT OF TIME. The episode isn't without its amount of cheese but it is the strongest episode of the series and it is very serious sci-fi. I found most of the episodes to be family friendly and my 4 1/2 girl loves the show, especially ""The Innocent.""

And I can't say enough about Donald Moffat in the show. He is a pure delight. And honestly, I wonder if Data in Star Trek The Next Generation was inspired after him.

As a Lost in Space fan, I had to snicker at the amount of sound effects and props used in this series. Even Angela Cartwright shows up in the second episode.

The DVD collection is bottom of the barrel no frills. The menus look worse than consumer editing menus. There are no extras. And despite the video looking sharp most of the time, the age of the film shows and the edits to commercials were odd.

5004652,4,B006MFQ4OS,"We children of the 70's have it rough when it comes to our favorite shows.  The fact is, much of what we grew up watching and loving has not aged well.  I literally had not seen an episode of Logan's Run since the show ended in 1978, and was highly skeptical that it would hold up.  But I'm surprised and delighted to report that the show hasn't aged poorly at all.

[Minor Spoilers Ahead]

For those who only know the 1976 movie of the same name, you should know that the show DOES change a few things.  The pilot, rather than continuing the events of the film, re-imagines them.  While I enjoy the pilot, I do feel it rushes things a bit.  Logan's decision to rebel, for example, happens about six minutes into the episode.  Likewise, the android Rem's decision to join Logan and Jessica feels a bit hurried.  Naturally, the restrictions of 1978 television mean the film's more adult themes have been toned down.

The series also benefits from the contributions of veteran science fiction writers and directors, such as D.C. Fontana, Harlan Ellison, and Alexander Singer.  Even when the acting isn't always stellar, the scripts are usually well thought-out and original.  The special effects and sets (largely matte paintings, but very good ones) are on-par with anything else from the era.  The budget was no doubt helped tremendously by re-using costumes and props (as well as a fair amount of effects shots, especially in the pilot) from the film.

As for the DVD set itself, it's the definition of a ""bare bones"" release.  All you get is the episodes, although it does include 3 episodes that were not part of the series' original run.  There are English & French subtitles.  The picture quality is good for its age, although there does not appear to have been extensive remastering.  Film scratches pop up infrequently.  The audio is clear if unremarkable.  The A/V quality is perfectably acceptable overall, but maybe slightly disappointing for those who have been spoiled by the restoration efforts of shows like the original Star Trek or The Prisoner.

Logan's Run: The Series will probably never be much more than a footnote in the history of sci-fi t.v.  But it deserves a second look.  Like the best episodes of Star Trek or Stargate SG-1, the shows were often ABOUT something.  It's a future that is both frightening and yet often plausible.  And isn't that what science fiction is all about?",1334448000,63,2406,4.765133171912833
5004653,5,B006MFQ4OS,"I watched this the first (and only) time around in late 1977.

While time hasn't always been kind to this series, it has much to offer the contemporary viewer.

The original source material, the sci-fi novel ""Logans Run"" by George Clayton Johnson and William F. Nolan was dark and edgy to the point of being unfilmable.  Still, after years in development hell Michael Anderson/Fox tried in 1976, and came up with a far more memorable interpretation.  If you're part of Generation X, who DIDN'T think of this movie on their 30th birthday?  Still, despite some striking imagery, the movie strayed far from its source material.

That trend continued with the short-lived series.  Gone are the palm flowers, ultra-violence, the computer, and much of the setting from the film.  Such was the necessity for a late 1970s network produced effort.  That didn't stop some very interesting stories from the likes of DC Fontana, Harlan Ellison, and even William F. Nolan himself from taking their new take to our TV screens. ""Crypt"" particularly stands out.

That said, the DVD set is a final, long-awaited addition to the collections of many TV science fiction fans.  It certainly has it's drawbacks - while the writing was occasionally strong and the special effects good for it's time, DVD reveals the low-budget nature of the sets (no wonder much of the series seems to be set in Southern California chapparal.)  Also,  have reasonable expectations - this set appears to have been mastered from syndicated prints, and the age/dirt/grain show.  However, it's still quite watchable, and of course, recommended.",1334275200,7,1600,5.057251908396947

5004655,4,B006MFQ4OS,"The 70's were a transitional time in science fiction both in theaters and on TV. ""Star Wars"" had suddenly made Space Operas with strong visual effects big business and, shortly after, Steven Spielberg checked in with his epic ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"". While there were still plenty of cheap science fiction movies being produced (and occasionally good ones as well), the genre suddenly had a little bit of respect from mainstream Hollywood.

Original novelist William F. Nolan penned the pilot episode (with changes from the producer of the film ""Logan's Run"" Saul David and series producer Leondard Katzman)changing elements from the film. Most likely a fair amount of the rewriting was to simplify the plot and reduce the cost of the pilot. Most fans remember the show pretty well so I'm going to skip the synopsis of the plot in favor of reviewing the quality of the presentation. Interestingly, some of the dialogue from the film is carried over to the TV show.

The series looks decent although it could have used restoration. There are occasional scratches, speckles although after the opening sequence the majority of the episodes are dirt free. There's also some evident print damage. The show looks fairly typical for a late 1970's TV series colors aren't exactly bold and skin tones are a bit on the pink side at times. Sharpness varies with close ups being particularly soft (perhaps a combination of the choices of the DP and just the age of the film).

We get subtitles in English and French and the mono soundtrack is clear.

The 14 episodes are spread over three discs and the dual layered DVDs are housed in an Amray case with a cardboard slip case.

While the series could look better on DVD I'm sure many fans will just be happy that the show has finally arrived on DVD. If you'r a fan of the series, I'd pick this up. Some episodes are better than others of course but if you enjoy 70's TV shows, you'll enjoy ""Logan's Run"". I will admit that I have a nostalgic attachment to the series so keep in mind I have a bias for the show. Having said that the show had some solid episodes and, if given the chance, showed promise.

There aren't any extras and but the series also doesn't require you to jump through a series of previews unlike many DVDs.",1334016000,11,2277,4.651741293532338
5004656,5,B006MFQ4OS,"I acquired this entire series several years ago from Amazon Unboxed (for PC and portable devices like my Creative Zen) using only my Pepsi Points (we drank a lot of Diet Pepsi!). Now I'm happy to order my own physical copy. Sure it seems dated, and it is obvious that the original production budget was somewhat slim. Still, the action is fun, the range of guest stars is surprising, and the stories are interesting. I appreciate that this series is being produced on DVD since the target audience is no doubt quite small, relatively speaking. Add to this the fact that the language is pure and there is no gore, and you have a series even the little ones can enjoy!",1332633600,8,666,4.512396694214876

5004659,5,B006MFQ4OS,"One of the classic series from the 1970s that's been waiting for too long to be released.  Fortunately I recorded it when shown on the UK's Sci-Fi Channel about 5 years ago, but they had butchered it and cut 2 minutes out of most of the episodes.

Lucky for you guys in the States getting this - but I'll bet those of us over here in the UK will have to wait several years for a Region 2 release.  AMAZON, can't YOU put pressure on the distributors and tell them there are legions of fans of this in the UK too?  We're still waiting for region 2 releases of the rest of Six Million Dollar Man, Bionic Woman ..... and everyone wants to see The Fantastic Journey on both sides of the Atlantic!!!",1330819200,6,693,4.18796992481203
5004660,1,B006MFQ4OS,"This was a horrible show. Though the movie veered from the book somewhat, it's actually not bad in it's own right, and stands up on it's own.
But this series, bastardize the concept even further. Combine that with the limits of a weekly tv series budget, and what you have is pure junk. The two leads totally lack any chemistry together. Plus they added a stupid android side kick which they seem to throw into every tv show back in the day, from Buck Rogers's Twiki, to Herbie the Robot on the Fantastic Four 1980 reboot. Ugh. This show is best well to be forgotten. Here is crossing my fingers on a successful feature remake of Logan's Run that is being planned.",1329955200,5,664,4.450819672131147

5004663,5,B006MFQ4OS,"This series is very special to me, as is the music by Laurence Rosenthal which I also have. Sure it is low budget 70s sci-fi but it has a certain charm as REM would say, a characteristic not found in modern sci-fi, kind of romantic in a sense without the unnecessary gore so many modern sci-fi writers use to substitute for a lack of imagination. My husband and I loved watching it again in 2005 when we acquired our bootleg. Now at last we can ditch the poor quality dvd and low-res downloads. Would be nice to have some background info, extra stuff perhaps about the few episodes in the planning that never made it but then perhaps I'm asking too much. At least the completed (originally unaired) episodes will be included. My husband died in 2007 and this series is a reminder of the good times we had together watching our favorite sci-fi. His favorite episodes were Future Past and Man Out of Time. All the episodes differed, aliens, time travel, people found in cryo chambers from the world war, a girl with special powers etc., - all the fun genre rolled into one series that should have made it to two seasons. The Solar vehicle was a great idea, even if it was a bit ugly but the Sandmen groundcars were cool. I wonder why there were no flying pursuit vehicles? Probably budget, but for the low budget this series was made on, it packed a lot of fun and memories. Run Logan, run! Runnerrrrrr!",1328745600,11,1401,4.455252918287938
5004664,5,B006MFQ4OS,"Based on the movie of the same name the tv series is finally given a dvd release. God for years we had to put up with those horrible bootleg dvds. Thank Goodness a decent release is on its way. Logan's Run the tv series had many problems but somehow the exploits of Logan, Jessica and Rem has touched are hearts. For those loyal to the series such as me I just plain love the show. Lots of Sci fi gadgets and computers colorful force fields and a solar powered hovercraft discovered by L and J helps them get through the desert with ease. Very colorful sets and costumes enlivens This series too. And many familiar faces Donald Moffat as the ever lovable android Rem steals the show in many scenes. Randy Powell fresh from Dallas tv series as the ever persistent Sandman on the chase of Logan and Jessica. Played by a very young and handsome Gregory Harrison along with fresh faced Heather Menzies (Robert Urich's wife)and her Farrah Fawcett hairdoo. Tons of Guest stars Like Mariette Hartley,Christopher Stone,Spencer Milligan,Kim Cattrall,Ellen Weston,Nicholas Hammand,Linden Chiles,Leslie Parish,Angela Cartwright, Paul Shenar and Melody Anderson to name a few helped breath life into this series. We even get to go back to the City of Domes for a couple of episodes to view more of the perfect life they lead before they turn 30 years old and become runners who don't believe in renewal reject the carousel ceremony ( a computerized ritual that kills those that have just turned thirty).Population control at its cruelest. A total of fourteen episodes were produced with probably some of the most enchanting sci fi in a long time. One deviation from the movies original premise is in the pilot we find out a chosen few of the population known as the elders are aloud to grow old and a six man council run the entire city in secret and only Specially picked Sandman get to join when and an elder dies of old age. Francis is offered this position if he can bring back Logan and Jessica. And the Sandman are equipped with vehicles of their own to chase Logan and Jessica through the desert.",1326240000,46,2091,4.700272479564033

For the 1970's, some of the special effects were great! Who can beat the hovercraft! I would have like more episodes dealing with the domed city.  Most of them are set outside but there are about 3-4 episodes that deal with the domed cities directly.
Rem is awesome(the orignal data) and jessica is a sexy fox! Loved it.  Can't wait till it comes out on DVD! I will reserve my copy!",1325030400,22,556,4.285714285714286

However, the TV series has little to do with the book or the movie other than:  The first episode; the fact there are sandmen; that the two key characters are looking for santuary; and the outfits.  The 3 ranking is based that the episodes vary from 1 star to 4 stars in my mind, with an average of 2.5 stars, rounding it to a 3 considering the beautiful Heather Menzies is in each episode.
