6166593,3,B00HI9QG9K,"Hannah Lee Baker (Abigail Breslin) is an orphan who lives with her meth head uncle Donny (Lew Temple) and flirty sister Amber (Alexa PenaVega). Meth manufacturing and dealing is the family business run by Uncle Frank (Sean Bean) a strip club owner. Hannah likes to play chess with Billy who was once state champion. She recites poetic metaphors about chess pieces and how they relate to her life.

Frank is the powerful King who has people in his way killed. Hannah forces her way into the business as a delivery person, but inadvertently cause problems between Frank and the biker customers when she cuts the meth with vitamin D. At some point in time, Hannah must choose between family and getting out.

The supporting cast was great. Abigail Breslin was not convincing in the lead role. The chess metaphor was a flop. The poetic readings were simply horrible.

A fair action/drama/thriller rental.

6166594,3,B00HI9QG9K,"""Don't bite the hand that feeds you, understand."" Hannah Lee Baker (Breslin) is a teenager who lives with her older sister Amber in her drug addicted Uncle's Donny's house. Her other Uncle Frank (Bean)  runs the family business, a drug smuggling ring, with the help of his brother. When Donny's drug use threatens to get Hannah and her sister taken away Hannah comes up with a plan to pay the bills and keep things as they are. She goes to work running drugs for Uncle Frank, but the offer he gives her isn't enough so Hannah finds a way to make a little more money. This action affects the entire family. While this movie is actually much better then I expected I will admit that it is because of the cast. If the cast was not full of big name actors it would be a forgotten about B movie, but as it stands the acting really brings the movie up. Breslin does a great job in this and smoothly handles the transition to a more adult role very well. The movie itself isn't anything that original but it is tense at the right times and keeps you guessing just enough to make it entertaining and watchable. I did enjoy this much more then I expected to. Overall, nothing amazing or new but it is entertaining and worth seeing. I liked it. I give this a B+.",1393372800,2,1252,4.305084745762712

6166596,3,B00HI9QG9K,"NEW YORK -- The FBI says a $100,000 reward is being offered for information leading to the recovery of $1.2 million that disappeared from a currency shipment and to the arrest of those responsible.

The FBI says the U.S. currency was stolen sometime between June 21 and June 24 as it was being moved from Switzerland to New York.

The currency shipment was brought to John F. Kennedy International Airport on board a Swiss International Air Lines flight.

The money was discovered missing after a count at the Federal Reserve showed a discrepancy.

The case also is being investigated by police at the Port Authority, which runs the airport.",1407715200,,641,4.853211009174312
6166597,1,B00HI9QG9K,"A presumptuous flop that never delivers.

This POS plays like a highly censored day school version of a screenply assignment penned during recess on the back of a used sanitary napkin.

After 42 minutes I could bear it no longer and just shut it down.

Here's why: awful script apparently written by people who have no idea about Reality, and under some sort of censorship to boot. Obvious scenes that could have made it credible were obviously rendered powerless.

CHARACTERS who freaking WHISPER gravelly sounding lines that I cannot freaking understand, but in an obviously pussy phoney way too dumb to even discuss.

The screenwriter, the director, the producers---EVERYone associated with this stomach-hurling BLAH, should be tarred and feathered.

And the ""3 star"" public---has NO freaking idea anymore what a good film is....

6166598,3,B00HI9QG9K,"Decent film that seems to lack some underlying larger-theme ""oomph"".  Good acting by all; very good by some.  Left me feeling like there was more to the story than was delivered  by the movie.  Interesting/good enough that I was not forced to simply speed through searching for the (limited) scenes that--for me--were the reason to purchase.  Scenes with Sean Bean.  Need I confess more?  I should add that I am not fond of many popular, glossy, glaringly ""Hollywood"" movies.......In my viewing world, a ""good"" movie would be a 4-star, and a ""great"" a 5-star. A 3-star is okay but misses escaping the ordinary--even if some elements are very good.  I believe I mentioned Sean Bean....",1404518400,5,684,4.886956521739131
6166599,3,B00HI9QG9K,"We kept waiting for the ""action"".  We could see the attempts to build suspense as events moved closer and closer and closer (yawn) to action.  Also, the script turned quality actors like Sean Bean into 2 dimensional characters.",1403308800,,227,4.947368421052632
6166600,2,B00HI9QG9K,"Abigail Breslin is one of those actresses that seem to be having no difficulty finding roles.
Costarring in Wicked Blood she dominates the film and not even Sean Bean can pull the spotlight away from her.
This film is written and directed by Mark Young, who does not have a long list of successful films to his credit. The clumsy pace at the start of this film makes watching it a bit of a chore. Despite the fairly well known cast, this movie has some bad acting fighting the plot. Another problem is that its just so predictable that I could have told you the outcome after the first 10 minutes.
Set in present day Louisiana, Breslin plays a tween living among a family of meth cookers and distributors. She is a smart young girl and applies her chess playing skills to try and put an end to all of the family problems. As dealers in what her uncle calls Hillbilly Crack, the family has little trust for one another and no morals at all. Jake Busey gives a good performance and offsets Sean Beans rather unimpressive portrayal as the evil patriarch.
There are a few high points, but not enough to make this film fun to watch. Its a story that has been told plenty of times, and this time is just lackluster. Wicked Blood starts March 4th and was not yet rated when I viewed the movie, but contains plenty of killing, drug use and violence along with brief nudity and sexual situations. Not one for the kids.

I wrote this review for a local website in a rather small town. The very next day the director Mark Young sends me a personal email telling me I had ""an axe to grind""  and I was giving his work a ""hatchet job"". I laughed so hard I almost peed a little. If the obscure website I write for has 3000 views of my review it is about 2900 views more than usual. I was honored to have caught the eye of a Hollywood newcomer and shown the influence I have on filmmakers. Geesh Mark, I didn't like your film, so what? My 100 readers will probably watch some of it on Amazon Prime for free because I mentioned your film. They may not watch the whole movie, but at least they gave it a shot. Crank it down a notch and accept the fact that your work is public and like they always say about opinions ""everybody has one"". You're going to get real tired writing to everyone that hates your work, because half of everybody hates half of every movie made. That's a lot of angry emails to send!",1398902400,,2388,4.2926829268292686

6166602,3,B00HI9QG9K,"Watchable but nothing special flick about Hannah(Abigail Breslin), an orphaned small town Louisiana teen whose family is embroiled in the local drug trade.  Hannah concocts a plan to get out from under the thumb of her oily Uncle Frank(Sean Bean), the local crime head, utilizing moves she learned through hours of playing chess.  The South as depicted here seems inauthentic and since I haven't played chess since I was nine the metaphor was lost on me.  What elevates the film are the performances.  Breslin transitions well into more adult roles.  Bean is requisitely fearsome and Jake Busey is slimy as Frank's brother Johnny.  The best performance offered here is probably by Lew Temple as Hannah's heroin addicted Uncle Donny. Not a complete waste of time as a rental.",1395532800,2,774,5.0078125
6166603,4,B00HI9QG9K,"The plot is pretty much standard fare, but the characters are unique and well crafted. None of them are cut and paste cardboard personalities.

8632988,4,B00HI9QG9K,"As an under-respected little yarn, ""Wicked Blood"" really came out of left field for me, and I was really surprised at the number of bad reviews, especially by some folks who, by their own admission, didn't even watch the whole film (not a very credible review IMO).  You may or may not have been under the impression that Sean Bean (""Uncle Frank"") was the star here, but young Abigail Breslin (playing Frank's niece ""Hannah"") more than holds her own as part of one of the most dysfunctional on-screen families you'll likely ever see (non-cannibal category, LOL) who seem to swarm to drugs like a moth to a flame.  But remarkably, the rest of the cast is right on their heels, including Alexa Vega (as Hannah's older, seemingly distant sister ""Amber"") and Hugh-Jackman-lookalike James Purefoy as Amber's boyfriend.  Regardless of whether it stole plot lines from 1994's ""Fresh"" (which I have not seen), as at least one review pointed out, the performances here, by all, are too praiseworthy to ignore, albeit in more of a dramatic category than action, and more than deserve a full-length viewing.",1524355200,,1096,4.9135135135135135
