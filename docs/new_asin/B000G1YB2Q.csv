However the experience between trying to figure out what is going and and to recognize what is fact and what is just a dream, is unforgetable! The movie is full of mysticism and superstition... I have to admit that I was more curious to see the SRK infamous PORNOGRAPHIC SCENE than rather the movie itself and I was tempted to fast forward to find it but I just got trapped into Maya's world :) Such beautiful world of dreams in where, just as any woman does , all the girl wants is to find true love. Unfortunatelly poor Maya becomes victim of his own desires and she becomes a hostage of her own dream world. I don't want to call her a psycho but let's admit it, all those lovers? The dream scene in where she dreams SRK is going to set himself on fire just to prove his love for her??? Wow...
The best part of watching this movie to me is to see how Shah Rukh Khan has morphed from goofy character into a true god of love:) Compare his look on this movie with the one on OM SHANTI OM Wow! The man is buff  I don't want to sound like the bowflex commercial but how does a 40 something year old man can look so young and strong??? hehe Just to prove that with age not only comes wisdom but sexiness :)

I bought it for that reason, since I am a SRK fan and will pretty buy anything with him in it. But other than that, it was poorly made.",1184371200,2,273,4.074074074074074
