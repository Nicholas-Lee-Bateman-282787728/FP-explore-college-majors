8448404,2,B004YJZ9X6,"Film = barely two (2) stars; subtitles = zero (0) star; restoration = five (5) stars.  Director Shohei Imamura has laid a very large egg with this amateurish, improvised, and un-engaging movie.  (I'm surprised the studio risked damage to its reputation by even allowing its release to art-house circuits!  More about this later.)  The plot deals with the lowest of the low level of yakuza gang members towards the end of the Japanese occupation in the late 1950's.  The direction and acting are so bad that it, well, gives the yakuza a bad name.  (You'll see better productions mounted in high-school plays.)  Then there are the subtitles.  What a mess.  They are so amateurishly long and frequent that the viewer has two basic options: (1) focus on the titles and forego the visuals and most of the dialog; or (2) turn off the subtitles and take your chances with the local (mostly Yokosuka) slang and dialects.  (Of course, there is a third alternative: watch the film both ways--recommend only for those with strong constitutions!)  Interiors meticulously recreate a portion of the local red-light district.  But the action is clearly staged and phony.  Same for the real exteriors where the action looks unreal even though the sets are not.  Cinematography and lighting (wide-screen, black and white) are excellent.  Music seems out of place and mercifully limited mostly to the opening/closing credits.  Costumes often look like they are every-day clothes that belong to the actors.  Now back to the film's title and its impact on the releasing studio's reputation.  The battleships are American and the pigs (the four-legged varieties) are Japanese.  But does the Director also have a culturally inappropriate and insulting metaphor in mind?  The film is ambiguously anti-American.  But seems clearly anti-Japanese.  Skip this turkey.  WILLIAM FLANIGAN, PhD.",1419638400,,1864,5.181208053691275
