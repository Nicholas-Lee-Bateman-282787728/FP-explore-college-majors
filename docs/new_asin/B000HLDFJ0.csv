2638871,3,B000HLDFJ0,"I was not really impressed with the newer DVD offered by Baby Genius.  It was more animated that the previous ones.  My 18-month old son prefers to watch the Childrens Song and Nursery Rhyme DVD over this one.  He really enjoys seeing the children more than the characters.  If this had been the first DVD we purchased, I probably wouldn't have purchased any more.  All in all, it was a so-so DVD for children, but like I said the other DVD's were much better presented.",1168387200,25,470,4.482352941176471

2638882,5,B000HLDFJ0,"I recently searched for this video to purchase it as a gift for a new baby. My granddaughter adored it when she was just old enough to begin watching TV--around 1 year old. Her mom limited her TV viewing time, at the recommendation of their pediatrician. This show, however, features old favorite songs which are sung at a pace appropriate for a very young viewer. The characters and their songs appealed to a young toddler. I think an older child would not find the format interesting.",1431907200,,486,4.662790697674419

Very innovative with a new and more modern approach to traditional songs, with the original words. Bound to be the ""in"" thing in childrens educational-very fun shows. The toys are already coming out and some are expensive, so the toy companies must also think the same. Very entertaining even for adults.",1401926400,,388,4.720588235294118

2638898,5,B000HLDFJ0,"I own this and favorite nursery rhymes, they are very different.  My son is 7 months old and has LOVED LOVED LOVED the bright animation of this dvd since he was about 3 months old.  He has always been a very alert baby who slept 12 hours at night so was awake alot during the day.  I found that this movie would keep him happy in his swing for an hour or so at a very young age.  Now we are more interactive and we sing the ""ABC"" song and ""1-2 I love you"" song.  There are lots of animals, fish and fruits to identify as well. This DVD will also teach him how to spell his name from the ""Frankie prance"".  Yes the songs are silly and they sound like something I might make up.  Yes the animation is not state of the art.  But the contrast in colors and brightness mesmerizes my baby.  I like that there are educational aspects as well.  I do think a 2-3 year old should be watching something with more substance, but the baby up to 2 years old will probably love this.  There are NO live children or animals in this video, only animation. Songs include ""Old MacDonald's Farm"", ""Apples and Bananas"", ""1-2 I love You"", ""ABC"", and each character has a song too ""Frankie Prance"", ""Vinko the Dancing Bear"", ""Obo's his name"", ""My Name's DJ"", and a few other songs.  My son loves it!!!",1315180800,5,1278,4.2139917695473255
2638899,3,B000HLDFJ0,"Before I opened this Christmas present, I looked on here to read the reviews.  I should have read more than just the first few.  This DVD really is poor.  There are not any words where they can read to sing a long to the DVD.  I rather them just listen to their CDs for music than stare mindlessly at the television.  I am so disappointed in this DVD. The graphics are not even that great.  Don't bother purchasing this. Do a search on other sing-a-long DVDs and spend your money more wisely.

My twins are 2 and they are fascinated by it after just one viewing. However, they love music CDs just as much and at least they play with their toys while listening to the CD than just mesmerized by the television.",1293494400,,709,4.285714285714286

2638903,5,B000HLDFJ0,This is very entertaining for a little one.  My grand daughter watches it over and over. It keeps her more entertained than any of the children DVD stories.  She loves music.  We even take the CD along in the car.,1229212800,,213,4.275
2638904,2,B000HLDFJ0,"bought this one without hesitation because my sons love the Nursery Rhymes and Favorite Children Songs so much. songs are repetitive and the DVDs/CDs are short, carrying less songs than the previous ones.",1214611200,2,204,5.212121212121212
2638905,5,B000HLDFJ0,"These are excellent videos for babies & toddlers - my favorite out of all the options, and my daughter's favorite for 2 years.  And they don't try to be something they're not, like the Einstein series.",1211155200,,201,4.583333333333333
2638906,5,B000HLDFJ0,My son loves this DVD. He stands in front of the TV memorized. Even after he has seen it several times he is actually still for most of the DVD. The tunes are very catchy and right up a toddler's alley. I am looking forward to buying more baby genius.,1201824000,,251,4.04
2638907,5,B000HLDFJ0,"I'm the mommy of twin 19 month old boys and they love the Baby Genius ""song"" DVDs. They don't really like tv which isn't the result of anything I've done or not done, they're just always moving and won't stay still long enough to notice most things on tv. However, they love to dance along with the songs on the Baby Genius DVDs.

I spent a small fortune on 8 Baby Einstein DVDs and have been trying repeatedly for the past 14 months to get the boys interested in them. They could care less about those but they fell instantly in love with the Baby Genius Nursery Rhymes DVD the first time I put it in (they were 13 months old at the time)<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Baby-Genius-Favorite-Nursery-Rhymes-w-bonus-Music-CD/dp/B00065EAZU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Baby Genius Favorite  Nursery Rhymes w/bonus Music CD</a>

The animation is simple on this DVD and I get sick of the songs on this one, but my boys love this DVD and that's what counts.

**I highly reccommend the Baby Genius DVDs with songs for any little ones that love to dance around. Not only are they cheaper than the Baby Einstein DVDs but they come with a bonus CD!**",1201564800,,1177,4.989795918367347
2638908,2,B000HLDFJ0,This DVD was disappointing.  The original songs were not that well written.  The familiar songs were not the most familiar versions.  I would not recommend this DVD.,1196640000,,165,5.037037037037037
2638909,1,B000HLDFJ0,"This DVD is terrible!  Don't confuse it with Favorite Nursery Rhymes, which my 11 month old granddaughter loves (and has loved since 6 months).  The animation is cheap looking and cheesy and most of the songs are annoying and uninteresting.  Most of us could write better lyrics!  If my granddaughter enjoyed it I would continue to suffer through it, but she watched this video with a scowl on her face.",1178928000,2,403,4.714285714285714

I didn't realize they were so similar and have a lot of the same songs but my daughter really enjoys the dvd she jumps up and down in her crib and dances along to the music. Really cute dvd with a lot of realistic images not too cartoony. I would recommend.,1484006400,,309,4.081967213114754
