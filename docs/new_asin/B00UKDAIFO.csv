7049616,5,B00UKDAIFO,"I have been practicing the martial arts for 38 years and have been teaching for 23 years and I found this and the other Krav Maga DVD produced and taught by Michael Hodges to be excellent resources for the practice of Krav Maga and for anyone who wishes to learn the basics of effective and efficient self-defense. I am also a police instructor and full-time police officer and I am integrating some of these basic, yet effective, techniques into my training program for the officers who serve on my police department.

Mr. Hodges' teaching style is very straightforward and is appropriate for students and instructors who learn from a variety of learning modalities such as Visual (seeing - Mr. Hodges shows you the techniques), Aural (hearing - Mr. Hodges explains the techniques), and Kinesthetic (doing - Mr. Hodges has the student actually do the techniques with him).

I am also a university professor part-time and a researcher and have a Ph. D. in Education and from my professional background and experience I am aware of what effective learning methodologies looks like; Mr. Hodges has hit the nail on the head with his instructional techniques.

Overall, the cost is fantastic and an outstanding bargain! Do yourself a favor if you are a Krav Maga practitioner, enthusiast, or a martial artist who wishes to add some basic and solid techniques to your training program and purchase both of Mr. Hodges' Krav Maga videos; you will not be disappointed!

7049623,5,B00UKDAIFO,"It is as described and what was expected. Now I have to add more characters to this rating so I won't be annoyed for comments that are not really required. The only time comments are generally made is when a product doesn't live up to expectations or is so extremely, overwhelming superior than its competitor products. Well, that should be enough characters in this rating to satisfy. Bye Bye",1384473600,,393,4.7101449275362315
7049624,3,B00UKDAIFO,"I was expecting it to be more like an exercise video, but it's actually more like watching an educational video.  It does show basic Krav Maga combatives for a beginner though.",1383696000,,176,4.67741935483871
7049625,5,B00UKDAIFO,I think this instructional DVD is great for beginners. The instruction is very easy to follow and understand. I am looking forward to viewing other DVD's in the coarse.,1376006400,,168,4.827586206896552
7049626,5,B00UKDAIFO,"Easy to follow, great system to learn, learned something new each time I put the DVD in. Do not feel like I need to spend years in gym to get the system down, just pop disk in for a little wile each day. Consistent practice and a little drive is all you need.",1375920000,,259,3.9056603773584904
7049627,5,B00UKDAIFO,"The videos take an excellent approach to self defense.  Basic, yet thorough in their content and how they approach the topic of serious self defense in today's troubled world, which by the way may be in your back yard.  These videos were easy to follow and the techniques were well explained and staged for the beginner and early practitioner.  I have some background in Aikido from many years ago, and I chose these videos and the techniques taught here to be able to end a serious situation before it gets worse.  FYI one should always avoid conflict and be aware of your surrounding and potentially dangerous situations.  Never go looking for trouble no matter how confident you are in your abilities.  Be prepared but be wise!",1375315200,2,730,4.753968253968254
7049628,5,B00UKDAIFO,"Great video for teaching beginner crav maga. I have been doing martial arts since I was 8, so 20 years total w/ different disciplines of martial arts. I bought this video for my girlfriend and she really liked it and so did I. This video teaches intro level moves that are basic but can really  help you out in a bad situation. My girlfriend has no experience with martial arts but this video has taught her a lot and she has picked it up really well. I really liked the multiple angles they show on the video so you can see everything and how it is done correctly. I also liked the scenarios they covered in the video because they are very common occurring situations when someone tries to attack and harm you. All in all a great video.",1375142400,,737,4.302158273381295
7049629,5,B00UKDAIFO,"This is a great DVD & easy to follow. Michael Hodge does a great job walking you threw everything & the techniques are easy to follow. I really enjoyed the video & plan on ordering more down the road. My wife likes it too. Not sure why all the negativity? Here's a fact, someone is walking down the streets of a major downtown area. An attacker comes out of nowhere to attack, rob, or rape them. Without this video you have learned nothing (unless you took the martial arts through a classroom) & you do nothing. You are a victim. At least with this you have not only a fighting chance, but if you really take in the methods & practice them, you will come out ahead of a bad situation. Am I saying this will always work out for you? Maybe not. I'm a conceal carry citizen so I first rely on that, but if I cannot get to my gun in time, I'm going to defend myself or wife & then I will be in the best position to take care of the situation. You are not going to be an expert watching videos alone, you must apply the lessons, practice the techniques, & continue to learn & get better. This video is well worth the < $20 price tag so grab a copy!",1375142400,,1144,4.066371681415929
7049630,5,B00UKDAIFO,"One of the best DVD's I've seen.  The way it is broken down makes it easy to understand and practice one skill at a time.  If someone wanted to learn Krav Maga and was unable to receive personal, face to face instruction this is the DVD set I would recomend.",1375142400,2,258,4.14
7049631,1,B00UKDAIFO,"Consumers, should you buy these and actually do these techniques, I can say with a clear conscious that you will not only not survive the attack, but you will also get whoever is with you injured as well.
Please do your research and take Krav Maga from a reputable teacher, not from a DVD.

I am truly disgusted with this. As a Krav Maga Instructor, I take the empowering and educating of lives very seriously. This is garbage and someone will get at best injured and at worst killed doing the B.S on these DVD'S",1374624000,5,512,4.389473684210526
7049632,1,B00UKDAIFO,"Hi,

Saying this is Krav Maga DVD is about as equally true as saying this is Kung Fu because there is kicking and punching in it (and even that is done terribly).
Having watched the DVDs I could swear I had mistakenly ordered a more comedic, longer version of that Jim Carrey sketch.
After 7 years of hard sweat and sacrifice I got my instructors T-shirt with the IKMF. So its very infuriating to see so-called 'instructors' teaching such rubbish to the public and giving the genuine folk a bad name.

My issues with this material

1. This is not Krav Maga (not even the basic principles of defence/attack are adhered too)
2. This stuff will get you killed (more likely because you'll think you're a black belt after 5 dvds)

Is that not enough reasons for you?

Save your money..I strongly suggest you do a little research and sure enough you'll be able to find a reputable KM organisation with a school more local to you. Classes are great, friendly and they the most important thing for your journey...an Instructor.",1374624000,4,1019,4.607734806629834
7049633,1,B00UKDAIFO,a complete load of rubbish nothing remotely resembling Krav Maga here but if you would like to waste your money or would like to buy it to prop your bed up or fancy an expensive drinks mat this is for you for anyone else actually wanting to learn Krav Maga stay we'll clear this is a con and utter useless rubbish and I'm a fully certified Krav instructor who spent 23 days at 180 hours of intensive training to get my instructors certificate not someone who made a few moves up and decided to con people by making a DVD,1374624000,4,520,4.21
7049634,1,B00UKDAIFO,"I am an Expert Krav Maga Instructor with the IKMF with 24 years experience. Becoming an Instructor requires years of very hard work under tight supervision by the best people in the world. Krav Maga is NOT a joke, it is about life and death and to see clowns like Mr. Hodge who knows absolutely nothing of Krav Maga make money with these outrageous videos where every single technique will get you killed in the street, mostly crap he made out or took from karate, it just sickens me.
What you see in this DVD is NOT Krav Maga, not even close. Even if it was, one does NOT learn with a DVD (M. Hodge offers black belts though DVDs!) anymore than you can learn to fly a Boeing with a DVD. DO NOT waste your money and instead go train with serious federations, a little Internet research will help you locate a real Instructor.
On the other hand if you are a serious Krav Maga student and want to watch a hilarious comedy, that product might be for you, many laughs assured!",1374624000,12,972,4.316939890710382
7049635,5,B00UKDAIFO,I was skeptical at first because I did not find it easy to sit in front of a computer and watch and try things at my desk. If I had a DVD player and could take this to a work out area it would be excellent.,1374192000,,206,3.5
7049636,5,B00UKDAIFO,"The three Krav Magra DVDs gave good instruction in how to disable an assailant and break free. I have had training in Army military police and Judo classes.  This is much better than sport Judo.

Its better to view the videos with a work- out partner; pausing the DVD to try a few of what you have learned.  You will learn faster by having actual practice as you learn.",1364428800,,369,4.318840579710145
8707166,5,B00UKDAIFO,"Brilliant video. Michael South and his partner (Matt, was it?) do an excellent job, demonstrating the techniques, explaining good offensive and defensive moves, and also I like the Krav Maga style because of its emphasis on arm work rather than kicking. A kick is a very powerful move, and can be deadly. The problem is that I cant land one, and to make my problem worse, I have very little flexibility. It looks cool in a movie, the spinning reverse crescent or roundhouse kick. Some people can pull that off, but I never could. Also, I just couldn't spin. So I like this style, and this video really has intelligent information. Im going to watch it a few more times, and then decide how to get started.",1529020800,,705,4.559055118110236

8707169,4,B00UKDAIFO,I have taken lessons in KRAV and use this as a review/for practice. I think it offers comprehensive coverage. I have a minor format issue but otherwise think it is a very good portrayal of combatives.,1469145600,,200,4.583333333333333
8707170,5,B00UKDAIFO,I really appreciate u getting back to check and c how I'm doing I really like the videos so far I have lots of physical problems but I do what I can to pmodify my work out what I like about your videos is there simple and to the point I've been involved with martial arts for 45 years and have always loved it please keep in touch thanks again,1461542400,,343,3.914285714285714

8707172,5,B00UKDAIFO,Excellent,1457136000,,9,9.0
8707173,4,B00UKDAIFO,"I love this video. Fast shipping. Good communication. The only thing I would suggest is more care as far as handling the product before and during shipping. I ordered the workout dvd and the basic combatives dvd. I recieved the basic combatives dvd case broken on one corner but tge dvd worked perfectly so I kept, and the workout dvd scratched due to it not being placed correctly in the case. I inspected the dvd and noticed scratches on it but still decided to try it in the player. After trying the dvd it started to stop and skip so I returned it thru amazon and bought a replacement. I quickly received the replacement and had the same issue with the dvd not placed correctly in the case and scratched, tried the dvd and it worked this time around so I went ahead and kept it. I just think its a shame such a good video has these production issues.",1456272000,2,854,4.34375
8707174,5,B00UKDAIFO,Ordered and it arrived really fast. Seller is very professional. Absolutely love the DVD. Exactly what was expected. Will definitely order the next level especially from the this seller. Thank you much!!!,1454630400,,204,5.40625
8707175,5,B00UKDAIFO,Perfect! Just what I needed to get started. The DVD shows the basic moves that everyone needs to ultimately master Krav Maga. The DVD arrived even sooner than I had expected.,1452470400,5,174,4.645161290322581
