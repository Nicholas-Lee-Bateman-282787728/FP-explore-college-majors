3070995,5,B0011ZJ53G,"This video is a wealth of information on mycology for those new to the field.  The DVD effectively shows you how to do all the major steps in the mushroom growing process in an easy to understand, well organized manner.  From cakes to bulk substrates, this dvd has it all.

I particularly loved the section on agar strain isolation.  If you are already experienced in growing mushrooms but haven't been adventurous enough to step into agar work yet, then this dvd is for you.  The author has made all steps of agar work easy to follow for even new mycologists.  The video segment on agar is worth the cost of the DVD by itself, and yt there is so much more to this dvd.

A GREAT BUY!

3070997,5,B0011ZJ53G,"Wow, it's a no-brainer to give 5 stars to this 2 DVD set!

I had previously purchased a copy of Paul Stamets ""The Mushroom Cultivator"", so this time I ordered  ""Growing Gourmet and Medicinal Mushrooms"" and the ""Let's Grow Mushrooms"" 2 DVD set by Marc R Keith at the same time.  I really like the straightforward approach to teaching how to grow and cultivate mushrooms that is presented in this instructional DVD.

""Let's Grow Mushrooms"" skips all the technical/scientific jargon about pleurocystidia, basidium, cheilocystidia, etc., which is all great to know for us mycology geeks, but is really confusing and completely unnecessary for beginning growers who just want to get started learning how to grow mushrooms at home.  ""Let's Grow Mushrooms"" begins and ends with specific hands-on video demonstrations of extremely easy to follow techniques that will have you starting to grow mushrooms the very day you receive your DVD, using materials readily available from your local grocery store or nursery.

Detailed video techniques on using brown rice as both a spawn and substrate open the DVD, and it then progresses from there through the production of grain spawn, growing mushrooms on straw, manure, sawdust/woodchips, and finally finishing up on disk 2 with the more advanced techniques you'll use later on to isolate strains, and also to isolate healthy mycelium from contaminants on agar.  All techniques are presented in a clear, visual format, and the music, pictures, and graphics are first-rate quality.

If you've been lost trying to figure out exactly what steps you need to perform to cultivate mushrooms at home, or if you're a visual learner, this 2 DVD set is for you.",1201392000,26,1687,5.109090909090909

These guys show you almost everything you need to know when it comes to growing mushrooms...almost any kind.  They show how to collect spore prints, make syringes, inoculate jars, spawn to bulk substrate, clone, work with grain and agar, and so much more.  The videos do not spend much time on fruiting parameters because these are species specific and vary quite a lot.

On to the video; I saw another reviewer say that the video has a lot of slow transitions and stuff. If you can't have the patience to sit through 2 hours of a video about growing mushrooms, then you do not have the patience to grow mushrooms. It is a very slow process that you have to put care heart into it if you want to see results. Don't be discouraged, nothing is more exciting than watching tiny pins erupt into beautiful mushrooms.

This video for the most part does everything in a very professional way with as little room for error as possible. If some of the stages seem daunting, there are other ways to do some of the methods in cheaper and faster ways if you do searches but they have their downfalls too. His agar method intimidates me, my first attempt will be with a ""no-pour"" tek I've found elsewhere which works okay enough.

All in all this is an incredible instructional video, and even if you want to branch off and do things differently this is still one of the best places you can start. He explains the whys and hows you are to do things, which is essential if you want to avoid problems and headaches later.

I think it goes to say, without a doubt, even if these are from a book, some people don't have time or the attention span to read 500 pages of books to get this information and not don't get to see it done in front of them. If you don't watch, it becomes trial and error, if you watch (and read?) it becomes a more likely chance to not fail.

Thanks RR for putting them in a video, but you should give credit to Paul Stamets. He is a great mushroom mediator and should be given credit. Unless you have originally come up with all of this info, it should be given credit.

8243192,4,B0011ZJ53G,"Most of the information in the videos I either knew, or was familiar with. I had to learn much of it the hard way, though. Had I known more specifically the info contained in them I could have saved myself thousands of dollars worth of trial and error over the past couple years. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is there is entirely too much time spent showing jars being filled and baskets being packed. Most people don't need to spend five minutes watching someone mix horse manure or fill jars when a 30 second time would have sufficed. There are also some ""hacks"" that are used that I would stay away from. But...everyone has to find out what does, or does not, work for them. It's truly and art from, growing mushrooms. The people in the movies have a web presence on shroomery, too, and they do a great service for the beginning, as well as the experienced mycophile. Happy mushrooming!",1429747200,,904,4.484848484848484

8243197,3,B0011ZJ53G,"First let me say that if visual learning is your thing or you are impatient , then this is a good bet. It contains quite a bit of info. However everything in here can be had for free on YouTube or thru an online cultivation forum. Also I purchased the mycology ""Bible"" along with this and it has all the same info plus some, and it was 20 bucks less. Still if you learn best from watching then this is a good bet.",1420848000,,413,3.9879518072289155
