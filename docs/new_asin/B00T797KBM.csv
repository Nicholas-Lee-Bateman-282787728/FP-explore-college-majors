7002723,5,B00T797KBM,"Being a lover of talking dogs since childhood, I was extremely lucky to come across this show by accident online. And now it's finally here on DVD! Created during the heyday of 90's hand-drawn animated television, this show follows the exciting, and often humorous, adventures of five humanoid canines as they battle Canomutants, giant fleas and a nutty US Captain. Great animation, great writing, and just a great program all over. I'm so glad it's out of the computer and in DVD form. I recommend it!",1423872000,3,502,4.848837209302325

I admit, I never watched the show when it first came on, but someone on YouTube who's a big RR fan, did several videos talking about the show, and it got me interested.  I purchased a copy and I can honestly say that I wasn't disappointed.  The characters are all likeable, the comedy in this show is a hit for me, and the voice-cast is terrific.  It's a shame that this series is only short-lived and 13 episodes long.  Just so everyone knows, Episode 13 on this set is the edited version.  Still though, if you loved this show growing up, pick it up.  If you're new to the show, give it a chance, you might enjoy it.",1434672000,4,669,4.2204724409448815

7002738,4,B00T797KBM,"I didn't hear of this show until 2008 (well after the show ended). I believe I was browsing on deviantART and came across something related to this. Once I had heard that this show existed, I decided to check it out and I liked it. It had the involvement of some people that were involved with more well-known 90's WB cartoons like Tiny Toons and Animaniacs, from some of the same writers to voice actors and music composers.

I'm glad that this finally got a DVD release because I was definitely interested in buying it if it ever came out. It doesn't have any special features, but I wasn't expecting much anyways. The last episode has the Russian Name Song removed which I can kind of understand since the controversial part of it is not as sneaky as something like the fingerprints joke from Animaniacs, but I think it would've fine to leave in.

One major problem I do have with this DVD is that apparently it cannot be sold by any retailers outside of the US (not even Canada) which is a big problem for anyone living in Canada like myself that wants to buy this. Animaniacs & Tiny Toons can be sold in Canada, so why not this one. This makes it much more expensive for Canadians to buy a copy because of the exchange rate and shipping costs (usually totalling at least $50 CAD). I'm glad I got a really good deal on my copy.

Overall, I think this DVD set is worth the money for any fan of the show.",1430611200,2,1406,4.318181818181818

...

I am one of the many people who have recently attempted to get 'Road Rovers' onto DVD by posting a journal on my DeviantArt page reminding people about what a great show it was, and that its existence, and sudden subsequent cancellation, are shrouded in both legal mystery and personal (personal, as in Warner Brothers' feelings for the show itself back in the 1990's) mystery.

'Road Rovers' first aired in September of 1996, and ended its only season in February of 1997.  I was only four when it aired and turned five shortly before its end, so I was really young.  But one thing is exceedingly true:  I never forgot it.  Even after it stopped playing in reruns on Cartoon Network sometime in 2000.

While on air, 'Road Rovers' gained a massive cult following, and had some of the highest ratings for a Warner Brothers cartoon.  I mean, what was NOT to like about it?  It was a show chock full of the greatest animal species on Earth:  dogs!  It had the slapstick humor the 1990's generation is known for; it had likable characters with a memorable voice cast (including Jeff Bennett and my third favorite singer of all time:  Sheena Easton).  A show like this one had the makings to be a lasting cartoon for Warner Brothers, but it came to an abrupt end, even with commercials mentioning a second season, as well as a Christmas special to air in December of 1996 or 1997.  Sadly, neither of these ever happened, and us 90's kids were forced to forget this fundamental segment of our childhood cartoon regiments.

As I mentioned already, there was a lot of mystery surrounding the cancellation of 'Road Rovers.'  In all honesty, the show was making good money for Warner Brothers when crunching in the ratings.  However, there was no marketing whatsoever for it.  No toy line, no video releases, no costumes...  Nothing, nada.  I would have killed to have a Colleen action figure (she was this little girl's favorite character) and my identical twin sister would have done the same for a Hunter one, but, alas, no such merchandizing was done for this brilliant show.  Not only was there nothing to engage us outside of watching it, the show itself had its obvious loopholes and inconsistencies (none of which can be blamed on the show's creators and those who helped make it; blame the head honchos at Warner Brothers making all the decisions).  That biologist named Eugene Atwater (""Still a Few Bugs In the System""), who was a good guy at the end of that episode, was, for some reason, locked up in an institution with Zachary Storm in ""Take Me To Your Leader.""  Obviously, there was an episode or two missing with him in an enemy role.  Also (while these don't show up on the DVD and weren't on the Cartoon Network reruns), some of the episodes (including ""Let's Hit the Road"" and ""Reigning Cats and Dogs"") are actually revealed to be in parts.  When 'Road Rovers' first aired, ""Let's Hit the Road"" was actually titled ""Let's Hit the Road Part One"".  Most damning, ""Reigning Cats and Dogs"" aired as ""Reigning Cats and Dogs Part Three.""  If you don't believe me, I do have original VHS recordings on my MediaFire account, and I'd be happy to pass those out to prove it).  Along these lines, the episodes themselves have no congruity, and two of them (""Dawn of the Groomer"" and ""Still a Few Bugs In the System"") have a different theme song entirely.  This also helps stand to reason that there are plenty of episodes Warner Brothers had left out.  Plus, there were supposed to be fourteen episodes in the first season, but one was lost.  There is no information whatsoever on what this episode was about, but if it was set to air but never did, it must have had its share of crude jokes that the figure heads at Warner Brothers just couldn't stand to bear...

Now, just what were the reasons for why the show got cut short?  Nothing as far as specifics have ever been confirmed, but myself and other fans have stirred the pot of speculations for years.  As previously mentioned, the show was incongruent and flawed.  Warner Brothers did not fund it well enough to sustain a decent season.  Why?  Because the show lacked an ""educational"" factor, according to the government.  Shows like 'Captain Planet' were being favored over shows like 'Road Rovers' by educators and the government because these people felt that this (and many other great cartoons us 90's kids had) wonderful show was contributing to the downgrading intelligence of children.  Come on!  'Road Rovers' gave me a pretty decent geography lesson as a kiddie, and an excellent sense of different cultures and their attached accents (you got your British accent from Colleen, Russian from Exile, Scottish from the Groomer -and Sheena Easton herself, who hailed from Scotland -to name a few).  I have read that this rejection made the people working on the show upset that their project wasn't being treated as well as others, but Warner Brothers did not care about that one bit.

Segregating from the educational factor, the core of 'Road Rovers' was its appealing humor that flew over young children but gave your adults and teenagers a laugh.  Some of this humor, sad to say, was a wee bit too crude for some people.  Colleen mentioned ""singing soprano into their eighties"" in reference to a bunch of enemies getting slapped in the crotch in ""Where Rovers Dare,"" and a couple minutes before that, Hunter kicked one in the nuts.  Plus, several Exile and Blitz bits contained anti-gay remarks (saying that Blitz needed therapy for kissing another man, for example), which probably caused this extreme minority group some offence back in the late 90's.

I'm separating this one because it is my one reason for bumping down the rating I'm giving this DVD release.  The final episode of 'Road Rovers' (and my personal favorite one), ""A Day In the Life,"" contains what many of us fans believe to be the smoking gun for the death of the show.  During their interrogations by Parvo, Exile's part became a parody of the phrase, ""son of a b***h,"" and was called ""Sonovovich,"" because of the hilarity of naming children in Russia.  Due to it sounding too much like the cuss word, this entire part was scrapped in later reruns (my original tapes on my MediaFire still have the song, if anyone wants to see it), as well as -for some peculiar reason -on this DVD release.  For goodness sake, ADULTS are buying this to recapture their childhoods!  Wouldn't we have wanted to see this part and laugh at it because it flew over our heads as children?  Did Warner Archive worry that little children would somehow find offence in it if they watched it with their parents?  I don't understand why this part got deleted out of the release.  Honestly, I feel cheated by it.  I was so hoping to see it on here, but my hopes were dashed.  At least I still have it on my tapes for posterity, albeit in terrible condition due to age...  But, really, if they really wanted to care enough about the show's fans, they could have made an edited DVD release AND an UNedited one.  It sure would have been a nice gesture on Warner Brothers' part...

Lastly, I did hear something about a lawsuit as a reason for the show's cancellation.  While it is a rumor, it has merit, and a name:  Wing Puppies (I originally thought it was called Dyno Mutts, but I was mistaken).  Meaning?  Well, apparently, there was someone by the name of Bruce Blumenfeld who came to Warner Brothers with an idea for a show, titled Wing Puppies.  I know nothing about the details behind this idea (and how similar it was to the 'Road Rovers' we all know and love), but, according to the rumor, the idea was turned down by the studio.  But, the guy behind the Wing Puppies idea claimed 'Road Rovers' was stolen from his plans, and he sued Warner Brothers for copyright infringement, among other things.  If this all actually occurred, he must have won, hence why this DVD comes close to fifteen years since 'Road Rovers' saw airtime.  However, court cases all are a matter of public record, and I don't know if this is all findable.  I've heard that it is, and I've heard that it isn't.  I'm not entirely sure which side I stand on, but if I had to choose, I'd say this whole legality thing is probably true, considering the lack of funding, the obscurity, and the overall lack of interest in the show by Warner Brothers.  Who knows; perhaps Warner Brothers knew they were stealing someone else's ideas and didn't merchandize the show too well to keep it on the sly -to no apparent success obviously...

So, in conclusion:  yes, FINALLY Warner Brothers listened to fans and released the greatest cartoon ever onto DVD!  But, no, if you're a 90's kid looking for ""Sonovovich,"" you are NOT going to find it on this DVD.  I'm not going to post my email, but if anyone wants to see ""Sonovovich,"" I'm Passionworks on DeviantArt.  Make an account and send me a note.

This massive monstrosity of a review comes from a devoted, loyal fan who has done her research over the years.  I was one of the many people trying desperately to get something out of Warner Brothers, and at last the wait is over!  Maybe in another fifteen years ""Sonovovich"" will have its day on DVD; who knows?

'Road Rovers' was and forever will be the greatest show Warner Brothers ever created, and it's so awesome that it now exists on DVD, albeit in edited form.  So, ""Let's hit the Road, Rovers,"" and get on buying/watching this DVD!

...

The reason this review got deleted on Warner Brothers' site is not mine to know, but it wouldn't surprise me in the least that it possibly had something to do with the undisputable fact that everything I wrote on there is the truth in how they have steadfastly felt about this beloved cartoon.  Releasing 'Road Rovers' as a ""complete series"" is an absolute lie, hence the lack of five stars on both here and on Warner Brothers' site.  Warner Brothers has always had an issue with this masterpiece of a cartoon and forever will.  A DVD release and over fifteen years without airtime, it seems, has not changed this.

7002745,5,B00T797KBM,"Just watched all 13 episodes in one day, seriously it's that good, you'll be hooked after 5 minutes and laughing till the last. The only downer is the exclusion of one scene involving the Russian name song, episode 13, that involves the name sonovavitch or something, but this can be seen in grainy format on YouTube and could be just a mistake as the very controversial previously excluded scene involving Prince Charles and Princess Diana is included. I'm not overly bothered by lack of extras and the small amount of episodes is what keeps this series fresh, just wish I could borrow Shag's bazooka for my alarm in the morning.",1424304000,3,630,4.736363636363636

8700787,5,B00T797KBM,"While the 2-disc set lacks special features, it is absolutely awesome to finally have access to this show. Road Rovers is a fun, snarky, tongue-in-cheek parody of the more serious ""Humanoid Animal Hero"" cartoons of the time. It gained a cult following from its original run on WB, and subsequent run on Cartoon Network, following its abrupt cancellation (fans protested the cancellation by sending in tennis balls to the Warner Bros. Studios). This is a must-have for the fans who have been waiting so long to see one of their favorite shows again. I gladly recommend this to anyone with a good sense of humor and a love of mid-90's era cartoons.

A few words of warning for those not familiar with the show: It is really not PC, and some of the references may come across as being a bit dated (the cartoon was made circa 1995). And there are a few dark and emotional moments, that are rare for cartoons of this type. There are also some high-brow jokes that may take a bit of research to understand. In my own opinion, these are not bad things. But some more sensitive or younger viewers may not be an appropriate audience for this cartoon.",1503619200,,1141,4.565853658536585
