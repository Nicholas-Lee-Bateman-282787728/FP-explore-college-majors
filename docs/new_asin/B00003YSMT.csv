7919552,4,B00003YSMT,"Leo and Turtle, Blue Puppy, Flying Ship - are among the best cartoons for kids made in the Soviet Union.  ""Flying Ship"" is styled like a Russian fairy tale, with some modern kicks.  Funny songs and interesting story.  Made in early 80s.  ""Baby-Leo and the Big Turtle"" is a short (10 - 15 minutes) cartoon featuring one really cute song (the Lion and the Turtle are presented on the cover of the tape, so you can imagine how it looks like).
""Blue Puppy"" is a musical, quite long.
These cartoons are my favorites since I was a kid.  Recommend them for kids 6-99 years old.",1081123200,2,570,4.390476190476191
