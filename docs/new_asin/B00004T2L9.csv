8483012,5,B00004T2L9,"I love this video because its taught by my very own Yoga Guru whom I learned from. It only takes 30 minutes in the privacy of your own home. When its too late to go to the gym after being gone all day, this is the most ideal way to get your respiration and energy moving again. Instead of coffee in the morning, it's also an excellent way to start the day especially to increase flexibility and to clear the mind. Kathy Lee is an awesome teacher and has the ability to make yoga feel meditative. She has a great style and is quite gentle and even ecclectic. Lets face it, Yoga is a workout for the soul as well. A flexible, life awareness exercise which is ""sort of like a workout from the inside out.""
You'll feel great!
