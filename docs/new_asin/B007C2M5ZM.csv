5074779,5,B007C2M5ZM,"This is the first real documentary of Philmont and is long overdue.  That said, there may not need to be another because of how good this one is.  It steps you through Philmont's history with some interviews of those who were there including film clips from around the time Waite handed the property over to the Boy Scouts.  The film continues following the trek of a crew of Venturers who had never been to Philmont or done much of any extended trekking.  One of the leaders had been to Philmont, but during the trek has to be taken to Basecamp for injuries.  As you follow this crew, you see some of the changes in how they accept the difficulties they endure as well as how they fall in love with Philmont.  It is summed up by one of the Venturers who came with a lot of questions, but through Philmont, he had gotten the direction he needed.  I think what he was saying and I wish I could have quoted him, that you learn a lot about priorities in life through participating in an adventure like Philmont offers.

Aside from following a crew and the history section of this film, there is also video of the sights and sounds of Philmont.  Through all of it, though at times there are multiple camera angles, all was shot by one man Larry McLaughlin who hike the trails with the crew, having to carry not just the video equipment, but periodically take the batteries to other locations for charging.  The quality of the picture and sound is high and the extent that Larry has captured what Philmont is to those who have been is extraordinary.  I HIGHLY recommend this to anyone wanting to know more about Philmont or wanting to remember the incredible beauty of Philmont they experienced on a trek.",1330214400,8,1700,4.487012987012987
5074780,5,B007C2M5ZM,"This video is great for anyone who wants to know more about Philmont, as well as those who have been there and want to remember.  The history of Philmont presented in the first half of the video is very thorough and is fun to watch, showing video footage of the early days of the Ranch.  Following a crew's actual trek in the second part of the film shows a very realistic picture of a trek at Philmont, including both the ups and downs that can happen.",1330214400,2,453,4.255813953488372
5074781,5,B007C2M5ZM,"I got this movie as a gift from my parents, who knew how special my Philmont experience was.  I sat down to watch it with my Dad, who went with my Venture crew and to our surprise it chronicled a crew on the exact same trek that we went on!  Watching this brought back so many memories it even made my dad tear up at the end (and me a little too).  The director did a fantastic job capturing the essence of Philmont.  If you have been you will really enjoy it, if you are planning to go it will get you pumped up for sure.  Even 2 months after seeing this I can still say with great enthusiasm I WANT TO GO BACK TO PHILMONT!!",1330214400,6,625,3.9285714285714284
5074782,5,B007C2M5ZM,"This documentary is second to none in trying (yes trying - nothing beats going) to capture the experience of a Philmont Trek.  I first became aware of Larry's talents as he is a member of the Tobasco Donkeys, a true-to-Philmont band of bluegrass musicians helping us relive those campfire programs.  Now Larry, through his excellent filmaking skills, has captured the experience of a trek.  Since I trekked in 2006 I have tried to share the essence of the experience with others, and this documentary does it well.  I even puchased one for my Father-in-Law whose ol' frame prevents him from going on his eleventh trek.  But after going ten times, he still has moments of joy while watching this film.
If you are trying to decide what a trek would be like before going, or you want to relive the trek you took in the past (6-11-L1), take some advice from this Scoutmaster, buy this DVD.  You won't be disappointed!",1330214400,3,913,4.675
5074783,5,B007C2M5ZM,"This video does a great job of sharing the Philmont experience.  Part of the video provides a background on the rich history of the area, from ancient Anasazi Indian tribes, logging, mining and western lore.  The other part of the video shows how a ten day backpacking trip can change the lives of young men and women.  I highly recommend this video if you are planning a trek on the Philmont Scout Ranch.",1330214400,3,405,4.52054794520548
5074784,5,B007C2M5ZM,"Picked this up at the Philmont Trading Post while attending the Philmont Training Center (which, in itself, needs to be experienced) last year.  This is a great documentary about the history and happenings at one of the most beautiful places in the United States.  The quality is great and the production is very professional.  Being from Texas, I really enjoyed the story of the crew as they experienced their trek.  After seeing this with my family, it confirmed to us that we were going to have to participate in a trek also...now scheduled for 2013...!",1330214400,2,556,4.821052631578947
5074785,5,B007C2M5ZM,"This is an incredible movie, a must-have for anyone interested in reliving the Philmont experience ... or for those that have a difficult time explaining their experience to those that have never been.  The quality is amazing!  Larry did an excellent job with this.  My disc arrived in a matter of days and the Black Mountain Films customer service is top-notch.  I highly recommed this item.",1330214400,,392,4.893939393939394
5074786,5,B007C2M5ZM,"This movie brought back so many memories for these two 1990's staff members, from the history of the ranch to the real experience of participants on the trails. The videography made my heart jump and eyes water. I was so proud to share this movie with my family and now, even more than ever, my kids talk about "" when we go to Philmont"".
I would recommend this movie to all past present and future Philmont participants, scouters everywhere, Recreation Management students and professionals, and fans of history of the  American West.
Can't wait to watch it again.",1330214400,,564,4.755102040816326
5074787,5,B007C2M5ZM,"Mr McLaughlin was able to capture the spirit and passion so many have found at Philmont.  Being a participant and former staff member, ""The Philmont Documentary Collection"" brought back memories of wonderful times with friends and co-workers.  This film is a fantastic representation of life on the trail and some of the many experiences you will encounter and cherish while at the ranch.  The historical insights provided added more depth and appreciation for a place I hold dear.  Thank you Larry for such a wonderful job.",1330214400,2,524,5.058139534883721
5074788,5,B007C2M5ZM,"I am flattered to be pictured on the cover of this Philmont DVD. I was in the first ""Kit Carson Man"" high-adventure program they had there over 40 years ago.",1386201600,,157,4.266666666666667
5074789,5,B007C2M5ZM,I've spent many summers serving as an advisor to Boy Scout crews at Philmont.  This tells the story well. Thanks.,1377907200,,113,4.65
5074790,5,B007C2M5ZM,"I bought this for my sons at Christmas.  I trekked Philmont once with my older son, twice with my younger son, and attended the winter Kanik program with both.  This DVD captures much of the magic of Philmont from the eyes of trekkers.  It captures the highs and lows, the challenges and successes of the Philmont experience.  I highly recommend this DVD for any who have experienced a Philmont trek and also for those who are interested in going in the future.  After watching the presentation, all I can say is that ""I wanna go back to Philmont!""",1363392000,,548,4.551020408163265
5074791,5,B007C2M5ZM,Loved hearing the history of Philmont.  The documentary's scenery is beautiful and provided a lot of important information.  I have 2 Scouts that are even more excited for their trip out there this summer!,1359504000,,205,5.0
5074792,5,B007C2M5ZM,"I coordinate our council's contingent trip to Philmont each year.  This is the best training tool I have for first time trekkers (2nd and 3rd timers, too!)  The interviews and footage drive home the level of preparation required for a Philmont trek, and explain the ranch incredibly well.  Mr. McLaughlin's documentary should be in every trekker's collection.

5074793,5,B007C2M5ZM,"Amazing documentary.  The first half is a history of Philmont and how it came to be what it is today and the second half follows a crew on their trek.  I think it is impossible to really understand Philmont unless you go, but this is the next best thing.  It's a great way to get Scouts excited about going or convincing a spouse that it's ""worth"" going to Philmont.",1348012800,5,366,4.27536231884058
5074794,5,B007C2M5ZM,"This DVD is for anyone who has been to Philmont or is planning their first trip. It is jam packed with amazing photography and cinematography with a background score that really puts you in the mood.  Obviously, the filmmaker cares about Philmont -- it is evident in the care and attention to detail for all of the segments. But the lengths he goes to get an amazing story from a crew of first timers gives you a feeling of actually being part of the trek. I can't recommend this enough.",1331856000,5,487,4.411111111111111
5074795,5,B007C2M5ZM,"I have been on two full treks, a PSA trek, an autumn Adventure, worked at Philmont for four summers, and am a member of the Philmont Staff Association. To say I love Philmont would be a bit of an understatement.

When I start trying to explain Philmont I always get lost in which angle to take. Do I explain the history, or the people, or the environment, or activities... There are so many aspects that make up each and every person's version of Philmont is just that- their own.

Which is why I now tell people to watch the movie now. Hauling out a photo album, a map, and various left over camp food is not good enough. Larry has done what I have tried to do via those various methods, and short of taking someone there to show and have them experience. If you know someone who has ever gone or thinks about going- this is the movie to share with them.

I also have to confess I have been lucky to have known ""Dirty"" Larry since my Staff days at Philmont. I was able to see him perform, and know the members of the Tabasco Donkeys. So I am biased- there I said it. However, he loves that land and people as much as anyone who has ever seen a sunrise there. So much so, he named his film company after the backcountry camp he loves the most.",1330300800,7,1243,4.170833333333333
5074796,5,B007C2M5ZM,"Larry McLaughlin has produced a masterful documentary about the world's largest youth, Philmont Scout Ranch in the Sangre De Cristo mountains of northeastern New Mexico.  The documentary has some spectacular footage showing the beauty of the area.  The documentary begins by talking about how difficult it is to convey to those who have never been to Philmont, what it is like to be there. He then helps to answer the question by providing an interesting and relatively complete history of the creation of the Scout Ranch through the generosity of Waite Philips.  The history is further developed by providing vignettes about some key events in the development of what is termed a ""Scouting Paradise"".
  The second portion of the documentary follows a Venturing Crew which has little experience in the outdoors.  The coed Crew has somewhat typical experiences with challenges that they individually and as a group overcome.  To a person, everyone in the Crew has a great time and wants to return one day.
  There are several bonus features that add to the value of this DVD.  The DVD is very well done, interesting, and a must have for all who have gone or are planning to go to Philmont.  For those who know little about what Scouting is really about, I highly recommend this film.  It will provide insight into the value of Scouting for America's youth.",1330214400,5,1355,4.868995633187773
5074797,5,B007C2M5ZM,"The trailer says that the hardest thing about a Philmont trek is trying to explain it to someone who hasn't been on a Philmont trek. This documentary is the best explanation I've ever heard, plus it is full of interviews and pictures and facts to explain how this wonderful place came to be.",1330214400,6,291,4.509433962264151
8514155,4,B007C2M5ZM,"I was on expedition to Philmont in 1959 and 1962 and on staff in 1966 (year after the flood) and 1969, so I love the place, and enjoyed visiting it virtually.  The second half of the video followed a group on expedition in 2009, and I enjoyed seeing how certain things about Philmont stay the same and how others have changed.  My only objection is that I would have enjoyed seeing more of the ranch (e.g., Abreu, Fish Camp, Carson-Maxwell).",1412380800,,441,4.5
8514156,5,B007C2M5ZM,Excellent movie that helps scouts understand what is ahead of them at Philmont.  The Philmont history is information that I have not seen anywhere else.  It is also good for family to watch to understand the experience that you are having.,1405900800,,239,4.804878048780488

8514160,5,B007C2M5ZM,I went to Philmont in 1982.  This is an excellent movie covering the history and origins that I didn't pay attention to as a kid.  The videography and views are magnificent!  I shared with our SM as we're planning to go in 2016.,1402444800,,228,4.255813953488372

8514163,5,B007C2M5ZM,Instantly time warped me back to my first trek. The history and tradition of the ranch just made the video all the more special. Will not disapoint.,1390435200,,148,4.518518518518518
8514164,5,B007C2M5ZM,"I worked for 7 summers at Philmont as a P.C and Camp Director in the Back Country, the director Larry McLaughlin i.e ""Dirty Larry""  did a great video and it does a great job in capturing the essence and feeling of Philmont. I can speak from first hand knowledge that he put his heart and soul into this video. Only a person who has sat around campfires singing songs at Black Mountain can truly understand what the Philmont experience does to a person psyche.  I can not recommend it enough, it has been the closest thing to actually going there in person.  If you thinking about going to Philmont as a Camper or as a Staff member, watch this video!

IWTGBTP!
