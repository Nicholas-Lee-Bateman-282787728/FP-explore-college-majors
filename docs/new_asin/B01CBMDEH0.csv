8752623,2,B01CBMDEH0,"This is a Jamaican film with English subtitles, mostly spelled correctly. The film centers on sex, infidelity, make-up sex and revenge sex. Sylvester (Flippa Mafia) is a player while Denzel (Nohard Grant) gets played. I believe they are cousins or half something or other. The film cites gallons of statistics about unprotected sex and HIV and STDs in the black community. It is s film directed at teens who have incorrect information.

There is a lot of sex in the film and very little nudity. They slip the F-word in, but it was not used often. The main problem was that the film goes nowhere. It is a drama about sex and not a good one. It may do well for its target audience, which is clearly not main stream. African-American teens might find the film informative, in a near entertaining conduit.",1458950400,,801,4.640845070422535
