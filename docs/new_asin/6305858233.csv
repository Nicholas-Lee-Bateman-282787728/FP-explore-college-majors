1087464,5,6305858233,Mickey Rourke's superb acting makes this an Outlaw Movie That Rocks!  It is easy to get cuaght up in the story line with Mickey's acting and the director Michael K's attention to detail.  Robert Lame Bull McDonald was a long haired Indian cowboy who was hired on as an extra. They should put that dude in more movies!  Call him for your next movie Mickey.  It could be Harley Davidson and the Indian Man. :),1234396800,3,407,4.386666666666667
1087465,4,6305858233,"This is one of Rourkes lesser known movies that went straight to video, but don't let that fool you, as this is another great leading performance by Rourke. Micky does his job as an actor breathing life into his charater, and bringing the movie alive in a way that lesser actors would fail. The actress who plays his love interest does a fine job as well. Where the movie falls short is in the paint-by-numbers Hollywood type story line, and a terrible performance by an actor who plays the crazy redneck brother of Rourkes love interest, who plays the stupid, inbred, trailer park, white trash, bad guy the same way we've seen this type of character played a thousand different times in other movies... only worse. Thankfully, he is only in a few scenes. All in all, this is a well-acted, solid good little film.",1110844800,9,813,4.613793103448276
1087466,4,6305858233,"I like this film alot. The combination of the legendary Mickey Rourke and the all time favourite Lori Singer was well cast, I thought. I really enjoy this film. Frank T.Wells and Scarlett, are intreresting characters, you want them to stick together and end up well.",1109030400,8,266,4.804347826086956
7897629,4,6305858233,"It was a good story, kept me interested. Would've liked a better ending though, but ....can't change that. Great acting again by Mickey Rourke. I love him as a cowboy. Lori Singer was interesting as a wild slightly feral  and abused girl. It was refreshing in its simplicity. I liked how the classic SL was turned on its head, also. I just wish Mickey Rourke would have plummer roles in Hollywood and Indie movies. He's a talented actor and I never tire of him.",1523664000,,461,4.488095238095238

7897633,4,6305858233,"First  time  I  saw  this  movie  I  was  over  at  a  friends  house.  He  didn't  like  Clem  very  much  neither  did  I. &  he  didn't  treat  his  sister  Scarlett (Lori Singer)  from  the  movie  (Foot Loose  with  Kevin Bacon)  right  either.  Tormented  her,  &  had  sex  with  her.  I  don't  know  how  she  can  forgive  him  after  his  death.  Mickey  Rourke  stars  as  Frank T Wells  in  the  movie  has  just  been  released  from  prison.  &  is  seeking  a  better  life.  Getting  in  on  rodeo  life,  It  wasn't  going  to  be  easy  on  him.  He  had  depression  here  &  there,  including  a  little  trouble  with  somebody  there  at  the  rodeo  after  he  got  through  with  his  event,  the  Guy  just  says  that  just  cost  you  a  hundred  bucks,  Rodeo  doesn't  need  your  kind. He  also  had  an  Indian  friend  Bucky Miller  (Rodney A Grant)  who  was  there  to  stick  up  for  him.  &  they'd  known  each  other  in  the  past. Clem  (Peter Berg)  &  his  sister  Scarlett  originally  lived  in  the  Junkyard.  Clem  wanted  to  get  rich,  &  starts  robbing  banks,  he  is  too  crazy  &  becomes  a  lunatic. His  planning  also  wasn't  any  good.  Didn't  use  good  judgment  or  nothing. Too  many  drastic  measures. &  a  murderer  who  kills  every  cop  that  comes  within  5  feet  of  him.  He'd  kill  anyone  even  when  they  were  scared  &  begging  for  him  not  to  kill  them.  He  could  have  just  handcuffed  them  to  the  steering  wheel  or  shot  all  4  tires.  But  he  didn't  have  to  kill  them.  He  just  wasn't  very  smart!  Not  only  that,  he  doesn't  think  about  nothing!!  The  only  thing  I  can  say  about  Peter Berg  is  this,  (I  think  he  would  have  been  a  good  choice  of  actor  for  one  of  the  terminator  movies  as  the  bad  guy!  I'm  very  surprised  they  didn't  ask  him  for  a  role  in  one  of  those  movies.)  Clem  was  tracked  to  a  motel  by  the  police  who  surprised  him.  &  didn't  give  the  3  of  them  a  chance  to  surrender.  Just  starts  firing  shooting  up  the  motel  like  theirs  a  war  going  on  or  something!  Clem  gets  shot  up  real  badly.  One  of  the  officers  tells  the  sheriff  he  needs  a  Hospital,  The  sheriff  does  take  the  law  into  his  own  hands  &  kills  Clem.  He  wasn't  supposed  to  though! I  think  he  was  wrong.  His  name  was  Whitlock,  He  just  flat  out  killed  him,  no  pity  for  Clem  whatsoever!  &  calls  him  an  animal! I  can  understand  how  the  sheriff  must  have  felt  at  the  time,  Perhaps  he  was  determined  to  catch  him  &  Clem  had  an  easy  trail  for  him  to  track  him  to  the  motel  with  of  everybody  he'd  killed!  In  real  life  though  you  can't  kill  someone  like  that,  Like  Whitlock  did!!  No  matter  how  frustrated  you  are!  Whitlock  would  lose  his  badge  in  real  life. &  Clem  in  real  life  would  probably  get  the  electric  chair!  If  you  did  what  Clem  did  in  real  life  They'd  get  you!  No  2  ways  about  it! Clem  in  my  opinion  pushed  the  Law  too  far  with  his  killing  spree!  He's  someone  who  thought  killing  was  fun,  thought  he  was  in  front  of  video  arcade  game  or  something,  Basically  never  more  than  Stupid!!!!!!!  Scarlett  returns  to  the  old  Junkyard  for  a  few  hours, It  didn't  feel  the  same  without  Clem,  She  picks  up  a  few  of  her  things  &  heads  out.  Vowing  not  to  come  back.  Scarlett  soon  meets  Frank T Wells,  They  become  engaged,  &  they  both  try  putting  the  past  behind  them  in  any  way  that  they  can. Though  Scarlett  is  unable  to  change  her  ways.  Thought  she  still  had  something  against  the  law.  Inside  though  I  believe  she  wanted  to  avenge  her  Brothers  death.  I  guess  the  law  was  no  friend  of  hers!  That  shows  throughout  the  movie,  when  she  is  on  the  run  right  before  her  death  using  roadrage  &  everything  against  the  law.  She  wanted  the  law  to  come  after  her,  trying  to  get  their  attention,  &  have  her  revenge  on  any  officer  for  what  happened  to  her  brother  Clem. The  ending  is  sad  when  Frank T Wells  dies.  At  least  he  stood  a  much  better  chance  of  going  to  Heaven  than  Clem.  People  like  Clem  do  not  go  to  Heaven  when  they  die!  If  I  understand  correctly  all  3  of  them  were  having  a  tough  time  making  a  living,  Clem  must  have  had  money  problems,  You  don't  just  Trash  your  life  like  that  &  get  yourself  killed!! Clem  underestimated  the  Police  or  Sherrif  or  whoever.  &  thought  none  of  them  could  touch  him! But  I  liked  him  anyways  both  him  &  Frank T Wells. Joe  who  was  teamed  up  with  Clem  was  Scarlett's  first  boyfriend.  I  think  they're  a  little  off  on  the  script  of  this  movie,  Frank T Wells  should  have  lived,  There  is  nothing  wrong  with  trying  to  make  your  life  right!  I  don't  think  he  could  handle  living  without  his  new  girlfriend  Scarlett.  Putting  the  past  behind  you  or  whatever  isn't  always  easy.  Not  if  we're  torn  up  about  something.  I  believe  Scarlett  was  torn  up  over  her  brothers  death.  She  loved  Frank  but  couldn't  get  away  from  doing  stupid  &  crazy  things.  That's  just  how  it  is  sometimes. No  explanation  to  it! Their  love  for  each  other  wasn't  enough  to  help  Scarlett  overcome  how  she  felt  over  the  loss  of  her  brother.  &  all  that  which  she  had  mentioned  (If  Frank  wasn't  making  enough  money  in  the  rodeo)  then  Scarlett  would  rob  a  bank  for  those  reasons?  Lies!  She  Lied  to  him. She  wasn't  very  honest  with  him.  &  why  didn't  she  tell  Frank  how  she  really  felt?  She  was  just  torn  up  over  Clem's  death  &  had  a  score  to  settle  with  the  Law!  Maybe  Whitlock.  Anyhow  I  think  the  movies  good  enough  for  me.
Frank T Wells  has  some  time  alone  before  &  after  Scarlett  dies.  That  friend  of  his  the  Sheriff  guy  was  right  about  one  thing,  Frank  was  no  cop  killer,
He  kept  running  on  his  horse  &  I  think  in  his  mind  he  wasn't  wanting  to  go  back  to  prison.  &  he  wasn't  going  to!
When  he  refused  to  stop  Whitlock  the  same  Sheriff  who  killed  Clem  shot  at  &  killed  Frank T Wells  from  the  helicopter!  He  was  a  bad  sheriff!  Even  if  he  didn't  mean  to  kill  him,  I  wouldn't  have  believed  him,  maybe  the  other  sheriff,  the  one  who  kept  Frank  in  jail  for  the  Bar  fight.
There  are  good  scenes  &  bad  scenes,  some  though  you  may  find  very  disturbing!!!!!!!",1431043200,,6810,4.234545454545454
7897634,5,6305858233,"I really did enjoy this rarely available Mickey Rourke movie. He wrote it under a different name, as he usually does with his work. I found it to be very interesting and entertaining. It is available in Europe under a different name, so be careful to order the American version or it may not play on your DVD player. (W.T.F.) Had been looking for it for awhile but realized it was released here under The Last Ride. Easy ordering from Amazon .Com.
