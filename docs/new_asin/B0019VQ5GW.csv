8326241,1,B0019VQ5GW,"This is a terrible video.  Judging by some of the comments made by James White, it appears possible that John Sanders didn't even know that this was going debate format.  He (John Sanders) certainly was not prepared to answer rebuttals nor did he present any significant responses to James White's positions.  Dr. White on the other hand did know and was prepared for a debate.  There is very little here to learn from this ""debate"" except what a skilled debater can do to a person who isn't prepared to debate their position.  Save your money - it is wrong for Dr. White to even sell this as a debate.  I am really thinking about writing Dr. White and asking for my money back as this is basically false advertising to call it a debate.  There are many good books on this issue buy one of those instead.",1417478400,,804,4.428571428571429
