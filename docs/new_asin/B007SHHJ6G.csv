8521647,5,B007SHHJ6G,"I have not received this video course as yet just ordered it today.  Probably not fair to review it without seeing it however I do have Michaels CANNON 70D CRASH COURSE  and on the strength of that I am giving this course five stars to rebut the two star review that simply is not fair since the reviewer seems to be caught up in production values instead of information received.  I did not for a minute think that Michaels video courses would be Steven Spielburg (sic) like.  What I found in the 70D course was loads of information on how my camera works.  I am guessing I will be getting the same kind of info as respects my new speedlight.  That is what I am spending my money for... NOT Raiders of the Lost Ark.

Keep them coming Mike you have a fan here.",1428969600,,760,4.236111111111111
8521648,3,B007SHHJ6G,You will learn a lot but the quality of the product is lacking. If you can get past the price and the poor quality you will still get out of it what you need to know.,1398729600,,166,3.638888888888889
8521649,5,B007SHHJ6G,Well-organized and concise.  Excellent presentations with great graphics.  Manuals are fine but this is how I learn best - seeing a demonstration that I can review over and over as needed.,1395273600,2,188,5.032258064516129
8521650,5,B007SHHJ6G,"This was the second DVD from the author that I have ordered (the first was one on my camera itself). Let us face it: The user manual that comes with the equipment, while comprehensive, is not direct nor is it a pleasing cover-to-cover read. If you acquired your new equipment and wished you had someone who knows the gear to explain things to you in easy, albeit comprehensive, terms, this DVD is for you! It tells you what each button and option in the menus do, as well as how you can configure the equipment to work the way that best suits your needs.

Michael has very strong teaching skills (and trust me, I do know what I am talking about!). He makes relevant comparisons that helps one understand the concepts quickly. If you watch this video and pay attention to the lessons, you will have full control on your camera in a quite short while. The DVD has an awesome menu that allows you to quickly reach the lesson you need (to remind you how to set that custom function for instance). That alone makes the DVD worth it.

Michael also goes on to help a beginner to improve his/her skills and to get technically better shots. Do remember that this DVD is aimed at beginners, so that advanced techniques wouldn't fit here. The lessons are down-to-earth, informal but straight-to-the-point information on your equipment, with some suggestions on settings that may suit someone's needs.

Some of the sequences in the DVD were recorded for dual purpose: use in the DVD as well as to be posted as a sample in youtube. Such approach leads the DVD to have quite a bit of introductions - Hi, I am Michael Andrew, etc. - but it delivers precious information chapter after chapter. Do not let that turn you away from the awesome information contained in the DVD. More recent DVDs from Michael have fixed this minor issue. I do not hesitate to recommend his videos/DVDs to whoever wishes to have full control over the equipment without having to parse the user manuals. The time it'll save you makes it a worthy investment.

Knowing the DVD content, if I were to decide today whether or not I should buy this DVD, I would not hesitate to acquire them all over again.

Keep up the great work!",1362268800,2,2186,4.552162849872774
8521651,5,B007SHHJ6G,"This is an excellent course for someone new to flash photography and that has just just purchased  a speedlite 580/430EX II.
After  purchasing the 580 Ex II and reading the Canon manual, I decided that the Canon Manual was really lacking especially for a beginner.  I decided to try the Crash Course based on reviews found on the internet.  Spending the few hours viewing  the dvd really saved me a lot time. (I would have spent many more hours reading additional books, and looking up"" how to use the flash"", information on the web). The course is presented in an informal style and was very easy to follow.",1357084800,4,608,4.592592592592593
