8190965,2,6304122330,"The intro with Dr. Siegel is a very long & boring- 20 minute lecture. Then comes the affirmations and nature shots. I found the quality of the whole video was below standard and mismarketed.  If you want beautiful nature shots and inspiring quotes (more meditative), I would highly recommend ""Inspiring Moments: Waves Spiritual Retreats for soothing stress relief."" I found it much more soothing during my chemotherapy and recovery.",995241600,3,432,5.260869565217392
