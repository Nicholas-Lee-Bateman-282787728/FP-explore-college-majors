1905262,5,B0000AB16J,"These have to be two of the worst movies ever created. I loved both of them!

Transylvania 6-5000. Before you watch this movie, go on iTunes and download Glenn Miller's ""Pennsylvania 6-5000"" or else you won't groan every time the phone rings in the movie. It was wonderfully hilarious!

Elvira Mistress of the Dark. If you like dry humor, then this movie is for you. She sounds like a cross between my brother, dad and grandpa with their corny jokes. That alone makes it worthwile.

I highly recomend this dvd to anyone who loves corny jokes and bad ""horror"" flicks. :D",1217116800,,569,4.6138613861386135
1905263,4,B0000AB16J,"I  thought these movies were great!  But then, I like this type of humor.",1168300800,,73,4.142857142857143
1905264,5,B0000AB16J,"In the Halloween mood, but looking for some ghoulish laughs rather than gory scares? Look no further! This double-sided DVD is not only a great price, it provides two fantastic 80's cult-classics of silly, monster-themed comedy! Kick your evening off with ""Elvira, Mistress of the Dark""....

The lovely Cassandra Peterson dons her famous black dress and wig for the big screen in this hilarious 1988 cult-camp-comedy-classic, and the result is a good time for all! Well, maybe not ALL. Naturally, the humor can get a bit racy, though it's a far cry from today's downright shameless standards! In ""Elvira, Mistress of the Dark,"" Cassandra reprises her legendary TV horror hostess role as the character comes to a turning point in her career. Frustrated with an unsatisfying job and blatant sexual harassment from her new boss, the always intrepid Elvira drops everything to pursue her dream of doing her own show in Las Vegas. She THINKS her agent has arranged everything, but gets a rude awakening when she discovers that SHE must come up with fifty thousand dollars to secure the theater. With perfect timing, a message arrives with news of Elvira's mysterious great aunt's sudden passing and requesting her presence at the reading of the will. Elvira's hope is restored, and she packs her bags and hits the road to Massachusetts!

Unfortunately, once Elvira arrives in the small Rockwellian town to which she has been summoned, she discovers that she has only inherited a house, a book, and a dog, none of which she has any use for. Things are only made worse by the fact that the local townsfolk do not want her around; that is, all except for the teenagers who admire her and the men who desire her. In-between fending off unwanted advances and worrying about how she can make worthless lemons into profitable lemonade, Elvira somehow finds the time to take the local kids under her wing and pursue the naive town beefcake as well. In fact, she develops one ingenious solution to bring all of her pet projects together: Putting on a late-night movie show for the kids at her beau's downtown movie theater! The forces seem to be against our heroine, however, in the form of the unfriendly locals. But, the danger of them ruining her show is the least of her worries! Little does Elvira know that her newly discovered Uncle Vincent is a villainous warlock with designs on acquiring her new spell-book, which Elvira thinks is nothing more than a book of exotic cooking recipes! If she's going to save the world, her dreams of stardom, and herself, Elvira will have to discover her true birthright as ""Mistress of the Dark!""

""Elvira, Mistress of the Dark"" is great campy fun in the true spirit of Cassandra Peterson's beloved television icon! The beautiful prima donna with gothic good-looks and a sharp, wicked, yet well-intentioned and sometimes surprisingly bubbly personality transfers successfully to the big screen thanks to the overflowing talent and charm of the stunning Miss Peterson, who effortlessly carries the film from beginning to end. No question about it, this film is ALL about Elvira, and that's a good thing! Familiar faces dot the cast, and the acting skills vary, but in a goofy, goodtime comedy like this, it all works well together! So, if you are a fond fan like me, or if you are just plain curious, you gotta give this a watch! Extras include two riotous trailers and a thorough, readable bio on Cassandra Peterson. Great for viewing around Halloween or pretty much anytime!

And, after Elvira, take a side-splitting trip to Transylvania! For a good time, call...

""Transylvania 6-5000!"" Jeff Goldblum plays straight-man tabloid reporter to child-like partner Ed Begley Jr. in this hilarious monster-movie spoof, as they are sent on a mission to Transylvania to uncover the truth about a suspicious videotape that allegedly features the real Frankenstein monster! As enthusiastic Gil (Begley Jr.) pursues the story, skeptical Jack (Goldblum) pursues a lovely American tourist with a small daughter. Everything seems to be calm and quaint in the charming and very hospitable Transylvanian village, but, once the two reporters begin to work together, they discover there is more to the sleepy little town than meets the eye! There are physical gags and witty banter aplenty in this fantastically 80's style take on ""Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein,"" complete with Jeffrey Jones as the Mayor, John Byner and Carol Kane as dimwitted servants, and Joseph Bologna as the mad doctor. All contribute laughs by the cartful, but it's Geena Davis and Seinfeld's Michael Richards who really steal the show as a nymphomaniac vampiress named Odette and  Fejos, the token brute. Those of you who cherish the comedy teams of yester-year will get a kick out of the chemistry between Goldblum and Begley Jr., and they'll make you wish that films like this (and ""Brain Donors"") were more successful. The commentary by the director/writer and visual consultant is quite informative and enjoyable, the trailers and TV spots are a kick, and this widescreen DVD even includes galleries of storyboards and stills. Not at all bad for one feature on a highly affordable double feature DVD! One would have expected something bare bones for such a film, but Anchor Bay really delivered. If you dig Abbott and Costello style laughs with a Transylvanian touch, this flick is for you!

So, there you have it! 4 stars for each film, 5 for putting them both on one affordable disc! Either you've seen these films before or you're curious about them for some oddball reason, or you wouldn't be reading this review. So do yourself a favor and pick this disc up! You've got two excellent chances to be glad you did!",1126656000,23,5714,4.945833333333334
1905265,4,B0000AB16J,"I will admit that I bought this dvd just for the Elvira film. It is a great cult flick that I have liked ever since I saw it in it's original release back in 1988. There were quite a few cheap version of this dvd floating around and although Anchor Bay did release it by itself a few years ago, I did not buy it because it was about $14.99 and only had the trailer and a teaser as extras. I saw this version for under ten dollars so decided to buy it even though I had never seen Transylvania 6-5000 before. Elvira is very funny, but the same cannot be said about the second film. Transylvania 6-5000 tries to be a spoof of old horror films, but this was done much better by Young Frankenstein over ten years earlier. There are some funny moments, but largely it is full of cliches and some really stupid humor. It does boast a talented cast that includes Jeff Goldblum, Geena Davis, Michael Richards, Jeffrey Jones and John Byner but the script leaves them with little to do. Still this dvd is worth it for Elvira alone.",1063756800,11,1021,4.268041237113402
7996828,5,B0000AB16J,Happy to find this DVD. These 2 movies are so campy! Very fast service and good quality DVD. Will definitely order from them again!,1496793600,,131,4.5
7996829,2,B0000AB16J,"What makes good comedy? Timing, Exposition, Variety, Pacing, and Consistency. I don't speak this ill of course towards Elvira Mistress of The Dark because her deadpan delivery, sarcasm, and timing really make her main movie on this dual set worth the watch. The same however cannot be said for Transylvania 6-5000. The latter of the two films starring Carole Kane, Ed Begley Jr., Jeff Goldblum, Jeffery Combs, and a rather sensuous hot mama vampire with Gena Davis whose outfit and brief appearance throughout the movie are the only real high points next to the eccentric seer who loves to weave fortunes and stories to our leads while head busting her crystal ball tables shortly afterwards. Initially I started thinking that this was Elvira even promoting her own DVD movie release of the old first classic film and Transylvania 6-5000 but thankfully my friend Sebastian and I were proved wrong. Many of the jokes fall flat on their timing and delivery, a few actors who are good are misused or underutilized to be tossed around (Carol Kane mostly). Plus the pacing is so quick most of the time it's barely allowing the film to breathe.  Things certainly don't make sense at first and the viewer has to suffer through over an hour of painful scenes of normality before the film remembers it's parodying the mythos horror of Transylvania (modern day Romania). Nothing is consistent,  hardly anything is funny, the film goes too quick, Vampire Gena Davis doesn't get enough screen time, and you will scratch your head and want to just watch ""Elvira, Mistress of The Dark"". My humble advice just get a single Elvira Mistress of The Dark DVD. A much better use of your money.",1493683200,,1673,4.846153846153846

These movies are perfectly matched; both are campy, ridiculous send-ups of classic horror cliches and B-movie schlock. Great fun, and highly recommended to get in the Halloween spirit any time of year.

The DVD itself is good quality. It offers few special features, but with movies like these, are you really looking for extras?",1252886400,2,383,4.96875
