1288572,2,B00003CXQA,"A literal hit and miss, ""Unbreakable"" is M. Night Shyamalan's cinematic blunder, a jigsaw puzzle with integral pieces missing from its obscure image.  As can be expected, it suffers greatly at the hands of comparison to Shyamalan's Oscar-nominated masterpiece ""The Sixth Sense"".  ""Unbreakable"" is filmed with the same swart and creepy ambience as its predecessor but hopelessly flounders from an indistinct plot and underdeveloped characters.  Where as SS genuinely bolstered interest in the supernatural and managed to include a finale with some reasonable closure, this film is severely lacking of both.  It struggles to clarify its chaotic concept and miserably fails.
From the get-go, ""Unbreakable"" is a jumbled mess.  It remains so in the fact that it bears no plausible connections to the numerous theories it proposes in its laboriously paced two-hour time frame.  It strays far from its preliminary premise and sloppily interjects a scatterbrained theory from a comic book fanatic named Elijah Price, a man who has spent nearly his entire existence in the distilled milieu of hospitals.  Elijah suffers from a rare genetic disorder, one that severely depletes his bone density - his limbs will literally shatter like glass from a misstep of any kind.  In the search for his counterpart, the long-awaited news comes to him in the form of a tragic accident.  Two railway trains collide and all save one perishes - the sole survivor is David Dunn (Willis), an assumed everyday man who is currently enduring a crumbling marriage with his wife of twelve years (Penn).  He emerges from the horrific catastrophe unscathed, leaving his doctor and his family to ponder the miraculous outcome.  Elijah is intrigued and contacts David, bringing to light his inconceivable immunity to bodily harm and insisting that there is an underlying reason for his divine existence.
After this assumedly concrete plot is introduced, we are led to believe by not only the trailer but also the first half-hour itself that David's incredible circumstance is an existing phenomenon that begs to be defined.  Instead, we are left in the impenetrable shadows of the movie's ethereal cinematography as the characters themselves scramble to make sense of what is going on.  Because of Shyamalan's conflicting talents as a writer and a director, the plot bends left and right with indecisiveness.  In this inconsistency, Shyamalan throws his audience to and fro and we are left with yet another surprise ending that, unlike SS, lends no ample plausibility or clarification to the rest of the film.
Bruce Willis applies his near-a-whisper acting technique acquired from SS to the role of David Dunn, the man who is the moniker of this very movie.  There is never any dramatic tension from this limp character until a specific point in the movie when a gun is pointed at him from the most unlikely of people.  Robin Wright-Penn is wasted in this film as Dunn's eternally exhausted wife Audrey.  Penn always appears as if she has just taken a heavy dose of Secenol, her sluggish approach to her character almost unbearable to witness.  Samuel L. Jackson seems to be the only fire to these watery performances, but even his vehement candor is kept at a bare minimum by Shyamalan's lethargic style.  When examining the performances this film begets, I warn you: be prepared for pure somnolence.
There is not much more to comment on this film except that it is a far cry from what we know Shyamalan is truly capable of, and avid fans of SS will be extremely disappointed by the lack of artistry and attention to detail.  ""Unbreakable"" is doomed from its very induction and will be broken down to the every flaw by many critics to come.",986947200,3,3705,5.01305057096248
1288573,4,B00003CXQA,"This film was about 30 seconds from being brilliant, until the end when the last frame froze and a caption appeared that almost completely cheapened the spirit and meaning of the film. I didn't think something that was seemingly minor would have such a effect on the film.  They would be wise to remove it in the DVD version.  Otherwise ""Unbreakable"" is dark, brooding, and amazing.  It is a great first film in a trilogy, if there is to be one.  Lets hope.",986515200,,457,4.469879518072289
1288574,3,B00003CXQA,"""Unbreakable"" is a film that starts out wonderfully, then gets more and more lost as it goes.  The basic premise - to make superheroes genuinely possible - is another bold move from Shyamalan, but that can only take a flawed film so far.
M. Night Shyamalan, or Night, as most film journalists call him, is a master of creating atmosphere, and this is quite a grim film.  It almost makes his previous ""Sixth Sense"" seem bright and cheery.  However, when you consider the over the top action and flamboyancy of the recent ""Batman"" movies, as well as many other comic book films of the past, this is a generally wise move.  It makes it all seem just a little more plausible.
The characters are well-written and real:  no one is the bold and noble hero, no one is the evil-to-the-core villain.  Even Dunn's (Willis') family is going through some hard times, with him carrying his share of the blame.  Willis' plays his character as a man lost in thought a good majority of the time, and considering everything this man has to endure before he even discovers his potential, this is entirely real.
Samuel L. Jackson, who is well known for his own tough-guy image, has to imagine himself in the shoes of a man who has never been tough, never been strong, no matter how much he wanted to be.  Jackson pulls it off wonderfully, emphasizing humor and some charm, traits that are winning when you're physical presence may not be.
So far, so good.  However, as the film progresses into it's final half-hour, it makes some serious judgement errors, and some of the results are laughable.  It's horrible to see a good movie go to waste because the people behind it seemed to have forgotten what they wanted to have happen.  Dunn's first ""outing"" as a superhero is a bit anti-climactic, and then everything that follows is just plain silly.
I didn't find this to be a three-star movie, but it's closer to that than it is to two.  As it stands, I plan on seeing the first of the two sequels.  However, if this new twist on the superhero genre goes wrong a second time, you can bet that I'm out of the third.",986256000,,2091,4.514588859416445
1288575,5,B00003CXQA,"Unbreakable is amazing.  For all of you compairing it to the Sixth Sense that's okay I guess, but he's not going to write and direct the exact same movie so all of you bashing it for not being the Sixth Sense let it go.  Unbreakable is more creative and original than the Sixth Sense, and it deserves to be recognized as that.  The rest of this review is for Alex Udvary (he reviewed Unbreakable and gave it 1/5 stars) Unbreakable is a drama, it may be boring to some, but to others a movie about a real life super hero is a great idea.  I'm a 19 year old male who read comics growing up and while I am still developing as a man I still read comics and when I found out Bruce Willis was a superhero and Samuel L. Jackson was a super villian that was amazing.  It wasn't a cheap trick ending like the Sixth Sense it developed through the movie and it was awesome.  The way you're talking about seeing this movie you are the next Jesus Christ.  You must view movies with more pure eyes then the rest of us.  ""There's nothing wrong with that. I was able to see this movie for what it is, something many,many people aren't doing"" that's a quote by Alex U.  Do you think you are better than me?",986256000,3,1189,4.1347826086956525
1288576,5,B00003CXQA,"Unbreakable is ranked number 1 on my top 100 chart at this time. I believe that it much better than the Sixth Sense. I think that the people who believe that it is just like the Sixth Sense do not know there movies. It takes the same pattern of events but that is all. I am glad to see Bruce Willis doing non stupid action films. The main reason why I enjoyed this movie because it is unique. It takes on different emotional and physical properties all through the film. I think that M. Night Shyamalan should be considered as one of the great directors. This film is intresting because it has a sense of mystery and belief into the film. And how the film takes a child topic of comic books and creates it toward a more serious movie is awsome. There are hardely any flaws in the movie. It was the right length. And I didn't even think about looking at my watch during the movie. If I look at my watch it means the movie is dragging or too long. The only flaw is the role of the little boy with bruce. His acting was less than good. He never presented true empotions through the whole movie. I know why he's there is because the movie targets comic books and kids like comic books or comic books tend to target children. But he need more scenes or to pick up his acting. My favorite role in Unbreakable is Mr. Glass nemisis to Bruce Willis. The role is played by Samuel Jackson. I believe that this is his best role ever. Mr. Glass is the most interesting character I have ever whitnessed. The acting of this character was perfect. I believe that this movie was the best movie of the year 2000. It was powerful and gripping all the way through. It should at least have a nomination for best picture of the year. The best part of Unbreakable is the ending. If you thought that Sixth Sense was good then wait until you see this. I never saw it coming. I usually can spot out what will happen in a movie if it predictable, but this film is not. It's a must see. Bruce Willis's best movie.",984441600,,1985,4.226315789473684
1288577,4,B00003CXQA,"Going into Unbreakable I wasn't sure how a good movie could be made about a real life ""superhero"".  But Shyamalan guides the film around the B-movie pit falls to produce quite an enjoyable film.  He accomplishes this by completely avoiding a comic book feel.  In every comic you or I have read since age 5, the super hero discovers their powers, instantly accepts them, and gets on about the business of saving the world.  In Unbreakable however, the majority of the movie is Bruce Willis struggling to come to grips with the powers Samuel L. Jackson claims he has.  Shyamalan allows us to see the world through Willis eyes as he slowly realizes that Jackson is right and tries to deal with what it means to be a ""superhero"".
The movie is shot in the same fashion as the sixth sense: with great use of shadow and unconventional camera angles.  This style does wonders for the suspense of the film.  The world comes across as a dark and mysterious place, made more so by the seemingly impossible things that Willis experiences.
As the Amazon review points out, this film is better when taken as the beginning of a trilogy.  By the time Willis comes to terms with what he can do, the movie is almost over and I was left wanting to know more.  But even on its own, this movie is well worth watching.",984009600,12,1296,4.480851063829787
1288578,4,B00003CXQA,"The pacing of Unbreakable is similar to The Sixth Sense, so if you are a fan of the latter you have a shot at the former.  Bruce Willis once again does a great job playing a somber ""regular guy"" in what he believes to be an unrealistic reality. The journey begins with Willis surviving a train wreck that kills everyone -- except him.  Your curiosity begins to be tweaked when Jackson shows up with a ""revelation"" to Willis about how this was possible.  Any more detail and it's spoiled.  Just sit back and enjoy the mood of the movie.",983923200,,535,4.373737373737374
1288579,4,B00003CXQA,"I found Unbreakable interesting and intriguing.  I thoroughly enjoyed the entire film, the slow, methodical way the plot is revealed (the film studios would do well to follow this example).  It was great to see something where everything isn't revealed immediately, where some things go unexplained (as in The Sixth Sense).  My only real gripe was the explanatory text at the end, we really didn't need that.",983923200,,408,5.059701492537314

I'd rather deal with REALITY, whether in movies AND real life. what would have led me to judge this movie, a 5 star, would have been for the presence of Samuel L. Jackson, whom I consider a diverse and very fine actor! to me, Jackson is as well; handsome, dedicated to his craft, and... if I can admit it, irresistibly Sexy!!!! but above all,, do I admire him for having rescued himself from the use of hard drugs. so, may I say, that I highly respect him for that achievement.",1518912000,,539,4.346534653465347

1288874,4,B00003CXQA,"This conflation of comic book characters with current reality was not well-spun...more like frayed at the edges. Still, thanks to the suspension of disbelief I found myself caught up in the story line.  Here is where the story succeeded: most of us have a latent desire for superpowers, and Bruce Willis as the reluctant recipient was a perfect vehicle for our vicarious experience. ""Superhuman"", not so much, but as a meta-human he had more than a hint of credibility. Unfortunately, Samuel L. Jackson understood the script but did not understand his character. What does that mean? A great actor would have thrown some of the lines back at the writers to fix them; the greatest would have done their own re-write. Glass-man, in his final scene, was indeed a comic book character in a moment that could have been epic. How about: ""You look at me in horror, but you lack depth. Each fracture, each cracking of bone and sinew coursed through my mind like a hot knife. Don't imagine I could have chosen a different path....my quest was fired in a crucible you can't imagine. Despise me if you must....but don't cast me aside, lest you return to the dark hole I found you in.""",1517356800,,1173,4.694174757281553

1288882,1,B00003CXQA,"Watching paint dry would have been more entertaining than this pathetic attempt at a supernatural thriller. I loved The Sixth Sense, but this was the most awful movie I've seen in a long time. The writing was criminally bad--no character development, no convincing inciting incident, and much as I like all of the actors, I cared not a whit what happened to any of their characters. It was a story without a heart, without a purpose, without a believable driving mission. And forget the end! Talk about tacking something on that had nothing to justify it. This movie is good for one thing: a sterling example of atrocious screenwriting. Also, the hysterical score was utterly unsuited to this film, and only highlighted how hard it tried and failed.

Like, there should have been more action, more blood, more fighting. At least more fighting to where he at least gets better at it, to where he does something amazing maybe an amazing fighting style all his own something!
Maybe, Bruce Willis should have solved more crimes before revealing his hidden identity to his son. Maybe, Samuel Jackson could guided him with his new found powers and helped him solve more crimes and groomed him to be the ""Hero"" he was looking for, for a large part of his life.

Through a series of developments in the story, their purposes are revealed. This is a character driven story and some may find the lack of action a turn off. However, this is not the point of the film. It is meant to be a first issue origin story, where the hero has not yet mastered his power. I really enjoyed this film and the conclusion. I wish they would have made a sequel so we could see further into the world and what becomes of the characters.

1289241,2,B00003CXQA,"I bought this DVD for 5 bucks, and I still overpaid.  I wanted to like this movie!  It's a great premise.  It has Sam Jackson in it!  How bad can it be?  Well, the antidote to any potentially great movie is Bruce Willis.  He's no Kevin Costner now, I'll grant you that.  But he's very near the bottom in terms of acting ability.  In this flick, we're not really sure if he's mentally challenged or an adult or what. It's hard to tell since Willis seems that way in real life.  Not the sharpest tool, if you will.  His lack of acting chops ruins an otherwise great movie.  Hopefully, someone will do it again with a real lead actor who knows how to ... act.",1499990400,,656,4.168

1289462,5,B00003CXQA,"An unique re-imagining of our normal expectations from superhero films, a film made a mere handful of years before the current crop of such films appeared; its protagonist is blissfully unaware that he is the stuff of superhero comic fantasies (as was I, before my brother convinced me to see it), until his unexplained survival of a massive tragedy that spares nobody else (as well as an inexplicable talent to see what evil lurks in the hearts of men, a la The Shadow) brings him to the attention of an eccentric comic art curator who forces him to reflect upon unexplained, nagging questions from his past, thus causing the scales to peel back from his eyes. A nondescript father and husband caught up in a midlife crisis and failing marriage, his lack of a costume or superhero code name to accompany his powers means he has more in common with the cast of NBC's Heroes than with the Avengers, the X-Men, or the Justice League.

In addition to a haunting soundtrack (and a horrific ending) that sticks with you long after the end, its unexplored fodder for future tales is  overdue to be re-examined (and shall be) in the future, by director M. Night Shyamalan.

(By the way, Shyamalan's most recent film, Split, is also worth seeing--I won't say why, that those who haven't seen it may avoid spoilers.)",1495756800,2,1307,4.698689956331878

1289714,2,B00003CXQA,"The movie was not at all what I expected. I expected this movie to be good but it seemed like the producer just put the movie together like a quilt. One minute it was talking about birth, then there was a train, then there was an accident then he was on the job and then he was a superhero. To be fair, I have to say I like Samuel and Bruce Willis. I think they both are exceptional actors but the producer gave them a movie with no plot and basically just told them to act and bring the movie to life. Bruce plays actions movies the best. He has that poker face that really goes well with action or suspenseful movies. Samuel plays the movies the best that allows him to play the character no one likes to play which is the bad guy or the so called crazy person. Samuel has so much talent that he can really play the character and bring you into the movie. I love both of these actors but this movie was not my favorite. I gave the movie 2 stars because good actors were in it but I really wanted to give it one star. Maybe this movie was really good when it first came out but I do not know why they wasted production on this movie. I liked the idea about the train and him being the only survivor. It really intrigued my interest and the right producer could have really made this movie a collector's item for years to come but unfortunately, the idea and plot was not there.",1489449600,,1378,4.107407407407408

1289794,3,B00003CXQA,"Writer & director M. Night Shyamalan's fourth film ""Unbreakable"" refers to its protagonist, football stadium security guard David Dunn (Bruce Willis) who has been born with an almost perfect body because his bones cannot be broken. Far less introspective and surprising than the mysterious ""The Sixth Sense,"" this atmospheric melodrama depicts the friendship between Dunn and an African-American man, Elijah Price known as Mr. Glass (Samuel L. Jackson), who suffers from an unusual disease designated 'Osteogenesis Imperfecta.' Basically, 'Osteogenesis Imperfecta' constitutes a genetic disorder where bones break easily. In other words, Glass' surname reflects the extremely fragile nature of his body. The first scene in ""Unbreakable"" concerns the birth of Mr. Glass in an apparel fitting room, and one of the men who takes charge of the infant discovers to his horror that the little boy's legs are misshapen from where he kicked himself out of his mother's womb. Later, we learn that Mr. Glass has become obsessed with comic book superheroes because his mother used comics to coax him out of the seclusion of their apartment. Glass becomes a leading authority on comic books and the characteristics of superheroes and super villains. He represents a strong villain because he reckons that if he occupies one end of the spectrum that an 'unbreakable' occupies the other end. In his fiendish efforts to find the other end of the spectrum, Mr. Glass commits incorrigible crimes that eventually land him in a mental asylum. For example, he engineers a train wreck that kills everybody on board except for David Dunn. Mr. Glass catches up with David after he appears in the news as the soul survivor of the deathly train wreck and he takes a bizarre interest in him that Dunn doesn't reciprocate. Glass' inquiries arouses the curiosity of David's son Joseph (Spencer Treat Clark of ""Gladiator"") who loads up more free weights than David thinks that he can press and winds up impressing both of them. Later, when Joseph is convinced that his father cannot be hurt by flying lead, a standoff occurs in the kitchen with Joseph threatening his father at gunpoint. Of course, neither David nor his terrified wife Audrey (Robin Wright of ""Forrest Gump"") think that he is invincible where bullets are concerned, and they manage to persuade Joseph to put the pistol down.

""Unbreakable"" is essentially a duel of giants. Mr. Glass has spent his entire life searching for David. There is one scene that displays David's unbreakable constitution. A maniac forces his way into a residential house, kills the husband, ties up the two children, and assaults the wife who he leaves tied up with bleeding wrists. As it turns out, David has the power of insight that enables him to tell who represents a threat to the public. Glass is on hand at the football stadium when David exercises this ability. Standing watch over the line of spectators filing into the stadium, David points out a suspicious looking fellow in cameo that he thinks his packing a pistol out-of-sight under his jacket. At the last minute, the suspicious fellow steps out of line. A desperate Mr. Glass pursues this individual and falls down a stairway in his efforts to learn if the guy was in fact toting a firearm that matches David's description. As it turns out, this suspicious guy is. The ending is kind of a let-down because Glass and David never tangle, but ""Unbreakable"" is an engrossing movie up to this anti-climax. Bruce Willis delivers a beautifully restrained performance and the scene on the train before it crashes kind of clashes with his heroic image.",1487894400,3,3623,5.01827242524917

In a setting anyone could relate to, an average home, an average job and average life, extraordinary events lie in wait.

1290518,5,B00003CXQA,"In today's malaise of manufactured, nonplussed, sophomoric, and intellectually insulting superhero movies, Shyamalan's dark and quirky spin of the genre is refreshing and engaging. Shyamalan's depiction of the superhero isn't the spandex-donning one-liner spouting more-luck-than-super-power moron but instead he sneaks the ""super powers"" into a character the audience can relate to: a man with an okay job, who has marital problems and a son to raise, and who barely even noticed that he was something special. The film is paced well as our protagonist's awareness of his skill-set burgeons and expands as he attempts to ""stress test"" what his ultimate abilities truly are. It's set to a dark color palette, and tells its story not just in the lines delivered, but even the choice in unusual cinematography. The film garners five stars from me, despite Samuel Jackson's sometimes contrived and wooden deliveries (in my opinion, no matter what film, he's a bit over-hyped and average at best). Regardless, this film is for me the only ""superhero"" film, and its timeless appeal after nearly 16 years marches on. Naturally, expect trademark Shyamalan ""trick ending"" to rear itself, which to me was just as surprising as his bellwether ""Sixth Sense."" So put yourself in a cerebral mindset and enjoy, because this is Shyamalan at his best.",1472774400,,1335,5.242990654205608

1290635,5,B00003CXQA,"This is a really interesting idea - the story line. It may be science fiction, but it makes you think. It kind of brings home the idea of good versus evil, in that for every action there is an opposite action, or reaction. It's kind of dark, like DC Comics are. Of course it would be, being an M. Night Shyamalan movie. It's really well done, and you don't really think of Bruce Willis' character as being super human until well into the movie. That says a lot for Bruce Willis, who is great in this movie. He makes his character seem totally believable. Samuel L. Jackson is the same. He always gives a great performance, and is also believable in this movie. They are opposite sides of the same coin. Bruce Willis has never been sick or hurt in his life. Samuel L. Jackson hasn't had a single day without pain since the day he was born. Besides being a really good science fiction movie, it's also a great thriller in true M. Night Shymalan fashion. It keeps you intent and totally into the movie all the way through. There are also some really good supporting actors.

1291001,4,B00003CXQA,"Released in 2000, Unbreakable was M. Night Shyamalans follow-up to his most successful movie, 1999s The Sixth Sense. The plot revolves around a man (Bruce Willis) who becomes increasingly aware that he possesses superhuman abilities, including invulnerability. This attracts a man on the opposite end of the spectrum who can barely go a week without injuring himself (Samuel L. Jackson). The latter is seriously into superhero-type comics and begins to see the truth about the former. Robin Wright Penn and Spencer Treat Clark play the wife & son of the protagonist while Leslie Stefanson has a glorified cameo.

The movie scores high points for originality as the idea that superheroes are based on real-life people adorned with extraordinary powers is intriguing. The tone of the movie is akin to the slow drama with spiritual undertones of Shyamalans other films, like 2002s Signs. Unfortunately, the ending feels arbitrarily tacked-on and leaves a sour taste. Then again, it might enhance repeat viewings.

The film runs 106 minutes and was shot in Philadelphia.

1291008,4,B00003CXQA,"When is a superhero movie not a superhero movie?  When it's ""Unbreakable.""

Writer-producer-director M. Night Shyamalan rose to meteoric stardom on the strength of a single film, ""The Sixth Sense"" in 1999.  Since then, the quality of his output, although not the extent of his popularity, has declined with each new movie.  ""The Sixth Sense"" kept folks guessing all the way through and came up with an ending that had everybody fooled; ""Unbreakable"" (2000), which we'll examine here, was not quite as satisfying, starting out as one kind of movie and ending up as something entirely different, much to the delight of this reviewer and the dismay of many others; ""Signs"" (2002) contained a terrific first half and then wound down to a most inadequate finish; ""The Village"" (2004) began with a promising premise and quickly disintegrated into pure silliness, with a conclusion so mundane it made you weep for could have been; and ""Lady in the Water"" (2006) was little more than a makeshift fairy tale the filmmaker made as a vanity project for his children, a movie that failed at almost every level.

But let's look at the man's bright spots, one of which is ""Unbreakable.""  Shyamalan and star Bruce Willis had combined talents previously to make the enormously popular ghost story, ""The Sixth Sense.""  So, let me tell you up front and frankly, if you liked that movie and its unique gimmick and you're expecting more of the same from ""Unbreakable,"" you will probably be disappointed.  It's not that the new movie is dissatisfying per se or that it doesn't have a good gimmick of its own.  It's that this story ends just where a lot of people will be expecting it to begin.  ""Unbreakable"" has quite a dissimilar plot from ""The Sixth Sense,"" with very different characters, set in a very different world.  Yet it presents a story of similarly quiet tensions.

The story involves two people of about the same age, one a frail, fragile, crippled man named Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson), and the other a strong, sturdy, healthy man named David Dunn (Willis).  We meet Elijah first, at the time of his birth, delivered with both his arms and legs broken.  He has a genetic disorder that causes his bones to fracture easily.  As he is growing up, the other children call him ""Mr. Glass"" for his tendency to shatter easily.  As an adult, Elijah owns a collector's comic-book gallery called ""Limited Edition.""

Meanwhile, David is a security guard for a university stadium, with a wife, Audrey (Robin Wright Penn), and a young son, Joseph (Spencer Treat Clark).  David is about as ordinary a guy as you could imagine, until one day he's involved in a horrendous train wreck where everybody is killed except him.  He miraculously survives, and he doesn't know why.  Then Elijah contacts him.  Elijah, it seems, studies comics as a form of truth and beauty, as folklore based on fact.  He firmly believes that comic-book superheroes walk the Earth, only sometimes they don't know who they are.  Elijah is convinced that David is such a superhero.

David is understandably skeptical of the possibility, although his son is not.  His son buys into the possibility of his father's being a superhero.  David merely thinks Elijah is nuts, and so do we for a while.  Until David begins taking stock of himself and discovers a few things he's never thought about before.  Like the point that he's never been sick a day in his life, not even with a sore throat.  Like he's never been physically hurt.  Like when he tries to do so, he can lift three times the weight he ever thought he could.  Like he has the instinctive ability to know when people are good or evil, when they're carrying guns or drugs.  Like he's able to look into people's souls and know what they've done bad.  Like maybe he really is gifted and invincible.

Basically, David comes to the conclusion, obviously late in life, that he may be a superhero and ought to use his powers for good; thus on one level we have in ""Unbreakable"" a nearly two-hour prologue to a conventional superhero movie.  You know, like in ""Superman"" and ""Batman"" we're given the details about how the heroes got to be heroes.  Well, that's mainly what we get here.  Shyamalan even admits in one of the accompanying featurettes that he originally intended to make a traditional superhero movie where only the first third of the plot was devoted to the hero's recognition of his powers, but as the writer of the story as well as the producer and director, he became so fascinated by the recognition part that he decided to make it the subject of the whole movie.

But that's only on one level.  On another level, Shyamalan sets his story in a completely real, workaday world, which provides some jarring juxtapositions.  David is a common Joe, his job doesn't pay much, his marriage is falling apart, and his son feels distant from him.  Into this very concrete universe, this cosmos like yours or mine, Shyamalan introduces us to a possible fantasy.  This is where the rub comes in.  Comic-book worlds are filled with pure make-believe; we come to accept them as such.  Real-life worlds are filled with believable, credible events; we come to accept them as such.  Certainly, the best of fantasy creates a believable world out of some degree of reality, a world that we don't really believe in literally but one we can pretend to believe in for a few minutes or a few hours.  It's the old ""suspension of disbelief"" idea.  But Shyamalan goes to great lengths to have it both ways, and neither way at the same time.  He tries very hard to make us believe that superheroes are possible in a real-life setting, yet I'm not sure he succeeds.  Of course, maybe that is his point.

Ultimately, we are who we think we are.  As Elijah says, ""The scariest thing is not knowing your place in the world.""  Or as Shakespeare says, ""There is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so.""  Or as Popeye says, ""I yam what I yam.""  If David wants to be a superhero or a tugboat captain, it's up to him.  The film is as good a psychological study of human behavior as it is an extended preface to an action thriller.

That at its conclusion this film stimulated a rare and spirited discussion between the Wife-O-Meter and myself demonstrates that it's not a film to be taken lightly.  She didn't like it very much; I liked it most of the way.  She couldn't accept the collaboration of fantasy and reality being foisted upon her; she resented Elijah's unsolicited intrusion into David's life; and she thought the ending was sloppy.  Make it a comic-book fiction or a real-life drama, but don't try to combine the two.  On the other hand, I bought the superhero angle just as wholly as David's son did.  Perhaps both Joseph and I were looking for the same things--a sense of adventure--while my wife, although loving fantasy, is more pragmatic about the real world; she doesn't mind pretending, but she doesn't want someone shoving it down her throat.  I don't know; ambiguity in a film is sometimes fun and thought-provoking, but it can also be highly frustrating to viewers who want solid answers by a film's end.

There is also the problem in the film that viewers familiar with ""The Sixth Sense"" will every minute be anticipating some kind of surprise.  This is the price Shyamalan must pay for his previous success.  Rather than just following the story line as viewers normally would, they may be spending half their time trying to figure out in advance what the big plot switch is inevitably going to be, what new and startling revelation is going to come.  Such prospects begin to distract a person from the actual goings on.

Additionally, there may be two final shortcomings for some viewers:  Bruce Willis's portrayal of the protagonist and the film's slow pace.  Willis is unrelentingly grim throughout the movie, never smiling once that I can remember, and Shyamalan's direction tends to linger over details and take its leisurely time coming to a point.

However, I did find the film posing any serious problems.  I found its acting fine, as well as its direction, costume design, and musical score.  Willis again proves what a compelling dramatic actor he is, playing a man caught up in emotions, desires, and attractions well beyond his initial understanding.  Jackson is at home playing the off-kilter Elijah.  He blends a slightly sinister demeanor with a frail appearance, a dash of insecurity with a load of confidence.  Penn and Clark as the wife and child are solid in their characterizations, too, although I thought the marital problems David and Audrey were having began to get in the way of the story's main events.  Then, too, Shyamalan's pacing may appear slow, but it rivets one's attention in any case, the sense of pressure and suspense mounting at an escalating tempo.  It's only when the movie is over that you realize that not a lot has actually happened.

As for the costumes, note how a simple rain parka takes on mythic proportions.  And James Newton Hoard's music lends an appropriately distinctive quality to the proceedings, at once spooky, atmospheric, and unique.  Finally, look for a Hitchcock-like cameo appearance by the director, playing a suspected drug dealer at the football stadium.  Yet, as I've said, while ""Unbreakable"" works in most areas, it may not please everyone.  A matter of one's expectations going in, I suppose.

Put it this way:  ""Unbreakable"" is to the oeuvre of M. Night Shyamalan what ""The Twelve Chairs"" is to the collected works of Mel Brooks; it's the one that got away, the one most folks tend to forget or overlook, while it may be one of their best.

Video:
I wasn't particularly keen on the image quality in the original DVD transfer a few years ago, finding it only so-so despite its 2.35:1, widescreen, anamorphic, THX rendering.  Therefore, I wasn't surprised when switching back and forth between the DVD and the Blu-ray disc that the MPEG4/AVC BD mastering didn't have the clearest or most vivid picture quality I've seen in a high-definition release.  Although everything about the BD video is better and more sharply delineated than its DVD equivalent, with deeper, richer colors as well, I still found the overall Blu-ray image a little dull, sometimes a little fuzzy, with faintly blurry, yet sometimes slightly enhanced edges.  I'm thinking the director purposely wanted to avoid a bright, sharp, glossy finish to this product, and several shots are even done as reflections in glass.  To the good, there is only the lightest print grain.  Still, because of the nature of the production, ""Unbreakable"" may not be the very best demo material for high-def, yet still looks good enough not to disappoint fans.

Audio:
The audio choices in English are uncompressed PCM 5.1 or regular Dolby Digital 5.1.  Needless to say, the uncompressed track is quite good and never exaggerated.  The sonics are dynamic and robust, the bass deep, with good midrange clarity and surround sound, when it's present, that is all-encompassing.  Music, crowd noises, trains, rain, water, all envelop us in their sphere, although, to be honest, there aren't a lot of sequences that utilize it much.  Because there are very few special effects in the film, at least no elaborate ones, the sound gets a chance to reinforce the reality of David's world rather than go for spectacle, which will delight some listeners and dissatisfy others who are expecting more.  This is a film more interested in the quiet moments than the bombastic ones.

Extras:
For special features, Buena Vista offer pretty much the same things they did in their two-disc DVD ""Vista Series"" set.  First up, we find a fourteen-minute behind-the-scenes featurette, with the actors, director, and other filmmakers comment on the film ; a nineteen-minute ""Comic Books and Superheroes"" featurette, with interviews of comic-book artists and writers like Will Eisner, Denny O'Neil, Frank Miller, and a slew of others; seven deleted scenes, about twenty-nine minutes, with the director introducing each selection; a multi-angle train station sequence, where you can shift between the final footage and the original storyboards; and a home movie of Night's first fight sequence, which he shot when he was a kid.  As in the DVD set, there is no audio commentary by any of the filmmakers accompanying the feature and no theatrical trailer.

The extras wrap up with twenty-eight scene selections and a chapter list that shows through the inside of the front cover; English, French, and Spanish spoken languages; French and Spanish subtitles; English captions for the hearing impaired; and on-screen menus.

Parting Thoughts:
""Unbreakable"" is undoubtedly a controversial film that seems like it's doing a lot more and going a lot further as you're watching it than when you're thinking about it afterwards.  It will not appeal to everybody, but it's one I found personally rewarding, most particularly for its remarkable characterizations and those quiet tensions I mentioned earlier.  In fact, if you found ""The Sixth Sense"" too gimmicky, then you might find ""Unbreakable"" Shyamalan's very best film.  Or his worst; it's a strange affair.  For fans like me, the movie is unbeatable; for non-fans, it may be unbearable.

In ""Unbreakable"" the filmmaker doesn't have a lot to say that isn't too obvious, but I like the way he says it.",1435276800,2,13364,4.859036676977463

1291180,5,B00003CXQA,"Ordinary David Dunn (Bruce Willis) has a failing marriage, a son who needs him, and a job as a security guard. However, all that changes after a severe train wreck and he is the only survivor. Even more miraculous, he is completely unharmed. When confronted by a man named Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson), who suggests David is invulnerable, David shrugs it off but eventually begins to test himself and discovers that maybe hes not that ordinary after all and soon learns he can do things no other man can. At Elijahs insistence, David explores his abilities even more and soon begins a journey that reveals maybe he is indeed unbreakable.

Ive said it before and Ill say it again: I love superhero origin stories and Unbreakable is just that. Written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan of Sixth Sense fame, Unbreakable is a story deconstructing the superhero, and suggesting a possible real life origin for these amazing people, while keeping your interest from start to finish.

Using the real-life medical condition osteogenesis imperfecta as a springboard, suggesting that if someone with such frail bones can exist, is it not possible someone with unbreakable boneseven bodycan exist? And thus is the story as we follow Elijah Price as he searches out this amazing possibility in the person of David Dunn.

This movie also heavily references comic books, Elijah posing the idea that comic books are modern day retellings of stories of times past and of real people who once were able to do things other people couldnt.

Each moment of this movie is an in-depth look at what makes the superhero tick, everything from the discovery of his power, to his motivation in using it, to the doubt that such a possibility could exist in a person, to finding a possible weakness, to balancing having this special ability with the demands of everyday life, and more.

This movie is a drama and not an action flick. While there is some action, namely toward the end, its a life and times superhero story that makes you stop and think about what being a person with an extraordinary ability might actually be like, if it would be easy or hard, or a bit of both. What kind of challenges would you face? What kinds of benefits?

Apparently, M. Night Shyamalan came up with the idea following the standard three-part structure of a superhero story: the origin, the rise to being a hero, then the final confrontation with the villain. The movie has all these elements, but because he found it the most interesting, Shyamalan spends most of the time focusing on the origin. As a result, there is such depth surrounding David Dunn and Elijah Price that as the hero and villain, they rival characters that have been around for decades in terms of richness. Very well done.

This movie is just so, so good and is one of my all-time favorites. Its one of those flicks to throw on on a rainy day, get under a blanket, and get swept up in the world of the superhero only to be inspired to look for the spectacular in ones own self.

Highly recommended.",1429660800,,3034,4.700564971751413

It asks several questions: Could comic books have originated as a means of depicting the real deeds of superheroes who live among us? What are we capable of if only we made the right choices to find our true destinies? Unbreakable builds tension slowly as these questions are asked and answered.  Bruce Willis is very good and I will always believe that Samuel L. Jackson should have been nominated for a Best Actor Academy Award for his performance.

1291598,5,B00003CXQA,"One of M. Night Shyamalan's less popular films, but I loved it. This had a better feel for how a comic unfolds than most other comic book based movies. You could feel struggle to know, but not accept what seemed to be inevitable. The desire to cover what might just make you strange and different from others. You could also see the inner-battle to control and understand the ability. I liked that it wasn't the usual, ""Oh, look how great it is to have this power or ability!"" type of super-hero movie. The movie definitely brought out the inner-struggle and the challenge of accepting the ability or power.

1291765,4,B00003CXQA,"I've been a follower of superhero stories for a long time.  I remember when Miller's ""Dark Knight"" and Moore's ""Watchmen"" shook up expectations of what such stories could be.  Sadly, ""Unbreakable"" doesn't rise to that height -- but it was a fresh take on what a superhero story could be.  Absolutely fantastic casting, Samuel L. Jackson for once playing a role that is not at all his usual fare, and doing it extremely well.  The interplay between the lead character and his son was well done and interesting (though it goes way over the top at one scene, afterwards they sort of ignore that and it's fun to watch again).

Bruce Willis really does a fabulous job with his lead part -- unfortunately, the scripting on that part is not up to the creative ideas that drive this film.  There is a limit to how long I can watch someone trying hard not to participate in his life before I want to walk away.  I stuck with it, and I'm glad I did, but I can't be as enthusiastic about this film as I would like to be.  On the other hand, I'm very glad to have watched it.",1396915200,5,1063,4.306532663316583

The movie has that subtle creepiness that we have come to expect from Shyamalan, as well as plot turns and twist you could never see coming. Really an excellent movie. I don't know how this movie managed to slip under the radar of so many people. At once calm yet exciting.

Anyway, great movie. So well done, Bruce Willis shows subtlety and depth-as good as The Sixth Sense. So many well done scenes.

Regarding the ending-I wondered, what if there had not been the 'surprise' ending? What if it had ended just before that?

It would have been a great movie either way. I think that since The Sixth Sense had a surprise ending as well, it smacked of a tactic.

1291913,2,B00003CXQA,"I'll say this, the movie is intriguing... until the 'payoff' ending. it's a joke. It's the same issue with nearly all shamalamadingdong's movies, he HAS to have a twist and the twist in this movie is just a joke and makes you wonder what you could have done with your time instead of watch this movie.

Blanket statement
Here's what i have to say about m. night and what i think he based all his movies: Once upon a time, he saw the movie The Usual Suspects. I would argue that, that movie energized the surprise ending theme. And so shamalamadingdong saw that and said WOW that's amazing i'm going to make all my movies have a twist ending because it's awesome! Now, here's the difference: if you watch all of the usual suspects EXCEPT the surprise ending, it's still a great movie. You skip the ending of any of m. night's films, and it's just melodrama, melodrama, melodrama. It's seriously all the man knows. Melodrama + twist ending = TheMostAweseomeStuffEVER in his mind.

Everything except the ending
The film is well done, but that's like saying you're a C student in an ivy league school. The melodrama is engaging, you're basically going along with this character finding out things as he finds them out, and it generally keeps your interest. I actually think this is one of the last films bruce willis actually TRIED acting. Nowadays bruce just does bruce, and that's it, and it's pretty boring. samuel jackson also puts on a great show.

This movie was still during the excitement following the six sense which rocketed m. night to fame, and i think a lot of people wanted to like this movie, and think they like this movie, but will have to accept that it's not nearly as good of a movie as the six sense(a movie which i think is vastly better, but still is overhyped)",1384646400,,1781,4.559375

1291918,4,B00003CXQA,"I have become a fan of film director M. Night Shyamalan. While not in the same class as a director as some of my other favorite directors like Alfred Hitchcock, Steven Spielberg or Akira Kurosawa Shyamalan still has provided some great suspenseful and thought provoking films like ""The Sixth Sense"", ""Signs"" and ""The Happening"" among others. ""Unbreakable"" is another example of just how good Shyamalan can be as a movie director. A clever story line with great actors in the lead parts and a another one of those unexpected plot twists at the end of the film that you won't see coming.

The story is about two men. One who's name is Elijah Price, played by Samuel L. Jackson, who from birth has a rare bone disorder that leaves them very fragile. The day he was born Elijah had both his arms and legs broken. As a result Elijah has had to live a careful life so not to risk injury. Elijah developes a love for comic books with a belief that superhero's live among us. David Dunn, played by Bruce Willis, is just an ordinary guy who has a job in security at a sports stadium. Dunn is a man however who has never been sick or injured in his life. One day while riding the train home from work the train derails killing everyone on board save one person. David Dunn. Price is convinced Dunn is one of those superhero's who live among us and approaches Dunn about this. Dunn of course doesn't believe it. Then he gets thinking about how he has never been sick or injured. Then Dunn comes to realize that if he comes in contact with a person who is planning on doing harm to someone he can sense that something is going to happen. Dunn slowly comes to believe that maybe there is something to this super  hero stuff and with Elijah's help tried to develop his powers.

The story is compelling and you can easily get caught up in the characters lives and whether Dunn is indeed a superhero. If there is one thing against it the movie does move at a slow pace a bit. Still that is not a totally bad thing. While it could move a little faster that doesn't mean ""Unbreakable"" is boring. In fact it can keep you on your toes as incidents occur and things are said in passing that come back later in the movie to have relevance to the story. It forces you to tune in to what is happening as well a guessing what will happen next.

The story is basically a superhero story but an ultra realistic one.  Frankly, I wish more movies were like this.  It's my biggest complaint with most movies.  They have been far to Hollywoodized.  Tons of special effects, thin plots, impossible situations, etc.  This has none of it.

The story does get slow in places, but I still enjoyed it immensely. If you want a movie that give a real life portrayal of a superhero, look no farther.",1376956800,6,672,4.571428571428571

Where other ""comic hero"" films try to wring ""ahhhs"" from there audience with flashy special effects and shocking violence, this one does it with a simple look of the eyes and a well placed close-up.

10 stars for real acting and not mindless action. Once in a while there is a movie that is a diamond in the ruff.

1292079,4,B00003CXQA,"The plot emphasized some unique characteristics of human nature in a manner that was not overly sensationalized and from a perspective which allowed the audience to relate, empathize and possibly even project themselves into the possibility.
Self worth and individual identity were the basic draw which allowed the audience to project themselves into Bruce Willis' character.
Beyond the unreality of having survived an undeniable catastrophe, he plays a good average guy character to whom anybody can relate. He honestly is struggling with major life realities, finding a job (reason for being on train), struggling in a relationship and searching for meaning and happiness in his life. The two former may be considered symptoms or byproducts of the latter, but all emphasize his struggle with self worth and identity.
This identity struggle is what allows for a perfect blend of transition into the concept of being super human, a comic book like super hero. Spider-Man,  Superman, Wolverine, to name a few all endured, conquered and came to some sort of understanding with who they were as individuals and  how these unique abilities factor into their existence.
The last thing I will say is I enjoyed the presentation of a possibility being given as a rational corporeal explanation for what we fictionalize and adorn as supernatural. To consider that authentic human abilities beyond normal standards may only have been evolutionary or genetic anomalies of a far less grand scale is a profound consideration. These accounts of such individuals may then have been embellished in order to facilitate their being passed along as stories or in a smaller sense, as implicated by Jackson's character, to preserve a record, the basic purpose of  story telling throughout history.",1372896000,15,1776,5.268551236749117

1292083,4,B00003CXQA,"Well, we know they can all 3 make bad movies individually occasionally, but together? Thankfully, no. This was the first project after the ground-breaking, record-setting 'I see dead people' thing, so Willis and Shylaman hooked up again for this project - and added Sam. There can be no issues with the production values, acting, filming, and directing - all are perfect. The only criticism is the story and ending (its a Shymalan movie, so it has to have a requisite unique ending you didn't see coming). I won't spoil it for you, but the poor reviews and anything I've ever heard bad about this is for its ending - not the movie itself or ANYTHING to do with the movie itself. It's great. That said, it helps if you like comic books and believe in heros, and can stand a whinny Robin Wright and a militant Afro-American (literally) Samuel L. Jackson. Also if you like your art to have some intrinsic meaning and realize that, like life, not everything is neatly wrapped up in an hour or two. Not only will you not see the ending coming, some don't like it's meaning - and then the film is over, with sort an awkward post-script sort of reminiscent of an earlier genre - perhaps a homage. In my humble opinion, you cannot can yourself a fan of any of the stars without viewing this work - it's indispensable. If you are unfamiliar with the material and just want a good movie, you will find one - but it wont' be what you expect. I'd like to see how he would have ended it with about $5-$10 million more in the budget, or (gasp!) a sequel, as we now have for anything even remotely related to this genre - but I'm not going to tell you what it is - you have to see for yourself.",1372118400,,1679,4.350318471337579

1292167,5,B00003CXQA,"I was really surprised by this movie. It takes two relativly simple characters in Bruce Willis and Samuel L Jackson, brings them together and makes quite an impressice movie.

While the individual story points, Jackson bones breaking, marriage issues, a person who doesn't remember their past blocking their true potential and what it means to be a hero, all appear simple they are woven together and create a powerful emotional message for those able to grasp it. Bicentinal Man and Powder are other movies that are strucutured simmerily, for those who have seen/heard those movies.

Following Bruce Willis's progress was surprisingly a fun ride as we all go through a period where we try and realize who we are and it's almost always interesting to view a character trying to complete that journey. Jackson to has a journey but of a different nature.

There is however one problem with the movie. Both of the main characters are given a weakness during the movie, yet neither fully develop a story with it. Jackson just simply reveals he has Bruce Willis's weakness but that's it and its never mentioned again for him.

Willis is given a history with the same fault but, when the oppertunity is given for him to overcome it, he doesn't. (Slight spoiler, Instead he is helped by two people who got out of the house without detection by the bad man. Really? That ruins what could've been a good scene and it also doesn't make sense, as it appears the bad man let them go but stays where he was before.)

That one scene is my only problem with the entire movie in hindsight. Still I loved this movie and really recommend it.",1369785600,,1623,4.680701754385965

Unbreakable is so delicately and suspensefully told  it is like slow motion but nevertheless inexorably unfolds without the amateurish gimmick of foreshadowing and faulty slow moving plot. Suspense in this movie is not created as it is in so much film and literature by foreshadowing. Rather, suspense is created as it should be created, which is from the emotions and actions of the characters. Damn near a completely original movie. Beautifully done. I can't recommend it enough.

It is highly entertaining, in my opinion, but from a film criticism perspective, purely analytically, this is masterfully handled in nearly every way a film can be. Due to the excellent cinematography and vivid visuals (color-coding is very important in this film) and dense imagery per frame, I highly recommend viewing Unbreakable in HD.

1292170,2,B00003CXQA,"The paint can/weightlifting scene went on way too long and was silly.

What male on the planet has not already tried to see how strong he is? Really. What was the deal with the comic book store scene, where Jackson sits in the back for 10 minutes of film time? That scene belongs in the Extra Features, Deleted Scenes. Samuel Jackson running down the steps? Did anyone think he would ever do that, a man who drives a car fully padded on the inside to cushion him because any jostling breaks his bones? Running down slippery metal steps, using his cane? That was insulting to the viewer.

The gun scene was way too long, and was just stupid.

Child holds a gun on indestructable father while hysterical mother stands dumbly on the side. Why didn`t she calmly walk between the two, and end the threat? I guess because it`s a Hollywood film.

Scene with the red jacket was too much like Schlinder`s List. Should have copied another film.

When Bruce Willis starts his do-gooder act, he looks a bit too much like Batman.

No special features on the DVD! It didn`t have an ending. Maybe an ok film to watch while you read the paper.",1369008000,,1127,4.4731707317073175
1292171,3,B00003CXQA,"Unbreakable, I find to be a very underrated M. Night Shyamalan film. I find the Sixth Sense to be slightly overrated, I find this film a bit underrated. People are mixed about this film. Some love it, some hate it. I admit when I first watched this film, I did not really care for it. However, as I viewed it again and watched people's reviews on it my opinion changed. I think this is one of Shyamalan's films. I personally enjoy this film more than Sixth Sense. I am a fan of superhero films as well. I like that this is a new take on superheroes at the time.

The movie revolves around this man named David Dunne, played by Bruce Willis. There was a train crash where no one survived but him. Later you find out he is basically unbreakable. You also have Samuel L. Jackson, who plays a character named Elijah Prince a.k.a Mr. Glass. He is essentially the villain to Bruce Willis. He is the one who tells David about his gift.

The acting is good all around. I think Bruce Willis does a better job here than in Sixth Sense. I really like his dynamic with Samuel L. Jackson's character. My favorite scenes of the movie are when those two characters are talking to each other. The other characters are alright, but I did not care for them. I personally found David's wife to be annoying at times.

The effects are great in this. The fights are not that great. However, I could forgive it because this is supposed to be a darker and more realistic take on a superhero. I also really like the theme of destiny that is played up in this film. In this film, unlike in most film, destiny is played up as not such a good thing. I'm not a fan of the destiny theme in most movies, but here I thinks it's done right.

The idea is profoundly unique and the cast is great, but I really didn't like how it turned out. The first half of the movie was awesome, but as Shyamalan movies tend to do, it got weird, in this case too weird for me. While I love Samuel L. Jackson, his character was just annoying and I didn't really consider him a threatening villain. Bruce Willis on the other hand was terrific, but his character was just naturally dull. Shyamalan wanted to keep the story as real and believable as possible, but a superhero who just can't get hurt and has no other real powers is just kind of stupid.

1292248,4,B00003CXQA,"When this movie was released in 2000, everyone expected another Sixth Sense-esque movie from Shyamalan and many were sorely disappointed. The twist ending didn't help either.

I have had this DVD since it was released and happened to watch it a couple of days ago - just by accident - I had nothing to do and happened to pop the first DVD that came to my hand in the DVD player. I was completely impressed.

I'd already watched this movie 3 or 4 times earlier but not recently. While I liked it then, I found it better now. So what changed from then till now? The mindset after watching the new wave of super hero flicks starting from 2002 with Spiderman, then Daredevil, Hulk, Batman, and so on and so forth.

Unfortunately for Shyamalan, this movie was released before these flicks, and there was no ""reference"" point for people to connect to and identify with. Seen now against the backdrop of all these films, Unbreakable makes much more sense. It is all about an ""ordinary person"" - one of us - coming to terms with his abilities - the ignoring, the unease, the disbelief, sacrifices, slow recognition and the reluctant acceptance.

The movie is extremely subtle; a movie that will delight the thinking person. The story evolves slowly; the camerawork is intriguing to say the least (for instance, when the young Elijah is presented a comic book in the playground, it is shown up-side down, as it is to him. He turns the book around, and the camera also follows so that it is up-side down again to us); the colour of the entire movie has a bluish tinge which gives a slightly unreal effect; the music score is incredible (note how the tone changes from a slightly sad yet happy tone to ominous when the ""hero"" Willis in the station is about to encounter the ""villain"" janitor).. the ""twist"" ending is almost an anticlimax but very relevant.

All in all - a movie that was ahead of its time. 4.5 stars.",1358294400,4,1906,4.56140350877193

He meets a man, Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson), that has searched for him all of his life.

He takes the time to develop the characters in the story and you get to understand their personalities.

1292430,5,B00003CXQA,"I bought this originally on DVD, and it is one of the best super-hero movies ever made. This is not the comic book style we are used to seeing today, but a look at super-hero's from a whole new perspective. Bruce Willis is excellent in the role, as a under-employed security guard, who gave up a promising career in football, after faking being injured in a car crash, just to please his wife. He had always known deep down inside that he was different, and reluctant to accept his gifts. Only when his courageously persistent son, and a man obsessed with finding his polar opposite, shed light on his ability, does Willis finally understand who he really is, and what he is meant to be in life. All of this is built around a troubled marriage, and a very average life.

This is not about a super-hero, saving the world, it is about the discovery of one's purpose, and all the actors (Willis, Jackson, Wright and the kid) are performing at a very believable level.

From the first scene, this movie grabs you.  Yes, there's a twist at the very end, but you can kind of figure it out as the movie goes along.  There were some scenes from which I had to shield my eyes -- such as when the character played by Samuel Jackson falls down the stairs in pursuit of a villain.

Samuel Jackson's character is very sympathetic. You feel his physical and emotional pain. Even at the end, despite who he turns out to be, you still feel sorry for him.  Bruce Willis' character is also very sympathetic -- an emotionally stunted firefighter, with a wife and child from whom he appears estranged.  The son gives a strong performance -- especially the scene where he figures out that his father is extraordinarily strong.

1292481,5,B00003CXQA,"If there is one thing I love about M. Night Shamalayan's films, it is that they generally work on several levels, are thought provoking, and don't rely on generic material to tell a story. Sure, viewers of his films now look for the ""twist"" at the conclusion (thanks to The Sixth Sense), but there is so much more to the viewing experience that we shouldn't judge a film solely on its conclusion (like many did in The Village). Unbreakable is such a film that works on many levels, and has a symbolic, yet human aspect to it.

The first time I saw Unbreakable at the movies, it just struck me as a strange flick, seemingly slow-moving but telling a tale of two vastly different characters. Years later, having seen the film several times since, I have a love and appreciation for this film and its depth. The film itself works as a sort of comic book story told in human form. Bruce Willis plays David Dunn, a man who has had the remarkable fortune to been the sole survivor of a terrible train wreck. He's also never been sick in his life. You might say that, despite his fortunate moment, David is a pretty normal guy, with an uneventful, yet somewhat conflicted life. He works as a security guard at a stadium, but has had marital problems and isn't as happy as he could be with life. Shamalayan brings a real human, everyday quality to David, who comes to the realization that larger forces may be at work in his life. David's ho-hum existence will be interrupted by the man who really is his opposite, Elijah Price. Elijah (played brilliantly by Samuel L. Jackson), is David's antithesis. Nicknamed ""Mr. Glass"", Elijah is prone to injury, sickness, uses a cane to walk; he is eccentric, odd and strange, and has a fanatic, obsessive streak about comics. Elijah is quite obsessed with David's ability to survive and sees an almost superhuman relevance to his existence. It will become evident to David only later what this encounter with the strange man means, as several conflicts surface.

Unbreakable incorporates an understated level within its telling, but it is masterful in building both a symbolic and literal level of storytelling. On one side is the comic book angle of good vs. evil; both sides exist in the world and seem to balance each other out. Each of the two main characters, David and Elijah, represent these two angles. The story that is told from David's point of view brings with it a simple, but readily identifiable theme: we each have a gift, and we need to use it for the common good. One aspect of Unbreakable is really just David finding his identify and existence in the world. The scenery, visuals, colors all enhance the experience of watching as well.

If there is one drawback, it is the ending, which other reviewers have noted. I don't fault it on its intentional or unintentional supposed ""twist"", but rather that it was just rushed and not thought out. The ending seemingly kills the momentum of an otherwise deep film.

Still, I think that the film is excellent, and the DVD gives you fantastic extras which give background into the story of Unbreakable and the cast, but more importantly, put much of the film in perspective. Well worth the purchase.

4 stars for the film, but 5 for the entire DVD package.",1290816000,,3250,4.655052264808362

1292486,5,B00003CXQA,"Gee, what a difference a poor marketing strategy can make.

It was perhaps inevitable that 'Unbreakable' would be billed as another suspense thriller after the huge success of 'The Sixth Sense'. But while there is a supernatural element and a twist ending of sorts, in reality the two films have little in common. 'Unbreakable' is at its heart a subdued and slow-moving character study that deals with themes such as heroism and the fortunes of fate. It's easy to see why those expecting another taut psychological thriller would have confused and disappointed with this.

But just judge the film for what it is. 'Unbreakable' has a fascinating premise derived from the ""superhero"" themes of comic books. Elijah Price (Samuel L Jackson), who suffers extremely brittle bones due to osteogenesis imperfecta, theorises that since he is weak and fragile, there must exist his polar opposite: an ""unbreakable"" man of unnatural, super-human strength. And when David Dunn (Bruce Willis) survives a massive train crash without a scratch, Price believes he has finally found the hero he has been searching for. What follows is part battle-of-wills, part character study, part supernatural fantasy, part comic book, and part crime drama, as Price attempts to convince Dunn to realise his apparent hidden powers and use them for good.

Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson are best known for playing wisecracking larger-than-life characters, but they give very under-stated performances here that suit both the film and their characters. Jackson especially is quite restrained in his role, giving Elijah a quiet dignity and strength while hinting at the ruthless determination he is capable of. The subdued nature of the film means that some of the supporting characters aren't as memorable as they could be, although I felt that Elijah's mother provided a strong and poignant emotional presence to several scenes.

Shyamalan apparently wanted this to be the first of a trilogy of films, and one criticism you could make is that the film does feel like a prequel at times. There is a long, slow build-up, and the film ends with an abrupt twist just when you think it should be getting into its stride. However, I feel that David and Elijah are such fascinating characters that they deserve the detailed exploration the film gives them, and if that means that story takes a back seat to character development then so be it. There is a typical Shyamalan twist ending, but even this is more powerful as a character revelation than as a device to further the plot.

So yes, if you go in to this film expecting another `Sixth Sense', you might be disappointed. But if you are prepared to be patient and put some thought into it, `Unbreakable' is an excellent, under-rated, and unique film that will reward your efforts.

Shyamalan apparently regards this as his best film, and I agree. Five stars.",1275609600,,2879,5.01255230125523
1292487,1,B00003CXQA,"I like the actors, so I sat through this for their performances and I kept thinking something in the story would make it worth it.  Sadly, I was wrong and that's a chunk of time I can never get back.  Awful.  Lame.  If it was an option, I'd give negative stars.",1273276800,2,261,4.0588235294117645
1292488,5,B00003CXQA,"I was initially disappointed with the climax of this film. My heart sank, not so much because of what had occurred in the movie but because I felt that my growing admiration for M. Night Shyamalan had been seriously damaged. The climax felt trite, contrived, and thoroughly unrewarding. I felt for a moment that the things Night's detractors had said about him were true. That is, until I took the DVD out and decided to give what I had just seen some serious thought. After a few minutes the realization sank in: the climax to Unbreakable is the only conclusion it could logically have come to, given everything that precedes it and given the themes it develops. In this way it is nearly on par with The Sixth Sense.

Ostensibly, this is a film concerning the relationship between David Dunn (Bruce Willis), the lone survivor of a train derailment, and Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson), a collector and afficianado of comic books. Elijah believes Dunn to be the superhero he has been looking for all his life, the exact opposite of himself, as Elijah has been afflicted since birth with a medical condition which causes his bones to break very easily. The story follows Elijah's efforts to convince Dunn that he is truly a superhero. But in Unbreakable, as with most of Night's films, there are many different stories and themes inter-acting with one another. On the simplest level, it's a story about a superhero, his classic reluctance to attain to his role due to a quiet humility and a lack of selfish ambition. It's also a love story, and, as is typical with Night's masterful storytelling, there are several love relationships being examined: father and son (Dunn and Joseph), mother and son (Elijah and his mother), and husband and wife. Intertwined with that there is a story of frustration, anger, resentment, and evil. Since this is a film about opposites, there are equal glimpses into the workings of good and evil, and the various types and magnitudes of both. On the side of the good we see the common love of parents for their children, the sacrifice of a promising career and great success for the sake of romantic love, and the selfless intervention at the scene of a horrendous crime to save the innocent. On the side of evil we see petty theft, barbarous torture and murder, and calculated, catastrophic massacre.

I could go on and on about the possible themes treated in this amazing film. The one that really jumped out at me is the old argument between Freewill and Determinism. How Elijah Price comes to be the person he is is brilliantly executed, especially in a flashback scene where his mother entices her son to go outside and get a gift she has left for him on a park bench. The gift turns out to be a comic book, and Elijah's mother tells him that she has bought a bunch of them. So Elijah is rewarded for his virtuous effort of going out into a dangerous world by acquiring access to a fantasy world where heroism and virtue are delineated with vivid clarity. But being the intelligent child that he is, Elijah also sees that for every hero there is a villain, for every act of good, a contrary act of evil; for every good thing, a bad thing: a balance. It is not for nothing that when Elijah opens the gift the comic book is upside down. He will see things upside down at another point in the film, and there is a strong thematic purpose behind it, as there is a strong thematic purpose in his interest, even obsession, with comics.

What has this to do with freewill versus determinism? A lot. Was Elijah's personality mapped out for him by his initial circumstances? Certainly his medical disability is not his choice, but to what extent does the vulnerability and weakness caused by that disorder effect his character, his life choices, his destiny? Some would say a great deal, others would say his choices were entirely his own despite the disadvantages he was beset with. It's a huge ethical issue which goes far beyond the parameters of a simple superhero flick. And it's an issue which in bygone days I thought I was decided on, but which now leaves me entangled in doubt and wonder.

Unbreakable is also a study in the struggle for identity and sense of purpose, and in this respect it has something in common with the later film, Lady in the Water. Unbreakable is a darker film, but ultimately, no less hopeful.",1273104000,3,4355,4.644617380025941

I veneer of film grain covers the image, yielding terrific detail in textures, faces, and depth.  This also indicates no DNR...an enemy of BD.  Blacks are inky without crush.

UNBREAKABLE is one of my favorites and I highly recommend it to anyone interested in the hero archetype.

The video presentation may not be reference quality but Blu-ray pays off here in spades, thanks to all the subtle hints and superb details that the filmmakers included. It's supposed to be dark and drab because it highlights the careful use of color.

The audio is great, but be sure to select the lossless track, because Dolby 5.1 is the default setting.

1292590,4,B00003CXQA,"I had not known of this film when I purchased it on the name of Bruce Willis. I suppose it warrants the characterization of ""atmospheric"" since in fact that is about all there is. Action plays a subordinate role to Willis' portrayal of the man with an itch from a source he cannot fathom. The Jackson character is given limited scope, inherent in its delineation by the film's creators. Apparently, this is to be the natural history of a comic book hero born of real, normal parents, living a real man's family life but alienated from meaningful connections with the world. In the denouement, with Jackson's help, he finds that place. The ending is a distinct falling off a cliff, its abruptness being a let-down from the build-up and pinnacle. It is one of those endings which makes one feel that the creators ran out of steam.

1292591,4,B00003CXQA,"`Unbreakable' is one of those films that has aged rather well with me.  When director M. Night Shyamalan first introduced himself to the movie going public in 1999 (`The Sixth Sense' was his second film, but it was the first that got anyone to take notice) he had so much promise, but sadly `Unbreakable' is the only film since that has expounded on that promise.  One day I'll bombard you with a verbal slaughtering of `Lady in the Water', `Signs' and `The Village' (I refuse to see `The Happening'), but until then you can relish in some praise for `Unbreakable'.

Shyamalan's answer to the super hero origin story, `Unbreakable' tells of David Dunn, a unhappily married man who lives a rather ordinary (if not bland) life until a tragic train accident adds a new purpose to his life.

This is not your average superhero story, and it isn't anything like `The Sixth Sense', so it may be hard for many to completely get into this film.  I remember when I saw it in the theater I was let down pretty bad, and so was everyone else I was with.  We were expecting something like `The Sixth Sense', complete with the scares we felt when watching the 1999 thriller.  Instead, `Unbreakable' is a slow and brooding character study that is more haunting than scary.  Like I said, it has aged well with me.  I appreciate the film much more now than I did when I first saw it (kind of like `The Village', although I still think that `The Village' is a mediocre film).

One thing that I really admire about this film is Shyamalan's direction.  Sure, his screenwriting skills have become convoluted and forced as the years have progressed (he tries way too hard, and it shows) but his direction is always near impeccable.  He knows how to capture a mood and tone.  Here, he gives a very dark and gritty atmosphere to the film without ever compromising the comic book feel (the way the film is shot is almost TOO smart).  The characters are shot in ways that accentuate their personalities and eventualities marvelously, using such clever technique to embellish what Shyamalan has crafted on the page.  In fact, upon reflection I think that this direction may be even more accomplished and noteworthy than that of `The Sixth Sense'.

The acting is all very appropriate and at times even moving.  Bruce Willis gives the performance of his career in `The Sixth Sense', and he follows that up with yet another very well controlled and admirable effort.  Although he is known for his action films, for me he really shows a depth and range here that he should tap into more often.  Robin Wright Penn is also quite impressive in her scenes, and although Jackson does come off somewhat clichd and campy at times, he evokes a genuine chill (as in `down the back of your spine') that captures Shyamalan's vision marvelously.  I actually thought that the films best performance came from Spencer Treat Clark, who understood the balance between his characters fear and admiration of his father.

It was stunning and only grows more and more haunting every time I see the film.

The idea of the `every man' coming into his own as a superhero has been approached before, but Shyamalan adds a layer of realism to this film by ditching the corny one-liners, ridiculous costumes and unrealistic `super villains' and their dastardly deeds, replacing them with a normal man muddling through realistic dialog, struggling to understand himself in a world with drug dealers and murderers and front page headline stories that you read about everyday.

Like I said, this is not your typical superhero story...this is a superhero movie for people who don't like superhero movies.",1265587200,,3642,4.75516693163752
1292592,5,B00003CXQA,"In ""Unbreakable"" Bruce plays an everyday man David Dunn who has extraordinary powers. After escaping a tragedy unharmed he starts to think that there is something wrong with him because he's never been hurt in his life. David comes to meet another gentleman on the other side of the pendulum, Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson) who has gone out of his way to follow David's miraculous powers. The more the plot unfolds the more we learn that David is such a heroic and humbled man who just wants to find out why he is like this. Bruce Willis was especially believable during the scene with the gun. There was so much passion in his voice. But it's not until David starts to embrace his special powers that he was born with does he really start to see what is going on around with him. It's like he is able to step outside of the box and look at the entire picture and that picture isn't very pretty and it's not very nice to look at. And that's why this role was so perfect for Bruce because he was able to channel his natural abilities of drama and even action to give such power and credence to an everyday man who happens to be everyone's hero. There is a plot twist that will really catch you for a loop, I can't imagine anyone would expect it. This is a wonderful movie because it's both uplifting and empowering and shows that heroes or angels or whatever you want to call them walk among us. ""Unbreakable"" is also an affective movie for displaying evil and virtu in the most semblance and basic ways. Robin Wright was also excellent playing Bruce's wife because there was an almost severe and magnanimous quality about her character that came shining through.

You see they don't belong in the same genre as there is no supernatural/spirit world theme here except that it's obvious that this film has in some way inspired the tv drama series ""Heroes"" where ""normal"" guys without elaborate costumes have powers that they use either for good or for evil.  Other than being able to take huge knocks without breaking, David Dunne's truly special power is the ability to know through a simple touch what evil misdeed someone has done.  As a tribute to the comic medium as a way to tell stories/myths that has origins all the way back to the first civilisations e.g. Egyptian stone carvings etc this film will appeal more to lovers of comics and their collectors as they try to justify their addiction to and continued spending on them.

It moves at a slow pace and tells a story of someone who fails to discover what his niche is in life and is hence miserable which affects all aspects of his life until a mysterious stranger shows him the way.  This film does reward the patient viewer but overall I'd say that it falls into the ok but not the great category the latter of which ""The 6th Sense"" belongs.  This Vista Series version is interesting as it comes in 2 discs with some special features such as a documentary about comics and some trailers and a making of film although overall nothing much to shout about.

The main course is a mixed bag as although the sound quality is very good having been given the THX treatment as well as having a DTS option although the picture quality isn't as good with white spots and other imperfections on some of the frames.

1292673,4,B00003CXQA,"M. Night Shyamalan wrote, produced and directed this psychological thriller.  The stars include Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson.

The story is strange and involves parallel comic book hero and villain.  The beliefs we have of what characteristics a hero and villain have are embedded in the story.

The hero is David Dunn (Bruce Willis -a Philadelphia security guard) and the villain is Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson) who deals in the art and culture of comic books.

The movie starts with a train crash that David survives with no injuries.  All other 130 passengers die.  You also see Elijah being born and the doctor asking if anyone had dropped the baby?  The people nearby say no - and then the doctor said the bones in the legs and arms are broken.  So two extremes on the bell curve of strength that  slowly and darkly to the surprise ending.

David Dunn's estranged wife (Robin Wright Penn) is deciding whether to stay or leave - their marriage is falling apart.  David was flirting with another woman after coming home from a job interview  in New York when his train derails.  He seems to know something will happen as he looks warily at the driver of the train and sounds are exaggerated.  His son sees the news of the train crash on TV at home and realizes his dad is on that train.  He meets them both unscathed.  His wife asked if he got the job in New York.  He did not - he remains a security guard, but gets a $40 raise for not taking any sick days in 5 years.

Through many scenes we realize that David has hardly been injured or sick, has great strength and able to deterine if someone is carrying a gun or is about to do something bad. He is slowly convinced by his son and Elijah he is a super hero.  Although the movie is in color I had the impression it was gray tones and black and white - dark like the story.

An above average thriller of  good and evil, black and white, strength and weakness.",1250380800,3,1925,4.378531073446328
1292674,4,B00003CXQA,"J. Night Shyamalan has made yet another cerebral thriller and this time its super heroes. You get all the same kind of engrossing mystery as in Sixth Sense, but this time with a little dose of comic book ""what if?"" is thrown in the mix. What comes out is a seriously cool adaptation to a theme that just about every one of us has imagined at least one time in our lives. What would it be like to have super powers?

Just like his other thrillers. The beauty of the movie is slowly learning what the heck is going on. You go through this ordinary security guard's tribulation of finding out if he really is nigh invulnerable. The story is done really well in this aspect. You get really swept away in this trek to find the truth. Many of the scenes use color, sound and other cinematography techniques to bring out an even greater artistic enhancement of storytelling. These techniques almost make you feel like you are seeing techniques used in comic books to enhance the story in a subtle and realistic way. Very, very nice!

The acting is superb. Bruce Willis has never disappointed me yet. When he is needed to show strength you see the inner strength. When he needed to be a vulnerable character you can see it in his eyes and the way he carries himself. Masterful work. Samuel L. Jackson plays his role as Elijah Price so well that you almost think Jackson himself is the infinitely frail. He also has a great presence and complexity that further makes him perfect for the role.

Like most of Shyamalan's other movies this one isn't action based, in spite of what the story is about. Unbreakable is, however, an excellent coming-of-super-age type story with one doozy of a surprise ending... an early Shyamalan trademark. If you absolutely, positively need lots of action in your films then you might as well pass this one. However you will miss out. Anybody who likes to see more depth in his or her heroes you won't see anything better on any superhero movie hands down. Don't deprive your mind of this brain food. It's a winner.

I don't really see a very compelling reason to get this Blu-Ray if you already own the two-disc Vista series DVD. The visuals don't seem like they have improved that much, but then again I didn't compare the two versions side by side. I won't say the picture isn't significantly better, but I will say it's not the kind of visual pop you would find on movies people use as high def references. Now the audio on the Blu-Ray is PCM 5.1 lossless and it's really nice. You get to hear a lot of subtle audio queues that may or may not be noticeable on the previous releases (again I didn't compare the two side by side).

The special features are a 100% rehash of the Vista series extras with absolutely nothing new to the table. This kinda dissapoints me, but in the end most of the time when they make a Blu-Ray exlusive featurette it sometimes tends to be throwaway content. Here's what you get:

Behind the Scenes - A documentary of interviews from the cast and crew. Not bad, but not groundbreaking.

Comic Books and Superheroes - A cool analysis of comic book heroes and villans. Shows that Samuel Jackson does have a love for the genre.

Deleted Scenes - There are some really cool scenes that were taken out and now you get to enjoy them. Some, of course, are obvious why they were taken out. My favorite is the weighlifting scene at the college gym.

The Train Station Sequence - Uses the multiple angles feature to switch between the movie and the storyboards. Not really interesting unless you plan to direct.

Night's First Fight Sequence - One a Shyamalan's home movies depicting the title sequence. Just shows the budding directory building his chops as a teen with a camcorder. Interesting bit of historic trivia, but nothing to write home about.

I didn't feel the Blu-Ray really stood out on the visual end, but it did look really good. I would have liked to have seen some more content on this release like maybe a director commentary, maybe an analytical retrospective. Something new. If you already have the Vista series DVD I can't say with 100% certainty this is the one to get. I keep wondering if a new and improved Blu-Ray release will come down the pike with more features or maybe a director's cut adding some of those deleted scenes into a longer movie. If you don't have the Vista series DVD then your choice is easier as you get all the special features plus the improved visuals (likely) and audio (definitely).",1247443200,2,4475,4.560398505603985
1292675,5,B00003CXQA,"This is a much better film than I ever thought it would be, and intrigues me every time I watch it (which is 4 times, so far).  Samuel L. Jackson's role is what mainly inspires me to watch this multiple times. His character is amazing and just leaves me shaking my head.

This is a pretty low-key movie with the other star, Bruce Willis, playing an extremely subdued character, almost too subdued. There are times in here when you keep waiting for him to say something, and he says nothing. Half the time he's barely audible.

But he and Jackson play off each other well, and this is very suspenseful film, even if a lot doesn't happen. To explain the story would almost ruin it, because it's preposterous. I'll just call it an interesting fantasy-horror film with a little family story tied in with Willis' wife (Robin Wright) and young boy (Spencer Treat Clark).

""Unbreakable"" is beautifully filmed, has very little profanity in it, and a strange, strange story with a great twist at the end....one of the best I've ever seen in a movie. If you're open to try something different, give it a look.",1245110400,,1099,4.591836734693878
1292676,5,B00003CXQA,"What I liked: takes place in Philadelphia, where I grew up; Bruce Willis does a fabulous job with the drama; Samuel L. Jackons convinces you he's nuts; I like the deliberate, contemplative scenes.  I'm not always in a hurry, sometimes I like to linger a bit and let the story unfold.  This is a great movie for those times.  It is a ""dark"" movie.  Not an action movie, and it was poorly marketed.  You aren't made to feel like you're watching Superman or Spiderman, but an ordinary guy, with faults (family problems), and frailties.  As you watch the film, you watch him discover who he is.  I liked Robin Wright's portrayal of his wife, but wish we saw more of her.

The scene with the main character as the only survivor to the train wreck, and him lifting all the weights he has - loved those and the way the tension builds.

This one's definitely worthy of a home in my DVD collection.",1244764800,,889,4.404907975460123

1292679,5,B00003CXQA,"I didn't see Unbreakable in the theatre. In fact, I don't remember when I saw it. I didn't see trailers on anything. I believe I bought the DVD a few years ago..mostly because I was buying any DVD that caught my interest. But with each time I see it...about half a dozen times...it just seems better and better. Unbreakable is now my favorite all time movie.

If I had written a review when I saw it...I probably would have given it a 3.5 stars. Why? Because I knew it enjoyed it...but I didn't truly ""get it""...in fact...that underlies the greatness of this film...it is the type of movie that you absorb. It is subtle. Unbreakable doesn't hit you with a sledgehammer. In fact, it wasn't until I began to read the over reviewers...that I understood it is a ""super hero"" movie. I certainly didn't know it was the first of a possible trilogy (I wonder now some 9 yrs later if it will happen) Why? When I saw the movie...I just got caught up in the story of a man discovering who he is...and his purpose in life. I loved the reality of this movie. For example, I loved how ""David""...after trying to pick up the player agent...slips his wedding band back on his finger. EVERYMAN is right.

I keep watching it to pick up more things I missed before. I long for more because there are so many questions. For instance, I wonder just how strong Bruce Willis's character ""David Dunn"" really is? And what would happen if he was shot? Due to the incredible ending...I wonder if David's superhero career ends before it even really gets started.

If you give this movie a chance, you may also be blown away by how great it is. I believe it is Night's best movie.

Tonally, Unbreakable is excellent, although it does move slowly at times.  This show let me know that M. Night was not a fluke.  After seeing it, I was a Shyamalan fan.

The 2-Disc DVD has a lot of great extras, including some cool artwork.  The best part is Shyamalan's directing.  The movie feels like you are in a comic book.

1292682,5,B00003CXQA,"If you saw the sixth sense you absolutely had to see this film when it came out,only for the fact that it was written and directed by the same guy M Knight, I was blown away by the story and the wonderful talents of both Bruce Willis and Samuel l. Jackson.

Bruce is your everyday guy with your everyday job trying to work with your everyday problems,I bet that a lot of guys saw themselves in him, when just out of nowhere Samuel helps him discover who he really is, this discovery evolves slowly as the movie progresses in a way that was brilliant building up to the ultimate shock at the end,the person who made him realize who he really is... was his opposite.

You kind of feel the comic world entering the pace slowly and it dominates at the end, kind of like your comic movies with one exception...you can actually feel that these guys are real,from the real world!! they don't fly or wear weird costumes or expand in size, they're just your everyday people.

The overall mood of the movie is fascinating, it takes you to through mood swings (good ones) and it makes you look at the story from different views.

I can't even start on the score of this movie (James Newton Howard) brilliant just brilliant.. when Bruce enters the subway wearing his security poncho accompanied by the soundtrack that was the best scene in the entire movie

This movie is one of my all time favourites. It is the best of M knight's movies yet. (I've seen everyone of them)

The blu-ray release made it even better.

1292760,5,B00003CXQA,"Willis is a very sad/dark/distraught man who quickly becomes the sole survivor of a fatal train wreck, ironically not only does he survive but he is unhurt in any way.

In comes Jackson whose character is looking for something, particular clues and circumstances which leads him to Willis ...and if he's right Willis's character will be in store for yet many more mind shattering rides that only he himself can discover through encouragement by Jackson.

I was intrigued by this movie's story and message... very comic book(ish) in framing style and its telling but in a deranged way makes a very ""real life"" clear point. There is always the very best and the very worst in life... such as strong/weak, rich/poor, smart/dumb, beautiful/ugly, sick/healthy, sane/insane, etc...

Life isn't perfect yet it does seem to be in a sort of balance.

I'm a believer in this way of thinking so this was for me a very good movie to watch and then ponder.

Top notch movie... a must see!!!",1226102400,2,977,4.791666666666667
1292761,4,B00003CXQA,"M. Night Shyamalan's Unbreakable is very rare class of superhero film, trying to be incredibly logical, while also having plenty of absurd moments.  This is okay, sense the director's other films have also followed a similar formula... But, typically with his films you find yourself taken away by the emotional drama and characters, and the films move along so quickly you never really get a chance to stop and question the logic behind the events, because if you had the chance to question it you'd realize how ridiculous the entire situation is.

We are introduced to the story with an awkward man by the name of David Dunn (Bruce Willis), a security guard, who seems to have some serious issues in regards to being social, and communicating.  While on his way back to New York he winds up being the only man to survive a colossal train crash (the other is seen dying from substantial injuries, giving us a wonderful shot of Willis being counseled by the doctor as you slowly see a flailing sheet soak in blood).  He emerges from this crash completely unharmed, which leads to speculation and confusion from doctors, and the media.  Soon after he is given a letter from an art gallery, which displays comic book art entitled ""Limited Edition"".  There he meets the owner, Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson), a man who has suffered from multiple injuries as a result of weak bones, making kids call him ""Mister Glass"".  Since he spent one third of his life in the hospital he has read many comic books, and takes them to a serious level of philosophy and sub textual meanings, and he believes David to be a real life hero.  To Elijah, comics aren't children's tales about men in brightly colored outfits fighting menacing beings of evil seeking the destruction of good, but as one of mankind's most important visual arts.

As the plot moves on the evidence of ""truth behind the panels"" become clear to David and Elijah, though David doesn't want to accept this, for the already strained relationship between his wife and son has only just started to mend itself after the train crash.  The audience can tell that this will ultimately end with David accepting the truth and mending relations with his family, and they can also anticipate the typical Syamalan twist ending.

Yes, this is a drama with a concept that is hard to take seriously, but Willis and Jackson do take it seriously and that's all that really matters in a movie like Unbreakable, where acting can be the saving grace of the plot's weaknesses.  The two leading actors' performances are worth noting, as is the director's keen attention to details, and sense of visual style.  The music score is at times rather slow, not really capturing the right emotion for the events taking place on screen and that lessens the power of the film.  The twist at the end will probably be anticipated by most moviegoers, or comic book readers, but it isn't as simple as the twist in films such as The Village (Honestly, shame on you if you didn't see that one coming).  This film isn't as good as `Signs', or `The Sixth Sense', but fans of Shymalan's other films will certainly accept this one with arms open wide.

The best parts for me (as a writer, and a comic reader) came from Samuel L. Jackson's character, Elijah Price.  When he got in character and talked about how grand and important the story-telling history behind comic books I felt completely attached to the character.  I grew attached in these moments because I do believe comics are much more than simple stories to amuse children.  They are a very important way of communication, and have been for centuries.  Struggles of good versus evil, right and wrong, they have modeled lots of our cultural traits, whether we believe it or not.  These, philosophical speeches he gives describing comics, and the art styles characters are drawn in captures the truth behind comics, and I hope if anything people can come out of seeing this film with a greater respect for this age old genre of story-telling.

Unbreakable does suffer several problems, which is why the highest rating I can bring myself to give it is four stars.  The main problems, for me, are found in the musical score and the pace of certain scenes.  At times this film is incredibly...well boring.  By boring I do not me it lacks action (you shouldn't expect much adrenaline pumping action in ANY of Shyamalan's films, because he lacks a visual style suited for action), but as in some scenes just don't have any compelling force to catch the audience's attention.  The music, as I said is slow, and I feel it could've really improved these slow scenes if it would've had the musical score that caught your attention, not as in loud and obnoxious, but subtle and mysterious, because for me this film was a supernatural mystery tale, so I think the score should've been more mysterious, dark, and forbidding.

Unbreakable is not as good as `Signs' or `The Sixth Sense' (my personal opinion, so don't get testy if you disagree), but if you DID enjoy those two previously listed films you'll probably enjoy Unbreakable.  If you only liked `Signs' and `The Sixth Sense' because of their suspense, sci-fi, supernatural, and horror aspects, well, you need to realize Unbreakable is a totally different supernatural-drama, so you might want to ignore this one if you don't want to see a superhero film where the ""Hero"" only takes up the task of fighting evil in the last twenty minutes of the film.  If you watch Shymalan's films because of their style, and emotion, than hop aboard, sit back, relax, and enjoy Unbreakable for what it is.

Shaky, but manages to squeeze out a 4/5 from me due to all the things it did RIGHT, and for the performances by Samuel L. Jackson and Bruce Willis",1224633600,,5758,4.723276723276723

The only way a man as big, strong and healthy looking could convince me he had O.I. is if he was one of those rare actors who could inhabit the role and become the fragile person the character was meant to be. I have not known many actors who could convincingly become that which they most certainly are not. It is a rare talent. I once had an acting instructor, 20 something at the time, with no make up, costume or props, he transformed himself into a little old man, before the entire class. That is a rare talent.

1292846,4,B00003CXQA,"Hit show ""Heroes"" became a big hit with the premise ""what if ordinary people found that they had superpowers?"" B

ut they weren't the first to use that -- M. Night Shyamalan tackled in in ""Unbreakable,"" an intensely geeky, eerie thriller about a man who discovers that he is a superhuman. It's full of solid acting and writing, but has a big fat letdown of an ending.

A train derails, killing everyone on board -- except everyman David Dunn (Bruce Willis), who survives without a scratch. As he tries to deal with this, he is contacted by crippled comic book dealer Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson), whose ""glass"" bones made him speculate: what if there were people at the opposite end of the spectrum -- real superheroes with great strength and powers, REAL ""men of steel""?

Realizing that he has never been sick or endangered (except when exposed to water), David begins to explore his newly-discovered strength and second sight, despite the harm it does to his fragile marriage, even saving others from criminals. But there's a sinister side to his discovery and the accident that caused him to explore his powers...

""Superhero movie"" usually makes you think of loads of colourful action and young hunky heroes. But Shyamalan takes the opposite approach -- a middle-aged Everyman hero with wife and kid, and the movie is cloaked in shadowy camerawork, not much action at all and eerie, overquiet dialogue. Still it's very geeky, and very intelligent.

Instead of action, ""Unbreakable"" devotes itself to the mythic qualities of superheroes, and David's slow awakening to his own abilities. Rather than his usual suspense, Shyamalan uses atmosphere to keep the plot captivating, giving it the feeling of a creepy intense dream. And since every superhero has to fight the baddies, he weaves in some tightly-choreographed, grimy fight sequences as David finally makes use of his superstrength.

So what's the problem? Quite simply, the ending is a huge letdown -- while rationally it makes sense, David's actions at the climax leave you feeling, ""That's it? That's all the 'unbreakable man' is going to do? What the?"" And somehow it feels odd that a ""supervillain"" wouldn't really have any superabilities (or compensation for them) himself. Slight stumble there.

Bruce Willis gives an excellent, understated performance as David, who longs for an indefinable something in his life, and slowly grows to realize that he is ""unbreakable."" Nice ordinary guy who turns out to be very extraordinary. But Jackson is even better as Elijah Price -- intense, passionate, and somewhat detached from the real world. His powerful personality balances out his frail body.

Shyamalan goes into comic-book geek mode in in ""Unbreakable,"" a slow-moving, suspenseful movie about a hero's awakening... that only stumbles in the final scenes.",1198972800,3,2823,5.121739130434783

Willis and Jackson are great in this - Jackson seemingly born for the role and the creepy edge he brings to the part.  A worthy addition to your library and one that must be watched with your son (providing you follow with some discussion on the differences in good and evil).",1196467200,,519,4.385416666666667
1292921,3,B00003CXQA,"In my memory this was a five star movie, but after watching it last night, it's really only a 3 star movie to me.

It's dark, almost in a Hitchcock way. The lighting is dark, the music is mostly dark and creepy, there's almost always a sense of foreboding. I think I only saw Bruce Willis smile twice. But Willis was believable and it was interesting to watch his development into a sort of superhero.

Samuel L. Jackson has an interesting monologue about how comic books are a type of historical record that I enjoyed. I hadn't ever thought of comic books in that fashion. Beyond that Jackson is a sometimes creepy, sometimes sad character, but a very important one.

A friend of mine that is a comic book collector went nuts over this movie, and the ending is pretty awesome, but I don't want to ruin it. It was just a little dark for my taste.",1196121600,,846,4.375796178343949
1292922,5,B00003CXQA,I like the movie but I don't like that Amazon.com didn't list Bruce Willis as one of the actors. As a main chractor he should have been listed first and isn't listed at all.

1292923,1,B00003CXQA,"I am afraid that Night Shyamalan is one of those one-hit wonders. The Sixth Sense was fantastic, but every movie since then has been a wash. This one, like all his recent endeavors, had a good basic premise, but under the weight of bad writing, bad directing, and a totally self-contradictory plot (how can the ""bad guy"" be criminally ""insane"" if the ""good guy"" actually IS a super hero?) it sank like a stone. The acting was stiff and unconvincing. Spencer Treat Clark had clearly been told to ""hesitate"" and, with the reliability of a robot, he did so on every sentence. Robin Wright Penn looked justifiably pained throughout the ordeal. And Bruce Willis was only slightly less paralyzed than Samuel L. Jackson. The fact that all of these actors can act quite well but didn't in this film, needs to be laid at the door of the director. Night, for your next film, consider outsourcing.",1193788800,3,886,4.685897435897436

1292925,5,B00003CXQA,"How does one classify this movie?  Some might call it a drama, as the slow pacing, muted emotions, lack of comedy, and modern, urban setting all fit the descriptions of many modern dramas.  Some might call it a fantasy; a reluctant superhero discovered by his arch-enemy who knows no bounds.  The former has strength beyond his knowledge, while the latter uses cunning to overcome his physical limitations.  Others might call it a suspense movie, as it has all the hallmarks of a classic suspense; good guys and bad guys are only sorted out at the end, and the audience discovers things as the protagonist does.  Maybe it is a combination of all three genres, another achievement from the M. Knight Shamalayan.

However one might classify this movie, it is an incredible piece of story-telling.  Its as if Shamalayan wrote a traditional fairy tale, set it in a modern American city, and then reversed all the normal rules of fairy tales.  First of, the premise of superhero ignorant of his own destiny is a common starting point; think of Harry Potter, X-Men, and Frodo Baggins in Lord of the Rings.  But the heroes in these stories are all young, at the beginning of their lives.  Bruce Willis's character here, David, is old, past middle age most likely, and looking back on his glory years.  Second, heroes needs to be revealed unintentionally, through accident or fate.  David is discovered by both accident and fate.  Accident put him on a train, but fate assured him to survive.  Third, each hero needs a weakness.  Superman had kryptonite, Batman had his past and Spiderman has his loved ones.  But water, who would ever imagine water to be the one weakness of David?  Last, all heroes need an antagonist, that villian they must stop.  But here, it is the villian who seeks out the hero, helps him find his power, and finally, guarantees the hero's victory by sealing his own doom.

Overall, this was a great movie.  For the budget it was made one, with the cast it starred, it delivers a great story with heart and soul.  Its setting is modern, yet the storyline is more mythical than anything else.  The conceptual background of comicbooks contrasts nicely with the plot itself.  I highly recommend this movie.",1184457600,2,2219,4.766404199475065
1292926,5,B00003CXQA,"Although Shyamalan's ""Sixth Sense"" perhaps had more chills and more of a classic twist-ending - I personally think ""Unbreakable"" is his best film. I'm not sure if you would call it's ending a ""twist,"" but it made me gasp when it suddenly brought a whole landscape of emotion into focus with an amazing depth of field.

Furthermore, this movie has one of the most interesting characters I've ever seen on screen. Samuel L. Jackson plays a precise and learned art dealer with a special affinity for original classic comic book drawings. His genetic affliction limits the physical activity he can engage in, but his imagination has always been free to entertain strange possibilities. This truly is an original portrayal that could never typecast Jackson. His role is not as romantic lead, not as supporting character actor, not as doctor, lawyer, merchant... It's what he is that in the end creates the shock of brilliant resolution.

This is a movie whose intricacies will haunt you long after the fact. And even if you never had any interest in comic books, you will probably walk away from `Unbreakable"" with a new respect for what Joseph Campbell might call their ""power of myth.""

One word about the availability of this film - I see a lot of the single-disc versions of it are available only in ""Region 2"" DVD format. You would need a ""Multi-Region"" or ""Universal"" DVD player to play these versions. As I understand it, all DVD players are manufactured with the capability of playing all DVDs. However, the players are then set by distributors to play in only one region, most often the US/Canada Region 1 - in order to block overseas bootlegging versions and other illicit overseas offerings.

There are on-line sites presumably listing decoding sequences that will allow you to ""unlock"" your specific DVD player so it will play all regions. However most people I've talked with have found these decoding sequences don't work. This can be frustrating because it seems an increasing number of English or foreign movies and comedy series are being offered only in non-Region 1 formats lately.

So if you want to buy one of the single-disc Region 2 versions of ""Unbreakable"" listed on this website, you might need to consider buying a ""Multi-Region"" DVD player on-line, or else you might want to go to an ethnic neighborhood (such as an East Indian community) in a large city to find a Multi-Region player.",1181606400,2,2408,4.8777506112469435
1292927,4,B00003CXQA,"Unbreakable is about the mythology behind comic book superheroes and the purposes that each of us have in life.  The film opens with the birth of a baby boy with all four of his limbs broken.  He is Elijah Price, who is played by Samuel L. Jackson, and he has type I OI or brittle bone disease.  As his life goes on, he gets the nickname of ""Mr. Glass"" as up the point of present time in Unbreakable, Elijah had broken bones in his body 57 times.  Elijah is motivated early on to socialize in some capacity by his mother and his primary interest becomes comic books.  As he gets older he soon begins to question what the reason is for his own existence and comes to the conclusion that if people like him exist with his weakness, then surely there must be someone on the other end of the spectrum with massive strengths.  Elijah believes there is nothing scarier than to live life without knowing your purpose and he makes the assertion that there are in fact real-life superheroes.

Bruce Willis plays David Dunn, a security officer, who, unlike Elijah, is trying to find his own purpose in life.  He gave up his football career for his wife but now his marriage is falling apart.  David survives a train wreck that kills 131 people, and he is the only survivor.  He was completely unharmed.  Elijah believes David to be a real superhero and gradually confronts David with his theory.  David's son Joseph believes Elijah and assists David in finding out more about his potential powers. Just to add, I'm of the opinion that it is an absolute pleasure to watch Willis and Jackson act in pretty much anything.

As with any M. Night Shyamalan film, giving too much away is hugely detrimental to the experience and please know that this film is entirely worth going into with no more information then I have already provided.  What Shyamalan has done here in retrospect, while considering the recent onslaught of big-budget comic book movies, is create a completely unconventional yet convincing adaptation of comic book heroes' origins. At the same time Unbreakable celebrates the mythology behind these fictional characters.  It takes a profound imagination to come up with a screenplay that gives this concept the treatment that Shyamalan has.  It is the kind of concept that might have taken almost a lifetime of brainstorming.

A friend of mine once said that the Sixth Sense was a gigantic and nearly perfect movie for absolutely everyone, while as a comic book fan Unbreakable was tailored made perfectly for him.  Though I'm half the comic book fan he is, I concur with that assessment enough to confidently invoke it hear.  If you truly love comic books, Unbreakable is your film.  If you are not a lover of comic books, then try to walk into this film expecting little action and you shouldn't be disappointed.

It can be argued that Shyamalan has lost his way in recent years, although he does retain his technical prowess even now.  Nevertheless, Unbreakable is still a joy to watch and is a shining example of Shyamalan during his most inspired and generative phase.",1181001600,40,3076,4.7209737827715355
1292928,2,B00003CXQA,"Ah yes, here we have another example of the ""genius"" of M. Night Shyamalan, the writer/director with the uncanny ability to take a silly, fantastical story and transform it into a film that is - well, silly and fantastical.  And patronizing, as well.  The Sixth Sense was a great movie, but viewings of Lady in the Water and Unbreakable have me convinced that Shyamalan is the most overrated filmmaker to come along in years.  Unbreakable is just a bad movie, pure and simple, but what makes it ever so much agonizingly more unbearable is Shyamalan's ""holier than thou"" approach to filmmaking.  He can't put together a single scene without going all artsy-fartsy on us, as if his films are just too important for anything resembling normal cinematic techniques.  He gives us panoramic views of characters for no apparent reason, overdramatizes even the most mundane of scenes by showing the film in  time (actually, knowing Shyamalan, it's probably something like 0.7893834343 time), and oftentimes foregoes the use of background music in his far too numerous ""let's just pause right here for about five minutes"" character shots.  Thus it is that Unbreakable, a film largely inspired by comic books, is presented as if it's a cinematic masterpiece of life-changing proportions.  Well, it isn't.

Here's the down and dirty description of Unbreakable.  Bruce Willis plays David Dunn, a seemingly ordinary guy who just so happens to walk away unscathed from a train wreck that killed everyone else on board.  Soon thereafter, he is covertly contacted by Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson), an avowed comic book collector and dealer in comic ""art"" who tries to tell him he's some kind of modern-day superhero.  Apparently, Elijah, who was born with a defect that made his bones incredibly brittle and easy to break, has spent all of his adult life seeking a real-life comic book superhero.  David blows the guy off but soon begins thinking back on his life.  The first thing he does is to try and figure out if he has ever been sick or injured.  Now you would think any sane person could answer that question himself - if you've ever been really sick, you're going to remember it, and if you've never been sick or injured over the course of multiple decades, you're going to have picked up on that fact at some point long ago.  Eventually, Elijah gets under David's skin, which leads us up to the film's final scenes.  These crucial moments in the film ought to generate cinematic fireworks, but they don't.  I looked for some excitement, and there was just none to be found.

As I've indicated, I thought the storyline was pretty silly (but not as silly as that of Lady in the Water), but an equally serious problem is the lack of any chemistry whatsoever between any of the main characters, especially David and his wife and son.  Apparently, I was supposed to care about the fate of their troubled marriage - but I didn't.  I didn't even care if David lived or died, to tell you the truth.  And his son was just annoying.  Now, you do get the vintage Shyamalan twist at the very end, but the effort required to sit through this movie all the way to the end greatly exceeds the payoff of that ""surprise.""  I haven't seen all of Shyamalan's films yet, so maybe there is still some hope for him, but the evidence is definitely mounting that The Sixth Sense was a one-hit wonder for this filmmaker.",1179273600,5,3391,4.737649063032368

1292981,4,B00003CXQA,"Currently hit show ""Heroes"" is riding high with the premise ""what if ordinary people found that they had superpowers?"" But they weren't the first to use that -- M. Night Shyamalan tackled in in ""Unbreakable,"" an eerie thriller full of solid acting and writing, but a big fat letdown of an ending.

A train derails, killing everyone on board -- except everyman David Dunn (Bruce Willis), who survives without a scratch. As he tries to deal with this, he is contacted by crippled comic book dealer Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson), whose ""glass"" bones made him speculate: what if there were people at the opposite end of the spectrum -- real superheroes with great strength and powers, REAL ""men of steel""?

Realizing that he has never been sick or endangered (except when exposed to water), David begins to explore his newly-discovered strength and second sight, despite the harm it does to his fragile marriage, even saving others from criminals. But there's a sinister side to his discovery and the accident that caused him to explore his powers...

""Superhero movie"" usually makes you think of loads of colourful action and young hunky heroes. But Shyamalan takes the opposite approach --  a middle-aged Everyman hero with wife and kid, and the movie is cloaked in shadowy camerawork, not much action at all and eerie, overquiet dialogue. Still it's very geeky, and very intelligent.

Instead of action, ""Unbreakable"" devotes itself to the mythic qualities of superheroes, and David's slow awakening to his own abilities. Rather than his usual suspense, Shyamalan uses atmosphere to keep the plot captivating, giving it the feeling of a creepy intense dream. And since every superhero has to fight the baddies, he weaves in some tightly-choreographed, grimy fight sequences as David finally makes use of his superstrength.

So what's the problem? Quite simply, the ending is a huge letdown -- while rationally it makes sense, David's actions at the climax leave you feeling, ""That's it? That's all the 'unbreakable man' is going to do?"" And somehow it feels odd that a ""supervillain"" wouldn't really have any superabilities (or compensation for them) himself.

Bruce Willis gives an excellent, understated performance as David, who longs for an indefinable something in his life, and slowly grows to realize that he is ""unbreakable."" But Jackson is even better as Elijah Price -- intense, passionate, and somewhat detached from the real world. His powerful personality balances out his frail body.

Shyamalan goes into comic-book geek mode in in ""Unbreakable,"" a slow-moving, suspenseful movie about a hero's awakening... that only stumbles in the final scenes.",1177200000,3,2663,5.176744186046512
1292982,5,B00003CXQA,"In this film, Bruce Willis plays David, a man who's less than satisfied with his current life situation, but can't understand why.  As a result of a train wreck that he remarkably emerges from completely unscathed, he meets Elijah, played by Samuel Jackson, a man with a congenital disease that makes his bones extremely brittle and has led a very difficult life as a result.

Elijah has been an avid comic book reader for most of his life, and proposes an unusual theory to David.  What if comic books were exaggerations of actual events?  What if there were people that are more than ordinary and don't even know it?  Elijah, who is on one extreme of the spectrum, is very weak and frail, which makes it very noticeable when compared to ordinary people.  He believes that there are people at the other end of the spectrum that can't be hurt and don't get sick, and that David is such a person.  Elijah supposes that David is a modern hero, and that the reason he feels unsatisfied and empty is that he is not living his life to his potential by seeking out evil and stopping it.

This is the type of movie that revitalizes hope in mankind.  Maybe there really are extraordinary people among us that are genuinely good at heart and strive to help others.

As M. Night Shayamalan tends to do, the ending has a bit of a twist.  While I won't divulge details, I will say that it isn't a necessarily happy ending.  Some people don't like it; personally, I find the ending very moving and satisfying, and could not imagine an ending that fit better into the storyline.",1174694400,2,1564,4.50709219858156
1292983,5,B00003CXQA,"I love this movie and is one of my favorites.  I love the slow pacing and the thought of a ""superhero"" story set in the real world. A real story with real world sensibilities and pacing.  True thoughts and action as a real person trying to understand that he might be extraordinary. The main character's young son being the one to push his father to believe in that possibility of something that seems to an adult mind as impossible.  I Love the character that Bruce Willis plays, he a normal guy that fell into those cracks of getting caught up in a dead end job, loosing passion for his relationship and his life in general, something I myself and others can relate to. You see him going though the motions of his Job, his relationship with his wife that is on the ropes and neither one being overly concerned about it.  Even his relationship with his son is missing something.  Then the possibility of something more and following ""your calling"".  Being presented something more, the idea your life has more meaning and getting obsessed with knowing the truth, is there more to my life then this.  That's the feeling that resonates throughout this film, figuring out your place in the world and not fighting it, but embracing your true calling.

The Character that Samuel L. Jackson is one of his best roles in recent memory.  What a great character, someone you feel sorry for that is suppose to be the someone you root for, someone you care about. You understand why he does what he does, he wants to also figure out why he is what he is and his place in this world.  M. Night takes tradition comic book ideas and situations and transforms them for the real world but it's still just like a comic book heroes origin story. The Robin Wright Penn Character is also full of depth, she has her fears and those fears enable the feeling of something missing.  Sometimes it's not the relationship, it's the people in it that are lost, once they find themselves the relationship fixes itself. I like seeing these two people whom truly love one another that just hit that wall and have to move on but really have no idea where it all went wrong.

I love comic books and super heroes, but here is a hero that is strong but not lifting cars, indestructible but not having bullets bounce off his eye ball, more of a real world superhero.  I so want to know what happens after this movie and how this character develops.  This movie was a pre curser to all these other superhero stories in film and the hit TV show ""Heroes"" that is about normal people figuring out they have powers, this one is done more practically.  I never thought that someone could do a movie and make a super hero and villain 100% believable.  this movie did it for me.  Even the climax fit with what M. Night was trying to say about this character, he's not a brawler, a Martial arts expert, and mentally he's not that tough...yet.  He's just a regular guy that has irregular attributes, nothing more, nothing less. Perhaps one day he'll be this grand heroic figure, but not today, today he's just a normal man trying to coupe, and handle these new ablities and respectabilities.

I also love the cinematography and the subtle pallet changes.  Most of the colors dealing with Bruce Willies characters are dull and muted, the further we get in the film and the more emotion and passion are conveyed, the more the pallet gets richer and the tones get bolder.  Just look at the restaurant scene 3/4 the way in the movie, there is emotion and passion starting to drive these characters again and the walls of the restaurant is full of color, the clothes are more colorful compared to these same characters at the beginning of the film, they have nothing but dull clothes and surroundings, just like there emotional state.  Look at the rain coat/cloak of the main character.  look at it the first time he has it on and compare it to the last. All these small elements help the emotion and heightened the senses of the viewer without the viewer even knowing it.  If your not engrossed into the film it will be irrelevant. These things are small and it's easy to over due and hit you in the face with it, M.Night tried to go with the less is more approach that flows though out this film and stays true to the story, this movie is not batman nor is it the Matrix it is a true film with something to say.

Some people don't like these type of character driven stories, where much of the movie is slow paced and learning everything about these characters. At first glad every character in this movie is dull and sedated even, barely showing any emotion. It's almost like they have issues that they just don't want on the surface.  By the end of the movie you see, the Mother, Father, Child and Father's Friend all have there emotional ""awakening"" and show some true passion for what is real.  It takes guts for a film maker to rely on the actors performance so much, it worked here and the Sixth Sense, didn't in his recent films. The way it is shot is contrary from every other film that is shot today.  Single set up and long takes with no cuts, and mountains of dialog.  Most movies today have so many cuts to keep the ADD audience from getting bored, but this movie has the confidence in that the characters and story will keep you engrossed.  I love characters.  You live and die by it i guess but I really cared what happened in his Marriage, with his son and his budding relationship with Elijah.  i didn't need some big action scene to justify me watching and enjoying every aspect of this movie.

Under rated film in my opinion but i also realize these type of stories are not for everyone.  Most people who don't like the story or the ending want that big scene and would I guess be justified to see David do something truly superhuman, but this movie was about the unsaid things, the unseen thing, the feelings and emotion.  this movie was not about action of violence, it's about finding your calling.  It took artistic restraint and discipline to end the movie in the fashion that it did.  it makes it true to the message of the story.  this was the first chapter in the characters life, the action happens from this point on, and if you want that there are plenty of movies that deal with that. Most movies have this story in the first act, how cool to explore just this part of a hero story.",1174521600,3,6363,4.46286701208981

It quietly advances leaving you wondering where the impact is going to be, then you see it and it is significant, interesting, and sometimes intense.

1292989,5,B00003CXQA,"First, I truely believe this movie has very little to do with comic books except as a metaphor for self-discovery.  Second, this is probably the best movie I have ever seen that deals with a man's loss sense of self (AKA mid-life crisis).

He tries to juice up his life a bit early on in the movie in a failed pick up attempt on the train he will untimately be the lone survivor of.

M. Night (as we all know by now)searches for the spirituality that binds us together.  This is a story for what happens to a man when that spirituality is lost and later refound.

I love the combination of scenes when, after our hero saves the girls, who in turn save him, and then he commits himself to action by destroying the killer in the house.

1293049,4,B00003CXQA,"I don't understand why ""Unbreakable"", M. Night Shymalan's second film is not more widely praised. ""The Sixth Sense"" is a hard act to follow, but ""Unbreakable"" is a remarkably good film and one of my favorites.

If you look at the career of Shyamalan, the similarities to the career of Orson Welles are remarkable. Each started off with a bang, creating truly memorable films. Granted, ""The Sixth Sense"" is no ""Citizen Kane"", but both are remarkable in their own rites. Then each made a second film which was good, but flawed. In Welles case, this may have been the result of studio tampering. After that, each subsequent film has been less successful, less interesting, and less memorable. Welles will always be remembered for his masterful first film, and some flawed but interesting work throughout his career, ""The Lady from Shanghai"" stands out as a good example. It is far too early to tell if Shyamalan will suffer the same fate, but after the disastrous ""The Village"" and the mediocre ""Lady in the Water"", it doesn't look promising for the former wunderkind.

David Dunn (Bruce Willis), a security guard at a college football stadium in Philadelphia, travels home from New York on the train. As he flirts with a woman and contemplates how well his interview went, he begins to notice something is wrong. Then the train crashes. David is the only survivor and he doesn't have a cut on him. His wife, Audrey (Robin Wright Penn) and son, Joseph (Spencer Treat Clark), are overjoyed to see him when he is released from the hospital. Soon, David receives an invitation from Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson), the owner of a rare comic book store called ""Limited Edition"", to come and visit. Elijah has a rare disease making his bones brittle. When he was born, his legs and arms were broken during delivery. Elijah is convinced that David has superpowers, but David is dubious. Soon, he begins to wonder and puts himself to various tests.

""Unbreakable"" is a very intelligent, well made movie about the myth of superheroes. I think the film may have been a little ahead of its time. Shortly after the film's release, Michael Chabon published ""The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay"" and suddenly there were many projects examining the origin of myth and superheroes, giving the ideas entertaining twists and fictionalized roots. So why didn't ""Unbreakable"" catch on? I'm not sure. Perhaps the film's approach is too cerebral, rooting everything too much in the real world. People may have been disappointed because David never really takes on a super hero persona. It happens in stages, in a more subtle way.

There are many layers to every character, giving them depth and interest, making it a joy to watch them. David is a minimum wage security guard struggling with his relationship with his wife and child. He is trying to get a better job, to make things easier for them, to ease the strain on the family. The train accident leaves him shell shocked, but he doesn't give it much thought. Then, when he meets Elijah, he naturally discounts the strange man's theories. But Elijah has many facets as well. He sells rare comic books and comic book art, something that kept him going through his lonely childhood. But he won't sell the prized possessions to just anyone. He is far too attached to the pieces for that, they have to be able to appreciate the work they are about to purchase. If he doesn't believe they will, he doesn't sell it. He is obsessed with all things `comic book'. As he grows older, he becomes convinced that there are real super heroes out in the world and scans newspaper stories and newscasts for stories about survivors. Then David appears, in his own hometown, and he is sure.

This is one of Bruce Willis' best performances to date. As David, he is a quiet man, unsure of his status in life at any point. Then, as he begins to question why he survived this train wreck, when no one else did, he becomes even more skeptical. As he deals with these questions, he still has to deal with the problems most people have; his strained relationship with his wife (they sleep in different rooms), his son, work, money and more. As he slowly becomes convinced of Elijah's theories, he sets small tasks for himself; he bench presses huge amounts of weight, as his son watches with admiration, he can see or sense things about people just by touching them, he looks for people to help. At one point, he decides the idea is just too ludicrous and completely discounts it, causing Joseph to become confused. Joseph is so sure his dad has superpowers that he sets a test of his own. This is a very emotional scene because everyone is scared. When Joseph presents the challenge, David is scared that he may just be a regular human and will die. So he yells at his son, his wife yells at their son, finally getting him to stop.

We meet Elijah, right after he is born, and learn of his condition. Later, as a young boy we learn of his loneliness. He doesn't like to go outside, to play, because he always breaks a bone and that causes him pain. Then, as an adult, Samuel L. Jackson takes over the role; walking with a glass cane, wearing predominantly purple clothes, Elijah is a memorable presence. At one point, he chases a man David stopped, to see if he is actually has an item that David saw, providing more evidence of the security guard's powers. Chasing the man, on his fragile legs, he trips and crashes down some stairs. In the next scene, David meets Elijah who is now in a wheelchair, his legs broken and immobilized to help them to heal. Elijah is even more determined to prove David has unusual powers, but David is even more reluctant. As the two characters continue to exchange ideas and thoughts, we realize there is something going on, below the surface that we can't quite identify. Something that is driving both of them.

Shyamalan does a masterful job with much of the film, letting scenes play out, letting them go to places we might not expect. There are many scenes involving David and his family and many may ask why it is necessary to have to watch this. Let's get to the superhero flying. These scenes add texture and back-story to the characters. Because we know David is having trouble with his family, we understand why he is reluctant to immediately jump into the role of superhero. He doesn't want any harm to come to them. Also, he is just learning about the whole thing, we are watching the birth of the character. As he deals with his job, we learn about events in his past, revealing a lifelong reticence to create or attract attention.

One particularly impressive scene happens late in the film. Almost convinced, David sets out to prove that he has some powers. With Elijah's guidance, he goes to Grand Central Station and walks slowly through the crowds of people. As he has just left work, and it is raining, he still wears his Security poncho, his cape. As he brushes against people, he is able to sense something about them; he is looking for someone to help, to save. One teenager participated in an assault, throwing a bottle at two African American couples from a passing car, injuring one of the women. Another college student took advantage of a drunken co-ed in his dorm and he now returns home to mom and dad. Then David finds him; brushing against a maintenance worker, he gets a vision of the man invading a home and causing all forms of havoc. This is David's test. He follows the man to his new home and quickly assesses the situation before setting about his task. This scene is masterful because it contains almost no dialogue, yet we always understand what is going on. It is also suspenseful and well done.

Perhaps even better, is the next scene in which David reveals to his son what happened the night before. Joseph starts to cry because he is both proud of his Dad and happy to see that he was right.

Shyamalan also introduces us to Elijah very early and lets us see some key moments in his life, developing the character even further. The obsession with comic books, his belief in human super heroes, and his disease will all make sense in the end.

All that said, the film is available as part of a two DVD set. The second DVD has a wealth of extras, including a documentary narrated by Samuel L. Jackson and many more standard extras hosted by the director, `making of' documentaries, creation of technical aspects, etc. But the packaging is some of the worst I have ever seen. The film is packaged in a cardboard sleeve, which is encased in a cardboard slip cover. Because of this, the box was partially smashed when I received it. Removing the plastic and the security tags yanked off a large chunk of the cover art. The security sticker was stuck directly to the cardboard and the cover art. The package is completely ruined because of this. This damage could've been avoided by using the regular plastic holders 99% of DVDs are packaged in.

""Unbreakable"" is a film I think about often. The performances are powerful, the story is interesting and believable and the production values are top notch. You should give it a try.",1156809600,4,9116,4.648263027295285
1293050,5,B00003CXQA,"M. Night Shyamalan's best film ,after ""THE SIXTH SENSE"".
Shyamalan  casted  Bruce Willis as the comic-book hero(his best choice) and Samuel L. Jackson as the villain :Mr. Glass. This film is touching, one of the greatest ,no doubt about it. It was awesome. M.Night Shyamalan is one of the best directors.
This film will be mentioned in future years and will be regarded as a classic.",1154649600,3,383,4.787878787878788
1293051,5,B00003CXQA,"Beings that M. Nights new movie 'Lady in the Water' is released today I decided to take a look at his previous films.  I've already reviewed 'The Sixth Sense' and anyone who knows me knows that I hold that film in the highest regard, as one of the best 'ghost' films for it's smart script and excellent direction, not to mention the chemistry between Haley and Bruce.  Now I have always been a diehard Willis fan so I was excited when I first saw 'Unbreakable'.  I was expecting another 'Sixth Sense' type vibe but what I recieved was something much different.  As everyone knows, I feel that Night has done no better than 'Sixth Sense' and I fear he never will BUT 'Unbreakable' is a very close second for many reasons.

First of all, the film is far from scary, but it has very dark tones.  The entire film is directed in dark lights with eeire music and the characters are haunted by the way their life is going.  Willis plays David Dunn a man whose struggling to make his life work.  He works as a security guard and is trapped in a marriage falling apart.  The opening scene has David on a train travelling home from a job interview and he is seated next to a beautiful woman.  Just watching his character remove his wedding band and then, almost awkwardly, proceed to put the moves on this woman says a lot.  You can see the state his character is in.

Moments later the news is on and Davids son Joseph (Spencer Treat Clark) realizes that the train his father was on has just crashed.  Come to find out his father is the sole survivor of that crash and he hasn't even suffered a scratch.  To everyone they shrug it off as coincidence, even Davids wife (played brilliantly by Robin Wright Penn) but as time passes and a strange man (Samuel L. Jackson) who believes that David may in fact be a superhero.

This may sound far fetched, but come on, if we'll go see 'X-Men' or 'Superman Returns' then we can get with the program.  This is just a superhero movie for adults.  But here's what makes this movie so great to me.  This is not about being a superhero as much as it is about becomeing a superhero.  This film revolves around a man not sure of who he is or what he is for that matter and his unwillingness to believe he's more than normal, but once he does realize then it all starts to make sense...for David it all starts to make sense.

You'll see that once he starts to take responsibility for himself, knowing what he needs to do and doing something about it his whole life takes a turn for the better.  This is going on the theme that many of us are unhappy with our lives because we're unhappy or unsure of ourselves.  Once David realized who he was he knew he had purpose...much greater purpose than to be a security guard who once had dreams of something greater (we see in flashbacks that David had dreams to once be a pro-football player but due to an injury...wink/wink...he gave it all up).  Knowing he had a place made him whole, made him happy, and made him see that what he had was what he wanted.

The entire cast is superb, Willis especially, and the story and direction is Shyamalan at his best.  Yes, since 'The Sixth Sense' Night has slipped from a lot of people's lists and has somewhat become concidered a dissapointment (I think this is mostly due to poor advertising), but when looked at properly he really is a magnificent storyteller.  The final frames will leave you breathless and will send shockwaves down your spine.  I feel it's a brilliant film with a universal message we can all appreciate and understand.",1153440000,2,3550,4.421538461538462
1293052,1,B00003CXQA,"Having liked ""Sixth Sense"" very much, I was hoping to see another good movie from the same director. Sadly, this was not the case. I like science fiction, I like movies about the supernatural, I like mysteries, and I love comic books. I also appreciate thoughtful and thought-provoking explorations of racial issues. This movie had a lot of potential but instead just made a silly muddle out of everything.",1153094400,7,406,4.898550724637682
1293053,5,B00003CXQA,"If we push the limits of the possible, which is a key theme of the movie, who knows what this will unleash in ourselves. An intentionally understated Bruce Willis and overstated Samuel L. Jackson explore the Superman as Everyman theme.  Another key theme, is the exploration of good and evil, in terms of means and ends, which is presented in many very interesting scenes. (If a student needs a movie with meat on it, to write a review, this is definitely one to pick). The movie builds to a very suspenseful conclusion, and then to an extraordinary coda. So, don't wander off before the movie is finished. Stay with it, and the movie will definitely stay with you.",1152921600,,665,4.635593220338983
1293054,4,B00003CXQA,"In the aftermath of a terrible train wreck, a man finds himself with nary a scratch in the midst of all the devastation, the corpses and the detritus. The only survivor, this seemingly ordinary man David Dunn (Bruce Willis), living a crumbling marriage and working mundanely as a security guard, comes to realize that he is very different from other people. He has never been hurt in his life, has never even had a cold. He meets an intense, strange, brittle-boned man, Elijah Price (Samuel Jackson), who informs him that superheroes have always existed in one guise or another, and that David is one such - that David is, in fact, an archetype. David undergoes a  journey of self-discovery as he strives to challenge the limits of his powers, and figure out where he fits in, in a world that has become suddenly eschewed. But Elijah Price also sees himself as an archetype, and not that of a superhero...and that the roles of superhero and -villain must be played out.

M. Night Shyamalan unveils his love for the genre with the film's implementation of his very heady concept: what if superheroes walked the earth? Unbreakable plumbs the comic book mythology and delves into the pop psychology of the superhero phenomenon. M. Night's conceit is that the archetypes of the Hero and the Villain have always been around, but now have been channeled into contemporary comic book superhero sensibilities. Shyamalan has his ""superhero"" follow the classic pattern as David Dunn runs the gamut of shocking discovery, the search for existential meaning, the quest for his rightful place in the world and finally, his acceptance of his unique seemingly pre-determined role. In the climactic scenes, David's shapeless poncho somewhat becomes a symbol of this acceptance, becoming, in fact, his superhero costume.

The dependable Bruce Willis invests his role with his trademark, career-making everyday man persona and brings home a sense that, yes, this is how a Regular Joe would react to such unusual circumstances. I always relish when he takes the minimalist road as his acting choice (though his mouthy and brash Moonlighting and Blind Date persona is also fun). Either way, he's believable. Samuel Jackson's assured Elijah provides a very good foil for Willis's stoic David. The ever cool Jackson can be relied on to always bring in the noise, the funk and the bravado. Robin Wright Penn's character is nicely miserable but hopeful and should've been more involved in the proceedings. And, while I understand Shyamalan's need to inject a kid character into the story - to symbolize and convey the innocence and wonder of the comic book theme - the kid actor he finds ends up being cloying and annoying.

Good or bad, Shyamalan goes the gloom and doom route. There is a sense of prevailing glumness to Unbreakable, a certain somberness to the music, a moroseness to the look and the atmosphere of the film. It infects David's dreary, humdrum life and his on-the-outs relationship with his wife. The pace is plodding, the action pieces far apart. In the special features, M. Night mentions that he had originally conceptualized the film in three stages: David's discovery of his inhuman abilities, his  several encounters with sundry crooks and villains, and, finally, his mega face-off with a worthy supervillain. But M. Night admits he didn't ""feel"" the last two segments and altered the storyline to this more bleak version. Shyamalan is earnest in his writing and directing effort but *sigh* I wish he'd found a happy medium between his original concept and the version with which he ended. He shoots for the grandiose moments and almost, almost gets there. But not quite. Still, I admire his sincerity and great effort and I was entertained enough to recommend this film: 3 and a half stars.

Unbreakable's special features include:

 - Additional scenes with an intro by M. Night.
 - An in-depth ""Behind the Scenes"" feature.
 - ""Comic Books and Superheroes"" - a fascinating feature delving into the superhero/comic book mythos with avid fan Sam Jackson, the great Will Eisner, Scott McCloud, Alex Ross, Denny O'Neil, Michael Chabon and Frank Miller (Eisner talks about the origin of his Spirit hero).
 - A multi-angled feature on the train station sequence.
 - An excerpt from ""Millionaire"" - an amusing early film endeavor of a younger M. Night in a fight scene with two kids.
 - 2 collectible but forgettable illustrations by comic book artist Alex Ross.",1151971200,7,4457,4.990566037735849
1293055,1,B00003CXQA,"The Unbreakable is a film which attempts to rationalize the mythology of a Comic Book Superhero - into our everday life, which was essentially a 20th Century North American artistic phenomenon, becoming everyday Real-Life.

  For this alone, I felt the film did not work for myself. Director M.N.S. (in his late 20's?), does not yet realize; Mythological Figures - are an expression of the inexpressable, and for this reason alone, cannot exist in Real Life, but only within a mythological tale. This is exactly why Superheroes have developed super-natural abilities, because this realm cannot exist within the human realm. This is also the premise for the origin of the comic book, to remove the Superhero from a non-fictionalized human enviroment - into a fictionalized mythology.

  In this film, Director M.N.S. misinterprets the comic book realm - for everyday human life, and subsequently bases his entire film - on this creation of a Superhero. This is why the film is/was destined to fail. If you really wish to see a SuperHero film portrayed in everday life; then watch Superman 2, or Batman Returns, or even Daredevil. At least while watching these 'realistic films', we know they are already based upon a fiction. M.N.S. removes this fiction - and it fails miserably.

  Director M.N.S. ends up presenting Unbreakable from a complete opposite perspective. Instead, Unbreakable ends up being an incredibly droll film to watch, with a banal script - written by the same M.N.S. In other words, can you better comprehend the mythology of a Comic Book Superhero; by standing on the Moon gazing at Earth, or by standing on Earth gazing at the Moon. M.N.S. attempted the latter - and it failed. Instead of the Superhero being 'out there', he opted to make it 'Real Life'.  Maybe in his next film, when he is a little wiser, Director M.N.S. may attempt an actual Superhero film, instead of a boring drama - which ends up being closer to a psychological thriller. This is not a Superhero movie based upon a comic book.",1151107200,2,2020,4.9147058823529415
1293056,3,B00003CXQA,"The reason why I respect M. Night Shyamalan is because he isn't apart of the current Hollywood trend of dumbing down his movies to appeal to the lowest common denominator. He is the foil to Michael Bay, just like Bruce Willis is the foil to Samuel L. Jackson in this movie.

You see, Michael Bay is all about explosions, thin,  underdeveloped plots, and scene changes every 10 seconds.

Unbreakable isn't as good as The Sixth Sense, but it is decent and different from most of the mainstream movies today. And being different is worth at least an extra point.

I do warn you, this film can only be watched and enjoyed by people whose attention span exceeds that of a 5-year old.",1150934400,5,678,4.532786885245901

While I admit the pace is slow and I do tap my foot during some scenes while I rewatch it, I do rewatch it.

It's a great product of many minds, writers and film techs, who obviously love comicbook superheros and were on fire to tell this story and would not compromise. I can imagine the drooling studio execs who wanted to 'redo' it and make it more commercial.

Thank god they couldn't get their hands on it.

1293118,2,B00003CXQA,"Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson are both cast jarringly against type in this film, and the results are very disappointing.  Those of us who have followed Bruce Willis from Moonlighting through Die Hard, The Last Boy Scout, Hudson Hawk, etc., expect some mix of wit, grit, and never say die from a Willis character.  Even in Whole 9 Yards where his hit man character is menacingly humorless, there is a keen if abnormal intellect at work.  In Unbreakable we are briefly introduced to his character and then there is a train wreck.  When he appears to be in shock over the next couple of reels it is assumed he will shake it off to good effect soon.  Instead we are treated to a whole movie of Bruce Willis as a dull, monotone, lackwit that must, for example, have it explained to him that he has never been sick a day in his life.  By a stranger who happens to be Samuel L. Jackson cast as a...(wait for it)...comic collecting nerd with ultra-brittle bones.  (Miles Vorkosigan, phone your office.)  Through all of this Willis is staring out at us like Charlie on the last page of Flowers for Algernon.  There are about ten minutes of good film time scattered like Easter eggs through this otherwise brown and desolate lawn of a film.  The concept of ""how might superfolk evolve and discover themselves and each other in a 'realistic' venue"" has potential, but it is not met here.  Next time, let's hope it involves interesting and engaging characters and less death by pretense.  (And who decided that ""realistic"" everyman characters must be inarticulate morons?  Some of these movie makers should chat with real people sometime.)  All of these people have done better work before and after this movie, but this is only for their ""die-hard"" fans and super hero completists.  Otherwise a missed, and missable, opportunity.",1149379200,,1823,4.742857142857143
1293119,4,B00003CXQA,This movie was interesting and unexpected. It has Bruce Willis from the Sixth Sense who instead of a doctor person plays a security guard who survives a train crash without a scrath on him but then discoveres something different about him later in the movie or somewhere after the crash. Samuel L. Jackson is creepy as Elijah who's obsessed with comics and believes that the security guard is some kind of 'super hero'. The ending gets good and is shocking and expected. The movie was alright.,1148428800,2,493,4.744186046511628
1293120,3,B00003CXQA,"This is a much better film than I ever thought it would be, and intrigues me every time I watch it. Samuel L. Jackson's role is what mainly inspires me to watch this multiple times. His character is amazing and just leaves me shaking my head.

This is a pretty low-key movie with the other star, Bruce Willis, playing an extremely subdued role for him, almost too subdued. There are times in here when you keep waiting for him to say something, and he says nothing. Half the time he's barely audible.

But he and Jackson play off each other well, and this is very suspenseful film, even if a lot doesn't happen. To explain the story would almost ruin it, because it's preposterous. I'll just call an interesting fantasy-horror film with a little family story tied in with Willis' wife (Robin Wright) and young boy (Spencer Treat Clark).

""Unbreakable"" is beautifully filmed, has very little profanity in it, and a strange, strange story with a great twist at the end....one of the best I've ever seen in a movie. This movie is done by the same man who did ""The Sixth Sense,"" M. Night Shyamalan, so if you enjoyed that you probably would like this, too.....although it's so different I wouldn't want to predict who would like this film and who wouldn't. If you're open to try something different, give it a look.",1147478400,,1311,4.594017094017094
1293121,5,B00003CXQA,"I'm going to risk coming off like I'm slightly off my rocker to people who are slightly less...eccentric...than I am and say what I really think of ""Unbreakable"": this movie is the first small portion of what Should happen in the real world.

  A train wreck kills every one of its passengers onboard (okay, that isn't the part that should happen in real life, obviously) except one survivor (played by Bruce Willis in his best role ever) who doesn't have a scratch on him.  This attracts the attention of a comic book historian, of all things, who has a most unusual theory on why this one man was able to escape even the slightest injury.  This historian, briliantly played by Samuel L. Jackson, has reasoned out a theory that seems very reasonable, and very very familiar to me personally.  In this current world, we have crime, war, poverty, neverending famine, disease, and every other malady that preys on the world.  Driven by tremendous hardship in the course of his own life, Jackson's character has wondered: could not nature somehow produce a counterbalance to everything that always goes wrong?

  ""Unbreakable"" is filmed in a grim, dark, rather bleak style meant to highlight - in its early portions - the negative aspects of the world rather than the positive ones.  A broken world, for the most part.  And Jackson is looking for something to break the gridlock from a highly unusual source.

  Great performances by the whole cast, tremendous suspense, thought-provoking and dream-provoking, groundbeakingly innovative, ""Unbreakable"" is Willis's best, and possibly M. Night Shymalan's best as well.  Possibly Jackson's best along with ""Star Wars"", although he didn't play as large a role in those movies (and to be honest, there's still a couple of excellent-looking Samuel Jackson movies out there I haven't seen yet).  This could have spawned not only a sequel or two, but an entire line of movies now that the first crack is in the floodgate.  They wouldn't even have to all have the same characters; the potential for expansion on this concept into a whole movie universe is astonishing.

  If you're intrigued by the comic book references and parralells and would like to give one or both of the 'big' ongoing comic universes a try but don't know where to start, I have a few suggestions.  These collections don't require as much of a foreknowledge of the histories and concepts involved, and get right to the hearts of key characters, and thus would make good starting points. DC- ""Superman: No Limits"", ""Batman: Evolution"", ""Hawkman: Endless Flight"", ""JLA: Pain Of The Gods"".  Marvel- ""New Avengers: Breakout"", ""Incredible Hulk: Return Of The Monster"" (well, right to the heart of one of the Hulk's many incarnations anyway), ""Astonishing X-Men: Gifted"" and ""Amazing Spider-Man: Sins Past""",1146182400,2,2811,5.010775862068965

1293123,5,B00003CXQA,"Ya know, it's so popular for people to bash on Shyamalan that he kinda drops in stature in my mind whenever I don't watch a movie of his for a while.  Then I go back and watch one of them and he pops back up.  I recently watched his last 4 movies, and he's got a very good record, with 2 brilliant films (this and 'Signs'), a very good one ('The Sixth Sense') and a good one. ('The Village').  Though I think that I like 'Signs' best as of this moment it's a tough call, and 'Unbreakable' is, in many ways, his most impressive film.  Perhaps the most extraordinary thing about it is just that it works at all: The whole 'maybe super heroes are real and the comics are just an exaggeration' angle just sounded really stupid to me, but he makes it very dramatic and dark, and creates a world that is impossible not to believe in.  And, finally, I really can't think of another film like 'Unbreakable'.

The central character of the films is David Dunn, a security guard whose marriage is falling apart.  Early in the film David is involved in a horrendous train crash; everyone is killed except for David and he is utterly unharmed.  Shortly thereafter he receives a note from a comic book, I dunno, expert named Elijah Price who has some peculiar theories about who David might really be. (Along with a severe congenital defect which causes his bones to be extremely brittle.)  In short, he thinks that David may be a born hero. (Dunn never seems to get hurt or sick, has an intuitive knowledge as to who may be dangerous and is just extraordinarily strong etc.)  The rest of the film is basically their exploration of the possibility, and a look into Dunn's family life.

Shyamalan's films are unusual because although they involve supernatural occurrences they are invariably about character first and foremost.  (I think this leads to the extreme mixed reactions to the films, as people who are watching this kinda of fantastical thing aren't likely looking for character, while those who traditionally would want character-driven films may generally avoid this kind of film altogether.)  Bruce Willis isn't the most avoid choice for the central role in a character-driven film, but I think he pulls it off well enough.  He's cold and stiff, yes, but that's appropriate for his character.  We only get to know him very slowly as the film move along, but I definitely liked the guy by the end.  Robin Wright Penn is good as his wife Audrey, and she's a bit more emotional and adds some warmth to the film.  Spencer Clark is fine as their son Joseph, though he's most significant as a plot device as he's particularly intrigued by the concept that David may be a hero, and rather forces the issue at a few points.  Some have complained about Samuel L. Jackson as the nutty Elijah.  I can understand why many would dislike him or find him annoying, but I think they're missing the point; I don't think you're particularly supposed to like him, and he is a monomaniacal nut and all.  He is perhaps too much of you're traditional tough/angry Jackson character at times, but I find it hard to get too worked up over that.

Shyamalan's film are accused of being slow, and that they are.  'Unbreakable' may be the slowest, not just in terms of plot but in how it flows and is shot.  The film has tons of extremely long takes and talky scenes.  I suppose I can understand why people will dislike this sorta thing, but this is precisely what I like most about them, and what allows them to really have a strong impact.  Note the rather lengthy scene on the train at the opening of the film where David hits on an agent just prior to the crash.  From a purely practical standpoint this scene is unnecessary; all it really tells us is that Dunn's marriage is on the rocks, and we find that out plenty of other ways.  But that scene really draws you into the film, and really makes you feel the impact of the train crash despite the fact that you never actually see it.  And the slowness is necessary to make it all feel plausible.  There are plenty of extraordinary things going on in this film, and you need to get immersed in the world slowly for it to really hold on to you.  That and it just looks great with fine use of the widescreen format.  These long takes allow for each scene to be composed very deliberately and it's all very sharp and elegant with lot cool blues everywhere.  All of Shyamalan's films have fantastic cinematography but this is probably the best of them.  That and I just really like long takes.  I can't precisely say why.

`Unbreakable' comes to a really extraordinary climax.  It is an action scene, more or less, but it's a beautiful culmination of all the build up in the film.  This is no ordinary action scene, however, it's one of the most deliberate, contained ones ever filmed.  It finds the perfect balance between the cool elegance of the visual style of the movie as a whole and the unglamorous, brute nature of the violence found here.  Had this scene been something ordinary or ineffectual it would've crippled the film, but as it is done it's really the perfect cap to it all.

Lots of people have complained about the ending, but what can I say, I liked it.  It's a bit much, I'll admit, but it's really very clever, I think.

On an unimportant sidenote, I can't help but mention that this film has some references to football, and it's rather abundantly obvious that Shyamalan doesn't know much about the sport.  Most amusingly, the agent on the train talks about how there's this great quarterback at Temple University who's gonna be a star.  Temple, you say? Great quarterback?  I don't think so.  Also, they talk about how Dunn won the rookie of the year trophy, yet he never played professional football, only college.  Now, they've got freshman awards and honors for college football players, obviously, but they wouldn't use the term `rookie'.  None of this matter in the slightest, but it's the sorta thing that football fans might snicker over.  I know I did.

Yeah, this is a great film.  Check it out.

1293124,4,B00003CXQA,"The worst thing you can say about this movie is that it's too low-key and slow-paced for some viewers. Some were annoyed by long silences and whispered dialogue, but I didn't even notice this characteristic (which drove me to turn off _The Pelican Brief_).

Some say it took Willis's character too long to acknowledge the powers we already knew he had, but I think this plot point is crucial to demonstrating the film's claim that superheroes are contemporary mythological figures. Willis's denial is the textbook ""Refusal of the Call"" from the ""Hero's Journey"" of Joseph Campbell. I don't expect everyone to notice or care about such a detail, but I'd like to point out that it's tied to the filmmakers' intent, not just a sign of incompetence.

This is certainly not a ""superhero"" flick in the sense that _Spider-Man_ and _X-Men_ are. Those franchises emphasize pow-bang action. _Unbreakable_ is darker, moodier, and far more serious in its ambitions. It shows how good and evil arise mutually and are ultimately inextricable. That's a theme that may bore some people, but it's a deep one.

I'm not sure how the hero's psychic powers fit with the ""unbreakable"" concept. I would rather he received the obligatory ""Supernatural Aid"" (another stage of the Hero's Journey) in some overt way rather than having it thrown in as a sort of bonus power. Also, his obligatory weakness seems to have been picked out of a hat. More could have been done to tie these aspects thematically to the character.

Other than that, I can't find a flaw in this movie. It won't speak to everyone, but it sure spoke to me.",1140048000,5,1600,4.807272727272728

Jackson is outstanding as a tragic art dealer who specializes in comic art, his character is named Elijah Price and will remind you of the mysterious people Vincent Price portrayed.

I will go on to say that its a more ambitious effort than the Sixth Sense and even further on a limb by saying its better as I preferred this one. I heard one reviewer mentioning the camera techniques,when it comes to framing and compositioning similar to that of Kubrick or Andrei Tarkovsky. That is so true. Each frame feels like a comic book and the cool European look that Eduardo Serra provides,dark blue hues and using cool filters. Night really gets the most unique and best cinematographers to work on his movies and I hear Christopher Doyle who many claim to be the greatest cinematographer currently working and possibly of all time will be working on Shyamalan's latest entitled Lady in the Water out in theatres July 2006. But back to the film,everything from lighting,editing,cinematography is top notch and Night is really proving himself to be the auteur here. Willis performance is fantastic as well as Sam Jackson who is the man. Also the performances from Spencer Treat Clark and Bruce Willis's wife in the movie are awesome and compelling.

This wasn't particularly stressed on in the first Matrix, but after I had seen this movie, it was the first thing I thought of. [This was stressed on further in The Matrix Sequels]

Now, back on-topic....this isn't exactly a thriller. It isn't even a suspense movie, no matter what they tell you. This is sheer cinematic drama supported by a VERY excellent Bruce Willis. I saw this twice and its been 3-4 years, but I still remember enjoying this movie tremendously, just because of Bruce Willis' controlled, mature performance.

Cast:  Bruce Willis, Samuel L. Jackson, Robin Wright Penn, Spencer Treat Clark, Charlayne Woodard, Eamonn Walker, Leslie Stefanson, Johny Hiram Jamison, Michaelia Carroll.

Running Time:  106 minutes

Rated PG-13 for mature thematic elements including some disturbing violent content, and for a crude sexual reference.

M Night Shyamalan's eagerly awaited follow-up to the astonishing, genre-defining ""The Sixth Sense"" may not hit the heady heights of its predecessor, but it is still an intriguing film.  Bruce Willis (returning with Shyamalan after his stunning performance in ""The Sixth Sense"") is American everyman David Dunn. His marriage has fallen apart and he finds it hard to relate to his young son. After years as a security guard at the local football stadium, he goes to New York for a job interview. On the journey home, the train crashes at high speed. Dunn is the only survivor and emerges from the wreckage completely unscathed and something of a media celebrity.  His story is followed closely by local comic book enthusiast Elijah Price (Samuel L Jackson), an unhinged loner with a rare genetic disorder that makes him prone to broken bones. Price becomes convinced that Dunn is some kind of super-human, immune to pain or injury, and constantly pesters him about his history and lifestyle. It suddenly dawns on Dunn that he has never had a sick day or been injured in any way his whole life. He also has an uncanny knack of spotting potential trouble-makers and ne'er-do-wells at the football stadium. Price claims his choice of profession was borne of a subconscious desire to protect people and urges him to harness his powers in the conquest of evil, but Dunn is a reluctant superman. Despite an improvement in his relationship with his son (who is thrilled to have a comic book hero for a Dad) he remains unconvinced he is anything other than normal man (albeit a thick-skinned one).

Obsessive comic book fans will probably not like the performance of a big wigged Jackson, wide-eyed stare and grandiose dialogue. Willis does his whispering trick again like he did in ""The Sixth Sense"" and sadly can't portray the emotional turmoil needed for a character like David. Much better are Clark and Penn as David's son and wife, both of whom find themselves questioning David as much as themselves,the atmosphere and tension are built up well and the obligatory twist at the end is well written and well disguised.  ""Unbreakable"" never fully hits its stride until the end but when it does, it proves to be a tense thriller full of the quasi-supernatural imagery that Shyamalan loves.  Not up to par with ""Signs"" or ""The Sixth Sense"", but certainly worth the gander.",1136073600,,2715,5.0088888888888885
1293199,3,B00003CXQA,"Unbreakable is overwhelmingly underwhelming as a movie.  It has slow, deliberate pacing and takes itself far, far too seriously.  It took Bruce Willis an hour and eighteen minutes to even entertain the idea that he had special powers, when the viewer knew it from square one.  Knowing that this is an M. Night Shyamalan movie, viewers can expect a big twist of a pay-off at the end of the movie, and Shyamalan doesn't disappoint.  It's not clear if the journey is worth it, however.",1135641600,2,482,4.7023809523809526
1293200,5,B00003CXQA,"What is so intriguing about Unbreakable is the examination of the archetypal elements of comic book superheroes and villains--and if they have true-life correlations in reality.

Samuel L. Jackson, an incredible actor, plays a comic book connoisseur with a congenital disease that leaves him with brittle bones that shatter like glass. He believes that somewhere there must exist his opposite--someone that is never sick and superhumanly strong.

When Jackson discovers that David Dunn (played by Bruce Willis) is the only survivor of a deadly train wreck, Jackson's character pursues Dunn--trying to convince him that he is indeed a ""super hero"". The ending is surprising and the movie is thought provoking.

I love mystical themes in movies, and this film examines how far archetypal roles stretch out into ""reality"", if there is indeed a ""flip side"" to every person and extreme, and an unusual examination of ""evil"" and ""good"".",1133827200,7,930,5.27027027027027
1293201,3,B00003CXQA,"I think this movie may deserve a bit higher standing than what a lot of people gave it when it came out in theaters. The acting is superb, the story compelling, and the end twist is excellent.

The only major problem I have with this film, which is what brings it down to 3 stars... relates to what a wonderful director once said - that in movies, it's really all about the ending. Here, I liked the idea for the ending, and how the story actually turns out. But I hate how it gets shown to the audience- more specifically - the captions detailing what happened to the characters.

It is such a weird, unnecesary component that it just boggles my mind why Shyamalan would think that the movie, given its wonderful weight and structure so far, would require 80's comedy movie type captions that describe what happens to these 2 fictional characters. I am of the firm belief that captions at the end are solely to be used for films based on some form of truth. To wrap things up by explaining what happens to the characters, without it being onscreen, seems way too silly within a fictitious story. And it makes a wonderful movie such as this seem rushed at the end. It truly angered me to see that, given the connection I'd felt so far with the movie.

I guess you could put that aside and just appreciate the rest of the flick. Doing that, know that this movie is very good. I just wish the ending would have been executed more adequately.",1133740800,2,1439,4.402255639097745
1293202,5,B00003CXQA,"How do you follow up a massive success? It's been a question long asked with certain filmmakers. How can James Cameron top Titanic, which is still the top money-making movie ever(not counting old movies and inflation). And George Lucas will pretty much be that Star Wars dude. Upstart director M Night Shyamalan came out with The Sixth Sense, an intriguing thriller with one of the best and well-known twist endings in existence. So how do you follow it up? Make something similar.

A train derails and causes a huge disaster killing everyone. That is except for one: David Dunn, a security guard working at a stadium. The kicker is: not only did he survive but he didn't even get scratched, hurt, a headache or anything. This attracts the interest of a comic book enthusiast Elijah Price who gets David's attention by asking a simple question: how many times have you been sick? Turns out David can't and he can potentially be what Elijah's been looking for: a real-life comic book hero.

The trailer was probably the most interesting thing about the film. Someone stumbles upon an immunity to pain and injury and we're trying to figure out how he does it. It comes out and it mentions comic books. Like subsequent films The Village and Lady in the Water, Unbreakable was an intriguing premise until it steers off in other directions. What is here though is intriguing regardless. I always was fascinated by mythology and special abilities that comic books can bring so of course, me and my nerdness gravitated towards this. The only thing is that it might be unintentionally funny. When David is told that something is like his kryptonite it's kind of like ""oh, boy"".

The one thing that makes this different is that unlike the others which had character moments interspersed with full-on thriller scenes, this gears into more drama and character stuff. For some, it's a great change of pace rather than relying on scary stuff and spooks but for others it's kind of tedious and slow. The one thing that irks me though is that there's a bit too much flashyness with the camera. The camera is upside-down, reflected in mirrors, shot through that sliver of space in seats. Now granted Shyamalan is one of the few that knows where to put his camera but at times it's like ""quit showing off, man"".

Performances-wise it's good all around. Bruce still talks in that kind of I-sound-super-bored voice that he always has and Robin and Spencer are good in their respective roles, a highlight scene being a little confrontation at the dinner table. Samuel L. Jackson comes in and of course acts awesome but with a haircut like a run-in with an angry blow-dryer and full pimpness complete with cane, it comes a bit close to campy. You can almost imagine characters to go ""smack!"" or ""zop!"" when someone gets punched.

In terms of where his films stand, this is either everybody's least favorite(or the Village) or it's underrated and we just don't get it. I'm more in the middle. It's a good film, not great.",1131408000,2,2999,4.748560460652591
1293203,4,B00003CXQA,"There are many different elements such as; lighting, cinematography, and soundtrack that must come together seamlessly in order to create a movie that can withstand the sharp tongues of critics and the wandering eye of the viewer. Unbreakable is a movie that has undeniably seemed to accomplish this task. With its amazing camera angles and compelling music, Unbreakable keeps the viewers of all ages and interests engrossed over its entire 107 minute span. Written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan; creator of the Oscar nominated Sixth Sense, Unbreakable is an exceedingly imaginative and twisted movie in which the viewer is entwined in a tale about comic book superheroes and their arch enemies. With an illustrious cast composed of Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson this movie not only entertains its audience, it also compels them to question the validity of the idea that comic books are true stories that have just been exaggerated. Jackson himself depicts the movie best when he is describing a comic book drawing to a customer stating, ""It is a classic depiction of good versus evil.""

 David Dunn, who is played by Willis, is a stadium security guard who appears to lead a rather typical suburban life. The viewer's first introduction to Dunn occurs when he is on a train, returning from a business trip in New York. After showing a view of Dunn's head resting against the window of the train, the movie cuts to a scene from a news report that shows the same train derailed and in flames. The view is told that there has been a horrific accident in which Dunn is the only survivor and is left completely unharmed. The enormity of his good fortune is hammered home when he attends the memorial service held for the other passengers on the train. This is when he is first contacted by Elijah Price, who is played by Samuel L. Jackson.

 Price is the owner of a comic book museum who suffers from a disease known as osteogensis imperfecta type I. This disease is described as an inherited connective tissue disorder which is characterized by extremely fragile bones, thin skin, growth deficiency and overtly extendable joints. The viewer is first familiarized with Price and his disease in the opening scene of the movie. He is shown as a baby who has suffered fractures of both arms and legs during the birthing process. This begins his life of glass-like existence. Because of his disease, Price spends much of his time inside his comic book museum which has caused him to develop a type of alternate reality in which he believes he is part of a real life comic book story. When he first meets Dunn he explains, ""If there is someone that is extremely fragile, isn't it possible for someone to be at the opposite end of the spectrum, the kind of person comic book stories are about, someone put here to protect us?"". And thus begins the story of the comic book hero (Dunn) and his arch enemy (Price).

 Unbreakable is full of twists that take the viewer through a series of scenarios in which Dunn is trying to prove, to himself and his family, that he is, in fact, not the hero Price has made him out to be. The viewers see the power of his physical strength when Dunn realizes that he can bench press over 350 pounds, literally without breaking a sweat and they see the power of his mental strength when Dunn confesses that he has the ability to `see' things after touching a person, an idea that is strangely similar to one that is portrayed in The Green Mile starring Tom Hanks. While not an original concept, it is one that allows the movie to move forward to the actual comic book scenario in which Dunn finally embraces Price's idea that he is somehow impenetrable to the dangers of the real world.

One of the most comic-book like scenarios in Unbreakable is when Dunn acts on Price's advice and proceeds to a busy train station where he bumps into a disgruntled sanitation worker. He `sees' that this man has broken into a suburban home, much like his own, killed the father and taken the rest of the family hostage. Dunn follows the man to the home where he confirms that his suspicions are true. He then sets about saving the family, all the while cloaked in a dark poncho that is aptly stamped with the word `Security'. Seeing Dunn against the raining night sky, shrouded in black, the viewer gets an image of a true comic book hero come to life. Dunn is in the process of saving the murdered mans wife, after he frees his two children, when he is attacked by the sanitation worker. He is thrown into the family's pool which is an ominous sign. Earlier in the movie, Pierce explained that every comic book hero has a weakness, much like Superman's kryptonite. He established that Dunn's kryptonite is water due to the fact that Dunn nearly drowned as a child, which also happens to be the last time Dunn ever remembers being sick. While Dunn is in the pool, he flashes back to this childhood incident which provides the audience with a tremendous amount of apprehension that is so commonly found in M. Night Shyamalan's work. In an ironic turn, Dunn is then saved by the children he just rescued, making the reader question whether or not comic book superheroes are any different from the rest of us.

  While this movie provides plenty of twists and turns, it ends in an incredibly unexpected manner, leaving the viewer feeling a bit lost and wondering what has become of the comic book superhero they have begun to know so well. Despite this lack of closure, Unbreakable secured many positive reviews from all over the world, ensuring is survival in the movie industry. Shyamalan does an amazing job convincing his audience that stories really do come true, even if those stories happen to come out of a comic book. With its incredible cast, Unbreakable is an excellent modern day version of the story of good versus evil.",1131408000,3,5847,4.667961165048544
1293204,4,B00003CXQA,"I like this director and, with the possible exception of ""The Village"" have found his movie making technique just as compelling -- if not more so -- as the themes he was exploring. I don't want to rehash all of the same points made by other reviewers and just want to make one.

There has always been one particular aspect of ""Unbreakable"" that I found truly amazing: the movie is a comic book. From the dialogue to the pacing to, most importantly, the cinematography, the entire film moves, feels and sounds like it has come right off the neatly boxed pages of Stan Lee, et al.

I was reminded of Shyamalan's superior ability in this regard after seeing ""A History of Violence"" just last night. Based on a graphic novel, the same aspects of ""Violence"" that have amateur reviewers (and some professionals) raving are the ones Shymalan did much earlier and much, much better. While we're talking about, comparisons to ""Spiderman"" and ""Batman"" would be worth discussing but ""Unbreakable"" goes where none of the specific adaptations could: into the ""real"" and generic world of the hero vs. villain. You could bring up ""Sin City"" in a conversation like this, but that film is remarkable for being on literally the opposite end of the spectrum: animation personified.

""Unbreakable"" is a classic example of a movie written, designed and made to look and feel a very specific way. If you didn't enjoy it, I'd be willing to say it was the comic book world he created that you didn't enjoy, and not the film that he made. Does that make sense? I don't care, really.",1130976000,2,1557,4.695970695970696
1293205,5,B00003CXQA,"Life is not a comic book, and Superman doesn't exist.

There are no caped crusaders, no black-cloaked night-defying vigilantes serving as unseen sentinels of Truth, Order, and Justice, watching over the harried commuter as the literal incarnation of the better angels of our Nature. The City out there has teeth and claws: you're going to get in trouble, and when you do, no one is going to come to your rescue.

You see that weaselly, wizened, bespectacled clerk across the aisle from us on the train? That's the one, you got him pegged---looks like Clark Kent, doesn't he? Now, when that wild-eyed guy three rows down from him opens up his trenchcoat to reveal an AK-47 and makes the 6PM rush-hour express his personal butcher-shop, Clark Kent is going to stay just that---weaselly, bespectacled Clark Kent. No phone booth transformation for him, no salvation for you and me and our fellow passengers. Nope, he's going to scream, and try to run, and die Clark Kent, along with you and me.

In our world, men and women die meanginglessly every day: in traffic pile-ups, in air disasters, pushed on the subway tracks by anonymous madmen, who later disappear in the crowd. There is no Superman; there never was, there never will be. Or will there? M. Night Shyamalan leads us right down that particular rabbit hole in the eerily profound and deeply moving ""Unbreakable"", his meditation about the meaning of a superhero in a callow age.

Case in point: Security guard David Dunn (Bruce Willis) is riding home on the train from a Manhattan job interview (he didn't get an offer---see?---real life). He checks out his seatmate; yeah he's married---but it's a bad marriage, dying a day at a time---and she's lithe, tall, slender, good facial structure. She stows her carry-on in the overhead bin, and as she does her shirt rides up, revealing a black rose tattoo. Nice.

They make small-talk; she's a sports-agent on her way to meet with a rising young football star; in the football spirit, David Dunn makes a pass---and fumbles. She gets creeped out and takes a seat a few rows down. A minute later the train shakes, there's a high keening noise, another furious bump---the bad kind, the Something is Very Wrong kind---and the train derails.

Everyone aboard dies. Everyone except David Dunn, who walks away from the steaming, smoldering carnage without a scratch.

Shellshocked, baffled, confused, he attends the church service for the dead; staggering outside, he finds a glossy invitation---with a cryptic phrase---to a Philadelphia art gallery affixed to his windshield.

That leads him to reclusive art dealer Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson, who along with Willis carries this movie with poise and presence), taunted as ""Mr. Glass"" by his erstwhile classmates, sufferer of a rare bone disease called Osteogenesis Imperfecta (a real disease): the slightest stress can snap his bones to splinters.

In turn, we meet Elijah's true life's work: reasoning that if a man of Glass could exist the Bell Curve of human genetics would also feature a Man of Steel, he has spent years sifting through horrific accidents for survivors--and more importantly, for that one man in a million who could be a Superhero.

Just as with ghosts and werewolves and vampires, you can deal every day with arguments against---but it only takes one true positive to change the world. And in David Dunn, Elijah feels he has found his Positive.

Dunn isn't having any of it: besides, he has tons of evidence why he's not a comic book hero: he's just a GUY---dead-end job, marriage on the rocks, and he's not invulnerable---hell, as a rising young college football star, he was injured in a nasty car accident---with his then girlfriend and now wife Audrey (Robin Wright Penn)---that injured his legs and ended his football career.

The superficial have called Shyamalan a great many things: a spooky director, a horror director, a 'twist' director---but in fact, M. Night has really always been interested in probing the Human Soul, and has tilted at a wide range of genres---Alien invasion, Ghosts, Monsters in the Woods, Superheroes---to dig into the human condition. What makes us tick. What distinguishes us from the animals. Our Gods, our night terrors, our inspirations. Knowledge---of reality, of self, of destiny---comes at a price. And as this strangely sedate, moody piece winds its way to culmination, we find that Dunn's price is extraordinary frightening---and severe.

Shyamalan serves ""Unbreakable"" up as a warped riff on the superhero origin story: the initial reluctance and bewilderment on the part of the crime-fighter, the secret identity, the strange ellipitical orbit of superhero and supervillain. His directing here is restrained and reticent, and this restraint is given fuller effect by cinematographer Eduaro Serra, who casts everything through a blue filter than enhances the moodiness, uncertainty, and depression.

Finally, M. Night proves again that he's an actor's director: this moodpiece is brought off nicely by essentially four actors: Willis playing it with brooding---but hopeful---understatement as David Dunn; Jackson serving as perfect sounding board, foil, and fencing master for the reluctant hero Dunn; and Robin Wright Penn (Audrey) and Spencer Treat Clark bringing up the rear as the dubious wife and adoring son.

Not a flashy, gangbusting epic like Spider-Man, ""Unbreakable"" is no less a moody, thoughtful treatment of the Origin Story---no less so because Shyamalan is wrestling with the hero within all of us. Prepare to be have your emotions broken---prepare to be shaken.

1293206,5,B00003CXQA,"Unbreakable, simply put, is the best PG-13 movie that I have ever seen. Period.

The first time I saw this movie was a couple of years ago right after watching the sixth sense. The sixth sense was good with a shocker of an ending but was overated. Now comes Unbreakable, a movie in a so called trilogy, but this obviously got cancelled once everyone hated it. Well, I can't agree with that. And, I can't sit back while this movie gets criticized. Give me 0 out of 567777777 helpful votes, I don't care. I need to get my point across.

First of all, PG-13 movies are horrible. End of story. The only good ones are the comedies. SOMETIMES ONLY THOUGH. After that, well, it's crap. The action movies are horrible with nonstop explosions and horrible acting. Simply put, well, if you look in my top 50 movies of all time (which I find to be veryaccurate), there are probably ZERO PG-13 movies. Only R. Why? Because R movies are realistic, and it's there that I can find the powerful dramas and the eye popping action movies. But wait what's this? Unbreakable, a PG-13 movie in my top 50? Scary. But true. I am very dissapointed that this movie didn't fare well because it gives all. It is a powerful movie, with excellent acting, and a fantastic ending. The plot is remarquable and finally something original. I found the movie to be very well made, with wonderful directing and writing. The actors are all connected and are great together. As for the plot, wow, it's amazing. The movie is about a man played by Bruce Willis that survives a horrific train crash. Without any injury. Without a scratch. Meet Elijah played by the always wonderful Samuel L. Jackson who does as usual an excellent job. He is very breakable, with a very serious problem that makes him very vulnerable to injuries. He is an avid comic book collector and when he hears of the crash and one survivor, he knows that he is a superhero. Like in his comic books. Of course he is crazy. Right?

Samuel L. Jackson is fantastic and has great chemistry with Bruce Willis. The movie has a very unpredictable ending (oh I'm sorry that I'm not as smart as the one reviewer who had it predicted in the first 5 minutes. ? He didn't even have the wreck in the first 5 minutes! We didn't even meet Elijah yet! And you want action, right? This isn't an action movie!)

The movie had a very good moral and had a deeper meaning I found to be very intersting.

This trully is a wonderful and compelling movie that I adore. And for a movie fan like me, this is just what I've been looking for.",1128556800,10,2545,4.4411134903640255
1293267,2,B00003CXQA,"Unbreakable came out in ""2000"" and it had the best trailer for any M.N.S film ever. However,I saw this movie recently only because I wish to watch every movie by the director of this film. I thought ""The Village"" prompted this need in me. Compared to the disquieting Village and the haunting ""Sixth Sense"", Unbreakable falls flat on it's face.

I notice a reviewer talk about the patience needed to watch this film(please see the most voted review for this film). Now I am not the most acclaimed critic in the world,neither am I an above average movie watcher, but I can tell you this -Any time wasted on Unbreakable would be criminal. One needs to be really really bored to derive any sort of usefullness from this film. My subject is one of the reasons I write a review. I thought the kid in the film could have been given lesser scenes featuring him & he could not have spoken a dialogue at all. I have always taken Bruce Willis seriously but in this film, he acted as though he was under a contract to do this film and he would do so under any circumstances whatsoever.

Samuel Jackson can't act. He'd make a good cocaine seller in a film like Blow because he would have less dialogues then and his facial criminal instincts would be used to the maximum of effect. The lady who played Bruce's wife in the film is just about as bad an actor as there can be. I do not like criticising films and mostly I search for the essence of every film but... Unbreakable had way too many loopholes and boredom inducing scenes for me to tolerate.

MOST INTERESTING SCENE IN THE FILM - Damn! I realise that there was no scene in the film that managed to remotely impress me. The worst of films have a scene about them that can be recalled but Unbreakable had none. I enjoyed watching Bruce Willis lift weight in the film and play the role of a superman while doing it. [Had he killed Samuel Jackson (Elijah) in the end, I would have enjoyed the film a tad bit ] Now that I'm thinking Samuel Jackson's hairdo looked super hilarious in the film. I mean he looks like a monster from the 1960's really.

I do not think kids should act in Science Fictions/Thrillers/Supernatural films. I thought the recently released film , War of The Worlds deserved 5 stars had they left the little blonde headed girl out of it. I'm sorry, it's my fault but I find it hard to take kids speaking dialogues seriously. I watched Unbreakable because of the same reason for which I went to the theater to watch ""the Village"" I had heard a lot of -tive reviews of the film. It's a good thing I downloaded thsi movie and did not rent/buy the dvd.

If you are considering buying this dvd, do so only if you have scene the film beforehand. Secondly, don't forget to email me about how rich you are and we could be friends. I must be mad for having the urge to watch every movie out there, Rent this if only you have a similar urge to watch Unbreakable.

I await M. Night Shyamalan's next film to be released in 2006 called ""Lady In The Water""",1126137600,2,3003,4.353571428571429
1293268,5,B00003CXQA,"the great thing about m. night shyamalan's is that their never really *about* what they purport to be.  'the sixth sense' really isn't about a kid who sees dead people.  it's about family, namely a boy and his mother, and the intricacies of their relationship.  'signs' isn't a a movie about an alien invasion, but rather about a family coming together amidst a crisis and ultimately rediscovering their faith. 'the village' isn't about creepy crawlie creatures in the woods. again, it's about families--especially what parents will do to 'protect' children.  m. night shyamala's best film, 'unbreakable,' repeats a similar theme.  on the surface, yes, it's about a simple man accepting the superhero mantle. but it's much more than that: it's about a fractured family coming back together.  this familial theme is what makes shyamalan's work so important. he's not afraid to tackle family issues in a thoughtful, honest way, cleverly spun around the 'surprise ending' for which he's so famously known.

several points about 'unbreakable.'

1) the writing.  as usual, m. night shyamalan has more understanding and insight into human nautre in his earlobe that most screenwriters will possess over a lifetime.  his scripts are carefully measured out. he doesn't waste dialogue.  every line reveals something important, gives us insight into the characters or advances plot.  most importantly, his characters are real. for example:

audrey dunn: when did you first think we might not make it?

david dunn: i had a bad dream and I didn't wake you up so you could tell me it would be ok.

it doesn't get much better than that.

2) the acting. the four central characters--bruce willis, robin wright-penn, samuel l. jackson and spencer treat clark--are amazingly good.  wright-penn's perfomance is especially notable. when she asks bruce willis' character if 'he's been with anyone else' is so heartbreaking and delivered with such intensity and honesty that she nearly steals the film in that one scene.  bruce willis lends his character a nice bit of gravitas. and watching his mope around as the emotionally detached david dunn is strangely riveting.  samuel l. jackson, well, you just have to see him with his frederick douglas coiff and purple suit. always reliable, jacks plays a nutty character without a surprising amout of restaint which makes him all the more believable.  and finally, spencer treat clark is amazing as david's doe-eyed son, the only one who initially believes in his father's abilities (shyamalan has as incredible knack for casting the right people, especially children, in his films).

those who may be put off by the subject matter need not worry. view this film as a family study and it will be that much more rewarding.",1124668800,11,2747,5.100671140939597

I thought the cinematography was wonderful. There was different colour hues for different scenes. With a green hue for David ( Bruce Willis charachter) and a purple hue for Ellijah. This is meant to represent the fact that the characters are on different scales of the spectrum.

The story was well written and the character development of David is done very well. Also the complex relationship he has with his wife is portrayed nicely.

1293272,5,B00003CXQA,"M. Night Shyamalan is quickly becoming the type of Hollywood director I want to see more of. There is only one word that can truly classify this, his second feature film: Brilliant!

Bruce Willis comes to us in the guise of one Mr. David Dunn, a hitherto nondescript bear of a man who makes a living as a run of the mill security guard. He soley survives a fatal train wreck with nary a single scratch and, not long after, crosses paths with a shadowy stranger(the cleverly cast Samuel L. Jackson)who evidently knows far more about him than he does himself. Jackson, a man who believes comic book heroes live and breathe, is obsessed with David. He possesses certain knowledge of David's inner self that could very well change the course of his entire natural life. The story that unfolds from there on in is certainly one of the more original approaches to the whole superhero sub-genre that I can honestly say I have ever seen.

Shyamalan takes us on a journey that, while at times may seem easy to figure out, is chock full of mind-bending twists and turns. The plot concept is not merely amazing, it is clearly off the page. This is a movie that is guaranteed to keep you riveted to the screen.

Believe all the positive press you have heard. ""Unbreakable"" definitely delivers!",1118448000,2,1281,4.609649122807017

1293274,5,B00003CXQA,"What person, fan or not of superheroes stories, has not thought at least once, if it's possible that such fantastic figure exists, a person able to defeat evil?

The creative brilliant mind of Sixth Sense, M. Night Shyamalan, explores the possibility of such preposterous hypothesis in his film, Unbreakable.

David Dunn (Willis) is a security guard, whose family life is crumbling. A fatal train accident miraculously leaves David as the only survivor, without a singular scratch or psychological trauma. Such strange event catches the attention of Elijah Price (Jackson).

Carrier of a disease that makes him extremely fragile, Elijah has gallant ideas about David, who demonstrates skepticism and thinks in the beginning that Elijah is crazy... until slowly, he begins to discover amazing things...

We must not be confused by the similarities between Unbreakable and Sixth Sense: certainly both were written and directed by Shyamalan, starred Willis, set in Philadelphia and structured in three acts, but the similarities end there. While Sixth Sense was a character drama with a supernatural touch, Unbreakable is a mysterious history with continuous growing suspense.

Unbreakable tries to present to us, in the most realistic way possible, David and Elijah's journey towards the discovery of something ""greater"", beyond the human understanding, about ""that quality"" that makes some people different from the rest of humanity.

Faith, coincidence and the presence of a sixth sense are constant subjects in this story, where two men opposed in many ways - physically, intellectually and philosophically- must learn to develop their instincts and to discover their mission in life. The atmosphere in the movie is less than chilling, full of anticipation and surprises.

Using like reference the worlds displayed in heroes stories like Superman, Spiderman and such, Shyamalan tries to make us understand that the latter are not mythical stories where good faces evil, but human efforts to explain the very nature of the evil.

The cinematographic style applied to the film maintains an involving and realistic tone: the images are deep, full of important actions; the sequences are long, full of sorrow, tension and complexity. The narrative is absorbent.

While the central characters and their complicated emotional maps are exposed, we get caught by the unusual world the movie displays. Bruce Willis reflects a wide emotional turbulence as the reticent man who has to accept his destiny, while Jackson is magnetic like the man full of fantastic theories, worthy of a lunatic who has just escaped an asylum.

Once again, Shyamalan demonstrates that he is a brilliant film director. Imaginative, able to surprise, confuse and please our expectations. His work in the direction keeps exploring new ways; his eagerness in the details is admirable.

An unexpected end, although not as surprising as the one in Sixth Sense, will leave you with the sensation that Shyamalan, without no impudence, has made fun of us again. Everything what we thought we knew about heroes and villains will not be worth anything while we pleasantly discover the secrets Unbreakable hides.",1115942400,,3170,5.3453815261044175

1293276,5,B00003CXQA,"Immensely enjoyable, tightly presented, and even the edits are sensible.

Usually, I find that at least some deleted scene is a studio ripout of a key scene. This was done so tightly, that it all made total sense; however, the sense also had an incredibly visceral side. The one element that sticks out in the worst possible way is the bone breaks that the baby, the child, and the adult, played by Jackson , goes through... kind of an OUUUUCH, that GOTTA  hurt, sort of feel.

Most of the action seems to be about Willis's characters journey, however, in a very sudden twist, we discover that this is a journey of a dualistic kind.

In many respects this is a reductionist version of a superhero style story.

However you view it, this film will leave you with some degree of impact, and you will undoubtedly take sides. It is absolutely brilliant escapism.

1293317,4,B00003CXQA,"One of the best thrillers of 2000, Unbreakable is writer/director M. Knight Shyamalan's follow up production to the 1998 blockbuster The Sixth Sense. Although not as phenomenally successful as that film, Unbreakable is nonetheless a memorable and suspense ridden picture certain to entertain. Shyamalan uses a unique comic book format to weave a tale of a superhero who fails to realize his own powers. But audiences won't confuse Unbreakable with Spiderman or Superman. The film isn't as one-dimensional with its characters, and the employment of special effects is not a focal point of the film. Instead, Unbreakable remains more of a mystery, thriller combination, and one that works well...

Security Guard David Dunn (Bruce Willis) makes headlines as the sole survivor of a massive train wreck which kills 130+ passengers. But not only does David survive the wreck, he emerges from the wreckage without a single scratch. Soon after, David is approached by Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson), owner of a comic book art gallery and expert on the world of comics. Elijah suffers from a genetic disease which causes his bones to be extremely brittle. Confined in his home, Elijah's mother bought him comic books throughout his youth. Believing the comics to be a modern form of ancient storytelling describing the lives of real people of super-human abilities, Elijah postulates that David is one such person.

The fanatical comic book lover produces evidence of David's survival of a car wreck twenty years earlier, his survival on the train, and his injury-free days as a star football player. As the polar-opposite of David, Elijah has been in search of such a person for his entire life. Now, he must convince David that he holds the aforementioned powers. As David comes to believe he holds the power of the 'unbreakable', he also develops an awareness of a special sense which gives him the ability to tell if someone has done, or is about to do, something sinister. As David comes to appreciate his special powers, the world around him crystallizes with a terrifying clarity...

Featuring one of the better surprise endings of the decade, Unbreakable is one of the reasons Shyamalan's reputation has risen to such a lofty position in the world of film. Well-written and well-directed, M. Knight Shyamalan creates a brilliant follow up to The Sixth Sense with the dark and mysterious Unbreakable. Samuel L. Jackson plays his part well, employing the use of his penetrating stare and authoritative voice for maximum effect. Bruce Willis stars again in a role he knows well - that of the hero.

Although it lacked the commercial success and Academy Award speculation of its forerunner, Unbreakable is nevertheless an entertaining film. Weaving a strange and exotic tale of two men who lead opposite lives in the physical realm, it makes deft use of cinematography and dripping suspense to leave its audience perched on the edge of curiosity. As a result, Unbreakable made a place for itself among the best films of 2000, and it definitely ranks as a must-see film...

1293318,1,B00003CXQA,"I read a review of Unbreakable in the Cincinnati Enquirer and the writer said the movie was great. He also said that the ending was some surprising twist. Either I'm smart or this man was extremely dumb.

Unbreakable is not good. The ending has no twist. I guessed it in the first five minutes. That is incredibly disappointing.

The best part of the movie, without giving away too much, is the action scene. that's right. there is basically one action scene. If there had more action, I might have liked this movie more.

My 16-year-old-brother was bored for the first hour of this movie and my mom fell asleep for a half-hour of the movie.

IGNORE the hype for this movie. Save you money. Sixth Sense was good. Unbreakable is not.",1112054400,2,732,4.564885496183206
1293319,4,B00003CXQA,"M. Night Shyamalan, who gave us six-time Academy Award nominee ""The Sixth Sense"" last year, has written and directed yet another praiseworthy film in ""Unbreakable.""  The film stars veteran actors Bruce Willis as modern day superhero David Dunn and Samuel L. Jackson as comic book collector Elijah Price. ""Unbreakable"" also stars Robin Wright Penn as Dunn's wife, Audrey, and Spencer Treat Clark as his son, Joseph.

""Unbreakable"" is a film about two men, who have lived their years at opposite ends of life's spectrum.  On one end is security guard David Dunn, who has never been sick a day in his entire life, or injured for that matter.  On the other is comic book collector Elijah Price, who suffers from a rare condition that makes his bones shatter like glass. After living through a catastrophe-the derailment of a train that results in the deaths of one hundred and thirty-one passengers, leaving only David Dunn alive-Dunn is sought out by Price, who suggests to him that he could be ""unbreakable.""  What follows is the personal journey of the film's protagonist, David Dunn, as he discovers, through the help of Elijah Price, that even the most ordinary of men is capable of the extraordinary.

Although the film, ""Unbreakable,"" has been called a drama, it embodies elements that will make audiences think it a little too fantastic in nature.  While a dramatic thread runs through the film-as Dunn and his wife, Audrey, are given a second chance at love, and the relationship between David and his doting son, Joseph, is explored-Dunn's superhuman strength, for example, and a flashback to a college car accident that Dunn and his now-wife, Audrey, survived is likely to seem implausible to audiences, and leave them thinking that ""Unbreakable"" is not a drama at all, but a work of fantasy.

Bruce Willis's subdued performance as David Dunn is noteworthy; however, Dunn will remind you (just a little too much) of Malcolm Crowe, the character that Willis played in ""The Sixth Sense.""  In fact, there are moments when audiences will swear that Willis is indeed playing the same character.  Samuel L. Jackson also delivers a stellar performance as Elijah Price, as he helps Willis's character, David Dunn, discover himself, while he himself realizes who he truly is.  Of course, supporting actress Robin Wright Penn and actor Spencer Treat Clark, who play David Dunn's wife and son, serve us up a healthy dose of notable performances as well.

Most critics have reported liking this film, but have also noted the similarities between the protagonist, David Dunn, in ""Unbreakable"" and Malcolm Crowe from ""The Sixth Sense.""  Additionally, critics have also noted that audiences may feel a bit let down by the last thirty minutes of the film in which Willis's character is compelled to arbitrarily prove his superhuman abilities to both audiences and his son.  Even with these stumbling blocks, however, ""Unbreakable"" is still a praiseworthy follow-up to last year's ""The Sixth Sense.""

This movie won't surprise you in the same way that ""The Sixth Sense"" did, but it will surprise you (in an ""Oh! That makes sense!"" kind of way). M. Night Shyamalan has delivered audiences another treat in ""Unbreakable.""  I couldn't have predicted how much I was going to like this film.",1111017600,2,3276,5.016605166051661
1293320,5,B00003CXQA,"Before the superhero genre became really popular with X-Men, Spiderman, Hulk and Daredevil, Unbreakable slipped onto the scene with a truly fascinating look at the possibility of Superheroes and comic books being a form of modern mythology.

Now before you completely discount this movie for being anything like the other Superhero movies, let me reassure you that the approach on this subject is so strictly geared toward being realistic you could very much believe the premise.  The best part is that the `hero' doesn't even know he is a hero.

In an intelligent move on his part, M. Night Shyamalan reveals almost nothing about the movie except for the phrase stated in the trailers, `There is a train wreck, there is one survivor, and he is miraculously unharmed.'  With this statement we are intrigued.  How did he survive?  Not even a scratch?  How?

Bruce Willis plays the survivor, David Dunn, a seemingly normal individual with a bad marriage and non-communicative relationship with his son and wife.  Immediately after the wreck he is approached by a strange individual; Elijah Price, superbly played by Samuel L. Jackson.  He states his case to Dunn, revealing to him his lack of illnesses in his lifetime and the fact that subconsciously he chose a profession as a security guard.  He lays out everything with dead on seriousness and conviction.  Intrestingly, Price has a condition of brittle bones that causes them break in even the mildest of impacts.  This is what made him seek out Dunn, their stark contrasts.

As events unfold we find out along with Dunn as he discovers he can do things he never dreamed or tried.  Shyamalan smartly tones it down in order to keep us on board.  Dunn doesn't go out and suddenly lift a car over his head.  He finds that as he works out, he can add more and more weight to the bench press.  He struggles a bit, but eventually manages to lift over 900 pounds.

This kind of realistic discovery about himself and the enlightenment of his own abilities starts to change his own life.  He seems to find purpose, or at least importance in what who he is.  The dichotomy of his character and Elijah truly comes to a head in the finale.  This movie is slow paced thriller, with a dramatic story and a twist that is worthy of the Sixth Sense.  There is nothing in Unbreakable that would make you predict the ending of this one.  Highly recommended, a great movie.",1110931200,,2406,4.71462829736211

Watching movies such as 'Unbreakable' almost makes one forget how magical movies can be.

The plot is fascinating, particularly to comic book buffs; it's not kid's play to make the numinous world of paper heroes and villains so utterly credible that I nearly found myself rooting for a superstar myself.

But after pregnating its context with such orgasmic crescendo, Unbreakable defies its name and goes *poof* in the last five  minutes. It all ends too soon, too predictably. A raging retard could see it coming a mile away.

Shyamalan's films are characterized by being plodding and moody, always with a ""surprise"" ending. Well, sorry, what he conceives of as being profound and clever, I see as lumbering and predictable.

There are people whose films I like, those whose films I admire, those whose work I admire more than I like, and those whose work I like more than I admire.

""The Sixth Sense"" was such a tremendous success, expectations are ridiculously high for Shyamalan's other efforts.  This is at least part of the explanation for the horrid reviews some give ""Unbreakable"", which I feel is well written and well acted, with an ending that caught me more off guard than the twist ending of ""The Sixth Sense"".  The idea of a whole film dedicated to a character's discovery of his extraordinary powers (as opposed to covering that ground in 10 or 15 minutes) is clever, and Shyamalan handles the premise brilliantly.  Bruce Willis again turns in a strong performance, and Samuel L. Jackson is excellent as well.  There are some powerful scenes in ""Unbreakable""- the hospital scene is excellent, and the staircase scene proves that Shyamalan is a film student who took his lessons to heart.  Just as ""The Sixth Sense"" is a ghost story that's ultimately not about the ghosts, ""Unbreakable"" is a superhero story that, in the end, isn't about super powers.

The movie moves a little slow and it's been pointed out to me that since I used to collect comics the movie is more appealing to me, although I don't think that has anything to do with why I like this movie.

The movie is an expression of Bruce Willis's character.  The slowness and darkness of the movie emphasize his dissatifaction with his life- that he hasn't found his purpose.  The idea of the movie centers around the concept that fictional heros are an exaggeration of real people and that superpowers are an exaggeration of human instinct.  The movie picks up as Willis begins to find meaning in his life.

The only reason that I did not give this movie five stars is because of some of the questionable angles and shots M. Knight Shyamalan used that I thought detracted from the movie.  Other than that the movie was brilliant.",1104105600,2,978,4.4858757062146895

The film is dark, and yet it contains some important themes - just like all of Shyamalan's work. I think the theme of this movie -- if I can borrow a line from another great superhero film -- is ""with great power comes great responsibility. Willis' character evolves as he begins to accept his incredible skills, and finally comes to peace with his life.

Bruce Willis gives one of his sleepiest performances as a security guard,who has unbreakable bones and seems to be able to sense bad people.

Samuel L. Jackson is the opposite in that he was born with incredibly weak bones and goes through life constantly in and out of hospitals with fractures.  His one solace in life is comic books.  Jackson is obsessed with finding his opposite and he does this by looking for survivors of disasters.  He seeks out Willis, who is the sole survivor of a train wreck.  We later find out that Willis has never been sick and he may have survived some other disasters as well.

You keep expecting Jackson to ask Willis for a bone marrow transplant or some other type operation to strengthen his bones but Jackson's motives are inspired by the comic books that hold his fascination.

The director seemed to miss some opportunities in the movie.  We have a scene at the beginning, where Willis tries to pick-up his female seat mate on the train and then after the train wrecks, we know that she is dead so you later expect something more out of Willis and his feelings.

Jackson also comes off as a loony throughout the film and you wonder why Willis ever talks to him at all.

There is one brilliant scene, where Jackson is trying to sell a comic art print to a man and goes through the whole history behind the print.  At the end of Jackson's passionate rendition, the man says he will take the print to give to his 4-year old son (who obviously would have no sense as to the value of the print).

1293390,4,B00003CXQA,"Their are many theories as to why this film failed to have the impact that ""The Sixth Sense"" did with audiences.  I will be the first to admit that there was no way that M. Night Shyamalan could have caught lightning in the bottle with this film.  ""The Sixth Sense"" was a phenomenon and audience expectations were too high for this film.  I remember this film had a targeted Thanksgiving release date and it was probably rushed to theatres before the kinks in the story could have been ironed out.  It's obvious from the get-go where the story was going and the abrupt ending didn't help matters.  All that aside, I like this film alot.  Shyamalan is a master at mood and developing tension and it is apparent in this film.  Shyamalan does not so much copy the masters(Hitchcock and Spielberg) but pay homage to them.  Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson give superb performances here.  This is a good time to revisit this film now that it is divorced from the hype and expectations that it engendered on it's initial release.",1099699200,,1025,4.587912087912088

But like most modern comic books, unlike the black-hat white-hat ones of yore, this comic book hero has shades of gray and vulnerabilities, though his body has undergone terrifying changes.

The homage to comic books is much better done than in Kevin Smith films.  At least it captures more of the artistry rather than adolescent obsession.  Still, isn't it an adolescent's dream to be invulnerable?  Not when it comes at a terrible price...",1098835200,,584,5.159574468085107

1293393,5,B00003CXQA,"This film is NOT about comic book heroes. It is NOT about the ""battle between good and evil"" or even, as the writer/director describes it to us, ""the believer vs. the non-believer"". NO!  It's about a disorder which Mr. Shyamalan describes with such detail in this movie that one wonders how close he is personally to this pathology. After all, he has been described as an ""immature genius"" and as having ""grandiose"" ideas. These are two textbook characteristics of Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD). After reading over 650 reviews of this film, I find that no one seems to have made this connection - surprising since this pathology is estimated to exist at a 1% frequency in America (0.7% are male). I would recommend that all interested reviewers learn more about this! Go to Sam Vaknin's site, [...] He is a prolific reviewer in his own right on the Amazon site. Once you learn just a little about this disorder, you will instantly and unequivocally see the true meaning of this film and your understanding will enrich your appreciation. It will then make perfect sense. Shyamalan has succeeded in portraying a very difficult yet interesting alternate reality. In fact, he portrays it so convincingly that one may reasonably ask if he does indeed live with this disorder.

How does one portray in film the abstract experience of the initial narcissistic injury, the fragmentation of the young ego (Elijah Price) [occurring by 24 months of age], the pain and anger that causes that damaged self to retreat forever into the unconscious, the creation of the soulless ""false self"" (i.e., David Dunn), and the lifelong failure in love and relationships, including the difficulty in maintaining a job?

In ""Unbreakable"" the rather detached and indifferent mother of Elijah gives birth to a child who onlookers see as being ""fractured"".  This is the beginning.

Cut to the present where we find David Dunn (B. Willis) on a train ashamedly ogling a young woman and showing deceit by hiding his wedding ring. [Ns, i.e., those with NPD of the somatic variety, are sex addicts with shame attached and are always charming and inveterate liars. This is manifested as extreme exaggeration in order to depict the desired image.]  His conversation with the woman on the train reveals signs of the illness. Ns have difficulty communicating, often saying the wrong thing at the wrong time, or mumbling unintelligibly, and then trying to fake their way through or turn the conversation around. Of course, one wonders if in fact David was actually aboard the train at all or whether this was merely a fabrication aimed at boosting his sagging self-image as the omnipotent, omniscient, and omnipresent ""God"". After all, there were no survivors to say that he wasn't aboard.

I would surmise that David is in a phase of his illness where he is finding that his false ego is just not securing him the narcissistic supply that it once did. He is experiencing the depression concomitant with the ""grandiosity gap"", that is, a realization of the disparity between his carefully crafted self-image of omnipotence and the current reality of his situation, as reflected by those with whom he comes into contact. The accompanying pain and confusion is causing him to seek other means of acquiring his required fix for adulation and admiration. He's certainly not getting this from his wife any longer. She is the textbook picture of a victim of this disorder - confused, seemingly stuck in her codependent role with him yet sensing that her love will never be requited. His indifferent behavior has left her devastated emotionally. She never says anything that will question or challenge him. She has learned which topics he can tolerate and which ones are best avoided. She did not ask, ""What happened on the train David?"" but rather, ""What happened in New York David?"" Perhaps she knew that he was not in fact on that train.  When she asks him if he's slept with anyone since their troubles began, he says ""No"". This is most certainly a lie and yet she, like most NPD victims, falls for it and decides to give him yet another chance, as most do. She wants it ""to be like it was in the beginning."" Again, this is the typical reason why the wives and girlfriends of these men hang on as long as they do. They are always chasing after the man they met ""in the beginning"" when the false ego charmed and captivated them. His son Joseph, chronically neglected by his dad, is headed in the same direction emotionally as David's wife. [Most offspring of Ns usually grow into dysfunctional adults unless the non-N parent can fill in the gap.] We see that with his new reputation of ""having survived an unsurvivable catastrophe"" the son is now in a position to provide David with a new source of narcissistic supply.

Another important hallmark of this disorder is ""magical thinking"". To be considered extraordinary and invincible, David has ""special powers"".  He can feel the ""evil"" about him. He can see danger. Those with NPD describe themselves as having ""perfect insight"" into others and a gifted intuition. Since in an Ns reality he sees ""others"" as mere objects in ""his universe"", it stands to reason that they can read others' minds. Similarly, since an N lives in fear of being used or taken by others, he ascribes that emotion to the objects within his sphere, in other words, he projects. We see David becoming increasingly paranoid in a very dark world - a world that isn't working the way it used to. This is his internal world, reflected in the somber, depressive, and emotionless cinematographic treatment. Although occasionally David may be right (50/50), towards the end we see his ""special"" instincts betraying him. Many reviewers described David as ""the ordinary man"" and perhaps, at this point in time, that's what it looks like. But be assured that David sees himself as anything but ordinary! His very life depends on his being extra-ordinary and unbreakable. Ns are self-deprecating in order to maintain the illusion of charm and downplay their arrogance - but this is a false face!

Those with NPD are most likely to seek professional help when they are experiencing the pain of the ""grandiosity gap"". This may be the one time that the unconscious ego has a chance of being felt. The unconscious, the true ego that was fractured and retreated in childhood, Elijah (S.L. Jackson), is seeking his other half. It's his last chance. He is looking for his counterpart - the one who never gets hurt emotionally. He wants to rejoin that part of himself.

After the train wreck and the tableau of the anguished family life, we cut to a scene in the ""young David's"" life, in the form of Elijah at a carnival. It is here that Shyamalan tells us how the protagonist came to suffer from this disorder in the first place - the overprotective and smothering mother. When Elijah, told all his life that he is fragile and dependent, is for once daring to enjoy the autonomy of taking a tilt-a-whirl ride, his mother comes absolutely unhinged. She cannot bear to see her son experiencing his own self-efficacy, apart from her. She screams in anguish; he gazes into the sky, shatters, separates, retreats, and that true self hides forever, unactualized, and protected in David's unconscious mind. He never had the chance to develop normal narcissism during this critical ""window period"" and so he must invent a false ego, a superficial persona, here in the image of David Dunn.

At the funeral of the train victims, David talks to the priest about his football days (many Ns embrace and are quite successful in competitive sports such as football) and reiterates his special status as ""sole survivor"". The priest most certainly insults him by attributing this to ""luck"" rather than divinity. David inappropriately complains that his watch was broken in the crash, sharply insensitive to the fact that the priest's nephew was killed in the crash. [The most obvious and ruinous manifestation of NPD is the incapability of empathizing with others.]

Elijah persists through the hero mythology of the comic book and pitches his cause to the super-ego in kind. However, as with all Ns, David is highly suspicious of Elija's underlying motives and assumes that he is merely out to get him, to take what is his, even though he does admit to ""not feeling so sad"" that morning upon wakening. Still, Elijah incurs another severe narcissistic injury and falls shattered back down into the unconscious as David works desperately to restore his grandiose image by lifting weights in front of his adoring son.

Suddenly, his wife, still a stranger to him [Ns can never experience intimacy and always maintain their distance], asks him to dinner and he asks her if her therapy clients ever jump several levels unexpectedly to which she replies ""Yes, they sometimes do, but they usually stop out of fear of the shadow of their limits"". [Fear and denial are usually what prevent Ns from ever seeking therapy.] Interestingly, David's wife, Audrey, is managing Elijah's recovery. Later in the film, Audrey asks him if he knowingly pushes her and Joseph away and he says yes. [A key characteristic of NPD]. Another feature worth noting is that David and Audrey always seem to be on the verge of breaking up but never actually do. Ns will never formally break up. They have short memories when it comes to that sort of thing since only the Ns victims truly ""experience"" a problem.

David's concept of self-superiority crumbles further when he learns that he had to be rescued from drowning at a very young age. The son, Joseph, confesses that he isn't like his father, that he can get hurt and feel pain [something that Ns can't do]. When David, through self-discovery, determines that he faked his injury in the car accident, Elijah tells him to ""go where people are"". This is what Elijah's mother told him as he was withdrawing. [Ns typically withdraw from society as a matter of self-preservation]. Elijah further assures him by saying that it's alright to be afraid; a fear that Elijah knows David must feel and survive. He wants him to look back and see the damage, the devastation, and the pain that he's caused in his life, to acknowledge it, to take responsibility. He is baptized into a new life through the water, his only vulnerability. The dead woman who falls during the rescue scene is Audrey. He brings her back to life and holds her and says he just had a bad dream. The next morning though, he solicits narcissistic supply in the form of hero worship from his son by pushing the ""savior"" article at him.

The archenemy is the one who fights the hero with his mind. This is exactly what David is doing. The fact that Elijah still exists is a miracle because this disorder is considered incurable and there are no medications for it. In the end, Elijah sees the beginning of the reintegration of the ego and shakes hands to symbolize this. In fear and stricken with paranoia, David sees Elijah as a threat and the perpetrator of all evil. Projecting his own evil onto the objects about him, David is panicked by the reflection he perceives and asks tearfully as his false ego cracks, ""What have you (I) done?""

1293493,5,B00003CXQA,"There are some out in the world that say that comic-books are humanities? last great link to the ancient art form of expressing messages and stories through pictures. Since the dawn of human civilization when cavemen drew on walls to showcase fantastic, possibly even exaggerated, achievements of the people of the era, man has sought to express stories of ?heroes?, whether they be true or legendary, through the use of pictures so that other people in their travels through the land would know of that person?s great achievements and spread them throughout the tribes. In the centuries that would follow, this method of communication would be passed down to the ancient Egyptians who would develop the pictorial language which they would use the walls of their temples to tell the legends of their gods and their deceased rulers. Even to this very day this language art form can be found in the average comic-book shop but the surge of comic-book franchises quickly being adapted to the big screen can lead to its demise, with more interested in the aspect of profits rather then the messages their art expresses.

The story centers on a man whose survival from a tragic train accident begins to unravel a mystery into who he actually is and what he was destined to do with his life. While on a train ride from New York, which he had gone to seeking a higher-profile security position, to his home town of Philadelphia, David Dunne contemplates on his life and wonders why he has this inscrutable feeling of sadness, one of which he finds himself with each and every day of his life ever since a near-fatal car accident years ago brought a direct halt to his college football career. With a flash, David finds himself lying on a bed within a hospital with no clear understanding of how he got there. After receiving strange looks from doctors and nurses checking in on him, David discovers that he is the lone survivor of a tragic train accident that took the lives of one hundred and thirty-one people. Not only that but after careful examination there appears to be not a single scratch, bruise, or mark on David?s body. David begins to fall deeper into seclusion and sadness contemplating on why he alone survived the train accident but so many more fortunate innocents did not. Why was he special? After attending a memorial offered to those who died in train accident, David discovers a note on the windshield of his car that asks the question, ?How many days of your life have you been sick?? After meeting with the mysterious Elijah Price, who Dunne first dismisses as a man who?s sickness (low protein that makes he?s bones easily breakable) has taken over his sanity, David takes the opportunity his survival from the train accident has given him to patch up the relationship with his wife and son. But the more David puts off the eccentric comic-book curator, Elijah Price, the more the truth behind the great mysteries of his life is revealed to him, in that the David may be one of the great ?superheroes? Elijah?s comic books once harkened about. The story for Unbreakable may not have had quite the impact director/writer M. Night Shyamalan had been hoping for in its initial release and that may be attributed to the fact that it was created well before its proper time. For those who witness the magnificence of this film will find its thought-provoking concepts of heroes and villains, both in the comic-book world and how those are reflected in every day life, absolutely chilling, more so when one factors in the film?s pre-9/11 release.

As with most M. Night Shyamalan films, the cast of Unbreakable, namely those who?s screen time consisted of more then a mere cameo in the film?s nearly two hour timeframe, is remarkably limited with the course of the film?s story centralized on the actions of two characters that of Bruce Willis? David Dunne and Samuel L. Jackson?s Elijah Price. Bruce Willis? performance is nothing short of spectacular but even that heap of praise may be selling his role short. In essence, Willis takes on the type of role his co-star in The Sixth Sense, Haley Joel Osment, dealt with, that being a character that is so sensationally challenging and complex that only the most talented of actors can pull off the role. Not only does Willis have the play the role of the victim early on in the film but he has to seamlessly transition from that aspect to that of the rising hero by the film?s end, which not easy to do in any film and even more difficult with a script as intricate as Shyamalan?s. Samuel L. Jackson does a magnificent job in the role of Elijah Price, the mysterious comic-book artwork curator who uses his knowledge of the comic-book universe to reveal to David Dunne his true identity. The reason his role works as well as it does is the way both Willis and Jackson play off each other and how the character, while in the process of helping Dunne realize who he is, hints at the secret identity he has held back from everyone including himself. The only complaint came from Robin Wright Penn?s role as the wife of David Dunne, none of which concerned her particular portrayal of the character but rather the way she was scripted. Either she?s too whiny or she?s sitting idly in the background contributing nothing to move the story along. If were given more to do or she had a greater impact on who David Dunne will become by the end of the film, we would care more about her character but that doesn?t exist in the film audiences are seeing now.

Overall, Unbreakable was greatly underappreciated at the time of its late 2000 release but since then the traumatic events that occurred on September 11th, 2001, as well as the realization that America is, and has been, in a war to combat terrorism, not only in our country but abroad, have made this film of greater significance to see in this time of our nation?s history. Triggered by those events, Americans have awakened to the truth, much in the same way David Dunne did, that ?there are extraordinary things inside themselves, as well as others? and we need not look far and wide to find ?supermen? when they live amongst us in our daily lives. Shyamalan demonstrates an increasing sense of maturity both in the script?s sophisticated dialogue as well as in the style in which he sets the complex group of characters. The rising director never ceases to amaze his audiences with the haunting atmospheres in which he set his films and the driving messages he invokes within in each and every one of them. All that can be said about this film is that it the Shyamalan?s best film to date, though Signs does come pretty closes to matching up with it based on overall satisfaction and quality. For those who have been significantly effected by the events of September 11th, whether you be a family member of a victim or simply another average American horrified watching the aftermath, Unbreakable the definitive film to raise your hopes and show to you that there are ?heroes? all around us, some whom need only to know it within themselves for that ?hero? aspect to find its way through their actions.",1090454400,,7118,4.706495589414595
1293494,4,B00003CXQA,"Ah, the dreaded ?sophomore project?.  Director M. Night Shyamalan?s second big feature film had me hoping for the best but fearing that the typical pattern would prove true with Unbreakable.  This time the director explores the transcultural hero mythos, which according to the film?s logic is preserved in our modern culture through comic book stories.

David Dunn is a security guard with a wife and kid in a big city.  He seems quite ordinary, and probably never would have suspected the truth about himself until a key event changed his life forever:  he survived a devastating train wreck.  In fact, he was the only survivor, unscathed.  There is no logical explanation for how he escaped a mutilating death, and from that point on he is on a mission to track down the answer to Why.  In the process, he meets a rare comic book dealer who explains the universal structure of the guardian/hero archetype told through stories around the world:

Heroes ? appears ordinary to the world, but cannot be killed by ordinary means, exceptionally strong; life?s work is to protect the weak and innocent of his time.

Villains ? opposite of the hero, but often very close to him, best friends even; life?s purpose is destruction and/or domination. It becomes clear that David was indeed born to be a hero ? but then, who is his opposite terrorizing the city anonymously?

I though Unbreakable was a nicely shot in a moody, Film Noir style.  Solid performance by Bruce Willis, who is so very well-cast as an Everyman type who wakes up one day to realize who he really was all his life.  Samuel L. Jackson is his unforgettable counterpart Elijah, the comic bookstore owner -- superbly played. Just slightly slow pacing drags the plot a bit in places, but it is redeemed by a nice twist or two.  I would say that overall, this was a much better-than-average sophomore project for M. Night.

Recommended for fans of the dark and speculative genre.

Take comics and strip away the leotards, capes and unbelievable super powers and you end up with people who are amazing for believeable ""powers"". This concept is put into great contrast with the two main characters.

1293497,4,B00003CXQA,"I agree that this could've been much better but it is still a great movie overall. This movie was written, produced, and directed by M. Night Shyamalan (Signs, The Sixth Sense). The main characters in this movie are David Dunn (Bruce Willis) and Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson). David is in a terrible train accident and he is the sole survivor without a single scratch on him. He then meets Elijah who thinks David is a hero. Specifically he thinks David's a comic book hero. Elijah tries to convince David and his family that he is a hero while David tries to remember his past. David remembers that he never was sick and he never had a broken bone which leads him to thinking he is a hero which then he becomes frustrated and doesn't really know what to think of at all.
The ending was surprising but you could kind of see it coming. I thought the ending was going to be really great but it turned out just to be good.
There are about an hour of special features on the second disc, which are great, but I was hoping there was more.
Special Features:
-Behind the Scenes with Bruce Willis (15 minutes)
-Comic Book and Superheroes with Samuel L. Jackson (20 minutes)
-The Train Station Sequence multi angle
-A short film from M. Night Shyamalan (3 minutes)
-7 Deleted Scenes all introduced by M. Night Shyamalan (30 minutes):
Elijah taken Away
Audrey in waiting room
David in shower
Elijah at fair
David with priest
Audrey calls David
Weightlifting in locker room
I figured they could have put a couple of the deleted scenes in the movie especially David with priest and Elijah at fair.

1293498,4,B00003CXQA,"Why? Cos you immediately compare the two! I've seen Sixth Sense a few times before this, and I knew there was going to be a twist to the film, just like Sixth Sense. So you're constantly looking out for the twist coming, and trying to second guess what is going to happen, or what could happen to the character. I found this ruined the movie slightly, I probably would have liked it more if I could have seen it from a fresh perspective.
It's such a shame that Unbreakable didn't do as well as Sixth Sense at the box office, cos it's an amazing movie to watch. It's fascinating to watch how it quickly reels the viewer - and how much you get annoyed when someone phones at the crucial moment! However, I did find it a lot slower than Sixth Sense, and I hated how it was rated a 12 - so much more could have been done, for example they could have actually shown the train derail, with a higher rating.
Bruce Willis seems to be a favourite of M. Night Shyamalan's, and quite right too! He's been terrific in both Sixth Sense and this, and once again, shows he's great with kids, since he's so great with the little guy who plays his son. He also has a lot less hair in this movie - which results in him NOT needing a hairstylist! Sorry, I found that really funny!
Samuel L Jackson just didn't look like his usual self in this movie. I dunno whether it was the weird, big hair or what. But his character was cool. What annoyed me at first, is when you see the baby/young Elijah, he's very much often reflected in glass. Stupid me, I didn't make the connection, cos his ""name"" is Mr Glass - as in ""the kids call me Mr Glass"". Purely cos he breaks easily. As a newborn, he's reflected in the mirror; as a young child, he's seen reflected in a blank TV screen; he leaves his calling card on the windshield of David's (Bruce) car; he's often seen reflected in the glass frames in his art gallery, and what I found strangest of all, his walking stick is made of glass! (Although it provides a pretty spectacular scene when he falls and it shatters). As I said I didn't make the connection, but instead, I thought it was to do with him not wanting to see himself, because of the Osteogenesis Imperfecta? Just the (strange) way I see things!
Unbreakable focuses heavily on comic books, including a funny scene, where Elijah brings them down around him, and then picks the one he wants! There's also a lot about colour in the movie, particularly, what I noticed, all the 'bad' guys are very often wearing bright colours, so look out for that if you can. (Oh, kinda giving the game away there!)
What I found annoying to start with, but then began to like, was the amount of 'important' stuff that was introduced upside down. It gets tedious trying to twist your head to see what the hell you're looking at! These included: the TV train wreck footage; Elijah's first comic book; the ""Keep Out"" sign guarding the train's wreckage; the silver gun with the black grip, which Elijah sees in the belt of the man with the camouflage jacket while lying on his back; Audrey in the car crash flashback and Elijah's face after he falls down the stairs.
This was a terrific movie, so don't believe all the bad reviews you see. If you get a chance to see it on DVD, go for it! I think certain scenes would have been much more effective on the big screen, particularly the train station scene.
Oh, and watch out for M. Night Shyamalan doing a trademark - appearing in the movie! He appears twice in this, as two separate characters. (He also appears in Sixth Sense, as one of the doctors tending to Cole)
Oh, and I did NOT get the twist! I never do.",1086825600,2,3623,4.337260677466863
1293499,4,B00003CXQA,"This is a quite good film which I am not sure of giving it 3 or 4 stars. It's quite simple.
The film itself is good (so it deserves 4 stars) but the comparison with ""Sixth Sense"" is irresistible, and then ""Unbreakable"" clearly looses the game. I will try to make my review not taking into account the ""prequel""...
""Unbreakable"" has good some great moments, mainly in the first part of the film. The scene into the train with Willis (David Dunn) talking to the girl close to him is memorable, as some dialogs with his wife (almost ex-wife).
The discovering of Willis' great powers with the aid of Jackson's (Elijah Price) knowledge of the world of comics is somewhat confusing, but the way we start to ""know things"" is correct. However, the scene of the son pointing his father with a gun is absolutely insignificant and out of context.
The real good thing is to see Willis and Jackson far from ""what-they-used-to-do"" in late 80's.
I was given advice of the absurdity of the end, but I don't think it's absurd, nave or even stupid. In fact, it's even logical but the way the information is given in the last few minutes is overwhelming, reduces its credibility.
All in all, it's a film that I recommend you, even more if you haven't seen ""Sixth Sense""...",1086480000,,1253,4.548672566371682
1293500,4,B00003CXQA,"I have heard people call this one of Shyamalan's weakest films. However I've got to disagree- if anything I found this to be among his most powerful. You've just got to recognize the mythic underpinnings. It all hinges on the fact that when profound evil manifests, the universe creates equally powerful good to even the balance and put things right. The universe crystallizes out a hero. Nor may a hero ignore his reason for being: he cannot deny the call.
But what if the hero finds himself in a mediocre age? What if a born hero is constantly taught that he is nothing special? What if society conspires to let his abilities go to waste? Indeed, what if his, or her, society denies the very possibility of the existence of a true hero? It would make no difference. Heroes come from a higher place for a higher purpose. They are the tools that the universe uses to put things right. They will find a way to awake to their true calling no matter what. The soul of a hero cannot be diluted by a weak and soulless society.
Willis is perfect as the ordinary man that slowly comes to realize that he is far from ordinary. The way that he slowly realizes that the only limitations on him are those imposed by his own doubts is most believable. Jackson's performance is equally believable as the dark mirror to Willis.
As for the special features, the mini-documentary on comic books and their meaning is quite good. I especially enjoyed actually seeing Frank Millar and Alex Ross talk about their motivations. And as most of the creators point out, the motivations behind the best comics are archetypical and mythological. They are the popular breakout of the power of myth in an otherwise profane and meaningless age.",1083974400,2,1714,4.641447368421052
1293501,1,B00003CXQA,"I turned on UNBREAKABLE on tv last night to see what the big deal was about after I saw some commercial hyping a new M. Night Shyamalan movie THE VILLAGE with a promise of a trailer during UNBREAKABLE.  I never got to made it to the THE VILLAGE trailer because UNBREAKABLE was unwatchable!
First of all, most train wrecks have survivors--lots of them--so one guy--in this case, Bruce Willis, of course--surviving a train wreck isn't really all that special.  (Now if this had been a movie about the sole survivor of a plane crash, THAT might have been interesting!)  Then the mystical stuff about the other guy--Samuel L. Jackson--his spiritual doppleganger who's always getting hurt is the same old psychic baloney from SIXTH SENSE, and by the time I got to Willis realizing that he's--of course--unbreakable--even a 1960s comic book fan like me had had enough.
Oh, and UNBREAKABLE is slow, has the old ""mysterious letter from nowhere"" scene, and is continuing proof that Hollywood has run out of ideas.  And after you've seen as many movies as I have, the best title for this one isn't UNBREAKABLE, it's UNWATCHABLE!!!

1293608,4,B00003CXQA,"There's only one thing I would've changed about the movie though. The fact that Bruce Willis acting was a little over done in this one. He was still good though. Overall, I liked the movie, and the plot of having kind of super powers a person isn't quite willing to accept yet.
David Dunn (Bruce Willis) is just a regular man. With very few words, he can express how he's feeling. But when he emerges from a deadly train crash without a scratch on him, he begins to wonder what's going on. He soon realizes that he's never had a sick day in his whole life going to back to the fact that there was a car accident with him in it where he also came out without a scratch. It seems David can't be hurt, or injured in anyway besides one acception that he can't go near water without practically drowning. When a strange, yet very delicate, comic collector (Samuel L. Jackson) is taking an interest on David as more and more strange things begin to happen as he finds out, he can know about other people, and their sins in the past by just a simple bump on the shoulder. When a murder becomes obvious on the mind of a worker in the train station, he sets out deciding to use his powers
I still give it four stars. the acting was a little off, but still four stars. M. Night Shyamalan delivers with another success. I think the best acting was done by Samuel L. Jackson who was the weird comic collector who was obsessed with David's supernatural powers. I liked it, and own it because anything as good and suspenseful as Unbreakable is definetely worth owning. Don't think twice about it either. What will Shyamalan think of next?",1082332800,,1624,4.380794701986755
1293609,2,B00003CXQA,"I sat down in front of my television the summer this movie came out on DVD and proceeded to subject myself to one of the worst movies I have ever seen, Unbreakable.
I watched Shyamalan's previous film (The Sixth Sense) and found that to be a one-time only movie... tried watching it a second time and it just wasn't able to keep me interested... this movie followed the same kind of guidelines... but watching it the first time seemed like a chore this time around.
The movie was paced so as to be compared to watching snails race. And the ""plot twist"" at the end when you find out who the villian is... didn't affect me at all. In fact, I was appalled at the simple and uneventful ending of this movie.
Long story made short: If you liked The Sixth Sense... you'll more than likely get into this movie. If you liked Signs (which I did... love that movie and believe Signs to be Shyamalan's crowning achievement thus far) it is a 50/50. I regret wasting the money on the rental of this movie though so... that's my 2 cents on this horrid movie.",1082332800,,1044,4.358974358974359
1293610,3,B00003CXQA,"After the overrated yet average ""The Sixth Sense"", Shyamalan presented another intriguing and different piece of cinema with this peculiar movie that gives a new perspective into superheroes` conventions. Bruce Willis returns for the role of the quiet, laid-back lead and shares the screen with Samuel L. Jackson`s enigmatic presence. Like the ""Sixth Sense"", ""Unbreakable"" also tells a mysterious slow paced story where and adult man has deep connections with a kid, but this time the plot is more interesting and original. The direction is terrific and certainly helps to create an absorbing and gripping mood and atmosphere, even if some scenes are too slow and unengaging. The score is adequate as well, as is the convincing and subtle acting. However, some energy wouldn`t hurt this movie, since it has few dynamic scenes given the overall slow rythm. And the ending is a bit anti-climatic and disappointing too, even if it provides a strange surprise. Still, for the most part ""Unbreakable"" works pretty well and suceeds as a very well-crafted and unusual story worth discovering. It`s also refreshing to watch a superhero that`s so distant from most of the cliches that are common within the genre.
Not a classic, just a good effort.",1080691200,,1239,5.108374384236453
1293611,4,B00003CXQA,"M. Night Shyamalan's followup to his blockbuster debut The Sixth Sense is regarded by many as a tepid piece at best.  While the idea was found to be creepy enough, the speed of the plot was taken to task and cited as the primary spoiler of the experience.  Although there is merit to the criticism, Unbreakable should be seen for what it is: a superlative exercise in concept and suspense.
Bruce Willis portrays David Dunn, an aptly named man whose given/surname appropriately reflect the prosaic ordinariness of his staid life; he's just a security guard, no exciting skeletons in his closet whatsoever (it seems).  His life takes a more kinetic turn when he is on a train that derails and gains a bit of fame for being the sole survivor of the wreckage.  This fact is noticed by the more exotically christened Elijah Price (brought to life by Samuel L. Jackson), a tragic figure who suffers from a congenital condition which renders his skeletal system as brittle as thin crystal.  Price is obsessed with comic books and their omnipotent characters because they represent the antithesis of his horrible physical limitations (which were conveyed effectively in a cruel scene where he tumbles down a flight of hard steps, his bones shattering like dropped china).  He has another obsession as well: he wants to locate a real superhero, for he believes at least one demigod walks among the human race.  He becomes convinced that Dunn is the one, and he wants this Clark Kent to find his inner Son-Of-Jor-El; Dunn naturally wants to ground such a flight of fancy, and he has a problem when his son- who also believes he's a derivative of DC magic- wants to test the hypothesis by shooting him (another powerful moment).  So...who's right?  Price; Dunn?  The conclusion is sinister in its revelations.
One thing which must be understood about Unbreakable is that it is essentially a film-school project blown up to multiplex-ready proportions.  The dark, somber tone is never ameliorated; the narrative maintains a consistent depressive feel at home in a budding Spielberg's thesis.  This is most likely what initiated the tentative reception; but the approach actually works, because the crucial elements of the story are allowed to become the focal point for the viewer, as opposed to becoming lost and diluted by an irresistable need to increase the commercial quotient.  Shyamalan keeps any idiosyncratic histronics at bay with the actors, a predeliction which has become his trademark; this also functions as a sterilizing agent, ensuring the purity of the drama by neutralizing any contaminating Hollywood habits.  The primary directive of the piece is wish fulfillment, a desire to take the phrase ""science fiction"" and truncate the latter term, to convert fantasy into reality, to make the dreams of a child as tangible and reproducible as a chemistry experiment; to be certain, that has happened before, the successful voyage to the moon representing a single example.  But we're probably not destined to land on every moon; nevertheless, Shyamalan crafted an engaging tale of one handicapped man's epic quest to touch down on his own personal Sea Of Tranquility.
Unbreakable is not a perfect film; indeed, there are one or two lapses in logic.  Still, it is worth a viewing.  One last note: it surpasses the attempts of Signs at allegorical fable-creation.",1077667200,,3363,5.030630630630631

What I'd like to point out are the aspects of the film that I found especially, well, special.  First off, David's son was moved by pride in his dad and frustration that he'll never be like him.  Poor kid.  Second, I was left wondering how they'll keep the secret from Mom if Dad will be diasppearing every night to go beat up bad guys, when she's so apalled by violence of any kind.  Third, IS David bulletproof?  Probably, given his resistance to impact and lacerations, even from razor-sharp metal and broken glass.  But we never know, and how could be possibly take the chance of finding out?  I hear this was supposed to have been expanded into a trilogy.  One may hope.",1077321600,2,759,4.442028985507246
1293613,5,B00003CXQA,"Capsule summary: Bruce Willis plays an ordinary man who does security work. After a devastating train accident somehow leaves him miraculously untouched, he is contacted by a mysterious man who  tells him he may not be ordinary at all, but so extraordinary that he can no longer lead an ordinary life. The truth is even stranger, and more frightening, than it seems at first.
Review (with spoilers): It is a rare thing to come across anything NEW in either the thriller OR superhero genres. This combination of both manages to do so for both. We start with a young boy, Elijah Price who is born with a terrible medical curse: his bones are so brittle that they can break under any significant strain. To motivate him to at least try to make as much use of his body as he can, his mother buys him comic books which he likes and places them on the playground across the street; Elijah accepts the challenge, and the comic-book world within...
... Years later, a devastating train accident occurs, leaving security worker David Dunn (Bruce Willis) untouched though nearly everyone else is killed. Elijah, who now runs a collectibles store focused around comic memorabilia, contacts David. It seems that Elijah, because of his incredible fragility (for which the neighborhood children have nicknamed him ""Mr. Glass""), formed a theory that the bell-curve distribution of human traits demanded that there be someone on the ""opposite end"" from him: someone virtually unbreakable, superhuman. Elijah (played as an adult by Samuel L. Jackson) is clearly somewhat nuts, yet there is a wierd and compelling power about him, and about the faith he has that there is a higher power motivating these events.
  David does not accept this theory at once, but eventually other odd coincidences force him to at least test this nutcase's ideas... and the test results are everything that Elijah expects, stunning even David and his son.
  In the end, David accepts that there is, in fact, some part of him driven to seek out and oppose true evildoers -- those who kill with pleasure and so on -- and in a dramatic sequence fights his first battle as a vigilante. Ironically, even though he does NOT go looking for some funny costume and tights, the outfit he wears works *AS* a superhero costume, even supplying him with an appropriate superheroic name: ""Security"".

  But the true shocker comes at the end, when we discover that, in order to FIND his superhero, Elijah has been CAUSING multiple disasters, winnowing through countless scenes of destruction to find the one unbreakable man or woman. The man we thought was playing ""Professor X"" to David's X-man life is, in fact, more akin to the Joker looking for his Batman. ""Mr. Glass"" could not be a superhero, so obviously he would have to be the villain -- and FIND a hero to oppose him.
  Will David ever play Hero again? Despite this shock, we don't know. I would guess... yes. The ironic fact is that Mr. Glass *WAS* telling the truth. There IS a special power in David, one specifically there for finding those of true evil intent, and he truly does have a strong drive to act on it. But what a dark and sinister origin to have....",1077148800,13,3300,4.7452006980802794
1293614,5,B00003CXQA,"While this movie is undoubtedly not the Sixth Sense, it's not supposed to be. In almost a completely different genre, Unbreakable focuses more on the dramatic than the suspenseful, and tell and an original and creative story in a compelling way. While the movie is slower than most, that's exactly the reason it succeeds in my mind. While most moviemakers would face the reality that moviegoers now EXPECT unbelieveable chase scenes, explosions, and impossible special effects, Shyamalan thankfully keeps the pace of the film consistent and eerily placid, providing the viewer with an uncommon viewing experience.
For those who didn't like it, I think it's only because they didn't have a slot to put it in. If you in a chill mood and have an open mind, this film will not only leave you satisfied, but thinking.",1076889600,6,812,4.934306569343065
1293615,5,B00003CXQA,"M. Night Shyamalan has done three mainstream films. ""The Sixth Sense"" which is a rehash of a twist that we have seen before. ""Signs"" which is a homage to B-Movie films and ""Unbreakable"". Unbreakable is Night's most original piece but actually has no meaning and there is nothing to take away from this one at all. However there is plenty you can BRING to it because of the nostalgia of Superhero movies of the past. Night does all of that here in a modern day reworking of these themes which is played out with a hint of realism. This sort of gives it more appeal and makes it less fantastic and thus closer to reality. I will not tell you the plot or anything about it because it will ruin it for you. When released the film was based on a ""man"" who is the ""soul-survivor"" of a ""trainwreck"". There was no mention of Superheros when this film was released.
Now that it is tagged with that in the product description I think it is safe to say that this is a movie about a Superhero coming to terms with his own powers in the modern world. It is a good flick and well worth watching if you like the nostalgia of this theme. The film does work. The final twist does say ... ""Unbreakable 2"" but it is more or less there just to play with us a little and broaded the scope of the superhero theme.

He is so good at making movies that I presume that one day he will make movies like that of Spielberg.  Bruce Willis was awesome, as always, and Samuel L. Jackson stole every scene that he was in from Willis.  The supporting actors gave good performances as well including Robin Wrigh-Penn as Willis's wife and Spencer Treat Clark as his son, who gave a very good performance at pointing a gun at Willis and bawling his guts out about shooting him to show that he was ""Unbreakable"".

1293617,3,B00003CXQA,"M. Night Shamalayan burst on to the scene with the incredible SIXTH SENSE.  He is obviously a young director/writer with a vivid imagination, and perhaps a little bit too much belief in his artistry.  His third film, ""Signs"" wasn't all that great, and this middle entry, ""Unbreakable"" suffers from too much artistic input.  Now that may sound crazy, but in watching the special feature in which Night discusses his deleted scenes, and especially in the inclusion of his first home movie, I felt that his ego is a little too much considering this movie.
I think the plot is very intriguing, and there are some wonderful shots, including the use of comic book colors to heighten the sense of unreality.  Bruce Willis and Spencer Treat Clark do a fantastic job in their roles; Willis is a lot better actor than many people credit him for.  Clark is an uncanny little actor, who can be seen in this year's excellent ""Mystic River.""  I found three major problems:  first, Shamalayan over-utilized his ""from a distance"" shots.  There were too many of them where all this activity is going on in front of the leading characters and it served no purpose to me other than artistic experimentation.  The other two things wrong with this movie, for me, were the lackluster performances of both Samuel L. Jackson and Robin Wright Penn.  Jackson has yet to enthrall me with his acting (having watched ""Sphere"" and ""Deep Blue"" recently.  Penn on the other hand has done some good work, but in this one, she seems unattached and disinterested.

Bruce's character's similarity with the character he plays in the Sixth Sense and the some-what bland relationship with his wife, although tense at the same time, was the reason I did not give Unbreakable a 5-star rating.

M. Night Shyamalan made one of the most popular horror films in history with ""The Sixth Sense"". But in my opinion, ""Unbreakable"" is his best film and extremely underrated. While people often criticize this film for being too slow, and hard to understand, it still continues to be one of my favorite films. The fact that the films move slowly, is what gives the film its brilliance. The events unfold at a pace that really lets you soak in the story and what the characters are going through. The story succeeds on five different levels. The first being the trouble with David's job as a security guard and his fight to find his place in the world. The second is the trouble with his marriage, and David's relationship with his wife Audrey ( Robin Wright Penn).The third is the endless need to proove Elajah's theory wrong. The fourth is with David's son Joseph ( Spencer Treat Clark) and how he thinks his dad is a hero. The fifth being what David does with his life, after he finds the truth. All of these aspects are blended together beautifully to create a well rounded story. M. Night Shyamalan is also known for his endings. The ending to ""Unbreakable"" will blow you away and is extremely shocking! Bruce Willis, Samuel L Jackson, Spencer Treat Clark, and Robin Wright Penn are all spectacular in their roles. Each bring an important part to the story and are equally captivating. Finally, the camera work, set designs, and use of color are amazing, and really bring the story to life.

1293681,5,B00003CXQA,"I first saw this movie in the movie theater and I have to admit that even though it kept me thrilled all the way, it just didn't appeal that much to me. It seemed slow, and as I didn't know what to expect, in the end it even seemed a bit silly. I wasn't dissapointed by the film but I didn't like it that much either. I believe that it was due to prejudism and due to the fact that at first I didn't understand the writer's point of view. Many people sounded dissapointed at the end of the film and all this negative fuss made me believe that the film wasn't that much.
  I write this article after having seen the film for a third time and knowing that it is nothing less that a masterpiece. Here I present some of the factors that led me to this conclusion:
 -The directing of the film leads to new directions and presents the facts clearly, with a slow but steady pace that increases in climax as the film progresses. I just admired in awe how the director perceived the scenes and presented them in film. Great - Great job!!!
 -Bruce Willis is great!! Samuel Jackson is even better!! Both of them are what make the movie unique and even though a good script can boost the actor's performance no-one can say that they both act nothing less that perfect!!!
 -It's a superhero film- But then it's not!! What I mean is that it's not Batman, Superman, Spiderman and all the kinda of superheroes you know of. Its the real superhero kinda of guy that really exists! He might live near you but you just don't know it. He doesn't know it. The facts are presented so well that you only have to be mind opened to accept what the writer wants to tell in his film. Nobody has done it before. Create a myth in a single movie out of nowhere. You just know that M.S. is not only a true talent but the teacher himself who knows what he does and you can trust him. Even though Signs that followed this film was weak because I believe the writer/director was in a hurry to end the film and didn't pay that much attention to the script, I can forgive him as he really doesn't have to prove anything.
 So don't play this movie for your father because he won't understand it! Watch it closely, and marvel each moment as you will surely do if you like mystery films that hide the supernatural. If you don't then it is almost certainly that you won't like it as you din't like Batman, Superman, The Crow etc.",1066521600,,2388,4.248898678414097

1293683,4,B00003CXQA,"I saw this movie for the first time this weekend, and I'm still trying to decide whether or not I like it better than The Sixth Sense.
It has an unusual premise, in that it is really a 'reality-based superhero story'. It revolves around two men, one of whom is a 'middle-American' security guard whose marriage is on the verge of falling apart. The other is a man suffering from Osteo-Genesis Imperfecta, a disease that severely weakens the bones and causes them to break easily and often.
The second man, Elijah Price, has lived his life virtually out of comic books, and has come to believe that they are really exaggerated tales of ancient mythology which, in turn, are based on actual truth.
The movie is about Elijah's search for the type of person that he believes comics depict - someone whose life has been completely untainted by illness or injury, and whose senses and abilities range considerably above the norm.
He believes he has found his 'hero' in David Dunn, the sole  survivor of a train derailment. As he points out several times through the film (and this becomes a crucial point towards the end of the film), there had been 3 major disasters within a short period of time that had killed an enormous number of people, and only David had come away unscathed.
David is naturally sceptical to begin with, something that is aided by distorted memories of a serious car accident that he was involved in earlier in his life.
His son is less sceptical and, in his desperation to prove that his dad is something special, at one point turns a gun on him.
Through a series of incidences, David comes to the astounding realisation that Elijah was right all along, and there are a number of small, seemingly insignificant points that help to emphasise this.
For example, there are several references to the fact that David wakes up every morning with an inexplicable sadness. This is at first explained away as being regret at having sacrificed a star football career for marriage. It is not until after David puts his new-found talents to use by saving the lives of two children from a violent intruder that he comes to understand the sadness is, in fact, the result of not doing what he was born to do - help other people.
In tradition with Shyamalan's previous film, The Sixth Sense, there is a twist at the end of this film. Although it doesn't have as much impact as Shyamalan's spooky ghost story, it is still a stunner, nevertheless. Though I don't believe it would affect a person's enjoyment of the movie, I won't give the surprise away here.
I know this film did not get good reviews when it was released, but I recommend that people ignore the negative publicity and give it a chance. If you're capable of suspending disbelief, even to a small degree, then the premise of Unbreakable is not such a long stretch of the imagination.
And, it's a surprisingly enjoyable way to spend a couple of hours.",1065312000,,2916,4.640232108317215
1293684,4,B00003CXQA,"Unbreakable wasn't the best movie I've ever seen, but it was enjoyable. I've seen a lot reviews that show for the most aprt you either love it or hate it. I notcie a lot of these also seem to say things like ""you won't like this movie because I said so"" or ""you have no taste if you don't like this movie."" Getting a little irritated by this heavy-handedness, I'm going to try and write a very objective review.
The premise of this Shyamalan film revolves around the idea that comic book heroes are simply a distant memory of a time when great heroes walked the lands saving the innocent. They were given awesome powers to help them on this quest.
Certainly, there is some real world backing. Take a look at the ancient myths and legends of Greece, Rome, Japan, and the Native Americans. Abundant with exceptionally powerful heroes capable of superhuman feats.
David Dunn is a middle class security guard who is the sole survivor of a horiffic train wreck. He meets a man named Elijah Price who tells him this theory of heroes. The rest of the movie is about David coming to realize Elijah is right and eventually comes to a twist ending.
Now there were a few down points to this movie. The pacing, for example, was rather slow, I won't debate that. But I'm a patient man. I've seen much, much worse as well. Watch a couple episodes of Mystery Science Theater 3000 and you'll see films with directors who had no idea what pacing meant. Unbreakable looks pretty good in comparison, but that's just my P.O.V.
The seen in the kitchen with David's son and the gun could have been executed better. I won't disagree on that either. To be fair, that would be a difficult thing to make work. The son desperately wants to believe his father is a hero. It gives him faith and hope. It's not always easy to create something like that and mistakes do get made.
On the better points, I loved the soundtrack. It was unique and distinct while at the same time having a classic air to it. Shyamalan said he wanted a soundtrack you would immediately recognize as Unbreakable's and he succeeded.
The cinematography, lighting, and Shyamalan's trademark usage of colors and atmosphere also create a nice effect. He succeeds with those tricks in that they're executed subtly enough that you don't notice it unless you're actively looking for it. This technique is actually an influence for myself as a budding writer also experimenting with directing.
The twist ending, while not up to the standards of The Sixth Sense, did provoke a smile as the pieces fell into place. It made sense and provided a twist I really hadn't seen coming.
I applaud M. Night Shyamalan as a filmmaker. His approach is daring, innovative, and creative, something we don't see enough of in Hollywood anymore. If I have to listen to commercials for one more direct-to-video sequel I'm going to technicolor yawn.",1064966400,,2865,4.652859960552268
1293685,2,B00003CXQA,"This is an example of a film which had the potential to be on a list of my favorite movies. The idea is creative enough, Willis is essentially an indestructable superhero, Samuel L. Jackson is a guy trying to convince him of it... The film has great prospect but takes too long in getting to the point. When the pieces fall into place towards the end, it is clear that there IS no point to be made.
With the basis of a superstrong superpowerful man and another somewhat deranged comic book collector who tries to convince him of his abilities... it lays a good groundwork for a great movie. However... there is no real point in Willis doing a lot of the stuff that he does (i.e. the train station scene made absolutely no sense to me from a plot point of view). He could use his invincibility to his advantage but really, its about an hour of boring ""get to the point"" stuff.
The ending was what ruined the film. You spend the whole time watching it, thinking ""oh, gee, there's going to be some great climax!"" but in reality, the climax and nonexistand denoument of the plot is merely the viewer learning that Jackson's character was really as one-dimensional as he seemed.
Why 2 stars, then? The movie was well-made for what it was (great cinematography in particular), despite having a rather disappointing plot.",1064707200,2,1314,4.572033898305085

He also meets a man called Elijah(played by Samuel L.Jackson) that it's the exact oppost of dunnes,he was born crippled,and will change David Dunne's life forever!
As you can see,the plot offers something new,fresh and interesting,and the cast it's pretty good,featuring very well known stars such as Bruce Willis,Samuel L. Jackson and Robin Wright Penn.

1293738,5,B00003CXQA,"Underrated, in a word, is M. Night Shymalan's 3rd film. His first was a little-known film, the 2nd made big with Bruce Willis and Haley Joel Osment (The Sixth Sense), and this one reunites Shymalan and Willis, along with another screen legend, Samuel L. Jackson. It tells a strange superhero story, of David Dunn (Willis) who has extroardinary powers---he is the one and only survivor of a freak train wreck accident. Elijah (Jackson) is the complete opposite of him----he was born with all the bones broken in his body, somehow. And the plot is how Elijah tries to make Dunn believe that Dunn has superheroic powers.
  James Newton Howard's score only accelerates the movie into high-gear. Comic book fans loved it, as I did, because of Elijah's museum of comic book art, and his massive collection. To keep Elijah going as a child, his mother awarded him a comic book every time he walked around.
The Vista Series DVD is a true milestone of DVD. Boasting pinnacle sound with DTS and Dolby 5.1 tracks, as well as superior picture quality of 2.35:1, Shymalan also delivers with superb special features.

1293739,5,B00003CXQA,"""Unbreakable"" is written, produced, and directed by M. Night Shyamalan.  The film tells the story of David Dunn (played by Bruce Willis), who miraculously survives a train crash and suffers no injuries.  After this his life becomes intertwined with that of Elijah (Samuel L. Jackson), a man with an unusual disability.  Elijah's obsession with David drives the plot of the film.
""Unbreakable"" is a powerful drama--it's an intriguing deconstruction of the whole notion of the ""comic book superhero.""  Shyamalan does a superb job of weaving a paranormal storyline into the lives of characters who are fully fleshed and very real.
Jackson and Willis are an intriguing and unnerving screen duo.  Jackson's bold, operatic performance is stunning, and is perfectly complemented by Willis' subtle but equally powerful work.  They are backed up by some excellent supporting performances.
The DVD edition of the film is full of superb supplementary material.  Especially intriguing are the deleted scenes, which are preceded by fascinating commentary by writer-director Shyamalan.  This bonus material really illuminates the creative process behind this film and vividly shows Shyamalan's passion and craftsmanship as a cinematic artist.
In addition to being intelligently written and superbly acted, ""Unbreakable"" is a visually stylish film that is full of memorable images.  Like Sam Raimi's ""Spider-Man"" (a very different but also excellent take on the superhero genre), this film raises questions about heroism, destiny, choice, and how extraordinary people fit into the larger society.  In short, a fine film given an excellent presentation in the DVD format.",1053820800,4,1655,5.557768924302789
1293740,5,B00003CXQA,"In a time of Marvel movie madness, I still think to this day the best superhero movie is Unbreakable. There is nothing that keeps people interested and intrigued more than reality, which is what I think the Marvel movies lack.
Instead of becoming a hero through some mutation or genetic altering, David Dunn becomes a hero through self discovery and aid from his so called friend Elijah. David remains doubtful of his special powers and looks at it simply in tune conscious. David is unable to be injured and starts to discover this after a freak train crash in which 131 people are killed, and David is left the soul survivor. Retracing his steps through the past, David discovers his in depth perception of the people around him and being Unbreakable.
Villians always are stereotyped into always wanting to take over the world. Well the closest thing to a villain in this movie is Elijah. His only plan is to discover himself and find a place in this chaotic world.
I find this to be M. Night Shyamalan's best movie. Although i'm a big fan of Sixth Sense and Signs, I find this to be the most thrilling simply because raw interpretation of reality. I totally recommend this movie for anyone that are big fans of drama or suspense.

M. Night Shyamalan films are not clever, artistic or even original.  He tries to make his films unique but they fail even before the middle of the film.  Just look at his other film called ""Signs"".  Mel Gibson couldn't save that either.  Not even big names can help his movies.

It's a comic book movie but it doesn't look like one. Bruce Willis does not look like a super hero and this doesn't seem like a movie about a super hero. This movie is geared towards adults but is dumb enough for little kids. I doubt this would even make it as a comic book. If you're a comic fan go watch Spider-Man or Daredevil. If you're a M.

1293744,5,B00003CXQA,"When I saw unbreakble the first time in theatres, I was disappointed.  I walked in with pictures of ""The Sixth Sense"" in mind, and was foolishly expecting the same experience.
Unbreakable is not the same experience.
A year after I saw this film, I rented it on DVD, and gave it a second chance.
I'm glad I did.
Like ""The Sixth Sense"" I was expecting something with a quick, driving plot.  What I realized the second time around, is that a movie does not need ""speed"" to pin you to your seat.
Let me put it this way:
Unbreakable is more like a painting. You can't look for out of this world action sequences or flying bullets or heroes that leap out of the shadows wielding gattling guns.  A does not shoot into B to shoot into C to zip into D to gain a furious amount of momentum until it furiously races to Z.
Unbreakable's triumph does not come from ""quickness of plot.""  What it does, is make you see how beautifully ABCDEF AND G are all strung together like beads in a necklace.
It is a story of self-disovery, or learning your place in the world.  Comic books are just the skin for this theme, but they do work well.
It is a gradual realization.  It requires precise acting.
Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson pull it off.
Being that this movie is a ""work of art"" cinematography is extremely important.  They pull it off beautifully, too.  Watch the ""Train Station"" sequence.  You'll see what I mean, and you will want to watch that scene over and over agian. I did.
Let this movie sink in.  Look for the subtle things: way characters are dressed, colors of clothes and objects, camera shots that build suspense.
Notice how the final action sequence is not all that ""grand.""
But it is ""great.""  It hovers on that beautifull line between the believable and the unbelievable.  It is not unconvincing, like Spiderman.
Above all, watch this one more than once. Like a painting in a gallery, a collector will view their work over and over again.
This is what you need to do with this movie.
Are you Unbreakalbe?",1046304000,4,2011,4.449591280653951
1293745,5,B00003CXQA,"There is a notion that all of us have a particular talent or power within us, which must be used, defining our place and purpose in life. This is the central theme in M. Night Shyamalan's original film, ~Unbreakable~.
Do you wake up in the morning feeling a touch of melancholia or sadness, because you're not really doing what you're supposed to be doing - are you fulfilling your destiny?
David Dunn (Bruce Willis) certainly feels this sadness. When he miraculously survives a devastating train accident, the sole survivor, an eccentric character enters his life, Elija Price (Samuel Jackson), and reveals Dunn's true destiny. If you haven't seen ~Unbreakable~ Dunn's true calling will surprise you.
This theme is similarly explored in Shyamalan's other films - 'The Sixth Sense' and 'Signs'. In 'The Sixth Sense' a little boy must overcome his fear to fulfill his destiny - helping the dead resolve their unresolved issues on earth. And in 'Signs', a man of the cloth loses his faith, only to find it again after a series of life changing circumstances. However, ~Unbreakable~ has to be the most original of the three.
Shyamalan's talent as a filmmaker is without question - he uses certain techniques to create a suspense-filled atmosphere in his films that causes, for me at any rate, a visceral response.
Everything about this film, screenplay, direction, editing and the performances are first rate. ~Unbreakable~ is a five star viewing experience.",1045267200,2,1455,5.066666666666666
1293746,3,B00003CXQA,"I thought the premise was good (you can read about the plot in other reviews) but the execution poor. Willis walks through the story with a melancholia that would depress a rock. He was so empty of life and love and joy that I really couldn't care much about him one way or the other. If I had been his wife, I would have divorced him years before!
I also found it inconceivable that a grown man would have gone through life without ever being sick or injured -- and with obviously ""super-human"" strengths and abilities -- yet seem almost totally unaware of all of this (at one point, he has to ask his boss and his soon-to-be-ex-wife if he's ever been sick). Believe me, his mother would have realized something was unusual by the time he was 10!!!
Still, there was something intriquing about the whole thing, and the acting was fairly good (given the one note that Willis was restricted to). I did keep watching (I have a low tolerance for movies and give them only 20 minutes to prove themselves), so it wasn't a total waste. But it really never inched much above average for me.

1293825,4,B00003CXQA,"This one changed my opinion of Shyamalan.  I dismissed this guy as a total schmuck who found fame in making a movie that [take] the entire plot to ""Carnival Of Souls""(and ""Jacob's Ladder"" in a way).  I don't want to get off on my essay on all the reasons why ""The Sixth Sense"" was rotten, but I want you all to understand that I HATED Shyamalan about as much as I hate Don Henley(and that's alot).  Well, after his success with ""The Sixth Sense"", he could have gone on to do just about any movie he wanted.  Instead of making some multi-million dollar CGI filled, action packed ""scary"" film, he hits us with this bizarre little thriller that almost ventures into David Lynch territory.  I'm not saying that I now like Syamalan based soley on that principal..... I really did like this movie.  Sure, it's slow moving(but the best movies usually are), there aren't jump-out-of-your-seat moments every five minutes, and (this is debatable) there isn't anything really supernatural about it.  I guess I can see why people were let down by this.  I'm sure everyone was expecting this to be another ""Sixth Sense"" or even to top it.  Everyone seems to love that film more (God only knows why), but ""Unbreakable"", in my opinion, was a pretty clever piece of work.  At least it didn't [resemble] the plot of an older (and much better) horror film.",1042761600,,1338,4.63135593220339

  as for the dvd, some great features include a good behind the scenes, some cool deleted scenes and a documentary of comic books.  why comic books you ask?  because this movie is truly a comic book come to life in a movie setting.",1042416000,2,581,4.18018018018018
1293827,3,B00003CXQA,"Like most of Shyamalan's films, ""Unbreakable"" begins beautifully and cryptically. David (Bruce Willis), returning home to Philadelphia from a job interview in New York, survives - without a scratch - a horrific train wreck that kills everyone else.  He is tracked down by Elijah (Samuel L. Jackson) who suffers from a rare brittle bone disease that has left him crippled. Elijah proposes a reason for David's survival as well as his own breakable bones that gives David the creeps.  David wants nothing to do with this man whom he views as insane and who is, perhaps, a threat to his son.  Yet as events unfold, David cannot escape the idea Elijah has planted.
Willis' understated delivery is perfect for Shyamalan's style of cinematic suspense. Robin Wright Penn and Samuel L. Jackson follow suit with lines delivered so delicately and with such restraint that they contribute to the tension. The cinematography is brilliant, setting the mood with aplomb.  The strength of ""Unbreakable"" is not the plot but the relationships between characters - their dreams and disappointments, what keeps these people together and what threatens to break them apart.
The main flaw of the movie is the last fifteen minutes, when the revelation, which is clearly meant to blow the audience away, arrives with a flatness that will disappoint many people.  I, for one, saw it coming - and hoped I was wrong.  Or that Shyamalan would do something extraordinary with it.  Unfortunately, it was not to be.  If the ending had been handled with more care, this film definitely would have deserved four stars.

Elijah suffers from a rare condition that makes his bones extremely brittle.  He has a theory that comic book stories are echoes of real life, and gradually becomes convinced that David is his polar opposite, the real world's version of a superhero.
It's actually a fascinating premise, but it is executed so poorly that it's never made remotely plausible.  This is a flaw of the script, as well as the story itself which throws us coincidence after coincidence while leaving just as many plot holes in its wake.  For example, David develops further ""powers"" solely to move the story in the direction Shyamalan wishes it to go.  It is things like this that end up betraying it.

1293832,4,B00003CXQA,"Comparing The Sixth Sense to Unbreakable, and this is a fair thing to do as they share several plot and thematic ideas, finds Unbreakable being a sombre but ulitimately positive and affirming film.
There is considerable restraint in the acting with good use of body language and facial expression to a somewhat gritty to mildly surreal series of events. Bruce Willis plays a haunted, sole survivor of a train wreck. His character is bewildered and unsure of himself. This has been noted in other reviews but the road to understanding who and what he is drives the film.
Samuel Jackson's character is nicely set up through scenes of his birth and childhood. His character is a mystery, at once authoritative but physically fragile. As a man he is detatched and difficult to like although he commands interest. His life also reveals itself by the end of the film.
In general Unbreakable is about connections, paralells and contrast. It's dark and brooding look fits the story well. It is a slow paced film with a surprise ending that works and explains details of how the story came to develop. The film is quiet as well which also helps focus on the self descovery theme.
The acting is very good, Jackson has a knack for playing unique roles in big budget and modest films as well. For a leading man figure it is refreshing to see him shift to a character actor type of role where he can stretch his acting skills.
The shared items with The Sixth Sense are in the surprise ending, road to discovery themes, timeless sense and a host of smaller ideas that make both films similar except for their endings although both deal with coming to terms and being ready.
Since The Sixth Sense was such a success impossibly high expectations were made of Unbreakable, expectations that couldn't be lived up to due to the subject matter and concept of it's plot and characters. It strikes me that I've used the word character(s) quite a bit. Probably because they are interesting to watch develop.
The pace to Unbreakable is slow but not to the point of boring. Events unfold and mysteries develop. To a film audience that expects special effects and loud bangs every five minutes this is not a good DVD for you. If you enjoy films that can be viewed many times to pick up on elements missed the first go around then you'll probably enjoy Unbreakable.",1040515200,5,2338,4.677184466019417

I did not see this picture in the theater but rented it on a recommendation and I must say that I was completely fixated from the opening scene through the end. It was more of an experience than simply a movie. After watching it I was flooded with memories of being a kid and reading Marvel comics and remembering the experience of the superhero character.
If you loved comic superheros as a kid, you will remember their priviate pain, their broken relationships, their apathy and desire to be normal, their loneliness, rejection and finally their acceptance. This movie captures that aspect of the superhero character better than any other film like it.
This is not an action film. Some will find it slow. My wife didn't get it at all. But if you remember contemplating the private pain of Spiderman or the Hulk (or many others) as a child, see this movie. It captures what was and is best about superhero comics and how they are, in many ways, just like us (""I believe comic book heros walk the earth""). Flawed and relectantly brave, lonely and very poor with relationships but hopefully in the end, not without a purpose. (""The scariest thing is not knowing your place in the world"").
I commend the director and producers of this film for making an outstanding movie even though they most likely realized it was not for everyone. If only others would follow their lead.

His previous film, The Sixth Sense, was a surprise super smash hit and was even nominated for a Best Picture Academy Award.  The story of Unbreakable revolves around David Dunn (Bruce Willis), a lone survivor of a train wreck who emerges completely unharmed.  He meets an eccentric comic book collector named Elijah (Samuel L. Jackson) who has a bone disease which causes his bones to break very easily.  Elijah has a theory that the world of comic books is a near reflection of our very own world, and that he and David are on the opposite ends of the spectrum.  Willis and Jackson give superb performances, and Shyamalan's attention to detail-esque direction electrifies the pace of the film, but the meat and bones of Unbreakable is the way it is written; just as The Sixth Sense was more than a film about ghosts, Unbreakable is more than a film about super heroes.  This underlying theme, combined with the twist ending (although I can see how some viewers did not like it at all) make Unbreakable a superb film on it's own right.  All in all, if you can forget about The Sixth Sense phenomena for a little over an hour and a half and really think about this film, you will enjoy it for what it is and isn't.",1039564800,7,1302,4.491525423728813
1293901,5,B00003CXQA,"In this era of the comic-to-film tale of the superhero, few hit the mark. Burton's ""Batman"" is arguably the best of the bunch, with Raimi's ""Spiderman"" coming in a distant second. However entertaining those films might be, they miss out on the most important part of the superhero story....the hero's discovery of their powers and why they were put on this earth. ""Batman"" just jumps into Bruce Wayne's story, ""Spiderman"" spends all of 10 minutes on Peter Parker's development of his powers. But in ""Unbreakable,"" it takes our hero approximately an hour and a half to learn of his powers and why he has them. Shyamalan has created an amazingly detailed and wonderfully slow-paced film that tells us who the major players are, why they are important, and why David Dunn is, or is not, a reluctant superhero. Many reviewers of this film feel that it is too slowly paced and that it doesn't pack the action of a 'superhero-type' movie. This may be true, but this was just the first film in a proposed trilogy of films that Shyamalan would like to do about these characters. If this so-called trilogy is made(both Willis & Jackson have reportedly expressed interest in completing it), then this film will be seen in a whole different light. As it is, I think this is Shyamalan's best film. Sam Jackson's portrayal of 'Mr. Glass' is quite powerful, he gets you to feel sorry for him before you find out the truth about his condition and why he is so interested in David Dun (Willis). The sheer gloom and murkiness of this film make it one of my all-time favorites and I love the fantastic camera work in this picture. Not really a film I would recommend to non-comic collectors. But for those of you who digs them as much as I do, please dive right in!(No pun intended) A great film that has strong performances from all involved and gives the viewer that fantastic jaw-dropper of an ending.

Together they meet, and it is true that Bruce, as a security guard at a football stadium, does have some strange powers. He can visual a man or woman carrying a weapon or drugs when they just brush up against him. He is frightened by Samuel L. Jacksons insistence that Bruce is some kind of super hero, like in the comic books that Samuel collects, but he begins to believe it as things happen that have no other explanation. It is the twist at the end that will amaze and stun you. A well written screen play with excellent actors - it's a dynamite combination.",1036972800,,1095,4.425742574257426
1293904,5,B00003CXQA,"Shyamalan and Willis said Unbreakable was intended as the first part of a trilogy. However, Shyamalan confirmed that the plans for an Unbreakable trilogy have dwindled down to: maybe. I wish he would reconsider.
This film, ESPECIALLY when viewed as the opening of a trilogy, sets up the world and its characters remarkably well. Signs was nowhere near as refreshing as Unbreakable, but everyone considers Signs to be his comeback, after this ""failure"". It's a shame.
I think Unbreakable would be viewed in a different light if Shyamalan would complete the trilogy, and I'd really love to see what he has in store for the characters.  Until that day, I'll have to keep putting up with these silly Spiderman and X-Men sequels.  Sigh.",1034380800,,731,4.934959349593496
1293905,5,B00003CXQA,"This is not a typical movie. Most movies made nowadays seem to be content to merely photograph what is happening, not caring to a great degree about the use of color and the placement of objects and people on the screen (you know, cinematography). Well, that problem is definitely not to be found in this movie. Truly it must be watched over and over again to fully grasp all the subtle hints being tossed your way by the director. For instance, in Unbreakable green symbolizes good, and purple and orange symbolize evil. So throughout the movie, you might want to keep an eye on the color of the environments, and the colors that different people wear. Many of the scenes with Mr. Glass start by us seeing him through a reflection of through a glass window. And then there's the whole comic book aspect of the movie. If you look at the entire movie as one issue of a comic book, the angles used, the use of lighting, and the things said by characters all take on a whole new meaning. I have seen this movie 4 times so far, and I'm sure I'm still missing a lot of the movie. For people who love a good story, a different twist on traditional movie-making, great cinematography, or just a good old comic-book movie, this is a must see. Or if you're a hard-core film fan, a must-buy.",1034121600,5,1281,4.409282700421941
1293906,3,B00003CXQA,"I don't know what all these other people were watching, but I didn't gat that much out of this film. It was very slow. There were some parts that made you think, but overall, it was slow and only vaguely interesting.
This film leaves a little to be desired if you are looking for something a little believable. Bruce Willis is nowhere near as animated as he normally is. Very subdued. Samuel Jackson does his role well, but not up to par with what you's expect.
This film appears to be a low budget way to get some money based on the leading characters names alone. I'm glad I did not see this in the theatre. Don't take me wrong on this, the film is not terrible, it's just not good. It's watchable, but nothing that you go to work the next day and tell all your friends about it and compare notes. It's just another movie.
The real surprise to me was that the DVD was a two disc set. Special features... There was no action, no special effects, not even a complex story line. What special features were there? I was so disappointed in the film, that I didn't even put the second disc in. I thought about, but...  There were no scenes that I was interested in seeing again.
Anyway, it's worth watching, but not keeping. Save your money and buy a good action film.",1033948800,2,1264,4.310924369747899

All the other reviewers listed enough information to tell you exactly what you are getting when you watch this movie... so all I will add is that it is (1) intense, (2) entertaining, (3) intellectually stimulating, (4) spectacular!  I loved this movie, which had the slow intellectual thriller-style of The Sixth Sense.  This movie will stimulate your mind and make you think about some unusual issues, while keeping you on the edge the entire time.  The end really shocked me, and I won't get into that... but you'll be surprised... and even the most intelligent and insightful viewers won't catch onto this one!",1032739200,,692,4.888888888888889
1293908,5,B00003CXQA,"This is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time.  A significant factor, for me, was that I had no idea what this film was even about until I watched it.  So, if you don't know anything (or much) about the movie, just stop reading all the reviews and pick yourself up a copy and watch it.

This movie is a thriller in a sense, but it is far from the tired old one-script thrillers we are used to (you know the plot of all those other shows: There is a hero and a bad guy, the bad guy, for some reason, has a personal vendetta against the good guy and vice versa.  The bad guy kidnaps the good guy's wife/child/friend/grandmother and uses the victim as bait to lure the good guy into a trap.  The good guy knows its a trap, but goes in anyway, frees the bait and kills the bad guy... how many times have we seen this over and over and over.  I'll give you a hint... they do this because teenagers who can barely read are the big spenders in thriller movies).

In unbreakable, there is little in common with other thrillers.  The tension, along with the characters, is built slowly so that the viewer is drawn more personally into the show.  The script is fascinating, the direction is flawless.  The acting was great too.  I was never a Bruce Willis fan, but I thought he was surprisingly good in Sixth Sense, and he's not far behind in Unbreakable.  Samuel L. Jackson was very good here.  After the Star Wars movies, I forgot that he could act, but found new faith in Unbreakable.  This was one of his best films.",1031875200,6,1520,4.232638888888889
1293909,5,B00003CXQA,"I think M. Night Shyamalan has proven that he is one of the most talented new directors today. The Sixth Sense is truly awesome, and Signs is his masterpiece. Unbreakable is definitely the lesser of the three 'big' movies Night has made, but that isn't saying it is a bad film. It's just a testimony to how good Signs and Sixth Sense are. Unbreakable is a great film itself. Bruce Willis and Samuel Jackson give great performances. As always the visuals (especially color) play a huge role in the telling of the story. And there is Night's twists at the end. The movie is shown in what can only be called a comic book style. I don't mean overdone or campy, but the colors, camera movements, everything about the film suggests a comic book feel. It's really a well done movie, and like his other movies, one that has to be watched many times to get it all.
The dvd is packaged in an elegant slip cover, 2 disc edition, with a replica of Alex Ross's art. There is no commentary track, which is a shame. Filmmakers like M. Night Shyamalan, David Fincher, Tarantino, and the Coen brothers shouldn't be allowed to not have commentary tracks on their dvds. There is just too much going on and too much that is missed by not having commentary. What it does have is a behind the scenes featurette that is very well done (not like all those we've seen that are basically 20 minute summary/trailer). There's also a featurette that discusses comic books and superheros. There are storyboards and deleted scenes (and some great scenes were deleted from this movie).
What makes this film especially interesting is that instead of making a movie about a superhero, like most filmmakers would do, Night makes the movie about a man discovering he is a superhero. That's it. Simple, elegant, brillaint. M. Night Shyamalan will one day take his place amongst the great directors like John Ford, Alfred Hitchcock, Stanley Kubrick, Sergio Leone, Martin Scorsese, and Orson Welles. And The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, and Signs are just the beginning.",1031702400,,2028,4.731638418079096
1293948,5,B00003CXQA,"M. Night Shyamalan must be the director with the most popular first movie ever. The Sixth Sense showed his remarkable style, with which he returns to old fashioned movie making. Long, slow and silent scenes are his trademark which is a technique that just needs a good story, otherwise it doesn't work. But Shyamalan knows as no other how to keep the interest of the audience captivated untill the very last revelation, which comes, just like in The Sixth Sense, with a flash, at the end of the movie which just leaves the viewer speechless.
One of the greatest abilities of M. Night Shyamalan is that he can take a subject which has been used by so many writers/directors before and which has become such a cliche but still knows how to make something original out of it. And how unlikely the story might sound, it's done with such a feel of realism and emotions, that you just believe it's all real.
In his previous movie Shyamalan made us believe in spirits, wondering around in our world. Now, he takes the classic superhero story and makes it his own. But is David (Bruce Willis) a superhero? Or is he just an ordinary man, who gets brainwashed by a sick, dillusional man, who is basically sick his entire life, and as a result looses all boundaries of what it real and what is fiction.
As with all of Shyamalans movies, you have to find out yourself and should know as little as possible of the story before you watch it. But you have to understand, that it's a movie leaning on it's story. You have to get swept away by it, and don't anticipate any grand action scenes. Because you won't find them. You just know, while watching the movie, that you are watching something of great brilliance, but you won't be able to say why. You just feel it.
Once again, James Newton Howard delivered a terrific score and the cast is terrific (especially Samuel L. Jackson, he gives his best performance ever!) The movie also includes all the elements of a Shyamalan movie; you'll notice, if you look real closely, that everything with any importance is different.
Just know that this movie isn't as different and new as The Sixth Sense was. It's got the same atmosphere as The Sixth Sense, and contains the same elements (which causes a quick thought of the word 'formulaic') but is in a way also different. The greatest thing is that you know what kind of movie you've watched only at the very end. And then you know, or if you love the movie or not.",1031443200,4,2445,4.521444695259594
1293949,5,B00003CXQA,"Truly a film to divide audiences.  I've spent many an occasion arguing the merits of this beautifully crafted film with it's many detractors.
Too slow and self important for some Unbreakable is the rare film that I can watch multiple times.
Bruce Willis has never been better and Samuel L. Jackson is a revelation.  James Newton Howard's score is not only epic but memorable (are you listening Danny Elfman?).  Shyamalan's direction should put present day Spielberg to shame.
The Unbreakable DVD is a rarity in the fact that it's deleted scenes are far from useless.

If you are an insomniac, then you will love this movie. Otherwise, don't expect too much - although the last 15 minutes are the best of the whole movie.",1030752000,2,460,4.3604651162790695
1293952,4,B00003CXQA,"Unbreakable is an intense film. Cinematography was much more better than the sixth sense, and the story, even though its not really suspenseful, involves you right in it. It appears as if takes where much more planned, and the story more carefully planned. It really feels as if it were a comic book, and the technical aspects of traducing comic and story to film were kept impecable.
Regarding the special features, the deleted scenes are great, and thats about it.
I believe everything could have been kept in one dvd, butnow a days, studios prefer expanding everything to fit in as many dvds as posible.
The train station multi angle sequence just lets you switch between the storyboard and the real scene... i mean... its cool, but not something you buy a film for. The featurette is ok, and the documentary a little bit better, if you are a comics fan.
But all in all, this dvd is just great because of the movie.
Movie-wise, i give it 5 stars.
Special-features-wise, it gets 2 stars
If you are thinking of getting this dvd, i seriously recommend you do. Even if you won't get impressed by the special features, you will not regret it.",1030665600,,1140,4.620689655172414
1293953,4,B00003CXQA,"It's a classic scenario: average younger sibling is overshadowed by older sibling's greatness. No, I'm not talking about the plot to this movie; I'm talking about what literally happened to this film, only because it was born second. M. Night Shyamalan, who some call the next Steven Spielberg, got very lucky when his first big movie, The Sixth Sense, did as well as it did. Chilling, than surprising audiences with it's original plot and breathtaking ending, it became the golden child. Than Unbreakable came, was it bad? No. Was it good? Fairly. Was it as good as The Sixth Sense? NO. And that right there is your answer to why you heard that this movie was a complete waste of time and money. It wasn't AS GOOD.
  But so what. Every movie can't be amazing and if we're talking in terms of a normal, moderately interesting and somewhat well done film, than this one passes. The plot is great, the script is fine, most of the acting is good, some is terrific (Samuel L. Jackson is tremendous) there's really nothing seriously wrong with this movie.
  But in all fairness, I'll tell you what is. Bruce Willis, praised endlessly for his performance in The Sixth Sense, is sometimes a little too gawky and memorized. His astonishment becomes old fast, but he doesn't seem to realize that because there are very few parts of the movie where he doesn't act stupidly awed. Yes, his acting was sadly on the fine line between good and bad and tipping dangerously close to the later. But, the only other thing that I really thought was wrong was the darkness.
  Yes, I think there was a little too much emotional darkness. David Dunn (Willis) and his wife (Robin Wright Penn) are in the middle of a divorce, Samuel L. Jackson's character, Elijah, leads the most tortured, painful and joy-free life imaginable, and the ending involves criminal insanity, which is never pleasant.
  All this contrasts interestingly with the family aspect of the movie. The other side of the whole divorce thing and also Dunn's relationship with his young son - played by Spencer Treat Clark.
  So, basically, my point is, nothing is perfect. Who says that once a director makes a close to perfect movie, his next one can't have a few more flaws? Forget, The Sixth Sense while watching this movie, it'll make it easier to enjoy because it is enjoyable.",1029196800,,2325,4.718518518518518
1293954,5,B00003CXQA,"M. Night Shyamalan is a genius. I say that about only few people. Maybe twenty-five at the most. And twenty-five out of 6 billion is pretty good I am guessing. M. Night Syamalan is one of the best storytellers of our century. He writes, directs, and most of the time produces his movies. Though only three of his movies have made it big, he should deserve more credit. I know a lot of people thought this movie was bad. But it deffinately isn't bad at all. It does get slow at some parts, but that is mainly why people didn't like it. But if you are into M. Shyamalan's films you will love this no matter what. This is a compelling story about David (Bruce Willis) who is the only survivor of a massive train wreck and who is un-harmed. He meets Elijah (Samuel L. Jackson) who has a disease that makes his bones very weak and they break very easily. They are on both ends of the spectrum. Elijah suggests that comic books are a form of history and that David may be a sort of ""missing link"" to this. I won't tell more as of fear of spoiling it. But M. Night Shyamalan's work is awesome. Everybody in the cast does an awesome job. And the score! By James Newton Howard, who also did The Sixth Sense, is just amazing. I love every bit of it. Who would have known that this Indian kid from nowhere could have such wonderful ideas and so diverse too! From a kid seeing dead people, to a comic book superhero, to crop circles and aliens!

The silliness of the movie's main conceit didn't bother me-after all, the movie is about comic books.  What bothered me the second time around is that it really isn't a very good movie.  Is Bruce Willis supposed to be the same ghost that he played in The Sixth Sense?  Is every movie that Shamalan makes going to be about bland people in a bland world?  The brightest thing in the entire movie is a Tropicana orange juice carton.  I think rather than watching another Shamalan movie (I'm sure Mel Gibson's character in Signs will be every bit as lifeless as the protaganists in Shamalan's other two movies) I'll check out some Hitchcock, who at least knew how to meld humor and energy with tension and suspense.",1028332800,3,851,4.633333333333334

1294045,3,B00003CXQA,"THE FILM: Unbreakable, directed by M. Night Shyalaman very, very hard to rate- the plot is original , but it moves so slowly that I would barely give the movie a three out of five. It just really isn't all that interesting- maybe if someone had paced it faster, Unbreakable would be great. Some good points are the acting: Bruce Willis, Samuel L. Jackson, and Robin Wright Penn all do GREAT jobs, they're really believable as would-be-normal people put in strange situations. They really gave this movie a boost, although they alone weren't enough to save it completely. The idea of Unbreakable is simple: a man(Samuel L. Jackson)has the thought that if some people have disorders that make them fall ill easily, couldn't others be strong, virtually invincible? The idea is captivating, but the story is stretched out too far for it's own good.
SPECIAL FEATURES: Yes, this DVD is part of the Vista Series- wouldn't you think there would be a few decent special features, then? No. The special features on this DVD are scarce, and the ones that ARE there really don't draw my attention- even the deleted scenes were bad, they really should have been deleted.

1294046,5,B00003CXQA,"I think the problem with this movie was that people were expecting non-stop action, and a cheesy story with no real plot.  Sure, Bruce Willis is in it, so it HAS to have a lot of cool action and stuff, right?  Wrong.  If this movie was done the wrong way, yeah it could've had a lot of pointless chases and fights and explosions, and so on.  Don't get me wrong, all of those ingredients are great for some movies: just not THIS one.
""Unbreakable,"" is a superb, and yet, underrated film that should've gotten more recognition.  This is a dark thriller that messes with your mind and emotions.  It has great acting, a great story, and most of all, an ingenious plot.  Not to mention one amazing score.  (Check out the soundtrack!)
And the DVD is really great.  It looks great, it sounds great, and it has TONS of special features.  I enjoyed watching the deleted scenes.  (Try to watch the one where Samuel L. Jackson remembers when he was a kid and went to a carnival.  It's so painful to watch, and yet well constructed at the same time.)
Bruce Willis is amazing in this movie, proving that he doesn't have to be in movies with only non-stop actions.  Samuel L. Jackson is also outstanding.  They couldn't had found a better person for the part.
Overall, I loved the movie, and it continues to be one of my favorites.  If you like dark movies with more of a plot than action, such as ""Memento,"" ""Frailty,"" and ""Insomnia,"" then this is the movie for you.  If you want a movie with non-stop action and really no story or plot, then get something else.  This is a really great film that should've been recognized more.  Very unappreciated, but a lot of great films are.  I guess it all comes down to taste in the end.  Since you already know what to expect, just give it a shot.  If you know what you're in for, chances are you will enjoy the movie more.
P.S.  Non-stop action and a lot of cool explosions does NOT make a movie great.  Just look at ""Pearl Harbor.""",1027036800,,1961,4.371191135734072

The movie is constructed very carefully, building at a very measured pace.  If you are looking for some kind of action-based climax, you will be disappointed as there is none (but always feels like it is building up to one).  If you are into comic books, superheroes, or the like, then this will be a wonderful movie for you.
I unfortunately have not had the background of someone that would enjoy this movie; I could see a very strong statement being built, but it looked to me like it was built nowhere and afterwards came crashing down; I wondered afterwards why I watched it.

And they trashed this film up one side and down the other. I don't know how many times I recommended this film to people and they watch it and say ""It was O.K. but the Sixth Sense was better"".
Thats fine but please quit comparing it to the Sixth Sense. This film is in no comparison to it, and besides I believe it is better than the Sixth Sense. From the start Willis delivers a great performance, and teamed with Sam L. Jackson it just makes it better. I'm not going to go into the movie part of this. Obviously 600 other reviewers already have, and you can read the movie reviews there.

 Enough about the movie. The disc is brilliant. Shyamalan's introductions to the deleted scenes are very insightful. I love seeing and hearing an artist talk about his work especially someone as smart as he is. The scenes themselves are astonishing. The scene with the priest and the flashback in the carnival are 2 of the best things he has ever created. I hope we see a longer version of this movie with these deleted scenes re-edited into it. The 20 minute featurette ""Comic Books and Super Heroes"" is fascinating. I was really happy to see Frank Miller and Dave Gibbons included in it. The ""making of"" piece is very cool. This disc gives you more bang for the buck than just about any other disc you'll buy. The only thing it lacks is an audio commentary or 2 and normally for an audio commentary [buff] like me this would've been a serious drawback, but it wasn't because every deleted scene counted for something (most deleted scenes are throwaways).

1294053,4,B00003CXQA,"After reading some negative reviews of ""Unbreakable"" I didn't have high expectations when I recently watched it, which goes to prove one thing - whatever the film, make up your OWN MIND about it. Needless to say, I enjoyed this a lot. As with the director's last movie, The sixth sense (TSS), Shyamalan gives the audience another ""twist"" at the end of the film. I won't give it away, but it's not as good as the one found in TSS, which instantly made the viewer want to watch the movie again. The twist in Unbreakable also seems a little less credible, but it's the journey to this twist that was highly enjoyable, and keeps the viewer hooked until it happens. Samuel L.Jackson is - as ever - great, sporting one of the coolest/funkiest/craziest (take your pick) hairdos in cinema history!. Bruce Willis is also good, though he'll never be accused of over-acting, and virtually reprises his role from TSS. Nevertheless, Willis is our (the viewer) guide through the movie. The supporting cast is also worth a mention - Robin Wright Penn (the wife), and a very impressive Spencer Treat Clark who plays the son.
I loved the visual style of the film, the mood & atmosphere, and in particular the way some of the scenes were shot, from the excellent opening sequence, to Jackson's tumble down the stairs. Some people have criticized the film for it's lack of action sequences, but this isn't even something that occurred to me while watching it. As with TSS, it's just not the sort of film you expect to see any, and I didn't. This is not to say it won't hold your attention - it will. From the opening sequence with the newborn baby, to the Spencer Treat Clark-with-gun scene, right through to the twist/end credits. For me, the only scene that started to drag a little was the weight lifting scene wth Willis, this could of been trimmed down a little. The best of the deleted scenes on the DVD is the fairground one with Elijah as a boy, which you'll bound to wince when watching!. All in all a good movie. It may not have the shock twist ending that TSS had, but it does have great direction, script, acting and cast. If you haven't yet seen Unbreakable and you liked TSS, what's your excuse?.",1025913600,,2191,4.563451776649746

1294131,5,B00003CXQA,If you watch this film with Bruce Willis and Sam Jackson you'll find that the film maker has an opinion of fans of comics. After I saw this I'd say he makes a statement that comics fans are an isolated bunch. That isn't true. It's movies like this one that gives comics fans a bad name. It's a film about an art collector that focuses on Willis because he survived a train disaster. Jackson's character has a genetic defect that makes his bones break. Turns out (Willis) is like a super hero because he never gets sick. I watched this film expecting it to be part of comic book story. My only dissappointment was that the film maker never got what I thought was good looking comic covers and art to display in the film. The art in this film doesn't reflect the styles and art of the periods shown in the film.,1025136000,,809,4.294117647058823

1294133,4,B00003CXQA,"What if comic books were, in fact, based on real people in the world. Exaggerated, yes, but based in the world nonetheless.
That is what Elijah Price (played by Samuel L. Jackson) believes. You see, Elijah has a disease that causes his bones to break with the greatest of ease. He is convinced that there is someone out in the world that is just the opposite of him, whose bones don't break.
He eventually finds that person in David Dunn, the sole survivor in a deadly train crash. David not only survives the train crash, but he walks away with not a single scratch on him.
""Unbreakable"" is a dark, eerie movie that takes you through the birth, so to speak, of a hero. This is not a casual movie where you can half watch it and still be able to understand what is going on. Instead, you have to pay very close attention to this movie to catch everything that is in it.
The only real criticism I have of this movie is the constant use of dark in the scenes. I understand the concept of lighting and how it is used to create an atmosphere within the movie. But there are several extended scenes that are hard to see what is going on because of the lack of lighting. For some, any change in this would ruin the movie. To me, it would have helped me to appricate it more.

He tries to cheat on his wife in the first three minutes of the film, and this issue is never addressed later.  So I just don't care about his personal problems. It turns out that David might be more than human, which is interesting, but it takes way too long to develop that plot.

1294137,4,B00003CXQA,"M. Night Shyamalan's follow-up to the superb The Sixth Sense is an equally excellent film, with masterful storytelling, great acting and strong direction from Shyamalan. The storyline is about a seemingly-normal guy David Dunn (Bruce Willis), who finds out that he is impervious to pain and stronger than Schwarzenegger, when he discovers he is the only survivor from a horrific train crash. David meets up with comic book guru Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson), who befriends him and tells him what he can accomplish with his extraordinary gift.
While not as well-played as The Sixth Sense, Shyamalan has again created a world with fascinating characters and bizzare events. And like Sixth Sense, the film does throw up a shocking twist at the end which is even more unpredictable. Utilising the same techniques, the audience is treeted to the director's compelling world, much alike to the early Spielberg films; extraordinary events happening to normal people. The top-notch acting from Willis and Jackson makes the film's ideas work even better. And the premise provides a series of weird events, building up to a thrilling finale. If it has a flaw, the pace drags sometimes, but the material is handled with aplomb. This is one of the hottest new directors around working his magic to superb effect.
The extras are really good, with comprehensive ""making of"" documentaries, some deleted scenes which add little to the film but still make for an intersting watch, and the ""train sequence"" with a natty multi-angle feature that allows yout to watch the film fron different view points. Plus trailers, a booklet and more production info. Impressive stuff.",1023580800,2,1656,5.137037037037037

With his wonderfully original and perfectly structured screenplay, this young master once again has us entirely in his thrall.  But it's the beautifully understated performances from Willis, Wright and Jackson which really make this work.  With the wrong actors, or the wrong direction, this unusual story with its `family values' subtext could easily have descended into absurdity or melodrama, but the tone of chilling plausibility is maintained till the end.  Slick production design, thoughtful camera work and editing, and a surprisingly effective score from James Newtown Howard, add the final touches to what is a very, very impressive piece of work.",1023235200,,756,5.38135593220339

I would really love to see his continuing adventures, but I know that's not going to happen. Perhaps it's best that we just have this first piece of the proposed trilogy. Some may think it a little slow, but I think the detail is what makes the movie special.
If you are really a fan of comic book superheroes, or just like a well told story then this will work for you. It's not action packed but then this is not about a superhero. It's about discovery and that takes time. It's a good journey to go along for.

1294229,4,B00003CXQA,"Sitting through Unbreakable you might find yourself asking ""When is this gonna start?"" at least a couple of times. The movie is a pretty dreary dream that interests you but has you frustrated, actually wanting more. Plus Willis plays a dope, I mean he asks stuff like ""was I ever sick?"" and doesn't even remember if he was injured in a car wreck or not.
SPOILER: On top of that, he didn't know all this time that when he touches people he can see the sins that they've done. Now how someone with powers like that didn't know about it all along is beyond me. I guess he must of avoided touching people his whole life or something.
Now beyond the bad stuff, including the dumb text at the end, Unbreakable is still a very good movie. Even though Willis plays a dope, he still gives a fantastic performance. The scene where both he and his son want to see just how strong he is and keep on adding more and more weight for him to lift is just great. Speaking of his son, they have very good chemistry together. There's a scene where the son wants to prove to the father that he can't be killed and has a gun pointed at him is very emotional and heartfelt. One of the movie's more powerful scenes.
Unbreakable is a superhero movie, but not another X-Men; instead it's basically about finding your role in life. The film has one cool heroic scene, though, where Willis attempts to save a family that are a hostage in their own home.
Unbreakable isn't only about Willis' character though, it's also about Samuel L. Jackson's, who has unbreakable hair. No, just kidding: it looks that way, though. Jackson plays Elijah, who has had very breakable bones his entire life. Since he can't do sports or anything, his mom buys him comic books. After reading them most of his life, he finds himself convinced that he has an opposite who is kind of like one of the superheroes he reads about.

But some night vision glasses or something would be nice if it came with the movie.  My point is, this movie is way too dark in way too many places.  That is the main reason I'm giving it 4 stars instead of the perfect 5.  I enjoyed Sixth Sense, I mean I've seen it like 3 times, and has a very good suspenseful thriller, and M.

Jackson wakes him up from his sleepy revery that he has walked through his whole life while wife, Robin Wright Penn struggles with Willis's insecurities and his failing's in a marriage that proves how breakable he actually is.

Untakeable, or at least unwatchable. I guess they incorporated the whole ""Comic book"" theme into the storyline in an attempt to intensify the movie's (already flipantly proportioned) surreality. Whatever their intention, the writers fudged it up big time! The result is Cheesey enough to feed a Rathouse.
I saw this piece of Trash in the movie theater (yes I dropped $8 on it). I can remember the entire audience erupting into laughter during the scene when Bruce Willis's 9 year old son holds his parents at gunpoint, insisting through fake tears, over unessecarily clamorous music, that he has to shoot his dad to prove to everyone that he really is ""Unbreakable"". Again... Whatever the intended effect was... IT FAILED
Of the pacing in this movie, I say it dragged where it should have skimmed and skimmed where it should have accentuated. You can just sense the carelessness in editing.
The ending... My god! Almost as laughable as the pistol packing third grader. Movies are supposed to ""end"" as in ""Conclude"", as in wrap everything up efficiently as it pertains to the rest of the story. Unbreakable just kind of stopped. Its like they ran out of film, or something and had to end it in a flash.
So, there you have it. Another movie that never should have seen the big screen. A poorly paced, pitifully written bit of work with a shotgun ending. Don't let your curioisity get the better of you. This one is bound to disappoint.

This would've made a decent Twilight Zone episode, but because there was no real substance to the story, the director just slowed down the pacing.  Either we're to believe that all of the lead characters are stoned or they all speak that slowly and methodically because they are mentally handicapped.
Why was Bruce Willis' character getting divorced?  Why did he try to pick up the girl on the train if he supposedly still loves his soon to be ex-wife?  Why on earth would a parent just stand around while a child points a loaded gun at them?  Hardly realistic.
And don't get me started on the surprise ending!  It's very easy to make a surprise ending if you just pick it out thin air.  There was nothing at all in the story that would even lead you to suspect the ending was possible.  Unlike his brilliant Sixth Sense which plays well multiple times because it was true to itself.

1294311,4,B00003CXQA,"In the summer of 1999, Disney released a movie written and directed by a little know director named M. Night Shyamalan. Studio executives hoped that the movie, a supernatural thriller, would perform well and make a profit. To their surprise and delight, it became a smash hit all around the world. The movie was The Sixth Sense. As you most likely know, it was about a child psychologist [Bruce Willis] who tried to help a young boy [Haley Joel Osment] who claimed to see dead people. In his newest movie, Unbreakable, Mr. Shyamalan again returns to the occult with a spooky tale about a man who is a super hero and doesn't know it.
Bruce Willis again stars. This time he is David Dunn, a mild-mannered, frequently depressed guy who works as a security guard in Philadelphia. As the movie opens, he is returning home on a train. He gets an odd feeling, and the next thing he knows, there is a terrible wreck. He is the only passenger who survives. His wife and son are ecstatic. Not only he is alive, he has escaped without a scratch. The fact remains that David and his wife, Audrey [Robin Wright Penn], are planning to divorce. The train trip was for a job interview in New York City. Though estranged from Audrey, David is exceptionally close to his son, Joseph [Spencer Treat Clark]. The impending separation is tearing everyone apart.
Leaving a memorial service for the victims, David finds a note engraved with the words ""Limited Edition"". Inside, someone has written, ""How many times in your life have you been sick?"" He traces the note to a chic art gallery that specializes in comic book art. The note was written by the owner, Elijah [Samuel L. Jackson], a strange and slightly ominous man who suffers from a genetic disease that causes his bones to be brittle and to break easily. It is he who thinks that David is more than he appears to be. Elihah tells him he may be someone with special powers, someone who can tap into the forces of good in order to fight evil. Naturally, David thinks Elijah is a nut case. He even orders Joseph, who as accompanied him, not to drink the water Elijah has given him. Yet he also senses something in what Elijah has said. Soon, odd things start to happen, and David finally realizes that the answer to Elijah's question is that he has never been sick a day in his life. But what does this fact, as well as recent events, mean? And what is Elijah's interest in it?
There are many similarities here to The Sixth Sense, including a surprise ending. For several reasons, Unbreakable doesn't work quite as well. It has many interesting elements, including lots of references to comic book heroes. There is a theme involving water that is excellent. The photography and the set decoration are impeccable. The cast is great. But Unbreakable is even more dark and brooding than The Sixth Sense, its pace is slower, and its ending is even more far fetched. As a result, many viewers will find it less enjoyable. I don't think this is all Shyamalan's fault. When your last picture was a boxoffice phenomenon, it truly is a tough act to follow.
I was intrigued to discover that the director's next project, Signs, is about a farm couple who finds mysterious crop circles in their fields. The supernatural theme continues. Wouldn't it be great if Shyamalan turned out to be the next Alfred Hitchcock by devoting himself to just one genre or theme? I thought of this while watching Unbreakable because, after all, even movies by The Master of Suspense varied greatly in success, both artistically and commercially. It was the body of work by Hitchcock that was important, and I hope the same proves true of Mt. Shyamalan.",1016150400,5,3656,4.643518518518518
1294312,5,B00003CXQA,"Unbreakable is a revelation in commercial filmmaking. The director, M.Night Shyamalan aimed to combine art house flamboyance with mainstream sensibilities, and as a result has made one of the most misunderstood and underrated films of the last decade.
The film possesses a strict style. It is slowly paced, acted with a subdued ambiguity and shot in a cold and obstinate manor. Kubrick's visual legacy lives on in every frame of this film.
I love the fact that most critic's disregarded it as a pretentious experiment. Taxi Driver, Raging Bull and The Lost Weekend were poorly reviewed for the same reason upon release but are now considered masterpieces. Unbreakable will begin to be realised for what it truly is; a complex, multi-faceted allegory. It poses one of the hardest questions we could ever ask ourselves: 'what was I put on this earth to do?'
For ninety-eight minutes Bruce Willis is on a voyage like Travis Bickle, searching for his identity, wanting to make a change in his life and the world that surrounds him.
Bruce Willis is perfectly cast as David Dunn, a man whose potential has not yet been realised. Willis may continue to make average action films but every now and again he reminds us all of his acting talents. Obviously this performance was TOO good for the Academy. Robin Wright Penn and Sam Jackson excel in their parts, but ultimately this is Willis's show.
Unbreakable continues to be a rewarding cinematic experience. I respect the director for his intelligence but also his courage to make an atypical Hollywood movie that holds up the mirror to our souls and begs us to ask the same question.
The DVD itself is a combination of disappoinments and surprises. The picture and sound quality is exceptional, putting other film transfers (i.e. Shawshank and The Godfather) to shame. The cinematography and musical score are equally sublime and it is fitting that this DVD does its best to showcase that.
...This featurette reveals new aspects of the film that I never noticed before. It entertained and informed me, which really makes this an excellent piece of material to watch.
The ""Comic Book and Superheroes Documentary"" is flat out brilliant. We learn about the conventions of villains, heroes and the themes in comic books. It illuminates Unbreakable to the point where you watch the film in an entirely new perspective.
Then you have the seven deleted scenes. The director introduces each one and explains why they were removed from the final cut. The quality of both the scenes and introductions are first-rate, and reveals just how good a filmmaker Shyamalan is.
Then there is ""An Excerpt From a Childhood Film of M. Night Shyamalan"" It is so charming to see a director at the age of ten (or whatever) making his own short film. It of course is terrible but is now all the more significant considering where that young boy is today.
The ""Train Station Sequence with Multi-Angle Feature & Sound Mix"" is kinda cool. We have seen it with the Seven and Fight Club DVDs. It reveals the effect sound has on images, and also the opportunity to see the scene drawn out in storyboards shows just how professional Hollywood can be!
Ultimately though what is lacking is a filmmakers' commentary. Like Spielberg, Shyamalan does not like commentating on his films which is fair enough, but surely this did not stop the other cast and crew members from commenting on the production. Commentaries are the most valued and significant extras any DVD can offer, and it really is a shame not to find at least one on this ""Special Edition"" DVD. Quite frankly I would have preferred a commentary to the gorgeous packaging and 2 Collectable Alex Ross Illustrations.",1016064000,7,3682,4.883386581469648

I didn't hate it.  I didn't like it either.  Excellent concept, however they took forever to tell the story, and by the time they got to the point...it was shortly over.  I found myself screaming at the screen, ""get on with it!""  I won't say boring, because it did hold my attention, obviously I didn't turn it off.  I really wanted to find out what was going on.  It was tedious.  It had no punch to it.  No action.  No excitement.  It was too cerebral, and it shouldn't have been.  If you are going to make a movie about a man who's really a ""superhero"" for Pete's sake put some activity in it!  Even the one big so-called ""action"" scene was dull.  I did think the big secret ending was quite a shock and made me even more disspointed that whoever made this movie had no idea how to make a movie.  What a brilliant ending to such a dud of a movie.  I wish someone would remake it already, because it has lots of potential.  Maybe someone with talent...like Quentin Tarantino, the genius!
And I don't like Bruce Willis trying to be sensitive.  I didn't like it in 6th Sense, and I didn't like it in this.  He can't pull it off.  There's something so insincere and smirky about Bruce Willis trying to be sensitive.  Please God, don't ever let this man play a sensitive character again!  Just let him keep blowing stuff up!  Samuel L. Jackson was wonderful tho.  Then again, when isn't he?  And the little boy, Spencer Treat Clark...he's a gem.

We are introduced to David Dunn (Bruce Willis), a man who, remarkably, is the only survivor of an horrific train crash. In fact, he doesn't have a single injury to show for it. One man who happens to notice this is Elijah Price (Samuel L Jackson), an obscure comic book expert who has a bizarre theory on why Willis survived. Price was born with a fragile bone structure, and spent a tortured childhood knowing that even the smallest fall could break any number of bones in his body. Dunn, on the other hand, was the opposite. Neither he nor his wife Audrey (Robin Wright) could ever remember a time when he had taken time off work through illness. Price believes that the two of them are linked, at different ends of a curve. The film follows Dunn as he struggles to come to grips with who he is, and what he is capable of.
It is a fascinating story with a great deal of depth to it, and it is extremely atmospheric, at times even spooky. The performances are excellent; Willis proved in Sixth Sense that he has some versatiliy, and he bettered that performance here with an excellently understated portrayal of Dunn. There was also a great chemistry between him and Samuel L Jackson, who was intense, and suprisingly chilling as Price. A geuninely thought-provoking and unusual film, Unbreakable is utterly riveting, and one of the best films of the last fifteen months - well worth buying.",1015286400,3,1607,4.681978798586573
1294417,3,B00003CXQA,"I don't know what Night was thinking with the idea for this movie, prehaps someone should define reality to him..... But if you can get over the ridiculous premise of this film, then it is worth watching if you want to forgo reality for awhile.",1014940800,,244,4.444444444444445
1294418,3,B00003CXQA,"Whilst 'The Sixth Sense' was a brilliantly made movie that revolutionised the ghost genre and took it into the new millenium, 'Unbreakable' is a much more ordinary piece.  It concerns an apparently ordinary man (Willis) who is not just the sole survivor of a train wreck but doesn't have a scratch on him.  Then along comes a vender of comic books (Jackson) with a disease which causes him to have incredibly weak bones who informs Willis that he is a modern day superhero.
The movie is an odd mixture of brilliance and mediocrity with an intriguing yet still obvious story.  Once again Shyamalan draws exceptional performances from the cast, especially Willis who all of a sudden seems to have become a very good actor indeed.  Jackson is uniformly excellent, as is Pen Wright and although the kid is certainly no Haley Joel Osmont, he is definitely a cut above most child actors.  It succeeds on a number of levels as once again Shyamalan proves that he is the master of ghostly suspense, with the few shocks included here deriving mostly from clever camera work along with stunning photography.  What is also impressive is the fact that the movie transcends its limitations so that it never seems ridiculous or descends into camp.  Moreover, it is a decidedly adult movie that should be applauded on many levels.
However, this cannot account for the fact that when the characters aren't stuck in apparently inescapable situations or there's nothing happening, it can get a little dull.  Whilst being dull is not necessarily a crime there is a lot of filler here that just wasn't needed.  Plus, the parts that needed to be expanded upon such as Willis's relationship with his wife, weren't so.  This half effort to inject some humanity into the film consequently falls flat on its face.  Yet it is the ending that will make most viewers scratch their heads.  It is not only a lame twist but it also seems that Shymalan thinks that a sudden twist is enough to end a movie.  Thus abrupt and frankly unsatisfactory ending more than anything else that fails 'Unbreakable'.  In addition, it's nothing compared to 'The Sixth Sense'.",1014681600,,2128,4.81043956043956
1294419,2,B00003CXQA,"When Unbreakable first came out, everyone was talking about the twist ending.  I think it was Entertainment Weekly that said the mere mention of a twist ending ruined the ending altogether.  I would have to agree.  From the moment I started watching the movie I began to speculate about the end. When one thinks about it for a while it was easy to figure out.  Maybe it wasn't as good as the Sixth Sense (which the ending was ruined for me) but I didn't really like the Sixth Sense as much as the rest of the world did anyway.  So it was really a let down but we'll see what happens with this summer's Signs, maybe, hopefully, it will be better.",1014508800,,645,4.297520661157025
1294420,2,B00003CXQA,"I don't reccommend this movie to anyone who wants to see a fun, exciting movie, or anyone who wants a truly deep movie.  The plot moves incredibly slowly, and the suspense soon turns to boredom.  It masquerades as being deep, but the premise that comicbook heroes and villains are essentially real and walk among us comes off as rather pointless when it is finally revealed in the movie's agonizingly slow manner.  Some of the truly great movies made recently manage to be deep and powerful, but still remain exciting and fun to watch.  The perfect example of this is ""The Matrix"".  It was naturally fun to watch because of the visual effects, but the premise of it and ingenious use of metaphors was also far more profound and intellectually stimulating than ""Unbreakable"".  Bruce Willis is generally a good actor, but his character is this film comes off as too depressive and one-dimensional to make the movie interesting.  While I didn't like this movie, it had a few commendable attributes.  It never sank to the level of such poorly made films as ""The Perfect Storm"", and it didn't try to be a special effects movie, just to lure audiences.  However, the bottom line is ""Unbreakable"" is not a good movie, since it is unbearably boring and lacks a real point to the lengthy, depressing set up that makes up nearly the entire film.",1014076800,,1335,4.719827586206897
1294421,5,B00003CXQA,"A lot of people, I think, disliked this movie because it lacked action despite being about superheros. However, this was the entire point of M. Night Shayamalan's sophomore effort, and I think it worked out beautifully. Unbreakable is not the story of a man being a superhero, but of a seemingly ordinary man realizing that he is a superhero. It is, as Shayamalan's stories so far have been, a very personal, human story set in extraordinary circumstances.
I think Bruce Willis has done his best work in this film and The Sixth Sense, also by Shayamalan, stretching himself to be more than just a funny action hero but also a credible dramatic actor. And Samuel L. Jackson is, as always, delightful in his role as the eccentric Elijah Price. James Newton Howard's score is perfect, and sets the mood beautifully in the many dialogue-free scenes.
Whether you're a fan of superhero comics or good suspense drama, you owe it to yourself to see this movie.",1013817600,3,952,4.775757575757575
1294422,4,B00003CXQA,"Let me cut to the chase. Unbreakable is another movie about middle age. ""What!"" you exclaim. ""Isn't this movie a realistic portrayal of a comic book story like all the other reviewers claim?"" It isn't. They're wrong. The comic book story is just cover. Just like the ghost story in The Sixth Sense is just cover--engrossing and enthralling cover, but just cover. Like The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable cloaks a deeply personal, philosophical message in an entertaining plot. But just like The Sixth Sense isn't about ghosts, Unbreakable isn't about superheroes or super villains. The Sixth Sense was a film about how many of us are walking dead, especially in relationships. It showed us how we take each other for granted, and often only come to grips with our sleepwalking lives when it is too late. So, too, Unbreakable is about middle-age, about growing up. Bruce Willis' character has reached that point in his life that so many of us do--beaten down by time, beaten down by responsibility, swept up in complexity. It is that strange middle-ground in life when you've forgotten the youthful indulgence, that you are special, that your life has a meaning, a purpose. It strikes at the same emotional vein (though clearly not as well) as The Sixth Sense. It speaks of the modern anomie of adults in a secular, materialistic society robbed of mystery and basic human dignity and spirituality.
It's a perfect message for a generation raised on the idea t that they are unique and special--even if they really aren't.",1013299200,2,1512,4.91015625
1294423,2,B00003CXQA,Since this movie stars Bruce Willis and Samuel Jackson I thought it would be good.  It was so boring I couldn't wait for it to end. Everybody in the movie speaks in a hushed monotone and it's hard to hear what they're saying.  It's probably just as well because the plot is ridiculous and far fetched. Bruce Willis' character cannot be injured in accidents where everyone else is killed.  Samuel Jackson is his opposite who breaks bones just by sneezing. Samuel Jackson has a theory that characters in comic books are real and are on earth and represent good and evil. This is actually the theme of the movie the best I could tell.  None of the characters in the movie are likeable and I really wasn't interested in what happened to them. I hope they don't make a sequel.,1013212800,2,771,4.485714285714286
1294424,5,B00003CXQA,"I have seen this movie twice now-first with my brother and then with my best friend-and let me tell you, even though there is nothing like the first time, this movie is just as great (or better, depending on the mood your in) with every viewing. The story is of an ordinary man, David Dunn (Willis) who survives a train wreck and eventually comes to realize (more like is forced to believe) that he cannot be physically harmed.
This movie could have just been another superhero flick, but there are many things throughout the movie that give it style and character that those other movies lacked. First of all, in the beginning of the film, M. Night doesn't show us the train crash. In any other movie in this genre, this would have been a big special effects scene, but by only implying the wreck, it makes the scene much more interesting. Secondly, the fact that Bruce Willis does not have to don tights and a cape before he goes out to ""fight crime"". That (while it works in Superman and Batman) would have been just too corny. Finally and most importantly, is the thing that most reviewers have been complaining about: the fact that David Dunn goes not go out to fight the bad guys until the very end. Instead, there is a slow build up to this throughout the whole movie, while Dunn is discovering his powers and beginning to test and use them (the scene where he sees how much weight he can lift and the one where he almost catches a drug dealer in the stadium (played by M. Night)). This buildup makes the climax that much more interesting. Tell me that you did lean forwards during the scene where Dunn goes to the train station at the end and stay that way on the edge of your seat until the end, biting your nails and unable to look away from the screen! God! I love that part! It is the coolest sequence I've seen in a movie since the ending of The Matrix! (Please excuse my brief outburst of immature-ness) A more technical reason for this is the fact that this is just the beginning to what eventually will be a trilogy.
Now about the DVD. First off, the packaging for this DVD looks very good, which while not being the most important thing, is an added plus because it will look good on your shelf. The actual extras on this DVD aren't as thorough as I would have liked (perhaps owing to it's (strange) lack of box office success?) I would have liked to see a commentary as well as all the other features. The extras it does have are spectacular, though. The 7 deleted scenes stand out as being interesting because they are introduced and explained by M. Night Shyamalan. This is a nice touch I think. I wish all DVD's had this. Moving on, there is also an excerpt of a film the director made when he was about ten or eleven. For some reason, I was lead to believe that this was an alternate ending to the movie, so when I viewed it I was somewhat disappointed, but it is interesting as a view into the director's childhood. There is also a short behind the scenes featurette, which is entertaining and informative, but you will wish it was longer.
All in all, this definitely would make a great addition to your DVD collection. It's not just for comic book or superhero enthusiasts, all viewers can enjoy this movie. You can also watch it with a child, as there is not much language or violence, though they might not fully understand it. Go out and buy this, or better yet, get it here at Amazon (my favorite web site) and have it delivered to you the next day.",1012953600,,3477,4.38390092879257

If you look at The Sixth Sense in its most basic sense, it is a ghost story.  But then the director took this remarkably fresh take on that worn out concept.  Well, that is exactly what he has done again with Unbreakable.  Only, this time his attention is focused on a different worn out concept: comic book movies.  If you look at it in this light, I think the film has a much greater impact.",1012953600,,532,4.0673076923076925
1294426,5,B00003CXQA,"This is one of the most spectacular movies I have ever watched.  I heard nothing good about this film, did not see it when it came out (wich I had) but bought the DVD on a HUNCH based on the synopsis of the story and the cast/crew involved in making it.
I wish the Bruce Willis cut in the shower has been left in the film.  I wish the two weight scenes had been melded into one so both could have been depicted.
The DVD has all the cut scenes, storyboards, score, etc...
The impact of the film is awsome.  The Climax and power with wich the film ends on is nothing short of POWERFUL.  The score is fantastic.
This screen play has become one of my favorites in the same realm of the Matrix.  It is off the beaten path and your typical critic will not like it.  If you enjoy movies that impact you after the movie is over, and have you thinking about them the next day...you'll love UNBREAKABLE.

Of course, I wasn't even expecting a twist in the storyline and now that you're reading these reviews you'll know there is one. Oh well.

1294486,5,B00003CXQA,"I'm a person who's willing to chance shelling out 20 bucks for a movie I've never seen, so I picked up ""Unbreakable"" at the local Blockbuster. I bring it home, pop it in the tray, and kick it on. Needless to say, I fell asleep. Fast. The next day I took it back to the video store, trying to pull a fast one and return it. That didn't pan out, so I tried to sell it to a buddy. That didn't go well either. So I'm stuck with a 20 dollar piece of plastic. Two weeks later, I'm sitting at home, it's raining outside, and I've watched every other DVD I've got 2 or 3 times, so I pull ""Unbreakable"" -- which by now has gathered a thin layer of dust -- off the shelf. I pop it in, and I stretch out on my couch, expecting to be asleep before the woman even sits down next to Bruce Willis on the train. But it's different this time. I'm mesmerized. You see, when I watched it the first time, I was watching it as the follow-up to ""The Sixth Sense."" As a Bruce Willis blockbuster. But that second time, I was watching it without all that hype, with no expectations... and it was spellbinding. It's so low-key that what might initially seem boring is just the proper tone for a somber character piece like this. It's not primarily a sci-fi thriller, or a mystery, or a comic-book movie. It's about a regular guy who's trying to find meaning in his life, all the while struggling to find balance with his family, and connect with his son. The whole superhero angle, while very interesting, only functions as his own unique struggle. Bruce Willis gives another great measured performance in the vein of ""The Sixth Sense."" In fact, everybody gives reserved turns here, even Samuel L. Jackson, who isn't exactly a paradigm of subtlety in his other movies. Not that that's a bad thing, but I don't think ""Ezekiel 25:17"" would mesh here. And the movie works even better when you think of it as the first in a trilogy, which Bruce Willis confirmed it is. My advice: watch it. But watch it without preconceptions or expectations. Ignore the hype. Give it a shot. You won't be disappointed.",1012089600,,2072,4.370466321243524
1294487,1,B00003CXQA,"I can't believe this movie rates only half a star worse than ""The 6th sense"". The director and the main actor are the same, atmosphere and pacing are similar; yet these two movies couldn't be more different. I saw both of them completely unprejudiced and without expectations. ""The 6th sense"" gives you two memorable and (as far as fantasy goes) credible characters, an interesting and gripping story and a fantastic and satisfying ending that makes you pound your head saying ""why didn't I see/how could I have missed that"". ""Unbreakable"" is trying very hard to be like its predecessor and failing miserably. The slow pacing and depressive mood of ""The 6th sense"" were quite fitting for the story of a boy who is the only one capable of seeing the recently deceased and a psychiatrist desperately trying to save him after losing a patient with the same problem. They do NOT fit the story of an unbelieving comic book hero and hooded avenger! When the train ""crashed"" at the beginning with no action scene whatsoever, I still thought ""Ah, so this one is purely psychological - OK, fine with me"" but the movie went only downhill after that and hit one of its low points when the son threatened to shoot his father to prove that he is unbreakable. Talk about unintentional humor - this scene certainly got a big laugh from me! The end - while it was comparably surprising to ""The 6th sense"" - was by no means as satisfying. It just put an end to a pretentious and boring story with no one to root for. I read critics of ""Unbreakable"" only afterwards. The fact that ALL(!) of the professional reviewers put this movie down as a wannabe should give those who give it a rave review some pause. If you like it and can't get enough of it - fine, but don't tell all the others they don't get it. I like comics, I appreciate good(!) psychological thrillers, but still this movie (to steal an expression from Stephen King) bites like an Electrolux!",1012089600,4,1938,4.587896253602305

1294489,1,B00003CXQA,"First off, let me give a quick overview of the movie. Bruce Willis plays your average white guy, except he's unbreakable. We first discover this when he is the sole survivor of a horrible train wreck, but as the movie progresses, we learn he has a knack for being invincible. Samuel L Jackson plays the exact opposite, a frail comic-shop owner whose bones break easily and who suffers extreme bodily harm with the slightest accident. The movie basically involves interaction between the two, with Sam Jackson trying to convince Bruce that he's invincible and that he should take up the role of hero. Other than that, little plot, except the ""twist"" at the end.
Now, the review:
This is probably one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Even if you are a fan of this type of movie (sci-fi/mystery/thriller), of comic books, and of movies that have a twist (of which I am all three), you probably won't like it. Maybe I am being too harsh simply based on the fact that this movie had sooooo much potential and then blew in the final 10 minutes, but still, I laughed when it was over, and I wasn't laughing with it, if you know what I mean.  Zero character development, apart from the physical gifts/shortcomings of the main characters, and a waste of a decent plot that was ruined by the directors desire to ""trick"" or surprise us.  The end was a surprise however, just not the kind that was very clever or well thought out.",1011312000,3,1423,4.533073929961089

Also, the Samuel Jackson character as well as Spencer Treat Clark as Bruce Willis' son are hard to sympathize with.

1294565,4,B00003CXQA,"Often times, slow-running shows you wish would end earlier; this is the exception.  Had they added another hour to it, it could have turned into a seriously cult-classic movie in the same vein as the original Highlander.
Much of the film simply focuses on the main star's realization-and-grips with what he is; by the time he is fully aware (which could have happened a half hour earlier for my tastes), however, he only has time for one low-level deed, the kind of stuff another movie might have started out with, and it's over.  Had it been a self-contained movie as I had thought, I'd have given it 3 stars because of this major problem - but in the hopes that the sequal wasn't cut off by the lackluster box-office performance, I'm giving it 4.  Now that the universe is ""set up"" it has GREAT potetional as a trilology, for those willing to give it time - I know I am.
Again to compare to Highlander, if you have seen that film, figure it this way:  McLeoad learns he's immortal and goes through his training, and has one minor skirmish before it ends ; picture that as the ENTIRE film, taking a lot more time to really make the transformation belivable and human.  While you might appreciate that, you will miss the big-bang ending:  And that's what Unbreakable needs in the 2nd installment.

It is interesting to watch Willis struggle with what he believes to be a ridiculous suggestion as he reviews key events in his life.  Willis then realizes that maybe, just maybe, he has powers beyond the norm, though maybe not as extraordinary as depicted in the comic books.  Samuel Jackson helps Willis through the test process of the thesis.
There are other interesting character interactions throughout the movie including Willis' interactions with his wife and son. The movie is NOT action packed but excellent nonetheless.

He plays a weak, brittle man who has a rare bone disease where even the slightest fall could have catastrophic physical affects.  Jackson eventually contacts Willis after a tragic train wreck that Willis walked away unscathed from.  The plot revolves around the search by both men for the reasons why they are not only who they are but why they are such polar opposites.  The film builds suspense slowly and has a great ending.

1294570,1,B00003CXQA,This movie was very disappointing. The storyline was very weak along with the weak characters. The worst thing about this movie was the ending which I saw coming a mile away. I wasn't the least bit surprised. How do they get big actors like Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson to do films like this? Also I think that this director reached the peak of his career with the Sixth Sense. Maybe he should try children's films. I wish that I wouldn't have wasted 2 hours of my life on this film.,1007510400,2,489,4.326086956521739
1294571,4,B00003CXQA,"Unbreakable (M. Night Shyamalan, 2000)

Okay, people, get over it: M. Night Shyamalan may never make another film as good as The Sixth Sense. Very few people, especially those trapped in the Hollywood machine, may ever make another film as good as The Sixth Sense. So comparing Unbreakable to The Sixth Sense is probably not the best of ideas.

Not that that will stop me.

Unbreakable is the story of David Dunn (Bruce Willis), the only survivor of a nasty train wreck outside Philadelphia. After he leaves the hospital, he is approached by Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson), who believes that Dunn may be the real-life equivalent of a comic-book hero, a guy who's basically put on earth to protect the weak, get kittens out of trees, etc., etc. Looking at Dunn and the life he leads, it's not exactly an easy concept to grasp; his wife (Robin Wright Penn) is estranged, though living in the same house; his kid (Spencer Treat Clark, last seen being Russell Crowe's kid in Gladiator) is obsessively
attached to him and lives in daily fear of the parents finally separating; Dunn himself is a simple security guard at a fictional Philadelphia university (that looks suspiciously like UPenn). This guy is a comic book hero impervious to damage who's going to save the small fry from the evil mastermind?

Comparisons to Shyamalan's last film aside, it turns into a well-done story. Willis and Jackson, reunited for the first time since Die Hard with a Vengeance, have the same chemistry that made that turkey into something vaguely watchable, and everyone involved plays their parts to the hilt. Shyamalan sets everything up just so, and then lets the ball roll, and it rolls well.

Problem is, this film begs to be compared to The Sixth Sense. Not just because it's Shyamalan and Willis, but because everything about it says Shyamalan was trying way too hard to reprise his earlier film. The red motif is replaced by a water motif that doesn't go nearly as far, Spencer Treat Williams could be a stunt double for Haley Joel Osment, Shyamalan makes his cameo, etc. It just doesn't have the same obsessive attention to detail that made The Sixth Sense such a wonderful experience, and so it doesn't quite pull at the heartstrings as much. But it's still a worthwhile movie, for what it is, that was unfairly bashed by many critics unwilling to see past the Shyamalan mystique. *** 1/2",1007510400,,2381,4.78345498783455
1294572,5,B00003CXQA,"Bruce Willis plays David, an ordinary man.  He works as a Security Guard, but is searching for a better job.  He and his wife (Robin Wright Penn) are sleeping in separate bedrooms and wondering if they can make their marriage work.  His son is an average kid, who is scared and insecure over his parents' situation.  Then one day, David is the sole-survivor of a devastating train wreck.  He is not only alive, but he is untouched.  While coping with this strange occurance, David meets Elijah.  Elijah has been born with a disease that makes his bones very brittle.  His theory is that since nature is balanced, then for every person like him there should be a person on the opposite side of the spectrum like David.  Someone who is unusually strong like Elijah is unusually weak.  As a connoisseur of comic books, Elijah perceives that person as being a superhero of sorts. David goes on a path of self-discovery and forms a bond with the compelling and successful Elijah.  Then, in the tradition of ""Sixth Sense,"" an unforgettable twist at the end blows you out of the water.
I love this movie and have seen it four times. After the first time, I absorbed all of the extra's.  Night is a great writer/director and manages not only to write compelling scripts, but also to film the scenes in a way that pulls you into the film.  His use of color is that of an artist, telling its own story.  Outstanding!  I cannot wait for Night's next movie!",1006905600,3,1445,4.546511627906977
1294573,5,B00003CXQA,"The movie Unbreakable is going to be a classic, with a superb cast (Bruce Willis, Samuel L. Jackson, and Robin Wright Penn). But thats not all there is to Unbreakable. Its a really refreshing movie, that leaves out all the usual cliches, and a real abnormal plot.
The movie is about David (Bruce Willis), who survives a train wreck, in which he was the only survivor. After the incident David is approached by a weird, comic book fanatic named Elijah (Samuel L. Jackson) who is the oposite of David, he is fragile, and he breaks his bones very easily. The stranger is persisten in decribing to David that he is a super-hero. In which the film starts getting very inticing.
From writer and director of The Sixth Sense, comes a film that will really leave you breathless long after the credits roll.

1294692,3,B00003CXQA,"I didn't really know what to expect when I rented this movie. But I can honestly say that I was dissapointed.
I adore Bruce Willis and Samuel Jackson so I was assuming that this movie was going to be quite a bit better, or at least have more action.  I wasn't dissapointed in the acting, but at how slow the movie was. It needed more substance to it.
When Bruce Willis finally pulled a Neo and had faith in himself the movie downplayed it so much. I was waiting for the scene to take my breath away. I was also a little upset that he had never noticed that he had been sick. Most people tend to observe this in the course of a lifetime. But anyway...
Not a bad film if you aren't expecting much. I would watch it again, I can say that much. Don't expect a action flick. This is more of a movie that shows a personal struggle emotionally and physically in the characters.",1006300800,,870,4.178571428571429

To say the least, I was extremely dissapointed.  I found the plot twists silly and badly timed.  The scene involving Bruce Willis' son pointing a gun at him made me laugh out loud.  (His son was so convinced that his father was a superhero, he was going to shoot him to prove it.)  Writing like that just makes my stomach turn.  I think M. Night made a movie that had a deep personal interest to him, but a gut wrenching car wreck ensued on the screen.  Pass on this one.",1005523200,2,627,4.4

1294695,2,B00003CXQA,"It should be a given that any movie by a man who goes by ""M. Night Shyamalan"" (complete with mysterious first initial and unnecessary, spooky-sounding middle name) is going to be heavy-handed pretentious drivel. Shyamalan comes from the post-Kubrick, hyper-self-conscious style of film direction: that is to say, every single shot of the movie will draw undue attention to itself (so that you notice how deep and clever it is) and every single utterance of dialogue will be buffered on either side by ten seconds (so that you notice how deep and clever it is.)
The movie starts poorly, with a goofy statistics citation that is supposed to be a thought-provoking precursor to what's to come, by merely confirming what most of us have known for some time: that comic book collectors are incredible dorks. This opening gimmick identifies one of many major problems with the film: it is embarrassingly overburdened with what it wants to express. The story would've stood up considerably better if the tedious preoccupation with comic-books had been hacked out. It is obvious enough that the mythology of the super-hero is what's being explored in this movie, the point didn't need to be dwelled on. But ignorant or dismissive of this, Shyamalan batters us over the head with his theme again, and again, and again, usually in the form of cringe-worthy monologues by the astoundingly limited Samuel Jackson. (As usual, every word Jackson speaks is imbibed with a sermon-like intensity, which borders on the ridiculous in everything since Pulp Fiction; and comes off especially poorly here, given that his sermons typically include painful gems like: ""Water; it's like your kryptonite."") Yes, Sam. Yes, Shyamalan. I get it. Put the shovel down.
The characters who populate this film are astonishingly uninteresting. Bruce Willis plays a mopey, dim-witted man who fails to realize that he has never been sick or injured in his entire life, until Jackson comes along and points it out to him, following a terrible train wreck that Willis has mysteriously survived. Burdened by the suspicion that he is invincible and has minor super-powers, David (Willis), well ... continues to mope around. Why? No, really, get this: because he is ""sad."" He is sad, in essence, because he's (A) been too stupid to notice that he's invincible and gifted with super-powers, and (B) been too apathetic to make meaningful or interesting use of them in any case, which leads to the result that (C) he hasn't assumed his destined role in life.
No; Willis is too busy making his dissolving marriage as bleak and miserable as humanly possible with his inexplicably overwrought unresponsiveness and vacuous self-absorption, to worry about super-powers. This might have been a little more credible, or tolerable, if the relationship was actually interesting, or evoked sympathy of some kind. But it doesn't. David is a humorless bore who early on, I suspected of mild mental retardation, and his wife (Penn) is equally devoid of personality. Their child is a nerve-grating Osment-wannabe who is utterly unnecessary to the movie, and in fact, rather obtrusive throughout. Several of the most laughably awkward and ineffectual scenes revolve around him. (""No shooting friends, Joseph,"" indeed.) The father/son relationship that is - presumably - supposed to be one of the film's more ""touching"" elements, simply goes to show how miraculously ignorant Shyamalan is of how the dynamics of human relationships actually function.
So what does that leave us? Oh, yeah. ""Mr. Glass."" Ironically, I actually think Mr. Glass housed some of the film's greatest potential; his fragile condition is, theoretically, a nice contrast to David's invincibility, and his rough fall down the stairs was perhaps the only point in the film when I actually sympathized and felt (mildly) involved with what was happening onscreen. Unfortunately, Mr. Glass isn't allowed to be a real character; he is - get this - a comic-book fanatic and collector, who spends, incidentally, 90% of his script-time spelling out Shyamalan's ideas for us, displaying aptly how seriously Shyamalan himself takes them, and how deeply he wants us to be awe-struck by them. The ""surprise ending"" gimmick, of which Mr. Glass plays a large part and of which Shyamalan is obviously much too fond, has exceptionally little resonance or impact since we all realize on some level that Mr. Glass has just been Shyamalan's thesis-(...) for the last two hours, instead of a well-developed character in his own right whose history or motivations are of interest to us. Additionally, it simply doesn't make a great deal of sense, or ring true.
Unbreakable is a very stylistic movie and there were occasional intimations of the potential for something good, something involving, entertaining, and interesting. But only intimations. As far as the DVD goes, it's nicely packaged, with an additional disc of relatively boring features. Some of the comic creators who comment in the comic-book documentary are truly creepy. The multi-angle feature is masturbatory and boring, and the commentary from the actors and director adds little to the movie, since everything the movie wanted to suggest is so painfully obvious to begin with. It does draw extra attention to his various film school tricks, but under the circumstances they're just dressing without a salad. There is also a silly little movie Shyamalan made with his friends in highschool, which was amusing. Perhaps the best feature is the deleted scenes, a few of which were actually good scenes that the film would've benefitted from. Tsk tsk.",1005350400,4,5605,5.160439560439561

Other directors shoot their movies like music videos: constant music and ever changing camera angles. Shyamalan slows down and lets a great story unfold.

1294700,3,B00003CXQA,"Remember ""The Sixth Sense""?  Low-key and slow paced, so that by the time of the climatic twist, you were so drawn in to the relationship between Haley Joel Osment and Bruce Willis that the twist almost seemed out of left field.  Well, what worked for that movie proves dull and ineffectual here.  Shayamalan frequently opts for unusual camera angles (a whole conversation between a young Samuel L. Jackson and his mother is shown through the reflection of a television; a conversation on a train is filmed between the seats of the next row)instead on focusing on the believeabitiy of his characters and their interactions themselves.  For a movie about comic books, this seems so slow paced and without suspense that it is frequently boring.  Everything is this movie is quiet-much like ""The Sixth Sense""- and the characters seem so unhappy, avoid conversation, and unemtional that it doesn't prove to be interesting or realistic. Bruce Willis doesn't give much of a performance here- he carries a long face and a speaks in a flat tone slightly above a whisper throughtout the entire movie. There is great potential in the story, and maybe with another director chosen to heighten the suspense and character relationships, this could have been a great movie.  But, as a follow-up to ""The Sixth Sense"", it proves to be very dissapointing.",1004227200,3,1337,4.973094170403588
1294701,5,B00003CXQA,"I've heard people, not necessarily here at Amazon, complain that this film doesn't have enough content or action scenes. That's just plain ridiculous. Shyamalan utilizes the same technique that he did in ""The Sixth Sense"" to create an adventure that doesn't exactly have to be grandeur or epic to be thrilling and captivating.
All of the creative aspects are great - writing, directing, acting, music. They all work well to build up to a climax that makes you realize that the movie would have been stupid if it had been made any other way. The story is about the suspense leading up to the discovery of the truth - not the effects of the truth.
That being said, it is no wonder many people will quickly dismiss this as a dumb, boring movie. In a world when people pine for a quick fix of mindless one-liners and big guns a la ""Tomb Raider,"" I'm impressed that ""Unbreakable"" was even made.
If you are a fan of well-crafted drama/suspense movies, or possibly courtroom thrillers, and you don't mind a plot that can be a bit far-fetched, then you'll most likely enjoy this movie.

1294815,5,B00003CXQA,"who think comic books are kid's stuff.  The ...reviewer has a lot of nerve to call the story ""bordering on the juvenile""; while it is, of course, fantastic, juvenile would be garbage like ""Armageddon.""  While this isn't ""Watchmen"", it is a perfect distillation of what comic books mean to those who read them and the pure sense of hope they can offer.
Yes, I said hope.  If you really need it spelled out, you should see another underappreciated film, ""The Iron Giant.""  But if you're impatient, I can only explain it this way; as any regular reader of comics knows, the best comics and characters give us something to aspire to, to be just, true, and a protector of those who cannot protect themselves.  Comics are an uniquely American creation, but the characters strike a deep human chord.  A story my dad likes to tell is of a friend in the Peace Corps; he went to a village in the West Indies that was incredibly isolated, couldn't get radio stations, had almost no technology.  He walked into a clearing...and there, carved out of a whole tree, was a statue of Superman.
I've seen the photos.  It's a really inspiring sight, and it's something I suspect MNS heard about, because he tapped into it deeply with ""Unbreakable.""  His character of David Dunn is denying what he is to such a degree it's destroying his marriage, his relationship with his son and folding him into himself, rendering him number with each passing day.  It's not until we get deeper into the film that we realize just how much he gave up for his wife and son, which makes the beginning that much more painful to watch.
This isn't really a film you can watch like ""The Sixth Sense.""  It's something completely different from that film, although it has a similar hopeful vibe underneath the gloomy lighting.  In a lot of ways, ""Unbreakable"" is the ultimate comic book movie, and for those who know what that truly means, they know that's the greatest compliment anyone can bestow on it.",1002931200,2,1963,4.641618497109826

Bruce Willis tries to score again with a mix of the sensitive Sixth Sense atmosphere and the slap from Twelve Monkeys. Where as they were his best two films since the Die Hard trilogy, this was rather drab and silly. Its only redemption being the neat twist to finish which is like an expensive bow on a cheap Christmas pressie.
He plays a dim man of few words now working as a security guard at the local football stadium. He was once the all American College cliched starter quarterback who was curtailed by that ligament injury that strikes all the heroes down in America.
Willis survives a calamitous accident and im not talking about ""Breakfast with Champions or Hudson Hawk"". He's strangely unbroken from a train crash and seems to be the only survivor.
A strange comic collector is convinced that theres a reason for this and tracks him down. Samuel L Jackson sporting a Audley Harrison mullet is the one who tries to pursuade Willis that it was no accident that he survived the err accident for supernatural reasons.
Just as he (Jackson) suffers from a brittle bone disorder from when he was a kid, he believes there must be someone out there who suffers the opposite...
The comic books that helped him to be strong as a kid and made his fortune, also convince him that there is a superhero out there for real, and it could be Willis.
Brucey baby seems to have forgotten his past and the fact he's never been ill or broke anything before. How the hell he forgot that I will never know. Everything he does, theres no scratch on him, apart from his mid nineties filmography, oh ive mentioned that already.
But like I say he's dim and a security guard. Well you've seen them in the shopping centers outside Boots.
Jackson is quickly into his over bearing SLJ Pulp Fiction sermons with Willis trying to hang on to the sensitive role play to little effect. This film is way too cool for the excellent Jackson to get involved in and should never jump on a Willises sinking ship he seems to captain these days.
Although theres a cheeky line it where he hypothetically takes the p**s out of Willis by imaging he could have run a successful chain of restaurants which I thought was cute.
Willis gets into his role wearing his OB1 Kanobi style cloak that err protects him from the err water. Mr Invincible has become H2O man. Unaware of his powers, he learns to forge a relationship with his stepson and try to get his marriage back on line.
The actor playing his young one looks like he's seen Sixth Sense and Osmans (and Spielbergs AI) stunning performance and tries to better it. He only has about six lines though. Owww bless.
Soon Bruce is pumping 300 lbs more than he should be in the cellar, which is nearly as heavy as his ego. Willis realizes that he is a little different and sets out to see if he can put his newly discovered powers to good. And that is the plot and most of the action im afraid folks.
There really isn't much to this as Willis tries to repeat some of The Sixth Sense supernatural chemistry. The twist is the only thing that gives it a second dooyoo star from me and I would wait until this Turkey fare pops up on the Christmas table TV.
Bruce, how about Die-Hard Four matey. If Willis keeps going down hill they will have to start subpoenaing those cinema audiences again.",1002931200,2,3321,4.490909090909091

At the same time Mr. Shyamalan uses the camera so perfectly and in particular slow moments so well as only masters of storytelling in comic books do through the use of white spaces.
The real nugget though is the additional DVD and the special features. The deleted scenes are the 'usual' good stuff, but the special on the power of comics is just wonderful. Legends such as Frank Miller, Dave Gibbons and Will Eisner as well as Scott McLoud, from 'Understanding Comics' fame are interviewed AND also recent Pulitzer price winner Michael Chabon is included!

Bruce Willis plays the hero, David Dunn, who is discovered and informed about his ""superpowers"" from a stranger, Elijah (Samuel L. Jackson).  The movie deals with the frustrations of a mortal man who has not fulfilled his dreams.  Both men are searching for meaninig in this life.

The movie is richly filmed and beautifully crafted.  The plot works because the actors are beleavable.  No one overacts their part.  The two disk set has the extra bonus of a feature about comics.  Many people, including great comic writers and artists, Frank Miller and Alex Ross, are interviewed. The musical score is also terrific.
Lastly, a reviewer said this movie is depressing.  I cannot understand why.  In the final analysis, good triumphs evil, and our hero finds peace in himself.

The film is well composed, and it may well be the best effort in bringing comic book superheroes into a more real world.  However, the film is lacking in it's scope.  It seems like more of a prelude to a greater story.  If someday it is, this film is an excellent start.  Unfortunately, if it has to stand on it's own, it's far from a complete package.  The video presented here is excellent, as is the Audio.  Buena Vista's new Vista series holds some promise, but it's a bit dissapointing that M.

One man continually searching his anti-thesis.  For what?  I really could not tell but maybe simply for the satisfaction of knowing that his belief, derived from comic books, is correct afterall.  What I cannot fathom though is how a paraplegic can pull off all those accidents when he obviously cannot even help himself.  Hhhmmm...strange, really strange.",1001980800,,588,4.888888888888889
1294911,3,B00003CXQA,"M. Night Shyamalan has a great ability to take a perfectly normal situation, and add just a touch of the unexplainable, to make an interesting story.
This is as much the case with ""Unbreakable"" as with his previous success, ""The Sixth Sense"".
Unfortunately, where ""Sixth Sense"" succeeded with its ghostly mysticism, ""Unbreakable"" seems comparably infantile with its exploration of a man who discovers he might be a ""superhero"".
Bruce Willis does very well as a man coming to terms with his unique situation.  Samuel Jackson is appropriately aloof  and dramatically offbeat.  But the premise ultimately dooms the picture; modern audiences are more willing to suspend disbelief to accept the existence of ghosts and mediums than they are to accept the existence of superheroes.",1001894400,,775,5.284552845528455
1294912,4,B00003CXQA,"This movie was good because of one good reason: It did not try to be more than it was.  It was the most realistic unrealistic movie I have seen.  Bruce Willis was found to have semi-super strength and ESP type powers.  But this didn't mean he could life cars and buildings or control peoples minds.  It just meant he could lift more weight than would be expected of him, he could take a beating and be fine and would get visions of peoples thoughts if he touched them.  This movie did not try to create a hero who would be unbelievable in the real world.  After watching this movie people could actually believe that people like Bryce Willis existed.  The only flaw of this movie is the director.  The day before I watched this I watched ""The Sixth Sense"".  The same director did both of them and even if you didn't know that you could see lots of similarities.  The same types of fade outs are used and the ending was shocking but in a sixth sense -esque way.  Over all it is an enjoyable cinematic experience.",1001894400,,1011,4.352941176470588

So, in my next movie, I will also weigh down a fairly cool idea with even more heavy handed emotional belly-button gazing.  People will LOVE it.""
Ah, well, no.  People didn't love it.  Actually, people liked 6TH SENSE's scares and the twist ending.  And while I appreciate the seriousness with which he approaches this superhero tale, he's made a boring art film out of a fairly interesting idea.",1001894400,,619,4.685185185185185

1294915,3,B00003CXQA,"The movie starts off promisingly enough. Philadephian David Dunn, tepidly played by Bruce Willis, is travelling on a train, when it suddenly derails. All aboard are killed, except for Dunn, who emerges from the wreck unscathed. Dunn, a working class joe, is a security guard, who is married and has a son. His marriage is on the rocks, he walks through the movie like a zombie, and he is unintelligent enough to be unaware that he has never been sick a day in his life nor ever injured. His is a marginal existence.

Enter Elijah Wood, wonderfully played with electrifying intensity by Samuel L. Jackson. Wood is a man, who suffers from a genetic illness that causes his bones to be so brittle that they shatter easily, like glass. Highly intelligent, wealthy, and single, he is the antithesis of David Dunn, the man for whom he has been searching, as long as he can remember.

Why? Well for that you will have to watch the film, which is really an allegory for a comic book interpretation of good and evil. The film, however, will whet the viewer's appetite, but it will not satisfy, as it gives the viewer only a taste of what the film might have been, rather than what, ultimately, it is, a film that caves under its own artifice.

The relationship between Willis' character and his son's was realistic in the way that the director portrayed the desperation with which the son clings to his father(Willis). Willis and his wife (Robin Wright Penn) bring their character's failing marriage to life. You feel the awkwardness that surrounds them. Samuel L. Jackson plays his character with all the seriousness and flair in which he is famous for. The idea that there are real superheroes and villians living amongst us isn't as farfetched as it sounds (especially not after Jackson explains this theory to Willis!) The way Willis' character discovers and uses his newfound super-hero's gift is a heart-racing/heart-stopping scene; One of the best scenes in the movie!

1294918,3,B00003CXQA,"As both a writer and a director, M. Night Shyamalan is attempting to bring a whole new sensibility to American moviemaking.  Unlike most filmmakers who dabble in the ""horror film"" genre, Shyamalan eschews sensationalism and gore in favor of understatement, subtlety and indirection, preferring that we, in the audience, be given room to conjure up our own demons rather than having the filmmaker do it for us. The characters in his films drift like somnambulists through worlds drained of sound, color and emotion - and where the fine line between the normal and the abnormal, the natural and the supernatural, the real and the surreal is vague and easily crossed.
Shymalan scored a major critical and commercial success in 1999 with ""The Sixth Sense,"" a film so brilliantly conceived and executed that it cried out for multiple viewings - the first time to be amazed and dazzled by the sheer ingeniousness of the multileveled plotting, the second to study retroactively just how intricately each plot element fell into place, catching us unawares the first time around.
It is natural that Shyamalan should have tried to duplicate that success in his next film, using virtually the same stylistic elements and the same leading man, Bruce Willis, as he did in ""The Sixth Sense.""  Unfortunately, ""Unbreakable"" fails to live up to the quality of the earlier film. For one thing, ""The Sixth Sense"" really WENT someplace - it built and built to an infinitely satisfying resolution.  ""Unbreakable,"" for all its admirable stylistic flourishes, simply leads us to a dead end - nay, worse, a conclusion that is absurd, undeveloped and thoroughly unsatisfying.
Shyamalan's subdued narrative and visual style needs a solid dramatic core to attach itself to.  Here, however, he never finds it.  Willis plays a character almost too similar to the one he portrayed in ""The Sixth Sense"" - a brooding, taciturn man who seems to wander through life in a perpetual emotionless fog of detachment and depression.  David Dunn, a man caught in what appears to be a loveless, deteriorating marriage, is the sole survivor of a Philadelphia train wreck.  Already we are alerted to ""Sixth Sense"" parallels, so much so that we begin to subconsciously suspect that this might indeed be a sequel of sorts to the previous film.  Actually, it isn't, but rest assured there is something ""not quite right"" about this man, although the revelation of what it is has no where near the kick provided by the earlier work.  After his miraculous escape, David is contacted by Elijah Price, played by Samuel L. Jackson, a man suffering from a strange genetic illness that causes his bones to shatter like glass and who becomes convinced that David may be his alter ego, i.e. a man immune from injury and disease.  This premise, based on a built-in dichotomy (just as ""The Sixth Sense"" was built on the dichotomy of life and death), also tries to explore the twin dichotomies of good vs. evil and hero vs. villain, but the context in which the filmmakers launch their exploration - the world of comic books of all things - robs the film of much of its potential profundity.  We just can't take Willis very seriously when he is wandering stoically around the city, clad in a hooded sweatshirt, like some sort of ""super hero"" on Prozac, saving innocent victims from the clutches of evildoers whose purposes he senses when he brushes up against them in crowds (the tag line for this film could well be ""I see criminals"").
Thus, without a decent story to tell, the film turns out to be all style and no substance.  What was artistry in ""The Sixth Sense"" becomes artiness here.  Even clever visual motifs - like showing us many images upside down first, then right side up or having only the bad guys dressed in bright colors so that they stand out against the muted grays of everyone else - become sheer artifice with no thematic purpose behind them.
""Unbreakable,"" for all its beauty of atmosphere and tone, leaves us bewildered, frustrated and unsatisfied.  Shyamalan is definitely a talent worth nurturing.  Let's hope next time he can once again find that perfect marriage between form and content that he hit upon so brilliantly in ""The Sixth Sense.""  We need adventurous filmmakers like him around.",1001116800,3,4258,4.893055555555556

Now after the third time watching it, I think I can truely say that I love it. It is a very subtle film and I think that is what makes it so great. The twist at the end is as good and as satisfying as the ones in the Sixth Sense and The Usual Suspects. Like those films it is very interesting to watch the film over and over to catch all the clues to the twist. This film could have easily been traditional comic book turned movie fare, but I think the human aspect and the slow but interesting pace gave it a lot more emotional depth than you get from those films.",1000771200,,669,3.8905109489051095
1294920,2,B00003CXQA,"It's been a while since I've seen a thriller with a more assured opening.  The flashback to Elijah Price's (Samuel L. Jackson) birth.  The scenes of David Dunn (Bruce Willis) on the train, trying in vain to make some human contact.  And the train wreck, never shown but subtly alluded too in a way that made my heart skip a beat, that will bring both these men together.  These moments are handled stylishly, but with a genuine purpose.
Director M. Night Shyamalan frames his shots wonderfully, controlling the symbolism with an iron hand and creating the tone with a painter's palette.  Watch for his repeated use of the motif of things turned upside down (a comic book, a child watching TV, etc.) that, while being brutally obvious, never becomes heavy handed.  And he seems to drag a wonderful performance out of Willis, an actor who usually bores me.  Bruce plays a character in the midst of some depressing times, but manages to imbue him with a sense of play and willingness to go on.  The film was building up a reservoir of good will; I was willing to let it meander, with a purpose, towards the twist ending that I'd heard so much about without learning of its details.
Sadly, things horribly go wrong.
Like Icarus, the film's wings melt when it tries to fly too close to the sun.  Around the time David goes to meet Elijah for the first time in his art store, and Jackson lays bare the film's narrative conceit, Shyamalan ceases his attempts to make a movie, and what follows is more like a thesis paper:
""It is the purpose of this film to prove that comic books, like hieroglyphics, are an important communications tool in contemporary society, shaping our myths and defining what it means to be human.""
Whatever.  I didn't buy it.  Maybe if I had a comic book collection of over 3,000 issues, and I'd spent over a year of my life reading through them (as the film's title card declares to be average statistics for a comics fan) I might have been able to follow the film down this precarious plane.  But as things stand, I thought it was just silly.
Even though he begins the film with promise, and the idea of him as an unwilling, unknowing superhero is somewhat intriguing, Willis blows all the good will he'd built up in the film's first third.  He rarely shifts out of first gear, playing all his scenes with that self-important whispered delivery he's developed over recent years.  It subverts the few moments of charisma that he vainly tries to engineer, such as a dark but funny scene in his weight room, where he accidentally discovers some unusual powers.  (Question:  If David Dunn were truly ""unbreakable"", wouldn't he have been able to keep some of his hair?  Just curious...)
Taking their cue from the film's star, the rest of the cast seems to have trained at the Bruce Willis School of Comatose Acting.  Samuel L. Jackson is stripped of his vitality as he's saddled with a hideous fright wig and a wheelchair, not to mention of series of ludicrous monologues, that aim for philosophical but land firmly on pretentious.  Robin Wright Penn is quite ridiculous as Willis' wife.  She tries in vain to bring some humanity to Audrey, but is weighed down by some clunker dialogue of her own (""No shooting friends, Joseph!"" she says to her son at one point, with utmost sincerity; is a laughably bad line that got funnier and funnier after dozens of times rewinding to listen to it again and again).  Spencer Treat Clark as Willis and Penn's son is not up to the task of the emotional scenes he's asked to play, and his affection for his father has no basis in reality.
As for that notorious surprise ending, well, Shyamalan proves once again that he knows how to catch the audience off-guard.  Only by the time the sheet was pulled back, and the mystery revealed, I found myself asking ""Yeah... so what?""  By that time, the movie had so lost my trust that the ending truly didn't matter.  If the rest of the movie were up to par, the ending would have been a mind blower.  As it is, it is just a curiosity.  Waiting for this final revelation was the only thing that kept me going.  If not for that final gimmick, I would have given up much earlier.
The true, hardcore comic fan may get a kick out of this flick.  For the rest of us, unable or unwilling to buy into its contrived mythology, the goings will be a lot harder.  I found it to be a sloppy and sub-standard piece of filmmaking, loaded with potential but unable to nurture any of it to a satisfying product.",1000512000,3,4486,4.537888198757764

Bruce Willis plays a person who becomes the sole survivor of a train crash.  No scratches and no bruises, Willis is uncertain about what's happening to him until Samuel L. Jackson sheds some light on what the event possibly is.  As a collector of comics, Jackson tells Willis that he is some kind of hero.  Of course Willis doesn't believe that, but he discovers it throughout the film.  The twist at the end is really impressive, and I think you should see it in order to find out.
This DVD is fantastic and the extras are interesting, but not quite as attractive.

1294986,4,B00003CXQA,"Many people make the mistake of comparing Unbreakable too much to The 6th Sense or are expecting too much of the same cookie-cutter sci/fi movies being generated by Hollywood as of late. We are conditioned to think all Sci/Fi must have great special effects, dramatic fight sequences, lavish sets, and futuristic gadgetry.
The old Twilight Zone series provided many a great tale with none of the above, and this is what Unbreakable accomplishes. It is a great drama (some may say a little slow and that's hard to argue, but there is a reason for it) and breaks the conventional mold of recent Sci/Fi flicks. One of the featurettes does a great job explaining the motivation and tone of the movie and makes us think differently about super heroes.
The story revolves around Bruce Willis's character and the self realization that he is somewhat different from other people. But exactly how is he different, what are his limits, why is like this, and what is he supposed to do with this knowledge. This journey of self discovery is prodded along by the character of Samuel Jackson. Jackson is masterful is his characterization of a handicapped man and his view point and rational of people. He breaks down good and evil that can be explained by any comic book. He contends that there are actual 'super-heroes' here on Earth, but many aren't aware of their special nature, ergo, Bruce Willis.  Is Bruce a 'Super' hero?  What defines one as greater than a mortal man and how do you deal with it?
But Willis thinks that Jackson may be deranged at first and needs to spend his time fixing other things in his life, like his marriage and his own mental health. But then things start to happen, subtle at first, they soon begin to paint a picture that Bruce knows is true but can't believe it.
The movie is a bit morose, mostly with muted colors, sounds and overtly dark in nature but this serves a purpose. Color and sound (or lack of at times) are integral parts of the overall story and are characters in their own right. Sound quality is good and no visual defects.
Like The 6th Sense, the ending was a shocker. Two hours moves you to these last five minutes, and it is worth it.
Now onto the DVD itself. There are actually two: 1) The movie, 2) Bonus material. First off let me say the packaging is very nice. Opens up into a quad fold made out of heavy cardboard stock and looks slick. Inside is a Alex Ross collectible card that represent Bruce Willis on one side and Samuel Jackson (both in costume) on the other. Very nice, but I would have liked two separate cards instead of one image on each side..I'd like to frame these...they are that nice. The first disc is a normal DVD, basically the movie with Audio options. What is missing that I would have liked was a director's commentary track to accompany the movie....sadly there is none. Disc 2 contains the bonus material: The making of Unbreakable (about 20 minutes and pretty interesting), 7 deleted scenes (another 20 minutes by God, why were they cut?!?...they leant so much more!!), a documentary on Comic Books throughout the past few decades....very interesting to the casual person, but priceless for the comic book fan (a lot of industry names in this feature), a small 5 minute fight scene staring the director as a young teenager (pretty silly overall and wonder why it's here), and a split angle train sequence live action/storyboard (okay).
There is also a small booklet included that seems slightly like filler material about the movie.

Bruce Willis's confused hero is a tortured individual who doesn't understand why he feels incomplete and lonely every day, but with the help of Samuel L. Jackson's theories and guidance, he discovers his true nature.  The movie is brilliant and raises as many questions as it answers throughout its run - Shyamalan's ethereal feel and use of color as symbolism throughout is well-placed but not obvious, and the interplay between a skeptical yet unhappy Willis and the driven but fragile Jackson is a surprising meld of acting styles that delivers a fantastic human element to the visual masterpiece.

Night Shamaylin (I am not looking at the correct spelling of his name, I apologize) has a tremendous gift for supplying a twist which changes the whole movie and he does not disappoint on this occasion.
The story centers around a security guard (Bruce Willis), the sole survivor of a train crash, and Samuel L. Jackson, the owner of a comic book art gallery who believes that Willis's character may be a super hero in the style of a comic book. The movie really explores our perceptions of ourselves and the place we have in the world and in relation to other people. The principles are well acted including Robin Wright Penn as Willis's wife although I felt something missing in the actor who portrayed his son, the character was necessary but certain scenes allowed his character to become annoying. The most interesting character is that of Jackson and his personal story is powerful and filled with pathos.
Originally conceived as the precurser to a movie, or as the first in a trilogy, I truly believe that the movie stands on its own, althouth as I mentioned previously, the ending left me gasping for more, and in effect changed the whole movie.

There's a reason for this: these films are DIFFERENT, and so are Unbreakable and Sixth Sense.
Now that I've got that out of the way, I can say that I really did like Unbreakable. I have always been confused at why the director still gets the most credit when today's movies are good mostly because of the screenwriters and the actors. Now M.

Unbreakable has to have one of the best packaging designs that I have ever seen. Instead of the trite packaging of most DVDs (a plastic rectangular box) the packaging is a fold out paper/plastic hybrid all done in dark blue and black. It feels of superb quality, and looks awesome as well. While the DVDs were a bit hard to remove at first, it becomes much easier with a removal or two.
Next is the artwork that comes packaged with the box, along with a good manual. It's hard to find multi-paged manuals, but this one is good and interesting to look at.
The extra DVD was a nice inclusion that many other DVDs fail to produce. It adds about an hour of extra footage, which aren't just a bunch of trailers like some other DVDs. The extra DVD shows you the deleted scenes, along with commentary. You will go behind the scenes of the movie and of comic production and see how the two influenced each other.
The only part that I felt wasn't all that good was the Multi Angle Train Station feature. It basically just lets you switch between the storyboard and the final production, which isn't all too exciting.
While some of you think the movie was stellar, and others of you thought differently, what's a fact is that if you decide to add this movie to your DVD collection, it will be a quality DVD.",999302400,,1387,4.421875
1295102,5,B00003CXQA,"I deeply enjoy movies told in a comic book style, like The Crow. I didn't expect that from this movie, and was pleasantly surprised. I had read some critics who had panned the film, and didn't expect much.
You're thrust into the life of David Dunn, a man who miraculously survives an incredible train wreck. The story has a slow start because the plot is very subtle. David has some problems, and the true conflict of the plot subtly emerges from each of the lesser issues he faces.
The story is told in Shyamalan's slowly revealing style, where we learn little bits about the character nad their personalities. Samuel Jackson plays a fabulously underrated role as a crazed villan, and his carefully crafted character truly makes the story.
The movie, throughout, has a comic-book feel in both the story line and the camera work. (Though, I got a little tired of the top-down spinning angle which was reused several times.) The realization and climax of the movie are well-told and wonderfully acted. While I would have enjoyed more examination of the aftermath, the story remained well-balanced.
The only thing that bothered me about this movie was the extra features. I felt that the deleted sceens would really have helped build the characters. The scene in the hospital waiting room, for instance, would have explained a lot about the relationship between David and Audrey Dunn... and even between them and their son.
I viewed this title DTS mode, and was impressed by both the ambiance and staging of the sound. The menus and special features are wonderfully done. The video occasionaly shows artifacts, but throughout the detail and contrast is phenominal.
This is well worth the rent, and a great purchase if you enjoy films of this genre.",999302400,,1746,4.882154882154882

1295104,5,B00003CXQA,"UNBREAKABLE (2000, PG-13= Disturbing Images, Brief Language, and Conceptual Dark Themes)
THE CAST: Bruce Willis, Samuel L. Jackson, and Robin Wright Penn.
THE GENRE: Suspense/Thriller/Drama/Mystery
THE PLOT: After a mysterious and deadly train crash, only one survivor comes out of the ruins. His name is David Dunn (Bruce Willis), a security guard searching for answers to his life. It begins with a note on his car asking how long he's been sick. With no other solution, David heads off to the writer of the note, the breakable boned Elijah, a mysterious comic collector, who is the only one who has an answer. David might be the one to protect the world, the one who literally is- unbreakable.
WHAT WORKS: Mysterious original plot working, great acting, directing and a suspenseful twist in the end which brings the whole movie together.
WHAT DOESN'T: The film is somewhat slow-paced and you are forced to walk through the film step-by-step which may possibly get annoying.
REALITY CHECK: This was obviously supposed to get the same amount of respect and originality applause that Shyamalan's ""Sixth Sense"" film received, but the average audience found it too strange and slow moving. If it weren't for the success of Sixth Sense, this film probably would never had been made.
THE CATCH: For people who don't like too think much in films, this one probably isn't for you.
OVERALL: ""This entertaining, twist-a-minute caper has awesome plot and character development and a unique sense of style which puts Director M. Night Shyamalan at the top of the line!""",998870400,,1559,5.046511627906977

I loved it because it's the first time in a very long time that I've seen something truly different, something unique.  The classic Bruce Willis tortured soul expression might perhaps get old after awhile, but in this movie it fits.  And Samuel Jackson's performance is just bizarre, but again in this movie it fits... it all fits, including the way the film is shot which at first seems rather aggravating until you really get a feel for the film.  At one point my husband expressed distress when he thought the movie was over thinking it was a poor end, however I commented where else could it go at that point, and it still went somewhere much to my pleasure.  I really hated the sixth sense -the whole idea of a young child having to put in effort to help out dead people that both emotionally AND physically torture and abuse him was all too sickening for me and if not for the 'surprise' ending it really had no redeeming qualities- however this one gets mucho thumbs up from me.  The slow pace and quiet tone of this movie work wonders in contrast to the over the top premise, a concept that could otherwise so easily come across as campy is made very real for us as viewers.",998352000,4,1440,4.354477611940299
1295167,3,B00003CXQA,"I had problems with this film.  The acting in it is superb; Samuel L. Jackson and Bruce Willis both give great performances.  The main problem, however, is found in the plot.  Not enough attention is given to further explaining the premise of the story - that comic books are a contemporary way to pass on history (like egyptian hieroglyphics) and hold basic truths about mankind that are hidden in layers of colorful pages depicting extraordinary characters.  It's an elementary fact that life is a struggle between poles; good and evil, deceit and truth.  The reason WHY comics are special needed to be emphasized more.
The reason why I gave this movie 3 stars is because I believe that M. Night Shyamalan makes good films.  Movies move us, and we can feel when a movie fiddles with the strings of our emotions (whether it be fear inspired by the horror film or joy from a love story, etc..) This movie, despite my problems with the plot, still manages to move and allows the viewer to feel something.  Definintely rent this one first before you buy.",998352000,2,1052,4.684782608695652
1295168,3,B00003CXQA,"It would be unfair to oneself these days to go into a movie with high expectations. It's been proven time and time again that this day in cinema the suprise is, you usually love the movies you'd thought you'd hate and you usually hate the movies you'd thought you'd love. Maybe it's the high hopes of being a true film fan that sparks these mixed feelings. As a movie fan you await to be apart of something. Movies aren't just escapism, they are experiences. Ways in which one can learn, laugh, and cry completely vicariously through characters who we relate to, sympathize with, and at times pity.
Well, this film called The Sixth Sense was what Hollywood called a sleeper hit. No one expected that movie to do the box office damage it did. Not because it wasn't brilliant movie but because it was so crafty, emotionally drawn out, and paced much slower than your usual creep fest, many believed there was no audience. But M. Night Shyamalan has a gift for storytelling and definitely story crafting. He makes us hold onto these mysterious characters even if we have no idea where we're being taken too. That was the beauty of the Sixth Sense.
Now, here is Unbreakable. Too an extent, it attempts to capture that same beauty of the Sixth Sense with the mysteriousness of the characters. Who are these people? What is going on? You ask scene after scene. Unbreakable is a beautiful concept film. It has these strong ideas, nurtured into a screenplay. But that is where the problem lies. The script. Although I give Night credit for not doing the same old formulaic scenario, still it felt like three different movies and each major plot twist felt cheapening. So by the end, many people are thoroughly disappointed. That's all? That's it? In essence, yes.
What is good about Unbreakable, is the fact of its uniqueness. It's ideas and concepts on balance in the universe, opposition, purpose, and the nature of what is good and evil. It made you think and question.
Unbreakable is not a film for everyone. I do say it is for the crowd who enjoys movies that try new things and new ways of storytelling. It wasn't great, it was simply good. While the comic book over tones and thematic elements in the movie are interesting ways to approach the depth of this film, we still feel cheated at end but it's our fault, comic books---in all their brilliance and conceptualizing varations--always tell the same story.",998352000,2,2408,4.695035460992908

Be sure to watch them if you are watching ""Unbreakable"" with friends and want to jump start a discussion.

1295170,5,B00003CXQA,"When I stepped into the theater to see M. Night Shyamalan's newest film, ""Unbreakable"", I had no idea what I was about to see.  And I was blown away.
I will not even begin to explain the story, as I feel doing so completely ruins the effect of the movie.  Go see this without knowing its plot; you will enjoy it more and really understand the depth of this film.
Everything screams of ATD...Attention to detail.  The actors are all top calibur, and all give top level performances.  The director is truly a visionary, and his flow and ideas are the bedrock of this film.  There are no special effects.  There is little ""action.""  But the film, even with its slow pace, manages to hook the viewer into this unstable world that the cinematographer and director have brilliantly created through artistic and gentle style.  The music is some of the best.  Even when I first heard the opening title music, I knew there would be something special.  The music is simply gorgeous, and matches the film perfectly.  The script is excellent.  At no point do the lines sound corny or unrealistic.  Through the entire film, you will truly believe that this film is real.
I must salute the entire production team for taking such a cliched, campy, and ridiculous premise, and turning it into a gritty, realistic and gripping piece of art.  The film is not ""The Sixth Sense.""  But in my humble opinion, it is honestly some far greater, and more masterful.  After all of the big-budget popcorn movie trash that has been floating around (Pearl Harbor, Tomb Raider, Swordfish,etc), it is truly refreshing to see CINEMA.  Not a movie, but a FILM.

First off, UNBREAKABLE requires a lot of patience. In fact, patience should be coming out of you ears. Because you won't really understand what's going on, and where things are going, before the film ends. And the entire film is very slow-paced, with no climaxes. Everything sort off just drifts a long. The scenes are long and the dialogues are low-key. Nobody are shouting. Nobody are firing guns. And there are no ghosts ""hanging"" around like in THE SIXTH SENSE. But when you finally arrive at the ending, after a long journey, everything will suddenly become clear to you, and the film will seem brilliant in retrospect. Trust me on that. And you'll laugh! I did, at least: I rate this as one of the coolest endings since THE USUAL SUSPECTS. Much better than THE SIXTH SENSE (but a lot of people will disagree with me on this one). But writer / director M. Night Shyamalan should have made the journey much more thrilling (for it's the journey that makes it all worth while).

I won't ruin it for you, but the movie builds up and builds up and then-- just ends.  Supposedly the first of a trilogy, but movies in a trilogy, or any movie for that matter, should be, MUST be complete alone.  I was admittedly interested and almost riveted by the slow build up, but there was no clearly defined conflict, there was no climax, it JUST ENDED.  Some have argued that ""Empire Strikes Back"" was not complete, but even though the major conflict was not solved, it was still a complete film on its own, even though it ends on a downer.  ""Unbreakable"" is only the prologue of a complete film.  Though already 2 and 1/2 hours long, it just did not end satisfactorily (is that a word?)even in that space of time.

1295228,3,B00003CXQA,"I am a big fan of Night's previous work (6th Sense of course), and it's clear to me that he has a lot of ability.  I also think that ""Unbreakable"" is a good movie, with an interesting plot, interesting characters, and a nice twist at the end.
I believe that ""Unbreakable"" was such a disappointment because it's so much less than ""6th Sense"" was.  People were expecting Night to produce a film that was just as enthralling and creepy as ""6th Sense"", and they didn't get it.  Had ""Unbreakable"" been made first, I think it would have received a far more positive reception, and would have been perceived as an interesting work from a rising artist.
As it is, Night jumped right in with a record-breaking blockbuster that may well be the best film he ever makes.  Success on such a scale creates expectations that are nearly impossible to satisfy, while placing you in the precarious position of having nowhere to go but down.
The situation is somewhat analogous to what happened to Pink Floyd after creating ""Dark Side of the Moon"".  A truelly incredible album that many feel is their greatest work.  Try as they might to top it, they never could.  All of their later albums were largely judged relative to how they stood up to DSOTM.  That kind of success is a two-edged sword.
So, be thankful that Night made the ""6th Sense"", even if he never does another film, and when he DOES do other films, try to judge them objectively, instead of by how they just don't measure up to ""6th Sense"".  You'll find you enjoy them more.",997228800,,1519,4.534798534798535
1295229,5,B00003CXQA,"First, if you didn't understand this film, you need to see it twice, and pay attention to the dialog between Wills and the promoter on the train.  Pay close attention!
Secondly, this is a mesmerizing film that brings back memories of the Twilight Zone.  Indeed, Shyamalan strikes back with the paranormal combined with a surprise ending.  Have you noticed the new films that ape his technique--Planet of the Apes, and AI: Artifical Intelligence?  Some people like O. Henry and Rod Serling have the knack for twisting an ending. Shyamalan has the knack; the other don't.  You keep you eyes open for clues when you see the movie again.
The story is subtle, and the over-sugared, over-glitzed MTV-zombies hate this movie as a result.  Treat this movie like a tender plant, as you watch it grow and unfold.  That is what life is really like: we slowly come to an awareness of who we really are, what our capabilities are, and what our mission in life is.  David Done is not only Superman, and Adam, he is Everyman.
How about the moral message?  Working at his marriage, and not vivisecting his family.  And what about the hero-worship of Willis's son?  David Dunn is a noble character.  We finally have a hero in our midst.  Death to the anti-heroes!

After reading other reviews, I decided to watch it again. And again, it didn't disappoint. And again, I watched Sixth Sense. And Again, it did disappoint.
I keep reading that Unbreakable is not believable. Are these the same individuals who think Sixth Sense is reality? Shyamalan was not trying to create Sixth Sense part 2.
Then I read that Bruce Willis was boring and acted emotionless. Again, were you watching the same movie? That is his character.
Fans of Sixth Sense probably will not like this movie, because they will already have preconceived notions about what this movie SHOULD be. While Sixth Sense droned on and the so-obvious ending was a let down, I was relieved to see a thinking-man's movie, Unbreakable.

1295231,4,B00003CXQA,"Slow moving, but at least the pace is generally consistent; and an M. Night film is always interesting to just _watch_, stylistically. In some ways, the film almost seems to be a parable concerning a religious transformation--I mean from sceptic to believer. Whether M. Night intended that subtext, I don't know. But I still found it interesting.
Music is okay, nothing to write home about--but neither is it supposed to be, I think. Thus, no problems there.
I enjoyed watching Willis' character beginning to bond with his wife and child again; and although the opening scene has been criticised, I thought (despite its pretensiousness) it caught the embarrassed tone of extra-marital flirtation very well. The main character is not really a great guy; and the film makes it fairly clear that his marital troubles mostly are his own fault. But he becomes a better person through his strange experiences--not immediately, but over time, in a very natural progression which I appreciated.

i'm going do this carefully, so as to not ruin it for those of you who are still curious enough to sit through the film.
what you get, instead, is a psychological film that totally ignores the biggest and most important psychological point - what is impact of a traumatic discovery.  instead of watching how our hero deals with a truly life altering revelation, we see a quick, pat ending that leaves you perplexed, confused, and annoyed (that you waited this long and through those boring parts).

Strangely enough, it explores an area of the psyche which Dracula's story has always exploited, the wish that we all have to be something more than what we are, immortal, powerful, to find out that we have something in us that nobody else has and which makes us something more than anyone else. The ending is totally unexpected, but it makes perfect sense.

1295305,2,B00003CXQA,"I must have wildly different standards for film than those reviewers here who have called this ""a great, great film"" or ""wholly original"".  I enjoyed ""The Sixth Sense"", M. Night Shyamalan's previous film (and to which, by some critics with incredible perceptual problems, ""Unbreakable"" was described as a sequel--it is most assuredly not, in any accepted use of the term.); I've always liked Bruce Willis and usually enjoyed Samuel Jackson's acting terrifically.  The two of them were fantastic in ""Pulp Fiction"", and I looked forward to seeing them together again.  But I found ""Unbreakable"" absolutely excruciating.  Others have mentioned the slow pace as a positive--I found it left me so totally bored with the story that by the time there was any action I simply didn't care.  It's not that I'm an action film buff--a story with little action but great writing--dialogue or plot, or with fascinating character development will captivate me.  But I found ""Unbreakable"" to have none of these.
In fact, trying to pinpoint the main source of this movie's problems is quite difficult.  It's not the dialogue (for minutes at a time there isn't any!), nor the acting, and it isn't really the concept--when you put the thing away for a while and think about the ideas involved, they have some interest although too much was made of the comic book, and not enough of idea of truth behind mythology. (The premise that water was Willis's ""Kryptonite"", and he goes out to hunt down the bad guy when it's raining buckets and manages to fall into a pool was simply absurd....please, spare me!) The music certainly didn't help matters, but it wasn't bad enough to sink the film to the depths it achieved.  I've got to put it down to the direction--it seems to me that Shyamalan tried too hard to recreate the success of ""Sixth Sense"" by starting with an unexpected twist ending, and working backwards from there.  But it didn't work for me.  The twist at the end with Jackson's character is rather good, but I had so totally lost interest in the entire film by that time that I simply didn't care, and I found it absolutely unbelievable.  Poor Jackson had the bad luck to have to utter perhaps the most ludicrous last line of any film ever made, and I have to believe that the director realized this after filming was over and everyone had gone home, because the music swells at this point, almost obscuring what must have seemed on paper a fine idea.  Thank heavens the idea of a trilogy based on this movie was abandoned.
Now, if at the end Samuel Jackson had sung to Bruce Willis (to the tune of Unforgettable): ""Un-break me, you sweet unbreakable you....""

Not only does Mr. Shyamalan propose that comic books are modern day mythology, he also attempts to prove their true art in this very well made film. What Mr. Shyamalan does is essentially take comic bnooks into the real world, stripping the story of the campy and silly plot lines which we have all associated with superheroes. David, Bruce Willis' character is no shwashbuckling, smiling pretty boy who has sworn to protect the earth from interstellar invaders. He's a common man, with a breaking marriage and father and son relationship that would make Bill Cosby's head spin. Elijah, Sam Jackson's character is also very much down to earth and brings to the screen a certain air that makes you WANT to believe this could happen. The somber tone of the film also adds to the natural feeling of the story, showing how a normal man would naturally deal with the prospect that he is not only more that meets the eye, but something god-like, born solely to fight the evil in the world. David doesn't jump into battle galantly, unlike the heroes of other films, he approaches he recently realized powers with disbelief and awe. These things add up to create a film of that takes fantasy and make it seem as close to reality as possible. You would swear that these events could happen, and while the surprise ending was hinted at towards the end of the film, it is not the less shocking which adds the greatness of the film.

Most prople were turned off of it because it was not The Sixth Sense, and I blame the advirdisments, such as: ""Unbreakable, from the writer/director of the Sixth Sense, starring the Actor from The Sixth Sense."" The film takes a slow and cerebal approch to something that could of been silly, superheros walk the Earth. Unbreakable starts out with the birth of a child, who has several boken bones upon birth. Then in modern day we see a man on a train, then the train crashes (offscreen) and we see him in the hospital. The docters infrom him he is the only survivor. A man now, the child born at the beggining has a strange condition that makes his bones break very easily.

This movie is almost like reading a book. It takes time to develop, and it's in firm control as it climaxes to an unforgettable scene of realizations and surprising discoveries. The long scenes set the pace of the movie, and instead of feeling they're long, I was drawn further to the movie, and I felt like I was a part of the story as an observer, instead of just as a viewer.
When Elijah Price verifies the man in fatigues has the gun David described, I was skeptical. When David lifed heavier and heavier weights, I began to believe. When David's son points a gun to his dad, in firm belief he would survive, I was speechless. Not because of the fact a son pointing a gun to his own father is shocking, but it's the fact that I was still unsure of David's power, as he is of himself.
Good directors control how much the viewers know. Most of the time, movies put viewers in a position where they know. Shyamalan is in control and only when he decides, the viewer is sure; I am sure who David Dunn and Elijah Price really are.
In comparison to The Sixth Sense, I knew, the audience knew the boy's secret. It was a matter of figuring out, or waiting for the time he would tell of his secret. In that sense, I felt the commercials and trailers spoiled the fun.
Unbreakable really spoke to me. That's what matters, and when a movie goes beyond simple enertainment to actually talking to viewers, that's when you know a movie is good.",996796800,,1602,4.2730263157894735
1295398,5,B00003CXQA,"BRUCE WILLIS stars as David, a security guard who gets caught in a train crash and is the only survivor.  After mysterious happenings, David begins to wonder who he really is, and what his purpose is on Earth.  Weak-boned Elijah (SAMUEL L.

Along the way, David finds out things about himself that could change his life, and becomes afraid of the truth.  He is literally unbreakable.
MY REVIEW:
""Like Director M. Night Shyamalan's THE SIXTH SENSE, this film also proves that he writes the greatest stories with great and unique plots that make you think.  This film rises on all levels and is an original motion picture that deserves a lot of credit.
FOR THE STORY: ""A"", I just love it, with the twists, the believable of the unbelievable.  This mysterious movie takes you beyond the depths of the mind and takes you into a world where fantasy really could be reality.  Not that I believe in the movie, but it is a great story that keeps you guessing, and the ending is most promising, and ties it all together.
FOR THE DIRECTING: ""A"", Shyamalan did a superb job working with the story and the actors.
THE ACTING:
BRUCE WILLIS: ""A"", fun, intelligent role that creates a sort of wonder in your mind, cheering for him in the silent form.  Forget Spider-Man, Batman, Superman...  David Dunn is the new great superhero of today.  BRUCE WILLIS is remarkable and gives one of his best performances yet, siding with DIE HARD, ARMAGEDDON and THE SIXTH SENSE.
SAMUEL L. JACKSON: ""B+"", this is the third time around where JACKSON and WILLIS team up together, their previous projects being PULP FICTION and DIE HARD WITH A VENGEANCE.  Well this film takes JACKSON to new heights, BREAKABLE heights.  Playing the strong minded comic fan who seems to put all the pieces of David's life together, who seems to come up with all the answers.  Where JACKSON isn't the main character and can't show a regular performance, being, too, this character is quite different from anyone he's played before, this performance was still well done and deserves a lot of credit.  The end is a real snap backwards for his character, but JACKSON pulls it off flawlessly.
ROBIN WRIGHT PENN: ""B"", You can't say a whole lot about her character, being she was a smaller supporting character, David's wife Audrie.  She tries to tie things together again with her husband, being they've been having marriage problems.  Her character is played the average way I would've expected.  She feels that David surviving the train crash is like a second chance for her and she wants to start over.  But you can't give her the big ""A"" because she just isn't in the movie that much.  For those of you who can't remember her too well, her most famous role is playing TOM HANKS' love interest, JENNY, in the 1994 Academy Award Winning film, FORREST GUMP.
'So OVERALL: You can't give this movie less than an ""A-"", because it is a well thought out film with big surprises and talented celebrities pieceing together the movie.  Good movies like this don't come around too often, so catch this one while you can.  Go buy UNBREAKABLE for an unforettable ride of mysterious fun.""- MJV & the Movies.",996796800,,3267,4.686514886164623

The scenes don't really fit together real well. And, characters keep popping up and disappearing through out the movie.

But there is also some good in this movie. Very few though.",996710400,,392,4.614285714285714

1295401,5,B00003CXQA,"Writer/director Night Shyamalan had a hard act to follow after his success with ""The Sixth Sense"", but he outdid himself with ""Unbreakable"", a film I liked even better.  This is an outstanding tale that incorporates fantasy, adventure, suspense, mystery, human interest and a complex character study of a man coming to terms with an unusual gift.  The story maintains its intriguing edge throughout, and just when the viewer thinks the last surprise has been revealed, another leaps forth.  The ending is fantastic, and will certainly surprise anyone who hasn't been tipped off.
The direction is superb in every aspect.  The photography is outstanding, with creative use of the camera that enhances the mystery and drama of the film.  Though some have complained about the pace of the film, I found it to be necessarily deliberate, avoiding the temptation to rush through the psychological elements and heightening the suspense.  The direction of the actors is also smartly done, with everyone working well together creating a realistic feel despite a story that flirts with fantasy themes.
Bruce Willis can't seem to do a film lately without a kid to play opposite.  As was the case with ""Sixth Sense"" and Haley Joel Osment, he works well with Spencer Treat Clark in this film.  The scene where Clark confronts him with a loaded weapon will nail you to the wall.  Willis plays the part just right with a combination of skepticism and curiosity that makes his transition from regular Joe to action hero extremely believable.
Samuel L. Jackson knows only one way to play a part and that is flat out.  Once again he delivers, with a darkly enigmatic character that makes the entire mystery work.  Jackson's talent and intensity again makes me wonder why he has only been nominated for one supporting Oscar (""Pulp Fiction"").  Robin Wright Penn rounds out an excellent cast with a solid performance as Willis' wife.
For anyone who enjoys a good psychological thriller this film won't disappoint.  I rated it a 9/10.  It will keep you guessing and intrigued throughout.",996710400,,2064,4.997076023391813

1295404,5,B00003CXQA,"How are heroes born? What if the hero doesn't know he's a hero? What role does evil place in the birth of good? More importantly, can a heroic type of good exist without an equally strong, deep evil to fight against? All these themes have been explored for decades by comic book writers and artists. But I don't think any movie has fully explored the dark reality of superheroes and villians (and their identity crises) as well as Unbreakable. Yes, as many have complained, this movie has a dark, brooding side and it moves rather slowly. But I'd argue that is only fitting for a movie which explores two men (portrayed by Bruce Willis and Samuel L Jackson) who haven't realized who they are and what parts they play in each others' lives - not to mention the world at large. Only when they meet each other do they begin to fulfill their destinies. Until then, they are rather lost and a certain somberness seems appropriate. If you pay close attention, however, you'll notice that the serious, dark colors at the beginning of the movie change to lighter, brighter colors. And do keep your eye on the colors in each scene; they lead the way to even greater revelations. I will warn you that this movie is NOT for those who want constant action and thrills. This one forces you to think and it often goes rather slowly, giving the viewer a chance to fully appreciate every detail. I plan to watch it again and again.",996710400,3,1415,4.53125
1295405,5,B00003CXQA,"The major hurdle that folks need to get over with Unbreakable is its pace. Unbreakable is not like a combo-meal at a fast-food restaurant, which you enjoy by wolfing it down while driving. Rather, it is like a multi-course dinner with an interesting storyteller. If you want to know everything now, don't watch Unbreakable. If you are willing to let it unfold at its own pace, the rewards are incredible.
Unbreakable rewards multiple viewings because of a dense storyline, a visually rich cinematography, and a tightly-interwoven screenplay. The more you watch, the more treasures you see, unlike a lot of movies where the more you watch, the more FLAWS you see.",996537600,,662,4.972972972972973
1295406,4,B00003CXQA,"I must admit that I really liked this movie.  Sure, The Sixth Sense was better, but this movie offers something we rarely see: a complete introduction to a ""comic book"" style of characters.  Because that's what it is, a comic book story, M. Night Shyamalan says it himself.  Comics are often weird, silly and can appeal to a limited audience, and so is this movie.
The entire movie revolves around this seemingly normal guy who finds out, from a rather weird man, that he is more than an ordinary human being, he has a gift which he must use.  We follow his reactions to this revelation and his first steps in the world of superheroes.  There isn't much action because it is first and foremost a film about this whole discovery.  This is a really dark movie, not only in the moods and the visuals, but also in the contents.  Willis' character's first action is against a psychopath who killed two adults and kept their children emprisonned.  The movie draws a lot toward the darker aspect of comic books.
Spoilers warning I really don't understand why people hated the ending so much.  It completely makes sense!  Well, in a ""comic book"" type of mentality.  This guy who has always felt like he was a mistake, who grew up living off comics, became maddened by his own place in life, he neeeded answers, he needed some sort of ""utility"".
IMO, people should understand that this is a comic book movie, and not a sequel to The Sixth Sense.",996451200,5,1436,4.54863813229572
1295465,2,B00003CXQA,"Sadly, this film did not live up to those high expectations. I found THE SIXTH SENSE to be one of the best films for ages, but this is a lame follow up. I like Samuel L. Jackson films normally, and he is good in this, but it isn't one of his better films. I almost fell asleep watching this as the pacing is so slow and character development is scarce. It becomes un-interesting and far fetched, as for the twist, well, its not too bad, but nothing surprising. I was hoping this was going to be a brilliant movie experiance, my advice is not to keep your hopes up, because, unlike the film, they will be breakable.",996451200,,614,4.256410256410256

1295467,4,B00003CXQA,"Bruce Willis has earned my deep admiration and respect because he deliberately challenges himself with movie roles that avoid the ""hollywood fomula"" and focuses instead on much more challenging and riskier projects. This is good for us all: for every ""Die Hard"", there is a ""12 Monkeys"". While these experiments don't always work, you have to admit that he has bought us a lot of good movies and proved that as an actor he can cover a breadth of character unrivaled in the current motion picture industry.
Unbreakable is one of his experiments that works for me. I enjoyed the movie tremedously. It required a little thought and concentration on my part and while the plot was a little quirky it engaged me. I did not guess the ending at all.  The only minor point from my perspective is that this is now the third movie where we see Willis' character as a protector/parent, closely bound with a distrubed young boy. Enough.
Nevertheless -I liked this movie a lot, and so did my wife which surpised me as this type of movie is not her favorite -

The movie definitely had the same spookiness as the Sixth Sense with its eerie, dream-like shots but it didn't have the same element of horror or suspense. The previews for this movie seemed to portray it as an action-packed thriller but the movie tends to be more of an artistic dive of a man's understanding of his abilities. I really enjoyed the fact that even though David (Bruce Willis) has supernatural powers, he was still firmly grounded in reality where good and evil aren't clearly defined. And bad deeds don't come from supervillains but simply from everyday people you may bump into in the street. The twist at the end was wonderful :) And those last three lines of text that showed that this was reality and not a comic book were disappointing but added more depth to the storyline. The movie unravels very slowly. Each scene takes its own time and nothing seems rushed. I felt a dream-like quality in the entire movie, at times creepy, at times lethargic but always watching and observing. A very good movie in my opinion and although it's slow, it's satisfying at the end and does make you think to a certain extent.",996364800,3,1278,4.65929203539823
1295469,5,B00003CXQA,"""The 6th Sense"" and ""Unbreakable"" are two movies whos stories revolve around individuals with supernatural abilities they can't come to grips with. Shyamalan himself said these scripts were basically stories in the ""Twilight Zone"" vein, and he has succeeded well in both films.
""Unbreakable"" has excellent character development, and while there is some supposed ""emptyness"" in places, it may have been intentional. Bruce Willis' character was the epitomy of empty, having survived a train wreck at the beginning of the film, and being told by the fragile comic book mogul Samual L. Jackson's character that he is some sort of superhero. But Willis' character struggles with everyday relationships and the confusion that is running rampant since things he can't explain are happening all around him, and added nonsense about having some sort of special ability only adds to the anvil that weighs on his head. For all intents and purposes, Willis' character is just a normal guy with normal problems, which is usually not the calling card of your typical comic book figure.
Mood in this film is demonstrated well by the art of the camera angle, be it the manner in which conversations are shot onto the screen (unlike the normal ping pong of the camera), to everyday settings that seem normal at first glance, but beome more and more ominous as the scene plays out.
The resolution of the movie really brings the whole concept into full focus...just as your typical twilight zone episode. This is definitely a film worth looking into.",996364800,,1531,5.031496062992126

First of all, I think one must have a certain amount of familiarity with comic books as well as an apperciation of them as an art form to fully enjoy this movie.  Make no mistake about it, it is a very clever, very well orchestrated story, with a great surprise ending that blindsides you.  Shyamalan has a mastery of leading the audience down one way when we should be looking another.  I love that about this film; you're lead to believe that it's a deep philosophical film with underlying meanings but what it is actually about is right under your nose.  That is brilliant, engaging film-making.  The cast is superb, with Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson giving flawless performances.  I can't really say much else about the movie's story without giving away the suprising ending.  You have to pay attention throughout the movie.

Bruce Willis is restrained, but still shows his emotions. Samuel L. Jackson is a commanding screen presence. It's not an effects movie, it's a human film, and it works.
The DVD has a great transfer, and great sound. The extras aren't that good, but suffice. The comic book documentary is great, especially the interview with Dave Gibbons from Watchmen.

Never before have I seen a film that made EVERYTHING subsequent to the ending make perfect sense.  The storyline flowed as smooth as silk and kept your attention throughout.  I've been subject to many movies (most of them lately) that leave you with a sense of wanting so much more.  They never give a sense of full closure and leave you wondering about many details that were left dangling during the film.  And even though it's not really a bad thing, too much left up in the air can ruin the film make the difference between a good movie and a great movie.  All films should have such a great attention to detail as the director displayed in this one.
I just can't say enough about the last scene in Elijah's gallery.  Everything comes into complete focus:  his garb, his mannerisms, and even the ""evil doctor"" wheelchair - perfect attention to detail.  Willis and Jackson have made very good movies together in the past, but this should rank as one of their all time best.

So far okay, but--and I don't care if I spoil the ending--we learn that he has been causing accidents to see if anyone survives, if anyone is unbreakable. Bruce survives a train wreck without a scratch, so bingo, unbreakable. A look around where Mr. Glass lives shows that he has some kind of arrested development in other areas. The message I got from all this was the following:  Handicapped people have handicapped minds and are bad. I thought this sort of thing was supposed to be out of fashion in our enlightened society. For this reason alone, ""Unbreakable"" shoud be ""unrentable"". Otherwise, the plot takes a weird turn about three quarters of the way thru when Bruce begins to act like a superhero.

Well, I don't consider it a waste. This is one of those films that you will either love or hate--at least that's my opinion. Obviously, given my rating, I fall into the former camp.
This film is very deliberately paced, and will probably not appeal to people who like their entertainment served up fast and hot; this is a film to stimulate the mind, to provoke conversation and maybe even arguments.
Despite the apparent premise, I see this film as more of an exploration of modern mythology; it presents and is paced for an idea more than an actual story, although the given storyline is quite engrossing.
In short, this seems to me to be a philosophical film with a little action thrown in to spice things up; very refreshing, and not at all what I expected.

Unbreakable takes itself extremely seriously, and many people fault it for this, but The Iliad and The Odyssey, to name a couple, also take themselves seriously despite the fantastic occurrences which take place in them, don't they?  Unbreakable is meant to be a modern day myth; a legend.  Another reason for all the disappointed reviews is that people were expecting Unbreakable to be a thriller, so realize before watching it that it's a very slow moving, very melancholy and brooding drama.  If you're the type of person who likes to talk a lot or rummage around in the kitchen during movies, or who often refers to the ""cool parts"" of movies, you probably won't like Unbreakable.

1295617,4,B00003CXQA,"I don't know what a lot of people and critics, including myself, were thinking when they went to see this while it was in the theaters. They criticized it for being overly-somber, slow-paced, and melodramatic. When did we as people stop watching movies with our head and start developing eager-to-please impatient attitudes toward film in general? When I first saw it, I thought it was just plain watchable. The languid pace and hard-to-comprehend meaning behind it I merely wrote off as one of the film's weaknesses. The following month, I had a conversation with my cousin, who is also an avid movie buff, about this film. He told me that he felt it was a wholly original and innovative suspense film that satisfied from start to finish. Well, I bought the DVD the day it was released and, I must say, after viewing it a couple more times I have raised my opinion of it considerably.
However, I agree and disagree with some of what the film's supporters say. I don't feel this is a wholly original and innovative film, but I do feel it is a more-than-solid effort and definitely a step in the right direction of greatness for writer-director M. Night Shylaman. He pieces the story together in layers, beginning with a flashback scene of a mother giving birth to a baby boy that turns out to have a rare protein deficiency disorder making him extremely susceptible to illness and brittle bones. Shylaman then moves to the present day and a quiet somber-looking man riding on a passenger train on a cold gray afternoon. This man is David, played excellently by Bruce Willis who gives the character the same subtle, soft-spoken sympathy that he gave to Dr. Malcolm Crowe in 'The Sixth Sense' but with an added element of intensity here. He is a man whose marriage is failing and whose relationship with his only son is slight, at best.
The passenger train derails and ends up killing all of the 131 passengers on board. But there is a sole survivor. David miraculously comes out of the accident, not only alive, but without a scratch on him. From here, the journey of self-discovery begins for him. Though not willingly. It begins when he is approached by a man named Elijah, played with dark and cool intensity by the always-impressive Samuel L. Jackson. He is the grown man who we saw as a baby being born at the beginning. He tells David a hair-raising theory he has about why he survived the horrible accident unscathed.
The reason I say this is not a wholly original film is very obvious (to me, anyways). This film has the style, imagery and feel of a Hitchcock film. It's story unfolds in layers and surprises you with plot twists that you would have never guessed, and its dark overtones are all elements extracted directly from the master of suspense. However, this is not necessarily a bad thing. I view Shylaman as more a disciple of Hitchcock, rather than a rip-off artist (I thought it was particularly effective the way he chose not to show the actual train wreck - it's that blank spot in everyone's memory when they're involved in a car wreck and wake up in the hospital, unsure of what has happened). He has an innovative approach to storytelling and a mind that knows no boundaries when it comes to what the imagination will take seriously. Some of the film's detractors felt that its premise - that comic books are the primary conduit of modern mythology - was decidedly juvenile. They may be right. But that may also be what gives this film a perfect balance between artistic and fun. It is something you and your sweetheart can go enjoy at a drive-in theater with a bucket of popcorn in your lap, but it also offers up much more in its social relevance and commentary on how we view our mundane and empty lives, than a mere comic book story. Watch this one with an open mind.",995328000,,3795,4.615384615384615
1295618,4,B00003CXQA,"This is a movie that makes me want to like it. It is formed with beautiful cinematography and a good cast. Unfortunately, too many of the elements remind us of a much stronger and much better Sixth Sense. I think that it is not simply that the Writer/Director Shyamalan and Willis are together again, but that you feel at the end that this was a formula. The fact is you expect the surprise and you know it's coming because you have seen Sixth Sense.
However, the movie has some very strong performances. Willis proves that he is a better actor than we give him credit for being (Unfortunately, Hudson Hawk & Color of Night still stick in my memory and prevent me from giving him too much credit). Also, Samuel L. Jackson, who I usually think is overrated, puts in an interesting performance as the fragile comic art collector Elijah Price. I think his scene falling down the subway stairs is incrediblely effective and Shyamalan deserves kudos for creating it. In addition, the acting is also bolstered tremendously by the key-supporting role Robin Wright plays as the football-hating wife. She is the one character I think could have been used more to create a better link between Jackson's and Willis' character.
Aside from the acting, the movie has artistic and creative merit. The premise and the twist at the end show real writing strength. This along with the way the movie is shot creates a very solid outcome. The problem is that the surprise appears a bit far-fetched and when things come together at the end, you are left thinking it was silly. I think Sixth Sense has the same potential, but you are willing to suspend your disbelief. The major reason is that in Sixth Sense, unlike this movie, all of the elements come together-you really think he is what he is. Here, they appear to simply be thrown in.
Overall, the movie is solid and is a good one for a Friday night and popcorn. This is not great, but I would still recommend it.",995241600,,1946,4.610951008645533
1295695,5,B00003CXQA,"THE STORY: I don't want to spoil the experience so all I'm saying is that David Dunn (Bruce Willis) is a Security Guard who is mysteriously unharmed after a train crash. He is contacted by Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson), whose bones are very unstable and tend to break very fast. In David he has found his exact opposit and.. the birth of a comicbook hero.
THE CAST: Bruce Willis is giving another great performance as Davud Dunn, a man who slowly realizes his purpose in the world. As much as I love to see him bleeding and cursing in action movies I think his serious roles are also convincing. His counterpart Elijah Price is played by a wonderful Samuel L. Jackson. He is one of those actors who can play anything. He has got great costume design and a.. well weird haircut to support the role.
WRITING & DIRECTING: The screenplay will be compared to the sixth sence. I guess it is M.Night Shyamalan's curse after its success. The story is much more inventive than the sixth sense and absolutely different. It is the most intelligent and interesting story Hollywood has come up with last year. Shyamalan directs the movie with very long shots, which lets you enjoy the great performances and slowly put you in the story. Although the movie moves very slow it never gets boring. There is always something to marvel at. Some shots are probably inspired by Hitchkock and taken to the next level. This movie features some of the most beautiful shots I have ever seen. There are repeating motives such as reflections and symetry. After the sixth sense Night came up with a much more mature film which will probably be something that isn't for everyone.
ALL IN ALL: One of my all-time favourites. I don't know how Night got a brilliant idea like this. If you like comics you should take a look at this. And if you don't.. don't be affraid to experience something that you have never seen before.",995241600,5,1895,4.592920353982301
1295696,4,B00003CXQA,"Like his previous film 'The Sixth Sense', writer/director M. Night Shyamalan's 'Unbreakable' begins with a simple mystery then slowly peels back layer after layer until it reaches an emotional, startling conclusion.  David Dunn, a security guard, is returning home from a job interview in New York when his train derails. Several hundred people are killed but he survives, unharmed, not a scratch on him. A few days later he attends a memorial service for the deceased passengers. When he leaves he finds a note under the windshield wiper of his car. It reads 'When was the last time you were sick?' Funny thing is - David doesn't remember the last time he had so much as a cold. He visits the man who wrote him that letter, an art dealer and comic collector named Elijah, a man stricken with a genetic disease which makes his bones as brittle and weak as glass. A man with a rather unbelievable theory as to why David's bones don't break, why he has never been ill, and why he survived that horrible train wreck.  All the players are excellent. Bruce Willis continues to shine under Shaymalan's direction, providing a strong emotional pull with his portrayal of David. And Samuel L. Jackson's Elijah is tragic and mysterious. But the real star of the show is Shaymalan himself who once again crafts a masterpiece of mystery and suspense, showing his remarkable restraint and patience. This film does wrap itself up nicely, with a great twist ending but it definitely ends too soon and too quickly. But after watching it, after you realize what you've just seen happen on the screen, you'll understand completely.  For a two DVD set, this is remarkably light on extras. Unfortunately there is no commentary track. And the two featurettes run a scant fifteen minutes each and neither do anything but scratch the surface of their subjects. The ability to watch the amazing train sequence of the film in both it's storyboard and film representations is nice though and does give the viewer a good idea of just how much time went into plotting the film's look and feel. All in all this is a good package of a great film. Fans of 'The Sixth Sense' should feel right at home.",995155200,2,2169,4.717678100263853
1295697,5,B00003CXQA,"Unbreakable was a great, great film. But not everyone thinks so. It may have been the film's deliberate slow pace; it may have been people were confused about it; or it may have been people were thinking this film would be a sequel to the Sixth Sense. I think it was the latter. Although this film, like the director's previous, did have a twist ending, that was not at all what it was about. The film, to me, was about a man who was confused about his place in the world and led to find who he was by the last person he'd expect. That is about the basis of it. It think that the screen writing and directing on this film were supurb. Some of the best around.
Without giving too much away, the film is about David Dunn, a man who miraculously survives a train wreck unharmed. He meets Elijah, who explains that certain people are made to help others with their ability to survive.
What this means is that even the most normal person is unique and can be a hero.
Hopefully with this in mind you will realixe this movie is great and if you, the average movie viewer, watch it carefully and with patience, you will understand it and appreciate it for what it is and what it says.",995155200,5,1176,4.254464285714286
1295698,2,B00003CXQA,"We recognize Night Shyamalan's obscureness and awkwardness into this rather unjustifyingly long film. Everytime I review a movie I can almost always come up with one of two conclusions. Either the potential of the movie was entirely exploited - which is relatively rare and in which case a movie can be characterized as a masterpiece and I feel in my heart that I have to give it five stars - or, the potential was only partially exploited. Unbreakable belongs to the second category. The idea is great, the plot entertaining and original, the cast proper, the characters round and fairly developed. However... the movie is empty. As the minutes went by this question always kept popping in my head : ""Where is the matter??""
We can sense that Shyamalan has a burning desire to make the movie sound interesting and deep. However he did not succeed. We look at some scenes thinking : ""okay, this is supposed to be deep, and the producer really intended to make it deep, the way the characters behave and the way Willis is constantly daydreaming... but the truth is that it is a fake depth, it is totally empty and superficial."" That was the impression I had when I watched the film. Whereas in the Sixth Sense, I felt a true depth and entertainment. Unbreakable left me with a taste of entertainment, and when the movie was over my disappointment was at its highest, because I thought it would get some kind of entertaining towards the end... but no. I sensed Shymalan did not have enough material but needed to make a long story anyway, and decided to throw some empty scenes all over. Although I really appreciated the work done by Samuel L. Jackson, I know he might regret being part of the cast, because this is not likely to be the role that suits him the most.
I mostly have this sensation that Night Shyamalan could have created so much more, could have made a much more entertaining movie. I agree that mystery is good, but an excess of mystery is not natural and leads to boredom and disappointment. I don't know how to say it. Something was missing in this movie... maybe just a few very coherent and intelligent minutes, and I would have given it an additional star. Nonetheless, I have to give credit to Shyamalan for the very original twisted ending of this film. I believe he should be hired to create all the ending of all the mystery movies ever made, because in my opinion he has a lot of talent in closing. Gives just enough shock, and leaves just enough unknown to allow a sequel to be produced. If it is indeed, I certainly hope the matter will be deeper and richer than ""Unbreakable""'s.

That's definitely the theme throughout the whole movie where we see how a normal person would react upon realizing that he's above normal men. There's no campiness like Batman and Robin. No flashy costumes. No over-the-top special effects and action sequences which would thouroughly ruin some movies. Instead, we get a more solemn, serious look at a superhero who's not quite sure what he is and if he wants the responsibility of his new found abilities.  Also, on the second disc we get to see some deleted scenes which were quite well done as it's introduced by the writer between each sequence.

1295702,5,B00003CXQA,"I was disappointed with The Sixth Sense because I thought the movie lacked cohesion and had too many details slapped on that weren't really explained, nor were they necessary.
However, Unbreakable is a totally different story.  It was deliberate, gripping, intriguing, and yet somehow, it still possessed an unimposing finesse.
I did not leave this film with a sense of having finished watching a ""comic book story"".  I felt like I had watched simply ""a story"", and I don't expect a sequel, follow-up, or an explanation.  The ending was sufficient, the movie self-contained. Unbreakable was an unfolding of a fable, a practical impossibility portrayed in a very real manner.
The camerawork, music, lighting, choice of color, and soft-focus effects (in certain shots) sustained the perfect mood and atmosphere.  The movie and images literally never let up.
I was even more impressed when I recognized the gentle usage of symbolism--the super-hero's costume serving as a disguise AND protection from his mortal weakness.  The father's teenage son, the embodiment of all mere-mortal adolescents who wish they could manifest their desires to be exceptional, yet can do so only in their imaginations.  I got a bit misty-eyed when David reveals the truth to his child--the unabashed awe and love shared in that moment was priceless.
This movie held me spellbound, and afterwards, I was not left griping, ""But how come?!  And why the heck?!"" as I was after The Sixth Sense.  I believe this movie was handled more carefully and the utmost attention was paid to detail, and to wonderful effect.
If Shayamalan can create such ""fables"" in as meticulous a manner in the future, and with as much resonance and as little contrivance as in Unbreakable, I may actually start paying to go to movies in theatres again.  The feeling I was left with after watching this movie is more than worth the price of admission.",995155200,,1898,5.019108280254777

What many people seem too ignorant to understand is that ""Unbreakable"" is the first film in a trilogy. I view it simply as an introductory chapter to a brilliant story. Pick up a book and read(or is that asking too much now days?) the first chapters. How fast-paced was it? Probably not very.
I first saw this movie at the theater, and with the knowledge that it would have sequels. My parents rented it just last week, and liked it, to a degree. I could tell that the ending didn't really agree with them too much. I then told them it was the first in three, and I could tell right off by knowing that fact that they respected the film much more.
I think that Shyamalan is a level above the thinking of the impatient masses, and that shows when you read many of these negative reviews.

Now, with that out of the way, let me say that this is a DIFFICULT film to review.  I wanted to give it 3 stars based on the film's ""shaky"" storyline, but 5 stars for its breathtaking idea of taking a classic story and trying to mold it into the REAL world.  A superhero in our society?  How would that work?  How would he discover his powers?  In this light, the film works beautifully in terms of self-doubt on Bruce Willis' part and almost religious fervor on Samuel Jackson's.  And let's face it...it tries to delve a little more into a human being becoming a superhero based on knowledge and character as opposed to ""Super *whatever* one day stumbles into a radioactive factory, has these powers, and for some inexplicable reason finds himself compelled to do good for everyone!""
However, the plot jolts around a little while and one almost feels compelled to bang your head against the screen and tell Bruce Willis to ""get on with it!""  Still, once one comes back to earth and realizes that the story IS supposed to take place in the real world, it becomes a little more plausible--as plausible as fictitious superheroes get.
Enjoy the film!  It's not the strongest story and the ending is a little bit on ""ehhhh..."" side, but it is groundbreaking in its premise.

Now, I'm so glad I didn't waste my precious time in the theater for this stupid movie. The story is ridiculous and the editing is really bad. You get irritated watching 2 shadows talking to each other at a distance or from the reflection of something, and it goes on until the next scene. You can't use the same technique from ""the 6th sense"" on this movie. I bet ""Unbreakable"" would have turned out more exciting if it was done by someone else...",994809600,2,592,4.294642857142857
1295768,5,B00003CXQA,"When Unbreakable was released, Bruce Willis confirmed that the film was the first in a proposed trilogy. Viewed in that context, this is a tantalizing and audaciously low-key thriller, with a plot that twists in several intriguing and unexpected directions. Standing alone, however, this somber, deliberately paced film requires patient leaps of faith--not altogether surprising, since this is writer-director M. Night Shyamalan's daring follow-up to The Sixth Sense. While just as assured as that earlier, phenomenal hit, Unbreakable is the work of a filmmaker whose skill exceeds his maturity, its confident style serving a story that borders on juvenile. However, Shyamalan's basic premise--that comic books are the primary conduit of modern mythology--is handled with substantial relevance. Willis plays a Philadelphia security guard whose marriage is on the verge of failing when he becomes the sole, unscathed survivor of a devastating train wreck. When prompted by a mysterious, brittle-boned connoisseur of comic books (Samuel L. Jackson), he realizes that he's been free of illness and injury his entire life, lending credence to Jackson's theory that superheroes--and villains--exist in reality, and that Willis himself possesses extraordinary powers. Shyamalan presents these revelations with matter-of-fact gravity, and he draws performances (including those of Robin Wright Penn and Spencer Treat Clark, as Willis's wife and son) that are uniformly superb. The film's climactic revelation may strike some as ultimately silly and trivial, but if you're on Shyamalan's wavelength, the entire film will assume a greater degree of success and achievement.",994809600,,1664,5.795918367346939

A frequent statement seems to be ""oh, it's not as good as the Sixth Sense"". Well, guess what....this isn't the Sixth Sense Part II. This is a different movie and if you keep repeating the same formula well, you will be making Mummy films.
M. Knight is a great writer because he forces the audience to pay attention. Let's be honest, if you were watching The Mummy Returns and left for 10 minutes you didn't miss anything critical. Here, you would. The little details that he adds to his films make them so fresh and entertaining.
The rumor is that this could be turned into a trilogy, and if so, we have the entire backstory to all. As far as the ending, not as shocking but just as good. It fit the story.",994809600,,816,4.339869281045751

It just seemed like a lot of filler just to get to the end.  Samuel L. Jackson turned in his worst performance to date and really disappointed me because I'm a fan of evertyhing(except for this) that he's done.  This could have been a half-hour movie and still had the same impact.  This is not he kind of entertainment you pay to see.  This was a made-for-tv movie.

So now comes Unbreakable, with a premise that is wonderful. Our culture is bereft of Heroes and we're offered, in the best comic book tradition, a wary, unwilling, unwitting hero. Willis's performance in this film (as it was in The Sixth Sense) is just a splendidly controlled one; and Jackson, as always, is never less than completely watchable. As the ultimate ""breakable"" man, Jackson is angry, inscrutable, and brilliant.
The director has a wonderful feel for children, for their fears and sensitivities; and Spencer Treat Clark turns in a fine performance as Willis's son, as does Robin Wright Penn as his long-suffering wife.
Ninety percent of this film is highly compelling. The viewer anxiously, eagerly accompanies Willis along the path to recognition of his ""super"" powers, at the urging of cartoon connoisseur Jackson. We arrive at a satisfactory climax where our hero's powers get tested. It's a strong, chilling sequence. And then, splat, the whole thing falls to pieces with an entirely unbelievable ending. Sadly, it's all too obvious that the director, M. Night Shyamalan, just couldn't think of a viable resolution for the tale he'd constructed. And that's a pity, because this could have been a great film but ends up as a misfire.

I especially found the young boy to be bland, a cross between Haley Joel Osment in The sixth sense and the boy in The Shining.  One doesn't know whether to be afriad and disturbed or sympathetic.  The premise is rather preposterous, although it might have been engrossing without the superhero sub-plot.  When Willis dons a cape-like poncho and heads into the night to go save someone, anyone, the film becomes as transparent as glass, which is interesting because glass seems an overused symbol throughout the film.

Samuel L Jackson plays a person who has very brittle bones, Bruce Willis plays a man who walked away from a train wreck as the only survivor.  SLJ belives that comic book characters are based on real life people and has been trying to find BW by tracking major accidents to see if anyone survives.  When he does find him he keeps trying to convince BW of his theory.  Meanwhile the issues at home are kind of on the back burner and not really devloped.

However this is possibly the slowest movie I've seen in a long time.  I've seen Ingmar Bergman movies that move faster than this one.  Part of the problem to me is that the story and idea behind the movie suggest a thinking man's action movie.  Not that every movie I see has to have big explosions or anything, but there was nothing here.  By the time that the Willis character takes on his new 'identity,' you're so bored that it really doesn't matter.  Even the big train wreck that sets up the movie is not shown, just the aftermath from the view of a helicopter.
Now I'm pretty sure that the director was deliberately going away from the action so he could focus on the story and characters.  But - come on, we need something to move the story along.  The plodding pace made it very difficult to sit through.

A lot of the reviews on this site complain that the movie is bad because it is ""so slow paced""  It is suppose to be slow paced.  What most people don't get about this great movie is that it isn't an action flim or a triller, but a movie about realization.  It is about one man trying to come to terms with what he might be. This movie, in my mind, is one of a kind.  Bruce Willis and Sam Jackson both give great performances. I really liked the ending which manying people also complain about.

Seeing the movie for a second time, you realize just how brilliant this film is.  It is the Anti-Matrix for comic book fans.  It is a very stylish film- camera angles look to be lifted from graphic novels and comics; however there is little to no action.  It's not a comic book movie about beating up the bad guys.  It's a realistic comic movie wherein the protagonist slowly understands and believes his place in the world.  That is much more interesting than a guy who had a messed up childhood and takes his anger out on all crooks in his rubber suit.
If you are a first time viewer keep in mind throughout the film, this is an Origin story- a story where we are told how a man becomes a superhero.  If you are a repeat viewer i hope you enjoyed this film as much as i did my second time.
As far as the packaging goes, i'd give the disc a 9.  If there was a commentary, i would have given it a 10.  The movie is a 10, the dvd is a 9.  Video and Audio quality is perfect.  special features are cool.  enjoy.",994550400,,1172,4.047826086956522
1295873,5,B00003CXQA,"I'm not usually a Bruce Willis fan by any means. I've read  though that whenever he had to audition for a role, early in his career, he literally blew hundreds of other actors out of the water with his audition.  I can believe he has that much talent based on this film and a few of his others.  Here you can see it with an end scene he has, with the boy who plays his son in this movie, when he shares a newspaper article with him at the breakfast table. It is good to see Willis recently not wasting such talent on abysmal films.  I've also been greatly disappointed by the junk movies Samuel L. Jackson has been in lately when his early roles showed such consummate ability.  Thus, both actors took me by considerable surprise playing the mirror images of one another in this film, starting with Willis's character's being the sole survivor of a train wreck.

 Willis is all but unbreakable, like a superhero in a comic book, as he comes to discover with Jackson's help, whereas Jackson's bones  break so easily he was called ""Mr. Glass"" as a kid. Jackson now runs an art gallery which features comic book art.  Willis's character does not yet know his role in the universe whereas Jackson's seems to know the roles for both of them. Willis resists his theories mightily though.  Writer-director M. Night Shyamalan also made ""Sixth Sense"" and I must credit him for having a wonderful imagination that doesn't just recycle and reuse Hollywood ideas already overused.  He also can make a gripping film without using explosions, car crashes, gunfire, blood and guts and the other, more usual action-adventure props.

Shyamalan is fascinated by comic books as both art form and myth maker and brings that fascination home to us. Robin Wright Penn and Spencer Treat Clark play Willis's wife and son. Shyamalan is very good at handling child actors in his films and Clark adds a lot to the story line with his belief in his father's powers. Robin Wright Penn is fast becoming the solid character actress upon whom directors can really rely.  They probably picked up on that fact from her husband's (Sean Penn) using her in his films to marvelous effect.

Samuel L Jackson's character is great and is a breath of fresh air from his usual roles.  However, there was one point which seemed to be the most gratutitous example of product placement that I've ever seen (featuring a carton of Tropicana fruit juice), and from that point on it seemed to go comically downhill.  The 'twist' at the end appeared obvious from about halfway through, and it all seemed to end quite abruptly.  I was left feeling afterwards that the film was more of an introduction (similar to the X Men) rather than a complete work in itself.  Obviously I would say to watch it and make up your own mind, but personally, I didn't think it was a patch on The Sixth Sense.",994550400,,838,4.509933774834437
1295875,4,B00003CXQA,".... I consider ""Unbreakable"" one of the the best movies I have seen in the last few years.  Most people who disliked the movie were looking for a fast action style movie and probably wanted David Dunn (Willis' character) to become a hero faster and fight an arch enemy setting the stage for countless bad sequels.
Unbreakable is really the story of the modern world's first superhero, and how he struggles to come to terms with the fact that he is superhuman.  I feel that Unbreakable portrays this in a great manner.  It shows Dunn is not perfect.  He has a crappy job, and is on the verge of splitting from his wife.  He nearly cheats on his wife prior to the train wreck.  He keeps his son at a great distance.
Despite this, he knows there is something missing from his life.  He doesn't know what it is, but he knows he is missing something.  This makes him partially susceptible to the enigmatic Elijah Wood (aka Mr. Glass due to a genetic disorder that makes him particularly likely to break his bones).
Both of these men seek to know what their place in the world is supposed to be, and Wood (Samuel L. Jackson) hopes to use Dunn to finally find his place.

I cannot tell you how deeply this second film by Shyamalan affected me. And yes, this film AFFECTS you. The complaints about lack of action? Forget them. This is not a Die Hard flick. This is an incredible film Hitchcock would praise and profess jealousy. Bruce Willis does NOT have to destroy cities to be a great leading man. He ACTS. Willis portrays the same sort of character as his role in the Sixth Sense: a character with depth, feelings, and a certain talent I shall not name. He ACTS. As does Samuel L. Jackson. He is...Oh, wait 'til the ending! If you think Mahler symphonies lead you around corners, so does this film. The soundtrack takes you by the nose and shoves your emotions in the right directions.

As for Unbreakable, Shyamalan decided to have another twist at the end, but this time, he forgot to make the rest of the movie.  It was utterly forgettable and weak.",994464000,5,321,4.406779661016949
1295878,5,B00003CXQA,"M. Night Shyamalan struck a gold mine when his film ""The Sixth Sense"" was released in 1999, bringing in overwhelming audiences and garnering Oscar nominations including a nod for Best Picture. It is one of the films that will go down in history, not so much as a movie like, for instance, ""Titanic,"" but still will be remembered.
""Unbreakable,"" his follow-up feature to that success, didn't do as good as its predecessor, and upon watching it for the first time, I can't understand why. There are elements at work throughout its discourse that, under Shyamalan's brilliant direction, fit together in an intricate puzzle that comes to an earth-shattering halt with the film's ending. It's a brilliant and complex piece of filmmaking.
Like ""Sense,"" this film contains a mystery surrounding a central character, though this one isn't haunted by ghosts who need favors. ""Unbreakable"" begins with a horrific train accident, seen only through television footage and through the gauze of the last dying passenger as the sole survivor, David Dunn (Bruce Willis), looks on in a dazed silence. There is no scene of gory bloodshed, no sequence of special effects or derailing train cars... Shyamalan is able to prove that, through visceral images of victims' relatives and their expressions, the devastation of such an event can be just as effective without the use of a special effect.
As the story continues, more pieces of David's life come into play: his marriage is suffering, he goes into deep depression, and that, added to questions he has about the fact that he suffered no injuries, not even so much as a single scratch, plague him each day. His work as a security guard seems like any other job to him, until he meets a man named Elijah (Samuel L. Jackson), who believes that comic book heroes walk the Earth.
Elijah's life also has many complications: he suffers from a disease which causes his bones to break easily, ever since childbirth. His belief stems from his illness, that just as he is someone who is completely weak, there must be someone on the opposite end of the spectrum who is equally as strong. As he guides David through to the realization of his place in the world, a bigger revelation is at work, someone even as strong as David cannot withstand.
In a slow, emotional process, Shyamalan brings out the best and worst of his characters. In taking his time with the story, he is able to allow David to evolve from a hardened, unbelieving survivor into someone forever changed by the realization that the he possesses can be put to good use. I'm not going to reveal just how he comes to that realization: that's for you to find out. But I will say this: it's sheer brilliance.
The story structure for this film bears striking resemblance to ""The Sixth Sense,"" but does not fail in keeping us intrigued. It begins by introducing the characters, and developing them in the midst of a very involving mystery. It then evolves into a story of realization and revelation, and just as in the previous film, there's a surprise twist ending, one that is more shocking and unexpected.
Shyamalan made the right choice in bringing Bruce Willis back for this project; one could even go so far as to say that the part was written especially for him. Once again, Willis is able to define himself as a true actor, one that can go from the guns and bombs of ""Die Hard"" to the sentimentality of a man whose belief in everything is shaken in this film. Cast opposite him is Samuel L. Jackson as Elijah, who also proves he is just as effective in a wheelchair as he is on his feet.
So why would this film not be as great a success as its predecessor? The answer may lie with the audience. ""The Sixth Sense"" drew many crowds of various types of people, the kind of people who generally don't see movies of this sort. ""Unbreakable"" is a much darker film, and I guess that was a turnoff for some people.
But who cares? ""Unbreakable"" is everything you'd expect out of a movie and more. There's the same subtle suspense and rising intensity you'd expect from its director, the same magic, the same awe-inspiring brilliance. Everything fits together, it's dynamic, it's intriguing. There's not enough praise for a movie like this, one of the best films of 2000.",994464000,2,4252,4.716397849462366

Full of characterization and mood, Shyamalan and his cast weave an absorbing tale that provides a unique look in the world of superheroes.

While the twist ending isn't that big a surprise, it caps things off nicely. The DVD extras are very good with 2 featurettes, including an examination of comic-books with Jackson and some of today's hottest comic-book artists and writers. There's also a multi-angle feature of one of the more pivotal scenes, as well as a VERY early film clip that Shyamalan did that seems to be put there just for laughs and to show that he doesn't take himself TOO seriously.

The surprise ending isn't that big a surprise, you can see it coming quite a ways off. It's more the movie itself that's the surprise.
As I was not particularly impressed by The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable convinced me of M. Night Shyamalan's talents. This movie is not The Sixth Sense, nor is it a Die Hard. It is a slower, more deliberate movie lead by emotion with just the right mix of plot and character development.

Night Shyamalan puts the art of story telling  and creative plots back into movies.  This one's a winner.",994291200,2,776,4.576642335766423

Well, I was very in tune with the movie all the way through, and had NO IDEA that it would turn out the way it did!  I had some guesses about Sam Jackson's involvement, but not to the extent that was revealed in the end.  My wife watched it with me, and she agreed that the ending was outstanding and unexpected.
I have to say that I really enjoyed this movie.  It is definitely not a let-down in any way.",994204800,13,637,4.0396825396825395
1295934,2,B00003CXQA,"This movie is a great disappointment. With interesting plot and deep philosophical message, it could have been a great movie. Unfortunately for the viewer, this promising set up has been turned into a boring crimi with unclear purpose. On top of everything, both main actors' performance (B. Willis and S.L. Jackson) fell behind their usual qualities. Avoid this one unless you are a diehard fan of one of the two main actors!",994204800,4,426,4.930555555555555
1295935,2,B00003CXQA,"Okay, it's not unwatchable. But the fact that this did not gross half of what the 6th Sense did should tell you that it is a seriously flawed film. So regardless of anyone's opinion or review, that fact alone is very significant in comparing this film to Night's previous work, which everyone (including Night) wants to do.
This film is about a security Guard, David Dunn (Bruce Willis) who after miraculously surviving a train wreck without a scratch is contacted by a comic book art collector named Elijah (Samuel Jackson). Elijah has a terrible bone disease which causes him to have breaks constantly. He is the weakest of men. He contacted David because he was intrigued by his survival. We find out very quickly - so much for suspense - that Elijah believes David could be a real life superhero, straight from the comic books. The rest of the film is about David coming to terms with this at Elijah's prompting and direction.
To anyone who would call this a masterpiece of filmmaking, I would propose several serious flaws in this film, which exist on practically every level of its substance.
1. *General* - Night tried to remake the 6th Sense. In practically every way, shape, and form this film tried to be like its predecessor, and that in itself is not only a flaw, but a little annoying. This is a small flaw, but the most rudimentary of all of them, so I included it first.
2. *Premise* - I could just honestly not believe that a top filmmaker thought it would be a good idea to make a film about a real superhero. If we're talking about Mystery Men, then fine. But this was a serious film that was quoting comic books as though they were doctrinal. The main problem here, however, is more in the presentation of the concept (see below).
3. *Presentation* - If you have the DVD of the 6th Sense, you've seen a documentary in which Night makes mention of the fact that in writing the story, he deliberately ignored the reason that Osmet could see dead people. That was not the point of the film and to try and explain it would have greatly lessened its impact. Well, he should have taken his own advice in Unbreakable. Had he not included comic books as our ultimate source of truth regarding David's powers, this would have been an immensely better film. Then we would have a movie about a man who begins to realize he has a strange strength about him. This is noticed by a mysterious man named Elijah, who is intrigued by David's strength, since he himself is debilitated. Then David applies his strength to helping people, we still have our surprise ending, etc. But there would not be the ridiculous concept of comic book heroes involved. The audience should have been left to realize the movie was about a superhero by themselves, rather than have it crammed down their throat beginning before the credits even roll (Night puts up a little fact sheet about comic book collecting in America at the film's opening). Then the viewers would have left the theater saying, ""Wow, that was about a superhero,"" rather than ""Wow...that was about a superhero."" When Elijah calls David to tell him that his memory was jogged while reading issue 117 of Super Slimeman (or something) and that the reason he (David) almost drowned is because like every great superhero he has a weakness, I was reminded of the cast of Galaxy Quest figuring out how they defeated the Pod People in episode 325. One big difference - Galaxy Quest is a comedy. Unbreakable is not.
4. *Premise* - I know I already mentioned this, but wow. I still can't believe someone thought this was a good idea.
5. *Direction* - The film was annoyingly artsy. Every scene had to be filmed in a mirror, or with a swinging door that blocks our view of someone, or upside down, or from above, etc., etc., etc. It was distracting and put a distance between the film and the viewer. Night needs to just take it down a notch or two and get back to the fundamentals or filmmaking.
6. *Story Presentation* - The story was told in a boring, drab and predictable method. It was anticlimactic in several scenes, mostly because Night insisted upon ""artfully (see above)"" ending them in unnatural methods to try and shock the audience. It just didn't work. Also in the anti-climactic category, I found it bothersome that in David's very first episode as a superhero he finds himself smack-dab in the middle of a swimming pool, his only weakness. In his first adventure as a superhero. No foreshadowing, no drama, nothing. It just happens his first time out. And then we have the big surprise ending. Well, most people saw it coming a good five minutes before it happened. It was not masked nearly as well as the 6th Sense. More than that, it was so ridiculous that it was laughable rather than shocking. If the film took place in Gotham City, then maybe. But it took place in the real world. Lastly, what was this whole deal with him moving to New York and his wife and so forth...? That kind of got brushed aside.
7. *Believability* - This is different than premise, though the premise definitely falls into this category. But even if you can buy the premise of the film (and that's asking a lot) there are other serious problems with the believability of it. For example, David is a security guard. This means that he would have to occasionally rough people up, right? Basically, he would be a man who is in touch with his masculine side. So even in the remote corners of fathomable credibility where this film exists, how did David not notice that he was just a tad stronger than the average Joe? I'm sorry, but somebody who could bench press nearly 400 pounds would just simply be aware that something was not normal. And apparently superheroes have chronically bad memories. Have you ever met someone who did not know whether they had been sick before? People who have never been sick know it - always - and they are normally proud of that fact. They don't have to ask everyone they know if they remember a time when they were sick.
8. *Premise* - Did I mention premise?
9. *Characters* - This is the last one, I promise. The characters in this film are all incredibly unlikable and stagnant. There is very little life to them and the audience has a difficult time caring about what happens to them as a result.
So this is what happens when filmmakers hit it big, as Night did with the 6th sense. They are allowed to make anything they want, no questions asked, just a bunch of yes-men surrounding them. No quality-control, just go ahead and do it. Hopefully Night got whatever it is he needed to out of his system and can get back to making good films.",994118400,13,6611,4.5703454085930915
1295936,3,B00003CXQA,"I liked the concept of a real-life superhero, but the movie was too slow.  The movie seemed to just be focusing on the same fact 75% of the movie without making any real progress.  The ending was pretty good, better than Sixth Sense's in my opinion, but that could be because I was so set on figuring out the surprise ending for the Sixth Sense, that I managed to figure it out halfway through the movie.  I was kinda annoyed by Samuel L Jackson's character as well, I just couldn't understand why he was so set on believing superhero's exist.  I mean, they do explain his reasoning in the movie, but he's a grown-man that should know better.  That, and his choice of black leather and obsession of comics reminds me all too much of those wierd kids obsessed with anime in high school (no offense to any otaka out there).",994118400,,821,4.410596026490066
1295937,3,B00003CXQA,"My first impression of this movie is how incredibly well Night Shyamalan can create a scene through lighting, sound and angles.  This worked incredibly well in the acclaimed ""The Sixth Sense"" and worked well with Bruce Willis' bland, subdued delivery.  It would be safe to say that most of us approached ""Unbreakable"" with the same expectations of surreal twists and unexpected revelations under soft light and flash-cuts.  During the first ten minutes, you know this is the same guy who creeped you out in ""Sixth"" and you cannot help but anticipate the same kind of ride.
It works...to a point. This movie is the first act of a triology on the subject where one man discovers he has superheroic abilities, but not in the cheesy, spandex-clad tradition of film and comic books.  It puts the characters into a very real context and painstakingly manufactures our belief in the characters.  If you take this movie as a one-shot knock off, I'm afraid you'll be disappointed, but if you accept this is only the beginning and follow the story as an ""origin"" of a hero or transformation of a character, you will understand it, but I you may - as I did - feel created that there wasn't more to the ride.  It is a self-contained story about ""rebirth"". This, however, is not enough for a good movie in my opinion.  Here's why...
The screen is gorgeous.  But what goes on is tedious. Willis mugs and grimaces with little animation, while Robin Wright Penn serves as the flat cardboard wife with little to contribute but another complication to the main character's life.  Their child is creepy, weepy and somewhat distracting in his role (clearly meant for Haley Joel Osmet since the replacement looks a lot like the current star of A.I.)  Samuel L. Jackson gets to preach again - something we've seen in every good role he's had from Pulp Fiction to Star Wars.  And while his character is one of genius, he is little more than Yoda in the Star Wars movies, a facilitating expository character who we are forced to believe is more important than he is.  He is, to extend the Star Wars metaphor, a Darth Maul...a very cool character misused and too easily dismissed from the story.
So we have characters swimming on a beautifully shot canvas, whispering to one another and performing scenes that are sometime interesting, often dull, enevitably predictable.
The DVD itself contains some deleted scenes that are also gorgeous, and sadly more thought-provoking than the scenes left in.  The documentaries included will thrill comic book readers who dig that sort of conversation and gives audiences an appeal to understand the film better if they watch a second time.  We're also treated to a short scene from Shyamalan's childhood filmmaking days on Disk 2 to remind us how far he's come since VHS home movies.",994118400,,2798,4.802083333333333
1295938,5,B00003CXQA,"I just saw ""Unbreakable"" for the second time, and I can honestly say it is one of my all-time favorite movies.  Having grown up with comic books, the premise of the movie is intriguing and, in my opinion, has more depth than M. Night Shyamalan's last movie, The Sixth Sense.  While I enjoyed the Sixth Sense, this movie just blows it away.

  The first time I saw this movie, I was a little confused because I came into it only knowing it was about some guy that never gets hurt and then another guy that gets hurt really easily...I hadn't heard much about the ""comic book as modern day mythology"" aspect of the film.  M. Night Shyamalan's ideas about comic books are very thought-provoking and show his brilliance and creativity as a writer.  While being relatively young, it appears Shyamalan has conquered the thriller genre like few others have.  After completing my second viewing, the final exchange between Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson still sends shivers down my spine, like no other movie has done.

  The bottom line is that everything about this movie is excellent.  There is absolutely nothing like it, and originality...and brilliance...are severely lacking in the movie industry today.  I am looking forward to following Shyamalan's career in the future, as I find his style of movie making a unique and incredible experience.  I hope he chooses to revisit these characters later in his career since I have heard rumors of ""Unbreakable"" being the first in a proposed trilogy.  You owe it to yourself to see this movie...Also, the dvd edition has some great bonus features worth checking out.",994118400,2,1611,4.8498168498168495
1295939,5,B00003CXQA,"I liked this movie better than Shyamalan's last flick, The Sixth Sense. In all fairness, people shouldn't even compare the two, because they deal with two different things. Shyamalan's directing at times is inventful, but sometimes it makes you look more at how the camera angle is  rather than the plot or characters. Bruce Willis, gives a great performance, and Sam Jackson does well...aswell. THe extras are great, specifically the deleted scenes. Some of them I wish had been left in. The sound is incredible, I hope you got 5.1. The color is so crisp and rich. It's a great DVD to get for your self or as a present. Get it.",994118400,,628,4.607142857142857
1295940,4,B00003CXQA,"Though I do have my favorite comic book titles, I'm not the biggest fan of comic books.  Most comic books still embody a very hyped vision of the world, which overwhelms most underlying context their stories try to embody.  For such a readily-hyped topic as superheroes (even X-Men, with its fairly accessible portrayal of superheroes, contained hype), this movie is very down to earth and back to the basics.  What do you do when you realize that you have the power to right wrongs in the world?  Forget jazzy outfits, fame, fancy names, glitzy secret identities, sprawling brawls, or psyches brimming with bubbling angst, what if you, the reader, had the power to right wrongs, but you just never knew that you could?  We all have such power, but, for most, that power remains untriggered, and we are oblivious to it.  Thus, David Dunn.  M. Night Shyamalan does all he can to subdue any glitz or glamour you might feel for this superhero: subdued colors, subdued dialog, even the subdued fight scene near the end (no drawn out combat, that), even the subdued hero's music (no John William's blaring Superman theme, still it evokes this sense of superheroism).  We're left with people we can relate to, who aren't drowning in hype.
For those who can't stand the pretentiousness of Shyamalan's scenes: I could practically see the word balloons coming out of the character's mouths.  Every scene in this movie evoked the sensation of reading a moving comic book.  Comic book artists take many liberties with perspective.  Open most comic books (two examples: Watchmen, AstroCity), and you'll see scenes very similar in look and feel to those in this movie.  Hopefully, you'll better understand where Shyamalan's coming from visually, even if you don't like it.  No movie has ever evoked such a parallel for me, and I was impressed.
Keep in mind, after all of this, we're left with something slow and stylized, and, yes, as stunning as it was, perhaps with too much punchline.  So be warned.
For those who aren't happy with Elijah Price's bizarre view of the world (comics are descended from ancient stories, blah blah), read Scott McCloud's Understanding Comics.
Aside from all of this, let's face it: Samuel L Jackson has never seemed breakable, except for here.  How does he do it?",994118400,,2282,4.875647668393782

1295982,2,B00003CXQA,This whole movie was like the introduction to a bigger and better movie. With some severe editing and about another 300% more plot to tack onto the end it might have been a good movie - you get my point? Don't waste your time. ;),994032000,2,229,4.111111111111111
1295983,5,B00003CXQA,"If your like me, you liked ""The Sixth Sense"", but hated Haley Joel Osment.  A lot of people aren't a fan of the kid, and I'm one of them.  Although I do give him credit, because he can act extremely well... he just annoys me.  So, going into ""Unbreakable"", I had a few mixed emotions.  I didn't even know what the plot was, just knew that it was another thriller from Shyamalan, who, under the right circumstances, is a genius.  In my estimation, this just so happens to be one of those circumstances.  In the opening minutes, the camerawork involved got me worked up, and anticipating what was to come.
Of course, if you've seen the trailors for the film, you know the basic outline: Bruce Willis becomes the Sole Survivor of a train wreck, and oddly enough, he comes out of it with not even a scratch.  He gets a mysterious letter, which makes him think about how many times he's been sick.  He can't remember a time when he was ill, and eventually meets Elijah, whose convinced that Willis contains superpowers, and just might be a superhero?  A lot of mind-boggling things happen after this, and the story only develops for the better.
The thing that made me love this so damn much was the entire movie was like the first act of a regular superhero movie.  Usually the hero accepts his powers, and goes on to save the world, but Bruce Willis just doesn't want this power/burden.  The ending is one of the best I've seen in a while, and Willis and Shyamalan are thinking about making a trilogy.  A trilogy would definitely be good, but leaving it where it is now would be even better.  The film is almost flawless.
The DVD isn't a slouch either.  The only other thing I wanted on this was an audio commentary, with Shyamalan, Willis, and Jackson.  That would make it a perfect package.  The transfer is beautiful(the colors are brought out magnificently), and the audio is just as lovable.  I loved the score to the film.  On the second disc are a few fun, informative featurettes that could have been a little bit longer.  There's also a multi-angle, multi-audio ""deconstruction"" of a scene that will probably only suit movie-buffs and film students.  Next up, there's a slew of deleted scenes which were really good, instead of the usual trash found with most deleted scenes.  They could have been very important in the telling of the film, but would have really slowed down the pacing.  Lastly, there's a hilarious bit in which M. Night Shyamalan includes another one of his extremely funny ""kid films"".  This one's entitled ""Night's First Fight"".  The sound effects and acting pretty much sum up what I'm talking about.
The film is stellar, as is the DVD.  If your a fan of thrillers, this is definitely up your alley, and go into it more open-minded than usual.  You'll enjoy it much more that way.",994032000,,2806,4.5843373493975905

1295985,2,B00003CXQA,"""Unbreakable"" is fair.  You see Bruce Willis' paycheck is huge, so cut out train accident sequence and just show a news junket of a crashed train.
Furthermore the sets are so dark you wonder why people are living in such depressed surroundings.  The plot itself is interesting and kept me watching, but as the movie progressed it got dumber and dumber.
Shyamalan shows up in the movie for a cameo (Does he think he is the next Hitchcock?)....Not on my life.
The characters never evolve, you never understand the relationship between Willis' character and his son, or his wife.
Other dead ends are with Samuel L. Jackson character who is nuts, but you wonder how he found Willis' and how he knew he had this special gift.
The movie is just digestible fare not worth a movie ticket admission, but okay for rental.

1295988,4,B00003CXQA,"A grown up superhero movie? How can it be done? Well, personally, (and please do bear in mind that this is only what I think!) I think the director and writer has done a superb job with this movie. The gradual awakening of David to his unbreakable abilities keeps you gripped to the edge of your seat.
The doubts he has of his own abilities are one of the best parts of the film. His son's complete belief in the abilities of his father made me wonder when I could stop holding my breath and continue to watch the film normally. You really do wonder what would have happened if he had been allowed to pull the trigger.
But without giving too much away, my only disappointment with the movie was that there was not just one more action scene at the end. The movie leaves you wanting more - maybe some people appreciate that in a film, but it's not something I enjoy particularly. But that twist - the Sixth Sense was an obvious one to me, but this one ..... I obviously don't read enough comic books !!",994032000,,1001,4.273684210526316

Bruce Willis played his role to perfection and portrayed his character with a gentle fragility few actors could ever pull off I hope this movie will have finally given most of his critics food for thought when commenting on his supposed limited acting skill.  Id have to disagree with them and say he's one of the finest actors in America. Samuel L. Jackson plays his menacing role equally perfectly with more than enough hair for everybody, check out the wig.  I loved the strength of determination in his physically fragile character.  Just like my sister said ""samuel L jackson rocks"". Unfortunately for Mr Shyamalan it would seem too many people were expecting too much of this film after the success of his Sixth sense (poor George Lucas and his phantom menace) as fantastic as his film is, it would always be clouded by his success with his last film. However I went and saw this film after watching the intriguing trailer and wanted to know more.  I didn't know what to expect and came out of the theatre very happy that i spent my hard earned cash to see this.  Its a superhero film like no other.  Its kept me thinking about each scene, the dialogue and the stunning ending which had my head spinning In the end it all fell perfectly into place...I couldn't recommend any other flick  as strongly as this one",994032000,3,1495,4.597744360902255

If you look at the trailer you will be expecting an intense thriller, but instead we are treated to a slow-moving psychological drama. The bad thing about the story is that it's already told within the first 30 minutes.
Then you have to sift through another hour and a half before the leading man, Bruce Willis, accepts this to be the truth.
I hated it after seeing it, BUT THEN :........ I discovered I was thinking about this movie the next day. So they must have done something right. I do hope they will release the sequels to this movie, so it will fall into place.",994032000,,693,4.257575757575758
1295991,5,B00003CXQA,"Unbreakable silently sneaked its way onto the big screen, then vaporized as if never there. Why?! Bruce Willis plays someone that is on the edge of loosing everything: his family. Though the topic of unfaithfullness is addressed you can tell that there is something truly devistating between his life, and his wife's (Robin Wright Penn). The once avid spark of love has fragmented and broken, and for this reason, he takes a train ride to get a new job in New York. If the job turns out, he is leaving his wife and son. It is on this train that something tragic, and wonderful happens. The train crashes, killing every passenger...except him. He survives without a scratch. Samuel L. Jackson plays a comic book dealer that is full of dark secrets, and knows after reading about Willis's survival in the train crash, that perhaps a life long search is over. Jackson is a character that has a disease in which he is very fragile, and breaks like glass. Maybe, just maybe, the survivor is his exact opposite. Someone that can withstand anything, and can't be sick, or injured. And, he believes, that superheroes could possibly exist. As he is fragile like glass, maybe there is someone on the other end of the spectrum that is unbreakable.
The reason Unbreakable is so important, is if in fact there is to be a trilogy about a hero, won't you wanna find out where he came from? What was his original drive? I think one day we will look back on this movie as the first superman, or matrix. The story behind the story. That does something great. It promises No Prequals, and No bloody six year wait, as in the Star Wars series. I recommend this movie for sixth sense fans, and to those of you who love a good surprise ending. And it helps if your tastes border on drama/thriller/suspense. After watching it once I bet you'll wanna watch it again. That to me is the first and foremost way to rate a movie...the re-watch factor. Once just ain't enough. Unbreakable taunts your brain and raises a lot of questions, and is entirely believable. As for other movies I had high hopes, but this time I wasn't let down. After you watch it you will probably roll the plot around in your mind and wonder whether or not you have ever been injured, sick, or broken... Well...have you?",993945600,,2266,4.57002457002457

I had never seen the movie and after I did, I have to say that I didn't feel cheated at the end. The movie tells the story of David Dunne (Bruce Willis), a security guard who's marriage is on the rocks. His situation is further exaccerbated when he's the lone survivor of a horrific train wreck and looks for answers that are barely obvious, but just slightly out of his sight. Then a comic book buff named Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson), who happens to have a disease that makes his bones very brittle, offers an answer that seems pretty far fetched and silly. But as the plot unfolds it becomes a bit clearer that it just may be the truth. To give away any of the plot would be greatly unfair. Viewers may not like how slowly the story unfolds, but I think that's the best part of the movie. Shyamalan is a director who does what most directors don't dare to do. He trusts the audience to read between the lines, and in that perspective I think the movie works and the subtle plot twists along the way work up to a great ending. It may have been more phenomenal had it not followed the powerhouse Sixth Sense, but nonetheless it's a great film that won't leave the viewer feeling cheated at the end.

this is a different film with a different plot and different approach.  Sure it was slow paced but to me it was the same pace as Sixth Sense.  The brilliant acting from Bruce Willis and Samuel L Jackson and also Dunn's son propels this from mediocre movie to great.  It also has a basic plot but it is the way it is executed that makes this a good movie.  The ending was definitely a surprise. I thought he was going to walk off the super hero and that would be the end but it wasn't and what happened adds another dimension to this film. If you want an all out action film like Die Hard 3 don't watch this but otherwise, You Must See it.",993945600,,814,4.266233766233766
1296044,4,B00003CXQA,"I think the assorted reviews here show that Unbreakable is a movie you'll either love or hate. As a confirmed comic geek, this movie was a dream come true, and the DVD even more so. It is a movie that treats the mythology of the superhero with the reverence and respect ignored by almost all the big budget comic-book adaptions.
The problem is most people aren't comic geeks. The mixture of gritty realism with the notion that a man can be born with super powers may seem like oil and water to those who've never heard of ""Watchmen"" or ""The Dark Knight Returns."" When I saw this movie in a theater, I distinctly recall the audience moaning and groaning at certain scenes, especially those involving Samuel Jackson's character. Many people I talked to afterwards also complained. I think what they fail to realize is that while Jackson's character seems surreal or worse, corny, it makes perfect sense. Quite simply, he's is a guy who's read too many comic books. To me, he doesn't seem corny or out of place at all. In fact, I think it was one of Jackson's best perfomances, and one of the top five of the year.
The pacing also proved trying to many. I know a few people who even walked out on it. People hear ""super-hero"" and they expect punches to be thrown immediately. Granted, the pacing can be a little slow at times, but I never said the movie is perfect.
From a technical standpoint, Night does an incredible job. His bizarre perspective's and subtle use of color and sound are extraordinary. Like ""Sixth Sense"" it requires several viewings to absorb. The performances, while understated (excluding Mr. Glass of course) are very genuine.
The second DVD included with the set contains some really great stuff. This movie had some of the best deleted scenes I've ever seen on a DVD. I also enjoyed the 20 minute feature on super-hero's and comics. It was awesome to see Will Eisner, Frank Miller and Dave Gibbons talk shop in a documentary format. I only wished it was longer. Maybe they'll include more in the sequel (Hope, hope, hope.)
So, while the movie isn't perfect, it's definitely worth seeing. If you can't get into the whole comic book angle, maybe you can relate to the ultimate theme of the story: finding your place in the world. While this may not be a traditional story of good and evil, it is a story of a single man's potential, for good or ill.",993945600,,2368,4.587264150943396
1296045,4,B00003CXQA,"M. Night Shyamalan and Bruce Willis team up for the second time in this modern fairytale about an everyday superhero. The film takes its time in both story- and characterbuilding, but it is a fine story with great acting, some surprising twists and even a little tension now and then. I won`t get into the discussion if it is better or worse than "" The sixth sense"". I think they are both brilliant movies.
The film comes in a beautiful paper box containing a fold-out which holds two discs. The first disc contains the movie, which is THX and simply brilliant in both sound and picture quality.
Disc 2 contains the extras which I find a bit sparse. It contains a behind the scenes featurette, a segment about comic books, 7 interesting deleted scenes introduced by the director and the possibility to watch the great train station sequence in film-to-storyboard comparison, and with optional sound effects- or music track only. All in all not bad, but I would have liked trailers, tv-spots, illustrations,storyboards and stills in a special edition like this.
Enclosed is also a ""collectible card"" with 2 Alex Ross illustrations. It is a fine card really, but I am getting tired of paper cards in my dvd`s.
So to Vista and other dvd producers ( in particular Warner Brothers) : please put the extras ON THE DVD instead of throwing in some worthless paper cards to call it a ""special edition"". Please !!!!",993945600,,1405,4.738775510204082

The ending of this film is outstanding totally blowing my mind. This is a must have...4 1/2 stars.,993859200,,259,4.531914893617022
1296047,2,B00003CXQA,"........you're about 10 years old!
ok - first - the ad campaigns are terribly misleading.  this isn't a ""change your life""/""i had a near-death-experience and massive awakening"" movie; if you go into it expecting this you will be sorely disappointed.  instead, this is a more serious type of *batman* or *superman* flick with a morose, monotone, somber, melodramatic superhero sans the exaggerations of ""supernatural"" powers and strength.
in other words this is a comic book on film - and little more.  really, that's the straight scoop on this flick; i kid you not!
the acting is good all around, considering that the mood of this film is droll and dreary throughout - i think there was ONE joke in the entire film; aside from that all of the characters bore the same overly serious expression.  (did any of the characters actually crack a smile at all??)
there could have been so much more to this movie had it been taken in the *fearless*/*awakenings*/*the game*/*cast away* direction.  but alas it was not.
and the ending - it is absolutely preposterous and mathematically ludicrous.  it makes no sense - either in its conception or in the fact that it ACTUALLY worked out from the character's perspective!!  but .......... if you keep in mind that this is basically a comic book on film, then the ending may be a bit easier to swallow.
on a positive note, i am forever grateful to M. Night Shyamalan for only taking 1:40 minutes to tell this story.  if this had been stretched out to 3 hours like *the green mile* or *magnolia* i would have to write a seriously disparaging review and subtract stars, etc., etc.  but as it is it's a two-star movie with a lame ending that only wastes 1:40 minutes of your life and offers a few interesting ideas as compensation (unlike *the green mile* or *magnolia* which had no redeeming qualities at all - can you tell how much i hated these movies? ...",993859200,2,1893,4.677710843373494
1296048,2,B00003CXQA,"This movie could have been sooooo much better.  The concept is phenomenal.  Shyamalan is able to introduce complex philosophical concepts in a ""Philosphy for Dummies"" way.
In Unbreakable, Shyamalan asks:  If people are built with disabilities that render them physically inferior to the general public...do other's posses abilities that render them physically superior (superhero-esque).
Unfortunately, this brilliant concept is delivered in a tediously slow package.  Shyamalan gets mired in the minutia.  After having watched the featurette on the DVD, I understand he wanted to delve into the human psyche.  In Sixth Sense, he delved just deep enough and left enough to the audience.  In this movie, Shyamalan comes off as unconfident of his abilities to tell a story and vastly underestimates the intelligence of the audience.
As far as the DVD is concerned...yes it does come with 2 DVD's, but DO NOT be fooled.  It has the same features as most movies have on 1 DVD.  It's a gratuitous marketing ploy.  The sound is adequate and pucture quality is standard.",993859200,2,1063,5.2

If you watch the film, & sorry if im spoiling the film, you have to watch the beginning to discover the hero. the middle to discover his powers & weekness, & the end to discover the enemy. It's quite suprising but i did not like it but in order to understand this film you have to understand the concept of a comic book. In the beginning a man named david dunn gets into a train wreck, killing over a hundred, except him. Then a lonely man notices him who runs a comic store discovers he has the story of a superhero as the film progresses. and as you will see this man is unbelievable. Some what unbreakable.

1296150,5,B00003CXQA,"The tendency to have an honest literary ending is one reason I like UNBREAKABLE.  It ends where it is supposed to end.  It ends where it would have ended in a short story.  We do not need to see Willis scrap it out with arch villain Jackson, though I think that might have made it a more successful movie.
The film does not ... as some reviewers claim.  In fact, it is quite good--as a story.  And the acting and direction are competent.  Call me a fool, but I am a big Bruce Willis fan (except for LAST MAN STANDING).  Maybe the problem with the movie is that with its honest ending, it had no business being a movie.  Perhaps it ... as cinema, at least for those who like their car chases and explosions at the end.  In that sense, then, I agree that there is no ""cinematic"" payoff.
Nevertheless, in the Twilight Zone/O Henry/Guy DeMaupassant tradition, it works marvelously.  There is a cerebral payoff.  You thought you knew what was happening, but you were wrong.  To make this movie good cinema, in the pop sense, the director would have had to include a bigger EXTERNAL story than the one he ultimately chose (psycho kidnaps/cohabits with family), and thereby allow the newly revealed hero to SAVE THE WORLD.  A bigger story might be a terrorist bombing of a major city, a dam's bursting, or the kidnapping of a First Lady.  He might also have allowed Samuel L. Jackson to give the fledgling hero a WORTHY PHYSICAL challenge, now that he (Jackson) has been revealed as a wheelchair bound Lex Luthor.

1296151,2,B00003CXQA,"I have browsed briefly through the reviews of this film.  This will be a short review on the contrary of what 95% of the viewers have given the movie (four to five stars).
From what I gathered, the movie is about one hour and forty minutes of Bruce Willis' character realizing just what he is...a seemingly immortal, ""unbreakable"" human being.
Along the way, it's almost as if it's a search for an arch enemy.  When you watch this movie, you will understand, I guess.
The reason i give this film two stars is that nothing really happens in the film.  It's a really good idea that misses out with it's slow and methodical tempo.  I won't necessarily say it's ""unwatchable,"" but I was disappointed with the anticipation I had for this movie.  Boredom and bedtime is really what pops through the mind once you reach the first hours end.
Aside from the general idea of the movie, the only good thing I can say about it is that it looks pretty ... good.
I realize I am in the minority in this review...but there are two sides to every story.  Don't buy this DVD if you've never seen the movie before...rent it first.",993859200,,1111,4.448275862068965

I think the reason people did not like this film because everyone expected another Sixth Sense, and it's not. The movie gives you an insight on how a real life hero comes to grasps with his powers and his purpose in life. Unbreakable's hero struggles with his true identity much like Superman, Wolverine, or Hulk must have struggled when they first discovered their purpose in their comic book world's. People believe more in ghosts, than comic book heros. If this film would have been presented as a tribute to comic books, maybe people would have enjoyed it more!",993859200,,654,4.79646017699115

I also enjoyed seeing the deleted scenes, and the little documentaries on the subject matter that makes up ""Unbreakable"".  I have to confess I didn't see this film when it was in theatres, and for the most part, people I talked to who did see it were pretty divided. One of the things that impressed me about ""Unbreakable"" was that it didn't stay in a conventional genre.  It's not really a drama, a thriller, or even a comic-book type film.  The performances are solid and the ending (while being somewhat abrupt, and being a major punching bag in the negative reviews of this film) works just fine.

But for those of us that are patient and give the film a chance to play-out, we can enjoy what the writer/director has created for us.  There is so much imagery that makes his point...the raincoat with cape, the brilliant colors worn by the ""villains"", the use of a kryptonite-like weakness...even the name of the main character (David Dunn) ...",993772800,2,614,4.504504504504505

The premise is wonderful, Bruce Willis plays the only survivor of a train crash and Samuel L. Jackson plays a fragile comic book collector who believes that not only do superheroes exist but that Willis is one of them. Cool huh? Alas, the story moves so slowly that by the time you get to the ""surprise"" ending, (you'll see it coming, trust me) you feel totally cheated! Way too much prologue and not nearly enough payoff.

1296156,5,B00003CXQA,"Unbreakable gives us another strong performance from Bruce Willis.  Although almost no critics have mentioned it, Bruce Willis is actually a tremendous actor.  You have only to watch Terry Gilliam's 12 Monkeys for further proof of that.  He has cultivated that sort of action star persona that has worked extremely well in the Die Hard movies, but Willis' talents far exceed that of his genre colleges such as Jean-Claude and Arnold.  Even the Die Hard movies should be clear indications of what a talent Willis actually is--Die Hard does not follow the conventions of an action movie at all (John McClean seems like more of an everyman than a superhero) yet the film is much more effective than most action films.  Similarly, Unbreakable plays with Willis' pseudo-hero, mostly regular guy, reputation.  In Unbreakable, Willis' plays an ex-football player who is the only survivor of a disasterous train wreck.  Samuel L. Jackson plays the slightly odd comic book collector who tries to convice Willis that he is in fact a superhero.  The film is different because of how down-to-earth willis is.  Rather than whoop for joy over his new potential powers, he seems awestruck and concerned over the implications this might have on his everyday life.  This film takes great efforts to examine the mind of, not only the idealized superheros we've all grown up admiring, but the connections to the real-life people who must have inspired these stories (think of the real life people who must have inspired Beowulf or even King Arthur).  One of the interesting ideas is that through the flattering exaguration, the human conflict of these inspiring people is totally lost.  The question then is, is their life experience rendered meaningless? Unbreakable is sure to keep you on your toes because it is so much different than any movie that has come before.  It doesn't try to hit you over the head with dazzling special effects or exagurated tales of human accomplishment, rather it goes at it from the human emotional side, a track that is often overlooked but equally powerful.  It may seem absurd to take comic book heros and examine their problems as though they were real people, but this movie walks the tightrope with a deft step and the results are wonderful.  Holding together the entire film is Willis' believeable performance witch is both powerful and heartbreaking.  Certainly if this isn't the movie that brings Willis his deserved acolades as an actor the next one he does certainly will.",993686400,2,2497,4.980722891566265

Then you can fully appreciate just how good Unbreakable is.  In this pop culture every super hero movie dazzles you with special effects and then kills you with a dumb story.  It's all show.  Not Unbreakable! This movie works on so many levels.  It's slow pace builds into monstrous climax.  When the main character realizes just who and what he is.  The subtelty of the story is what makes the movie so different.  It doesn't dazzle you with new technology.  Just a good ol' fashioned story telling.

Particularly wonderful is the performance of Spencer Treat Clark as the son who loves his father dearly.  This little boy has so much power in those soulful eyes.  You'll want to enjoy the movie if only for his performance.  The DVD version is very interesting with a separate disc for special features.  The deleted scenes are almost a movie in themselves.  There is SO MUCH material on this disc.  I heard the director's explanation of why the nude shower scene where Bruce Willis breaks down and cries when the impact of his miraculous survival hits him was deleted, but it is such good emotional film that it will have to be put back in a future ""director's cut"" of the movie.  The early M. Night Shyamalan home movie is a hoot and very dear.  I also found Elijah's mother played by Charlayne Woodard to give a wonderful thoughtful performance as the mother with the special son.  This is a good movie, one that will keep your attention.

If people had no idea who directed this, I doubt that anyone would accuse it of being a 5 star movie.  The packaging for Unbreakable is gorgeous.

The premise of someone being ""unbreakable"" is laid excellently - it is the way that this is drawn out into a conclusion that leaves you feeling that the movie has been stopped, as opposed to coming to a natural end.

Sure it's the same director and one of the same leads, but it's a completely different movie with a very different fell to it.  This is more or less a comic book movie handled very maturely. It is the origin story of a superhero with lots and lots of class.  It speaks of Dunn's (Willis) troubled home life with wife Robin Wright Penn and son, and how a man (Samuel L. Jackson) changes everything.  See, Dunn survives a train wreck in which every other passenger dies and Jackson, who has a rare disease known as Osteogenesis imperfecta which makes his bones very brittle, seeks him out, sensing that something sets Dunn apart. This is a very clever, well written thriller with one of Willis' best performances to date.  The pace of the movie is slow, methodical and deliberate, which might bore some audiences, but I found it to be incredible.  There is a twist at the end for those who were a fan the Sixth Sense, but this movie is more than an ending, it is a brilliantly crafted character story, handled with maturity and grace, a far step from any comic book movie ever released.  Two thumbs up for the movie. The DVD, in a two disc presentation, is pretty solid.  The anamorphic widescreen transfer is strong and the sound quality is great. The DVDs are also filled with special features, including a documentary with cast and crew, deleted scenes introduced by Shyamalan, and a documentary on comics and superheroes hosted by Jackson and a multi-angle feature on the ending of the movie. The lack of a commentary by the director or lead actors hurts the overall rating, but still, this DVD is a worthwhile purchase on the merits of the movie alone, the features are just a great bonus.",993686400,,1861,4.615151515151515
1296220,5,B00003CXQA,"There are few filmakers who have such a compelling style that the style is defined in their films: Among them, Kubrik, Spielberg, Lucas; and on a more recent scale, Quentin Tarantino, Spike Lee, and Kevin Smith.  What has made those directors so remarkable is their instantly recognizable style.  In the Sixth Sense, M. Night Shyamalan defined his style with an intriguing suspensful story filled with twists and clues that lead to an unexpected conclusion.  Shyamalan also makes films that don't adhere to the laws of the world; that is, in Sixth Sense, the plot revolves around the supernatural.
Shyamalan clearly shows his unique styling in this followup to Sixth Sense, which is a superhero comic book story thinly disguised as a suspense thriller.  However, it is laced with Shyamalan's filmaking leads to a story of heroes and villans.  Bringing superheroes to the screen has always proved a mistake in the past.  It's glammed up to sell cartoons and toys, as Jackson's character says in the film.
Shyamalan asserts that comic books are part of our society - part of our history.  Here, Shyamalan brilliantly develops a sort of theme.  There is a point in the film where Willis's character says ""I'm just an ordinary man.""  Straying from the romantic ideas of costumes and overt superpowers like flying and such, Shyamalan tries to show that heroes come in all shapes and sizes and usually don't even know it.
The undeniable brilliance in this film, however, lies in the filmaking.  Like Sixth Sense, this film is full of clues and symbols.  Shyamalan uses color and objects to lay the groundwork for the ultimate end to the movie.  Somethings are very overt, like bright colors representing key characters in the film.  Shyamalan is tipping his hat to the key inspiration to this film: comic books.
The rest of the cast and crew puts this film together as well.  This film is hard to imagine without Bruce Willis in the main role, who delivers a similar humble approach to his unforgettable role in Sixth Sense.  Samuel L. Jackson is equally brilliant in his role as the mysterious character who introduces Willis to his gift.  The music also helps create a moody suspensful atmosphere required for such a film.
This film is also fun.  Shyamalin is creating a film which prior to Sixth Sense, probably wouldn't have been made.  Superhero movies are jokes unless they have high profile actors, big names and special effects to sell (like X-Men for example).  Shyamalin is making the movies that a director should make: the stuff he/she loves and thinks is fun.  The idea of superheroes is ever compelling and rarely done well in cinema.  Shyamalin does it and does it well.",993600000,2,2679,4.8697571743929355
1296221,5,B00003CXQA,"This movie is everything I wanted comics to be when I was a comic geek (not that I ever really stopped being a comic geek at heart - there is no going back).  2000 was the year when not just one but two great comic book movies were made: Unbreakable and the X-Men.  What seperated these movies from the consistently horrible comic book movie before them, was their respect for what the medium has been able to accomplish.  Suddenly, those who had grown up on Frank Miller's Daredevil, the matured X-Men, and The Watchmen are now making movies.
This DVD is a revelation.  Ironically, my respect for Night has increased exponentially after seeing his deleted scenes.  The scene between Bruce and Robin on their date is brilliantly written in its subtlety.  The scene with the young Sam Jackson is absolutely heart-wrenching (especially if you have kids).  The documentary about comics is great with Frank Miller in all his ragged glory.

I thought the suspense more than made up for the lack of murder and mayhem. For me movies that depend heavily on a child actor succeed or fail largely on that basis for nothing is worse than suffering through a child's poor performance. Here Spencer Treat Clark who plays Willis' son does a magnificient job and adds signficantly to the movie's success.
You really can't talk about the plot in Unbreakable without ruining the ending. The very fact that it can be given away may preclude its purchase because some people only need to see a coin disappear once. However the film is so finely constructed that I am pleased that it is now a part of my DVD collection.
Unbreakable while sharing many attributes of Sixth Sense is not the same movie and from my perspective that makes it a fine and worthwhile movie to watch and own.",993600000,,1196,4.64622641509434
1296268,3,B00003CXQA,"I'd like to just put in one review that breaks the trend of the one star/five star pattern here.  The movie isn't groundbreaking or immensely incredible, but it is not garbage either.  The ending was not especially surprising (like the 6th Sense, it might have been surprising if I hadn't known there was going to be a surprise).  The ending was fitting though.  I think the true quality of this film (either good or bad) will be evident if the rumored sequels are made.  Standing alone, the story is incomplete and leaves a lot to be desired.  But if annoying Hollywood slop like Gladiator is best picture, this film didn't get the credit it deserved.",993513600,9,652,4.626086956521739
1296269,5,B00003CXQA,"I bought this movie the day it came out on DVD, and I enjoyed it tremendously. Bruce Willis does his best acting work yet, as an emotionally beaten down guy trying to come to terms with the fact that he may be a superhero. Spencer Treat Clark is touching, as a son who idolizes and believes in his father.  The cinematography is dark and crisp, the story compelling and involving, and the movie has a great surprise ending.  Be warned, you'll have to think about this movie as you watch it, or else it won't make any sense at the end.

1296271,4,B00003CXQA,"Are you unbreakable?  This is the question prompted by the ads for M. Night Shyamalan's latest film, Unbreakable.  The film follows meek security guard David Dunn, played by Bruce Willis.  His family consists of a wife that is going through a seemingly mid-life crisis and a son that idolizes his every move.  David Dunn is not an ordinary man though, he is the only survivor in a horrible train wreck that kills 132 passengers.  Not only is David the sole survivor, but he is also completely unharmed.  On the opposite side of the spectrum, we have Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson), a comic-book art dealer.  Elijah has a rare genetic bone disease that makes his bones very susceptible to breakage, thus giving him the childhood nick name of ""Mr. Glass.""  He believes that the world is essentially one big comic-book eco-system.  For all those who are frail and defenseless, there are just as many of those who are essentially the hero of a comic book: strong, invincible and superhuman
in their abilities.  Elijah is obsessed with his disorder and trying to understand why people like him are on this planet.  He believes that since he exists as a very frail and fragile man, that there must be someone on the other end of the curve, a polar opposite.  When Elijah learns of David's survival, he begins the first of many contacts with David by leaving a card on his windshield asking, ""How many days of your life have you been sick?"" with the obvious answer being none.  As the movie advances, we as well as David learn more of Elijah's  seemingly unbelievable theory on life and the balance that must lie within.  Elijah feels that he and David, ""seem to be linked by a curve, but sitting on opposite ends"".  That is all that can be said of this film's story without giving too much away.  There is, however, plenty to be said of M. Night Shyamalan.  In his sophomore thriller/suspense story, he fine tunes his craft with more confidence than was displayed in The Sixth Sense.
In Sense, the important symbolism was certainly a lot less subtle than it is here, not without good reason, true, but it was almost as if Shyamalan felt he was the kid in class who had to explain all of his jokes for them to be funny.  Perhaps he wasn't confident enough as to whether or not his audience would understand everything he wanted to get across in the movie.  But as history tells it, his audiences did get it and now he has us wrapped around his finger.  The film moves with an eery, silent calm that truly plays off of David's understandably unsettling emotions.  This truly is Shyamalan's show and he does an excellent job of tricking the audience and their emotions, much like he did with Sense.  I like to compare Shyamalan to a really good magician; in one hand he holds a dove and in the other a quarter.  Show us the quarter, wave it in front of us, move one hand over the other, add a flick of the wrist and `poof!', the quarter has turned into a dove.  This is where Shyamalan's gift lies.  He puts so much artistic meaning behind his choice of shots that we as an audience are truly oblivious to anything else in the movie other than what is on the screen at that exact moment.  I honestly cannot remember blinking during any of the 2 hour-plus film.  This is a film about the inevitability of fate and destiny; about the rights and wrongs we look past every day of our lives and about why we were put on this earth and to serve what purpose.  This film in it's purest form is essentially a wonderfully crafted slight-of-hand.",993513600,,3529,4.513385826771653

1296273,4,B00003CXQA,"One of my greatest TV moment memories wasn't a superbowl, breaking news or even memorable sit-com finale.  It was Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel nearly getting into a fist fight over the film ""Full Metal Jacket"".
Both thought the film was brilliant and lauded it with praise.  Siskel however thought that he should use a different scale to determine if he should give it a thumbs up or down.  The Kubrik scale.  Rather than base his rating on the merits of the film in and of itself, he decided to compare it to the director's other work.  Held up to ""Spartacus"" or ""2001"" the film didn't rate a thumbs up.  I believe a lot of the ratings here on Amazon are falling prey to this mentality.
Unbreakable is a wonderful ride.  As a begining to a possible trilogy of films it is a magnificent introduction to the principal characters and gives great insight to their lives and beliefs.  As a stand alone film it tells it's story, makes it's point and builds to an ending that at least I didn't see coming.  It's not a huge revelation on par with ""Sixth Sense"", but this is a different film, isn't it?
The pacing is slow, true.  But this is intentional on the part of the director.  Unbreakable is about the possibility of superheroes existing in the real world.  Here in the real world people don't wear purple spandex suits and probably wouldn't have millions of dollars at their disposal to buy jets and pnuematicly firing grappling hooks that fold into a packet on their belt.  Most people here in the real world take what they do have and make the best of it and try to do good.
Shyamalan uses color well as a symbol here as is becoming his trademark.  He also seems to enjoy filling most of his frames with lots of background action, choosing to shoot a lot at train stations and sporting events.  This lends a lot of power to a simple two shot when he uses one.  Especially when Willis and Jackson share the screen.
I guess it boils down to this.  If you watch this film with no previous knowledge of Shyamalan's previous work you will undoubtedly enjoy the film, especially if you are a comic geek who goes in for Frank Miller.  On the other hand, if you are expecting Sixth sense part two don't bother.  Wait until you can see this movie and evaluate it on it's own strengths.",993513600,3,2277,4.430288461538462

When I saw it in the movie theater, I got a quick look around at the faces of other people, and I saw some pretty bored, angry faces. But I loved it. My friends loved it. I think that the much-debated slow pace is essential in developing the tension, climax, and resolution. The plot and the angle in which the director took to develop it is genius. I found this movie to be thought-provoking and facinating. If M. Night Shyamalan goes to a more pop-culture style, I believe this movie loses all of its effectiveness. If you want to me to classify ""Unbreakable"", I really can't. This is not a horror movie, this is not an action movie, this is not a psychological thriller. This is simply a great movie.

Most likely because I am a comic book fan. This is not to say that I enjoy all ""comic-book"" movies. As a matter of fact, I cringe when they come out because they are all too often done poorly. The general public wants to be entertained by comic book movies... Comic book fans are more concerned with intergrity. Anyone who's read ""The Watchmen"" would probably understand. We appreciate it when the story isn't outweighed by the special effects. Slow? Yes, but then a lot of my favorite movies move at a snails pace (""Round Midnight). In the end, I don't need to be entertained as much as I need to make the connection with what the storyteller is saying. I wasn't looking for ""Sixth Sense""... as a matter of fact, I wasn't looking for anything so I was pleasantly surprised. If you go into it with an open mind, you may come away with something. Still, I see that this movie will rub some people the wrong way (my wife absolutely hated it.) I think the issue is whether or not you buy the superhero medium as a valid vehicle for telling a more contemplative story.  A lot of people don't. That's okay.

Elijah, obssessed with comic books, and their heroes, has spent his life looking for the one person the complete opposite of himself, someone who can not be broken, this he thinks he found in David.
As the two men begin their strange relationship, David himself begins to question, if he in fact is indestructable, and the further things spin of control, he realizes Elijah's obssession may change his life forever.
'Unbreakable' is a major disappointment for a follow up to 'The Sixth Sense', and while there are some nice plot twists, several creepy parts; one of which involving a killer, and the family he holds captive, and a surprise ending, it just doesn't work, it is too slowly paced, and the whole comic book angle makes the film somewhat silly.

M. Night shows his directors prowess once again in ""Unbreakable"" but the movie stumbles, largely because of its hokey and predictable ending and this air of self-importance it gives off.  The movie is beautifully photographed but it's too dark for its own good. The only relationship we're supposed to care about is the one between Willis and Jackson.  It lacks the emotional complexity of of ""Sixth Sense"".  The Willis/Jackson repore doesn't quite gel (unlike their dynamic duo performance in Diehard with a Vengeance) and with little to hang on as viewers, much of the movie becomes filler until the surprise ending.

1296339,5,B00003CXQA,"Anymore when I view a movie I do not look for entertainment value alone. In fact with serious movies, I really do not look to be entertained. I view the movie as one would an art form. I am convinced that the better films have been (for many years) a new modern day  form of artwork.
This film is a fantastic work of art with meaning deeply hidden under the guise of plot or story line. We all derive our own meanings from what we see and hear, from what we experience. Mine is as follows regarding this movie:
I have a different twist on the meaning(s) of and within the film in general. The feeling I received after viewing this film was a deep sense of loss. Loss as in 'Do I know My Purpose?' Our villain brought something to light. Our villain did something our hero did not. Our villain helped someone discover their greatness. Do you suppose that our 'Darkness' or the forces thereof, is that which leads us to the light? I have a feeling that our director/writer was aware of this truth of life. The movie clearly depicts the sheer amount of trauma it takes for us to realize our purpose. Who is the hero in this film? The real hero? Who knew their purpose all along? Who was the redeemer? Who the resurrector? Our hero did not know what our villain knew. Where would our hero be without our villain - and by that I do not mean the crimes committed - but the loss of crimes prevented due to our hero's cluelessness.
The movie begs us to ask the question, are we also - clueless? I think this is a great question to ask ourselves in regards to the meanings in life that we overlook. Questions like this are ultimate goals of all pure art of this nature. Film is teaching us many things. Like literature film can be a great educational tool. I find this motion picture to be especially educational and rewarding.",993081600,10,1818,4.331378299120234

1296341,4,B00003CXQA,"I just want to start off by saying that comparing Unbreakable to the Sixth Sense is like comparing Schindler's List to Jurassic Park. Same directors, whole different movies. One is low-key, the other is mainstream. I don't know why this is so difficult for people to understand!
The storyline behind Unbreakable is deep and involved, particularly if you have an interest in mythology and/or comic books. This is not a 'Hollywood' action movie. Instead, Unbreakable brings you something fresh and innovative. There are plenty of movies out there with flashy special effects and sappy, overdone love themes. Unbreakable breaks free from those molds. Here, a train crash is every bit as frightening as the plane crash in Cast Away, yet Without Any Special Effects! The characters are well defined and you will find yourself caught in their viewpoints several times throughout the movie.
I felt that the Hitchcock style used in Unbreakable was somewhat similar to the Sixth Sense but used much more effectively here. Hitchcock had said (in short): if a bomb suddenly goes off in a restaurant, the audience is shocked momentarily. If the audience knows there is a bomb under the table, and it's ticking down while someone is eating, the building suspense is overwhelming (and downright terrifying.) Mr. Glass really drives this philosophy home.
Yes, the pace is laid-back. But it's certainly not boring. My only gripe is that the ending feels rushed. If this is part of a trilogy, as anticipated, it is a great starting point. Unbreakable is one of the best original movies I have seen in a long time and I look forward to the section chapter.

1296377,5,B00003CXQA,"when you were a kid, did you ever pretend you had super powers?  or did you wish you had super powers?  if so, this movie is definitely for you.
the story is of a modern man (the bruce willis character) who, unbeknownst to him, has ""super powers.""  it takes the a train wreck and the persistance of a fanatical comic book collector (samual l. jackson's character) to bring him to grips with his uncanny powers.
what's so impressive about this movie is how we are made to understand the mental dilemmas of the main character, we feel him learning to accept that his powers are real, and just becasue he has them doesn't mean he has to be an unfalliable ""superhero"".  the story is far from ""campy,"" which is usually the case with this genre of movie.  and, as usual, m. night shyamalan (writer of 6th sense) is once again able to throw his trademarked ""curveball"" at the end of the movie.
however, don't assume that because you loved 6th sense, you'll love this movie... this movie got only moderate reviews at best, for one good reason: it wasn't targeted to a large audience like 6th sense.  in the 6th sense, we had a kid as a main character, whom we all fell in love with, the relationship with his mother, and the dying relationship (pun intended) between the child psychologist and his wife, and the friendship between the kid and the psychologist.  this appealed to a large audience, and especially helped to attract a female following.  unbreakable has none of that.  there is a kid -- the lead character's son -- but there's little character development. there's also no strong female character in this movie. no, this movie targets a different audience all together:  basically, a male audience who may or may not have read comic books as kids, or always wished that they were superheros like batman or superman.
overall, i personally loved this movie.  but then, i'm part of the targeted audience (i used to pretend i was half-robot, half-human with super strength).  i do indeed recommend this movie.",992390400,32,2010,4.6789772727272725

1296379,4,B00003CXQA,"These days any film associated with comics is likely to be a special effects extravaganza full of action and short on character development. Well director M. Night Shyamalan has taken us in a different direction, (no surprise there). His film, ""Unbreakable"", explores the action comic philosophy without becoming an action comic itself. You won't see  men in spandex leaping from tall buildings to save the day. What you will see is a thoughtful investigation of the unusual skills we humans may or may not have, and the choices we make regarding their use.
I have a talent for putting holes in T-shirts. My sister can permanently stop any watch she wears for a few weeks. It's hard to see either of us becoming crime fighters or maniacal masterminds on the strength of these talents but it does makes you think. Let's stretch our imaginations a little further. What if a man had the uncanny luck to avoid virtually all injury or illness? Could this be significant? Would he even notice? Where would it lead him?
Unbreakable introduces us to such a man. Bruce Willis plays David Dunn, the sole survivor of a tragic train derailment that killed the other 131 passengers. David walks away without a scratch and barely notices his fifteen minutes of fame on the local news channels. But at least one other person takes note of David's uncanny good fortune. Elijah Price is an art dealer, played convincingly by Samuel L Jackson. His gallery specializes in comic art and he is very passionate about the seriousness of his chosen profession and it's medium.
Elijah believes that action comics represent an ancient wisdom, exaggerated and commercialized but still containing an essence of truth. His theory is that there are  people with extraordinary abilities and that these people have a destiny. Whether these people become legendary hero's or any other larger than life figure depends on them realizing their destiny and fulfilling their potential. In David Dunn, he suspects lies the heart of a hero and Elijah's obsession soon drags David and his family into a new world.
Shyamalan takes his time with this story. It could have very easily been boring, because when boiled down, little actually happens. However, Unbreakable avoids that trap and becomes instead, a strange mixture of longing, suspense and doubt. We truly get to know David's wife Audrey and his son Joseph. They are not an atypical family; marital problems, boredom and some other dysfunctions feature at the start of the story. In a way, David's gradually more serious attempts to explore his ""gift"" become the catalyst to improve his home life.
The sub-plot of David's crumbling relationship with Audrey, (Robin Wright), is not fully explored but we are given several clues that make it interesting. David is chasing job offers in another city, even after the accident little emotion passes between he and Audrey, and they sleep separately. All of which points to a lack of love. But to counter this we discover that David sacrificed a promising football career to capture Audrey's heart and, even in the hardest times, he has remained faithful to her. I like these quiet story lines, where nothing is forced down your throat and you have to work it out on your own.
By far the most interesting character is Elijah. Born with a brittle bone disease, his life  has been crowded with pain, torment and ostracism. At school he was taunted with the moniker, ""Mr. Glass"", and to an extent he has embraced this title. If you look closely, you will see that he is always close to glass, for example, his fragile glass walking stick. Elijah is a fighter. His mother headed off a life of seclusion when he was a depressed boy and convinced him to accept life's challenges, eventually leading to his becoming a professional success. Elijah's passion and conviction are magnetic. He not only draws David and his son into the world of duty/destiny but the audience is forced to believe, long before David starts to.
Unbreakable is a subtle film about taking risks, acknowledging hope and following dreams. Whether we have special gifts or not, it challenges us to take a look around and try to find opportunities to make a difference; to stand up to the small and large evils in this world and do our part. I can only hope we see more of these inspiring characters in future films. I want to feel this way again.",992304000,134,4370,4.839572192513369

Unbreakable is the movie adaptation of a comic book origin issue.  From Bruce Willis' growing awareness of his own abilities, to his son's wide-eyed wonder at the transformation of his father, to Samuel L. Jackson's character, who is obsessed with comic books, this movie is the perfect distillation of a superhero's beginnings.
My favorite scene is in the train station; here M. Night combines visuals and score perfectly--you feel yourself with Willis' character, you experience what he experiences.

1296438,4,B00003CXQA,"If you liked Sixth Sense you'll like Unbreakable.  Willis again puts in a strong performance as his character is slowly developed throughout the film.  I do put emphasis on SLOWLY because the director takes his time building up the plot to its climax.  Some people may find the buildup a little slow but if you have patience and enjoy looking at the little details of the movie, you'll find yourself being drawn in.  And like Sixth Sense, Unbreakable has that plot twist which will catch you off guard even though you'll probably end up thinking ""I should have seen that coming.""
I liked Unbreakable because it wasn't just another action movie with car crashes and shoot outs.

1296443,2,B00003CXQA,"Let me give you the gist of a movie:
  1) The movie begins quietly enough, but then a sudden, jarring incident occurs, altering the protagonist's (Bruce Willis) life.  2) Things at home for the protagnist, mainly concerning his wife, are estranged, and he feels distant toward her.
  3) Someone needs his help, they are a weak person (perhaps afraid?), and look to him for help, comfort even.
  4) The person looking for help tries to convince the protagonist that he *is* special, that only he can save the day, etc.
  5) Meanwhile, the protagonist wonders what he can do to fix things at home  6) A character is slow to come to terms with the fact that he *does* have special powers, and then he finally uses them for good in a riveting scene which helps someone out  7) In the end, everything is set right at home, and the protagonist (Willis) can feel good about things.
  Now, I know most you are saying to yourself: ""He just reviewed the 'Sixth Sense', he's made some mistake!""  Alas, only if that were true. You see, both the 'Sixth Sense' and 'Unbreakable' follow the exact same plot-line (pretty much). Both films are directed by M. Night Shyamalan, but here, with 'Unbreakable', he's lost his deft touch present in the previous film.
  The main problems I had with 'Unbreakable':
  1) too similar, thematically, to the 'Sixth Sense', as stated above. And *this* film didn't make the plot nearly as interesting.
  2) the directing was way overdone. Shyamalan is on record as being very immodest about the success he had with 'Sixth Sense', and so I guess he felt it necessary to incorporate Alfred Hitchock style camera angles in his latest venture - perhaps to prove something? But what? Some of the shots border on nauseating, and some are just so completely odd (and OBVIOUSLY staged) that they *take away* from the film.
  3) the tone is too somber. I am NOT saying that I do not enjoy serious pieces of cinema, quite the contrary. What I *am* saying is that they have to be done well. 'Unbreakable's cinematography, acting, and total ambience is one of bleak gloom. Is is really too stark an image.
  4) due to the writing, and the things listed in point 3, the characters come across as stiff and uninteresting, and the plot seems a tad odd. Never once was I actually *drawn into* the story, instead I merely sat as a passive observer.
  So, in closing, let me just say that I *do* enjoy different, slower-paced films, but they have to be handled very well. I did not feel as though 'Unbreakable' was. And, next time, Mr. Shyamalan needs to think of a different set of plots and themes than what he has already used before.
  That might make the movie so much more refreshing.",991180800,2,2691,4.584905660377358

I liked this, but more than that I loved the story, which is about self-realization. It was something I could relate to my own life and experience. The director picked a risky subject for a big-budget film. I also like the way he depicts husbands and wives; the relationship between David (Willis) and Audrey (Wright Penn) is beautiful. I could feel their awkwardness, their sorrows, their hopes. The director is very special in that he has the ability to create a plot so grand that it bears hard on the imagination, yet he keeps his characters subtle and ordinary. This is a good balance. The result is drama, not melodrama. Due to its pacing (compare a vinyl record to a compact disc), lack of special effects, and melancholy tone (without horror or gore as a ""reason""), this film will not appeal to a lot of people.

The cartoons, the comic books, the 80s TV shows that appear on shirts and toys now...the things that are coming back in this sentimental attempt by those kids to reach back into their childhood.

1296482,4,B00003CXQA,"...so why are so many people basing their reviews on comparisons to Shyamalan's previous blockbuster movie?  Truly, Unbreakable is a movie of its' own and such reviews by those who did not like it because it wasn't The Sixth Sense have let their conclusions be unfairly biased.
First, if you are expecting Unbreakable to be the same type of movie as The Sixth Sense you will be disappointed.  Does this mean Shyamalan's second release is a failure?  No way!  The story is superbly executed and the characters are believable and interesting.  While many have put down the shock ending I believe it works very well in the context of the movie.  The movie itself has much to offer the viewer and I am looking forward to the DVD with all its bells and whistles.
However, this movie is not going to please everyone and for a few good reasons.  First, the themes of this movie are closely tied into the genre that is comic books.  The story so engrossed in the world of comics that it will turn some people off.  It is not a passing theme that is played at in the movie, this film heavily relies on the comic genre to tell its' story. Some people will just not enjoy this.  Also, if the movie suffers from anything, it is a bit slowly paced.  This in fact did not bother me because I was so engrossed in the character development but I could easily see where the pacing and lack of action could irritate some viewers.  The story and the ending more than make up for this flaw.
Overall, Unbreakable is an enjoyable experience.  Again, it isn't for all.  But if you are one of those people who are condemning it because it's not the Sixth Sense, then you are not giving it a fair chance.  The Sixth Sense is not the be all and the end all measuring stick for this or any other movie for that matter.

His script is ingenious in that it brings a superhero concept down to earth and exposes it in everyday life.  One note about the ending: many people said it was a huge letdown.  Let me assure you, however, that those people would be the same to complain that the movie was overlong if Shayamalan expanded on it.  Personally, I thought the movie's abrupt ending was like a catalyst that suddenly boosted my brain and made me think about what I had been seeing.  It made me leave the movie theater thinking about what i just saw, which i like very much.  This is yet another masterpiece from master filmmaker M.

1296527,2,B00003CXQA,"I don't know what special features are being offered with this DVD, but unless it's an entirely different movie, it's not worth the trouble. M. Night Shymalan makes a customary Hollywood move here, and follows the nearly unanimously acclaimed blockbuster with the totally wrongheaded commercial and artistic misfire.
Bruce Willis is a stadium security guard who, after surviving a devastating rail crash with no injuries, realizes that he is, as they say in the comics, invulnerable. Samuel L. Jackson is his opposite number, a comic art devotee who suffers from a rare, debilitating brittle-bone syndrome. Jackson's character tracks Willis around Philadelphia, trying to convince Willis that he should use his ""powers"" for good.
But Bruce, along with not believing he is in any way special, has problems of his own. He's estranged from his wife, the always serious, always underutilized Robin Wright Penn. He's trying to maintain a relationship with his son, who, of course, buys into the whole superhero thing. But finally, Willis aceepts his destiny to become the psychic, super-strong, impervious, rain-slickered guardian of Philly.
This movie could have been good. At least better. But Shymalan forces the actors to take his outlandish storyline completely seriously, and imposes a slow, hushed feel on the film that reveals his unchecked pretensions more than anything relevent to the film. For a movie about a novice superhero, there are NO convincing action scenes. But I don't know. Maybe that's due to Shymalan's intent more than his ineptitude. And, after ""the Sixth Sense,"" he has gone to the final reel ""surprise!"" well once too often. The ""shock ending"" here (don't worry, I won't spoil it) is neither shocking, nor an ending. It's just head-smackingly hokey.
Comic book fans, myself included, have critcized Hollywood for years for ruining promising superhero movie prospects with a trivial, campy approach. But if Night's pretentious, funerally paced film is the alternative, I may need to rethink my opinion of, say, ""Batman & Robin."" Then again, maybe not.",989107200,9,2074,5.287878787878788

Shyamalan takes this beyond modern day movie making to create a truly wonderful film with an original story.  If you don't like superbly told stories that move at a slow pace, then stay away from this film.  But, if you want to see a magnificent film with an intelligently and artfully told story, then see Unbreakable.  It should be the first great film of the trilogy.",988934400,3,694,4.409448818897638

They just knew it was from ""that guy who made Sixth Sense"". That alone would account for much of the disappointment with it.
But, for those of us that are taken with the mythology of the comic book hero, there is a lot in here. This movie deals with the questions of how a hero is made. And if evil deeds produce that hero, does that mean that the tragedies that reveal him were actually worth the suffering? I'd never seen a movie deal with this before and I was enthralled through the whole thing.
It DOES suffer from a pacing issue and the ending is a little...rushed, but it's still a highly original and entertaining film. Kudos to all those involved.",988848000,3,832,4.272151898734177
1296530,5,B00003CXQA,"You wake up in a rather murky setting. The stretcher beneath you creaks under your weight as you raise yourself into a sitting position. The curtains around you are mostly closed, leaving an opening the size of a small door. On the other side, you see a man lying on a hospital bed, completely wrapped in bandages, and there is a growing spot of red that tells you the man is hemorrhaging. He is about to die. Everything is kind of fuzzy, but you know that you and the dying man were both victims of the same train wreck, but while he is wrapped up like a mummy and quickly approaching death, you look at yourself, and there isn't a scratch on you.
The idea of something like this happening prompts a series of thoughts to streak through your mind, and each of these thoughts is captured in director M. Night Shyamalan's follow up to his masterful ""The Sixth Sense"": ""Unbreakable."" And I think I have to answer one question before I really dig into the guts of this review: No, this one isn't as good as ""The Sixth Sense,"" but it's still ridiculously good.
""Unbreakable"" examines a world of possibilities that is very similar to comic books. If someone like Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson) exists in the world with the horrific disease of Osteogenesis Imperfecta (a genetic disorder that makes bones very easy to break), then the logic of a comic book reading mind would deduce that there must be someone at the opposite end of the spectrum. Someone whose bones are unbreakable. Someone who doesn't get sick. Someone whose destiny is to utilize his or her powers to protect the rest of us.
Elijah (a biblical reference to one who would pave the way for a savior) Price believes that he has found his opposite when a train crash outside Philadelphia kills everyone on board except for one man, who escapes totally unharmed. That man is David Dunn (Bruce Willis, with the double-sounding hero name like Peter Parker or Clark Kent), an ex-college football star who now works as a security guard at the local football stadium. One day, after the train wreck, David finds a note held under the windshield wiper of his car, and in it is scrawled a question that starts the true meaning of the film coming into focus: ""How many days of your life have you ever been sick?"" David makes it his mission to find out, and he makes some incredible discoveries along the way.
M. Night Shyamalan does not disappoint his followers with this film. Sure, the film has its implausible moments, but that is more than forgivable, not just because of the believability of the Willis character, but because this film is, in essence, the first comic book movie that wasn't based on a comic book. The cinematography is outstanding, giving this movie the look and feel of those impossibilities that we love seeing in comics. Shyamalan shows he is quite an established shot-maker, the best I've seen since Spielberg and Sam Raimi, and he uses his music (composed by Maestro James Newton Howard) to accent every scene perfectly. And it wouldn't be an M. Night Shyamalan film without a surprise ending and some really clever sequences.
""Unbreakable"" is an uncommonly absorbing film that gripped me from beginning to end. The visual style is incredible, the characters are believable, and the acting is stellar. The ending, I thought, was rather tacked on, but nevertheless effective: It doesn't cheat. If I had to pick one movie star to be a superhero, it would be Bruce Willis. Why? Because he never fails to be cool in every single movie he does.",988675200,2,3519,4.67741935483871

Yes, this movie is different and quirky and unpredictable to a point... but that doesn't make it the best thing since sliced bread.  I understood this movie... just like I understood The Postman and Titanic (and other bottom of the barrel Hollywood trash).  But it's not good... because, if no other reason - its boring.  All of you prickly little critics who want to accuse me not having an attention span greater than four seconds, don't waste you sense of indignant outrage... just listen.  This movie starts with an off screen train crash which is followed by at least thirty minutes of a man in a waking coma trying to figure out how many days he's been sick.  Question:  If you (provided that you live in this world, where other people fall ill) had never been sick, wouldn't you know it?  You may ask your mother about your childhood illnesses, but you certainly wouldn't go to your boss and wife to find out how often you'd taken ill in recent years.  As an intelligent audience member, I felt like someone was literally battering me over the head with a bat.  I figured after about three minutes he hadn't been sick... why did Shayamalan have to tour us through the bloody details.  But yet I sat, wanting desperately to be entertained... yes, entertained - there are films that propose deeper levels of discourse and ask for a little patience in exploring them (something like Pi or Gattaca or Mother Night comes to mind to name a few 90's films) but this isn't one of them.  This is a simple tale - almost fable like akin to the Star Wars trilogy not The Seventh Seal or Shindler's List - it's got to entertain you.  Basically, this ended up being two hours of a dope discovering he has super powers where the average film goers would have known at least ten years before the movie began.  The reason I mention that the train crash is off screen is it sets up a comparison to another film of this year - Cast Away (also not incredibly deep).  Immediately before fifty minutes where one character will be on screen, we see a dramatic plane crash.  Why does Zemeckis show us all this?  The answer is simple... the audience needs to see what goes down because the character's ongoing state of mind is going to be the only source of dramatic tension.  Unbreakable asks us to care about its protagonist mind state and its voyage of discovery in the same way...yet we don't see what he's gone through.  Maybe if I saw the crash I'd understand why he seems so dopish and confused.  Maybe the trauma of the crash would sustain the audience through the next unbearable hour.  By the way I'm an avid comic fan and collector... trust me it doesn't help.",987897600,5,2775,4.521042084168337
1296605,4,B00003CXQA,"First off, pay attention to the rating for this movie -- most *definitely* do not allow anyone under 13 to see this movie. It has some *extremely* disturbing content, extremely. Now that said, I'll get on with my review.
This is another one of those movies you can't say a whole lot about or you'll ruin it for anyone who hasn't seen it yet. I can say however, the main character, played by Bruce Willis, is unbreakable, someone who lives through many disasters in his life without getting hurt. At the beginning of this movie he is in one of the greatest train disasters of all time where everyone else dies, yet he survives without getting so much as a scratch. It turns out he is also a little psychic as well -- you get that idea from the beginning of the movie but it's explored in more depth further into the movie -- those psychic skills lead him into some amazing adventures in this movie.
The other leading actor, Samuel L. Jackson, is a comic book collector who marvels in superhero qualities of the heroes in those comics. He contacts Bruce Willis on the basis of his surviving this disaster without a scratch. His character is the direct opposite of unbreakable -- beginning in childbirth his bones break during birth and his life is plagued by injuries in situations where others might not even get hurt.  He is the breakable one.  Samuel L. Jackson's character pushes Bruce Willis's character to accept his amazing abilities, both psychic and physical.  That's when all the adventure begins.  There are plot twists and turns that will keep you on the edge of your seat.  Though the ending was a little disappointing, the movie was enjoyable as a whole.  Rent this one though, don't buy it unless you've seen it and you love it. I saw it in the theater, and once was enough for me.",987897600,,1794,4.555900621118012

But ultimately it comes down to good and evil...you just don't know it until you get to the end. And then all of a sudden....POP, you feel like you've just been violated. Like your personal bubble has burst and that you just let someone get in and shock you.  I felt like I'd been... when I left the theatre. I felt like I left my gaurd down and that someone just got through to me in a way I didn't expect. This is what Shyamalan does with Unbreakable. True genius just like The 6th Sense. A must see movie!",987811200,2,808,4.281045751633987
1296607,4,B00003CXQA,"I feel that Shyamalan, a big comic book fan himself created this movie simply for all us other comic book fans.  Anyone else probably will not enjoy this film much at all. The whole story itself seems like it came from a comic book.  But to mention nearly any key plot points from the film would most likely spoil it for everyone who hasn't seen it already. To call this film a super-hero movie may even give too much away.  What I can say is that Shyamalan's style is simply amazing, the film direction was genius and he seemed to give the film more atmosphere than most other films these days.  One of my favorite scenes is when Bruce Willis visits the shopping mall and discovers his secret for the first time. You do have to have patience with this film, but I seem to have had to do that with the Sixth Sense as well. I understand a lot of people giving the film bad reviews because as I pointed out earlier, it's not for everyone.",987638400,2,936,4.271186440677966
1296608,5,B00003CXQA,"I'm not going to write a long review. The other reviewers on this page did a great job of describing this movie. I'm just going to talk about my opinion. This is the kind of movie that really makes you want to believe that there is some kind of good in all of us. It's about an ordinary man, just like you or me, who finds himself in a position to be a hero. To really help people. The thing is, this movie teaches you that you don't need superpowers to be a hero. All you need is courage. Courage and a true desire to help others. This movie reminds us that there are heros all around us. All we need to do is look. More importantly, this movie reminds us that each and every one of us can be a hero. All we need to do is care! I hope you do buy this movie. It's a great story about courage and humanity, and how anyone can make a difference!

1296609,4,B00003CXQA,"I saw this movie the very first day it debuted. I was excited since I thought that this was going to be another movie like The Sixth Sense but after the movie I realized I had been misled.
 Remembering the publicity for this film, it mostly consisted of promoting it as ""the next movie by the director of the Sixth Sense"".  Thus most expected a supernatural spooky thriller, but it is an entirely different thing.  This movie should have been promoted as a superhero movie, so that people should have expected all the comic book talk, and the good vs evil theme.
 In my opinion this was a great movie because of its twists and turns, the way it was presented, etc.  It is still a somewhat slow movie which would've have benefited of more action like more testing of Bruce Willis character's superpowers, and less talk about comic books and such.
 This is a movie that people will either love or hate, but it is all up to each one of us to judge it based on the content of the movie and not on the hype or silly talk in it.",987379200,,1022,4.269430051813472
1296610,4,B00003CXQA,"Bruce Willis plays a very normal person, who turns out to to be a true hero. The way he acts has always intriged me... but this must be his best til now. And of course Mr. Jackson plays his roles ever so eloquently. The movie intriged me from the first flash... in the train... I knew nothing of the movie before I went to see it... just that Jackson and Willis played in it together. I like to be surprised... I like to NOT listen or read to others' comment, but totally form my own opinion. And this movie is one of those that I am glad I did not know anything about. To me, the story is a very original one... a never seen before story (by me, that is). The hero/villain concept has been emphasized ever so nicely. Very good... a 5 star for my first review",987292800,,759,4.100671140939597
1296611,1,B00003CXQA,"For those who thought this movie had any inclination of brilliance, stop right there! I too went into this movie with a subtle hope that what I was about to watch was something brilliant and effective. I was dead wrong and so was the audience that shared this piece of rotted humus! Right from the beginning you are introduced to a mediocre character played by Bruce Willis who in my opinion plays one of the most bland and boring characters ever to require even a second of attention. You then learn he has discovered something superhuman about himself, he's survived a train crash with him being the sole survivor! Now, in real life, wouldn't that constitute a major investigation? I mean, c'mon, this movie just plays to morons! The rest of the film takes you through a series of melancholy self-discoveries of two characters that somehow balance each other based on their abilities to defy all odds of probability. One being superhuman in physicality (Bruce Willis) and one being superhuman in mastermindness (Sam Jackson). Both are equally powerful but this movie simply lacks EXCITEMENT! By the time you realize what is REALLY going, the story loses you. The ending graces you with a lame after-thought, showing commentary of both characters' success and demise. I was simply frustrated with all of this and I really think people need to understand what this movie is really trying to sell-HOLLYWOOD MANIPULATION AT IT'S FINEST. Steer clear of this one and stick with ""The Sixth Sense.""",987033600,16,1492,4.924603174603175
1296612,5,B00003CXQA,Unbreakable is the kind of movie that makes you think. Think about your own potential. Bruce Willis is wonderful as the reluctant hero who finds no way out of his destiny. M. Night Shyamalan proves that the 6th Sense was not a fluke. But don't watch it expecting it to be the same movie.,987033600,2,287,4.333333333333333
