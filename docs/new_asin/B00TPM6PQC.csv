7015308,5,B00TPM6PQC,"Much belated but finally available, Seasons 1-9 of the super-fantastic SUPERNATURAL series are here. Housed in a glossy, sturdy slide-off box set, featuring all 195 episodes, plus special features, all Seasons are 4-disc sets (except for Season 3 which, being the shortest, is spread over 3 discs), presented in regular-sized, clear blue amaray cases. Each Season contains all the episodes and special features from the separate blu-ray season releases (except for Easter eggs and some image galleries), and comes with an inside booklet listing credits and summaries. With Season 10 set for a September DVD/blu-ray release this box set is much delayed, but it is absolutely worth buying, especially if you are missing previous Seasons, or if you want to have them all together. This is a UK import, so the price is great, too (european price is 75 which is about $110), for a brand new item of such pristine quality in every aspect, especially when considering that buying all 9 Seasons separately would cost twice as much. Here are the contents analytically:

Note: The aspect ratio in all 9 Seasons is 1.78:1. Japanese audio is only available when player menu language is Japanese. The complete box set's total run time is 8,205 minutes.

Have loved it since the pilot and with this collection, I can re watch entire seasons or my favorite episodes as often as I like. The Winchester brothers are the best written and fully developed brothers on TV. As a whole, Seasons 4 & 5 remain my overall favorites, but there are many outstanding episodes in every season. Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles continue to deliver amazing performances as Sam & Dean Winchester. I know many fans have their favorite brother, Sam is mine. Seasons 10 & 11 have been great as well.",1442016000,,631,4.592920353982301
