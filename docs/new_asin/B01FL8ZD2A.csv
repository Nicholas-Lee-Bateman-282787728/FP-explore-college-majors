7750754,5,B01FL8ZD2A,"All in all, a fun show that will make you laugh.  Without offering spoilers, a tale that is in essence Shakespearean with villains, deceit, and unrequited love that revolves around contemporary resolution of a bet of sexual conquest which is untenable by design and intent.  Denton, the hero, is placed in inherently ridiculous situations that are presented with humility.  Empathy with his plight makes bizarre scenarios used to address the bet (see squirt gun) comedic.  Brandon, Dentons adversary, is a cad that would make George Sanders proud.  Also, it was a delight to recognize of number of wrestling greats in the cast.  Of note, the language and sexual content of the film would make a sailor on leave blush at times.  This is not for children, but a good escape for adults.",1470096000,3,783,4.886363636363637
7750755,5,B01FL8ZD2A,"Witty, hilarious with just the right amount of heart.",1469664000,2,53,5.0
7750756,5,B01FL8ZD2A,"This was a VERY funny movie. Nice to see a throwback to 80s/90s era raunchy comedies. Some killer cameos too. There's some laugh out loud one liner insults that are worth quoting. Deserved more attention. Maybe it will find a cult following. Stick around for the end credit theme songs too. ""I'm in Love With The Stripper With The Dolla in her Butt"" is a comedic masterpiece. Glad it's on Prime!",1504310400,,395,4.577464788732394
7750757,4,B01FL8ZD2A,"The one-liners in this movie is what makes it hysterical, along with the raunchy satire. Alex Klein and Amanda Clayton have such a fun chemistry and the wrestling legends aren't bad either! Its a creative underdog story, that demands a lot of laughs.",1504051200,,250,4.837209302325581
7750758,5,B01FL8ZD2A,It was pretty funny I just enjoyed all the classic wrestlers in it,1493683200,,66,4.153846153846154
7750759,1,B01FL8ZD2A,Silly and without much depth. Didn't finish it. Has some interesting situations but they are not well developed. Good way to kill some time.,1477180800,,140,4.875
7750760,4,B01FL8ZD2A,"The first thing The Bet made me think of was American Pie, its also similar to Van Wilder and Harold and Kumar. Ive noticed a Good To Go Tour poster on the wall and an Army Of Freshmen poster. Im pretty good at noticing things like that, I don't know if there are more references or not but those are the ones I noticed. This if my first time seeing Chris Jay act, he was good.

7750768,5,B01FL8ZD2A,"I had a great time with this movie. If you are looking for Citizen Kane or the next redefinition of comedy, move on. But if you just need two hours of raunchy jokes, hot chicks, and clever dialog all set in an American Pie/Van Wilder-esque universe, try it out.  I loved seeing some great wrestling heros and fookin Chuck D. It's cool to see Hollywood outsiders come out of nowhere and deliver a charming gross-out raunch-com with almost no budget. Looking forward to the next project  from Jay/Goldberg.",1472688000,,504,4.715909090909091
7750769,5,B01FL8ZD2A,You have to see the Bet! A laugh out loud comedy that is the perfect combination of raunchy with a good hearted love story at the center of it all. I highly recommend this film and definitely think the producers Chris Jay and Aaron Goldberg are guys to watch out for in the future to bring us more laughs! Already becoming a cult classic in my mind. 5 stars!,1472688000,,358,4.202898550724638

7750773,5,B01FL8ZD2A,"Do not miss this movie if you are a fan of movies like ""There's Something About Mary."" The cast of up-and-coming actors is superb mixed in with cameos from my favorite old school pro wrestlers. The story is a raunchy romp that fulfills it's premise with glee. Seth Rogen watch out for writers Chris Jay and Aaron Goldberg!",1472169600,,322,4.568965517241379
7750774,5,B01FL8ZD2A,Absolutely loved this movie!! Laugh out loud funny. You won't be disappointed. The story line is fun and hilariously raunchy.,1472083200,,125,5.3
7750775,5,B01FL8ZD2A,"Loved it! Soooo funny! Moves quickly and tells a cool edgy story. JAKE 'THE SNAKE' ROBERTS was awesome. Reminds me of my favorite throwback flicks such as ""Mallrats"" with a modern comedy feel. Totally worth a watch!",1472083200,,215,4.837837837837838
7750776,4,B01FL8ZD2A,"A friend of mine told me about this one, so I knew going in it was going to be raunchy, so I watched with an open mind.  I have to say, I thoroughly enjoyed watching The Bet. I laughed, I blushed, I rolled my eyes shaking my head (boys will be boys). I warn that it is not for the weak of heart or for hard-core politically correct tight asses.",1471824000,,344,3.914285714285714

7750779,5,B01FL8ZD2A,This movie definitely exceeded my expectations from the writing to the production. Some actual laugh out loud moments too which is rare for me to have watching a movie. Recommended for fans of old school Sandler and Farrell movies.,1471737600,,231,4.948717948717949
7750780,5,B01FL8ZD2A,"Denton Baker gets given a bet and has to hook up with every girl he had a crush on from 1st to 12th grade. The story follows Denton over the
summer to see him try & complete the bet.

I heard about this movie a couple of years ago through the writers of the movie Chris & Aaron. Being a huge wrestling fan & hearing that DDP,
Tommy Dreamer, Jake Roberts & Roddy Piper would be in a movie instantly caught my attention. There are also cameos from Chuck D & Dian Bachar (Squeek from Baseketball ) too.

5 stars, definitely worth a watch & definitely your time.

PS. Stick around until the end of the movie & catch a photo of Roddy
Piper with Aaron & Chris",1471651200,,653,4.0859375
7750781,5,B01FL8ZD2A,"I knew nothing about this film until I heard it mentioned on a podcast and figured it was going to be one of those terrible cheap low budget indies. Let's make it clear. This movie is NOT for everyone. It's beyond profane, totally offensive and has a completely unrealistic plot. It's also the funniest movie I've seen this year. There are actual laugh out loud moments with semen filled water pistols, train pornos, gourmet condoms and the foul mouthed Indian guy from 40 Yr. Old Virgin, so don't watch with the kids, but if you miss old school raunchy comedies like me thenThe Bet is the movie you've been waiting for.",1471046400,,620,4.594594594594595
7750782,5,B01FL8ZD2A,"If you've been searching for a comedy that will make you laugh outloud... Look no further. DIRTY jokes but smart jokes, great actors and characters, cameos from wrestlers, hilarious original songs. The rare raunchy comedy done right. Beware the squirt gun.",1470700800,,256,5.2682926829268295
7750783,5,B01FL8ZD2A,"As a fan of coming-of-age, underdog comedies the 5-6 year period following the American Pie release in the late 90s was a great time for me. This movie tips the hat to that era perfectly, but the beautiful cinematography (yeah, REALLY!) brings it into the modern day, along with the bet revolving around a relic from that era itself - the movie rental store.
The cameos are great as you'd expect from lifelong entertainers, however the main cast are all so good that putting an icon like Jake The Snake amongst them doesn't seem out of place. Everyone has great chemistry throughout, and perhaps the biggest surprise of all is that it's not all boobs and dick jokes like 90% of those that followed American Pie. It has real heart to it and the lead actors are so likeable that you find yourself rooting for their characters by the time the credits roll, despite participating in an ethically questionable bet.",1470700800,,909,4.6875
