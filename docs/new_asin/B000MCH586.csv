2728270,5,B000MCH586,"I have been working out for many years and tried various instructors. Gilad is by far my favorite due to his excellent instruction, cueing, tips and motivation. His personality is great and he is also in amazing shape which is motivating in itself.  His get fit quick system includes 3 cardio and 4 sculpting workouts which I use fairly regularly. The sculpting workouts are great and are the first sculpting workouts by which I have experienced significant results! Other sculpting workouts took me to the point where I began to feel the burn but Gilad's workouts  took me beyond that point which is why they are so effective. I find the abs workout to be particularly effective. I highly recommend this set of workouts.",1176595200,32,721,4.806451612903226
2728271,5,B000MCH586,"I got this directly from the old Gilad website...I saw an infomercial about it.  Very well done, if you follow the small books (easy to follow) and actually watch the DVDs, you will lose weight.  I reccomend it.",1171238400,10,211,4.526315789473684
2728272,5,B000MCH586,Gilad videos are exceptiobal!!!.My wife and myself have been doing these excersise for at least three years. Gilad makes it so easy and yet takes your heart rates up in cardio and tones all your body muscles during sculpting. It is great for any ages. Love it and Thank you Gilad and team for making it fun excersise.,1387756800,4,317,4.482758620689655
2728273,5,B000MCH586,"I have been a fan of Gilad for many years. A while ago I purchased this system from Gilad's website. I used it while watching my caloric intake and lost 27 lbs. I recently took it out and started using it again. I just started week 6 today and have already lost 13.2 lbs and shed several inches from all over my body. I did this in conjunction with watching my caloric intake. After doing these workouts I feel more energetic.

The workouts are appropriately challenging. It is a 12 week progressive program that you can adapt if you find necessary. The program is designed for you to work out 6 days then rest on the 7th. Every two weeks the program changes and becomes a bit more challenging. At the end of 12 weeks Gilad gives you a maintenance plan to follow. There are 3 cardio workouts which are a combination of classic cardio moves and kickboxing. There are 4 body sculpting exercises - Hips, thighs buns, chest and back, shoulders and arms, and abs. For the body sculpting exercises you will need a floor mat and hand weights in two different weights.

I highly recommend investing in this system if you are looking to shed some weight and getting in shape. Gilad is amazing and his workouts are incredible.",1386547200,3,1216,4.497737556561086
2728274,5,B000MCH586,"Easy, fun and full of energy.. Great workouts. The guide and exercise plans come in handy. I'm loving the fact the time spent on exercise is only 32 mins and is very convenient for me.",1380758400,2,184,4.285714285714286
2728275,5,B000MCH586,Great moves and a perfect way to tone and strengthen your upper and lower body gilad is an excellent coach,1378512000,2,106,4.35
2728276,3,B000MCH586,"I had been a huge Gilad fan back in the early 90's and mid 90's.  I had seen one of his shows on tv recently early in the morning and remembered how much I loved to do his workouts he had back in the 90's.  I ordered this set in hopes it was something like what I remembered.  It was not.  It started out the same and then during the aerobic segment, the cardio, it would start going into the punching and kicking.  I wasn't interested in that part of the aerobics.  I was disappointed to find out that all the dvd's for the cardio all ended up doing the same punching and kickboxing moves.  The only dvd I use of this series is the dvd that has the different toning segments; hips,butt,thighs,arms.
I now record his shows on the fit channel and do those aerobic segments.",1377734400,8,772,4.210884353741497
2728277,5,B000MCH586,"I had all of Jilads videos(which I gave to the thrift shop years ago ) when I was in my 30's and really enjoyed his work outs Now in my 50's I stumbled on this at the same local thrift shop. Never had a DVD of his,. Well worth the $2.00  Having had an injury that lasted several years and leaves me unable to walk the 3 miles/day I was used to, I am glad to now have Jilad back in my life again. Although 2001 his moves are timeless and less injurious than others.",1373846400,2,464,3.8842105263157896
2728278,5,B000MCH586,"This is a really great set of low impact workouts. Gilad, as always, is thorough and gentle. He is a great encourager and I never feel like I fail to live up to what I should do vs. what I can do. I certainly recommend all of Gilad's workouts. This one is great for it's low impact moves.",1367020800,,288,3.9827586206896552

2728281,5,B000MCH586,"I bought the Quick Fit System several years ago and used the body sculpting disc so much that it wore out and I had to order a replacement recently.  I am not currently using the cardio workouts because I am running a lot training for a marathon, but the cardio discs are good.  However, I love the sculpting disc!  The workouts are quick, none of the 4 is longer than 20 minutes, and effective.  The hips, buns and thighs workout will kick your tail.  This is a system that men can use and enjoy, as well as women.  It will not have you looking like a body builder, but it will get you toned and defined.  I highly recommend this system.  I am 48 years old and this system has me in the best condition I have been in since my 20's.  6 foot tall, 170 lbs., and size 32 waist.  Not to shabby for someone pushing 50.  Thanks Gilad!",1314316800,5,829,4.11875

2728285,5,B000MCH586,"This system is very good.  It is well rounded, and if you follow it, you will look like Gilad or that lady on the cover (if you want to, if not, use lighter weights).  The aerobics are slightly challenging, but easy to follow once you get a hang of the moves.  The first cardio is plain old aerobics ""old school style"", nothing crazy.  The next two cardio videos remind me of cardio kickbox, but still, the moves are easy to follow and get your heartrate up.  Gilad's toning workouts are great, too.  You workout your chest and back; shoulders and arms; hips and thighs; and abs.  I swear, I used every muscle in my body after going through the whole system.  Also, people in his videos are so pleasing to the eye.  The men, the women, all of them.  The guys are good looking, it made my workout go faster.  Men can get a very good workout with this system, too, it's not just for girls.",1243555200,3,887,4.283132530120482
2728286,4,B000MCH586,"If you're looking to get your picture on the cover of a muscle & fitness magazine, this is *not* the product for you.  However if you're like me and wanted a methodical system of losing extra pounds and putting some tone back into those muscles, I highly recommend the Quick Fit Workout DVDs.  By following the suggested schedule, you get get a thorough workout that will definitely help get you into shape.  It requires no more than an hour a day (less than that when you're first starting out), and it is easy to split that hour up into two sessions if needed.  Following the initial 12-week program, I lost 20 pounds and felt like I had taken a decade off of my age!

The only reason I did not give this program 5 stars is I felt the cardio workouts - particularly ""Cardio Classic"" - got a little monotonous for my tastes.  I still use them, but often substitute another cardio activity such as jogging or even some of Gilad's other DVDs in place of the QFW cardio routines (my favorite is the cardio portion of the ""45/45 Split Routine"" but be warned that it has a lot of high-impact aerobics).

One day off a week is provided for in the suggested schedule, but after the first six weeks on the program, I found my 45-year old body really feeling exhausted.  I decided from that point on I'll take every seventh week off as well.  That's not suggested in the program, but my body appreciates the extra rest and it helps keep me motivated for sticking with the system.

So if you find yourself out of shape, I highly recommend this product!",1242086400,19,1543,4.420494699646643
2728287,5,B000MCH586,"I used to workout to Gilad years ago, but hadn't truly worked out at all for many years.  I had put on a lot of weight over the last 15 years and was concerned about finding a workout that I could actually do!  Then I remembered Gilad... the 'Hawaii Guy'!  I ordered Gilad's Quick Fit System and I LOVE it!  At first I was 'all thumbs' since I hadn't done any aerobics for several years, but after just two of his cardio workouts the moves all came back to me.  Gilad's workouts are just that... WORKOUTS!  They're tough, but I always feel great when I'm finished.  The Cardio Strike workout is the hardest for me to follow as I had never done any type of kick boxing before.  I LOVE the Body Sculpting... every workout is short, but tough!  I feel it every time! The scultping exercises are easy to follow. Cardio Classic and Cardio Blast are very easy to follow and give you a good workout.  I am on Week 4 of this 12-Week program.  I could tell a difference in my muscle tone after the first week.  I am quite overweight, but find that I can actually DO Gilad's workouts and I can SEE and FEEL the difference in my body!  I will continue with the Quick Fit System through the 12 weeks... and then would like to expand my Gilad DVD collection to vary my workouts even more!  I highly recommend this DVD set from Gilad!",1236729600,6,1320,4.248995983935743
2728288,5,B000MCH586,"I've been doing this Quick Fit System for about 6 years now and I love it; it really does work as long as it's followed properly. That said, after having done this for said number of years, you get to notice stuff while working out and some things are quite distracting. I am referring to Brenda Dykgraff's hair in a couple of the toning tapes. Her hair resembles a huge bird's nest on the top of her head, and add to that, her over-dramatization of the moves. In the Chest and Back video, it is clear that she has eyes for Gil.  What lady wouldn't? The man is eye candy.  Other than Brenda's kissyuppy ways and goofy hair, this series is perfect, right on the money.  People have complimented my arms and I've noticed that my jeans look better on, everything basically fits better. The first time I attempted the Hips, Thighs and Buns tape, I was in such pain that I wanted to toss a pineapple at Gilad's head. But, no pain, no gain. I'm referring to the exercise, not the pineapple over the head;-) So, if anyone out there is wanting to try something new in the world of exercise and diet, this is a must. Gilad includes a booklet of his Eat Right Now plan which gives you a list of good foods, okay foods and foods to avoid. Get this; you will find it is so worth it.",1211328000,13,1270,4.239669421487603
2728289,5,B000MCH586,"We bought this one almost a year ago and my wife went from a size 16 to a size 8 (and expects to be in a size 6 by this summer.  I lost four inches from my waist.

Gilad keeps you motiviated not only during the program but after it.  His eating suggestions have different ""levels"" of foods (red, green, and yellow) with green being the best.  And we like to compete with each other to see who can stay the most green.

The aerobic workouts are well paced, and work, though some do get old.  The toning videos are the best.  The ""Hips, Thighs, and Buns"" video is still difficult after almost a year of doing it.

My only complaint is that he filmed them on a public beach (as is his style), but for a system video set that costs as much as this one, I would have expected him to find a more private location with fewer ""locals"" goofing off in the background.  That's a pretty weak complaint, I admit.

Overall, I would suggest this collection to everyone who wants to lose weight.",1201996800,20,979,4.21505376344086
