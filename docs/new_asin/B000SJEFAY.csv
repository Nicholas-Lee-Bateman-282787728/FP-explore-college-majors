8205453,5,B000SJEFAY,All the Little People videos are great - very good messages without trying to sell anything. Keep your DVD even after your kids apparently have outgrown it because you may find that they want to return to it for another viewing when they get older!,1404172800,2,248,4.533333333333333
8205454,5,B000SJEFAY,My granddaughter loves this video. She watches it over and over. Really glad there are options other than some of the other stuff you see.,1400544000,2,138,4.56
8205455,5,B000SJEFAY,My 2-year old niece loved this video!  She could barely take her eyes off of it once she opened the package!,1369612800,2,108,4.142857142857143
8205456,2,B000SJEFAY,"My kids absolutely love the Little People videos. But this one I hated. Just about every episode on this DVD promotes unhealthy eating: chocolate cake, donuts, cookies, cotton candy... So we're getting rid of it. Very disappointed. I do recommend Discovering Your Neighborhood though. It's my kids' favorite.",1337904000,2,308,5.4375
8205457,5,B000SJEFAY,"You can't go wrong with this one.  My kids would never admit that they still enjoy this when they should be ""too old"" to watch it...ssshhhh....don't tell their friends!  My kids watch this together (ages 1-9)!  Very cute programs with wonderful values.  Nothing scary, either!",1282003200,7,276,5.066666666666666
