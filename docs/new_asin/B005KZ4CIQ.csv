8477289,4,B005KZ4CIQ,"This dvd is a collection of goofy shorts from the 50s and 60s without the MST riffing. But don't worry, these shorts are still pretty silly by themselves. There's ""Design for Dreaming"", in which a young woman dances around GM cars at the motorama until she is wisked away by a masked stanger in a tuxedo. ""What About Juvenile Delinquency"" involves a young man who must choose between his gang and his father (that his gang beat up). ""Century 21 Calling"" has a pair of cutesy teens at the Seattle World's Fair where they learn about such futuristic phone delights as call waiting.""Once Upon A Honeymoon"" features a Charles Nelson Reilly clone playing an angle answering a young couples' wish. There's also that short with Coily the Spring Sprite telling of the joys of springs. Thhis is a colection of ephemeral gems to tickle your sense of taste!",1315958400,,846,4.722972972972973
