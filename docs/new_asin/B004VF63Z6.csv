4482332,5,B004VF63Z6,I did so enjoy watching my favorite Debbie Reynolds and her daughter Carrie Fisher and also her son Todd Fisher. She has led an amazing life and I wish her and her family many many more healthy and happy years.,1376956800,,210,4.275
4482333,5,B004VF63Z6,This is a special trip through the life of two American Film & Entertainment Stars that happened to be Mother & Daughter. As with most relationships they had highs and lows. I felt it was a very honest portrayal,1374364800,,211,4.435897435897436
4482334,3,B004VF63Z6,Not bad but just OK.  Carrie's one-woman show Wishful Drinking is a much more entertaining way to catch their story.,1361145600,2,116,4.8
4482335,5,B004VF63Z6,"I've ALWAYS been fascinated with this mother-daughter relationship and I FINALLY get to own the story!! And its coming from them!! I've always been a huge Debbie Reynolds fan since I was young, and I love Carrie's work just as much (my hubby is a Carrie superfan!) but I've always been so intrigued by their personal lives and this answers sooooo many of my questions. GET IT!! YOU WON'T BE SORRY!!",1333584000,,398,4.619718309859155
4482336,5,B004VF63Z6,"While they have remained in the spotlight for many years, it wasn't until I saw this DVD that I finally got to hear Debbie Reynolds and Carrie Fisher speak for themselves. Given their famously stormy mother daughter relationship, I really enjoyed hearing their own takes. Clearly, these two survivors have contended with a lot, and as a result, they both have a lot to share with us. Definitely worth the price.",1304380800,6,411,4.802816901408451

4482347,5,B004VF63Z6,"Great to see how close they were to each other in the end.  Glad to see all the old family movies, and to see Eddie Fisher just before he died.  All that was sad, but the whole production was great!",1486080000,,198,3.925

4482360,4,B004VF63Z6,"Certainly a worthwhile watch and very enjoyable as Carrie Fisher is incredibly witty and cynical. It was admittedly sad having seen her unhealthy life catching up with her just prior to her death but the real shocker was the blatantly apparent deep love and respect that she had for her mother, flaws and all.",1485734400,,309,4.7407407407407405
4482361,5,B004VF63Z6,It was thorough and lovely representation of their relationship.,1485734400,,64,6.222222222222222
4482362,5,B004VF63Z6,It was a good documentary.,1485734400,,26,4.4
4482363,5,B004VF63Z6,A very inspiring story that brings tears to ones eyes. I would have liked to enjoy seeing Debbie for a few more years like Betty White but I think the geartbreaking passing of Carrie just was too much to bear for her.,1485734400,,217,4.190476190476191
4482364,5,B004VF63Z6,Excellent--fast paced and revealed some details about both women's lives that I had not known before.,1485734400,,101,5.375
4482365,5,B004VF63Z6,It was a wonderful program about how mothers and daughters can respect each other even though they have differences.  They both had anormous amount of love for each other.  It showed through their deaths within a short time.,1485734400,,224,4.868421052631579
4482366,4,B004VF63Z6,"We watched with interest about the relationship between Mother and Daughter.  This documentary was well done, and presented in a thoughtful way.  The dynamics between Debbie and Carrie were poignant and strong.  The struggles of life and growing were shamelessly addressed.  But the bond between these two women was unmistakable.  It left us sad for their struggles, but uplifted for their honesty and willingness to look at themselves, and each other, in truth.  We wish them both well in their next journey.",1485648000,,509,5.146341463414634

4482369,2,B004VF63Z6,I was surprised to see this video so fast after the untimely deaths of Carrie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds. This is an old video done many years ago that offers little to understanding these two interesting ladies.,1485475200,,212,4.756756756756757
4482370,2,B004VF63Z6,"Boring, predictable, seemed like some in-house PR piece. Didn't even finish watching it. Not interesting enough to warrant ""hate.""",1485388800,,130,5.894736842105263
4482371,5,B004VF63Z6,Just a great overall snapshot of the Mother Daughter bonds that stood the test of time.,1485388800,,87,4.5
4482372,3,B004VF63Z6,"How ironic that Carrie would go out the same way as her drug buddy John Belushi,  30 some years later. John said to Carrie you are just like me. He couldn't have known how right he was. Sad that she still couldn't kick the drug habit, even with all the love and support from her family. What an ugly way to go out. Especially with her mom following her the next day. Sorry Todd, there is nothing magical and beautiful about this now.",1485388800,,433,4.216867469879518

4482387,3,B004VF63Z6,Well done.  I miss them both.  Grew up with Debbie and her movies which gave me great joy she will be greatly missed.  Carrie was a wonderful writer and I will always remember Post Cards From The Edge and Starwars.  Can't wait to see the new documentary that was done for HBO.

4482417,4,B004VF63Z6,"Very interesting but disappointing to see what both Debbie and Carrie had regressed to.  Debbie couldn't help her health issues, but I felt embarrassed for her that her fans were allowed to see her in what even at one point appeared to be a lapse in mental health.  I met her once in Las Vegas and it was surprising and sad to see the immense decline in her physical condition.  Carrie is known for being unorthodox and crass but a portion of the film was kind of shocking concerning her.  Well maybe not shocking that she is like that (most of us already know) --- it just seemed humiliating in a documentary shared with her now elderly mother who was clearly nearing the end of her beloved life.",1484092800,2,697,4.421875

4482493,5,B004VF63Z6,"Glad this was available as part of Amazon Prime on this the day of Carrie's death.  At 60 she was still young in comparison to many, but she lived a full life.  Was struck by how nice her brother seems in this, like Carrie and her mom.  Condolences to both of them on their loss.  Was also struck previously when seeing Carrier on television by her down to earth normalness although I didn't know much about her nor about her mom's life until reading more today and watching this.  It seems that her normalness is a tribute to her upbringing by her mom in the face of challenges many people would fail to embrace the challenges of or crumble over, and as such is related to her mom's character and heritage.  It was especially fun to hear about Debbie's embrace of Girl Scouting and their differences.  What a nice family.  Blessings to Todd and Debbie.  Carrie's passing away seems akin to an end to an era.  Glad Carrie shared so much of her life with the public, including this documentary.  Her life and brother's and mother's relationships with her, a reason for celebration in the face of loss.  From a quick look at what is available, there is certainly a lot more to Carrie's story out there, but this was a good way to learn about her.",1482796800,23,1244,4.431718061674009

Not much I didn't know before, but I liked seeing the two talk about each other, and the interview with Todd was interesting.  I always hear about Carrie's brother, but I've never seen him on film before.  Talk about the average Joe.  He's so down to earth.  Lots of old clips and perfectly paced.

You read Carrie's book and you know how wonderful this could have been. It wasn't done well, which is surprising for the Intimate Portraits label. They barely discussed their lives, and all-in-all made me hate myself for watching this. Pass and get Wishful Drinking by Carrie Fisher. If you want, get the Audiobook. Carrie reading the book and doing the impression of her mother is HYSTERICAL.",1519257600,,516,5.304878048780488
