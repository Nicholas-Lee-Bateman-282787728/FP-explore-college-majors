Zombie films I watched recently and I strongly recommend.all different in style and story.

JUAN of the Dead - I say the best Zombie film in 2012. I will watch it again soon with friends.

Abraham Lincoln vs. Zombies - The Asylum produced a really good Zombie film, I was surprised,its good.",1339632000,2,421,4.901408450704225
5063968,4,B00795E3ZM,"There are certain kinds of stories used in movies that become so popular that they pass the tipping point plunging into the hackney. Among the myriad of genres available to the screenwriters the one most prone to overuse is found in the realm of horror flicks. Even in that sliver of filmmaking there are slices that have become overused for example the slasher flick. Without a doubt another has to be the zombie horde. The ravaging mass on staggering undead has become exceptionally popular in some rather unusual ways. People dress up as zombies and normal going out into the night on `zombie' crawls' acting out scenarios of doom on the city streets. A very popular television series featuring these `Walking Dead' demonstrates that this kind of story is far from being played out, there are still aspects that can be discovered if the filmmaker has the insight and talent new twists on the zombie film can still be had. Considering the undead has been a staple of horror films since the thirties when most were the result of intervention of a practitioner of the occult forbidden arts of voodoo. Since George Romero reinvented zombies as social commentary theses rotting corpses have had the potential for innovative plot lines as well as some of the worse quick and cheap independent movies. Fortunately for devotees of movies there are still creative filmmakers willing to think out of the box. John Geddes happens to be one such auteurs and his latest opus, `Exit Humanity' demonstrates that this old dog has a few new tricks left. He is part of a new vanguard of horror masters that has looked into history for a setting; transplanting the familiar creatures of death into a well known historical setting, the Civil War. He is among the first to proceed on this tangent but the trend seems to be growing. Many `steam punk' stories are based in this turbulent time in our country's history as well as a recent action horror film that turns Abraham Lincoln into a vampire slayer. Mr. Geddes pulls back in time to an era when there was certainly no shortage of fresh courses just waiting for reanimation. I was hesitant when I read the synopsis on the screener but within minutes of watching the film I found myself enthralled, my attention affixed to the screen, realizing I was watching something special.

There is a certain fascination that many Americans hold for the bloodiest war ever fought on our soil, the Civil War or as some in the Deep South continue to refer to it, `The War of Northern Aggression'. The summer is an appropriate time to turn our attention to this conflict as July Forth does mark the anniversary of the most costly battle in the war, Gettysburg. This film immediately draws the audience into the brutal violence of the time by opening with an all out battle scene. We see a familiar sight for war buffs and frequent viewers of the History Channel, battle weary men clad in the grey and blue of their respective nations clashing in mortal combat. Then, slowly we notice there is a third force merging into the fray; a sizable force of zombies. Rather that commit a lot of film to a prolonged explanation this scene economically defines the foundation of this alternate universe. Socioeconomic fight that lead to dividing the nation has been settled on the battlefield but now as the two sides attempt to heal and rebuild the battle lines are once again drawn. Instead of policy and geography determining you allegiance it is now a bitter struggle for the living to defend against the ravenous host of the decaying undead.

The film continues to renovate persistent tropes by updating the `found footage' motif. True to a period appropriate story telling the video footage has been replaced by recently located journal. This provides an intimate first person account through the personal experiences of the narrator, Edward Young (Mark Gibson). Innovations like this are accumulated stacking one layer upon another creating a solid foundation for the story. With such a fanciful departure from both the classic Civil War film and the traditional zombie flick. If fans of either kind of flick complain about the mixture or divergence from the typical then you can be certain they have not seen this movie. It is not uncommon for a story set in this period to feature a man who lost his wife and son but once again the construction of the plot surrounds the anticipated character archetype and places him in a totally novel set of circumstances.

It is one thing to use a journal as a prop to ease into narration as the written word gives way to dialogue but Mr. Geddes takes things a step further. Common to the journals of the period Edward accompanied his words with numerous drawings of the people and circumstances he encountered in his life. As the camera focuses o one of these sketches the audience is whisked into the depicted scene becoming a firsthand observer of the story. This is simply put brilliant adding an immediacy and intimacy to the film that is usually lacking particularly in a movie featuring decaying antagonists.

I found myself compelled to watch this film several times, with each viewing is discovered yet another layer with nuances I had not yet explored. It has been a very long time since I felt that way about a horror film. Much of this is derived by the mlange offered up by the director. He is relatively new to his craft as writer and director with one previous feature to his credit, `Scarce'. There he took on the standard horror ploy of isolation. I look forward to obtaining a copy to add to what I am certain will become a growing collection of this artist's work. The drawings slip into period style animation before finally morphing into live action. This enhances the overall effect of transporting the audience back in time to witness the travails of this simple solider. In all this film is rich in detail with but a few technical missteps. Fir something made on a miniscule budget it is the epitome of the independent film; talent, innovation and art over the overwhelming need for box office.",1339632000,20,6075,4.771863117870723
5063969,5,B00795E3ZM,The film looks amazing.  I loved the concept of zombies after the civil war.  Very refreshing take on the zombie movie genre.,1339372800,2,125,4.636363636363637
5063970,1,B00795E3ZM,"The story is told from the journal of Civil War soldier, Edward Young (Mark Gibson). It includes excessive boring narration. Rather than just let the story unfold, the narrator tells you what you are seeing. It grates on you after the first 30 minutes.

After a quick 1865 scene where a single Union soldier is a zombie, the movie jumps to 1871 and there is a minor zombie infestation. Edward had to kill his own wife (Sarah Stunt) and son, the later in an emotionally gripping scene as he holds his zombie son (Christian Martyn) in his arms (facing away) as he reluctantly puts a gun to his son's head... all the while his son is trying to eat his face off. Somehow I didn't feel it.

Bits and pieces of the story is told through animation, which unfortunately was far better than the main feature. Edward has tasked himself in taking his son's ashes to a waterfalls, something he had promised him when he was alive. There is an unwritten rule that all promises terminate with any zombie infestation, apparently not known in the 19th century. The story involves his journey to get there and the people/zombies he meets up with along the way.

Dee Wallace, the closet thing to an actor in this film gives us a career killer performance as she emotionally explains the origins of the living dead. It was tough to sit through. The film utilizes the sad piano/violin sound track for way too much of the production.

Zombie fans should avoid this one. I was confused as I couldn't tell if the film was a bad zombie film or a bad drama with zombies.

No f-bombs, sex, or nudity. Zombie make-up was good where it was applied, exposed necks are optional.

***POSSIBLE PLOT SPOILER*** The film attempts to come across as a prequel for zombie films. It does a very poor job. It tells you zombies were created using African spells. But at the same time refutes that idea by making it seem zombies are caused by a virus, with one person in the film having natural immunity, and the infection spreading by a saliva/blood contact. You can't have it both ways.",1339200000,,2046,4.546195652173913

I was not a huge fan of the voiceover and I wish it wasn't done as a retrospective, but it wasn't my movie so there's that.  I love low budget horror.  I recommend that people not  make judgments or develop an expectation prior to viewing any horror movie ever.  I always recommend watching the behind the scenes features.

5063976,4,B00795E3ZM,"A unique entry in the zombie genre, Exit Humanity takes place at the close of the Civil War. In fact it begins in the midst of a civil War skirmish, where the first zombies enter the scene. And they are zombies; these are the living dead, slow and lumbering and hungry as ever for human flesh. The action centers on Edward Young, a Confederate soldier who is one of the first to encounter a zombie. Not long after he has to put down his wife and forced to set off to find his young son who has run away. They are seen mostly in sunny flashbacks.

the film, written and directed by John Geddes, is remarkably artful and inventive given its reported #300,000 budget. The woods of Canada stand in for the woods of Tennessee, but I think we all know by now that a small budget film will take place in the wilds and also that it will have a small cast.  Though the cast is small, they are effective, though the head bad guy tends to overact the way head bad guys do in these kinds of films. For a very long time after the opening one only sees Edward Young and I admit I was wondering if this was going to be a one-person film. But be assured he eventually meets up with others and the film takes off in another direction than one man roaming the wilderness. In  fact the film develops into the kind of post apocalyptic drama where it's other people who are a bigger problem than the zombies.

The zombies, when they appear sporadically throughout the film, are made up to look really horrible and are very effective. They usually attack solo or in small numbers, so don't expect too much zombie-action or anything on a grand scale. There is a moderate-sized horde at one point in the film. Be aware that the story is often told with narration (by Brian Cox), and taht the narration is told with a gimmick. Edward keeps a journal through all these times and also illustrates what has been happening, as he has an artistic talent. At times the action switches from the world at large to his journal where the pictures become animated and the animation moves the story forward. It is obviously a way to create scenes that would be too expensive to film live. Because the movie is good, I accept this, and they are artfully done. It helps that they look like someone's drawings and not some attempt to fool the audience with computer animation. They are all very short.  There's even an attempt to explain the origins of the zombies via supernatural scrolls in the best of the animated sequences.

The film looks terrific. I was really taken with the beautiful camerawork in this film, something you can almost never say about any zombie film. In fact, the look is its strongest point. where it's weak is in its pacing. At almost two hours long, it's slow, sometimes very slow.  It spent too much time showing Edward's grief over losing his family and in fact, too much time in most of the subsequent developments. Only rarely was there any tension, and everyone seems to have all the time in the world. For Example (Minor Spoiler Here): when the good people manage to escape the bad ones it takes forever for them to meet up again even though they seem to be only a short hike from each other's camps.

Zombie action fans are not going to like this film, but people who like exploring the human relationships during an apocalypse will find some interest here as will those just looking for something different in the zombie genre.",1470960000,2,3423,4.4656

5063985,5,B00795E3ZM,yes what we all waited for,1444089600,,26,3.5
5063986,4,B00795E3ZM,"I confess I don't usually like zombie films: they tend to be nihilistic and generally substitute gore for story. A notable exception is 28 Days Later, and of course Bela Lugosi's White Zombie, but Exit Humanity is up there with those genre classics in terms of storytelling power. Indeed, in terms of ambition I'm not sure any previous zombie film compares to what Exit Humanity is going for.

Exit Humanity is essentially the story of Civil War vet Edward Young, whose only ambition in life is, in his own words, ""to be a good man."" But in the closing days of the War--toxic enough to Young's soul on its own--an insidious new plague begins sweeping through the land, one which mysteriously brings the dead back to a semblance of life, brainless but ravenous. This new evil invades Young's home, and takes from him everything he loves: his wife and son. Convinced that he buries his own purpose for living along with his family, Young sets out on a final quest in their honor. It is an odyssey through a dead-haunted landscape of good and evil that will either lead Young to a rebirth, or finish him off entirely.

Many fans of zombie films--or even horror films in general--may not agree with my assessment of Exit Humanity. It is a slow, methodical film, and while the zombies are indeed central to the plot the human drama of Young and his friends and enemies are moreso. The zombie SFX are adequate, and the undead themselves are suitably corpse-like and feral, but they generally serve as a framing device for the internal conflicts of the human characters. Exit Humanity uses the undead holocaust as a catalyst to explore themes of faith and suffering, love and death, and the quest for peace in a world gone mad. It is at times unbearably heartbreaking, but ultimately life-affirming in a way that doesn't deny the sufferings of a fallen world, but nonetheless points the way toward hope even in the midst of apocalypse. And if it is not entirely a typical zombie movie, it is because of that Exit Humanity is superior to most of its kin.",1438387200,,2046,4.664819944598338

It's basically a vehicle for Stephen McHattie is mourn endlessly over his dead wife and missing son, his sorrowful sobbing and tortured searching occasionally broken by the appearance of a zombie or a few, so deadening is the mood already that the walking dead hardly seem a match for the protagonist's depression.  I get that the walking dead are meant to be a metaphor of sorts for the lead character's suddenly faithless soul, but they also point out the lack of life in the direction as well.  The only empathy you feel for McHattie is that he's in such a soulless project.

5064019,1,B00795E3ZM,"Exit Humanity (2011)
 Every rule of thumb must have exceptions-after all, the exception proves the rule doesnt it?  I have a developing rule of thumb that Zombie flicks made in this century are better pieces of art than those of the old 20th Century.  And now Exit Humanity comes along and makes the counter argument.
 The only way this movie could hurt you is not to scare you but to BORE YOU TO DEATH.  If you like long pensive looks at the face of a man who has lost his family to a Zombie outbreak, be my guest.  If you a film that makes even murder, Zombie fights, and existential loss dreary and un-dramatic, you have found it.  This half brain tedious exercise in expanding the patience of the audience is an utter waste of time.
 Too bad too, because writer/director John Geddes has two other feature length films to his credit and used real actors.  But what a bore this is.  He should know better and now you do.
 The film has a positive set up.  A guy comes home from the Civil War only to encounter a Zombie outbreak.  Also good, if cheap, is the way the director uses drawings to fill out the action from time to time.  He doesnt have to spend the money to film stuff.  But watching people move around in the winter woods of Appalachia, stare into the camera and generally not say or do very much isn't much fun for the thrill seeking audience.

5064021,3,B00795E3ZM,"I won't say the film is bad, just weak.  It may be a bit much to take in one sitting but if you can sit through it, you will love the ending.

This movie moves slower than an arthritic hip replacement patient on the way to a colonoscopy.  You find yourself waiting for commercial breaks.

It has a made-for-TV feel to it with a quality that hovers between community theater and Sci Fi Channel original movie.  I think it is the costumes that really hold this film back.  It may be Dee Wallace dressed like a high school version of a gypsy or the (I kid you not) pleather jacket worn by the protagonist.  Not even good pleather.  Is there such a thing as bootleg pleather?  You may think so after watching this.

Of course he makes up for it with his origami blanket.  A small blanket that he cunningly converts into a scarf/shawl/hood arrangement that would make MacGyver drool.

Warning!  Here be spoiler alerts!

There are plot holes you could drive a Kardasian through.  Mainly, the movie seems indecisive about what it is about.  A man returns from hunting to discover his wife dead and son missing.  This is a film about a man searching for his son.

Oh wait!  He finds the boy and the kid is now a zombie.  So he burns the boys body and gathers his ashes.  He remembers a waterfall he promised to take his son to and sets out with the ashes.  This is a film about a man bringing his sons ashes to the waterfall.

Oh, wait!  He meets another man whose sister was kidnapped by a gang of evil men.  He asks him to help him save her.  This is a film about a man who lost everything and is now looking for something someone else lost.  Hell, the kid can wait, right?

Oh wait!

You get the idea.

So how can this movie be ok?  Frankly, it is good in spite of the campy costumes and poor pacing. And apparent ADHD.  You care about the characters (although there is a scene where he tries to commit suicide that actually had me in stitches)  The story slips little points in there and it all comes together perfectly.  You will find yourself cheering cleverness of the resolution.  The ending is one of the best I have ever seen and I have seen hundreds of horror movies.

Do see this film.  It is worth the trouble.  If you are a zombie fan, it is a must have for your collection.  And if you love unintentional humor, you must see the suicide scene. :-)",1404000000,,2354,4.263636363636364

It worked well in Abe Lincoln vs the zombies but by no means in this case.  There were animated sketches throughout the film which didn't seem to serve any purpose.

5064044,3,B00795E3ZM,"In a world stuffed to the eyeballs with zombie films, the horror genre continues to explore new ideas with zombies merely a backdrop for good storytelling.  In ""Exit Humanity,"" an atmospheric meditation on being a parent in post-Civil War America, the zombies are just another hazard in a dangerous world.

Narrator Brian Cox shares the story of Edward Young (Mark Gibson), a soldier of the South who loses his wife and son to the zombie outbreak.  Distraught, he plays with his life in a game of Russian roulette, only to decide on a new course of action: Young will spread his son's ashes at a scenic waterfall he promised to take him to.

With this singular goal in mind, Young sets out across a blasted countryside, facing down zombies and looters before he meets a fellow survivor Isaac (Adam Seybold), who has a nobler cause in mind.  Isaac's sister Emma (Jordan Hayes) has been kidnapped by the mad general Williams (Bill Moseley), who is hell bent on finding a cure to the zombie plague. Williams is convinced he can find someone who is immune to the zombie plague and thereby create a cure.

There's a bit of a logic leap in this plot twist: it's never made clear why Williams would think a cure is feasible and why such a cure would be found in a person instead of say, a flower or a medicine man's poultice.  But once the basic nature of the plot is set up we know that any hope of a cure is most assuredly tied up in Isaac's quest to rescue his sister.

The movie is told in chapter format, as written down by Young in his journal.  The beginning narrative implies that a zombie plague has returned but never addresses what's happening in the present -- it's besides the point.  Instead, we're treated to beautiful sketches that bridge each scene, skipping ahead to propel the narrative.  Unfortunately this doesn't happen nearly enough, and there are interminable sequences where not much happens.  Youngs spends a lot of time roaring into the wind.

There's not a lot of twists in the ending.  The beauty of a well-crafted zombie film is that it's about people first, zombie second, and ""Exit Humanity"" is no different.  But it's a little too plodding, a little too meandering a little too self-absorbed with its heavy themes of forgiveness and rebirth, to be really be entertaining.  ""Exit Humanity"" is a bit of a snooze at times and that's a shame, because it's cinematography is beautiful enough to take time to drink in.

When you make a movie with such mindless objects like zombies, you really have to feel invested in the living heros, and this movie does that.  The film-maker really makes you feel involved with the main character and builds on that investment throughout the film.  Yes, there are some little things that are annoying throughout the film.  The audio in some scenes was much too overpowering, they over-killed the music a bit much.  But, really that's nothing in comparison to the great story line and characters in this film.

The zombies and gore are present, but not in your face, and that's because they take a back seat to the plight of the living. Sometimes the ""living"" are far more evil than the dead, and sometimes the very act of ""continuing"" with pain and loss makes us heroic. If you are looking for a mindless, big budget zombiefest - go elsewhere - and that's also why I can understand some people giving it a low rating.

He is looking for a reason to keep on living in a world that is a living hell. So we follow this man Edward Young (intensely and superbly played by Mark Gibson) on his quest for going on with his life. We feel and suffer with him every step of his way. Castwise it's always nice to see pros like Dee Wallace, Bill Moseley and Stephen McHattie at work. This film is an exercise in originality storywise and stylewise (especially for a film with a small budget).

A lone warrior is left to carve a new life in this twisted new world, but he will find even more to fear in the other surviving humans than in the walking dead. John Geddes' ambitious period piece reshapes the history of the walking dead in EXIT HUMANITY. Not only is the film beautifully shot and finely dressed in its best wartime attire, but it also provides powerful performances by its leading cast members Mark Gibson and Adam Seybold. Geddes spends his time carefully crafting his characters without feeling the need to rush either the action or gore, an encouraging trait that is shared with television's The Walking Dead. This allows for a clear emotional rapport with our lead that is carried on through the end of his journey. Bill Moseley joins the cast as the disillusioned General Williams, along with Dee Wallace and Stephen McHattie in other supporting roles. Rich in character, atmosphere, and mood, EXIT HUMANITY is never to be overlooked.

5064061,5,B00795E3ZM,"I can remember the first time a film within the horror genre moved me, and that was ""Carrie"".

It must have been the pain and sadness, and the depth which we were able to look deep within Carrie White that affected me so heavily. Like Sissy Spacek gave a great and convincing performance, so did Mark Gibson as Edward Young in ""Exit to humanity"".  The excellent acting of the mourning-main character is what grabs you so quickly and then allows the brilliance of the script, writing, cinematography, direction and the mood of the film to carry and captivate you throughout and to the end.

I don't know if i have ever seen such dynamite performances in a Zombie movie...ever. The original Dawn of the Dead.. 28 Days later, all had characters we had become attached to, but were we emotionally moved by them? I believe it was more so of a cheering and rooting-on of those characters. In ""Exit"" I became concerned as to how Edward Young would cope with his pain, and what wisdom he could obtain and give us, the viewer. So many fine performances form several actors including Dee Wallace who was exceptional.

With strong atmosphere and make-up effects ""Edge"" showed greatness without the use of intense gore, something we expect from a Zombie movie, and tend to look forward to, but its absence in no way whatsoever took anything away from it. The soundtrack was top notch, and definitely a part of the equation to stir ones emotions along with the acting. The unique take and possible cause of the Zombie plague that has kept fans of the genre wondering, ""why?"", was well done. Also, i would never have thought that you could tell me a post Civil-War Tennessee zombie flick could be convincing by any means, but it utterly did, and i never questioned the period piece aspect of the film once during my viewing. I was captivated. I was moved. It has been quite some time since i have been more than just 'satisfied' with a horror flick... I was 'fulfilled'. I also thought the animated sequences added an authenticity to the narratives as well.

I leave it to you to analyze the plot etc, etc, BUT, for those who appreciate good films of any genre, you need to watch this. Many people say its so much more than a Horror film, i guess it is. The point a superb film makes, is that it takes you far beyond its simplistic, classified category; Action, Comedy, Drama, Love story... it allows you to think, examine and ponder so many of its elements that it keeps you thinking.

What a great film.

5064062,4,B00795E3ZM,"This is yet another Zombie film, but I just find them so addictive that I thought I would give this one a go. And I must say I am really glad I did. It is set in the aftermath of the American Civil War; we are taken to Tennessee in 1865 where we are introduced to Edward Young played by upcoming newbie Mark Gibson. He has come home to find his wife has `turned' and his beloved son is missing. He kills and buries his wife and then gets on his trusted steed called `Shiloh', and sets off to find his missing son; always fearing the worst. He has authentic weapons for the period too which is something I always appreciate.

The plot is told with the use of some animation, which I didn't get at first but it actually added quite a bit to the whole atmosphere of the film, which is one of its strong points. The story is being narrated by an heir to Edward called Malcolm Young, and this voice is that of Brian Cox, who is always excellent even when it is just the timbre and passion of his voice.

On his search he meets more of the undead and then he meets up with some more dangerous folk and these ones aint Zombies. I really liked this film, it has a haunting quality that has nothing to do with the subject matter but the excellent performances put in by the entire cast. The special effects are all excellent too and the Zombies are the good old fashioned kind who amble around moaning in their blood lust, with dead eyes being left as windows to a soul that has long since vacated.

This is an original and emotionally charged take on the Zombie genre that is a really refreshing change, to say too much may be a plot spoiler and this is one that you will take something from all of the action. It is not a gore fest but a study of the psychology of grief and coping in extreme circumstances, there is also superstition, love, lunacy and greed, so pretty much something for all the family - except the kids of course.

However, warily, I started to watch Exit Humanity and was almost immediately impressed when I was greeted by a narrative from Brian Cox (Braveheart, The Ring, Troy, Manhunter) and a brief battle scene from the American Civil War, with the addition of the undead!
As opposed to many zombie/infected films, Exit Humanity does not rely on gore or flesh-rending scenes to pad out proceedings. In fact, Exit Humanity is very much about the lead character Edward Young and how he copes with the bleak events which he faces. Relative newcomer Mark Gibson (Monster Brawl, Psych) delivers a believable performance as Young and is ably supported throughout by Adam Seybold and Jordan Hayes (Nostrum, 2012's House at the end of the Street); and surprisingly, by horror regulars such as Bill Moseley as the maniacal General Williams (The Devil's Rejects, Army of Darkness, House of 1000 Corpses), Stephen McHattie (A Little Bit Zombie, Watchmen, Red: Werewolf Hunter) and a turn from an almost unrecognisable Dee Wallace (The Holwing, Cujo, Critters) who gives proceedings greater depth with her expository role.

There were points during proceedings when this film could have veered off the precipice and become a straightforward action-horror. However, writer and director John Geddes has created something special with Exit Humanity and manages to marry up the performances of his actors, an appropriate score, quality special effects by The Brothers Gore (Jeff & Jason Derushie) and bleak, bleached footage perfectly to create an atmosphere that are absent from much larger projects, never mind a small independent film.

At times, I was reminded of a number of different films, most notably The Outlaw Josey Wales. This may seem strange but I submit to you that Exit Humanity and Josey Wales both have as their central characters hardy men who are haunted by the events of their past and Exit Humanity does indeed have a kind of Western vibe to it.

I loved Exit Humanity. It is an ambitious horror tale that does an incredible amount with a very modest budget. However, it won't be for everyone. I suspect that fans of the zombie sub-genre may be left a little disappointed since the pace of the film is distinctly more relaxed than your average undead/infected flick. Additionally, there are brief interludes of animation which may not fit with the majority's impression of conventional horror films. To my mind, Exit Humanity dared to be different and pulls it off incredibly well.

Exit Humanity is not only a tremendously powerful horror film; but simply a tremendous film that is rendered all the more impressive when factoring in that it is an independent production.",1355356800,,3151,5.098837209302325

""Exit Humanity"" was not that.  It wasn't the same thing over and over.  It took a bit.  I had to wait for it, however, when the credits rolled, I felt I had watched something worthwhile and ... about zombies.  The thing was, it wasn't so much about zombies as it was about the search for hope.  One man's nightmare and desire to die transformed back into hope and even love.  If you are wanting a movie full of blood and guts with ripping action and heads flying, there are a lot of those out there - pick one.  Heck, pick 10.  But, if you don't mind a movie that takes its time and unwinds, showing you something that you can like and enjoy and even feel a bit good about, then ""Exit Humanity"" may just be what you are looking for.

5064075,5,B00795E3ZM,"If you are a fan of Zombies, this to me was a masterpiece. It take place after the US Civil war. A plague that gets explained near the middle of the movie. It starts out kind of average, a man, a Confederate soldier loses his wife and son to the plague and tries to kill himself but fate won't let him die. So he sets out to honor his son by scattering his ashes into a place his son wanted to see one day. Then he makes a friend along the way. They rescue his sister from ex soldiers looking for a cure to the plague by experimenting on live prisoners.

This movie is philosophical, has historical content, lots of Zombies, lots of killing, a depiction of how the plague began, and a grand finale at the end with a gun duel. No stupid typical ending...I get so sick of those dumb ass endings where you are finally content and satisfied and then either the hero is killed or the movie tries to depict a reemergence of the terror at the end. No this movie ends happily, but suggests love and the will to live ever after catastrophe. It is a rarity and though the 1st 30 minutes or so only depicted suffering and I was kind of bored, it got very good and I was compelled to see it through.",1351987200,2,1187,4.138528138528138
5064076,2,B00795E3ZM,"Exit Humanity offers a somewhat different take on the zombie genre, as it takes place a few years after the Civil War.  The story follows a veteran (Mark Gibson) who begins searching for his son after coming home to find his wife as being one of the undead, and eventually leads into something much, much worse.  Narrated by Brian Cox and also featuring genre stalwarts Dee Wallace, Bill Moseley, and Stephen McHattie, Exit Humanity is a low-budget affair that isn't short on ingenuity, as it features great performances and some surprisingly stunning animated segments as well.  Though it has all these good qualities, Exit Humanity is as slow as molasses.  While I appreciate someone trying to do something new and fresh with the genre, the film is so drawn out that you will lose interest very, very quickly.  That, and a number of the characters you won't really care for, which doesn't help matters either.  If you have the patience, give Exit Humanity a look, but don't expect a whole lot out of it.",1351987200,,1005,4.747126436781609
5064077,2,B00795E3ZM,"Some movies are good when they move slowly, Suspense,Drama,Romance,etc. But some movies genre's should NEVER move slowly Horror,Action,Thriller, and THIS DANG MOVIE!

This is a post Civil War involving zombies (with cheap makeup) and a main plot that in any other movie would be a minor 10minute sub story. Think about The Book Of Eli. Imagine if instead the movie wasn't about a man on a quest to deliver a book but instead it stopped 20 minutes into his journey after he came across the first gang of bandits, and that became the entire movie. That is what Exit Humanity is. It's a long drawn on movie with an uninteresting plot that doesn't carry much suspense. The acting is good for this type of low budget film, and the animated selections add an interesting touch. However what's out of place is the Narration POV story format that gets old quickly and the idea that there's never a moment when you feel like the characters have a reason to run for their lives or be in fear like most Zombie movies.

This probably would have been a better Post Civil War movie than a Zombie movie. It would be better if there were no Zombies and instead it was about a Soldier who came home and found his family murdered by bandits and go on a hunt to find them for revenge, then find out in the end the bandits are a group of soldiers who have been tainted by what they've experienced in war and can't seem to forget the battle field so they kill,rape, and rob people. Then the movie is about the former soldier hunting down these men and making them pay for what they did and in the final scene he has a stand off with the former General who commanded the group of bandits and for a twist let it not be just that he had a simple group of bandits, but they were just a few soldiers from the army he was rebuilding to raise war again only this time to attack the WEST.

Exit Humanity is about what makes us human. Its about the grief of losing, the hope of living. The movie was visually gorgeous with a unique attention to detail.

5064084,4,B00795E3ZM,"This movie was good, with a few caveats. Some major flaws include the mismatched guns that were all wrong for the period, including the opening scene where our hero is carrying a Marlin 1894 at the end of the civil war. And in one scene they are carrying nickel Colt 1873 Peacemakers (a cartridge pistol) and in the next scene they are front stuffing the cylinders of their blued revolvers with black powder. Another minor irritation is that the character spends a lot of the movie wearing a black leather jacket but black leather didn't come around until the early 20th century with the advent of chrome tanning; up until then leather was vegetable tanned in various shades of brown. But movies are all about the suspension of disbelief, right? Once I let go of these minor flaws I really enjoyed it. As the title of my review suggests it bears some thematic similarities to The Outlaw Josey Wales, except for the walking dead. This story was more about the spiritual journey than your typical zombie shred-fest, but it's a worthy addition to my collection of zombie documentaries.",1348704000,,1082,4.76063829787234
5064085,4,B00795E3ZM,"In the wake of an incredible explosion of films and television embracing Director George A. Romero's living dead cycle as of late, there are always some gems that seem to arise within the muck of remakes, pandemic clones and virtual blood baths leading up to nothing.  Writer/Director John Geddes's 'EXIT HUMANITY'-2011 is just that rare gem.  By placing the story during the decline of the Civil War,  we see how the survivors try to cope with an outbreak of living dead through a diary which has survived over the years seeming to be found by modern day humans facing their own living dead onslaught.  The audience is treated as a reader of the document as pages are turned and chapters are introduced while our main character Edward Young continues to write installments till the films conclusion. What Mr. Geddes tries to show in this affair is that their were scrolls of rituals that have survived since the dawn of man that contain spells that can reanimate the dead and that a woman who dabbled in witchcraft had them in her possession. One of the films characters introduced in the middle of the film came across these scrolls and decided to resurrect her dead sister with disastrous results culminating in the spreading of the virus. Interlocked with this story is a sub plot involving a civil war general who's in serious denial that the war is over and is using his megalomania to control what is left of humanity.  Unfortunately, the films only flaw is it length.  The performances are spot on:  Mark Gibson is our main character who gives a remarkable performance in coping with the loss of family and the ever growing  nightmare quickly surrounding him who's diary narration is done by actor Brian Cox giving it an eerie maturity during the proceedings; a beautiful performance by actress Dee Wallace giving her role of Eve, the woman of the forest, incredible fragility and strength; and almost cameos by actors Bill Moseley and Stephen McHattie.  The gorgeous cinematography by Brendon Uegama filmed in Ontario, Canada elevates the film from being just another low budget zombie entry and our living dead cast are adorned with excellent makeup and just the right shambling to give this film the kick it deserves. The film is released to DVD by a company called Bloody Disgusting films in a beautiful 2.35 transfer with excellent sound to enhance the eerieness. Director Geddes leaves us with an unsettling feeling that every hundred years an outbreak of living dead could occur giving our modern day news stories of government training in coping with possible zombie occurrences hackle raising food for thought. For those looking for an unusual way of spending yet another moment with the living dead until they actually rise, click the add to cart button and enjoy this welcome entry into the Zombie canon.",1348444800,3,2823,4.889121338912134
5064086,5,B00795E3ZM,"""Exit Humanity"" is so far above 90 percent of the ""Zombie"" genre films coming out lately, it is almost not a zombie film.  Full of the depth, feeling, and realism of a drama about the loss and pain left after the bloodiest battle in America's history, I found myself wondering at times, why the producer and director hadn't changed directions and filmed an engaging Civil War drama.  But I'm also glad they did not.  For it lifted the tired old story of a man losing everything after the war, and seeking revenge, and hope, to a whole new level with the zombie background story.  Or maybe I should've said, it lifted the zombie genre to a whole new level with the Civil War as the backdrop.  The film is suitably dark, grim, and emotional, as zombie films should be.  The cast is excellent here, with a mixture of brand new (Mark Gibson) and veteran actors (Stephen McHattie and Dee Wallace) working well together. If I have one minor gripe, it is that I would've loved to see more screen time with Stephen McHattie.

Some have complained about the pacing, but I believe the director did this intentionally, giving the film an old world, pre-technological feel as it built character backgrounds and developed a well thought out story-line.  And the zombie effects were beautifully horrible.  Better than I've seen in a long time (the exception being the series ""The Walking Dead"").

The zombie makeup is ok, but a BIT much (very white, very THICK) The acting is so-so but the narration is SOOOOO distracting and unnecessary. It is almost as distracting and unnecessary as the incessant soundtrack! There is only one song (the slow banjo one) the hits the proper tone for the movie. The rest just sounds thrown together and distracting. It is almost as if they COULD have done a great job on the soundtrack, but instead they wanted it done in a week so the just did it. The same could be said for the plot. You really want to get behind the story because it does have a whole lot of potential, but it just seems like they are going through the motions and trying to give you a story with the same emotional arc's that you are used to. Nothing will surprise you and nothing will grab your attention and hold it. By the halfway mark you are ready for this to be done ... not because it is terrible, mind you, but because its just not all that interesting. I just hate it when movies like this could be so much more, but they rush you through and give you a bunch of stock tricks. Why are these filmmakers in such a darned hurry anyway? Couldn't they take a few years and just give us a thought out, polished product instead of doing in a year something we've all seen before?

5064096,1,B00795E3ZM,"I rented this movie from Redbox for a dollar and some change. What a waste of money. I don't think I even got to the thirty minute mark. Here's what I remember from the movie. First, the events have already happened. Someone opens up a book or a journal or something and is telling us about some past Civil War Zombie outbreak. Scene one seems to have our hero, the father, fighting in the Civil War and also having to down some Zombies. Another flashback has the man returning to his home. I think the man had to kill his wife who had become a zombie but I can't remember. There are LONG drawn out scenes of the man agonizing the loss of his wife and his missing son. The man goes out looking for his son on a horse. The man stops to get water at a creek and is attacked by a zombie who is hiding underwater. Well, the underwater zombie was pretty scary. Anyway, the man then sees what looks like a young blonde girl, but what, that's his long blonde haired son. So he has to kill the boy with a gun shot to the head. Then he burns the body. The problem I have with this movie is the narrator talking over the movie and the low budget of it all. The movie is a modern take on zombies I guess but it didn't do anything for me. This man is completely destroyed and devastated by what has happened. He shouldn't even be able to function. The zombies should have killed his ass long before. But still this man mopes around the zombie filled countryside on a horse focused only on finding his son. The man is lost in his agony. It seems like the story is over before it began. The movie has a very intense human and emotional impact. On the one hand the movie shows very real human pain. On the other hand the movie is very, very stupid. So the combination of real human pain and stupidity and the narrator just made this movie feel like a steaming pile of horse squeeze. Also, the movie is shot in some unreal lighting. It was just hard to watch this movie in the unreal lighting. To me zombie movies are about trying to survive. You can't be having a long, long, long drawn out emotional breakdown when zombies are afoot. And who needs some ""Wonder Years"" type old man narrator talking over the whole movie. The movie just kept jumping around from the past to the present in weird lighting with a narrator and with bad acting. For me watching this movie, which is very LONG, would have been very painful. Personally I think all you had to know was the company behind the movie. The movie is made by some small low budget outfit called ""Bloody Disgusting"". This company's name should have been a warning to me. I should have known that I was fixing to waste a dollar and some change.

5064101,4,B00795E3ZM,"When it comes to zombie films, there's only the basic scenario to set them apart and sometimes that's where the differences end. And then you have films that try to completely embrace their respective setting, and try to make a good movie in the process. DAWN OF THE DEAD embraced its critique of commercialism as its characters survived in a mall, THE WALKING DEAD embraced its southern setting, tackling racism, religion, etc. EXIT HUMANITY, begins just after the Civil War has come to a close, with a man coming home to find his family taken by the walking dead. Alone and still reeling from the atrocities he experienced during the war, he decided to make one last journey in an attempt to find peace.

EXIT HUMANITY is not tongue-in-cheek and doesn't know the meaning of humor; this is a very dramatic take on a zombie infestation in post-war Tennessee. That in itself might sound a bit silly, but the filmmakers rightly keep the focus on the story, its characters, and the human drama that would emerge from such a situation. It really does take more inspiration from zombie stories of a more ""serious"" tone like THE WALKING DEAD.

But unlike THE WALKING DEAD, EXIT HUMANITY arguably plays things safe. It doesn't fully embrace its setting as much as it should have, perhaps. It makes no mention of slavery, neither is there a strong connection to the war itself. For as serious as this film was attempting to be, it draws a line in a very unlikely place.

All that aside, for an independent zombie film, the production qualities are top notch. The characters are well-acted and easy to care about, the zombie effects are very good, and the locations, costumes and weapons are authentic. The film is also narrated by Brian Cox, who does a fantastic job throughout. (No surprise.) All in all, this is just a tremendous film for the budget that it had, and the filmmakers deserve all kinds of praise for getting the very most out of what they had to work with.

There are many, many zombie movies out there, but I'd argue that this is perhaps one of the best in recent years. It walks the line between being too serious at times (the main character's penchant for screaming in torment nearly a dozen times was a tad off-putting), and not serious enough (ignoring the aftermath of the Civil War in a lot of respects). But regardless, EXIT HUMANITY clearly had a lot of love and talent behind it. If you're a fan of the zombie genre, this will likely be a refreshing change of pace. Personally, I wouldn't mind a sequel.",1343174400,,2522,4.635346756152125

It has a decent plot - it doesn't let low budget get in the way of telling the story. It's a unique Zombie time period setting and hey it even tells you how the zombies came into being without the use of space dust or fitness pills! YAY! :)

5064103,4,B00795E3ZM,This movie is excellent. It felt more like a drama with a zombie backdrop. I became very involved with the characters and felt bad when one would meet their demise. Very good acting as well. I was very drawn into the story. This movie may define a new genera. Drama/Zombie...Drambie....Zomrama maybe? Definitely worth the rental or purchase.,1342915200,,341,5.0

5064105,1,B00795E3ZM,"Why is ""low budget"" an acceptable excuse for a bad movie? ""Enter Nowhere"" was low budget yet a creatively written and well acted movie.

Plot:
All the people on Earth start becoming zombies because a woman, whose sister was hanged for supposedly being a bad person, gets revenge on everyone by saying a few lines from some thousands' year old piece of paper she just happened to find in the southern US state. Story moves at the same pace as the zombies - really slow. Not sure if the story even had a direction or theme. Why do all zombies in movies seem to deteriorate to the same exact physical condition and get no worse? Why do they all walk in the same stilted way? Dumb!

""Exit Humanity"" is suspiciously similar to ""The Dead"" which also starts out with one guy then two and an unlimited amount of ammo for killing an unlimited number of zombies. They all seem to walk out of the woods in areas in which human habitation is near zero meanwhile not a single animal is to be seen. Camera crew must have scared them all away. Even the insects were scared away.

No subtitles for the hearing impaired as well as inconsistent enunciation and audio control. A lot of cheap flip book style line animations interspersed throughout as a substitute for actual movie making. Excessive Hollywood fake hillbilly talk - quickly got tiresome because it was both bad hick speak and stereotyped.
Usual white facial paint; red dyed corn syrup for blood and maybe a facial prosthetic here and there.",1342224000,4,1486,4.6
5064106,5,B00795E3ZM,"I was overly suprised - and just a hint - the little preview clips you can find that make it look like it is a anime insert film, no, bad choice to post --- they are little (very little and few) story transitions for effect.  I am even more impressed , that this was done on a budget -- the acting I felt was real and well done, the music score was outstanding, and the choice of film media and use of color filters made the entire film very rich and much depth for the eyes.  Zombie make ups were also, just wonderful. Was not sure about a period piece zombie film but the move explained it and it was sensible and cohesive - so kudos to the writer(s)....the feeling you get during and after watching it -- is that you just traveled along with a man, that has found Hell come to earth and with it, brought all the demented and diseased souls of the dammned, to possess and wander about, in the bodies of the dead.",1341273600,18,914,4.129213483146067
5064107,4,B00795E3ZM,"Here is the new twist on zombie movies that so many folks seem to be looking for... Zombies in the 19th Century! I can't believe this was a budget movie... I guess that just goes to show that as long as you got a talented and creative group of folks really dedicated to spending time and energy to their project, you don't have to have a gross amount of money support. It's really nice to actually be able to watch a movie where thought and time had been put into writing a script with believable dialogue. Not only was it an interesting story, but this movie had actors that could actually act (though there was a bit of over acting every now and again which seemed to make the movie overly melodramatic) and a prop and make-up department that actually knew what they were doing to pull off a somewhat historically accurate looking period piece with realistic looking walking dead!
On the negative side, the movie was at times a little melodrama! Now don't get me wrong, I can love me some drama, but this movie seemed to exaggerate some of the drama! Maybe I found it melodramatic due to the fact that there occasional bouts of overacting and some of the characters were a bit 2-dimensional and stereo-typical... one major example of this was the rogue Southern General and his molie crew of henchmen.  A lot of the ""early"" story line was rushed and told in flash backs, so I never made a strong connection with the wife and son. And the voice over commentary was to me, a tad over the top and annoying. The animated segments really didn't add much to the movie, it seemed to remove reality and add a dream-like quality to the movie.  However, the animation used to introduce each new chapter was nicely done.  And, just exactly where was the main character suppose to live in Tennessee that he could ride for days without coming upon several farms or villages? Tennessee in the 1870s was not like living in the remote regions of Central America! Chances are, if you lived that remotely in the woods, then you would have probably encountered less than a dozen zombies. I would think the zombies would have wandered to areas that were largely populated, instead of deep into the rural woods. All in all, it's really nice to see a movie where everyone involved put forth 100% of themselves... and created a movie that is much better that a lot of crap that major Hollywood studios have been churning out!",1341187200,2,2404,4.547344110854503
5064108,3,B00795E3ZM,"This was a movie I was really looking forward to actually. The trailers for this were pretty awesome. I feel the movie fell a bit short though. The setting was very grim and dark, which I enjoyed. The two main characters were approachable, and I especially thought Isaac was pretty cool actually. I was hoping for more from Bill Moseley, who is one of my favorite actors, but they really didn't devote enough to his character in my opinion, and his last scene in the movie was especially anti-climactic.
I feel this movie had a lot of strong points, but where the movie really failed was in the pacing. You could easily walk away for twenty minutes, come back, and not really miss anything of any real import.
Some positives, outside of the acting, which was pretty good overall, was the way in which the zombie outbreak was explained. I thought that to have been particularly well thought out.

Anyways, overall I feel this was a middling effort that was good, but failed to live up to its potential. Still, it's worthy of a viewing to be sure.

Enjoy!",1340928000,,1053,4.5661375661375665
5064109,4,B00795E3ZM,"With a tiny budget, there's no way to get top acting talent or whiz-bang CGI effects, and the ""making of"" special feature underscores how shoe-stringy ""Exit"" really was to make.  The low budget shows.  Most of the acting is at best serviceable, and at worst makes the opposite but equally annoying mistakes of being too wooden or too hammy.  Plus, the drawls and accents seemed to slide all over the place.

But those limitations aside, ""Exit"" gets the ""for-free"" stuff mostly right--by which I mean creativity, dedication, enthusiasm, storytelling, originality...the vision part that one either brings to a film or not, and that cannot be bought at any price (I give you ""Battleship,"" a thin but expensive reworking of ""Transformer"" tropes).  For filmmakers who actually care about their creations, this stuff can be gotten for free and elevate zero-budget movies to remarkable entertainments (I give you&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Blair-Witch-Project/dp/B00001QGUM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Blair Witch Project</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pi/dp/078401213X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pi</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Open-Water/dp/B004HY88BI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Open Water</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Primer/dp/B0007N1JC8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Primer</a>). All that's required is a love of film and willingness to go a little gonzo.

""Exit"" goes a little gonzo.

Much of the movie actually is relatively familiar fare, but the setting (postbellum America), the characterizations, the backstories (especially how this zombie plague got rolling in the first place), the use of animation and flashbacks--it all adds up to a unique zombie movie experience. And that counts with me.  I've always loved the zombie sub-genre, and I have been encouraged in recent years to see just how far it can be stretched.  The walking dead have a lot to teach us about bigotry, isolation, consumerism, class warfare, courage, grief, mortality...yeah, the first job of any good zombie movie is to scare you and maybe gross you out, but beyond that, the best ones have something to say.

I'm not sure ExACTLY what ""Exit Humanity"" was trying to say, but the IMPRESSION it left was of a man who, through incalcuable loss, had joined the dead figuratively (and wished to join them literally) and was brought back to vitality through meaningful projects, human relationships, and natural beauty.  I would say that while the movie was too long by 20 percent and could have dropped a subplot or two, tightening up its storyline to good effect, my patience through the pointless or slow parts was rewarded by a few tense scenes, some tasty revenge, and a satisfying conclusion.  Few low-budget sub-genre movies can boast more than that. I can't recommend ""Exit"" in the same breath as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Autumn/dp/B0044BY9N0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Autumn</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Dead/dp/B0078YWU6I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Dead</a>, but at least ""Exit"" ASPIRES.",1340928000,2,3281,6.6223776223776225
5064110,2,B00795E3ZM,"Beginning in Tennessee in 1865, during a battle of the American Civil War, a zombie staggers out of nowhere into the middle of the whole thing! Just one, but enough to enable our story to begin. Six years after the War, our hero Edward Young (Mark Gibson, whose story is told through his found Book of The Dead; and narrated by the always-brilliant Brian Cox as Malcolm Young) comes home to find his wife (Sarah Stunt) a zombie. So, he kills her. But he cannot find his son, Adam (Christian Martyn).

So, after trying to find out what makes a zombie tick, he sets out to find his son. Along the way he encounters many more zombies. Some real and some shown in old school comic book style. Sadly, he quickly discovers that Adam has been bitten and so has to put him out of his misery too. And then soon thereafter his horse is next!

And so Edward then steels himself in keeping a promise to his son when he was alive - in taking him (his son's ashes now) to the waterfalls. Along the way he runs into Isaac, another lost soul, unbitten and headed his way too. Then come a small bunch of Rebels (who are trying to find their own cure), and a ""witch"" named Eve - who turns out to be nothing of the sort!

Come the finale, Rebels kill innocents, innocents kill Rebels, zombies keep eating whoever gets in their way, and closure is brought to the whole mess. A mess, as it turns out, that is also revealed as to why it came about in the first place! In truth, the animation and narration make this film waaaaay better than it ever should be!

5064111,2,B00795E3ZM,"the net has opened up a whole new world for young independent artists and giving lots of people room to breath away from the big movie and tv control freaks. I have seen 4 of the 5 that i found, and this was the worst, bad period props...they had two good veterans (actor-the evil sociopathic dr. and actress-played the backwoods healer)who did as best they could with the script and helped the new kids when they shared a scene.
  keep writin kid just don't let em give you the bum's rush and take a minite to consider the times you are shooting for...you'll get there.
  of the other three that i saw on netflix; there were some very good parts if a little spotty sometimes. the voice over was awful. some of the art was very well done and the makeup wasn't bad on the live ones.
  they did stupid things that will glare out at any who know much about the civil war era or even what it was really like to live back then.  the pistols were so shiny silver (like the toys given children in the 50's) any woodsman or fighting man of any kind would have seen the glint good enough to kill you before you knew you were dead.  and it's just plain stupid the way they sometimes pointed thier guns at each other (while making all sorts of noise talking and emoting for thier portfolio clips...}and not fighting. You NEVER point a gun at someone, loaded or not unless you are going to use it. boys back then learned to shoot almost as soon as they could hold a weapon and their daddys would have taken it away and knocked the kid flat,there was no room for carelessness.
  I suppose my main b*tch is that children watch a lot of tv a lot like horror and scifi; if there are guns; gun handling NEEDS to be accurate.
  the costumes were down right wrong in some cases. the so called southern soldier had no southern accent nor did any of his sothern friends. they should have made him a northener at least. none of the cookware was darkened by flame and hard use, and no frontier settler would ever just drop a torch in the tall dead grass and run off. their neighbors would have linched them. all these things kept popin me back out of the story.
  At least they found a sturdy horse like the farmers prized.
  the lead did give a credible battle cry when he rallied his troops
  dispite all of that they did give it a try and I doubt may of the actors have been off a college or comunity stage before...and i believe this movie company will be a power some day if they can tough it out. It looks like several small groups around the same flag. It is good to see some of the veteran old guard lending thier help. they certainly didn't get paid.",1340668800,,2636,4.248496993987976
5064112,1,B00795E3ZM,"Exit Humanity is slow as zombies stuck in molasses.  It's kind of an endless loop of the same tone, same scenes, same subpar zombies lumbering towards the protagonist who repeatedly falls on his knees and howls at the sky.  The movie is also punctuated by animated sequences that only serve to further muddy an already muddled movie  There casting/act is weak - as are the sad-sack zombies.  It's neither scary, nor interesting/poetic.  Unless you're in the mood to be very patient and not tremendously entertained, I would suggest you pass.",1340582400,2,541,4.966666666666667

I was more than pleasantly surprised by what this movie is - a well-crafted script, good acting, excellent narration by the wonderful Brian Cox.  The zombies are well done (and the filmmakers brilliantly used creepy animation to avoid casting hundreds of extras as zombies and having to do make up for so many people in various scenes - the animated vignettes are infrequent enough to add to the ambiance and not scuttle the overall effect), the costuming and sets and scenery are aces.

If you don't like zombie movies, you probably still won't like this - it is still a zombie movie, but it is one that has an excellent backstory, there are levels to the story and most people should get some enjoyment out of it.  It is a small budget production, so the people complaining about the production values are just being asinine.

5064115,5,B00795E3ZM,"This excellent movie is an intellectual examination of a scourge where there is little hope of recovery especially as set in a time of postwar despair.  The unhurried pacing and exemplary editing of the movie lends time for the zombie survivors to fully develop their characters to realistically portray that death is nothing when compared to the loss of all those things that make one human.  The score is brilliant.  Most impressive are the diary entries that narrate particular incidents, which are blended with animated drawings of the events without excessive detail or explanation.  I felt this movie really allowed me to imagine what was happening in each situation rather than having it forced upon me.  I thoroughly enjoyed this moving tale of the dead simply walking around rather than continually springing out at the characters for the cheap scares that usually plague the higher budgeted films of this genre.",1340496000,,921,5.113333333333333
