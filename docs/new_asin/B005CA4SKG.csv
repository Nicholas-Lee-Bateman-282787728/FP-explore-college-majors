4652199,4,B005CA4SKG,"I appreciate a good werewolf movie. In the past decade there has been none. I'd like to make my review based on other reviews I've seen here.

1) The werewolf look was aesthetically acceptable.
  Compare it to the last dumb Hollywood werewolf movies
  -The CG on some werewolf movies looked like a cartoon,
  --Like in the movie ""Cursed"", that was a stupid movie.
  --I hate CG, and was glad to see it not used so much
  -Some movies cut out the werewolf from being seen at all for suspense
  --but it's just lack of courage or creativity to portray the- -  werewolf
  -some show normal animal wolves, some prefer this I prefer the
  ---horror sci version of it.
  ---I don't watch movies to be realistic.
  The werewolf was like the ones in the other Howlings mostly and not unlike
  -werewolf in the TV show Werewolf
2) The story is different from the older original versions
  Though it isn't an original take in horror it isn't a rip off the first
3) The werewolf's don't sparkle.

I will add I don't like the teeny aspect to it, and the tired old coming of age crap I don't watch a horror movie for.
If you've seen the last sequel in the Howling series ""New Moon Rising"", this is a well produced film. I feel it deserves better credit than it has received here on Amazon.

It's not the greatest movie, but don't let a nerdy hatters review sway you from watching it.
As far as werewolf movies, I've seen much much worse.",1318204800,14,1424,4.373076923076923

4652212,3,B005CA4SKG,"Not your typical werewolf flick. The style the movie played out in was a little strange at times also. Despite that, the story did very well with the protagonist and charactor development. The strong female lead was hot and keeps you on your toes. The climax of the story was amusing. The small amount of humor was very B grade. It will certainly entertain you your first watch through.",1463270400,,386,4.608695652173913

4652214,4,B005CA4SKG,"This is a powerful coming of age movie, Werewolf stile.

The main characters are Will and  Eliana .  Eliana was afraid of letting anyone in.  Will was afraid of letting himself out.  She couldn't see herself as the treasure he saw her as.  He didn't see himself as worthy of her.

Will was born a Werewolf, his dad had been suppressing that. The wolf started awakening near their graduation.

 A pack of wolves sought to recruit Will.  He refused because they also tried to kill Eliana.  Will reveals himself to Eliana and they battle the wolves - with silver and fire.  Then Will turns her.  Together they destroy the pack's leader.",1451865600,,633,4.594594594594595

4652265,3,B005CA4SKG,"Perhaps 3 1/2 stars would be better.  I actually enjoyed the movie.  It seems though that while they call The Howling series a franchise, all they usually have in common is that they have a werewolf in them - or a pack of them.  So I try to review them each on their own merit and disregard Howling in the title.  I knew this was a low budget film going in and slapped my forehead when the hero looked like Harry Potter.
But to my surprise it was well done, decent acting, decent special effects and it's own plot.  Yes, it does appear geared toward the young adult crowd, but had adequate action and suspense to keep you involved.  A young man getting ready to graduate from high school finds that he is becoming a werewolf as the next full blue moon is arriving.  Enter then his mother, who he thought was dead, as a ""alpha"" wolf wanting to take him into her pack.  Add a teen romance to the mix and -- you get the point.",1408492800,,923,4.175141242937853

4652268,2,B005CA4SKG,"This is from the viewpoint of someone who's never seen any previous ""Howling"" incarnation.

Written and directed by big screen newcomer Joe Nimziki, THE HOWLING: REBORN (2011) is an exercise in Oedipal lycanthropy that's geared to a specific audience: high schoolers. The story unfolds during the main character's last days as a senior classman; its darkly dramatic climax occurs simultaneous to a rain-soaked outdoor nighttime graduation ceremony.

The film touches all the clich&eacute;d bases of modern youth-oriented cinema. There's major destruction of property, several sexual encounters (including an unfulfilled come-on to the boy from his wolfpack leader mom), lots of expletive-laced dialogue, overly loud music and much mayhem, all filmed with often shaky handheld cameras. (Let's not forget the numerous misshapen wolfie predators!)

As an outside observer, I can see how this might appeal to the latest generation of horror movie fans, but I found it a chore to watch and not believably scary.",1373587200,2,1006,5.51948051948052
4652269,3,B005CA4SKG,"Dont' feed into the negative reviews so much. It's not so bad. There is elements that you will like in the movie.

It is not very scary, but the storyline is fun and exciting. Lindsay Shaws character brings some hot and steamy, not too steamy scenes into the show. The werewolves don't get really action packed until the last little bit of the show, but the rest leads you towards the end in a fun way!",1369008000,,409,4.256410256410256

4652284,3,B005CA4SKG,"For anyone wondering what the 1980's classic THE HOWLING would look like if it were made for the TWILIGHT generation, you now have your answer. Tweens everywhere will have a new werewolf film to add to their collection in THE HOWLING REBORN, the eighth entry into the series and the newest sequel following the disastrous NEW MOON RISING from 1995. Life is difficult enough for Will Kidman between finishing his math homework and fending off high school bullies, but things become even hairier when he learns that he is the last in the bloodline of a powerful pack of werewolves. Now, he must choose to fight his killer instinct to protect the girl he loves or embrace his inner beast to run with the pack! While it is far from perfect, THE HOWLING REBORN is sure to become a guilty pleasure amongst werewolf fans after it ramps up the teen drama with a surprising amount of violence and sexuality. Joe Nimziki's script is riddled with plot holes and goofy dialog, but he maintains a steady stream of action that includes some of the best creature effects since the original. This teen-edgy reboot is surprisingly one of the better films in the series, and it will likely spawn several sequels of its own.

4652285,1,B005CA4SKG,"Just when I thought the world was done with sparkly vampires I stumbled across this: another teeny bopper high school relationship movie masquerading as a horror.  SKIP IT!

I wouldn't call it a remake.  This contemporized franchise reboot chronicles the ""coming of adulthood"" of high school senior Will (Landon Liboiron).  Will has a thing for Eliana (Lindsey Shaw), one of his classmates that refers to her clique as a ""pack.""  Much to his surprise, she invites him to party where he is drugged, shares some time with Eliana and thinks he sees a werewolf.

After the ""attack"" Will turns to his best friend and horror trivia expert to learn about werewolves.  Meanwhile Will notices that he doesn't seem to need his prescription glasses anymore (like in Wolf), he's stronger and more assertive, his wounds heal before his eyes and he spends more time with Eliana.  Their relationship is really coming along.  This flick focuses more on the emotions, self-discovery  and Will's relationship with Eliana than werewolves.  Speaking as a 30-something adult, this movie is pretty lame.

Kay (Ivana Milicevic) is the mother of a fellow student. She puts the moves on Will's dad and shifts from kind-hearted and mild-mannered to sultry.  But there's something special about Kay.  She has a special interest in Will and she knows something special about him--whereas there is nothing special about this movie.

Lots of people die; we don't see it happen.  There are lots of werewolves; we don't see them.  I mean, we get a glimpse and the costume/make-up were okay despite their long ugly rat tails.  But the werewolf screen time was very little until the last 20 minutes.

Transformation is much easier nowadays with CGI.  Spinal vertebrae pulsate before pushing out the skin.  But after the first transformation they were reduced to hideously simplified instantaneous CGI morphs without stages, pain, etc.  This flick, while awful, keeps in line with franchise tradition and includes a mid-coitus transformation scene.  With the exception of Howling II: Your Sister is a Werewolf (1985), these sex scenes always include a female werewolf and a regular guy who's in for a big surprise.

The only thing this movie does well is reinforce the admonishing trend that the newer a ""Howling"" movie is the less advisable it is to watch.",1358640000,2,2322,5.034120734908137

4652287,2,B005CA4SKG,"I gave this movie a shot based on my love of the original and a well edited trailer. It was a complete let down on every level except one. The effects were horrible by todays standards. In fact the effects in this movie are atrocious by the standard of the original film. The story has no depth to it and the pacing is so bad you wonder if the editor had somewhere he really wanted to get to the day he edited this. (If it took the editor more than one day, it was because he was distracted)

The cinematography was bad. Any good DP can help create a sense of suspense just based on the visual presentation. This had none.

The only redeeming element, barely, was the acting of the two lead characters. And they look even better because they're surrounded by people who aren't even trying to act.

It's so obvious that the studio was simply trading on the name and wanted to spend as little money as they could get away with while doing it.

Not only is this not worthy of the Howling name, its just a bad movie all around.",1353024000,2,1023,4.230769230769231
4652288,1,B005CA4SKG,"I usually rent a movie before purchasing but I bought this movie soley because I remember how much I liked the werewolves in the original. I figured with todays fx capabilities it would be even better, boy was I wrong. I wish I hadn't purchased it, I didn't even finish watching it. I wanted cool looking special fx on my 50 inch HDTV and if the story was good then that would be a bonus. What I got was a halfassed Twilight knockoff with shamefull low budget effects, what little fx there was. The acting wasn't that bad but when a werewolf attacks someone you expect to see the wolf and you simply did not. After they cut away a few times its like WTF. The whole thing was a ripoff. Thank god it was only about 8 bucks. Some people may like it but I suggest a red box rental for a buck and a half.",1351468800,,799,4.095541401273885
4652289,4,B005CA4SKG,"Obviously, this was meant to be a reboot of the eighties movie series to spring board additional sequels in the twenty-teens. Who knows whether that will happen or not? Since everyone seems to be perceiving this as a Twilight knock off. This twi-hater bandwagon is so aggressive that anything resembling it, no matter how remote, is guilty by association. Since in this era, how you feel about a mere work of fiction, is a valid way to judge and condemn someone. Why is that? Perhaps the main character of Will Kidman offers some insight into that when he says. ""My generation, we're not about commitments and relationships, we're about hooking up. It's like somewhere along the way we were lead to believe that knowing too much about a partner makes love less exciting. We were led to believe wrong."" I guess people object to the implication that emotional intimacy has anything to do with the physical act of sex. As for the movie itself, it's trying to capture the essence of the original movie, which was far more sophisticated than the mindless B-Grade schlock of the first six sequels. Which is what I appreciate about this movie, but what I appreciate is obviously a complete waste on most present day horror fans based upon other reviews. Still, you can sense there is a lot more story between the scenes that we do not see on screen. I really would have liked to have seen what a bit more development could have done for this movie. Then again, maybe they were waiting to deal with those unanswered questions in future sequels. They obviously set it up for one. I got to say one last thing, Lindsey Shaw and Ivana Milicevic, are way sexy. It is what got me to watch the film three times, and eventually see the film for what it is. Rather than just labeling it as just another schlock sequel.",1350172800,,1801,4.596273291925466
4652290,1,B005CA4SKG,"Okay-lets get something out of the way first. I was fortunate enough to see 'The Howling' (directed by the masterful Joe Dante and with FX by Rick Baker protege Rob Bottin) in theaters upon it's release (I'm 44), and it was an experience this horror fan has NEVER forgotten. 'The Howling Reborn' is a viewing travesty I WISH I could forget!!! I have been nauseated ever since the author of the 'Twi-LITE' series single-handedly tried to destroy vampire and werewolf lore...thankfully films like '30 Days of Night', and the 'Underworld' series have been on hand to remind us just how wicked lycanthropy and vampirism can be! I was praying that 'The Howling Reborn' would do the same. Imagine my HORROR when I saw this was to be another film about teeny boppers in High School!!! GAAAAKKKK!!! The story is totally assinine, the acting horrible (especially by the over-acting 'werewolf momma'), and chock full 'o' teen wolf-boys without T-shirts ala 'Twi-lite'!!! I DID NOT purchase this film (thank GOD)-I watched it on Netflix...and was tempted to fast forward through the entire film. But my gf wanted to watch it-so THAT should tell you alot (lol)! Be WARNED-you DO NOT even get to see a FULL WEREWOLF until the last 18 minutes of this movie!!! And they have HAIRLESS BODIES so you can admire the teen-boy muscles! GAAAAK AGAIN!!!I kid you NOT. This film is an exercise in what NOT to do when you try and redux a CLASSIC. A note to the director-you have FAILED miserably Sir.  If your longing for the glory days of lycanthropy, watch Universals 'Werewolf Of London', 'The Wolfman', any Paul Naschy 'Wolfman' flick, the original 'Howling', 'An American werewolf In London', or even the SUPERB newer werewolf films 'Ginger Snaps 1,2, and 3'...stay FAR away from this utter piece of steaming wolf poo!

I guess for now we will have to settle for underworld, though I did think the wolfman remake was.a hell of a movie.

4652293,2,B005CA4SKG,"I guess when you get to a certain number of sequels you have to omit the number and add something new...like reborn. As a fan of the original THE HOWLING, I was always disappointed in the sequels. While the original had a limited budget, it was filled with something original, a new take on the whole werewolf story. But the rest lacked even the small budget of the first and the only thing worthwhile in any was the laugh inducing marsupial werewolf in the third one. Or would that be were-kangaroo?

Well it's been a few years and the series died down a bit. Chances are the newest group of horror film lovers aren't old enough to remember the original or haven't seen it. So it was time to dust off the old and make it new. Or at least give it a shot.

Will Kidman is a troubled teen. He's about to graduate and has the hots for the new girl in school, Eliana, who also happens to be dating the school tough guy. Which isn't a good thing for will since he's the designated school geek. But opposites attract and sparks fly between them.

When they meet at a secretive party together, weird things begin to happen. Like Will noticing several new kids from the school hanging around in a sort of...pack? When it seems he's been drugged, Will ends up seeing all sorts of things.

As the days progress Will senses something else is different. He never had the chance to know his mother, an artist we saw killed while she was pregnant with him during the films opening sequence. But some link between his mother and what's going on with him now will turn up and explain why he's changing. You got it, somewhere along the line Will has werewolf blood in his veins.

Will's attraction to Eliana grows and with it the viewer begins to wonder if she isn't tied into the whole thing. Could it be that she's the member of a clan of werewolves sent to recruit Will? Or perhaps it was her group that saw to the demise of Will's mother? Only time will tell.

This movie is perhaps not the worst film in this series but it works at it. It offers few scares and fewer fresh and original scenes than most. And the werewolf costumes seem like costumes. I'm not quite certain yet if that's the fault of the make up man at work here or the cinematographer who allowed them to appear like suits. In any event it ruins the effect of a real live werewolf captured on screen.

The story is weak and rarely finds a reason for the viewer to care about anyone from the hero to the villain. Instead we get the usual back story and a twist that seems unoriginal. I'll say it again, while this isn't the worst of the series or the worst werewolf movie, it does leave you wanting to watch one that is done better like perhaps the first in the series. But if the rest of the series have been checked out when you go looking and this is left? It might be worth giving it a look.",1332201600,,2848,4.282527881040892
4652294,4,B005CA4SKG,"I enjoyed this movie a lot.  I didn't have high hopes, so I was pleasantly surprised.  It successfully distills the essentials of the werewolf genre down into something that is both modern and fun to watch.  There's humor, there's action, there's eye candy, there's drama, there are humanoid wolf-creatures [not large-dog CGIs], there's blood, there's heroism, there's tragedy...  It's got lots of good stuff in it.  And while not related to the original film, there are plenty of nods to it -- enough that I would have thought a fan of the original to be satisfied.

Fun, simple story with lots of memorable dialogue and wit.  And werewolves.

Concessions: yes, there are problems.  The lead does look way too much like Harry Potter in his costume, the high-school monster thing does invite Twilight comparisons [shudder], the soundtrack occassionally gets in the way, and the gun scene makes no sense.

And I didn't care.  There SO much other good stuff that these issues don't impact the overall whole.  Good movie.",1324339200,3,1018,4.958579881656805

4652297,5,B005CA4SKG,"Ignore the unintelligent reviews of this movie that so many youngsters have posted online.  This is an excellent werewolf movie, one of the best low-budget werewolf movies ever made (and, often, it doesn't even seem low-budget.)

The writing (screenplay) is outstanding, with a great, original story line that has many surprises.  And, so many of the lines in this movie are both memorable and quotable because they are so well-crafted.  It is extremely appropriate that there is a prominently displayed bust of Shakespeare in one scene, along with a quote by Hemmingway on a chalkboard, because the writing in this film is near or on the same level as these and other great writers.

No, this movie doesn't have anything to do with the original Howling movies or novels (but then again, neither do several other of the many movies in the Howling franchise.  And, even the first Howling movie doesn't have anything at all to do with the original Howling novel.)  However, this is an excellent werewolf movie.  One of the best.

The movie's only weaknesses:  (1) The actor who plays the bully-nemesis in this movie does appear somewhat effeminate, as inarticulately expressed by so many other reviewers here.  Part of the issue is with the fact that he this actor has a slight, unmenacing (French Canadian?) foreign accent.  Fortunately, this character's role is rather small, and it is easy for most of us to mentally subtitute a more menacing actor in his place, based upon his lines and the story line.  (2) Pop songs are sometimes used in the soundtrack of this movie--always a bad idea.  This instantly dates the movie, and song lyrics sometimes get in the way of the dialogue.  Unobtrusive and more effective instrumental music is always the better choice for film music  (3) The coming of age story line seems like it is going to be  a turn- off at first (especially since the high school students in this film all seem to be around 30 years old, and yes the lead character in this movie does wear Harry Potter glasses--not the best choice in eye-wear), however it becomes apparent that is all essential to the original story that this movie tells.

The werewolf effects are really good.  Mostly suits and makeup are used for the werewolves (thankfully), mixed with a little bit of some tastefully and effectively used computer-generated animation (that doesn't even look like animation--well done.)

If half-star ratings were allowed, I would actually give this movie a rating of 4 and 1/2 stars, with a half of a star taken off for the very minor weaknesses of this movie that I mentioned above.  I would highly recommend this film to werewolf movie fans and classic monster movie fans.  Buy it or rent today:  You'll be glad that you did.",1322179200,3,2747,4.822649572649572
4652298,1,B005CA4SKG,90% of this movie was about two teenagers falling in love. They don't even show any werewolves for the first hour. And thereis little to no gore. Most of the other Howling films were good/cheesy horror flicks but this was just a retarded love story made by some douche who was trying to make money off the Twilight fan base.,1322179200,6,324,4.416666666666667
4652299,4,B005CA4SKG,"Let's be honest with one another, I wasn't expecting much at all out of this reboot. Like many others that have come before it, I figured it'd be a boring retread of something I'd seen before. Except for the very first movie, every last Howling movie reeked. Thankfully, The Howling Reborn turned out to be a pretty decent movie despite its' apparent low-budget.

The story centers around Will Kidman(your average everyday kid) whose infatutation with a gorgeous classmate starts to trigger animal instincts. When a mysterious woman with a deep secret re-enters his life, he learns that he is heir(the alpha-male as it were) to a powerful line of werewolves. It's then that he is faced with making a choice..either turning against his own or giving into his primal instincts. Take one wild guess what choice he makes. You'd be surprised.

I believe that, given the right budget, this could've been a more powerful reboot of the franchise. The story was there and the acting was solid. It had a killer soundtrack. There was certainly believable chemistry there with the cast. Not only that but the movie is totally unrelated to the previous films in the series. To me, that's definitely a plus.

Despite what other reviewers out there are saying about the movie, don't believe everything you read. As I said before, it's a pretty decent movie and is a good alternative to other teenage drivel out there(again, even though it has a low-budget). It'd be cool if this story continued. Course, considering it is a direct-to-DVD movie, I don't see it happening.

Give this one a chance, you might end up liking it. I know I did.",1321833600,3,1622,4.802867383512544
4652310,1,B005CA4SKG,"Not an epic failure, but boring. I expected a 2011 movie to be worthy of watching, this movie was not  worthy of my time. It had good special effects compare to B movies. However there were times when you could see how cheap it was. In example when school was burning, the fire looked so bad. The werewolf costume looked so cheap actually, especially the legs. When 2 werewolves collapsed, you could well see that there is no life captured in those costumes. There was either one of actors present or none at all. Not until the next scene. I don't think there is really any point in writing more about the movie itself, it was so boring to watch. Not an epic failure, but it's bad. I would NOT consider it to be another Howling movie. Yes, howling is notorious for a few good and most bad movies mixed together in one huge sequel/collection. But why this movie? It's out of place. There is nothing about rebirth and nothing about howling at all. Could give it another name.",1321228800,4,973,4.435754189944134
4652311,2,B005CA4SKG,"The movie starts off decent enough. Pregnant woman gets attacked and dies.  Flashforward to the previously unborn child getting ready to graduate. Boy likes mysterious tough girl.  Girl's boyfriend doesn't like anyone checking out his girl.

Eventually, at a party, boy takes a pill that kind of changes things for him.  Eventually boy thinks he may be a werewolf.  Yeah, and we think so, too.

As said before, there's a lot of teen angst.  It's kind of like they were shooting for a mix of Twilight, Spider-man, and Harry Potter. Maybe a smidge of Teen Wolf due to the whole hitting puberty and now becoming a werewolf thing.

Plot spoiler coming up (but can there really be a spoiler with a movie this bad?): there are lots of plot holes in this film, but the biggest is that there is a werewolf conspiracy, whereby a bunch of innocent people are going to be changing into werewolves at the next full moon.  And the person who has devised this devious plot to take over the world wants Will to come into the fold.

The thing is, this person could have taken Will with them when he was a baby.  Or at any time thereafter.  Why watch the kid and wait 18 yrs to try and convince him to be evil?  Why not just take him at the beginning and raise him evil? Of course there would have been a different movie, but that would have been the logical thing to do!

For that matter, why did this Alpha wolf conspirator wait 18 yrs before putting their plan of world domination into action?

Other plot holes: Dad seems to know the kid's a werewolf. He's been giving him pills with silver nitrate, presumably to supress the beast he knew was lurking there. How did he know this?

Later, three werewolves are searching the school for you and what is the most sensible thing you can think to do? Make out with the lead girl a little.

Shortly after this, Will is able to devise a couple of blow torches in like 20 seconds flat.  He is also technologically savy--so much so that he's able to restart the lead girl's heart with a power cable from inside an elevator.

As said before, there is an odd degree of maximum security going on at this school, and yet gunshots, blood, and other goings-on go un-noticed. A gun is easily smuggled into the school, so no metal detectors.  And yet there are those crazy fold-down security coverings that can come down over the doors and windows at the push of a button. I guess they must be expecting terrorists to attack, but again, this level of security is tighter than most government buildings.  Why?  Because they needed this to lock in all the characters for the finale.

And why do all the graduates and school staff not seem to care or notice that the school is locked down during their ceremony, which is being held outside at night during the rain? Heck, why is the ceremony being held outside at all if it's raining rather than the auditorium?

And despite the degree of security, a wild free-for-all party is able to be held in the basement. Maybe it was okayed by the school.  I'm not completely certain, but it does seem to not mesh with school philosophy.

Are the people in the basement, which are waiting to become werewolves students? If they are, then it's strange such a large number of people weren't missed at graduation.  Again, maybe they weren't students.  So much is unclear I really don't know.

All this may sound nit-picky on the plot, but my gosh, what is a movie if it doesn't have a plot that makes sense, with characters who do logical things and react the way real people would?  You have to buy into a story before you can like it.

The acting was so-so.  The over-the-top villain was pretty cliche. The effects were all right.  I actually did like the look of the werewolves except for the skinny rat-like tails.

I only give this movie 2 stars. It seemed they made an effort at the beginning, but then it seemed the writer got tired halfway through. There were a lot of missed opportunities here.",1320537600,4,3957,4.472803347280335
4652312,1,B005CA4SKG,"I was very very disappointed by this installment for many reasons. The special effects were good, not overdone. However.... the plot was actually a good one, they just lost it somehow.
The actual connection to the original howling I cannot see, except that it was based on the second book in the series and they didn't really explain in the movie how they were connected. Maybe just the title?
The original Howling had the tension, acting, scant but effective special effects, great plot, a sense of paranoia and a sense of a horrible discovery along with some really good acting. The only good acting in this one is the mother. Part played well.
There wasn't the sense of tension here, just a rolling ball of a plot. They could have easily played on the fact that 'they are all around us', but they didn't.
Not recommended at all. The original is still the best, skip all the other howling movies.",1320451200,11,898,4.61875
4652313,2,B005CA4SKG,"And some good voiceover work from the main actor, a young man in high school.  The rest of it is a long, dull slog that could have been better had the script actually been  coherent.",1320278400,3,182,4.171428571428572
4652314,3,B005CA4SKG,"I thought this movie was very PG-13 in my opinion. The Twilight version of werewolves which I felt was unnecessary. The quality is alot better than the other howling movies that's for sure. And Howling New moon Rising looked like a film student project which was the last one before this. The only other ones really worth watching are parts 1 and 2 but they are terribly outdated. So I have to be very fair in this review, yes this is a revelation in the series. It did resurrect the cinematography and quality of the series. But is this a great movie ?  Its just ok in my opinion. The Werewolf transformation could have been alot better for sure. Especially with today's technology and special fx artist. If you look at the very first film the transformation was better than the new one. And that was 20 years ago so that's pretty pathetic. These werewolves just morphed into a wolf in like 30 seconds ? Also the girl character was useless they built mystery around her when it wasn't necessary. I mean if you just want to be entertained its a decent film for sure. But don't expect realistic violence or gore.",1319846400,3,1111,4.5
4652315,2,B005CA4SKG,"Bad movies are an acquired taste.  The only thing that makes a bad movie unwatchable is one that takes itself seriously.  Naturally, if you're trying to paint Godzilla as citizen kane you're going to wind up with a bad b-movie because it's not going to be enjoyable to watch.  Most b-directors get this and the results are often hilarious such as the crow scene in alien vs. ninja.

This movie, however, has no such aspirations for schlockitude.  It's like twilight with werewolves (actors in suits) and most of the movie makes no sense like the kid that just happens to bring a gun to school and has hollow point bullets.  This is what happens when the screenwriter reverse writes a plot element into the story for later use.  This ordinarily isn't a problem for a movie that doesn't take itself seriously but when your movie is written to be serious then this stuff is just lazy, unfunny, and uninspired.  Viewers should only suspend their disbelief when the writing gives them a reason to; doesn't happen here.

It's shot fairly well though.  Maybe a rental if you can stomach these kinds of movie.",1319760000,3,1101,4.6875
4652316,2,B005CA4SKG,"This film takes the usual `teen angst' to a whole new level.  Unfortunately, that level is bargain basement.
I knew I was in trouble when the lead actor (Landon Liboiron) showed up looking suspiciously like Harry Potter....lost in a Twilight film!
The plot has absolutely nothing to do with any of the previous Howling films, suggesting that the title was slapped on simply to cash in on their reputation as a brand.  In this film, the plot revolves around a boy's acceptance of who/what he is and how he deals with that knowledge once he learns of his true nature as an instant werewolf (apparently, it pops up with puberty?).  Oh yeah, there's also a plot to overthrow the world.
Worst aspect of this film, the never ending drone of a narration by Landon Liboriron, I stopped listening after awhile, my mind began to wander.  I can only handle just so much whining.
As a whole, this film is inconsistent in tone and direction; characters were constantly in flux, changing personalities in the blink of an eye and for no apparent reason.  There was just nothing new here, nothing to advance the mythology of werewolves.  It was very clunky.  The story bumped along in spurts and stalls, taking forever to get to the point and when it finally arrived at the BIG reveal......eh, and so what.

At least the ending was funny.

But not worth the effort to sit through it again: not a keeper.",1319760000,2,1387,4.628571428571429
4652317,5,B005CA4SKG,i can not believe the negative reviews people give this film. It is a shame that people have to rip apart ever single film that is made. granted thier is some minor plot holes but it can be overlooked. This film starts with will's mother attacked by a werewolf while he is still in his mother's womb. jump 18 years later will starts finding out that he can heal fast and is stonger then a normal human. His mother then comes for him and trys to get him to come with the pack. The one thing i do not understand about this movie is why his mother wants him back. The impression that i got was that in the film his mother seems to be very jealous of his girlfriend and when she finally turns on him she tells him that she should have aborted him he then replies why because your boy likes he girlfriend better then mommy. This then sends her in a rage and starts to knock will around until will transforms into a werewolf himself and the two fight it out. All in all this film i think is well directed and the actors do a fine job. one other thing that I would like to add is that when people watch an independent film or a film that is not backed by a major movie studio or disney you have to understand that they do the best they can with what they have to work with. Because i will say this much i have seen some great films that were not backed by major movie studios or disney that can put a lot of big budget films to shame and this film is one of them,1319068800,5,1455,4.0034364261168385
4652318,2,B005CA4SKG,"This is from the viewpoint of someone who's never seen any previous ""Howling"" incarnation.

Written and directed by big screen newcomer Joe Nimziki, THE HOWLING: REBORN (2011) is an exercise in Oedipal lycanthropy that's geared to a specific audience: high schoolers. The story unfolds during the main character's last days as a senior classman; its darkly dramatic climax occurs simultaneous to a rain-soaked outdoor nighttime graduation ceremony.

The film touches all the clichd bases of modern youth-oriented cinema. There's major destruction of property, several sexual encounters (including an unfulfilled come-on to the boy from his wolfpack leader mom), lots of expletive-laced dialogue, overly loud music and much mayhem, all filmed with often shaky handheld cameras. (Let's not forget the numerous misshapen wolfie predators!)

As an outside observer, I can see how this might appeal to the latest generation of horror movie fans, but I found it a chore to watch and not believably scary.",1318982400,5,998,5.467532467532467
