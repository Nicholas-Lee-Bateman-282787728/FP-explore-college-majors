8762615,5,B01G9CFQTC,"If you haven't discovered Lee Tracy, you've missed one of Hollywood's great comedic actors.

I'm a lifelong journalist and naturally have a love of stories and films about the news business. Tracy often played roles as the fast-talking guy somewhere in the circle of people connected with the news. I had already seen several Tracy classics when I ordered this collection from the Warner Brothers Archives. In fact, I enjoyed those others so much that I purchased them individually on DVDs.

If you've never experienced Tracy's hyper-active characters, this set is a terrific introduction to his body of work. You'll probably find yourself looking for more. Enjoy!",1474070400,17,664,5.196261682242991
