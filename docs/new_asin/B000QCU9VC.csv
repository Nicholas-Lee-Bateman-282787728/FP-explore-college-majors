In this third feature - ""WESTERN CYCLONE"" (Released: 14 May 1943) (62 mins/B&W), story line and plot has Glenn Strange trying to get the Governor (Karl Hackett) impeached so he can take over control of the state --- Knowing the Governor and Billy (Buster Crabbe) are good friends, he has Billy framed for murder.

In fact author Bobby J. Copeland's latest book is titled ""Charlie King - We called him ""Blackie"", comprehensive in depth behind the scenes of the baddest of the badmen. We saw him through the eyes of such heroes as Buster Crabbe, Johnny Mack Brown, Buck Jones, Ken Maynard, Dave O'Brien, Tex Ritter and Bob Steele.

His good looks and powerful physique saw him portrayed on Wheaties cereal boxes and in 1927, brought an offer for motion picture screen tests that resulted in a long and successful career in Hollywood --- He appeared in minor roles until 1930 when he was cast as the star in a western movie entitled ""Billy the Kid"" and directed by King Vidor, the film also features Wallace Beery as Pat Garrett.

Brown went on to make several top-flight movies under the name John Mack Brown, including The Secret Six (1931) with Wallace Beery, as well as the legendary Lost Generation celebration of alcohol, ""The Last Flight"" (1931), and was being groomed by MGM as a leading man until being replaced on a film in 1931, with all his scenes reshot with Clark Gable in his place --- Rechristened Johnny Mack Brown, ""Fighting Kit Carson"" (1933) he returned to making exclusively westerns and eventually became one of the screen's top B-movie cowboy stars, making 127 western films during his career, including ""Ride 'Em Cowboy"" (1942) with Abbott and Costello --- Brown also starred in four serials for Universal Studios (Rustlers of Red Dog (1935), Wild West Days (1937), Flaming Frontiers (1938) and The Oregon Trail (1939) and was a hero to millions of young children at movie theaters and on their television screens --- Altogether, Brown appeared in over 160 movies between 1927 and 1966, as well as a smattering of television shows, in a career spanning almost forty years --- In recognition of his contribution to the motion picture industry, Brown was given a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6101 Hollywood Blvd --- In 1969, Brown was inducted into the Alabama Sports Hall of Fame.(From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia)
.
The first of four Johnny Mack Brown westerns - ""THE CROOKED TRAIL"" (Released: 25 July 1936) (60 mins/B&W) --- story line and plot, Jim Blake (Johnny Mack Brown) happens upon Harve Tarlton (John Merton) who is left dying in the desert --- Blake saves Tarltons life, and makes him a partner in a gold mining claim, but soon Tarlton's back to his fugitive ways --- in John Merton's role in this oater, only time I've ever seen him smile, as though he was having a good time.

Second feature - ""BOOT HILL BRIGADE"" (Released: 2 August 1937) (56 mins/B&W), Johnny saves the people from the dirty rotten land grabbers --- Johnny Mack is a moral preaching cowboy who uses his wits and fists rather than six-guns to battle a land-grabbing villain who is exploiting homesteaders --- not as much in the action department, but an underlying conflict that has been throughout the growing of the West --- the problems with the ranchers and the homesteaders.

In this third feature - ""BURY ME NOT ON THE LONE PRAIRIE"" (Released: 21 March 1941) (61 mins/B&W), Johnny Mack is a mining engineer whose brother is murdered by claim jumpers --- don't miss the showdown as Johnny Mack saves the heroine and gives the culprits what they deserve, hot lead!

And the final oater - ""LONE STAR TRAIL"" (Released: 6 August 1943) (58 mins/B&W), Ride the Lone Star Trail, as the West's greatest Star Duo Johnny Mack Brown and Tex Ritter roars along a lead swept trail of vengeance --- At this point in their careers, the pairing was intended to allow the western greats to pool their on screen strengths --- Ritter sang the tunes and Brown handled the action and fistfights in a first rate manner --- Overall, it was a great pairing.

Bobby J. Copeland's book published by Empire Publising on ""Johnny Mack Brown: Up Close & Personal"" is chuck full of answers to all the questions his fans had from early on --- when you went to see him on the big screen, you got exactly what the marquee said...plenty of thrills, adventure and loaded with action --- Johnny Mack was a natural for the western, his riding abilities and fight scenes were of the the same caliber as Buck Jones and Bob Steele --- Johnny Mack sets the saddle better than Duke Wayne --- seems Johnny got better with the more films he made and the scripts were always top notch --- he was one of the best-liked people in films, what you saw on the screen is what he really was, a great human being.

2835214,4,B000QCU9VC,"VCI Entertainment has pretty much carved out a niche for itself by finding superior prints of classic Westerns (especially classic ""B"" oaters) and releasing them on DVD. The present release is no exception. VCI has an ongoing Johnny Mack Brown series on DVD-R, and this new release places four of those films on regular DVD, and at a very reasonable price! The four films offer a great summary of the fine acting ability of Brown, from the 1930s through the mid-1940s, with generally better than average production values. The prints are generally quite good, with only a few minor glitches. For fans of the B Western or those interested in cinematic history---or for those looking for good 'ole adventure, the price it right and the entertainment very good. Thanks VCI!",1185580800,16,770,4.930769230769231

2835233,3,B000QCU9VC,"In short, all I can say is these are great films, but the prints are merely watchable.  All 4 features are hacked to pieces with dialogue splices and print damage.  Crooked Trail, Boothill Brigade, and Bury Me Not look the worst.  Lone Star Trail fares slightly better.  Many of VCI's older westerns leave much to be desired in terms of quality.  I don't expect restoration, just a decent print.",1356998400,2,395,4.666666666666667
2835234,4,B000QCU9VC,"Of the four movies in this collection, Lone Star Trail is the best. The plot for Lone Star Trail is a fairly standard one. Rancher Blaze Barker returns to the town of Dead Falls to clear his name after spending two years in prison for a robbery he didn't commit. The actual robbers do what they can to either send him back to prison or to kill him. Comic relief is provided by veteran actor and sidekick Fuzzy Knight.

Of particular interest in this film is that one of the ""bad guys"" is played by a future Hollywood legend very early in his career. Even if you don't like westerns, it would be fun to watch the first few minutes of the film to see if you can identify him.",1313020800,,673,4.176923076923077
2835235,4,B000QCU9VC,"This is a 1946 black and white western filmed during the days when westerns had no deep meaning, filmed just for fun. It stars Buster Crabbe as the fearless man who helps people in distress. He is not a gunfighter and there is no shootout duels. He is in three fist fights - hands only, no feet nor judo - and wins them all. The pistol and rifle shooting in the film is from afar. Crabbe's sidekick is Al ""Fuzzy"" St. John, called ""Fuzzy"" or ""Fuzz"" in the film. He gives most of the comic parts, which take up many minutes of the film. He is a bearded elderly man who apparently lacks either upper or lower teeth, or both. He acts in a silly manner and wears a beat-up hat, baggy pants, and suspenders. He also gets into three fist fights. Loses two and comes out in a draw on the third when he wrestles the Englishman's butler, who also adds humor to the approximately one hour film.

There is a gang of rustlers in the area who take their rustled cattle through unused Hidden Valley. They keep town people away by insisting that there is a ghost in Hidden Valley. An Englishman comes to town to repossess Hidden Valley, which he inherited from his father. The Englishman is dressed in caricature western cloths because his London tailor assured him that this is what people wear in the west. He also acts in a caricature English fashion. He brought his butler along who waits on him. The Butler is appalled at Fuzz's uncouth behavior and frequently tells him so, adding more humor. The Englishman is unable to fight and Crabbe saves him from the rustlers who are determined to get rid of him so that they can resume their lucrative rustling career.",1302566400,3,1649,4.442244224422442

Their picture quality is above par and unlike Alpha, they don't alter the movies, add a logo, freeze frame opening credits or add sound effects to the sound tracks. You cannot go wrong with four Johnny Mack Brown Westerns. It could be debated whether these are some of his better films, but I have to be honest. The price is a steal. Especially when you consider that you'd pay more for the same number (and same titles) of movies from Alpha's release.
