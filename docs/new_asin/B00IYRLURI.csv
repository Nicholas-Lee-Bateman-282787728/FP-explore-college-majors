6305461,4,B00IYRLURI,"This a very good made for television movie, enough so that I bought it. It is not high art nor awards worth but it is a feel good movie and is just a fun movie with some good music (although not enough). The actors were good and the it's entertaining. Even the new actress Brooke White from 2008 5th place finisher from American Idol did well. What more can you ask for a good 85 minute of light entertainment  By the way is had a working title of ""Star Spangled Banner and is listed as such in IMDB. Enjoy.",1409702400,2,507,4.121212121212121

6305483,4,B00IYRLURI,"Not that I follow American Idol, but there's a certain morbid curiosity that applies whenever such contestants take a stab at cinema. Can they transition successfully or will it be a train wreck? BANNER 4TH OF JULY is a 2013 joint from Hallmark. Brooke White is the reality show alum making a bid at the crossover. Her American Idol creds allow her to contribute two original songs to the movie: ""Fly Fly Fly"" and the infectious ""Sun Up, Sun Down.""

Gratifyingly, it's a good movie. Surprisingly, Brooke White may be its best performer, never mind that she's this acting novice appearing in only her second TV movie (after CHANGE OF PLANS). She plays Desiree Banner, one third of a once celebrated sibling rock band act. Ten years ago, at the height of their popularity, a restless Desiree left the group, wanting to strike out on her own - and so the Banner Project disbanded, her two brothers left in the lurch.

Desiree went on to marry a big time record producer and turned out a solo album. Johnny Banner (Michael Barbuto), the band drummer, settled down and now has a family of his own. Mitchell (Christian Campbell), the guitarist, whiled away the years as a starving musician, harboring a deep resentment against his sister. It's been ten years since Desiree went solo. They've barely spoken since.

Until now, when their mother's heart attack compels the Banner kids to converge in their little hometown of Pinewood Hills. So, now, questions. Can old grudges be put to rest? Can a fractured family be remedied? Will Desiree lose her record label to her divorce of her fink of a husband? Can Mitch rekindle that old spark with his high school prom date who can maybe outshred him on the guitar? And can a dying town be saved? The Banner mom (Mercedes Ruehl) happens to be town mayor, so maybe you can't get too mad at her for parlaying her ailment into a panacea for that dying town. Can the Banner Project, Pinewood Hills' tremendous pride and joy, work a ressurection, if only for one evening, in the shape of a reunion concert during the 4th of July festival?

Sometimes, the fates are kind and heed the wishes of a mother desperate to heal her family and save her town, especially if she's conniving enough. Mercedes Ruehl amuses with her sneaky meddling as mom and mayor. BANNER 4TH OF JULY surprised me with how effortlessly it engaged me with its blend of small town drama and rock star dysfunction. It helps that the story never goes too over-the-top. Despite the awkward chill in the family dynamics, there's a steady warmth that pervades the screen. The cast are mostly these little-known actors, but they're solid. And Brooke White is strong in her role, and she and Christian Campbell showcase a pleasing harmony when that reconciliation comes around and the Banner Project finally gets on stage. Oh, hey, did I spoiler it? C'mon, now. Hallmark wouldn't have it end any other way.",1425772800,6,2900,4.725296442687747
