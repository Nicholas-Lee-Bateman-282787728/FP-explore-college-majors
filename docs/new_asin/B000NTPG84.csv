2781266,5,B000NTPG84,"I was fortunate to be able to see the BBC (Region 2) version of this series and I found it very compelling and interesting. Simon does a very persuasive job of explaining how and why (he feels) these greats (Caravaggio, Bernini, Rembrandt, David, Turner, Van Gogh, Picasso) standout in the annuals of art. A very easily accessible series for even the most uninitiated in the subject; highly recommended by this art novice. I only wish there were more episodes in the series!",1172880000,96,474,4.7926829268292686

2781292,5,B000NTPG84,"This is the best art book, even with black and white photos that you will every buy.  For me the history of art work and the artist is what makes painting, sculpture, etc., so meaningful and Schama has selected the most astrounding artists to write about.  The CD is even better.  If you want to interest someone in art, buy them this book!",1456790400,,340,4.365079365079365
2781293,5,B000NTPG84,"The subtitle to this extraordinary series is ""Eight Works That Exploded on to an Unsuspecting World."" These are works not just wonderful in themselves, but art pieces with an enthralling history.  Schama's story telling doesn't use just narration. We see locations, video and well-executed re-enactments, including Andy Serkis' riveting portrayal of  Vincent Van Gogh.

The eight artists are shown in chronological order. Each is presented primarily through one of his works, but, along the way, you learn about other works and the milieu in which the artist lived and created. Don't forget to re-watch the episodes with the Bonus Extra commentaries. They and the final interview with Simon Schama added to my enjoyment of the series.

The series originally aired in 2006. The episodes total 463 minutes. On the DVDs, they are presented in 16:9 aspect ratio and stereo sound. English SDH subtitles are available on the episodes.

1. CARAVAGGIO and ""David With the Head of Goliath""
It's a great introduction to Caravaggio and the whole series: ""Italy 1610. Michelangelo Merisis de Caravaggio is on the run again. No stranger to trouble, this artist tangled with the law for most of his life.... We like to think, don't we, that the genius is the hero. That the good guy wins. But this is Caravaggio, and the genius is the villain.""
Look at the artist's portrait. Isn't this a man who dares the viewer to cross him?

2. BERNINI and ""Ecstasy of Saint Teresa"" sculpture
Bernini's personality was the opposite of Caravaggio  witty, charming and cultured. Schama narrates: ""The whole point of classified sculptures was to make humans less so, to give mortal flesh the heavy-weight smoothness of immortality. So, many of them ended up looking divine but bloodless."" And then along came Bernini.
See how this star ends up out-Caravaggio-ing Caravaggio.
BONUS EXTRA: Commentary track with Simon Schama and Clara Beavan (producer).
These collaborators talk about how to light sculpture that can't be moved. They decided to not use English actors for the recreated Italian scenes. It's not just the spoken language, it's the body language.

3. REMBRANDT and ""Claudius Civilis""
As an example of Schama's humor, here's his introduction to one of Rembrandt's portraits, ""Elias Trip, head of the dynasty, thought of himself as a pillar of Protestant society. Your old fashioned sober-sided church-going arms dealer.""
Rembrandt goes out of fashion and files for bankruptcy in 1656. ""Claudius Civilis"" is supposed to bring him back. Instead, he is reduced to humiliation.
Trivia: Schama tells how the burghers were so displeased with the giant painting ""The Night Watch"" that they refused to pay for it. I've seen elsewhere that this is a misconception, including in the other recommended art series,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Private-Life-of-a-Masterpiece-The-Complete-Seasons-1-5/dp/B0011V7PSW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Private Life of a Masterpiece: The Complete Seasons 1-5</a>

4.  DAVID and ""The Death of Marat""
Schama asks, after telling us about David's life, ""So why do I like David? Well, I don't. He's a monster. But he makes ideas blaze in dry ice. He is a fantastic propagandist.""
Trivia: David  is pronounced dah VEED. David had a scar on his face from a sword fight. In the fight re-enactment, the scar is shown on the actor's left side. At the end, it's shown on the right.
BONUS EXTRA: Commentary track with Simon Schama and Clara Beavan.
Beavan remembers shooting one scene: ""You were coming along the corridor and there was a huge noise on the other side of the corridors.... I was getting more and more furious. I finally sent James off to see what the h*** the noise was. James came back and said, 'They're filming 'The Da Vinci Code'.""

5.  TURNER and ""Slave Ship""
Turner became successful very young, invited to join the venerable Royal Academy at only 26 years old.  He's known mostly for his serene landscapes, which, even at the time, were mocked for their warm tones.
But, Schama says of ""Slave Ship"": ""This is my Turner, extreme Turner. The Cockney poet just short of rudeness.""

6. VAN GOGH and ""Wheatfield With Crows""
Schama says this painting ""was a revolutionary masterpiece. It's the painting which begins modern art. Yet, within a few weeks the man who had achieved it had killed himself.""
Vincent's younger brother, Theo, kept his letters. The re-enactments use Vincent's own words, which show an intelligent, well-read, questioning man.
Trivia: Van Gogh cut off the fleshy part of his earlobe, not the whole ear. Vincent and Theo are buried next to each other with simple gravestones.
BONUS EXTRA: Commentary track with Simon Schama, David Bottom (director) and Andy Serkis (actor, played Van Gogh).
The scene where Vincent (played by Serkis) eats a tube of paint is based on a real incident. This is a powerful visual and almost painful to watch. Schama says, ""It's the half cry, half laugh at the end which is absolutely brilliant.""

7. PICASSO and ""Guernica""
Picasso was apolitical, more from self-absorption than anything else. The Spanish-born artist was in Paris in 1937 when the Nazi Luftwaffe bombed the anti-Franco town of Guernica into near oblivion. For Picasso, life caught up with art.

8. ROTHKO and the Seagram series
These are paintings you need to sit in front of and melt into. Schama: ""While at first sight these paintings seem so still and composed, hang around for a moment and you'll see they're anything but.""

BONUS FEATURE ""Interview with Simon Schama"" (24 minutes, no subtitles)
Schama tells us how this series came to be, through stories as well as reflections. For the Rembrandt episode, he remembers filming in front of the artist's large self-portrait: ""I had this terrible sense he was looking at me and saying, through those fishy eyes of his, 'Well, I've seen people like you before... You come and go. I stay around.""

Only occasionally does Schama resort to what I call ""art speak"", that incomprehensible and self-important commentary you too often find in art catalogues. Almost always, his commentary in ""The Power of Art"" is illuminating, humorous and sometimes pungent!

2781331,2,B000NTPG84,"I am sorry to rain on this parade of superlative reviews of this DVD series on eight major artists, but I was disappointed.  I have a fine DVD player, but the quality of the photography is poor, with blurred images and uncertain coloration.  For a series on art, this is inexcusable.  But of even greater significance is the narration and information presented.  Schama is a decent narrator, and I have viewed his excellent series on the history of England.  But this series is poor.  Schama spends an inordinate amount of time on the life of the artist and far too little time on the art itself.  He will explain the general history and meaning of a particular painting, but what about the technique, the detailed use of color and shading, the relationship to other contemporary artists in style and rendering beyond the topic of the painting?  What about the components of the painting, the materials used?  If you are truly interested in the art itself, these things matter greatly, but there is barely if ever a word on them.  I am far more interested in these topics than in knowing the intricacies of the supposed personality quirks of the artist, which Schama supplies in often mind numbing detail.  I realize that this makes for ""entertaining"" story telling, but the title of the series is The Power of Art, not The Lives of the Great Artists.  If you really want to learn about the art and why it is so powerful, look elsewhere.",1421020800,7,1437,4.658730158730159
2781332,5,B000NTPG84,I bought this for my wife and she loves it.  She is an oil painter and teacher of the same.  I found it interesting even though it is out of my usual interests.,1414800000,,160,3.8181818181818183

2781338,5,B000NTPG84,"Simon Schama does it again! Each episode examines a seminal work from one of history's greatest artists. Schama combines artist biography and critical examination of the artwork, all in his witty, urbane, and knowledgeable style. Outstanding in every respect!",1404604800,,259,5.666666666666667
2781339,4,B000NTPG84,This series covers beautiful art with excellent storytelling and great photography.  The episodes are framed with an leading question or interesting scene and each story unpacks the events in the opening.  In general this works very well but sometimes the supporting reenactments feel like repetitive filler rather that quality content. There is little speculative babble and nearly all the discussions are lucid.  Setting aside the reenactments this is excellent and well worth watching.,1402358400,,488,5.657534246575342
2781340,5,B000NTPG84,"As a result of viewing Simon Schama's Power of Art I set off on an exploratory journey of Picasso and his Masterpiece Guernica. It has been an exciting and enjoyable journey and I thank Simon Schama for his research, presentation and deliverance of his DVD, Power of Art and strongly recommend it.",1399766400,,297,4.730769230769231

2781342,5,B000NTPG84,I love art history and these dvds are great. I especially love the Bernini documentary as baroque is my favorite era.  Definitely a good series to have,1398124800,,151,4.592592592592593
2781343,4,B000NTPG84,Content was very good but all three segments of the first of three CDs locked up near the end of each. Little content was lost but it was frustrating and off putting.,1396137600,,166,4.21875

2781345,5,B000NTPG84,"I Love the way in which all Artists were sown and talked about . Mr. Schama was simply wonderful in his narration. The Artists were shown and described, and I thought all were all very convincing as to known facts about their lives. Anyone that wants to know anything about these Artists ..BUY IT. I believe SCHOOLS would be smart to buy this and introduce these Artists to the fresh young students. Inspiring.",1394150400,,410,4.63013698630137
2781346,5,B000NTPG84,"This is the best set on art that I have ever watched.

The only drawback is that there aren't more....",1392595200,,102,4.1
2781357,5,B000NTPG84,"Love this series. I found the price, quality and content to be exactly what I was looking for. Worth the price.",1391472000,,111,4.333333333333333
2781358,5,B000NTPG84,"Quite possibly one of the best documentaries on artists I've seen. It can get a little too adulatory in places, but it's beautifully, beautifully done.",1391212800,,151,5.08
2781359,5,B000NTPG84,"I first saw this on P.B.C. and loved it, if you want to understand art more this movie is killer.  I have bought 2 more copies for friends",1391126400,,138,3.9285714285714284
2781360,5,B000NTPG84,"This is a wonderful DVD set. I did not purchase it for myself but for a friend who was beginning to take art courses in college. He was my daughter's boyfriend at the time and he is a very talented artist without the book learning. In any case this set of ""art appreciation"" videos seemed to have made an impression on him....he really liked them. He watched them not only for the appreciation, but for inspiration for his own work.  Eight very famous artists are spotlighted in this series along with their work of course. Beautifully photographed and narrated, this set is a college course in itself. So if you are interested in art, need some inspiration for your own art efforts, or you just like seeing beautiful paintings, this set is well worth the price.",1390089600,,762,4.602941176470588
2781361,5,B000NTPG84,"I have watched these multiple times, insightful and interesting pieces on great artists lives and work.  I enjoy Schama's take and his droll sense of humor.",1388793600,,156,5.0
2781362,5,B000NTPG84,"Many unknown aspects were told in an emphatic way by Mr Schama. A deeper understanding of the artists was given, how and why they worked as they did.",1386633600,,149,4.357142857142857
2781363,5,B000NTPG84,Awesome series that my dad introduced us to. We showed my mother in law a couple of clips and she was hooked so we bought her the set for Christmas. Something you could easily watch over and over,1383955200,,195,4.157894736842105
2781364,5,B000NTPG84,There is no writer in the art world as great as Simon. He writes with passion.  His selection of the artists are ideal and very  imformative.  We love his language as well.,1382313600,,172,4.3125
2781365,4,B000NTPG84,"Simon Schama is one of my favorite historians. His writing is clear and well organized. This book provides an provocative point of view. The chapters on Caravagio and Van Gogh were especially good. I was unfamiliar with the work of Rothko and am still unconvinced of his significance. Perhaps, because of my architectural background, the discussion of Bernini was disappointing. His competition with Borromini was overly dramatised. Somewhere I read another explanation for Borromini's suicide. Maybe I just don't like Baroque sculpture. Schama's opinion of Picasso was challenging. I do have a much higher regard for Guernica. The chapters on Rembrant and Turner deserve another reading. Watching the accompanying video persuaded me that I had missed something. A background in art and architectural history probably adds to the enjoyment and appreciation of this book.",1380067200,2,870,5.5
2781366,5,B000NTPG84,We love this series. Our 13 year old son watches them with us. Simon Schama does a great job in telling us about the artist and the works.  It is professionally made.  My only complaint is that there needs to be more episode covering more works of art.,1378339200,,252,4.229166666666667
2781367,5,B000NTPG84,"Should you never get to see this art up close and personal, this is how you want to experience it, through Simon Schama's Power of Art. Not only does this capture you visually, the story telling will captivate you and leave you wanting to know more. Very powerful! I Recommend this art-umentary to art lovers and non art lovers alike. The history alone is worth adding this to your list for viewing, so even if you are not interested so much in the art, even though they go hand in hand, you will thoroughly enjoy the history.",1374710400,,526,4.43298969072165

2781369,5,B000NTPG84,"I was a lit major in college. Used to love hearing a professor explain a great work.  Schama does just that: he builds up the historical context and the personal life drama of each artist (six in all) with such force that I was taken aback.

Not for kids.  It's raw, visceral, sexual, bloody, in the gutter, at the apex of fame, falling from the latter to the former, etc. etc. etc.

It'll take you on a journey that you'd hardly expect from ""Art History.""  You will not be the same.",1368489600,3,483,4.263736263736264

2781372,5,B000NTPG84,"I haven't yet seen it but the two sons I sent it to are thrilled!  One says all the episodes are not equal, but overall it is a great series, even for one who has never studied art history.",1359331200,,189,3.8461538461538463
2781373,5,B000NTPG84,"Simon Schama is so incredibly passionate and knowledgeable, he brings art to life with his witty observations and trenchant analysis of the most famous artists and the times they lived in. He is able to take a painting, and give it so many layers of meaning and beauty by explaining the history of the countries and societies the artists lived in. The dramatization of plots helps make the series very memorable and colorful. The documentary itself is a work of art !!! Professor Schama's charisma brings a lot of emotion to each painting he explains. If you ever thought art is for stuffy old museums, you will be delighted to find out about the artists behind some of the best known works of art ! Artists are often crazy geniuses, and it makes it much easier to appreciate their contribution to the world if you know their stories.
Watch this entertaining series to get more cultured and develop a keener understanding of art.",1356566400,,929,4.705521472392638

The banal works that adorn most of our homes and public spaces don't challenge or educate, the lend flavor. But real art challenges, pushes, moves and even brings about movement and change. It speaks to us... but so often we have forgotten the language of art because we are anesthetized by our modern ways of entertaining ourselves. Schama tells us otherwise.",1356393600,,439,4.714285714285714

2781376,5,B000NTPG84,"Like a very good dramatic play on Broadway; all details covered.  You are held spellbound.  This is Schama's best work.  I don't think he can duplicated it.  I would love to buy volume after volume of his presentations on art so full of passion and details of information; you feel you know the artists when he is finished and you know the period along with them. And I loved your attire: simple darkest black suit with whitest laundered shirt (opened) and your narrator's speech was off the chart and all that travel and all those beautiful places, all that marble and gold trim, beautiful galleries and furniture, and up close photography on the sculptures and paintings--everything was just unforgettably perfect. The music and voice/opera just glorious!  THANK YOU SIMON, just what a professor should do if he has theater or Hollywood in his blood or in his dreams.

2781397,5,B000NTPG84,"The book accompanying (preceding or following) the series was a joy to read. This series is different as visual and dramatic art is from print. It is the very best kind of television. As art history, of course, it is a viewpoint, an interpretation, a drama...or, rather, eight dramas. Each of the artists covered could be treated differently, interpreted in different fashion. This is the most true, of course, in the artist closest to an American audience (and, perhaps, other peoples in the Western tradition), closest to our times, to our problems, and to the visual expressions to which he, and other artists very different from him, created, to try to reflect themselves and the way they saw and felt the world. Whatever personal disagreements one may have, however little one's responses may correspond to his, he still makes an invaluable contribution. He makes the art and the artists live, he stimulates the viewer to re-examine conceptions, or to examine works and artists for the first time, aware that, at least to one person, they have a meaning, have had an impact. Who knows, one might also experience that impact, or another equally valuable or even more acute and meaningful. One might also, after examination, find his outlook faulty in the extreme.

Yes, art is VERY IMPORTANT, but the lengths to which Schama goes to equate the art with the artist are as ridiculous as Rothko's reputation.  I SUPPOSE David was a bad man, but his work was good.  If Schama had his way, every time you look at a David painting you'll see nothing but evil.  But more than anything else, it's the Mark Rothko section that made me sick.  I was having a good time, when all of a sudden he starts praising Rothko.  People, it's blobs of color.  Blobs of boring, ugly color.  It's overrated puke.
Oh, and the extended take on the obvious sexual imagery in the statue of St. Theresa is a little over the top.  Enough already.  Yes, it's sexual, but it's also deeply religious.  Maybe, just maybe, she really was feeling something spiritual and maybe, just maybe, the artist intended to convey that and not an orgasm.

 Beathoven's "" Moonlight Sonata "" prior to each artist, was very appropriate and enjoyable. That being the case, the beautiful music throughout all of the presentations was frankly, TOO LOUD. It was constantly competing with the author's low key voice and European accent. At various points , his significant words were drowned by crescendos of musical sound.

I felt that the Picasso section was lacking in that, if you feel what truly stamped Picasso as a "" great "" artist was his creation of  "" Guernica "" ( which I feel did do just that ), without the influence of African art, Picasso may have been popular, but not "" great "". Mr Schama's main theme of the inseparable relationship of art and life should have included his relationship with African art for this segment to be a "" great "" one.

Lastly, a non-actor from Van Gogh,s homeland would have been more natural and therefore much more effective.

The inclusion of Turner in the list may have pure British reasons, nevertheless the tension Schama has been able to build into the slave ship painting is brilliant.
Each of the programs is captivating, shows great insight and is very enriching. I started with Rembrandt, who is very familiar ground to Schama ('The Embarrassment of Richness', and 'Rembrandt's Eyes') and was enchanted. I allowed some slack of insight and information content for the other painters; that was not necessary.

Sometimes the narrator can nod his head too much (yes this seems stupid but after a while you start to wonder if he's an arrogant man or has a bobble head problem.)

Schama is a uniquely gifted narrator who seizes one's attention completely.  Schama picks eight works of art to explore in depth from several different perspectives - the times, the artist, and the artwork.  What one learns is that there is so much more to the artwork.  There is an underlying powerful message; hence, the Power of Art.  Blended into each narrative is beautiful music.  Actually, my one complaint is that the music was not identified anywhere.  There was one musical piece that I wanted to purchase separately, and after hours of googling, I eventually found it (Vivaldi's Nisi Dominus, Stabat Mater).

Novice or connoisseur, this is an extraordinary trip he embarks us in. It's not a stroll in the museum, it's a time machine, you will live with Bernini and understand Rothko's anguish.

2781434,5,B000NTPG84,"I fully agree with the large number of five-star reviews here and will add my own to those. This is not a comprehensive study of art and covers neither any one period nor even painters who are in any real way linked. There are two things that each of the episodes have in common. First, each episode deals with a great artist who created a masterpiece of art under stressful or demanding circumstances. Second, none of the great works were created to hang in an art gallery (though all do today).

The format is a combination of commentary, narrative history, reenactments using actors, and photographs of original works of art. I can imagine some people being put off by either the reenactments or even the commentary, but I was quite taken with all of it. I usually do not like reenactments, but with only minor exceptions I found nearly all of the actors to be quite excellent. The narrative was superb. I found that I learned things about nearly all of the artists that Schama covers. Rembrandt and Turner and Rothko all mean a bit more to me than they did before the series. And the photography of the great works was simply gorgeous, as was also the photography of the wonderful landscapes. The countryside in both the Turner and Van Gogh episodes were as astonishing as any of the paintings.

One of the best things about the series is the obvious passion that Schama has for art in general and for these artists in particular. I liked that he was not equally approving of each of the artists. While no sane person could challenge David's abilities as a painter, I like that Schama expresses his dislike for the causes to which David gave his allegiance, essentially becoming a propagandist. Schama wrote a very good book on the French Revolution, CITIZENS, so this is a subject about which he possesses some very strong, and highly informed, opinions. So while David is not a painter he admires as a person, he deals with him as a painter who, in keeping with the title of the series, painted with undeniable power.",1243641600,,2023,4.632311977715878

2781436,5,B000NTPG84,"Simon Schama is never less than illuminating and penetrating in these eight hour-long explorations of famous artists and great art. The first section on Caravaggio, for example, expertly weaves the artist's tumultuous life with his painting. I've never much liked his work but Schama made me look at it in new ways -- the dirty fingernails of one of the characters for example, the cold-blooded murder of John the Baptists in another, looking like a scene from The Sopranos.
The episode on the scultor Bernini was also fascinating. Schama shows one bust of a pope with a button on his tunic half-undone, suggesting his hefty weight. He looks in detail at the famous sculture of the Ecstasy of St. Theresa, caught in a moment of orgasmic bliss, and suggests her flowing, disordered robes, so wonderfully wrought, suggest what is happening to her inside.
Schama has a particularly British manner -- witty and sardonic -- that keeps us interested. For anyone seeking new insight into great art, I recommend this BBC series.",1236556800,,1020,4.970760233918129
2781447,2,B000NTPG84,"It's astounding the high rating this gets.  I watched it on n-flix and sent it back half-watched.  It's an overproduced mess, with Schama not saying much about the art but very gossipy about the artists.  There are giant close-ups, with warts and spittle and twitching and portentous music, the tiresome template for every artist Schama covers, presumably to give us an idea about what the artist was ""really"" like.  And there's lots of Schama, tramping around scenic locations which may or may not have anything to do with the narrative.

I guess if you're into fashionable camera jerk and shake and little slice-of-life melodramas, with heavy breathing and colorful costumes, then you'll go for this shallow survey.  But if you're into the art, Sister Wendy is far, far more illuminating.

I loved Schama's History of Britain, loved his quirky, irreverent delivery. I give two-stars because I love to watch Schama, but frankly, I think he's consciously trying to imitate Kenneth Clark, whose Civilization, a Personal View, was a cultural history of the West through its art and remains the benchmark against which other culture documentaries are measured.  Despite the 40 years of slick technology the deconstructed Schama has over the elegantly attired and debonair Clark, this effort doesn't measure up at all.",1236470400,19,1314,5.165094339622642

In the creation phase of the masterpiece, additional background information about the social happenings, the personality of the artist, the important steps in the artist's life on the way to the creation of the masterpiece are mentioned. It's very very useful for art enthusiasts to create awareness abour certain concepts, trends and styles. But surely an entry tool to warm you up to go further. In the endless sea of art, 8 artists are really not too much. But these 8 artists are selected to cover a significant poriton of the understanding of art history.

That in it's self says it all for me !!!!",1216425600,,599,4.084745762711864
2781458,3,B000NTPG84,"It seems these days every British scholar's highest ambition is to be a TV star.  Simon Schama, a historian best known for his excellent revisionist history of the French Revolution, has become a jack of all trades with series on ""all"" British history and now art.  He provides some brilliant formal analysis, some less brilliant psychological analysis, and some real howlers.

In the Rothko segment he wildly overstates a half-century of American inflation: Rothko's $35,000 Four Seasons commission was not worth ""two and a hahf million"" 2007 dollars, as Schama misstates twice, but roughly one-tenth that amount. But what's a zero between friends?

Furthermore, his grim painting of artists in the Depression fails to note that many were far better off in the Depression than earlier, due to FDR's Federal Art Project, which provided a regular paycheck to artists (including Rothko) who had never seen one before.

In the Caravaggio section Schama states that ""according to Christian tradition""--of which he knows next to nothing, evidently--the Virgin did not die but ""snoozed."" He is clearly delighted to ""inform"" us of her demise.

The Bernini section belabors endlessly the displaced sexuality of his sculpture of Saint Teresa. This is hardly a revelation, and also somewhat reductive. Two days later I saw a performance by Mitsuko Uchida of Mozart; the same interpretation could have been applied to her rapt expression.  Sex may be ecstatic (let us pray), but all ecstasy is not necessarily sexual.

Nonetheless, Schama, playing to the TV groundlings, is determined to include all the sex and violence he can conjure up, starting with the facile trope of paint as blood that introduces each segment and proceeding with a tawdry swashbuckler on Caravaggio.

Schama himself is no swashbuckler but a more intellectual Austin Powers, goofy posture included. Perhaps his strained wit--he rattles off ""hip"" slang phrases (e.g., ""Yeah, right"") as proudly as if he were inventing them--has caused a hernia, or is it his very odd delivery (constantly inhaling deeply and puffing up his narrow chest, executing a kind of corkscrew with his shoulders and hips, etc.)? What is more subtly comical is the manner in Schama reveals himself as a perfect example of precisely the snooty Brit he parodies regularly.

Kudos to the actors playing Rothko and Van Gogh! And kudos to Schama for introducing the art to those who've never heard of it! So let's make it three-and-a-half stars for Simplifying Simon.",1215475200,30,2497,5.173697270471464

Befor radio and TV imposed a shared concern in common points of view, it was much easier for individuals to consider themselves blessed with unique talents.

The focus of the art is lost with the jarring vocabulary (yes, the f-word is used at least three times), and the continuous dialogue about the sex lives of these artists.  Information I did not need to know to appreciate their art. THIS VIDEO SHOULD BE LABELED EXPLICIT.  Everything else is labeled so we are warned, why not this?  Because it is art?  Call me old fashioned, some things are just better left unsaid.  Look for a cleaned up version.  Public television did not air Van Gogh (I wonder why).

The construct of each of the programs is interesting . The author picks out 1 piece of art that defines the artist/changed the artists life e.g. Caravaggio has the slaying of Goliath, Picasso has Guernica. Schama then weaves the story of artists and his period setting skillfully around the artwork. You realize heroism of a Turner in creating the ""Slave Ship"", you cheer for Bernini's comeback in creating ""The Ecstacy of St Teresa"". Thankfully the choice of these seminal pieces of art doesn't read like the  top 10 rated in the art world (there's no Mona Lisa) , but Schama clearly convinces you that his selection merits notice.
To add on , the camera work and the reproduction of the settings are no less pieces of art themselves. Watch the low shots of the beach in the Turner episode, the bleak shots of rain dripping from thick glass in the Picasso episode.

That's exactly what his well wrought, delightfully punchy presentations aim for: the solar plexus. In each of his eight hour-long programs, Schama focuses on a single work by a single arist. And by dong so he conveys a sense of what that artist's world was all about and where he fits in to the broader scope of art history. But the way he does it is the thing. While the main plot of each presentation remains the artwork itself, Schama wrings out a driving  narrative by including as a subplot elements of personal drama in the artist's life. For Caravaggio it is his flagrant  Bohemian temperament; for Bellini it is a tortured love affair and his artistic rivalry with Borromini; for Rothko it is the internal conversations of a man whose zen-like spirituality collides with the external world and ultimately leads to his suicide. Schama probes the moment of creation that gave rise to each masterpiece in question. He seeks to shake you by the lapels, but with the artwork always as the central focus. These are unlike any art lectures you have ever seen before. Some may find them a bit over the top. But one thing is clear: you come away with a vivid understanding of history's great painters that you are not likely to forget.",1188518400,4,1392,4.74793388429752

2781529,5,B000NTPG84,"Schama's latest foray into the world of on-screen documentary is also his latest smash hit. Although fundamentally different than his earlier documentary (""The History of Britain""), this latest of his entries into the genre is another solid performer, destined to find its way onto the list of ""best documentaries ever made.""

For this series, Schama has specially selected eight key artists to make his underlying point that art is indeed powerful, and all one need do is examine some of these personages and their key works to be convinced of just that point. Schama easily makes his case, but takes us on a riveting eight-hour journey from Caravaggio to Rothko in doing so. Our trip leads us to meet each of the artists (Caravaggio, Bernini, David, Turner, Van Gogh, Rembrandt, Picasso, and Rothko), peer into the oftentimes emotion-charged lives in which they practiced their art, and survey of some of the major accomplishments of each, all flouted across the screen in high-resolution digital beauty. And yet, this is not really Schama's point at all: the point which he wants us to understand, to believe, to accept, to embrace, is that art can be powerful, often IS powerful, and that these eight people served as spectacular conduits of that power into their created works.

And so, for each of our eight personal witnesses called to the stand to defend Schama's thesis, we hear an often tormented roar of testimony, each of them having a unique story to tell in how art was powerful to them, and how that power impacted their and succeeding generations. Sometimes the power is, in Schama's words, a ""lie"" (for example, ""Death of Marat"" by David), and sometimes it is the power of guilt and redemption (Caravaggio's ""David with the head of Goliath""). Sometimes it is an open doorway to another dimension (Rothko's works), and sometimes, the power of reminding us who we are (Rembrandt's ""The Conspiracy of Claudius Civilis""). We don't have to know about these paintings beforehand to learn Schama's lesson: as we work through each episode, we learn more than enough to understand these works, and why they were created. As such, the series serves as an outstanding lesson on the history of western art. But we should never be misled as to Schama's true purpose. He wants us to see the medium of art as a source of power, sometimes tapped, sometime not, sometimes legitimate, sometimes not. But powerful nonetheless.

The DVD set closely follows the printed text, which was released almost two years ago. I would recommend that one purchase and work through both formats to receive the maximum insight and experience of the endeavor. The book and the documentary make use of slightly different approaches to achieve the same goal, and watching the DVD first or reading the book first will in no way spoil the pleasure and meaning of the other.

2781532,5,B000NTPG84,"This is a masterpiece of art-historical narrative about great masterpieces of Western art. What Prof. Schama, Columbia University, manages to do is to provide us with real insights into the artists he focuses on, thus illuminating each work he focuses on in a new way. He shows us carefully done recreations of both the artist's times and their lives, thus putting the canonical works that are the ultimate focus of each episode into both an historical and a psychological context.
  The works themselves are also lovingly shown. The production values of the series are also excellent.
  The success of these portraits is due to Schama's own intellectual, emotional, and even spiritual values, none of which are overtly broadcast, but which are present at every step of his account. It is this chemistry between Schama, the work he is so affected by, and the artist, that enables Schama to truly convey the power of art.",1185926400,3,920,4.954545454545454
2781533,5,B000NTPG84,"I saw this on television and ordered it for my daughter, an art major.
In addition to the probing insights into the mind and life of each artist, and the analyses of the works of each, the photography and visual montages are a work of art themselves.",1185408000,2,250,4.340425531914893
2781534,5,B000NTPG84,"I had the opportunity to meet Mr. Schama in a recent presentation of this documentary.  I first became famliar to his work through his book ""The Power of Art.""  His documentary is an excellent companion to a really great book.  When the documentary began to be shown on PBS, I knew I had to have a copy (eventually,I bought two copies).

The most important aspect of this documentary, in my opinion, is connected to the fact that Simon Schama is not all too concerned with styles or techniques but with historical context and its impact in the work of each artist he selected.  Each work is presented as a reaction to the events of the time.  Simon Schama also goes deep into the lives of each artist and provides us with a better understanding of their motivations and personal relationships.  These artists become very human and for that reason very much like us.  The combination of these factors result in the creation of amazing works of art that are a universal manifestations of human nature and emotion.  It is because the message of each piece is so human, so universal, that the art becomes memorable.  It is for this reason that these masterpieces continue to talk to us beyond the limitations of time.  This is the real power of art!

As an art history teacher, I truly enjoyed Simon Schama's approach to art history.  I tend to teach in very similar lines.  For those who are not necessarily interested in art (find that hard to believe) this documentary would provide a great deal of information tnat is exciting and entertaining.",1184976000,54,1544,4.67037037037037
2781535,5,B000NTPG84,"Everyone interested in Western art will WANT to own this disc...we are confronted with the art works that make our brains spin and our hearts leap out. Simon Schama begins his discussion with Caravaggio's ""David and Goliath."" Rather than depict the artist as the heroic figure, Caravaggio astounds us by portraying himself as the severed head of the monster, the enemy.  The film technique used by the director is to explore the biography of the artist, earlier works that lead up to this one, and the cultural moment to understand WHY the artist sees himself in this light.

In the next disc, one of the artists examined is William Turner.  I had always associated Turner with wonderful use of light, color, and the birth of English impressionism. But Simon Schama shows us the dark side of
Turner...artworks like a limp Death riding a Pale Horse. The key artwork we are to contemplate is a painting of a slave ship...a deeply disturbing work of an infamous scandal in British history where slaves were thrown overboard alive into the churning shark filled sea.  What Schama explains is that Turner's mother had gone insane after losing her daughter and been transformed into a screaming hysteric.  Only after this film did I start to notice screaming heads in Turner's sunsets, vapors, and white clouds.  Without the historical reconstruction, I would never have understood this side of the painter's work.

In the last disc, we confront Picasso and his greatest (political) masterpiece, ""Guernica.""  We are taken on a tour of Picasso's interior life and witness his change: He grows from seeking liberation for creative art into seeking liberation of all people from aggressive power and fascism.

In summary, after having my ""mind blown"" by Schama's penetrating analysis of one work of art, I couldn't wait to see the next episode.  Because the discussions, reconstructions, and art masterpieces themselves are very graphic, even disturbing, wait until your children are ready to show them this series...indeed, that is the point - the Power of Art - to move us.",1184889600,117,2066,5.014619883040936
2781536,4,B000NTPG84,"Schama does a wonderful job in bringing new light (and in some cases new controversy with his idiosyncratic readings) to eight artists and their work.  One does wonder about how the selection of the artists was made: all are white and male, seven of the eight are painters.  He opens each episode with a bit of a 'tease'--calling attention to one more or less 'culminating' work of art for the artist, and then uses the episode itself to backtrace all of the threads that came together to create a rather compelling suspense.

They are, perhaps, a bit overproduced.  Lots of film-school style quick intercutting of random scenes (if you see one more sunny field in Van Gogh or sweaty actor with rapier in Caravaggio, you're liable to scream) that are repeated and repeated and repeated and repeated--beyond the point of leitmotif and into the point of 'couldn't you have cut the episode down a bit?'  There's also some grotesquerie in just about every one and no warning at all.  I think it's funny that an episode of _Family Guy_ has a 'viewer discretion is advised;' while a graphic bullfight (not a recreation, not an artistic re-enactment) is not even warned of, but is so graphic it nearly eclipses the point it's trying to make.  Something to think about if you are planning on buying this to educate the kiddies.

Others have commented on Schama's occasionally execrable puns--some think he's trying to pander to his audience.  I think he just thinks he's being clever. If you like him, they come off as 'groaning at your uncle's horrible jokes' if you don't like him, they probably strike you as noxious.  That's personal taste, so it's for you to decide your threshold of urbane wittiness.

All in all worth a look.  He manages to bring art and artists to life in a way that many art history textbooks fail to do.  It's more than a matter of his approach of personal biography for each artist: it's the way he pieces the story together around and through the artist's production so that it makes a coherent narrative that is captivating.  And he addresses at several points a question perhaps not lost in the modern audience: is art relevant?  By seeing the artists as humans, we see new levels of their humanity, and new ways that their works can make meaning for us.",1182729600,44,2277,4.685929648241206

He takes one artist or tells their story through their work and provides context for what was going on in their lives and in the world at that time.
