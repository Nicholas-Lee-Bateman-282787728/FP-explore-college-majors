8087879,3,B000BKGYVI,"The DVD was basically a taped seminar Mark gave back in 2002. I didn't get much out of it mainly because I've use the same charting program TC2000 that Mark speaks about for about 7 or 8 years now. Additionally, I am very familiar with the proprietary technical indicators (Time segmented volume, Money Stream and Balance of Power which are only available in TC2000)he introduces the audience to for analyzing stocks. If you don't have TC2000, don't even bother ordering the DVD. If you do, you'd probably get more out of the FREE training videos available at [...], which are very, very good.

So was this DVD a total waste of money? No, it's helpful to learn to how other traders evaluate technical indicators, after all, picking up just one simple tip can make you thousands of dollars.",1180828800,2,789,4.717391304347826

8087881,2,B000BKGYVI,"in order to use Larson's program , you need to use TC2005. Most of his seminar can be learned on any technical site such as Clearstation. Also, the CD advertises a method that works 90%

of the time-you must attend the seminar to discover how to set this up on TC2005. GO to TC2005 discussion board, do search for Larson,even the tc2005 people do not know how to combine TSV and RSi-this is the indicator Larson claims works 90% of the time.

This CD is merely an advertisement to buy more cds. I wasted $60.00. lynn",1131580800,31,516,4.364583333333333
