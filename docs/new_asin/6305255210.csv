997842,4,6305255210,"WWF Rock Bottom:  In Your House was the December '98 PPV show.  It wound up being a good way to finish off the WWF's 1998 PPV schedule.  The Buried Alive match between the Undertaker and Stone Cold Steve Austin was not bad  if you like watching two pro wrestlers who don't have ten moves between  them.  If you are a true WRESTLING fan you will enjoy the WWF Title Match  between Champion- The Rock and Challenger- Mankind.  This match picks right  up where Survivor Series '98 left off.  Another great match was the 6-man  tag between the JOB Squad (Al Snow, Scorpio, and Bob Holly) and the Brood  (Gangrel, Edge, and Christian).  Other matches include:  The Striptease  Match between Jeff Jarrett w/ Debra McMichael and Goldust...with an  appearance by WWF Commissioner Shawn Michaels.

998080,1,6305255210,"There's not much I can say about the actual event that hasn't already been said, it was mediocre at best, but I can add my opinion about the actual DVD...
First off, there are NO EXTRAS...now, I'll admit, I wasn't surprised by this...Sure the WWF could have opened up the vault and given us some cool stuff leading up to Rock Bottom 1998, but they didn't and it's not the first time they released a DVD without any extras...What can you say, I guess the WWF doesn't ""Get It"" when it comes to making the DVD more worth buying by adding extras...
But I'm not mad about there being no extras...sure, extras are nice, but they don't have to be included...
What I am mad about is the exclusion of a MENU! How do you exclude a menu from a DVD? Isn't the menu standard? This is the only DVD (in general) I own (and I own a number of DVDs) that has no menu...And no menu means no select a match feature, which means if say you don't want to watch the whole event but rather just want to watch the buried alive match, the main event on the disc...you can't just press and button and be at the start of the match (like you can with other WWF DVDs), oh no, you have to FAST FORWARD throught the whole event...You can't even jump from chapter to chapter because the whole event is one chapter...
Basically the WWF just took the video version of Rock Bottom and transferred it over to a DVD...Very disappointing...
Take a mediocre event, mix it with no extras and NO MENU and you get a DVD worth passing up...Unless this is your favorite event in WWF history (and then I ask why?) or if you already have it on VHS and want to replace the video with a DVD, pass on this one...You'll be happy you did...",1013040000,16,1688,4.2291021671826625

998083,3,6305255210,"Hello, here is my first review.  No one seems to have reviewed this WWF Pay-Per-View so here for the benefit of those who might like to buy it is my own review.
Quality: Mediocre - Average.
There are a number of entertaining contests but however the WWF seemed to think back in '98 that having people like Goldust and the Oddities on their roster was a good idea, not to mention the incredibly brutal Jeff Jarrett.
There are two main event matches on the tape:
1.) Stone Cold vs. The Undertaker in a buried alive match.  Stone Cold had to win this match in order to qualify for the 1999 Royal Rumble match.  This is during the height of the McMahon - Austin feud.  Stone Cold has just recently been reinstated to the WWF with a new five year contract and is coming of the back of a major screw job at the Survivor Series a month earlier (suprise surprise).  Anyway can Austin defeat the Phenom at his own game? Well I won't spoil the outcome for you.
2.) The Rock (Champion) vs. Mankind for the WWF championship.
Mankind gets screwed once again - I won't tell you how.  But its the Corporate Champions night and Vince McMahon is determined to keep it that way while Mankind has an agenda of his own regarding a certain contract clause -- you'll see what I mean.
The rest of the p.p.v. is o.k. but not spectacular. The new commissioner Shawn Michaels makes no friends either among his former fans or among the other WWF superstars whom the corporation is out to get, namely the New Age Outlaws who defend their tag titles against Ken Shamrock an the Big Boss Man.
There is a Striptease match between Jeff Jarrett and Goldust: if Jarrett wins Goldust strips, if Goldust wins Debra strips.
There are a couple of tag bouts:
the J.O.B. Squad vs. The Brood- 4/10
The Headbangers vs. the Oddities 31/2 / 10
Val Venis and The Godfather vs. D'Lo Brown and Mark Henry 6/10
And not only that but Steve Blackman and Owen Hart battle it out in one of the most physical and technically sound matches of the night.
Anyway that's enough from me here's what the back of the cover says:
""It's the Corporate Champion's night, in the event named after the Rock.  Watch these two pieces of trash (Austin-Undertaker) bury each other alive, while the Rock puts the corporate smackdown on that Jabroni, Mankind.""
Enjoy the show, see you.",1002585600,,2313,4.492857142857143
998084,5,6305255210,"This was an awesome event, the second best ppv of 1998, all the matches were pretty good. There were two really awesome matches, the first one being the best match of the night, The Rock vs. Mankind for the wwf title, you got to admit, Vince is a genius, and second, Stone cold steve austin vs. Undertaker buried alive match.

998085,1,6305255210,"I can't recommend this video at all. Mark Henry/Dlo Brown vs. Val Venis/Godfather was a decent start but the match was really short. The Headbangers/Oddities match was pure crap. Owen Hart vs. Steve Blackman was solid but had a cheap ending that made Owen look weak in his home country. The Brood vs. Job Squad 6 man tag was very good and a definite match of the night. The Goldust vs. JJ match was decent but nothing special. The tag title match just flat out sucked. The world title match between The Rock and Mankind had some good action but the really cheap ending that made no sense ruined it. The main event which was the buried alive match between Austin and Undertaker turned out to be beyond horrible.

7886200,2,6305255210,"Like the other Attitude Collection DVD I have, Unforgiven 98, this one's DVD production quality is ""unforgiveable"" *gets pelted with rotten fruit* for its abysmal production.  Released in 2002, well into the WWF's DVD history releases, this one has NO chapters, NO menus, NO extras, NOTHING.  To get from one match to the next, you have to manually fast forward like a VHS.  At least in Unforgiven 98, they had a mid-way point in the event, essentially creating two 90 minute chapters in the 3 hour event.  This one had nothing.

The event itself was a lackluster one, especially by the WWF's ""Attitude Era"" standards.  By modern WWE standards, it would've been a spellbinding spectacle.

Val Venis and The Godfather vs D'Lo Brown and Mark Henry
This was a surprise, considering how little I think of all these superstars, and their initial fates in the WWF as low-card players most of their careers.  They did some good stuff, but nothing that was especially spectacular.  (6.5/10)

The Headbangers vs The Oddities
I was a wrestling fan since around early 2000 and as a child back then, I used to scour the depths of WWF.com's old video archive.  Along the way, I encountered these guys... The Oddities.  I knew of the Headbangers from my Wrestlemania 2000 game, as well as on TV, and so I knew what to expect.  What I did not expect was the odd show the Oddities put on, with the 7 foot Kurrgan, looking like a thick Russian guy trying to fit in with a strange group, the other 7+ foot Silva looking like a thick Italian guy trying to fit in with a strange group, and I was amused.  While not a great wrestler, Kurrgan had amazing ring presence and charisma, and Golga was surprising despite his size.  This match wasn't about wrestling, but rather entertainment.  (8/10)

Steve Blackman vs Owen Hart
This one was a boring match of locks, holds, fluffy light wrestling moves, and Owen Hart threatening to get counted out many times until he finally does get counted out.  Garbage at worst, below average at best.  (3/10)

The Brood vs The J.O.B. Squad
Like the Oddities vs Headbangers match, I knew of these groups from scouring the old archives of WWF.com and from my Wrestlemania 2000 video game.  I was surprised to see them in action (and to see 2 Cold Scorpio in the WWF) and they put on a great tag team match.  (7.5/10)

Striptease Match
Jeff Jarrett vs Goldust
Dull as dishwater is not an overstatement.  For some reason Goldust hasn't impressed me with any of his matches, and there was little that was good about this match.  Even the post-match striptease was something that would make little 12 year olds giggle and press against their doors so their parents wouldn't walk in.  (1/10)

WWF Tag Team Championship
The New Age Outlaws (C) vs The Big Boss Man and Ken Shamrock
For some reason, this one was terrible.  The Big Boss Man's performance was something mirroring the ghastly affair of the ""Kennel from Hell"" match with Al Snow, and more attention seemed to be focused on commissioner Shawn Michaels, being a former DX member, siding against the two DX members, the Road Dogg and Billy Gunn.  (3/10)

WWF Championship
Mankind vs The Rock (C)
Mick Foley isn't a great wrestler and neither is The Rock, but both have immense ring presence and charisma that more than makes up for it---it makes them superstars.  This match was not a show of this superstardom.  Perhaps because it was a lowly ""In Your House"" PPV, this match was sluggish and low, and the ending was just even more terrible, with Mankind winning but McMahon claiming that he knocked out The Rock, and thus The Rock still would hold the title.  (3/10)

Buried Alive Match
The Undertaker vs Stone Cold Steve Austin
This match went on too long, and had too little to offer in the way of entertainment or action.  Three times the two battled back and forth from the grave site to the ring, most of the time crawling around as if they were battering one another to bloody pulps.  Austin was filthy from rolling around half-naked in the dirt, and did little more than punches and kicks.  Boring, badly played out match that didn't impress nor did it entertain.  (0/10)

If it weren't for the shoddy DVD production, this would probably be a 3 star event, though not a very good one at that.",1185408000,,4265,4.62849533954727

I didn't like this match, it was way too slow. Headbangers win when Mosh gives Golga a crossbody.
