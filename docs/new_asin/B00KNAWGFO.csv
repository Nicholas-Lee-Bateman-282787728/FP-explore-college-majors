6434997,5,B00KNAWGFO,It's a fascinating brief documentary on Hitler's attempts to turn beautiful Nuremberg into a Nazi fantasy city with a preposterously large rally ground. One annoyance: German dialogue can be heard continuously while the words are translated into English.,1416355200,6,254,5.7105263157894735
6434998,4,B00KNAWGFO,"At the end of WW II, an American reporter called Nuremberg ""the holy shrine of the Nazis"".  Directed by German filmmaker Michael Kloft, this documentary film ""Fuhrer Cult and Megalomania"" examines the importance of Nuremberg as a political center and rallying point for Hitler and his regime. The film is one of a series of Kloft-directed documentaries about Hitler and the Third Reich.

Widely regarded as the most anti-Semitic city in Europe in the 1920s, Hitler chose Nuremberg as a center for party rallies based in part on the city's history in medieval times, on its accessibility, and on the facilities it already included for political rallies. The film documents the use of Nuremberg for party rallies beginning in 1927. By 1929, Hitler had formulated grandiose plans for Nuremberg. He directed a young architect, Albert Speer, to construct a series of structures that would glorify Hitler and the Reich.

This documentary uses a variety of sources including Leni Reifenstahl's famous propaganda film, ""Triumph of the Will"" from an eight-day party rally in 1934.  It also uses other Nazi propaganda footage and amateur footage, not previously available in documentaries. It uses footage from contractors at Nuremberg who documented their activities in order to be paid and footage from early television in the Nazi Germany of the mid-1930s. The film includes interviews with a historian from the Documentation Centre -- Nazi Party rallying grounds -- as well as with participants in activities at Nuremberg. English subtitles are provided. The film is narrated by a dramatic voiceover over a background of ominously pulsating music.

The film emphasizes the immensity of the proposed construction at Nuremberg which included a large stadium, a Congress Hall, a rallying field, Zepplin Field, a Great War Memorial, deployment areas for troops, a Great Road linking the facilities and more.  Most of the construction remained incomplete. Many of the buildings and stadiums were built under great time pressure to impress the masses. The construction frequently was shoddy and could not survive exposure to the elements. Much of the surviving elements are dilapidated or crumbling.

The film offers footage of each of the large rallies at Nuremberg including Hitler speeches and the promulgation of the Nuremberg Race Laws of 1935. During the war, a work camp for POWs was established at Nuremberg. The film shows how at the end of the war American soldiers destroyed a huge swastika over the stadium. The film also shows the current state of the structure and discusses controversy within Germany about what to do with the ruins and with the stadium. The Nuremberg War Crimes trials following the war are not mentioned in the film.

The film is well-presented and organized, and it is disturbing to watch. The material and subject are inherently sensationalistic. The film offers a good, chilling summary of the importance of Nuremberg to Nazi Germany.  The film is valuable for schools, libraries and other educational institutions as well as for individuals with a strong interest in documentaries of Nazi Germany.  The film is distributed by First Run Features which kindly sent me a DVD for review.

Total Time: 52 minutes

6435004,5,B00KNAWGFO,"Thought this was an excellent presentation.  I may not have enjoyed quite as much had I not just read Albert Speer's ""Inside the Third Reich"" in which he discussed many of the building challenges depicted in some detail in this film.  This film even shows some of the actual construction activities involved in building several of the major structures designed by Speer and others.  However, even without having read that book, this film is quite worth watching.",1448236800,9,462,4.974025974025974

6435007,5,B00KNAWGFO,Fascinating study of the dream stadium of the nazis.  What they planned to do was breathtaking in its audacity.  What is of great interest is the fact that Hitler did not appear to know how badly the beginning stages were built.

8660258,3,B00KNAWGFO,"Albert Speer sure fooled the tribunal at Nuremberg. Speer was as selfish as anyone of the Third Reich, but the tribunal bought his lies that he was a good Nazi. Speer ended the war and retained that wealth long after the war.",1478736000,2,225,4.380952380952381
