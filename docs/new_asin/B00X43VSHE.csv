8714957,5,B00X43VSHE,"This is a great film and always was - a real midnight sleeper style whammo illustration on how to do a punchy racing film on minimal budget - Ellen Burstyn has a cool role as a racer's girl, before she got big needless to say. Sid Haig smashes a car to ribbons, the rock music rips it all up good, and it makes The Fast and the Furious seem slow and mellow...The Arrow Blu-ray's a mind-blower - this is how black and white film was meant to look - holy christ, every frame is... framable.",1466985600,,488,4.147368421052631
8714958,5,B00X43VSHE,"Coming June 23rd from Arrow Films, we have a film by one of my favorite directors of all time, Mr. Jack Hill. As much as this is an atypical Jack Hill film, it also fits in perfectly with his oeuvre. Though not as sleazy (I use this word with only positive connotations when speaking of this great director's work) as some of his later films, Pit Stop is still an exploitation film. This time around, the theme is car racing and though the story is fairly straight forward, there is still the unmistakably brilliant characterization that Hill brings to the screenplay.

Pit Stop (or The Winner, as it was originally called) tells the story of loner and aspiring car racer Rick Bowman (Dick Davalos), who is spotted by sponsor Grant Willard (Brian Donlevy) and begins racing in the deadly Figure 8 race. He becomes rivals with Willard's cocky champion Hawk Sidney (Sid Haig) and soon the lines of hero and villain start to blur.

Pit Stop is like a long lost racing film that ranks up there with the best of the 60s. Richard ""Dick"" Davalos, better known as Aron from East of Eden (or as the guy on the cover of The Smiths' Strangeways Here We Come, Best of Vol. 1 and Best of Vol. 2 albums) is perfectly cast as the rebellious Rick Bowman. He probably has the single coolest haircut ever committed to film. Jack Hill regular Sid Haig is also perfect as Hawk Sidney. Ellen Burstyn makes her film debut here as one of the racer's wives. She is also a mechanic and cheats on her husband with Rick. Lastly, the pixie-like Beverly Washburn (who was also in Jack Hill's Spider Baby with Haig) is impressive and a little mysterious (how old was she?) as Rick's girlfriend Jolene. The story takes a lot of unexpected turns and characters are not always what they seem, another strength of Hill's. In my eyes, this one is a classic. Arrow's new Pit Stop Blu Ray/DVD combo is another Winner (no pun intended) from this UK company that recently came overseas to spread joy among sleazy little girls and boys. With a beautiful transfer supervised by Jack Hill himself and a bunch of bonus features (including a booklet! Yay!), this one should not be missed! Below is a list of bonus features included here:

-New High Definition digital transfer supervised and approved by director Jack Hill
-High Definition Blu-ray (1080p) and Standard Definition DVD presentation

8714959,4,B00X43VSHE,Pit Stop is a pretty cool Film about Racing cars on the track. The beginning of the film has that Fast and Furious feel to it story wise and the rest of the film heads of to a nice drama. Picture Quality looks pretty good and If your into film I would recommend this title form Arrow Films.,1447113600,,290,4.017241379310345

Its nice to see that many of the long neglected directors from the past are finally being recognized for the work they did. While many never had the opportunity to work in the major studios with mega-budgets, what they were able to achieve with nothing at all is remarkable. Among those directors of note is Jack Hill, a name few may recognize but whose movie titles you will. THE BIG DOLL HOUSE, THE BIG BIRD CAGE, COFFY, FOXY BROWN, THE SWINGING CHEERLEADERS and SWITCHBLADE SISTERS are among the movies that played drive-ins all across the country, each directed by Hill. And not another of his films makes its way to blu-ray courtesy of Arrow Video.

The story is fairly simple. A young up and coming street racers named Rick Bowman (Richard Davalos) catches the eye of racing investor Grant Willard (Brian Donlevy in his last performance). Grant posts bail for Rick when hes arrested for racing on the streets and takes him to the track he owns where they have a weekly figure eight contest.

Unaware of what that is, Rick watches as cars circle around on a figure eight track, nearly missing each other where it crosses or crashing spectacularly in the center. He thinks of it as madness but at the same time if he wins he could possibly get the backing of Grant for future endeavors more along the lines of standard stock car racing. He agrees and heads to a junk yard Grant directs him to.

At the yard Rick works out a deal with the owner to put together a car of his own. If he wins, he pays him off, if he loses he works it off in the yard. Of course his first race isn't near what he expected and he works to make another car. On the track he was taken out by the king of the sport, Hawk Sidney (Sid Haig), a cocky, crazy driver who thrills at the excitement on the track.

A competition develops between the two as well as bad feelings that result in an injury to Rick. They eventually settle their differences and finally their hard work pays off. Both are given the opportunity to race in an actual stock car race with Grant as their financial backer and professional Ed McLeod as their sponsor. But what will the result be with these hot headed, thrill seeking young men doing all that it takes to win?

The movie might sound like a typical drama but its more than that. The cinematography of the car competitions were shot at actual events that took place at an actual figure eight track. The acting by all involved is completely believable, something not usually found in a low budget film. Haig in particular does an outstanding job, showing talent that was wasted for years afterward by folks who pegged him as nothing more than a bad guy in film. And the heart of the story, about just what a person is willing to do to win makes this one much better than one would expect.

Arrow Video again tosses in some dynamite extras. Included are interviews with Hill and Haig, a short piece on the restoration of the film, an interview with producer Roger Corman and more. Online there are more than one version of this film to be had, another on its way from Kino Lorber soon, but I have to say that with all the extras included this one would be the way to go.

Better than you would expect, this is a movie that would make for a fun evenings entertainment and might even be a hoot to couple with any number of racing or biker movies to make a double feature of it, just like the old days at the drive in.",1438300800,3,3476,4.3782945736434105
8714961,3,B00X43VSHE,"Pit Stop is set against the world of smack em up Figure 8 drag racing, a high risk competition in which cars race wildly, trying to gain any advantage by slamming their cars into one another. The intersection of the 8 is especially dangerous as cars have to navigate oncoming cars while trying to keep their speed up. The race sequences are expertly filmed, edited to maximize thrills, and very exciting.

The story, unfortunately, is fairly routine. Grant Willard (Brian Donlevy) is the head of a racing team who picks young drivers he feels have the potential to win. He takes rookie driver Rick Bowman (Dick Davalos, East of Eden) under his wing and grooms him for entry into the racing circuit. The arrogant driver Hawk Sidney (Sid Haig) is their nemesis, as he tries to undermine Willards team both on and off the track. A few romantic subplots are tossed in more to fill time than to add substance.

Performances are wooden and the direction by Jack Hill (Coffy, Foxy Brown) uninspired. The movie drags when the scene shifts away from the track for half-hearted character development. Donlevys career dates back to the silent era and Pit Stop was his last feature film (he died in 1972). He looks uncomfortable in most of his scenes, as if wondering How did I get involved in this? Davalos shows little range, trying to channel a James Dean vibe but coming up short. Ellen Burstyn (billed as Ellen McRae) appears in a small part, just three years before starring in The Exorcist. Also starring is Beverly Washburn, whose face  if not her name  is probably known by thousands of Baby Boomers from her numerous TV appearances as a child actor in the 50s and 60s. She plays Jolene, a sort of race track groupie who takes a romantic fancy to Rick.

Blu-ray bonus features include audio commentary by director Jack Hill;  interview with Roger Corman discussing his involvement with Pit Stop;
making-of featurette; reminiscences by actor Sid Haig; a restoration demonstration by James White, who supervised the restoration of Pit Stop; reversible sleeve featuring original and newly commissioned art work; and a collectors booklet.",1435449600,3,2131,4.87292817679558
8714962,5,B00X43VSHE,Screencaps don't lie and the verdict is in - the cheaper 1-disc Officially Licensed Definitive Edition (with Roger Corman Presents banner) has far superior contrast and detail to the more expensive 2-disc Jack Hill Directors edition offered by a different company.  Get this cheaper Code Red/Kino version for the best value and best picture quality for this highly entertaining Roger corman movie!,1434326400,5,397,5.403225806451613
8714963,5,B00X43VSHE,"Despite what the previous reviewer has written about the other version that is available from Code Red, this is BY FAR the superior version. As I understand it, this 2K scan comes from director Jack Hill's answer print of the film and Arrow has done an exhaustive restoration of the film. You can see for yourself by going to YouTube and view Arrow Video's video they have posted regarding the restoration. It's beautiful and the film has never looked better. This Arrow Video ""2-Disc Director Approved Authorized Special Edition"" comes with the film on both Blu-ray and DVD, a heavy duty clear case, a booklet featuring photos and an essay, reversible artwork and more. In addition to the movie Arrow Video's disc is LOADED with special features (the other version features a paltry two featurettes) as well. Typically, Arrow's collectible films have a high $39.95 SRP price point (on par with Criterion and if you ask me, a little high for my liking), however their release of Pit Stop comes with a much more reasonable $29.95 SRP (likely due to the fact there's more than one version in the marketplace), but a great entry price none the less for any collector that hasn't sampled any of Arrow Video's releases. At the time I am writing this, Amazon has Arrow Video's version sale priced at $18.99 ($4 less than the Code Red Version). If you are thinking about buying this movie (and you should... it's a cult classic), ARROW VIDEO'S ""PIT STOP"" is the version you want! Collectible presentation (case, booklet, reversible artwork), a bevy of special features and a cheaper price. Think no further.",1433635200,14,1600,4.843065693430657
8714964,4,B00X43VSHE,"Get the Code Red/Kino version as it comes from the original camera negative. Great movie. One of the best films about the world of stock car racing/figure 8 racing.

P.S. it looks like Amazon has done it again as far as lumping two different companies releases into the same comments. You want the Version that has the grey/silver banner that says ""Roger Corman Presents"" on it. That version comes from the original camera negative.",1433635200,11,432,4.837837837837838
