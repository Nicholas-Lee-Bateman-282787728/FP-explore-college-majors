8392632,2,B0039ZCHKY,"The only reason to film a production of Cavalleria Rusticana and Pagliacci with singers who don't look or act the parts very well is if one has spectacular voices in a credible performance. This production has mediocre singers who don't look or act the parts particularly well and who are therefore not terribly believable. This Cavalleria comes across as a dark and unmotivated melodrama that does not ever grab one's interest. The Pagliacci is somewhat better although I must say that Jos Cura's portrayal of Canio makes the clown look like a mental defective what with his gibbering and nonsensical attempts at humor. And unfortunately Cura's formerly athletic appearance has run to fat. None of this would matter, of course, if Seor Cura had a voice, but he really doesn't these days, if he ever truly did. As for the two divas involved -- Paoletta Marrocu as Santuzza  and Fiorenza Cedolins as Nedda -- the voices are squally, unevenly produced and frankly difficult to listen to. Carlo Guelfi sings a credible Tonio and Cheyne Davidson a reasonably good Alfio. Mamma Lucia, as sung by Irne Friedli, is a cipher. It doesn't help that the audio engineering is also not very good.

There are excellent DVDs of the Cav/Pag double bill out there -- the one with Plcido Domingo, for instance -- and thus this issue is a poor also-ran.
