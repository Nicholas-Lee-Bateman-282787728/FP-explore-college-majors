However, we've been making our way through and have gotten to a disk (disk 12) that is rather scratched and we've had issues with skipping on just about every episode on that disk, to the point where the end of some of them won't even play.  There is really no excuse for a new DVD to skip as much as this one is.  I can understand a few little moments here and there but it's extremely frustrating.",1510531200,2,557,4.177570093457944

2677431,3,B000JLTE4S,"Mill creek compressed this from Sony's 20 disc to 16 for this set . There also seems to be a few edited episodes accordion to some reviews as well as one person posted the missing clips on youtube , He said they got taken down . Why is it that they won't let us see the cut parts ? This set is begging for a complete restored bluray from the original 35mm negatives . There's plenty of demand . 3 stars because the original Sony dvds are of better quality . There's no reason to buy this if your looking for the best picture available till a bluray comes out . And that is a double edge sword . If you don't buy this set then clearly the label will care less about anything for the future and buying it does you no good .",1463529600,,721,3.9793103448275864

2677576,1,B000JLTE4S,"If you are planning on watching these on a screen larger than 24 inches go with the Original DVD's. The bit rate is very low on these as a result they look horrible in comparison to the original DVD's on a decent sized screen. After seeing how bad these looked I returned them and then got the original sets for only $7-9 each and they look infinitely better than the Mill Creeks.  The originals had no jerky movements during fast moving scenes and no pixalation.

To any that think the Creeks look good, please compare them next to the original DVD issues and be prepared to get blown away by the quality of the older discs because in comparison the differences are jarring.",1426377600,24,675,4.479674796747967

First off each individual disc was packaged inside of paper sleeves which made it almost impossible to keep it organized well. I wish they would have charge a few dollars more and made separate plastic sleeves inside of the case. My other problem was there was no subtitles which means I have to have the volume higher to hear and the gunfights about pop my eardrums!",1426291200,,543,4.551020408163265

2677613,5,B000JLTE4S,"I picked this up at Best Buy for 24 dollars.  I figured it was a very convenient size and might be an upgrade from the previous season releases that I have not watched in some time but remembered as less than impressive.  Here's the update ...
If you have the original 4 seasonal releases, keep em. They are better.  They contain the series on 20 discs and this has them all on only 16 .. so some extra compression has taken place. ALSO , the original season one has some additional features and interviews with the stars that this bare bones stripped down release does not.  Some of the later shows on this issue do not even feature chapter stops... it's just 1 and done.

I'm giving it a five star review because at 77 hours of Starsky and Hutch (it was a great show in it's day) for 25 bucks all in one handy little box ..... it would be stupid to rate it less.  Would I like the Batman Blu Ray treatment?  All four seasons digitally remastered and hours of bonus features... yes... is it going to happen... no.  When this company (Mill Creek)gets a series the studio that backed it has given up... they've done what they can and let it go so to speak.  If you have the original seasons, keep em... no need to upgrade, because it's not. I just popped one of season 4 in ... the model is played by Maude Adams and the creepy photographer Jeffrey Tambor ... that is typical casting for this show , one time stars and future ones colliding on scripts written by future giants like Michael Mann no less!",1416528000,41,1502,4.297872340425532

2677619,3,B000JLTE4S,Its about two undercover cops with a cranky Captain and a jive talking informant. This show is from Aaron Spelling which means you will need to suspend disbelief when it comes to actual police procedure before you can enjoy the camaraderie between the two leads.  Starsky is all swagger and Hutch is quietly cool and there is a lot of jumping over car hoods and onto car roofs and tires squealing and of course the red Torino with the fancy white stripe.  A prime example of 70's television.,1406246400,,491,4.568181818181818

Also, there are no chapters on each episode, so you can't skip around. It goes right back to the menu page. No skipping the credits, etc. There aren't any extras, either.
