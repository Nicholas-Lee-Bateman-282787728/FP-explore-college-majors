5140807,5,B0089AJDYM,"Being from that city to the north, I found this series absolutely hilarious -- not necessarily in a laugh out loud way, but in a clever, aha-yes! way.",1360713600,2,150,4.392857142857143
5140808,5,B0089AJDYM,This show is very smart. I cannot wait for fridays when the new episodes come on.  I give the actors a lot of credit for all they do.,1360368000,,133,3.75
5140809,5,B0089AJDYM,This item was in PERFECT condition! I have not had a single problem with it! No scratches AND brand new in package !,1360022400,,116,4.086956521739131
5140810,3,B0089AJDYM,"Funny- oh so do like the premise!-
So Very Saturday Night Live! But in Portland.
Best a few skits at a time: relentless",1359849600,,119,4.217391304347826
5140811,5,B0089AJDYM,"The DVDs were well protected and in tact.  They play well.  This is a great comic show. Fred and Carrie are extremely talented and brilliant in a comic style reminiscent of Tracy Ulman  , The Kids In The Hall  and a little (benign) splash oh Sasha Cohen Baren (Borat).  My boyfriend and I are addicted to this show!",1357776000,4,315,4.362068965517241
5140812,5,B0089AJDYM,I live in Portland Oregon and I bought this for my sister who lives in Seal Beach CA.  She loved it and laughed out loud!,1357689600,,121,3.84
5140813,4,B0089AJDYM,Great set.  This is one of our favorite TV shows and we are so happy to have both seasons to watch anytime we want (since the show does not play repeat on TV often).  This is not really a cohesive set since both cases are different sizes and materials but it's not really an issue.,1356652800,,281,4.090909090909091
5140814,1,B0089AJDYM,"Another reviewers had it correct. This box set is a trick. While the picture makes it looks like a normal, two-box set, in reality it's one normal set and shoddy paper envelope type thing. I mean really, why do I want to pay for a series set that's going to get scratched just from me pulling it out of the box. So disappointing.",1355011200,19,329,4.238095238095238
5140815,5,B0089AJDYM,Very funny show. Love the scenery an the actors. Ready to go back to Portland! Looking forward for the new season.,1351987200,,114,4.476190476190476
5140816,2,B0089AJDYM,"Season 1 is in a standard DVD box.  Season 2 is in a cardboard digi-pack of different height/width than that of a standard box, and it's thinner than it appears in the picture.  It's not exactly a matching set.  They are packaged together with a strip of paper around them, and shrink-wrapped. When mine arrived, the Season 2 digi-pack was bending under the pressure of the shrink-wrap.",1351468800,20,386,4.731343283582089

5140828,5,B0089AJDYM,Too strange and funny for words.,1404518400,,32,4.5
5140829,3,B0089AJDYM,"Yes I live in Portland and have for over a decade and yes I am a huge fan of Portlandia. As for this two season disc pack I give it a so-so because the first season comes in a flimsy cardboard dvd box which is not the sellers fault but I still don't like it. It also took this set an infuriatingly long time to come in the mail. It took so long I actually forgot I ordered it until I got an email from the seller saying it had just shipped. When the seller kindly reminded me of a purchase made several weeks ago I was pi$$ed, but it had already shipped and I wanted it so what are you going to do.

The set did show up (finally) though and they where in perfect condition and at a price more reasonable then I was finding anywhere else so it's a little give and take here.",1398988800,,773,3.9235668789808917
5140830,5,B0089AJDYM,"We recently visited Portland area twice and were really struck with the ""culture"".  Portlandia really struck a cord with us and it is a blast to watch.",1397260800,,151,4.592592592592593
5140831,5,B0089AJDYM,"I just randomly got these episodes to see the show for the first time because I love the northwest and found them quite entertaining and hilarious.  I enjoy sharing the show with friends introducing them to Portlandia, especially after my visit there just months after initially seeing this.",1391126400,,291,5.0625
5140832,5,B0089AJDYM,Unless I missed something (maybe Upright Citizen's Brigade?) this is the funniest sketch comedy since SCTV and In Living Color.,1390780800,,127,5.4
5140833,5,B0089AJDYM,"IS AWESOME!
I don't think ive ever laughed as hard as i did with any show, it pulls you right in wanting more and more. Might rewatch it again tonight now! c:",1387929600,,158,3.96875
5140834,5,B0089AJDYM,"the packaging is not an issue for me.  this show is hilarious and smart...even sweet sometimes. if you like quirky comedy, buy it.",1387756800,2,130,4.6521739130434785
5140835,5,B0089AJDYM,"Portlandia reminds me so much of the truly inane things about Seattle. It could be called ""Seattle-landia"" and be perfectly right on. I love this program. It's VERY quirky. Very funny. Great cast and random story lines that can be simultaneously hilarious and serious.  Also, some truly surprising guests appear in this show. Enjoy!",1386115200,,332,5.148148148148148
5140836,5,B0089AJDYM,"These guys are comic geniuses.  This collection is one of my favorite sources of laughs.  I hereby declare that they are NOT allowed to EVER cancel this show.

Note to the producers, if you cancel this show I will find out where you live and I will send an angry cyclist with an accordion to camp out on your front lawn and torment you day and night with his ranting (and his off key accordion playing)... so don't even think about it!!!!!!",1384214400,,440,4.341463414634147
5140837,4,B0089AJDYM,"I purchased this because I saw a snippet of a show and started laughing almost immediately...the show is hilarious, involves sketches shot entirely on location in Portland, starring Fred Armisen (Saturday Night Live) and Carrie Brownstein. The two are writers of the comic sketches and also star in the show. Carrie is a talented musician as well, earning her the distinction of having become the only female guitarist to be recognized in the top ""25 most underrated guitarists"" list, in 2006.

Produced by Lorne Michaels, this DVD has series featuring Kyle MacLachlan (Twin Peaks, Sex and the City), Aubrey Plaza (Parks and Recreation), Selma Blair (Legally Blonde), Heather Graham (the Hangover), Jason Sudeikis (SNL), Gus Van Sant (Milk), and singer/songwriters Aimee Mann and Sarah McLachlan.

The sketches are creative and fast-moving, if you love edgy comedy, Portlandia is great fun!",1379462400,,890,5.35
5140838,5,B0089AJDYM,I loved watching each n' every episode of this!  Portlandia is both quirky & hysterical...  I love both Fred Armisted and Carry Brownstein in all their various incarnations.,1377907200,,173,5.142857142857143
5140839,5,B0089AJDYM,when it came it was exactly what i bought and in one piece.  this is a great show so funny! Thanks!,1377043200,,99,3.7142857142857144

8526196,5,B0089AJDYM,"This series would have to be Rated H for Hilarious.
How these two keep the humor rolling is anyone's guess but they have modern culture down so well it makes for a good chuckle or guffaw.
Their take on middle-class behavior in regards to personal or to child relationship is so darn accurate you can't not be impressed (check out the pre-school child admission graph the parents use - with his Trademarked Christian name).
When the two have to go to sunny SoCal and have a bad reaction to the sun so buy body-covering Muslim outfits AND THEN WALK AROUND the town I couldn't stop myself from rolling on the floor.
The Women and Women Bookshop regular is hilarious when the unknowing air conditioner repairer calls them both Sweetie AND Ma'am. AND he says UNIT.
Another single star reviewer wrote that you have to 'get the humor'. Well, yes, you do; you've also actually have to HAVE a sense of humor.

Every episode is extremely funny and DEFINITELY worth the moolah.",1528156800,,966,4.649122807017544
8526197,3,B0089AJDYM,"meh - I am all for irony, and generally like the actors who star in this series - but it is a lot to take - can only watch one or two episodes before I need more 'mainstream' humor",1458777600,,180,3.641025641025641

8526200,4,B0089AJDYM,"This show is hilarious!  It is especially funny to someone like me who has lived in Portland.  I had seen the show before moving there and didn't find it that funny, but after living there I was laughing out loud at how hilariously true to Portland this show is.",1453420800,,262,4.326530612244898
8526201,4,B0089AJDYM,"This isn't a sitcom. It's a sitscom. It doesn't deal with a single set of characters or situation. It introduces a lot of characters and situations during a single episode.

Here's the scoop. Portland, in all it's quirky, counter-culture weirdity (is that a word?) is lampooned by the likes of Fred Armisen and Carrie Brownstein who play a number of different characters in as many situations that show that those dwelling in the counter culture can be pretty strange.

What a hoot and what a great idea. Traditional sitcoms, even great ones, can ware out their welcome after a few seasons. Using this format, the viewer is always on their toes in trying to keep the characters straight and seeing how they navigate extreme extrapolations of subjects regarding ""organic"" food, coffee, music, women's rights and a plethora of other subjects. Armisen and Brownstein work well with one another and just seem to fit into the various situations really well.

This is some very funny stuff, and it's consistently funny. It IS done on the cheap. To help keep costs down, they seem to give local residents non-speaking roles. They are very ""normal"" looking and rarely do more than nod a response. But there are consistent cameo appearances by the likes of Kyle MacLachlan, Chloe Sevigny, Jeff Goldblum and others. I'm guessing these folk all liked working the project.

This is some whacky stuff. If you like your entertainment way left of center you'll be overjoyed while viewing this.",1452816000,,1478,4.94758064516129
8526202,5,B0089AJDYM,Excellent,1450224000,,9,9.0
8526203,5,B0089AJDYM,"Arrived on time. Would order again from this company. Funny skits. A few not suitable for younger audience. We are still on the first DVD from season 1 and are really enjoying them. If your vegan, organic, or into sustainablity you will particularly get a kick out of them.",1444694400,,273,4.591836734693878
