Music: Sun zara!!! The rest - not so good.

About actors: Salman - only  presented on the screen (did not try),

Sneha - tried, but here... newcomer is newcomer (yet),

MITHUN - ABSOLUTLY AWESOME!!! (Mimoh, lucky is you! :))) Only at him  it's possible to look in this film! It's sheer pleasure!!! I have bought this film only because of DADA. And because of absolutely unforgettable month of shootings!",1132012800,3,628,4.603603603603603

8062714,3,B0009KNNVY,"I love bollywood films but this was not like the ones I've come to love.  The whole plot of war in Russia was a mess. And the odd character of RD.  What the heck?  Also, I was so tired of hearing Adi's name throughout the film.  The most realistic part was Adi's love of his car.  Now that's sad...",1496016000,,298,3.983050847457627
8062715,4,B0009KNNVY,"I ended up liking this movie a lot more then I thought I would. One reviewer called it a gentle love story and I think that's a great description. I think the age difference between the characters is more problematic for viewers now then even when this movie first came out because of the massive attention (rightfully) being given to child abuse issues 24/7. I loved loved loved Dirty Dancing, in which the characters have about the same age difference as the ones in this movie, but when I watch it now with the view of the world we have it's not quite as charming. It does not help that the girl who is quite beguiling with her big beautiful innocent eyes has a little child's voice through the entire thing-that without a doubt makes it a bit disturbing. However that being said, the love story between her and ""Adi"" is an innocent one and him falling for her doesn't feel pervy so I ended up really enjoying this. On top of that the movie has some pretty catchy music as well.",1489536000,,981,4.395604395604396
8062716,4,B0009KNNVY,"In Russia, 17-year-old Lucky, an Indian diplomat's daughter, is the victim of an attempted rape on her way to school  By a happy accident, she falls in with Adi, the adult child of another Indian diplomat.  At a checkpoint, they find themselves in the midst of an attack by rebels and must hide.  What follows is a series of narrow escapes and exciting adventures.

The plot is improbable, yes, but does that make it any less enjoyable?  Not a whit.  The gentle, growing romance between the two was strangely moving, and I found it easy to suspend belief for the entirety of their experiences.  Salman Khan was fantastic; I was completely won over by his character.  This was  Sneha Ullal's first movie, and it showed, but despite her whiny voice she did a fine job of portraying a frightened teen in over her head.  The musical numbers were gorgeous, and the action scenes well-done.

I was totally immersed in the drama--as silly as it was--and got 5 stars worth of enjoyment out of it, and plan to watch it again.  Sneha Ullal's' inappropriately childish voice is the only thing keeping it from a 5 star review.",1489190400,,1114,4.627551020408164

8062720,4,B0009KNNVY,"This movie was really enjoyable almost all the way. It is about Indian school girl (17 years old) Lucky (Sneha Ullal who bears an uncanny resemblance to Aishwarya Rai Bachchan)) who is living in Russia as her father is a diplomat.
Her name is either accurate or ironic. Insurrection happens around Moscow and she gets caught up in it. She is lucky to find another Indian and son of the ambassador Adi (Salman Khan) and their attempts to rejoin the consulate staff (who are being sent home to India for their safety) begins. On their trail to retrieve them is Mithun Chakraborty as a disguise changing retired colonel. Now she is either very lucky in excaping one difficult situation after another - or very unlucky for drawing herself into so many such situations. Along the way Lucky and Adi bond closer.
For me the bonding was the only reason I had a problem with the movie. Not because two people with an actual 22 year age gap couldn't fall in love but Salman looked just far too old for a school girl and one who was being very childlike and girly.
However (and it's a big however) the Russian settings include some magnificent interiors and exteriors and it's quite a different location to use. The music has a lot going for it too. So it can be quite beautiful and the story is an engaging one.
For those that don't like violence there is a lot of symbolic shooting at times but there's not a lot of focus on anything too graphic. It is more a background to what is happening. Even though the focus is on the leading pair, it wasn't so much a romance as an adventure tale.
I quite liked this one (in fact more than I expected to). Elsewhere on the Net it tend to score around average but I'd rate it above average for my taste.",1240012800,4,1734,4.404984423676012
8062721,5,B0009KNNVY,"This video provides excellent music and a wonderful display of a young girl's sudden maturation. A great cast and can't wait for the soundtrack. The on-location scenery was true-to-form. The new star, Sneha Ullal, will have a bright future in the movie industry. Salman Khan does his normal standout performance. I am touched by the symbolism shown in many Hindi movies of duality. You will see many touching scenes that are later

repeated by the opposite party, and to great effect. This is one reason that a movie like this must be viewed several times to get the full effect of it. The music was both modern and thrilling in its melody. The plot developed quickly and maintained interest throughout.",1138147200,3,703,4.858333333333333
