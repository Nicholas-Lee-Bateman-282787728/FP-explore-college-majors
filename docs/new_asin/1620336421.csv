7800517,5,1620336421,"Loved it. So many things are much clear more clear. This is the one stitch that I was so afraid of but no more. The only thing I wish she would have done was used black and white beads which would have made it more easy to see. However, I do love the DVD. Thanks to Marcia for sharing her gift.",1404691200,4,294,3.8360655737704916
