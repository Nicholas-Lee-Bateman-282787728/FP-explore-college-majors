510442,1,6302768063,"Horrible film.  A ""psychological thriller?""  So weird and disturbing,  but there  is  no psychology  going  on  here. No insights  or  depth.  Just ugly.

The film is  not homophobic as one reviewer stated.  It  does not advocate bullying or gay bashing.  Its just bad.",1455321600,,269,4.906976744186046

510449,1,6302768063,Just an idiotic presentation any way you look at it.  The dialog is practically non-existent and so is the plot.  While the general idea of quirky plot may have been fine in the planning stages there is just one problem.  1.  The movie is boring and 2.  Literally nothing happens.  I have heard this rational in movie reviews before but this is the first time I have actually seen it in practice.  Quite unintentionally everyone wanders around in search of an exit until the movie finally ends.  The one small mercy is at least the film is short.,1277856000,,546,4.5
510555,1,6302768063,"Sometimes a director is infatuated so much with his subtext that he forgets to pay attention to the actual front line of the story. ""To Play Or To Die"" suffers from this particular syndrome. There is very little that we know about the protagonist or the antagonist. Kees is shy, likes gymnastics, and he obviously is a good student. Charel is a bully.

The interaction between the two characters is reduced solely to Kees staring meaningfully at Charel, with Charel usually staring back for a moment before bullying Kees. The director uses protracted silences as a device by which he seeks to raise the tension between the characters, but in the end he does very little with it. The climax and finale consist of a series of events that lack coherence or connection:

======================

(Spoilers)

======================

Charel beats Kees up, Kees has an emotional crisis and cries, then he masturbates (non-explicitly), at which point he begins to have aural and visual hallucinations, during which he launches himself down a flight of stairs and dies.  There is no prior hint of Kees' instability at all during the rest of the movie, so this schizophrenic break comes across as a forced attempt to reach an excessively tragic ending towards which there had been no previous buildup.

======================

(END Spoilers)

======================

All in all, the movie feels terribly forced and although it has potential, eventually it cannot live up to the expectations it sets up. It isn't even much of a tragedy because for tragedies to be emotionally engaging, you usually need to feel something for the characters in question.",1267401600,3,1640,5.108614232209738

510557,5,6302768063,"This film is not exactly what I expected, but even though I was a little disappointed, I liked the film. It's the story of a young gay man named Kees (the adorable Geert Hunserts) who is bullied by his all boy dutch school mates for being gay.  He sets out to lure the ringleader of his bullies for a little one-on-one. His aim is to make Charel either love him or fight him. Hunserts give a shining performance and shows off a little more of his talents as well in a locker room scene. Great casting, superb acting, unusual plot but it will hold your attention. I could have written a better ending but all in all, I liked it and highly recommend it.",1160870400,2,651,4.25

510560,3,6302768063,"TO PLAY OR TO DIE
[Spelen of Sterven]

(Netherlands - 1990)

Aspect ratio: 1.66:1
Theatrical soundtrack: Mono

Frank Krom's impressively doom-laden Dutch drama - based on a short story by Anna Blaman, and running a mere 49 minutes - first appeared on VHS along with two other gay shorts under the umbrella title BOYS ON FILM VOL. 2., before being released on DVD by indie distributor Water Bearer. The film is a grim, unyielding examination of teenage emotions, played out against the stark backdrop of a Dutch boys' school.

Krom's screenplay focuses on the plight of Kees (Geert Hunaerts), a bright, handsome kid, crippled by shyness, whose life is devastated by a group of school bullies. Nevertheless, Kees is attracted to the ringleader Charel (Tjebbo Gerritsma), a beautiful thug whose macho posturing is little more than a show for his like-minded circle of friends. Kees invites him back to his (Kees') home when his parents are away, ostensibly to take revenge and seduce the older boy, but Charel's inability to drop the pretence and succumb to Kees' infatuation leads to a painful conclusion for them both. Or does it?

Beautifully photographed in muted colors by Nils Post (an accomplished cinematographer who also shot the highly controversial FOR A LOST SOLDIER in 1992), the film takes place in an emotionally desolate world where the characters are unable to connect with one another in any kind of meaningful context. Gerritsma and Hunaerts are superb as tormentor and tormented, respectively, with Hunaerts in particular giving a truly committed performance, especially towards the end of the film during a moment of (non-explicit, non-salacious) sexual candor.

TO PLAY OR TO DIE is NOT homophobic, as some have suggested; it's simply unwilling to play the Hollywood game of providing its viewers with easy answers and a neat resolution. Gay filmmakers have a responsibility to depict the broad range of experiences which affect their community, and that means confronting the harsh realities of their daily lives as well as their triumphs over adversity. Some gay men are driven to tragic extremes by circumstances beyond their control, and failure to address these issues on film would make for a very one-sided view of an extremely complex subject. As such, the film may not be a pleasant experience for some, but it dares to be bleak and uncompromising when others might have hidden behind wish-fulfilment fantasies. That's honesty, not homophobia.

In any event, Krom's rich visual style distinguishes the film from many of its American counterparts, and the expert editing (by Krom and Sander Vos) maintains a keen sense of rhythm amidst the slow-burning tensions inherent in the drama. Incredibly, Krom (who was once an assistant to Paul Verhoeven) doesn't appear to have directed anything since, and his subsequent involvement in filmmaking has been relegated to technical support only. That's a real shame, because TO PLAY OR TO DIE seemed to herald a bright new talent on the European movie scene, especially in light of the New Queer Cinema movement which emerged from the US shortly after this film was made, boosting the production of gay-themed movies on an international scale.",975024000,41,3211,5.139846743295019

510562,4,6302768063,"I thought To play or to die was an exelent movie, wich caught my attention fully. Great performances of the young actors and beautifuly filmed. I didn't consider it to be homophobic, but more as a tragedy of a young guy  who is caught in complete loneliness, fighting his way out. Having no  friends at all, the beautiful and at the same time brutal guy from his  class is his only challenge. I can recommend this film strongly.",955670400,14,428,4.461538461538462

7831066,5,6302768063,"This film is a small masterpiece.  To discover it is to believe again in a cinematic art that can hint at the truth about a delicate topic, not cover it over or moralize to make its audience feel ""progressive.""  Every detail of sound and image contributes to its painful poetry.  The director sees the male-adolescent  struggle in its essence, without sentimentality or social bias.  The Gothic effects are gradually heightened so as to present a psychological reality otherwise unbearable.
""To Play or To Die"" is not for viewers looking for entertainment or confirmation of contemporary sexual ideology.",1478563200,,604,5.185567010309279

The acting is amazing, the photography is beautiful; what can be done with light and shadows really catches your eye. The storyline is  both intriguing and disturbing as it must, being about a shy boy bullied at school who brings the bully leader to his grand, dark mysterious home, but for what reason. It is that unknown that keeps tension at a very high level.  Leave it to Amsterdam to bring us this film, it could never be made in the US. Obviously it is only for a small market given its percentage of 1 ratings. But if you fall into that market, you might like this a lot.",1456012800,2,672,4.2421875
