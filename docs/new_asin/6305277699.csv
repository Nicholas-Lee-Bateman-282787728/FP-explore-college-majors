1003396,4,6305277699,"On its own merits, ""Neighbourhood Watch"" is good fun.  Certainly more creative than the average American game show, the basic gist is that studio audience members' houses might be paid a surprise visit by Dame  Edna's caustic wit.  That wit is, as ever, powered by a profound sense of  moral superiority, especially on issues of ""propriety"".  If  you're still trying to envision where the humor is, imagine Dana Carvey's  Church Lady hosting the Dating Game and you'll basically be there.
But  at the same time, the show worked in Britain because people already knew  much of the backstory of Dame Edna's fictional life.  Edna has appeared on  and off British and Australian TV for decades.  If you're new to her, this  show won't do much to amplify your understanding of why the audience  sometimes laughs a little too hard at things Edna says.  The Edna  character has a long, rich history which isn't really explored here.  Indeed, it would even be fair to say that this is a caricature of Edna, and  doesn't do much to add to the persona.  It's not meant to, of course, but  first time viewers may well find themselves scratching their heads over why  the audience thinks Edna, and in particular Edna's relationship with her  Vanna-esque sidekick Madge,  is soooooo funny.
It's a shame Amazon  isn't able to stock more Edna products, because this is the most derivitve  Edna out there.  Edna's stuff from the 1980s is entirely more satisfying.  Still, this thing works so well purely on its own merits as a game show  that you can't help but laugh as you watch it--even if you don't quite know  why you're laughing.",949795200,3,1619,4.723021582733813
1003397,5,6305277699,"Everyones favorite Mega-star (that cares) is at her humorous best in this collection of videos. This is literally a comedy concept in the guise of a game show. Unwitting housewives comprise the audience of this show, and one  horrified member of the group is ""lucky"" enough to win the honor  of having her home invaded via a live video crew. Madge, the haunting  bridesmaid guides us as all stops are pulled out and very knook &  cranny of the house is probed by Edna's (suportive, yet critical) eye. This  collection of volumes is far superior to its follow up (V 4-6). Get it now  and you too will be mesmorized by the Grand Dame of Comedy!",948326400,3,642,4.491379310344827

I can't remember when I laughed this hard, and pull it out when  I am feeling a little blue to cheer myself up.  From the gum on the hutch  to the erotic dining room, you will laugh yourself silly!  I want more!",945216000,9,362,4.114285714285714
1003399,5,6305277699,Dame Edna's neighbourhood watch is well worth the money. It's one of the most imaginative TV shows you'll ever see. Her wit is at top form here. You'll laugh and laugh and cry for more when it's finished. Why in the  world this show was never brought to the US I'll never know. Dame Edna's  humor must be just too sophisticated for a wide US audience. You have to  listen closely and be really sharp to get all the inside jokes. This tape  will become one of your favorites. Buy it will confidence that your money  will be well spent!,942710400,11,534,4.3

I'm not sure if this is an original concept, but it is a SCREAM nonetheless.  Barry Humphries, Dame Edna, does a grand job with costume, wit, audience interaction, humor and even wrote the theme song.  His facial expressions and comedic timing are unmatched!
He takes unsuspecting ladies from the audience, who think they are going to play a quiz show about houses, and actually takes the viewers on a LIVE TOUR of the interior of their homes.  It's a riot!!  The show gets permission from the ""sneaky"" husband and they film while the wife is away.  All the dirty laundry, and YES, there is some of that, is aired!!
I haven't watched Part II yet, but I can't wait.  From the reviews I've read, Part II is even more funny!  My stomach may never recover.
Bottom line:  $26.00 is a bit expensive for a DVD, but the comedic SHOCK value is priceless....and with six episodes for DVD, think of it as a little over four bucks a show...a good value for all the laughs!",1065312000,5,1014,4.502732240437158
1003485,5,6305277699,"I recently bought a copy of this dvd and I'm so glad I did.  I've been a fan of Dame Edna's for quite some time and have enjoyed her on TV (on Fox's ""Ally McBeal"" and her short lived show in the late 90s) and on the printed page (her autobiograpy is a hoot!).  This dvd doesn't disappoint a true Dame Edna fan.  This hilarious British game show puts the self appointed ""spin doctor to the Queen of England"" in her best element.  Taking stunned housewives on a unexpected tour of their home while giving hilarious observations in her usual sharp tongue, this Dame delivers true comedy.  Her ""interesting"" choices in fashion and her wonderful facial expressions only add to the fun.  I'm definitely gonna get the 1st one too.  If its half as funny as this one, it'll be worth the price.",1035849600,7,784,4.440559440559441
1003486,5,6305277699,"It takes a lot to make me laugh these days, as I think I've become jaded in my old age (35).  However, this was the funniest thing I have seen in years!  Dame Edna is unbelievably qick-witted:  Upon finding Vaseline stored in a kitchen cupboard with two rolling pins:  ""I don't believe I know THAT recipe!"".
The whole premise of this game show is perfectly suited to Dame Edna's whacky sense of humor, and her facial expressions are hysterical, to say the least.  I ended up buying this because it showed up at Amazon.com as a recommendation for me because I bought both currently available French & Saunders DVDs.  Although I was quite amused by the F&S DVDs, this British import really hit the spot.  After watching the first Neighborhood Watch episode on the DVD (there are 6 total episodes), I thought that the novelty would wear off pretty quickly.  I was wrong.  Each episode will have you glued to the TV, laughing from start to finish.  I can't wait to share it with friends.",1026345600,2,983,4.565714285714286

1003489,4,6305277699,"This is an hilarious concept that carries through pretty well. Barry Humphries (Edna) has some great put downs and one liners.

Although I've been a fan of Dame Edna for years, I was completely unfamiliar with ""Neighbourhood Watch.""  Now that I am, I can only say I was a bit disappointed.  As noted by others, the first episode was hysterical, poor sound quality aside; the second episode was funny; thereafter, it's mindnumbing and repetitive.  I watched it all the way through just to see if I could take it.  Go see her live or buy her book instead - this one's a rental at best.",975888000,4,581,4.592233009708738
1003491,4,6305277699,"""Dame Edna's Neighbourhood Watch"" is a clever parody of 1990s ""people"" shows in which Dame Edna and her bridesmaid Madge Allsop investigate the nooks and crannies of contestants homes. Full-marks for the  great introduction where Edna sings the title song while doing a night time  round of a  minature model neighbourhood. The program is more highly  invasive however than any of Dame Edna's previous efforts and I can  understand this being offensive. What is magical about all of Humphries'  offerings is displayed here - rude and resourceful wit, an electric  interaction with the studio audience and as Dame Edna herself says  ""Even if they couldn't understand me...it's the colour and movement  they love!"". If you enjoy it, keep an eye out for Dame Edna's  celebrity interview show - ""The Dame Edna Experience"". And, to  any ""powers that be"" out there, why not release more Of Humphries  work such as ""The Adventures Of Barry McKenzie""?",960681600,21,943,5.0519480519480515
1003492,5,6305277699,"Dame Edna Everage, Housewife/Megastar, in reality the brilliant Australian comedian Barry Humphries, may well be the funniest man alive, and these shows are hilarious! Edna probes into the raunchiest corners of her victims  - ah - I mean her contestant's homes. Woe unto her who thinks her porn is  hidden safely away. Edna will find it, while Madge helps herself to  whatever she finds in the house. Are there scratches on the wall where the  master bed's headboard has hammered the wall? Don't think Edna will let it  pass un-noticed. What's going on in the daughter's bedroom while Mom is at  the TV studio? Edna's cameras will display the mice playing while the cat's  away. And Edna will comment careingly and witheringly on the decoration  choices. Edna's array of stunning outfits, all designed by her still  unmarried son Kenny of course, is worth the price of the tapes alone. My  favorite is the dress based Munch's ""The Shriek"". It's literally  a scream! If you can resist enough to watch them one at a time, you should  parcel them out, but the temptation to just sit and watch all of them is  too great! If you can see Madge in her prize spokesmodel outfit without  screaming with laughter, you're a stronger man than I.  DAME EDNA  RULES!",954633600,15,1252,4.726851851851852

7886616,4,6305277699,"This is a fun DVD collection of a gameshow ""ish"" programme that Dame Edna had in the early 90's on ITV/LWT.  It is really an opportunity for the great Dame to poke fun at people, but in a honest and frank way.

Madge is here (remember madge ""the badge madge"")...  And the poor people whose houses they go into have some good fun... Imagine going into your closet at home and finding all sorts of things?? Well, thats what happens here.

7886617,4,6305277699,"Possibly the first ""reality"" television, Dame Edna re-invents the game show to do what no one else has previously dared do: reveal women's most closely-guarded secrets. No, not whether they are faithful wives, have a ""checkered"" past, or are stealing from their employers. This is small stuff compared to what Dame Edna uncovers. She goes straight for the most terror-inspiring act anyone can threaten your average middle-class housewife with: the revelation of how she REALLY keeps her house when no one's expected to visit! Is there a laundry pile larger than a small automobile? A toaster filled with enough crumbs to feed an entire Petting Zoo? A hidden stash of booze, or worse, chocolates and cookies? As the poor, unprepared ""contestant"" discovers, Trevor and his live camera are there at her house, ready to ring the bell. When they do, Madge, Dame Edna's brilliantly funny ""bride's maid and travelling companion,"" answers the door and lets him in, and together they roam about the house uncovering bins, opening drawers, checking out what's under the bed, while the all-female, by-invitation-only audience howls with laughter and the horrified contestant watches in anguish. I, for one, have never understood this common fear amongst women, but it is real, and Dame Edna sends it up with glee, revelling in the absurdity of being upset at being discovered to be less than perfect. It's refreshing when the occasional contestant is actually amused herself (one of these has a house filled with erotic art from around the world, and has a great time watching Edna and Madge and the audience deal with that!)
Madge is the real treat in this series, which does become a bit repetitive--it was a weekly game-show, after all. Her behaviour becomes increasingly lunatic (imagine her in head-to-toe leather--on second thought, don't), and it is her facial expressions that provide the greatest humour as she silently censures the contestant's state of affairs. Emily Perry's Madge alternates between a quietly seething unexpressed rage and a tolerant, profound fatigue after 30+ years of living with Edna, her lovingly brutal mistress, and in this series she really shines.
Just as in her live shows, Dame Edna fulfills her mandate to treat ordinary people as stars, and vice versa. Her stars-for-a-night may be briefly horrified, but they get to fly off to Paris for a weekend with the ""traitorous, treacherous, back-stabbing Rat"" who let Dame Edna and her crew in. This person, by the way, is also known as the constestant's husband.
I found the first series to be consistently funnier than the second, though both Edna and Madge are in top form in both. If you have trouble enjoying them back-to-back, make the show a weekly treat, as though it were still on TV.",1085529600,6,2766,5.041484716157205
7886618,5,6305277699,"Dame Edna is truly someone to be adored!  I recently was fortunate enough to see her live in Atlanta.  I can honestly say that I have never, in all my years, seen anything as funny or hilariously irreverant as Dame Edna.  My 80 year old father said he thought he was going to pass out from laughter; that it was the funniest thing he'd ever seen!

All that said, this DVD is a compilation of Dame Edna's television series in Austrailia. It's hard to really put a classification on this show. It's a comedy, that's certain. However, beyond that, it is part Room Invaders and part game show. While each segment has a humorous moment or two, it is difficult to watch them back to back, because they are exceedingly similar. Edna makes similar jabs to each participant.
The premise is that someone from the studio audience is called forward to the stage and unbeknownst to them at the very same time a camera crew is going through that person's house - all the while Edna makes cutting, snide, and humorous remarks about the contents of the house and drawers of the person. In the US, this show would be produced to be very mean-spirited. In Austrailia, it is not; it is uncomfortably humorous.
Not as good as any of Edna's live shows, but maybe something to give yourself a few chuckles.",1076544000,,1284,4.521551724137931
7886619,5,6305277699,"Being from Melbourne like Dame Edna I have known her for as long as I can remember. And she had a winner with this game show as far as laughs are concerned. Well, the contestants thought it was a game show about houses, but it turned out to be about one contestant's house in particular. The poor lady of the house is subjected to a live TV camera going into the house when she is sitting in the studio. And that is when the shocks and embarrassment begin. Dame Edna stops at nothing, including opening any drawer and cupboard she wants to see what's inside. I won't tell you the things she uncovers and the howls of laughter from the audience that go with it.
The first DVD is very, very good but  the second series has a few more surprises. At one time on the 2nd series Dame Edna was given a response that was so stupid (there is no other word for it) that even she, with all her composure and great performing abilities, was not able to keep control and broke up laughing.
If you can get both DVD's you will thank yourself. If not, I suggest this one (the second series) and you will find yourself inviting many friends over who must see it.
