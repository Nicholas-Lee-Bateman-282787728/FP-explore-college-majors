8455593,5,B0053P7LZY,"A striking film which manages to be very powerful in spite of its flaws. As a film, it has a pronounced texture in a way similar to the paintings of Van Gogh.  To the extent that one views the film with an open mind, it can have a profound effect on the emotions. Also, if I am not mistaken, Ravi Shankar scored and played on the soundtrack.",1508630400,,341,4.08955223880597
8455594,5,B0053P7LZY,"A River Called Titas is an adaptation of an autobiographical Bengali novel by Advaita Malla Barman that spans the course of over 30 years. Made shortly after the independence of Bangladesh in 1973, director Ritwik Ghatak's black and white film tells an epic story of a small fishing village surviving along the banks of the Titas River. The members of the community battle with heartache, bandits, mental illness, death, and ultimately the River itself that is gradually drying up and taking their livelihood along with it. The River becomes more like a character than a setting as it flows along at once peaceful, dreamy, and abundant to eventually dismal and scanty. The stunning score, which is all local folk music, encompasses the emotional and nostalgic feel of the film and Barman's lyrical storytelling. Ghatak mourns a past that is disappearing with the Titas, but somehow the river finds a way to keep flowing.",1317081600,,920,5.019607843137255
8455595,4,B0053P7LZY,"This film by somewhat neglected Indian director Ritwik Ghatak is one of the most unusual I have ever seen. The stories are set among the harsh life around the banks of Bangladesh's rivers (one of the poorest regions of the world). It tells several gruesome tales: abductions, escapes, living among strangers, death, though the characters go through this with the resignation of someone who knows that life is hard and always have been. Now, having seen this film more than a decade ago, I cannot recall all the details. But the unusual part is the way this story is told. It puts a character at the center of the story for, say, twenty minutes, and then it moves to another character, who was playing a minor role in the first story. And then to another character, and so on. It is a collection of stories, but loosely (or not so loosely interconnected). Overall, a fine tapestry of life in one of the poorest parts of the world.",1263513600,2,929,4.568862275449102
