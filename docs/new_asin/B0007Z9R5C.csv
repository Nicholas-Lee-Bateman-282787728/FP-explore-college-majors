2254849,5,B0007Z9R5C,I gave this to my 4 year old granddaughter who absolutely loves it and sings and dances with it.,1153785600,4,96,4.105263157894737
2254850,5,B0007Z9R5C,"Very much worth the money.  Do not buy any other volume of Princess Sing Alongs or even the Princess Story line of movies.  This dvd has a few songs from some sequels: Little Mermaid 2 and Return of Jafar, but it has all of the original Princess movies represented - except Aladdin.  ""Kiss The Girl"" is in here from Little Mermaid.  The other Princess Sing Alongs have many songs from sequels.  So if you want to give yourself to the brainwashing marketing program of Disney - Buy the other Sing Alongs or the Princess Stories.

The DVD has an auto-repeat function if you need to get a lot done (meaning - do housework while your princess is glued to the TV).  (I think it's 40 minutes or so without repeat).

AWESOME DVD!!!!",1146441600,9,725,4.4393939393939394
2254851,4,B0007Z9R5C,"My daughter is 3 and loves to watch the sing alongs.  She sings and knows every word now!!  We have to take Disney Princess Sing Alongs vol 1 & 2 even when we go in the van.  They have taught her some words while highlighting them when singing.  She says ""That word is ? from my singing movie.""  I highly recommend vol 1& 2.",1137715200,4,324,4.0
2254852,4,B0007Z9R5C,"I hate to put on a full length movie for my four year old, so these 45 minute sing alongs are great!  And if you love all the Disney princess movies you will love this sing along.  When you hear the songs it will take you back to childhood.  My daughter loves to sing to the songs and dance through the room!  I highly recommend this DVD!",1128729600,9,338,4.0
2254853,3,B0007Z9R5C,"All the best Princess songs were used on the first SingAlong DVD, so the only songs on here that were sung by actual princesses in an actual moview were ""Something There,"" ""Someday My Prince Will Come,"" and ""Just Around the Riverbend.""  The rest were either from sequels, characters who aren't princesses, or were just really horrible songs.  While the first DVD enchanted me with classic songs, this one bored me with one sequel after another, concluding with ""Where Dreams Begin,"" an awful pop/rock song that's very fast-paced and sounds absolutely nothing like a princess song, a much lazier approach to ""If You Can Dream,"" which at least had some appeal to it due to the original singers returning and the clips of the princesses' mouths being synched up with the song.

On Volume 1, it said that ""select bonus features"" would play after the show if you watch the DVD on fastplay, and it did indeed play some dancealongs and other parts of the DVD.  However, if you let this DVD run after the ""show"" (if you can call a bunch of old clips a show), all it shows is about 10 minutes worth of commercials for other Disney products!  That's right, the ""select bonus features"" are promotions to get you to buy more stuff!

If you actually select the bonus features option though, you'll see there are significantly less bonus features than Volume 1.  The only ""dancealong"" this DVD has is to the awful ""Where Dreams Begins,"" and it portrays children in Disney Princess costumes showing off their dance moves so that the viewer can copy then and try to dance to the song like the kids on the screen.  The game, ""Princess Tea Time,"" involves choosing what design the princesses would like on their napkins, teacups, and what they would want to eat.  Now, the answers are always the one that relate most to that princess's movie, but most of the time, the other options seem better.  For example, if Aurora was almost killed by a spinning wheel, why would she want one embroidered on her napkin?  And why would Snow White want to eat apple tart?

The only two things I liked about this DVD were the karaoke because I love to sing, and the introduction to ""Where Dreams Begin,"" in which all of the Disney scenes where a princess dances were cut and pasted onto the same background to make it look like all of the princesses were dancing together in the same place.  Some of them were sequel footage, and it only lasted about a second, but it still looked cool.

So if you feel that you absolutely must have this DVD to add to your collection, go for it.  However, do not expect it to be anywhere nearly as good as the first one, and keep in mind that the vast majority of it consists of promotions for other Disney products.",1126310400,42,2718,4.552361396303901
2254854,4,B0007Z9R5C,"Here, as with most of Disney Sing Along Songs is a collection of beloved Disney songs with their memorable sequences in the animated classics.

In this the second volume of Disney Princess Sing Along Songs DVDs, the princess themed songs are-

""So This is Love"" (Cinderella)

""Kiss the Girl"" (The Little Mermaid)

""Forget About Love"" (The Return Of Jafar)

""Something There"" (Beauty & The Beast)

""Just Around the Riverbend"" (Pocahontas)

""Someday My Prince Will Come"" (Snow White & The Seven Dwarfs)

""I Wonder"" (Sleeping Beauty)

""Honor to Us All"" (Mulan)

""Love"" (James & The Giant Peach)

""In a World of My Own"" (Alice In Wonderland)

""For a Moment"" (The Little Mermaid II: Return To The Sea)

Just like volume 1, most of the songs have previously been released on other Disney Sing Along Songs, but once again, it's good to have them all in the same place. For the record though, the new additions are ""So This Is Love"", ""Someday My Prince Will Come"", ""I Wonder"", ""Love"" and the excellent ""For A Moment"". As with volume 1, the newest highlight is a new song called

""Where Dreams Begin"" once again performed by the Disney Princesses.

In addition, the dance alongs are here again as is the Karaoke option for those youngsters really looking to be a real singer.

The difference between this Sing Along Alongs and others though, is that this time around the little princess in the family is guest of honor for the show and a bonus tea party game.

Somehow I sense that this volume of Disney Princess Sing Along Songs will be just as popular as volume 1.",1123718400,124,1557,4.665441176470588

I had figured that all the 'good songs' were used up in vol 1, but the 'second tier' songs are still really good too.  My daughter loves it, so that is the main thing.  Basically, if you don't have Volume 1, I would get that one first.  But if you have that one and your child likes it, then chances are they will like vol 2 as well.  The one thing I would change, as with vol 1, is I wish it were newer so it would include songs from Princess and the Frog, and Tangled.",1322438400,,619,3.7890625
2254894,3,B0007Z9R5C,"Disney has hundreds of songs over the years.  They could have put a handful of favorites on each DVD, but instead, they carefully select the songs so they can sell the maximum number of different DVDs.  As a result, each DVD features a few songs that are either forgettable, or downright awful.

This DVD includes ""Forget About Love"" where half the song features Gilbert Gottfried, or someone doing an impression.  Gilbert is a funny guy, and the parrot voice was a good fit, but his singing voice grates on your nerves.  This was no accident.  They chose him for the part because his voice was annoying.  To hear him singing is really just too much.

If you have a fast-forward button, the rest of the DVD is fine, but it just happens that we don't.  We watch this in the car, and suffer through the bad songs each time.",1318118400,4,821,4.456375838926174

I think a lot of them are thrown together fast and in a very cheap or low budget kind of way making them almost unbearable to watch. I took a chance on this one based on other customer reviews and my daughter really LOVES it! She also asks to watch it over and over again so that's always a good sign.

2254901,3,B0007Z9R5C,"""Disney Princess Sing Along Songs - Enchanted Tea Party Vol II"" was actually not as good as Vol I, though my preschooler was still happy with it. My main grouse is that most of the songs featured either did not feature an original Disney princess or were taken from Disney sequels.

The list of songs here are:
""So This is Love"" - Cinderella
""Kiss the Girl"" - The Little Mermaid
""Forget About Love"" - The Return of Jafar
""Something There"" - Beauty and the Beast
""Just Around the Riverbend"" - Pocahontas
""Some Day My Prince Will Come"" - Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs
""I Wonder"" - Sleeping Beauty
""Honor To Us All"" - Mulan
""For a Moment"" - The Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea

There are also some new songs such as ""Where Dreams Begin"". Amongst the bonus features are Music Time: Karaoke, Dance Along, and Random Play and Repeat Play Options,and Game Time with a Princess Tea Time. There's also a French language track. The running time is only 34 minutes [another of my complaints]. For the price charged for the DVD, this does not seem like value for money.",1238544000,7,1064,4.479381443298969
