This movie has none of the above. I feel almost as bad for the individuals that spent so much time on the stop-motion clay animation as I do for myself for wasting the forty-five minutes I gave of my life to watch half of it. My nine and seven year old nephews could have come up with something more imaginative than this. Whoever gave ""Disaster!"" a positive review either participated in the production of the movie or is related to someone that is.",1222387200,,624,4.387931034482759
2693571,5,B000KLNLYG,"This movie is extremely hilarious!!! It makes fun of action/disaster movies using clay characters. Some names are Harry Bottoms, Sandy Mellons, Donkey Dixon, and V.D. Johnson! They must stop a planetoid from destroying the world. On earth, they show a bulimic teen pageant, and they learn they are going to die, they start eating junk food! When they save the day, the bulimic teens scream and start puking! If you love comedy, action, fart jokes, tiolet humor, and gay robots, you'll love DISASTER! THE MOVIE!!!",1219622400,,512,5.035294117647059
2693572,5,B000KLNLYG,"I loved this movie!  It is definately for those who like a little sick humor in their movie, which makes it easy to watch over and over so you pick up on all the funny lines. The characters ""clay"" like look was really creative, and reminded me of Mr. Bill from years ago.  Took me back to my younger, metal days with the scenes from Motley Crue. Rock on!  Sent the DVD on to my girlfriend to watch so she can enjoy too!  Thanks for great entertainment, definately recommend it!",1202428800,,477,4.266666666666667
2693573,4,B000KLNLYG,"I am very pleased with this product. It has everyhing I have ever wanted in one movie, and it is jam-packed. The jokes come fast and furious, they include racial stereotypes, beastiality, homosexuality, drug abuse, extreme farting, military stupidity, dumb blondes, and sex sex sex. It is the ultimate movie! It even has a Captain Kirk character who ends up lobotomized!!

This movie is comedy at the lowest common denominator and that is just where I like it. The crude clay animation just adds to the charm. This movie has a lot of beautiful, gravity defying clay boobies too, with nipples!!!! This film makes me very happy.

From a Frenchman with the power of flight acheived through flaming farts, to man eating space apes, this film has something for everyone.",1191196800,,765,4.876923076923077
2693574,3,B000KLNLYG,"I didn't love this film, but I didn't hate it. It has funny moments. It has some of the same crude humor as Team america, but just not as original and not so overexagerated. The main reason it doesn't stand out is that it is essentially Armmageddon retold with very Rauncy puppets.  Team america at least had an original over-the-top incorperation of many of the action films story lines, but this was just one film, amageddon.  Check it out, some good laughs, but I would recommend renting this one, and decide later weather or not to buy it.",1180483200,4,543,4.530612244897959
2693575,3,B000KLNLYG,"""Disaster! The Movie"" is a weird mix of the profound and the profane.  The profound: a good reflection of our own reflection (ref. Borat's humor).  The very fact that the movie's sterotypes and  cliches can be funny at times says something about our own values/views of the world.  (Guilty...I laughed out-loud at times.) The profane: fart jokes, racism,sexism, homophobia, lackluster plot.  Although the plot was soft, the writers have a good eye for those nonsensical sensibilities which seem to SELL and which have been so deadly to quality movies.  Also; terrific animation,production values and talented voices.  The ""Directors Cut"" and ""Behind-the-Scenes' extras are interesting.  If you like ""South Park"" and ""Team America"", then give it a try.",1175040000,,751,5.358974358974359
2693576,4,B000KLNLYG,"I really enjoyed this stupid movie.

If you thought Armageddon was lame, and AIRPLANE! was great, then you'll definitely get a kick out of DISASTER!  It's got a bunch of great characters, with a parody story, and lots and lots of cool animation throughout.  I recommend watching this with a good crew over a couple cases of beer or whatever makes you giggle and be obnoxious.

p.s. I don't know what Motley Crue had to do with this... they are grossly miscredited as being Stars of this movie.",1174262400,,493,4.568181818181818
2693577,5,B000KLNLYG,"Do you like jokes that involve a priest having sex with little boys? You like violence? You like nudity? How about really bad Claymation? Well if you do this movie's for you!!! The jokes are predictable, and stupid. The plot, well it's been done before. The point, pointless. So why rent, buy, watch this movie? My question is why not? If you're reading this then you have somewhat of an interest in watching the movie. So watch the damn thing already. It goes good with a bad date you're trying to get rid of.",1173484800,3,510,4.4361702127659575

8158016,4,B000KLNLYG,"I am not sure how to even describe this movie.  It is full of rather juvenile visual and subtle humour...the premise is an asteroid heading towards earth and how they are going to stop it.  It is somewhat like Team America, but on a more base level.  Yet, I liked it.  Somehow it just worked for me in most areas.  I have lent it to many friends that would not normally like this sort of movie and they liked it, too, but cannot explain why.  It is just one of those types of movies...",1398470400,,485,4.1063829787234045

8158018,3,B000KLNLYG,"Even though Eric Fogel wasn't involved in this, a lot of his animators were. It was a good movie, lots a great jokes but the plot was kind of long and slightly pointless and not enough violence and gore. It's good but wasn't great. People conpaired this to Team America which I found do be way better written. I still keep it as the Celebrity Deathmatch fan I am and do recommend it for collectors. It's just not a classic.",1353974400,,423,4.3
8158019,3,B000KLNLYG,"Don't mistake this movie for the movie titled ""Disaster Movie (2008)"", another one of those so-called parody movies that manages to make a 120 minute long movie without a laugh. This one is titled ""Disaster: The Movie (2006)"", and is a parody of the Bruce Willis film Armageddon. However, when the writers proposed this script to Hollyweed producers, they where told the budget would probably be around 80 million, and no one was going to invest that kind of money into a parody film. So the idea to make it a low budget animation flick was given the thumbs up to create.

The animation is dolls, clay models, toys in a stop-motion environment. Basically, it's the same thing Robot Chicken does. However, I have seen up and down reviews from Robot Chicken fans, and some say it's good, some didn't think it was any good, but to me, I thought it was a decent parody and the makers of the film did not waste their time or potential in creating this. I think some Robot Chicken fans are being a bit too bias on their opinions and didn't enjoy not hearing Seth Green and the other guy do any voices in this movie, otherwise it probably would be a movie they praised the chicken clucker out of. Others also compare it to Team America, but of coarse, do not expect the budget of Team America to show through in this movie, this is a small low budget film, but it still deserved to be watched without people expecting it to be Robot Chicken or Team America, it is something else on it's own.

The plot of the film is much like Armageddon. A huge asteroid is heading to the earth, and a team of drillers are sent to the planetoid to blow it up, moments after they find their inner strengths and blah blah blah.

You have the group of main characters which consist of Harry Bottoms, who is the Bruce Willis character pretty much. A stupid blonde who masters in neurophysiology (rocket science), the blonde cowboy named V.D Johnson who can't keep his hands off Harry's daughter (Major Melons), and also has a fear of Golf Carts... a gay robot, a black guy named Donkey Dixon who can drill anything because he is such a great porno-star, a stereo-type French guy who needs to learn how to control his flatulence, a captain who is pretty much Captain James T Kirk (I can't beleive I even know that full name). Along with other side characters such as Dr Steven Mocking, and some pretty useless cameo's by Motley Crue who I guess must have invested money in the movie or something, as there is no way I would leave their useless scenes in the movie for the final cut. Maybe it was because they used a few of their songs, that they got to do some voice acting and participate in the movies ""The World is F'd 1 day tour""... I don't mind Motley Crue, but the scenes they are in, needed not be there at all.

So the film is pretty much what you expect, a bunch a low budget animations, which are not so bad at all for a low budget film, it certainly came across as being more expensive then it was. And of coarse, a bunch of sex, drugs, rock n roll, potty mouths, immature toilet humor and dolls flashing their private parts around for no reason at all... and that's how I think most movies should be made.

It's going to be up and down reviews, parody movies always are. Some don't like the humor, some don't. Personally, I enjoyed it for the most part. Sure, you could always say it could have been better, and this and that should have, could have and would have, blah blah blah, but the movie is done now, so it is what it is, and no one is going to change that. If you enjoy parody films, even if you are like me and hated the last 10 that have come out and say ""Parody films have been murdered"" then check this one out, it is better then a lot of recent ones, but no, don't expect a discovered gem, it won't hold a candle to Team America, Airplane, Hot Shots or anything by Mel Brooks, but it does have it's moments, unlike the 2008 movie Disaster Movie, and all the other ones they produced that had a word before the next word ""Movie"".

Bonus Features: Don't bother. A couple of trailers, which should never be listed as any kind of bonus feature, and a behind the scenes featurette, which is the same old boring, ""We loved working together"", ""this is us showing you we had a ball making the film"", here is someone you don't know or care about telling you what they did on the movie and a bunch of ""I turn this knob and that door opens"" kind of dribble that is on every other damn featurette that someone needs to prohibit by law to be shown on DVD's as only 3 or 4 people, like the Farrelly Brothers would give a rats rectum to watch without being bored to tears and hitting the fast forward button numerous times before turning it off halfway through.",1321488000,,4744,4.330708661417323
8158020,3,B000KLNLYG,"This movie is a cross between a low-budget Robot chicken and Team America so if you appreciate dolls humping then buy this film as it has it in droves.

8158022,1,B000KLNLYG,"I purchased Disaster! The Movie thinking it was done by the same people that make Robot Chicken, seeing as how Amazon suggested it when I was purchasing Seasons 1 - 3. It is not. I watched it and it had some laughs but was truly not worth the money I spent. My suggestion is rent it somewhere then make your own decision whether you want to purchase it or not. If I had, I wouldn't have bought it.",1243987200,,397,4.102564102564102
