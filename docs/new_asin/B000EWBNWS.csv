8114983,5,B000EWBNWS,bought this product for my daughter as a christmas present as it was rated as high on her wish list. she and her friends enjoyed watching this anime.,1324771200,,149,4.357142857142857
8114984,5,B000EWBNWS,"No complaints on the actual anime. It's awesome.
However, I seem to have issues playing the 3rd disk in the series. I play it on my Xbox and it always pauses/skips at the exact same spot every times it's played. On top of that it's the only Genshiken disk that doesn't play in my mac laptop. When I try to play I get a message saying ""supported disk not available"".
I thought it was just the disk, so I ordered a new one and it did the same thing! I sent that one back and got a replacement and again it happened! I'm really confused and hoping anyone has any suggestions or reassurance that it's not just me and my bad luck. :/ Has anyone else had this problem?",1271808000,,662,4.1395348837209305
8114985,4,B000EWBNWS,This is not the conventinal anime I would regulerly buy. I gave it a try only to find out that this series was pretty funny and sad but true. It exploits all us Geeks who truly love anime and makes us realize that we are groups of wierd loser for non-anime fans BUT in our eyes we are truly blessed to be able to delight ouselves in a Society for the Study of Modern Visual Culture.,1231891200,,382,4.0394736842105265
8114986,5,B000EWBNWS,"What you get:
* The original Genshiken Series
* 3 OAV Episodes of Kujibiki Unbalance

What you don't get
* The subsequent Genshiken OAVs that were released with the KujiUn TV series
* The second Genshiken Series
* The KujiUn TV series

This is a great series, truly one of the rare must-own anime collections out there.

One piece of advice though: I've been told by friends that the difference between my Premium Collection and their Economy Collections are the box. Literally, its the same three discs, in the same three cases, just a cheaper box... considering the somewhat dramatic price difference between the two at times, its tough to recommend the Premium version. The box looks nice and all, but in the end its just a box.",1200873600,22,731,4.6953125
8114987,5,B000EWBNWS,"This series goes a long way in exemplifying why this is a truly great art form.  For one thing, the stories are not only about real life, but they're about a particular kind of real life; that is, one who is interested in the culture that produces, among other things, anime.  Since there are only realistic elements here, the stories develop real characters who have sometimes very real and important to them (and the viewer since it's difficult not to care), but are also somewhat ordinary.  There is a wonderful episode where Harunobu Madarame and Saki Kasukabe are alone together in the club room where Madarame is just so uncomfortable because Saki is an attractive 'normal' girl.  He has spent so much time engrossed by his hobbies (as an 'otaku') that just spending time with a person is impossible.  Meanwhile Saki is oblivious as she reads her manga.

Also, the art is really great, and the extra bonus of an anime within an anime is a brilliant touch.  During the Genshiken show, the club members are often watching, and sometimes discussing the show Kujibiki Unbalance which isn't an actual show.  The bonus is that this show is really good, and the episodes referenced appear in full on the disc.

Finally, I have to say that the opening song is one of best openers I have heard.  It's definitely a great song in itself while it captures the spirit of the story.  The music to Kuibiki Unbalance is highly recommended as well.

In short, I have to say that I rented this disc from a rental place, and ended up keeping it for months because I kept watching it.  Even after quite a few viewings, it just never got tiring.  When I finally returned it, I started borrowing it from the library.  I do recommend viewing it in the sub version, although on this disc the dub is also top shelf!",1193270400,,1796,4.56875
8114988,5,B000EWBNWS,"TO MAKE THE LONG STORY SHORT, BUY THIS BOX SET AND BELIEVE ME YOU WON'T REGRET IT.",1179619200,,82,3.8823529411764706
8114989,5,B000EWBNWS,"This is one of my favorite shows of all time.  This show is a must own for any real or aspiring otaku and just about every ""normal"" anime fan, too.  It is a hilarious comedy that throws in just enough heart to keep your mind open.

Sasahara has been denying his otaku nature, because he is worried (I guess) about what other people would think.  When he gets to college he resolves to embrace his inner nerd and join an otaku club.  Still wavering, he shows up to a meeting of Genshiken: The Society for the Study of Modern Visual Culture ""just to check it out"" and is hooked (which is one of the best moments in the whole show).

Genshiken's members each represent a different facet of otaku fandom.  Sasahara feels out of place, at first, because he doesn't think he is nerd enough to fit in.  On the other hand, fellow Freshman Kousaka revels in his geekdom despite his incredibly un-nerdy appearance and demeanor.  The rest of the show follows Sasahara's journey through the full spectrum of otaku-dom.

In addition to the show, itself, each volume of Genshiken has an episode of the characters' favorite anime, Kujibiki Unbalance, which has its own main menu, extras, and audio sections.  Each show treats the other as a special extra on the disc and it's really cool to see.  Kuji-Un is not a spectacular show in its own right, except that the Genshiken characters think it is and that it is so representative of everything an otaku loves about anime.

The series does feel kind of short, but only because you'll want to see more.  Check out the manga, which follows almost the exact same story line, except continues on past the end of the anime starting with volume 6 or 7.  Even with that, I still give it the highest recommendation I can to anyone who already knows what an otaku is and a strong recommendation to anyone else who wants to learn.  One caveat for parents: there is some implied adult material, here.  There is nothing explicit, other than Kasukabe and Kousaka's relationship (only in their dialogue, though), but enough to get the point across.  Consider yourself warned.",1177113600,6,2096,4.634146341463414

I wached it with pleasure...

I recomend to another anime art lovers to see that :)",1173312000,,107,4.0476190476190474
8114991,4,B000EWBNWS,"Unlike most animes, this show is extremely realistic. It focuses on the members of a student activity club at a University in the outskirts of Tokyo. The club is a group of slackers whose sole activity is appreciating anime, manga, hentai, cosplay and other pastimes normally associated with nerds (sometimes called ""otaku"" in Japanese). Each episode describes some aspect of nerd culture.",1149638400,2,389,5.290322580645161
