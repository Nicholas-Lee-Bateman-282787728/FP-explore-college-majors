8594665,5,B00DN63YQK,Toby is a great instructor breaking each part down and explaining how it works. Learning all the new chord shapes is not easy but with plenty of practice following Toby's instruction opens up a whole new level of playing. I am now going to purchase his previous DVD so I can learn more great stuff.,1400544000,,298,4.4363636363636365
8594666,5,B00DN63YQK,This is a great instructional. However I think it is for the advanced player. There is a ton of good stuff on this dvd but if you are a beginner this might be a little tough.,1393891200,2,174,3.861111111111111
8594667,5,B00DN63YQK,"This is one great guitar lesson. Only problem I see is that he makes it ""appear"" too easy....but that is just because he is a master technician. Never the less, pay close attention and you will come away from this a much improved finger picking guitarist. I love this artist!!",1379808000,,276,4.54
