7948570,3,B00005OBAM,"I like Helen Slater and had never heard of this before..I picked it up for a buck and decided to give it a try..It's a remake of sorts of the classic ""Wait Until Dark"", only it's not as good..and it's kind of flat..I checked imdb, and this 2001 Canadian made for TV film (TMN) is listed as a direct to video title.. There's no language above a single ""hell"", the violence is minimal..and there's not of a lot of suspense either. They even get Slater to order a pizza for everyone..  I guess the desperate and thieving killers are nice and polite up in Canada, eh? If you like your thrillers without a lot of gore and profanity, I guess this one is for you... as for everyone else, skip it, it's less than a Lifetime movie....Btw, Andrew McCarthy is only in the movie for about 20 minutes..and if you know how these types of films go, you know what that means..I'm just sayin'... Though not MPAA rated, which is different from ""unrated"", I would say this is the equivalent of a PG (U.S.) rating... mild...or TV PG ..",1394755200,,1015,4.37037037037037
7948571,5,B00005OBAM,"Nowhere in sight was a turning point in the career of actress, singer and songwriter Helen Slater. Besides to play the leading role it was in this movie that Slater had the first oportunity to display her musical talents, writing and singing Detour, the song you hear in the opening and in the end credits. It happened almost by chance. Nowhere in sight was shot in Montreal and Slater always rent a piano, when goes on location to compose new songs in her free time. Detour was created during the work in the movie and recorded in a small studio Helen found in the city. When the movie producer Kimberley Berlin listened to the recording she asked to use it in the movie. That was 3 years before the release of Slater first music album One of these days. You will also listen to Slater playing piano e even cello in the opening sequences. But Nowhere in Sight also displays Helen Slater talent as an actress in a very demanding role. Displaying a variety of emotions that go from sadness to dispair, from happiness to confusion and fear. So if you want to get acquainted with the multifaceted talent of this very beautiful lady this is the movie.",1114732800,2,1147,4.519230769230769
7948572,2,B00005OBAM,"This movie is so awful I don't even know where to begin. OK. Let me start. First of all, who is this so called Helen Slater who delivers this awful poor performance in this movie. She plays this woman who recently became blind and began dating Eric (Andrew McCarthy). Slater who plays the character of Carley delivers a performance that is sooo predicable and just plain boring. This movie is so unrealistic that I don'e believe it should have ever been made into a movie. Eric played by Andrew McCarthy of course was great, even though I don't think Andrew McCarthy is very convincing playing the bad guy. Who would believe he would be the bad guy in this movie, after looking into his baby blue sparkleing eyes. Now don't get me wrong, I absolutely love Andrew but this part just was not, and I stress not right for him. Overall I do not reccommend this movie to anyone who is an Andrew McCarthy fan. If you are don't see this movie because you'll be highly disappointed. Besides he only came out in the movie for a total of about 20 minutes. Before spending 12.99 + tax, rent it first. The only reason I gave this crappily made movie two stars was because Andrew McCarthy appeared in it, not for the movie it self. Sorry, but the truth hurts.",1029715200,3,1245,4.441048034934497
7948573,3,B00005OBAM,"Modern remake of the Classic ""Wait Until Dark"", pits  Helen Slater against 2 psychotic killers.
As in the original, the lead is a woman newly blinded and having trouble adjusting to a world without vision.  The brightest spots in Carly's life are her relationship with her lover, Eric, and the new loft they move into in the deserted warehouse district.  Not surprisingly, one evening when Eric is away two parolee's break into the apartment and hold Carly hostage hoping to extract the combination to a safe full of diamonds from her.  While a few others try and help, inevitably, Carly finds that the only person she can truly depend on is herself.
This was an OK updating of the classic movie with Audrey Hepburn, but to be honest that movie was so good I wonder why anyone would re-do it.  Frankly too much material leads up to the home invasion espcially the criminals hstalking their hapless victim unseen.  It doesn't add to the plot and the characters are thinly drawn enough to not need too much on-screen time to show us their motivation.  A tighter story that focused on the lead would have worked much better.
I thought the acting was good and that Helen Slater does a great job as the defensless woman who discoves her inner strengh.  I also really liked the nice job of forshadowing by having her practice Braille on a quote from Shakespere's Sonnet 94 ""sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds"".
This was a an OK movie but it suffers by comparison to such a classic as ""Wait Until Dark"".  I have the DVD but there were no special features on it so the VHS would be just as good.",1014249600,5,1596,4.5524475524475525
7948574,3,B00005OBAM,"Helen Slater has always been one of my favorite actress and I must admit she was the reason I bought this movie. As usual, she didn't disappoint me, playing an amazingly convincing blind woman. She also writes and sings ""detour"", the main song of the movie: excellent! How come she never released an album?
As for the movie itself... Well, it's not a bad story; but there's nothing really unpredictable in it and the two bad guys are way too caricatural.
The DVD edition has no feature at all, not even a chapter menu.",1008028800,4,518,4.5212765957446805
