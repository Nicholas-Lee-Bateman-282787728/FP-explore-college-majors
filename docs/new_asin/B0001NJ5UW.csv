8015388,5,B0001NJ5UW,Roger Day Live is one of the most entertaining DVD's that I have seen. His songs are very catchy and the movements that go with the songs are fun and inviting!  The younger students that I work with love the DVD and the songs stick in their heads.  They love it!,1356048000,,262,4.117647058823529
8015389,5,B0001NJ5UW,"We checked this DVD out from our public library over and over again and finally decided we needed our own copy.  My kids watch it at least once a day.  I originally got it for our 5 year old, but our 8 month old baby loves it too.  The 5 year old gets up and dances and sings (great exercise) and the 8 month old bounces and dances along with the music.  I find myself singing right along and enjoying the upbeat, fun, wholesome songs as well. Terrific DVD for the whole family and gets everyone up and moving!",1241222400,,510,4.121212121212121
8015390,5,B0001NJ5UW,"There is so much fun packed into this DVD. The whole family can join in to kiss Rhino's, eat mosquito burritos and fly around the world. Roger is energetic, has a great stage presence and is very much into the kids and grownups in the audience. Having seen him live several times but in a much smaller setting, this is a great way to see him whenever you want!!",1088899200,3,361,4.246376811594203
