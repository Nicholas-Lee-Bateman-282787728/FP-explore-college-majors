2634606,3,B000HDR89Q,"Saiyuki is one of my favorite anime series, but I was disappointed in this collection for one reason -- none of the extras from the earlier release have been included.  This is particularly unfortunate for the Cultural Notes which add a lot to the viewer's understanding of the legend that the series is based on.  The collection does include all of the 50 episodes in a box that won't take up much room on your shelf and for a very reasonable price.  But I would have been willing to pay a little more and have the extras included also.",1162425600,25,537,4.404040404040404
2634607,4,B000HDR89Q,"This collection is a 10 disk, 50 episode, and a little over 20 hours (for the complete collection) long.  It is a little confusing as you watch it since it is combining old world Japan with the new, such as: a magic creature that can turn into a Jeep, the main character ( a monk) carries and uses what appears to be either a .38 or .357 caliber snub nose, old world Gods and Goddesses with new world religious thoughts.  Other than the confusion the collection is not bad if taken at face value.  The characters are centered around the monk with 3 other characters that act as though they hate each other but are good friends and they are on a quest to eliminate a bad guy to the west.  I'm not going to go to far with this since it may give away the plot and the ending.  But, if you like this kind of anime give it a watch you might like it.",1410134400,,844,4.0602409638554215

I recommend it especially if you like Inuyasha or Yu Yu hakasho.",1403395200,,319,4.079365079365079
2634610,5,B000HDR89Q,i gave it 5 stars cause it a action comedy series its one not to miss in your life time this is a series little like yu yu hakusho but not as epic and dramatic so fans that are into fighting and jokes get this series u will be satisfied,1396483200,,236,3.74
2634611,1,B000HDR89Q,"Oh, dear what an awful piece of dust bunny crap. Seriously, I have seen some bad anime, and I mean 3 week old tuna noodle casserole that got left in the fridge and is starting to grow its own ecosystem bad, but they at least had the excuse of being made in the late 80's/early 90's, where most animation did kinda suck. But this has NO EXCUSE! It was made in 2000! The lazy animation, poor storyline, little to no explanation of anything, character arcs, and terrible TERRIBLE action scenes make it seem like a 3-year old made this..... Just... ugh... Save yourselves.... I know the cover looks cool..... I know the synopsis on the back seems interesting..... But it's all a trap.",1394323200,2,680,4.536585365853658
2634612,4,B000HDR89Q,"First and foremost it should be said that this DVD set is only for the original Gensoumaden series of 50 episodes. It doesn't include the later Reload or Gunlock series, nor the OVAs Burial or Gaiden, nor the movie Requiem, nor the original animation OVA, the name of which eludes me. This may seem trivial information but it's actually not. Reason being that Saiyuki's animation and Saiyuki's manga are kinda all over the place when compared with each other. The animation quality is not great but you get used to it - it is inferior to that used in some of the later stuff, especially the most recent - but that's to be expected since Gensoumaden is the oldest series.

Gensoumaden follows the manga up to about halfway through (ep 27ish?), where it deviates from canon into a half-filler half canon arc based partly on the flashback from 500 years ago (though without completing it) and partly a new story, involving a character, Homura. I really don't like this arc and never have. I think they tried to do too much with material from too many different parts of the manga, and overall it didn't completely work.

I actually love Saiyuki very much, but the thing that is gutwrenching to me about this series/release is that arguably the best arc of the original Saiyuki manga series, the Kamisama arc is left out and not animated until the end of the Reload series. For that reason, it isn't a part of this set. I still don't understand why Gensoumaden deviated into filler instead of airing this arc (which is beautifully done in the Reload series), but can only assume it was to do with a manga hiatus at the time.

It makes me sad to see in reviews things about plot weakness or lack of depth, because I know that's the fault of filler episodes and inattention to the manga in key places and arcs like the one mentioned above. If you like the anime, read the manga next. I think only then does it become clear how the whole story fits together and how intricate it is (albeit it is still ongoing due to the mangaka's poor health).

For those not sure about viewing order, this series box set - Gensoumaden - comes first.

Saiyuki Reload follows it, Saiyuki Reload Gunlock follows that. That ends the main series and roughly gets to the end of the Reload manga, although it has to be said that the Even a Worm Arc (one of the best manga arcs in my opinion) is butchered and abridged to fit the episode space and therefore feels decidedly jerky and rushed compared to the original.

Saiyuki Gaiden focuses on completing the ""what happened 500 years ago"" arc, which in manga is all in one complete set of 4 volumes, as opposed to scattered through two series. If you're just watching anime, watch Gensoumaden before Gaiden or you will be confused (though the OVA is very good).

Saiyuki Burial focuses on what happened a month or two after the four of them met. It should not be watched till after the flashback eps in Gensoumaden about how they met, but can stand alone otherwise. It comes from the Reload Manga.

The movie, Requiem, stands alone.

Much as I recommend Saiyuki as an anime series, if you like the anime, seriously, read the manga and you'll love it even more.",1393545600,,3180,4.545454545454546

2634615,5,B000HDR89Q,"What a way to get a worthy supernatural, fantasy, and hilarious show to watch! Even in a treatment, you'll still get better quality of picture and audio to see. I'm startin' to love this show. A favorite character I like about the show is Genjyo Sanzo who's out on a mission to stop the resurrection of the demon king (Gyumaoh) while traveling westward to India with his idiotic companions (Son Goku, Sha Gojyo, and Cho Hakkai). While on their way, they're beset by inept assasins, bad weather, and their own tragic personal pasts. I might recommend this product to anyone. Get ready to gun out by buying this product and whip it out for a whole adventure or you can forget it since a whole brief of comedy is what you have to put with. It's your choice now.",1376179200,2,758,4.460431654676259
2634616,3,B000HDR89Q,"Saiyuki takes place in an alternate version of feudal Japan, where human civilization is struggling to survive in a land plagued by demons and gods, neither of which think too highly of them.  A certain faction of demons has made plans to resurrect...  Something...  I don't know, some kind of mega-demon...  and a disgruntled, cynical priest named Genjyo Sanzo has been sent on a journey west in order to stop them.  Somehow.  I know it's explained in there somewhere, but god help me if I ever needed to remember it.

If I were to describe the plot of this anime to a friend, I'd tell him it was about four bad-ass anti-hero characters travelling across the desert and doing bad-ass things.  Because that's really what it is that you get with this anime.  The intended plot, if you must know, is an adaptation of a Chinese Folk tale called Journey to the West.  There's some back story about collecting scrolls and saving the world, but it's rarely ever referenced in the story.  It's nothing more than a MacGuffin, and it only serves three purposes;

1:  Explain why the characters are travelling
2:  Create friction between the characters
3:  Prevent them from lingering in one place for too long, and thus from dwelling on any one story for too long.

The only thing you need to know, or even absorb about this plot is that there are four bad-ass characters travelling west and doing bad-ass things.

Since I'm already on a negative note, I may as well get my comments about the animation quality out of the way.  The budget for this anime was extremely small, and the people behind it weren't nearly as good as the creators of Berserk at trying to cover up this issue.  Still frames will drag on way too long, with only the characters lips moving.  The ones that aren't talking will just stand there as still as cardboard cut-outs, not even blinking.  The same can be said for the backgrounds.  Clouds and trees rarely move, either.  But since the artwork in this anime is actually kind of impressive, you probably won't mind so much.

It's noticeable, but the only time it really hurts the series is during the fight scenes.  The fight scenes are, for the most part, pathetic.  Most low budget anime make the effort to set aside a decent amount of money to make their fights look impressive...  Naruto did it, Berserk did it, and so did Saiyuki...  In the second season, at least.  But for the first 26 episodes or so, the fight scenes are just painful to watch, especially one of the early fights against some giant bug-like thing.

The music is decent, but forgettable.  Which is good, because they use the same tracks over and over again, and you're really better off trying not to notice.  But while we're on the subjects of music and animation, the openings are actually really good.  I fell in love with the second season opening the first time I watched it, and for 24 straight episodes, I never once skipped past it.

I've already mentioned that this series doesn't really care about it's own plot, but I can't really call that a negative, as the show's episodic nature is by far one of it's best qualities.  Much like Cowboy Bebop, this story is told almost exclusively through standalone 1-3 part episodes that really don't have anything to do with each other outside of some subtle character development.  These vignettes are well structured and brilliantly paced, and god help me, each one seems to get better than the last one.  None of them ever feel like filler, and none of the stock characters ever feel like stock characters.  Characters that only get five minutes of screen time still shine with lives of their own, rather than fade into the background as writers' conveniences.

One of the stronger aspects of this anime IS its cast of characters.  The main character, Genjyo Sanzo, who I've already touched on in the plot description, is the leader of the group, and...  If we're being honest, here...  He's one of the rare male Tsundere characters.  He goes to great lengths to pretend, and even try to convince himself, that he hates his three companions, but more often than not proves otherwise.  Goku is the cheerful, energetic monkey-like boy who's adopted the other three characters as a surrogate family, and is constantly complaining about his appetite.  Gojyo is a half-human-half-demon who loves the more risqu aspects of life, such as alcohol, sex and gambling.  Hakkai is the cool and collected character who keeps the other three grounded.

Kougaji is the determined, prideful antagonist who will go to any lengths to get his mother back.  Homura is a former God who wants to erase creation to get back at the Gods for taking the life of his beloved.  Dokukakuji is Gojyo's older brother, Lirin is what Goku would be like if he had boobs, and Yaone stays quietly out of our memories like a good girl.  These characters, on their own, don't seem like much.  There's minimal character development.  They have their concerns, their goals, and their somewhat well-explored back-stories, but it's together that they make this anime as entertaining as it damn well should be.  The writing and the dialogue between them is witty, natural, and never feels repetitIve or forced.  Even the running gags manage to stay fresh, although I didn't particularly care for the way the first season villains were used in the second season.

I haven't watched this anime in Japanese, so I can't say how good it was in it's native language, but I can still say with complete confidence that the english dub was [i]phenomenal.[/i]  It was an early effort by ADV Films, which just so happens to be my favorite dubbing company of all time.  And Saiyuki is a perfect example of why I love it so much.  Every single role is perfectly casted, and performed just as well.  It's rare to find an anime who's english voices make it's characters sound deeper and more complex than they actually are.  Even amongst this unbelievable cast, there are [i]still[/i] a few stand-out performances, namely from David Matranga, Vic Mignogna, Greg Ayres and Jason Douglas.

Now, I'm going to interrupt this review to give you all a brief history lesson about the ADV Films dubbing company.  It's a Texas based company that started out in the late nineties, making dubs of anime properties that nobody else really wanted.  They took on highbrow projects, like Evangelion and Kino's Journey, lowbrow projects, like Steel Angel Kurumi and Elfen Lied, and even some insane titles like Excel Saga and Azumanga Daioh.  They had a lot of talented voice actors who worked exclusively for them, so when the company went under in 2006, these actors went largely without work.

They were finally able to pull themselves out of the ashes in 2008, thanks to a licensing deal with Sentai Filmworks, but the magic has faded.  Their dub releases since then have ranged from `mediocre' (example, Clannad) to `awful' (example, Highschool of the Dead) to `didn't even bother dubbing it' (example, Maria-Holic).  The swill they produce now isn't even remotely as good what they were able to produce in their glory days, which is why watching a dub like Saiyuki is like looking through a time capsule for me.  It's a happy piece of nostalgia, showing me everything that was wonderful about an era long gone with time.

Overall, Saiyuki may appear bland and unimpressive to the discerning eyes of seasoned anime viewers, but if you can get past it's technical limitations and throwaway plot, you'll have an enjoyable story with some loveable characters.  Yes, there's little to no plot payoff...  From what I hear, there isn't any in the other incarnations, either...  But just from the individual story arcs, there are plenty of jaw-drop moments, lots of great dialogue, and you'll be on the edge of your seat quite a few times by the end.  This particular journey may never reach it's destination, but you won't regret going along for the ride.

I give Saiyuki three stars.",1350518400,,7953,4.768667642752562

Luckily the video quality and sound quality are MUCH higher than the bootlegged version I saw in high school. Also, there are mistakes on the episode descriptions on the back of the thin-pack boxes.

2634639,1,B000HDR89Q,"If you are new to the Saiyuki series, you should start with the manga. If you are a fan of the manga, stick to it and never attempt to watch any of the anime version.

Why?

Well, for one thing, the animation quality is really awful. It is nothing like Kazuya Minekura's artwork. The animation also fluctuates sometimes, like it's obvious they where rushing it, or didn't care where it was going. At times, it seems like your watching a really cheap Saturday morning cartoon. Not to mention, some episodes have limited animation (yuck!). The characters designs in here are really bad, like I said, nothing like Ms. Minekura's beautiful art. Do not let the artwork displayed on the box fool you.

Most of the episodes (more than half, about like 35 of the 50 eps) are filler. Really awful filler. They have nothing to do with the story arcs in the manga and a lot of the time have the characters go way out-of-character. It is just atrocious and they're all boring to sit through. Very terrible script writing. The whole second half of the episodes (called ""season 2"") is totally filler. Homura and his posse are not in the manga.

A lot of things from the manga aren't kept in the animated version either. Blame it on censorship, I guess. The animated version does not have blood, where the manga version does - and a lot of it + gore(limbs and guts everywhere). Sanzo doesn't really ""banish"" the demons with his ""exorcist gun"", he really shoots them to death with his S&W. Hakkai's sister Kanan is not mentioned as such and, for some reason, Jeep is called ""Hakuryu"". There is a few other differences here and there, as well.

All the same can also be said about it's ""sequel"" animes: ""Saiyuki Reload"" & ""Saiyuki Reload Gunlock"". Its just not worth it to watch them. The movie is also something terrible in it's own league.

If you love to sit through very poor adaptations of manga that are mostly filler in nature, then you'd love this.
If you want to see Saiyuki for what it truly is, then start reading the manga (""Saiyuki"" volumes 1-9, followed by ""Saiyuki Reload"" volumes 1-9* (*so far, is still ongoing).",1246838400,4,2112,4.588859416445623

To be honest though, the anime is kinda.. boring.

This set it over-priced is what I really want to say.
I got it for about $60 on ebay.",1216684800,,223,3.8260869565217392
2634641,5,B000HDR89Q,"No extras so it's to much money for this. i want the extras. Ok I got this series long before it even came out to the US, but waited to make a review till I got the english version to. I loved the japanese version with the english subs. You often have to give it to the japanese voice actors, they can also do a outstanding job on showing the true emotions of the characters. I love this series so much. 4 hot bad a** guys are suppose to save the world and try to stay alive doing so day by day when demons attack. One is the priest and the other 3 are half breed demons. Kwel something worth watching that is funny, action pack and sometimes they show feelings. This series was so funny in english and japanese, but I normally watch in english bein that I can only understand that kind of language. DUH.
1). english version was a 6 out of 10.
I didn't like Hakkai's voice in english it should of been more gentle. the guy sounded to deep and it just didn't work for me, but everyone else was ok, but Sanzo did cuss alot more than in the japanese version. I really didn't feel for the english which was really weird dudes 7 chicks.

2) japanese with subtitles was 9 out of 10.
I loved the japanese version better really. The actors in the japanese version just moved me and drawed me in to everything they said. But they had subs for the english version subs and the japanese version subs. Awesome i thought them putting the real version that was made with the remake version subs was a good idea.

Good job ADV films. Everynow and then you guys can do a good job, but mostly not always and you guys always leave out the extras in the thin packs, like yet again this and even the anime series Getbackers which is pretty good but also recommend it mostly to girls really. It's got alot of hotty bad boy guys again in that series, but it was a good series.

All in all this series is something to watch but if you are a type of person who does both english and japanese languages please do the english first cause you probably get upset too, when you find out your sweet, nice guy with a smile, that his the perfect sweet gentle voice changes in a some what smart a** jerk that has a deeper sound and doesn't have that right feel for the character. Anyways GREAT ANIME and the MUSIC IS AWESOME for the first and second season I thought. I got the entire collections of cds which are hard to find now and rare cds. Check out my other reviews I also write about manga and you might see a cd in there every now and then. Ok later
I really laughed on this series and alot of action. the guys are awesome.",1214092800,,2598,4.1610337972166995
2634642,5,B000HDR89Q,"Saiyuki is probably one of many best series out there after full metal panic and gundam wings. Anybody whose a big anime fan that likes comedy, action and a well thought out storyline would definitely want to put this in their collection. Delivery was good i got it within a couple of days with another list of anime.",1207353600,,317,4.482758620689655
2634643,5,B000HDR89Q,"This looks like the fansub of (just) season one I got from Hong-Kong on eBay for $40...best working fansub/deal ever. ^__^ This is a fantastic shoujo anime that breaks away from tired scardy-flawed heroine series like Sailor Moon & Card Captor Sakura. I reccomend this to girls who liked Hunter X Hunter & Yu-Yu Hakusho. It's however shoujo enough that guys don't seem to like it. Those that do don't care for Reload or Gunlock, & those that do usually don't tell their anime lovin' guyfriends about that. For BL fans, this series is open-ended slashy, but not so in-your-face that it will offend girls who aren't down with that. Minekura-sensei crafted it that way with all types in mind.",1189987200,,689,4.75
2634644,5,B000HDR89Q,"Wow talk about never getting bored. Saiyaki is one of those animes IMO you like from the first few minutes of it. It's so colorful and with an COOOL story to match. Saiyuki is also for adults. So make sure the young kids don't walk in the room while watching it.
Back to the story one word AWESOME! Sometimes when I'm watching a TV show I get bored and I watch the clock, I can honestly say that didn't happen watching this Anime! Everytime a esp ended I just watched the next one wanting to see what would happen next!
Oh and the music is so catchy! My favorite is the second season opening theme song. The series is Very Funny and Action Packed! =) And BRAVO to the Dubbed cast ADV did a GREAT job with this one! Everybody matched their character perfectly! This is what anime is all about! ^_^",1187740800,3,796,4.243421052631579
2634645,5,B000HDR89Q,"OK, this is the first anime series I ever purchased, so I am a bit biased.  Only after seeing other series - and a few episodes of Saiyuki Reload, do I think my bias is not entirely misplaced.  Rumor has it that women are the biggest fans, so I guess, I'm guilty.  I understand why women like the program.  The plot is pretty simple: 4 somewhat flawed, handsome young men with attitude trying to save the world.  And the whole concept of the ""bad guys"" being sympathetic is something I agree with and rarely see. The characters are interesting.

I've read some other reviews that say Sensomaden Saiyuki does not have enough character development.  I would somewhat disagree.  My flippant answer would be to say, ""It's a lightweight action, comedy series, how much do you need?""  Then I would ask, ""Did you not listen to the Merciful Goddess who points out continually that no matter how many times these souls are reincarnated, they do not change?  They continually live their lives as they choose.""  Here's a hint though, there are some small changes in ""Reload"".  Spend these 50 episodes enjoying the journey and look at the subtleties in the relationships between characters.

Visually the first two or three episodes are a little rough, but things smooth out before you get to the second disc.

Since it was my first series, I am guilty of watching them over and over.  I find I can take them seriously or view them as fluff.  It has inspired an interest to read ""Journey to the West"", which I think should be a compliment.

Seasons 1 and 2 were Dubbed in English by ADV Films.  While the translation may not be perfect, the voice casting was excellent.  I happened to have purchased&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Saiyuki-Reload-Vocal-Album-V-2/dp/B000657NF4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Saiyuki Reload Vocal Album V.2</a>&nbsp;that aside from the music has two scenes from the series.  I could identify the characters speaking Japanese simply because I knew the ADV English versions so well.  The voice tonal qualities are so close.  I never noticed it when I just watched the shows in Japanese with subtitles.

I look forward to the continuing journey in Japanese with Reload and Gunlock.  I am not as sure I like the English dub as well.  Only time will tell.

I do also recommend Gensomaden&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Saiyuki-Requiem/dp/B0006HBLDW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Saiyuki: Requiem</a>&nbsp;if you cannot get enough.  It's a nice expanded episode with the last of the ADV production.  The English cast interviews were a nice surprise.",1179360000,18,2643,5.318840579710145
2634646,3,B000HDR89Q,"Having watched a few episodes of this series we became intrigued.  I purchased from a seller associated through Amazon here, but got the product brand new, unopened for less than half the price.  Shipping was prompt.

The quality of the DVDs seem very good.  Sound a picture are excellent.  The thin packaging is a boone!  However, it has only 3 language settings and every one displays subtitles!  We attempted to change the settings on multiple DVDs and still could not rid ourselves of the subtitles which is incredibly distracting and ruins the enjoyment of watching the show.",1167264000,5,580,4.917525773195877

 Saiyuki is based off the legend of the monkey king so if you enjoy dragon ball this might be up you alley.there's lots of action and fight scenes.this is also one of the first animes to use cg in the show itself.(computer graphics) this is one of my all time favorites.",1469318400,,461,4.065934065934066
