8555584,5,B00AP2DAUK,"This is another hot one from director al profit! All the natives of Detroit will love it.  It's the city where the baller T. Stuckey made his bones, from the beginning we see he has all the tools to be a huge record mogul but street life got in the way. This doc will show you his rise in the music game and how some arrogant moves cost him his freedom. (That's the opinion of some of his legal advisors anyway...) I don't want to give it all away, but if you love profiles of those who live the ""life"" you should like this one.  Oh and for all the fans of the late m.c. Proof you will like this a lot because he had a business relationship with T. Stuckey.  Dirty cops and hating a** informants also played a role in Stuckey's downfall.  (A reocurring theme in the incarcertion of street dons.) So for all my street doc fans add this one to the collection!",1365552000,,857,4.144578313253012
