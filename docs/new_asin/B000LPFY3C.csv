8163010,4,B000LPFY3C,"Donald Johnson and Kasia Kozak are EXCELLENT instructors.  Their dance DVDs are excellent.  My experience has been, so far, that the ""Anyone Can Dance DVDs, are very easy to follow and learn from.  Be careful though because some of the Latin DVD's are taught with the International style.  I'm a very frugal buyer, and I don't like paying $19.99 for this DVD.  It is what it's titled ""Absolute Beginners"". This is an excellent DVD for beginners. I spent many hours trying to find a better ""Bang for your buck"" deal, and haven't been able to so far.",1237161600,,548,4.608247422680412
8163011,5,B000LPFY3C,"Donald and Kasia do a great job of teaching fundamental steps to complete beginners. Plus, it is not a bad review for people at the intermediate level. I have 4 of their DVDs (Foxtrot, Waltz, Swing, and Cha Cha). These videos enabled me to go into new classes with some background already. This helps with confidence as a leader, which makes it more fun meeting new partners. Their DVDs are a great value for a beginner.",1184803200,8,420,4.5394736842105265
