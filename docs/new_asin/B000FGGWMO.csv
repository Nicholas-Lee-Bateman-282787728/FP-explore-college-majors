Peter's graphics are engaging, clear, and bring forth his message in a most meaning-full way!",1395705600,,179,5.206896551724138
8122278,4,B000FGGWMO,"If you can keep awake (I think the music is soothing) this
DVD has some really wonderful accounts on how the global
mind works...wonderful commentary and ideas that will keep you
saying "".....Hummmmmmmmmmm"" for quite a while.",1285027200,,225,5.108108108108108
8122279,4,B000FGGWMO,"I originally purchased this video because I saw it listed on the Monroe Institute's website.  If you liked the movie ""what the bleep do we know"", this is similar, yet explores different avenues of existence.  The video truly is eye opening, and can be watched many times, realizing something of value with each watch.  I wish it was longer, but I believe the concepts expressed are right on, and seem important, especially because humans take this world on which we live for granted to the point of foolishness. This video is uplifting, and helps you to believe that each person has power to affect our world.",1199577600,4,609,4.726415094339623
8122280,5,B000FGGWMO,"I ordered this DVD and 4 days later it arrived at my house, shrink wrapped and in good condition.  It was a gift, so I never actually viewed the DVD so I cannot comment on whether there were scratches on it, but I would highly doubt it.  It looked like it was new!",1181520000,,264,3.9622641509433962
