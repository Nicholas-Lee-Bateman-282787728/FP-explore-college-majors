2680171,3,B000JXYJNW,"This DVD is called ""WWE Unauthorized: Totally Unofficial and Uncensored!: Not Authorised Or Santioned By The WWE.""  It's a one hour DVD basically in the same vein as an ""E! True Hollywood Story"" type show.  It features interviews with Vince Russo, Tito Santana & ""Former WWF Hardcore Champion"" Bobcat.  It also features 2 writer's of wrestling books: Eric Francis (Broken Harts: The Life And Death Of Owen Hart) & Shaun Assael (Sex, Lies, and Headlocks).

It's totally a non-WWE endorsed DVD, and it says in the beginning the WWE threatned legal action over it.  Most surprising is that WWE ""Superstars"" Candice Michelle & Chris Masters are interviewed.  It looked like it was at a public appearance in a night club or something but it was obvious they didn't know where the interview would go.

The production is pretty campy.  It features B-Roll footage of the old 90's promotion AWF as well as the women's federation WEW.  It's zooms through WWE history at lightning speed and makes bogus claims like the 93,000 people at WrestleMania III as well as the WrestleMania #1 event ""grossed 4 million dollars.""

Shaun Assael comes off pretty well but also called Dr. George Zahorian...""Dr. John Zahorian"" as well as at Survivor Series '97 said ""Shawn Michaels put Bret Hart in the sharpshooter and the referee counted 1, 2, 3.""  *Rolls Eyes*

Vince Russo takes credit for the Sharpshooter spot in Montreal saying he, Vince McMahon & Jim Cornette all sat down and came up with tons of ideas for a finish and Bret shot them all down.  He also said ""Bret wanted to hand the belt over to Shawn the next night on RAW, but the problem was Bret was under contract to WCW the day after Survivor Series 1997"" which is totally not true as Bret was under contract to the WWF for weeks after the PPV.

Eric Francis comes off very lame as he said it was all Bret's ego and he wanted to keep the belt no matter what and wouldn't take no for an answer.  He came off ok with the Owen stuff since he knew more about it but also said the ""wrestling business is full of scumbags.""

Russo claims the only reason Vince McMahon didn't show up at the WCW ""Slamboree 98"" Pay Per View to fight Eric Bishoff was because Stephanie McMahon was graduating college on that very same Sunday.

Russo also slams Hulk Hogan for saying he believes too much in his character because on Hogan Knows Best...Hogan said ""not as long as my name is Hulk Hogan"", when his actual name is Terry Bollea.

Some other Russo quotes were that the only reason Owen Hart was the Blue Blazer in 1999 was to ""get over Owen's comedic genius"" as well as ""Vince McMahon has lost touch with the real world.""  Okay, I will give him that one.

If you are a huge wrestling fan like me and can find this for under 10 bucks, it's not that bad...",1159228800,15,2779,4.508982035928144
2680172,1,B000JXYJNW,i was going to get this dvd because for 1 month i was waiting to read a review or info but it said nothing and i would like to thank Lance for saving me the trouble of getting this and amazon really needs to change the listing.,1159056000,,227,3.851063829787234
2680173,1,B000JXYJNW,"First off this is NOT a WWE product and Amazon really should change the listing. With no product details some would think this is an official WWE DVD and it's not. It's another one of those ""backstage, real life"" looks at some of the wrestlers who use to be part of the WWE.

In MOP it's really a biased look at thee WWE from those who are no longer ""in the fold"" if you will and quite bitter about it. Rent it if you wish but buying is seriously not worth it nothing of value here to warrant a 2nd viewing.",1158796800,5,507,4.01980198019802
8153517,1,B000JXYJNW,"This movie's intentions are purely malicious. Yeah the WWE doesn't have a great track record, but some of the bold face lies in this ""Documentary"" are just laughable. The production values are bad, the ""experts"" you see talk about the business know next to nothing about, even the names of simple wrestling holds escapes them. Unless you're one of the people that like ""So bad it's good"" type stuff (The Room, Troll 2, Current TNA), DO  NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.",1495670400,,458,4.725

8153520,1,B000JXYJNW,"So this Dvd was not very good at all. It featured a lot of people who acted like they were present for events that they actually were not a part of. One interviewee commented on the ""Montreal Screw Job"" like he watched the match but quoted it as ending by a 1-2-3 count which it ended by submission. It featured a lot of Vince Russo who has been known to fabricate stories and a lot of what he said contradicts himself. It was a lot of speculation from ""sports writers"" and minor league athletes. It had a few no name WWE stars but for the most part was all no name wrestlers from no name corporations.",1236643200,,602,4.198275862068965
8153521,1,B000JXYJNW,"Please do not waste your time or money on this movie! Whether you are a wrestling fan looking for another perspective or a non-wrestling fan looking for more reasons to hate on wrestling, leave this video alone because it is chalk full of lies!

Wrestling fans like myself will find themselves really aggravated by the lies told in this film. I cannot speak as though I am a wrestling insider of any kind but some of the things that stick out as false in this video can easily be proven so just by having watched the shows. For instance, the movie claims that Vince McMahon's evil on screen persona is referred to as ""The Evil Commissioner."" They work very hard to drive this monikor home. There is just one problem with that: Vince has never referred to himself as the evil commissioner. In fact, some of his important characters on his shows were commissioners (Slaughter, HBK, Foley, Regal, Bischoff, etc). Vince was always just Mr. McMahon, owner and chairman of WWF(E).

There is also a claim in the movie regarding the Montreal Screwjob that Bret Hart was pinned for a fast three count. Anyone that knows anything about it knows that this is not how he was screwed. He had the match ended when he was in a submission hold but had not actually tapped out. One man on the movie also claims that Bret was claiming openly that he was not going to lose the belt because he was going to take it with him to WCW. We all know that this is not true because even the people that screwed him said that it wasn't. Bret had always said that he was going to give the belt to Vince the next night on Raw. Vince concurred and so did another Vince who was there at the time, Vince Russo.

Now these things may not seem like a major deal but things that are so easily proven false lead to a number of the ugly situations that they raise having to be questioned by necessity. How can any of it be credible if even the simplest details are not?

Add to it the fact that while the movie was released in 2006, it does not go past 1999. It ends pretty much immediately following Owen's tragic passing. This movie was a waste of my time and certainly my money. I definately do not recommend viewing this film of complete and utter falsehood.",1212796800,4,2223,4.375302663438257

8153523,4,B000JXYJNW,"I'll take a very different perspective on this. I have been in the business for more than 10 years now. This type of film is the ""B"" of the A/B perspective. It is NOT from or by the WWF/WWE. Nor is it intended for those fans.

It IS, however, a good look at the other end of the company. A wrestler is either happy with a company or they are not. EVERY company dumps on a few workers here and there. This is the dumped on worker's views. In all honesty; the truth of the matter is somewhere in-between this film and a few ""history of"" and ""Story of"" DVDs/VHS tapes that the WWF/E put out. It's good at the <$6 point to see and understand the other side of things.

WATCH IT FOR YOUR SELF AND MAKE UP YOUR OWN MIND.",1179705600,,714,4.02112676056338
8153524,1,B000JXYJNW,"Okay I'll admit I did not see this cause I don't have too. It's just another example of lying documentaries like those of Michael Moore's.

Sure people will say I can't knock it cause I didn't see it, but any DVD with the headline of  ""We sit down with Vince Russo, the WWE writer responsible for shaping the personas of The Rock, Stone Cold Steve Austin and others""  tells me it is not worth my time cause it is in fact a lie.  Vince Russo always tries to takes credit for things he never did and when he came to WCW it was proof that he had nothing to do with the success of the WWE. It is an insult to The Rock, Steve Austin, and wrestling fans in general to say he was what shaped the personas of The Rock and Steve Austin.",1163980800,4,727,4.027777777777778
8153525,2,B000JXYJNW,this was alright for the money but what dissapointed me most was all of the footage was of the old AWA wrestling and they had no wwe and old days wwf footage but they gave a good description of the bret hart story and owen hart. Overall this was okay if you have 8 bucks to waste,1161043200,8,279,3.912280701754386
