They are a good pace, nice scenery and for me 35 minutes on my elliptical is all I can do at least for now.  Just wish he would do a Paris one.  I have several of this series and no dud yet.",1456012800,,283,3.912280701754386
8450873,5,B00508VTKC,This dvd really kicked my backside!  I love the area so I stayed engaged plus it really pushed me.  Excellent buy!,1377043200,,114,4.380952380952381
8450874,5,B00508VTKC,"I love riding my bike with this dvd. It makes it enjoyable and takes my mind off of the fact that I'm sitting there riding a stationary bike! The guided tour requires a bike that you can ride in a standing position which I do not have.  I just use the basic ride option, and follow the speed of the video which works just fine. I have several of the virtual active dvd's, they're all good, but this one is my favorite.",1360022400,2,418,4.097560975609756
8450875,5,B00508VTKC,"I enjoyed hiking through parts of California that I haven't seen. My workout today was on a combination of several different exercise machines. I did well staying in my 'fat-burning' zone. I'm still exhausted.

The thing I love about these hikes is the natural beauty. Our guide gives us lots of encouragement and praise, but he doesn't do much talking. He lets us enjoy the beauties of nature and the workout, which is as tough as we want it to be. The scenery is gorgeous! I feel like I get very close to the experience of visiting these places, which makes my workout time fly by.

This time I remembered to bring two bottles of water and drank one of them. Next time I'm going to wear better hiking shoes. I'm not sure which hike (or run) I'm going to do next. I think I have all of the VirtualActive hikes. I've enjoyed every one I've tried so far. I recommend them.",1331251200,2,871,4.37037037037037
8450876,5,B00508VTKC,"This is a 40-minute 'guided' video which appears to be designed for spinning. No problem if you are using some other kind of forward-motion equipment. I have a spin bike that I'll enjoy riding through this video in the future. This time I found it to be just fine for my own 'fitness' purposes using my Precor bike and other exercise equipment. Anything that works with a 'forward-motion' works just fine. I have what I guess you could call a hobby, a large collection of videos that I use while I'm working out. I got this one because it was in one of my favorite areas of California. Other than that, I had no idea what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised.

The first surprising thing about it was unique music and a female voice that reminded me of the voice on my navigation system, except much more natural and pleasant. In other words, there wasn't any conversation, just very brief, but specific, instruction. She speaks pleasantly, and enough motivation that when she suggests that I grab some water, I do it---every time. I needed it too. Good workout!

This video is very specifically designed for spinning training. The narrator carefully instructs when to change arm and leg positions, switch to standing or sitting, and more. The instructions are very specific. There is a rider icon on the screen demonstrating what we are supposed to do. It was helpful but didn't get in the way. The case says, ""For best results, use these workouts with an indoor cycle that permits standing ride positions.""  During the times when our guide is giving those instructions, the orders come fast enough that the rider will be focused on following the instructions rather than watching the scenery. I was not using my spin bike when I viewed this. Even though I couldn't follow those instructions because I wasn't using my spin bike, I enjoyed watching and listening. It certainly took nothing away from the value of it for me. I can see that it would have been extremely helpful to a spin biker though--and fun. I'll try that next time. It doesn't look easy.

The workout ""alternates between moderate and hard intensity segments."" We get to visit the desert areas of Death Valley National Park and Joshua Tree National Park. Then we go to wonderful trails in the woods of Yosemite and along the Pacific coast, Highway 1/Los Angeles.

Most of the ride is through very scenic territory. Some of it is on intensely rugged paths that I wouldn't walk on, much less ride through. That was fun. Occasionally we get a very nice view of the scenery around us, which is magnificent.

Just as I thought I couldn't go any further, it changed to the next ride, Big Sur!!! I was re-energized. It also slowed down a little, and I was ready by that time. Of course I have an 'override system' on my own equipment in case I want to go faster (or slower) than our 'guide' tells us to go, but I tried to follow her instructions as closely as possible.

I got a great workout and enjoyed the gorgeous scenery.",1330560000,6,2987,4.624528301886793
