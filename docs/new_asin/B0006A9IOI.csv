8310816,3,B0006A9IOI,I tried to watch this however I found trying to adjust the sound so that I could understand what was being said a little frustrating.,1366329600,,133,4.36
8310817,2,B0006A9IOI,"First of all--what is a ""docu-fiction"" film???? Is is ""true"" or ""fiction?"" Extremely confusing. I'm assuming it is FICTION since some of the people being interviewed seem like B actors.
The scenery is gorgeous and the basic ""ghost"" story is unusual and this COULD have been a really great ""docu-fiction"" (whatever THAT is) but instead, it is extremely slow-moving---I think the film makers think they are keeping you in suspense, but in reality, just keep repeating the same things over & over & over .... we almost turned this ""docu-fiction"" off twice, but decided to continue to give it a chance and, if for nothing else, some great scenery.
I would not really recommend anyone buy this DVD... unless you can borrow it from the library or a friend for free. Or if you are planning on visiting Greece where this was filmed or maybe it was ""fictionally"" filmed there; afterall, this is a ""docu-fiction"" .... ???? PLEASE--do NOT let this become a genre of films ... it's only confusing and contradictory. Ack!",1219622400,2,1008,4.832369942196531
