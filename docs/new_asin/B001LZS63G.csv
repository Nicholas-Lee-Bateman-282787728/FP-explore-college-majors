8320199,1,B001LZS63G,"I just finished watching the Simply Breastfeeding DVD (previewing it to see if it was appropriate for a class I am teaching...I have nearly identical credentials to the author) and thought Shari was doing a decent job until about halfway through when she started describing techniques and giving advice that horrified me. Watching her talk about the 'best' feeding position (sitting bolt upright while wearing a nursing pillow up to her armpits, sticking her elbow straight out and holding her breast up throughout the feeding) was comical, but when she started dishing out poor advice that can contribute to slow weight gain, I was aghast! Limiting nursing time to 5 minutes on the first few days of life because she claims it can cause sore nipples? Using a pacifier instead of feeding a hungry baby? Telling mothers to trust that their babies are getting enough milk - even if they are still crying after feeding? Really???!!! NO mention of soiled diapers to determine if baby is getting enough milk in the early days (THE most important indicator of adequate intake.) Anyone who calls their teachings about breastfeeding a 'method' needs to be avoided. This is just plain bad breastfeeding and medical advice. Stick to the trusted experts (Ruth Lawrence, Jack Newman, Marsha Walker, Diana West, Nancy Mohrbacher, Christina Smillie, Alison Stuebe, etc.) Shari Criso is not one of them.",1494547200,,1388,5.065502183406114
8320200,5,B001LZS63G,"Best breastfeeding info out there!!!! I'm a first time mom, and was able to watch these videos and it help beyond what I can even express. She is amazing and so informative. She's very clear in explaining possible complications and how to work through them without giving up on breast feeding. These videos gave me the confidence and determination to press through any challenges and do what is best for my baby. I learned that breastfeeding is something I can be a pro at as long as I have the right information and developed skill. I highly recommend these videos!",1459987200,,566,4.67
8320201,5,B001LZS63G,"I purchased this DVD set after I came home with baby from the hospital. I really wish I had done so a month before I gave birth, even though I went into labor 3 1/2 weeks early. My baby was born with some jaundice and we were forced to stay in hospital for three days. All my fears of breastfeeding would have been calmed a lot had I watched this DVD set beforehand. The hospital staff was all so helpful and well meaning but I still couldn't help but feel inadequate, incompetent and fearful. Shari Criso is so informative and seems so patient. Even my partner was interested and learned a few things. Every pregnant woman who plans to breastfeed and needs some guidance should watch this - I recommend two months in advance of due date. Good luck!",1277683200,,749,4.39568345323741
8320202,5,B001LZS63G,"As an experienced mom and two-time breastfeeding ""dropout"", I was hesitant to attempt breastfeeding our third child.  In the end I thought that ""third times a charm"" and gave it another try.  I completely attribute my breastfeeding success this time to the information provided in this DVD.  Shari's innovative approach to the material and her warm, supportive, and non-judgmental tone is just what I needed in order to not only learn the basics  (and yes it IS simple!) but give me the confidence to make it happen.

She does a terrific job of explaining common breastfeeding challenges in ways that make so much sense and give you a clear picture of what to expect especially in the first few hours, days and weeks when establishing habits are so critical.

This DVD has made my life so much easier. I have read so many breastfeeding books and I would have saved a lot time, money and stress if I had only watched this first!  I cannot praise this DVD highly enough and my only complaint is that it was not available sooner!",1238371200,,1026,4.6353591160221

Simply Breastfeeding is hands down the BEST resource for new moms out there.  Breastfeeding has not been the most popular choice in the past, but this video is paving the way to a new wave of moms who make the best choice for their kids!

Shari Criso is a sincere, honest educator and delivers her message in a gentle, non-judgmental way.  She doesn't make you feel like a bad mom if you are considering bottle-feeding, but gives you the facts and the tools that make breastfeeding an easy choice to make.

I would even recommend this DVD to Moms who have been-there-done-that.  Having nursed three children, I learned a thing or two that I didn't know for my next one!

And don't forget the Dads!  Since Shari's live class is for both parents, she makes it easy for Dads to watch the DVD and not feel left out.

With this video, any woman could successfully breastfeed their baby.  It's a real MUST-HAVE for all new parents!",1227657600,2,1115,5.35632183908046
8320204,5,B001LZS63G,"After reviewing the Simply Breastfeeding DVD, I wish I had this information when I was breastfeeding my first baby. I wouldn't have given up so quickly! Had I known how small the baby's stomach was and that she was indeed getting enough milk and if I had known the proper latch method, I would have been more successful at breastfeeding!

What's great about this DVD is you can skip chapters to find the answer to whatever breastfeeding dilemma you are facing at that moment -- even if it is in the middle of the night. Shari's approach is warm and her expertise shows! After delivering over 600 babies in her career and working intimately with couples over the past 19 years, Shari shines!

I am so glad that Shari offers her breastfeeding method on a DVD to share with those who cannot visit her learning center for a personal consult. Great DVD! I highly recommend it to all new moms!!!",1227484800,,889,4.55
