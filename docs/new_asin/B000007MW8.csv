1196413,5,B000007MW8,saw this movie one saturday morning on Comedy Central and it had me cracking up! i HAD to add it to my collection!,1178928000,2,114,4.0
1196414,5,B000007MW8,"This movie is a one-of-a-kind. Never again will you see this kind of inoccent comedy which is very funny. I remember seeing it when younger, and now my daughter has me seeing it 20 times a day. I still watch it each time and laugh. Mandel and lloyd are hilarious in this 80's film. Great for kids. My daughter is 3 and shes hooked on BOBO.....",1111968000,7,343,4.212121212121212
1196415,5,B000007MW8,"This is a totally awesome movie not because of awesome special effects, not because it is particularly well written, not because it is at all believable because trust me it's not very realistic at all.  The Walk Like A Man works because, it is extremely funny and it has an awesome message.  I am very disabled and this movie shows why it is ok to be different.  The movie shows how sometimes what people see as different is in many ways better than what most people call ""normal"".  For all Walk Like A Man Lacks in traditional movie POP and FIZZ it makes up for in its message of heart.  The movie is more slap stick comedy than serious.  If you want a more serious Boy Raised by Wolves Tale I would suggest LUCAN.

  This is a movie to watch if you still have the heart of child like innocence and you are feeling down and just wanting to feel good afterwards.  This is not the movie for those who want something deep, meaningful and spiritual.  Walk Like A Man is an hour or so of weird fun with an awesome message at the end.  I brought a copy of Walk Like A Man from Amazon. COM on DVD and at 46 I still enjoy watching.  OyVey who knows if I will ever grow up AND LOVING IT!",1111536000,4,1179,4.118421052631579

1196419,5,B000007MW8,This has to be just about the funniest movie I ever saw. Howie Mandel is excellent as Bobo a man lost in the woods for 28 years raised by wolves. This movie is very kid friendly and good family entertainment. There is no sex or violence in the movie. I very highly recommend Walk Like A Man to anyone who enjoys laughing a lot.,1029196800,9,327,4.125
1196420,4,B000007MW8,"This movie is one of the eighties funniest. Bobo (Howie Mandel) was lost in the woods as a child.

1196422,4,B000007MW8,"Great movie- loved to watch as kid! My complaint though is for this MGM Limited Edition, you would expect they would take more time to make this a better dvd release. There aren't any episode/tracks (they just jump in something like 10 minute intervals), and the quality is like from a VHS tape. Forget also about any special features- commentary or notes etc. about the movie. If this dvd was under $10, I wouldn't be complaining, but to pay $17 for a dvd of a movie from the 80s, is a bit too much..glad to have it, but MGM has to work on their releases..",1487894400,,557,4.314285714285714

1196438,4,B000007MW8,"Howie Mandel at his peek. Before he became a germophobic game show host, Mandel relied on his off the wall comedy style and a lot of drugs to make a living. This is a funny story about a heir to billions who was pushed off a sled and left in the wilderness as a boy by his selfish older brother. Now, 28 years later, he is found by a wilderness activist and taken home in time to claim his inheritance, much to the chagrin of his imbecilic older brother and his hard drinking wife, who were only weeks away from getting his brothers lottery loot. They plot to get him to learn to write his name so he can sign over his money to his brother and be left with nothing. When it doesn't look like that will happen, they go to extreme measures to get their greedy hands on his innocent brothers money. Funny and charming, Mandel got a lot of attention after this breakout performance.",1450742400,,878,4.263473053892215

1196446,1,B000007MW8,"Plan 9 From Outer Space by the notorious filmmaker Ed Wood was so bad it was good, a laugh a-minute because it was intended to be serious. Sure, the acting was atrocious, and some of the sets were hysterical, but that's what makes it so unbelievably hilarious even today. ""Walk Like a Man"" can't hold a candle to the film-making wizardry that is Plan 9 From Outer Space. The wannabe comedic antics appear like they were written by a seven-year-old who overdosed on Ovalteen or a college freshman who took one too many hits of Metamucil on a Saturday night! The result is a movie that is supposed to be comedy that instead of making you laugh makes you cringe as every pathetic line that tries to be funny is outdone by an even more pathetic line. I mean, just when you think the movie can't get any worse, it passes all expectation by becoming even more unbelievably stupid by the minute.

The relatively impressive cast of Christopher Lloyd and Cloris Leachman. cannot save this bottom of the barrel embarrassment masquerading as a movie. I've seen first graders write stuff more clever than this. The ""lines"" of dialog, which seem more akin to banter at a college fraternity party than a written script are just about as bad as they come. The writers must have worked very hard to come up with the worst jokes and clich lines that Hollywood has ever attempted.

The only thing more ridiculous than the movie itself is the premise. A family strikes it rich in the gold country, and as they are driving their sled through the snow back to civilization, they ""accidentally"" lose their youngest son! Well, it looks like he's pushed off the sled by his older brother so he can have more of the gold they discovered! Twenty-eight years later, the brother, nicknamed Bobo, is discovered by an animal scientist among a pack of wolves, but he doesn't act as much like a wolf as the filmmakers want you to believe. Actually wolves have a certain reserved dignity about them. The guy who thinks he's a wolf really isn't acting like a wolf at all, more like a deranged bull dog who scratches himself in funny parts of his body, if he's not licking new acquaintances on their chins. I don't buy that the wolves would have accepted this guy either! I think the wolves took one look at him and went, ""Get this creep out of here!""

Christopher Lloyd plays, or maybe barely animates, the brother (the one who pushed him off the sled 28 years earlier) who is a cross between Scrooge and Atilla the Hun. He has tons of money from the inheritance of the gold, we presume, and this slothful impetuous monster is hated by everyone. He makes Bertie Wooster (of Jeeves and Wooster) appear like an intellectual saint. Not even his mother, Cloris Leachman, shows much love but rather appears to be on the verge of either slipping into a coma, or becoming a cat, a fate not unlike her ""wolfish"" grandchild! Instead of taking care of herself, she dotes on her kitties! The plot revolves around whether or not the ""canine"" brother can inherit his part of the money, or else stay like a, er, ""wolf"", I guess. Or is he more like a dog who thinks he's a wolf? Or is it the other way around?

When Bobo finally ""comes home"" and starts licking Christopher Lloyd's face off, it became clear to me that the projector lights may be on but nobody's home. Or maybe this ""movie"" is a few screwballs short of a funny farm. On ""Sneak Previews"", the original show featuring film critics Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert, they always had a ""dog of the week"", usually a film so outrageously embarrassing that it earned a quick loving remark at the end of the show. This movie gets my vote for the dog of the century, in more ways than one.",1432512000,,3691,4.512705530642751

Howie Mandel stars as Bobo Shand, a man who has been raised by wolves for the past 28 years. He soon found by Penny, played by Amy Steel. She returns him to his rich eccentric family lead by his conniving brother, Reggie. Reggie hires Penny to get Bobo to talk right and to spell his name so he can get his inheritance.

Without giving too much away, Howie Mandel is raised by wolves and literally walks, barks, and runs like a wolf would. I do not know how to exactly describe this, but it is brilliant and hilarious. You see how he tries to adapt to the real world. After a while, the plot seems to become a little ludicrous and the movie can kinda start to drag towards the end, but let's just say Howie Mandel pulls off a role that is well-done and unlike any other role for any character in any film.

That was the funniest part that I remembered from watching it while in the Navy in Japan during the mid 80's.  It was still funny and all my children and my wife laughed.  The fact that it was made in the 80's does show but it is still funny.  It also contains a lot more facts than any Al Gore or Michael Moore movies.,1184803200,2,448,3.774193548387097
