8122063,5,B000FGFBLC,I'm a big fan of Neil Patrick Harris. This movie was full of suspense and the acting was excellent. I recommended it to family and friends.,1360540800,,139,4.384615384615385
8122064,3,B000FGFBLC,"Though Neil Patrick Harris is great, I have seen him in far more interesting roles than this.  There is too much missing background about the parents. There is only a hint of what life was like growing up in this abusive household. Also there is no indication until the end credits that this is based on a true story.",1355097600,,317,4.372881355932203

8122066,4,B000FGFBLC,"This was good, suprised I never heard of it before.  Plot twists until the end, and you get to like these kids and understand how it could all happen.",1202428800,4,150,4.172413793103448
8122067,5,B000FGFBLC,"If you are into drama, thrillers, or suspense, this movie is a must see.  The producers couldn't ask for a better actor than Neil Patrick Harris, he truly displayed an excellent performance.  This movie, which is based on a true story, is so disturbing that it will make you cringe. It is so heart felt that it will make you cry.  Sudden Fury opened the door for people too see that every family that seems loving and every parent you wish to model are not necessarily what it seem to be.  Sudden Fury exposes the truth that mental, emotional and verbal abuse takes place in all types of environments and if not attentive many of us may never know of its existence.",1163203200,9,665,4.426229508196721
