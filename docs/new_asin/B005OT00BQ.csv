The message was positive and reinforced what I already know, however there was nothing new or profound that you won't get from every other source on this topic.  Very poor production and soundtrack.  Definitely not worth $15.",1329523200,,267,5.0227272727272725
8481764,5,B005OT00BQ,"If you sense a change within yourself, as we approach 2012, you'll love this DVD. Ordinary people welcome you into their lives to share with you the extraordinary changes taking place during this amazing evolutionary shift!  If you are experiencing your own shift, I think you will feel a deep connection, as I did, to the people in this documentary. They share intimate details about their lives before and after their personal shift. I now know I am not alone and that people all over the planet are awakening to their greatness.  What an exciting time !!!",1320537600,,558,4.742268041237113
8481765,5,B005OT00BQ,"Real People, Real Shifts shows us regular people with ordinary jobs and typical lives having experiences that can't be explained away.  I think this will help many know that they are not the only ones experiencing the fact that we truly are living in ""a new normal"" Once upon a time humankind believed that the sun rotated around the earth and that same earth was thought to be flat.  This documentary reminds us that just because we have believed something for a long time doesn't make it so.  It also shows us that just because we don't understand something or haven't experienced it personally, doesn't mean that it isn't real.  Real People, Real Shift gives explanation of many experiences and confirmation of others.  The subject matter is  interesting, entertaining, well thought out, well explained and full of useful, insights.",1320192000,,835,4.971223021582734
8481766,5,B005OT00BQ,"What I liked about this movie was the Broad perspective of change happening around our entire planet and the specific stories that brought it all home.  People from the military, like myself, Corporate Executives and others deeply entrenched in 3D programming were waking up to a much bigger picture through their own Awakening.  This documentary was wonderfully done, capturing the essence and spirit of each person and their transformation.  Our journey on this planet is exceptionally our own but collectively we are all One and it is personified here in this video through the multitude of experiences from a variety of backgrounds.  We're going Quantum in every aspect of our lives and it is being shown and understood here through the story tellers, their journeys and experiences. Many of us are opening up to a whole new way of being here.  It's beautifully expressed here in this video ""Real People, Real Shifts.""  Highly recommend and will appeal to a large variety of audiences.",1318032000,,989,5.03680981595092
