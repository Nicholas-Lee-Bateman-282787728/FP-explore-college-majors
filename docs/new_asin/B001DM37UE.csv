But the last two video was excellent and kind of interesting to see telly savalas  play the bad guys in the last video.  It was kind of shock to see him play that role, and goes after his partners of crime that was with him. Wow, but it was very Good.",1462320000,,338,3.926470588235294
8294040,3,B001DM37UE,"Writing this review specifically because I wasn't very pleased with this purchase. And don't no what DVD set the guy at the top got who wrote these are good video transfers and are presented in widescreen,but surely it was not this set.  First off none of these are presented in widescreen and all are from vhs sources.  The qaulity ranges from good to downright atrocious,there are vcr tracking marks on some of the films as well. Youve been warned",1433462400,,449,4.670886075949367

8294043,4,B001DM37UE,"I have a love/hate relationship with videoasia, I love a lot of the content they release, but the print and transfer quality is often abysmal, this set is an exception, these are some great good ""bad"" roadhouse action films from the 60's and 70's and the prints and transfers are much better then any other videoasia set I've seen.",1346803200,2,331,4.627118644067797
8294044,4,B001DM37UE,"The films in the set are different than a previous reviewer listed (He had more Asian films). The films are:

Tony Arzeta-A film about a hitman getting revenger for the death of his family.
Bandidos- a western about the hunt for a killer and his band who never leave anyone alive
Blind Rage-about a bunch of blind men robbing a bank
Godfather's Daughter... -a film concerning some people fighting the triads
The Italian Mob Trilogy-Manhunt, The Boss and Milan Calibre 9
City Rats about kids in Mexico
Redneck- with Telly Savalas and Franco Nero as Jewel robbers who have a heist go wrong
New Mafia Boss- which is about guy from the country rising up through the Mafia ranks in Italy.

The reason I'm writing the review is to say that the picture and sound of the film is much better than the usual material that Videoasia puts out. Normally the prints they use come from well worn pan and scan video copies with lots of break ups. One need only look at there set of military movies called Merc to see what I mean (several of the movies have several minutes of picture break ups from their source tape). Here the prints seem to be from excellent or very good video sources, with most of the films presented in widescreen. I'm guessing they are sourced from DVDs since in the case of at least one of the Italian Mob Trilogy one can see some frames of a DVD menu before the film starts. Homestly with two exceptions this is the best looking collection they've turned out.

The two exceptions are New Mafia Boss which seems sourced from a complete pan and scan videotape copy. I mention this since I had just watched the film a couple of nights before I looked at this copy DVD in  worn letterboxed copy titled Crime Boss in a set called Men of Action that was put out from BCI and which was missing about a minute at the start and end of the movie. Given my choice I'd take that copy over the one in this set since the letterboxed image is better composed (though to be perfectly honest this is a watchable copy its just not as good as the other 8 films in the set). The other film which has BIG problems is City Rats which comes from a very poor video master with a poor picture and  garbled sound. I would say that there is something wrong with the disc except that I know Videoasia's product and this is probably the copy they used. This is possibly the worst print I've ever seen from the company and I find it odd that its mixed in with the best editions they've turned out.

I've seen most of the films in the set and for the most part they are all good, though I do have to say Blind Rage is good in a bad film sort of way and The Godfather's Daughter has good action but a lousy plot (They are the two weakest of the ten films). The best of the bunch is probably Bandidos  which is a mean and nasty western. I won't go into how the films are individually beyond that since you can probably find more detail on the films elsewhere (Say Internet Movie Database). I will say that the collection is one of the better sets put out from Videoasia with more hits than misses, particularly for the price. Granted There are a few I won't watch again, but at the same time there are a few I will happily watch again.

Over all this is a recommended set especially if you like Euro-crime dramas",1248739200,17,3288,4.30048465266559
