7965852,3,B000069HYK,"Yes, the movie is badly done - D rating on the way it was produced and directed. But acting isn't too horrible, especially on the part of Jim Davidson. The other actors can't speak much of but he is an exceptional actor and I just wish the movie had been better made to support an actor of his quality.",1445558400,,302,4.135593220338983
