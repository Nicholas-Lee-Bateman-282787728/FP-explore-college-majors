They are typically rather ingenuous (by American standards) nude  ""pictorials"" of attractive, mostly Japanese, models.  Some of the  ""models"" are actually porn stars - which is not such a bad thing  in Japan, where some of the better porn stars do gameshows and are the  featured voices of popular anime characters.
