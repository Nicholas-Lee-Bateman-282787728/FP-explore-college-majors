7866110,3,6304211597,"A story of a wife bored with her Parisian routine, looking for solace in various sex environment while growing up offspring, working and satisfying her husband.

Shocking decades ago, it is a very average today viewing of days passed.",1269993600,,234,5.0

1. The city has not lost significance. The reverse is true: its significance has been artificially strengthened to conform to a new kind of commercialism: the reification of the non-physical manifestations of ""post""-modern lifestyles. The city is now a Disneyland of its own former self plus all the imagined characteristics attached to it. Like I tought of before: what happens in Paris in the `60s is what happens in Bs. As. Only on the `80s or later.
2. Electricity and water: true, so true. But what we need is not in fact to forget the cost of things and use them as if they're free? To think about this kind of price all the time would make us crazy isn't?
3. The distribution of the city, Paris: well, we are seeing the results (2005 riots).
4. The colors and the play with them: the sixties look wonderful, so clean and so proper to human living: must have been a shock the intrusion of concrete at the same time of that colorful environment in clothes and artifacts. Now the concrete turns classic into browns and pseudo-old stuff (retro) and the clothes are more of a faded mode: maybe the fabrics are more important now.
5. The middle-low class woman prostituting: now they're the secretaries and so of the corporate world: the legal prostitutes, with their consent.
6. Camera movements and mise-en-escene: perfect in every frame.
7. The disconnection with the world and with others: crushing objectivity and isolated subjectivity: in the movie redention is possible; to transcend the frontiers language produce to my world (as in Orwell). I'm not so sure: the intent of the film when Godard doubts about the significance of words and how they are generated is to well for the `60s but pass after the fiasco of post-modernist tought: reality is back in social science. Anyway: the intent to redefine and show ""a conversation"" in cinema is utterly interesting, I feel engaged when I see this on screen.
8. A less educated girl at the beauty parlor: the technique os ""semi-interview"" is used, like in other Godards: we cant listen to the questions, only to the answers. The girl is so typical of her class: now she would be the same, but ""liberated"" of the need to acquire culture, call it Western or ""high"" or of the dominators: now capitalists have produced the illusion that they're free, that the low classes can have ""their"" culture and is all the same, all is valid: the result: no more critical books, no more critical cinema, no more critic, only big cars and prostitutes and garbage hip-hop: no Beatles here, where pop could be art. Popular now is only the filthy remains of culture's process of production for the masses.
9. How to show something that happens: the garage sequence. Interesting, but more for the film scholar, the interested in the problem of representation. Not for me, not now.",1185840000,5,2859,4.731462925851703
7866112,1,6304211597,"Godard's most intensive foray into the meaningless, blather of French philosophy in the 1960's.  Throughout, you are treated (unfairly) to the director's whispering voice-over, which is unbearable, while the content of his narration is even worse.  Even the child is a pretentious little wanker.  Overall, an extremely indulgent film that does nothing, says nothing and above all means nothing.  Godard is much more clever and effective when he uses techniques such as these in a more subtle, restrained fashion, such as in Pierrot Le Fou.  More proof why Existenialism, Post-Modernism, and Structuralism should be laid to waste.  I don't like Foucalt mixing with my Godard.  Perhaps a treat for those who admire this particular school of thought, but I really cannot stomach it.  Sorry.",1102982400,12,787,5.290322580645161
7866113,5,6304211597,"This is not a movie to be seen once.  After a couple of viewings it has really grown on me.  The cinematography is so astounding.  Do not be thrown off by the whispered narration.  By the end of the film it begins to serve a higher purpose than simply aggravating the viewer (which is what, for me, it initially did).  There are so many fascinating moments in this film both in terms of Godard's career and general film history.",1047427200,9,428,4.367088607594937
7866114,1,6304211597,"""What if blue was called green?"" ponders the main character in Jean-Luc Godard's disaster. Now after reading the above statemant how old would you think the character is? 10? 12? 15? Nope. All wrong! She's a  married women with two children. Now what married women thinks about such  stupid things!""How do I know that these are my eyes? Because I can see  with them.""Gee what a smart woman! The film makes no sense what so  ever! We follow Juliette(Marina Vlady)for 90 minutes. Why? I don't know.  What is this film about? Why are we following this woman? What purpose does  she serve to this film? I am unable to answer any of these questions. I'm  shocked that a director of the magnitude of Jean-Luc Godard has directed  such a film. This leads me to ask another question. Why is Godard doing a  voice-over? And why is he whispering? Not one thing makes any sense to me  throughout the entire movie. If you chose to watch Godard's films start off  with ""Breathless"". Skip this piece of junk!",962150400,9,994,4.590909090909091
