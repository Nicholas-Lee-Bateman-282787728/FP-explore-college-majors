5100095,5,B007N5YJRK,"When artists die, you hope someone curates a brilliant retrospective of his work. Steven Soderberg has taken on that role for making the film version of Spalding Gray's life.  Although there are intimations about his suicide, Soderberg never tells you at the end of the movie that Gray killed himself at age 62 by jumping off the Staten Island Ferry in the winter. There were other suicides in his family, most notably his mother's, a subject Gray handled in his film MONSTER IN THE BOX. He had threatened to commit suicide before he did it.  The primary motivating force for the suicide was that he had been in a car collision while visiting Ireland which had turned him into a cripple and left him with a lot of pain.  He could walk with leg braces but it was probably never going to improve beyond that. Although many people could handle this, Gray had always been melancholic and this life circumstance pushed him over the edge.

But he left a wonderful legacy of films based on his performances onstage of monologues, which everyone should see. They are wonderfully comic and incredibly true to the foibles of living a full life. You see many of these performances in this film plus get him in other footage and interviews which were never present in the films.

Another thing that is covered here is his personal life in great detail.  It was very messy and I am inclined to believe that led as much into his suicide as his physical injury.  His long time partner, Renee, also his producer, split with him because he had an affair with another woman and that other woman became pregnant.  He wanted the other woman to have an abortion but she wouldn't and shortly thereafter Gray found himself with a family. In the film you see him living family life and he does not look cut out for it at all. I think Renee kept him glued together most of the time and it was not an easy task. So making him the responsible person, a husband and father, was an unmitigated disaster which the car collision topped off for the remainder of his emotional state.  He had both women in therapy for a long time with him and he sounded a bit like Woody Allen with a very long term therapy situation which everyone involved with him also getting pulled into it. You get this in bits and pieces in the film till you put it all together by the end.

Now I want to go back and see his other films again.

5100096,5,B007N5YJRK,"He is one of the greatest raconteurs in American history.

The late Spalding Gray. The WASP from Rhode Island, the actor who had parts in the films ""The Killing Fields"", ""Beaches"", ""Kate & Leopold"" and TV series such as ""The Nanny"" and ""Saturday Night Live"", was known for his acting and written work in autobiographical monologue.

From his experience filming in Southeast Asia, he wrote ""Swimming to Cambodia"" in 1985 which received its film adaptation in 1987. The monologue would earn Gray a Guggenheim Fellowship and the National Book Award in 1985.

Spalding Gray would continue to gain prominence from his monologue work and his first and only novel ""Impossible Vacation"", Gray was seen as the ultimate storyteller, possibly one of America's greatest raconteurs. A man with an amazing gift of writing and performing with humor and openness. But also a man who battled with hereditary depression.

His mother committed suicide, his father dying before the birth of his first son, the birth of a son that he didn't want and wanted aborted, but found out how much he would love his child.  A man who enjoyed talking about life but not living it, Spalding Gray was a complex individual.

Remembered best for his monologue work, back in 1993, Spalding would work with young filmmaker at the time, Steven Soderbergh ( ""Sex, Lies and Videotape"", ""Kafka"", ""King of the Hill"" and ""Underneath"") in the film ""King of the Hill"".

Soderbergh who enjoyed Spalding's novel ""Impossible Vacation"" would later collaborate with Spalding Gray in bringing his 1993 monologue ""Gray's Anatomy"" to the big screen, and so together along with co-writer Renee Shafransky, the film adaptation of ""Gray's Anatomy"" was released in theaters in 1997. The film would also be a personal cinematic purge for Soderbergh who wanted to rejuvenate himself after directing four feature films and by working with people that he collaborated with in his short films.

With a small budget and eight days to film, ""Gray's Anatomy"" would give him the time to create a film that Soderbergh had wanted and most importantly, work with Spalding Gray.

But life for Spalding Gray would take its turn in 2001. While vacationing in Ireland, Gray would suffer severe injuries in a car accident. Injuries to his body and to his brain and the bout with depression was too much for him to take.

For Steven Soderbergh, the filmmaker had said that after hearing the injuries that Spalding Gray had suffered, instead of reaching out to him, he decided that it was best to keep his distance.

In 2004, after watching Tim Burton's ""Big Fish"", according to Gray's widow, Kathie Russo, ""You know, Spalding cried after he saw that movie. I just think it gave him permission. I think it gave him permission to die.""

Spalding Gray went missing and his body was found several months later in the East River.  Spalding Gray, like his mother, committed suicide.

Kathie Russo had wanted a documentary to celebrate the life of Spalding Gray and she turned to Steven Soderbergh.  Soderbergh who had felt guilty that he had not contacted Spalding wanted to make things right and that is by collaborating with his family, together with his editor Susan Littenberg, going through hours of footage, may it be interviews, family footage and one-man shows throughout his career, creating a documentary to honor Spalding Gray's life.  But also giving a chance for people to see Spalding Gray in a way that they have never seen him before.

Instead of having someone narrate the story of Spalding Gray, ""And Everything is Going Fine"" is essentially a film in which Spalding Gray does all the talking about his life throughout this footage, from his younger years up to the challenges he was facing after his accident.

We learn about his relationship with mother and father, how he found out his mother had died, his travels to India, his sexual experiences, the women in his life, his marriage, children and the accident that he was unable to recover from.  Spalding Gray talks about the life he lived but how he enjoyed talking about life but not necessarily living it.

With this release of the documentary in 2010, many familiar with Spalding Gray's work have called ""And Everything is Going Fine"" as a posthumous monologue and fitting final monologue for Spalding Gray.  There is no mention of his death or how he died, Steven Soderbergh created a documentary to celebrate Spalding Gray's life and to remember him for what he contributed to this world when he was alive.

VIDEO:

""And Everything is Going Fine"" is a documentary presented in 1080p High Definition (1:33:1 aspect ratio) and a film that utilizes various film sources.  May it be taped interviews from his one-man shows, television interviews, personal family videos.  So, video quality varies as it focuses on Spalding Gray throughout his career.

There is no doubt that Steven Soderbergh did a lot of research in making sure which footage would be used in the film.  Together with his editor Susan Littenberg, the two manage to craft a film that is well-paced and utilizing the best footage for this film.  So, I'm not going to be picky over the video quality of this documentary.

According to the Criterion Collection, the film was assembled from archival interviews with and performances by Spalding Gray, material primarily in the form of NTSC videotape.  Still photographs were also used as well as home movies over the closing credits.  No new material was photographed.

All the original NTSC videotapes were digitized 1:1 as Avid MXF Media at 720 x 486 resolution.  These files were then upconverted to 2K DPX files (1920 x 1440 inside of 2048 x 1556) in Scratch, using Lanczos scaling to increase sharpness with a minimum of artifacts.  The film was then color corrected in Scratch, with noise reduction later applied as necessary, creating the final color-timed DPX files.  Throughout all of these steps, the original frame rate of 29.97 and the original 1:33:1 aspect ratio were maintained.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Gray's Anatomy"" is presented in English DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1. Dialogue is clear from Spalding Gray to the other people featured throughout the film. I heard no audio problems during my viewing of the film.

According to the Criterion Collection, the original theatrical audio mix was updated by re-recording mixer Larry Blake from the 1997 stems, the primary change being the upmixing of the music to 5.1 surround.

Subtitles are in English SDH.

JUDGMENT CALL:

Spalding Gray was one of America's greatest storytellers.  Best remembered for his monologue's, for those who knew Gray personally, were aware of his family tragedy, his depression and his talent.

But it's the positive long lasting memory that people remember of Spalding.  What he contributed to American literature to entertaining those who were willing to listen to him talk about life.  No matter if the topic was sad or exciting, he presented his story to an audience with passion.

And what Steven Soderbergh gives to the viewer is no-narrative but giving Spalding Gray a chance to tell people about his life posthumously through his words from various footage.  May it be through TV interviews, footage from his one-man show or even personal home videos, ""And Everything is Going Fine"" might as well be the final and fitting monologue by Spalding Gray.  There is not many people who can talk about their life, the happy moments to the most embarrassing moments to the most tragic of moments with such precision.  He doesn't break down, he doesn't stutter or miss a beat.  He's a pure professional that can share his life to the audience and everyone in the room may be captivated by his compelling stories.

But while many see Gray's works as larger than life, Gray is a man who is not perfect.  He has faced depression and took medication for it, he has relationship issues, sexuality issues, there are things that have happened throughout his life and Steven Soderbergh's documentary wisely features footage from various shows and interviews to give viewers an honest look of the man, no bullshit but giving us the real deal.  And he also interacts and interviews members of the audience, which is fascinating.

As for the Blu-ray release, ""And Everything is Going Fine comes with a making of featurette which is quite intriguing as we get to hear from Soderbergh and his editor Susan Littenberg, but also hearing from Spalding's widow Kathleen Russo.  From the making of the documentary to the challenges that existed, it was rather interesting to watch, especially if you are a filmmaker and want to hear about Soderbergh's approach to the source material used for the film.

And similar to the release of ""Gray's Anatomy"" on Blu-ray and DVD, ""And Everything is Going Fine"" also features a monologue.  In this case, his first monologue ""Sex and Death to the Age 14 which is over an hour long.

Overall, I'm very appreciative to the Criterion Collection for giving Spalding Gray a spot in their collection.  Granted, ""Gray's Anatomy"" and ""And Everything is Going Fine"" is directed by Steven Soderbergh, but what I enjoyed about these two films was that it was less about Soderbergh and more about Spalding Gray.  Gray in his own words, Gray in his own personal style of communicating with the audience.  May it be in the film or posthumously through archival footage.

While Spalding Gray was working on a monologue before his death and a book on the unfinished monologue has been published ""And Everything is Going Fine"" goes one step farther by bringing us one final monologue featuring Spalding Gray!  And for those who are passionate about Gray's work, you can expect this documentary to be well-researched (when it comes to picking the right scenes from hours upon hours of footage), well-planned, well-edited and also entertaining and fantastic! Spalding Gray fans will definitely not want to miss the release of ""And Everything is Going Fine"".

5100097,5,B007N5YJRK,"Very interesting and important for better understanding Spaulding Gray's evolution, body of work, and suicide.
The technique of splicing together segments from the same monologue, but from very different points in his career, was unusual and touching.",1349049600,3,251,5.8108108108108105
5100098,5,B007N5YJRK,"Spalding Gray is a unique spirit who came alive during his ""monologs"" on stage and in public, and revealed his inner thought-world to us with sometimes brutal honesty.  It is so appropriate and right that Steven Soderbergh made the editorial choice to allow Spalding to tell his own story, for it is all there in the filmed record of performances and interviews.  Such a wonderful tribute from a man who shares so much with us, and such a powerful reminder of the void all who appreciate him feel with his absence.  Long live Spalding Gray!
Criterion (as always! I love that company!) present us with a superb Blu-Ray, with a thorough range of supplementals, including an entire monolog previously unavailable, ""Sex and Death to the Age 14"".  Highly recommended.",1347408000,7,762,4.883720930232558
5100099,5,B007N5YJRK,"This is a great doucumentary about the late great Spalding Gray, who sadly committed suicide in 2004.
Directed by Steven Soderbourgh, this 89 min doc is comprised totally of vintage Gray clips, he talks about many subjects, including his mother's own suicide.
The 1.33 fullscreen image is has varying PQ quailties, some good, some not as good, which is of course is due to the source material.
It was quite sad to see the later clips from after his tragic car accident.
I won't say too much more, this is a must see for fans of the late Spalding Gray.
Also included is a brief making of doc. comprised of interviews of the filmakers.
But the best extra is a 1982 videotaped performance of Gray's first monologue titled ""Sex and Death to the Age of 14"", a treat for fans!
This great package from Criterion also includes a detailed booklet with an essay and photos.

8519669,4,B007N5YJRK,"This film is not a conventional monologue, scripted by Gray from start to finish as his other ones were.  It was assembled after his death from disparate material, including part of a monologue he was working on, along with clips from previous monologues, interviews, appearances, and scenes from his life.  It doesn't really stand on its own and I wouldn't recommend it as an introduction to his work; it's more a chance for those of us who found meaning and value in Gray's art to have a few final moments with him.  There's one astonishing moment where Gray recalls meeting an Irish nurse after his accident, who reveals that she's not all that keen on the Catholic Church.  He asks if this won't be a problem, if she doesn't have a priest administer Last Rites, and the nurse replies that she isn't worried, ""because the only sin is hurting other people, and I haven't done that.""  And Gray realizes that she hasn't.  Unfortunately, there are too few of these moments, most of them ones we've seen before from earlier monologues.

The disk includes an early monologue, ""Sex and Death to the Age 14,"" from 1982.  His signature style is there - sitting at a desk, reading from his notes, and jumping from one scene in his life to another while still somehow maintaining a common them and expressing the insight and vulnerability he would become known for.  It's by no means his best work, but it's fascinating to see how his artistic vision remained intact through his life as he refined and developed it.",1468886400,,1507,4.678030303030303
8519670,4,B007N5YJRK,"This is a retrospective of Spalding Gray's life, told mostly by himself, and mostly during his monologues.  For those who know and like Spalding Gray, you will enjoy this (although, not as much as one of his own monologues).  If you don't know Spalding Gray, then get ""Swimming to Cambodia"" or ""Gray's Anatomy"" and enjoy those first.  If you like them (and most people do), then you will appreciate ""And Everything Is Going Fine.""  However, I do not recommend this as a starting point for someone who does not know who Gray is.

If you know Spalding Gray, then you realize there will be no nudity or sexual scenes; but he will talk very graphically about sexual topics and he will pepper his speech with both obscenities and profanities.  He does not go overboard, like a ""blue comedian"" for instance, but it will be there.

Adult themes will include homosexuality and suicide.  I would suggest only 18 and older.",1467417600,,913,4.69811320754717
