1564734,5,B00005JO9X,"""Chicago Hope"" and ""ER""  were contemporaneous television medical dramas. The fact that ""ER"" was more commercially successful despite its palpably inferior quailities on every level, explains why it is currently possible to buy DVD performances of ""ER"" but not of ""Chicago Hope"".  Hopefully, this will not long endure.

The casting and, perforce, the acting performances on ""Chicago Hope"" were among the finest in TV history.  Adam Arkin is often praised, and he was very good.  But there were at least three better.  Mandy Patinkin was a breed apart, and Peter Nichol and Hector Elizando were not far behind.

A few of the ""Chicago Hope"" episodes even rose to a somewhat poetic level, but all were interesting, captivating, and anything but conventional fare.

This is television at its finest!",1128297600,24,794,5.1484375
1564735,5,B00005JO9X,"Chicago Hope is the most moving and dedicated series about modern medicine. It is exciting, deeply moving and shows Doctors who truly care about their patients and the lengths they will go to save lives. The show also gives us precious insight into these Doctor's lives not only as heros saving patients lives, with a touching emphasis on the unique and fascinating individuals these surgeons are. That beyond the perfectionsitic driven personalities are a tremendously compassionate souls who want to serve others. A spectacular series that will leave you much more open and trusting view to the men and women who save lives every day. This series has made me cry, laugh and made me think alot about life. An absolutely spectacular series with Dr. Jeffrey Geiger and Dr. Aron Schutt as two of my favorites. Enjoy.",1122681600,9,814,4.9489051094890515

1564838,5,B00005JO9X,"I spent most of the 1990's raising my young children by day, and falling asleep in the livingroom by night. (""I was watching that !""...unfortunately, no, I wasn't.) Now that my life belongs to me again I have discovered the JEWEL known as ""Chicago Hope"" and I watch it each night on a retro TV channel. I was hooked on the first episode by this incredible ensemble of actors, breathing life into the excellently written scripts; needless to say, the directing was also marvelous  -- all in all, a rich package. While I regret that I missed it the first time around, I'm happy to have discovered it now...and join the unhappy throng of people wanting to purchase the entire season on DVD. So, I must say: ""What's the hold-up? What if I 'code' before it hits the retail market ?""  Those ""extreme measures"" can be pretty pricy, keeping the old cardio going, but I'll make it clear on my ""advanced directive"" : I ain't kickin' the bucket without the full season DVDs clutched in my cold, dead hands. Just THINK of the implicatins this will have on Health Care costs ! (All right, that might have been a little dramatic...perhaps I watch too many ""doctor"" shows...but, I think you get my point.) How about if I just say, ""Please?""",1296172800,3,1225,4.5636363636363635

At the end of season 5 most of the regulars - except for Aaron, Phillip and Jack -were fired. That was it for the show. They brought in a bunch of new people for season 6 (seriously stupid move) which was pretty bad and so season 6 was the final season. You can get all 6 seasons on [...].

1564843,5,B00005JO9X,"It's true, this is an excellent show.  The writing is far superior to ER.  It was one of the most unique medical shows to ever grace the airwaves.  What I don't understand is, why not take advantage of Mark Harmon's success on NCIS and release Chicago Hope on DVD?  All anyone needs to do is look at the comments on YouTube that accompany some of the Chicago Hope clips that are posted there.  People love the fact that Harmon, as well as several other NCIS characters were also on Chicago Hope.  It would sell like hotcakes, not just to the slews of former fans, but to the millions of NCIS fans as well!",1247097600,,605,4.3097345132743365
1564844,5,B00005JO9X,I watched a few episodes when Chicago Hope first came out.  Got caught up in other things and didn't follow the show closely.  Recently discovered Season 1 and 2 on [...] and have been staying up waaaay too late watching episode after episode while doing cross stitch at my dining room table.  Have lost count of how many times I've accidently stuck my fingers with the needle as I've been paying more attention to the show than my stitching.  I have two more episodes to watch on season 2.  Guess I'll have to watch season 2 again.,1232150400,,532,4.443298969072165
1564845,5,B00005JO9X,"Chicago Hope was always preferable to ER in my eyes, and I agree that the two series nicely complement each other. The Hope characters were well delineated, the acting superb, and the story lines almost always interesting. Besides, I'm a Mandy Patinkin fan (I regret his having left Criminal Minds). Although his role as surgeon doesn't earn quite the contempt that Dr. Romano was accorded in ER, Patinkin played a complex and galvanizing role. Also interesting was the role of Adam Arkin, Patinkin's regular foil. Christine Lahti also brought a lot of depth to the show. Finally, Hector Elizondo also deserves re-viewing on DVD. Again, not hateful like Dr. Weaver on ER, but a fine, steady actor nonetheless. Let's bring these characters back. They're worth it.",1228608000,2,762,5.055555555555555

1564847,5,B00005JO9X,"Mandy Patinkins is a very underrated actor: I would love to see him in this show! To see a master like E.G. Marshall in quality television towards the end of his working career would also be truly amazing. Hector Elizondo is always underrated, and I always thought that Adam Arkin was George Clooney... They look the same. I thought Clooney was on Chicago Hope and that was what made him famous. I do think ER is probably one of the finest TV shows ever, so would be curious to see how Hope pans out if it ever comes out. I haven't seen St. Elsewhere yet, and am hesitant to buy the first season the only reason being that if I like it, I would be annoyed if they don't release the following seasons.",1223164800,,700,4.2706766917293235

Still have one episode on tape that i taped. It was one where people started dying in the hospital and they couldn't figure out why. Gieger is having lady problems, and the lady is having patient dying problems, and The health Marshal wants to shut the place down, and everybody is at each others throats, all the while Gieger plays with his train set in an effort to avoid being there for his new girlfriend because he feels he's betraying his ex who left him.

I especially liked Adam Arkin and Mandy Panikin. I thought Mandy was a girl for a long time till I realized he was one of the male doctors. He was very good in the series- very temperamental and unpredictable. Roxanne (can't remember her last name) was also good playing Adam Arkins wife on the show. I didn't like Christine Lahti when she came on the show. I think she replaced Roxanne ? but wasn't nearly as good as Roxanne. Anyway, its time this wonderful TV series came to DVD when so many other not as good programs have been released on DVD. I hope you release Chicago Hope on DVD very soon.

I am currently hooked on watching Chicago Hope in the Seattle area which airs on the Discovery Channel at 2&5a.m. I didn't watch it when it was on primetime so I don't know where it is in the series of it's run. This is what's going on right now so if anyone knows what year I am into watching it I'd appreciate it. A month ago or so Dr. Katara(sp?)came to the hospital as Head of Neurosurgery when the other doctor had a stroke and is interning in psych., Mark Harmon went to Vegas for a medical convention and had a gambling meltdown, the head of the hospital's son died in the ER.

I think the first season was a great show -- better than ER ever dreamed of being. I also think the show jumped the shark after the first season when they got rid of Peter McNichol (who ran off to head Ally McBeal's law firm), Mandy Patinkin quit the show and they wrote Kim Griest out of the script.

I would buy a DVD collection of the first season of Chicago Hope in an instant, but I wouldn't want seasons 2-6 if I was given them for free.",1160179200,17,556,4.045454545454546

1564985,5,B00005JO9X,"I am an audience from Hong Kong. Overheard that CBS will put their archives online next month and so I am surfing everywhere about CH and found here.

It was about 10 years ago CH broadcasted in Hong Kong but sadlessly it was completely defeated by ER. Nevertheless CH is just too amazingly stunning, it is almost perfect! The stories of doctors and patients; the affections between patients, their relatives and doctors; the darkness and the brightness of human....all are just prefectly written and casted!

Years after I still remember some scenes of CH, the episode that CH wants to advertise and make an ad resembling the opening of ER was just too funny and full of humour; the episode that tribute to Hitchcock was funny too! The night that Alan was shotted down; and also an episode that a brain surgeon having some kind of obsessive-compulsive disorder finally gained the trust of the patient for the operation...

While compare with ER, I think ER is rather a little bit shallow, it's name told it all, ""emergency"", rush, rapid-paced, hurry, critical situtations....

In short, IMHO CH defeated ER on the humanity aspect in both quality and quantity. Been watching yet another hospital-scenario drama ""Grey's Anatomy"", but neither ER nor ""grey's"" are as attractive as CH, and not even come close.

I am definately longing for the CH DVD, it is yet the best foreign drama (well, to me, it's ""foreign"") I have ever watched.",1155600000,8,1431,4.848360655737705

I didn't like the little lawyer guy at first, but when he was killed, I cried for days. I have nothing bad to say about any of the episodes even at the last, every one of them had something to offer the audience, laughter-sadness-amazement-anger, it was all there.

1565071,5,B00005JO9X,"Is that why none of his shows are on DVD in America?  Exactly what is keeping his stuff from being released?  I'd quickly snatch up season 1 of ""Chicago Hope"" and the first 2-3 seasons of ""Picket Fences"" if they came out.

Regarding ""Chicago Hope"" vs ""ER""...to me, if anything, they're complements to each other.  ""Chicago Hope"" is quirky, methodical and character-driven.  ""ER"" is grounded, fast-paced, intense and plot-driven.  I've always preferred ""ER"", especially because I felt it was better and more satisfying for far longer(""Hope"" lost its appeal around season 3), but also because of the cast.  While ""Hope"" featured better actors, the group on ""ER"" just came off as more likable and easier to get attached to.  ""Hope"" also added and lost too many actors in its first couple seasons while ""ER"" lost just one core character in its first 4+ seasons.

With that said, the first season and a half of ""Chicago Hope"" is a revelation, with its wildly eccentric group of characters, often crazy plots and its ability to really tug at your heartstrings without being too corny or over-the-top.  Not only is this a great cast in terms of individual performers, but they all work extremely well together.  For the kind of material David E. Kelley is famous/infamous for, you need a group that can smoothly interact with each other and make the insanity seem natural.  This wonderful ensemble gets the job done...nothing ever seems forced and you get the sense that these people feel genuinely comfortable in what is a surreal atmosphere.

Special mention goes out to Mandy Patinkin and his character ""Jeffrey Geiger"", one of the best performances and characters in tv history.  Patinkin is always brilliant, managing to find the right note every time as a certifiable genius.  Even when the charcter can be a total a**, Patinkin's skill and charm keep you from disliking him.

This is a great show that deserves to be on DVD.  Will David E. Kelley please stop rolling around in his gigantic pile of $100 bills and get this and ""Picket Fences"" on DVD already!",1149811200,35,2057,4.848137535816619

The emphasis was on the word ""drama."" Jeffery Geiger's wife in the psycho ward at the end of the pilot; Arron's racing medical cart in the hallway; the memorable quareteen episode where everybody was locked up in the supply room.

It is like the scenes felt so real I thought they were real at times. E.R does well to show the emotions of the doctors but Chicago hope was on a leauge of its own when it came to this aspect of the show.

7941690,5,B00005JO9X,"I just have to say that nothing will even top Chicago Hope. This is the most heart felt medical drama that has ever hit television. ER was good up until they played off George Clooney but still it was not a very heart felt drama and does not interact with the characters lives nearly enough like Chicago Hope. I honestly have to say that the cast on Chicago Hope is the best I have ever seen. I don't know why they have not released the episodes on DVD but I have been watching episodes on ALN Primetime and recording them on DVD. The only problem is that I only have most of Season 3, all of Season 4, and now working on Season 5, and when it the episodes start for Season 6 I will record those as well, but I am still missing Seasons 1 & 2. I don't know if ALN is going to rerun these or not after they finish with Season 6 but I sure do hope so because I would hate to not have those in my collection.
