8738012,5,B0172LXHW2,"Does Fat Possum mean anything to you? Are you a fan of John Lee Hooker or Fred McDowell? Did you get onboard with the North Mississippi Allstars? If you said yes to any of the above , this lesson provides the keys to the kingdom.  The blues from the hill country of north Ms are noted for their hypnotic grooves, grooves that are said to be directly influenced by African rhythms. Long after the folk and blues revivals,  RL Burnside, Jr Kimbrough, Jesse Mae Hemphill and Ranie Burnette were playing in joints and parties in the area.  The Fat Possum label began to record their work in the early 90s and the No Ms Allstars put their music in a rock contest. Tom Feldmann carefully breaks down essential songs from their repertoire and performs them with soul (their no footage of the original artists but their recordings are provided). The only caveat--Tom doesnt 'speak' music, so it lacks a little on the technical side, but he gets the groove across, and that's what you came for. This lesson works both for acoustic and electric players.",1469923200,,1043,4.627027027027027
