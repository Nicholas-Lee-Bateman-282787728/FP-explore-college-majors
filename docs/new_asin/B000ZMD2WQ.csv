Despite that, my daughter enjoyed it. Particularly the Casper/Gasperin cartoon. The Spanish is on point and that's a big part of what I'm looking for. Worked for us, but it's not for everyone.",1354406400,,359,4.625
8235967,5,B000ZMD2WQ,"There is only a few casper cartoons and a bunch of other cartoons that aren't casper cartoons. That is why they entitled it and friends, because there are other toon episodes not because they are all felix episodes with his friends in them. Which is what i thought. Be aware of what u are buying. Its deceiving but over all it is in spanish and the reason why I bought it.",1239580800,,372,4.253521126760563
