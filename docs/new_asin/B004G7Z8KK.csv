5932112,5,B004G7Z8KK,"This is a fantastic HD DVD set.  The footage has clarity, brilliant color and it is apparent that it was professionally filmed.  The first DVD is an hour of different parts of the reef which shows various coral and sea life.  This can be played with ambient music or the sound of ocean waves.  It is very realistic and makes you feel as if you were sitting in the ocean just watching the creatures swim around you.
The second DVD has six different scenes of sections of the reef and you can play just one or loop all of them for uninterrupted infinite viewing.  Each scene can be played with your choice of ambient music, waves or piano music for a totally relaxing experience.  This is great for meditation or as background on your television or computer screen while you are reading.",1434585600,7,785,4.492957746478873
5932113,5,B004G7Z8KK,"This DVD set has really impressed me. Disc 1: Here you can immerse yourself 60 minutes in the world of ocean. You can enjoy the variety of ocean, watch how colorful fish swim around, you can also watch corals with fantastic colors or entire shoal swim around. The DVD is very diverse, the camera often shifts to a new reef and presents new views. Here you can choose between ambient music and wave sound. In disc 2 you can choose between six different tracks of reefs and you can choose the background noise. Here the options are ambient music, waves or piano. There you can see fish in different gorgeous colors and corals with their beautiful colors, which are fantastic to look at, too. With this DVD set you can bring the fascinating underwater world into your home.",1429488000,3,770,4.586956521739131

8607765,1,B004G7Z8KK,I cannot use this product and would not recommend it. I purchased it to provide a relaxing atmosphere in my waiting room for clients to relax. Neither the audio nor the video is relaxing.  The fish are computer generated and actually kind of creepy.  Thisis not at all a natural underwater scene nor is it relaxing.,1501113600,,315,4.607142857142857

8607771,5,B004G7Z8KK,"This 2-disc DVD set provides an excellent view of beautiful ocean reefs off the Philippines.  You have your pick of ambient music or relaxing ocean waves to enhance the visual experience.

Disc one provides 60 minutes of ever-changing underwater scenery.  It includes incredible corals, night oceans, a sea turtle bathed in light and surrounded by a school of fish, even whale sharks.  The variety of plant life and fish are outstanding.  Watching this DVD made me feel like I was scuba diving!

Disc two contains six ocean reef aquariums.  There are a variety of backdrops, all with wonderful corals and a parade of beautiful fish.  This DVD was completely relaxing and is perfect for reading a book or if you just want something peaceful in the background.

Tony and his crew have again provided us with an exceptional DVD set portraying ocean life.  The colors are eye-popping and the underwater scenes are simply amazing.  If you enjoy underwater ocean photography, this is a set you won't want to miss!",1465257600,,1007,4.899408284023669
