7861479,5,630411107X,"Why do I say this?  Sela, a half human/half Romulan, was the silhouette seen in ""The Mind's Eye"".  She's the alternate Tasha Yar's daughter from ""Yesterday's Enterprise"", and of course ""Sins of the Father"" and ""Reunion"" are referring to Worf's discommendation and the death of Duras at Worf's hand.

Plot:  Gowron is now officially the Chancellor of the Klingon Empire, but he'll have to deal with powerful Duras sisters (and their secret Romulan allies) first in order to truly have the power with the title.  Worf has resigned Starfleet and has joined Gowron to battle the Duras.  Meanwhile, the Federation, while officially not going to lend support to what is considered a ""purely, Klingon, internal affair"", they are going to try to expose the Romulans by using a tachyon net (which can detect even cloaked ships) with 20 some starships on the Klingon/Romulan boarder....

Great conclusion.  I can see how it would have driven everyone crazy seeing Sela in Part 1 (who is played by Denise Crosby) and everyone saying, ""I-thought-Tasha-Yar-died-so-why-is-she-alive-and-why-is-she-a-Romulan?""  Great points in how they defeat the Romulans, that Data gets to command a Nebula-class cruiser, etc.

7861480,2,630411107X,"The writers of Star Trek TNG cleverly find a way to bring back Lt. Yar (well, her daughter anyways) and  then totally misuse the potential.  As with many of the season finales, this one is a good story yet nothing really great.  Even the ""Borg taking Picard"" season finale was made into a disappointment,with everything wrapped up neatly at the conclusion of the second part of the episode so that the series goes on as always.  The writers of this series certainly didn't ""Boldly Go"" anywhere in the majority of this show's run.
My suggestion-  don't buy this- it's probably on today anyways on the reruns.  Save your money instead and use it on one of the Lord of the Rings dvd's.",1074470400,,682,4.549180327868853

Worf does some very uncharacteristic things in this one.  He is not his boisterous self here.  His brother Kurn helps him restore his family name from the Duras family.  This one has an appearance from Denise Crosby as Sela.  The explanation as to how she came in the current timeline stretch the lines of credibility at best.  Of the two parts this one is best.  The Klingon star ship battles in this one are worth the price of the cassette.  The final standoff between Worf and the young Klingon to take over the Empire are the best in the series.  I wish there were more episodes costarring his brother Kurn.  He is the opposite of Worf.  He is not as near as conscientious as his brother.",991612800,,710,4.434108527131783

Picard, meanwhile, pursuades Star Fleet to help in  the Civil war indirectly. Picard takes charge of a fleet of ships, and sets  of blockcade at the Klingon-Romulan border, with tachyon beams suspended  between each of the starships, and puts Data and Riker each in command of a  starship, If a cloaked ship passes through the tachyon's, that ship will  show up on sensors. As the Captain orders the fleet to move away, Data  saves the day, by disobeying a direct order, and fires energy beams,  uncovering Romulan Warbirds entering klingon space.
Once discovered, the  Romomulans retreat back to their space, deserting the Duross sisters. Once  the sisters find they are abandoned they escape, and Worf helps Chancellor  Gawron stay in power. Worf returns to duty on the Enterprise.",962236800,11,952,4.930817610062893
