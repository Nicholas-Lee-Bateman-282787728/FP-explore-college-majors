You have a busty alien girl with a demon tail, as well as a gender swapping alien, and an assassin who could morph her body into weapons and other things.",1409875200,,275,4.3076923076923075

8385644,4,B0030BOCGO,"Well in this DVD set we get episodes 14-26 of the series. Now this set is only in Japanese audio and English subs which I really like my anime, so if you only like anime in English dub then this is not for you, I will also mention that this set contains some violence and mild nudity. now for the plot well it starts off with where the last episode left off where the main character thinks about what the father of his alien would be bride said to him and tries think of ways to be the number one man in the universe then so he starts training by running.  The episodes go in almost every direction after that I mean there is one about a ghost, one where they go to an underground hunting jungle, then they drill through the earth in search of hot springs, there is one episode where it focused on the main character's male friend, who none of the girls like for some reason I guess he is kind of a spaz, or ugly I can never tell unless its completely obvious, but I kind of like him and feel sorry for him at times.  There is an episode where there is this cat alien assassin,  one about the anime that they watch on the TV, then they try to run an inn for aliens.  All of these episodes leads up to the final three where the story comes to its conclusion.  For the most part the series is not that bad for a romantic comedy / harem anime, kind of reminds me of Tenchi without the main character being over-powerful.  I say give it a shot and enjoy the ride.",1339372800,,1459,4.066202090592334

I recommend this to anyone that is a hrem fan or just anyone that wants a good laugh.",1299369600,,259,3.814814814814815
8385646,4,B0030BOCGO,The manga was the best I've ever read of the ecchi/harem style.  The anime does this justice.  Only thing that would have been better would have for it to have been longer.,1285027200,,172,4.34375

8385649,5,B0030BOCGO,"In 2006, the series ""To Love Ru"" (which in Japanese ""Toraburu"" can be read as in English ""Trouble"") is a manga series by Saki Hasemi (""Moetan"", ""Pinky:st"") and Kentaro Yabuki (""Black Cat"", ""Yamato Gensouki"") was created and is currently featured in Weekly Shonen Jump. In the spring of 2008, Studio I.G. subsidiary Xebec, Inc. (known for working on ""Love Hina"" and ""Martian Successor Nadesico"") released a 26-episode anime series which was followed by video game releases for the Nintendo DS and Sony PSP.

The anime series has been released in the US courtesy of Sentai Filmworks in Dec. 2009 with a first collection which features the first 13 episodes and now a second volume with the final 13 episodes of the series.

""To Love RU"" is directed by Takao Kato (""Buson Renkin"", ""Compiler"", ""Rockman. EXE Beast"") and features a screenplay by Akatsuki Yamatoya (""Blue Dragon"", ""Digimon Frontier"", ""Inuyasha"", ""Fullmetal Alchemist""). Character designs are by Yuichi Ouka (who worked on ""Over Drive"", ""Gurren Lagann"", and ""R.O.D. - The TV-"") and music is by Tsuyoshi Watanabe (""This Ugly Yet Beautiful World"", ""Moetan"").

""To Love RU"" is about a teenager named Rito Yuki.  A teenage boy who has always loved his classmate Haruna Sairenji.  But somehow due to unusual circumstances, by trying to save a girl named Lala (who happens to be an alien princess) and now Lala believes that Rito is in love with her and because Rito has proposed to her in Deviluke tradition (grabbing the woman's breast and telling her that he loves her), they are now officially engaged.

Lala has made her residence at Rito's home and expects Rito to be her husband. But Rito is in love with Sairenji, not Lala...what is a powerless, teenage boy going to do?  Rito has been trying to find ways to have the marriage dissolved but finds himself getting deeper and deeper in trouble that even Lala's father, King Deviluke expects him to marry or else Earth will be destroyed.

Now Rito finds himself caring for both Haruna and Lala but what is this young teenager going to do?

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""To Love RU"" is presented in 16:9 Anamorphic Widescreen. For a television series, the series features a lot of colors and artistic backgrounds feature a good amount of backgrounds from school settings, shopping/city settings, Rito's home, etc. Typically for a TV series from a smaller studio, I don't expect to see so many backgrounds or an over utilization of artwork but XEBEC did a wonderful job in the animation and Yuichi Oka with the character designs. I don't know how close his designs are actually to Kentaro Yabuki and Saki Hasemi's original manga but overall, character design and art backgrounds are well done.

Audio is featured in Japanese 2.0 with English subtitles. Voice acting by the seiyuu are well done as Akeno Watanabe (Taruru of ""Sgt. Frog"", Jo of ""Burst Angel"", Chachamaru Kamakuri of ""Negima"") does the voice of Rito. Haruka Tomatsu (Mileina of ""Gundam 00', Misao of ""Asura Cryin' 2') does the voice of Lala and Sayuri Yahagi (Chisato of ""Sola"", Hanaka of ""Buso Renkin"") as Haruna. Anime is front channel driven but if you have a receiver that allows for stereo on all channels, that was my listening preference.

There is no English dub track in this DVD release of ""To Love RU"".

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""To Love RU- Collection 2' features the Clean Opening and Closing Animation themes and Sentai Filmworks trailers.

JUDGMENT CALL:

I have never heard of ""To Love RU"" before but after watching the first half of the series, I can tell you that I'm hooked. Each episode, I found myself laughing because of the crazy antics of the show.

In some ways, it is reminiscent of mangaka Rumiko Takahashi's ""Urusei Yatsura"" as a character ends up engaged to an alien. But in this case, Rito is nothing like Ataru (nor is he perverted). But ""To Love RU"" has its fair share of crazy antics, fan service and yes... nudity. Unlike Lum, Lala doesn't know how Rito feels inside, even though family and friends know that he's gotten himself into a mess.  Also, similar to another Rumiko Takahashi anime series (Ranma 1/2), the character of Ren/Run able to change genders is quite interesting and makes me wonder if series creator Kentaro Yabuki was paying homage to Takahashi's works.

But this second volume definitely amps up the hijinks, the craziness, fan service and the perverted humor of the series.  In the second half, the other characters are featured more and are integrated into the overall storyline.  So, in some ways the episodes are stand-alone but what fun these episodes are by its crazy episodes.  From Run trying to become a pop idol, or an alien wolf falling for Saruyama or both Rito and Saruyama at the hot springs.  Crazy, perverted episodes and contains quite a bit of nudity this time around.

As for the DVD release, I wished there were more special features than the clean opening and closing themes and I'm sure there are fans who wish there was an English dub included. But overall, ""To Love RU"" is a hilarious anime series that I just couldn't stop watching because each episode was very enjoyable. Each episode always had something odd and crazy that the characters are subjected to and for the most part, each episode is so crazy and so far out there, that you can't resist finding out what each episode has in store for them.

As mentioned, there are some similarities to ""Urusei Yatsura"" but instead of dragging it out to over a hundred episodes, the anime series does conclude in an interesting note that works well for this series.

Overall, If you are looking for a series with comedy, action and good amount of fan service, ""To Love RU"" is the anime series you definitely want to watch! Recommended!",1268179200,13,8311,4.642270861833105
