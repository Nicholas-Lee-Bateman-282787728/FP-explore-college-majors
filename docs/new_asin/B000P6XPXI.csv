2812861,4,B000P6XPXI,"POSSIBLE SPOILERS!! I first saw this movie on TV as a kid and I never forgot it. The ending haunted me. But I really enjoyed watching it again. Who knew Joan Collins could ACT? She brings a quiet determination and yet a fierceness to her part. And Richard Burton? I gotta say, it would be a tough choice as the movie shows. I understand that he did not want to do this movie but he still is Richard Burton and he graces anything he is in. Cy Grant, who died this year I believe, had a very distinguished career in Great Britain and was a well-loved figure, I understand. He brought dignity to his role. But of course, this being a movie of 40 yeas ago or so, you knew his fate right off. But it's kind of like the ""Red-Shirts' of Star Trek. Oh well. But all in all, a wonderful story about an impossible (?) romance. The DVD set I bought has some very nice (and unusual) extras. Well worth the small price I paid.",1288483200,8,913,4.163841807909605
2812862,4,B000P6XPXI,"SEA WIFE is an absorbing, energetic melodrama set during the thick of World War II.  Based on the novel ""Sea-Wyf and Biscuit"" by J.M. Scott, it follows four mismatched survivors after their boat is torpedoed by Japanese forces.

Cast adrift in a lifeboat are a young nun (Joan Collins), an RAF officer (Richard Burton), a stuffy old businessman (Basil Sydney), and the ship's purser (Cy Grant).  Giving each other nicknames, the group sets out to find land, but slowly ""Sea Wife"" and ""Biscuit"" start to develop an unlikely relationship.  Holding to her religious beliefs, ""Sea Wife"" keeps her real identity a secret from the rest of the survivors, despite the ardent pursuit of ""Biscuit"".

SEA WIFE reminds me a lot of ""Heaven Knows, Mr Allison"", a similarly-themed film from Fox which starred Deborah Kerr and Robert Mitchum.  Whatever the comparison, SEA WIFE stands on it's own as a thoroughly engaging romantic adventure; Collins and Burton are smashing in the leads.

The DVD includes restoration comparison, scene-specific audio commentary by Aubrey Solomon, image galleries, and the trailer.  (Single-sided, single-layer disc).

8189634,5,B000P6XPXI,"I enjoyed SEA WIFE , and I thought that the acting was excellent. I mean Joan Collins acting convincingly as a nun was amazing. Even she thought that it was a challenge. Richard  Burton still looked young and good looking while  turning in his usual great performance. It was an interesting story about four strangers pretty much caught on a lifeboat after their ship was sunk by a Japanese submarine .  It was a fight for survival !!",1501459200,,434,4.538461538461538

8189636,4,B000P6XPXI,"Review of Sea Wife
Hot Toasty Rag, July 21, 2017

To me, the second best part of this movie was the lack of imagination used in the story. It provided me with so much inspirationfor days afterwards, I kept coming up with ways the story could have been better, and that was quite fun! The best part, of course, was watching Richard Burton, scruffy, sweaty, and shipwrecked.

Sea Wife starts out as a mystery. Richard Burton, cleaned up and in a suit, takes out a newspaper advertisement, looking for Sea Wife and signing it Biscuit. The audience has no idea what hes talking about, but he continues to place personal ads, with no response. The movie goes back in time and becomes a shipwreck adventure! Four people are stranded in a lifeboat, each earning a nickname instead of sharing personal details. Richard Burton becomes Biscuit because he finds the food in the life raft, and Joan Collins become Sea Wife because she looks like a mermaid when she swims in the ocean.

Before the shipwreck, we see all four characters on the boat. Joan Collins is a nun, but her garments are torn off during the disaster, so Richard Burton is unaware of her calling when he meets her. Wouldnt it have been an infinitely better story if we didn't see her as a nun in the opening scene? Then, as the romance progresses, we wouldnt understand why shes exercising such willpower. There would be so much more tension if we didn't know her secret. Maybe the only way wed believe shed resist Richard Burton in a torn shirt is if we knew she was a nun.

Unless you really don't like shipwreck movies, Id recommend watching this romantic adventure. Theres plenty of eye candy, and parts of the story are really thrilling. Plus, itll keep you talking afterwards about how you could have written a better story!",1500595200,,1788,4.613207547169812
8189637,4,B000P6XPXI,A good old movie that has drama and inner turmoil.  Doesn't task the brain or keep you on the edge of your seat; just a nice movie from a different era.,1462579200,,152,3.903225806451613
8189638,5,B000P6XPXI,I saw this movie back in the early 80's. Always had a crush on Joan Collins. I really enjoyed watching it again. Had to add to my collection.,1459987200,,141,4.071428571428571

8189642,4,B000P6XPXI,"Richard Burton (as usual) is great in this film. Joan Collins is a surprise, in a good way. She really was believable as a nun and that's the kind of part I couldn't previously have imagined her playing. A long way from her usual sexy, sultry roles.

This is a sad story and at times far-fetched. Some parts re: race are offensive too. But given the time it is set in, that probably was the norm. Still worthwhile and rather a unique story too, if you usually enjoy movies made in the 50s. I'm also wondering if it might have been loosely based on a real story.

If you are a fan of Richard Burton and/or Joan Collins, you'll want to give this one a look.",1435795200,,655,4.190476190476191
8189643,4,B000P6XPXI,"I took a chance on this movie as I had never heard of it before. I enjoy Joan Collins and Richard Burton so here was one with both actors so I bought it. I was pleasantly surprised. The story was good, the performances were good and the movie was enjoyable. I enjoyed the characters and what they had to go through to stay alive and the under tone of the love story was good. You could feel Joan's character being tugged between Richard Burton and God himself.",1392940800,,460,4.2988505747126435
