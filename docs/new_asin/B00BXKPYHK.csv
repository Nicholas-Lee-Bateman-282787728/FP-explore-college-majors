5680615,3,B00BXKPYHK,"Anyone who's a horror fan knows that found footage films are tired.  Entity updates the genre by mixing in-character film with 3rd person in a way that feels natural and mostly adds to the tension and immersion of the film without telegraphing the use of found footage style to cover a meager budget.

As for the story itself, it's nothing new, though the actors are very good in their roles.",1370044800,2,392,4.585714285714285
5680616,4,B00BXKPYHK,"I was a bit skeptical to rent this but running out of horror films to watch and reading the other two reviews, I am glad I went ahead and clicked that green button.  I found the movie to be a real good little horror flick.  Not fast paced or full of dying young girls, but it felt like this could have really happened.  The location gave off that creepy feeling and was well selected.  I really liked the main character actors of Kate and Ruth.  They did a great job.  If you are looking for a good haunted movie, I recommend a look.",1369958400,7,533,4.12621359223301

I depend on reviews from others when deciding on my instant viewing purchases.  But, I have to say this wasn't a bad movie at all.  It wasn't exactly the greatest horror film I've ever seen; but the plot was good, the acting was decent, and it did give off a pretty creepy vibe.  I will say that it is not incredibly fast placed, it does take a bit to get to where it was going, but in the end it did draw me in.  I would say it's a decent ghost story and if you have an afternoon or evening to kill it wouldn't be a waste of time or money.",1368748800,9,649,3.8863636363636362
5680618,4,B00BXKPYHK,"This is ""Entity"" with the backwards ""N"" so not to be confused by other films with the same name. In this film there are no women sexually abused by a ghost. Don't blame me, I didn't write it.

This film takes place in remote Sadovich, Siberia, Russia. We get a glimpse of some 1983 footage of a gaunt nude man in a cell with odd things going on, including levitation. We quickly come to the present where a camera crew is going to the same area. They were contacted by Yuri (Branko Tomovic) who claims 34 people were found in a shallow grave in a remote glade. With the help of Ruth (Dervla Kirwan) a psychic, he hopes to find out what happened as the authorities will not say. A camera crew comes along. Kate (Charlotte Riley) is the reporter/director who reminded me of Sandra Bullock. Charlotte Riley is a rising star. Matt (Rupert Hill) is the camera man and David (Oliver Jackson) is the token guy who needs to grow a set. Someone has to be the first to die.

Ruth is the real deal. Eleven minutes into the film you have ghosts, no waiting. The full plot, i.e. the function of the building they explore for most of the movie, is explained half way through. The movie is a mixture of found footage and regular filming with the found footage aspect not being too bad except for a poorly shot night scene.

The feature starts to get numb as we see much of the same stuff, then when Kate reviews the film...BAM! A nice little twist and surprise ending that made the numb worth while. Definitely worth a view for found footage fans.

Led by a local, Yuri, as their guide, and Ruth, their psychic, the TV crew venture on their investigation into what happened to these unidentified persons...

I love horror, supernatural, etc. But good horror or anything in that vein is hard to find these days but for me, I don't need much. Just a few places I jump and hadn't expected *that*. Fangora tends to present some good fodder so I took a chance on Entity...and was shockingly surprised.

The premise is not new, nor original--video recording of scary events. However, all the annoying mistakes and silliness is mostly removed and we actually get a decently plotted story with solid performance and genuine fright moments. Not once did I wince or want to stop watching. There were also no plot holes or places I had to just 'go with it' because, as simple as the concept was, it wasn't left to chance. It was tight, focused, and all of it was solid.

Overall, the production was way better than I expected. The acting was also credible. The special effects...while limited, was utilized effectively, and more importantly, believable. Despite so much of it being filmed in the dark, the director remembered that the audience actually had to SEE what is going on to feel any sense of fear and tension. I appreciated an actual direction and storyline, as most horror/suspense/supernatural films just try to go for scare tactics.

If you overthink this movie, you won't enjoy it. Just let go of all your hangups and just sit back and be entertained. This is not a deep movie, nor is it trying to do something innovative. That's the point! Tried and true tricks is the name of the game in this genre but at least this movie attempted to be less predictable, and I appreciate that :D.

I definitely recommend at least one watch but honestly, I might watch it again to see if I missed something the first time around. Well worth a watch, for sure!",1523145600,,2030,4.659217877094972

I found the paranormal scenes mostly incomprehensible because it's made to look like your're watching through a handheld device that's just shaking around with a large amount of visual static,while the actor is flopping around and screaming. All that being said, this is easier to watch than most of the movies like these, that are made to look like you are watching something that was recorded on a handheld device; it seems like they put decent production into it to make it look more like a movie with soft color and lighting that I expect from a quality movie.

A camera crew and psychic go out in the woods, find an abandoned government facility that is haunted by the tortured spirits of test subjects who were imprisoned there.  Only the psychic limps away in the end, possessed by the most powerful evil ""entity""...The end.

Now, take that 10-second synopsis and mercilessly stretch it into an hour-and-a-half feature film with an ominous, rumbling soundtrack that sounds like an electric dynamo running in the basement (occasionally interrupted by a mournful Russian aria), a lot of shaky camera, a lot of gaping close-ups, but not much dialogue and definitely not many scares.  Just slow build-ups with no real reward.

5680673,3,B00BXKPYHK,"It's not what you find at the end, but the journey to get there, I suppose. The plot is very predictable, following what even I (who doesn't watch a lot of these movies) think of as the typical psychological/horror or thriller story line. Abandoned building in the woods where sinister events took place, and we follow the party into the darkness to understand what took place.

I found myself really enjoying Ruth Peacock's (Dervla Kirwan) role in the group, how she begins to uncover the truth of what took place and her deferential attitude toward the sufferers. She reveals our first spooky moments with flashbacks of what took place. Everything goes to pieces when she leads them further into the woods and they find the source of a powerful and malevolent psychic power.

The others that go with Ruth are sadly forgettable. The acting was decent, but I just didn't feel a lot of sympathy for them as Ruth's role evoked. They help the viewer through a series of spooks, jump scares, and lots of shaky camera moments; some were enjoyable and others not as much (so much shaky camera...). The longer the group stays in the place, the more they all seem to be able to catch glimpses of the the sufferers.

And then there is that ending...I do like the way the story closed, at the moment you realize why Kate sees the things that she sees. It wraps up the story nicely and sadly.",1520208000,3,1381,4.582995951417004

In general, if a movie has to be shot in the near-dark to be scary, it isn't all that scary to me.

5680678,1,B00BXKPYHK,"I really wonder who pays for all these false reviews.
A rating of 4.5 or above on IMBd is generally good for a decent (not big screen) hollywood movie these days.
This movie should not even have a 3.

Acting: Sub-par. I'm not expecting Oscar-worthy acting, but what started off as a semi-decent acting for a B movie quickly degrades into the sudden turn of heart Michael B. Jordan had at the end of Black Panther, out-of-place, terrible, and confusing.
You have Yuri(?) who starts getting emotional out of nowhere and loses all semblance of intelligence, the psychic who, after one interaction with the ghosts, acts as if she's high on the finest 420 in the country, and the main who's lines and logic were poorly though out (ex. ""I know what we have to do! *proceeds to do complete opposite*).

Horror/""Scary"" scenes: TERRIBLE. Since the whole influx of found footage began, we've slowly devolved from horror filled scenes intensified with camera shaking to ONLY camera shaking. Every scene in which there was supposed to be an interaction with a ghost was marred with SEVERE camera shaking to the point that you could have scene more from a video taken with your i-phone being wildly swung around in a dark bar. It's appalling that some of the most vital scenes were just screen shakes.
Cloverfield was notorious for too much screen shaking (I did like the movie, however). The specific scenes I talk about put Cloverfield to shame.

Plot: ??? Sorry, did I miss out on something? What's the plot?
Psychic and group of idiots go on a journey to a dark place, and they proceed to get picked off by a shaking camera.

Additional notes: Why were all the actors wide-mouthed at the second half of the movie? Wide eyes, open mouth, and no dialogue can best describe the majority of the acting.",1519689600,4,1789,4.687898089171974

5680686,2,B00BXKPYHK,"In Monty Python's ""Argument Sketch"", it was put forward that ""An argument isn't just contradiction ... An argument is a connected series of statements intended to establish a proposition.""  In much the same way, a good horror movie is not just ""bad things happened in the past, and scary things happen in the present""; it needs to establish a proposition about the universe being different from what we think or want it to be.  It doesn't have to fill in all the details, of course, but it will be more compelling, and more chilling, if it includes some coherent world-building that makes it seem plausible.

That's where this movie really fails.  One of the characters arguably deserved what happened to him, although even in his case there are mitigating circumstances.  There really is no moral to this story, then.  Nor is there an explanation of the real identity of the main antagonist, or why he is more powerful dead than alive.  It's like a haunted house that is all cobwebs, with no wood or stone.

Two more points are worth mentioning.  The movie clearly takes place in the present (it was made in 2012), and in its first few scenes it shows that the atrocities that set everything into motion took place in the late 1980's.  Several aspects of the movie make it seem, though, that a quarter century COULD NOT have passed between these two episodes.  Secondly, if dialogue is really essential to the plot, have it spoken, not inaudibly whispered.  Whispers do not make a movie more frightening, just more annoying.

I give this more than one star because it did establish some potential, but because it never really developed that potential, it only gets two stars.",1518825600,,1676,4.757785467128028

In any case, this movie avoids most of the pitfalls of other similar movies...  Virtually no shakey handcam syndrome...  Lighting was generally pretty reasonable ( a few scattered black scenes here and there ), acting was well above par for low budget paranormal flicks, set was cool, soundtrack was pretty well done, audio was reasonable, etc...

And, believe it or not, none of the characters acted like complete idiots in this flick...  shocker.  Yeah, they made a couple dumb mistakes, but none of the common ones seen in other horror flicks...

The movie uses very limited special effects ( which is why I'm guessing low budget ), but I don't think that that detracted from the movie...  What special effects they did use looked pretty good...

All in all, this was a pretty creepy / suspenseful paranormal horror flick out of England.  Is it ""really"" 4 star?  Maybe not...  Probably more like a 3 or 3.5, but considering how many movies in this genre are absolute garbage, I'm awarding a bonus point, since they actually did a pretty good job.

I also could see right away that the guy who was guiding them to that place wasn't telling them the truth, there's always a person like him in these types of movies.  The one thing that I did not like was the fact that there were too many dark scenes where it was very difficult to see much of anything. I realize that they were trying to make it fit into the story when bad things were happening, but when viewers have to continuously try manipulating the screen or move in closer in an attempt to see what is happening, it detracts from the movie itself. My other pet peeve which isn't limited to just this movie, but is meant as a criticism of most is this - sound. Producers need to stop the practice of having characters talk in very low voices and then to suddenly make some very loud noises or the other characters talk in a very loud voice which blows your ear drums out after having turned up the sound in order to hear what the character was saying. Why can't they just stop it with the low speaking voices, and have everyone use normal voices so one doesnt' have to keep adjusting the sound for each character, it's ridiculous!",1517788800,9,1404,4.2781954887218046

Great scary ghost movie and story and scary looking ghost and spirits & nice special effects and nice looking filming location spooky areas locations.

5680713,5,B00BXKPYHK,"I was in a crappy mood when I started watching this movie...yeah, yeah, I was saying to myself, paranormal investigation movies, the redheaded stepchildren to found footage. And then there was the part where we watch the attractive tv personality prep for the camera, then the psychic got spooked out on top of a mass grave, and after that we  went into a dilapidated building, and when the night vision camera came on and I thought I was going to shut the film down in disgust.
Boy I'm glad I didn't.
Because right at the top of act two Yuri (Branko Tomovic) comes into the spotlight with a bravura performance I'm soooo tempted to describe, but actually I think this is one film where you really should go in knowing just as little as possible.
I will reveal that the film does not try to set itself apart with gimmicks. That's why it felt so hackneyed at first. If you have a strong, original story to tell, you really don't need to worry about ""setting yourself apart"" from similar films. There's always room for excellence, and that's what this film delivers on all levels.",1411603200,3,1078,4.556701030927835

5680719,5,B00BXKPYHK,"If a person lets their grip on acceptable reality relax while watching, the supernatural experiences are so riveting and dramatic that one becomes quite unsettled and overtaken.  If one's mindset can accommodate the supernatural and its extreme of madness there is no locale for comfort.  The sounds and effects are disconcertingly penetrating.  It is difficult to imagine that the characters are able to maintain composure without some sort of emotional collapse.  Further, the dimension of paranormal dereliction and rage remained beyond the climax and conclusion of the movie leaving a viewer to ponder the prevalence of such cataclysmic tragedy if so enchantingly enthused.  Upon a second viewing, my spooked uneasiness escalated substantially.  Great entertainment on a stormy howling night at home.",1399852800,,804,5.603305785123967

As it is, we get a lot of familiar found footage work here, yet I admit I found it surprisingly enjoyable. Aside from an annoyingly similar looking pair of female leads which led to a bit of confusion, the acting was decent enough, the effects team was smart enough to keep most of it's work subtle (a lot of cuts to someone else hearing screams, sorry gorehounds not much in the way of kill shots here), and the simple plot developed logically enough.",1399507200,,552,4.368932038834951

5680725,2,B00BXKPYHK,"I watched the trailer for this movie and thought it looked good so I gave it a try. The story is not new, but the plot was different enough to peak my intrest. The setting in the remote Siberian region of Russia was creepy enough for a movie in this genre, but the exterior shots of the buildings didn't fit the part for a secret Russian human testing lab/prison facility. The interior of the building fit the parameters better although it did not appear as a facility used for researching humans, (observation rooms, labs, tiled walls etc.) but more of some type of industrial fabrication facility. The movie does possess an eerie and creepy feel from its remote location and the low light settings for the scenes. The acting was decent especially for this sub genre catagory with the minor exception of the lead reporter/investigater Kate (Riley) and her scream scenes that get a little annoying. The medium Ruth (Kirwan) does a convincing job with her role as the conduit between the living and the dead. Her job is to find what really happened to the people who were found in shallow graves a short distance from the buildings. The rest of the crew was a camera operater Matt (Hill) a sound tech David (Jackson) and a Russian Yuri (Tomovic) guide/interpreter who called the investigative crew in for the investigation. I found little in all of this footage (there is some shaky cam work, but not a lot) to raise my heart rate or to make me jump at anything that was on screen. I felt a little cheated by this movie for its lack of any really scary ""jump out of my seat"" scenes. The good acting and the errie/creepy aura was not enough to raise this movie above the crowd of this overused genre. The movie has a couple of twists, but they are neither surprising or shocking because of the predictability of the story and the clues given to the viewer. People have argued as to whether or not this is a found footage movie? In the movie we are never shown any found footage (there is a Russian clip at the begining of the movie thats not mentioned by the crew) evidence so in that respect I would say no, But how could their story be told since they're never heard from after arriving near the scene? So did someone find their equipment and show their findings or was all this just a figment of our imaginations? I'm going out on a limb here and saying that YES it is THEIR found footage!! There I said it. Its logical and it makes sense.

5680726,2,B00BXKPYHK,"I watched a short film on YouTube called the Russian Sleep Experiment some time ago, and it scared the *%&@ out of me!
So when I heard about this movie, I was excited because I thought it would be based on that same urban legend.
Sadly, it wasn't.  It was, I thought, boring.  For most of the movie, we just see the main characters wandering through the abandoned installation with one lame jump-scare after another.
And then, of course, (spoiler alert) no western-made film is complete until you turn the one Russian in the group into the bad guy.
I also had a problem with the sound quality.  I don't know if it was just my copy, but it was very hard to hear a lot of what they were saying.  I had to turn the volume on my TV all the way up.
I also thought the ending was confusing.  I don't recommend this movie.",1374796800,,815,4.198717948717949

There's barely a story here at all, but like good Brit horror it builds some creep factor.  Not fond of the shaky cam stuff - that's getting old.  The ending is good - well handled, a light touch.  But a sad one.",1370217600,,265,4.019230769230769
8575092,2,B00BXKPYHK,"The peculiar thing about this film is the above average acting in an otherwise uneventful movie.  The actor playing Yuri, in fact, won an award for his turn, and Kirwan's character wasn't the over-the-top annoying sort of psychic you so often see in these things. Entity might have made a great short film, if they condensed a lot of the aimless wandering through dark 'factory' sets with a lot of shaky cam, screaming, and barely-there visuals.  The acting and scraps of story make you *want* to like it, but there just isn't anything interesting to *look* at.  Worth a watch if you like them slow and understated, with minimal gore and visuals, but don't expect too much.",1530662400,,673,4.735042735042735

Skip ""Entity,"" a snoozefest starring Charlotte Riley (Tom Hardy's wife).  First 20 minutes were literally walking through the woods, with scattered exposition.  Next 35 minutes were talking while walking around with flashlights, while the psychic lies down to rest, with the occasional jump scare with no payoff.  At about an hour, things start happening, but its either characters standing agape, reacting to something offscreen, or camera work so shaky you cant delineate anything.  This movie would best be titled, Nonentity or Budget Limitations Preclude Showing an Actual Entity.",1526428800,2,775,5.355371900826446
