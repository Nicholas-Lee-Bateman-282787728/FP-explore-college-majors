3546309,5,B001E6HUXO,I am watching season 3 volume 2 now and it is as enjoyable as the others I've watched. The only problem I have is with the case.

3546360,5,B001E6HUXO,"Rawhide season 3 continues the Rawhide tradition of great writing, authentic story lines and superb acting. So many westerns are just fluff, fistfights and pretty girls. Rawhide did the best job I've ever seen of representing the hard work, long hours, loneliness, unpredictability of nature, cowboy humor and sheer determination that kept drovers moving millions of cattle north in the years after the Civil War. They literally rebuilt Texas and helped fuel the eastern economy as well. Clint Eastwood as Rowdy Yates continues to develop into a good actor, but Eric Fleming's seasoned acting ability and consistent realistic characterization of trail boss Gil Favor literally carries the show. Without Fleming, the show could not have achieved the high level of watching enjoyment that has satisfied Rawhide fans for generations. I first saw the show as an 11-year-old, instantly fell in love with it, and 50 years later am grateful it has been released on DVD so I can see shows I missed and enjoy the scenery, plots, interaction of Favor/Wishbone/Rowdy, and own what was the best, most authentic western series ever to be filmed on TV. I note that later DVD's give Clint Eastwood credit as lead actor, but all Rawhide buffs know Eric Fleming was the star and always will be.",1382140800,,1277,5.028301886792453

3546379,5,B001E6HUXO,I now have all of the first three seasons of this series.  This series was well written  and acted in and always had a good guest star to support the regular cast of characters.  Clint Eastwood showed his super star potential in the series.  Even though Eric Fleming was the star of this series Eastwood had a great character (Rowdy Yates) in support of Gil Favor.

3546384,5,B001E6HUXO,"CBS Television and Paramount Pictures presents ""RAWHIDE: SEASON THREE VOL. TWO"" (24 February 1961 - 16 June 1961) (779 mins/In Glorious Black & White) (digitally remastered in Dolby) -- Rawhide was a television western series that aired on the U.S. network CBS from 1959 to 1966. The show starred Eric Fleming and launched the career of Clint Eastwood --- The series ran for eight seasons on the CBS network on Friday nights, from January 9, 1959 to January 4, 1966, with a total of 217 episodes, all filmed and broadcast in black and white --- It was produced and sometimes directed by Charles Marquis Warren who also produced early episodes of Gunsmoke --- Warren based Rawhide on the movie Cattle Empire that he directed in 1958 and for which Endre Bohem was a screenwriter and Paul Brinegar, Steve Raines and Rocky Shahan were actors; all also worked in Rawhide --- Its premiere episode reached the top 20 in the Nielsen Ratings. It rose steadily in popularity until, towards the end of the series run, it was one of America's top ten shows --- Rawhide was the fourth longest-running American TV western, beaten only by nine years of The Virginian and Wagon Train, fourteen years of Bonanza, and twenty years of Gunsmoke.

The episode would be introduced, usually by some words from Gil Favor but sometimes by others --- The typical Rawhide story involved drovers, portrayed by Eric Fleming (Trail Boss Gil Favor) and Clint Eastwood (ramrod Rowdy Yates), coming upon people on the trail and getting drawn into solving whatever problem they presented or were confronting --- Some of the stories were obviously easier in production terms but the peak form of the show was convincing and naturalistic, and sometimes brutal. Its situations could range from parched plains to anthrax, ghostly riders to wolves, cattle raiding, bandits, murderers, and so forth --- A problem on such drives was the constant need for water, and the scout spent much of his time looking for it, sometimes finding water holes, even rivers had dried up - In some ways it was similar to the TV series Wagon Train that debuted in 1957.

Of all the western characters on TV, these were the only real cowboys, because they drove cows. There were also sheep boys who drove sheep, pig boys who looked after pigs, etc. The name cowboys became a generic name in western films and TV series --- The theme song's lyrics were written by Ned Washington in 1958. It was composed by Dimitri Tiomkin and sung by pop singer Frankie Laine. The theme song became very popular --- It was covered several times and parts of the song also appear in more recent movies like The Blues Brothers and Shrek.-- (From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia)

Thank you Paramount!

Here are some editorial reviews regarding the series.

Move 'em on. Head 'em up.

So where the words of the trail boss before the credits rolled during each episode of the 1959 CBS television show ""Rawhide."" Running for eight seasons between the years of 1959 and 1966, this television western is most notable for helping launch the career of a very young Clint Eastwood. After working on the series for six years, Eastwood would agree to star in Sergio Leone's ""A Fistful of Dollars"" between filming seasons in 1964. However, before one of the show's primary stars went on to box office fame, ""Rawhide"" was one of the most popular shows on television and held a top ten position during its inaugural year. Also featuring Eric Fleming, James Murdoch, Joseph Scarlett, Steven Raines and Rocky Shahan, ""Rawhide"" and its cast brought the Wild West to the small screen for an hour a week during the first half of the Sixties.

Running for over nineteen hours, the twenty three episodes from the first season of ""Rawhide"" provides a long and entertaining viewing experience. Prior to writing this review for ""Rawhide,"" I had watched another lengthy television series from the era, ""Perry Mason."" I had remarked at how that show felt like a series of Saturday movies that I remembered watching as I grew up. It did not have a television show feel to it. To an extent, ""Rawhide"" as a more epic feeling to each of its fifty minute episodes. The Wild West is detailed in glorious black and white and features a wide range of sets from old towns to the wide open range. There are plenty of horses and cattle and other Western critters. Overall, ""Rawhide"" has a very authentic look and feel to the series.

Eric Fleming is the series lead, Gil Favor. He is the trail boss for the cattle march that has left Texas with its precious herd. One of the hands, the young and inexperienced Rowdy Yates (Clint Eastwood) must learn the ways of cattle driving and become more experienced in the ways of life under the guidance of Favor. The cowboys' cook, Wishbone (Paul Brinegar) and cook's assistant Harkness ""Mushy"" Mushgrove (James Murdoch)  provide lighthearted relief to the gun hands. The rest of the crew includes Sheb Wooley (Pete Nolan), Wishbone (Paul Brinegar), Jim Quince (Steve Raines), Rocky Shahan (Joe Scarlett) among others. A large number of familiar faces appeared during the first season as guest stars. Lon Chaney Jr. appears in the episode ""Incident on the Edge of Madness."" Dick Van Patten guest stars in ""Incident of the Power and the Plow."" Star Trek's DeForest Kelley has a part in ""Incident at Barker Springs"" and Martin Landau and Leslie Nielsen both appear in ""Incident Below the Brazos.""

Each episode in this first season begins its title with ""Incident At."" The primary formula for the series finds the band of cowboys moving their herd and running into some sort of trouble that they must resolve. Many times these incidents involve a lovely and voluptuous damsel in distress. The women of the Old West were all so pretty and clean. Other times, the posse would find themselves being watched or pursued by nonfriendly folk. Land disputes, racial and other social stigmata and dirty scoundrels were among the problems faced by Gil, Rowdy, Mushy and the boys. Sometimes, the show bordered on tackling real social issues that were a sign of the times. ""Incident of the Power and the Plow"" deals in racist themes. ""Incident With An Executioner"" dealt with the question of whether or not capital punishment was wrong. Though they were not direct lessons in life, ""Rawhide"" tried to put something meaningful in each resolution of each incident.

The episodic nature of ""Rawhide"" allowed for enough character development and story continuity to keep the series entertaining. However, by not directly tying each individual story together, ""Rawhide"" is a show where you can watch the episodes in a different sequence that presented on the DVD set or you can even miss an episode and you never feel as if you were left behind in the last town visited by Rowdy and Gil. This also allowed Rowdy and others to move haphazardly between romantic interests without the viewer wondering if cowboys had a heart to break. The show felt like there was some semblance of continuity, but in the grand scheme of things, there really was not. Having never watched ""Rawhide"" before this DVD set (aside from a handful of episodes since I was a boy), I don't know if they ever got to their destination and there were various cattle drives, or if this was one long drive with eight years of incidents. The cowboys continually found themselves facing diversity in this first season and where one would think a cattle drive could be long and boring, this was certainly not the case for Gil Favor and his boys.

""Rawhide"" is an entertaining series. Some of the incidents that befall upon the riders are certainly more interesting than others. Having watched one complete season, I can see why this show was among the top ten during 1959. This was far more realistic and eventful than ""The Lone Ranger."" There is considerable amounts of death and misfortune during each episodes running times and ""Rawhide"" does not stoop to the level of having its heroes only shoot pistols out of the hands of the bad guys or other means of silliness to water down the show. I would imagine that back in 1959, ""Rawhide"" was considered programming for adults and not exactly a Saturday morning Western for the kids.  I wouldn't call ""Rawhide"" brutal, but the show wasn't afraid of a little violence.

and here's another review

Rollin' Rollin' Rollin'
Move 'em on, head 'em up,
Head 'em up, move 'em out,
Move 'em on, head 'em out,
Facts of the Case
Rawhide is the story of a trail drive led by trail boss Gil Favor (Eric Fleming). Savvy and hard-working but fair, Favor has a mixed bag of experienced men and wannabes working under him. There's Wishbone (Paul Brinegar) the cook (the real key to any successful drive); Mushy (James Murdock), his young assistant; old hands Quince and Nolan (Steve Raines and Sheb Wooley); and who's that young kid playing newcomer Rowdy Yates? Why, that's Clint Eastwood (Dirty Harry), in his first major role.

it climbed to the Top 20 within three weeks and stayed that way for four years.

Each episode title begins with the word ""Incident"" and that says a lot about the style of storytelling. ""Incident of the Tumbleweed Wagon,"" where they meet up with a lawman transporting a wagon full of prisoners, one of whom is a lovely young woman. ""Incident of the Power and the Plow,"" where the boys meet up with a land baron who thinks nothing of starting an Indian uprising for his own gain. ""Incident of the Chubasco,"" where the men agree to aid a young bride's attempt to escape her tyrant husband. Some episodes deal with the natural dangers of the Old West, from lack of water to injuries on the trail to diseases that can wipe out the cattle--or the people.

This mixed bag of stories allowed the series to take full advantage of the fabulous famous character actors of the era. You won't know most of their names, but I'll bet you'll recognize dozens of guest stars in these twenty-three episodes. There's Patty Duke's father (William Shallert), Sheriff Lobo (Claude Akins), even the voice of Linda Blair's demons (Mercedes McCambridge).

The other thing that sells it is its movie-like quality. The opening scenes are as expansive as the West. The music, which I have to think was done with a full studio orchestra, is right out of any feature-length western from the fifties.

Paramount did a nice job putting together this classic box set. I was concerned when I saw the grainy opening credits, but beyond a few additional pops and crackles the majority of the transfer is sharp and clean; amazing quality for a show that is over forty-five years old. Frankly, I'm surprised when shows of this age turn up at all.. I'm sure they didn't anticipate the technology to deliver these shows on discs that anyone could watch day or night. Kudos to the archivists that kept these prints safe so we could watch them today.

There are action sequences, gunfights and brawls, raging rivers and cattle stampedes, but mostly the show is about the characters.

There are no real extras include in the set, just the short production notes for each episode, which personally, I found fascinating.
Closing Statement
For a show whose theme is known the world over, Rawhide is actually a rare gem. Out of syndication since the seventies, this box set is likely to be the first time many people have seen the show. If you're a fan of Westerns or even of early TV, this is a must have. Clint Eastwood fans will also want to add this to their collection. [There is some] truly excellent storytelling.",1219104000,,9203,4.776729559748428

8296687,4,B001E6HUXO,"This is another positive review for the best 1960s western not titled Gunsmoke.  The only minor problem I had was the eventual star ""drover"" finding trouble by way of bullets and/or being framed for murder and/or robbery a bit too convenient a story line by RAWHIDEs 3rd Season Vol. 2.

 But, Gil Favor, Rowdy, Pete Nolan and Wisbone etc, are all here for the season they actually reached Sedalia, Missouri (end of the cattle trail line).  Good to see how they get/stay together for more
And look how many good ""Incident"" episodes were directed by Ted Post who would eventually direct Clint Eastwood (Rowdy Yates) in the movies ""Hang'em High"" (1967) and the Dirty Harry sequel ""Magnum Force"" (1973).
RAWHIDE Season 3 ended in 1961.
