Would have been helpful if he had given a list of the paint colors he used. I bought the book as well and that contained info about all his supplies as well as step by step directions for many more projects. The DVD only contains two projects. I learn better from watching an artist work than I do from reading books alone and since there isn't much info out in the world on how to use acrylics in place of watercolors  I was glad when I found this DVD. I would highly recommend this DVD as well as the book, it is easy enough to understand  even for a beginner. .",1375574400,2,703,4.2388059701492535
