1901703,5,B0000A2ZNX,"The CDs are in perfect condition.  The 5 star  review is for the product, but I can't help commenting on how much the industry has improved in 35 years.  This was such a great mini-series in its day. The skull caps for the Japanese look pretty hokey and the acting has a lot of flared nostrils and glowering looks. The author, James Clavell was the producer so the film follows the book very well. Richard Chamberlain will always be William Adams, AKA Anjin.",1516752000,,458,4.493975903614458

1901710,5,B0000A2ZNX,"I watched this as a child with my parents and became fascinated with Japanese culture because of it. Later in life, I rose to the challenge of reading the book, which was also well worth the effort. This miniseries captures quite a bit of the magic in the book, but the ending leaves much to be desired. There was some legal drama that caused the team to finish it rather abruptly. Still well worth watching. I will always wonder what might have been had they had time to finish it properly.",1512086400,,491,4.406593406593407

1901725,2,B0000A2ZNX,"This set leaves out a significant part of the plot between Discs 3 and 4. The omitted part is approximately one hour long and omits the part of the plot where Blackthorn and Mariko visit Osaka the second time. Without writing a spoiler alert, let's just say that if you haven't read the book, you will be completely lost at the beginning of Disc 4. I do like the story, but I will admit that the acting is pretty bad and the costumes are terrible (particularly the latex makeup helmets that the samurai wear to look bald and the pirate outfits that the Europeans wear). Also, of note, there are no subtitles (which I could live without honestly), so oftentimes the viewer must infer what is said by tones and gestures. I would only watch this DVD set after reading the book, which is what I did and I'm quite certain that one viewing will suffice for me.",1503187200,,854,4.4113924050632916

1901729,5,B0000A2ZNX,"We had a Shogun marathon and forgot how enjoyable it was to watch this mini-series, especially with no commercials.  The time flew by when we were watching it.  The acting and scenery are top notch.  It's very easy to follow with the transition between English and Japanese language.",1501977600,,283,4.854166666666667
1901730,4,B0000A2ZNX,Came new as described. The movie isn't what I expected. It does follow the book closely. No English subtitles for the Japanese though,1501804800,,133,4.826086956521739
1901731,5,B0000A2ZNX,This is One of My favorite movies. He always calls English. And it's such a nice movie to learn about the hard ways the Japanese lives before he (John Blackthorn) brought them a new way of living. Thanks the the great Ins rat he's DVD. It's very nice to have.

1901746,5,B0000A2ZNX,"The boxed set for Shogun arrived on time, and I've truly enjoyed it. A year or so ago, I picked up the novel Shogun from a local bookstore and I've discovered it's a compelling story. I admit, the novel does go into more detail than the mini-series does in certain areas. I'll admit that, but the mini-series comes very close. The theme, the setting, the costumes, the props, the pacing has been focused on in great detail. The author of the novel, to the cast and crew that created the mini-series did a wonderful job.",1498089600,,519,4.473684210526316

1901754,5,B0000A2ZNX,"So glad to actually own this and watch it all the way through.  Compared to today's V shows and movies, the special effects seem unsophisticated, but that actually allows the viewer to concentrate on the storyline instead of  counting how many cars were blown up in 5 minutes.  After this series, I'll read more about Samurais.",1494720000,,327,4.803571428571429

1901757,4,B0000A2ZNX,"A look at feudal Japan around the year 1600. I saw this series when it first came out in 1980 and was fascinated. Make sure that you watch the extras after you've seen the entire series. It's long, four days plus one more for the extras, but time well spent. It explains in part the thinking and society of Japan today. Make sure you read the trivia on the Internet Movie Database (IMDB).",1493856000,,388,4.328767123287672

I bought the DVD to introduce it to my wife and daughter. We watched the series over 2 or 3 evenings and I was happy to see that they found it just as fascinating as I do.

He stayed up late to watch it, and it had no English subtitles then, but he followed the story pretty easily. It made such an impression on him that he remembered it years afterwards. He told me about it twice, and how he wished that he could find it in a store. I knew that I had to get it for him, so I ordered it for him. It was a surprise, and he cried when he opened it, he said that it was the best gift that anyone had ever given him. I just wanted to say thank you to the seller, for helping to make his day like that. We're going to watch it together!",1484092800,,647,3.8

1901798,4,B0000A2ZNX,"I have read (and re-read) the book at least five times. The produced-for-TV mini-series will of course lack much of the nuance and has compressed some of the character's story lines. Given the constraints of a video presentation this is inevitable. The music composed by Jarre is, at times ""Jarr-ing"" and some of the production values are a bit dated given this review is some forty years after the fact. All that gives it the one-less star than video-perfection. Other than that, and especially if you had never read the book, this production is a wonderful time. I have the original VHS version and until my VHS-player's demise, I was quite content to play (and re-play) it in that format. The DVD version, however adds the usual interviews and extras such as an overview of the culture of the samurai which adds much to the value. I think many folks who like samurai-themed drama (and who wouldn't with the inimitable Toshiro Mifune as Toronaga) would really enjoy this epic. A classic of the 70's and 80's group of mini-series!",1482624000,,1031,4.76536312849162
1901799,3,B0000A2ZNX,"The series did roughly follow the James Clavell novel, though much was left out. Partly due to the novel being so complicated, but also because the series was geared less to explain history of 1600 Japan and its relation to Europe than it was to introduce America to Japanese culture when most Americans knew little about sake and ninjas.

Visually the movie was pretty, but the story focused far too much on the love affair between Blackthorne and Mariko, wife of another samurai, with their spending a lot of time laying together and saying repeatedly how much they love one another. Enough already, we got the idea. And what about Mariko's husband, he just lets it all happen? (The novel explains how this problem ended up being bypassed.) Good if you want light entertainment, but read the novel for a much more long and complicated but more thorough and logical story.",1482192000,,873,4.781456953642384
1901800,5,B0000A2ZNX,"My husband and I watched this as a miniseries when it first aired and enjoyed it very much. After, we both read the book but had not thought about it again until I purchased the audiobook from Audible. We listened and it rekindled all the old fascination we had felt so many uears sgo, so I adked for thos set for a Christmas gift.
It arrives last week amd we had to discipline ourselves not to watch all discs on day one.
From the very first scene you are taken in, transported back hundreds of years into the past, using only your wits to keep you alive.  The costumes and setting are unequaled. Just beautiful.
The japanese is not subtitled, but usually you either get a translation from a character who speaks Japanese or can figure out the heart of the conversation through context. Occasionally a voice over lets you know what major characters are thinking or give an insight into an important event.
This miniseries is by nature an abridged version of the best seller. For the full experience,  read the book and listen to the audiobook, but follow it up with this cd set. You'll never look at Japan the same again.",1482192000,,1122,4.495098039215686

The next night I watched part 2 and so forth and so on throughout the mini series. Every morning waking up late and running for school bus but, it was worth it. I actually scored an A+ on a report for the series.

The 1600s was the early transition to the Edo Period where the Shogun held power and enforced the peace on Japan. It is the era of some of Japan's greatest swordsmen, including Musashi. Accessing it through the character of ""English"" gives the Western mind easy access to the Japanese culture of the day. The full mini-series version is a must.",1447372800,,509,4.730337078651686

1901930,5,B0000A2ZNX,"I first saw ""Shogun"" when it premiered on Australian television in 1980 when I was 10. Having watched it again, some 35 years later, it is a testimony to the drama that I remembered much of the series. Based on James Clavell's novel, the screenplay, cinematography, casting, acting and sets are all of the highest order - I only wished there was more and was sad when it ended. Richard Chamberlain and his fellow cast are excellent. The miniseries represents a high point for historical dramas, combining the sweep of history with the intimacy of human interactions with a degree of success which few historical pieces have managed to achieve. A truly outstanding drama which would not be equaled until many years later by HBO's ""Rome"" series. ""Shogun"" makes ""Game of Thrones"" look downright juvenile.

1901977,5,B0000A2ZNX,"A TV series based on James Clavell's great best-seller, Shogun, this four DVD set also contains an extra DVD with additional resources.  It does a good job of covering the hundred of pages telling the story of an English pilot of a Dutch ship sailing into the fabled Eastern seas in the early 17th century. He crash lands in feudal Japan where samurai warriors are part of a strict class system that seems in constant warfare. He has problems with an alien culture but meets and falls in love with a noble women who amazing speaks Latin and Portuguese .  His karma throws him into a boiling pot right before it spills over, and Richard Chamberlain does justice to the pilot struggling to survive in a world he doesn't understand.  He becomes an ally to a samurai lord fighting to become the greatest of the warlords, the Shogun.  Filmed in Japan's  beautiful locations, this well-done, six hour series brings a great book
to life.",1434326400,,930,4.646341463414634

1901994,5,B0000A2ZNX,One of the classics!!  I have a weakness for novels and mini-series like this.  There is enough detail and richness here to make 100 hours of TV.. and it's crammed into a short 10-piece set.  A must for anyone that loves a good story..,1432598400,,235,4.295454545454546

1902021,5,B0000A2ZNX,"James Clavell's depth of understanding of the Japanese culture is in a word outstanding.  One gains many insights here just in this book, for he misses no pertinent details in his writing.  This is a brilliant piece of historical fiction in that it is based on real events of the time and in some cases real people.  One of the beauties of this production is that it was shot entirely on location and had to surmount a number of obstacles one does not ordinarily encounter in a Hollywood production even of this magnitude.  The major roles, everyone of them, were well chosen and well portrayed.  While the potential brutality of the culture of necessity had to come to the fore on occasion, it did demonstrate the wide gap between concepts of the East and those of the West, between those of Shintoism and those of Christianity.  Just on that score it was most instructive.  It would be nice to see any of the other five in this set of six novels which loosely trace the history of this general subject from the late 16th century to the mid-20th century.",1431561600,,1055,4.550264550264551

The product information on the sleeve was all in German, but the disks do have the original English language voices and there is an English subtitle option. I now realise that the green square that appears on the front of the casing is the German age restriction symbol.

This series is now about 35 years old! Buyers should note that this release has NOT been digitally remastered. The playback is a little blurry on a LED TV and the images can be rather poor by current standards. No doubt it would look better on an old TV.

Disk 5 is a special features disk. It includes the following features:
The making of Shogun;

I learned a few words of Japanese by watching this film and was inspired to start learning the language.  This epic series will stand for years to come.

1902133,5,B0000A2ZNX,"An oldie but goody.  It's a great story actually.  Story of a European sailor who gets stuck in ""The Japans"".  He 1st has to survive, learn their ways and culture, then by luck, work, and his own ingenuity, he thrives with them.  A great story and example about how early Europeans viewed everybody as ""savages"" at 1st only to adopt the superior parts of their culture later down the road.  An interesting look at early Japanese samurai culture and thinking, compared to that of the new world.  The movie ""The Last Samurai"" with Tom Cruise seems to borrow heavily from this story.

1902149,2,B0000A2ZNX,"Five stars for the production values and the use of actual Japanese actors.  This is really a great production visually and the plot moves along briskly.  It was very popular when it premiered on NBC in my mostly European-ancestry town but people were askance when the Japanese woman stripped and entered a bathtub with the main character and there was anti-Asian backlash after that.  People underneath it all find some conduct offensive and they hold it against the perpetrators or people or children who look like the perpetrators.

Interestingly, James Clavell was a POW at Changi and he wrote a less mystical and more practically useful series of books about Hong Kong which was very disturbing to read (I never read Shogun and Noble House but I did read Taipan and King Rat) - Taipan is very harsh and plain spoken and adult.  I didn't mind the characterizations of the Chinese but I think it is interesting the background of the author.

SPOILERS

My parents were very impressed by the earthquake scene but much of the story went over their heads.  However, we were all shocked that he didn't get to go home in the end despite all the previous talk about honor and samurai code and stuff.  Holy crap, they lied.

Japanese never let the Richard Chamberlain character go home as they promised - even Star Trek Voyager got to go home!

In hindsight, this scarred me because I never wanted to watch Star Trek Voyager because I couldn't stand that carrot always dangled in front of the cast of hope but no certainty.

It would come back when I read PIEPEL.  Everyone who is an adult should read PIEPEL.",1409097600,,1604,4.665480427046264

Portuguese map.
The Productions were first rate, although they suffered with the weather. And Translations issues. But it never shows on the screen. My only issue with the production, was that the didn't use subtitles, for the Japanese actors. Although they used Orsen Welles. Do do the Naration, to explain what was going on.
The Series was based on the best seller. By James Clavell's book of the same name. Also a great read.

It is a truly romantic movie with plenty of action for action lovers.",1401148800,,387,4.319444444444445
1902173,5,B0000A2ZNX,I was going to Japan and watched the TV series now on DVD.  It was fabulous!  I highly recommend it.,1400198400,,100,3.95
1902174,2,B0000A2ZNX,"I'm too young to remember the original broadcast of Shogun, but I checked out the DVDs recently because I'm interested in Japanese culture. I shouldn't have bothered. This miniseries is badly dated, and doesn't hold up in comparison to actual Japanese movies with similar themes.

First, the plot is quite predictable. (Watch out, I'm about to drop some spoilers.) Richard Chamberlain plays John Blackthorne, a European who arrives in Japan under duress. During the early scenes, he's repeatedly threatened and imprisoned by the Japanese, and he's totally alienated because he doesn't understand their language. But, conveniently enough, Blackthorne soon saves the life of a local lord (several times!) and quickly rises in status from begrimed prisoner to samurai boss of a small town.

Meanwhile, Blackthorne falls in love with a beautiful Japanese interpreter. Naturally, she returns his feelings. Naturally, she's married to a hateful and abusive jerk, so the audience can root for Blackthorne to whisk her away with a clear conscience. It's all so cliched, and so easy for Blackthorne. At every turn, he rescues or enlightens Japanese characters and gains their favor without seeming to even break a sweat. It's formulaic, rags-to-riches stuff. (And yes, I have heard that this is loosely based on true events. True events, mixed with baloney, I suspect.)

Making matters even worse, Shogun feels a bit racist to me. This miniseries is famous for introducing American audiences to Japanese culture, yet in my view, Japan is depicted in an entirely negative light here. The Japanese characters are all subservient, robotic, and ultra-violent. They constantly threaten to kill each other (and indeed follow through on the killing) for the most trivial reasons. In many scenes, Blackthorne - the virtuous Caucasian who is clearly meant to be morally superior to the Japanese - looks down on Japanese culture and complains that it's based purely on violence. Yeah, well, in this movie it's all violence; in reality, it has about seven million additional facets. I can't help but conclude that Shogun was meant to stimulate Western interest in Japan, while simultaneously reassuring Western audiences that theirs is the superior culture.

Given that, it's rather ironic and amusing that Japanese actor Toshiro Mifune gives by far the best performance in the whole thing. Despite the fact that Mifune's character is often low-key and has little to do, he totally eclipses the cheesy Richard Chamberlain and the hammy John Rhys-Davies. It's just a shame that, in certain key scenes, Mifune's Japanese dialogue is drowned out by Orson Welles' super-loud English narration. Why render a great actor inaudible? Hadn't the production team ever heard of subtitles? It's one of many lapses in this rather silly, overrated production.",1399420800,,2825,5.299107142857143
1902175,5,B0000A2ZNX,This is one of the best versions of the book I ever saw. It followed the book as closely as they could make it. This is a 5 DVD set. Four DVDs are the Movie and one DVD is the extras.  The extras are as good as the mini series itself. You can't go wrong with one.,1398902400,,263,3.6140350877192984
1902176,3,B0000A2ZNX,"This IS an edited copy missing or abbreviated important (to me) scenes. The copy is not very good, showing  lot of chatter and grain on my 27"" Retina display. The story itself is still great. We'll just have to wait for a more complete (perhaps even digitally corrected) version. <sigh>",1398556800,,286,4.72
1902177,5,B0000A2ZNX,"I remember when ""Shogun"" was first broadcast on television, 34 years ago, it drew a phenomenal audience rating. The absolute excellence and quality of the cast performances and the faithfulness to Clavell's novel make this truly one of the best productions I ever saw on the small screen (along with Centennial, Richard Chamberlain's other Tour de force from that era).  This DVD set is worth every penny of the asking price. It has the entire mini-series as originally broadcast, and a whole extra DVD of bonus material, including a 90 minute behind the camera look at the making of the movie. NOTE: Because this was a made-for-TV movie to begin with, the original film was 35mm full-frame format, rather than the more common wide-screen format films like Panavision or Cinemascope. So the DVD is 720x480, 1.5:1 aspect ratio, which will fill a 4:3 monitor or TV set without top/bottom letterboxing, but will NOT fill a wide screen monitor from side to side: If you are watching this on a 16:9 screen, DON'T set it to stretch the image to fit, as this will make even the skinny villagers in Anjiro look like Sumo wrestlers.  Both audio and Video quality are excellent: the producers of this DVD took care to use as clean a print of the film as possible for the transfer. Also, in case you didn't know this, the story presented in this film is loosely based on real people and real historical events in Japan in the 1590's through 1603. Lord Toranaga is based on Tokugawa Ieyasu, who was appointed Shogun in 1603. The battle of Sekigahara, mentioned by the narrator (Orson Welles) at the very end of the film, actually happened, on October 21, 1600. John Blackthorne is based on a real English seaman, William Adams, who became an advisor to the Tokugawa Shogunate.  Also, while this movie is very enjoyable in it's own right, I recommend that you pick up a copy of the novel and read it. It's quite a tome, amounting to around 1000 pages in paperback, but well worth your time.",1398211200,,1977,4.675287356321839

1902209,5,B0000A2ZNX,My wife and I watched the entire  series on PBS decades ago. It is so well done we decided the buy the DVD set and watch it again. It is that good. Casting is outstanding as the sets and suspense.,1388966400,,196,3.9
1902210,3,B0000A2ZNX,"BUT!  The BOOK is probably one of the best I've ever read. I watched this back in the 70's.  I'm old.  HA!  Aaaanyway! Watching this mini-series was a perfect lead-in to reading the book.  You get the gist of the plot.  And you have faces to associate with the exotic names of all the characters.  So, that made following the book much easier.

The actors are all good. The music is awful - typical 70's tv-show quality.  I'm surprised at how much of the dialog is in Japanese and how little of it is explained.  But, that does give us a good feeling of how Blackthorn - the main charactor - is experiencing the whole thing.  This was a brave and unusual approach!",1388793600,,664,4.317073170731708

1902235,5,B0000A2ZNX,"probably one of the best stories ever :)  The dvd mini series is great - there are variations, but the longer [including more material] the better.  The book is a great compliment to the 16 hr dvd, as is usually the case - fills in sooooooo much more background and detail not possible to cover in the film version.  I *like* most of the minor changes made in the film version.  Fascinated with feudal Japan & the samurai and bushido anyway, so this was a great presentation of a beloved subject",1385769600,,495,4.406593406593407

1902237,5,B0000A2ZNX,I saw this movie for the first time when I was eight years old and I absolutely LOVED IT!!!!  When we got it on beta max I watched it over and over and over... I mimicked the mannerisms of the ladies and I learned to speak Japanese watching this movie.  I still remember a lot of what I learned 30 years later and my Japanese clients have been impressed.  Little do they know I learned to speak from a movie.,1385251200,,408,4.075

1902239,2,B0000A2ZNX,"To the extent that it followed the book, a very wonderful storyline which is what saved it from getting only one star.

Big failure by the casting director:
Richard Chamberlain is a wonderful actor and put in a good effort, but this wasn't at all the right role for him. The main character is supposed to be a physically powerful, larger-than-life figure full of dynamic energy. Chamberlain didn't even look as rugged as a recreational weekend suburban hiker, let alone a lifetime seaman and Pilot of that time. His character would have had to be capable of instant ruthless violence just to survive what he went through. No way is Chamberlain suitable for that portrayal either.

Also, the movie's ending was quite weak compared to the book. And so forth. There are many other reviews that say basically the same thing.

Read the book instead!",1384473600,,844,4.8068965517241375

The entire story line from start to finish, captured my imagination and added zest to what I thought 17th century life had been like at that time. Maybe the book would be better than the series now, because this time around; I found ""Shogun"" to be long and drawn out.

You never get tired of listening to the dialogue of Mariko San explaining the way of life in Japan. Even today Japanese people; most of them  at least have this beauty of thought that no Western Civilization has had or I think will ever have.
I am married to a Japanese gentlemen for over 38 years. Every day I learn the beauty and the thoughts of these wonderful people.
I strongly recommend this DVD as you will never get tired of watching . You will learn a lot of the Zen way of thinking and how Japan was in the past and understand to a certain extent Japan today.

1902296,5,B0000A2ZNX,"This outstanding mini-series was first aired on NBC in 1980.  Based on James Clavell's outstanding book ""Shogun"" it stars Richard Chamberlain as Captain-Pilot John Blackthorne, an Englishman and pilot and navigator of the Dutch ship ""Erasmus"" who due to a storm finds itself in Japan.  The year is around 1603 and Japan is a closed country to foreigners except hostile Jesuit Portuguese Catholic Priests who are the enemy of England, and of Protestants, in which Captain Blackthorne is both.  Toshiro Mifune is the the powerful Japanese Warlord Yoshi Toronaga who is in charge of over a million Japanese Samurai and overtime befriends Captain Blackthorne due to his knowldege of the outside world.  Yoko Shimada is the beautiful Japanese Interpreter Mariko who overtime falls in love with Captain Blackthorne. John Rhys-Davies is the Portugues Pilot Rodrigues who is a friend and enemy of Captain Blackthorne.  The plot is outstanding, the details are outstanding, the acting and other actors in the series are outstanding.  This is the mini-series that started the network mini-series trend that continues to this day.  It is as fascinating and fun to watch as it was over 30 years ago.  I highly recommend this DVD set to all who enjoy good adventure, great acting, Medieval Japan, and Medieval History as well.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1376438400,,1334,5.167441860465116

1902323,5,B0000A2ZNX,"... filled with romance and beautiful scenery and periods of great adventure and chaos.  Alas, it's a true story of a man shipwrecked in 1630 in feudal Nippon.  Anyone who knows the book was wowed by how faithfully they brought it to the screen, in a four night miniseries of 2-3 hours each that let the viewer live the elegance and horror and majesty of a truly foreign culture.

Populated for the most part by Japanese actors and rendered in meticulous detail, you get to live with Richard Chamberlain as Blackthorn, the English ship-pilot, stranded in a brutal yet subtle political battle between powerful giants - and he more than holds his own.  Wonderful costumers, sets, countryside.  This DVD is an investment that you will watch again and again.

Only available in the format of the day, not widescreen, but good sound, and a tale you will lose yourself in.  Walk with the samurai and experience the adventure and danger and triumph of true love meeting across incredibly diverse cultures.

The TV rendition followed James Clavell's Shogun with great accuracy, but the novel fills in much more background and helps to flesh out and understand the movie that much better.

1902396,5,B0000A2ZNX,My Father had been bugging me to find him a copy of this show for years and it was only available on VHS for an insane amount of money. Someone finally had the sense to release a DVD copy and it made a wonderful Christmas present. It has held up remarkably well over the years and was as engaging to watch now as it was when I watched it as a young man many years ago.,1366848000,,368,3.8552631578947367

1902398,5,B0000A2ZNX,The seller shipped on time and the DVD collection was in new condition.

1902404,5,B0000A2ZNX,"This mini-series covered a pivotal period in Japanese history.  As well as the influences of the Western culture and religious influence.  At times the sub-title were a bit difficult.  i.e.  white subtitle on white or very light background.  I watched it when it was first televised, and both husband and myself have wanted our own copy ever since.  But the cost when released on VHS was prohibitive.  We budgeted to acquire this DVD copy with no regrets.  It plays fine on our systems.  No regrets with purchase.

1902406,4,B0000A2ZNX,"I wish more 'movies' applied the same degree of care and faithfulness to the accuracy and ambiance inherent in the particular setting or culture being presented. The series, in my humble opinion, is a paragon of fine movie making. I must admit that some sections were frustratingly grainy, perhaps in part because I still have a good, but standard TV. I have a Blu-ray player, but my TV does not have the input for the HDMI cable. Most movies look great, yet some less so. The acting and cinematography are superb. I haven't read the novel, but I found the Richard Chamberlain character irrationally bold on many occasions. Notwithstanding, I find this series exceptional, and magnificently produced; a true work of art. This was a worthy purchase. Please note that I gave this series four stars because it was not digitally remastered. Still, the bulk of the production is quite good. I failed to mention that the bonus features are extensive; a 13-segment documentary on the making of Shogun, historical featurettes, and audio commentary by the director on selected scenes.",1364083200,,1075,4.977777777777778

1902408,5,B0000A2ZNX,"Shogun is arguably the best mini-series yet produced, but is disappointing due to the nude scenes of Mariko (Yoko Shimada) being cut. Some reviewers have suggested that the european version contains these deleted scenes. It does not! To see these nude scenes get a vhs copy of the two hour version. This version contains the scene where Mariko strips and gets into the bath with Blackthorn. She is definately naked.",1363737600,,415,4.942857142857143

1902448,5,B0000A2ZNX,"Shogun was a miniseries which originally aired in the early 1980's. I somewhat remember watching it when I was a little kid. It starred Richard Chamberlain (then known as the king of the miniseries as he also starred in Centennial and the
Thorn Birds). Chamberlain plays John Blackthorne a 17th century seaman. Blackthorne finds himself shipwrecked in Japan after a long voyage from Europe. He, and what's left of his crew quickly, runs into trouble and culture shock as they try to adapt to Japanese prison and the Japanese way of life from that time period. I found it to still be interesting 30 years later and if you're a fan of the 70's/80's miniseries' then you'll probably enjoy this one too. Total movie running time is about 10 hours plus they also include a retrospective of the film from the point of view of the surviving cast and crew 30 years after filming",1358726400,,870,4.6558441558441555
1902449,5,B0000A2ZNX,"Maybe the Greatest Mini Series ever!!! Loved the book, loved the mini series! Clavell provides a window into Asia and the Asian mind in every book he wrote and I read them all.

1902452,5,B0000A2ZNX,Get the two disc version and watch the problems and solutions that come with making a movie of this scale. Casting was superb. Acting was Chamberlain's best and his beautifull co star was WOW.  My next ex wife will be Japanese. She has a voice that just holds you to her every word. A side note if you are interested and even if your not you will want to learn Japanese. They explain how really simple it is to learn. They captured the mentality of both the Europians and Japanese. Best movie by far that I've seen.,1358121600,,515,4.309278350515464

It is a great love story and a powerful lesson that anyone can change.  If you love history and are interested in 15th century period costumes and customs you will learn so much. I would recommend any television or VHS movie or series you have ever loved is greatly enhanced by DVD and has subtitles to understand everything they are saying.,1356739200,,488,4.674418604651163

As a matter of fact I already watched the entire series twice. Richard Chamberlin does such a good job of portraying his character that it's so believable to me. I have a great deal of respect for the Japanese culture and the way they depict their loyalty and dedication to their masters almost brings me to tears.

Richard Chamberlain, Toshiro Mifune, Yoko Shimada, Damien Thomas & John Rhys-Davies (aka Sallah in Raiders Of The Lost Ark & Indiana Jones And The Last Crusade, Gimli in the Lord Of The Rings trilogy and Mordecai in One Night With The King) star, and they do a great job. Having Citizen Kane himself provide narration was a stroke of genius on the producers' part. It would have been good to see Sean Connery (aka James Bond) as Blackthorne, but for some reason, he balked at doing television, and we ended up with a homosexual as Pilot-Major John Blackthorne, which makes a scene where Blackthorne and Mariko are talking about pillowing very ironic.

My gripes with this miniseries are few, and I shall list them. (SPOILERS MAY FOLLOW)

I. There were no subtitles for the Japanese dialogue. I know that this may have been done for the feel of authenticity, which I understand (that was Mel Gibson's initial idea when he directed The Passion Of The Christ; good thing he later decided to add subtitles), but it's a great disadvantage for those of us who do not speak Japanese.

II. The scene with Kuki and Omi came out of nowhere, as we had never seen them together, and therefore added nothing significant to the plot.

III. Implying the final battle between Toranaga and Ishido & the outcome in voice-over made no sense whatsoever.

IV. The ending made Toranaga seem less honourable than he had previously been seen as throughout the mini-series, and as more of a power-hungry warlord. It also didn't have a good payoff for Blackthorne, not showing him by Toranaga's side and obsessed with leaving Japan, and what the devil was it with Mariko saying in the letter that SHE was the one behind the burning of the Erasmus? Again, that made no sense whatsoever.

Regarding the nude scenes and additional violence available in the European version of the miniseries, I personally have no problem with them. However, keep in mind that the miniseries aired on ABC, which is owned by Disney and they did not allow graphic violence & nudity in their programs (sadly, it's different now, with ABC airing shows like Modern Family and recently greenlighting a pilot from Jennifer Lopez about a homosexual or lesbian couple).

Good miniseries, with the exceptions I noted above, and the fact that Chamberlain likes men. Good thing I saw it for free, though.",1350259200,,2535,4.771689497716895

1902507,5,B0000A2ZNX,"What is Japanese? Hundreds of dramas have been made so far to find out about it. I happened to be one of them and I am keenly interested in how American and European drama portray Japan and Japanese. In most of the cases Japanese in American films or dramas are something to be laughed at even by Japanese themselves. But SHOGUN, aired in 1980, one of the most successful Samurai dramas produced by non-Japanese staffs, predating&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Last-Samurai-Two-Disc-Special-Edition/dp/B0001JXOVC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Last Samurai (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>more than two dacades, is something different. It is done with sincere attitude to understand our culture. So this drama is in a way Kurosawa meets David Lean(The Bridge Over River Kwai).

Overall this drama is set in last segment of Sengoku days during late 16th to early 17th century, but the author made the drama so it can be applicable to present-day situation. Better understanding of each culture is the key to mitigate the tension between U.S and Japan. In this drama you are thrown into the foreign land you know little about. As Blackthorne's understanding of the Japanese culture and language improve so could that of the viewers to find out what is really going on.

Locations for the drama were entirely in Japan. You can even find some of the popular castles in Japan. Himeji Castle was used as Osaka Castle where Lord Ishido(Mitsunari Ishida) and Lady Ochiba(Lady Yodo) resided. Hikone Castle was used as Lord Toranaga(Iyeyasu Tokugawa)'s castle near Osaka Castle. (Historically Fushimi Castle). Matsumoto Castle was used as a local castle somewhere in Shinano(Currently Nagano Prefecture). Kumamoto Castle was used as Yedo Castle.

NBC picked Clavell's work to get dramatized because SHOGUN is a Samurai drama American people love through Kurosawa films.
To meet the challenge of creating a samurai drama, Production team allied with TOHO STUDIOS, which produced early Kurosawa works and has expertise in special effects as shown in Godzilla series. Toho staffs even corrected some of the factual errors the original scripts had. (But Japanese staffs might have been amazed how accurate James Clavell's understanding of Japanese people, culture and their mindset.)
The genius in special effect was shown in Earthquake scene which took part in Anjiro in Izu Peninsula. Actually the magnitude 6.9 earthquake hit Izu in 1974 one year before the novel finished. They truly did a great work to make the novel spectacle scene in live-action.

Actors are splendid as well. Toshiro Mifune as Lord Toranaga(Iyeyasu)
does not seem fit as the image of Iyeyasu at first but as the drama goes on it is becoming fit as a fiddle particularly how he acted in the event of finding Blackthorne's ship Erasmus got burned at the last part of the drama. Frankie Sakai best known by the role in Sekai Daisendo,or the Last War as Lord Yabu made a great performance particularly the way he becomes a traitor and the way he commits seppuku(harakiri). Richard Chambalain as Blackthorne(William Adams) is comical and cute particularly when he speaks simple Japanese. He looks as if he were one of the English teachers living in Japan who enjoys the company of Japanese girls. Damien Thomas as Father Alvito and John Rhys-Davis as Rodrigues are stunning as well. They see Blackthorne as threat at first but they finally serve to save Blackthorne's life.

Jesuit Christians vs Blackthorne is quite amusing because it is rare in Japanese Samurai dramas that their hostile attitude to each other is aptly described. Outside Japan they are enemies but in Japan they must get along with each other or they can not survive in Samurai's land. Such was the situation during second world war. Alliance finally prevailed. Clavell seems to imply from his bitter experience his idea that the Gaijins in Japan should cooperate each other irrespective of their cultural differences through this drama.

Mariko as Yoko Shimada actually was the producer's second choice because the top candidate couldn't fit the shooting schedule. But she took the role partly because she performed the role of Lady Gracia, the character model of Mariko in NHK drama in 1978. Nagging problem was how to conquer the dilemma of her being both Christian and being the member of Samurai family.
In Christianity committing suicide is regarded as sin. In this drama it showed Mariko's intent of suicide and then she didn't become a ""sinner"".

Verdict: Excellent Samurai Drama produced in the U.S.

This product is a five DVD set containing the movie and one DVD of special features, including how it was made and interviews with the crew and cast members.  It is, of course, faithful to the original presentation and looked great on our 60"" TV.  It comes in the usual plastic container and a very presentable cardboard cover.  For those unfamiliar with the movie, an English pilot (navigator) and Dutch crew of a sailing ship in the 17th century are shipwrecked on one of the Japanese islands and the Pilot wins favor with a Japanese warlord during a time when the warlord is vying for the position of Shogun (military ruler of Japan).  Focus is on the Samurai culture and tradition of that time and the Pilot's struggle with a forbidden love interest in his assigned interpreter, the wife of a Samurai ""captain,"" and a Jesuit priest who he sees as his enemy.

It is somewhat understandable that one might be confused between scenes in the book and in the series.

I seem to remember, however, that the mini-series was first shown without the narrator's voice and viewers who hadn't read the book couldn't follow it, so the re-run was re-done with the over-voice. It is still advisable to read the book first, though.

I bought the DVD because my elderly father just read the book on his Kindle and loved it. He appreciated the closed captions because he's hard of hearing. Of course, the Japanese dialogue is not translated/captioned because part of the interest is that the viewer should be as clueless as the Anjin-san and his crew as to what is being said.

1902515,5,B0000A2ZNX,"This was one of the most popular mini-series from my childhood. I loved it at the time and nostalgia dictates that I can't claim to review it without bias.

The story of a shipwrecked English Pilot in Medieval Japan circa 1600. This mini-series was the first exposure that many people in America had to Samurai, Ninjas and Japanese culture.  One of the most original elements was that the Japanese spoke Japanese and that subtitles only gradually appear as the main character begins to understand Japanese. This was a daring thing to do in a US Television mini-series but I think it really caught people's imagination at the time. I prefer subtitled foreign films anyway! The acting is very good : Lord Toragana is played by none other than Toshiro Mifune (the famous actor from many Kurasawa films I saw many years later) and John Rhys-Davies is unforgettable as Rodrigues. The story is very good although I thought the love story was a little over-emphasized (and perhaps unrealistic)but there's plenty of action for a 10-year old boy.

It is surprising but true that James Clavell's novel was inspired by the true story of an English Pilot who was part of a Dutch expedition shipwrecked in Japan around 1600. That English Pilot, named William Adams not John Blackthorn, really became an advisor to Lord Tokugawa (who became Shogun) and was known as Anjin-sama.

I lived in Japan for 8 years and I must say the movie is pretty accurate as far as Japanese culture goes.

1902518,5,B0000A2ZNX,"I was lost in thoughts on how to rate this mini series, and decided to go with a 5 star rating.

It's a fact that this TV series was extremely popular when it was first aired.
And those people, including my parents can't be wrong.
In 1980, this TV series set the lower (and higher) limits in TV.

OK, three things to consider

1) The real-life figure, William Adams.
2) The James Clavell's book based on William Adam's life.
3) And this TV series.

The good thing is they somewhat match in all aspects.

CLOSED CAPTIONS:
There are many scenes in Japanese only with no subtitles.
If you ever tried to learn a foreign language, you'd know this is what, and how it happens.
And the director wanted to give the same feeling. No subtitle IS A BRILLIANT idea. And they explain all those details anyway.

To me, there were two downsides.

In the first episode, in the very first scene (on 54th second) Orson Wells (the narrator) says ""in 1598..."" then it shows the ship, Erasmus from the top but what is it? You see the shadow of the helicopter!!!!!!

The second downside was the ending.
The real man, William Adams died in 1620. The TV series ends in 1600 or so.
I believe there could have been a lot more to that.
That's partly because of the book but I'm sure someone will come up with a sequel, sooner or later.
I didn't like the ending.
The story developed so well, so excellent and perfect and the end came so quickly. It is obvious that it doesn't end there. The ending is of no match with the rest of the series. It is, as if they decided to end it, and said let's stop here.

1902540,5,B0000A2ZNX,"I just watched this again for like the fourth time since it was originally aired in 1980. Most reviewers have covered the basics. Here are my observations:

The 10 hour mini-series actually did justice to this massive and thoroughly epic James Clavell novel. Extremely difficult to pull off, this movie accurately portrayed feudal Japan in ways other movies have not. Filmed entirely in Japan, the look, feel, and setting are outstanding.

The story of course is entirely gripping, as we all identify with the brash, courageous, and profane main character, Pilot John Blackthorne. (Anjin-san, to the Japanese.) This is clearly one of Richard Chamberlain's best roles, as he thoroughly fills the character to the hilt. Rumor has it that Sean Connery was initially selected, but didn't want to do television.

Toshiro Mifune was considered Japan's best motion picture actor, and was very effective as the war-lord, Toranaga.

In my mind, I never liked the casting of the Lords Yaboo and Buntaro. I always envisioned Yaboo as thin and malicious, while Buntaro was more squat and unmovable. I would have reversed those two in this filming. That is about it.

Story is loosely based on an actual Englishman named William Adams, who did indeed become confidante to the Shogun. [...]

Well worth watching. Along with Roots, probably the best mini-series ever produced. It let the story breath and have time to play itself out.",1314057600,,1419,5.068669527896995

1902563,4,B0000A2ZNX,"Shogun shows a time in Japan when it was becoming a nation, and not just separate Warlords.  The movie shows the good with love interests, the cleanliness of the society.  It shows the bad with actions that can have people killed from beheadings, boiling in oil and crucifixion.  The movie teaches some Japanese and a culture that is still partially relevant today in understanding today's Japanese society.

It was also a time of the Catholic Church beginning to have an influence; a time of gaining power and gaining great wealth for the Church through a monopoly on trade with the rest of the world.  The church at that time had both very godly men, and those that were in it for the money and power.  Just like any time in history, including today, there are people that will gain notoriety and power through unscrupulous actions.

Shogun is well written and both entertaining and educational.  I highly recommend it for anyone that is interested in Japanese culture.",1303257600,,971,4.807228915662651

1902568,4,B0000A2ZNX,"Ah yes, a great story chock full of all that American ""made for T.V."" cheesy goodness! I am, however, very disappointed that such a large amount of the footage has been edited out... a detail that I was not aware of before my purchase. I cannot imagine why anyone would decide to include all of the ""behind the scenes"" extras at the expense of the original product.

Still, I would likely have made my purchase all the same and have enjoyed being able to watch this saga again. Despite the opinions of some that the performances of the western actors are less than stellar, I have always found that this quirkiness tends to emphasize the fact that their characters are out of their element - uncomfortable, unprepared and struggling to cope. And I suppose that my expectations are also tempered by the knowledge that this is indeed an American made for T.V. program. Be happy the producer didn't choose Sandy Duncan to play the part of Lady Mariko!

Others here have already given you all the information you need about the program. The simplest recommendation I can give goes something like this: I really enjoy this highly dramatized look at a slice of Japanese history. My wife, on the other hand, is less enthusiastic.

1902571,5,B0000A2ZNX,"Having recently read the book I had to buy this series as soon as possible and I am extremely glad I did. This series follows John Blackthorne who is an Elizabethan ship pilot who gets marooned in Japan and who gets embroiled in a war between samurai lords. He is made samurai and vassal to a Japanese lord and needs to learn about life in Japan quickly as his very life depends on it. There is all of this to the story and SO much more. This boxset has five discs with the series in four parts across four discs and the last disc having all the extras. There is also an excellent booklet with a history of the book and production of the series. This series has the most amazing costumes and film sets and over 3 million of the 23 million budget was spent on these aspects alone. This is very faithful to the book, with nothing added and only a very few minor points omitted. The story isn't compromised in the slightest and if you have enjoyed the book it feels wonderful to immerse yourself back into this world once again. Richard Chamberlain is simply excellent as Blackthorne and Yoko Shimada is also superb as Mariko. The extras include a 13 segment documentary of the making of Shogun, Historical featurettes on Samurai, Tea Ceremony and Geisha, as well as audio commentary on various scenes. This series has all the aspects of the book that I adored so much, samurai honour, romance, a glimpse of feudal Japanese life, betrayal and intrigue, an epic adventure and so much more. You will follow Blackthorne as he develops from a wary and scared foreigner until he reaches the heights of samurai and confidant to his Lord Toranaga. This is a stunning series and gives full justice to the book, the style and effects may be dated now but the story is as gripping as it ever was and I feel it still holds it own against TV productions of today. This cannot be missed and is a series you will watch again and again.

1902575,4,B0000A2ZNX,I saw the series on TV and never liked all the commercial interuptions. When I got the DVD's I was excited and was not disappointed with the movie quality.

1902576,5,B0000A2ZNX,I had forgot how much I loved watching this TV min-series because it was long ago. Then in reviewing DVDs on Japanise samurai I ran across it.

All the Japanese characters speak only Japanese, except for the girl that has to teach the main character to speak it. It is narrated in English in spots so the viewer has some idea what is going on. The scenery is spectacular as well as the period costumes.",1283040000,,383,4.333333333333333
1902589,3,B0000A2ZNX,"...but not this time.  Thirty years ago I couldn't wait for the next installment of Shogun to appear on tv.  Perhaps times have changed, or I've changed, but whatever's changed, thirty years later I wonder why it was so wildly popular.

Frankly, the script was wooden.  After hearing Richard Chamberlain say, ""Thou art beautiful and I love thee!"", or ""Hai, Toranaga-sama!"" for the hundredth time I was about ready to do something more productive... like grab a beer and watch the cars drive by.  The dialogue just came across as stilted; particularly in the interactions between Chamberlain's (Blackthorne/Anjin-san) and Yoko Shimada's (Mariko) characters.

I realized Richard Chamberlain is just not a good actor.  His emotional depth and breadth is very limited.  Granted the role was probably a difficult one to pull off, and he was given some pretty lame lines, but Chamberlain wasn't remotely up to the job.  His facial expressions ran the gamut from A to B: A. Perturbed look... eyes narrowing.  B. Flinty smile.

The interactions between Chamberlain's Anjin-san and the Jesuit priest, Father Alvito, are absurd.  Their relationship see-saws between invective and admiration without any explanation; and the dialogue between them verges on farce.  Curses of, ""You heretic!"" and ""Damn you to hell, priest!""  are interspersed with scenes of gum swapping cordiality.

Another thing: Lord Toranaga (Toshiro Mifune) would perform a bizarre dance before his men in which he'd wave a fan at them while stamping his foot and shouting, ""Heeyit! Heeyit! Heeyit...!""  No explanation was given for this.  One assumes that in some mysterious way it put his samurai into a fighting mood.

Lastly, it would have been nice had English subtitles been used during the Japanese segments to help the viewers sort out some of the action.

The good things about this movie were:

The Japanese actors (especially Toshiro Mifune) who all came across convincingly - at least when compared to the European actors. The sets, which were beautifully done; and the costumes, which were beautifully done.  One qualifier here: the Jesuits in Japan did not wear saffron colored robes, they wore black robes as they always have.

Finally, the director of Photography, Andrew Laszlo, did a fine job - both indoors and outdoors - of capturing the drama and poetry inherent in such a story. In spite of the opening scene with the shadow of the cinematographer's helicopter shading a 16th century ship, IMHO he was the secret star of Shogun.",1281657600,,2509,5.113022113022113
1902590,5,B0000A2ZNX,"This is a great DVD....It's story may be fiction, but it displays one of the best

1902592,5,B0000A2ZNX,The series consists of about 10 hours of actual story content which was as good as I remember when I saw it on Television in about 1980 but without the comercials. I haven't read the book so I have no comparison. Lots of good historical and basic Japanese language information made it an enjoyable experience.,1274313600,,309,4.636363636363637
1902593,5,B0000A2ZNX,"I can think of only one epic series that rivals this, and that is ""Lonesome Dove.""  Both were based upon first-class novels; both were adapted by talented writers; and both were populated by very good actors on extremely realistic sets.

The novel ""Shogun"" is many things:  an adventure story, a romance and a political manual.  All three are retained in the mini-series.  An English captain loses control of his sailinng ship in a storm and lands in ""The Japans,"" in effect, in another world.  It is 1599.  The culture shock stuns him, but when he adapts somewhat he becomes a pupil under the guiding hands of Toranaga, a warlord, Mariko (a beautiful translator) and an army of fierce samurai who are quick to anger and quick to chop off a head.  While denying his political ambitions, Toranaga inexorably maneuvers himself toward ultimate leadership.

The tale is filled with great characters, lots of jeopardy, numerous subplots and magnificent scenery.  This is one mini-series not to be missed.",1273276800,,999,4.963855421686747
1902594,5,B0000A2ZNX,My family was riveted by nightly viewing of each episode. We watched it without sub-titles to get the same experiences that Blackthorne had. We did much fact-checking between each episode since Japanese history was a blank slate for us and we had many debates about whether a westerner could become samauri during this era. As a political history Chamberlain's warrior is much more satisfying to watch than the Tom Cruise treatment of conflicting cultural values.,1272412800,,463,5.1866666666666665
1902595,5,B0000A2ZNX,James Clavelli's Shogun DVD is outstanding.  It feels like I was watching it for the first time. The scenes are really good all around.  The story is classic vintage. Stranger in an unknown land surpasses all obstacles to not only become one of the most powerful but to fall in love at the same time.  I loved the country side scenes and the presentation of culture of the high Damo.  I read the book twice and the DVD follows very closely the story line.

I gave it to my husband for Christmas and he loves it!  He says it is all there and he has been enjoying it since.  I have sat and watched it with him also and have enjoyed the movie.

1902629,4,B0000A2ZNX,"Excellent adaptation of a slightly cheesy novel about an English sea captain who, with his crew in tow, washes up on the shores of Tokugawa era Japan.

Richard Chamberlain plays the part of an indignant English captain surrounded by ""savages"" quite well, and the tempo carries throughout as you, along with the characters, become familiarized with an alien culture that was like none the western world had ever experienced.

NBC exec's made the right call in forgoing subtitles so that you are forced to suffer Chamberlains fate alongside him. It really gives you a great sense of what it must have been like for the non fictional Captain William Adams, the first Englishman to arrive in Japan, and upon whom the story is loosely based. They also did a wonderful job aesthetically recreating the period that was 17th century Japan.

The brilliant casting of Toshiro Mifune as the Shogun apparent really carries this into the realm of great television, and on the strength of Mifune alone this is well worth whatever effort you may put forth in seeing it.

All in all, a great Samurai television series, smartly acted by all involved, and a must see for fans of Samurai culture!",1248393600,,1177,4.840796019900497

1902664,5,B0000A2ZNX,"I saw Shogun on TV when I was in high school and the movie inspired me to read the book. I loved both.

I loved watching Shogun again. Once I start watching it I can't stop. ""The Making of Shogun"" included as an extra on disk five is great.

I do have one major gripe about the packaging.  One reason I love DVD's are the chapters which allow me to quickly find a scene in a movie I really enjoy. While the five DVD's in this set have chapters when inserted into a DVD player, there is no guide on the packaging or in the five DVD set which lists all the chapters in the series. As a result I am forced to put each disk in my DVD player and look at the chapters on my TV screen to see if a particular scene is on the disk.

There are a number of scenes in Shogun I want to watch over and over. I loved when Blackthorne was imprisoned and learns about Japan from the Franciscan priest or the time when Blackthorne saved Toranaga from the earthquake or when he became a samurai. I loved some of the scenes with Mariko. I loved when Rodrigues tried to kill Blackthorne during the typhoon and when Rodrigues visits Blackthorne with the intent to kill him. Since four of the DVD's cover the series (with the fifth being devoted to some nice extras) it is hard to guess which DVD has a scene I want to watch.

It would have cost so little to include a piece of paper with a chapter index for the entire collection. The set is not cheap either.

This is an excellent set, and highly recommended. I have watched these DVD's several times now, and the set wears well. Certainly, it is one of the finest and most faithful adaptations of a book you will ever see.

This DVD set was made from the re-broadcast version.  Compared to the original version, several short, minor scenes have been cut, and voice-over narration added in places.  Take for example the scene in which Lord Toranaga confronts Lord Yabu.  In the original broadcast, there was only a single subtitle at the beginning of the scene: ""Lord Yabu's treachery revealed"".  From the action and the actor's expressions, a viewer immediately can understands what is happening, and in my opinion the word-for-word voice over narration of the actual dialogue detracts more than it adds. I understand that the director's intent originally was for the viewer to experience the scene as Blackthorne with his limited fluency in Japanese would have.

I've been to Japan a number of times since I first saw this series, and I am now amused to understand where and how some scenes were filmed.  The scene in which Blackthorne goes to to Osaka-Jo (castle) was filmed at both Himeji-Jo and Hikone-Jo: the procession enters at Himeji-Jo,  walks under the bridge at Hikone-Jo, then returns to Himeji-Jo. The scene with Blackthorne, Mariko, and Toranaga was filmed at Hikone-Jo.",1234137600,,1538,5.047430830039525

We are fans of James Clavell and have enjoyed reading and then seeing both Noble House and Shogun. Born on October 10th, 1924 under the name of Charles Edmund Dumaresq Clavell, the writer has such eloquent style that reading his works is like living his adventures.

Clavell is the son of a British Royal Navy officer who was stationed in Australia. At the age of 16, he joined the Royal Artillery and was sent to Malaya to fight the Japanese, was captured and sent to a Japanese prisoner of war camp on Java, later transferred to Changi Prison in Singapore. Clavell went through great distress while a prisoner of war in the hands of the Japanese, therefore, when we read his works, we read from the perspective of a man that has lived experiences that have provided depth of humanity in ways unknown to most of us.

With Shogun, he achieves an in-depth and rare look into Japanese culture. If you read the book and watch this series, you end up becoming well versed in the wonders of Japan. It is the story of discovery, of great adventure, of romance, love, a new way to look at relationships and personal growth, for as the character played by Richard Chamberlain, John Blackthorne learns of the ways of Japan, the more he transforms into a new kind of man... no longer English, not necessarily Japanese, but a mixture that bridges two worlds.

The world John Blackthorne discovers surfaces a culture where cruelty was part of daily life, where honor was the key to the lives of Samurai worriers, and where men like Toranaga, masterfully played by one of our favorite actors, Toshiro Mifune, live their lives in search for power and control.

Through an assigned translator and interpreter, Lady Mariko, beautifully played by Yoko Shimada, John Blackthorne learns to love Japan, enjoys forbidden relationships and opens his heart to the transformation into Samurai. He develops a dictionary, English to Japanese that helps eliminate the language barrier.

John Rhys-Davies plays the part of Vasco Rodrigues, a rather colorful individual that will capture your hearts with his interpretation of friend and foe to John Blackthorne.

From watching this series as a family, we inspired Katya to learn more about Japan and even take lessons in Japanese. We got so interested in Japanese culture that we visited The Morikami Museum and Japanese Gardens, [...] in Boca Raton, Florida and attended a festival and the Tea Ceremony.

If you want to experience 10 hours worth of one of the best mini-series ever done, don't miss Shogun, a masterpiece done by Director Jerry London. Too good to miss!!!",1232064000,,2619,4.869662921348315
1902713,3,B0000A2ZNX,"I thought the dvd version (4 dvd's)would be the complete miniseries but I was wrong.  Many of the scenes I remember from the original NBC airing have been cut out.  One is where the samurai in the fish pit with Blackthorn and his crew asks Blackthorn to kill him and, having been refused, tries to kill himself.  That was the first scene that I noticed missing with many more to follow.  Why the hell couldn't they include ALL the scenes in a dvd set?  That's why we buy dvd sets in the first place - to get a complete version and maybe some extras.

I had lived in Japan between Yokohama and Tokyo between 1962 and 1964 on the Tokaido Road, that great ancient highway between Tokyo (Edo) and Kyoto (Miyoko), so during the summer of 1975 as SHOGUN the book released I bought the book and was immediately carried back to the real Nippon or Japan.  Admittedly it was medieval Japan, but it was in action and custom a Japan I could understand. In fact, at Odawara at the foot of Mount Fujiyama and the Hakone Mountains, I several times saw a remaining grey-stone medieval castle identical to the ones in SHOGUN.

For those of you who have never resided in Japan among the everday people, trust in the fact that this movie will bring you very close to the real thing, although several hundred years removed.  The outlawed Samurai era did not completely leave Japan until almost 1900, and though it passed, most of the custom of the Japan I knew was yet controlled by that tradition.  Anywhere one went on the island of Honshu, where SHOGUN has much of its action, Shinto or Buddhist all exhibited its worship of ancestor and military war lord past. Even the 'willow world' in Tokyo yet remained in spirit if not actual locations of Yoshiwara Yukwaku of the Ginza area.

If one has any interest in a very good story and a very good movie then one can do no better than view SHOGUN. The story and the action are both almost seemless. This epic movie truly captures the essence and spirit of medieval Japan as well as some of today.

Wakaru, ""to understand"", is what SHOGUN will aid you in doing.

1902781,5,B0000A2ZNX,"I love japanese history and culture, and this is one of my complete favorites. Im not expert on asian history, nor have i read the book this mini-series is based on, so i review it for what it is.

In brief, this is an great tale of an english man, captain John Blackthorne, who is shipwrecked on the island of japan in the early 17th century, and gets one hell of a culture shock if there ever was one. Eventually he finds himself in the middle of what seems to be a geo-political conflict, secrecy and war, as he trys to just stay sane and stay alive and cope with this ancient yet alltogether new world.

This is just as good as any film made for the theater, but very epic in length. And every hour is great classic entertainment. You'll meet many interesting characters from good,to bad, to the mysterious. A lot of the characters are likable and fasicinating.

The performances are charming and fun. Theres even a good dose of humor through out the parts of the film, which is welcome becouse theres plenty of serious stuff going.

The action is decent, from intense scuffles, assassins in the night, and various battles. Theres no all out massive wars, but theres still enuff sword weilding and explosive events that take place.

The music that accompanies this mini-series is well done, and memorable; the main theme in particular. That youll hear immediatly with the opening credits.

A story filled with adventure, intrique, laughs, and a little romance.
Its lots of fun and even educational, i learned some of my first words in japanese becouse of this film, since there are various scenes where John Blackthorne is given lessons the japanese language. As Blackthorne learned various things, from language to beliefs to way of life, i learned.

The depth of this feature mini-series is rich and just so interesting, nothing im typing does it proper justice. The things John Blackthorne experiences and all the happenings that take place are so indepth that it would take so much longer to type it all out. And im sure this series cant even compare to how wonderfull and utterly deep and vividly lavish and powerfull the book must be.

mythical wealth of ""Cathay"".

Blackthorne will find himself ashored on a totally strange land, where he will witness both the brutality and the utter nobleness of their inhabitants, in an era when Japan is going to change forever through the ferocious winds of civil war, brought by the feudal lords who will dispute
through a time of bloodshed and turmoil, the highest rank of political and military leadership in Japan: Shogun.

Surrounded by hazardous circumstances, political and religious enemies,
John Blackthorne (Richard Chamberlain) will find the true love of his life in the person of beautiful and kind-hearted Lady Mariko-Buntaro (Yoko Shimada), his translator to powerful and impressive Lord Toranaga (Toshiro Mifune), ruler of the Kwanto (nowadays region of Tokyo and adjacent prefectures) and rival to Lord Ishido, ruler of Osaka Castle.

In an expedition that changes his life forever, the foreigner ""with the unpronounceable name"" who is re-named by the Japanese as ""Anjin-san"" (honourable pilot), will climb from being  regarded as a dangerous pirate, to ""Hatamoto"" and ""Samurai"" in a frantic chain of fateful events.

1902829,4,B0000A2ZNX,"In ""Shogun"", everyone of us is invited to the tempting and wonderful world of Japan, one of the few nations never conquered by a foreign power...

We are invited to participate in learning the extraneous but fascinating culture of the Orient... 'Japan is rare and unique,' said James Clavell creator of John Blackthorne, 'Anjin' in Japanese, which means 'pilot.'

Blackthorne (Richard Chamberlain) portrays an Englishman, pilot major of a Dutch fleet, who is shipwrecked on the turbulent waters off the 'Land of the Gods.' England's enemies (aristocratic warlords, British colonial, Portuguese traders, Jesuit missionaries) now await him...

He is caught with his crew by Japanese warriors, and forced to listen as to understand the Japanese language and treatment... The audience - like him - struggles to catch what is going on, as no subtitles in the film...

Blackthorne is surrounded by hundreds of warriors all dressed up with Japanese multicolored wardrobes fastened firmly by an obi (a long wide sash that holds the two swords). We are in presence of samurai, where 'physical courage and prowess are at a premium.'

The English navigator starts a new life far from home, a new transformation of way of living, thinking and acting, from an uncivilized primitive prisoner to a man of strength, honor and courage...

In this epic exposition we see:

- Violent scenes of feudal Japan: Omi (Yuki Meguro) in his first meeting with Blackthorne beheads a man for not bowing in respect to him... Pieterzoon (Edward Peel), a man of Blackthorne's crew, is brought from a pit to be cook alive in a large deep pot... A companion Croocq (Steward MacKenzie) is pulled up from boiling liquid...

- Intricate and complicated political plots: When Ferriera (Vladek Sheybal), a Portuguese trader, in the presence of Father dell'aqua (Alan Badel) gives Toranaga (Toshiro Mifune) and Mariko (Yoko Shimada) protection on the Black ship in return for the Englishman... When Rodrigues (John Rhys-Davies) has been overboarded... When the Ninja warriors attack Osaka Castle...

- Dramatic scenes: Blackthorne's intend to commit seppuku... Mariko's seppuku frightening scene... When a disgraced warrior Yabu (Frankie Sakai) commits instant seppuku (hara-kiri).

- Amusing moments: Blackthorne in his first Japanese bath in Anjiro... When he teach Toranaga the lively steps of the hornpipe... When he begins his 'mad dance' moving up and down in order to permit Toranaga escape from Osaka Castle...

- Cultural exposition of the traditional Japanese woman: Her moods and feelings, her emotions, her reactions... Mariko badly beaten by her husband... Mariko treatments so affectionate, sweet and loving... Mariko's bath scene... Her risky love affair...

- Best moment of the whole mini series: Blackthorne becomes a samurai!

Filmed in epic proportions, with breathtaking cinematography, super acting, and great special effects (few arrow-in-the-chest scenes; the burning of 'The Erasmus;' the earthquake), this full-length version of ""Shogun"" is fair to James Clavell's colorful best-seller...

The Jesuits (Friar Domingo, Father Sebastio, Father dell'Aqua, Father Alvito) are interpreters, writers of the first Japanese dictionary, who all share the commerce of silk between Japan and China...

Richard Chamberlain appears fervently with noble ambition, firm and dominate as the Westerner who is taken by force as a prisoner, who hates his captors, but little by little is seduced by their culture...

Toshiro Mifune performs with great dignity a powerful legendary figure who unifies several political factions into one nation under his authority as Japan's first Shogun!

John Rhys-Davies plays Rodrigues, the Portuguese pilot, with a big sense of humor...

Yoko Shimada (Mariko) is the 'perfect vision.' a woman of great beauty and rarity, delicate and fragile, a true precious jewel of the Orient!",1168646400,,3883,5.43261231281198

1902841,5,B0000A2ZNX,"Making a mini-series  out of James Clavell's historic and highly intricate novel Shogun was an ambitious and groundbreaking undertaking that hasn't stopped fascinating audiences all over the  world since it was first broadcast in 1980. The fictionalized story, entirely filmed on location,  takes place in Japan  and tells us through the eyes of English sailor John Blackthorne, shipwrecked on the shores of the Japans,  the power struggle between several feudal lords and between these and the Jesuits. Together with Blackthorne we discover early 17th century Japan,  with him we progressively gain an understanding of the Japanese people and their culture, like him we are torn between the loyalty towards lord Toronaga and the wish to return to open seas and capture the Portuguese Black Ship,  we also fall in love with Mariko, his beautiful married interpreter, we share his despair to be stripped from his ship the Erasmus and we are proud when he is granted the status of  samurai and hatamoto .

No one could have personified Blackthorne  better than Richard Chamberlain. He IS Blackthorne, true to his huge talent and his magic capacity to fade into the character he is interpreting. Richard Chamberlain carries the whole complex production on his shoulders, he is practically in every scene,  not only in dialog with other characters but also without uttering a word, he drives the story thus making the audience understand what is going on and what are his nuanced feelings. A tour de force charismatic Richard Chamberlain carries out brilliantly. Moreover he is intensely dramatic and emotional in the seppuku scene,  funny and touching in the sailor's dance, staggeringly mad in the escape scene, wonderfully romantic as Mariko's lover and with unmatched  class and  elegance wearing the silk kimonos.

 The whole cast is splendid.  The actors who play the Jesuits and the crew of the Erasmus, are beautifully cast, all out of English theatre. To quote but a few :  Damien Thomas, Alan Badel, Michael Hordern, John Rhys-Davies. John Rhys-Davies  plays the part of the pilot of the Black Ship with tremendous energy and gusto that some consider exaggerated. Not in my opinion, his acting is very useful in the sense that it underlines Blackthorne's composed and reflexive nature.  The same has to be said of the Japanese actors, the mythical Toshira Mifune, Yoko Shimada, Frankie Sakai, Yuki Meguro, Hideo Takamatsu, all sensational,  with incredible presence.

The fact that Shogun was entirely shot in Japan grants  the mini-series the stamp of  authenticity, further stressed by the resort to Japanese  without dubbing.  The sets, made by Japanese craftsmen following century old traditions,  are magnificent not to speak of the quality of the light and photography as well as of the music by Maurice Jarre.  Jerry London, the director, and Eric Bercovici,  both  script writer and executive producer, supported by the cast and crew,  have crafted a masterpiece.  The filming of Shogun was a ""wonderful nightmare""  recalls Richard  Chamberlain . To  enjoy this excellent and spectacular mini-series and to know more about its making watch the five DVDs including a documentary on the making of Shogun .",1167436800,,3217,5.1686046511627906

1902849,5,B0000A2ZNX,"Hmmm, now I understand what it was all about... well at least sort of... the television miniseries of James Clavell's Shogun was a bit of a television landmark, lots of hype and everybody warned about its horrific portrayal of ancient Japanese suicide, hari-kari, also know to the Samurai as `The Fine Art of Seppuku', is somewhat tame by today's television standards, but still unnerving all the same, and in the early 1980s it certainly got everyone talking and awaiting to tune into the next episode, here is the complete series on four DVDs, two episodes per disc, eight episodes in length, plus a bonus material fifth DVD, make up an interesting package that is worthy of any DVD television series hobby collection. Although somewhat slow paced in parts, sometimes accompanied by hammy acting from the Western folks involved, probably underscored by the remarkably good Japanese acting, relives the traditions of the Japans in the 1600s, and is the main reason why you probably want to see it. Although the story is rather limited for the running time - English pilot marooned on the Japans, falls in love with a local Japanese woman and stirs up the hornets nest - it is not really the tale or Richard Chamberlain's Pilot-Major John Blackthorne / Anjin-san character who drives the show, but the whole Japanese culture on display and this is first rate stuff. Throwing in a few ninjas also heightens its validity as one of the best historical dramas aired on television. However it does show its age because of the impact of modern Asian cinema and better subtitle translation standards, speaking of which, Shogun completely avoids, with long dialogue sequences in Japanese without any English subtitles, to present the audience with a more vivid Japanese presence. Yes, this is certainly very good entertainment for a couple to watch in the evening when the kids are asleep.

1902864,4,B0000A2ZNX,"First let me say that I agree with the good reviews given about this mini series.  There were just a few things that they could have done to really make this great.  First off was the transfer to DVD wasn't digital so in some shots there's a bit of a grainy quality.  Which is a little distracting when there truely are so many great shots.

The only other complaints I have is about the original filming.  I don't understand why a film made for American TV has so much Japanese spoken without sub-titles.  I mean that when there wasn't one of the characters acting as an interpreter there was often a great deal of dialog spoken with no understanding of what was said.  Granted we eventually get the ghist of what was said, but personally I like to know what's being said if it was in the script.  It would have helped those of us who didn't read the book to get a better understanding of what all was going on.  On the DVD I thought that maybe they would have them included if you select English sub-titles, but there's nothing written when they speak Japanese.

The only other problem was again with the original movie as a mini-series.  Even though most of the movie is a good strong story that really moves along there are some segments that slow things down so much that I'm thinking they were left in to fill the amount of time alloted.

None the less this is a good DVD set, but I'd check to see if they release another addition in digital.",1140566400,,1448,4.342007434944238

It's an excellent movie, beautiful locations, wonderful story, etc. But what a DVD transfer!!! The video quality is so good, I forgot that the TV miniseries from filmed in 1980. Of course it's not widescreen as they never shot TV films in that format back them, but the colors are vibrant and image is overall clean and sharp. I was very surprised. You only see some spots and grain when they transition between scenes but that's okay with me. Considering the audio is in Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound, this is a sweet DVD collection. Now, if only such teleplays as LONESOME DOVE, CHIEFS and the 1984 A CHRISTMAS CAROL (with George C Scott) would receive the same treatment.",1136764800,,789,4.642857142857143
1902869,3,B0000A2ZNX,"I received the DVD set of Shogun for Christmas.  A nice present since I've wanted to see it again ever since it first aired.

However, like a previous reviewer, I found it frustrating that almost 1/3 of the original mini-series is missing, and I think that the description of it on several sites as the ""complete"" mini-series is at best misleading and at worst in contravention of trading standards.  Some of the most memorable parts of the original are entirely absent, including the demonstration of the the Musket Regiment in action, and Mariko's group's attempt to fight their way out of Osaka Castle before she threatens to commit seppuku, as well as more homely sequences such as Blackthorne teaching Mariko and Toranaga to dive head first from the galley.

A previous reviewer notes the lack of action sequences, and this is part of the reason...several have been cut out.

The same reviewer mentions that Blackthorne lapses into ""thee"" and ""thou"" speech inappropriately.  Again, that's explained in a cut section: when Blackthorne and Mariko speak in ""normal"" speech they're supposed to be speaking Portuguese, but they both also speak Latin, and use that as a private tongue since some samurai who've had contact with Portuguese sailors speak their language, whereas only the priests speak Latin.

Overall, good, but I would have given it 5 stars if it really had been the complete mini-series.  Two more disks would have covered it, so why wasn't it issued complete?",1135555200,,1476,4.995918367346939

The movie consists of five discs and is 9 hours long. It is  fascinating (thanks especially to the closed captions).

I recommend it to anyone who enjoys stories of Love and War set against spectacular backgrounds, e.g., feudal Japan at the beginning of the 17th century.",1124755200,,495,5.08641975308642
1902896,5,B0000A2ZNX,"I wanted this set for a long time, then once I finally got, it sat on my shelf because watching it takes commitment. Finally, I invested the time, and it was worth it. I stayed up well past my bedtime every night to watch it, it is riveting and timeless. I suspect it requires at least a modicum of intelligence and worldliness to be approachable. That said, I was not bored even for a moment during the entire 9:07.

I concur with those who say Chamberlain was the weakest, unless you consider minor characters, because the sailors from the Erasmus were *lame*. Chamberlain's Blackthorne didn't suffer because of the actor, however, it was the dialogue. He speaks normally, except when wooing Mariko, when he falls into thees, thous and thines. It is grating to hear, especially when the timing is completely inappropriate, like during a troop march. There are times when he is faced with a situation, and it is clear what a prudent man would say. Then, he says the opposite. You are left thinking, ""are you stupid or something?"" But it eventually becomes clear that karma truly is on his side. Even though he never establishes himself as particularly bright or cunning, he succeeds. That might be a flaw in the story. He gets to spout off, but no one lops off his head as they would of a native.

I was surprised there wasn't more battle, there really isn't any, just references to battles. But this isn't a war movie, and there are enough ninjas to hold up that aspect. It is odd that Blackthorne seems to be such a mighty swordsman, though he is from the era of the gun in the west. If samurai trained the way western squires did in the Middle Ages, Blackthorne would have been outclassed immediately. I would expect more contempt from true samurai, such as that shown by Lord Bultano (sp?), the yeoman. The picture does not really make clear whether samurai is a title earned through training, or just handed out to fighters, because there are many, many samurai in the story. Perhaps it was easier to just have all samurai than to also have ashigaru, since again, this was not about war. So there are some holes in the story, but were there not, this could easily have been twice as long.

My gripes are minor. The scope and depth of the story are simply awesome. The sets are well-done, the variety of events is great, and the story takes you on a wild ride, with enough of the unexpected to please without getting ridiculous. Many of the actors were perfect in their roles, such as those who played Toranaga, the Portuguese Blackship captain, Yabu and Omi. I will enjoy watching it again.",1123718400,,2596,4.578494623655914

1902899,5,B0000A2ZNX,"Even after 25 years since its original release, the 10-hour adaptation of James Clavell's 'Shogun' is as good as ever with a great screenplay and direction carefully revised and supervised by the author himself. The lavish production is further supported by an excellent cast of American and Japanese actors.

Chamberlain is John Blackthorne, a 17th-century English captain of a Dutch trading vessel that found itself run ashore on the coast of feudal Japan. Blackthorne soon finds himself in the middle of a war between two samurai warlords struggling for dominion of the island kingdom.  Although initially suspicious of him, Blackthorne is soon appreciated by Toranaga (Toshiro Mifune) who takes him as a confidant to help him against his rival, Ishido: having much use for a man who knows a lot about war ships, fire arms, and many other things Japan might otherwise need from the West.  Although initially overwhelmed by culture shock, Blackthorne soon becomes as Japanes as can be with the help of his patron and the beautiful Lady Mariko (Yoko Shimada.)  Despite his rapid learning and loyalty to the new Shogun, Blackthorne is still a foreigner who is unaccustomed to the subtle and rigid customs of of his host country; he also realizes that this island will forever be his prison.

This is an excellent mini-series with a good screenplay, great direction, a lavish production, and a great cast.  Chamberlain performs his manly role as a hardy sailor quite well despite his being a dandy in real life: all the marks of a good actor.  This is a great mini-series to rent or own which the whole family can watch.",1115078400,,1619,4.930147058823529

In Japan Blackthorne is confronted by a culture strange to him and Portuguese traders and priests who have monopolized trade with the Japan's because of their heretofore secret passage through the Straits.  Blackthorne finds himself thrust into the middle of a political struggle that works against him staying alive, much less getting back home.  There's plenty of politics, intrigue, and romance here and you'll find that owning the DVD you're like to watch the entire 10-hour show without much break in-between.",1114473600,,794,5.038167938931298

Surprisingly, all of these have dated extremely well, mostly because they are all epic, memorable stories from a different era; but also because they are all well-made films with talented actors and huge budgets.  ""Shogun"" is perhaps the most expensive of the three boasting detailed sets, lavish costuming, and a large cast of extras.  There are many notable performaces in the show, the acting all around being very good.  The best part of the show is actually what is missing:  subtitles.  Having a show with so much spoken Japanese would normally demand subtitles, but the creators manage to do without with the use of characters translating and/or the voice of Orson Welles chiming in narrating over the more complex sequences.  Subtitles would take away from relating to the main character who is a stranger in a strange land that gradually picks up on phrases as he explores their culture.  This is indeed an expensive production, but the DVD is also very expensive.  If you are like me and your heart is set on seeing this show then go ahead and spend the cash, but ""The Thorn Birds"" is just as epic and lengthy and is half the price.  Both mini-series are worth obtaining, and the packaging for ""Shogun"" is handsome and the extra features on the final disc are entertaining and enlightening.",1111276800,,1432,4.827868852459017

Stranded there, he gets entangled in the shady factional politics of Medieval Japan, while becoming accustomed to the culture and traditions of the ""Land of the Rising Sun.""

The film combines romance, drama, action and adventure making it one of the best of its kind!

Moreover, the clash between the Dutch/England and Spain/Portugal is as fascinating as the conflict between Protestantism and Catholicism, and both are presented very well in the film.

The plot is extraordinary and opens a window into the mysterious Orient.

Furthermore, shot on location it provides for some amazing scenery.

Needless to say, Richard Chamberlain, Hiromi Senno, Toshiro Mifune, John-Rhys Davies, and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least, especially Hiromi Senno's character who as Fujiko, steals the show!

The actors' great talent and chemistry clearly shows, thus providing an entertaining film that can be watched over and over again.

I am sure you will love the story and the historical details that are given to you as a cultural present.",1099267200,,439,3.8351648351648353
1902918,5,B0000A2ZNX,"I am not sure how I should start?  I suppose I suggest you read the book first before you watch (...and probably have to buy) the movie.  It is dated and certainly not up to the current standards of special effects that we see in the movies today.  But what it lacks in that category it spills over in abundance with acting and just beauty.  This was not an action film.  It was a drama about a mans transformation and how he adapted to an entirely foreign land.  And it was about a women of the highest nobility in Japan and how she came to love such a foreign man. He was a Barbarian to her at first, a man to be despised and reviled.  At first she thought him a liar and his thoughts and ways revolting. Later she came to understand him, his ways, his honor and compassion, his unpredicability,  his incredible knowledge and mind, his bravery and courage and most importantly his love for her. She knew in her heart of hearts, he was Samarui and a man she would forever love.

The movie does not do the book justice, but Yoko Shimada is (or was I guess) one of the most beautiful actresses you will find in a movie.  Indeed, the costumes were so beautiful.  If I were an actor or actress in that movie, that would have been in my contract (that I get to keep the kimono's that I wear).  They were absolutely stunning.  The movie is worth watching just for the beauty of the costumes.  Yoko Shimada - The Lady Toda Buntaro Mariko, in her pink kimono's was the picture of beauty, much like the godess Aphrodite or perhaps like the Mona Lisa.  But in the book you will read and come to understand that she was so much more than that.  A wonderfully talented, intelligent, gifted, courages and brave women, not to mention beautiful.  How could any man not want a women like her?  Her husband did, but did not, such a fool! Blackthorne came to love her on a plane of love that I think only few of us ever experience. I am saddened to have to say that.  We should all be so fortunate to experience such spiritual love!  Their bodies were not just one, but their entire conscience, and their souls  became eternally bonded.  They became one in body and soul.  Who could ask for more in life?

One of the things you won't notice probably on first viewing of the film is Yoko Shimada's blemishes (pimples). I didn't the first time I watched the movie but I do now. It is actually realistic.  Such a beautiful women, who also had problems with her complexion at times. The makeup artists did a wonderful job of making them more or less transparent, but it was to me a reality of life and one that was nicely left in the movie.  It made it seem so much more real.

I bought this movie because I liked the book so much and because you can't find it in a rental store as far as I can tell.  The movie is different from the book but I think you will thoroughly enjoy the acting and the film, although it strays somewhat from the book in theme and in the various plots. Both Shimada and Chamberlain won best actress and actor awards, and the film best TV mini series, and more I think.  There are some scenes in the movie that I particularly like.  The romantic scenes for one were just so captivating.  Yoko Shimada as the Lady Toda is just so seductive and beguiling.  Her eyes just enticed me and I wish they had been meant for me! I fell hopelessly in love with her when I watched this movie and those scenes although there was no nudity, just dialogue.  But there are other stirring scenes throughout the movie (the 4 DVD discs) that make this movie worth watching. The one in particular was when Blackthorne was officially made Samurai and Hatamoto, Admiral of Toranagas fleet and given incredible wealth, a Lordship actually, a fief and just unbelievable gifts.  This was done in front of hundreds of Toranaga's officers, not just Samurai.  You don't quite understand the significance of this in the movie unless you have read the book, because the movie did not indicate that.

I was in the navy at the time this movie aired, an officer on submarines.  Yoko Shimada and I are the same age.  I wish I could have met her back then!!!  I know so well the loneliness that can overcome you while out at sea.  I never watched TV back then or read much fiction, only science fiction and fantasy when I had the time.  For many years I have not watched TV, except for the news.  I only know of this movie because of the reviews about the book on Amazon.com and I happened to have the book in my library, a gift from a friend many years ago.  I loved reading the book (recently) so I decided to buy the movie. If I had seen the movie back then, in 1980,  I would have taken 60 days leave, hopped the first military flight from Norfolk, VA ( when I returned to port, which was seldom, hehe)to Tokyo, or wherever Yoko might have been in Japan in the hopes that she was not married, and hope that I might get a date with her hehe :) To me she is just that beautiful ( and my guess is she still is). And also to experience the beauty that is Japan.  I was an east coast, North Atlantic, Artic and Mediterranean sailor, and a few other spots, hehe :).  Europe is beautiful though and I loved my leave when I was there.  I saw such wonders.  Despite most movies and books I guess, sailors are not just about debauchery, we do love culture too. I never was on the west coast.  I wish now I had been on the west coast sailing.  Although nuclear submarines are not allowed in Japanese ports it would have been an easy hop from the Phillipines to anywhere in Japan.

If you like a fantastic tale, and beautiful costumes and wonderful acting, you will love this movie.  You won't find much better acting than the Japanese actors in this film. I really got a kick out of Captain Yoshinaka, and you will understand if you watch the film :) I suggest you read the book first.  Even though the movie is different in some of the tale, you will appreciate having read the book before you watch this movie.  Enjoy it for its beauty, as I do.",1094428800,,6009,4.289520426287744
1902919,5,B0000A2ZNX,"I am hard pressed to write any better reviews than what I have read, and I don't think I will try. So many other people have done such a marvelous job of describing the movie I would surely fall well short of their prose. I do feel compelled to discuss the movie though and give you my thoughts, because I just fell in love with it, much like the film Casablanca. As others, I think this is the best mini-series I have watched. The story line of the movie was quite different from the book, and at first I found that disturbing, but the second time I watched it I found myself captivated by the story, the majesty, the acting, the beauty of Yuko Shimoto (the Lady Toda Mariko Buntaro), and a portion of the ending that I thought was fit for the way the story was adapted and written for TV. This being when Blackthorne gave to Omi-san the most precious gift he could give him. Omi was a man whom he had originally hated and despised beyond measure, but had come to respect and call friend in the end.

 Yes, I fell in love with Mariko-san in the book, and most assuredly in the movie. What man, who prefers to be with a woman, could not love such a wonderous, intelligent and most beautiful and pristine woman, neh? hehe The second bedroom scene ( first day out of Yokese) between Blackthorne and Mariko I think is the most romantic scene I have seen in the movies. There was no nudity, or obvious physical bonding, just a dialogue and a look that proved that their love was on a spiritual plane, not just pillowing, as the book called it, the physical bonding of a man and woman. They were as soul mates, much like the movie ""Serendipity"", which I like immensely. The look on Yuko Shimodo's face was so radiant, and her eyes so beguiling. Such a beautiful and wonderful actress for this role. Who could not love her, neh? I would think anyone watching it would feel the sensuality and spiritual bonding that Clavell tried to covey and did in such a beautiful way in the book, as well as the movie.

 I have read much about Chamberlain's acting in this role. It could have been better I think. I have thought allot about who would be better at that period of time to act in the role, but I can't think of anyone. The only two that come to mind in recent times are James Caviezel because I liked him so much in the role of the ""The Count of Monte Cristo"" (that movie being a complete rewrite of the book, which was a shame in my opinion). The other being Daniel Day-Lewis, who I thought was fabulous in the movie, ""Last of the Mohicans"". I think each would make a better Blackthorne, but this is 24 years later, hehe. And now I just remembered that Chamberlain also played the role of the Count in an earlier version of the classic. I guess maybe the casting people see the same type of man in the role of Blackthorne. I think they did a marvelous job nonetheless.

 A few words on the characters. We all get caught up in the majesty of the time. It was a feudal period in Japans history, and this story is about the priviledged minority: a very small minority. The lady Toda for instance is, according to the book, the 4th most highly revered woman in Japan. It is so easy to get caught up in that kind of pagentry as we read about it and get lost in the book as we become one with the characters, or also watch the movie and do the same. I am reminded of a scene from ""History of the World II"" where Mel Brookes removes his head from the buxom bosom of a fair damesel and proclaims, ""IT IS GOOD TO BE KING"", hehe. Certainly this movie and the book make that statement so true. I don't think I would like living in feudal Japan as a peasant, or eta. I am certain I would love to have lived there as a lord though, just as Pilot Major John Blackthorne, Anjin-san: Samurai, Hatamoto, Admiral of the Fleet and most highly regarded confidant, vassal and friend to his liege lord, Toranaga-sama, the Shogun (the military ruler of all Japan).

 I hope you have enjoyed my thoughts. I hope you watch the movie, but more importantly, read the book. The book is, as always, so much better.

 I highly recommend this movie and of course the book to anyone who loves to learn and read and loves a good story. It is one of the most captivating stories I have read. I learned allot of Japanese from the book, as well as the movie too. That was a plus. By the way, Blackthorne could speak fluently in 5 languages, and he was learning Japanese, the 6th. Lady Toda could speak 3. That did not come out in the movie. A few extra hours in the series could have made so many behind the scenes intrigue and knowledge of the characters become apparent. Oh well, so sorry! :)",1091404800,,4653,4.277272727272727
1902920,3,B0000A2ZNX,"I have waited for years to get my hands on a DVD version of Shogun.  I wanted the VHS set, but it was toooo pricy and so I waited.  With much joy I managed to save enough money to get the mini-series on DVD and watched it immediately.
  Imagine my dismay when I sat wondering where whole scenes were.  Please bear in mind that I watched this series ONE time, when it first aired, and it stuck with me in many ways in spite of the fact that I was only 10 years old. So much is missing that it really upset me.  What has been cut, you ask?  Well, there was a scene where Blackthorne talks to Alveto about wearing Orange instead of Black garb, a scene where we learn that Anjin does not mean ""pilot"", but Captain, and that he'd better let them think himself to be the captain, and the great love scene complete with nudity (YES, in case you don't believe me my local television station DID air the version with nudity.  I recall it very vividly as it was the first time I had seen a naked lady, and my grandmother, whom I was staying with, pitched a fit that they'd show stuff like that on TV.).  There are other small scenes missing, but those were the ones that really struck me.  Also, there is a very distinct lack of special features for a 5th disc. I would have liked to see the variant scenes they filmed for the trimmed down version.
  Overall the tale is a great one, and I reccomend the series, but as DVD sets go this one is a major let down for me.",1089331200,,1457,4.109540636042403

1902924,5,B0000A2ZNX,"One of he best things on TV ever. A phenomenon when it first aired in the 80s, the production value is still unparalleled. This extraordinary mini series about japan that was shot in japan with japanese actors and, somewhat frustratingly (but intentionally so), with lots of real japanese dialog. Chamberlain is the only reasons this piece is not one of televisions best moments ever. He is so outclassed by the rest of the fantastic cast and must overacts all the time.
The series' depiction of the culture of the time is accurate and in a way can save you feudal japan 101. The constant suicides everywhere might seem overdone or even silly, but are actually quite in keeping with the times depicted. Visit one of the actual castles in japan and you will find a rediculous selfslaughterfest among some of its regal inhabitants (if a lord kills himself a good dozen woman around him do the same and there are many ""goodbye"" poems on display, ah there is so much our culture could learn...). I found this knowledged made the series more enjoyable to watch, knowing that this was very real and giving some insights into the origins of this behaviour.
So much has been said about the movie I only want to add that this is a shortened version of the original 12.5 hour piece. This is very frustrating, because having additional material never shown on tv (the great american fear of nipples)seems ideal for dvd releases. If ever there was an opportunity for added value dvd this was it. That is why I gave only 3 stars, well and Chamberlain.",1081296000,,1538,4.658088235294118
1902925,4,B0000A2ZNX,"This is recommended for those who have an interest in feudal Japan.  Those looking for an action-packed samurai epic may want to stick with the way-too-Hollywood ""The Last Samurai"".  This is a thinking man's epic; character driven, full of political intrigue (though not nearly as much as the book), and filled with rich details that really transport you to that period in time. As great as it is to see such an excellent book done such justice, the film is flawed. Richard Chamberlain gives an often Charleton Heston-esque performance (not really a bad thing) but delivers some unintentionally hilarious lines (to his ship caught in a storm and about to crash into a reef: ""Turn you whore from hell, TUUUUURRRRN!"").  Rather than have subtitles for the few scenes where Japanese characters meet and speak amongst each others, we have annoying voice-overs (delivered by Orson Welles, no less) describing the conversation.  Cheesy.  Also, much of the political aspect of the story was simply cut out to make room for more Blackthorne and Mariko. Lastly, for a story about samurai that was already starving for action to actually have several battle scenes shortened or entirely cut out was unforgiveable. Yabu's duel with Blackthorne's retainer and the battle at Ishido's castle as Mariko tries to leave would have been awesome to see, but are simply skipped.  Don't worry though, the ninja attack is entirely intact and the highlight of the mini-series. Most of the action we do get to see is very brief and without any excitement or flair; this is where a little Hollywood touch might have helped.  Thankfully, the action is far from the main reason to watch.  This is a STORY.  It's got romance, drama, comedy,and much more.  John Rhys-Davies (that's Gimli for you LOTR fans) steals every scene he's in as Blackthorne's friend/rival pilot Rodriguez and Toshiro Mifune is absolutely flawless as Toranaga. The disc of extras is a happy bonus.  It's full of interesting observations from cast and crew and offers a lot of insight into the making of the film and the impact it had when it originally aired.  I prefer the book and with this mini-series clocking in at 8+ hours, it might take you less time to read the book. But know that this DVD collection does it justice and that is a rare thing these days.  If you have a genuine interest in Japanese culture and thought ""The Last Samurai"" was too Hollywood, this is a must-buy.",1079654400,,2428,4.849878934624697
1902926,3,B0000A2ZNX,"I remember reading the book a couple of years back but can't seem to recall the actual ending ...was there a great battle
between TORANAGA and ISHIDO's forces leading to the climactic finale of TORANAGA being SHOGUN ?

If you are to see this film for the first time , then surely you'd be at the edge of your seat ( in  anticipation of a huge and climactic battle) . The first 3 discs , yes ! But as soon as you see the fourth disc winding down to the last few minutes of the last chapter , I would not be surprised if you end up asking yourself ...""Is that it ?"" ,  ""What happened ?"" ""Where's the rest of the stuff , damn , I think I got ripped off by 'em DVD store"". Probably , I got used to watching all those big WAR films , I kinda expected too much from this one.
The makers of the film intended to tell the story from Blackthorne's view (thus the lack of english subtitle for those japanese dialogues). This I find confusing really , the fact that they focused to much on Blackthorne's character rather than the actual story of the book which really is about the imminent war between the ruling warlords of Japan during that time ,and an eventual winnner ,thus the title SHOGUN. Blackthorne's character ( I believe) ,was more of a coincidental witness to that eventful era in Ancient Japan. His character should have been more of a storyteller , rather than his character ,being the
beginning and the ending story. This should have allowed the film makers to come up with a complete film. You get this feeling
that there really was no ending .
Nevertheless, the historical value of the film cannot be discounted .The film was successfull in conveying Japan's
regard for honor and dignity. This film was a window to an ancient past , and we are a lucky generation to have been a witness to such a classic film.
Overall, I would give it a 3 star rating . This is one film that deserves a remake , one that should be shown in the
big screen. This should give the (overrated) Lord of the Rings a run for it's money.",1078617600,,2018,4.277486910994765
1902927,5,B0000A2ZNX,"Paramount was generous enough to transfer the classic TV mini-series to DVD. It could be seen as a risk since something this broad and expansive will not hold the attention of all audiences. Even with compression technology of the DVD format the movie still runs through four discs with a supplementary fifth disc. It is certainly a whole lot better than...what, ten VHS cassettes? That is a little trite.
First, the story. James Clavell's book Shogun is an all-time classic with many plots with multiple characters, not just the seemingly ""main character"" Major Pilot John Blackthorne. The book covers a lot of ground that the movie epic amazingly does not have the time to reveal. If that does not say something about the complexity of the story, nothing will. The movie basically tries to mostly cover Blackthorne's adventure through the Japans, with additional focus on the machinations of the Jesuit 'enemy'.
The transfer to DVD wasn't perfect but the source film is a little dated and grainy but the picture quality definitely passable. No major complaints and I appreciate the effort by Paramount to improve the image. The dialog sound is also not perfect but it does not degrade the experience. I only have one complaint, however tedious. The music is mixed slightly too high as compared to the dialog. The effort to keep turning the volume up and down between music and speaking does compromise the DVD production, but it shouldn't count against the movie.
The casting for the movie is spot on for the most part. Chamberlain is believable as Blackthorne, and no one else cast at that time would've come close. The legendary Toshiro Minfune reveled in his role as the calculating Yoshi Toranaga. Damien Thomas is exactly how I imagined Father Alvito looked and acted while reading the novel. Yoko Shimada spoke with class and elegance as Mariko Buntaro. And John Rhys-Davies (yes, Gimli of the Lord of the Rings) gave a rolicking performance as the Spanish Pilot Rodrigues caught up in choice of friendship and duty.
So, once again, a giant ""arigato gozaimash'te"" to Paramount for the DVD version to the movie production of one of the most intriguing novels ever. It is a commercial gamble to reach the 'big audience' of today, but I'm glad the true fans of this epic were not forgotten.",1078185600,,2295,4.887179487179488

My loss, I guess, but they never should have priced those VHS tapes as high as they did (although the little booklet that came in the black box was kind of nice).
The DVD transfer was done well.  Far superior to the tapes, and much improved sound.  It really enhances the experience of watching this miniseries; the film really fills up the screen nicely and is definitely ""high end"" viewing that is better than many motion pictures.
The DVD extras are also nice.  In addition to a ""making of"" documentary (with interviews of much of the surviving cast), the DVD's include scholarly analyses of feudal and contemporary Japanese society.  There's definitely a Hawaii flavor to these DVD's, which is, of course, understandable.
""Shogun"" was really my first introduction to Japanese culture.  I've learned much since, but looking back, I'm pleasantly surprised that this miniseries works as well as it did and does.

This is the same version that recently aired on the Hallmark channel far as I can tell.
Just a comment about the previous review on ""bad Japanese by Westerners.""  The character Rodrigues (John Rhys-Davies) SHOULD be speaking bad Japanese. It shows his disdain for the culture in general and demonstates his ethnocentric outlook.  Same reason he calls them monkeys and toadies. Yes, some of the Jesuit priests speak it poorly, Father Alvito should have a more natural accent having grown up in Japan but the actor does a good job.",1066867200,,807,4.776978417266187
1902941,2,B0000A2ZNX,"Shogun is a disappointment.  There is some entertainment value in seeing feudal Japan brought to life in an American miniseries, but as with a dog walking on its hind legs, it's impressive not because it is done well, but because it is done at all.
Throughout Shogun, the limited budget of a TV production is evident.  An opening scene with a ship weathering a storm includes shots of an obvious set with ""rain"" being splashed on it.  Later on, an ""earthquake"" is created by shaking the camera and having a few dusty trenches cave in.
But Shogun's worst, most unforgivable sin is its ending.  Without giving away spoliers, I can say that this entire mammoth miniseries builds to a climactic battle between two samurai armies, and then when that point is reached, the battle is NOT EVEN SHOWN.  Instead, we get Orson Welles narrating that the battle was really exciting, take his word for it.  Thanks, Orson, but I wanted to see the clashing armies, not just hear you tell me it happened.  Similarly, an attack by Blackthorne's ship on the Jesuit's ""Black Ship"" is constantly talked about and forshadowed... but never happens.  Moreover, the ending fails to provide any sort of meaningful resolution for the main character, Blackthorne, who is left thinking he'll succeed in a plan that we learn is doomed to failure.
We learn that because Orson Welles doesn't just narrate, he also speaks the Japanese characters' thoughts and repeats their dialogue in English.  Instead of subtitles, sometimes you'll hear two Japanese actors talking to each other, and then their voices fade down and Orson starts telling you what they're saying to each other.  A jarring effect, and unnecessary -- subtitles would have been better.  But even if subtitles had been used, the viewer, after investing hours of his time in this story, would still be left feeling cheated by its failure to have any kind of dramatic payoff.
Another flaw is the poor Japanese spoken by some of the Western actors.  While Richard Chamberlain's Blackthorne is supposed to be learning the language, others like John Rhys-Davies' Rodrigues should speak it better than they do.  It is so bad that it becomes distracting and had me laughing at the screen,
Shogun is frustrating because the potential for a more interesting story was there.  But after setting up a complex scenario with Jesuits, Toranaga, Ishido, and Blackthorne and his crew all competing for advantage, Shogun spectactuarly fails to deliver.
Shogun is at least packaged well as a DVD set.  The first four discs contain the main feature, and fifth disc includes a fairly interesting ""making of"" documentary.  It's just a shame Shogun itself isn't more thrilling.",1066262400,,2686,4.962053571428571

1902966,5,B0000A2ZNX,"When I was ... very young I saw Shogun when it first aired on TV, and haven't seen it since until the release of the DVDs (I did see the 2.5 hour version - I will never speak of THAT again). In the intervening decades I read the book about 5 times.
  I rate these DVD 5 stars because you will have a very hard time finding a better entertainment value for your money.  This show was fantastic.  The storyline (which I will not repeat) is complex and fascinating, and the miniseries does it justice.  The acting is superb - my personal opinion is that Yoko Shimada makes the series.  Markio is an extraordinarily complex character, and Ms. Shimada's portrayal captures her wonderfully.  Plus Yoko is unbelievably beautiful.  You can't go wrong looking at her for 9 hours.  But that is not to take away from Blackthorne, or Alvito, or Yabu, and of course Tishiro Mifune as Toranaga.  Stellar performances all.
  The miniseries faithfully reproduces the main substory, the rise of the Englishman to Samurai.  Much of the other substories, the interactions of the Japanese characters mainly, are not fleshed out.  This is not a criticism, since the resources were limited and the language barrier formidable.  Lastly, the score by Maurice Jarre completes the miniseries.  The score, as much as the acting, storyline, and scenery, helps make the series a masterpiece.
  I do have criticism about the DVDs.  One is, of course, the deleted scenes.  Since its been 23 years I don't remember everything about the series, and I sometimes think I remember scenes that were only in the book.  However, with 5 DVDs no scenes should have been left out.  Especially the nudity.  If I could watch those scenes on NBC when I was ... young, I should be able to see them now.  I do question the claim that 3 hours were cut.  The 12 hour miniseries included commercials, and the opening and closing credits for each episode.

  Next is the over-narration by Orson Wells.  Nothing against the venerable Mr. Wells, but the voiceover noticeably detracts from some scenes.  Sometimes the point is to be as confused as Blackthorn, but other times there is plot movement that the book clearly wants the reader to understand.  Many times the interactions are later summarized in English.  Regardless, while 23 years ago subtitles may have been taboo, they certainly aren't now.  In this respect Paramount should have updated the series with subtitles.
  Finally, while the packaging is adequate, a booklet would have been a great touch, including pictures, chapter titles, etc.
  So some minor criticisms, but again, this is fantastic entertainment and a great investment.",1065225600,,2645,4.876126126126126
1902967,5,B0000A2ZNX,"""Shogun"" is, in my opinion, the greatest miniseries ever made.  It is a very faithful adaptation of James Clavell's bestselling novel, and a great story it is.  This is the story of Pilot-Major Blackthorne of the ship ""Erasmus,"" which is the first English ship to navigate to the orient.  Shipwrecked in Japan circa 1600, Blackthorne must adapt to the Japanese culture or die.  This is a wonderful story of an extraordinary man who is thrust into a highly civilized but very alien culture--a culture wracked by intrigue, politics, powerful Jesuit priests, and imminent civil war.  The friendship between Blackthorne and Lord Toranaga is very satisfying, and the story of his love for the Lady Toda is touching.
First and foremost, this is the story of a clash of cultures.  Blackthorne initially considers himself more civilized than his Japanese hosts, but by the end of the story he comes to appreciate the culture's emphasis on politeness, cleanliness, and honor.  He ultimately is assimilated and becomes an intimate advisor to Lord Toranaga and a samurai in his own right.
Other reviews have pointed out various historical inaccuracies to the story, and I will only say that such inaccuracies do nothing to detract from what is ultimately a fine story.  This miniseries is remarkably free from overlong tedious ""filler"" scenes, and instead for the most part moves along smartly, holds the viewer's interest, and is highly entertaining.  The DVD is of very high quality both audio and video, and constitutes a very good value.  I had not seen Shogun for many years, and if there are any missing scenes on this DVD I don't remember them.  This appears to be a fairly complete reproduction of the miniseries.  I have read Mr. Clavell's novel several times, and this miniseries does a fine job adapting it to the miniseries format, and is quite faithful to the story, taking no liberties with it.
""Shogun"" is a story that will hold the interest of most viewers.  Recommended",1065225600,,1975,4.948484848484848
1902968,5,B0000A2ZNX,"What more is there to say about this mini-series?  It's incredible, so check it out.  The picture quality is incredible (compare it to the 2 hour movie edit, which looks dark and grainy - the DVD looks like it was filmed in the last couple of years!), and the sound is great too.
I must say that after finding out there's a 12 hour version of this, I was a little disappointed.  The 9 hours was engaging, but I was left wanting so much more.  Now I know why! :) Surely Paramount could have fit another three hours onto the 4 discs?  Also, why did they take out the nudity?  The movie edit has it, and it's not like this version on DVD was going to be broadcast on television.  The movie edit version also has a different scene on the docks, when a blinded Blackthorne is being escorted to his ship past the Black Ship and her crew.  In the mini-series version, Father Dell'Aqua along with a group of Christian samurai are confronted by Ferreria, the Black Ship captain, and his crew, who intend to burn Blackthorne on a stake.  In the movie version, there is no Ferreria character, nor is there a Father Dell'Aqua, so the dock scene that version was an alternate take!  Blackthorne is instead escorted to the docks area by his brown samurai where he stops to have an amicable conversation with Rodriguez who is now the Black Ship captain rather than just the pilot.  They must have planned the movie edit from day one for this alternate scene to even exist.  It's too bad they didn't include this as part of a deleted scenes feature.
Overall, the set is amazing.  The making of featurette is very interesting, although the featurettes about the history of Japan and aspects of its culture are somewhat dull.  It's definitely worth the money.",1065139200,,1741,4.503184713375796
1902969,4,B0000A2ZNX,"Everybody here loves this serial, with good reason! I'll mention a few details that haven't been covered. The color is vivid and the picture quality is excellent. The sound has been re-mixed into an impressive stereo surround, although the original mono track (this was broadcast before the days of stereo TV) is available for you armchair purists.
Shogun was so popular that a special 30-minute summary version was shown a few days after it ended for viewers who had to miss the final episode to observe a Jewish holiday. Despite its success, someone at NBC decided that parts of the story needed to be clearer, so narration was added. The bad news is that this is not the original version from 1980, but that somewhat re-worked Shogun that aired a few years later. Sometimes the editors went overboard with this, adding redundant details that would come out five minutes later anyway.
The last disc in the set includes a fascinating collection of extras, including some spectacular ""bloopers"" caught on 35mm film. We get a rare glimpse of Yoko Shimada looking lovely in 2003-- I recall that she appeared at least once as a guest star on an American TV series after Shogun, but didn't thrive in Hollywood.

after watching the nine hour version i was less annoyed...even after cutting three hours out of this the main story is intact however alot of what made shogun so charming the first time has been removed while they trimmed the fat.little tidbits like when blackthorne asks for ""ohnna"" thinking this the name of the first woman he met but finding out that ohnna means woman....obviously not critical to the story but when you are as ""ANAL"" as i am and what ammounts to a 1/4 of the original mini series has been cut out you tend to dwell on whats missing and not whats there.i will live with the cuts because i also own the full vhs version,but if paramount tries to release a 12 hour directors cut in the future i will never buy another paramount product again.
now on to the dvds at hand....as i said nothing critical to the story has been removed..and as i am prone to watching this in one sitting the extra three hours of my life i got back was fine with me.the picture quality is like brand new vhs on a brand new vcr...when considering this is 20 years old it looks great.

1902973,5,B0000A2ZNX,"Shogun has been one of the most requested and long awaited titles to be released on DVD, and I'm happy to report that the end product was well worth the wait.
Author James Clavell's story of the ""Englishman who went to Japan and became a samurai"" remains one of the benchmarks of network TV fare over 20 years after its release. The detailed sets, gorgeous costuming, and sumptuous details have never looked or sounded better. This boxed DVD set has very crisp video and sharp sound. The packaging is quite attractive with new artwork and a nice gated 5 fold DVD holder. It would have been nice, though, if somewhere on here or on a separate card the contents of the discs would have been listed. A much better value than the expensive 4 VHS set as well!
Disc 5 holds the new extras. The 13 segment ""Making Of Shogun"" feature is the jewel on this disc. Many of the surviving actors such as Yoko Shimada, John Rhys-Davies, and Richard Chamberlain were interviewed along with production personnel such as director Jerry London, producer Eric Bercovici and others. Every aspect of the production, filming, and release of the movie is covered with all sorts of great information and ancedotes. Less impressive are the ""3 historical featurettes"" (samurai, tea ceremony, and geisha). These are short with very general information. The disc would have been better served with a 15 minute featurette presenting the historical situation and personalities Shogun was based on (who would't want to see Hosokawa Gracia, the woman Mariko was patterned after?). As a plethora of easily accessible source material is available on the subject, I don't know why this wasn't done. The ""audio commentary by director Jerry London on select scenes"" was a disappointment-rather than running with the soundtrack (after all, 9 hours of commentary would be a bit much for anyone to fill), these few scenes are presented separately and are short and rather non-informative, as most of the information is included in the ""Making Of"" segment (where London does a great job). All in all, though, I was happy to see any sort of extras with the program at all, and an entire disc was more than could be asked for!
The miniseries has aged incredibly well. The performances, particularly by the Japanese cast, still hold up. While there are many historical anachronisms and sometimes inaccurate use of the Japanese language, these really do not detract from the splendor of Shogun. After all, as Clavell stressed time after time in interviews, he was writing historical fiction, not fact. It is sad that many aspects of the characters could not be fleshed out to what they were in the novel (you never get a sense of just how intelligent and cunning Mariko is in the miniseries, or just how devious Omi, Yabu, Toranaga, and the Jesuit fathers are), but even a 9 hour miniseries didn't have time for all of this. The Mariko/Blackthorne romance, only a sidestory in the novel, here becomes the focus. In addition, this allowed the characters to reflect the strengths of the actors. Shimada was (and is!) the picture of Oriental womanhood. Chamberlain is good at portraying the romantic and intellectual side of Blackthorne, but was unconvincing when it came to the physical aspects of the role such as fight scenes or intimidating his crew (Blackthorne was written as a hot tempered, physically threatening sea captain/pirate-Clavell had wanted Sean Connery for the role for this reason. Chamberlain did a nice job on the ""mad dance"", though! Disc 5 has a great outtake of Chamberlain stumbling and collapsing in a heap while performing it). Focusing on the romance aspect therefore plays to Chamberlain's strengths and allows him to turn in a good performance, where his real enthusiasm for the role came through. Toshiro Mifune excels as the Daimyo Toranaga, and Frankie Sakai is a delight to watch as the treacherous Yabu-one minute friend, the other foe, right until the end. Rhys-Davies is at his bombastic best as Spanish pilot Rodrigues. In fact, the entire cast does an impressive job filling their niches.
One of the great things about Shogun is that it was filmed at actual locations you can still visit in Japan. The castles Himeji-jo and Hikone-jo stand in for Lord Ishido's Osaka Castle (which can also be visited in its rebuilt form). The rebuilt Fushimi-jo near Kyoto serves as Toranaga's Edo Castle (Edo Castle is now the Emperor's Palace in Tokyo, but the main keep no longer exists-the grounds and outbuildings are still huge and impressive!), and Matsumoto-jo as one of Toranaga's satellite castles. And for a taste of samurai life, you can visit Toei Studios Movieland (where part of Shogun was filmed, I believe) in Kyoto-it is just like stepping into one of the scenes from Shogun.
Overall, you can't go wrong with this package. A classic, milestone miniseries with great acting and production values with a well done transfer and nice new extras. Paramount made it worth the wait!",1064361600,,4968,4.929594272076372

I very much liked our friend ilpantsman's list of movies but I felt that he was missing a very special one and so I wanted to add this epic Shogun to his list but that was not possible, so I will with his permission of course borrow his list as most of the movies on it I have seen and enjoyed very much, and I have had the pleasure to add them to my private collection most of them but I still have yet to attain all of them which I will one day be able to say I have them all to treasure. All the movies that were in some way conected to Takeshi Kitano weather he was the star of the film or had a director credits to the film he always in a way unexplainable now made the flick a lot more enjoyable as he has great range to be able to in one film be a hardened gangster and kill everyone around him (Brother) with out thinking twice about killing or backing down and them in another film picked randomly (kikijiru) play a person who really cares for a small boy and plays with him and genuinly cares about what happens to the kid as he see's himself in the small boy that he used to be and had no one to care for him.

1902982,5,B0000A2ZNX,"I rented the VHS version a few years ago and was sadly disappointed...but now I'm looking forward to falling in love with this saga all over again!
In 1980, I was only 7 years old, but I loved this series--probably one of the first 'adult' programs I was allowed to stay up and watch! When I was older, I read the novel (it's big and it's got small print, be warned)...and reread and reread it! Granted, there's only so much you can show on TV and only so many hours you can tie up programming, but I think the series does a darn fine job of following the book. For an American TV population probably not very familiar with Japanese customs, this was a fascinating look into a very different world.
Even at 7, I felt the finely tuned tensions between the characters. I knew they had to deny what was in their hearts in order to hold to the dictates of society. Don't expect a Hollywood happy ending! This is much more like traditional Japanese stories and legends that end in heartbreaking separation of the hero and heroine for the sake of destiny or duty. If you're an anime or manga fan (like me!), you'll find familiar elements...
I absolutely loved the costumes and the settings in this series. There's enough in here to keep the romantics, the swashbucklers, and the military and history buffs occupied for a good long time.

1902983,5,B0000A2ZNX,"Reading some of these reviews, I wonder if anyone watches a movie or mini-series to be entertained by it. When you go down the line of people who gave this great title three or lower stars, you'll find it mostly comes from people who try to express their ""true"" historical knowledge, or simply didn't have the attention span for a drama of this caliber. Who cares?
I was 8 years old when Shogun came to television for the first time and my mother, a single-parent who never had much time for TV, sat enthralled and entranced by it. It was probably the way I looked watching Battlestar Galactica, or Saturday morning cartoons, and during whole time Shogun was airing my mother could not be bothered to pull herself away from this wonderful drama.
When I was a teen it aired again and I couldn't pull myself away, and it inspired my own interest in Japan and its culture. I submit to whoever is reading this the so-called history buffs, or historians who are giving this mini-series, or the book it was based on, low marks, it's only to flex their own scholastic muscle. It's pathetic posturing, really and has nothing to do with the true quality of the story.
Shogun continues to be one of the greatest stories ever told, and among the best adaptations of a novel ever done, right up there with ""Lonesome Dove"", and ""Gone with the Wind"". The charm of Richard Chamberlain's portrayal of Blackthorne (I don't need to know who the character was based on), the beauty and grace of Yko Shimada's portrayal of Mariko and the rest of the wonderful cast, combine to bring us a tale for the ages of Feaudal politics and forbidden romance.

1902989,5,B0000A2ZNX,"Stunning miniseries!
But, the purpose of this review is to give an alternate viewpoint on the `frustrating' lack of subtitles that some previous reviews complained about.
The main purpose of a lack of subtitles is to really bring you into Blackthorn's shoes and let you feel what he is feeling.  There is enough narration to get across important plot information, but you have to figure out the rest, just like Blackthorn.
It really increases the drama when you don't know whether Blackthorn's captors are discussing the weather or deciding the manner of his death.  On my first viewing, I found myself paying close attention to every facial expression and shrug of body language in the desperate attempt to learn (just as Blackthorn is).  It is really a simple and effective way of drawing you into the world and making you relate to the main character.
By the time Blackthorn and Rodriguez are on the ship together, I felt I really had a handle on some basic Japanese, just as Blackthorn did.
Even later in the story and armed with my basic knowledge of Japanese, the lack of subtitles is still effective.  It makes you listen attentively and patiently (even cautiously) and still brings you effortlessly into the shoes of the wiser Blackthorn.

Never has there been a more perfectly constructed use of television to convey a story either before or since this mini series. Put simply, Shogun is a masterful adaptaion of the James Clavell Novel that translates with complete perfection to the screen. Personally, I have been waiting for the release of this movie on DVD since DVD was invented. The VHS tape was just too expensive, and not good enough quality to merit the honor this film deserves!
It is the story of Pilot Major Blackthorn
(an English navagator aborad Dutch sailing Ship who lands on the ""Japans"")played by Richard Chamberlain, who is forced to learn the Japanese language and culture because if he does not, his crew and entire villiages will be put to death. He is taught the language and customs through the teachings of Mariko(Yoko Shimada), a japanese lady who is trusted by one of highest lords of Japan: Lord Toranaga(played by Toshiro Mifune). Pilot Major Blackthorn, eventually falls in love with Mariko, and forms a love triangle with Lord Buntaro(Mariko's husband) on their journy to fulfill Lord Toronagas ambition fo becoming a ""Shogun"" warlord. The only title more powerful than Emperor. This is only a infinitessimal glimpse of the plot! It is a huge whilrwind of honor,political boundaries, culture, and tradition amidst a touching story of love. All of which are portayed beautifully in fuedal Japan. The costumes and settings are pristine, and the language is kept as close to the original time period Japanese as was possible for the translations.
Just as ""American Yakuza"" (a film from the 1990's)  was true to
the current Japanese language and culture, so was this film true to the ancient culture and language of Japan.
The Mini series is a masterpiece. All the performers were perfect in the roles. Which range from Traditional Japanese roles to Spanish traders, to Jesuit priests. If you value history, and cherish tradion, this is a film to covet! There are not enough words in the English language to describe how wonderful this film is.

Also involved are enemy catholic Spanish traders, at war with England, & with a trade monopoly in the country which is threatened by Blackthorne's presense.

I watched the mini-series when it first came out and loved it then. Do not get 2 hour video too much was cut out; so disappointing. If any one likes historical fact mixed in with fiction like I do this is a must get item; so don't delay the money is worth it. The only thing that is fiction about the movie is the love affair between Mariko-san and Anjin-san. If anyone is deep into Japanese history must read about Tokugawa Ieyasu and other books on the Unification wars, Hideyoshi Toyotomi and Nobunaga. There is not much written about Captain-pilot William Adams not even in the Japanese language, but his Japanese name was really Anjin-san (Mr. Pilot). The village of Anjiro did and still does exit but under the modern name ""Miura"". Anjiro was renamed Miura sometime during the Edo period and the Meiji Restoration.

I like the way James Clavell wrote the relationship between Lord Toranaga and Blackthorne, and the forbidden love between Blackthorne and Mariko, and the hatred the Jesuits have for Blackthoren. It is amazing how James Clavell is able to make you almost feel like you are Blackthorne himself, and have you asking ""what would I do if I were him?"".

1902997,5,B0000A2ZNX,"The setting is medieval Japan in the late 1500s/1600s. Protestant England and the Netherlands are at war with Roman Catholic Spain and Portugal.
The story is basically set in the Age of Discovery, in the mid to late 1500s/early 1600s. There is a Dutch ship, the Erasmus, that is piloted by an English navigator, Blackthorn, played extremely well by Richard Chamberlain. The ship seems to get thrown off course, and encounters many severe storms, while unwittingly finding and traversing the secret Straits of Magellan. Despite a tragic loss of most of those on board, the ship is piloted safely away, and continues westward by northwest. Eventually, due in part to the storms, they reach land, and reach ""the Japans"", as Blackthorn comments, almost lifeless.
Blackthorn awakes in a completely foreign culture, with customs so different from his that he is at a complete loss as what to do. To his shock and dismay, and utter incomprehension, he has landed in Japan during the time of the samurai, an elite military class based on the concepts of bushido, a strict code of honor, and loyalty. There is one westerner there to greet him, Father Alveta, a Jesuit priest from Spain. He and Blackthorn are total and utter enemies from the start, and the priest is his nemesis throughout the film. The local samurai leader puts him in his place, but Blackthorn is noticed by his superiors, and eventually, by the Lord Torunaga, played by Torisho Mifune(who also starred in the famous ""Seven Samurai"" film of 1954). Blackthorn is recognized as a potentially valuable ally by Torunaga, who, in the course of the film, makes himself supreme military ruler, or Shogun, of Japan, subordinate only to the emperor. Blackthorn is commanded to learn Japanese, and the Lady Toda, played by Yoko Shimada, is his tutor. Of course, he falls madly in love with her, but there love is forbidden, as she is already married to an able samurai. Their love succeeds, despite all of the odds, but ends in tragedy, as she is killed in an assassination attempt on the Shogun. Blackthorn has another pilot as his friend and enemy, the indomitable Vasco Rodriguez, played by John Rhys-Davies.
This movie has everything, romance, adventure, intrigue, politics, religion, war, and even earthquakes. All in all, it is an excellent film",1030838400,,2301,4.948320413436693
1902998,4,B0000A2ZNX,"I watched SHOGUN as a child when it was first released, around 1980, and I enjoyed every episode. Since then, I have seen this movie over 12 times.
Toshire Mifune plays his character (Lord Toranaga) very well. His posture, etiquette, and indomitable ""Bushido"" spirit really stands out. Throughout the film, the dialogue between Blackthorne (Richard Chamberlain) and Toranaga are classic as well as Blackthorne's antagonistic view of jesuit priests. The simplicity and mannerisms of Mariko, Blackthorne's love interest in the film, gives the viewer an interesting yet true to life representation of the role of females in japanese society during fuedal times.
The only thing I find irritating is the lack of english subtitles when the japanese speak. It is narrated quite well and the film itself gives an insightful view of the nuances of its language and how respect and honor play in the hierarchial ladder between the samurai and their lords.
To the average viewer who has no knowledge of Japan and its people, SHOGUN gives a glimpse into a society that some consider a mystery. Though the film showcases a bit of flamboyancy in its narrations and character costumes, I highly recommend this book to be a permanent part of high school education in the US. It should inspire readers to go beyond the film and explore the beauty of Japan, its geography, history and culture; which I have found that the american youth of today fail to grasp an understanding of.",1027123200,,1462,4.9714285714285715
1902999,4,B0000A2ZNX,"I bought Shogun after reading the book. I approached it with a little trepidation, worrying that it would not live up to the standard of the novel. I needn't have worried. I spread it out over four nights and enjoyed it thoroughly. The only complaint I have is the portrayal of the Japanese characters. With the exception of the translator Mariko, none of the Japanese characters ever speak for themselves. The film has instances of untranslated Japanese (irritating) and whenever something vital happens, the English narrator tells us what has taken place. This, I think, cheapens the Japanese players, reducing to them to secondary characters. In the book, they are as vital to the story as Blackthorne and the other ""barbarians"" and this doesn't come out as much in the film. It would have been better to allow the Japanese characters to speak with their own voices, providing us with subtitles. That being said, it is a fantastic series and well worth the price.",1025308800,,966,4.896341463414634
1903000,5,B0000A2ZNX,"As Mr. Bernabo states, the original airing of this series was without narration and it worked so much better because, like Blackthorn, the (non-Japanese speaking) audience often had to rely on the voice inflections and facial expressions of the Japanese actors as well as the often suspect translators to understand what was going on.  My only hope is that when this is released on DVD (WHEN!?!?!?!) that the option is there to see it as it was first released (sans subtitles and narration.)  I recommend this miniseries to anyone and everyone who wants to appreciate the beauty of a culture that is rarely understood by those of European descent.

Now on DVD and I stand by my review.  This was the peak of the mini-series years. If only networks could produce these again instead of ""reality"" shows.",1020729600,,801,4.824817518248175

First, the lack of subtitles is annoying in the extreme.  For a story involving court politics, Jesuit schemes, pirate treasure, and forbidden love, one really needs to be able to follow what is said.  For the first four hours or so, forget about it (unless you speak Japanese).  If you don't, you'll know some basic phrases by the end.
So on my mini-series scale, with North and South a 5, and something truly terrible a 1 (I suppose if WWF made a mini-series, this would be it), Shogun is a 3.  Not terrible, but not good either.",1019520000,,673,4.251968503937008

1903006,5,B0000A2ZNX,"James Clavell's Shogun is perhaps one of the best told stories in the past century, both in novel and in the mini series. As you may all ready have read, the photo an acting is great, but to enyoy the Shogun experience at it's fullest, I can advice you the following: Read The book and then see the tapes. The tapes shurely deceipt the scenario and the general view of the story, but it ( and it's perfectly explainable) misses to portrait all the political intrigue an the very special way of thinking of all the characters, this is the real meat and potatoes of the soup.  Shure the series are very well done and are worthy buying and seeing without the book, but you will still miss all the flavour of this exceptional story.",988156800,,728,4.392592592592592
1903007,4,B0000A2ZNX,"Shogun is a superb adventure story, of that there can be no doubt. This boxed set of videos from the TV mini-series of the novel brings James Clavell's characters vividly to life, making the experience even more memorable for anyone who has read and enjoyed the book. For me the screen version added to the pleasure of reading Shogun because it explained things that were not entirely clear in the printed form.
Both in print and especially on screen Shogun is much more than a great tale of adventure. It contains, in my opinion, an even greater love story featuring, in the person of Mariko, one of the finest romantic heroines in all fiction.
As brought so exquisitely to life here by Yoko Shimada, who to my mind is the real star of the series - the set is worth buying for her scenes alone - Mariko is beautiful, brave, loyal and sincere. Delightful and totally believeable in all she says and does, I could not help but do as Pilot-Major Blackthorne did and fall in love with her, wishing that she would find with him the happiness that she has not known with her Japanese husband Buntaro.
In creating this unforgettable character James Clavell clearly set out to win the hearts and minds of his readers and , later , his viewers. Yet having succeeded in this he cruelly dashes all our hopes. Mariko is given her moment of triumph, but she pays a terrible price for it. It is as if Clavell felt that she was drawing too much attention away from his principal male characters, Blackthorne and Toranaga, and judging by Yoko Shimada's portrayal of Mariko in the series he may well have been right.
Yet if you go back to the book and read the crucial scene again, line by line, it seems clear that right up until the last instant a different outcome would easily have been possible. On screen it appears even more contrived than in print. Was James Clavell genuinely undecided as to what to do with Mariko?  I think he was, and for me he made the wrong choice. If ever a heroine deserved a better fate, it was Mariko.
Once she is gone, both versions of Shogun start to fall apart. The ending of the novel is far from satisfactory, and perhaps in the years following its publication James Clavell may have realised its imperfections. However, when he came to produce the TV mini-series in 1980, the best character in the book was gone and could not be kept alive in the film. So the changes introduced in the last hour of the screen version, which until now has followed the text of Shogun fairly closely, are invariably for the worse and result in the film having an even less satisfactory ending than the book.
But at least we are given a chance to hear the words of that beautiful and moving final letter which Mariko leaves with Toranaga to give to Blackthorne. And karma or not, both in print and on screen she surely lives on in the memories of all who read the book or see this screen version.",986688000,,2901,4.473584905660378
1903008,4,B0000A2ZNX,"This is not an easy series to review because I find myself of two minds about it.  The story itself I find highly enjoyable and evocative of classical Japanese romance, if not exactly true to the form.  The history behind it, however, leaves something to be desired.
The series is a surprisingly faithful adaptation of the book, and the mini-series format gives the story the depth needed to tell Clavell's book properly.  The costumes and settings are impressive (if possibly a bit more elaborate than history would require) and the story is a complex, well told one.  The style and pace of the story are even reminiscent of some classical Japanese romances like ""Gonza the Spearman"" or ""Double Suicide"".  The ultimate moral and conclusion differ somewhat from the traditional Japanese, but then again, the intention was not to sell ""Shogun"" to a Japanese audience.
The history, however, is a bit disappointing.  While the story of Blackthorne (Will Adams in real life) is a true one, Clavell paints an image of a Japan that is much more stratified and romantic than was actually the case at the time.  Tokugawa Ieyasu (Toranaga, played by Toshiro Mifune) actually codified and enforced the samurai code that Clavell has in place for the story.  The samurai and daimyo of the story are much more stylized than you would actually have found then.  For the type of samurai shown in this movie, one would need to jump about a hundred years foward.  Historically, the samurai of this movie would have been somewhat more like those seen in ""Seven Samurai"" (another Mifune movie).
I am also somewhat confused as to why Clavell seemed to find the need to change the names of all of the historical characters of the movie.  If it was to distance the characters from the actual history, then it was probably a good idea.  However, if his intention was a historically accurate book or series (which I rather doubt) his decision is rather puzzling.
On the technical side, the presentation of the series is a 'book-style' case with a booklet about the series (with lots of trivia and useful Japanese phrases) is quite nice.  I regret the producers' decision to compress the episodes together rather than to give a separate opening and ending for each, but it is a minor complaint.  I would love to see what they could do with this as a DVD release.
All in all, though, ""Shogun"" is a lot of fun to watch.  The Japan presented is the Japan of American fantasy, but that is fine if you're watching it for the entertainment value.  If your interest in Japan tends towards the casual or your interest in James Clavell towards the serious, I recommend the entire mini-series.",979516800,,2658,4.758169934640523
1903009,5,B0000A2ZNX,"This is a fantastic series.  Why on earth doesn't any of James Clavell's works end up on DVD??  If they were on DVD, I'd buy them again!",978134400,,136,4.0
1903010,5,B0000A2ZNX,"It has been two decades since James Clavell's novel first aired, but ""Shogun"" is still one of the finest mini-series yet produced and it still holds up.  The stranger in a strange land story of an English navigator shipwrecked in fuedal Japan strikes such a strong chord because the audience is in the same predicament as the main character, confronted with an unknown and dangerous world that refuses to make sense.  ""Shogun"" was filmed in Japan with remarkable fidelity to both the original story and local culture.
As Pilot-Major John Blackthorne, Chamberlain is often called upon to do more with looks than with dialogue.  As the ""King of the Mini-Series,"" it is easy to forget what Chamberlain can do as an actor given the proper material (I wish his version of Christopher Fry's ""The Lady's Not For Burning"" was available on video tape).  Actually, there is a sense in which Chamberlain's performance is arguable the weakest of the cast, but that speaks more to the strength of the supporting players.  Certainly John Rhys-Davies steals every scene he is in as Vasco Rodrigues, Damien Thomas' Father Alvito personifies political machination, and Nobuo Kaneko as Lord Ishido has that glare down perfectly.  Ultimately, it is the Japanese actors who carry ""Shogun.""  From the legendary Toshir Mifune as Lord Toranaga, to the novice actress Yko Shimada as Mariko, to Frankie Sakai as Yabu and every one of the characters who make up Blackthorne's Japanese household, these actors provide the new word that confront's Chamberlain's character.  The choice of producer Eric Bercovici to also adopt Clavell's novel was the ideal choice.  Bercovici was not only familiar with the mini-series format, having done ""Washington Behind Close Doors,"" but he was the writer on ""Hell in the Pacific,"" a 1968 movie with Lee Marvin and Toshir  Mifune.  During WWII the two men end up on a deserted island.  What made the film unique was that it was done without subtitles; Marvin spoke English and Mifune spoke Japanese and the idea was to show it in both countries without subtitles.  Okay, unfair advantage to the Japanese, but you have to appreciate the idea which ""Shogun"" certainly uses to great effect.
Director Jerry London does an admirable job of presenting Japanese culture on its own terms, which is exactly what is right for the story.  My understanding was that the Orson Welles narration was added at the, uh, request of the network who felt audiences would not be able to read between the lines.  I think that for the most part ""Shogun"" would work without the excessive explanations, even if you have not read the novel, but we will never know.
If you are looking for something to lose yourself in next weekend, you would not find too many things as intelligent and as fascinating as ""Shogun.""  Just be sure you do the complete original mini-series and not the one cassette mini-version.",970963200,,2890,4.940082644628099
1903011,2,B0000A2ZNX,"Better that you see the video first, and then read the book, otherwise you  will be disappointed.
The film focused too much on Richard Chamberlain,  playing him up as a Western hero, rather than the baffled pawn that in  reality he was. The love interest with Shimada Yoko was poorly done, making  her out to be a simple bimbo finding a kind foreigner, when she was much  stronger and intelligent than was portrayed.
John Rhys-Davies is a  strong as ever, these swashbuckling roles seem designed for him, while  Toshiro Mifune projects a modicum of charisma, at least all the the series  allowed.
As other reviewers have pointed out, the book is very detailed,  and was hard to render into TV. Unfortunately, the videos of his other  novels in the same area, Noble House and Taipan were equally as banal,  fulfilling the limited geographical and historical understanding, and  instant gratification requirements of the US TV audience.
The only film  on Asia that has ever managed to capture the full flavour of a book, and  transfer it onto the screen was ""The World of Suzie Wong"", a  personal favourite, but the topic of an artist and a bargirl is not for  everyone.
As a long-time resident of Japan, maybe I am too familiar with  the story, but it is a shame to see the videographic equivalent of a 12  course dinner compressed into a sandwich box.
For anyone who has not read  the book, go ahead and watch a reasonable snapshot of the shogunate era,  but if you have read the book, and liked James Clavell's detail, I  recommend that you buy a couple of bottles of sake, put on a kimono, settle  down into a comfy futon and read it again!",965606400,,1642,4.589655172413793
1903012,4,B0000A2ZNX,"Very few mini-series' ever live up to the book from which it came. Shogun comes very close. Taking place during a period when all of Europe was competing for the riches of the world, the story starts off with the last  ship of a lost fleet, down to a skeleton crew (in size as well as health)  trying to find ""the Japans"". Pilot-Major John Blackthorn, played  well by Richard Chamberlain, wakes up on shore in Japan after barely making  to land. Used to being in control, he is swept up in all the politics and  violence that this period of Japan could offer. In just the first day alone  he sees a beheading, is forced to listen to one of his crew boiled to  death, and must endure the shame of having a Samurai ""relieve  himself"" on his back. He then becomes a pawn between two lords, the  brutal Ishido, and the cunning Toranaga. As Blackthorn begins to understand  the culture, he also begins to build his own power and worth, causing  Toranaga to realize the value of the Englishman.
Throughout this  mini-series the photography is stunning, the action impressive, and the  romance steamy. The acting here is also probably the best overall of any  epic film. The film follows closely to the book with minor exceptions, and  keeps the viewer riveted throughout the entire series. Also the continual  battle between Blackthorn and the Jesuit Priest, Father Alvito, seems to  have been written to match the feud between Ishido and Toranaga. Both feuds  are intense and gut-wrenching, leading though to different types of  endings.
This series is a great story, told well, and captures the  imagination quickly. I would recommend this to any viewer who likes an  action-packed and entertaining adventure. Just be prepared: There are some  scenes that are a little violent. This was necessary to get the feel for  how violent this period was in Japan, however it can still be a wee bit  disturbing.
