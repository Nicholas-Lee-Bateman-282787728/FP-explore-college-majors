Edward Woodward is wonderful as the  up-tight bullying ""Christian copper"" and Christopher Lee (yes, of  Hammer Dracula fame) gives us an educated, sophisticated (and manipulative)  Pagan lord of the people.

587472,5,6303149200,"Truly chilling film from director Robin Hardy has some restored footage and looks great. Speaking of great, the stars, Edward Woodward (""Breaker Morant,"" ""The Equalizer"" TV series) and Christopher Lee (""Lord of the Rings,"" ""Horror of Dracula"") give brilliant performances aided by a strong supporting cast that includes Britt Ekland (""Get Carter""), Diane Cliento (""Hombre,"" ""Tom Jones"") and Ingrid Pitt (""Countess Dracula""). British police officer Sgt. Howie (Woodward) comes to the lush island Summerisle in search of a missing girl, Rowan Atkinson, whose plight came to his attention by way of an anonymous letter. . A devout Christian, Howie finds himself in a nightmarishly Pagan society, where fertility is celebrated in every way thinkable -- including public intercourse by the young people of the village. Even more disturbing to Howie, the locals seem totally indifferent to the missing lass. The powers-that-be at British Lion, the company that produced the film, hated it and did everything in its power to bury it, even going to the extreme of cutting it down to incoherence and giving the deleted footage and outtakes away to be used as filler in the English roadway system. Originally released in 1973, it wasn't until the mid-'80s, when Lee made a personal effort to try to find the missing footage, that a nearly complete version (found in director Roger Corman's libray) was shown in theaters to rave reviews.

587537,4,6303149200,"When Sir Christopher Lee states this was the best scripted movie he appeared in than it is a must see. As I feel we hear that phrase too much. I do not like using it but I make exceptions such as this one. I know being from the 1970s, not all will like or appreciate the film. Although labeled as a horror movie, ""The Wicker Man"" is actually a suspense/thriller. Written by Anthony Shaffer, the journey from when Police Sergeant Howie, played by Sir Edward Woodward, arrives on this Scottish island to locate a reported missing girl to its conclusion when Howie has ""a date with The Wicker Man."" is well-done. Besides being well-written, it has very good acting. Sir Christopher Lee gives one of best performances as island's leader. Lord Summerisle. Ingrid Pit (another Hammer Horror veteran), Diane Cilentro and Britt Ekland(who co-starred with Lee in the Bond film ""The Man with the Golden Gun"") also gives fine supporting performances as island residents that Howie has to deal with in order to solve his case. Other reviewers and Amazon has already provided you with a summary of the film, so I do not wish to repeat the fine work of others here. Among the special features are a trailer, an recent interview with Director Robin Hardy and the 'Worshipping ""The Wicker Man"" ' featurette. The main reason I give the Four Stars and Five is the failure to include the excellent documentary, ""The Wicker Man Enigma"" that was on the Anchor Bay DVD. I do not know if it was an issue with copyrights or royalties, but as StudioCanal has the movie rights( please correct me if I am wrong) and should have included this feature.",1498348800,,1623,4.658536585365853

587539,3,6303149200,"Movie 7 of 1973 and 7 overall of my journey through films of my lifetime.
From the outset I'd like to say that this film was begging to be directed by Roman Polanski. Perhaps, in many ways, it was inspired by his films.
I was not impressed by the first 40 minutes of ""The Wicker Man."" It wasn't boring, it was almost a musical, there was a little too much exposition rather than interesting hints and visuals. It committed a great sin in that the music, while I'm sure contemporaneous and certainly lyrically moving (not emotionally but expositionally), was not conducive for the mood. I don't think this was a limitation of the time either, it was a choice and a rather bad one. My single biggest issue with the beginning is the main character. Completely unlikeable! He was a prissy complainer wielding his authority (he was a police officer from the main land) like a moody child. In the end it was actually important that the audience not like him so that we are ""on board"" for its conclusion. The movie was also making some ignorant political jests. The main character was ultimately a straw man against Christianity and possibly all authority figures (laaaame, no wonder hippies are given zero respect) and making him contemptible was, again, important so that we would cozy up to the denizens of this esoteric cult. There were some interesting elements to the beginning though. I enjoyed a dance of seduction that could barely be contained by a wall. Yes it was corny but creative. The latter half of the film was really good! Christopher Lee was superb! The plot twists were intriguing and caught me off guard. Some of the plot was thin however. The trap that was set for our hero(?) would have required omniscience from the island dwellers to truly pull off. I would say the set up for the plot twist didn't ""play fair"" with the audience. Also, the character did something quite out of character to participate in the ending. These issues could have been avoided in two ways: 1)a little bit of character development. The main character never changed or learned. He was just there. 2) perhaps a hint of the supernatural would have helped. I'm not saying anything overbearing, just a hint that forces were at work that would explain how the final plan could have possibly been done. Instead we just get a line about free will and how they, the cult, had manipulated him. Thin, very, very, thin.
Pros:
Christopher Lee
Strong second half
Never boring
Cons:
Plot was a little thin
Music takes you out of the immersion
Idiotic politics
An unfun, uninteresting, unlikeable main character with zero arc.

I will continue with 1973, not sure what film though.",1495411200,,2659,4.7182795698924735
587576,1,6303149200,"Just bad.  Edward Woodward was good, the rest of the cast not, the content was of the hippy era and it showed (including gratuitous nudity).  Waste of money, don't bother!",1495324800,,171,4.666666666666667

587578,5,6303149200,So I grew up in the seventies but I didn't watch this movie until the late 80's. It was on TV frequently when I was growing up but it never sounded interesting. So I think it was on WGN in Chicago and maybe it was the Svengali Show. I had just clicked it on and I caught the beginning where they give a little girl a live toad to put in her mouth because she was sick or something.  So I was thinking what the hell is this? So I am watching this movie and I mean it just keeps getting weirder and weirder. So no clue what is going on the whole movie and then the end happens. Freaking blew me away. I have loved this movie ever since. I would recommend watching this movie when you can give it your full attention  and not be bothered. It's such a classic.,1493510400,,756,3.9671052631578947
587579,4,6303149200,"I am not a movie reviewer.  You may like it and you may not.  Once I caught on to the plot, I enjoyed it.  Part of the plot has to do with Celtic (pagan) rituals vs Christianity.  This may bother the very devout Christians as it did the lead character.  On the other hand, this movie is very well thought of in England and according to one movie group, is considered the 6th best movie made in England.  It comes close to being as popular as Rocky Horror Picture Show and I can imagine people lining up at midnight to see this movie and well prepared to sing along.

587584,5,6303149200,"This is an unintentionally hilarious, yet well done, cult classic starring the immortal Christopher Lee. Not really a ""horror"" film, more of a mystery/suspense. It's only a horror if you identify with Howie instead of Lord Summerisle... and I'll leave it at that.

TWM is a very strange movie and very much a product of its time (early 70s), but keeping that in mind it's very well done. The research put into creating the Pagan religion of the island was obviously thorough, and the setting is gorgeous and perfect. The acting by the principals is well done too, even though a bit over-the-top by modern standards. There are moments that will make you laugh out loud, and moments that will creep you out. Well balanced all around.

Make some popcorn and have your favorite recreational substances on hand... definitely a trip worth taking.",1487462400,3,840,4.8671328671328675

It seemed a bit campy and overwrought.  A second viewing made me adore it.  What the film does so effectively is superimpose lightheartedness on wickedness - one can guess very early on what the conclusion will be (hint: look at the movie poster) but how it arrives there, through the seemingly eccentric behavior of the cast, is what makes it memorable.

587877,1,6303149200,"I've been a fan of horror for quite a long while, but over the past 6-7 years I've reinvested in the genre, enjoying the new and the old and searching for more. After you've seen quite a bit of the titles, you end up wondering if you've missed any good ones. So, I began hunting online ""Top 100 Horror Movies of All Time,"" or ""Best Horror Movies You've Never Seen,"" and such. The 1973 Wicker Man came up again and again as some kind of uber classic, genre posterchild akin to The Exorcist. So, after much hesitation, I rented it.

There's 90 minutes of my life I'm not getting back. Say what you want, but this was NOT a horror movie. Maybe, you could call it a mystery. Or maybe, to be most accurate, you'd need to create a brand new genre. Something like ""High Cheese Soft Porn H. R. Puff-n-Stuff Dropped Acid and Filmed a Movie."" I get that the movie was made during the swinging seventies and the drug revolution, but OY! This was intolerable, awful, tripe. Poor Ed Woodward, bless him, gave his role everything he had. But everyone else around them seemed like they'd performed their lines after a 30 minute whiff of laughing gas. Christopher Lee, what? What did you do? To see Dracula (from the fantastic Hammer Films) and Sauron dancing about like a pixy while wearing a Cher wig...? It just curdles the blood. The sad thing is, there might have been a very cool horror movie in here somewhere, if the script were better, if the vibe were better, ifwell, everything was better.

It is NOT scary, although it is easy to see how a devout Christian would be mortified by witnessing the Pagan customs depicted in this film. (Picture couples outside having sex in full view of anyone who passes by, and school teachers explaining to young girls that a maypole is actually a representation of a large penis...) It is part mystery and part musical, and the acting is very good. The pace is a little slow, but it was unique enough to hold my attention. (I'll admit the strip of skin in the tree was a little unnerving, pun intended.) Apparently the entire community of people living on a small Scottish island participate in the same Pagan celebrations, and everyone seems to know exactly what is going on except for our straight-laced virginal cop from the mainland. I think I enjoyed watching the bonus material more than the actual movie. The trailer makes it look very fun, and the story of how the movie finally got released is pretty incredible.

it's been said that the Wicker man is the best British Horror film from the 70's, well that's a matter of opinion really
and i have to Disagree, some of the best British Horror came from the Hammer films
the Wicker man is not really a Horror film, it's more of a suspense psychological thriller, than a Horror
in fact there is no Blood or Gore in the film, and there is a Big Difference in the 2 Genres
again it's matter of opinion
this new U.S. blu-ray by Lionsgate has only one version of the film called the Final cut
which is the Unrated version of the film in 1:85:1 widescreen
none of the special features from the Anchor bay release have been carried over
especially the retrospective making of from the Anchor bay dvd
infact Lionsgate have added new special features, new featurettes
WORSHIPPING THE WICKER MAN-23mins & THE MUSIC OF THE WICKER MAN-16mins
an interview with Director Robin Hardy-17mins and a Restoration comparison 1min 55sec
and the usual original theatrical trailer is added
now the U.K. blu-ray by U.K.'s Studio canal is very Different to the Lionsgate blu-ray
well you get 3 versions of the film in 1:85:1 ratios
and more extras actually

Disc 1 is the Final cut version plus some more extras that are not on the U.S. blu-ray
i was Disgusted at the picture quality for this new final cut version
i expected a better result from a HD transfer, if i was to rate the quality about 5/10
so very poor effort from Studio canal
BURNT OFFERING-THE CULT OF THE WICKER MAN DOCO-45MINS filmed for British TV broadcast
interviews with Christopher lee, Edward Woodward, Director Robin Hardy, Producer Peter snell, writer Anthony shaffer
plus Actresses Britt Ekland and Ingrid Pitt are also interviewed
this Doco is very detailed, it covers the script, the cast, the filming locations, the music score, the Editing, etc
WORSHIPPING THE WICKER MAN, FAMOUS FANS, THE MUSIC OF THE WICKER MAN
are another 3 small featurettes
plus another interview with Robin Hardy & Christopher lee from 1979-25mins
all these featurettes plus the Burnt offering Doco ca play be played together or individually

Disc 2 has the U.K. Theatrical version-87mins and the Longer Directors cut version at 100mins runtime
both in 1:85:1 widescreen
i checked the picture quality for both versions, looks to me that they're just DVD transfers from the U.K. DVD release
the quality is very average, the picture quality in the Directors cut drops in & out, from Blurry to sharp & clear
which annoyed me bigtime
i believe the blurry scenes are the Deleted or outtake scenes that have been inserted back into the Theatrical version
which shouldn't matter right! this Director cut should've been given a new HD transfer regardless, how stupid
not to give this version a HD transfer
the U.K. theatrical version is no Different it looks like the DVD transfer again
plus there's a making of commentary track feature for the Director cut version
which is filmed footage of Chris Lee, Robin Hardy, Edward woodward doing the commentary for the Director cut version
taken from the old dvd version
Disc 3 is the CD soundtrack of the film which i think is pointless unless you're Die hard fan who loves the music score
which i'm not, but i am a fan of the 3 different versions of the film
so if you love this classic 1973 British Horror/thriller then buy the U.K. blu-ray version
which has more to offer in terms of the extras & 3 different versions of the film
it's region B locked so you'll need all regions player of course
1 star for this Lionsgate blu-ray based on very minimal extras & only one version of the film
2-3 stars for the U.K. blu-ray based on very average picture quality,
the U.K. theatrical version & Directors cut look like straight DVD transfers",1443312000,4,3776,4.711043872919818

Because I feel none of them capture the true essence of this film, which is that it is both utterly awful and stunningly brilliant.

I will pull no punches. This film is terrible.  The story is linear and predictable.  It is yet another retelling of the common urban British fear that the yokels are up to no good.  The protagonist is utterly unsympathetic and his actions make no sense.  I must admit I am an American, but there is something incredible about an unarmed lawman going to the uttermost fringe of the nation without any backup or means to get help.  Clearly I've watched too many westerns.

Christopher Lee is of course brilliant and I can understand why he cherished this movie.  Certainly it was on his (posthumous) recommendation that I purchased it.

And this is where the movie is brilliant.  It is the epitome, the ne plus ultra of late 60s/early 70s film making.  The music alone is beyond parody. Christopher Lee actually appears in a lace and kilt ensemble that makes Austin Powers look tame.

If you watch this movie expecting it to be genuinely scary, suspenseful and - to put it bluntly - any good, you will be profoundly disappointed.

No, the proper way to watch this is with a group of friends who are heavily inebriated.  Sing along with the songs!  Laugh along with the locals!

Now it was my singular misfortune to watch this movie alone and stone sober, but had I been lit up, I would have enjoyed it every bit as Zardoz (which is also wonderful to watch while wasted).

I have therefore awarded five stars for the drunk version.  If you are sober, this is one star at best.",1436227200,,1700,4.566225165562914

Sergeant Howie journeys to the remote Hebridean Island, of Summerisle, to investigate the disappearance of a young girl, Rowan Morrison. While investigating the disappearance of the young girl he discovers there's a larger mystery to solve among the island's secretive, neo-pagan community. Neil Howie, a devout Christian, is appalled to find that the inhabitants of the island have abandoned Christianity and now practise a form of Celtic paganism. He meets the enigmatic Lord Summerisle who comes across as suitably sincere as well as being sinister. The role of Lord Summerisle is aptly played by the late Christopher Lee. This film was in part conceived as a vehicle for Christopher Lee to get away from his Hammer roles and give him a chance to validate that, yes, he could actually act.

Lord Summerisle describes that his grandfather, an agronomist, established strains of seeds that would flourish in Scotland's climate, and invigorated the acceptance that the old gods would use the new strains to deliver the islanders from a meagre agrarian livelihood. His investigation exposes the sinister truth that after a poor crop, the islanders make a sacrifice to guarantee that the next will be plentiful. Sergeant Howie concludes that Rowan is still alive and has been chosen for sacrifice. During the May Day celebration, he disguises himself in a costume (that of Punch, the fool) and infiltrate the parade.

Edward Woodward's character is awkward, at times clumsy; he performs well as a pious Highland Police Sergeant, and thus carries the film. However, what ultimately makes this film is its ending, for it is unavoidable, as if this was the sergeants destiny, and yet wholly unexpected when it finally comes.

The Wicker Man is a classic film, for me it cannot be pigeon holed into any particular genre  that said it really worth watching and is therefore highly recommended.

For me personally, this story only got good and riveting until the ending of the middle, and even then it was difficult to watch the end. This movie is excellent for people who are interested in other ways of life other than the western christian way of life, and for those who like any kinds of thrillers.

588202,5,6303149200,"This is a movie that is indeed different. To me it is not a horror movie, but more of a suspense/thriller,  this turned out to be a incredible, subtly disturbing movie.  It is weird and it is not for everybody, it has a little bit of everything in it, but it's basically about a village of practicing Pagans, who have weird rituals. When a police officer investigates a disappearance on the island he gets more than he bargained for. This movie came out in the early 70's, it is classified as horror; but I think it's because of the ending. If you enjoy a story that you could almost believe is real, if you are a collector of old horror, thrillers and enjoy music from the old country, well you are in for a ride

THE WICKER MAN is the story of a British policeman named Sergeant Howie (Edward Woodward) who flies out to the remote, clannish, half-forgotten Scottish island of Summerisle, to investigate the disappearance of a young girl named Rowan Morrison. Almost immediately upon landing he begins to suspect the tight-lipped islanders aren't telling him everything, but his frustrated investigation rapidly yields one piece of very disconcerting information: on Summerisle, Christianity is dead and Celtic Paganism is the one true faith. Howie, a devout and somewhat self-righteous Christian, is revolted by this, and by the wanton sexuality of the island's female population, most noticeably the gorgeous Willow MacGregor (Brit Ecklund). Encountering the island's de facto ruler, Lord Summerisle (Christopher Lee), Howie gradually begins to suspect that Rowan Morrison may not have been murdered as he first suspected, but may in fact have been kidnapped preparatory to some Celtic ritual of human sacrifice. Determined to save Rowan's life, he searches the island from one end to the other without success, before deciding on an even more radical plan of action: he will infiltrate the ""cult"" by masquerading as one of them. Only then will he discover the answer to the question that brought him to Summerisle and has now placed his life in jeopardy: what the devil happened to Rowan Morrison?

The first half of this movie to be heavy going. There is a lot of bizarre dialogue and a lot -- I mean a LOT -- of singing. A lot of what I saw seemed weird for the sake of being weird and I didn't understand what the hell the point of all of this discomfort was. Once I crested Mount Weird, I began to see that like Rowan Morrison, I was being led somewhere...somewhere very nasty, and all the nastier because the bad guys in this film don't see themselves as bad at all. Quite the contrary....

Edward Woodward a best performance as a devoutly Christian cop whose entire sense of right and wrong, sane and insane, and hell, even up and down, are attacked from the moment he lands his seaplane by the quiet little island.  Nave police Sgt Neil Howie goes to Summerisle to investigate a report of a missing girl. His quest is continually obstructed by the villagers, every man woman and child, in some subtle manner. A sense of brooding menace exists throughout the tale until finally Sgt Howie, like the Fool in the Tarot Deck, is brought to meet an unexpected and horrific reality. This is a film that crumbles the self-assurance of its hero by degrees, inflicting a slow nonviolent torture on both him and the viewer, until exploding into a climax so jarring, so disturbing, and so outright horrifying that it took me hours to recover.

THE WICKER MAN: Sgt. Neil Howie (Woodward) is an upright man. A real saint: A devout Catholic, an honest policeman, and a middle-aged virginall of which together conspires to make him dour and humorless. When he visits an island off the coast of Scotland to investigate the alleged disappearance of a young girl, he is more scorned than welcomed. Summerisle is an odd place: couples [expletive deleted] in the street; near-naked nymphs dance around bonfires; young men are presented to beautiful Willow (Eklund) as sacrifices to Aphrodite. Howies response is to pray for their heathen souls.

Frustrated in his investigation, he seeks the help of the islands mysterious master, Lord Summerisle (Lee), who explains the isles religion of nature worship. Howie begins to believe that the child is not dead, but will be used as a human sacrifice in some pagan barbarity at the climax of the frenzied rites on their holy day of death and regeneration, May Day. Tomorrow. Can he find her in time? Or is her disappearance merely part of an even more sinister plot afoot?

Discussion: This intelligent primer in paganism pits a modern Christian against ancient forces of nature. Will his God forsake him? Or will he learn the hard way the parallels between the blood sacrifices of paganism and the martyrdom of Jesus? I hope you don't think that I can be made a fool of indefinitely, Sgt. Howie growls. Well, they *are* counting on it...

All the clues about whats really going on in this pagan paradise are given to Howie, and he is offered every possible chance to save himself from the role the residents of Summerisle have conscripted him to play in their ceremony. But he is too prig-headed to believe or accept his salvation. His fateillustrated in the harrowing and unexpected endingstands as a warning of the consequences of religious intolerance and a closed-minded attitude.",1423094400,,2131,4.83013698630137

588398,5,6303149200,"THE WICKER MAN (1973) is a splendid motion picture, one of my favorite horror/mystery pictures and probably one of my favorite movies, period.  Although the film was a box office disappointment when it was initially released, it has gone on to earn a large cult following; in more recent years, even mainstream critics have realized it is a work of genius.  What makes this film so powerful is not the scary/disturbing parts so much as the vivid creation of the strange world of Summerisle, where as Lord Summerisle (Christopher Lee in his greatest role) says, ""the old gods aren't dead.""  THE WICKER MAN is not just a horror film; it has elements of the musical as well, and it asks thoughtful questions about the nature of religion and belief.  Some viewers see the film as pro-pagan, and others see it as a profoundly Christian movie.  I see it as anti-dogma and think the film's true message is summed up in one of Sgt. Howie's (the terrific Edward Woodward) lines:  ""think!  For Christ's sake, think!""  To say more would be a disservice to newcomers to this powerful, thought-provoking work of art.  Having said that, I must warn readers of this review that this copy of THE WICKER MAN is NOT the complete version.  It is a shortened version that deletes some important scenes and re-arranges others.  Most egregiously, the erotic dance by Willow MacGregor (Britt Ekland) takes place early in this cut, but it is supposed to take place late in the film.  Changing the timing of the scene is a terrible mistake, for it lessens the effect and suggests an attempt to make the film more exploitative than it ought to be.  However, as of this writing, the complete 99-minute cut seems to be out of print.  Look for it on the usual used media sites--it is available through a collector's edition from the late 90s.

588534,4,6303149200,"The definition of ""strange"" is ""something which is different from what is usual, normal or expected."" The definition of ""macabre"" is ""involving death or violence in a way that is strange, frightening, or unpleasant; having death as a subject : comprising or including a personalized representation of death.""

Both these words apply to THE WICKER MAN.

I'd heard rumors and whispers about this movie for years; I'd even read Christopher Lee's warm words for it in his autobiography, but I didn't watch it until this year, and I admit that about halfway through I was ready to press STOP and give up. The movie was slow, eccentric, bizarre and at times, borderline ridiculous; then, all of the sudden, the eccentricity began to ravel into a feeling of increasing unease and menace, a sort of ""everyone is in on the joke except the hero, and it's a very black joke indeed."" By the climax I was watching mainly to see what the hell would happen, and once it did...well, not since the original PLANET OF THE APES have I been so jarred by a movie's ending.

THE WICKER MAN is the story of a British policeman named Sergeant Howie (Edward Woodward) who flies out to the remote, clannish, half-forgotten Scottish island of Summerisle, to investigate the disappearance of a young girl named Rowan Morrison. Almost immediately upon landing he begins to suspect the tight-lipped islanders aren't telling him everything, but his frustrated investigation rapidly yields one piece of very disconcerting information: on Summerisle, Christianity is dead and Celtic Paganism is the one true faith. Howie, a devout and somewhat self-righteous Christian, is revolted by this, and by the wanton sexuality of the island's female population, most noticeably the gorgeous Willow MacGregor (Brit Ecklund). Encountering the island's de facto ruler, Lord Summerisle (Christopher Lee), Howie gradually begins to suspect that Rowan Morrison may not have been murdered as he first suspected, but may in fact have been kidnapped preparatory to some Celtic ritual of human sacrifice. Determined to save Rowan's life, he searches the island from one end to the other without success, before deciding on an even more radical plan of action: he will infiltrate the ""cult"" by masquerading as one of them. Only then will he discover the answer to the question that brought him to Summerisle and has now placed his life in jeopardy: what the devil happened to Rowan Morrison?

As I said, I found the first half of this movie to be heavy going. There is a lot of bizarre dialogue and a lot -- I mean a LOT -- of singing. A lot of what I saw seemed weird for the sake of being weird and I didn't understand what the hell the point of all of this discomfort was. Only my loyalty to Edward Woodward and Christopher Lee kept me going, but once I crested Mount Weird, I began to see that like Rowan Morrison, I was being led somewhere...somewhere very freaking nasty, and all the nastier because the bad guys in this film don't see themselves as bad at all. Quite the contrary....

Obviously I am not giving you hard details here, because I can't describe the movie very accurately without giving away the store. What I can say is that Edward Woodward delivers a possibly career-best performance as a devoutly Christian cop whose entire sense of right and wrong, sane and insane, and hell, even up and down, are attacked from the moment he lands his seaplane by the quiet little island -- at first subtly, then more and more blatantly until the audience wonders just how much power the law has on an island which seems to be a law unto itself. This is a film that crumbles the self-assurance of its hero by degrees, inflicting a slow nonviolent torture on both him and the viewer, until exploding into a climax so jarring, so disturbing, and so outright horrifying that it took me hours to recover.

And isn't that exactly what you want from a horror movie?",1410480000,6,3915,4.792592592592593

588536,4,6303149200,"This is a review of the Blu-ray 94 minute edition of The Wicker Man. The Movie gets 5 stars, the Blu-ray gets 4 stars. Those familiar with the Anchor Bay 2 disc copies of 88 mins for the ""butchered"" version and 99 (or 100 depending upon how you count) mins ""extended"" version will be impressed by the clear picture (mainly) of the Blu-ray, but some of the parts missing are unfortunate. The beginning material of the extended version where Howie gets the letter that sends him to Summerisle is missing. There is also a very puzzling cut in Willow's Dance after the first couple of lines. The jump is abrupt and obvious. It is not in the extended version, but it is the cut in the ""butchered"" version.

It is nice to have the scenes in what is assumed to be their proper place and order, but it would have been wonderful if ALL the existing footage would have been incorporated into the Blu-ray. Those lucky enough to have the 2 disc Anchor Bay set (either the limited edition boxed set or the ""2 Disc Set Collector's Edition"") are advised to keep them. This will give you all three available versions, unless you have a region-free player and get the English 3 disc set which has all three. There are differences in all three besides the running time.

With all the other reviews out there I don't think it necessary to explain the plot or how good the film is. To those who do not agree that this is one of the best British films ever made, I clearly disagree with you. Just compare it to most of the tripe being released in the theaters presently and the quality shines out like a beacon. The less said about the Nicholas Cage ""Remake"" the better.

Do get the Blu-ray for the clearer picture, but supplement it with the Extended version. Watching the various versions can be time consuming and a pain, but it will be worth the effort.

This original film is for me one of the most truly frightening cinema productions. It is nothing like the later feeble version starring Nicholas Cage.

If you want a lot of nudity and sexual content, this delivers, gratuitously so. If you are reading this review, you know the plot of the movie, which is the best part. The twist at the end is what makes the film. However, to praise the 1973 version as some great cinematic feat while bashing the 2006 (Nicolas Cage) version as a total flop is an utter display of bias and sentimentality. The 2006 version is better in many respects, not the least being its feminine overtures, which is more consistent with the Celtic mythology which drives the actions of the island cult. I imagine those who see the 2006 version with no knowledge of the 1973 version will find the newer version to be quite good. ""Remakes"" rarely fare well among a cult film's adherents, and those who prefer modern special effects, acting, and directing, etc., generally do not like the older and arguably ""cheesier"" films.

588646,3,6303149200,"I love Ingrid Pitt and Britt Ekland--and they are the two primary reasons to witness 1973's ""The Wicker Man."" Yes, Edward Woodward is quite strong here (he wouldn't be the Equalizer if he weren't), and I respect the great Christopher Lee as a horror movie villain. But people on this webpage are snowing you most likely. ""The Wicker Man"" is a one-joke idea (sort of like ""Rosemary's Baby,"" which is another film about religious paranoia), playing up the idea of an idiot-detective being duped by a colony of neo-Pagans who are ten times more intelligent than he is. It is sort of insulting to Christianity, but more so towards ancient religions--which is not a problem for me (since I find sacrifice, particularly animal sacrifice, unbearably horrible and primitive to a point beyond idiocy). The problem is, the climactic joke is not funny, and the supposedly clever twist is not that, well...clever. If you like a script that spends its time building up a ton of details and suspenseful sequences all for naught, then this movie is for you! It was a short film concept expanded to feature length. However, the Lion's Gate DVD is hilarious. The extra feature spends A LOT of time explaining why certain scenes got cut, but then the distributors ended up putting the edited version on the disc (so genius boys) as opposed to the version that our mouths have been whetted to see by the detailed documentary. Sheesh...
On the bright side, the film has a lot of color, along with beautiful ladies on display (but I think if you want a better bathing scene with Ingrid in the tub, check out ""The Vampire Lovers"" instead), and some lovely background scenery to accompany its sick joke plot. The acting is generally good (don't think I didn't spot Deltoid from ""A Clockwork Orange""!) and the music is unique too. If it weren't so creepy in a negative sense, it would have been a more enjoyable movie. I appreciate its unusual qualities, but this is not a film that should be known as the ""Citizen Kane"" of horror flicks (as Bernard Herrmann was rumored to have told Friedkin when he asked the legendary composer to write him a better score for ""The Exorcist"" than he did for ""Citizen Kane,"" Herrmann replied ""Why didn't you make a better picture than ""Citizen Kane""?)

What he finds is a pagan civilization presided over by Christopher Lee, looking a bit ridiculous in a series of wigs.  And villagers cavorting in pagan fertility rituals and Maypole dances, all very amateurishly acted. He also finds Britt Eckland as the innkeeper's seductive daughter, dancing stark naked in the room next to his, rubbing herself erotically against the walls.  No one is willing to talk about the missing girl.  He does a bit of knocking on doors and sleuthing, and becomes convinced that she was offered up as a human fertility sacrifice to appease the pagan spirits after the island crops had failed.  When he tries to leave the island, he learns that the plane he flew in on has been tampered with and it would take a week by boat to return him to the mainland.  (In the context of what has gone on before, the believable motivation would have been for him to opt for the boat ride.)  The police officer's demeanor seems more than a trifle formal, stilted and pedantic, as is Anthony Shaffer's script at times.  And thin in terms of context.  Without giving away the ending, there is a rather large ruse at hand here, but without backstory and context about the police officer and exactly how or why he specifically was called upon to investigate the girl's disappearance, the payoff doesn't come across as terribly compelling.

It is cultish without being ridiculous, beautifully creepy, and of course, the twist ending was delicious, even though I knew what was coming. My heart was racing at the end!

I am one of the nerds who listens to the commentary and special features. There is a short film on this DVD that interviews the actors, producers, etc., directly, and that was a real treat.

My only complaint would be that the sound seems.. off. Perhaps it's because of the era, but the entire film sounds muted from a technical standpoint, not an artistic one.

While this is missing the commentary track that director Robin Hardy and Christopher Lee gave for the initial DVD release (for reasons unknown to me), this is still an outstanding high-def transfer. The audio is excellent, and the picture, with the exception of the added scenes for the ""Final Cut"" (which have more of a workprint look than a high-def transfer) is brilliant. Never has Summerisle looked more clear.

The added glimpses into the film given through the long interview with Hardy, as well as some talking-head snippets of current filmmakers that were inspired by THE WICKER MAN, such as Ben Wheatley and Eli Roth (not strangely, Neil LaBute, the director of the god-awful remake is absent), are incisive and incredibly interesting.

Needless to say, the film deserves a five-star merit on its own, with an astounding lead performance by Edward Woodward, and healthy assists by the gorgeous Britt Ekland as one of film history's seminal temptresses as well as the delightfully malevolent yet strangely beneficent Christopher Lee; an amazing screenplay by Anthony Shaffer, and Hardy's amazing direction make THE WICKER MAN a must-own for fans of psychological horror everywhere.",1390953600,6,1332,5.129032258064516

But do remember, a cult classic is by definition a problematic film. That is, it has occasional flashes of ingenuity and aesthetically compelling footage, but it also has elements that are awkward and unintentionally funny -- as in WM's tendency to become some sort of neo-Celtic musical, at the expense of fulfilling the horror genre. And the dubbed bombshell Britt Eklund as a Scottish villager?! As a badge of honor, however, pro-cultists, typically and proudly embrace eccentricities of the off-beat films they treasure, and are always happy to overlook their shortcomings.

The oh-so-1970s emerging hedonism and the ancient-yet-counterculture paganism that drove a good part of Wicker Man, plus the radically diametrically opposites of the uninhibited pagans vs a stock authority figure - a sexually anxious virgin Christian policeman no less, washes out any nuance that might have made this what serious horror devotees long for: a thinking person's horror film. Further, one of its makers, Anthony Shaffer, is a trick-dependent, surprise-ending writer, as witnessed in his play/film *Sleuth.* And director Robin Hardy was making his first film in *Wicker Man,* and I found some of its irregular successes are more due to the fortuitous outcomes of his enthusiastic naivete, i.e. happy accidents -- than to cinematic mastery.

As for REAL horror classics, few movie goers know about Carl Dreyer's 1932 *Vampyr,* a horror film where mood, image, atmosphere and set design consistently undergirded this film, freely adapted from the Victorian short story *Carmilla* by noted horror author Joseph Sheridan Le Fanu. Dreyer's genius also took him to make *The Passion of Joan of Arc,* a hands-down masterpiece in the history of cinema. Ranging from horror to Catholic mysticism accompanied by another kind of sacrifice (very dissimilar to the one in WM!!) both *Vampyr* and *Passion* are visionary and demanding, and they certainly are  NOT problematic in the manner of ""cult classics.""",1389657600,3,2170,5.317784256559767

588751,3,6303149200,"The legendary & brilliant 1973 British thriller ""The Wicker Man"" has unfortunately had one of the most storied release histories of almost any other film in existance. The initial director's cut of the film was 102 minutes. When the studio felt that the movie was too slow and hard to grasp at times, they cut the film down to 88 minutes for its theatrical release. Some scenes especially in the North American version got shuffeled around and the plot became kind of tough to follow in the early going. For a long time, this was the only version that was available on video until Anchor Bay about a decade ago released a 2 disc DVD special edition that contained both the heavily truncated 88 minute theatrical release as well as an almost 100 minute version that to date is the closest any release has come to the heavily sought after 102 minute director's cut. Since the original negative was lost quite some time ago for the long version, Studio Canal (who Anchor Bay licensed the rights from for the North American DVD release) had to splice in the missing scenes from a lesser quality version but the audio stayed the same. It was highly watchable and most importantly restored all of the missing prologue sequences showing police seargent Howie on the mainland prior to flying to a remote island to investigate a missing little girl.

Earlier in 2013, it was announced that a print of a 94 minute version of the film was found and that this version had actually been prepared by the director for release in North American in the late 70's. While this version only keeps the bit of Howie going to church prior to his flight to the island in question, all of the events of the movie are in their proper order though there are bits here and there still missing out of this version. A full HD restoration of the 94 minute cut was prepared and released in a limited theatrical run as well as in a 3 disc deluxe British edition containing the 94 minute and 88 minute cuts in full HD as well as the 100 minute version in standard definition only. A huge documentary was included in addition to some nice interview extras on the main disc as well as a restoration comparison.

Lionsgate though for some reason decided in their infinite wisdom for the North American release to leave out the 2nd and 3rd discs from the Britsh set and only include the 1st ""Final Cut"" disc of the film containing the restored in HD 94 minute cut. So, if you were one of the lucky ones like me to get the Anchor Bay 2 disc set as it was limited to a run of only 50,000, make sure to hold onto that version due to Lionsgate deciding to not port the full UK edition to American shores.

How does the 94 minute cut work? Since I'm so familiar with the almost 100 minute extended version, I do sorely miss those extra scenes. However, the information contained in the mainland prologue section concerning Sgt. Howie is given throughout the main plot of the film but it does help set up his character a lot better. The other bits missing throughout the film don't really detract from the plot but once again, being so used to the long version, I realized when every little trim was not there. The movie though still works like gangbusters even in the 94 minute cut and since the scenes are in their proper order unlike the 88 minute original theatrical release, it's easy to follow what is going on with Sgt. Howie's strange interactions with the island's inhabitants during his search for the missing girl.

The picture quality overall is stupendous though some of the extra scenes included are of a rougher quality than the rest of the film (The ""Gently, Johnny"" sequence comes to mind). But this is the best that the film has ever looked and fans will be pleased with how much of a huge upgrade in picture quality the film has received for its HD debut. The audio is presented in the film's original 1 track mono in lossless audio. Extras contain interviews with various people talking about how much they love the film as well as the film's writer, a focus on the film's famous musical score and also a restoration comparison too.

If you have a region free blu-ray player, go ahead and import in the 3 disc British set as it's the truly definitive set for this amazing film that seems to keep getting better with age over 40 years since its original release. If you don't have access to a region free blu-ray player, then go ahead and get this set but also see if you can get one of the limited edition 2 disc Anchor Bay DVD sets so you can have both the 88 minute theatrical cut and almost 100 minute extended cut too. I have no idea why Lionsgate decided to do this with the North American blu-ray release and it's also a shame that the complete 102 minute version has still not been found and possibly at this point is unlikely that it will ever be. At least the film has been preserved in some digital fashion in both its DVD and new blu-ray releases so that future generations will be able to discover this film and get to see one of the greatest and most original films ever released.",1389312000,229,5069,4.4638619201726
588752,4,6303149200,"I want to preface this review by saying The Wicker Man is one of my favorite movies of all time. It's a movie I never get tired of seeing and is immensely rewatchable. As any other Wicker Man is probably aware of, this new ""Final Cut"" can more accurately be described as the Theatrical Cut with Gently Johnny and the opening church scene thrown in. I'm not opposed to this idea though. I saw the Final Cut in theaters a few months ago when it came out and was pleasantly surprised by how well it flowed compared to the Extended Version which had been my default version to watch. It's a satisfying version of the film and is one I can imagine introducing to people who haven't seen it.

You can imagine my disappointment then when I saw that Lionsgate really did not do much with this release. There are several featurettes on this disc but that's it. The UK Blu-ray not only has a documentary but also both the Theatrical and Extended Versions. I honestly don't see why Lionsgate couldn't just add these different versions of the film on this release.

The video and audio is fantastic however. It's definitely the best the film has ever looked and sounded. A nitpick I have though with this is that apparently Lionsgate added some material that wasn't there on the Final Cut released to theaters or on the UK Blu-ray. In that version, the transition between the scenes where Howie is in the chemist shop looking at photos and the scene with him in bed while Willow dances next door flows a lot better than it does here. In this version, after the chemist scene we see Howie having flashbacks in his room of him speaking at the church from the beginning. I wouldn't mind it so much if this hadn't already been seen at the beginning of the film so it's inclusion here seems unnecessary. There are more examples of this that pop out that really strike me as lazy and careless.

I'm glad to see a classic film like this finally debut on Blu-ray but Lionsgate's release is disappointing to say the least. With the limited amount of extras, the lack of the other two versions, and the no-thrills packaging, it feels that Lionsgate just slapped this together instead of putting as much care into this release as the UK did with theirs. This is a case where I can recommend this solely if you want the film in high definition. If you're looking for a complete release though, I'd recommend picking up the recent UK Blu-ray release instead of this (if you have a region-free Blu-ray player of course).",1389052800,8,2494,4.52549889135255

The ""intended"" aspect ratio (which is the ratio of the Extended DVD version) is/was the U.K. standard 1.66:1 - this results in small black bars on the left & right of your screen (Kubricks ""A Clockwork Orange"" uses the same aspect ratio).

The new Lions Gate Blu ray aspect ratio is 1.77:1 - opening up more of the frame so that it will completely fill up your HD screen. In the opinion of most cineastes, this is NOT a good thing as Lions Gate is showing MORE than the director intended when he framed his shots.

Also, the Extended DVD version, being 7 minutes longer, allows scenes to provide crucial background information directly related to comprehending the film. In the Extended DVD version, some of the ""restored"" scenes appear a bit ""rougher"" than the 94 minute pristine sequences but, in motion, they are barely perceptible. However, take them out, and the film loses some of it's poetry.

When I pre-ordered this Blu ray, Amazon listed it as being 112 minutes, so, I thought, WOW! there's even more to this film. Now, I realize that the Extended DVD version is THE ONLY fully restored version as Robin Hardy originally intended.

The Region B locked Blu ray version is listed as: The Director's Cut: approximately 100 minutes (01.39.41) AND... again, it's aspect ratio is chopped to 1.85:1 - PLEASE... will you stop screwing with this film? Put it out in 1.66:1 @ 102 minutes and be done with it!

I am sending this back for a refund. I refuse to support ""chopped"" films and will wait until somebody does the Blu ray proper justice.

Each person must decide for themselves - hope this helps.",1389052800,10,2286,4.755050505050505

The police on the mainland of Scotland receive an anonymous note from one of their off-shore islands, saying a 13 year old girl, Rowan Morrison, has disappered over 3 months ago,  The  writer strongly suggests  that the police send someone to investigate. Two policeman arrive  by helicopter to get to the bottom of it.

Along with the policemen, we, the viewers, are grabbed by the shoulders and pulled in to a maze and led down paths that lead nowhere.  Where is Rowan?  No one, including her mother, seem to know or act very concerned.  As we are pulled through the maze looking for Rowan but not finding her, we acquire information.  The island they tell us, has a temporate climate because the ocean currents around it are warm, even this far North.  Apples are their main cash crop.  And, we find too, the islanders aren't what they seem; they're not good Christians, but stone cold pagans.  We  are also discover that the apple crop failed the previous year.  What to do?........The Wicker Man.

Tight strands of bitter humour, black playfulness, plus erotic strands of lust, (satisfied and unsatisfied,) entertwine to create a hard-edged mystery and a very superior movie.",1386892800,,1445,4.758064516129032

588794,5,6303149200,"As fans of THE WICKER MAN know, the original 1973 film exists in two versions. There is the original 102 minute version released overseas and then there is the truncated 88 minute version that played in only 3 cities in America before quickly disappearing. Unfortunately it is this truncated version that survives in pristine footage. The 102 minute VHS version isn't bad at all which is why I have issues with the composite 102 minute version that is currently available on DVD. As with the recent restoration of METROPOLIS, it bothers me when the restoration incorporates pristine and non-pristine footage, The distracting effect of varying visual quality pulls you out of the movie which is the last thing you want in a film where concentration is a necessity. In both cases complete originals exist and in the case of THE WICKER MAN the original is in much better shape so they really should have transferred it intact rather than adding the missing scenes to the 88 minute version where the difference is rather noticeable on a flatscreen TV yet a composite transfer is currently all there is. As a result I'm hanging on to my original Media VHS but of the readily available dual-versions, this particular set has the best picture and is available at a good price. There's also a nifty wooden case to boot.

It's hard to imagine that there are people out there who don't know the story especially as the core of it was seen more recently in the unfortunate Neil LaBute 2006 remake with Nicholas Cage. With over 400 other reviews to choose from there are plenty that go into the story in great detail but here is only a basic outline. A deeply religious policeman (Edward Woodward) investigates the report of a missing child on a remote, privately owned island off the Scottish mainland. The island is inhabited by modern day pagans whose joyous, happy lifestyle contrasts greatly with the dour, puritanical officer. They are led by the local squire (Christopher Lee) whose family has owned the island for generations and who actively encourages the pagan practices. Writer Anthony Shaffer (SLEUTH), twin brother of playwright Peter Shaffer (EQUUS, AMADEUS), has constructed, on the surface, a simple mystery. Police officer investigates the disappearance of a child. His investigation is obstructed by the locals. He perseveres and finds the child alive. The End. Not quite. There is much more to it than that. It is that ""much more"" that makes THE WICKER MAN the classic that it is. Great soundtrack too. If you've never seen it you should. If you've only seen the Nicholas Cage version than you really need to see it the way it was intended and this set is an excellent way to do just that.",1385856000,4,2697,4.825053995680346

Though come to think of it, I might have to reserve that sixth star for a good Director's Cut release, should such a thing ever hit the market. The studio was going through a change in ownership at the time, and apparently the new overlords felt such a need to prove they were ""in charge"" that they made pointless trouble and ridiculous demands every step of the way. And then AFTER filming, one of the new producers had the sheer gall to summon Christopher Lee (who had worked for FREE), along with his wife, to a meeting to discuss the end product, and then tell him point-blank that ""I think it's the worst film I've ever seen."" (Okay, Sir Christopher may not have been a Sith Lord or a heavy metallist at the time, but I still think that guy was lucky to escape with his throat intact.)

And yet STILL it's one of the best movies I've ever seen. (Unlike the horrid Nic Cage remake.

588911,2,6303149200,"This highly acclaimed yet sometimes reviled film boasts several impressive assets. Edward Woodward, a highly respected stage actor and alumnus of RADA, lends this work a much needed authenticity with his convincing portrayal of a police inspector in search of a crime. In the course of the movie, the viewer learns about two of his significant character traits: his religious zealotry and his determination to remain a virgin until marriage. These two traits are prominently reflected and contrasted in the depiction of the social milieu of his new environment - one as a counterpart of the devout paganism of the community and the other as an oppositional trait of the island's denizens.

Another asset is the breathtaking Scottish scenery which greatly bestows this movie a verisimilitude which can induce the viewer to believe that similar covert societies exist in inaccessible, isolated venues.

And finally, the theme of paganism is enriched by explorations of provocative tropes: conformity among all of the island's inhabitants to ensure their continued existence; exclusion of those of divergent beliefs and attitudes; and the megalomania of the island's charismatic autocrat reminiscent of those demagogic leaders of Jonestown and Nazi Germany.

But in spite of the aforementioned, this film is vastly disappointing. The direction lacks a tautness necessary to build anticipation and suspense, and certain pagan rituals are choreographed and staged far too tidily without a spontaneity to allow one to suspend disbelief. And it is unfortunate that few other actors rival Woodward's portrayal in complexity and subtlety.

It is, however, not regretted that this film was seen - as the persecution of the other to ensure the cohesiveness and longevity of a particular culture is all too prevalent today.",1380499200,,1811,5.411347517730497

588914,2,6303149200,"Sergeant Howie travels to the Scottish island of Sumerisle to investigate the disappearance of a young girl. Once he arrives, however, he's not met with cooperation. Everyone is claiming that the girl didn't exist, even the child's own mother. The sergeant refuses to be put off, though, and as he continues his investigation he discovers more and more strange inconsistencies. He even witnesses bizarre orgy type deals going down. Can the detective find the girl in time, or else her body, are are islanders being truthful after all?

The Wicker Man is a creative endeavor exploiting a unique take on the pagan religion and culture. It has several things going for it, including an amazing script that stands as shocking, thriller, and filled with well laid and subtle clues by scriptwriter Anthony Shaffer. The more viewings uncover more layers and hints of what's co come. The Wicker man also attempts a chilling sense of realism and was clearly researched well. The film is gifted with an enticing soundtrack, and director Robin Hardy managed to due an admirable job with the miniscule budget he had to work with. Acting wise every does their job well, including Lord Summerisle, played by the late Christopher Lee. It begins as an intriguing mystery, the ending is a wicked, stunning finale, and the middle is chocked to the brim with queasy, bizarre situations.

A major theme is the religious controversy and inner struggles of Sgt. Howie, played tremendously well by Edward Woodward. The strong morals and religious concepts Sgt. Howie acts as a complimentary difference between the plots role. It's difficult for the main character to understand the different actions and beliefs of the other characters, yet he does try and ignore it and just focus on the investigation for the time being. The film raises some strong questions about the nature of religious beliefs in general and the clashes of culture.

Problems I do have with this film is that the portrayal of this particular pagan religion is not one of worshiping nature and the motto of not harming life. The islanders have seem instead to have a lack of appreciation for value, life, and for the opinions of others, forming a chilling sort of cult instead of just private worship. They take and destroy and use for their own means only, disregarding another's belief. The lead Christian character was shocked and dismayed at their actions, yet he was not the one imposing beliefs or taking unwarranted steps to warrant his own views. Howie may appear a bit stiff at times, and certainly as judgmental, but he does stand as the only one who seems to have a clear sense of morality, right and wrong, and the general laws.

I believe people will get dissimilar things from this one. On one hand they may walk away happy that another alternate religion reigned supreme, others may screw their mouths up in disgust at the pagan outlook portrayed, and yet others may see it as actually a sign of what happens when people do walk away from Christianity. Yet more may just see it as the dangers of cults, having one leader, and brainwashing. All different perceptions from different backgrounds and different people, and all right.

While Christopher Lee and Edward Woodward performed their roles well, some of the acting was rather wooden and off. While the film is thought provoking, its shocking ending did not aptly wrap up the story and drive the story home with more than just dread and a feeling of unpleasant emptiness. The pace is rather slow and I found myself drifting off at a few parts. More excitement injected between good scenes would be welcome. Ekland was unable to form a decent Scottish accent, so the dubbing of her voice grew tiresome and distracting. There are also many songs in this one, almost like it's half musical, and many aren't that good.

However, it does stand as an excellent example of the dangers of strong belief in only your religion. It has been said that religion is the root of all great good and all great evil. This film portrays this as well as any other. It is certainly worth a watch and has now become a cult classic well revered by many.",1379635200,,4147,4.809256661991585

Second, as I soon learned, the movie was released in an edited and re-arranged American cut as well. I originally bought one of the American cuts, thinking it was the original I had seen as a kid. Boy, was I ever wrong. Luckily, I was able to find this beautiful box set, that includes both the re-arranged American version, with a very interesting documentary bonus feature, and the full Director's cut on a separate disc. Here, at last, is the version of The Wicker Man that I remember from my childhood, with all of the pagan philosophy, cultural musical numbers, sexuality, and mysticism that I remember.

589074,4,6303149200,"This is a quirky, sexy, mystery story, made by a small British studio on a small budget, and made in time when small productions could still get an audience, though I suspect its American audience was quite tiny. It's biggest interest is the way it foreshadows the clash of cultures that really started impacting Britain around 1990, when drug use and unmarried births got so high they began undermining most other British institutions, especially the Church.
But back to the story. I won't provide much detail, you can read that elsewhere. The police detective in the story (Edward Woodward), who is investigating the disappearance of a teenage girl, is shocked and amazed by what he learns about the people on the island community of Summerisle, because they are so contrary to the quaint ways of folks back on the Scottish mainland. Perhaps the first, and most enjoyable part of this is how everyone in the tavern sings a dirty song about sleeping with the innkeeper's daughter, just as she's leading him to his room. (The Wicker Man has three clever songs in it, so it's billed partly as a musical.) And when he tries to sleep, the beautiful daughter played by Britt Eklund, sings a siren song in the next room, trying to entice him to come. Her singing is rather good, as is her naked dance of joy.
As he continues his investigation, the detective uncovers more suspicious evidence the young girl was murdered and the townspeople are in collusion, covering for it. His disbelief doubles and triples as he witnesses cult dances to pagan gods, and no sign of any Christian worship. Everything seems confirmed when he meets the Lord Summerisle, played by Christopher Lee and looking very foppish in his 70's era coif. The Lord explains how the Island must continue its reclaimed pagan religion to keep the apple crops coming, their main export.
Determined to find the truth, the detective plots how to break through the Lord's and the people's lies. But little does he know, the joke is on him.
So I recommend this flick as an interesting diversion, if you can live with the small production values. It's well made, has some good acting and has a fun, but ultimately frightening story.",1372204800,,2187,4.788359788359788

I realize now that The Wickerman requires some acclimation, like stepping into a cold swimming pool. Within the first 20 minutes
 or so, it begins to cast a strange and endearing spell, especially with the introduction of Willow. Britt Eckland is stunning, and her strange dance of seduction is hypnotic. Poor Sgt. Howie! The Wickerman is more suspense than horror, but the tension builds effectively and the climax took me by surprise. The acting

Wicker Man is a much finer film with no special effects and no gore, yet it stands up much better than The Exorcist, relying on the suggestion that these happy pagans living their blissful life on their island aren't all they seem to be.  Ed Woodward is a hero to sympathize with, a highly moral (and devout) man who is completely out of his element among these people who, he suspects, have sacrificed a child and may be set to sacrifie someone else (guess who the intended victim is).  Christopher Lee (most famous as Dracula and Count Dooku) predictably turns in a fine performance as the suave but evil ""lord"" of this pagan island.

589169,4,6303149200,"There can never be a complete restoration of THE WICKER MAN, for the original negatives have been lost--but there have been at least three different cuts: the original studio cut; a slightly restored cut that includes a few additional minutes; and a presumably final cut that relies on an almost-complete American print.  This particular cut seems to be the first or second cut, and buyers in search of the final cut should look for the double DVD release.  But whatever the cut, the basic film and its qualities remain very much the same, a little shocking, a little intriguing, and ultimately very, very disturbing.

The story concerns a police sergeant (Edward Woodward) who is sent to investigate the disappearance of a child at an isolated and privately owned community on Summerisle.  The inhabitants seem kindly enough, but they are obstructive to the investigation, and the very straight-laced and conservative Christian sergeant is shocked to discover that they practice a form of paganism that reeks of sex.  He also comes to believe that the missing child has become a victim of these religious practices and will be sacrificed due to a poor harvest.  Can he find her and get her off the island before it is too late?

The cast is exceptional.  Edward Woodward is memorable as the stiff Sergeant Howie; Christopher Lee, as Lord Summerisle, considers this his best performance and his best film.  Supporting players Britt Eckland, Ingrid Pitt, Diane Cilento, and Irene Sunter are memorable, with Eckland particularly so as the flagrantly sexual inn-keeper's daughter Willow.  Although the script is occasionally a bit silly--Lord Summerisle's explanation for the island's paganism is absurd--it is remarkably effective, and the sound and look of the film is remarkably seductive.  And if you don't see it coming, the final five minutes will spin your head around.  Not to be confused with the dreadful 2006 remake with Nicholas Cage.  Recommended.

I loved all the unspoken references and nods to pre-Christian religion in the background, the film was just saturated with it in quiet ways that largely go over the heads of those who aren't familiar with pagan relics, practices, and history of western Europe.  The way it was done was very respectful and was not offensive to modern-day neo-pagans, I would think.

I don't think I agree with the designation of ""Horror"" category.  Mystery, Suspense, Thriller, any one of those would have been more fitting.

I''m glad that was the version I saw first before buying this abbreviated one, otherwise I would have missed out on a few subtleties.

I'm not so good with writing movie reviews, but I will say simply that if you have a healthy appetite for a little bit of corniness, a tolerance for watching other cultures through a non-Judeo-Christian lens, and an appreciation for reserved and restrained acting delivery (for the most part)... then you might find yourself enjoying this film.",1353024000,4,1258,4.609865470852018

In both movies the locales are otherwise ordinary and people populating those locales may be a little eccentric but can not be considered to be seething with evil, but as the protagonist (Mia Farrow or, as here, Edward Woodward) journeys through the movie, they most assuredly are. This is a horror film, a thriller in the best possible way, but not as that genre has been corrupted in its present state. What passes off as a horror film these days is a serial slasher movie, where the only question is who will be killed, when and how. In The Wicker Man, the motivations, thoughts, -- what is really going on -- is constantly at doubt, until, of course, the final act.

The general plot is that a straightlaced policeman travels to an isloated Scottish island to find a missing girl. While as the movie progresses it because obvious he has arrived at a black hole, the well-drafted screenplay keeps the viewer guessing until the very end. Christopher is especially creepy as the overlord of this pagan oasis. To this day, he considers this movie his personal favorite. Aside from its generally unsettling atmosphere, The Wickmer Man can be seen as a clash of civilizations of the most ancient kind, and one thought to have been resolved hundreds of years ago, that of Christianity verses Paganism.

There is a longer version of The Wicker Man available, and that version is preferable to the more common shorter version, if only because it keeps the viewer's suspense longer. Either version is highly recommended.",1347580800,2,1616,4.830324909747293

For a film in the horror genre, ""The Wicker Man"" comes very close to being an integrated musical, but does so with (largely) subtle wit and without undercutting the growing sense of menace which is quite a trick. The music credit for move goes to ""Magnet"" which may be an obscure celtic group which is capable of throwing in a little psychedelic guitar as needed or Magnet may be a collective name for some studio magicians and a few of the celtic musicians who appear on camera in the film; either way the music itself is catchy and evocative the region and the people it presents, but the way the music is incorporated produces an interesting hybrid, a film that is not quite a musical horror movie but something not far removed from that either. Take a look at the scene titled ""Siren's Song"" in the scenes index, which features Britt Ekland as a character named Willow singing and tapping on the wall of the room in which Edward Woodward's sexually repressed police sergeant is attempting to sleep and you certainly can't help but note how erotic the scene is but you may not stop to consider how odd it is to see a scene in a horror movie that would fit right into a film with Bob Fosse choreography.

The people who inhabit the island are polite and seem like ordinary folk except it's apparant they are giving Howie the runaround.

""Wicker Man"" is the type of film that will absolutely give a viewer nightmares. It concerns a police sergeant (Woodward) who responds to a missing child report on a remote Scottish island. The residents of Lord Summerisle's (Lee) quaint village uniformly deny the existence of 12-year-old Rowan Morrison (Cowper). The more Sgt. Howie investigates and bullies his way around, the weirder this tale gets.

Clearly, these folks are pagans who practice an ancient religion based on phallic worship. Lyrics to the many lovely folk songs performed by them throughout the story are incredibly bawdy, children dance naked in public, hedges are trimmed to tumescent member perfection and there's an elaborate May Pole ceremony due to culminate in ritual sacrifice. Howie's convinced its sacrificial lamb will be the missing child. He dons a giant-headed ""Punch"" costume and so-disguised leads the parade, all the time watchful for Rowan's appearance.

What awaits is the Wicker Man himself and an unforgettable ending. A superb film, indeed!

I don't even know if it was a good movie. The characters were so annoying, the basic premise so overblown and browbeaten that within a few minutes I could find nothing in any scene to rest my eyes on. Maybe that was the point.

What makes The Wicker Man a horror film, since it lacks psychos, monsters, magic, supernatural powers, or the paranormal?  The film is more of a mystery than a horror flick, but seen through the eyes of the films hero, Inspector Howie, it most certainly is horror.  In this respect, it's a culturally subjective horror film, for any good pagan would watch this without so much as a flinch or a shutter.

The movie takes place on a beautiful island off the coast of Scotland.  Warmed by the Gulf Stream Winds, it is a place known for it's prodigious fruit production.  Inspector Howie is summoned to the island to investigate the possible murder of a young girl.  It's a frustrating mystery as Howie tries to figure out what has become of her, and his inquiries inadvertently uncover that the people here are no longer Christians and have reverted back to the beliefs and practices of their pagan ancestors.

This is greatly upsetting to Howie.  Howie is the sort of man who has made self control and reason his life's purpose.  He is a true Apollonian, a believer in the seriousness of life.  He has worked hard to become an inspector, is due to be married, is a very faithful Christian, and has maintained his sexual purity.  Counter to this are the locals, revelers in the ways of Dionysus, people who enjoy life, singing and dancing, a people for whom the ceremonies and morals of Christianity mean nothing, a people who have little need for the modern, civilized way of life.

To make matters worse, it is spring, and so in true pagan form, the people are preparing for the islands fertility rites.  Couples make love in the open, children sing songs about procreation, phallic symbols are everywhere.  If this were not enough to turn Howie's stomach, he also has to contend with the buxom waitress in his hotel.  Not only does she flirt with him every chance she gets, but she even stoops so low as to blatantly invite the chaste inspector for a night of fun in her room, singing softly to him through the bedroom wall while dancing nude in some sort of sexual ritual.  Yeah, it's a great scene!

Howie doesn't take the bait, nor does he ever come to terms with anything he witnesses on the island.  His horror is so great he threatens to turn their whole society inside out as punishment for their wicked ways, till he finds the pagan leader, Lord Summerisle, who politely reminds Howie that nothing illegal is taking place, and so he has no recourse.  Unless that is, he can find the body of the young girl whom Howie suspects was some sort of sacrifice.

If you have seen the new remake of the movie, you'll have an idea of what happens next, but you should still see this movie.  It is one of the most well made films ever made, in any genre of movies.  Much of this has to do with the fantastic script and acting, but even more so with the interesting subject material and setting.  The pagan rituals, songs, fetishes and lifestyle are stunningly captured.  The film's crescendo is at the end with the May Day festive ushering in the spring, where everybody dresses up, more sexual insinuations are made, and Howie reaches his boiling point.  When all these elements are tied together, you end up with a beautiful movie that is entirely fascinating.

Like I said before, your take on the film may be entirely subjective.  I felt like I wanted to take sides in this, and I certainly believe there is a polar duality at play here that is hard to remain nonpartisan through.  At times I sympathized with Howie, and it's hard not to.  But he comes off as a jerk mostly, and the locals increasingly become more likable.  It's not till the end that you may find your opinion of Howie really changes once everything becomes clear and his destiny unfolds.  This is where the new Wicker Man really screwed up.  The original really hits the point home and the end is breathtaking, a true work of art that words can not justify.",1318204800,5,3943,4.563300142247511
589279,4,6303149200,"Edward Woodward plays a British police officer (Sgt. Howie) who's sent a mysterious letter asking him to find out about the disappearance of a young girl named Rowan Morrison. Rowan lives in a faraway, insulated island community called Summersisle, ruled by a man named, appropriately enough, ""Lord Summersisle."" Woodward isn't just your ordinary, run of the mill police officer but a Bible-thumping, hardcore Christian. He's so hardcore, in fact, that even though he's well past the age of 30, he has remained a virgin to ""save himself"" for marriage.

Woodward sets out to Summersisle in a police plane and starts investigating. Problem is that the people of Summersisle almost immediately give him the runaround about Rowan's existence. But that isn't the worst of it. The island community also seems to be a few fries short of a a happy meal, because every single thing they do, sing, or say seems to be involved with sex. Because of this, poor ""devout Christian"" Howie has to spend several nights enduring the raunchy ballads and rituals of Summersisle locals. Even locked in his room, he isn't safe-- one night, the innkeeper's daughter tries to seduce him!

Just what *is* Summersisle, anyway? Is it some hippie commune practicing ""free love""? Nope-- far from it. And when Howie investigates further as to what the people of Summersisle are really about, that's when the fun really begins! But I'll leave you to see the movie to find out for yourself.

Because I'd already seen the abysmal 2006 Nicolas Cage remake, this movie didn't pack as much of a punch as it could have, since the plot twists and shocking ending had already been spoiled. In spite of knowing what was going to happen, though, I still found plenty of surprises in this film to keep me sufficiently entertained. This is because The Wicker Man is probably one of the quirkiest things I've ever seen, next to ""Devil's Rain."" Actually, quirky doesn't even begin to describe it! From the ""lewd"" musical numbers (yes, there are musical numbers) to the parade where the people of Summersisle are wearing animal masks and medieval costumes, it is downright weird, but in a really cool way. Unfortunately, some of today's more cynical movie watchers might snort at derision at all this weirdness, but I found it more imaginative if anything.

Another thing that was great about this film was Edward Woodward's performance. For the first 2/3rds of this film, he does such an incredible job portraying Howie as an insufferable jerk that half the time you're screaming, ""Just leave them alone, you idiot!"" and the other half you're just dying for someone to punch his lights out. And yet when you watch the final scenes, Woodward conveys so much humanity that after hating his guts for most of the film your heart weeps for him. I can't remember any performance in recent memory where an actor was *that good*, where he could have the audience booing for a character for so long and yet get it to sympathize with him in the end.

At any rate, needless to say I really enjoyed The Wicker Man. I don't think everyone *will* enjoy it, though, because it definitely is an acquired taste. However, I do recommend anyone who's seen the Nicolas Cage remake to see it, if only for the curiosity factor. It may not provide the same amount of ""unintentional laughs"", but it will definitely offer a much better cinematic experience.",1313798400,4,3386,4.841105354058722

While the VHS version definitely makes more sense, I found something peculiar between the two cuts.  I noticed that after the Bret Ekland seduction scene on the shorter version, the following morning cuts to her & the Sergeant in his room where a little dialog takes place.  She inquires as to his refusal to take her up on her ""invitation"" the night before, at which time he confesses to being a virgin.  This little tidbit of information reinforces the reason he has been chosen.  This scene does not appear in the longer version, but instead after her attempt at seduction, cuts to the scene which occurs AFTER the Ekland-Sergeant scene in the shorter one.  Via editing, I now have my own compete version!",1308441600,,836,4.614864864864865

589282,4,6303149200,"Perhaps the cult film to end all cult films -- due to the fact that it is a cult film that concerns, well, a cult -- ""The Wicker Man""* is a highly influential and surreal story about a devout Christian police officer sent to a remote island in Scotland in search of a missing girl. Things go awry, as not only does the hedonistic way of life these islanders enjoy clash with that of the officer's beliefs, but also because no one will tell him the truth about what happened to or what will become of the missing child.

Filmed entirely on location in Scotland, ""The Wicker Man"" has a sense of authenticity that is driven home by a pair of knock-out performances in Edward Woodward and the legendary Christopher Lee. Woodward, as the would-be hero, keeps things grounded even at their most bizarre and ridiculous. His grim facial expressions and looks of horror say it all. Lee, on the other side of the coin, is playing the enigmatic leader of the cult, and is certainly in his prime in one of his finest roles. Elsewhere, the acting ranges from questionable to non-existent, but because these two men deliver in spades, the film rarely suffers.

Granted, there's a wealth of musical numbers that make things a bit awkward, but maybe that's the intention. Afterall, most of the film seems aimed at catching its audience off-guard and creeping it out, and to that end, it certainly succeeds. Even nearly forty years later, it still manages to at least make you uncomfortable one way or another, whether it's through the unassuming scenery, the outrageous costumes and rituals or simply in its shocking ending that will certainly leave you with a little extra left to chew on. ""The Wicker Man"" is quite simply a unique horror film that is must-see material. Whatever you feel after watching the film, you'll certainly be affected one way or another, and that's the film's ultimate brilliance.

589324,1,6303149200,"It should be of great interest to any fan of horror and of British cinema that this wonderful film is available at such a great price. What is frustrating and disappointing, what is more perplexing is the choice of including a half hour featurette on the making of this classic that includes the story of how it was edited for American audiences. It makes no sense to included a video of cast and crew telling you that you are about to watch or have watched the incomplete version of this seminal horror film.

In addition to this strange lack of missing footage in light of a discussion of it is the rather poor quality of the print. It is in mono, and a rather old print, not the original complete one. Depending on who you ask, there is anywhere from 13 to 20 minutes edited out for commercial release in American theaters.

Considering it cult status as one of the brightest and truly original moments in horror film, it is bizarre to see so many fans writing up this DVD transfer with such sparkling praise.

Co-starring Ingrid Pitt and Britt Eckland, this is a brilliant and unique horror mystery thriller import from the UK that has gained critical acclaim and a cult following since then.

589326,5,6303149200,"This film is an obscure, beautiful, and eerie piece of art. It still remains a small cult favorite, and critics have called it the ""Citizen Cane of horror films."" However, this movie is too complex to be lumped into that category of horror. The only reason that it is considered horror is because of the casting of Christopher Lee and Ingrid Pitt, regulars in the Hammer series. I urge any fan of underground/cult cinema to give this movie a try. It is an intelligent religious thriller, with a twist that even though you might see it coming a mile away, the execution of this twist is breathtaking.

In case you don't know the storyline, an overly religious police officer searches for a young girl on an island where its inhabitants practice pagan beliefs that are primitive, and threatening to the officer's beliefs. The officer does not only have to save the little girl from the threat of pagan violence, he must thwart his fear of the rituals that these people practice, both by tradition and purposely against his will.

The 2 Disc Special Edition is the version to get. This film has a notorious history of being distributed in various chopped up versions. Even though the 88 minute version (the one that is most readily available) is still good, this disc contains both that and a 99 min print(Oddly referred to as the 102 minute version) that restores many scenes of crucial value.

The Wicker Man (1973) is a strange, I mean VERY strange horror movie.  It stars Edward Woodward, Britt Ekland, Diane Cilento, Ingrid Pitt, and Christopher Lee.  A police sergeant is investigating a young girl's disappearance on a remote island called Summerisle.  The islanders practice Celtic neopagan cult rituals with animal sacrifices and the supernatural, which the sergeant finds disturbing.  The movie is upbeat at times, scary at times, and gets more and more bizarre as it progresses, but it's definitely entertaining and will hold your attention.

There is a lot of nudity.  Topless women and nude women dancing.  There is full nudity at times.  There are couples screwing in a churchyard at night and one scene shows a naked woman crying next to a tombstone.  This is one of those bizarre early '70s British films.  The Wicker Man is the centerpiece late in the movie and the ending is quite bizarre.

This DVD is in widescreen and has a featurette called ""The Wicker Man Enigma"", which is all about the movie and how it came to be.  Also included is the theatrical trailer, TV spot, radio spots, talent bios, and is closed captioned in English.

589328,5,6303149200,"Anthony Shaffer's iconic 1973 classic starring the perfectly-cast Edward Woodward and Christopher Lee (in his best-ever role), Ingrid Pitt and Britt Ekland (overdubbed because she couldn't get her Scottish accent right and body-doubled in her nude scene) is one of the most original independent British films ever made. Little of useful substance can be added to the many excellent reviews of the film posted here without indulging in repetition; but if you're interested in film and have never seen ""The Wicker Man"", then you can now experience the full, uncut 100-minute film in its entirety for the first time.

Having seen the shortened ""theatrical"" version of the film on its cinema release in 1973 paired with Nicholas Roeg's ""Don't Look Now"", I had waited many years to see the lost footage. Well, here it is offered on its own disk, as the ""director's cut."" It's definitely the better version, with the initial ten extra minutes showcasing Sergeant Howie's life on the mainland, his chaste and traditional relationship with his fiance (anachronistic even in 1973), religious zeal singing in church, and the quiet mockery of his unassailable Christian faith from police colleagues. Howie opens and reads the fateful letter, addressed specifically to him, from an anonymous Summerislander informing him that Rowan Morrison is missing: this makes the plot development and shocking denouement all the more poignant, as the audience realises it's all been planned and Howie tested by the islanders to ensure he's fully what he appears to be. Other short but important scenes are restored to the middle of the running time, deepening the narrative and making the film more coherent.

The restored minutes are of lower image quality than the rest of the film, as the original high-def master was lost forever - suspected to be accidentally discarded by a careless engineer and unintentionally buried beneath the new M3 motorway construction. Roger Corman's personal copy was the only source available for the missing scenes, and you'll be able to tell the restored scenes right away due to the quality difference.

The original butchered cinema release version is also included on its own disk, along with some interesting extras including a truly excellent 50-minute documentary narrated with intelligence and insight by respected film critic Mark Kermode. Finally, there's also a separate CD of the soundtrack with all the original film's extraordinarily atmospheric music.

Through the decades, this eccentric 1973 masterpiece has gone from strength to strength and found newer audiences who appreciate its originality, iconoclastic theme, witty and realistic script and shocking ending. It's like no other film ever made, and it works brilliantly. This 3-disk set is the best edition we're ever likely to see, and well worth buying.

Neil LaBute's abysmal 2007 ""remake"", starring Nicholas Cage and departing completely from the original film's delightful nuanced complexity to descend into a hopeless, risible schlock-horror flick, should be avoided at all costs.

I was dismayed to find that apparently the long cut was never released on DVD, although the commentaries by the cast and production crew somewhat make up for this. Only after you've watched the commentary and read the CD companion booklet, can you fully appreciate how excellent this film turned out to be---despite testimonials from the cast and crew that EVERYTHING seemed to go wrong during the production. Christopher Lee even made the remark that maybe the old Celtic gods worked their magic on the movie after all by the fact that it became a cult classic even though by rights it should have been an utter bust. The Wicker Man was truly British Lion's swan song.

Missing from the DVD are the beginning scene where Sgt. Howie, still in his station, reads the letter about Rowan's disappearance; the scene where Lord Summerisle induces a teenage boy to undergo a rite of passage by sending him to Willow, and then gives a florid narrative on reproduction; and the scene in which the village doctor explains to Howie that Rowan was burnt to death.

As for the storyline, Sgt. Howie's ignorance of the Old Religion is his undoing. He is a bachelor with a badge, and he doesn't realize until the very end that he's been tricked. Worse, no surrogate is available to stand in for him when he keeps his appointment with the Wicker Man.

Overall, this movie tells us some things about the tenets of the Old Religion, though any true neo-pagans who've seen this movie will readily tell you it's something of an embarrassment to them because of its over-emphasis on sex and reproduction. However, I personally studied the Old Religion since I was twelve, and as reenactments of pagan rites go, this one is pretty good. It is a must-read for anyone interested in the Old Religion or Wicca, especially the Celtic rites which seemed to survive the longest in France and the British Isles.

The Wicker Man is classed as a horror film, though I think it would best be categorized as an occult thriller. I'm not alone in lamenting that the motion picture industry sorely needs to release the long cut on DVD. After all, the people who put the soundtrack together found the original audio tracks in a storage facility where they'd been forgotten for decades---not entombed beneath the pavement of a highway as they'd feared. I hold out hope that someone in the motion picture industry will realize the fans of this movie (myself included) love it so much that we're willing to buy it in the form it was meant to be enjoyed, and the long cut will finally be available on DVD.

A young girl is reported missing on a small island off the coast of England and a Sergeant-Constable, a devoutly serious Christian, is dispatched there to look into the matter. He has to access the island by float-plane. When he arrives, it doesn't take him long to discover some elemental facts:

1. He is being passively resisted, deceived, and decoyed as he seeks information about the missing girl.

2. He is informed by an island patriarch that the islanders have suffered for some time due to poor agicultural harvests.

3. He is personally displeased to observe that the island population is clearly comprised of a pagan culture of grinning folks with an apparent taste for bawdy buxom barmaids, Maypole celebrations, and various forms of ritual sacrifice.

Things go from bad to worse for the highly-irritated policeman and then he suddenly meets with unexpected and heartening success... and then things get *really* creepy!

The ""Citizen Kane"" of horror films.  Edward Woodward is upstanding, decent Police Sergeant Neil Howie, an English outsider who flies in to investigate the disappearance of a 12 year old girl on Summerisle off the West coast of Scotland.  His world is slowly turned upside down as he plunges ever deeper into the primitive, nature worshipping community only to discover the missing girl is the bait and he is the prey. A paranoid, occult thriller featuring Chrisopher Lee as Lord Summerisle and an au naturelle Britt Ekland.  Directed by Robin Hardy from a masterful screenplay by Anthony Schaffer.

The plot is simple: The scene is an isolated Scotland on an island fairly far off from the coastline. A religiously conservative detective (Edward Woodward) is sent to investigate an annoymous tip that a young girl has disappeared from the island. He finds himself in a small community that practices Paganism from birth to death (they don't call it ""death."") It is even taught in the classroom, to the exclusion of all other religions. There are signs & symbols of ""The Craft"" everywhere. The community is lead by the Lord of the Manor, and played by veteran horror film actor, Christopher Lee. The detective soon uncovers a sinister plot & finds himself its target.

The music is interesting with many songs related to various Wiccan practices. It enhances the illusion that traditional Paganism was all joy & light, fun & frolic. One of the more messmerizing scenes involves a beautiful, naked young female devotee casting a seductive spell on Woodward. It is very erotic & convincing.

There are many artistic examples of Pagan symbolsism & practives (the Maypole is great.) My favorite scene is the one where Christopher Lee is leading a procession dressed like The Goddess. All Christopher Lee fans (I'm one) gotta see this!

I say the film presents a negative view, because it shows a certain callous insensitivity to animals in general--and the detective in particular. It also illustrates just how insular a community can become when it follows one religion at the expense of others. The Children of Innocence & Light are revealed to be much closer to cruelty & darkness.

Nonetheless, I really reccomend this movie to all people interested in history, religion, sociology, and occultism.

PS. I would NEVER pay the discontinued price of 69 BUCK$ for this film.

589380,4,6303149200,"There are several ways to approach this creative, somewhat shocking film.  The photography and folk music in the beginning of the film, with the gorgeous Scottish countryside as the police investigator (Ed Woodward) is flying towards Summerisle and to an adventure that not only will shock and surprise him, but challenge him to the core of his being.  At first blush, looked like one of those trippy hippie films.  Not.

But a musical?  There are several songs sung that reflect the sexual worship, Wiccan principles and the general ignorance of Christianity, something our police officer hero cannot abide, and at times loses it.  The landlord's daughter is almost a cliche.  You know the story of the salesman who sees the farmer's daughter, blah blah (you've heard the jokes).  Well, Brit Ekland (and her body double, but why??) sings a few songs out herself, although the editing left much to be desired, the lip synch didn't work for me.  The suppressed carnal desire of our ""virgin man"" was amazing and humorous in many ways.

The Wicker Man is used in human sacrifices -- animals and even people are shoved into the giant Wicker statue and burned alive to appease the gods of the Sun and harvest.  No spoilers here, but our Scottish Christian is in for some dangerous times in his quest for the missing girl.  At first the natives deny Rowan Morrison's existence, then say she died and then finally she does appear -- in a most unusual and horrific way for our policeman.

A hard film to categorize, which is what makes it fascinating: It has horror elements, insanity, religious connotations, the realization that not all of Britain fell to the Christian influences, that the old gods still influence, that it's a musical, that it has some gratiutous nudity without being tasteless, etc.

Yes, it is dated in many ways, but I suggest the viewer see this with an open mind and enjoy the show.  You just might realize how reason and common sense don't always work when appeasing the gods.

The film has quite a backstory too, which is why you should pick up the two disc version.  Also there's a British and a shorter American version.  Roger Corman helped distribute the film in the USA and Christopher Lee, who considers Wicker Man his best work, did the film for free!  More tidbits abound, you gotta check this out.",1255824000,5,2326,4.7556109725685785
589381,3,6303149200,"First- watch the extended version even though the added scenes weren't remastered and are poor picture quality. Here it goes- the Wicker Man is a well-thought out and finely cast picture that falls between horror and psychological mystery. Christopher Lee is great as is the actor portraying Howie, the policeman who's curiosity eventually leads him to a horror he couldn't have imagined even though i saw it coming. A big plus must be given to the soundtrack which is one of the best youll ever hear(a mix of celtic folk and eerie instrumentals) costumes and the plot but where the film falls short in my eye is the lack of background on the islands pagan rituals- it briefly explained but not enough to back the story.  Sensuality and simplicity transforms into lunacy and murder without any realistic reasoning. Its very vague and also the prochristian counter message of the lead is a bit annoying. Wicker Man is a good Sunday movie - slow but keeps you interested and though i feel its worth seeing , it is by no means the classic its been made out to be. Rent it or get it cheap( i found mine at a garage sale for 4$ ). As a bonus theres some great camera shots- some shapely nude women and nice scenery.

589415,3,6303149200,"The Wicker Man is rich in symbolism and effective in its delivery..
It is clear what the main character is struggling with - he is a christian who cannot get used to the idea that at heart he is guided by natural forces.. this struggle is very beautifully represented in the scene where the girl next door is making a not so subtle declaration of erotic intention and the police officer is very obviously pained by his own desires..
Later on in the film the phallic symbol is thrown in our face even more deliberately and obviously the man once again recoils in horror at the way nature is embraced by this culture. Other male symbols are also present - the sun is one of the oldest of masculine archetypes.. as are any circular forms and rituals..
The ending of the film is probably what shocked audiences the most at the time of release.. and release is a fitting for the feeling this scene gives to me.. the man has sacrificed all his desires and this is the very core symbol of his self sacrifice.. of course, realized in an external way in order to show the internal.. its all very dream like and precise..
Now for my criticism... I find this film to be very good but at times I feel a complete lack of emotion even though the film is dealing with a very emotional struggle.. I felt no sympathy for the main character.. and even in feeling detatched I did not feel that I had any clearer vision than I would have if I were more connected.. I think if I could identify with the feelings of shock and horror - if I could feel the man's christian sensibility as if it were my own (which it is not) I would be more horrified at the end... so I guess i would recommend this to christian viewers who may have also been shocked by the exorcist.
What I did enjoy about the film was the almost Jung like layers of archetypical ritual.. I think it is a very good movie - but I cannot be among the many who consider it a masterpiece.",1244419200,4,1927,4.26775956284153

589417,1,6303149200,"I first heard about the Wicker Man in Full Circle's ""Top 9 Movie Songs"" countdown, placing it as #1 with ""Willow's Song"". I decided to see it because it was one of the few movies that paid attention to Paganism. I myself(teresa's daughter) am a pagan(wiccan respectively) and thought this movie would do a good job with the subject. I was proven wrong instantly. The antagonization of paganism really caught me off guard. Obviously, too many people non-cinematicaly antagonize paganism anyway, so i should have seen it coming. But i could easily guess I'm one of the few people who didn't turn a suspicious eye or scowl with disgust at the ""blasphemy"" of the pagan rites. I especially dislike the scenes involving the may-pole and the school. First, the may pole has nothing sinister about it whatsoever except in the eyes of people who's mind is clouded by their desire to snip out any sign of blasphemy in the world. Second, i don't see anything wrong with teaching the phalic symbolism of the may pole. To each their own beliefs, and this community, no matter how un-PC, is no exception. Besides children are already taught related matters about that age in Sex-Ed anyway! I am actually suprised at how unreactive the pagan community was to this movie. I don't know or care how accurate the more ""sinister"" pagan practices in the movie are, it's a bad thing(and i can't believe i'm saying this) to portray paganism in such a negative way. We need more positive movies about the pagans to clear our name. To clear up any misconceptions any ignorant people had about the craft and our beliefs, we don't hurt or manipulate people using or in the name of the craft, especially burning people in giant wicker men or using magick to seduce mates for our sexual pleasure. By the way, i saw no horror in this film whatsoever, just bull-headedness. I can confidently say the only redeemning quality of this film is the music. The celtic feel is really entrancing, just enough to make me consider purchasing the soundtrack on iTunes. Willow's song in particular is very catchy. All in all, I mean no offense to the reader of this review whatsoever, my first thoughts of the movie were, ""How can this piece of crap be so popular?!"" My response to myself was that the men were too busy looking at all the nude women, and the rest were giving plaudits to how pro-christian and anti-anything else this movie is. I saw this movie only one, and i don't plan to ever see it again. To those looking for a horror film with good music, put this piece of crap down and look for Sweeney Todd, all people interested in the paganism should step away and pick up the Mists of Avalon. Anybody else, look away from this page, forget what you saw, and seek another film. This has to be the most over-rated film since Citizen Kane(which by the way was compared to the wicker man. Interesting connection...). Long story short, if i could give this movie 0 stars, i would! )0(",1239321600,5,2948,4.617142857142857
589418,5,6303149200,"The original release of Robin Hardy's occult classic THE WICKER MAN was missing 11 crucial minutes. These have been restored here.

""Wicker Man"" is the type of film that will absolutely give a viewer nightmares. It concerns a police sergeant (Woodward) who responds to a missing child report on a remote Scottish island. The residents of Lord Summerisle's (Lee) quaint village uniformly deny the existence of 12-year-old Rowan Morrison (Cowper). The more Sgt. Howie investigates and bullies his way around, the weirder this tale gets.

Clearly, these folks are pagans who practice an ancient religion based on phallic worship. Lyrics to the many lovely folk songs performed by them throughout the story are incredibly bawdy, children dance naked in public, hedges are trimmed to tumescent member perfection and there's an elaborate May Pole ceremony due to culminate in ritual sacrifice. Howie's convinced its sacrificial lamb will be the missing child. He dons a giant-headed ""Punch"" costume and so-disguised leads the parade, all the time watchful for Rowan's appearance.

What awaits is the Wicker Man himself and an unforgettable ending. A superb film, indeed!

Not a supernatural horror movie by any means, ""The Wicker Man"" is instead a creepy, eldritch crime thriller about a priggish Scottish policeman's attempt to rescue a missing girl from an island run by paganists.  This morally hidebound cop can't believe what he comes up against when he meets a smirking Christopher Lee sporting a ridiculous fright wig and his grinning pagan acolytes.  A staunch believer in Christ, a righteous man, the cop can't believe he can be destroyed by a gang of giggling pagans of all people.

Always smiling and reveling, the giddy paganists also enjoy dancing in the nude, which shocks the uptight cop as well, but their frivolity masks a deeply sinister streak, a streak dripping with menace.  These rejects from the sixties' hippie movement turn out to be nine parts Manson family members and only one part flower childeren.

The final scene with the wicker man near the beach at sunset is as shocking and weird as all get-out as well as a visual humdinger.

That more or less sums up the plot, but to call this movie horror is a little off base. I think it's better described as a dark fantasy, though it certainly draws upon the horror genre, as well as a great deal of very primal imagery from pagan history.  The end product is a bit surreal and a little creepy, though I find on repeated viewings it really starts to be more fun.  Once you're in on the joke, so to speak, you gladly follow the fool on his journey.
Christopher Lee is darkly charming in the lead role, Brit Eckland is certainly not harsh on the eyes, (Sorry if I got the spelling wrong on her name), and Edward Woodward is wonderfully strict and pig-headed (no that's not a cop crack) in his attempts to solve the mystery.
This movie has become a must-see for me every Halloween.

After a detective is sent to investigate a murder on a small island, what seems to be a normal investigation turns into a surreal nightmare. The more digging he does, the more he is subjected to the strange beliefs and views of the Pagan lifestyle.
The pagan imagery, beliefs and rituals are very accurate, as the maker of the film spent much time studying and understanding the Pagan views.

One of my favorite things about this film is it's score. There is a lot of music in it and it actually borders on being a musical, which in my opinion is not usually a good thing, but it works so well in this film setting the mood and understanding the Pagan culture I wouldn't have it any other way.

But the thing I really love about this film is the message, and how it pokes at the inaccuracies of the Christian faith. The final scene with the Christian detective praying for his life and his prayers going unanswered is extremely powerful.

The premise is so unique and interesting, and the story evolves in such a bizarre matter that I laughed at some of the film because it was so utterly ridiculous at times!

A cop from the mainland goes to a small village island, Summerisle, off the coast of Scotland.  The people seem rather perplexed by his presence as the officer comes to investigate the disappearance of a little girl, who they say never existed.  Bawdy and erotic scenes of this primitive village tempt and torture the officer as he persists in his investigation.  Even though he cannot seem to crack the case, he does discover a lot of strange rituals and behaviors of the community.  Finally, the officer finds a way to ""blend in"" with the town to attempt one last effort at solving the mystery ....

Sometimes called the ""Citizen Kane"" of horror movies, it isn't really a horror film at all.  In some ways THE WICKER MAN defies labels.  It isn't quite a horror film and it isn't completely a psychological thriller.  It isn't simply a conflict between old religion/new religion.  It is all of them and something more.  It is strange and erotic at the same time.  Sex is a major theme or perhaps more rightly, reproduction.  That is the core of the conflict and the reason for SGT Howie, ultimately, coming to Summerisle -- though he does not know it at the time.  Woodward and Lee are standout as is Diane Cilento.

A couple of items in The Wicker Man left me cold. In the first place, I found myself roughly sympathetic to the ""pagan"" islanders throughout the film. Not knowing ahead of time what the conclusion would be, I kept hoping that the police officer would ultimately come to realize that they hadn't done anything wrong at all (nor were planning to) -- that he would be shown to be rude, blustery, and offensive for having barged his way into their lives, and tried to force upon them his own morality. That the ""Christian soldier"" would realize that there are potentially good things to be learned from those outside of his own faith. But no, it turns out he was essentially right all along, and just didn't have the man power to shut down what should have been shut down. The pagans turn out to be as wicked as he'd thought they were. That was disappointing.

In the second place, I didn't like how, in the end, the police officer becomes such a vociferous advocate of his faith... it seems to make the film a conflict between Christian and Pagan beliefs, with Christianity (naturally) riding with the morally-pure hero. But the truth is that the majority of the film really has nothing to do with either accepting or rejecting Jesus Christ -- the plot could just as easily have been a Christian group being invaded by a Pagan authority. The islanders weren't villainous because they didn't believe in Christ... they were villainous because they wanted to sacrifice a human being against his will. But, the movie didn't seem to realize that, and seems to ultimately agree with our bigoted hero that being Christian = good, and being other-than-Christian = evil.

Finally, (and I know it's probably a mistake to look to closely at this for plot holes, etc., but...) it seems bizarre to me that the police officer could have thwarted the entire plot (and thus ruined their May Day plans, and future harvest), by simply giving in to the sexual advances of the hot, blond Landlord's daughter. That just... doesn't track to me, for whatever reason.

Other than those slight philosophical disappointments, The Wicker Man was a decent film to watch. It was well-acted, and there were a few times I felt genuinely uneasy. The town had something of the surrealistic and sinister feel of the Village from The Prisoner. Christopher Lee is magnificent (as usual) as the antagonistic Lord Summerisle. Defying pure category, the movie incorporates aspects of a musical, and does it well. It's pretty to look at, and the finale is appropriately stunning and horrific.

589560,5,6303149200,"""The Wicker Man"" (1973) which is known as one of the best British horror movies and has achieved the cult status since it was released over thirty years ago, is much more than just a horror. It very creatively and successfully mixes straight crime/mystery with horror, thriller, and occult drama, throwing in the elements of musical. The story (written by Anthony Shaffer) is always interesting and the characters are well developed and memorable. Where the film succeeds entirely, it is in slow build of unbearable tension that makes its final both inevitable and unbelievable.

""The Wicker Man"" follows the disappearance of a young girl on the remote Scottish island Summerisle. Sergeant Howie of Scotland Yard (Edward Woodward), the serious and rather humorless but decent man whom we would eventually identify with, arrives to Summersville to find the girl but the locals claim that she never existed. Soon he realizes that cheerful and smiling residents of the island, adults and children  led by their spiritual leader Lord Summersisle (Christopher Lee) are engaged in the pagan religion with the rituals that shock and disgust devoted Christian Howie. The film maintains sensual, creepy, ominous atmosphere throughout yet often makes you smile and in the end leaves you totally stunned. The cinematography is breathtaking, the songs and musical score are beautiful and take the important part in the plot. Even if you guess correctly where the movie takes you, you will be undeniably shocked and disturbed when you see where exactly it took you.

More than anything it shows the absolute horrofic consequences of following blindly some dumb religion or another - and I'm not referring to the paganism in this one but Christianity! Not a popular opinion I know but I had my fair share of that stupid religion over the years. The main character was a tightly wound christian copper who flinches at any sign of ""immorality"" (i.e. the wonderful sex act) and really needs to get his head out of his bible and embrace real life.

That said, the pagans are kooky as well but at least they are not ashamed of their humanity.

Christopher Lee and Edward Woodward really make this film so much better than it could have been with other actors (see recent remake with Nic Cage for proof) and I really enjoyed this slow-burning story.

Well in this version Gently Johnny, the best scene in the entire movie is missing!

Apparently most of the hype regarding the extended or un-cut version has to do with the scene Gently Johnny, a folk song and dramatization of an offering to the goddess of love, Aphrodite. The scene epitomizes the underlying theme of the movie and without it, the impressionism of this version is lacking.

Since I was anticipating this scene only to discover that it had been deleted, I have to express my disappointment not in the cinema, but the censorship. In the brilliant mind of the editors, why then did they not delete the Landlord's Daughter and the scene of her dancing?

If you are not familiar with this scene or the value of artistic integrity, try to imagine the Birth of Aphrodite by Sandro Botticelli at the Uffizi Gallery, without Aphrodite.  Then ask yourself, it it's the same and would you still be inclined to make your purchase?

Neither movie, however, is what I expected or hoped for; a statement about what is happening to missing children today, so I might cite the promoters for false advertising.

589600,5,6303149200,"The Wicker Man is a film about a pious Christian sergeant's visit to a small island off the coast of Scotland called the Island of Summerisle.  His name is Neil and he is there to investigate the disappearance of a girl.  His investigation reveals that the island is enamored with a neo-pagan religion.  They worship the sun instead of Jesus.  They engage in pagan fertility rituals instead of Neil's proud pre-marital chastity.  They believe in reincarnation where the Christian canon Neil is devoted to does not.  As if the islanders are telepathically connected, Neil receives absolutely no help from anyone in his investigation.  He gradually puts together more and more details about the inhabitants' practices and is suspicious of everyone.

A May Day festival approaches and Neil becomes concerned that the girl who is missing may indeed be the latest sacrifice to appease nature.  But as the Island owner Lord Summerisle reveals, Neil too is a virgin and is both wise and foolish.  He comes as a king representing Her Majesty's government.  He also arrives to a place of sacrifice by his own free will.  The final sequence of the Wicker Man is the ultimate warning toward blind faith.  Anyone who misses the point here, like the makers of the 2006 remake of the Wicker Man did, will clearly find little resolution in the end but others willing to enjoy and exercise their imagination a little bit will have much to mull over.

The film's music is one of its strengths and the detail of the pagan references and how they are convenient roots to many Christian traditions (i.e. Easter icons and Beltane or May Day) help to make the overall vision of the Wicker Man even more compelling.  All of the elements within the film melt together and everyone working it must've understood these ideas in perspective.

The funny thing about the Wicker Man is it is often referred to as a Horror film.  There really isn't anything else to call it but it is almost too unique and exceptional to be deemed a horror film. It isn't scary like a typical horror film is.  It doesn't elicit fear and disgust the way all other horror films have.  There are no zombies, vampires or murdering sociopaths.  There are no supernatural forces and there is little blood to be spilled.  It isn't characterized by that one note creepy music or menacing Hitchcockian suspense.  It doesn't rely on knives and masked killers stalking in the night.  It doesn't even need a seemingly indestructible villain.  The Wicker Man is a film that relies exclusively on its all encompassing atmosphere and it also relies on our own understandings of religion and faith.  It is sunny, it is bright, it is cheerful, but for all of the wrong reasons to many of us.  It is compelling all throughout.  Somehow on this island paganism resurfaced and the worshippers are fiercely and irrationally devout.  That point's layers of commentary aside, the Wicker Man is very much a horror film and it is probably more intelligent than any other movies within its genre.",1183334400,10,3022,4.804263565891473

589602,4,6303149200,"This original ""Wicker Man"" (forget about the Nicholas Cage re-make) starts like a somewhat more conventional B-horror film. There are the purposefully unhelpful townspeople on the British island where Edward Woodward is sent to investigate the report of a missing girl. There are sidelong glances and whispers. Mysterious rites are practiced. All these slightly clichd goings-on build mild suspense. But it's the twist-ending, with its awakening overturn of conventional role assignments, that is the real pay-off of the film.

What's more, Edward Woodward found the perfect defining role for himself here, even though he would probably prefer to be praised for his more ""important"" roles in Shakespearean works, in ""Breaker Morant,"" or even as ""The Equalizer"" in the TV series. But here he portrays the supreme rectitude that he always seems to be striving towards in his other screen appearances. He is a man of proper, classical demeanor - a very rare kind of man who will not betray his principles for the expedient of satisfying any passing desire. It's the role that made me a Woodward fan.

589604,5,6303149200,"I don't write reviews very often because while I'm a movie buff, I don't usually take the time to pontificate. But having seen the 2006 version of Wicker Man on DVD, I feel the need to make a few observations.

First, on the positive side:  certainly the production values of the new version are far superior to the original. It is an extremely well-crafted motion picture. The exterior shots were especially beautiful and made me want to revisit British Columbia.

At the end of the film, Ellen Burstyn's makeup and costume were a lot more convincing than Christopher Lee's getup in the original version! Even back when I first saw it in the theatre, Lee just didn't quite seem believable.

Having said this, I have serious problems with the remake. First, one of the things that made the original such an interesting film was the use of Celtic folk music. (The film takes place on Summerville Isle off the coast of Britain.) While the lyrics certainly qualify as bawdy, they are entirely appropriate to the setting of the story. The total absence of this and the orchestral score in the current version diminished both the intensity and the message of the film.

The real problem however is found in the dialog where Sister Summersisle tells Edward Malus he is to be a martyr. The dictionary describes a martyr as a person who is killed because of his or her religious or other beliefs. But as far as we know, Malus doesn't really have any religious convictions. He may be a sacrifice, but he's no martyr.

This brings us to the thrust of the original picture. The message was the battle between British forms of Christianity and Paganism. Both are done a serious disservice by the current version. In the original version, Sergeant Howie (Edward Woodward) is a passionately devoted conservative Christian. Lord Summerisle (Christopher Lee) is an equally committed pagan.

As in the current version, the police officer is tricked into coming to the island for the purpose of being sacrificed because the crops have failed. He is chosen because of his very commitment to his faith and the fact that, due to this commitment, he remains a virgin. (And yes, I know, no matter how good an actor Cage is, nobody would believe he has remained sexually pure.) So Howie as a believer represents the perfect fool for these pagans and therefore the perfect sacrifice and martyr. Sergeant Howie, unlike Malus, actually dies for a reason. Malus just dies. And while Malus has no answers for Sister Summersisle, Howie certainly has them for Lord Summerisle.  As Howie dies for his faith, he warns Summerisle that the next time the crop fails, it will be Lord Summerisle himself burning inside the Wicker Man.

The 1973 version ends with a man of honor dying for his faith and the warning that it is only a matter of time before the meaninglessness of the sacrifice will become apparent.  In the `06 revised version's ending, we are left with a dead man and nothing more.

If you have only seen the current version of Wicker Man, I strongly suggest you view the original. If you ignore the picture's dated aspects, you will find a film with great depth which presents a highly compelling and far more accurate picture of people of faith, be they Christian or pagan.",1178496000,5,3252,4.74822695035461
589605,4,6303149200,"Anchor Bay's new double disk, which includes the cut American version and the restored 99 minute version, as well as both a doc and a commentary, is the one to own of this title. Too bad they didn't find the post credit sun god image mentioned below but no doubt that will come on the three disc set in the future.

The extended version is superior (the image loss on the sections taken from the tape is minor), the story less a mystery than a steady march to doom with a still shocking climax. The American cut works except the rearranging of scenes (after you've seen the original order) looks like the director botched it up. Blame Roger Corman (who did the recut).

When I first saw it I thought it was a rather vicious attack on Paganism (Fellini was more charitable in ""Satyricon""); however on second viewing Christianity and religion in all forms are offered up for scrutiny and ridicule. It is a shame that such a daring film had such a tortured path to the light. Not the first time. You would have thought Christian churches would have financed the distribution and shown it to summer camps.

Dead right is the liveliness of the music and celebration costumes and the wonderful amateur actors of the village, who seem to be having such a good time playing such a preposterous game. It figures that a director who could get that right wouldn't work again for twelve years.

Sidenote: Britt Eckland, then married to Rod Stewart, incurred his wrath with her nudity (sometimes doubled). And it lead to no film career for her either.

589657,5,6303149200,"Firstly let me say that my Grandfather was a successful film director and I myself run a successful video production business.

In the history of my cinematic viewing experience, which is quite long, i have never seen a film which has as many memorable scenes and passages as 'The Wicker Man'.

I believe that the strength of this film lies in its successful use of all the available facets of film.

MUSIC: The composer Paul Giovanni produced a suite of beautiful and haunting songs which I can not only remember well, but can recall the lyrics to. How much music can you remember from CITIZEN KANE?

PHOTOGRAPHY: The mask wearing, the maypole, Summerisle, the seaplane's arrival, The landlord's daughter dancing - all strikingly beautiful images - and there are many more...

SUSPENSE: The plot grips you almost immediately. The Kafka-esque sense of conspiracy holds you in its spell right up until the final frame.

PROPS: I can't give away the ending, but in my view the greatest prop in cinema is used in the denouemont.

ACTING: Woodward is the star of this film, underacting excellently - his final terror is entirely believable because (at the end of the film) it is real. Suffice to say that the first time YOU see it is the first time HE saw it - and he made sure of this.

EROTICA: There is a strange erotic undertow to the film which I am not sure was even intentional. In any case, Britt Ekland's charm provide an erotic charge all of its own

SCRIPTWRITING: The script was written specifically for the film (not a book, a short story or a play) by Anthony Shaffer, who had a serious point to prove. He had always wanted to emulate his brother Peter's success and he put his heart & soul into this screenplay. This is no second rate horror flick - Shaffer's story touches the very methods that the human race employs to survive, in both spiritual and physical terms.

RHYTHM: The most undervalued of all cinematic devices, the action of this film dances delightfully, never slowing too much or racing ahead confusingly.

CHARM: An almost indefinable quality, but I believe the massive charm of the film owes a lot to an excellent atmosphere on set created by the fact that there were no 'megastars' on the film (this includes the director!) making selfish demands on others. It is a real team effort and everyone contributes everything they have.

DEPTH: I have seen this film a dozen times, and always spot something new in either the music, the scenes or the photography. If it was on TV again tonight I would tune in again.

SCENERY: I could probably watch a film about the verdant scenery of the Scottish Highlands without any kind of plot, but the village(s), buildings and interiors are quite enchanting as well.

There are even dashes of HUMOUR around (it's hard to take Chris Lee seriously in a dress!).

To sum up, both Christopher Lee & Ed Woodward insist that this is the greatest film they have ever been a part of. They are both correct.

I believe that the consise version of the film is actually better than the director's cut. I can see why the Director & his stars may have been upset that they were not consulted about the cutting, but the shortened version is almost inexplicably tighter & more convincing.

ON NO account see the Nicholas Cage remake. The one thing that made me despair most about this terrible rehash was that some people may watch the remake and decline to watch the original. The only similarity between the two is a vague parallel between the plots.

I don't think that Robin Hardy is the best director of all time. I think he was very fortunate to have this script, budget & cast, and did very well not to make a mess of it (there is some indication that he would have liked to slow it down - which would have been a mistake). He allows the film to happen and it works out very well.

I think that the powers that be (Hollywood, for instance) would like us to believe that all great films are made by great directors, but I do not subscribe to this view.

There are so many various elements which have to reach conflux in the creation of a film that more often than not, they go wrong and fail. Direction is obviously important, but it only one of these elements.

Magically, all of the elements have combined uniquely well in the film THE WICKER MAN, and we should be grateful for such miracles.",1177027200,7,4350,4.558408215661104

589659,5,6303149200,"It is difficult to say just what it is about this film that makes it so haunting. Great script, yes. great cast, yes, great soundtrack, yes, unusual and striking location, yes but there is some additional quality over and above all of these that seems to go deep into viewer at a level below the rational mind, something atavistic. Victor Burgin has written about the way that certain sequences of images in films can implant themselves in our memories and subconscious much more strongly than the narratives of which they were originally part. I would argue that The Wicker Man is unusally rich in such image sequences. The animal masks, the gathering of the villagers, the seacliffs at twilight, the caves; somehow we are being reminded of something deep in human history, the long millennia before civilisation, that even yet remains imprinted or ""hard wired"" into us, (like our fear of spiders and snakes}.

There is also something very captivating about the location filming. The local shop may have pagan fetishes for sale but also seems to have a good stock of cheap stationary, pencils and plastic sharpeners! And where else would your pagan housewife go to be fitted with her bird mask than the local hairdressers, complete with tatty looking 1960s style hairdryers?

589663,3,6303149200,"The Wicker man is a low-budget horror film set in a remote Scottish island in the 1970's.  The story begins when a Christian fundamentalist policeman (Woodward) is sent to investigate the mysterious dissapearance of a young child.

Upon his arrival at the island, the policeman discovers a Neo-Pagan society which indulges in practices utterly repugnant to his Christian sensibilities, from worship of idols to bizarre sexual rituals and magic.

Suspecting a dark conspiracy involving murder, witchcraft and human sacrifice, Woodward pushes his investigation to a dark conclusion and horrifying surprise twist at the end.

The biggest weakness of the film is that it is not convincing either in its plot or premise.  It reads like a bad Jack Chick cartoon and is laughable, especially when Woodward meets the key villain, Lord 'Summerisle' who is at the heart of the conspiracy.  Even when the plot twist is revealed, it is laughable to think any community (no matter how religious) would engage in such a ridiculous practice to deal with something as commonplace as drought and crop failure, especially in a modern advanced society.

The film does have some genuinely frightening parts but it generally fails to capitalise on the spooky premise.",1173225600,3,1246,5.2

Here though, he plays a Scottish copper sent to the Hebrides to investigate the disappearance of a little girl. It is all so Scottish pagan ritualistic as to be laughable. The only thing worse than fat Yanks tarting around in overstretched plaid skirts, is the folks who believe in the sttylized myths that go along with this stuff.

Truth be told, there is one salient reason to watch this film and that's to see various folk copping a snog wth their clothes on outside a pub and more importantly, watching Britt Eklund dance around naked. Peter Sellers was a lucky bastard. Eklund is the definitive piece of well..... It will never occur to you that she can not act. Never.

Woodward, on the other hand, was the real deal. He could not have been paid very much for this, or if he was, that explains the rest of the film's production values. Lee is the Emperor of Camp, and jeez o man, it lathers it on thick here. This nearly debunks his credentials in Lord of the Rings. There is a scene with him in a long black wig that is just too funny, especially post Peter Jackson.

589714,5,6303149200,"Despite being plagued by production difficulties, budgetary problems and abysmal distribution (British Lion were unprepared for the film) Robin Hardy's directorial debut ""The Wicker Man"" is still with us and stronger than ever. Numerous DVD re-issues, soundtrack releases and even a bungled Hollywood remake makes the film remarkably persistent. An impressive feat for an unpretentious low budget British horror film. It's status as a horror film could be contested, such is the complexities of generic study. And with its very naturalised cinematography, numerous musical numbers and detective narrative it is apparent the film is a complex hybridity. Perhaps it is this very hybridity which has attracted such a devoted cult following. A number of films approached Christianity as an institution under threat in the 1970's, but none as insidiously and disturbing as this one. The film hinges on a great performance by Edward Woodward. He is a boorish, rude and arrogant man as he strolls around a community he has no place in. Pontificating and criticising, believing it to be a god given right. One would ordinarily celebrate the fate of such a repugnant man. But Woodward still elicits sympathy through a subtle and nuanced performance. It works so well because Christopher Lee produces an opposite performance, he is free and easy in the face of Howie's stiffness and repression. The film also benefits from a wonderfully intricate narrative courtesy of Anthony Shaffer which keeps the audience guessing to the devastating climax. A tremendous soundtrack of folk songs by Paul Giovanni adds authenticity and just the right atmosphere of creepiness. A high watermark that British horror has yet to reach again.

 In terms of DVD US audiences might be better off importing the recent UK Region 2 edition, which contains both the 88 minute cut of the film and the 100 minute director's cut.

589717,5,6303149200,"This bizarre film is the original version of _The Wicker Man_, written by Anthony Shaffer and directed by British director Robin Hardy, first released in 1973.  This movie has recently been remade in a film by the same title with Nicolas Cage.  The original _The Wicker Man_ is widely regarded as a cult classic in the horror and thriller genre.  The movie is certainly one of the most bizarre and unique I have ever seen.  It is also one of the most unintentionally hilarious and stupid.  Apparently the movie is supposed to be some sort of musical, and throughout the movie the characters frequently break out into song.  Combined with the tacky 1970s style, this musical aspect of the movie comes across as utterly absurd and one cannot help laughing at it for how ridiculous it is.  Added to this is the fact that the music used is horrendously bad.  The movie unfortunately is filled with gratuitous nudity, including several dancing scenes with naked pagans dancing about in a Stonehenge like structure and a nude singing scene with Britt Ekland who plays the landlord's daughter, Willow.  Whenever these nude scenes occur, the main character (a devout Christian) becomes understandably uptight and agitated, and the absurd conflict that ensues comes across as utterly moronic.  Nevertheless, the excessive, gratuitous nudity detracts from an otherwise interesting film.  While the movie comes across as absurdly cheesey in this respect, it does try to have a message, only what exactly that message is, is difficult to tell.  Apparently, the movie is trying to make some statement about the conflict between Christianity and paganism.  The central Christian character is supposed to appear excessively self-righteous, uptight, and prudish.  He frequently refers to the inhabitants of the island as ""godless heathens"", questions their teacher as to why they are not learning about Christianity (when in fact they are being taught about phallic symbols of all things!), and complains of the debauchery and moral rot after seeing the nude dancing.  However, despite the obvious politically correct interpretation, I feel that his voice is the most common-sensical in the whole movie.  Obviously the rest of the island inhabitants see nothing wrong with nude dancing and ridiculously bursting out into song at every opportunity (let alone human sacrifice)!  The pagan in the movie by contrast is presented as absurdly atavistic and positively diabolical and evil (as will be seen later).  But, perhaps the really central issue in this film is that of human sacrifice.  The islanders have had a bad harvest so they need a human victim to sacrifice (a virgin, a man who comes of his own free will, etc.) to their gods so that they will have a good harvest the next year.  The victim has a ""meeting with the wicker man"" and will be burned alive.  Many primitive cultures did indeed engage in human sacrifices (for example, Caesar claimed that the druids were cannibals (whatever merit there is to this claim) and of course cultures like the Aztecs routinely sacrificed innocents).  Indeed, according to such anthropologists as James Frazer in his _The Golden Bough_, the killing of the king was the central element in many ancient cultures and beliefs.  I think that perhaps this theme is the one being presented in this movie in its dealing with human sacrifice.  But, I also suppose that the sacrificed Christian (who is also a virgin, annointed with oil, etc.) is supposed to be reminiscent of Christ himself (who was also sacrificed in a sense so that all men may have eternal life).  Indeed, the sacrificed Christian is to have a martyr's death, and he remains steadfast in his faith even as the flames consume him.  Interestingly, before he dies the Christian tells the chief pagan, Lord Summerisle (played by Christopher Lee) that should the sacrifice fail he will merely have to make another sacrifice the next year and that that sacrifice will be of Lord Summerisle himself.  Lord Summerisle looks merely baffled by all this and replies simply ""The sacrifice will not fail!""  But, deep down the question remains, what will happen the following year.  Of course, to add to the absurdity of all this is the fact that as soon as the Christian is prepared to be sacrificed, the pagan villagers break out into another song and dance.

The basic plot of this movie involves a Christian policeman, police sergeant Howie (played by Edward Woodward), who visits Summerisle off the coast of Scotland, looking for the girl Rowan who is apparently missing.  There he encounters villagers who are seemingly reluctant to speak of such matters.  But, also he finds these villagers engaging in seemingly bizarre rituals and behaviors (including nude dancing and debaucheries) which he finds highly offensive.  It is only later that when he encounters Lord Summerisle himself that it is explained that the island inhabitants are in fact pagan.  Of course, a conflict ensues between the Christian beliefs of the policeman and the pagans.  Eventually, the policeman discovers that he has been deceived (after the inhabitants all dress up in bizarre costumes and parade around the island for a bit) and is to be sacrificed.  Such is the absurdity of this movie.

While the movie is certainly bizarre and uncanny, for the most part it comes off as ridiculously cheesey and preposterous.  Nevertheless, despite the cheesey stereotypes of Christians and pagans and the gratuitous nudity, this movie is probably worth watching simply for the fact that it is widely regarded as a cult classic, for its apparent bizarreness, and for the fact that it is totally unique and nothing really exists like it.

Ultimately, if there is any benefit to holding a particular belief, I don't know what it is. That is also why I like this movie so much. I won't ruin the end for those who have not seen it, except to say the entire film is worth seeing. Edward Woodward is Sergeant Howie, a straight-shooting policeman if ever there was one. After receiving an anonymous letter indicating a twelve-year old girl is missing, he proceeds to search for her on Summerisle, a fictitious island supposedly situated off the coast of Scotland. There he finds the locals to be as obstructive as they are lusty, which is most offensive to his pious nature. Their fertility rites strike him as pagan sacrilege, even as he fails to reconcile this with his own beliefs about resurrection. He is intolerant of their beliefs; yet, he has a job to do, so he abides. Does this girl even exist and, if so, will he ever find her? Woodward is fantastic as Sgt. Howie, as is Christopher Lee as Lord Summerisle. As the innkeeper's daughter, Swedish actress (and one-time wife of Peter Sellers), Britt Eckland is gorgeous, vivacious and seductive. My biggest problems with the film are the songs; even though they relate to the plot, they are too numerous and sometimes annoying. The film sometimes takes on the appearance of a musical, which would not be my preference for an ostensible horror film. A more juidicous use of music would have been more effective. Also, subtitles on this DVD would help because the dialogue is sometimes difficult to hear, especially Christopher Lee's.

589720,5,6303149200,"For the longest time I had heard about a little known (at least in the States) 1973 cult-horror film called ""The Wicker Man"". Whenever, I read any rare mentions of it in the media, it had always received rave reviews from anyone, who had the chance to see it. This piqued my interest greatly. Enough so, that I purchased the film, without any real knowlege of what the film was about. Well, once in awhile a 'shot in the dark' does pay off. This turned out to be an amazingly, fascinating movie.

The story takes place in the UK and involves Sergeant Howie (Edward Woodward), a moral and religious man, who takes his duties as an officer of the law, quite seriously. He recieves an anonymous note (with a photograph), that a 12 year old girl named Rowan Morrison has disapeared and not been seen for months. The Officer travels by sea plane to the private, remote Scottish island, where the young girl is from to investigate. But things don't seem to go as planned. The people, who live on the island, act very odd and secretive. Everything seems off-kiltered. Officer Howie is a stanger in a stange land. The odd man out. The more he finds out about both the ways of the island's strange inhabitants, their charismatic leader, Lord Summerisle (Christopher Lee) and the fate of Rowan Morrison, the more convuluted and bizarre things get. Ultimately the answers to his investigation lead to a ""Twilight Zone""-like ending.

To merely call ""The Wicker Man"" a horror film would be a diservice. It is so much more than that. It is mystery, a suspense-thriller and most of all a meditation on the meaning of faith and religion. It is well written, superbly casted and brillaintly acted. This film is perhaps one of the best films in Actor, Christopher Lee's long career. Kudos should also go to Edward Woodward playing a man who's faith is being tested. Also notice should go to the stunningly beautiful, Britt Ekland, who has created one of the sexiest scenes in British cinema. Mention should also be made of the wonderful '70s folk soundtrack, that adds to the creepy atmosphere of the film.

I have seen both the butchered 'Theatrical' version of the film and the 'Extended' version (made up of scenes, film elements, once thought to be lost). Both are included in this ""2-Disc Collector's Set"". The 'Extended' version is the one to watch. The added scenes are not mere padding.

589754,5,6303149200,"The extended version of The Wicker Man is a disturbing classic that will be etched in many an individual's memory for years to come.

The movie begins with the search for a missing girl, where Howie, a Scottish policeman played by Edward ""The Equalizer"" Woodward, leaves for Summerisle, an isolated location that is detached, both geographically and culturally, from the mainland of Scotland.

During his search, Howie is shocked by the pagan customs prevalent at Summerisle. Rituals honoring earth and sun gods are replete with dances performed by women (some of them nude), parades that include citizens who dress as if they were team mascots, and rites honoring the local, cultural heritage conducted by third-generation ""high priest"", Lord Summerisle, who is craftily played by Christopher Lee.

Lord Summerisle, who is the torchbearer of the pagan practices mixed in with advanced agrarian proficiencies passed down from his grandfather, has continued the tradition of celebrating a key annual event, namely May Day. During this observance, the aforementioned rituals occur alone if there has been an abundant crop within the past year; if, however, there has been a not-so-productive season, then the celebrations must conclude with sacrifices of a most disturbing nature. After discovering this most sinister side of what was once perceived as a harmless, yet civilized, society and knowing that May Day is both just around the corner and on the heels of a bad harvest, Howie comes to believe that the girl he is searching will be ""offered to the gods"".

It is upon this conviction that Howie intensifies his investigation, and further encounters with the people of Summerisle will set the final stages that will transform what was a highly predictable detective story into a prologue to the last scene, the arrival of the ""The Wicker Man"". It is near the end that the climactic tone is surged forth so suddenly that the audience is anything but fully prepared for the shocking last three minutes.

If ever there was a movie with twists that paralleled the wickedest of bait-and-switch patterns imaginable, this is it.

A final word of warning: with occasional nude scenes and reverberating themes of fundamentalist Christianity versus paganism, The Wicker Man is not suitable for everyone, especially those who draw a rather thin line between fiction and reality. So be careful in choosing those individuals you plan to watch this with.",1167436800,6,2444,5.1746835443037975
589755,4,6303149200,"`The Wicker Man' done originally in 1974 is a great English cult film, similar in many ways to the earlier English film version of William Golding's high school favorite novel, `Lord of the Flies'. And, just like `Lord of the Flies', we are now treated to a Hollywood remake of this classic with co-producer Nicholas Cage in the lead role created by Australian actor, Edward Woodward in the original flick.

I am happy to say that the remake of `The Wicker Man' is better than the remake of `Lord of the Flies', where the filmmakers seemed to totally miss the point of Golding's story. The new `The Wicker Man' did change a fair amount of the story, but largely what was really essential to moving the scene from an island off Scotland to an American island in Washington State, in Puget Sound.

The primary problem faced by the filmmakers is that in the original story, much was made of the traditional English class system with a traditional Manor House landlord, emphasis on the `lord' business in charge of the `private island' with an otherwise very peculiar social system. The modern storytellers got a lot of mileage out of their paradigm shift from English noble to cult matriarch at the head of a little society patterned after the society of bees, which happens to also be the island's main industry, replacing the orchard agriculture in the English original. These changes are to the good. The only problem with the switch from apples to bees is that while apples are not normally grown on the Scottish islands, bees are not at all out of place in Puget Sound. This looses a useful clue to the unusual nature of this island community.

 Another fairly effective change is to make the lead character policeman (Cage) allergic to bee stings. Somewhat less effective is providing the California policeman with a back story which connects him to a resident of the Summersisle community (The modern movie adds an extra `s' to aid in pronouncing the name), making him the father of the missing little girl, the bait which the mother uses to draw cop Cage to the island.

I think the problem with this backstory is that while Cage and Woodward are both playing policemen, Cage is out of his jurisdiction and his police authority is really a shadow with no real weight. Woodward, on the other hand, has official standing on his island and is fully authorized to make arrests and conduct investigations.

Otherwise, the story plays out in almost exactly parallel scenes starting at the point at which Cage arrives at on the island.

The original movie had a purely realistic story, where the only supernatural element was in the island inhabitants' beliefs. There were no supernatural threats and not even too many menacing flashbacks or dreams. The remake remained true to this point of view, and improved on it just a bit by drawing parallels between the Summersisle community and the Amish, where both exhibited anti-technological biases. I think I also saw a hint of parallel being drawn to the puritan witches of Salem, Massachusetts.

Of course, nature was called in to help out by blanking out cell phone reception on the island. One problem both movies shared is that they were marketed as `horror' movies. While the sense of threat is constant throughout most of the movie, it is not really the kind of supernatural threat we get in most Stephen King stories. Like `Psycho' and `Ten Little Indians', the source of threat is entirely based on purely human, albeit quite pathological, behavior. The isolated venue does create similarities with stories such as `Alien' and `House on Haunted Hill' where the victim(s) are physically cut off from any outside help, but here, the primary thing keeping Cage / Woodward on the island is the obsession with the lost girl. I also note a strong similarity with the movie `Don't Look Now' where the plot is driven by fleeting glimpses of a little lost girl.

In the end, the modern `The Wicker Man' makes the Summersisle inhabitants just a bit more loony and therefore just a bit less believable in their realistic setting. While one can easily imagine descendants of Druids celebrating May Day with animalistic costumes, neither the Amish nor a hippie holdover connection works quite as well. Too bad cinema finances prevented the filmmakers from keeping the venue back in the old country. While Cage is a superb actor, I think Woodward's matter of fact, `just the facts, Madam' tone of the English constable fits against the background of the tree worshipping islanders. The islanders don't have to be quite so bizarre to stand out behind Woodward's low-key tone. This also means that the original movie gives much less away early on. The unraveling of the threat and the climax comes more slowly and subtly. But when it does, it's a far bigger surprise.

Last but not least, I think the current director, Neil LaBute, should have studied the camera work on the last scene of the original more carefully. The original director did a much better job of revealing the climax venue, even in black and white.

So, while Cage is ultimately a more interesting actor than Woodward, I would still recommend the original over the remake if what you want is a really good rendition of the story. I will say that the modern `The Wicker Man' has my favorite DVD extra, a commentary soundtrack including the director, editor, and a few of the lesser actors (I think casting Ellen Burstyn was a waste of her talent. They did such a good job of casting the minor women on the island, but Burstyn just didn't seem to work as the queen bee.). This commentary easily doubles the value of the DVD. The `shocking Alternate Ending' is just a bit more graphic violence added to the telling of the final scene, which adds nothing to the meat of the story.",1167350400,5,5783,4.773

 I LOVE this film and am looking forward to dumping my old VHS copy in favor of this shiny new version.

589759,5,6303149200,"I had seen this movie maybe 25 years ago, and it had stood out in my memory for the brilliance of its performances and its haunting mood of increasing psychological tension.  So I rented it recently from Netflix just to see how it looks with the passage of time.  Some movies age better than others, and I wanted to see if Wicker Man was as good as my recollection of it.

I am delighted to say I think the movie holds up very well; it is a classic of its genre and I highly recommend it to movie fans who enjoy psychological thrillers.

The details of the plot are well known: a devoutly Christian policeman, played by Edward Woodward in a superlative performance, is summoned to a remote island to track down a report of a missing young girl.  From the start, he encounters a passive/aggressive mixture of social civility but strong resistance to his investigation, coupled with the repeated warning that he's in over his head and doesn't understand what he's getting into.

Although he's given different and contradictory explanations, the most frequent version is that the girl doesn't exist -- even though he finds clear signals he is being lied to, which affronts his clearly developed sense of wrong.

As he begins his investigation, he is also confronted with abundant evidence that the residents of this isle are most clearly not Christian, that they worship a vaguely Druidic and pagan cult that embraces frank sexuality.  To our repressed policeman, this overt sexualism, coupled with what he believes to be direct deceptions about the missing girl, causes him to believe that the residents are engaged in an evil conspiracy of silence.  And in his repressed fury, he feels a moral duty to get to the bottom of the mystery.  Eventually he does so, of course, to his great dismay.

Purely from a story-telling perspective, this is a terrific movie.  There isn't a wasted scene.  Every scene yields another clue or another perspective on the villagers, and the photography has a highly naturalistic, almost documentary feel.  As the clues pile up, pressure heightens on the policeman, leading inevitably to the film's spectacular denouement.  Some of the reviewers have complained about the pace; they say the movie moves much too slowly.  I don't agree; the whole point is to let the tension build slowly but inexorably.  Although this movie preceded it, the intentionally langorous pace reminds me of Picnic at Hanging Rock.

The photography is quite good, and has the good sense to simply back off and let you enjoy the austere beauty of this island, from its little seaside village to its craggy shoreline.  You can tell that Wicker Man was shot with a very limited number of cameras; there aren't a lot of jump cuts and reaction shots, even in the tavern scene.  While that is doubtless partly a function of the limited budget, it is also clear that it is a directorial choice. The mise-en-scene is intended to let the story come to a slow but steady boil  To modern viewers, the pace may seem poky and slow, but this is a movie you have to take on its own terms.  You can always rent Days of Thunder again if you need a fix of crash-bang.",1164672000,4,3153,4.7153284671532845

The music was so bad it was funny (although it was the 70's)

Not much of a plot going on.

The police officer's strong religious convictions come off as whiny and tiresome, and I was pretty glad to see his fate at the end.

Christopher Lee is the only good point I can think of.

All in all, I suppose it was an ""educational experience"" for me to see this widely celebrated 70's ""classic"". I guess maybe I expect every old horror film to be as good as the Vincent Price classics, so I learned my lesson. I don't see how this movie is good enough to warrant a remake.

Oddly enough, the weird song and dance routine that a nude Ms Eklund delivers pretty early on hasn't changed my mind about this one.

I liked the movie the first time I saw it and still do, almost 25 years later.

It is weird, it is creepy and it so 70s! Perfectly authentic back in the day, the music and clothing and hairstyles add a certain flavor the remake just does not have.

Edward Woodward's much praised performance as Officer Howie didn't touch me at all. It was Christopher Lee's totally believable turn as Lord Summerisle that did it for me and I bet it will stick with you, long after you've seen it the first time. Nothing he does is out of place, even when you see him dancing about in the ritual processional near the end.

All comparisons to Cher aside, his getup and wig don't detract from his performance.

Memorable scenes:

the processional and the costumed villagers, as described above

the mother giving her child a toad to suck

the woman breastfeeding her child, while holding an egg in one hand and sitting on a tombstone

a nude Britt Eklund go-go dancing, her siren song wailing away in the background

the people who suddenly pop up from behind the sea wall, with the animal masks on

the hand of glory

You must see this film if you plan on watching the remake, as it is truly a British classic. I hesitate to call it a horror film, it is more of a suspense thriller.

There is a lot of nudity, a few sexual situations, one cut-off hand sequence and some mildly surprising/scary scenes sprinkled thruout the film. I was never once scared or horrified while watching it (although I did feel a bit like laughing out loud while watching Britt boogie).

The plot of the move is that a responsible, Christian British policeman comes into a very insular Island community to investigate a missing girl, he discovers that he has stumbled into a pagan/heathen cult that follow the ways of the ancient British people who built Stonehenge. It isn't good vs evil, just different religions. Christopher Lee is excellent as the highest lord of the Island who takes religion/culture very seriously.

For those who say ""God is dead"" - the Christopher Lee character presents a very different view. God/the Gods never died, they just await devoted followers to bring them forth and there is respect for believing Christian, but for you Christians you are warned, you better have strength and courage and the courage of your conviction to confront the old Gods and the practitioners of the Old Gods reawakened.

Long and pointlessly boring, moving with the rapid fire pace of a sloth on tranquilizers, case in point? the opening sequence of this film and, the horrific folk music accompanying it, if they had dragged it out any longer they would have had to included credits thanking the postmans second cousin twice removed, and that music, ughh (shudder) it's the only real element of horror to be found in this second rate piece of tripe. Let's move on to the plot, wait a sec let's call it the ""story"" as I'd hate to deem anything as transparent as the goings on in this film as being deemed worthy of the title plot. A young girl has gone missing on an island made up entirely of hedonistic pagans that frolic about naked and have sex by moonlight, nothing suspicious to tip you off that morales might not play into the collective conscience or decision making process employed by this group of people huh? A single UNARMED police officer comes to inquire as to the missing girls whereabouts, arriving by sea plane, and never informing his superiors by checking in, at all, ever, during the course of this film, just leaves his plane in the harbor and never secures it to mooring in case of foul weather, nor does he go back to check on it,so much for police procedure, but wait that's not the first hole you could drive a truck through in this ahem, story. I'm guessing the poulation of this island to be well over a hundred people based on the number of extras in certain scenes, did I mention he didn't bring a gun?  Lets jump ahead oh, say 25 min into this cinematic catastrophe as there is little if anything going on except people singing, and singing and singing......more than in your average Disney movie, f*ing dirty hippies. Everyone in the village, including the girls mother, denies knowing the missing girl by name or recognising her picture that was sent to the police via a letter.... from the girls mother.... Wouldn't she have been arrested for issuing a false complaint? Oh wait! he fails to ask if she was indeed the party that issued the letter, in point of fact he NEVER bothers to inquire as to who it was that sent the letter in the first place..Ah heck, let's not let a little thing like logic stand in our way shall we?  Next for your viewing displeasure is the lack of any real detective work done by the totally inept police officer, only once during the course of his investigation does he threaten someone he's questioning with arrest for withholding evidence after he does indeed discover that yes, a little girl named Rowan did exist AND, she is now deceased, buried in the graveyard across from the school she attended, with NO DEATH CERTIFICATE ISSUED, he never even gets around to asking who the physician was that pronounced her dead. I think even Barney Fife would have called Andy in for back up on this one, at least he would have had a gun, albeit with only one bullet which by all rights should have been saved for the script writer of this piece of garbage.

After recieving permission form Lord Summersby (Christpher Lee) to exhume the girls remains, he discovers that her coffin only contains the corpse of a dead rabbit,(please insert joke here)

I must take this opportunity to comment on a great actor Mr. Christopher Lee, who's performance in this movie is as wooden as the burning effigy seen at the end of this film, I've seen tougher actin in tough actin tinactin........

 The plot digresses into the formulaic from here when the officer finally decides to go for back up. hmm....I wonder if his plane will start? Oh my, it doesn't? I'm so(not)surprised.

I won't ruin the train wreck of an ending you can see coming with this one dear viewer only let me say this, in all my years it's the first time I wanted to snap a DVD in half for sheer revenge, it was that bad, even the naked jiggle fests that insued during certain scenes courtesy of some very curvy, well put togethor eye candy galabanting around fires and, in graveyards was not enough to make it worth setting through 88 min of the American edit of this film, how could anyone set through the unedited version of this?

The scene between Lord Summerisle and Sergeant Howie absolutely makes the movie.  The scene with Willow trying to seduce the detective has to be one of the sexiest things ever on celluloid and manages it without being trashy.

There was one scene where a naked lady (I guess you'd consider her pretty if you were into that sort of thing) was singing and beating on the other side of the detective's bedroom wall.  I assume she was trying to seduce him into entering her room, and I don't think she was looking for someone to just perform a duet with.  It was just one of many ""odd"" moments in the movie for me.

For me, this was one of those movies that you want to turn off, but you keep thinking to yourself that it has to get better.

589842,5,6303149200,"This review is for the 88 minute version of the film. It is not patched together from outtakes, but the film as it appeared in its U.S. theatrical release. I have also seen the longer version on an ancient VHS tape, the additional 12 minutes or so do provide additional background regarding Sgt. Howie, plus the events of the film are added to and reordered so as to cover one more day and evening on the island, plus there are some extra verses in some of the songs. Having seen both I feel that this version of the film stands on its own. Admittedly, I'm not sure why those 12 minutes were trimmed for the U.S. theatrical release, but I don't feel it is worth the price of the box set to view them. The Wicker Man is less a horror film, regardless of the claims on the packaging, and more of a suspenseful mystery.

 Summoned to a remote Scottish island to investigate the reported disappearance of a young girl, Sgt. Howie (Edward Woodward) becomes convinced that something is not right, but cannot at first determine exactly what it is. As he questions the villagers, every answer seems contradictory, which only makes him more curious and more determined to get to the bottom of the situation. The villagers are led by Lord Summerisle (Christopher Lee), who is quite cheerful and upfront, while still being evasive.

 As the story develops, we see two belief systems contrasted, conservative Christianity as practiced by Sgt Howie, and the pagan ""Old Religion"" of the islanders. It eventually becomes apparant that several generations previously, the island had completely abandoned the Christian religion, and gone back to the practice of the worship of nature spirits and gods of the elements, etc. As part of their worship of nature, the islanders have a very unrestrained view of sexuality, which Sgt Howie views as simply scandalous, and causes him some tension when Willow (Britt Ekland), the daughter of the local innkeeper tries to seduce him. Her completely naked singing and dancing may cause tension of a sort in some viewers as well. There was admittedly a body double used for some parts of this sequence, but a great deal of it is Britt herself, and she looks wonderful. This sequence alone could have been responsible for the film receiving an R rating. Ingrid Pitt appears as the local librarian and she also has a brief nude scene in a bathtub.

 In conversations between Sgt Howie, Lord Summerisle and others, some very interesting similarities between the the religion of the islanders and traditional Christianity are highlighted. On his way to Lord Summerisles estate, Sgt Howie witnesses some local girls jumping over a Beltane fire. Lord Summerisle explaines that the ritual is to insure fertility and appease the god of fire, by whom the girls hope to conceive a child. When Sgt Howie protests that this is blasphemy and poor biology, Lord Summerisle reminds him of the Christian account of Jesus as being ""born of a virgin, who was herself impregnated by a ghost"". In another scene, when Sgt Howie attempts to council the schoolteacher Miss Rose (Diane Cilento) that her education of her female pupils is improper, the Pagan and Christian views regarding death and rebirth are compared, and shown to be largely different words for the same thing.

 The ending of the movie finally reveals the ""Wicker Man"" of the title, and once more, depicts a ritual which is the very foundation of the Christian belief system, but which Christians view as abhorrent outside of the Christian context. In this ritual, it is made apparant that Sgt Howie has become an alternative Jesus figure, chosen by the islanders because he is a virgin, because, as an officer of the law, he represents the King, and because he came of his free will (he flew the seaplane which brought him to the island himself). In a similar manner, Jesus was said to be a virgin, to represent the King of Heaven, and to have gone willingly to his sacrifice.

 Overall, the islanders seemed very happy and comfortable with their life style and sexuality. There appeared to be no guilt or shame associated with their practices, they just appeared to be healthy and happy people who enjoyed their bodies in a natural manner. Society in general would probably benefit by adopting such an honest and healthy attitude toward their sexuality, instead of claiming that sex was ""original sin"", thereby attaching shame and guilt to what should be joyful positive experiences.

 Generally, the movie painted a reasonable and for the most part, accurate picture of many pagan beliefs, especially regarding reincarnation and related matters.

 However, I am not aware of any modern pagan group which practices human sacrifice as shown in this film, even though in much earlier times this had been the case. Two centuries before Jesus, the Romans passed laws forbidding the practice anywhere within the Empire. It is plausible that the practice of human sacrifice continued outside the Empire, and Scotland was never under Roman rule.

Of course, sacrifice of one particular human IS the foundation of the Christian faith as it is practiced today, although from the Roman perspective, Jesus was not sacrificed as atonement for sin, but executed as a criminal accused of stirring up people against the Roman government in Judea.

 Although human sacrifice had been outlawed 200 years previously, Christians of Jesus time were certainly familiar with animal sacrifice to Yahweh, held annually at the Temple in Jerusalem, and followers of Jesus continued the practice at least until the time of his death, if not longer.

 Taken as a whole, the Wicker Man is rather reminiscent of the better episodes of ""The Twilight Zone"" in that it is puzzling at first, with a growing sense of ominous dread which builds as the story unfolds. In addition, the film causes viewers to think about their beliefs, and ask questions such as:

What makes a religion ""true""?

Why is human sacrifice, even one time, to the Christian god acceptable, but not to other gods?

How does the viewer feel about a god who is appeased by sacrifice?

What if the situation were reversed, that is, what if the primary religion of our culture was the pagan nature religion, and the movie was about a small cult on an island who sacrificied a man on a cross to make things right with their god?

Would we then view that ceremony in the same way as we now view the ritual involving the wicker man?

Would a small ""wicker man"" made of precious metal adorn the necklaces or hang from the rearview mirrors of hundreds of millions of people?

Would the title of this film then have been ""The Crucifix""?

 I found this to be a thought-provoking and completely absorbing film, well worth seeing.",1157241600,17,6724,4.8489082969432316

589844,3,6303149200,"MY REVIEW OF THE SINGLE DISC EDITION:

When I saw the previews for the upcoming remake of THE WICKER MAN with Nicolas Cage, I tried to remember what I'd seen of the original film.  It was ages ago that I saw it and I'm sure it was cut to ribbons since it was on TV, but I was intrigued enough to buy the DVD based on my memory of the film.

After reading the other reviews here, I'll have to find the original 100-minute version because--even though I've now watched the 88-minute version--I STILL feel like I may have missed the movie I wanted to see!

The cast was enough to get this version.  Christopher Lee is always worth watching and he brings the same energy to this role as he did as the very cheerful MAN WITH THE GOLDEN GUN.  It was interesting to see Diane Cilento since she recently made headlines by openly discussing her turbulent marriage to Sean Connery (Connery has since abandoned the idea of writing his memoirs).  Super sexy Ingrid Pitt makes a too-brief appearance as a librarian (did she cut loose as she did in THE VAMPIRE LOVERS in those 12 minutes missing?).
But the really sexy role goes to Britt Ekland (another MAN WITH THE GOLDEN GUN connection!).  Whether bartending in tight sweaters or dancing nude singing a siren's song, she's enough to tempt any man away from just about anything.

I loved British horror films of the 50's, 60's and 70's, but THE WICKER MAN plays more like a detective story for most of its running time.  Don't get too frustrated by the lack of ""scares""--it is all leading up to something.

I'm not sure how this story will play to a younger generation.  Young people today have been raised and indoctrinated to be so horribly accommodating to anyone's beliefs--no matter how different or bloody or just plain weird--that the notion of a entire island community given over to pagan practices may not have the same effect as it did in the 1970's.

I wonder how the new remake will play out.
If it's like all the other current remakes, Hollywood will cut all the story's wit, mystery and nuance while opting for cheap scares and dumbed-down plot points.
Oh, well.

MY REVIEW FOR THE 2-DISC SPECIAL EDITION (since Amazon doesn't separate the two, review-wise):

THE WICKER MAN was a challenging film when it was released in the 1970s and it remains a challenging work to this day.

Just before this Two-Disc Special Edition was released, I bought the single disc edition to check it out since I'd only seen the film on late-night horror shows (cut to ribbons, to say the least). Unfortunately, I found out that even the single disc wasn't considered ""the real version"" in most of the reviews.

I ended up buying the Special Edition because I wanted to see more...and I was not disappointed! If THE WICKER MAN intrigues you, then it's worth getting to see what was left out. Although most purists complain that the additional scenes are poorly filmed (they look like they were shot with a video camera), everyone can see exactly what was cut from the film as they watch it. I suppose it would be distracting to anyone seeing the film for the first time...but I'm assuming that most already have.

I loved the cast. Edward Woodward is perfect as the stiff-upper-lip Christian policeman, never overdoing it but conveying his temptations and struggles. Christopher Lee gets to exhibit the same sort of menacing glee he'd bring to his happy assassin in the following year's THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN GUN. Britt Ekland was never sexier (she would also bring that hot bod to GOLDEN GUN, although only in a bikini). In small roles, Ingrid Pitt (the Hammer babe of THE VAMPIRE LOVERS and others) and Diane Cilento (Sean Connery's ex!) clue you into something really wrong as sensuous women on a boring old island.

I remember there was some uproar when the film came out since it appeared that paganism had ""triumphed"" over Christianity in some way. At least storywise, one might reach that conclusion. I didn't react that way. Spirituality can hardly be completely represented through individual characters or situations, let alone contained. The fate of the police officer is, at best, a martyrdom that transcends a film's ending of who lives (triumphs) or dies (fails). He remained faithful to the end. And so do the singing pagans!
I believe that's part of the reason that the film still resonates to this day: This collision of beliefs remains consistent and the drama of THE WICKER MAN is not that anyone has a crisis of faith, it's that everyone remains totally committed, even to the point of sacrificing your own life or sacrificing another's.

Did I mention how hot Britt Ekland looked in this...?

(I haven't seen the recent Nicolas Cage remake but, since it's an American studio remake, I'm sure it's a train wreck).

589846,4,6303149200,"An upright English police sergeant, Howie (Edward Woodward), from the mainland is sent to an isolated island known as Summerisle to investigate the disappearance of a young girl named Rowan Morrison (Geraldine Cowper). The residents of the isle, including Lord Summerisle himself (Christopher Lee) seem reluctant to assist Howie and it becomes apparent that they are in fact trying to frustrate his investigation. Also, Howie quickly discovers Summerisle is a place far removed from what he is accustomed to. It is a place where pagan pageants and customs of the past are practiced and flourishing. Everyone seems to want Howie to leave, but he is a righteous man and he can't leave until he's solved the disappearance. What he ends up discovering is something far more chilling than he would have ever guessed.

THE WICKER MAN is usually classified as being a horror movie, but it's much more than that. The film shares elements of the horror genre, but it's more of a mish-mash between suspense/mystery/musical/horror. Edward Woodward does a good job at portraying the film's protagonist and central character, Sergeant Howie. Opposing Howie, is Lord Summerisle, portrayed by the delightful Christopher Lee. Lee has said that his role in this movie was one of his favorites of all time (he agreed to appear in the film for free) and it is a delight to watch Lee strut, prance, and dance throughout his time on screen.

The film was filmed in the early 70s and therefore shares some of the color of that time. Nevertheless, unlike many films of that period, it has aged quite well. The film's ending is what makes it so horrifying. Yet, upon first viewing and without knowing anything else about the movie, I was able to figure out the big secret about a fourth of the way through the movie. Whatever the case, THE WICKER MAN is a delightful and unique film from the 1970s that is well worth the time to watch.

This DVD edition includes a very informative documentary entitled, THE WICKER MAN ENIGMA, the theatrical trailer, various tv and radio spots, and a sample film biography of some of the movie's main actors.",1156291200,,2118,4.861495844875346
589847,4,6303149200,"The story involves a police officer (Edward Woodward) flying to a Scottish isle to find a missing girl. As a devout Christian he is horrified to learn that the islanders have long ago rejected Christianity in favor of paganism. He starts to suspect that the entire populace is involved with the girl's disappearance.

Many people peg ""The Wicker Man"" as a horror film, but this is not correct. Yes, it ends as a horror story but the first 85% of the film is a mix of other film genres -- mystery/dectective, musical and erotica.

The cast features Christopher Lee as the head pagan Lord Summerisle. Britt Ekland and Ingrid Pitt are also on hand.

WHAT WORKS: The picture was filmed on location in Scotland and features some truly breath-taking photography. It'll definitely make you want to visit this magnificent region of the earth.

Britt Ekland plays ""Willow,"" the hotelkeeper's daughter, and she has an excellent scene trying to lure Woodward out of his room for some late-night amorous activity. Her siren-song ""How Do"" is a soothing and moving piece of music. Sometimes I just put on this scene to enjoy (I'm talking musically, of course, but Ekland is pleasing to look at as well). The film is worth getting just for this song.

The May-pole song is also a catchy folk ditty.

[SPOILER ALERT!]

The ending is also a bit unexpected. I kept waiting for Woodward to escape his terrible predicament, but it never happened -- they literally fried his a$$!

[END SPOILER ALERT]

WHAT DOESN'T WORK: As the mystery progresses and Woodward does his detective work the story fails to capture your undivided attention. In other words, the story has a decidedly lazy vibe to it; your mind may wander at times. Needless to say, if you have a problem with ACDC -- I'm sorry, I mean ADHD -- you probably won't like this picture.

THINGS TO KEEP IN MIND: This is an early 70s British film and so naturally has that Hammer film vibe, even though it's not a Hammer film. The folk songs and soundtrack naturally reflect this era. So, if you don't like Hammer films or early 70s folk/hippy music you probably won't appreciate ""The Wicker Man.""

Also, there is a lot of nudity, even in the short version, so if nudity offends you skip this one.

FINAL ANALYSIS: This is a very original film that successfully mixes various film genres. As far as originality goes ""The Wicker Man"" is 5-Stars film all the way. It's worthy of its 'cult film' status. It's dated, however, and therefore screams out for a remake. Hence, although nothing can ever take the place of the original, I'm personally looking forward to the remake.

They are playing him for the fool and even the girl is into the act. This entire movie deals crop harvesting sacrifice and the level of it in paganism. Both Mr Lee and Mr Woodward are serious actors in their own right. There is maypole rituals, there nymph dancing, there is complex hide and seek in pagan costumes. Even Prim Sergeant is in costume (the pagan-folks know that he is trying to outhink them). There is even a little bit of dangerous swordplay 'guillotine' play. Mr. Hitchcock would have enjoyed this.

""The Wicker Man"" is one of those somewhat obscure movies from many years back that has won over a devoted, some might even say rabid, cult following that most people usually feel a bit underwelmed by when they finally see it.

The plot, already outlined here, involves a police officer from Scotland who travels to a remote island to investigate the reported disappearance of a young girl.  While there the policeman, a devote Christian discovers that the inhabitants of this island still practice the pre-Christian religion on their ancient Celtic ancestors.

It is unquestionably an intriguing premise and one that could have really stirred thought and discussion over the notion of rigid theology and intolerance of religious fundamentalism (fundamentalism of ANY type as both the policeman and the islanders follow a rigid fundamentalist mindset) towards those of differing belief systems.  I sense that this is what the movie is striving to do, but unfortunately its execution is woefully uneven.  The acting, with an exception or two, isn't very credible, the effects are laughable (there is a scene in which a group of young women are supposed to be dancing naked around a bonfire and it is painfully obvious that they are all wearing leotards) and the film's title gives away the ending to anyone familiar with the alleged practices of the ancient Celts.  Much is often made by fans of the film of the movie's songs and they can add a certain flavor, but most of the time they come across as flaky folk wannabes that Donovon would have scoffed at.  The is much more compelling music that could have been used.

Still, having said all of that, I have to cut the movie just a little bit of slack for its originality and for making an effort at giving us something unique and different.  I was going to give it 3 stars, but I decided to dock it one star to counter act the reviewer from November of 2005 who does not actually review the film but rants against the forthcoming remake.  Having not seen the remake, he is hardly in any position to criticize it and by doing so he simply reminds of the degree to which this movies obsessive following have overrated it.",1147737600,9,2254,4.8359375
589894,3,6303149200,"I should mention that I've only the 88 minute version.  I would've preferred the longer one, theoretically, but this is the one I was sent, so this is what we'll get.  Frankly, the idea of seeing 20 more minutes of this film is remarkably unappealing.

'The Wicker Man' is an extraordinarily goofy film, and by no stretch of the imagination is it a horror movie.  I base this belief on the notion that in order to qualify as a horror movie, a movie has to at least be trying to be horrifying.  Up until the last few minutes there are no attempts to scare the audience whatsoever.  This movie is closer to a musical than a horror movie, as it's got like 4-5 extended songs, and one scene of horror.  However, my not particularly caring for this movie isn't based on my expecting it to be something other than what it is; I've read enough about horror films and 'The Wicker Man' in particular that I knew this wasn't liable to be a horror movie.  The problem with 'The Wicker Man' isn't that it isn't a horror movie, but rather than nothing actually happens.  Sergeant Howie comes to Pagan Summerisle to search for missing Rowan, questions various people and gets numerous conflicting evasions, is disgusted by their pagan-ness and eventually there is a twist ending, after interminably drawn out 'climax'.  That's it.  The ending itself is pretty decent, but that's all their is to the the movie.  They built a film around an ending and found that there was nothing to do, so they just went with it, hoping that that would be enough,  Well, it ain't for me.

The movie does earn some points for originality.  There is something just very strange about watching modern English folk discussing and engaging in Pagan rituals.  Also, Christopher Lee is pretty good as the rather dapper Lord Summerisle.  And again, the ending is quite clever and well done.  Still, these things are about all it's got going for it on a non-camp level, and they're only worth so much.

And, oh, the singing!  First ya got the hilarious folk intro song, and the drunken pub singalong and Willow's even more risible nude song and dance routine and so on.  All this silly songs give the film an intensely wacky atmosphere.  I'm particulalry amused by Willow's song.  How anyone could watch this scene and not burst out laughing is beyond me.  It is intensely stupid.

I initially had a somewhat lengthy discussion of the thematic concerns of this film, but I've since decided to excise it, as it gives one the false impression that I actually cared about them.  While reflecting on this movie I'm not interested in considered what it has to say about religion, but rather on the fact that 'Cornrigs and Barleyrigs' song is very, very funny.

Yeah, this movie is pretty dumb.  Dumb, but fairly amusing in its lameness, and reasonably professionally done in spite of the unworkable script.

589895,4,6303149200,"This is not what most people would call a horror film, yet the situation created in the movie is indeed horrific.  Being on this island is like being stuck in the Twilight Zone, where everyone has gone mad and no one will listen to reason. The strange beliefs and rituals of the residents of this island painfully stretch the imagination of the God-fearing Sergeant Howie. He is shocked at every turn by what he sees and experiences, but he remains determined to fulfill his duty: to find the missing child.

The Wicker Man is quite a unique film. The tone set on the island is morose and dark, layered beneath a seemingly happy culture of ""flower children"" dancing and making love in the fields. This is the type of movie that truly makes you think.  You feel as though you are Sergeant Howie, trapped on this island where common sense seems to be sharply askew - where you are essentially on your own.

589900,3,6303149200,"I saw this film for the first time recently, and was intrigued by the themes in the film, notably the information on pagan philosophy etc.

I will not comment on the technical aspects of the film, as they have been covered in other reviews, though I must say I thought Woodward in particular played his role very well.

I think any viewer knew ""something bad"" was in store for Howie when his seaplane failed to start when he wanted to return to the mainland for reinforcements !

What I do want to say is this. I am a Christian, and for me the most ironic part of the whole film was when the pagan Lord (Christopher Lee) said to Howie ""you know nothing about real sacrifice.""  The great irony is that Howie knew more about real sacrifice than ANY of the island people, as he knew the Lord Jesus Christ had died for his sins in His sacrificial death. And that though he died a painful death, Howie ultimately had the ""last laugh"" as he would be with the Lord forever...whereas unless the pagans repented of their evil deeds, they would be damned forever.

I think the film makers ""acknowledged"" something of this when we see Howie about to die in the Wicker Man at the end of the film. Although the islanders were celebrating etc we also see Howie praying and praising God, knowing that when he died he would be with the Lord Jesus Christ. And I believe the film-makers captured something of this paradoxical hope and joy that Howie had. (Reminded me of the Protestant martyrs who were burnt at the stake under Queen Mary.)

I also appreciated the tactic Howie used to try and appeal to the islanders when he was about to be taken to his death. He appealed to them that by killing him would NOT guarantee a good harvest - and then he used the tactic of saying ""and if you do not get a good harvest, then next year you will have to sacrifice your leader"" (referring to Christopher Lee.) For a few seconds, you could see Lee realising what Howie said was true, and had a look of fear - but quickly hid this by saying ""but we WILL get a good harvest this year !"" and then encouraging everyone to continue taking Howie to his death.

So, I think the real twist of this film is that though the islanders SEEM to have won, it is actually Howie who gets the real victory.",1141171200,14,2263,4.335697399527187

To say that, only reflects the warped aesthetics of our days, if you know what I mean.)

On another note, I would say that this film is not particularly about paganism. The more important theme seems to be FANATICISM, here illustrated by a Christian zealot and a community of pagans that happen to be every bit as obtuse as he is.

589928,4,6303149200,"I first saw this movie in its shortened version many years ago, and I must admit to having been confused at that time. However, there were two reasons for my confusion. First, all of the nudity was removed from the televised version that I saw. Second, I was too young to understand the sexual references that appear throughout the movie. Now that I have seen the uncut version with the various nude scenes and now that I am old enough to understand many of the references, I realize that this movie was carefully crafted to lead to the ending (which I absolutely will not tell anything about).

The general story is that Rowan Morrison has come up missing, and foul play is suspected. Rowan is a child on the island of Summerisle, which is very isolated. Policeman Sergeant Neil Howie (Edward Woodward) arrives by seaplane to investigate. Sergeant Howie soon encounters strange behavior by the residents. Many of the residents do not seem to know Rowan at all. Others tell Howie that she is gone (do they mean dead?).

While Howie is bothered by Rowan's disappearance, the sexual behavior of the islanders bothers him even more. Before long Sergeant Howie learns that all the islanders are pagans, and they worship nature. While the sexual scenes are sufficiently subdued to allow an R-rating, I suspect that once upon a time this movie came close to the highest rating, at least in the uncut versions.

I find the complexity of this movie interesting, a complexity that is revealed only at the end of the movie. Unfortunately I must leave the explanations regarding the complexity to a viewer, because I promised not to reveal any significant details. The ending causes some viewers to consider this movie to be a horror movie, though only certain aspects of the movie fall in that genre.

This movie is a good exploration of modern paganism, though I am unable to discern the difference between inspiration and basis in truth as I am personally unaware of such practices. The practices shown in the movie seem plausible and all the more chilling once the totality of the movie is revealed at the end.

Christopher Lee has frequently appeared in horror movies, but this time he is a sort of grand priest or shaman and is all the more chilling because he seems like he could be an actual person. I was disturbed to realize how easily the islanders fooled Sergeant Howie, and yet the story is quite believable.

I recommend that if you see this movie you try to obtain the video of the song ""Safety Dance"" by Men Without Hats. The first time I saw the video I was reminded of this movie and was chilled rather than amused. Another interesting point of contrast is Jethro Tull's 1977 album ""Songs from the Wood,"" which contains a number of references that can also be found in this movie. After watching this movie I think you will reconsider any interpretations you may give this music.

This movie is unusual in many ways. It is not scary, but then again this movie is not a traditional horror movie. This movie is disturbing and you should have a sense of unease that increases until the end. Some people might consider this movie to be an intellectual thriller. Call it what you will, I like this movie. I found comments that this movie is predictable to be partially true. However, those reviewers are using hindsight because there are several possible meanings and outcomes and just because they were lucky in their guess may just mean that they did not see the other possibilities.

There is a little problem. This movie exists in several versions. There is the chopped up US version that clocks in at 88 minutes. Avoid that version. There is a 99 minute version (which is this movie, the ""Limited Edition""), which is better, but there is a director's cut (that I have been unable to find) that supposedly has 117 minutes. Be careful what you buy, and I hope you enjoy this very unusual movie.",1130716800,22,3899,4.6817518248175185

Every step of the way I knew exactly what was gonna happen next.  It's like watching a bad 60s science fiction TV show where you're supposed to be ""shocked"" by the  ""twist ending"" ....and the entire time you're impatient for the damn thing to just END.... because everything moved so damn SLOW... and you figured out what was gonna happen LONG before it actually happened... and the metaphors were so damn heavy-handed and groan-inducing...

Man it was almost there in the cool-cheese factor though.  If they had just taken the already over-the-top psuedo-creepiness up that last notch into unintentional comedy...well, then it could've been awesome.

Here's the film in a nutshell.  See, like, they're ""pagans"", right?  And they ""sacrifice"" people.  And this policeman visits their remote island.... by himself.....so yeah, uh...real ""shocker"" ending there!",1130630400,10,1003,5.245283018867925
589930,4,6303149200,"I was very happy to finially get to see and now own a copy of the Wicker Man.  Besides being a longtime fan of both Christopher Lee and Edward Woodward, this film covers a topic that is of immense interest to me.  Robin Hardy has gone to enormous lengths to painstakingly create an accurate portrait of the pagan practices of the ancient Britons and Scottish, and he went to equally great lengths to create these scenes in stunning artistic beauty.  Who can argue that the remote Scottish Isles are some of the most beautiful places on earth?

It is with great pleasure that I recommend this movie for anyone to see a true picture of what a pagan ritual might look like.  Of course, minus the unfortunate human sacrifice.  The performances by Edward Woodward and Christopher Lee will satisfy and nothing is left out, much of the information from a historical view is accurate and it is obvious that there was much research in the making of this.

Do see THIS version: alas there is a remake in the works as I write this featuring Nickolas Cage and Ellen Burstyn in the lead roles, changing the locale to the US away from the British Isles, and no doubt will change much of the meaning.  In addition, Robin Hardy himself is suing the producers of the remake to remove his name from the list of credits, as he wants nothing to do with it.

589931,5,6303149200,"Have you ever noticed the really funny thing about Religion? No matter where you go, no people, race, or tribe has ever selected somebody other than themselves as God's chosen people.

Every religion says ""God chose *us* to rule the world!""; none says ""God chose those guys in the next county to rule the World!"".

The most atrocious acts of depravity in the history of mankind have been carried out by one godly set of folks against another: burnings, torture, genocide, suicide bombings, missionaries---all justified in the name of the Divine.

The Enemy, the Heretic, The Infidel: these people are all Evil because they do not recognize the One True God. They worship a fantasy, a False God, or even worse: the Devil himself.

You've probably had lots of discussions with a very religious person; I grew up among them, and I learned in my youth that having a rational argument over the existence of God with the extremely ecclesiastic is useless.

It goes something like this: God exists, He wouldn't have permitted the Bible (the means by which He is made manifest) to exist for millennia if it were false, Jesus is both Son of God and God at the same time, we accept these things-all of which contradict our five senses, the only means we have as humans to perceive the world-on Faith.

But what of Muslims, or Buddhists, or Mormons, or Animists, you might ask? What if you had been born in one of those religions-wouldn't you have been just as sure of your virtue and Rightness, just as convinced of the power of Allah or Buddha or Moroni or Dark Mother Kali, just as bound to take everything on faith, and just as determined to see Christians as the slaves of the Devil? No, says your subject---I would have seen the light and converted.

And take any of the adherents to any of the world's religions, and you'll get the same response. And you also begin to see why religion has persisted for so long: it is emotional body armor, the glue that has bound men together into rough and ready societies for millennia, the single most powerful Meme and primary organizing principle after Food, Shelter, and Sex. Religion is ultimately irrational---by that I mean incapable of being challenged by Reason---because it is founded on Dogma. And when one Dogma meets another, the results range from the Comic to the Grotesque.

With that in mind, ""The Wicker Man"" is a triple threat.

1) Viewed one way, ""The Wicker Man"" is about British Police Sergeant Neil Howie and his awful, terrible, miserable, nasty, not-so-good day, and serves as a fine object lesson in the importance of always calling for backup.

2) Viewed another way, ""The Wicker Man"" is a fable about the very real dangers of epistemological imperialism, in which the by-the-numbers Colonist becomes the by-the-numbers Colonized.

3) Viewed yet another way---""The Wicker Man"" is a little bit of both, and a moody, delicious, haunting little creepshow in its own right---and depicts what happens when one set of True Believers slams headlong into another.

British Police Sergeant Neil Howie (played with stoic reserve by the great Edward Woodward, who puts the stiff in the British Stiff Upper Lip) travels to the remote Island of Summerisle, off the English coast, after receiving a letter from an islander alerting him to the disappearance of a village girl, the young Rowan Morrison (played fleetingly by Geraldine Cowper).

Arriving at the isolated island by seaplane, he proceeds with a standard inquiry into the girl's disappearance, but the rustic islanders are anything but helpful. Sergeant Howie digs in for a long investigation and sets up shop at the local inn, increasingly aware of Summerisle's strangeness, a baroque mix of the whimsical and malevolent.

His investigation is hampered by the island's passive-aggressive residents, who offer two flavors of obstruction: baffled surliness and outright derision. And as director Robin Hardy ratchets up the tension and strangeness, Howie encounters pagan rites, toad-licking, a naked and writhing Brit Ekland, and gratuitous folk-singing. No, Toto, we're not in Southeast England anymore.

Even the courtly Lord Summerisle (played by the immortal Christopher Lee, who appears to be having the time of his career) seems to be in on a joke that no one bothers to tell Sergeant Howie. Certainly he is concerned, he tells Howie; certainly he will help in any way he can---but only moments before, riding up to the brooding battlements of Summerisle's estate, Howie saw a circle of women, naked and lost in ecstatic abandon, dancing and chanting about a fire.

Director Hardy has cobbled together a spellbinder of a film, technically crude (at one point it seemed I was watching outtakes from Woodstock), superficially innocent, but all blood-stained altars and shiny bladed edges beneath the bucolic and charming surface. Edward Woodward was the ideal choice to play Sergeant Howie, a stern, stoic, disapproving Anglican who---much like Summerisle itself---is a man tortured by the undercurrents of desperate wanting beneath his shiny, steely surface. Christopher Lee is equally perfect as Woodward's genteel foil, and to be honest---you've never seen Christopher Lee until you've seen him in ""The Wicker Man"".

Truly creepy, lushly mysterious, supremely confident, ""The Wicker Man"" is an account of precisely what happens when two Dogmatic Tribe---both Chosen People, one side represented by an Island, the other by an outgunned Police constable---meet face to face. Eighties glam-New Wave group Frankie Goes to Hollywood once sang ""When Two Tribes go to war, One is all that you can Score""---but I don't think that's the case in ""The Wicker Man"". See for yourself---but doesn't it seem both sides end up getting precisely what they want?

Half way into  the movie you figure out why's Howie there and what's gonna happen to him. So the finale doesn't come as a shock, but is still powerful to a certain extent.

The Jesus parallels, the true meaning of sacrifice, the nature of faith, questioning the New Testament's Christ died for our sins rhetoric(or was he sacrificed in hopes of favorable crops), pagans avenging a Christian; they are all beautiful concepts.

The movie lacks a feeling of suspense and mystery say like in Don't Look Now where the eerie atmosphere builds up to an unexpected finale. It is also detached in tone, so the viewer is kept at a certain distance at all times.

It is definitely not a horror movie, not even a thriller or really eerie but still provides some unique moments, especially via very authentic looking

rituals and aforementioned concepts.

I also read that a longer version of the movie is available which provides more psychological background on Sergeant Howie and more blasphemous footage. I thought it was nicely shot and edited considering this was directed by a first-timer(and later on butchered by the studio).

You'll enjoy this if you like off-beat movies and have interest in theology and paganism. But if you are a Christian who takes the Bible literally view it at your own risk.",1119052800,4,1408,4.813278008298755
589969,3,6303149200,"There are those who would say that The Wicker Man is a cult classic of horror cinema.  This is somewhat misleading as this movie is only superficially horror and not really good enough to merit classic status.

The movie follows Edward Woodward as a Scottish police detective who visits an isolated island in search of a missing girl.  The islanders are happily non-cooperative, misleading Woodward first into thinking that the girl doesn't exist and then providing vague answers as to her fate.  At the same time, the detective - a priggishly devout Christian - is offended to find that the whole island has gone completely pagan, complete with fertility rituals and sacrifices; in fact, he comes to believe the missing girl is the victim of such a sacrifice.

While somewhat intriguing - enough to merit a weak three stars - there are significant problems with this film.  Made in the early 1970s, this movie does not age well, with a directing style that is distinctly of that era.  The music - and this may be one the most musical ""horror"" movies ever - is also very dated.

Woodward's character is rather unsympathetic, an uptight and sexually repressed zealot who is completely intolerant of the islanders.  Christopher Lee, as the lord of the island, is much more entertaining and likeable.  This leads to a somewhat ambivalent ending.  But the big problem with the movie is that the conclusion hinges on an almost improbable level of manipulation, destroying much of the plausibility the rest of the story has developed.

As stated before, this movie is only minimally horror.  In fact, it is really only a mystery, and not one with much suspense.  From a violence standpoint, it is quite tame, although the sexual content clearly is R-rated.  Of course, most kids would probably be bored by this film, which focuses more on ideas than action.  The Wicker Man is an interesting movie - certainly not without merit - but also skippable.",1118534400,8,1943,4.860182370820668
589970,4,6303149200,"This movie is teeming with metaphor and religous allegory, and for the better part of it one is left wondering which is the more savage-Sgt. Howie's tunnel-visioned Christianity or Summersisle's indifference to human life? Both are equally oppressive in their respective beliefs.

I won't give away the plot twists (and there is a doozy of one for the climax,) but the rundown is this: Sgt. Howie has volunteered to travel to a remote island off the coast of Scotland to find a missing girl. As he questions the inhabitants, they initially deny knowing the girl, then grudgingly admit she used to live among them, and that her spirit has been ""re-born"" into the earth as the trees, water, air and fire. Whether she died naturally or unnaturally is what Sgt. Howie intends to find out.

The movie paces its creepiness rather oddly. We are shown idyllic scenes of townspeople dancing and singing Scottish folk songs, but underneath is an increasing sense of tension and fear as the pious Sgt. Howie not only tries to do his job, but finds it increasingly difficult to defend his faith when up against the weirdly complacent pagan islanders. There are some very disturbing moments (seeing a group of grown men in animal masks menacing our intrepid hero is just one of them) and the climax is one of the best I've ever seen. Just when you think it's going to be over, it racks up another degree, and while not gory, it's psychological violence left me very shaken.

As a Christian, I was somewhat offended by Howie's almost cruel intolerence of a belief different from his own. As a Morman, I had an immeadiate empathy with a group of people whose religon is frequently misunderstood or distorted (no polygamy jokes, please!) And most Celtic peoples did not practice human sacrifice, although the ritual use of the green-eyed horse, the half man and half woman and the fool were part of the traditional May Day celebrations to bless the harvest. The actions of the islanders are those of people disillusioned by science and reason, tired of blind Christian faith. They want to take a more active approach to their well-being, even if it means defying modern law and committing horrific murder to insure the future.

A religon that brooks no tolerance or sympathy with anything other than its own doctrine. Is it Howie's Christianity, or Summerisle's paganism? The Wicker Man leave you to decide.",1113868800,7,2391,4.838630806845965
589971,5,6303149200,"The Wicker Man is a great cult film based on a small pagan community that was being mislead by their newest leader, Lord Summerisle. The creators obviously did a great deal of historical research before making this film while also adding some fiction to spice it up. The idea that pagans used to sacrifice people in a Wicker Man came from Julius Caesar. His account of such events are questionable due to the increasing bias against paganism during the later days of the Roman Empire. The film itself (other then the sacrifice at the end) is greatly steeped in early pagan tradition and includes such acts such as binding the Maypole, and use of the Hobby Horse which is very similar to the now modernized celebrations in Cornwall England.

This is a great horror thriller of how an innocent and well flourishing pagan community is torn apart by the malicious (David Koresh like) Lord Summerisle. If you are watching this as either pagan or monotheist, you should view it as you would any other fictional thriller or horror film. All in all its a great film to have in your collection.

It does represent a clash between two different worldviews, two belief systems - pagan and Christian with the focus on the lifestyle and practices of a small pagan group living on a small island west of Scotland.

The inhabitants are friedly and live their life in harmony with nature and with their own beliefs and practices, according to their own code of morals and ethics.  As much as it may seem bizarre to the outsiders, it is no more bizarre than most other codes - merely different.

Among the rituals this group performs, one requires a sacrifice - yet the sacrifice has to come out of his own free will and has to fulfill three conditions:  he has to be a representative of the law, he has to be a virgin and he has to prove to be a fool.

The Christian man who is intentionally tricked to come to the island is not left without a choice.  He is free to leave any time he wishes.  He is also given plenty of opportunity and even lead in many ways to prove to be an unsuitable sacrifice - to no avail.

Repeated viewings may of course lack the punch since I know the outcome, but the depth & complexity of the content continues to draw me back from time to time.

Howie turns the tables on Lord Summerisle at the end, if he has in fact ultimately won the battle of wits by forcing Summerisle to take a huge gamble.

Edward Woodward stars as the almost unsympathetic, pious, and determined officer who matches wits with Christopher Lee, in a marvelous role of the smiling, ever-reasonable villianous island cult leader.  The entire community seems to be hiding the truth behind the disappearance of a young girl, even to the degree of at first denying her existence.  The very conservative Christian representative of the law has walked into the middle of a very Pagan circle; this conflict has to be resolved.  Initially, the audience may not be too sure who is playing with whom or why.  The climax of the suspense is a twist where the hunter becomes the sacrificial hunted.
Incredibly, the suspense of the plot does not wear off with repeated viewings, thanks to the production values (hats off to all those involved, shooting outdoor spring scenes in November on the coast of Scotland!) and outstanding performances of the cast.
I knew, when I saw it the first time, that the version I had seen of it had been cut down; however, even at the ""sliced salami"" level, it was an extraordinary experience - and experience is the word.  The film puts you right there in the midst of the puzzle.  Over the years I found various cuts of the film, eagerly awaiting what might be reconstructed. (The only other film I can recall searching for this diligently is a ""more complete"" cut of Fritz Lang's ""Metropolis."")
This special edition of ""The Wicker Man"" might well be as good as it gets. Certainly, the inclusion of the backstory of the film (""The Enigma of The Wicker Man"") added to both the theatrical and extended versions makes this particular release worth having.

589977,5,6303149200,"Last week I had the chance to sit down and watch this truly excellent movie.  The Wicker Man stars Edward Woodward, Christopher Lee and Britt Ekland.  I was expecting a sort-of cheap gothic horror film (after all, Christopher Lee is in it) but I got something much better.
Edward Woodward plays a policeman from the Highland Police who has flown to the island of Summerisle to investigate a report of a missing girl.  After discovering that just setting foot on the island is an adventure, Woodward is unable to find anyone who knows the girl who is missing.  Even the girl's mother doesn't know who she is.  A right puzzler.  Forced to stay on the island, Woodward takes a room at the local tavern.  Amidst the bawdy songs and lively music he begins to realize that the island folk are not quite what he is used to.
As his investigation takes him further along Woodward begins to suspect that the island is populated by sinners.  By his definition he is right.  The local population reverted back to their old religion during the early Victorian Era.  They are now firmly entrenched in their old beliefs.  To top it off it just happens to be May Day.  Unable to drop the case, Woodward finds traces of the girl.  He suspects that she is alive but captive and a soon-to-be sacrifice to restore the harvest.  Woodward infiltrates the May Day celebration disguised as Punch.  Then, at a crucial moment, he manages to grab the girl and flee.  Then he learns the real truth.
From the opening credits showing the Scottish Isles and their sapphire waters and the accompanying Celtic music this movie is anything but a cheap horror film.  Woodward plays the epitome of the Christian and the Authoritarian.  Armored only with his belief in his god he must face a setting that, to him, is completely evil.  Young girls being taught the significance of the maypole, naked women jumping through fire to help fertility, march hares in caskets and dozens of other examples.  But it is Woodward who is the strange one.  The people look at him as they would a simpleton.  But Woodward, knowing that god and country are behind him, manages to keep going right to the conclusion of the film.
This classic confrontation of Christian against Pagan is so well done, framed by modern settings and Celtic music, that I can hardly say how good it is.  Woodward's performance rivals his role in Breaker Morant and the young Christopher Lee's talent shows through so clearly that it is obvious why he was cast in so many roles.  The story was written by the same man who brought us Hitchcock's Frenzy as well as the mystery Sleuth.  If you have not seen this 1973 film, I urge you to do so.",1088035200,10,2665,4.607218683651805
590008,5,6303149200,"I have just seen this movie end five minutes ago and will proclaim that this is the shortest period of time before I wrote a review of a movie after watching it.
The plot has been reiterated over 100 times, just scroll down and you can find it.
The movie begins as a mystery with a police officer coming to the town and beginning the investigation of a missing girl. As night falls the movie starts to turn into a campy 70s-80s style horror/gore/porno style flick with the weird singing, gratuitous nudity, and dark and haunting imagery of the graveyard. From this point the viewer will assume that they know the direction in which the movie is headed; headed into a vat of gratuitous nudity and possibly some gory scenes. These images subside rather quickly and we are returned to the mystery imagery. We then see children learning about pagan sex symbols and singing songs about rituals and whatever else. The mystery begins to unfold with an empty desk in the middle of a class in a town with a total of a few hundred residents.
Officer Howie begins to discover more clues and a web of mendacity and conspiracy in the strange town. Soon he is lead down the path to the true nature of the town. I will not divulge the ending to those that have not yet seen it but it is rather dramatic.
The movie's imagery is thoroughly interesting and even if you are not captivated by the exhilerating plot you are sure to be impressed by the interesting surroundings and some of the outright bizarre rituals. Though it may seem that the plot moves a little slowly, everything has relevance to the story.
The movie I beleive is wrongly referred to as a horror movie as there is not a single scene where you will jump up out of your seat, there are however some rather dramatic and powerful images that might disturb you but none that will genuinely frighten. Furthermore the movie does not create the same mood as a horror film partly because the first time director did not know much about creating mood or atmosphere, however this is all ok as I love unconventional movies.
Furthermore the music in the movie is truly unique and every one of the actors has a powerful voice and the instrumentals are also very good, all played on celtic folk instruments of sorts. The movie has enough music to be called a musical however this is the farthest thing in the world from broadway.

590009,5,6303149200,"This movie works on so many levels that it more than makes up for being somewhat dated. Don't be put off by the VERY low-budget production values and you'll be able to appreciate one of the few truly original movies of the last hundred years. From the very beginning when the producers thank Lord Summerisle for his cooperation, you are in for something out of the ordinary.
Detective Howie (Edward Woodward) plays an uptight, overly religious, churchgoing Scottish police officer who makes Ken Starr look like Hugh Hefner. He get a letter from Summerisle claiming that a twelve-year-old girl is missing.
Howie flies to the island in a flying boat to investigate and finds that the locals have something to hide. Not only are they not helping him, not only are they having great fun by jerking his chain, they add further insult to injury by practicing VERY old-style pagan religion. This includes copulating in graveyards, bawdy songs, initiations involving nude girls jumping over flames, or boys dancing around a phallic Maypole. When Howie challenges Lord Summerisle (Christopher Lee in his best performance) about having naked girls jumping over bonfires, Summerisle retorts ""Of course they're naked! It's too dangerous to jump over the flame with their clothes on."" Howie is so exasperated by what he sees (including a woman nursing a baby in one hand and holding an egg with the other on a pew in a ruined church), he smashes an empty crate to make a crucifix out of the scraps of wood in an effort to have some semblance of order.
Howie learns that these pagans aren't just in it for the sex, though. He finds out that the previous year's crops failed and that ancient Celts used to appease their gods by sacrificing virgins to them! Now his search for the missing girl takes on greater urgency...
The character of Detective Howie isn't terribly sympathetic. He is rude, pushy, self-righteous and closed-minded. A fierce bible-believing cop was a bit outdated thirty years ago when this movie came out. He's even more so today. The fact that he's not a sympathetic figure ends up making the viewer feel guilty for not liking him, just as the annoying fat kid does in Lord of the Flies.
Lord Summerisle and his followers at first seem like hippies who make up for their lack of drugs and rock & roll with extra servings of sex. But there's more than fornication going on among the islanders.
The rest of the cast is great, including blonde Britt Ekland's body double for the waist-down shots -even though the double has much longer, brown hair. Another reviewer was right that the guy who picked Ekland's stripper stand-in likes the Jennifer Lopez look!
The innkeeper, the old codgers, the burly fisherman, the missing girl's kid sister, the schoolteacher and county clerk are so perfectly cast, that combined with the low budget and the thanks given to Summerisle for his help in making the film, it almost seems like a documentary.
The ending is truly shocking and will stay with you forever, not just because it's quite possible, even plausible, but because this sort of thing has happened for thousands of years and entire nations have considered it holy.
For a low-budget thriller, this movie will disturb you and make you think about life, death, religion and human nature like few other movies before or since. How many other movies can do that -even the big-budget ones?",1085875200,4,3385,4.837931034482758

It's a good kind of weird, an anachronistic kind of weird, a religious hysteria kind of weird. But make no bones about it, this is not your average movie. Mundanes, move along.
Are they gone yet? Okay good. You're in for one hell of a freaky ride.
The Wicker Man is about an island, run by village folk who harken back to the old ways. And we're talking old ways: sucking on frogs to cure sore throats, dancing around maypoles, dressing up as fools, sacrificing maidens to keep the crops bountiful...oops, I've given away too much.
Enter an incredibly uptight, prudish, extremely Catholic, British police officer. Mix well. Add in some really bad 70s music, Christopher Lee, and a lot of bad photography and you get this movie. Which is not quite a horror movie, although it was released in the tradition of the Hammer horrors. Heck, to date, nobody really knows what to do with this flim. If you're a Christian or worship a non-traditional religion, this movie will likely rattle your cage. And it rattles cages in a good way, raising some thought provoking questions about who is in the right -- the religion that works for the majority, or the established hierarchy of the rest of the world. And really, who's the ""established"" religion anyway? Which came first -- the pagan chicken or the Christian egg?
What a lot of reviews don't mention is the rampant Anglocentricism throughout the film. We have a typical British officer casting aspersions on a Scottish community. For the American equivalent, it might be like a fundamentalist Christian minister visiting an all-black community. There's a lot of history there.
If said blacks suddenly started reenacting African rituals, most people (the reasonable ones anyway) might suspect it of bias. After all, African-Americans, just because of their heritage, didn't hop around shaking spears and dancing around flames. So why, then, are the poor Scottish folk shown as believing in all kinds of pagan beliefs, some of them randomly selected from other cultures?
To Americans, this may not seem like a big deal. To Europeans, or at least to the British, it might seem quaint. To anyone who is Scottish or pagan, it's blatant prejudice. I should know, Maleficent's a pagan, I'm a Roman Catholic, and we know all about the differences between the two religions. This movie does not.
At heart, the Wicker Man was an observation by Julius Caesar about the Gauls. See my Druid History article for more information. Julius was a conquerer, talking about people he defeated -- he was by no means an accurate representation of druidism. And modern Scottish people aren't any more affiliated with druidism than African Americans are affiliated with nature spirits.
The movie was a horror flick preying on the fears of the Europeans -- that Christianity DIDN'T WORK. You don't find that nearly as much these days in America. In the 70s, in Europe, this was a big deal.
However, given its background, we took the movie for what it is: a social commentary, a psychological horror, about the clash between modern and ancient times. As Carl Sagan pointed out in the Demon Haunted World...you can teach people that demons aren't real, but they'll just call them aliens instead.
This movie is worth seeing, if only to experience the crazy ending. But make no mistake: the snide British commentary about how great The Wicker Man constitutes a good part of what makes this film a ""horror.""",1079913600,3,3444,4.878839590443686

DO watch it if you have an interest in things Pagan.
DO watch it if you like campy movies.
DO watch it if you like Christopher Lee.
This movie is not a horror movie. The camp is too much for it to really frighten anyone. It is, however, a delightful film. I won't say that the acting is of high quality except for the cases of Christopher Lee (charming) and Edward Woodward (self-righteous). It's a bad movie, let's be honest. But it is one of those rare bad movies that has a charm all its own, hence its cult status. I've heard people complain that Woodward's character is totally lacking in sympathy. I sort of feel like that's the point. It's ok to empathize with the ""bad guys"" instead. If you've seen Ian McKellen play Richard III on film, you adore that evil manipulative tyrant. Same thing here. I found myself falling in love with this idyllic little Pagan utopia, where kids are taught about the Maypole's phallic symbolism, men and women make love in the fields, and the guy in charge wears a kilt...except for the small fact that they have this nasty little habit of human sacrifice.
Not everyone will like the movie. In fact, it's sort of a ""love it or hate it"" flick. If you enjoy a good bad movie and are interested in Paganism, this will be a delight. If you prefer serious films and don't give a fig about the old religion, well, it's probably not for you.",1079395200,4,1571,4.458333333333333
590015,4,6303149200,"It helps to go into ""The Wicker Man"" with only the barest plot details: a prim Scottish policeman investigates a girl's disappearance in a remote island community.  The film begins with a title card thanking the ""Lord Summerisle"" for his assistance, so you know this, like ""Fargo"" and ""Blair Witch"", is based on real life.  After a panoramic look at the islands off the west coast of Scotland, accompanied by Scottish folk music, Sergeant Howie arrives at Summerisle, and is instantly told by about ten grizzled islanders that he's arrived at ""private property"".  For this is an island where those with Biblical names (Rachel and Benjamin) have long since died, and all the adults and children are named after trees: Myrtle, Willow, Ash, Oak, Rowan.  Christians like Howie no longer have a place here.
This setup is evocative of dozens of Hammer Horror movies and other British television horror (several ""Avengers"" and ""Doctor Who"" episodes spring to mind), all of which begin with the suspicious villagers who clearly have something to hide.  So it's a credit to Anthony Shaffer's script that, as Howie's investigation unfolds, his own sense of revulsion soars right past the usual level of ""disgusted"" and goes all the way to ""mortal fear"".
The theme of the movie is ""hunted leading the hunter"".  It helps to keep an eye out for all the clues Howie misses along the way (at one point, Christopher Lee wearily asks, ""Aren't you supposed to be the detective?"").  When Howie finally finds his objective, that's when the real trap unfolds about him.  I love the staging of the penultimate sequence high on the cliffs, almost as much as I love the staging of the final scene.
Also of note is that the Wicker Man himself, the title character, is not even alluded to until those final moments.  I'm not sure if it helps or hurts that I didn't know what a Wicker Man was until I watched the making-of documentary on the DVD (""The Wicker Man Enigma"") after I'd seen the feature itself.  Maybe I haven't seen enough British pagan horror.  What's undeniable, though, is the effect his appearance has on Howie, and that's where the movie generates its real power.
Look carefully for the DVD's easter egg, what appears to be a 1970's film discussion program from Louisiana.  An overweight American in a powder-blue suit gushes his love for the film to studio guests Lee and director Robin Hardy.  One of the film sequences played on the program is a scene deleted from the theatrical release, and only restored for the DVD limited edition: Christopher Lee and the amorous snails.  The most fun part of this show is when the host enthusiastically compares Hardy to a young American director whose TV-movie debut, ""Duel"", recently found theatrical success on the Continent.  He calls that man ""Steven Shpielberg"".",1078531200,2,2801,4.867368421052632

590017,5,6303149200,"Right as the Hammer horror films were slowly dying out, ""The Wicker Man"" appeared and shocked the British horror scene. Written by playwright Anthony Schaffer (author of the hit play and movie ""Slueth"") ""The Wicker Man"" is a horror film heavy on realistic drama and scene setting, atmosphere and performance, and an intelligent examination of ancient English pagan religions. It was unlike any horror film made up to that time, but many others would follow its example of a realistic approach to the fright flick. Even today, it still has a hypnotic power to pull audiences into its believable world where pagan and druidic rites still survive in beautiful corners of the English isles, and the trick-switch ending is still as shocking and horrifying as ever. Christopher Lee, veteran of many gothic thrillers and horror movies, credits this as his favorite of all his movies, and it's easy to see why. This is one film you won't soon forget.
A police officer (Woodward, in a superb performance that's both prudish and angry), arrives at the isolated Scottish island of Summerisle, where Lord Summerisle (Christopher Lee, brilliant as usual and enjoying getting away from the Dracula Character) lords over a revival of an old pagan fertility religion. Woodward, a devout Christian, searches for a missing girl and becomes more and more horrified at the sexual practices and religious ideas of the otherwise incredibly pleasant people of Summerisle. But the greatest horror is waiting just beneath his gaze...The Wicker Man.
The DVD has a great print of the film, with 5.1 surround sound to present the wonderful soundtrack of tradition Scottish tunes. There's also a revealing 35-minute documentary with interviews with writer Schaffer (soon before his death), Christopher Lee, Edward Woodward, plus the director and almost all the creative people involves. You'll get to see the filming locations as they look today, and be amazed that they haven't changed at all! (But by all means, DON'T watch the documentary before the film; it will spoil the ending for you.)
Even if you claim to dislike horror movies, you should check out ""The Wicker Man."" It is filled with intelligence and ideas that will have you thinking about it for days afterwards. Only a select few horror films can boast of that. (But if casual nudity offends you, as it does Edward Woodward's character, you might want to skip it.

590092,5,6303149200,"With this film's history, especially the struggle to gain realistic distribution and to restore something of the original content, you simply cannot afford to let this superb 2 disc set slip by. It has taken many years to get this much together, and if it were to become unavailable... I strongly urge you to get it while you can.
Whether we will ever see a more complete version is a total unknown, but this exquisitely packaged set offers the fullest version yet seen, primarily consisting of the scenes on the Scottish mainland which set the background to Howie and the mystery letter mentioning the disappearance of Rowan Morrison.
This is unquestionably an Art movie, in the same sense that Jacob's Ladder and Don't Look Now (a Wicker Man stablemate) were. Yet it manages to entertain on many levels, being both visually and aurally compelling.
The soundtrack by the sadly late Paul Giovanni is simply stunning and the recently-released soundtrack album, which includes the haunting Gently Johnny, is another must for the serious fan. The Wicker Man soundtrack has always been the Unholy Grail of soundtrack albums, so again, I wouldn't let it slip away.
There have been so many superb reviews that I won't go into plot details here, but I would like to attest to the excellent job the creators of this wonderful 2 disc set have done, right down to the ingenious wooden case. The Extras are superb, especially the lengthy interview/documentary footage with Hardy and Shaffer and the excellent Ingrid Pitt, Christopher Lee and Edward Woodward. While through no fault of her own, Ingrid's role is barely more than a cameo, Woodward and Lee give some of the best performances of their impressive careers.
While I would not consider the movie to be a Horror movie as such, the suspense builds majestically, and the only violence is entirely in context. Similarly, the nudity is tasteful and entirely valid within the context of a movie set in a pagan community. Britt shines in Willow's temptress dance and Ingrid Pitt delivers a masterfully understated and all-too-brief wordless performance in the search scene where Howie enters her cottage unannounced, to find her in the bath. If you're a total Ingrid Pitt fan, as I always have been, the Step and Slow keys will enable you to savor this vampish delivery.
This is one of those rare movies in which the sets, the music, the casting, the locations, the production and direction and screenplay simply cannot be faulted. Having bought the superb making-of book Inside The Wicker Man from Amazon UK, this double DVD is just the icing on the cake, and I cannot recommend it highly enough.",1073260800,4,2638,4.903803131991052

590094,5,6303149200,"""The Wicker Man"" was always a bit of a disappointment to me because long before I got a chance to watch the movie, I accidentally learned how it ended. Therefore, the final devastating moments of this Christopher Lee/Edward Woodward horror-drama lacked the punch it probably has for most viewers who go into ""The Wicker Man"" totally unaware. Try to avoid learning a lot about this movie before you watch it because I assure you that you will be much happier with the results. Imagine a film about paganism and the philosophical implications of a modern day Christian encountering such a primitive religion, with all of its attendant rituals and colorful ceremonies, alive and well on a Scottish isle and you have the basic premise of this haunting movie. ""The Wicker Man"" is considered by many to be one of the greatest cult horror films ever made, and while I don't think this claim is necessarily true, I still found much to like here.
Police Sergeant Neil Howie arrives on a small island off the coast of Scotland on a mission to follow up an anonymous tip he received about a missing girl. We learn right from the start that the police sergeant is a devout, no nonsense Christian, but even he isn't prepared for the weirdness running rampant through the byways of this community. Right from the start, things on Summerisle seem downright weird. The locals drinking in the pub where Howie procures lodgings are extremely strange folk, as is Willow, the daughter of the inn owner. That very night the police sergeant has an erotic encounter with Willow that is sure to test the faith of the most ardent Christian. Further eeriness rears its head when Howie sees strange goings on at the local school, some of the bizarre customs practiced on the island, and finally meets with the wild haired eccentric Lord Summerisle. It turns out that most people don't seem all that concerned about the missing girl Howie is looking for. Howie rapidly goes from a state of perplexity to one of utter repugnance as he gradually learns the true secrets of the this island: the people here, led by the zealous Lord Summerisle, are practicing pagans who emphatically reject the Christianity so adored by Howie. But as much as the police sergeant thinks he knows, he is in for a very rude awakening as the movie twists and turns to its grim conclusion.
""The Wicker Man"" is a very colorful movie, with plenty of dancing, singing, and great costumes. The music is quite unique, at least for me, and plays a big part throughout the picture. What I liked best about this film was the cast. Britt Ekland turns up in the small role of Willow, the pagan temptress who tries to seduce Howie with a rather sultry dance in the beginning of the film. Christopher Lee is a bit of a question mark here. In an interview included on the disc, he claims that ""The Wicker Man"" was the best role he ever had in a movie. Moreover, he loved the film so much that he personally called film critics in order to help get the film some much needed publicity. Most of what Lee says about his part in this production is a bit of surprise because his character really doesn't appear in many scenes of the film, and when he does show up, he doesn't really do much. Apparently, some missing footage contained several lengthy scenes of Lee as Lord Summerisle, so perhaps this helps explain his limited screen time. The real prize in the film is Edward Woodward in the role of Neil Howie. Like most people, the only exposure I have had with this actor was his stint in the American television series ""The Equalizer"" a few years ago. In ""The Wicker Man,"" Woodward shines as the hard-nosed Howie, a dedicated cop who adequately conveys the sort of outrage concerning the shenanigans on Summerisle one would expect from a deeply religious man. Even though I knew how the film ended, Howie's reactions to his fate still chilled me to the bone. Woodward alone provides the biggest reason you should watch this movie. What a fine actor.
The DVD version of the film boasts an impressive array of extras, specifically interviews with principals Edward Woodward, Christopher Lee, and some background about director Robin Hardy and screenwriter Anthony Schaffer. You even get some information about the conditions endured by cast and crew alike as they filmed the project (poor, poor Edward Woodward and that scared goat!). The controversy surrounding the distribution of the film, which the studio cut and sloppily marketed, is discussed in some detail. Christopher Lee still looks mad over the missing footage, which he claims is probably in someone's basement or attic waiting to be found. The official explanation is that a mistake made while cleaning out a film vault resulted in parts of this film being thrown in the back of a dump truck. Even if this enigmatic footage never surfaces, the film I saw was still massively entertaining. I cannot say that this is the best picture I have ever seen, but its reputation requires all cinema fans to give it a watch. It's definitely unique enough to stand out in the old memory banks well after the closing credits fade to black. Any film that can accomplish that feat is worthy of a five star rating, wouldn't you say",1070323200,5,5211,4.714912280701754

OK I'm sure many people bought this expecting it to be a horror movie because it was made in the 70s and Christopher Lee starred in the movie. This couldn't be further from the truth. It was intelligently written and while it showed it's fair share of nudity - it was enjoyable and had a sense of pastoral quietness that I hadn't seen in movies before. It was funny hearing these pagans breaking into dirty little songs about sex or something related to it.
The one problem with reviewing this film today is that people may presume that the policeman is the guy we should be booing. But I would disagree - I think at the time when this film was released people could relate to the policeman because he was a Christian and I think at the time ( although it's this I'm a little unsure of ) people had a lot more respect for people. To watch something like this was of course a little terrifying for them.
It does bring up what happens when some people's minds are closed when it comes to different religions. It's something that still happens today so the film is far from dated. We see today in the news about Israel and Palestine and The divide in the North of Ireland with the Unionists and Nationalists. It's not something you'll actually get from watching the movie but you'll notice it after you watch the news
As for the movie - enjoy it - have a laugh with the songs and well it's just....just something that seemed out of place in the horror genre

But really that's a misclassification, albeit one made natural by the presence in  the cast of horror specialists Christopher Lee and Ingrid Pitt. In fact it's not really a horror movie at all, more like an erotic mystery thriller. The ending certainly is horrific but you won't spend any time hiding behind the sofa waiting for something horrible to jump out of the shadows and nothing horrible ever does.
Edward Woodward is Sergeant Howie, a policeman in the Scottish Highlands who is sent to investigate the reported disappearance of a child on the fictitious Summer Isle. (In a nice wind-up, the opening credits thank the locals.) This leads to some trouble as Woodward is a stern, conservative and virginal presbyterian while the island, it turns out is an enclave of a rather improbable form of oversexed paganism. And the trouble is not lessened by the almost complete lack of cooperation of the islanders in the in vestigation. At first they deny that the missing girl ever existed and when this is exposed as deception they continue to appear nonchalantly unconcerned. the most interesting thing about the film is perhaps the way our attitude to Sergeant Howie changes as the film proceeds. At the start the Summer Isle seems rather a fun place, all singing and shagging, while Howie is just a dreadful stuffed shirt. However as the film unfolds and the darker aspects of the local religion become apparent and the hunter becomes the hunted, we grow far more disposed to sympathize and identify with him.
It's possible to hear quite absurdly inflated claims made about how good this film is. It is hardly a great masterpiece. In fact at many levels it is a pretty silly piece of nonsense.

So, that evening, I rented the film, brought it back to my hotel room, and viewed it with a couple of the other Jewish speakers.  Nope, it's not about Jews, even though, at one point, six pagans cross their swords to form  a six-pointed star.  That must have been what made the heckler think it was ""Jewish"" -- but the hexagram has been used by many other cultures as well.  Jews do not -- I repeat, do NOT -- practice human sacrifice.
However, many European pagans did -- and therein lies the tale here. The ""Wicker Man"" is about is a village of 20th-century British neo-pagans whose crops fail.

The horror in this case is particularly British in origin, derived not from the ""shock and gore"" tactics of the American slasher flicks (and people wonder why the American murder statistics are so high), but from a school of psychological thriller more favored by British, Continental and even Japanese audiences to a certain extent - witness the original ""Ring"" versus the American re-make.  The psychological thrills and chills here come from the sheer weirdness of Summerisle; the entire concept that a small section of Britain could've remained untouched by the norms of ""civilized Christian society"".  Remember, this is 1970's Britain we're talking about here - many aspects of life on the island would have been deeply shocking to the general viewing public.  The audience at the time I suspect would've felt more strongly motivated to identify with Woodward's police officer than we do now (lack of respect for authority figures hadn't quite taken off to the same extent we feel it now) and he represents onscreen the shock the audience would've felt too - No Church?! Paganism being taught as a religion in School!?!  Public nudity!?!  Perhaps most shocking of all is the explicit encouragement of the plummy, public school Lord of the Manor (played fantastically by Lee).  What is the world coming too if the upper classes are complicit in this depravity!?
The movie is so much more than an extended set-up for the climax.  Deep religious themes are explored, although perhaps again they would be more familiar to a British viewer in the 70's than an American viewer now.  One cannot help but notice the similarities between the Christianity that Woodward represents and the pagan rituals of the islanders, and we are drawn to Woodward's blindness to the similarities, even as he read them out to us.  The film is incredibly atmospheric.  The juxtaposition of everyday small town life portrayed on the island with the incredible isolation and impenetrability of the community is particularly chilling.  Their lack of respect for the authority represented by the police. Their recent fall from prosperity.  These themes would also have struck a chord with Brits in the mid-70s as the country fell into recession, a 3-day working week was introduced, and a country still feeling the economic aftershocks of WW2 was faced with out of control inflation and soaring unemployment.  The collapse of civilization was a topic close to everyone's heart, and to have the undercurrents of anarchy so deeply entwined with this movie would have resonated on a deep psychological level.  The creepy music also helps create a strange atmosphere - all haunting folk songs and bizarre melodies with nary a Jimmy Page solo in sight would have sounded as foreign in the 70s as it does now.
This movie still holds a cult (or occult...) charm over the British psyche even today.  The Mock Turtles not only have a song called ""The Wicker Man"", they also recorded a note perfect cover version of the haunting ""Willow song"" from the movie's soundtrack for their 1990 album ""Turtle Soup"".  Pulp had a song on their 2003 ""We Love Life"" album called ""Wickerman"".  Up and coming British band, The Coral brilliantly recreated large parts of the movie for the video to their 2002 hit ""Goodbye"".  Comedy group ""The League of Gentlemen"" were quoted as saying ""Everything we do is ripped-off ""The Wicker Man"", and it would be hard to believe that the Monty Python boys never saw it before making ""The Holy Grail"".  It is interesting therefore to question why American viewers are less likely to become addicted to the movie.  Perhaps the slow pacing, religious themes and British quirkiness are too much for some people. Perhaps Americans have no concept of what life was like in 70s Britain.  I was amused for example, by the reviewer who suggested the movie was unrealistic because ""also, the officer arrives without a weapon and then neglects to arm himself during the entire length of the film despite repeated instances of insubordination. an officer who is anticipating a confrontation with a large mob would arm himself...you cannot deny that"".  Given that to this day British police officers are armed only with a baton and their razor sharp wit, I find it somewhat anachronistic to suggest that Edward Woodward should have arrived ""packing heat"".  Also, remember, (and those who haven't seen the movie should skip a sentence) when he does attempt to return to the mainland for reinforcements, he finds his plane has been sabotaged.
Other issues raised include the personal dilemma that threatens to rip Woodward apart - is he primarily a Christian or a Policeman?  I find it hard to see how anyone could find this movie offensive, as the treatments of a personal faith in Jesus and a belief in the goodness of mother nature both get a good hearing, and a more rounded treatment than you'd expect from a film.  And I don't think that Britt Ekland's breasts are offensive in anyway, the nudity is essential to the film to show the ""loose moral character"" of the islanders, and to demonstrate how uptight Woodward is.
On a different note, the ""extra minutes"" included on the DVD are somewhat un-necessary.  They look like someone found them behind a radiator 30 years later, there's been no attempt made to make them fit in and they add pretty much nothing to the plot of the film. Still, it's probably good to watch that version once for completeness' sake.  I'd imagine though when you have friends round to watch it (as you inevitably will, this being a movie that you instantly want everyone you know to see) you'll want to show them the regular version, so you won't have to keep apologizing for the terrible image quality every 15 minutes.",1063065600,,5967,4.939
590152,4,6303149200,"In THE WICKER MAN, an English police officer visits a Scottish island, to investigate the disappearance of a young girl.  The island is home to a fertility-based religious cult.  Rampant & picturesque paganism - of the ""Old Age,"" not ""New Age"" variety - deeply offends the devout Christian police officer.
A lot of viewers react the same way as Sgt. Howie when confronted with seemingly gratuitous nudity and musical interludes.  Apparently, people should always wear clothes and only sing on stage, in a studio, or in the shower... not to mention public love-making.  Much of what seems silly in THE WICKER MAN is a natural outgrowth of the subject matter.  The islanders sing and dance and couple with one another, without shame or modesty.  Whereas the viewer can stop the DVD and find something more ""serious"" to watch, Sgt. Howie must solve his case by dealing with these strangely uncooperative people.
The most interesting character is Lord Summerisle, the cult's leader and heir to the island.  As he informs Howie, the Lord's grandfather banished Christianity and resurrected the ""old religion"" to make the people happy.  The present Lord Summerisle speaks as though he knows better than to believe in Grandpa's homespun paganism, but one can not be sure that he does (or doesn't).  People raised on small islands, without radio or television, are bound to develop attitudes and lifestyles that we cannot easily explain!  Such may be the case on Summerisle.
THE WICKER MAN is a most intriguing film that becomes even more interesting with repeated viewings.  It's not a study of paganism, but rather a depiction of the conflict between modern and ancient views of the world.  Obviously, we're accustomed to seeing the ancient view defeated - that's why it's not the modern view, after all... which makes THE WICKER MAN all the more disturbing.
This 88-minute version isn't the best one, but it's not incoherent either, and it looks great thanks to Anchor Bay's restoration work.  The 100-minute videotape (only available on DVD in the double-disc box set) includes some expository scenes that help to explain Sgt. Howie's motivations, but with the videotape you don't get the extras included with this DVD version.",1062806400,,2223,5.057534246575343
590153,5,6303149200,"Few movies from England, with the exception of Hammer Films, have had any profound affect in the United States, especially in the horror genre.  This film, however, in spite of its age, (released in 1974 in a shorter version than filmed) is one of the exceptions.
Filmed on location in Scotland, this startling tale begins as an innocent romp through a Celtic forum and quickly proceeds to some startling practices and beliefs in Celtic themes.
A police officer has been notified of a child who has gone missing on Summerisle.  He proceeds to investigate this and is given the slip on several occasions, which prompts him to believe there is a
conspiracy surrounding this event.  Much to his disbelief, there is.
After witnessing several bizarre events himself, he believes that this missing child may be a part of a pagan sect which will ensure that the coming harvest will be prosperous.
Beautiful photography, music and scenery only enhance this somewhat murder mystery.  The ending is only for those who need to see it as it is not what anyone expects at all.  Pay attention, however, and you MAY figure it out!  Highly recommended viewing, some brief nudity and sexual overtones gave this an R rating and is not recommended for the younger audience.

Words like ""brilliant"" and ""terrifying"" have been thrown around. Phrases like ""greatest motion picture of all time"" abound. And I'm honestly hard-pressed to understand why. It's not like I have some bizarre or twisted perspective on what's good and what's not. I like to think that I have relatively decent taste in movies, but if ""The Wicker Man"" is the barometer by which all taste (good or bad) will be judged, then let me be found guilty of the latter.
It's not that I'm a member of the shameless and all-too prevalent ""instant gratification"" club. I enjoy a storyline that takes its time and draws you in, unfolds before you. But the instant I'm confronted with ridiculous musical numbers, I'm a goner.
""The Wicker Man"" nearly lost me in the first fifteen minutes as the strains of celtic folk gave way to a lousy lip-synching act from a naked, gyrating Britt Ekland. Now, please understand that I'm no prude (and if you knew me well you'd know what an understatement that is). And the sight of the aforementioned Miss Ekland hopping around her bedroom like a nymphomaniac set loose in a brothel would most likely have instilled in me a sophomoric glee if the motion picture I set out to watch was, in fact, a musical--or a Burlesque flick. But as a rule I disdain choreographed dance sequences in my horror movies. Call me picky, but it just doesn't set the mood right.
Which brings me to the final complaint I will allow myself this day on ""The Wicker Man"" (for I fear I've spent too much time opining on something that I'd just as soon forget all about). According to everything I have read, this was director Robin Hardy's directorial debut, and it shows in his inability to establish atmosphere, and in his obvious lack of understanding that one of the most useful tools in creating atmosphere is the use of music. Sure, celtic folk sounds right at home in the Scottish isles but if you're shooting for anything above a dated travel guide, it might be a good idea to invest in a soundtrack.
All in all, and for all the wonderful things I have heard about this movie through the years, ""The Wicker Man"" was just about the most disappointing and frustratingly BAD movie I have seen in years. And I warn anyone who isn't quite sure what to expect to take these words into consideration before spending an hour and a half of precious time finding out for themselves.",1059091200,21,2677,4.626050420168068

How did apparently conservative actors get cast for this?
Is there something about old English paganism we haven't really thought through (one for the modern Stonehenge Druid wannabes)?
Was there any SCPC (or Royal SPCA) oversight on this movie, especially in the last scenes, which I shall not describe?
This is a viscerally disturbing movie, and if you get the longer version, which I recommend, you'll love it even more.
It has the classic 70's opening, with bland theme music and the promise of a stodgy police caper, and doesn't really nail you until the pub scene, when the otherwise normal locals join in a bawdy song about banging the innkeeper's daughter.

I have some interest in the new age movement and its purported derivation from pre-Roman Celtic religion. Yet I'm well aware that the largely agrarian world of the Celts was a harsh and violent environment, with animal and sometimes human sacrifices often accompanying the more peaceful and hoistic spritual aspects.
This film depicts that blood-based world (put into a modern situation and context) magnificently.
As a depiction of modern communal paganism it is very realistic, even though most new-agers would despise the emphasis on sacrifice and blood-letting.

590157,5,6303149200,"So says Lord Summerisle in The Wicker Man, a true cinematic rarity, an original, and intelligent, horror film, just as Kubricks 2001 is the quintessential intelligent Sci Fi film. Boasting a superbly constructed story, an exemplary caste tailor made for their roles, and a truly shocking and disturbing ending, The Wicker Man is a masterful exercise in escalating dread, with a harrowing climax that will leave you drained.
I once heard this film referred to as the Citizen Kane of horror films, but if I were to compare it to one of Orsons greats, I would say it bares a closer resemblance to the Magnificent Ambersons. The reason for this is plain when youve searched for the film in the  database; you find two listings, The Wicker Man, and The Wicker Man (Limited Edition). The former is the original cinematic release of the film, butchered and incomplete, the latter is a restored version that gives us 11 minutes of unseen footage, most of it important back story fleshing out the central character of Sergeant Neil Howie, wonderfully played by Edward Woodward. I said a restored version, because whats presented to us is still not the complete film, but for more on that you have to watch the excellent documentary included in the extras.
Without giving too much away for those who haven't seen it, the basic story is as follows. Sergeant Howie - monstrously uptight and VERY Christian - a policeman on the Scottish mainland, receives an anonymous letter from Summerisle, off the Western Coast, telling him about the disappearance of a young girl, Rowan Morrison, and hinting at dire events to come. Howie flies off to the isle alone to investigate, and collides headfirst with the pre-Christian, or Pagan, belief system practiced there.
Everywhere is godless symbolism; pagan fetishes, rampant lasciviousness, a mother putting a frog into a childs mouth to cure a sore throat, the villagers, and even the Rowans own family, denying all knowledge of the girl. As if that wasn't enough, the good Sergeant Howie discovers something that for him, is absolutely the final straw a ruined and desecrated church.
With his search for the girl being stonewalled at every turn, and the realization that, from his point of view, the islanders are an utterly godless bunch, our hero turns, in high dudgeon, and extreme exasperation at the islanders beliefs and practices, to the head of the community, Lord Summerisle, played with relish and splendid urbanity by non other than Christopher Lee!
His assumption that a Lord of the Land will behave in a civilized and Christian manner is rudely dashed when he sees young girls dancing naked round a fire in the Manor grounds. Incredulous at this wanton display, he takes his Lordship to task, to which his Lordship calmly replies, Well naturally! It's much too dangerous to jump through fire with their clothes on! Poor Sergeant Howie really is out of his depth, his Lordship not only condones the godless rituals of the islanders, hes their spiritual leader, We are a deeply religious people, he gently admonishes the blustering police officer.
With the knowledge that he is utterly alone, Sergeant Howie determines to discover the truth about Rowan Morrison. As distasteful as it is to him, he investigates the island religion in the local library, and becomes convinced that young Rowan is being held against her will, to be used in some dreadful pagan ritual. From here the story accelerates to its harrowing conclusion, one that made my blood run cold when I saw it first, and still has the power to unsettle, all these years later.
This is an extraordinary film, literate and lyrical, part horror film, part investigative thriller; it is a film I think you could genuinely say is unique, just don't expect any chainsaws or psychos! The performances are all 5 Star, with Christopher Lee in particular stating in the documentary something I have heard often over the years, that it is his favorite performance an opinion I certainly would NOT disagree with! In fact I would go so far as to say that I think Lee and Woodward have never been better.
As I said before, the Limited Edition is, without a doubt, the version to watch, but be warned, whilst the transfer of the film is excellent overall, the restored footage is of noticeably inferior quality although it does come in a very cool wooden box! Another element of the film that deserves recognition is the soundtrack; written especially for the production, it has a wonderful late 60s/early 70s folk feel about it, which adds immensely to the atmosphere of the film. And the documentary Ive mentioned? Excellent! The makers managed to sit down with all the major player in the film, including Woodward and Lee, indeed, this is one of the most extensive interviews Ive seen with Lee, who has his own theories as to what actually happened to the original Wicker Man footage! If you are looking for an intelligent and unsettling film experience, then The Wicker Man is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1049500800,15,4989,4.9041420118343195
590158,2,6303149200,"""The Wicker Man"" is yet another cult film that delivers much less than it promises. The problem is that the director - despite being the writer's friend! - doesn't understand how to turn a script that's almost all atmosphere and ""suggestion"" into an effectively scary film.
A Sturges or Mankiewicz script has almost everything spelled out in the dialog; even an incompetent director couldn't totally ruin it. But a mystery/horror film that builds to a surprise ending needs to start that build at the very beginning and not let up. ""The Wicker Man""'s direction is far too flat and literal for this to occur. And when the trap is sprung (so to speak) at the end, the film slogs to its conclusion, rather than rushing to its violent shock ending.
""The Wicker Man"" would have been far more effective had it had been directed by Jacques Tourneur, who repeatedly demonstrated he knew how to scare an audience without actually showing anything. Take, for example, ""Curse of the Demon."" Even without the ""literal"" beginning and ending tacked on by the producer, the film is creepily suggestive and even frightening, even though we see little of the supernatural - until the end.
Another good example is ""Mimic."" The basic idea is so preposterous that the film can work only on atmosphere - and del Toro delivers. The build-up is so effective that we accept the ridiculous, biologically impossible monsters when they appear.
The two-disk ""Wicker Man"" set contains the heavily cut theatrical release on the first disk, along with an excellent documentary about the making of the film. The transfer is crisp, with very clean, natural color. The second disk is the longer, less-heavily-cut cut, with the deleted scenes inserted from a 1"" videotape transfer of that version. The insertions are plainly visible, with no attempt to sharpen the image or correct the color balance.
The deluxe set comes in a nice wooden box. Perhaps, when your pet gerbil dies, you could put him in the box and incinerate it.",1045267200,7,1992,4.896449704142012

Aside from that, it's a magnificent film and well worth the cost of the DVD.",1045267200,2,346,4.3076923076923075
590219,5,6303149200,"This is not a horror movie in the generally understood sense, but since it has Christopher Lee in it, I guess people expect that it will be. But be prepared for something more cerebral: the Wicker Man won't have you leaping behind the sofa (well, not out of fright, at any rate) but it will tax your sensibilities: a sense of dawning, slowly spreading dread will get under your skin. That's a far more difficult stunt for a director to pull off.
For all this sense of dread, the Wicker Man is a considered rumination on a clash of beliefs. Woodward, a man who throughout his acting career has managed to personify pompousness, is superbly cast as an out-and-out prude of a Christian policeman, lured from his beat on the conventional Scottish mainland to an isolated Scottish Isle to investigate an allegation of a missing person. The isle quickly reveals itself to be (in Sgt. Howie's view) a den of disgusting iniquity, its population given over to the practice of pagan rites in place of decent, traditional Christian Values. The epicentre of activity is the local pub, the Green Man.

This is the first score the film makes: the Green Man is a figure from Celtic myth and the rituals and beliefs associated with it have been around, in the British Isles, longer than Christianity itself.

And the pagans run rings around poor, starched Sgt. Howie. Howie fulminates, he fumes, and bridles beneath his policeman's uniform, of which he barely removes even his hat. The locals, by contrast, are quite happy to remove pretty much everything, indulging in sins of the flesh in nearly every direction that Howie can turn. Christopher Lee is marvellous as the gentrified spokesperson for this way of life. He remarks to Howie that he could live with the animals: ""They do not lie awake in the dark and weep for their sins."" Howie, by contrast, postively revels in weeping for his, and those of the islanders.

So scores point number two - Christians: who do you think you are, imposing your own subjective values on a bunch of people who, minding their own business, are getting on just fine, thank you very much? In the current global climate, this question has a real resonance.

Screenplay writer Shaffer alludes to another ancient pagan mythology in developing this point: One night Howie is tempted, like Odysseus, by a singing siren in the form of Landlord's daughter Britt Ekland, knocking on the his wall and enticing him to sample her wares. By the skin of his teeth (and by dint of staying the other side of the wall) Howie maintains his Christian composure, though I daresay viewers will have trouble doing so: it is an extraordinarily erotic scene. But it is not gratuitous: in steadfastly refusing to give himself over to temptation, Howie unwittingly sets himself up for the awful resolution of the film.

It is difficult to discuss much of the rest of the Wicker Man without giving the game away, and this rob the film of much of its impact. Suffice to say it's a truly startling, haunting finish, the final scene instilling real dread and horror not so much in Howie's own predicament (although this is surely dreadful enough), but the viewer's realisation (which Howie himself never makes) that his whole scheme of belief will not save him or in any way mitigate his own fate.

Oddly this ending met with approval amongst church leaders, who pronounced the film profoundly christian in depicting Howie's heroic final stance. That's not how I saw it: to my eyes the entire film is an essay in the futility of Christian thought: as he rails impotently against the inevitable fate he has brought on himself, it is Howie himself who is the Wicker (i.e., straw) Man.

And at his demise, the sun comes up on the isle, as if nothing had happened.

590221,5,6303149200,"""The Wicker Man"" is one of those films that I had heard great things about for several years before it finally came to an art theater in town and I was able to see it.  My initial response was one of disappointment, not because I found the film to have major flaws or anything, but simply because my expectations had been raised to the level of something like ""Citizen Kane,"" ""The Seven Samurai,"" or at least ""Psycho.""  In retrospect, the problem is more that the film is characterized as a horror film (Christopher Lee has a major role) and ""The Wicker Man"" does and does not fall into that category.  Certainly very few horror films take place so much during the daylight hours.
When Sgt. Howie (Edward Woodward) of the West Highland Police comes to the isolated Scottish island of Summerisle to search for a missing schoolgirl, Rowan Morrison, he finds that something a bit more disturbing that the secrets kept by the locals.  Howie, a professed Christian, is repulsed by the open devotion of the people to the Old Gods, complete with pagan rituals and open sexuality.  Even worse, these abhorrent practices are endorsed and encouraged by the local Lord.  They also refuse to help with his investigation, more out of a sense of detachment rather than as a concerted effort to keep Howie from discovering the truth. He wanders the town and the surrounding countryside, and it from this footage of the Scottish highlands that you get the sense there are things older than civilization and Howie is an interloper.
Howie's suspicion is that young Rowan was sacrificed by some sort of cult headed by Lord Summerisle (Lee), but he is half-right in that horrible way that becomes suddenly and tragically clear at the film's climax.  The grand irony of the film is that Howie is being judged and found wanting, just as he is doing the same of others.  Besides the climax, the most memorable scene in the film is when the local sex siren, Willow (Britt Ekland) keeps the sergeant awake by dancing naked outside his door (I have to point out that a body double was used for some of this scene and that Ekland's voice was dubbed in the film).  Howie obviously suffers from a repressive idea of Christianity where his carnal desires torment him even more than the horrible crime he suspects has been perpetrated.  Another delicious irony of Anthony Schaeffer's script is that the character of Howie, who obviously cannot handle the sexual freedom of the Sixties, is confronted by its implications in a remote village that harkens back to the old days.
""The Wicker Man"" is a rare horror film since the key person in its success is writer Anthony Shaffer (""Frenzy,"" ""Sleuth""), whose script takes ancient Druid practices, pagan rites, and the origins of the celebration of May Day to give the story a sense of authenticity bound more in fact than fiction (cf. Dracula/vampire movies).  The script also takes advantage of our expectations that Howie is the film's ""hero,"" so that we become victims of the storyteller as much as the main character.  In fact, this film works so well because it violates certain key expectations we have about horror films while seeming to embrace them.
I know it will be seen as heresy, but I think ""The Wicker Man"" would have benefit from casting someone else other than Christopher Lee.  While the actor's presence is obviously strong, just looking at him makes you think that ""The Wicker Man"" is going to turn into a Hammer monster movie at any moment.  I mean, because it is Lee, we are not surprised that his character is even weirder than the townspeople, the same way that we are not surprised Eklund is running naked at some point in the film.  In a film which works best when it works against our expectations in terms of the story, should follow the same logic with the casting as well.
FINAL WARNING:  If you have never seen ""The Wicker Man,"" avoid watching trailers or anything else before you screen it for the first time.  When you go back and watch these things after the film you will know why.",1036800000,17,4030,4.693617021276595

It's happened to a number of fine films; Welles' The Magnificent Ambersons, Gilliam's Brazil. It's no surprise that this well written suspense thriller from the late Anthony Shaffer (Sleuth, Frenzy)and Robin Hardy was sliced and diced. What's truly tragic is that the bulk of the footage is in a landfill under a freeway in England.
Future Blade Runner producer Michael Deely hated The Wicker Man and proceeded to have it disemboweled (much like the hatchet job that was done to Blade Runner). This special edition is unique in a number of ways: 1) It includes 11 minutes of important footage that helps clarify the story and movitations. 2) It features both versions (the restored version was assembled from a print given to Roger Corman when he bid on the distribution rights)of the film. 3)The documentary discusses the origin of the film, what went right (very little) and wrong (a lot)during production and post-production. All the main actors are interviewed as are director Hardy and writer Shaffer. 4)The special edition of the film comes packaged in a unique wooden box with the imposing logo and wickerman burned into the cover.
I'd recommend reading amazon.com's plot synopsis. They do a pretty good job of summarizing the film. If you're not interested in the restored edition, pick up the theatrical release. It also includes the documentary and the trailers. The print is pristine.
Anchor and Bay have once again done an outstanding job on this low budget minor English classic. It features one of Christopher Lee's finest performances. Edward Woodward does a great job as the police inspector (the role was originally written with Peter Cushing in mind. Cushing was detained due to another film role).

What he finds there is a pagan culture, who appears to be manipulating him for something. What that is I won't tell you, but it is a shock, and an investigation in the old religion of England. This is a horror film, a detective story, suspense, and musical. There are many layers to this film, and explores different subjects. The main one is religion, and truth. The visuals are quite spectacular. The music is beautiful. For those interested in paganism, or old nature religions, you will find this interesting. This could also be interesting to Christians because it shows a man of faith standing strong with his beliefs. Anthropologists will also like this film, because it deals with exploring different cultures, and the limitations we have coming from a different culture. The acting in this film is right on, and believable. You should watch with an open mind. 5 stars, check out this cult classic.",1035158400,2,1025,4.862857142857143

At first rejected by the production team and crew itself, it wasn't soon before it was slated by critics as a neglectful mishmash of porn-like images pasted together by silly glue. Straight-faced Sgt of police, Neil Howie (Woodward) is sent from the mainland to the remote Scottish island of Summerisle to investigate the strange disappearance of a young girl named Rowan Morrison. Before long, Howie is under the spell of the landlord's daughter, Willow (Ekland) and his Christian roots have to face his deep desires as she attempts to enchant him to her room. For the last 40 minutes, your thrilled by the second as the story slowly unravels to a harrowing climax that will stay with you for nights to come.

590226,5,6303149200,"I came to this film somewhat reluctantly: being quite sensitive about treatment of religion, and the sort of person who steers well clear of things like 'The Life of Brian,' I did abandon it not far in, but came back. I'm glad I did.
It's immediate appeal is as a mystery, which holds you; it is also quite beautiful in its photography, and haunting music. What I took away with me however is the horrific ending.
Now, there is a twist at the end, as in many films, but the impact is made by the sheer horror of the lead character facing being burned alive, watched by happy islanders singing and dancing against a backdrop of the island coast. The strength of Edward Woodward's character is his fallibility: he is a priggish, unforgiving Christian - maybe this makes him easier to identify with, rather than a paragon. As he is led up the hill to the place where he will die, he literally freaks out. Before he dies, he begs forgiveness, in an outpouring of passion and anger.
The parallel of the sacrifice is obvious but powerful, and Woodward's performance amazing. The Wicker Man rises above its place as a horror/mystery to become a parable of how a community can be brainwashed, of how evil can spread, and ultimately as a disturbing and unforgettable portrayal of one man's refusal to abandon his faith in the face of death. It moves and inspires.",1030320000,4,1354,4.599173553719008

Christopher Lee shows he can be menacing without fangs. Edward Woodward is excellent as the pious Christian policeman sent out to the Summer Isles to investigate a missing-girl report - to discover an island that has regressed to pre-Christian religion.

590258,5,6303149200,"FILM: I stumbled upon The Wicker Man purely by acccident-never heard of its existence until I did a search for another movie on ... and this movie was recommended in addition to the one I was looking for.  I looked at the positive reviews and decided to give it a shot.  Boy, I'm glad I did!  The Wicker Man is an extremely interesting and thought provoking film despite its very low budget; in fact, because of the limited budget the movie comes off more realistic, and almost has a home movie feel to it.  But the most memorable thing about The Wicker Man is the originality of the script--I have never see another movie like it or at least one that is as well-made.  The beautiful--and slightly sinister--locations where the movie was shot will have you yearning to visit Scotland and looking to find the GREEN MAN BAR, where many of the scenes were shot.  Despite being pegged as a cult movie, the film takes its subject matter very seriously and deals with it in a very challenging manner; in lesser hands the movie probably would of come off like a bad joke and instantly forgotten.  There is a reason why people are still talking about the film today.

The movie starts with Sgt. Howie(Edward Woodward)coming to Summer Isle, which is located off the coast of Scotland, to investigate the complaint of a local resident about the disappearance of a young girl, Rowan Morrison.  When he gets there and starts to ask questions about the girl, he gets nothing but evasive and elusive answers from the citizenry, obviously not embracing the presence of an outsider in their close-knit community.  The more Sgt. Howie investigates the more he sees that the people of Summer Isle are devotees of a pagan culture that worships phallic symbols and believes in free love and reincarnation.  All of this comes as an abomination to the deeply Christian--if not slightly outdated and prudish--values of Sgt. Howie.  Despite his disgust at all of this, little by little he starts to piece together some of the hard to find clues, and begins to see an more ominous picture developing--Rowan Morrison and how her disappearance relates to the failure of the crops which the community depends on to live.  All this leads up to and ending that will send chills up and down your spine.
Though this movie is not going to appeal to everyone's tastes, I found the story of the survival of a pagan culture in modern times and how it relates to Christianity to be a very interesting study on the way we treat people whose religious beliefs are different than our own.  But besides those more profound themes, the movie also contains elements of horror that are very subtle but just as real.  Edward Woodward gives a solid performance as the repressed Sgt. Howie, and Christoher Lee is excellent as the smiling Lord Summer Isle.  Through an ingenious script, solid acting, and loads of atmosphere, it's no wonder the movie has since become a cult classic.
DVD: I have the limited edition version, which features the theatrical version and the longer version without all the cuts.  I'm probably in the minority here, but I like the shorter version better.  While the longer version gives you some more background information on Sgt. Howie and Lord Summer Isle, it also slows down the film somewhat compared to the shorter version.  I was able to piece together most of the missing pieces on my own from the shorter version, while enjoying the quicker pace.  Plus, the missing parts in the longer version are not up to the visual standard of the rest of the film and stand out awkwardly.
The DVD also includes a little documentary on the making of the film, which any fan should not be without.  It is very informative and includes interviews with most of the major players in making the film, and how hard it was getting it released.",1027382400,11,3812,4.693693693693693
590259,4,6303149200,"This film has one basic fault. It's too short.
  That's not the fault of the writer or director, but the studio that hacked the film to pieces. A limited edition exists which contains both the shorter version (like this one) and the full-length version that the movie was intended to be.
  Oddly enough, the thing that the Wicker Man most reminds me of is not the many British horror films of the late 1960s and early 1970s -- it's the cult-TV series The Prisoner. Both take place in strange, isolated communities with a mounting sense of paranoia ... and playfulness.
  There's a lot of humour to be had in the film. And terror.
  Visually, it's just perfect... Summerisle looks as well as the opening dedication would suggest it is. And Christopher Lee proves once again why is the master.
  It's a smart, educated and clever film.
  Oh, and the songs are especially good. I'd love a copy of ""Corn Rigs"" and ""There was a tree...""
  So, is it a horror film or not? Who knows? Who cares? It's an entertaining way to spend an hour and half (or more if you get the longer version).

590260,5,6303149200,"I remember watching Wicker man a few years back, and being completely blown away by its power. It has earned itself a 'cult' status,although it is an unfair description, usually given to films that are very good, unseen at its time of release, but rediscovered and reassessed years later.
And Wicker man is very very good. It is the type of film that slowly builds up to an ending that makes all the 'twists' directors nowadays like to include, pretty predictable.
Its mood is slow, but very misleading, at it pulls you unawares into this evil world, disguised as this idealic and peaceful Scottish village. It gives a new meaning to Nothing is what it Seems..and the darkness of people is perfectly contrasted with their seemingly normal lives, a bit similar to Lynch's Twin Peeks, but much more poignat and effective.
It is a horror film like no other, one that is directed at your mind and psyche, as opposed to the regular gore fest most horror films rely on.
The film was mercilessly cut for its VHS release and its TV showing, which makes me wonder about the psychological state of the censors!!, but gladly the film has been restored for its DVD release with excellent extras.
It is a film that can be seen again and again, and everytime you will react the same way to it, and watch in disblief  at an ending that will DISTURB YOU!!

590261,4,6303149200,"After hearing so much about ""The Wicker Man"" I assumed that when I finally watched it I'd be let down. Happy to say that my assumption was wrong. Sure it is very hokey in some scenes, extremely campy and dated in the early 70s. In fact, at the beginning of some of the musicals numbers I started cringing at how corny it was. However, by the time the song ended I was enchanted by the bizarreness of it all. In the grand scheme of things these quirky aspects only added to the otherworldly charm of Summerisle.
After ""The Wicker Man"" ended I sat there going ""Hmmm. Pretty good, but not all that impressive."" A few hours later, I was still thinking about the film. Hours became days and I finally realized how much this movie stuck in my subconscious. Upon rewatching it, I was pleasantly amazed how good of a film ""The Wicker Man"" is. How the filmmakers presented a pagan society in modern times was particularly interesting. Though certain historical elements were twisted to fit the film, it was reassuring to see that ""The Wicker Man"" was fairly well researched. What makes the film so effective is it's ambiguity. Who is actually ""good"" and who is ""evil?"" The pagans or the christians? Sergeant Howie or Lord Summerisle? Is the idea of religion in general at fault? Lots of interesting questions. Unique idea. Great ending. A fun performance by Christopher Lee. All add up to a really good film. Modern pagans will get a huge kick out of this one.",1020816000,2,1451,4.584615384615384
590262,4,6303149200,"A devout Christian policeman is investigating the whereabouts of a missing girl in an isolated, pagan Scottish community. He soon finds himself entangled in a web of strange rituals which seem to be the exordium of some horrible, unimaginable deed. Unable to decode the hidden meanings of the rituals of a cult that is foreign and, indeed, hostile to him, he continues his search in the hope that he will find the missing girl. His perseverance ultimately affords him an answer to all his (and our) questions; but there is a price to pay.
 More than a feast of gore this film is a fascinating examination of the clash of two systems of beliefs. The policeman is the bringer of law and order (enforcing indirectly Christian priorities and values). The island community has opted instead for a pagan lifestyle reflecting the beauty and brutality of Nature. Eventually both sides appeal rigidly to their respective gods for mercy (the island community for a good crop, the policeman for help). Both sides gesticulate emptily, in a Universe that doesn't care, the hidden meanings of their words and acts only understood to those who share similar beliefs. The gods remain silent and mercy is not to be found.
 A beautiful film, somewhat permeated by hippy ideals (but even that being to its advantage), with a climax that leaves you gasping for breath. Performances are uniformly excellent but Edward Woodward deserves special mention for his riveting performance as the puritan, austere but well-meaning policeman. Robin Hardy's direction is evocative, enigmatic, shocking.",1020297600,4,1570,5.1050583657587545
590263,5,6303149200,"This movie has often been called the ""Citizen Kane"" of horror films. But I wouldn't describe it as a horror film. It is like an Irish musical, mysterious whodunit, pagan drama and a suspense-filled, erotic allegory of the age-old srtuggle between Paganism and Christianity. Coming from a Christian's perspective, I found it to be an allegory of Paganism versus Christianity without taking either side. Although the Christian was a total (expletive of your choice here), I never found myself wanting to abandon my beliefs and become a pagan. This movie has some incredible moments, like Britt Ekland's song and the ""Landlord Daughter"" number. The ending is almost like watching Unbreakable or The Sixth Sense where there's that moment you finally realize it all. There is some nudity, brief sexuality and mild language if any.

590264,3,6303149200,"There is a well known addage in movies that we all get what we have coming to us.  The same can be said of this movie, whether in regards to the protagonist or the viewer his or herself.  To begin with, I saw a version of the Wicker Man on video years ago and wouldn't have even given it a star for a rating.  The story was chopped up so badly that I felt like the editor had gone to work on me instead.  The limited edition presents the theatrical release and the 'European version' of the film.  A big note of thanks should go to Anchor Bay for seeing that the story line makes better sense this time-and this goes for both versions.
  To get down to it, this is a movie about sex, or the fertility rites of a certain island just west of Britain in the springtime.  Edward Woodward does a fine job as a police inspector duty-tied to both his job and his religion.  Everyone else, including Christopher Lee seems superflous, however.  Oddly enough, this almost seems to work for the movie, which is in effect about unresolved sex and red herrings.  Considering the overt sexuality and eroticism of the movie, I found the ending to be a little disturbing.  The movie itself can be said to be a metaphor about the dangers of falling down the wrong rabbit hole after you have tried long and hard enough to do so.
  Voyeurs be warned, there is no actual love making going on on screen.  Yet, this is a very sexy and erotic movie, which I guess serves to make the ending more disturbing.  Visually, this film is first class.  Shot on location, the outside shots are gorgeous.
  Wicker Man is not what you would call the most nailbiting of horror movies.  The answer of whether our protagonist gets the ending suited to him will probably be found by asking the question of whether you deserved to sit and watch this film for its eighty some odd minutes.  There are many better movies out there that deserved a limited edition release more than this one.  The film that comes most to mind is ""Vampire Circus"", a movie that has consistently been rated highly by critics, and that has been conspicuously left unreleased by Anchor Bay.  Hopefully they will come around and give THAT film the release it receives.",1018828800,2,2203,4.438902743142145
590265,3,6303149200,"Let me begin by saying The Wicker Man is one of my favorite movies...
A friend gave me this DVD and I was excited to see ""The Wicker Man Enigma,"" the 32 minute ""making of the movie"" included here. HOWEVER I was blown away that the 88 minute ""American release"" version was featured on the rest of the DVD! Particularly after ""The Wicker Man Enigma"" went on about how the footage removed took so much away from the final film. I simply can't believe that no attempt was made by the producers of this DVD to use the longer version.
I have the 101 minute version on video and it is vastly superior. The movie makes much less sense in the 88 min copy. Chopped out bits include more background on Sergeant Howie (his fiancee, feelings about sex and deep religious convictions), how he received the letter about Rowan, not to mention other vital parts such as a scene with Lord Summerisle presenting a young man as a sexual offering to Willow and others. Also unfortunately abbreviated are many of the songs such as Willow's dance, Lord Summerisle and Miss Rose's song, etc. Some scenes are switched around to ""make more sense"" here, presumably after the film was butchered.
To anyone who has only seen the 88 minute version, I HIGHLY recommend trying to get a copy of the long version, it is like a completely different film. This is worthwhile only for ""The Wicker Man Enigma.""",1014422400,230,1372,4.558704453441296

Now, there are parts that I suppose seem a little silly to some--Christopher Lee singing a ballad to a snail comes to mind--but I frankly enjoyed those moments.  You just need to listen to the words.  There happens to be a lot there.

A constable gets an anonymous letter about a missing female child on local island. The island is known for its bounty of vegetation. He is a pious man; his underlings joke about his virginity.
 He sets off in his plane to investigate. The residents give him a hard time; they tease him and lie about the child he is looking for.
 As he investigates, he notices with revulsion blatant sexual displays, such as anantomical shaped pastries, trees cut to resemble penises and so on.
 He finds mysterious information about the missing child. So he decides to overnight at the local inn. When the landlord's daughter emerges (Britt Eckland)a terrific bawdy song is sung by all- except our dour fellow. She enjoys the tune, but our pious investigator, who is not yet aware he is being led about by his nose, sure does. Disgusted to his core, he goes for a walk, only to find nearly the entire town fornicating in the local cemetery.
 As he tries to sleep, Britt, dances against the thin wall of the inn to disturb him. She is naked, hot and it is one darn erotic dance. Virgin man is in agony; he tries to ignore what he hears and tries even harder not abuse himself.
 The next day is May Day. Everything on display is sexual.  Virgin guy meets with the Lord of the Island, Summerall (Christopher Lee in one of his best roles). He refuses to answer any questions, but implies to the constable a human sacrifice will be held on May Day so the fall fruit harvest will be bountiful again. The lord takes pleasure in teasing a man who is saving himslf for marriage; he shows him fertility dances of naked women and anything else that will shock the socks off pious boy.
  Mr. Pious is determined to stop the sacrifice. The island celebrates the first of May the old fashion way. Costumes, dances, sword games and finally a bonfire at the beach. The investigator, blood boiling, manages to get in costume and go along with the festivities.
Little does he know who the real sacrifice is going to be; the wicker man awaits its perfect victim.
Although this film is terribly 1970s, it is simply grand. it is what a horror movie once was, before everyone started slashing each other at lonely camping grounds in nasty masks. The clash of religion is interesting, because both make some sense.

It is listed as a horror film, when actually it is SO MUCH MORE.  If one classify the genre, I would say Mystery.
It begins with an anonymous letter to the Scottish Constable ( Edward Woodward of Equilizer fame) telling of Summer Isle.  A local girl is missing and none of the villagers seems to show any interest.  Flying to the small Isle, Woodward arrives just before Beltane, the pagan May Day Festivals and the find the Island completely immersed in the Pagan ways of Auld.  Head of the Isle is Lord Summerisle (British horror legend Christopher Lee - Dracula for Hammer Films - in his favourite performance), the leader of his pagan island, and it is clear he not only is aware of the villagers beliefs, he encourages them!
Slowly, Woodward comes to believe the girl is being held for Sacrifice on May Day as he races to save her.
Brilliant performance from Britt Eckland (former Mrs. Peter Sellers and one of the great beauties of her time - * though most of the nude shots are not her since she was pregnant at the time) Hammer horror actress Ingrid Pitt and Diane Cilento (the first Mrs. Sean Connery, mother of Jason) contribute to the eerie feel.
The movie portrays pagan beliefs in an unHollywood style, that goes for substance and facts, rather than sensationalism.  The scenery is beautiful and the music written for the film is haunting.
The film faced many production problems, to being passed through several production companies, a lot of lost footage from the film editor - a devoutly religious man who thought is sinful to be filming this and was systematically destroying as much as he could, and indifferent reediting by Roger Corman, and then nearly dying in bad handly in the theatres.  Was not seen for nearly two decades, and the version in existence was Corman's poorly edited one, missing over 20 minutes of the 101 minute original verson.
I spent years and year trying to track down a copy, and finally for a short time news was good.  The director found that he had an original copy still in his position.  This was released the VHS - first time the 101 version had been seen in nearly two decades!!  Shortly after, it was pulled from the shelves.  Corman's version ( a nice companion piece so it was made of a lot of out takes) came out for a spell.
So I am delighted to see this one on DVD and protected for all time.

This phenomenon certainly had much to do with the fall of the production code in the late 60's, and the rise of young filmmakers such as Cassavettes, Polanski, and Friedkin, as well as Schaeffer.  This film is sort of a macabre variation on ""Lost Horizon"" with the protagonist venturing into a world of seeming tranquility and peace as only the pagans could create.  However, under it all is a dark, sinister force at work, which is made all the more disturbing by the bouyant and frivolous manner in which the community lives.

This is still an incredible film, very much a product of it's time yet able to provoke strong emotions in an audience 30 years after it was made. For the record: The ""Theatrical Version"" disc is minus the entire opening segment and the sequence which introduces Christopher Lee's character early in the film (and contains one of his best lines as he watches two snails copulate). Britt Ekland's famous nude dance is intact, but moved forward in the editing which creates a continuity error in the films narrative. The short ""morning after"" scene between Ekland and Edward Woodward which follows the nude dance is only in this version and not the expanded one. The ""Expanded Version"" returns all the sequences to their proper places and is a much more coherent and understandable print. Even though the ""missing footage"" was culled from other sources, I found very little drop in image or sound quality on the DVD and frankly it is so wonderful to finally be able to see clearly a film I have loved for decades that I really didn't care.

I'd soon realize he'd developed a habit of saying that every time he liked a movie, but in this case I'm tempted to say it myself. The reason is that it's so utterly different that differences of opinion on its impact or likability are nearly irrelevant -- I'd praise it to the skies simply to honor those who had the courage to make something intelligent and thought-provoking. In other words, something that obviously wasn't going to have multitudes lining up to see it. For the DVD, the special-edition wooden box is nice in its way but unnecessary. I've heard complaints from those who found the re-included scenes on the extended version jarring for their obvious contrast with the rest of the film, but while it's possible I like the film too much to criticize any part, I still believe the story is better told with these scenes even if their image quality is unmistakably at variance with the whole. This is why I recommend the special edition, even if most of us have trouble figuring out where to store it.",1009843200,5,1125,4.63
590305,5,6303149200,"Leonard Maltin is correct - this is not a horror film.  In fact, it is very hard to classify; I can best describe it as a one-of-a-kind masterpiece.  Being a huge fan of unique films I love the Wicker Man, it is a superb example of storytelling, with not a line of script wasted, a startling performance by Woodward, and a near un-paralleled sense of dread, particularly towards the end.  Special mention should go to the hypnotic songs - they add to the atmosphere immensely.
Now, on to the disc.  I own the previous version of this DVD and the first disc in the package is that very same disc.  The extended version is what I bought the package for.  The film itself is complete - the extra footage frames the movie wonderfully; it is not just a case of scenes re-inserted, it is edited slightly differently too and the extra scenes make the film seem complete and even better than before.  It is not quite 102 minutes (though it is closer to 100 than 99), but there are a few seconds missing that are contained in the theatrical release, so I don't know whether these were part of the original print (though I'm not sure whether they would fit the slightly different story-line properly).  The main problem is the quality - when the new scenes are taking place the picture quality really is extremely bad, and so blindingly obvious I personally can't help but feel they should have kept the same poor quality all the way through.  That might seem silly but it is such a distraction when the new bits come on, at least if the quality remained the same the film would appear to be in it's original state rather than a tampered version, and you would ignore it eventually.  Still, this is an excellent film that fans should pick up - when it's all said, it still is the best version you can currently get of this magnificent film.",1009584000,7,1830,4.468468468468468
590375,5,6303149200,"This movie which I have seen many times now gets written up every Halloween as being one of the best horror films of all time and it is. This year the New York Times did a piece about it and sang its praises. If you haven't seen it don't read any further and see it before learning about all its secrets. I've been reading here about different versions of the movie and I agree with the person who said it doesn't matter which version you see. I rent it about once a year and even if the copy I get is old and has imperfections its still The Wicker Man. Christopher Lee as Lord Summersisle does what Christopher Lee always does better than any one else, he plays the Christopher Lee part, the kind of part he made famous. Equally memorable is Britt Ekland who is used exactly as Britt Ekland should be used, though it was revealed in the N.Y. Times article that its not really Britts bits we are seeing but a body double. Anyway she is earthy and innocent and beautiful and does a dance in the moonlight and any detective investigating a disappearance on a Scottish isle would fall for her.  The island is gorgeous, the innkeepers daughter is gorgeous, the inn is well stocked, the rooms are quaint, and it just happens to be the time of year on Summersisle when certain traditions are observed. A good time of year to visit.
One of the best moments in the early going is while the detective is making enquiries at the inn and suddenly everyone breaks into song. A strange song he has never heard with strange lyrics that everyone knows, but him. Something is not right on Summersisle. The man to see is of course Lord Summersisle. The finale in the streets of the macabre village and on its gentle slopes overlooking the sea is like so much of this picture, easily recalled.

590376,5,6303149200,"It's not too often I run across a movie that depicts the pre-Christian pagan lifestyle, except it's set in modern times. Often when you watch a movie dealing with paganism, witchcraft, or the occult, it's rather sensationalized depicting a rather inaccurate account of the lifestyle, making pagans to look bad or evil. The Wicker Man depicts a community on an imaginary island in Scotland called Summerisle (which was really filmed on the Scottish mainland, when you look at an atlas, you won't be able to find Summerisle anywhere) in which its inhabitants continue to practice the old Celtic pagan religion including the fire and fertility rites. A Christian police officer by the name of Sgt. Neal Howie was called to Summerisle to search for a missing 12 year old girl (Rowan Morrison). None of the inhabitants want to help the guy since they want to lure him to a wicker man for sacrifice because of their failed harvest the previous summer. In other words, this movie portrays neither Christianity nor Paganism in a favorable light, but it's great to see that the makers of the film put much more than a superficial attempt to portray the pagan lifestyle, even if they end up sacrificing a human in the end (real life pagans, luckily, don't sacrifice living beings, be it humans, or livestock). The music is folk, but often in modernized form, some of the songs are ""Corn Rigs"" (written by Robert Burns), ""Willow's Song"", ""Fire Season"", and one of my favorite, the Maypole Song. Some of it is great, some really cheesy (I think ""Landlord's Daughter is awful, since the people singing it sounded drunk, but it was supposed to since it was set in the inn). I hear how much this movie was butchered, but there isn't much more I can add on that others hadn't said already.

590378,5,6303149200,"Once again, a British film classic is released in America before it is here. Multi-region DVD owners will not be bothered but it is a sad reflection on UK distributors that everyone else has to miss out.
Christopher Lee calls it the ""best film"" he ever made, it has won many an award at film festivals and gained a massive cult following, but The Wicker Man was virtually disowned by the company who made it and sank without trace on its' original release in 1973. This may be because of its' resistance to conform to genre and style but more likely has a lot to do with short sighted money men. Whilst many elements of it are horrific, the film also flirts with notions of suspense, murder mystery and musical along the way.
Sergeant Howie's gradual journey to ""Pagan"" enlightenment and what it ultimately means to him is handled so masterfully by both writer Shaffer and director Hardy that the final revelation is almost as shocking to us as it is to the unfortunate police officer. The film questions those who manipulate religion for there own ends and the very nature of religion itself, and comes to some pretty uncomfortable conclusions. Both his saviour and his downfall, Howie's strict Catholicism is a double-edged sword that cuts little ice on the island of Summerisle. No matter how bizarre the Pagan rituals adhered to there seem to Howie or the viewer, they are based on the same sort of unshakeable methodology inherent in all religion. The ancient civilisations of South America had similar beliefs in terms of sacrifice, and whose to say they were wrong?
As well as being mind-enhancing, the film is incredibly well plotted. Led to believe it is a straightforward thriller that will end happily the viewer becomes as much a fool as Howie when confronted with the foreboding Wicker Man, and everything it has come to represent. The murder sub-plot is exposed as the diversion it was all along and the viewer left with a distinctly nasty taste in his mouth.
Other factors that add to the film's impact are the performances, which are excellent, and the cinematography, which belies the tiny budget.
As for the disc itself, Anchor Bay has gone to a lot of effort to offer both the truncated version and crucially the rare longer cut of the film. Whilst the extra footage in this longer version is of a lesser quality than the rest of the film the scenes are most definitely worth seeing and should not have been taken out in the first place. Apparently, the added scenes were only available from a video print and so, understandably, could not be better restored, but well done to Anchor Bay for at least providing them. When one considers the fact that more footage was (allegedly) buried under a motorway then one should be grateful for small mercies I suppose.
The documentary is solid and should be commended for featuring as many of those involved as possible and the trailers and tv spots are all present and correct.
A commentary would have been nice but there is an added Easter egg which is easy to find on the special features page and although really only watchable once it is hilarious. It is a poor recording of a regional American arts programme featuring an interview with Christopher Lee and Robin Hardy during the film's second release in America. It is presented by a man who cannot go longer than five seconds without saying ""er"" and includes an embarrassing moment in which a very confident Christopher Lee starts singing opera... and can't stop.
To cap it all, the special edition of the DVD comes in a handsome wooden case. For the film alone however, the purchase is must have.",1004918400,,3615,4.7215189873417724

The picture i must say is not that great, actually compared to the Theatrical version it's a bad transfer, but don't let that put you off, this is the version you should defintely have if you have in the past seen the wicker man and enjoyed it. As for the extra features they are a delight, even the hidden easter egg is good. Well the only negative thing to say is that i have read on the net that this is to be remade with Nicolas Cage playing Howie. God forbid this happens even if they spent $100million they cannot make anything better than this, this movie was made from the heart and not for profit. As Christopher Lee says in the documentary this is the best movie he has ever made and he was not paid a single cent for it.

590380,5,6303149200,"THE WICKER MAN is not the type of horror film that relies on mad scientists, gore, maniacs wielding sharp objects, or the supernatural to generate chills.  In fact, up until the climactic scene, it actually reads sort of like a literate and engaging murder mystery.  But, oh, that final unsettling scene-definitely a must-see emotional shocker!
The story centers on Sergeant Howie, an ultraconservative Christian police officer whose every move is seemingly thwarted by tightlipped and xenophobic locals during his investigation of the disappearance of a young girl on a remote Scottish island.  Lord Summerisle, governor of the geographically sequestered community, and his citizenry openly practice an ancient and arcane Celtic fertility religion, and they are more interested in their lewd pagan rituals and bawdy celebratory activities than in assisting the mainland's constabulary with the investigation of a purported crime.  Though quite nonplussed by the ubiquitous nonchalance he faces regarding the missing child, Howie is equally appalled by the public licentious revelry.  He convinces himself that the missing girl has come to some sort of harm as a result of the community's religious depravity, and he is relentless in his efforts to prove it.  However, things are not quite as they seem, and Howie learns too late that he, the hunter, has actually become the hunted.
The acting in THE WICKER MAN is first rate.  Genre actor Christopher Lee, probably best known for his various roles in the horror films of Hammer studios, is over the top as the pagan Lord Summerisle.  Many critics have said its his best role, and he has been quoted as saying it is one of his personal favorites.  Edward Woodward, later to gain fame on TV's THE EQUALIZER, delivers an affecting performance as Sergeant Howie.  He leaves no doubt about the police officer's indignation towards the pagan practices.  And Britt Ekland's performance is the stuff of legend.  Not only is she quite believable as the inn keeper's comely and popular daughter, but her nude scene is highly erotic without being gratuitous and without detracting in the least the from the film's narrative flow.
Fans of the horror genre may feel that this film is thematically reminiscent of that masterpiece of 1960s horror, ROSEMARY'S BABY. True, both films do build their crescendo of chills and horror out of the presuppositions and superstitions of Western Judeo-Christian culture.  In a subtle way, though, THE WICKER MAN is actually more psychologically frightening.  The Satanists in ROSEMARY'S BABY are relatively inconspicuous citizens of New York City who are discreet about their unusual religious activities, and this being the case, it is always implied that there is only so much evil they can get away with without getting caught or being exposed.  In other words, there is a limit to the danger and horrors that the protagonist, Rosemary, will face.  However, there is no such implied limit in THE WICKER MAN.  The protagonist, Sergeant Howie, is the social outsider here, a lone police officer on an isolated island of Celtic pagans, and there is no real legal or social threat to compel the islands inhabitants to assuage their seemingly capricious and Godless folkways.  Furthermore, ancient pagan practices are a great matter of debate in Western Christian culture, so what, if any, danger Sergeant Howie faces is really an unknown.  This creates a chilling atmosphere that, right up until the unnerving climactic scene, keeps the audience feeling much more apprehensive and uneasy than at any time in ROSEMARY'S BABY.
The two-disc limited-edition set recently released by Anchor Bay contains two versions of this movie, one the U.S. theatrical release and the other an extended version.  (The theatrical version can be purchased separately, but the extended version is only available in this limited-edition set.)  Anchor Bay reports that the extended version, though still purportedly missing two minutes of the original film, is as close to reflecting the intent of the original filmmakers as can be achieved with currently known and available material.  (Some of this material is apparently tape rather than film, so there are a few short spots in the extended version where there is a noticeable shift in quality.)  This is easy to believe, as the extended version of the film is not only longer, it is also cut and edited in a different manner and, consequently, offers a much more logical narrative flow.  The theatrical release is still a fine movie-it also has a stereo soundtrack, which the extended does not-and adequately delivers the central gist of the narrative, but since the extended version is artistically and narratively superior, it is well worth the additional cost to purchase the two-disc set.",1003017600,,4796,5.190661478599222
590381,4,6303149200,"I bought The Wicker Man DVD the other day and watched it for the first time. I had no idea what this movie was about. I'd only heard of the title as that of an Iron Maiden song (from their most recent CD Brave New World).
I knew Christopher Lee from watching many late-night horror movies. I knew Edward Woodward from various movies and TV shows. And the reviewer blurbs made the movie sound like a ""Must-See.""
So I saw it.
Wow, is this movie odd. But it's extremely captivating and engrossing. I agree with a previous reviewer: it's like watching Green Acres. Totally mind-bending and strange, with the only sane character the lead role.
I also agree with previous reviewers in that I don't classify this as a horror movie. It's an excellent movie about Christianity (the Edward Woodward character) vs. Paganism (lead by Christopher Lee's character). This is also, on another level, a very good representation of what would happen if the world lost its Judeo-Christian heritage and reverted to some sort of Paganism. For that reason, alone, I was scared out of my wits.
The Edward Woodward character remains faithful to his Christian beliefs right through to the end (which is chilling). For that, I want to thank the screenwriter and director. It was nice to see a Christian not fall apart and act goofy when push comes to shove.
The behind-the-scenes (""making of"") bonus material is wonderful to watch. Both Christopher Lee and Edward Woodward appear on screen to give their recollections of the movie, as does the director and screenwriter. I love behind-the-scenes stories, and this one really shows how much everyone believed in the movie (they were filming in November and December, freezing their butts off!).
I recommend this odd, quirky movie. Not only to watch superb performances (especially by Woodward) and interesting scenery, but also to see what would happen if Paganism/Satanism were to have free reign in the world. That, alone, is worth the price of admission!",1002585600,3,1980,4.913432835820895
590382,4,6303149200,"THE WICKER MAN

(UK - 1973)

Aspect ratio: 1.85:1
Theatrical soundtrack: Mono

First-time director Robin Hardy and acclaimed writer Anthony Shaffer (twin brother of Peter, and author of FRENZY and SLEUTH [both 1972], the latter based on his stageplay) attempted to revise the horror genre with this cult favorite concerning a deeply religious police sergeant (Edward Woodward, in a note-perfect performance) whose search for an apparently missing schoolgirl on a remote Scottish island exposes a Pagan society rooted in old superstitions and the worship of vengeful gods. To the accompaniment of a haunting score by Paul Giovanni, comprising variations on traditional songs and folk music, THE WICKER MAN depicts an isolated community at odds with the world at large, steeped in ancient beliefs and ruled with deceptive benevolence by a patriarchal figure (Christopher Lee, in unusually subtle form) whom the script suggests is a monstrous con man, maintaining the island's customs not through genuine convictions, but because the islanders - all of them true disciples of the cause - simply know no other way.

The central mystery (Woodward's search for the missing girl) is genuinely engrossing, and the bawdy songs which greet the sergeant's arrival are soon replaced by an earthy sensuality as the true extent of the islanders' belief in regenerative powers - divorced from traditional notions of 'morality' - become apparent. Lee's assessment of God verges on blasphemy (""He had His chance and... blew it!""), but ultimately, neither Christianity or Paganism emerges with any dignity from the devastating finale. There's real magic in every  frame of this extraordinary film, though it's clearly not for everyone: If you don't 'get it' within the first ten minutes, then the careful pace and deliberate absence of familiar horror motifs may seem a little long-winded, even dull. Everyone else, however, will be enchanted by this unique, one-of-a-kind movie.

The filmmakers themselves have roundly condemned the shorter 'theatrical version' (88 minutes) which crept into UK theaters in 1973 as support for Nicolas Roeg's DON'T LOOK NOW. However, most viewers were first introduced to TWM via the shorter print, simply because it was the only available version for many years, and despite the makers' protestations to the contrary, it's still a remarkable experience.

The filmmakers' preferred print (100m) underlines the script's major themes and streamlines the narrative, and will be a revelation to anyone who's only ever seen the theatrical print or the 95m version unearthed by the BBC. There are a few bits and pieces in the theatrical version which are exclusive to that print, and the BBC edition includes an animated 'Sun God' which appears after the closing credits, filling the screen before shooting backwards into darkness.

I found WM to be an underwhelming film experience primarily due to Robin Hardy's very uneven direction. In the documentary available on the DVD, mention is made that Nicholas Roeg's Don't Look Now was also in production by WM's backers (British Lion)around the same time. I certainly think Roeg could have pushed the basic elements of WM further - Summerisle's isolation, the sexual uber-text, the tension between the repressed policeman and the liberated Lord Summerisle and his subjects, the underused locations, etc. I have admired and enjoyed Anthony Schaeffer's other screenwork, but found it hard to believe he labored on the WM to create the ultimate British horror film. While there is much to discuss about the film as a case-study in studio interference and for the presence of such cult film stalwarts as Christopher Lee, Diane Cilento and Ingrid Pitt, I am still mystified by the lofty status of this particular film.

On one disc is the infamous theatrical release short version with a stated runtime of 88 minutes (this version had a runtime of 87 minutes, according to most sources) and the other disc has the extended version with a stated runtime of 99 minutes. This longer version has the mainland prelude scenes and the Christopher Lee monologue in his offering to Aphrodite, which accounts for the ""rarely seem"" 11 minutes. A lot of confusion about the length of the uncut longer version seems to exist! I've seen runtimes given as ""105 minutes"", ""104"", ""103"" and ""101""! Actually, according to the film editor himself, Eric Boyd-Perkins, it was cut down to a finished release version of 102 minutes. But this version was never released. And this is the version that was further cut down (on the advice of Roger Corman, no less!) to the 87/88 minute theatrical release version. It was also re-cut later for the BBC to a 95 minute version. Just out of curiosity, I timed the long version on this DVD and it is 99 minutes. I also timed the one I recorded 15 years ago off the old Z Channel and it, too, is 99 minutes. I can't time my Media VHS version because I don't have it anymore. It had a stated runtime of 102 minutes, but since I never noticed any difference between it and the Z Channel copy, it may have been 99 minutes, too! Maybe there never was an actual 102 minute version released anywhere! Not that it matters. The filmmakers themselves had to cut out about 20 minutes of filmed scenes to get down to that 102 minute release version! These missing scenes will never be seen again by anybody! They are lost and gone forever, probably buried under a highway in Britain! So why quibble over a missing 3 minutes? Get over it! There's a wealth of information about The Wicker Man on the Internet. Just do a Yahoo! search and you'll find dozes of interesting sites, including one with transcripts of those missing 20 minutes! By reading them, you'll better understand some of the events in the movie more clearly. Like why some characters/actors are listed in the end credits but are not in the movie -- because their scenes were cut! And like why graves on Summerisle are 9 feet deep! And what the Hand of Glory is! Check it out! But back to this DVD set. In defense of the much-maligned short version, it has one thing going for it -- it has a scene that is not in any of the longer versions that I've seen! It takes place the morning after Willow's erotic dance and gives further insight into Howie's character, as he states that he doesn't believe in sex before marriage, and Willow gently mocks him for it. This is an important scene and should have been in the extended version as well! (This scene is about 2 minutes long. Could it have been in the 1973 102 minute version, and subsequently cut, accounting for the confusion about the ""uncut"" length?) There are some other differences as well, such as credits backgrounds and some scene juxtaposition, but they're minor. This short version is in Dolby Digital 5.1 and it sounds great! The image quality is very good. The extended version is in mono and the image quality varies from fair to good, but this is explained in a brief forward to the movie -- in effect, they did the best they could with what they had! Bonus material includes the theatrical trailer and TV spots, and a lot of radio spots. But there's no language selection and no subtitles option. Chapter selections for each version, of course. And cast & crew bios -- but only for Lee, Woodward, Hardy, and Shaffer. The most interesting feature is the short documentary that has the ubiquitous Lee, the still-lovely Pitt, star Woodward, director Hardy, and many others talking about the film. The documentary ends with a poignant shot of that highway, under which the lost footage may be buried! Well, let's be thankful that we have as much as we have of this true cult classic! So is this DVD set worth the money? I say yes. I'm happy with it. I think you will be, too.",998784000,28,4416,4.548994974874372

The beginning is choppy and the ""Play"" display is clearly visible at the beginning of the tape). According to the docmentary, all known negatives, positives, and outtakes of this movie were destroyed. What survives is the theatre distribution master and a sole copy of the ""director's"" version that was submitted to the studio and rejected. The ""extended"" version is a composite of the two films. There is nothing left to work with. The ""theatrical"" version is nice and clear and the sound is wonderfully restored. Nice on a 5.1 surround system. OK, the ""fake letterbox"" format is a bit of a drag, but it did not stop me from enjoying the film. The ""extended"" version is in two channel mono.

That story just adds to the appeal of this longer version.
I had heard nothing of the ending when I first saw The Wicker Man and refuse to reveal it here, but the film is, in fact, a horror film in that the ending is ""horrible"" and, for me, unexpected.  (So I was bothered that the recent releases of the film on tape spoiled the ending with a revealing cover photo.)
The Wicker Man is not a perfect film, on one level, the production values being typical of the period, but it does force one to examine assumed values and beliefs like few other films of any period.

Neil Howie investigates the reported disappearance of a young girl on the remote Scottish island of Summerisle.  There he encounters odd characters and events that taunt and frustrate his every effort to uncover the truth behind the strange culture of the islanders, until, at the end, he finally discovers the secret of Summerisle and meets the wicker man, and his fate.
The Wicker Man was called ""the Citizen Kane of horror films"" by the genre magazine Cinefantastique in its Winter 1977 issue, which was almost entirely devoted to the making of the movie.  I wouldn't go quite that far, but it is an engrossing film, worthy of many viewings.  I'd never heard of it until I read about it in the magazine, but when I bought my first VCR in 1982 and started collecting movies, it was one of the first movies I bought, right along with Alien, King Kong, and Star Wars.  Heady company, indeed!  And thanks to Cinefantastique I knew enough to get the uncut 102 minute version from Media Home Entertainment.  I was not disappointed!

590532,4,6303149200,"I saw this film because I have recently become a big fan of British horror film actor Christopher Lee.  He is the last surviving great horror film actor and one of the last of the great movie villains.  Unfortunately, Lee has rarely gotten roles that do real justice to his great talent.  ""The Wicker Man"" is an exception.
A Scottish Christian fundamentalist police officer(Edward Woodward of TV's ""The Equalizer"") receives an anonymous letter reporting a missing child on a nearby pagan-inhabited island.  Woodward travels to the island, which is governed by pagan lord Christopher Lee.  Woodward's religious beliefs harshly clash with the views of the pagan inhabitants as he searches for the missing child.  The film climaxes in what is arguably the greatest twist-ending in film history.
""The Wicker Man"" is the archetype of a great renaissance film.  The film successfully combines several different genres, including the Horror film, Detective story, Mystery movie, Drama, Satire, and Musical.  There is no other movie like it.
Christopher Lee gives the greatest performance of his career.  He was fifty years old when he made this movie but he looks several years younger.  Lee has said that ""The Wicker Man"" offered him his favorite role and I believe him.  He is absolutely charismatic as the suave and ruthless Lord Summerisle.  Lee is far more effective in this film than he was in any of his Dracula movies.
Not only Lee but also screenwriter Anthony Shaffer should have been nominated for Oscars.  The film has the most creative dialogue that I have ever seen in a movie.
I have already seen this movie seven times and could stand to see it seven times more.  Well-recommended.",994204800,,1690,4.989285714285714

Check yourself - if you don't know IN ADVANCE what the Easter Bunny is really all about, don't waste your time with Wicker Man; it's going to go right past you.  If you can't imagine watching ANY movie five or six times, don't waste your time watching this once; it's like giving yourself a two-day weekend to visit Tokyo.  And if you're not comfortable with a movie unless you've got it slotted by genre, the characters sorted by stereotype, and the two or three possible endings figured out by the end of the first reel, you're going to be much, much happier watching ""Swordfish.""
But for the grown-ups, this is an absolute treasure.  If you've read The Golden Bough, Heart of Darkness, or Anthony Burgess, you get ALL the jokes in Wicker Man, Apocalypse Now, and Clockwork Orange, where the kiddies are seeing only Willow work the wall, lots of explosions, and a couple of violent rapes.

[DEFINITE SPOILER] I've seen and heard comments from some Christians who're deeply disturbed by Wicker Man.  Look again, folks, and keep your eyes fixed on Edward Woodward.

When was the last time you saw a Christian character made a martyr precisely BECAUSE he was acting to the highest standards of duty, honor, and morality?",992649600,4,1799,4.752411575562701
590534,5,6303149200,"Think of all the shock twist endings of today's flicks like Sixth Sense and Unbreakable. These endings are merely the weak, mild-mannerd children of the robust father of all twist endings: 1973's The Wicker Man, written by Anthony Shaffer (Frenzy, Sleuth).
But The Wicker Man is so much more than its twist ending. This movie dares to explore the nature of religion, of the provocative uncontrolable power of mass hysteria, and the impotence of an individual when challenging a mob.
This film, for me, sparked deep thought not only into the concept of religious differences, but into all areas of mass hysteria, be it African Americans being lynched decades ago by white mobs in the deep South, the Holocast, or the mass hysteria of the Salem Witchcraft Trials or Spanish Inquisition.
But, aside from the deep complex messaging, the movie is also entertaining, and has a wonderfully infectous and authentic folk soundtrack. And the overall atmosphere and mood of this picture is something you won't forget for years to come!
This movie, which failed at the box office but over time became a cult favorite, is arguably one of the most important films ever made, especially for those brave enough to examine its horrifying underlying message of religious intolerance and the frailty of individual liberty when in the face of mass hysteria.",992304000,,1337,5.027027027027027

The rituals and songs of the islanders were easily the most convincing examples of otherworldly practices I have ever seen in a fantasy film (no Maria Ouspenskaya gypsies here!). I was particularly impressed by the way that the screenwriter, Anthony Shaffer, refused to make Sergeant Howie ""lovable"", but, rather, allowed him to be as humorless and dogmatic as a real Scottish Presbyterian would be if confronted with this horrible situation. At the same time, his courage and sense of duty make him a real hero -- and Woodward, a splendid actor, conveys all of this human complexity to perfection.

590539,5,6303149200,"I find few oversights as shameful to the entertainment Biz as the fact that films like this are not easily obtainable to the general public.  The Wicker Man is wonderfully representative of a somewhat lost Genre of creepy 70's art house flicks.  A strong foreign influence on Brit & Auzzie directors of the time and all of the mind expanding drug experimentation of the 60's finally started paying off.  Films such as The Wicker Man and Don't Look Now, and to a lessor degree, films of the continent like More and The Valley are indeed a forgotten artform. A film of the ""Lost Genre"" typically will be shot on that very distinctive 70's film stock.  It apparently looked marvelous at the time, but cost cuts in it's composition that were to save the industry ended up in a film stock that degraded in a mere five or six years.  What we're left with however unintentional at the time are beautifully creapy washed out colors blending at the edges into each other and night scenes as grainy as a gravel road. An irreverent view towards sex, a hint of otherworldly spiritual implications, and an ending you'd never guess are all featured key themes in these films.  If you are a modern day film afficionado and you appreciate the works of Lars Von Trier, Danny Boyle, and David Lynch, I strongly suggest you investigate the Wicker Man and other such films of the era.  Sadly, you will find it quite difficult to snag them in most U.S. video stores.  Some are still not ""legal"" in the U.S..  The Wicker Man may be hard to find, but it has not been banned and it is well worth the extra investigative effort.  Also see the early films of Nick Roeg (Don't Look Now, The Performance and Walkabout ) and of famed diredctor Peter Weir (Picnic at Hanging Rock and the Last Wave)  All are brilliantly creepy and I feel that all are members of the secret lost genre.",970358400,7,1854,4.520958083832335
590600,5,6303149200,"Before beginning this review, I thought it worth commenting on the previous reviews.
As is typical of modern-day liberal-socialist  'pagans', they feel compelled to flirt with the glamour of witchcraft  (itself a 20th century invention) and historical paganism (often  interpreted by christian scholars), whilst distancing themselves from the  darker aspects of the same. For example, ""this is possibly the most  accurate portrayal of the Craft ever put to celluloid .  .  . aside, of  course, from the last ten minutes"" or ""I feel that to some people  this may give rise to ignorant prejudices against 'alternative' religions,  especially Wiccans and other pagan groupings"". And of course the  little darling who saw fit to bleat about the ""Witch Burnings""  whilst review a film which had nothing to do with witch-burnings. It should  be obvious to anyone that human sacrifice was and is a part of genuine  heathen practices, from the various Celtic peoples, to the Teutonic  peoples, through to Minoan society, and to Aryan India. Need I mention the  bog people? The practice itself is continued in modern day times: The  Clapham Woods 'Friends of Hekate' phenomenon in the late 1970s, and the  Shropshire Order of Nine Angles in the mid-1990s. Of course, modern pagans  would distance themselves from such practices because it destroys their  good-guy image . . . thus, they are little more than New Agers - The  'Melting Pot' pagans - thus failing to understand that heathenism was - and  is - a complete Weltanschauung, and instead inthralled with  abstractions.
I have gone into this at rather torturous length because it  is necessary to appreciate this film at its deepest level. I feel that  ""Wicker Man"" is, in a small way, one such aspect of the 'Second  Coming of Wotan'  predicted by Carl Jung in his brilliant essay  ""Wotan"". This implies a deeper understanding of our Origin and  Future, and the re-integration of the Folk's collective Shadow-Self. Jung  wrote this essay in response to the rise of National-Socialism, expounding  this in often religious terms. He saw the Hitler Youth solstice rituals and  the Volkisch Movements as being evidence for a nation possessed -  poetically - by Wotan, the great Norse God. I would recommend that every  one have a read of this essay.
I have yet to see such a startling and  vivid portrayal of Heathenism in any medium. Everything, from the  landscapes to the music, was sublime, interwoven with an immanent surreal  and threatening atmosphere. The final scene was one of the most disturbing  film sequences I have ever seen, and has haunted me ever since.
Much has  been said of the Jungian aspects of the film (the all consuming force of  the policeman's anim - Willow - and its potential to save him from his  eventual sacrifice) and the raw, eroticism of the film (Willow dancing  naked around the adjoining room singing, ""say 'How Do'/To the things  I'll say to you/ A stroke as gentle as a feather./Hey Ho..I am here./ Am I  not young and fair?/ Please come, say 'How Do'/ To the things I'll show to  you.) The recurring motifs of cycles (The Maypole Song) and regenerative  powers (the classroom scenes where the children discuss the phallic nature  of the maypole) are worth noting, as is the symbol of Man's empathy with  Nature in the Green Man (c.f. The Green Man/Knight in the legends of King  Arthur, and some of the poems of Seamus Heaney, as well as the old  ""Blood and Soil"" slogan) in opposition to modern-day  abstractions.
However, the part of the film where I thought it lost its  way was with the garbled mythology of Ouarda, The Fool, the six swords, and  the various offerings prior to the sacrifice. Also, the dubbing of Britt  Ekland's performance is jarring at first, but Edward Woodward's powerful  performance more than makes up for this.
All in all, this is definitely  a film worth watching. It may involve some effort to track it down, but you  won't regret it.",965692800,,3952,4.867469879518072
590601,4,6303149200,"Luckily, I found a barely-used copy of the 101 minute version for five bucks when a video store went out of business. I enjoyed the idea of the movie so much I had a librarian track down the novel (a must read if you  like the flick).
That said, let's be honest with ourselves here: the film  itself does look ameturishly made, and I don't see where all of the blame  can be placed on the mindless re-editing done by those who didn't actually  make the film (find a copy of CINEFANTASTIQUE, Vol. 6, #3, for the story).  The actors give their all to the script, which Christopher Lee called the  best one he'd ever read (not saying much, judging by most of Hammer's  output...but I like and respect Mr. Lee VERY much).  But even the longest  existing version remains distractingly flawed; no matter what version you  see, the accusations of inept execution are well-deserved (how else do you  explain the cameraman's foot? Don't play dumb--YOU KNOW which scene I'm  talking about! NO WAY post-release editing caused THAT!)
But hey, if  you're willing to overlook all that, the movie is as thought-provoking as  they come.
One last, minor point--over the years I've found pagans of all  stripes who rally around this movie despite Lord Summerisle's admission  that the island's entire pagan culture--despite his own devotion to and  defense of it--is a SHAM invented by his grandfather for sheerly commercial  purposes. Not jerkin' any chains...just wanted to point that out.
So  Wicker Man ain't the best movie one might watch (what is?). But it's worth  seeing at least once...and I'm a fundamentalist Christian well to the right  of Sgt. Howie! Hey, put those torches down, y'all...",963792000,5,1683,4.8350877192982455
590602,4,6303149200,"A classic thriller from a time when paganism and pastoral folk music were both relatively trendy in the UK (both Jethro Tull and Steeleye Span were big at this time), this is one of a handful of decent, low-budget  independent British films. Furthermore, it has very little to do with the  increasingly-camp series of Hammer Horror movies - it isn't even 'horror',  really. It's a strange and unsettling semi-horror, semi-thriller,  semi-pagan movie that was shamefully cut to shreds before release (with the  original film cans being dumped in a ditch opposite the M1), and is long  overdue for some kind of video release. The plot concerns a investigating  into the disappearance of a young girl on a remote Scottish island,  although that is quickly forgotten as our hero, policeman Edward Woodward,  discovers that the island has rejected conventional Christianity for  paganism. From then on it's strange and jarring, as our hero first attempts  to solve the mystery and then escape and get help. Almost a British version  of the standard Hollywood 'You ain't from around these parts' redneck  horrors of the seventies (such as 'The Hills Have Eyes' and 'Deliverance'),  it builds up to an unforgettable, extraordinary ending which I wasn't  expecting the first time I saw the film. Apart from Woodward, the cast is  very 'mid-70's British low-budget horror' - Christopher Lee is resplendent  with enormous hair, and Britt Ekland allows her body double to appear nude  (from the back). Legend had it that Rod Stewart, her then-boyfriend, tried  to have the film withdrawn from release, but like so many legends this was  completely untrue.",962236800,10,1644,5.109022556390977
590603,5,6303149200,"This is surely one of the most interesting films to come out of Great Britain. It is very difficult to describe the plot without taking away something of the central interest. Suffice it to say that it is a most  original idea, and one that will appeal to people who are interested in  spirituality, as well as those with an eye for history. The film raises  more questions than it probably answers, but that is, in my opinion, the  point of good cinema. In so doing, it tackles a very difficult subject,  that of religion, and does so in a most original way.
Edward Woodward is  a very fine actor and part of the effect of the film must be credited to  his sterling performance as the police officer who has sufficient  imagination at the end, to fall into the trap which is set. The film also  deals with what I would call the question of destiny: the final act is  somehow predestined and all that has gone before is but a necessary prelude  to it. In a sense, the story unfolds in a pantomime-like manner, with the  music helping us to understand each scene in its own way. The musical score  lends itself very well to creating the atmosphere, which is at once  old-fashioned and eccentric.
Beyond the immediacy of the action itself,  there is the added bonus of the setting, an island off the coast of  Scotland (I'm not sure which one it is, although I think I once heard it  was Fair Isle). So the scenery is at times very lovely, and the cultural  setting is of interest in itself, as long as one can understand the accents  of all the characters assembled at the pub. All in all, this is one of my  favourite films and I highly recommend it.",956880000,6,1650,4.365131578947368
590604,5,6303149200,"The Wicker Man is a chilling horror film to many individuals who's view of religion is somewhat limited. To myself and my fellow pagans around my stomping grounds, this is possibly the most accurate portrayal of the Craft  ever put to celluloid (aside, of course, from the last ten minutes...which  in itself is anciently historically accurate, i.e. the ancient Druids.) It  is a funny movie as well, to those who know how to view it right. I can't  imagine any honest to goodness pagan having a problem with The Wicker  Man...After all, a pagan without a sense of humor isn't much of a pagan. I  thoroughly enjoyed this movie and I hope that if and when it becomes  available through Amazon that you leap at the opportunity to buy it. And as  has been mentioned in the reviews, it shrewdly forces you to think about  where exactly you get your own morality, and if morality is indeed  universal. It's fun, with some good music and some good points. The ending  might be off when you look at modern paganism, but up until then, it is  dead on.",953337600,6,1043,4.518716577540107
590605,5,6303149200,This is simply a classic movie. The end of the movie is chilling and brilliant. Not for the mainstream moviegoer but those that like something different.,951696000,,153,4.923076923076923
590606,4,6303149200,"This is a rather unusual film, set in the eerie, yet beautiful midsts of a remote Scottish island. The storyline is captivating and the ending is somewhat shocking although not unexpected. I feel that to some people this  may give rise to ignorant prejudices against 'alternative' religions,  especially Wiccans and other pagan groupings, but however horrific and  seemingly unjust the ending is, the story is based on the fact that in  ancient times many cultures did employ a human sacrifice to appease the  gods and they believed that it worked. The basic question that the film is  asking is; ""Is morality a Judeo-Christian invention, or does it exist  above and beyond religion?"". Overall a well made film that makes you  think. And the folky, melancholic music is wonderful.",948585600,3,780,5.0390625

590608,5,6303149200,"The first time I couldn't turn out the lights after watching a horror movie was when I saw ""Psycho"" for the first time in Aunt Val's flat in London - slept in the day room with all the lights on. This film  was the second time, and I wasn't interested at all at first. It's the  final sequence that gets you - it's not at all your typical terror tale,  with maniacs running around with axes or strange creatures from beyond the  grave/the Black Lagoon/the director's last hangover or whatever the latest  craze is. This movie sneaks up on you, posing as a simple little suspense  tale about a policeman doggedly doing his duty, aware but oblivious to the  stark, raving weirdness that surrounds him. But that's how it sucks you in,  playing on our tendency toward ""yes it's strange, but it won't hurt  you"" when it comes to anything other worldly. Agatha Christie once  said the scariest monsters were the little old grannies with their poisoned  knitting needles - this movie will not only make you believe that, it will  have you wondering, even just a little, about just how charming some of  your friends' idosyncrasies really are. I dare you to watch it all the way  through the end.",942364800,2,1188,4.568720379146919
590639,5,6303149200,"Just one of the best movies ever made...and it gets better with repeat viewing, as great movies do.  This is one of the most beloved films in the Pagan community but all sentient beings can enjoy it: gorgeous to look at,  strangely fetching tunes (the first Pagan musical!?), amazing dialogue and  an ending you may find deeply disturbing no matter what your faith or your  sympathies...so what's not to love?  ;-) It makes you think, too, and  that's never a bad thing.  So settle in Gently, Johnny...enjoy the ride.",940291200,3,517,4.741573033707865
590640,5,6303149200,"Not really a horror film, although that is where you will find it listed in any video stores that carry it.  The highly edited version does not make sense but if you can find the long version (about 103-111 minutes) it is  well worth the search.  The dialogs between Woodward and Lee are great.",940032000,4,294,4.407407407407407
590641,5,6303149200,"This is without doubt a superb piece of filmaking that sees my favourite actor the great Christopher Lee in one of his best roles and his favourite role as the pagan Lord Summerisle. Edward Woodward is superb as the upright Christian copper sent to the remote Scottish island of Summerisle to investigate the strange dissapearance of a young girl!! A task not helped by the fact that most of the islanders refuse to admit she even excisted including the girls own mother. Woodward plays Sergeant Neil Howie who soon discovers an island rife with pagan rituals and sacrifice instigated by Lee as the Lord of the island. But as mayday arrives Howie finds himself stranded on the island and the terrible truth becomes apparent as he discovers he is their sacrifice. He is then burned alive in a huge ""wicker man"" as Lord summerisle and the islanders dance and sing below. This is a cult classic with songs and rhymes by Paul Giovanni that are very seventies in sound but you cant help but like them! Britt ekland and Ingrid Pitt provide the nudity! This is a unique film in every way. Nothing like this has ever been made since if you like your horror films different then this is for you.",937180800,,1186,4.599056603773585

However, after finding a web site that described the 107 min version, I was upset.  The 84 min. version is fine,  though doesn't make much sense...the 107 min. version clears things up.  All in all, a good movie.",935884800,,315,4.672727272727273
590643,5,6303149200,"The movie does a good job highlighting the different philosophies behind the ""Old ways"" (paganism) and Christianity.  The movie also turns the mirror on Christianity a faith that has burned more than one 'witch'.  ""Wicker Man"" can be disturbing to those who may not understand  Paganism and fundamentalists. The full length version is the way to go.  If  you can find it.  This movie needs to be made more available to the  public!!!!!!!!",928281600,,438,4.917808219178082
