685965,4,6303544509,"Joseph Gordon-Levitt has become a major name in Hollywood since his initial film about Angels in a Baseball Game. Something similar to
""Angels in the Outfield"". He has a persona which manifests itself on screen.  One wants to watch him and follow his adventure whatever
it is.  It has followed him into adulthood. In this movie, whether reacting to a dislike, which he quickly recovers from, or initiating an
action which others follow, he dominates the screen. In this film some of the script is contrived, but Gordon-Levitt is not cheapened,
he still manifests his later promise as a terrific actor.  He makes the scene and script his own.  The story should resonate with those
concerned about poaching elephants just for ivory and capturing them just for zoo attendance.  The two boys interact well. Good family
film.",1421712000,,820,4.956204379562044

While not as good as Remington Steele, it at least doesn't have a negative story line as some of her other films and does have some closeups and interesting shots of her.",1194739200,2,294,4.25
685970,1,6303544509,"Strong visual values mark this film, and the camera's capture of that splendrous quality of light distinctive to sub-Saharan Africa nearly gives one the perception of a travelogue for Kenya at its most captivating; however, an unfortunate inclusion of a weak storyline drops the work to a juvenile level appropriate to its targeted audience.  The opening scene shows poachers dispatching an elephant cow and an unsuccessful attempt to seize her calf (that becomes a featured performer here), and during the next scene an American divorcee, Beverly (Stephanie Zimbalist) and her pre-teen son deplane, prepared to vacation at a ranch managed by a reformed hunter, Clive Potter (Julian Sands) who has founded an animal orphanage upon his land.  The boy promptly makes a friend with a local youngster of about the same age, and the two become involved in an endeavour to regain the mentioned elephant orphan, ""Ellie"", from her new owner, Etheridge, an American whose acquisition of the beast for his plantation in Florida will fiscally support Clive's animal sanctuary for a year and more.  The film then focusses upon an attempt by Etheridge to retrieve his pachyderm from the two boys, and the escape of the title ensues, with the animal's new master being assisted by the same poachers who killed Ellie's parent, all this while Clive and Beverly become enamoured of each other, and participants romp through an encampment of bemused Masai and evade various aggressive fauna, including a lion, elephants and hyenas.  Obviously not produced with artistic aspirations, this movie is nonetheless handicapped with its continually predictable script and often inane dialogue, leaving only sublime scenery to support one's interest, and there is too little footage of Kenya's animal kingdom, other than the baby elephant.  Sands, a resourceful actor, has little to do, merely walking through what must be a pleasant payday while Zimbalist is decorative, and composed.  The two youngsters do a bit of ad libbing, but not enough to rescue this tepid piece.",1101600000,,2046,5.222560975609756

7850934,5,6303544509,"I have professional friends, who were civil service employees for the U.S.A. in Nairobi, Kenya, who recommended this DVD to me and others as a family movie to give a viewer a good introduction to daily life and the nation's problems in Africa.  Families who are employed in Kenya, often send
their children to Boarding Schools in Nairobi and elsewhere.  I was not disappointed when the acting genius of young Joseph Gordon-Levitt with a black youngster called Juomo brought to life the problems of youth, life in the bush, the dangers of wild life, especially lions and poisonous snakes and the poaching of animals that cause the need for wild life orphanages.  Joseph Gordon-Levitt is young Matt with his Mother who travel to Kenya for a safari, and hopefully to see his Father.  His Father is excessively absent from Matt's life.  So Matt with a black peer named Juomo focused their attention on an orphaned Elephant named Ellie who faced captivity.  The boys set the elephant Ellie free go to the wild bush country and wilds of Africa to find a herd of elephants that would adopt the baby animal.  There is a lot of adventure when the Boys with Ellie are confronted by Hyenas, Lions and dangers.  The boys and Ellie find themselves put in jail, but escape and the Adventures continue.  This is an excellent family movie with a lot of education about life in Africa.  Joseph Gordon-Levitt has the unique Genius as a actor with a supporting cast to bring to life
the realities faced by a boy in a particular time and place.  In his youth Joseph has taken other social issues, and acted them out in movies to give
concerns for humanity a positive direction.  Here is another family movie masterpiece by Joseph Gordon-Levitt that is worthy of viewing.",1436400000,2,1750,4.720394736842105
