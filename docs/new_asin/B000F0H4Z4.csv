8116013,5,B000F0H4Z4,"This is a great video. It explains what you are dealing with and that these are great kids, but just do things differently. Goes with the ""Student like me"" video. A must have!",1199923200,3,175,4.333333333333333
8116014,5,B000F0H4Z4,"This DVD is very educational and is different than reading about FAS, because you feel ""close"" to the families who participated in the DVD by watching their interactions; many useful tips.",1168473600,3,188,5.096774193548387
8116015,5,B000F0H4Z4,"I found this to be a useful, sensitive and thorough walk through a challenging topic.",1145836800,,85,4.733333333333333
8116016,5,B000F0H4Z4,This is one of two video's in a series about children with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome. This video is very useful to parents and caregivers of individuals with FAS/FASD and who are also in need of some good basic information and education about the issues they face. It also lets parents and caregivers know that there are other parents and caregivers who are going through the same experiences. This video is given to the parents and caregivers of children with FAS/FASD that are evaluated by our clinic. Definitely recommended!,1145318400,5,524,4.965909090909091

8116018,5,B000F0H4Z4,"This video is amazing - especially for foster and adoptive parents whose children must deal with the effects of exposure to alcohol in utero.  It actually has practical ""how-to"" ideas and demonstratons of strategies that help when kids feel sensory overload, or when they are impulsive.  There's lots of stuf written about the causes and consequences of FAS but this is the first educational tool I've found that helps with the day to day in a REAL way.",1144713600,8,453,4.794871794871795
