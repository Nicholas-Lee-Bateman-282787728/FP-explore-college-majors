8706630,2,B00UGQNVHW,"Lawyer Slater defends Alcatraz prisoner Bacon who tried to escape and was held in solitary and tortured for so long the prison system essentially turned him into a murderer when he subsequently killed a fellow inmate in the cafeteria. This film is based on fact and makes its point about prison abuse. Bacon turns in an admirable performance. The film, however, is one long cliche. Weak acting at times, improbable scenes, uncomfortable scenes, weak script. Its one of those films during which I kept asking myself, Should I bail on this one? Watched it, but Im not a fan.",1495152000,,572,4.787878787878788
