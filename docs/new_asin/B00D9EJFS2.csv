5784217,5,B00D9EJFS2,"As a woman of color, I was always told I had ""good hair,"" ""exotic"" or some other description on a color spectrum.  I have always had a distaste for it.  Why wasn't beautiful enough. The history of colorism among American Blacks and around the world is saddening.  It is often promoted and accepted.  I stepped away from it years ago.  The opinions are raw and candid, discussing what has rarely come to the forefront in documentaries.

5784219,5,B00D9EJFS2,"Dark Girls was amazing.

I loved the fact that the movie provided an open forum for black women of all shades to open up about any pain they've felt about the treatment received over their skin color.

Even the guys who gave their honest opinions throughout the documentary were interesting, because usually you don't hear them opening up like that for fear of being shouted down.

I look forward to part two, the Yellow Brick Road movie:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Skin-Bleaching-My-Skin-Lightening-With-Hydroquinone-Whitening-Fade-Cream-How-Why-I-Tried-to-Lighten-My-Skin-Using-Safer-Natural-Products-After-Dark-Girls-Documentary-Pre-Yellow-Brick-Road-Movie/dp/B00E7XAVZK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Skin Bleaching: My Skin Lightening With Hydroquinone Whitening Fade Cream - How & Why I Tried to Lighten My Skin Using Safer Natural Products After Dark Girls Documentary, Pre-Yellow Brick Road Movie</a>",1376265600,5,952,7.558558558558558

5784233,5,B00D9EJFS2,"Having been raised in predominantly ""White"" communities, I too was a young girl who would grow up not liking the color of my skin.  I never saw it as being beautiful and exquisite, and it took several decades for me to let go of the lies on which I had been raised and embrace the beauty of my deliciously melanated skin.

It is my fervent desire that every woman of darker color (""young"" and ""old"") watches this documentary then immediately kicks to the curb all of the self-hatred, self-loathing, and despicable lies we have been told and have been telling ourselves for far too long.

5784237,2,B00D9EJFS2,"Nature is FULL of color; varying in hues and saturation, why should humans be any different?  It's ALL good and one is isn't better than the other.  I've eaten sweet 'white' (green) grapes just as I've eaten bitter red or dark grapes and vice versa.  They remain grapes.

This film shows 'looks' are given way too much power -- was that the intent?  Or was it to show that within melanin-rich communities, there's a dark/light divide similar to a black/white divide so one group is just as bad the other?

If 'The Look'  isn't approved by society (or themselves) than they could be successfully weakened (or castrated) to ever give birth to all that is within them.  Feeling 'rejected' because of how they look could disable their ability to cope with personal, social, or academic stresses in a healthy, confident way.  Thus, hindering growth and strength in humanity as a whole.

5784241,5,B00D9EJFS2,"Just watched Dark Girls & this movie is essential to help individuals understand some their neighbors of color. Two metaphors towards the end that I absolutly loved:
 Lynne Herod-Deverges - ""...if a dark-skinned woman were the eyes, and a light-skinned woman was the eardrum: Why would the eyes work so hard to be the eardrum, and would it make sense for the eardrum to try to become the eyes? It's important to be who you are.""
 Michael Colyar - ""...I always consider love like if you drop a drop into water, the ripples that go out is everybody else and you're that drop. So ,the love starts with you and goes outward. So you have to love...the essense of what you are.""",1506038400,,672,4.5
5784242,3,B00D9EJFS2,"Overall I thought this was an interesting documentary. It mostly addresses issues through personal vignettes, which makes it more approachable, but the drawback of this approach is that there is little in the way of substantial sociological analysis. I enjoyed hearing the individual people's thoughts, but I couldn't help but note how heavily the documentary focused specifically on beauty in relationship to skin color and self-esteem. Perhaps the filmmaker was unaware of the extent to which the documentary was pushing yet another societally-imposed belief -- that women are principally valued for their beauty and appearance? Pretty much everyone in the movie was quite attractive and unblemished, and that's great, but it seemed to be addressing one problem while blindly perpetuating another.",1504137600,,799,5.6115702479338845

5784257,5,B00D9EJFS2,"Dark Girls sets out to address and further problematize longstanding issues of colorism, especially among Black women and girls. The documentary recounts real-life experiences ""dark girls"" have faced since childhood that in most instances have followed them through adulthood. The accumulation of messages - often mean and cruel - have shaped perceptions of beauty, self-esteem, and aspirations to a point of questioning ones worth. Beyond that, Dark Girls is a reminder of stratified society on a macro and micro level. While the documentary centers Black women and girls, the issue of skin-tone is not germane to Black people. However, it pushes viewers to consider how and from where are messages are generated and who controls them. I am reminded of how relevant Drs. Kenneth and Mamie Clark's work is more than a half-century later. Dark Girls is another tool that can help talk through why and where do we go from here?

5784270,5,B00D9EJFS2,"As a woman, it can be very difficult to love yourself and feel beautiful in your own skin. The standards of beauty are so engrained in us all and the efforts women, some more than others, go through in order to feel beautiful can be soul crushing. We all need to stand together and say to each other and ourselves, ""You are enough just the way you are"". We need to be teaching our daughters and sons they are enough and exposing them to the diverse and beautiful people this world has to offer.

Now, I am not a woman of color and this film opened my eyes and broke my heart. The lack of representation that young girls of color have in the media is what screams to them, ""You definitely are not enough and you never will be"" because they will never be white. How must it feel to not be able to see someone who looks like you represented in the world around you? Often the stories young girls of color see are not positive ones or they are the side kick, friend, funny one, but rarely the star/hero? There are seemingly inconsequential things in my life that are screaming big messages to women and young girls of color. An example is the American Girl doll company. Every year there is a Doll of the Year and it comes with new books, fun accessories, and lots of focus. Most little girls love dolls and a lot of them really love these dolls and there has never been an Doll of the Year that was of color. What message does that send from a company that is allegedly pushing to empower little girls to be brave, smart adult women?

I would recommend watching this documentary and allowing it to push you a little deeper. Go outside of your comfort zone and confront the realities that many women are facing. As a white person, I have to ask what can I do to break this cycle? What have I done to contribute to this cycle?",1469232000,,1821,4.2601156069364166

5784273,4,B00D9EJFS2,I liked it. I learned a lot from this movie. I will say that they seemed obsessed with being beautiful. I'm tired of so much importance being placed on beauty. I know it's terrible that people have told dark skinned people they are ugly. Most of the women in this movie were really attractive. They were way more attractive than the average person. The majority of American women are overweight so I don't think this movie really represented the kind of appearance related insecurities of most ladies. Telling girls they are beautiful all the time kind of perpetuates the idea that being pretty is the most important thing in the world. A girl doesn't need to have that seed planted in her brain at a young age that her real purpose should be finding a husband. We still have professors telling girls at ivy league schools that they should find a husband while in college.,1466985600,,872,4.632258064516129

I really hate it when documentaries use their music to tell us ""this is profound."" Just let the story tell itself. Also, sorry, but that bit at the beginning with the psychotherapist (not a PhD) talking about atoms and trauma--kind of a lame maneuver. If you are going to try to put a scientific spin on something, do it properly. It's not even that I necessarily disagree with the sentiment behind it, but I didn't watch just for the sentiment, I watched to learn about the profound impact of having darker skin than the people around you. I'm saying this from the perspective of being a light-skinned black woman who grew up in an all-white environment.

I am waiting for Light Girls, to be made available on Amazon.",1426550400,3,389,4.579710144927536
5784357,5,B00D9EJFS2,"I know this movie seemed to get a lot of the black women I know arguing about who has it worse: Dark or light-skinned girls. However, when I watched this movie, I just thought about all the times I've heard comments like: ""Oh, you're pretty for a black/fat girl,"" ""She'd be so beautiful if she were white;"" ""If you were white I'd date you;"" and ""You talk so well!"" I've heard these comments at various points in my life, and so have some of the people I know.

The film, to me, really speaks on how black people were made to hate each other, not trust each other, and feel envious of each other along color lines. I know in my life, I've heard about darker-skinned people trying to bleach their skin, or bleach their children's skin. In many cultures, if you're lighter you have better job opportunities, you're deemed prettier/are fawned over, and you're deemed more trust worthy. You're still other, but you're perceived as being one step closer to the elite (sometimes one actually is one step closer). These are the types of experiences that these women and young girls have gone through.

The film also goes into the history of black people: color, class, and beauty. A version of Kenneth and Mamie Clark's study (Black Doll vs. White Doll) on colorism and racial identity(it wasn't called that at the time) was referenced, and performed on camera. One little girl actually stated that she didn't particularly like herself because she is darker skinned. An older woman pretty much stated that she was shocked when she got compliments because she was made to feel so unattractive based on her skin color. It was eye-opening and heartbreaking for me to see two people who are generations apart expressing some of the same thoughts and feelings on the same subject. The need for black empowerment becomes very apparent when watching this film.",1426118400,3,1845,4.744548286604362

I can't say enough good things about how this documentary breaks down various forms of self-hatred that get internalized due to the external pressures of racism and the dominant beauty aesthetics which deceive us into believing that lighter is better.

5784446,4,B00D9EJFS2,"The documentary Dark Girls by D. Channsin Berry and Bill Duke is a documentary that discusses the impact of colorism on women in the black community. This documentary is a great way to introduce yourself to the concept of colorism. The documentary displays the personal hardships of people who have to endure colorism face on a daily basis. I appreciate that this documentary was diverse. For example, it portrays an example of how colorism affects young girls and older women.  An example is of an older women speaking of her experience. She states, during her bath time, she would ask her mother to put bleach in the water so she can be lighter. She also discusses how the thought of it makes her upset even as adult. In addition, it shows some information about how it affects young men in the black community and we get and idea of what they think of the issue. Overall, the different ways darker skinned men and darker skinned women endure colorism was not discussed as much it should have been because women face different stigmas than men, I think it would have been beneficial to at least discuss the reason why the effects differ. There was also a lack of discussion on the damage colorism causes structurally in the black community. The documentary would benefit people of all ages and academic levels, but overall I think it would be a great introductory documentary for someone not familiar with the concept of colorism.",1412467200,3,1432,4.751004016064257

What is the resolution? How can dark skin women move on from  this? Why didn't they talk about slavery and the ROOT cause of colorism? What about Hollywood and the history of using biracial or fair skin actresses? And this still exists today. It's a good topic but it lacked depth. I'm not dark skin by the way, but I am a light brown African American female and although I can't relate to these stories, I know how it feels because my grandmother was ridiculed by her own husband for being 'dark' this movie was poorly done.",1403654400,12,686,4.276923076923077

5784498,2,B00D9EJFS2,"This documentary really shone a light on the racism among the black race. I am black and proud, yet never take part in bashing my own race based on dark or light color. I consider myself BLACK not dark or light skinned. Dark skinned girls are definitely treated differently, especially from racist whites. Yet light skinned girls feel it too. I have had my share of being called white bitch in confrontations and I find it quite funny because this ""white bitch"" could fight. It was as if being light skinned made me weaker in the eyes of my darker sisters. Don't get it twisted. As I got older, I never bought into the dark/light line some people could not seem to remove. I stopped drinking the punch because damn, we as a people are 1 race and the generalizing of ALL light skinned people thinking they are better is Bull.  I have been profiled, I have been called ""red"" when my skin aint nowhere RED.  I have experienced racism just like the next sister because I too am BLACK. It don't just go one way despite what people think. I recall begging my very light mother to put on extra sun tan lotion to get darker. I recall not even wanting to claim her as my mom around my friends because I felt she was white and I wanted no part of it. The ignorance displayed by my brothers on this documentary saying that it feels ""different"" to hug a light skinned girl...IGNANT, because ignorant would be giving him too much credit. We need to teach our children early that they better not EVER be ashamed of their shade. Black is Black and we as a people need to recognize that we will only continue to separate ourselves within our beautiful race if we keep stigmas like some of the speakers in this film. I gave this the rating of 2 because I respect the stories of my sisters in this video but please don't generalize as if anyone who is not dark skinned thinks they are better or that they cannot relate because I know I don't have those feelings in my heart and I know ive shared experieces of racism among my people",1401580800,5,2014,4.3537234042553195

5784500,4,B00D9EJFS2,"The 2011 documentary DARK GIRLS introduces, at least to me, the term ""colorism,"" which it seems to define as people within the same race valuing those of lighter skin over those whose pigmentation is darker.  Wasting no time in getting your attention, early in the film DARK GIRLS presents a young African American girl who, viewing otherwise identical depictions of a drawing of a girl in light to dark shades, identifies the fairest as most attractive and the darkest as least attractive.  Women varying in both age and brown-skinned cultures confirm that divisive conditioning, starting with their own families.

What purpose does defining someone by race serve, other than to divide people?  That's my question, but the question DARK GIRLS proposes is even better: How have the foremost victims of divisiveness - brown-skinned people and women - fallen victim to still more divisiveness, via the colorism we see in DARK GIRLS?",1401235200,,930,5.139072847682119

This is a poignant, painful, powerful insight into the agony Black women have endured simply because they have a darker hue.  These women are in the vanguard of the ""colorism"" that we have all confronted at one time or another in our lives.  On a more hopeful note:  I LOVED hearing from the Black men in the film who admitted that they PREFERRED a darker woman!  A well-deserved round of applause to Bill Duke and D.

fairly on the light side I have noticed the difference in treat at work , social events with preference given to me. This film just brings out the messages and wrong  meanings for our many skin tones . I've for sometime growing up always wanted to be of a darker tone. I felt different but not better than my friends who were of a darker complexion. And socially the two women that I married and girlfriends have been of different hues. The color of their skin had nothing to do with attractiveness. It's the person",1391990400,3,643,4.31404958677686

Interesting topic.  Ostracizing Black women who have high melanin content in their skin, while embracing fair-skinned women of color. Can such behavior still exist in a post-Obama America?

Absolutely!  The media glorifies it (the prevalence of using fair-skinned actresses and female models with straighten hair with Eurocentric facial characteristics, as opposed to using women with Afrocentric features) and a cottage industry still thrives  pushing hair care products with chemical relaxers and cosmetics to lighten the skin  to this day.

As a Black American man, I see it frequently.

Noteworthy film, bears watching.",1391904000,2,713,5.418181818181818
5784615,5,B00D9EJFS2,"I actually watched this documentary months ago on OWN and it still gets to me everytime how a lot of black/African American perceive skin tone in our community after being unchained from slavery a 130+ years ago, but the mentality is still in need of a repair on this issue.

The sad thing about this film is how the mentality on skin color continues to be passed down in our families, especially the children.  The scene with the young boy talking about having light versus dark skin should be the ultimate wake up call that enough is enough.

Even the media continues show certain entertainers that if you look like Beyonce, Alicia Keys or some bright skinned video vixen with a big derriere it gives people the impression that their beauty is the only beauty that matters.  The cosmetic and medical industries are making billions of dollars a year to give women of color features and skin that they have always desired.

Take a look at social networking site like Twitter, there are black individuals who hastag TeamLightskin, TeamBrownskin, or TeamDarkskin in their bios or tweets - still showing division!  And my mind instantly goes, 'Why not hastag TeamBlack!'  Lots of whites and other races still can't understand why blacks divide each other into these categories just to separate ourselves from saying we're black.

The films also addresses women of color, who are non-black, how they deal with the color complex issue in their countries.

I strongly suggest purchasing this film to educate and inform all minds.",1391904000,23,1523,4.8949416342412455

now on this film to be honest all i walked away from it thinking, that women really only care about what others say, think, and feel about them. which is ashame, i don't belive women really realized this problem. woman will put any chemical in there body or on the skin to be seen as trendy and fashionable or beautiful all for others to pay them a complement in order to feel better about themselfs.

I belive that women could learn alot from men about just being happy with who you are and what you may look like. men use there  confidence in oder to be seen as an equal in society.",1388880000,2,688,4.088888888888889

I found it very hard to be 'relentless' in telling my story and even writing a more descriptive title.  Hopefully, my book will be published in 2014.  I watched this DVD, and was surprised to find some of the women, who were not so dark skinned, experienced what is called 'colorism' -- I call it intra-racial prejudices.  I suffered the same mocking and taunting and even worse than the people depicted in this movie/documentary.

One woman who was interviewed was a little confused but the other women were sensible and their opinions and experiences I could relate to.  It rings with truth.  I felt so bad for the little black angels that were being interviewed but hopefully this documentary will give young black girls the tools needed to function in a world of hate.

Many of us have know idea that the people who build the wonders of the world ( Structures, inventions, monuments etc.) are mostly if not all deeply melanated people.

I find it interesting that the film alludes to the fact that the issue of skin colour has become world wide and is no longer  a North American problem.

The documentary discusses the issue of colorism from several aspects, and how it has affected women of color world wide. Stories from self hatred to coming to grips with the pain, and understanding that dark skin tone is beautiful. I would recommend this documentary to mentors to view with young  African American  girls, and  afterward talk about the pressures and frustrations they may be experiencing.

It made me appreciate my parents for raising us to NEVER see the color of ones skin only the person from within. I'm so thankful I've raised my children the same way; I'm so very grateful for that.
