8417843,5,B00478WKAO,I ordered this for my husband to be and my boys. They love it. It came fast and was packaged great. Thank you!,1414281600,,110,3.8260869565217392
8417844,4,B00478WKAO,"I know many Dragon Ball fans complain about the Orange Bricks being cropped, and I believe that it should not be cropped either. I also own a Dragon Box that cost $50 for 42 episodes. With that said, I have just purchased 74 episodes legally, with better-than-bootleg quality, 3 dub tracks, and awesomely-translated subtitles for $16. Being someone who's never owned the entire anime on DVD, I think this is a great deal compared to when singles cost $20 for 3 episodes. It is a great value for fans of the show who do not wish to buy things illegally and for first time buyers.",1411603200,2,578,4.514285714285714

8417846,5,B00478WKAO,"Finally, after so long the price is acceptable. Seasons 1 and 2 have always been the weakest because all they really do is serve as a prelude to the Frieza Saga. So you can see why I'd never pay more than $4 for each season. Season 1 is 20 something episodes of filler and the only good part is Goku vs Vegeta. Season 2 has some filler and Namek is boring until you get to the Ginyu force--- that's halfway through the season. Ya'll can whine about widescreen and losing picture all you want I don't care, I know a deal when I see one so if you see it too, get it quick.",1404864000,2,570,4.008771929824562
