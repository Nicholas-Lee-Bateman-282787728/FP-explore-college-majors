My first highschool hypnosis show I had 18 volunteers and got 15 of them with this induction.  Plus I'm pretty sure I fumbled my way through it.  It didn't even matter.  It works that good!",1484956800,,341,4.524590163934426
8348803,1,B00212TYKW,"The production of the dvd is good, but the camera work is terrible For the price they should use a professional. The induction, well nothing new. A variation of the Elman induction with PR. The video starts with this guy ego trip and a very distasteful anecdote. And if you go to the web site you'll find fake reviews in the amazon style.",1308873600,,338,4.380952380952381
8348804,5,B00212TYKW,"I have been using the EKG induction for over a year now.  I have (in 45 yrs) never found a better way to ""Put the Whammie!!!"" on the group.  Not only is it effetive(due to it's customisable content).  But, for the Satge, it is entertaining and quite theatrical.  It is different enough, that even the ""pro"" hypnotherapists are impressed and identifying it as a ""better way"" asking about where it came from etc.  I know that from the moment that I step out on stage, I have only minutes to ""Do something""  and start entertaining---the EKG fills the bill and hasn't faailed me.

I just woke up from the third time of trying to watch and learn this amazing induction. This  keeps knocking me out, LOL I am not kidding here. Am I the only one who has had this difficulty. I can only watch it piece by piece. Thank you for the interactive DVD LOL this is hands down the best induction I have found. It is a perfect hypnotic creation WOW!
