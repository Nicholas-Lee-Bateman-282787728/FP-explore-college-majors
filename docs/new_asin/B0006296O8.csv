8036862,3,B0006296O8,"This is a great tape for getting some great details that you may have not seen before. You might also pick up some details you didn't know about techniques you know.

The video is a collection of techniques by Rodrigo 'Comprido' Medeiros. He speaks in Portuguese and explains the entire technique before having the legendary Roero 'Jacare' Calcaventi explain them in english, while Medeiros demonstrates them again.

This seems to be an experiment that didn't work so well. On the negative side, it can is disjointed and easy to wander off during the parts you don't understand and becomes quite tedious.

On the plus side, however, you get to see the techniques slowly. And, if you're bilingual, you'll pick up nuances in both explanations you otherwise wouldn't.

As far as the techniques themselves, they are exactly as described on the cover. A snapshot of the techniques that make up Comprido's game at the time. Attacking from the back was never my strong point, but I can honestly say, my back game benefitted from this tape. Comprido covers details in control and attacks I didn't previously know and it has tightened my game up significantly.

In short, if you want a few new techniques that some might find unorthodox and are patient enough to trawl through the video to find them, this is not a bad buy.",1121212800,2,1314,4.79646017699115
