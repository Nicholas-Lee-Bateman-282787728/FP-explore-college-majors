8210079,4,B0002ERWQ4,"In most of my reviews, I have noted I'm not a fan of comedy anime, and other such wacky series.  However, my taste has branched out of late.  And it led me to take a look at Miami Guns, which ran across via the wired.  Nevertheless, this anime is beyond brilliant.  It takes cultural perspectives from Japan, to America and blends them into a matrix of pure laughter and gut busting gags.  Making fun of Die-Hard, to Wrestling.  This anime by far, has class, intelligence (stupidity) and just flat out fun.  This is a series any anime fan should own.  Trust me once you purchase the first DVD, you'll want the second DVD right then and there.",1094515200,2,642,4.427350427350428
