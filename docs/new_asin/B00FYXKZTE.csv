6040314,3,B00FYXKZTE,"You kinda know a script is pretty good when viewers talk to film.... This was one of them..., some of the actors could've used some upgrading.,",1433030400,,143,4.538461538461538
6040315,5,B00FYXKZTE,Great love story!!,1426636800,,18,5.333333333333333
6040316,3,B00FYXKZTE,There is a lesson to be given from this movie. Always tell the truth about yourself even if you might possibly loose that which you're aiming for because things that are done in the dark always come into the light. We all have some skeletons in the closet but learn to forgive because nobody is perfect.,1419638400,,303,4.428571428571429
6040317,4,B00FYXKZTE,"This was a very entertaining film. The acting, plot and direction were fine. The story really made me think about forgiveness and the true meaning of love. The two main characters were very interesting. I really felt for Simee. She went through a lot to become famous and now her past threatened to destroy her relationship with her new boyfriend. Everyone has to ask themselves will they be able to forgive and forget about a past indiscretion?  This film made me think about Kanye and Kim. This film would be rated R for at least six F-bombs and several B-words. There is no, sex, nudity or graphic violence. This is a great date movie. Better than most date movies that I've seen because it will make you think about your relationship. Mark Harris is an excellent writer and director and I look forward to his next project. Highly recommended.",1403913600,,846,4.677852348993288

8619592,4,B00FYXKZTE,"Its a small independent movie but the production value is solid! You will see a familiar face in a comedian and regular on The Carmichael Show. Acting is good,writing is solid. This is why you watch indies. Alot of indies are poorly done but this film doesn't use a low budget as an excuse.",1494633600,,290,4.388888888888889
