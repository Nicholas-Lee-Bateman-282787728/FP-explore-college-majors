As far as Summer Slam's go, Summer Slam 92 from London would have to be the best.  I would rate this in the top 7  Summer Slams...but not the best.

1243407,5,B00000K4YV,"This DVD really brought back memories of the attitude era, back at a time when the wrestlers had personality, not to mention good theme songs to match that personality. Back at a time when wrestling was more of a soap opera, and a darn good one at that. Yes I miss those times, having not followed the WWE in a few years now still believing they could do so much more with the talent they have and have really messed up what was a very good thing. It was great to relive the attitude era again through this pay per view.
This pay per view has the following matches:
Ivory vs. Tory for women's championship - probably the most boring of the matches although it ends funny.
Lion's Den Match Ken Shamrock vs. Steve Blackman - I enjoyed this match very much, don't think anything like it has been done in awhile.
D'lo Brown vs. Jeff Jarret with Debra, two titles on the line ... good match with an unexpected ending. Nice to see the puppies again.
Tag team championship match Kane and Xpac Vs. Undertaker and Big Show. Obviously Kane and Xpac are at a weight disadvantage here, but don't count them out. This match is a pretty long one.
Hardcore Championship Match Big Boss Man vs Al Snow... this match was one of my favorites, if not my favorite.. they are using everything, and going everywhere.
Kiss My Rear Match The Rock vs. Billy Gunn  ... I doubt anything like this has been done in a while. The commentary by Jim and Jerry is hilarious.
Love her or leave her match Shane McMahon vs. Test.. this match is hardcore to put it mildly, and rather amusing as well... very good match.
Triple Threat Match Stone Cold vs HHH vs Mankind with Jesse the Body as referee ... excellent match through and through. Definitely the best match along with the hardcore championship match. Jesse the body shows who is boss throughout this match.
There is also a hilarious speech given by Chris Jericho in this pay per view that is probably the single funniest moment in the pay per view, at least in my opinion, among other things that made the attitude era great.
Considering the price you can get this pay per view DVD for now, I'd say you should get it immediately.. it's definitely worth the money if you are a fan of the attitude era.",1079136000,7,2222,4.432762836185819

1243411,3,B00000K4YV,"This WWF Pay Per View took place in Minneapolis, Minnesota at the Target Center (just down the road from where I am now).  At the time, the governor of Minnesota was Jesse Ventura, a former WWF Superstar/Commentator.  He would be used as the special guest referee (he did this in the first Summerslam event in 1988) in the Main Event.
Two Titles on the Line: D'Lo Brown (c) vs. Jeff Jarrett with Debra
This match was decent, with DLo getting in most of the offense.  While I read recently that Jarrett is one of the best workers in the world, DLo came off looking much better than Jarrett in this one.  Fairly quick and unemotional.
WWF Women's Championship Match: Ivory (C) vs. Tori
Blah.  Not much more to say.
Love Her or Leave Her"" Greenwich Street Fight: Test vs. Shane McMahon
At the time, the storyline was that Test was dating Stephanie McMahon.  Shane didn't like Test, so was trying to break them up.  If Test won this match, Shane would [get] out of the relationship.  If Shane wins, Test can no longer date Steph.  Shane McMahon is not an everyday wrestler, but he has put on some good matches and has proven that he is willing to take the punishment required in order to entertain the crowd.  No different here.  While this isn't a 5 Star match by any means, it was one of the better matches of the night.
WWF Hardcore Championship Match: Big Boss Man vs. Al Snow (c) with Pepper
Im not sure I have ever seen The Big Boss Man in a good match.  Al Snow has his moments, but I didn't like his character back in 99 (other than getting joked on by Mankind).  This match went out of the Target Center, across the road, and into a couple of local shops.  Snow tried a moonsault off of a bar counter and crashed through a table.  That was the lone entertaining spot of the match.
WWF Tag Team Championship Match: Kane & X-Pac (c) vs. Undertaker & Big Show
Just about what youd expect with 3 very large men in the ring.  Slow.
The Rock vs. Billy Gunn
Billy Gunn has his moments, but this was just a silly premise of a match. Interesting enough, Gunn was just coming off a big win at King of the Ring.  That is usually a stepping stone to bigger things.  He comes off looking foolish here.
Lion's Den Weapons Match: Ken Shamrock vs. Steve Blackman
Blah, again.  Shamrock is a real fighter, and this was billed as a true fight (with weapons, but still).  The reality was the WWF fighting with punches pulled and designed to look good but protect the wrestler.  With the gimmick for the match being what it was, it was [bad.]
Tag Team Turmoil: Edge & Christian vs. Hardy Boyz vs. Mideon & Viscera vs. Droz & Prince Albert vs. The Acolytes vs. The Hardcore Hollys
A Royal Rumble styled tag match.  The match starts with two teams, and as one team is pinned, the next comes to the ring.  I never got to see Droz wrestle before, as he was later paralyzed, but he is barely in this match.  The best part of the match was the opening with Edge/Christian vs The Hardy Boyz (then part of the New Brood).
Triple Threat Match for the WWF Championship: Stone Cold Steve Austin (c) vs. Triple H  vs. Mankind with Jesse ""the Body"" Ventura as Special Referee
Without question, this was the highlight of the night.  Gov. Ventura was a presence and a factor, but was actually fair in the match.  While there was a lot of brawling elements in the match, it was entertaining seeing three of the bigger stars of the WWF in the ring at the same time (and it is always a highlight to see Mankind).",1046822400,,3479,4.345201238390093
1243412,3,B00000K4YV,"This summerslam had some flaws in it, but overall it was a decent show. Here's the list of all the matches and my opinion about them.
1. D-lo brown vs Jeff Jarrett (IC belt)
 This was a decent opener, but not anything too special! Best part of the match was when Mark Henry double-crossed D-lo to join Jeff Jarrett.
2. Tag Team Turmoil Match
 This was a very entertaining match. Two teams start off and as one team is elimanted, another one comes in. Edge and Christian put on a good show by elimating the Hardys, Albert and Droz, Midian and Visceria before being put out by the Hollys. Hollys couldn't get along which lead to the APA picking up the victory.
3. Al snow vs Big Boss Man (Hardcore Title)
 This match was a little entertaining, but overall not that great of a match. I would have rather seen Road Dogg vs Al Snow.
4. Ken Shamrock vs Steve Blackman (Lion Den Match)
 Not Bad! I think the main reason people didn't like this one is because neither Shamrock nor Blackman are known for entertaining, they are more into the wrestling. Shamrock knocked out Blackman with the Kendo Stick, a weapon Blackman is a master at using.
5. Tori vs Ivory (Women's championship)
 You might want to fast forward thru this one, definately the worst match on the show.
6. Test vs Shane O Mac (Street Fight)
 At first I didn't think this match would be that good because Shane is not a trained wrestler and Test hadn't been in a PPV since Wrestlemania 15 and he was just thrown in a match at the last second, but I was dead wrong. This was easily the best match on the show and Shane continues too prove that he can hang with the big boys. Both guys took the fight to each other, they used a stop sign, mailbox, and a picture frame. Shane also dove off the top rope and landed a vicious elbow drop onto Test on the Spanish Announcer's table. Mean Street Posse interfered alot in this one, but patterson and brisco saved the day for Test. Test won and was allowed to date Stephanie without Shane butting in their business. Of course, we all know what ends up happening at the end of the year!
7. Kane and X-pac vs Big Show and Undertaker
 Again, a decent match but nothing special. X-pac did kick out of a big show chokeslam but couldn't survive the tombstone. A decent showing by all four guys.
8. Rock vs Billy Gunn
 This was a match where the loser had to kiss the other guy's [behind]. This one didn't last very longer which was a little disappointing, but it was very entertaining. Nice match. Rock wins but Gunn didn't have to pucker up to the rock, but someone else instead, if you seen it you know what I'm talking about!
9. Triple Threat Stone Cold vs Mankind vs Triple H
 This was where Triple H was beginning to receive his big push that he felt he deserved a long time ago. Jesse ""The Body"" Ventura was the ref. Jesse did a great job officating the match-up as he forced Chyna to leave the ring and toss Shane McMahon out of the ring with some unfriendly remarks. The match went back and forth, no one really had complete control of the match-up. The funniest part of the match was when Triple H hit both Austin and Mankind with the chair and tried to pin Mankind to win the match and Jesse stood there with his arms crossed (He told all 3 guys he wouldn't count if they used objects to win the match). Triple H pedigreed Austin, Mankind broke the count and delivered a double arm DDT to seal the deal. Triple H gets mad and takes out his frustration on Austin after the match.
Good match, the only complaint I had about the match was the fact that writers made Mankind lose the belt the day after to Triple H.
Overall, it did have some real [bad] matches but it has some really good ones as well. With enough good wrestling in it, I would recommend it to anyone who truly loves wrestling.",1044748800,5,3793,4.316011235955056

Dlo Brown vs Jeff Jarrett w/ Debra
Great screwjob here! The match itself is also excellent, the crowd is very excited here as it is the opening match.

Tag Team Turmoil match: Hardyz vs Edge and Christain vs Mideon and Viscera vs Droz and Prince Albert vs Acolytes vs Hollys
This is one of my favorite matches on the card. Alot of action here, and all teams give it their all, especially the first 2 teams. Alot of high flying maneuvers and good heavyweight action later on.
9/10
WWF Hardcore title match
Al Snow  vs Bossman
Bossman does [stink], but this match is exciting. It goes to the back of the arena, to outside, even to a pool hall. Al Snow takes a crazy moonsault bump, and this match has a lot of chair shots and such.
8/10
WWF Womens title match
Ivory vs Tori
Athletic womens match. The match itself is decent, and the crowd is somewhat involved. The ending is horrible though
8/10
Lions Den Weapons match
Shamrock vs Blackman
Ok, not a good match. Slightly boring at times. And not much story going in to it

Greenwich Street Fight--Love her or Leave her match
Shane McMahon w/ Posse vs Test
This is the best match on the card, and even though it involves horse Test and a non-wrestler Shane, they together put on a great match with many great bumps. Its the best of Shanes matches to date.
10/10
WWF Tag Team Titles
XPac and Kane vs Undertaker and Big Show w/Paul Bearer
Great tag match. I like the fact that at this time XPac was in the land of the giants. XPac wrestled good here, especially considering he was fighting against Show and Taker. Kane also has a good showing here.
9/10
Kiss My Ass match
Rock vs Bad Ass Billy Gunn
There is a story going in to this match, and the story is decent, considering Billy Gunn never truly deserved his run with the Rock. The match is great,but not one of Rocks best.

1243414,4,B00000K4YV,"I was at SummerSlam 1999 in Minneapolis and everyone that I knew said that this was a disappointing PPV but I have to disagree because yes undeniably, there were some snoozer matches (ex: D'Lo Brown vx Double J, Inter-Euro Belts on the line, Kane and X-Pac vs Undertaker and Big Show and I hate to say it Lion's Den/Weapon's Match Ken Shamrock vs Steve Blackman). The rest of the matches were awesome.
Best match of the night, EASY! Shane McMahon vs Test, Greenwich Street Fight, Love her or Leave her match. This was easily one of the best Hardcore matches of the year (but not as good as HHH vs Vince McMahon at Armageddon 99). The match was completely brutal and Shane O Mac did something no one was expecting in that match and that was make his leap of fate from the top rope to the outside onto a beat up Test on a table. I could easily watch that match over and over again.
Another highlight was Y2J talking to trash to the Road Dogg Jesse James and the Hardcore Title match of Al Snow w/ Pepper vs Big Boss Man. And who could forget the Kiss My Butt match between BA Billy Gunn vs The Rock, probably one of Billy's best singles matches,
This was still one of my favorite PPVs of that year (1999) but then again, I don't think you could go wrong with any of the PPCs that year because they were all excellent that year.

Ivory and Tori was stupid, the Street Fight with Shane and Test was probably one of the matches that saved this pathetic show!

The tag team turmoil was good as the hardyz and edge and christian put on a nice show, and the hrdcore holly's making me laugh again as they could have won the match but hardcore wanted to make the pin so they got in a fight and lost, gee it is funny.
The lions den match could have been better as the 98 summerlsam lions den match was good.
The hardcore match was boring, until they went in the pub but still a match you would only watch twice and thats it.
street fight match probably the stealer of the night as everyone thought it wasn't gonna be this good!
Shane mcmahon shows that he is worthy in the ring and after this match fans looked foward to it!
A very beautiful elbow drop!
The tag match wasn't to bad.
The main event was pretty cool with venture not letting anyone disturb this match or cheat.
Over all this is a nice wwf ppv, summerslam 98 is one of my avourte ppv's and had it all, 2000 is also another great event as is 2001. Im not saying this is a bad ppv, it was pretty good but didn't beat last yrs.
WWF fans will enjoy this, but i say hire before you buy as different people have different opinions!",1009324800,,1234,4.124481327800829
1243418,5,B00000K4YV,"Mick Foley, himself, would say that you would ""have a nice day"" watching this DVD.  This was, by far, the best Summerslam in quite some time, and the DVD is truly put together quite nicely.
The main event on the card pits ""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin against the legend of hardcore, Mick Foley, and the best professional in the business, Triple H, in a triple threat match for the WWF Championship.  This match was awesome, and it was refereed by none other than the Governor of Minnesota and former WWF announcer, Jessie ""the Body"" Ventura.
The other big match on the card, and probably the best match of 1999, had Shane McMahon vs. Test in a Greenwich Street Match.  These guys pushed the match to the extreme, and they gave everything that they had.  It was an amazing back-and-forth match that, itself, is worth the price of the DVD.
This is an excellent DVD with lots of extras, not to mention being one of the better Pay-Per-View cards in the last few years.  This is a must for any fan of the WWF.",997056000,,1001,4.448087431693989
1243419,4,B00000K4YV,"This was my 1st WWF DVD and so far by judging the package quality (how it was put together the Xtras etc. not the event itself) it's the best WWF DVD on the market. Some of the matches were boring - Ivory vs. Tori, Ken Shamrock vs. Steve Blackman. but overall, the event was very good. The main event was awesome and the 3 Xtra commentary tracks by Austin,Mick and Triple H add so much more replay value to this disc. It also has a section on Jessie Ventura. Here are the matches and Xtra's and how I rate them:
1. Two Titles on the Line: D'Lo Brown vs. Jeff Jarrett with Debra: *** -A good opener with a title change and a back stabing.
2. Tag Team Turmoil: Edge & Christian vs. Hardy Boyz vs. Mideon & Viscera vs. Droz & Prince Albert vs. The Acolytes vs. The Hardcore Hollys *** 1/2 -A great, fast paced matchup with some great high flying moves.
3. WWF Hardcore Championship Match: Big Boss Man vs. Al Snow with Pepper ** 3/4 An average match, Road Dogg didn't do much on the Mic though.
4. Women's Title: Ivory vs. Tori * -This match is crap, chapter skip!
5. Lion's Den Match: Ken Shamrock vs. Steve Blackman * 1/2 -a match that holds your interest for about an minute (the entrances!)
6. Love Her or Leave Her"" Greenwich Street Fight: Test vs. Shane McMahon **** -Awesome match! Showing me that Shane O-Mac can pull of any move in the book, and great and funny return by The Stooges. Also, a great great ending!
7. WWF Tag Team Championship Match: Kane & X-Pac vs. Undertaker & Big Show *** -An OK match, some cool stuff by Kane & 6-Pack, oops, X-Pac but not much else.
8. ""Kiss My Ass"" Match: The Rock vs. Mr. Ass **** A great performance by both men this match shows that Billy Gunn deservs that push, to bad he was de-pushed after that.
9. Triple Threat Match for the WWF Championship: Stone Cold Steve Austin vs. Triple H vs. Mankind with Jesse ""The Body"" Ventura as Special Referee **** 1/2 -A great matchup with Jesse showing that he IS law & order. A title change also!
 Xtras ***** -You couldn't ask for more!

1243423,4,B00000K4YV,"SummerSlam was definitely one of the better PPVs of 1999.  Asmany remember, the preceding PPV, Fully Loaded, established the""End of an Era"" between Vince McMahon and Stone Cold Steve Austin.  So who's the top bad guy now, the one Austin will have to tear a new one into?  You guessed it, it's the man who's presently the top heel in the Federation right now, my personal favorite, the one who calls himself the game: HHH.  This PPV featured HHH's first time main eventing and I was more than excited and hopeful for the triple threat title match.  Now he wasn't much of a great top heel during this time in late August, more whiny..., but he eventually develops, especially when he reforms DX and goes up against the former top heel, Vince McMahon.  But that's future stuff.
SummerSlam itself was a definite enjoyment, and the twists, outcomes, and overall matches were satisfying.  My personal favorite match of this night is the ""Love Her or Leave Her"" match with Shane O' Mac pitting against Test, who was on his way to a big push (God only knows what happened).  The outcome of the match would have a lot of effect on the WWF's storyline in the future, as you WWF fans all know.  Well, the match was great and I gained a lot of respect for Shane's ability to take good bumps.  Besides that, the other matches such as Badd Ass and Rock were decent.  Here's another thing: Badd Ass was getting a push but losing this match put him back in the bottom or middle of the barrell.  The tag team title match of Taker & Big Show vs. the champions X-Pac and Kane was even okay, and you gotta give that trooper X-Pac some credit.  He's small and corny and sure he did cost him and Kane the title so... you know what, forget the credit.  But the match was good and strengthened the alliance between Show and Taker.  The main event, the triple threat match for the WWF title, was a real knockout.  No one seemed to care that Ventura was the guest referree, and were focused completely on Austin, Mankind, and HHH. I'll spoil this for you: HHH doesn't win, but that didn't bother me since I had a feeling he would win the next night (and by God, he did, only to lose it to Vinny Mac two weeks later).
Good PPV, I highly recommend it, especially since 1999 spewed out some real crappy ones.",958608000,5,2279,4.4033412887828165

1.) WWF Intercontinental and European Championship Match: Jeff Jarrett w/Debra vs D'Lo Brown (c)

Before D'Lo came out, Jarrett and Debra got in an argument that ended with Jarrett sending Debra to the backstage area. D'Lo came out moments later however, leading Debra and her eye-popping attire back out to ringside. This was a short but really fast and fun paced opening match to start off the show. After D'Lo misses a Senton Bomb, Jarrett grabs the guitar, preparing to grill D'Lo with it, but Debra gets on the apron, distracting both Jarrett and the referee. While Jarrett argues with Debra, Mark Henry runs in the ring and snatches it from Jarrett's hands and turns heel on D'Lo, breaking the guitar across his back. Jarrett picks up the scraps and makes the pin for the win to claim both the European and Intercontinental Championships. After the match, Henry, Debra, and Jarrett all raise each other's hands, revealing it was a set up all along

2.) Tag Team Turmoil Match: Edge and Christian vs The New Brood (The Hardy Boyz) w/Gangrel vs The Acolytes vs Hardcore Holly and Crash Holly vs Prince Albert and Droz vs Mideon and Viscera

Basically the rules of a Tag Team Turmoil Match are that 2 teams will start in the ring. After one team is eliminated, the next will follow. The last remaining team will be the winners of the match. Edge and Christian and The Hardyz start things out with each other with an awesome showing they always gave us when they got in the ring with each other. An electric chair drop from Edge, followed by an elbow drop off the top turnbuckle from Christian on Matt, spells the end for The Hardyz. Viscera and Mideon are out next and completely pick apart Christian and Edge in the beginning. Edge and Christian use their teamwork to knock Viscera out of the ring, leaving Mideon open to a Spear from Edge that eliminates them from the bout. Droz and Prince Albert are out next and give Edge and Christian no time to rest as they rush to the ring and similar to Mideon and Viscera, stay in control of the blonde haired tag team for the first few minutes. They soon gain momentum back and Edge eliminates Droz and Albert, following a Downward Spiral on Albert. The Acolytes are out next, beating E&C from pillar to post around the ring and ringside area. After some exciting back and forth action from the 2 teams, the Acolytes manage to get rid of Edge and Christian after Bradshaw flattens Edge with a Clothesline From Hell. The Hollys enter immediately where Crash takes a good beating from the Acolytes for a good portion of their time in the match. Hardcore makes a blind tag, causing him and Crash to start fighting with each other, ending with Hardcore knocking Crash out of the ring. A spinebuster from Faarooq on Hardcore marks the end of this match. The Acolytes win and become #1 contenders for the Tag Team Championships the next night on Raw. Fun tag team match, giving WWF's tag team division some time to shine

Road Dogg comes to the ring to complain about not being on the SummerSlam card or in the Hardcore Championship Match. This leads to Chris Jericho coming out, making his first SummerSlam appearance and owning Road Dogg and the crowd on the microphone. It ends with Road Dogg shutting down Jericho and telling him to suck it

3.) WWF Hardcore Championship Match: Al Snow vs Big Boss Man (c)

Snow stands atop the SummerSlam platform, waiting for Boss Man's arrival where he leaps down on him. Road Dogg who stayed at ringside after his confrontation with Jericho, treats fans to some really funny and entertaining commentary on the microphone during the match, as he follows Snow and Boss Man everywhere they go during the match. The match never even makes it to the ring as Snow attacks Boss Man with a chair at the beginning of the match and the 2 (3 if you include Road Dogg as a non-participant) make their way to the backstage area. Ahh good old Attitude Era hardcore matches! Backstage, tons of weapons get used on the opponents from crutches to a Pepsi machine. The fight goes to the outside and goes across the street to a restaurant outside dining area. It ends up spilling to the inside of the restaurant where some jabroni gets in the way on the way on in. The fight ventures even further as Snow and Boss Man beat the heck out of each other with mops before heading into the men's restroom. Boss Man smashes a beer bottle over Snow's head and tries to pick a fight with the Dogg but the Dogg hits Boss Man in the back of his head with the nightstick. Snow takes advantage and pins Boss Man on top of a pool table to win the Hardcore Championship. Snow sprints across the street back to the arena where he assaults Stevie Richards and the Blue Meanie with a crutch for messing with his dog, Pepper. Entertaining and hilarious treat of a match. I can't tell you how funny it was to watch Road Dogg randomly follow Snow and Boss Man around, while doing commentary on a microphone. The Snow/Boss Man feud is an underrated mid-card feud from the Attitude Era as these two had some amazingly fun hardcore bouts back then. I suggest checking out their Fully Loaded match on the Network for proof

4.) WWF Women's Championship Match: Ivory (c) vs Tori

This feud all started when Ivory had a few weeks before on an episode of Sunday Night Heat, humiliated Tori by spraying some degenerative words across her stomach and back. As I've said in many of my reviews of 1999 WWF PPVs that featured female matches, this was before a definitive Divas division was established in WWF. Ivory was still working on becoming a decent competitor in the ring and Tori couldn't wrestle to save her life. But Tori was adorably cute though. I always had a liking for her back then. As most female matches were back then, this match was bowling shoe ugly as J.R would say. Too slow executing moves that were mostly punches and kicks and weak grapples. Ivory retains with a sunset flip counter on Tori for the win. After the match, Ivory tries to remove Tori's top to expose her goods to the crowd but Luna makes the save and chases Ivory to the back.

5.) Lion's Den Match: Steve Blackman vs Ken Shamrock

This was only the second Lion's Den Match to happen at SummerSlam and would be the last one to take place there as well. In fact, it was the last Lion's Den Match in WWF altogether. Blackman entered with his signature nun-chucks and got in a quick shot on Shamrock's leg in the beginning. Shamrock manages to gain control of the chucks with a leg takedown an attempts to attack Blackman with them, but Blackman counters, gains back the chucks and chokes Shamrock with them. Shamrock escapes the choke and tosses the nun-chucks out of the Den. After reversing many of Shamrock's offensive moves, Blackman scales the Den and brings down a pair of mini kendo sticks and assaults his former friend with them. Blackman takes Shamrock apart with a larger kendo stick and instead of escaping, taunts the crowd, giving Shamrock time to recover. Shamrock makes a comeback and beats the heck out of Blackman with the kendo stick and wins by climbing to the top of the Den. This was a fairly exciting match with a lot of technical offense from both opponents. Shamrock and Blackman meshed really well together as opponents. This was a lot better than Shamrock's Lion's Den Match the previous year at SummerSlam with Owen Hart. The pace of this match was really fast paced and the crowd seemed much more alive for this one than the other one.

6.) Love Her or Leave Her Greenwich Street Fight: Test vs Shane McMahon

- If Test wins, he gets to marry Stephanie

- If Shane wins, Test must leave Stephanie

The storyline for this feud was really interesting. Stephanie McMahon, who had only been an on-screen character in WWF for a few months, had fallen in love with Test and Test had fallen in love with her. Shane McMahon didn't approve of Stephanie's relationship with Test and after finding out Test wanted to marry Stephanie, Shane hired his best buds from Greenwich; the Mean Street Posse to take out Test. The plan didn't work as Test attacked a member of the Posse each week, until the Backstreet Boys rejects were no longer a threat. It then all lead to this Street Fight. Just as the match starts, the Posse collectively returns in casts and neck braces and take seats at ringside--on a couch, to watch the match. Test attacks Shane at ringside and completely manhandles him during the opening minutes of the match. Test goes as far to press slam Shane into the crowd on to the Posse, knocking them over on the couch and nailing them all with a cookie sheet. Shane eventually gains control and the Posse hands Shane numerous weapons to use on Test from road signs to their very own mailbox and even a portrait of the Posse that Shane shatters over the head of Test. After Test accidentally takes the referee out with a Big Boot, the Posse mug him and set him across the Spanish Announce Table where Shane dives off the turnbuckle through Test with an elbow drop. Posse roll Test back in the ring and Shane makes the cover only for Test to kick out, earning a big pop from the crowd. Gerald Briscoe and Pat Patterson end up interfering on Test's behalf, attacking Posse to a shockingly good ovation from the audience. Test slams Shane into the mat with a Pumphandle Slam and follows it up with an elbow drop off the top turnbuckle and covers Shane for the win. Stephanie runs to the ring after the match and celebrates with Test. Nothing but a well performed match from both Shane and Test who went to great lengths to make this match awesome with the time they had

7.) WWF Tag Team Championship Match: Kane and X-Pac (c) vs The Unholy Alliance w/Paul Bearer

This was right around the time Undertaker and Big Show had aligned as a tag team and they were getting a tremendous push from the company. I always wonder how much success they would've been as team had Taker never gotten injured. Kane debuted a new attire on this night which featured the inverted colored bodysuit--one of my favorite Kane attires. The match starts with Pac and Kane attacking the Unholy Alliance as they enter the ring. Overall it was a well booked match with some decent spots here and there. In the end, Undertaker gets the win with a Tombstone Piledriver on X-Pac to win the Tag Team Championships. This would mark Undertaker's last PPV appearance of 1999 until his PPV return at the 2000 Judgment Day

8.) Kiss My Ass Match: Mr. Ass vs The Rock

Billy came to the ring with the person he had hid under the blanket all night and uncovers it to be a random fat woman. Billy says that when he beats The Rock, he won't kiss his backside, he'll be kissing hers! Billy goes on to say that Rock will smellalalala what her ass is cooking. Lawler makes hilarious but somewhat nasty jokes, saying he's heard of buns of steel but those are buns of cinnamon. Lmao! Only Lawler! In addition to a great and fun bout from Rock and Billy, we were treated to hearing Lawler and J.R. constantly make jokes about the fat woman's butt for most of the duration of the match. The match ends up going near the entrance walkway before heading over to ringside where Rock takes a drink of water from the announce table and does his classic Attitude Era water spit-take in Billy's face. Billy retaliates seconds later, cleaning Rock's clock with a shot to the head with the ring bell. Lawler continues making some gut buster jokes about the fat woman's butt and how bad it smelled. Rikishi hadn't debuted yet and there were already so many butt jokes in this match. Lawler was hilariously ruthless towards that woman. Billy manages to counter a Rock Bottom into a Fameasser. Billy brings the fat woman in the ring. She pulls up her outfit to reveal undergarments that had a hole in them, causing Lawler to do a comical gasp of disgust. Billy drags Rock over to the woman but Rock fights back and stuffs Billy's face right into her posterior. Rock hits the Rock Bottom on a stunned Billy and sets up for The People's Elbow to a grand ovation from the Minneapolis crowd. One People's Elbow later and The Rock has won the match.

9.) WWF Championship Triple Threat Match: Mankind vs Triple H w/Chyna vs Stone Cold Steve Austin (c)  (Special Referee: Jesse ""the body"" Ventura

The build-up for this match was a bit clustered to say the least as the #1 contendership changed hands more times than a blunt at a stoner's birthday party. First it went to Chyna who won a Triple Threat match between herself, Undertaker, and Triple H. Then Mankind beat Chyna to become #1 Contender, then Triple H and Mankind went to a draw in a match, drawing to the conclusion that both men were #1 Contender and would get a shot against Steve Austin for the title. Originally this match was supposed to be Chyna vs Austin but for reasons I don't remember, the company took her out and put in Triple H and Mankind instead. Triple H goes after Austin as he enters the ring and the final match of the card is underway. Austin beats down on Helmsley in the opening minutes, while Foley tries to steer clear of being in the way. They both go back to their tag team days for a short second to double team Triple H but it ends right after as Mankind and Austin scuffle for a moment. HHH and Austin fight each other on the outside, while Chyna attacks Mankind behind Ventura's back. While Ventura puts his focus on separating Foley and Chyna, Triple H takes a steel chair and takes out Austin's knees with it. HHH and Mankind brawl in the ring for awhile and Ventura gets a big pop after banning Chyna from ringside after catching her blatantly attacking Mankind. Austin, practically on one leg after the chair shot re-enters the ring, only to get beat down by both Mankind and Triple H. Austin ends up getting the Stunner on Mankind and goes for the pin but Triple H breaks it up with a steel chair to Austin's back. Triple H nails Mankind with the chair as well as Ventura mouths off at Helmsley. Triple H pins Mankind but Ventura refuses to make the count. Triple H and Ventura argue, leading to Shane McMahon running down and getting in Ventura's face. This leads to Stone Cold taking Shane O' Mac out with a Stunner before Ventura throws him out like a piece of trash. The final 5 minutes of the match become really chaotic with a lot of close calls. The end comes with Triple H nailing Austin with a Pedigree only to be knocked down by Mankind. Mankind follows up on Austin with a Double Arm DDT and makes the cover for the win. After the match, Triple H completely destroys Stone Cold's knee with the steel chair to take SummerSlam off the air",1439856000,,16614,4.947972730534625

Intercontinental & European Championship
Jeff Jarrett vs. D' Lo Brown
D'Lo was a dual champion here and both titles were on the line. This match certainly got the crowd going. It was also a pretty good contest. The match also has a surprise end. A nice opening contest. 3.5/5

Tag Team Turmoil for the #1 Contendership
Edge & Christian vs. Hardy Boys vs. Mideon & Viscera vs. Droz & Albert vs. Acolytes vs. Hardcore & Crash Holly
This was a pretty good tag team turmoil. E&C along the Hardys starts things off and they have a great showing. They surely got the crowd pumped up with their high flying offense. Jeff even takes a spear on the outside out of mid air. E&C has a great showing, lasting all the way until the final two. A very good match. E&C are the ones who made this match. 4.25/5

Hardcore Championship
Al Snow vs. Big Bossman
The match itself never gets taken to the ring. Snow and Bossman fights all the way in the back, using whatever they find on each other. They even take the match across the street to a bar where the match ends. Definitely a wild match up but these two certainly could have done better since we all know what they can do in this kind of environment. 3/5

Women's Championship
Ivory vs. Tori
This was a nice little match up. Ivory is a good womens wrestler and she made Tori look like what she was doing. A fairly good women's match with a little twist after the match. 2.5/5

Lions Den Weapons Match
Ken Shamrock vs. Steve Balckmon
The lions den match makes its return after debuting at 1998's Summerslam. This match was much different then from that one. This match was much more physical. The kendo sticks were use pretty good. But I found nothing really special about this match. The rules were just stupid and they really didn't work in right. But its still worth a watch. 3.5/5

""Love Her or Leave Her"" Greenwich Street Fight
Shane McMahon vs. Test
Awesome match and very physical as well. The Mean Street Posse would interfere but they really didn't hurt the match in my opinion. Test looked very good in this match and so did Shane. A couple of good spots with the weapons and to point out a good table spot too. A very good street fight. One of Test's and Shane's best matches. 4.5/5

WWE Tag Team Championship
Kane & X-Pac vs. Undertaker & Big Show
A very good tag team match up right here. I enjoyed this match very much. I thought all four men looked very good in this match. But especially Kane. He really took it to Taker & Show. A pretty good tag team match. Much better then expected. 4.25/5

Kiss My A** Match
The Rock vs. Billy Gunn
A pretty good match but not as good as it could've been. The match has some good action to take place on the outside. Including a shot with the ring bell to The Rock. Another good match but not one of my favorites of the night. 4/5

WWE Championship with Jesse ""The Body"" Ventura as the Special Guest Ref
Stone Cold Steve Austin vs. Triple H vs. Mankind
A very strong main event. The Body just lets everything go in this match. He let these three just go at it. Austin, The Game, & Mankind held nothing back. Action was happening all over the arena. In the ring, out of the ring, in the crowd, on the announce table, just everywhere. A very good triple threat match. A great main event to close out the show. 5/5

Summerslam '99 is a good event. Most of the matches delivered. The main event sure did. If you can find this somewhere cheap then I recommend this, or just wait until the Summerslam anthololgy volume sets are released to see it.",1234310400,,3817,4.325874125874126
7914313,4,B00000K4YV,"An old DVD & for those keeping track one of the WWF's first DVDs on one of their major shows. The hype surrounding this event was that Jesse ""The Body"" Ventura was going to be making his return to the WWF to referee the main event & vowed to maintain order the way that he wants to but that's not all that this event delivers on while the DVD extras are really a treat as well.

Intercontinental/European Champion D'Lo Brown vs Jeff Jarrett. This match was for both the Intercontinental & European titles but before the match started, there seemed to be tension between Jarrett & Debra to the point where Debra came out with D'Lo after Jarrett sent her back. These two were considered as underrated performers & this match shows that as these two put on a great opener that went back & forth with the surprise being how the ending was pulled off that lead to the heel turn of Mark Henry.

Tag Team Turmoil. The winners of this match would receive a shot at the Tag Team titles. This was one of the better turmoil matches that the WWF has had with the highlight being the interaction between Edge & Christian against the Hardy Boyz as these two teams put on an outstanding performance that they would soon top in their classic ladder match a few months later. Other moments include Edge & Christian running the marathon, The Acolytes taking advantage of the numbers games & the Hollys actually fighting each other at one point.

Hardcore Champion Big Bossman vs Al Snow. Before the match, Road Dogg came out to challenge the winner of this bout before being interrupted by Chris Jericho. Once that got out of the way, this was a better match than their Fully Loaded encounter as Snow wasted no time by leaping off the SummerSlam set onto the Bossman at the opening bell. From there, they went backstage using various weapons before fighting in the streets that lead to both men going into a bar with Road Dogg following the action & making his presence felt at the end on who he wanted to win.

Women's Champion Ivory vs Tori. This was the first flop of the night as Ivory just couldn't pull out a good performance from Tori with the only somewhat memorable moment being Luna making an appearance at the end.

Lion's Den Weapons Match: Ken Shamrock vs Steve Blackman. The end of their fued that lasted throughout the summer with the rules being much different than the previous year's match as the only way to win was by knockout. Due to that rule, this didn't top the previous Den match with Shamrock & the late Owen Hart as they just used weapons before Shamrock sealed the deal with a kendo stick shot.

""Love Her Or Leave Her"" Greenwich Street Fight: Test vs Shane McMahon. Shane proved at WrestleMania XV that he was capable of having one of the best matches of the night & this was no exception. These two went at it hard & even got stiff at times while using weapons like trash cans, a picture frame & other various weapons with one moment to look out for being Shane diving off the top turnbuckle to deliver an elbow through the Spanish Announce table onto Test. With cameos from the Mean Street Posse & Patterson & Brisco, Test overcame the odds in what is probably his best WWF match in his career.

WWF Tag Team Champions Kane & X-Pac vs The Undertaker & Big Show. Honestly, one paper most fans would assume that this would be the weakest match on the card but this was a surprise. A great tag team match with X-Pac being the smallest man in the match & having to resert to his speed & quickness while Kane used his power offense to combat Taker & Show along with the story of Show trying to prove a point to Taker playing a factor in this match that again was better than most expected it to be.

""Kiss My A**"" Match: The Rock vs Billy Gunn. This stipulation was added by The Rock due to what happened on RAW earlier in the week with Billy Gunn bringing out a fat woman with him to this match claiming that Rock would have to kiss her a** if he lost the match. This was one of Gunn's best singles matches (and there weren't many) as he held his own & brawled with The Rock & was even able to pull off a few wrestling moves as well before Rock turned the tables on Billy Gunn.

WWF Champion Stone Cold Steve Austin vs Triple H vs Mankind w/Special Referee Jesse Ventura. Jesse Ventura referees this match with no particual set of rules but will only allow the wrestlers to win under fair methods. Austin, HHH & Mankind brought their best to the table as this was one of the best & forgotten triple threat matches in WWF history as it was just non-stop action with each man getting their moment to shine while selling the fact how much that they want to win the WWF Championship. Jesse Ventura only got involved to sent Chyna to the back & take out Shane that if you pay close attention caused Austin to get tangled in the ropes. The ending was a shocker for it's time as nobody expected the person that won to win with an aftermath that set up the Austin/HHH feud for No Mercy months later.

The DVD extras were certainly a highlight for it's time that still stands today. Stone Cold, Triple H & Mick Foley each give their own personal commentary on their main event match including Austin & Triple H throwing cheap shots at each other. Other extras include features that can been seen on the event that helped set up the feuds for SummerSlam, the press conference that if you looked closely can see the animosity between Vince McMahon & Jesse Ventura while the other extras include footage of Jesse Ventura.

In the end, this SummerSlam event did a great job in continuing storylines & delivering great action for the most part along with the loads of extras along with the alternate commentary for the main event that makes this another SummerSlam worth getting but if you can, try to get the DVD edition.",1222387200,,5817,4.4220354808590105

You know... when you watch an old Hulk Hogan match or Bret Hart match, the whole ""He's going for the WW(gag) Championship!"", there was the WWF.  And it was good.

This event was good, too, and a refreshing departure from my quest of watching exponentially awful WWE events from many years later.

WWF Intercontinental and European Championship
Jeff Jarrett (C) vs D'Lo Brown (C)
I don't like either men.  That's simple.  The match wasn't that entertaining, but it was entertaining.  Don't question that logic, because it is flawless.  The surprise finish was really the only highlight of the match.  (5/10)

Tag Team Turmoil
Edge and Christian w/o Gangrel and Brood vs The Hardy Boys w/ Gangrel and New Brood vs Albert and Droz w/o paralysis vs The Acolytes vs Mideon and Viscera w/o tanktop vs Hardcore Holly and Crash Holly
This one started great, but got progressively weaker as the less exciting tag teams got involved.  It was amazing seeing Edge and Christian and The Hardy Boys going at each other.  (8/10)

Lion's Den Match
Ken Shamrock vs Steve Blackman
I don't know why this match was ever devised.  Maybe to quell Shamrock's mad desire for a fake MMA match in the WWF?  It was essentially a polygonal cage match sans ropes in a mini-ring off somewhere else in the arena, with such a polyglot of weapons chosen by Steve Blackman as ""Kendo Stick"", ""Singapore Cane"", and ""Shinai"" (note: they're all the exact same weapon), as well as ""the sticks"" as everyone calls them---those two things Blackman wiggles about like a raver.  Blackman also brought in nunchuks, but Shamrock threw them out of the cage after a while.  There was some good wrestling, but it was mostly about the weapons.  I don't think anyone but Shamrock understood the rules of the match, as Blackman was laying on the ground, Shamrock climbed on the cage and started posing, and the referees sort of... declared Shamrock the winner.  (6/10)

Women's Championship
Ivory (C) vs Tori
Two women without last names go at it, in a Diva's match that actually was far better than Diva matches in the WWE today.  Luckily it was only a few minutes long.  (4/10)

Hardcore Championship
Al Snow vs The Big Boss Man (C)
The Hardcore stories (as I call them) of late 1999 to early 2001 were some of the highlights of my WWF watching days during that time.  This was all the Hardcore division was about, sans harder hits with harder weapons.  Snow and the Boss Man ended up outside of the arena, running across the street, and brawling on the sidewalk while security held the crowd off.  They then ended up in a restaurant, and it was just a fun entertaining experience.  Highlight of my DVD watching.  (10/10)

Tag Team Championship
The Undertaker and The Big Show vs Kane and X-Pac (C)
Kane and X-Pac is an awkward pairing for me, but everyone was certainly at their best in this match.  Despite X-Pac's small size to these giants, he actually has the best strategy against them than anyone else his size/weight would.  He relies almost entirely on his legs, kicking and such, while Kane holds up most of the match in an excellent display of power wrestling by the Undertaker and Kane.  (9/10)

Test vs Shane McMahon
The Mean Street Posse came out, and the crowd died.  No, not really, but they did come out and they were pretty dumb.  Then the match started, and despite Test's severe lack of charisma, it came out fairly decently.  (6/10)

The Rock vs Billy Gunn
The buildup to this match was among the absolute best in The Rock's promos and insults.  Who can forget that promo in which God spoke to Billy?  The match had little technical wrestling, but was a great display of athleticism and high-impact entertainment.  (8/10)

WWF Championship
Mankind vs Triple H vs Stone Cold Steve Austin (C)
Jesse Ventura as the guest referee was pretty useless here.  He was completely biased against Triple H, so much so that just because Triple H used a steel chair, he REFUSED to count his pinfalls for the rest of the match.  The match itself was fairly plain and Mankind didn't get to do much, while there was an awkward sort of attempt at kinship between Ventura and Austin.  Jesse didn't even bother to get out of the ring and follow the wrestlers when they started brawling around the arena.  (6/10)

It was a magical time for wrestling back then, wrestling was at an all time high during those years and the WWF was going head to head with WCW. This pay-per-view in particular happened during the Austin vs Vince beef, and is also the event that saw Jesse the Body Ventura referee the main event in the state he was in office to.

1. D'LO BROWN VS JEFF JARRETT-the opening contest for the evening was a two titles on the line match, the Intercontinental & European Championships. D'Lo was the defending champ and actually had the mental edge during the match as he was accompanied to the ring by Jeff's Manager Debra after Jarrett kicked her out of his corner. The match its self was pretty good match as each wrestler went after the other relentlessly, but it was D'Lo's boy Mark Henry that was the determining factor. It turned out to be a plot from the beginning between Jeff, Debra, and Henry to screw over D'Lo for the belts. Over all it was a great opening bout. 4.5/5

2. TAG TEAM TURMOIL:EDGE & CHRISTIAN VS THE HARDY BOYZ VS MIDEON & VISCERA VS DROZ & ALBERT VS THE ACOLYTES VS THE HOOLYS-this match as to be the best of the night, which says a lot for the WWF's tag team division back then. E & C started this match out against the Hardy's aka at the time ""The New Brood"" as Gangrel was their mentor. The opening section of the match was definitely a prelude to the historic matches these two teams would be involved in together later in their careers. It was quick paced and featured a lot of action until E & C got the pin after Christian dropped an elbow from the top rope on to Mat. After that Mideon and Viscera came in to face E & C. But a spear from Edge sent the two bigger wrestlers to the back, and Droz and Albert were the next to be defeated by Edge and Christian. But their winning streak would come to a violent end when the Acolytes rushed down the isle and sent the two Canadians to the back. Next up The Hollys came down only to meet defeat in part to their own constant fighting amongst themselves. So the Acolytes won the match earning a title shot for the tag titles the next night on Raw. 5/5

Next up was an unscheduled appearance from DX member Road Dogg Jesse James as he came down to the ring to vent about not being in the Hardcore title match, when all of a sudden Y2J Chris Jericho appeared and the two got into a war of the words till Jericho left.

3. BIG BOSS MAN VS AL SNOW-after the thing with Road Dogg and Y2J, Road Dogg followed the action between Boss Man and AL snow every where including inside a restaurant with a mic adding some additional commentary with J.R. and King. The match its self was an ok match for the Hardcore Title, not the greatest hardcore match ever. It ended when Road Dogg hit Boss Man in the back with his own nightstick. Afterwards Snow went running off to find his dog Pepper only to get into an altercation with Stevie Richards and the Blue Meanie. 4/5

4. IVORY VS TORI- the next match up was for the Woman's title as Ivory defended against Tori, and there really wasn't a lot that happened in this match. Probably the weakest match of the night. 3/5

5. THE LION'S DEN WEAPON'S MATCH:KEN SHAMROCK VS STEVE BLACKMAN-this match in particular was one of the ones I was waiting for the most, simply because I was always a fan of Shamrock's ever since I watched the UFC he was in, and also because I always liked Blackman as well. The match its self did not live up to the hype as much as I thought it would, not to say that the match wasn't enjoyable, but it wasn't what it could have been. After an ok fight between the two Shamrock ends up winning the match after canning Blackman in the head twice. 4/5

6.""LOVE HER OR LEAVE HER"" GREENWICH STREET FIGHT:SHANE MCMAHON VS TEST-definitely one of the better matches on the card, and also had the most memorable moment of the entire night when Shane came off the top rope down onto Test on top of a table [Spanish announce table]. This was one of the first times people were able to see the athletic ability of Shane and of course anybody who watches wrestling knows that Shane went on to deliver some pretty memorable moments in side the ring. The match ended after Pat Patterson and Jerry Brisco attacked the Mean Street Posse and evened the odds for test. After a pump handle slam test went to the top and deliver an elbow of his own to get the win over Shane. 5/5

7. KANE & X-PAC VS BIG SHOW & THE UNDERTAKER-This match up was for the WWF Tag Team Championship as defending tag champs Kane and X-Pac went up against the Big Show and Undertaker. This was a surprisingly good match that saw Taker & Show take the titles from the champs in a highly entertaining match. The down fall of the champs was all on X-Pac as he tagged himself in and was greeted by a Big Show choke slam, and a Tombstone Pile driver from Taker. 4.5/5

8. KISS MY MATCH:THE ROCK VS BILLY GUNN- this was another match I was looking forward to as Billy Gunn was always a fav of mine ever since he crushed Honkey Tonk Man's head with a guitar and joined Road Dogg way back 1997. also I was always a fan of the Rock once he dropped the good guy look and joined the Nation of Domination back during that same year. So to say the least I was pretty excited about this match, and just like I thought this match did not disappoint. This was a bout between two very gifted athletes, and two very entertaining guys. This great match ended when Rock shoved Billy into the woman's rear end, and then hit him with a Rock Bottom and People's Elbow for the win. 4.5/5

9. TRIPLE THREAT MATCH:STONE COLD STEVE AUSTIN VS TRIPLE H VS MANKIND, JESSE ""THE BODY"" VENTURA AS SPECIAL REFEREE-this was another really hyped match due to Ventura's involvement in the match, I have to say I respect Ventura for going back to his roots even though the media made him look dumb for it. The match its self was a pretty good match between the three, but the best part of the match was when Ventura refused to count the three for Triple H because he used a chair. But after all of the back to back finishers from all three Mankind wound up winning the WWF championship after hitting Hunter with a double arm ddt. Over all it was an ok match. 4/5

over all this was pretty good event, and featured some really good matches. I recommend this event to all who are lucky enough to find it.",1170028800,,6366,4.278239202657807

One of the worst main events I've seen.  Basically no actual wrestling at all.  Just 20 minutes or so of punching and kicking.
