6260485,5,B00IE6SV76,"So I LOVE the first generation, actually grew up with this series. For years I had been looking everywhere to complete my skimpy collection of Dvds that had come out years ago and are difficult to find for a decent price. After finding this just knew I had to have it. I believe the quality is amazing for the price. The sound and picture are great, and the casing is nice. If you are a fan debating on getting this, then I would definitely recommend you get it.",1421280000,5,462,4.261363636363637
6260486,1,B00IE6SV76,"I didn't like the fact that it was entirely english dub with no options to change to original audio with english subtitles. Also, there were no extra features, just straight up poorly dubbed episodes. Most disappointing $ 60 I've spent on any anime.",1419724800,2,249,4.813953488372093

6260488,3,B00IE6SV76,"There is no Japanese track on this release. I understand that including would have been nigh-impossible considering how edited the show is, but still, the show is Japanese. If you're a fan of the English dub, by all means, pick this up.",1408838400,4,236,4.642857142857143
6260489,3,B00IE6SV76,"DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR THE JAPANESE LANGUAGE. There is nothing Japanese about these DVDs except the drawings. There is no option at all to add Japanese subtitles or even to change to Japanese audio.

The quality of the show is great considering it came out during the VHS era, but everything is from the English dub.",1408492800,2,331,4.516666666666667
6260490,5,B00IE6SV76,I loved the original Beyblade series! I can't wait to add it to my growing dvd collection. I remember when I was a kid watching this and wish they'd still rerun this show but now that it's going to be on dvd I can watch it anytime I want.,1397520000,3,238,3.877551020408163

8641493,5,B00IE6SV76,i have always loved everything Beyblade. Well at least the original 3 seasons. I pray we get V-Force and G-Revolution soon too. Honestly the show deserves the Blu-ray treatment but all in all the package is great. No extras. Just the episodes and I am honestly okay with that.,1432425600,6,276,4.653061224489796
