Yes, it is a little Ed Woodsy, but I think that's a part of the enjoyment.  Callas was obviously used to the great melodrama of opera, and certainly Medea is a role with lots of sturm und drang.  But still, I was moved by her grief at being cast aside (does anyone in the world NOT know the story without it being outlined here???).  I recommend it to anyone interested in the history of film, so to speak.",1037664000,3,554,4.11214953271028

Otherwise, it is a stupid, poorly directed version of Euripides, not one of the best of those hairy old tales to begin with, and the horrid, annoying music will give you a headache (as Callas speaks so little, it is best to watch it with the mute button on).  Callas was somewhat enamored with Pasolini (she was always enamored with the wrong men and she was barking up the wrong tree with him), and he really wasn't able to turn her clumsy staggering around into a movie actress.

303659,4,6301007360,"I'm not much of a film critic, and to be perfectly honest I only watched the film because Maria Callas was in it.  I love her work in opera and was intrigued when I found out that she starred in this one film.  And for Callas, it is worthwhile - she gives an incredible performance, despite never singing a note and having minimal dialogue.  The film itself is unique in other regards - the pace is slow, and dialogue is kept to a minimum.  Visually, we are provided mainly with landscapes, profiles and facial expressions.  Aurally, we get a range of exotic world music.  In both ways, the movie is like a collage - the sets and the music clearly do not fully belong to the time period or the cultures depicted in the story, nor even do these elements necessarily combine harmoniously with each other.  So I do warn that this film is a challenge for the viewer; it's definitely not your standard Hollywood storytelling, but undeniably artful and interesting.  Recommended for those who have an appreciation for international film and art film.

The one complaint I have in this film is with the dubbing of the dialogue - I've read many places, that it was filmed in English, then dubbed in Italian, possibly by Callas herself and/or possibly by another actress.  The Amazon On Demand version is presented in Italian with English subtitles (which I don't mind), but while it sure sounds like Callas, I can't be certain.  I would be very interested to see the film with the original English restored, though that may be impossible.  Otherwise I wish it could be confirmed that Callas's own dubbing is presented.",1376524800,4,1610,4.670212765957447

This film gives the feel and atmosphere of the strong undercurrent of mental anguish and steel will of Medea--Diva Callas is also a superb actor.  It is a must have for those who love classical theatre.  I will be watching it again and couldn't recommend it more strongly.",1372291200,2,539,4.793478260869565
303682,2,6301007360,"Pier Paolo Pasolini (1922-1975) was an Italian filmmaker who more or less aligned himself with a film as non-art movement that was passingly fashionable among certain arts intelligentsia from about 1955 to about 1975.  His films usually show a mix of hand-held and static camera and have a slow pace punctuated with fits of male nudity, significant violence, and coarse humor; they also often have deliberately annoying soundtracks, a wave of noise.  Critics of the era were not particular kind; reassessing critics have not been particularly kind; and today Pasolini is probably better known for the mysterious circumstances of his death (he was murdered by being run over repeatedly with his own car) than for any of the films he made.

According to legend, Pasolini was on friendly terms with the great opera diva Maria Callas (1923-1977.)  Among Callas' noted roles was the lead in Luigi Cherubini's MEDEA, a fairly straight forward adaptation of the ancient Greek tragedy by Euripides.  By 1970, however, Callas' voice had failed, and when Pasolini suggested she play the role for him, it was as an actress instead of a singer.

The story is clearly drawn from Eurpides' MEDEA, but it is in a roundabout way.  The first fifteen minutes or so of the film is preoccupied with a centar, sometimes in hilariously bad costume and sometimes not, lecturing the young Jason on his history and future duties.  This then drifts into an argicultural fertility rite that involves the sacrifice of a young man, the dismemberment of his body, and the burial of his parts in various crop fields.  Precisely what any of this has to do with anything isn't clear, and it isn't until Medea (Callas) catches sight of Jason (Giuseppe Gentile) and decides to steal the golden fleece for him that the film begins to feel at all like the classic story of Medea that most people know.

Even then, it flits and fiddles.  Plot points are skipped, leading to significant confusion; a time loop is inserted, leading to even more significant confusion; and oddly, the climatic moment in which Medea murders her children is actually played in an almost throw-away fashion.  The soundtrack is typically noisy, but to no point, and the pace is slow, slow, slow.  The costumes are accidentally hilarious.  The whole thing looks rather like a band of hippies lost in Arabia, a mishmash of Jarman and Fellini rolled around in the sand.  The only thing that makes the film worth watching is Callas.  Her eyes are startling and her face is powerful, and everything about her makes you aware that this is indeed a great presence.  It is obvious that she is inexperienced as a film actress, but her presence is such that you wonder what would have happened if she had pursued other film projects.

The DVD comes with a trailer, which is almost as boring as the film itself, and the documentary CALLAS by Tony Palmer, which is interesting but lacks the depth one would like to see.  All things considered ... I say go out and buy some Callas recordings.

303683,2,6301007360,What is the point of having a diva not sing a single aria?  The photography was excellent and gave the right mood.  The story was somewhat garbled.,1368748800,,147,4.407407407407407
303684,5,6301007360,"Pasolini's ""Medea"" is for me the most fascinating, thought-provoking film about ""Ancient Times."" I want it to be more watched and pondered. Here are some considerations, quick notes.

Consider Medea as an archetype, an enabler of transformation, metamorphosis, very similar to the role played by John Wayne in some John Ford films, especially ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance"" and ""The Searchers"" -- she enabled the triumph of one kind of civilization over another, then understood there was scant place for her in that new world. Unlike the John Wayne characters however she decided on cruel revenge.

What world did she help vanquish? Call it earth-oriented, nature-worshipping and chthonian, heeding gods and demigods and spirits of forests and fields and harvests, Dionysian, often with a central role for a young vegetation god who dies and is reborn. Pasolini's deft depiction is probably more historically accurate than many will want to believe. The evidence suggests human sacrifice was practiced by many early agricultural societies, especially in the selection of a youth from a prominent, often ruling, family to be honored, perhaps for a year, as a divinity among mortals, but whose mission was fulfilled only when his sacred flesh and blood by sacrifice sanctified, revivified the community and harvests. This may have had its origin in the instinctual knowledge within perhaps most animals with cardiovascular and nervous systems and living in groups that when danger is sensed, when a relentless and recurrent predator stalks the perimeter, one must die for the rest to be saved.

What world did she empower, help create? Call it Apollinian, oriented toward the sky, the clear light of reason, rationality, seeking to transcend mere nature and superstition. Pasolini makes majestic use of Pisa's ""Field of Miracles"" to evoke this realm rising toward prominence in ancient Greece and again in late medieval Italy. A world which wants to be rid of the Medeas, the archaic sorceresses, sibyls, witches.

Like Jason, Pasolini spent much of his childhood among the gruff, coarser, simpler, mythical (especially to a child) folk of mountain glens and woodlands and marshland bays: in Friuli, northeastern Italy, considered remote and backward in the cosmopolitan circles where he later lived and excelled. Determined to not forget or reject (heeding the advice of the Centaur to Jason), he continued to write poetry in the Friuli dialect, which seemed archaic to friends; he also sought contact with that more primal world in the demimonde, the underbelly, of Rome; as his films show, he did not detach, divorce himself from that nether realm so resistant to cosmopolitan rationality of even the best intentions. Pasolini wanted to keep his inner Medea flourishing and in creative agon with his intellect. And he managed to recreate in his film the themes, tensions, poetic intuitions, agons of ancient tragedy.",1348444800,2,2922,5.263948497854077
303685,5,6301007360,"Long out of print, finally released and a beautiful film.  This is a European film, so American audiences take note. If you think Will Farrell is funny or Mark Wahlberg is an actor or Steven Spielberg makes interesting films, then this is probably not for you. It's slow, very slow, very very slow. There's almost no music to wake you up as you fall asleep in your popcorn.  There's very little violence to pump your adrenaline up and, unforgiveably, there's almost no blood.  There's no nudity and no sex. Again, it's a European film.
If you appreciate Bergman, Fellini, Antonioni, or Almodovar, you might like this one.
Aside from the fact that it's the only fiction film Callas ever made, it's a gem. Accompanying it is a beautiful documentary on Callas.",1332288000,4,757,4.763358778625954
303686,3,6301007360,"The movie, ""Medea"" with Maria Callas as the title role, is a strange, even bizarre, take on the legend. Callas is beautifully photographed when she is present. She doesn't even appear until a lot of odd things go on featuring barbarian ritual practices. She is finally shown, just standing there, observing. I found the story hard to follow - what was in her mind, and what actually happened. It was edited badly I thought. I am a movie fan, and a Callas admirer, but this certainly was not in a league with her operatic performances, due to what I would deem bad directing. I'm glad that I finally saw the movie, but can understand why it never did very well.",1326844800,,660,4.508333333333334
303687,4,6301007360,My copy repeats the scene where Medea gives Jason gifts to present to Glauce and then shows two differeent endings for Glauce. It  did not include the Tony Palmer documentary on Callas.  This seemed a bit strange since the official release for this DVD is 6 December.,1322352000,,267,4.659574468085107
303688,5,6301007360,"... including none of Pier Paolo Pasolini's other films! Pasolini was not interested in movie-making as an enterprise, or a career, and he never repeated himself. His ""Mamma Roma"", which I've reviewed just a few days ago, was his tribute to Italian Neo-Realismo, so perhaps we could label ""Medea"" as Neo-Irrealismo. Filmed in the late 1960s in Cappadocia (Turkey), Medea is a cinematic rival for James George Fraser's 'Golden Bough', a study that asserted the unity of all religious symbols and myths in the deepest history of Man's 'barbaric yawp'. Actually, I'd be surprised if Pasolini wasn't consciously aware of Fraser's work, which was at the height of its influence on poets and anthropologists during his lifetime. In any case, Pasolini assembled all the barbaric splendor of the eastern Mediterranean for this film; the costumes amount to a visual ethnographic museum, and many of them must have been what the villagers around Greme were actually still wearing when the Italian camermen arrived. The color quality of this film has deteriorated, even in restoration, but visually this is a spectacle beyond your wildest dreams. The human sacrifice scene at the beginning of Jason's visit to Medea's bizarre realm seems to me to draw on historical accounts of such sacrifice among the Aztecs at the time of the Conquest.

Likewise, Pasolini has compounded music from Iran, India, Japan, and who-knows-where into a soundtrack of truly barbaric intensity. A lot of the music I recognize now, though I surely didn't when I saw the film first decades ago. It's from the Japanese Bunraku puppet theater. Music is a big part of this film, equalling the visual splendors in affect. On the other hand, the script is sparse, almost minimal; minutes and whole scenes pass without a word. But don't suppose that the film is ""slow"". In fact, it's startling, gory, raucous throughout, every bit a real barbaric yawp.

The presence of the great Maria Callas, the most fiery opera diva of her era, gets a lot of notice from critics, but her acting skills, good as they were, were not essential. It was her very fame in the role of the opera Medea, by Cherubini, that justified her place in this cast in the role of Medea. Pasolini's films, believe me, are full of such cross-references and allusions. If you don't know the story of Jason and Medea well, you'll have trouble simply following the action of the film, with is elliptical and suggestive rather than forthrightly narrative. Read the story as told by Euripedes, see the opera by Cherubini, and thus you'll be enabled to grasp what Pasolini has modified for his own purpose.

Pasolini's purpose has elements of philosophical didacticism, concerning the 'transformation' of pre-modern religious humanity into modern post-religious humanity. But don't worry if that's an obscure thought; the Centaur who has raised Jason, and who has the largest speaking role in the film, will make it quite plain.

This is a stunning and unforgettable movie. If you saw it years ago, you'll see it differently now, with your greater stock of reference points. If you've never seen it, do so. You won't be bored.",1320364800,3,3145,4.984761904761905
303689,3,6301007360,"I first viewed MEDEA back in the 70's in an ""art house"" theatre. The audience was mainly composed of Callas fans--and if you're a Callas fan you're usually a fanatical Callas fan. Personally I was more interested in the original MEDEA by Euripides (absolutely butchered in the film) & had very little exposure to Maria Callas at the time. After watching her (non-musical) version of MEDEA, I joined the fanatics.

Certainly this film will not be everyone's cup of tea. It opens with Medea blessing the fields for a good harvest. A near naked, muscular beautiful young man is bound between 2 poles. He is in a high level of intoxication. Then a third pole is used to slowly break his neck. The body is chopped up and excited farmers of all ages & sexes rush to get body parts to plant in the fields for fertility. If you make it through this scene you'll probably stay to witness the rest--not that it's the only act of brutality in store.

To write that Callas is stunning in the role is an understatement. The only person who came close to this level of performance was Greek actress Melina Mercouri who performed the traditional version of MEDEA in the famous Amphitheatre in Athens. Both women bestowed a natural regal beauty & personal power to this most difficult role of a sorceress & princess who is betrayed & kills her own children as the ultimate act of revenge.

Director Passolini (who was eventually murdered in ""real"" life) sets his MEDEA in a strangely beautiful & mesmerizing world. Medea considers herself to be a descendant of the Sun God, and he speaks directly to her. Medea isn't insane, but she is obsessed with Jason, the man she has betrayed her country for. Jason's goal is to steal the fabled Golden Fleece & Medea helps him do it. She has enlisted her brother's aid in accomplishing the theft, and the trio flees in a chariot in order to reach Jason's waiting ship. Medea's father discovers the sacrilege (The Fleece was a sacred relic) & sets off in his chariot in order to overtake the thieves. To prevent her father from reaching them, Medea hacks her beloved brother  to pieces & tosses out his body one limb after another as an effective strategy to sidetrack the father & promote her escape with Jason.

No light entertainment here.

It's obvious that Passolini's MEDEA was a paen to Callas' commanding beauty. Unfortunately that gem is set in a very flawed ring. The other actors are more or less just props, they certainly can't act. They appear to be cataonic, unexciting.  Jason, whose masculine charms drove Medea mad, is scrawny & not particular handsome. To say he can't act is being kind. Maybe the idea was not to have anyone more beautiful than Callas?

Inexplicably, the major scene in which Medea sends garments to her rival is repeated twice. The first version is more or less how Euripedes wrote it: the princess puts on the clothes & bursts into flame; her father tries to put the fire out, but he too is seared with his daughters body. So far so good, but then Passolini repeats the exact scene. but without fire. All I could fathom from this was that the first scene was in Medea's mind, and the second...who knows? It really doesn't make any sense.

Finally--and most unforgivable--Passolini has a mishmash of musical genres performed by various actors. In one scene a Greek is singing a Japanese song (no kidding!), and in another a chorus of Greek women is singing an Albanian folk song circa the 20th century. There are 1 or 2 other instances of this musical mayhem. Again. it makes no sense.

MEDEA--may be only fully appreciated by theatre buffs, Greek literature & history enthusiasts and, of course, Callas fanatics. It is worth VIEWING once just to see The extraordinary beauty of Maria Callas.

PS. You can see snippets of Melina Mercouri's Medea in A DREAM OF PASSION with Ellen Burtsyn (who plays a modern day Medea).

303724,4,6301007360,"Previous reviewers have given much thought and details about the film that surpass what I could possibly say; instead, I wish only to share my reaction to this film.

It does not bother me that the dialogue is minimal. Anyone who really wants to know can read the original play, or listen to Callas' recordings of the operatic rendition by Cherubini.  What does bother me is why Callas was dubbed.  She knew Italian, and surely could have delivered the lines in a capable manner.  What was Pasolini's intent?

The landscapes that we see in this film are often breathtaking.  The land is harsh, often barren, but with a starkness and magnificence that beguile you.

I was also struck by how the characters moved, particularly the servantwomen, with their sudden running motions.  It certainly distances you from modern-day life, to see people act in this manner.

For the DVD release, they should have interviewed a film scholar, to shed light on Pasolini's technique and artistic choices.  Instead, we are just left with the film itself, without having our questions answered.

303727,5,6301007360,"I first saw Medea in college and was highly critical of it, finding it disappointing on almost all counts:  terrible sound editing, cheap film stock, over bright lighting, bizarre, amateurish acting styles, inadequately edited, etc. Then there was the extended murder scene of Glauce and Creon going seemingly on forever, and then . . . wait; what's this?  It's repeated all over again? Did someone get the wrong reel into the house?

Another ten years went by before I watched it again and after the second viewing, found myself emotionally drained, my jaw on the floor with the realization that I'd just finished a film that alternately horrified, fascinated and astonished me.

Medea is a grim, violent, film, minimally processed which only adds to its gruesome, wild rawness.  This is Pasolini's Medea, not Euripedes and it is not easy viewing.  Its wild, African/Middle Eastern score with the nasal bleating of women's voices in near pre-historic sounding rhythmic chant adds further to the element of being ""out there"" this film produces:  This is about as far away from popular cinema as one can get.  Medea doesn't easily compare to films of any other style or genre; not even with some of Pasolini's other work.  But, if you can succumb to its hypnotic, mesmerizing pace at once both frenetic and static - you will realize this is as about as close to a hallucinatory experience one can achieve without the use of an illegal substance. Granted, not everyone wants that experience.

As Medea, Callas is simply amazing.  Oddly, when the film came out she was roundly criticized for not being able to transfer the magic she so naturally gave on stage to the big screen.  I will strongly disagree.  The more I watch this film (which is probably several times a year for well over a decade), the more amazed I am by her performance in it.  Where I, too, had first been critical of her languid weirdness, I've grown to see her

commitment to the role.  I've come to be riveted to her painfully expressive mask as she completely inhabits this character who is, quite literally, capable of everything (yes - everything is the right word here).

Where I was once critical of the lighting, I've grown up to realize what Pasolini did; why he chose to film at the times of day he chose, and the resulting, fascinatingly brutal and surreal luminosity that bathes the entire film and the almost palpable sense of its visual texture. Stunning.  The landscapes Pasolini chose to film in are as brutal and as vital as the characters of the tale.  His near excision of all spoken text (  the screenplay is nearly dialogue free) brings us into a timeless, yet somehow ancient world where all is understood without the use of verbal communication.  The savage, bloody rites of sacrifices for fertility and harvest initially seem barbarous then become somehow beautiful and fascinating.  Then they make one cringe with the realization of how, not so long ago, this was us.

A remarkable, savage and beautiful film.",1095638400,77,3002,4.8317025440313115
303728,5,6301007360,"Just as Pasolini said,""I draw on the mysterious sensibilities in Maria Callas"". He finds Callas to be ""an ancient woman"" in the sense that she is directly linked to myth and legend. With very little spoken word Callas manages to convey all the pride, rage, and black art that comprises the legend of Medea. Set against an incredibly dramatic backdrop the viewer is nearly hypnotized by this savage story of lust and power.
To the reviewer who thought that the repeated scene of the death of the king and his daughter was a technical error, watch it carefully again. Medea dreams the act of revenge first, then sets it into motion and the dream becomes reality. This is in all the films of this I have seen. It is not a mistake.",1075075200,16,727,4.515151515151516

303730,4,6301007360,"Pasolini fans have been struggling with low-quality DVD's since the advent of the format, and Medea is no exception.  This disc, put out by Vanguard, is certainly a step above the Wellspring and Image Pasolini DVD's, but that really isn't saying much.  The transfer is fairly dirty and washed-out, and the sound is very hissy.  The punctuation in the subtitles is abominable. That being said, they are actually quite easy to read.
The film itself is good, although it doesn't reach the heights of Pasolini's earlier Oedipus Rex.  The film is very slow, lacking a great deal of dialogue, until it explodes at the very end.  It's a little convaluted, and I highly advise reading a summary of the story before delving into the film.
While Medea isn't Pasolini's best film, it's certainly not his worst DVD.  Worth a rental, at least.",1060646400,11,830,4.809859154929577
303731,5,6301007360,"Pasolini has the dubious distinction of being the only great filmmaker who was murdered, possibly at the behest of a right-wing faction which loathed the openly gay, Marxist, atheist - and popular - artist. Whatever the facts of his death, his reputation as one of Italy's greatest talents is based securely on his poetry, novels, works of critical theory and, in particular, the 25 films he directed. They include such stylistically diverse works as Accatone (1961; adapted from his own novel about life in the slums of modern Rome), The Gospel According to Matthew (1964; a beautiful, moving film about Christ), a stunning version of the Arabian Nights (1974), and his last film, the most nauseating masterpiece I have ever seen, Sal (1975; the Marquis de Sade's 1780s novel updated to Mussolini's Fascist Italy). But Pasolini's most underrated film is his startling version of Medea (1969). Its recent release on DVD (from Vanguard-Cinema) makes this is an opportune time to revisit the ultimate incarnation of the adage, Hell has no fury like a woman scorned.
Pasolini takes a unique approach to Medea. He jettisons all but a few lines of Euripides, and begins the narrative many years before the action of the play. Most strikingly, he shoots almost the entire film in a documentary-like style. And, with a couple of notable exceptions, he creates a picture with almost no dialogue, although the soundtrack features an astonishing musical score (put together by Pasolini) of native North African wind and percussion music (20 years before Peter Gabriel's score for Scorsese's The Last Temptation of Christ, which was clearly inspired by Pasolini). If that was not enough to offend purists, in the title role he cast perhaps the most famous opera diva of the century, Maria Callas, in her only film appearance, and then gave her almost no lines (and the few she had were dubbed). Perhaps if audiences had known a bit more about what to expect from the film, they would have seen what was on the screen, instead of what Pasolini consciously - and often brilliantly - stripped away from his sources.
He opens with a witty prologue in which an unforgettable Centaur lectures baby Jason about his mythical lineage. So many gods and goddesses are mentioned in this breathless monologue, that the overwhelmed kid falls over backwards, sound asleep. (There is perhaps as much dialogue in these first three minutes as in the rest of the film.) Then Pasolini plunges us into Medea's world. In one of the film's most astonishing sequences, we witness, and feel, every moment of the ritual sacrifice of a young man, whose blood the people of Colchis smear over the plants and trees, to ensure the continued fertility of their land. Pasolini's artistry makes this event as poetic and authentic (indigenous North Africans, not extras from Central Casting, enact the Colchians) as it is gruesome. You may have read about such ancient rites in anthropology, but Pasolini depicts it unflinchingly. And he shows us, in visceral terms, exactly what kind of world produced Medea, whose revenge will be enacted years later on her faithless husband.
Throughout, Pasolini invests every shot with a haunting, ripely sensuous look, almost always grounded in a cinma vrit style. The film literally glows like burnished bronze, with many shots done at the ""magic hour,"" just before sunset, which naturally provides an orange/gold sheen. The major stylistic exception is the scenes in the court of King Creon (played by Massimo Girotti, star of Visconti's 1941 film Ossessione), where Pasolini drolly mimics Eisenstein's expressionistic designs from that masterpiece of political intrigue, Ivan the Terrible (1943-1946).
Much of Medea's enormous power comes from the naturalistic performances, ranging from the leads to the many minor characters. This is what the Argonauts might really have been like, a group of mostly quiet young men, doing their jobs, enjoying the thrill of battle when the opportunity arises, and gawking at the strange sights of Colchis's radically foreign culture. Giuseppe Gentile creates a complex Jason whom we believe a powerful woman like Medea could fall passionately in love with, who is devoted to his children, yet who is so fickle, not to mention hungry for power, that he would throw over his wife of 10 years to marry the daughter of his enemy, King Creon, as a backhanded way of regaining his throne.
Pasolini draws a monumental performance from Maria Callas, who uses her few lines of dialogue to great effect. Simply by using her face and body, Callas suggests - with a subtlety unexpected from an opera diva - Medea's immense range of emotions, from heartbreaking tenderness to volcanic rage.
Perhaps the best way to enjoy Pasolini's Medea is to put aside thoughts of Euripides, and later versions by such dramatists as Seneca, Pierre Corneille, and Jean Anouilh, not to mention Hollywood extravaganzas like Jason and the Argonauts (whether the fun 1963 version, with Ray Harryhausen's special effects wizardry, or the bland TV mini-series from 2000). Experience Pasolini's mesmerizing film on its own starkly beautiful terms, and you will find a unique vision not only of the ancient Mediterranean, recreated with what feels like astonishing fidelity, but of the tortured interplay of love, desire, and unspeakable revenge, which can be as current as the latest crime of passion.",1041292800,98,5397,5.113250283125708

The film is watchable, with patience, but unlike many so-called art-films, the patience is rewarded immediately. The scenes alternate between tedium and action, awkwardness and certainty, which works like an investment that promises a high return. Pasolini's ""return"" is the connections between ancient myth and contemporary relevance.

7808778,5,6301007360,"Maria Callas, Prima Donna of the Century, appeared for the last time on the opera stage in 1965, at the age of forty-one.  Renown as a singing-actress, she was often approached by film producers and directors, hoping to interest her in the cinema.

Various sources indicate possibilities such as ""The Guns of Navarone"" (1961, Irene Papas took the role of Maria Pappadimos), portraying Maria Jeritza in a biographical film of Giacomo Puccini (directed by Luchino Visconti), Sarah in John Huston's ""The Bible...In The Beginning"" (1966, Ava Gardner portrayed the heroine), ""Boom!"" (1968, apr&egrave;s Tennessee Williams, directed by Joseph Losey; Dame Elizabeth Taylor portrayed the part of Flora ""Sissy"" Goforth), even a proposed version of Mother Courage.  Perhaps most intriguing was ""The Greatest Story Ever Told"" (1965), with the producers proposing La Callas as St Mary Magdalene and her dear friend Princess Grace of Monaco as the Blessed Virgin Mary.  Additionally, Franco Zeffirelli attempted to make a film of the soprano in Puccini's ""Tosca,"" with the soundtrack being her 1964 recording for EMI.  (According to Musical America at the time, even screen-tests were made with Callas and Tito Gobbi; if so, they have not surfaced.)

None of these came to fruition, of course.  When Mme Callas finally signed a contract for a film, it took many by surprise.  Pier Paolo Pasolini, even then a controversial figure in the Fine Arts, was to direct her in a film entitled ""Medea,"" first seen in 1969.  Luigi Cherubini's ""M&eacute;d&eacute;e"" (in the corrupt Italian version) had been one of her great assumptions in the theatre, and the Colchian sorceress long held a fascination for her.  However, Pasolini granted more than one interview to insist his film was not of Euripides (pace the box of the current edition) or of  Cherubini, but of the ancient myth of Medea, the woman who slaughters her children to aggrieve their father.

Many opera buffs have proven, from the premi&egrave;re until today, that they would have much preferred Callas to have appeared in an easily-digestible bon-bon by Zeffirelli, etc.  Pasolini's film, an extreme example of the Neorealismo movement, is dry, turgid, non-narrative, and seemingly cinematically primitive by later standards, especially regarding the heavy-handed dubbing so beloved by the Italian cinema of the time.  The soundtrack consists of a disturbing m&eacute;lange of pseudo-prehistoric sounds.  Callas not only does not sing (though apparently one or two songs were recorded), according to some sources it is not even of her speaking voice.  One can see her august lips reciting dialogue in English, while we hear the dubbed Italian!

It was, nevertheless, Callas's fiat that had her go forth with the project.  She had seen Pasolini's work and read his ethereal poetry.  She was not an intellectual, but she was very sophisticated, and knew this was not going to be a Hollywood ""hit.""  Instead, this film is imbued with mystery and a quiet terror.  Callas is here the epitome of exotic beauty, she moves with extraordinary grace, and her mystique is not lost on the camera.  To say the least, the project, imbued with the remarkable intellect of Pasolini, is well worth one's effort.

Pasolini's 1964 film, ""Il vangelo secondo Matteo,"" was recently named by L'Osservatore Romano as ""the best film about Jesus ever made in the history of cinema,"" and had been dedicated by the atheist-Marxist director to Pope St John XXIII.  His films following ""Medea,"" culminating in ""Sal&ograve; o le 120 giornate di Sodoma"" (concerning Italy following the fall of Benito Mussolini), are indisputably some of the most shocking films in history.  Pasolini, who was brutally murdered in 1975, will long be a highly disputatious artist, but one who must be taken seriously, as difficult as is that proposition.

Much further research needs be done regarding this ""Medea.""  Does the English version still exist?  Are the recordings of the songs sung by Callas extant?  The production of this troubling enterprise are some of the most obscure pages in the tumultuous life of Maria Callas.",1452384000,2,4124,5.187311178247734

Or if you search, you can  probably find it in Greek,  There was never a production of it in English,  This bordered on the absurd since I remember that the film had premiered in  Greece, where it was performed in Greek and then in Rome where it was performed in Italian.  There was a big discussion among the producers over which version should be shown in London and New York for English speaking audiences.  Italian won  out, since the Star, a former opera singer, had always sung the opera in  Italian.  The production is rendered more senseless since the film was originally intended for England and New York and the Medea was an American who naturally spoke English.
Now Amazon offers two filmed DVD's of the play., one in Italian and the  other in Danish. Neither will be well received by students or  people who have no patience for reading subtitles.
What use are these productions to a High  school or college students studying theater or ancient History?  Or to adults wanting to  introduce the play to their youngsters?  Won't somebody offer a Medea in English and with  subtitles so that this masterpiece will stay in the public memory!!!
