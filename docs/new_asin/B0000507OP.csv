7928740,1,B0000507OP,"I am a HUGE Maggie Cheung fan and this film has been for years somehow escaping my viewing, so when I at long last saw it just recently I seriously could have kept waiting.

There is absolutely no chemistry between Cheung and Leon in this film and the characters are so one dimensional you cant relate and you really don't care either!  Cheung's character was a TERRIBLE mother who in fact left her child with a friend so she could move in with this rich computer genius in their shallow sexually driven relationship.  Their is NO romance in this film and it is weak all around.

If you are a fan of Cheung's I say skip it.  It is a blemish on her great career.  Actually even if you are not a fan of Cheung's I say skip it!

Awful film and in no way is this a romantic or enjoyable film.",1274486400,,788,4.144736842105263

7928742,3,B0000507OP,"Maggie Cheung and Leon Lai reunite in a romantic melodrama set in San Francisco after the 1996 internationally-acclaimed *Comrades: Almost a Love  Story*. Ellen (Maggie Cheung) is a single-mom who drives taxi by the day and does expressionist art by night. After hitting off with Mike, an internet guru, in a one-night affair, Ellen finds herself irresistably falls in love with him. Things don't turn out at Ellen has anticipated. The last thing Mike ever wants is to take responsibility for a relationship as if committment curses him off. Mike continues on with flippancy, casual encounters with the swingers. Heartbroken and disappointed, Ellen broke up with Mike and a series of quirky events afterwards lead to a twist in their relationship. The entire film was filmed in San Francsico with clips in Sausalito to suit the taste of American audience. Afterwall cinematography is exquisite. The course of the movie is nothing more than a smooth plot with no surprses. Overall *Sausalito* will not capture your breath like *Comrades* might have. The predecessor might seem to be more meticulously done. *Sausalito* is rather relaxing and deviating from the usual Hong Kong sappy drama. Must have all Maggie Cheung like myself; rental material for those who just want a comfy flick. 37/50. 3.7 stars.",1044057600,4,1302,5.1415094339622645
7928743,5,B0000507OP,"Maggie and Leon back again! and the outcome is simply great/ amazing/ irresistable.
Maggie Cheung plays Ellen, a single mother who drives a cab by day and paints expressionistic artwork by night. One night she falls into a one-night stand with Mike (Leon Lai), an Internet mogul who needs to grow up in a big way. You see, he's one of those guys who doesn't like women leaving stuff at his place, and prefers distance and casual sex to intimacy and commitment. Still, Ellen challenges him as he feels he may have found the person who he wants to be with. Ellen isn't so sure. She is a single mother, after all, and she has no time for games in her life.
Seriously, people do not give Andrew Lau credits for being such a good cinematographer.( he's really good at filming, i think he should just be a cinematographer from now on, can you imagine him just filming instead of directing those horrible movies aka Wesley's file). Maggie Cheung is another goodie from this movie. Her presence is so strong and memorable. The emotions and depth she brings to this film is so GOOOODDDD, jeez no wonder she's praised from critics all over the world. Leon's performance was farely well, not as good as Maggie, i think her presence was so big that his performance was shaded/covered by hers.
But trust me, this is not a PERFECT film, but i happen to like the works of Maggie Cheung. and after this movie, i have some respect for Andrew Lau as a cinematographer",1032220800,7,1449,4.534351145038168
7928744,4,B0000507OP,"A beautifully photographed and nicely paced romantic comedy, 'Sausalito' stars the gorgeous Maggie Cheung as Ellen who comes to San Francisco where she meets and quickly falls for Mike, played by Leon Lai. They're satisfyingly perfect together-the kind of couple made for romantic comedies... except for their COMPLETELY different personalities.  This is what eventually tears them apart and makes them mope around Friso(which never looked so lush thanks to the postcard perfect cinematography) until a series of quirky events including a small miracle and even a minor earthquake send them darting for each other again in a moment that made me cry out ""YES!"" in a way I haven't since Mikey hung up on his ex in 'Swingers'... This film doesn't feel very HK either, the acting, the Frisco setting and contemporary dialogue make it feel like director Andrew Lau almost tailor-made 'Sausalito' for an American audience despite the Cantonese language track (Never fear- English subtitles are here). Maggie Cheung is fantastic and drop-dead gorgeous as always and Leon Lai is actually quite funny.  They are simply wonderful together. Fans of either actor, and fans of romantic comedy (and San Francisco) should definitely check this one out.",984009600,6,1237,5.274111675126903
