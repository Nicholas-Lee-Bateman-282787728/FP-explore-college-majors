5111461,1,B007VH6HPM,"So completely crude I could not watch it through. Despicable characters. I really could not stomach this movie. Just one nasty scene after the next.  The only person you feel for is the poor little kid. Didn't find it funny in the least. Maybe some people will find solace in it, or maybe some respond with a different attitude toward it. For me, I am sensitive and it was just not for me. Remember, this is my personal opinion.",1353110400,3,428,4.417721518987341
5111462,4,B007VH6HPM,"Even though the front cover of this film says it, it was NOT the funniest film of the year BUT it was one of the most memorable.  I love watching a foreign movie whenever American cinema begins to bore me.  What this movie lacks in working comedy it more than makes up for in its ability to shock and surprise you.  You want to laugh at so much of this film but so much is so risque compared to what american audiences are used to that all you can do is smile (if you can handle the adult euro humor) and wait to see what this film pulls off next.  The characters seem awkward at first but they do grow on you.  The story is not necessarily new ground (think Big Daddy mixed with some About a Boy).  In short, this film will not bore you, and it is daring in it's approach to make you smile if not laugh.  Either way it will definitely be one people will talk about.... if they ever see it. ;)",1353024000,,893,4.011299435028248
5111463,4,B007VH6HPM,I'm a huge Scandinavian film fan. This one is irreverant and may offend some. Lots of crude humor and inappropriate adult activity. What fun!,1352764800,,141,4.916666666666667
5111464,5,B007VH6HPM,This is the film version of the hugely popular  TV series in the Netherlands. It is unlikely you will ever see a funnier film in your life. It is very crude and touches on taboo subjects and nudity a lot but  all in  good fun. This is a laugh aloud and hysterically funny comedy. If only American screenplay writers could write comedy as brilliant as this film has. The final scene in the film is perhaps the funniest  scene of all time in  a comedy. Let us hope that the 2 season tv series will emerge on  bluray also in the future. I will NEVER forget the film's  finale - a true hysterically funny classic.,1346198400,3,609,4.243478260869566

5111466,5,B007VH6HPM,"There are several funny movies made in 2012. From a handful I have watched, this one is on Top for laugh-out-loud fun and entertainment throughout. Frank Hvam, a comedian, plays the role of a guy who wants to prove that he could be a good father to his pregnant girlfriend. In order to prove his fatherhood challenge, he decides to kidnap a child to impress his girlfriend that he has good fatherhood potential. Trying not to give away too many Spoilers here. The two of them venture out through the Danish countryside, not conforming to the standards of society. Their friendship is not the normal, and the young boy has a mind of his own with weird sexual encounters. They run around as if they own the world, and trouble is waiting. Some raunchy moments, but many very funny moments. A Good comedy, Acting Performance Superb, and a Great summer movie to get a few laughs. Highly Recommended!",1343347200,7,894,4.6645569620253164

I don't want to see it unblurred, and it makes no practical difference, since the nature of the scene is obvious; but for anyone who wants to know whether they are receiving uncensored or censored products, the listing on Amazon should be corrected.

5111492,3,B007VH6HPM,"As I expected the humor is based on the dumb choices of the main character, which is not my favorite style of humor. Actually in this case the dumb choices are shared by the main character and his friend who has planned an adult only canoe trip and is not happy with the main character brings along a twelve year old boy, nor does he have any intention of changing the adult nature of his planned trip. Shortly into the movie the bad choices can pretty much be predicted, whenever the situation is setup for one of these main characters to make a bad choice you can be sure he will make it. The American comparison that comes to my mind is ""Dumb and Dumber"", Frank and Casper are not quite as dumb as Lloyd and Harry but make choices that are just as dumb.",1433980800,,756,4.220689655172414

To enjoy this movie, you will need to be ok with laughing at a child's expense and also at some sexist humor, however, if you pay any attention it is obvious that the intent of the film isn't to promote sexist behavior but rather to make fun of it. All that said, this movie is not politically correct and not for everyone.

5111502,4,B007VH6HPM,"There are many reasons people laugh. One of them is nervousness. That's the kind of laughter you will experience while watching this movie.

Here's the scoop. Frank is about to embark on a canoeing trip with his bud Casper which will culminate at a rock concert and a trip to a very exclusive house of ill repute. But just prior to cast-off he finds out his Girlfriend is pregnant and he must bring a friend's young son in tow. Can Frank step up to the plate in the fatherhood department? Not looking good for our buddy Frank.

This is some way raunchy stuff. Frank is spineless and cannot see himself as a father. Casper is married but wants this trip to score some big-time womanhood. They manage to screw up one thing after another because of their stupidity and selfishness. They do things that make you so uncomfortable you will find yourself turning away. But these same things are hilarious. That two grown men would behave in such a manner boggles the mind.

This Danish outing is not all that fancy. It's plainly shot with a lot of natural lighting. But the camera is framed well and things move well within the frame. What's happening here is the writing. These characters and situations have to be seen to be believed. But the writers manage one catastrophe after another. And, as raunchy as their wit is, it's there in bucketfulls.

5111517,5,B007VH6HPM,"I saw this at a film fest that was packed about 50-50 with women and men. The women laughed uproariously.

The milieu of the film is extremely sexist. Prudes need to remember that Klown presents a comic view in which the moral order provides basic justice for the most sexist characters. The main character is a lovable dork, who is basically a good guy and loving partner. The dvd includes a very funny episode from the tv show and is directed by Lars Von Trier. That might re-enforce the belief that Klown is mysogynistic but in reality Mr. Von Trier's episode is extremely funny.

Very Larry Davidesque.",1379462400,2,606,4.654205607476635
5111518,5,B007VH6HPM,Danish humor(Frank and Casper) at its best. I hope they come out with another full length movie. The series is on Netflix .,1379376000,,123,4.391304347826087
5111519,5,B007VH6HPM,"Turns out Larry David is not socially inept, he's Danish. There is an uncanny resemblance between Frank Hvam and Larry and if you enjoyed Curb Your Enthusiasm, you'll like this movie.

The big surprise is that it's from Denmark.  Now don't get me wrong. I have nothing but admiration for the Danes. In fact all Scandinavians rank high with me. Just look how well they run their own countries. We should look to them for guidance. Even the food isn't bad, except for the lutefisk. It's just that, until now, I was under the impression that Scandinavians lacked the humor gene.  This was not an idle assumption; it was based on the jokes I was told by people from that part of the world. First, a Danish Joke: ""We call hamburgers 'russian elevator operators' in denmark. Because they are minced meat as you will be if you let one operate an elevator. Hahahahahahaha.""  No, I'm not kidding. And the teller was an adult. Really.

Okay, get ready for the second joke. It was told to me by someone from Sweden.  ""Oh I am so sad, my cousin is dead.""  ""What happened?""  ""He shot himself."" ""Oh no, why?""  ""Because his wife served roast pork and red cabbage for dinner.""  ""That is no reason to kill youself!""  ""But he had it for lunch.""

See.  So when I watched Klown, I was not expecting much, which made the laughs all the more surprising. This is a very funny movie. In a very basic, stupid, gross, raunchy way.

There is also a Danish TV series called Klown and the film is obviously a spinoff.  Watch both. The sitcom came first. According to an interview with Frankie Hvam(co-star, co-creator and Larry Davidsen clone, he and his partner Casper Christiansen made a list of the 20 most serious social taboos...cannibalism, Down Syndrome, death, physical handicaps, pedophelia, cancer -- the usual suspects -- and devoted one episode to exploiting each. What's not to love?

For the movie, Hvam and Christiansen use the premise of impending fatherhood to find new, funny and really upsetting ways to poke fun at these and other sensitive social issues. Here's the synopsis in brief: Frankie's girlfriend is pregnant and she fears he is not good father material. Boy howdy. Naturally Frankie wants to prove her wrong, so he and buddy Casper do the only reasonable thing: kidnap her thirteen year old nephew and take him on a canoe trip.

Okay. Yeah it's nuts, but it's not the stupidest thing two adults have ever done, right?  Wrong. This is not just a canoe trip. It is a Denmark wide spree of sexual debauchery, drinking and bad behavior that makes American Pie and Weekend At Bernies look like studies by Margaret Mead. Frankie and Casper are going to have one last fling before settling down and the presence of the kid isn't going to stop them.  The kid, by the way, is brilliant. Hulking, sulking and bulking. Typical 13 year old lout, but (and again, it's part of the movie's inexplicable charm), likable.  Somehow they manage to make it all funny...the kind of funny that sneaks up on you in your outrage and makes you laugh out loud in spite of yourself. It's smart dumb humor that offends and delights simultaneously.

The film is available on Amazon, the TV series on Hulu. If you enjoy broad humor that is not just broad, but actually fresh and funny and takes no prisoners, you'll enjoy both.

I guess now that the Scandinavians have demonstrated they do, indeed, understand the meaning of funny, the Swiss are now, officially, the only people so utterly devoid of humor, they look to Iceland as the comedy center of the Universe. Here are some examples of Swiss kneeslappers. They were painstakingly researched from Swiss internet sites and the one person I know who comes from that place. You tell me if I'm being unfair:

In the year 2200, Switzerland will try to join the rest of the civillized world and tentatively try to open a store on Sundays as well. But first there must be a referendum.

Woman: ""A cow died so you could eat that hamburger.""
Man:  ""Next time I will not leave witnesses.""

Teacher: ""Who was the first man?""
Student: ""William Tell.""
Teacher: ""That is incorrect. It was Adam.""
Student: ""You didn't say to include foreigners.""",1374796800,3,4157,4.683631361760661
5111520,5,B007VH6HPM,I have never laughed so hard...but I have a warped sense of humor.. this is not a movie for families or uptight religious types..,1372118400,2,129,4.416666666666667
5111521,4,B007VH6HPM,"There is something truly appalling about this movie, and yet it is truly hilarious so I guess those two factors balance each other out.  I mean, the extreme nature of the comedy here is something that cannot be shaken.  From giving his mother-in-law a pearl necklace (don't Google that) to making fun of a young boy's anatomy, this film is full of some of the most obnoxious and explicit moments of `adult' comedy I've seen in a film.  I know that I should be repulsed, but I don't think I stopped laughing once.  It's extreme, but that's the point of it all.  It holds fast to this awkward sense of honesty and so it never feels like it's too much.  To be honest, it kind of all works.

The film, apparently inspired by a television show of the same name, follows two lovable fools who are far too immature for their own good.  Frank's girlfriend is pregnant and he's trying to prove to her that he's responsible, but his lack of good judgment leads to some pretty awful results and he winds up kidnapping her nephew in order to prove to her that he can take care of a kid.  He takes the boy, Bo, on a `guys weekend' with his buddy Casper, who is not happy about the extra passenger because he feels like it will dampen his chances at getting laid.  Traveling by canoe, the two chase High School girls down a river in pursuit of a famed brothel that Casper thinks he can get into.  Along the way, Frank grows up (sort of) and Casper shows his true colors (sort of).

The finale pretty much sums up the whole movie; disturbing and repulsive and yet you can't look away or stop laughing long enough to turn the movie off.",1366070400,,1620,4.327814569536423

It is also one of the most raunchy comedies I own, and when I watch it I think ""How can they get away with showing this?"" But it turns out to be a very heartfelt character study--we see the main character Frank realize he has potential for fatherhood. It was also interesting to learn that ""Klovn"" is based on a popular Danish tv series. I would love to see it aired or adapted for the United States.
