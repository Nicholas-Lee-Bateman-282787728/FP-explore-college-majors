8040556,2,B00069CUTE,"actor Kenneth hughes says this is a terrific film.  he's the star.  I guess he had fun making the film, but never watched it.  it's disjointed and annoying from the noisy opening credits.  the film is not original so there are many other films like this that are better.  I did not see or hear the closing credits so I have no opinion.  I jumped off after 30 min. or so. but, you might like it.  I thought I would.",1517270400,,414,4.1
8040557,5,B00069CUTE,"I am in this as the lead actor so I am as unbiased as any political candidate you ever knew (NONE!). But it was my first lead role in a feature film and a great experience. I am soooo damn amazing. Sure there are hundreds of people that make a movie great or bad but being incredibly self indulgent I will pretend I am the only thing that matters to making this movie...SO...where were we? Oh yea! I am soooo good in this movie! Serious moment...It was a lot of fun and the people involved became life Long friends. Shot all over Santa Monica, California. This is a 11 Star movie!!! But they only go up to 5.",1507939200,,608,4.161016949152542
8040558,1,B00069CUTE,Think this is a dvd of the ocean calming ocean waves? Guess again. You get the sound of the ocean but no visuals....just amateurish out-of focus moving blobs of color. A waste of time and money,1193270400,,193,4.388888888888889
8040559,4,B00069CUTE,"I didn't think much of small direct to dvd films.  I thought this would be a cheap student film but I was suprised.  The acting was very good, the story was entertaining and being filmed in ditigtal excellent picture quality. It was better than the usual small buget film and this one does have a unique plot. The acting was excellent all the way around.  Miss Wilson had the difficult task of playing twins, which she pulls off.  This movie proves her to be a very under rated actress, needing more attention in Hollywood.  Mr Arube, very hot actor, who can play slimy very well.

All around a good film to watch.",1128816000,3,614,4.4375
8040560,5,B00069CUTE,"I love this movie.  It was such an adventure of twists and turns that it kept me glued to the screen the whole time.  The acting performances were great, especially the talented and sexy Kenneth Hughes.  Very well written and directed and felt close to home as I live in Los Angeles.",1118361600,2,283,4.403846153846154
