8479417,5,B005MJVN9Q,I LOVE this DVD...the playing by the orchestra is top notch and the conducting by Seiji Ozawa is a joy to watch...what a revelation to watch how he conducts and puts his whole body and face into it. I never get tired of watching this DVD and the bonus features with the horses are another miracle...the camera work throughout is fantastic...plus great sound reproduction. This DVD has my highest rating!!,1377734400,,404,4.785714285714286
