Outstanding  corps (especially Fille), and Jose Martin as Mercutio nearly steals the show in R&J.  I really love the Royal Ballet filmed ballets, details like shots of the orchestra, audience and curtain gives you a satisfying (substitute) taste of attending an event at the Royal Opera House. R&J had some interesting camera angles that put you in the crowd and makes it like a movie, which was initially surprising, but cool. I haven't watched Don Q, yet, but I'm sure I won't be disappointed. Great DVD set and for a good price. I only wish they printed the synopsis for Fille mal gardee in the booklet.",1508716800,,750,4.631578947368421
