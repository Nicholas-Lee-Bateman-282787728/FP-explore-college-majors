The one I purchased was $5.00, quite a good deal I'd say! I don't see paying nearly $100, for this.",1503360000,,245,4.3478260869565215
8270332,4,B0018ODXWE,"Running time for the 276 spots (and extras) on ST. CLAIR's CLASSIC TV COMMERCIALS is five hours. The three single side-recorded DVDs include bonus features that are typical of this manufacturer. Commercials are for products that fed our wants and addictions 30, 40 and 50 years ago (like suds, smokes and wheels).

For Boomers and Seniors who had their rabbit ears on back in TV's Golden Age, the spots in this set are certain to bring back fond memories, and for younger folks these will be an eye-opener (yes, in the old days they used to hawk cigars and cigarettes on TV... A LOT, in fact!). For everyone, these long ago ads are a good illustration of how Madison Avenue once created and shaped our cravings and perceived needs.

(NOTE: The St. Clair logo flashes on-screen briefly and infrequently on all discs.)
