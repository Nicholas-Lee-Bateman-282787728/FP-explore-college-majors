I've been so inspired by this movie - inspired to look at my fears, to live in  present moments, and to have fun.",944784000,2,258,4.333333333333333
106173,5,0790740281,"I have always been an Albert Brooks fan (remember him in Taxi Driver?). This is my favorite film by the actor/director/writer.  Intelligent, witty and profound, I've seen DYL about Twenty times and enjoy it every time.  Torn, Grant and Streep also turn in excellent performances.  Watch this and  hope you don't have regrets when its your time to go!",938649600,,350,4.88135593220339
106174,4,0790740281,"Meryl Streep and Albert Brooks as love interests? Preposterous! That's the whole point. As Streep personifies perfection, wit and poise, Brooks exemplifies tom-foolery. But wait!..they are dead! There's nothing more  pitiful than reviewing your life and finding out you missed out (through  luck or choice) on some crucial junctures. Let's face it, we're not all  born to be Albert Schweitzers. So, loosen up, enjoy and live! Watch this  any time you are feeling low or lonely.",917222400,,477,5.2368421052631575

106220,5,0790740281,"An excellent movie for people of all ages. It will likely be appreciated more by those who are a little older. I first saw it in 1992 at the age of 12 and I loved it. It helped that the main character has the same name as me. It took me years before I realized the irony in his name being ""Daniel"". The irony is that the name means ""God is my Judge"".

Hopefully we get a release on Blu-Ray at some point. I love this movie ever since I first saw it on HBO and to this day it is still a favorite of mine.

If you like this film make sure and check out some of Albert Brooks other movies.

It's too bad he wasn't able to play the Burt Reynolds character in Boogie Nights. He was the first pick, but had prior contractual obligations. That being said Burt Reynolds did a fabulous job. I'd just like to see what Brooks would have done with the role.",1518652800,,845,3.9881656804733727
106221,5,0790740281,"Definitely one of my all time favorite movies.  I was surprised to see this classified in other reviews as a rom-com.  Funny, I never considered it that way.  To me, it is a spiritual movie, a funny and touching explanation of just what might be happening in the time between lives.  I don't think that anyone things that these quasi-reality scenes represent actual afterlife events, but they do give one concepts that are worth considering.  Some of my favorite parts are the food--""and you can eat all you want!"", the Disney-like ""Past Lives Pavilion"" with the Shirley MacLean cameo, and the way that love changed Daniel from a total schmuck to a hero, ready to move on in the Universe.  LOVED it!",1518652800,,699,4.688524590163935
106222,5,0790740281,"Not usually into ""chick flicks"" (They generally insult my intelligence and I end up feeling ashamed that I turned it on!)but this one is written exceptionally well. It has deep meaning under the surface, but is also humorous. All in all, my favorite rom-com, and that says a lot, considering its not my go-to genre.",1518566400,,315,4.745454545454545

106224,5,0790740281,This film is under-rated.  We use it to talk to people about the idea of the afterlife being different than what the dominant religious institutions would have us believe.  Not to be taken too seriously or literally (it is a rom-com after all) it's a fun romp through the veil to what may lie beyond.,1518480000,,300,4.4363636363636365

106252,5,0790740281,"Brooks best direction to date (which is saying something after the brilliant Lost in America) and one of his best roles. (His vindictive turn in Broadcast News may be a bit better.) He gets amazing naturalistic performances out of principals Streep and Torn and sprightly ones out of even lesser players like Buck Henry. As writer, he gives us a strange but familiar world that is instantly fascinating and approachable. (I kept wanting to insert myself into the movie and ask questions about it.) And while the ending is rather conventional, it works, damn it, and I was surprised to find myself wiping away tears.",1514592000,2,615,4.866666666666666

I thought it was a little expensive to be such an old movie but I wanted it in my collection and bought it anyway. (it really wasn't expensive, just more than the free Amazon Prime offers :)

106271,5,0790740281,One of the greatest movies made to substitute once a year for your book club.  Give your fellow book clubbers a break from reading and watch this instead.  The conversations that ensue are worth it.,1506556800,,198,4.628571428571429
106272,2,0790740281,"Albert Brooks is an acquired taste and I had enjoyed Mother with Debby Reynolds and thought I would give it a try especially because Meryl Streep was his love interest. This has to be one of the biggest snooze fests my husband I ever sat through. I forced him to watch it until the end hoping against hope there would be more scenes with Meryl and less of just Albert as a child, Albert here, Albert there, Albert everywhere!
One funny thing was the all you can eat food in the afterlife-but that was about it.
Albert scored some brilliant actors to co-star with him. Lee Grant did well as the cold hearted prosecutor who wants to prove that Albert has shown fear most of his life and therefore cannot move ahead and must be sent back to start all over again.
Rip Torn, bless his talented heart was excellent as the celestial  attorney who defends the hapless Brooks, as he wallows in this muck of a movie.
IF you want to see Meryl Streep in a comedy watch her shine in She Devil. She steals the movie from Rosanne Barr!
There was no chemistry between Albert Brooks and Meryl Streep, though it was obvious that she tried.
One funny scene had her slowly eating some linguini which made Albert nervous-everything makes Albert nervous.
I breathed a sigh of relief when it was over.",1504828800,,1278,4.461538461538462

also it is a nice romantic comedy as well",1502755200,,328,4.39344262295082

106306,3,0790740281,"The movie does a great job of using an absurd premise to deliver a simple moral. It's well acted and has some moments of drollery, like the food the residents eat, the sushi chefs, Miller's past life as a ""native,"" the stupidity of the motorized swivel chairs, and a few others.

106313,3,0790740281,"The story of this movie was stupid and ridiculous.
But I watched the whole thing, and I enjoyed it.
I really cared about Daniel - - I think that a movie is good if I care about the characters - - Daniel was a likable character.
I was very curious as to how the movie would end and what would happen to Daniel.
I laughed - - and it takes a lot to make me laugh.

I enjoyed this movie because it kept me entertained and it was just a relaxing watch,
without having to think or figure anything out or pay attention at all - - it was just a movie to sit back and enjoy.
At the end, I was not left wondering about anything - - I have watched too many movies that left me with annoying questions and an uncertain hanging ending.
At the end, I felt exactly the same as I did at the beginning - - it did not touch me, it did not make me feel good or bad - - it was just over.

I think that most people wonder about what happens to us when we die, and this was an interesting idea.
This movie was very careful not to focus on any religion - - There is no mention of any God, only ""The Universe.""
There was no praying or repenting.
The only thing that you seemed to be judged against was living in fear and not being brave.
There was nothing about how good a person you were, how you treated others, how your life mattered or made a difference, etc.
Heaven is very briefly mentioned, and we are told that Hell does not exist.
We are told that you either ""move on"" which is not really explained, or you go back to Earth as a reincarnation - - there is even an interesting scene where the people get a glimpse of a few of their past lives.
So, the people have their lives judged, but there is no punishment or consequence - - either you go to Heaven or you get reincarnated.
There was no mention of Karma, about what kind of a life you would get reincarnated into based on your life.... in other words, this movie was very light and did not try to teach any lessons.
I thought that it was interesting that the people could eat unlimited food, but there was no alcohol at all, and not even a cigarette.

This movie needed more depth.
There were no scenes about Daniel's marriage - - how he fell in love or how his marriage broke up - - we never even know his wife's name.
There were no emotional scenes about Daniel's life - - nothing to make me cry or understand his character.
There was no mention of anyone important to Daniel in his life or of anyone that he would miss.
This movie needed some scenes from Daniel's life that would be really deep and touching or exciting or interesting, but there was nothing at all.
In other words, this movie felt like a cheap knock-off of ""A Christmas Carol,"" but without anything for us to get to know and understand Scrooge/Daniel.

The ending didn't make sense.
It was very clear that Julia would ""move on,"" and yet, she was on one of the trains going back to Earth.
Were we supposed to believe that Julia and Daniel would be reincarnated together, perhaps as twins?

I would recommend this movie if you just want to be entertained and not concentrate on the plot.
It isn't a thriller or a horror movie.  Nothing scary or disgusting happens.  There is no suspense at all.
It isn't a drama.  There is nothing deep or emotional and you certainly won't cry.
I would call this movie a very light comedy.  You may not laugh, but you will probably smile a few times.
If you want to enjoy this movie, then just watch it and do not ""judge"" it.",1491696000,2,3465,4.152011922503726

106329,5,0790740281,"I don't even like Rom-Com's, yet this film transcends that genre.

At it's core, this film can be categorized as a Romantic Comedy, however it is more a film about self discovery than it is about romance.

After Albert Brooks' character dies in the first 5 minutes (sorry, it's not a spoiler if it's preface) he finds himself facing the daunting task of convincing the Universe that he more than a mere ""lowly"" human in hilarious fashion. In the process, Albert Brooks skewers many of the most fundamental aspects of being human while, at the same time, embracing them.

Here he combines, to poignant effect, his quirky comedy with his wholehearted search for love and meaning in a strangely beautiful and perplexing world. Rip Torn's performance is filled with weirdly entertaining gusto. Meryl Streep's performance is beyond praise. She has a deft comic touch in her line deliveries as well as in her physical acting, so much so that I wish she had found more roles like this one. Perhaps there are no other roles like this one. She's aided, of course, by a warmly believable chemistry between her and the lead. It sounds unlikely, but this couple affects me as deeply as Bogie and Bacall -- or Allen and Keaton in Annie Hall.

106490,5,0790740281,"This film is Albert Brooks' masterpiece.  His usual character is a materialist loser with no ability to be brave, whose neurosis back into a corner, as in Modern Romance and Lost in America.  Defending your life interrogates this character with intelligence, asking the question, what does life mean?  When the character dies in a thoughtless accent in his new car, he finds himself in a afterlife that resembles California.  Everything is too perfect, expect that now he must defend his human life.  Rip Torn plays his glad-handing lawyer with bravado, and Lee Grant portrays a prosecutor from your nightmares. Meryl Streep, who often plays angry and unhappy characters shines as beacon of goodness who falls for Brooks.  Unlike his character, she is brave, resourceful, and happy.  Mostly unsentimental, Defending Your Life, reveals the craven way many people live.  The message of the film is to be brave. I suppose. A classic comedy out of tragedy, Defending Your Life is film that I have loved since I saw it for the first time.",1470614400,,1033,4.965116279069767

106504,4,0790740281,"Mildly entertaining with an earnest performance by Albert Brooks and an enthusiastic one by the great Meryl Streep, this is a fun movie about the literal trial of a man after his absurd and untimely death. Finding himself in a post-death way-station where all humans must face tribunals to determine what their next step in the universe will be, he is faced with reviewing his life of underachievement and an underwhelming lack of ambition. During this process, which for him resembles an IRS audit, he meets and falls for Streep's character whose comparative life of accomplishment and self-sacrifice (during which flashbacks tribunals gush over her like fans at a ""Star Wars"" premiere) makes his prospects for ""advancement"" seem less and less likely.

This light-weight but pleasant movie won't stick in your memory long but is worth the time for its clever perspective on the Afterlife.",1469232000,,889,5.13103448275862
106505,3,0790740281,"Defending Your Life was a cute idea for a movie: Daniel Miller (played by Albert Brooks) dies, and goes to Judgement City, where they will evaluate his life and decide if hes ready to move on, or should be sent back to Earth for another try.

Rip Torn gives an outstanding performance as the defense counsel, Bob Diamond, and Lee Grant is pretty good as the sharky MILF prosecutor. Torn is especially fun to watch; he steals every scene hes in. I was completely unmoved by Meryl Streep as the love interest, but I can understand why others might have liked her in that role.

The film has some cute ideas, many of which revolve around food. The food in Judgement Citys restaurants arrives instantly, its the best Daniel has ever tasted, and Diamond tells him he can eat without guilt: he cant gain weight in Judgement City. The people who run the City, called Residents, use much more of their brains than humans just arrived from Earth (48% vs. 3%), and eat completely different kinds of foodmostly, mysterious clumps covered in a thin sauce. When Daniel tries a bite, he immediately spits it out in disgust, Tastes like horsesh*t, right? says Diamond, laughing. He goes on to explain, When you get smarter, you begin to manipulate your senses. This tastes much different to me than it does to you. The scene is amusing and warm, if not laugh-out-loud funny; many of the little, incidental scenes in the film have similar charm.

The real problem is the main character, played by writer/director Albert Brooks. Were supposed to like him and be rooting for him, but hes such a nebbish that its almost impossible to do. Woody Allens films always had limited commercial appeal because most Normal Americans couldn't connect with the similarly nebbishy characters that he played. But at least those characters were often genuinely funny, and they had the classic ability of the Jewish underdog: they used their wit as both shield and sword against their social, political, or physical superiors. In this movie, Brooks plays the nebbish part with barely any wit, or guts, or even ironical detachment from his own situation. Hes just a guy that sh*t happens to. We confront that unpleasant reality throughout the core of the movie: the courtroom scenes in which the lawyers, judges, and Daniel watch selected episodes from his life. Those scenes are 5% humor, and 95% pathos.

In my opinion, pathos just isn't funny, or even endearing, unless it is infused with wit, or some other redeeming quality. Here, it isnt. As a whole, then, this film is neither funny, nor charming, nor particularly insightful. It is, as I said, merely an interesting failure. In that, its like Brooks previous film, Lost in America.",1467763200,,2704,4.821120689655173

106541,5,0790740281,"""My three percent is swimming.""

A clever concept begets one of the best Albert Brooks films ever. Palpable chemistry between Brooks and Meryl Streep, who just shimmers throughout this picture. Rip Torn is indelible as Brooks's affable lawyer Sam Diamond. Lee Grant ably plays a steely, though vulnerable, prosecutor. It's a great cast.

Let me put it this way: When a guy gets hit by a bus while singing show tunes in his new car, you know you're in for a quintessential Albert Brooks experience. It's the story of an ordinary Everyman (whose weaknesses and insecurities may seem all too familiar) who has landed in circumstances that are anything but ordinary. And because it's an Albert Brooks film, hilarity ensues.",1464739200,,719,4.983333333333333

I believe I, and a lot of people, think about where we wind up after death, if anywhere, and that your behavior during your time on Earth may determine where that is. It is a very funny and warm movie. It's one of those movies that I'll always remember, just like ""The Frisco Kid"" and ""Truly, Madly, Deeply"". Unlike many movies, I don't need someone to remind me what it is about when they ask me if I had seen this or that movie.

This movie is a judgement and reflection on life and the decisions Brooks made out of fear and self doubt in a court like setting, reviewing specific times in his life and whether he advances beyond the universe or returns to earth to live yet another life until he gets it right. While in judgement city in the sky, he meets and falls in love with Meryl Streep, who easily passes her judgement. The movie teaches one to go ahead and take chances in order to obtain a more positive and rewarding life, without regret, and winning the girl. The other movie is essentially a do over of a single day, again, and yet again until Bill Murray changes from a self absorbed womanizer to a humble guy and wins the girl.

106796,3,0790740281,"This movie is tough to watch if you have any Christian perspective on life and death. Even as an atheistic representation of ""heaven"" (and we find out from the movie there's no such thing as Heaven or Hell and people make jokes about God perhaps actually existing along with gaining eternal life after many lifetimes on Earth learning to get smarter), the story had a hard time keeping it's premise together since Humans are being judged apparently on their intelligence as manifested by their courage or lack thereof...but then one character does something monumentally stupid but it's seen as evidence of how smart they are because it was brave.

All of which really goes to show this was intended to be a light-hearted chick-flick. Although to be honest, it wasn't all that much of a romance either. The main characters most likely fall in love because they are the only people under the age of 80 around.

The thing that really saved this movie from being a one-star was that there is an interesting premise about people being judged based not on large actions in their life, but on the small ones we probably would never think significant since our life doesn't come with a soundtrack to tell us how important this particular moment is for our entire future.",1442275200,,1263,4.762557077625571

The premise didn't ring true, and the romance had a magnetism that seemed to fail to bring the lovers together.  Lack of empathy, to say the least.  Outdated, not a great film.

107037,3,0790740281,"Quick Story blurb: Guy dies and must go on trial to move on to the next world or be sent back to earth to try again, in the meantime he meets a woman in the afterlife.

Acting was alright. I felt the best work came from Meryl Streep as the love interest and also from Rip Torn as the defense attorney.  I liked those characters.  Albert Brooks was ok but I felt he lacked energy or something to really make his character pop. He did have pretty good chemistry with Meryl though.

Overall though, decent movie but nothing I want to tout to rush to watch.  Interesting concepts about being judged in your life to move on and learning from your mistakes.  There are some great moments in the trial scenes and some jokes every now and then. This movie also drives you to think about life outside the movie which is a plus, not all movies make you want to think beyond mindless stuff (sex drugs whatever) thrown on screen.  I feel like the stakes for the movie storyline are too low, because if he is sent back to earth, he could try again anyway.  Maybe just me though, I wonder if the stakes were higher such as going to hell, possibly would make this movie just a little better. I watched this movie on a recommendation from someone else and feel like this movie might be ok just to catch on tv or something but eh, I'm just not going to give a better rating than average.

POSSIBLE SPOILER:  *just things I wanted to say about the outcome that I think don't work with the love angle*
I didn't think the love angle was strong enough stakes, because if they are sent back and forget everything that happened there, would they remember each other or find each other on earth? What if they both come back and and aren't physically attracted to each other?  In the afterlife, they were the only two people who weren't old people, who else would have chosen it was all old people and them,  so the stakes were pretty low for finding love in the afterlife.  The movie sort of teased Meryl's defense attorney as someone she might be interested in but only briefly and not a serious threat to her and Albert Brooks relationship.",1427846400,,2118,4.372448979591836

DEFENDING YOUR LIFE: Brooks' vision of the afterlife, ""Judgment City,"" is part Vegas, part L.A., part DisneyWorld, part Universal Studios tour--and a little bit of heaven (you can eat as much as you want and never gain an ounce!): a fully thought-through purgatory, both practical and pleasant. The characters, too, are engaging: Brooks' Dan, all too human, sweatily attempting to weasel his way out of his transgressions; Rip Torn, as his lawyer, expansive, avuncular, with just a touch of condescending hubris. (A high point is hearing him explain why there are no children in Judgment City.)

The criteria for ""moving forward"" are a bit vague--one is ""held back by fears""--but the essential question seems to be one of cowardice vs. courage: choosing to embrace life in spite of its tragedies, suffering and disappointments, or living timidly, in quiet denial and defeat. This film chooses to embrace life, and illustrates by example that while loving another person is the biggest risk in life, it also yields the greatest rewards. This philosophical fantasy disguised as a romantic comedy will make you laugh and cry, and it might just leave you pondering questions both grave--and beyond. And isn't that what we really want from a film--or from a life?",1421884800,5,1517,4.921875

It didn't satirize anything, unless maybe an in-joke about Scientology the uninitiated wouldn't get. Its underlying concept is clever but too thin to carry the whole film. What I really don't get is how Rotten Tomatoes can give circa 7.2 stars to ""The Russians Are Coming"" and c. 9.5 stars to this. Maybe NYC really is a separate planet...

However... I still love Albert Brooks, Meryl Streep, Rip Torn, Shirley Maclaine and most everyone else in the cast, there WAS wonderful chemistry between Brooks and Streep, and it was nice to have a happy if nonsensical ending.",1408752000,,720,4.885245901639344

Consistency of comedic purpose places Brooks at a level of quality far-and-away better than the norm (Ben Stiller, Adam Sandler and Garry Shandling come to mind here).

Perhaps this fact is the reason why you will find quality actors such as Meryl Streep playing opposite Albert.

Also a very fun look at where we go when we move on from this world - go to a place where one can eat anything without concern for calories or health? Past lives pavilion?

I actually found out about the Defending Your Life movie after viewing an Internet Movie database comment for the Astral City: A Spiritual Journey movie. I rented it through one of my amazon accounts for $1.99, but plan to eventually purchase the dvd. The movie centers around a Los Angeles advertising executive  who dies and goes to a heaven that includes some of the best earth inspired amenities (such as top hotel service, cooked restaurant meals, and recreation such as golfing). He has only a short time to enjoy this unexpected nirvana due to the fact that he has to defend himself on why he is ready to move on to the next heavenly realm instead of being forced to be reincarnated back on earth. The film stars Albert Brooks (upcoming 2016 movie: Finding Dory)Meryl Streep (Mamma Mia!, upcoming  November 2014 film: Into The Woods )and Rip Torn (Men In Black, Men in Black II)During his stay, he falls in love with a woman who returns his feelings.

107546,5,0790740281,"Ok, I admit it, I'm a sucker for this New Age stuff. Defending Your Life is a funny, thought provoking, funny, sweet, funny take on, well, defending your life once it's over. Do you get to move on or do you recycle back to another Earth life?

Albert Brooks plays Daniel Miller, whose odds of moving on aren't terrible, but they aren't good either. He wasn't bad on Earth, he was just sort of ... blah. So he gets to sit and watch nine less than exemplary days from his life, along with two judges, a prosecutor and a defender. Judge: ""Even though this feels like a trial, it really isn't."" (It really is).

The acting is superb. Albert Brooks delivers comedy ranging from one line zingers to slapstick, and Meryl Streep is Meryl Streep, yet the most amazing performance is by Rip Torn as Daniel's defender, Bob Diamond. Torn's character is by turns condescending, tender hearted, smarmy, and brilliant (he's way, way smarter than Daniel). His best lines come when he's spin doctoring yet another fiasco from Daniel's life. If I'm ever in trouble, I want Bob Diamond as my lawyer!

Underneath it all, DYL is a love story. Daniel meets Streep's Julia (who is most definitely moving on), and somehow they fall in love in the five days they have together. But - will Daniel get to move on along with her?",1382832000,,1301,4.551282051282051

I have seen this movie countless times. I have recomended it that many times too and no one ever says they don't  like this movie.

After you watch this movie, two days later you will be thinking about it and quoting lines from it. If you are a Rip Torn fan, this is a must see!

It's a fantasy movie about what happens after death.  It was not particularly well acted or directed and the story line seemed long and drawn out.  It simply didn't hold one's attention.

Daniel dies in a car wreck and must defend his life with the ""help"" of a public defender and against a vicious prosecutor. His worst moments of his life are replayed on a giant screen while he squirms and tries to explain his actions and his failures to act.

Quirky, somewhat acerbic in parts, it has an offbeat humor that never fails to make me laugh out loud during some scenes. Rip Torn is used sparingly, but to great effect. The opening sequence with Streisand's Something's Coming is one of the movie scenes that continues to stick out at me. Don't hesitate to check this out.",1368230400,,516,4.329896907216495

107704,5,0790740281,"This is one of the most warm-hearted and unique comedies you will ever see. Albert Brook's comedy is definitely not for everyone, as with other comedy genres like Monty Python, Frazier, or Airplane. Cerebral humor on a subject that no one has experience with until we depart this earth is a pure joy, and Brooks capitalizes on this in the most subtle ways. It is no mystery that fear keeps most of us from reaching our full potential, but to see it used as a ""trial, but not a trail"" vehicle is amusingly effective, and forces us to examine our own choices, but not in a guilt-ridden way. The entire cast is a delight, and the pacing is right on.

The character of Daniel Miller is a typical American male on the verge of middle age. He believes that getting a BMW and making a certain salary means that he has ""arrived"" in his life, just like many others do, only to find material success and money have nothing to do with success as a human being. Meryl Streep is splendid,(as usual), as the free spirited Julia that most likely would never have been in a person like Daniel's life on Earth. Once thrown together in a place that is supposed to be without materialism or competition, Brooks does a magnificent job of showing us that it still occurs even in Judgement City with Rip Torn and Lee Grant as the attorneys. The human condition is what is really on trial, and the scenes for Daniel's life were absolutely delightful in this way. The ending of this movie could melt even the hardest of hearts and brings the entire film's premise into the fore in a splendid way.

If you are looking for fart humor, slapstick, or vulgarity, (which I love those comedies too), Defending Your Life may not be for you. But if you love a clever, warm, and a thought provoking plot in your comedies, this one hits a grand slam.",1367020800,,1815,4.4474474474474475

The afterlife as envisioned by Brooks has adopted an Oprah Winfrey type of personal growth program where people are judged primarily on how smart they have become and whether they have overcome their fears.  It would have been nice if Brooks had satirized those ideas more.  I think he sort of did with the ""past life pavilion,"" scene, but ultimately this movie takes the new age philosophy too seriously.

Such a great movie and funny as hell. Albert Brooks wrote it so the dialog is hilarious but the facial expressions...the situations...my girlfriend and I died laughed at some of the scenes. But besides the funny, it gives a unique and hilarious perspective of the so-called ""Afterlife"" without ever once coming across as preachy or trying to ram some sort of subtle religious agenda down your throat.

107840,5,0790740281,"Great intelligent comedy in cinema is hard to find. DEFENDING YOUR LIFE is right up there with the best of Woody Allen. Albert Brooks made some terrific films in the 80's like REAL LIFE and LOST IN AMERICA but this film from 1991 is his absolute best. The story begins with a man in his late 30's named Daniel Miller, (Albert Brooks), buying a brand new BMW and taking it for a drive while listening to some new CDs. The CDs drop off the seat next to him and while trying to pick them up Daniel drives straight into a bus. The next scene he's in the ""afterlife"" in a place called Judgement City. He is being driven to his hotel where he will spend the next week DEFENDING HIS LIFE. The premise for this film is that we are all here on earth to overcome our fears and when we pass on we must be judged on how well we have accomplished that. If we lose the judgement we will be returned to Earth. Daniel is a good guy but he did not exactly live a fearless life. Daniel starts his adventure in Judgement City by meeting his lawyer Bob Diamond played to perfection by Rip Torn. After his days in court Judgement City offers its visitors ""as much of the best food as they can eat without gaining weight"" and an array of nightly entertainment. While Daniel is at a comedy club he meets a woman his age named Julia, (Meryl Streep). She is a remarkable woman who seems to be a shoe in for getting to the next level of awareness. They begin to fall for each other while at the same time Daniel starts to realize that he may have a different fate than the heroic Julia. The story is original and clever, the screenplay is hilarious and inventive and the acting is perfect It's one of the best comedies of the last 20 years.",1351555200,,1714,4.212765957446808

Blessed with a strong memory, I re-rented the film on Netflix years later and loved it so much I decided to buy it. There are several reasons why. First, I could relate better to the characters since they did not take on strange appearances in the afterlife (i.e. broad Marvel-style superpowers, sci-fi alien structures). Second, I loved many of the lines used in the screenplay, particularly from leads Albert Brooks and Meryl Streep. Finally, I felt I was able to learn things that I could also use during my time on Earth, most notably overcoming my fears. While I don't really believe in reincarnation as the world was presented there, I do believe the choices we make have long-term, sometimes eternal, consequences. Therefore, I strive to do the best I can with what I have and hope others do the same. Additionally, the film seems to be underrated. Granted, many films and other media sources can discuss life and death in a variety of forms, but a big reason I connected so well is because it is sentimental and, to a great degree, simplified. I hope this film has helped others, even in a smaller cult following.",1340409600,,1277,4.629955947136564

107895,5,0790740281,"What's good to do on a dreary Saturday afternoon with nothing to watch on your 100 channels of TV? This movie is.

Albert Brooks plays the lead character, Daniel Miller, a genial example of an everyday Joe and nobody who has a self-deprecating humor that matches his ambition and judgment. Even his purchase of a brand new BMW seems diminished, more so when he meets the front end of a bus with it.

Daniel awakens to find he is on his way to Judgment City where his life will be closely examined in what appears to be very much of a trial, not for his sins, but for his lack of spine throughout his life. His defender, Bob Diamond played be Rip Torn, makes him feel small and insignificant even through his kindnesses. Lee Grant is the prosecutor who makes the argument before two judges that Daniel should be returned to earth. The transients in this ""half-way city"" await the decision if they will go to heaven or a return to earth to redeem themselves. There are golf courses, gourmet food, shopping malls and comedy clubs to occupy these white-robed  souls while their fate is being deliberated. He meets Julie played by Meryl Streep, who is intrigued by Daniel's wit in the club, where he goes toe-to-toe with the failing comedian.  Even with her, his feelings of inferiority and worthlessness surface as she is staying in an obviously upper class establishment while his digs look more like a Red Roof Inn. Ironically, it is Julie who brings Daniel to his ultimate challenge and his chance to redeem himself.

The script is tailor-made for Brooks' delivery and character, probably because he directed this comedic fantasy. The plot and script never plods. Meryl Streep seems the perfect choice for the budding developing love interest as she and Brooks demonstrate a perfect chemistry. Rip Torn and Lee Grant provide the best in a supporting cast.  The music compliments plot and script.

This is a light comedy that is a nice diversion from afternoon chores, dreary afternoons, or for just plain evening entertainment.

He meets a woman named Julia there whom he befriends. Daniel is directed to a courtroom where scenes from his life are replayed and the people in charge of his case defend and accuse his right and wrong actions.

This film shows creativeness about what could happen after one dies, what it could be like in the afterlife before a person is given instructions on where to go next. It opens ones eyes to pay attention to how they treat others and how they react and respond to their lives in the present. There is a small amount of bad language in the film, which is the only reason why I gave it a 4 stars, although to some it could be considered light bad language.

Lee Grant and Rip Torn are also terrific in supporting roles. And of course Albert Brooks is his usual hilarious self in the male lead. My only complaint with him is that he doesn't write and direct more films.

Rip Torn has a wonderful performance here, all the performances are good, my only complaint is Streep's character. Just don't believe she'd fall romantically for Brooks.

But then the script petered out.

Observations:

1.  Most likely explanation:  the original script was brilliant, deep, and full of unexpected insights into human nature.  But by the time it hit the screen, by the time all the compromises and sacrifices had been made, it had become just another bit of Hollywood pap.
2.  Would have been much, much better if Brooks's character had never met a girl.  What an unnecessary distraction!
3.  Viewer kept expecting some sort of explanation for the ""aliens"":  the food they ate, etc.  As if it was going to suddenly turn sinister.  But it never did, meaning the viewers were just distracted for nothing.
4.  You couldn't get those trials under way so swiftly!  Everybody would have like a jillion questions before you could even get the trial started.

The flashbacks are especially dull. One might have hoped for much more in such a looooong movie.

It's closer the truth than many films which treat the subject, and bases advancement on whether the subject has conquered fear...-and certainly it is necessary not to be influenced by fear if one is going to progress...
Sadly, an idea is promoted in the film that people from earth only use 3% of their brain, but what actually counts is development of the inner mind, not the outer brain - still, it's close to something that is true...

I've often thought about how funny it would be to have a 24hr camera recording your life. Many moments, usually related to funny kid moments, would be great to capture and revisit. On the flip side, everyone has moments that don't want to live again but all of these shape who we are.

I'm not a great movie reviewer but I will say that I love the creativity of this interpretation of life-after-death. It is humorous with a lot of satire at how we live our daily lives.

Albert Brooks and Meryl Streep do a wonderful job of acting and the supporting actors are all great too.

The love story theme is okay (with a kind of corny ending) but the concept of reviewing your major life choices after death is interesting and it is really all about the interpretation of them and the lead-up to them.

people who use 20 times as much of their brain judge people from earth when they die. how come the people doing the judging acted more stupid than the average person i meet in a supermarket (apologies to supermarket workers).

i believe that there may have been some sort of moral to the movie. if there was it passed me by, but then i passed most of the last hour by and jumped to the end .. where .. our hero endangers his life to be with the one he loves, and as a result everybody lives happily ever after .. ah!

wish i hadn't skipped to the end so soon after eating my lunch .. it nearly came right back up again.

a movie about middle-class white americans led to believe that when they die things are actually quite nice (that is if you can stand living in middle-class white america without dying of boredom) and the worst that can happen is that you go back to earth and have another life.

you'll feel like you've lost that remaining 3% of your brain if you sit through this.

Daniel's sole ally is Bob Diamond (Rip Torn, best part of the movie), an amalgam of every sleazy defense attorney on the face of the earth.  He projects just the right amount of impersonal charm, making him the ideal friend to anybody in this situation;  I started wishing he was MY lawyer.  The highlights of DYL take place in the ""examining"" room, where Daniel is made to relive his miserable life while Bob Diamond dances around each catastrophe with a sunny outlook.

As for the rest of it, the jokes go on for too long. Especially a running gag about how you can eat anything when you're dead and not gain weight (Brooks must have worried about his cholesterol at the time).  Daniel is really the only lifelike person in the film, with the rest of the world (dead and otherwise) full of condescending asses.  I also don't see why Meryl Streep instantly falls in love with this dork.

108005,5,0790740281,"There are thousands of movies that deal with the after-life in some way, shape, or form.  Quite possibly, the most common, is the horror films of supernatural natures, but there are many other movies involving the afterlife in some way a very recent example is ""The Lovely Bones"", though that is a much more depressing movie, and not as well made either.

  I am not particularly a fan of Albert Brooks, some stuff he is in, I have enjoyed, others, I have not, but this movie has stuck with me since I first saw it at 6yrs, so I decided to watch it again and see if it was worth mentioning, and the good news is, it is!!!

  The way this film deals with the afterlife is not about religion, so as devout Christian I would say to other Christians: check your biases at the door. This movie is more of an allegory and commentary on humanity than it is about beliefs or morals.

  The story involves a man named Danielle (Albert Brooks) who is landed himself in the afterlife after a fateful meeting with a truck.  He discovers that he has been there many other times to be ""judged"" as to whether or not he has let go of the fears that so commonly plague mankind.  If it is found that he has let go of his fears, he moves stays, but if it is found that he still has fear ruling his life, he will be sent back to earth, reincarnated again.

  The great thing about this movie is that it touches on something that will never be dated; the nature of man to fear what he does not know or cannot control.  It does this in a very fun and touching manner as they go through various days (9 to be exact) in his life to see if he is ready to move on or not.  The humor is very dry and is not slapstick or silly, and though there are plenty of laugh-outloud moments that mainly come fro Rip Torn who plays Daniel's defense attorney, it is a more cerebral humor as it pokes fun at society's common fears.  The chemistry between Brooks and Streep is not incredible, but it is enough to make the movie believable, and the ending very satisfying and sweet, I even had tears in my eyes by the end.

  Overall, a wonderful movie, and a delight to anyone who enjoys intelligent comedies, and it is an underrated gem.  :)

There is so much presented here in this whimsical look at the 5-day waiting process where the dead's life is judged and then recommended for either advancement in being or a retraction back to Earth again.  The film clearly presents a reincarnationist point of view, complete with the film's funniest scene in  a Past Life Pavilion hosted by Shirley MacClaine in a spoofing, tongue-in-cheek performance!  At times, the film becomes a little bogged down in Albert Brooks' ""lovable loser-ness"", but all-n-all this film is a delightful uplift at a ""possibility"" on life after death after life after death after....""

It's probably us in many situations but Brooks plays this exactly on the dot.  Meryl Streep just sticks around for the ride since this is Brooks' act.  Well, Streep is wonderful and makes acting seem effortless.  The idea of Judgement City is just pure genius when you consider that everyone expects to go to heaven for just being a good samaritan.  Brooks places this assumption upside with court like drama.

With this DVD, it's disappointing to just have the trailer.  In this comedy, I expected outtakes and deleted scenes.

I love the whole concept of the movie of moving on to a judgement period after you die, to decide to move on.  Very original twist on the afterlife.  Brooks is great as the somewhat hapless man who must defend his life's record.  The real beauty of this movie is his time spent exploring Judgement City and his encounters with Meryl Streep.  Brooks writing is very witty.  I love the Hall of Previous lives where one can see what they were in previous lives.  One of the best quotes is when Julia (Streep) asks Brooks what he was as they are each watching their own lives.  Brooks previous life happens to be a native running from a lion.

108144,5,0790740281,"I recently persuaded my 14 year old daughter and her friends to watch this DVD and they loved it. Since this is one of my favorite movies, I was very gratified. A witty film about life after death, DEFENDING YOUR LIFE'S premise is that fear is what keeps us from progressing both on earth and in Judgment City. Conquer your fears, and you'll continue to grow and move on. If you don't, you'll keep returning to earth until you get it right....or until the universe just gets fed up and throws you away.

Albert Brooks' low-key performance is perfect, and Meryl Streep is blissfully charming. But it's Rip Torn as Defense Attorney Diamond who steals the show. This is a subtle, quiet comedy that you can watch again and again. From the 'Little Brains' that have to go on trial while in Judgment City to the Past Lives Pavilion to the running gag that while there, a person can eat all they want and never get sick or gain weight, DEFENDING YOUR LIFE manages to be both funny and thoughtful. After all, the idea that courage or the lack of it is what keeps us from our full potential is all too true.

108152,4,0790740281,"Six years after piercing the yuppie delusion of the open road with his trenchantly funny ""Lost in America"", Albert Brooks went again behind and before the camera to make this amusing, soft-centered 1991 romantic fantasy involving one man's challenge in handling the afterlife. As with ""Lost in America"", Brooks casts himself as an LA-based advertising executive (a favorite calling of his for the satirical possibilities), but this time a very successful one named Daniel Miller. As he dives for some CDs in the spanking new BMW convertible he bought himself for his birthday, he crashes into a bus and dies. Before you can say heaven can wait, Daniel finds himself in a white tunic in a sterile-looking place called Judgment City. As he finds out, this is where he is to be placed on trial to find out if he moves on to heaven or has to return to earth.

The rest of the film is focused on Daniel's trial, where he gets to witness select scenes from his life on a big screen, evidence used by both the defense lawyer and the prosecutor to support their respective cases. In the midst of the trial, he meets and falls in love with an idealized woman named Julia, the perfect candidate for heaven made clear by her innate goodness and shorter trial. His response to their romance leads to a nicely executed climax which tests Daniel's deep-seeded fears toward his inevitable fate. Although I miss the pervasive acerbity that I have come to expect from Brooks' comedy style, he achieves a winsome romanticism here and addresses pertinent questions about how fear holds us back from the things we really want.

As Daniel, Brooks is a softer version of himself though just as self-critical, while a relaxed, accent-free Meryl Streep is ideally cast as the too-good-to-be-true Julia, whose only quirk is the bottomless appetite that the afterlife allows her. The two develop a nice rapport that makes the ending emotionally palpable. In welcome appearances, a likeable Rip Torn and a tough-minded Lee Grant play their roles as the battling lawyers with precision. Even Shirley MacLaine shows up in a cameo in a particularly funny scene set at the aptly named Past Lives Pavilion, where people can see their previous incarnations. This is an unexpectedly warm and fuzzy treat from a master of comedy sarcasm. There are unfortunately no extras with the 2001 DVD.",1163030400,5,2355,4.870324189526184

The purpose of having to defend your life in judgment city after you die is something that I find to be very original and the way its presented is quite original. The bottom line to the story is finding the truth within yourself and going after it and it gets that done.

I'd never been a big Meryl Streep fan until I saw DYL. For the film to work, Streep has to convince you that she's a woman you'd want to spend eternity with. She pulls it off and then some.

Rip Torn does a comic turn as Brooks' lawyer in the hereafter that should have gotten him at least an Oscar nomination. And as for Brooks, well, you're either a big fan or you're not. Count me in the former camp.

108211,5,0790740281,"Defending Your Life is one of the smartest, funniest, and original films to come out of the 1990s.  Albert Brooks, playing both behind and in front of the camera, does a fantastic job of creating this ""courtroom drama"" set in Purgatory.  By keeping a the films themes short and simple, enticing us with brilliant performances by Meryl Streep and Rip Torn, and bringing a true sense of fantasy to this picture, Brooks keeps us hooked from the opening scenes until the last.  Panned by most critics, I actually found this film to be extremely witty with a Wes Anderson-esque type of dry martini humor.  Brooks is easily able to transform himself into a likeable ""every man"" that finds himself defending his ""normal"" life.  What works is that it feels and seems like your own life.  Brooks' character isn't a superhero, he isn't a genius (only using 3% of his brain), and he isn't a playboy, he is your average human on the street.  Makes decent money, celebrates being alone, just bought a new BMW, and is coasting through life rather simply.  Sound like anyone you may know? Brooks creates this sensation that Judgment City could exist, that the trials of your life could happen, and within all of this chaos and confusion, love could emerge.

Albert Brooks is a very smart writer.  He wouldn't create your typical Hollywood love story and send it through the recycling machine.  His approach to love in this film is totally random, somewhat sporadic, but yet honestly real.  There is a mystery between he and Meryl Streep's relationship.  That is what I loved so much about them.  Typically in films of this nature you have this elaborate story of how two people meet, they fall in love, they fight, and suddenly discover that their passion is stronger than ever before (normally due to some unforeseen ... or clichd moment), but not in this film. Brooks approaches love as if it already exists.  He hints towards the notion that these two may have been in Judgment City before, that maybe they have already had their awkward courtship, that maybe the climactic clich has already happened, and now they are just rediscovering themselves.  Brooks sets this up with Streep's first lines, which are simply, ""Haven't we met before?""  While this may not seem like it is that exciting, the fact that they are in Judgment City after dying, and two random people recognize each other is heartwarming.  I was immediately attached to these two characters from the moment they met in the Comedy Club.  Their emotions didn't seem created by Hollywood, but instead created by the brilliant craftsmanship of Brooks' words.  If you aren't connected to the courtroom antics of this film, than the spark that Streep creates with Brooks will surely keep you grounded for good.

I would also like to applaud Brooks for his ability to create a whole new world from the inside out.  Just as confused as Brooks is when he first arrives to Judgment City, we are forced to see this creative world through his eyes, and he is not afraid to demonstrate his attention to detail.  The concept of food in this film kept me laughing long after the final credits rolled.  The scene in the Italian restaurant with the waiter and the pies ranks among one of the funniest scenes in a film.  In fact, as I type this review, I am still laughing about it.  His creative mind also allowed us to consider the possibility of reincarnation and the existence of bigger and better worlds.  He plants us in Judgment City, but doesn't leave us there.  He allows us to travel while making us feel comfortable, thus keeping a smile on our faces throughout the entire visit.  He makes us laugh, either through his own words, or through that of Rip Torn, who nearly stole every scene possible.  As I continue to watch more of Rip Torn's work, I am beginning to see that he is quite a versatile actor that has very deep comedic roots.  If it wasn't the instant connection between Streep and Brooks that kept this film glued together, than it definitely was the charisma of Rip Torn in the courtroom.

Finally, I would like to say that watching this film in a post-Matrix universe, there are some interesting parallels between the two.  When Rip Torn is talking about allowing humans to go through to another life, or sending them back to Earth, he references the universe to a machine.  Again, living in a post-Matrix world, this immediately darkened the film and perked up my ears.  I know this may be grabbing at thin air, but the scene in the Matrix when Cypher is talking about how good the machine makes his steak taste, eerily reminded me of all the food used in this film.  There were several other moments just like this that just seemed to fit rather snug.  Whether you believe it or not, I believe the Wachowski brothers may have watched this film once or twice before creating their prized trilogy.

Overall, I thought this was an outstanding film.  From the instant character excitement to the originality of the script, I thought that this was one of Brooks' best outings.  The fact that you could tell that the cast was honestly having a good time in every scene, that you laughed when they laughed (which was quite a bit in this film), and that you could actually enjoy a witty comedy without guns or violence impressed me.  Brooks has such a sharp humor that I cannot wait to revisit this movie to catch some of the lines that I may have missed the first time.  Streep does a sensational job, while Rip Torn steals every scene he is in.  Impressive to say the least, and am happy that the 90s were able to produce one original piece of comedy.

Grade: ***** out of *****",1126396800,95,5636,4.643794147325933
108212,5,0790740281,"This extremely entertaining film focuses on Albert Brooks as a man who dies in an accident and ends of in a stop-off point between Earth and Heaven.  It turns out that when you die, your life is reviewed and if you merit it, you proceed to Heaven otherwise you are sent back to Earth to live your life again.  The problem with Brooks is that he has been sent back so much that this is his last chance or he will be reduced to nothingness.

Defending Brooks' life is his lawyer played brilliantly by Rip Torn against the vicious prosecutor (Lee Grant).  While in a restuarant on the first night Brooks meets Meryl Streep who is also there for the same purpose.

While Brooks' life was plagued with cowardice and failure, Streep was a valiant person that cared deeply for others.  We can't figure out what Streep's attraction is for such a loser like Brooks but as their time together progresses, some of Streep's raw nerve start to rub off on Brooks.

I was lucky to come across in a store the last DVD that contain both ""Meet Joe Black"" and ""Death Takes a Holiday"" on a second disc.

I never had seen ""Death Takes a Holiday"" before and so when I watch it after seeing ""Meet Joe Black"" I was surprise by the beauty of it.  I usually don't enjoy films dating back to 1934 but this is very good.

I hope someday that Universal will re-release these two movies together again on DVD.  I recommend at this time to buy the VHS version of  ""Death Takes a Holiday"" so you can enjoy the movie.

Mel even has a charming, (and convincing), romance with Oscar winner Meryl Streep, who's never been this likeable onscreen before.

We laughed until we were tired and had a great time; it was one of those random moments with a friend when all your cares seem little ones and the movie is both funny and validating.  Something my husband said one evening recently reminded me of the film, so I got it to share with him.  Although he enjoyed it as much as I had on first viewing, I felt that some of the humor was a little lame on seeing it again.  Streep was superb, of course, as the relaxed, carefree, and heroic Julia.  She leaps into the new experience of pleasure without consequences with a simple and delightful abandon, eating whatever food she likes and, as the end of her stay in Judgement City nears, propositioning the neurotic Daniel.  Albert Brooks is perfect as the latter, a fearful and self-defeating man who has missed the boat for his entire thirty odd years.  Although I think most people will enjoy the film on first viewing, I suspect that a repeat will find it much too predictable, perhaps even a little cliche.

108257,5,0790740281,"Released in 1991, ""Defending Your Life"" is one of those rare movies that is at once funny, intelligent and, yes, profound.
Writer, director and star Albert Brooks plays Daniel Miller - an advertising executive who finds himself driving headlong into a bus on his birthday. Waking up dead in the perpetually sunny and 74-degree Judgment City, Daniel discovers that he must ""defend"" the life he lived on Earth - a process which consists of reviewing selected days from his life to determine the extent to which he overcame fear and lived genuinely as a result. If he is found by the two judge panel to have sufficiently conquered fear, he is allowed to pass on to a higher plane, if not he will return to Earth to try again. He is assigned a Defender (played with amiable bluster by Rip Torn) and must argue against a steely Prosecutor (Lee Grant). During the course of his stay in Judgment City, Daniel meets and falls in love with Julia (the lovely Meryl Streep), another recently deceased arrival. Without revealing too much more, it is sufficient to say that the love Daniel develops for Julia is crucial to the outcome of his ""trial"".
This movie was a delight to watch! The humor ranges from wry observation about the human condition to pop culture sight gags such as Shirley Maclaine hosting the Past Lives Pavilion (a Judgment City attraction in which visitors can glimpse their past life incarnations). The philosophy of the film, the idea that fear is a crucial element to be worked through while we are here, resonated deeply with me. It is fear in one form or another, after all, which prevents us from leading genuine lives - the fear of death or the fear of defying Societal Will (""the Dragon of Thou Shalt"", to quote Joseph Campbell) and being truly ourselves, for example.
""Defending Your Life"" is the perfect antidote to the flood of moronic comedies that have been so popular of late, a movie that will make you laugh and, perhaps, think.",1012089600,17,1953,4.696793002915452

Daniel Miller (Brooks) has just celebrated his  birthday; on his way home from work, in a new car and with a stack of new  CD's (presents from co-workers), he becomes distracted, has a close  encounter with a bus, and does not survive.  The next thing he knows, he's  aboard a tram somewhere, en route to a place called ""Judgment City,"" which  has all the amenities of a resort, and has the best food he's ever had,  ever (and you can eat as much as you want, and never gain weight).  He's  put up in a fine hotel, and a phone call later he is in the office of Bob  Diamond (Rip Torn), who he learns is to be his defense counselor in a trial  during which his entire life is to be judged.  Did he make the most of his  life?  Make the right decisions?  Was he able to conquer his fears, or did  he always take the easy way because he was afraid?  The decision of the two  Judges (George Wallace and Lillian Lehman) who will hear his case will  determine his future.  Will he have to ""Go back,"" and try it all again in  another life on earth, or will he be deemed ready to ""Move on.""  Brooks  has created a tableau of colorful, memorable characters here, surrounding  Daniel Miller as we follow his progress from one hilarious scene to the  next.  As Julia, a fellow defendant whom Daniel meets and falls in love  with, Meryl Streep is an absolute joy to watch.  Lee Grant, as Lena Foster,  Daniel's prosecutor, is also in top form.  But Rip Torn, as the exuberant  Bob Diamond, is the one who practically steals the show, with a performance  that should have garnered him a best supporting actor nomination.  The  scene in which Diamond explains to Daniel that the average person on earth  only uses three percent of available brain capacity (he calls them ""Little  brains"") is hysterical.  Other memorable scenes involve a visit by Daniel  and Julia to the ""Past Lives Pavilion,"" wherein they encounter a number of  surprises, and one in which they are having dinner, and Daniel is  embarrassed by a waiter who wants to give him ""nine pies"" to take home, and  by Julia, who digs into a plate of pasta with gusto and sucks in the  longest noodle, apparently, in all of Judgment City, and all while Lena  Foster looks on from another table across the room; all of which adds up to  plenty of laughs.  The supporting cast also includes Art Frankel  (Arthur), Ernie Brown (Ernie), Gary Beach (Car salesman), Peter Schuck  (Stan), Sharlie Stuart, and Buck Henry, doing an especially funny turn as  Dick Stanley, a defense counselor who fills in for Bob Diamond one day, and  who doesn't like to ""toot his own horn.""

Brooks' humor is not for everyone, but intelligent and sophisticated comedy  never is. For those who like their comedy a little smarter and wittier than  the norm, Brooks is a gem.
A good introduction to his work is this 1991  film starring Brooks and Meryl Streep. It takes a warm and hilarious look  at the after-life, seen through Brooks' own eyes. This film is far more  thoughtful and original than your standard Hollywood fare--a very welcome  change.
Streep is very funny and charming in this film, with none of the  pretentiousness that clouds some of her films. Rip Torn (""The Larry  Sanders Show"" on HBO) gives a supporting performance as good as you're  likely to see.

108301,5,0790740281,"Like several other reviewers, I have watched this film repeatedly. Beyond the wonderful comedic content lies a premise that is both thought-provoking and inspiring: that fear, as Bob Diamond (Rip Torn) tells Daniel Miller  (Brooks), ""Is like a big cloud....But lift that cloud, and buddy,  you're in for the ride of your life!"" Truer words were never spoken,  nor their point driven home more eloquently and humorously than in this  film. At another point, Torn asks Brooks if he had any problems in life.  ""Sure,"" Brooks answers. ""Everybody's got problems. Don't  they?"" A beat, and Torn wryly chuckles: ""Yeah...everybody on  Earth!"" This constant poking of fun at we ""little-brained""  denizens of Earth is one of the film's greatest comic strengths. Brooks'  ability to make a statement so funny yet inspiring in an utterly  non-religious, unpreaching way is nothing short of masterful.

But if you're one of the lucky ones who do, you're in for a treat. The attention to detail in the movie is mindboggling. There's so many little humorious things happening in the background of the movie alone that makes it worth seeing (eg. the car dealership in the film's beginning, the tram ride with all the pedestrians in their white tupas in the background). Brooks plays the character of the average man so well in most all of his films. This film is no exception. I hope the negative reviews he recieved for Mother won't stop him from making more of what he makes best--funny, thought provoking movies.
