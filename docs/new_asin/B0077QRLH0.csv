8512125,5,B0077QRLH0,"Apparently the only other ""reviewer"" did not actually watch this video. The video is very eye opening and educational. If you don't care whether your children are being influenced by people who worship other gods than the Christian God, then you won't get much out of this video. But, if you DO care and want to make sure that your children are being influenced by Christian principles, then this video is for you. It explains how the creator of many of the games for Nintendo got his inspiration (visiting a fox god shrine) and shows many symbols and themes that are not Christian (such as human sacrifice in the legend of Zelda). I wasn't sure what to expect when I bought the video but  I thoroughly enjoyed it. My husband (who does not call himself a Christian) and my 6-year-old son both enjoyed the video.",1349654400,5,811,4.593103448275862
