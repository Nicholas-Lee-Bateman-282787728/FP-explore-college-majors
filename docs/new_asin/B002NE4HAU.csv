8374980,5,B002NE4HAU,"I wish I had purchased this DVD years ago when I first started learning about feng shui. Taking an accurate compass reading is the foundation of feng shui, yet it can be stressful if you don't have an experienced feng shui practitioner show you how to do it in person, and good feng shui practitioners are somewhat hard to come by, at least in the places where I've lived. I've muddled along for the several years that I've practiced feng shui as a hobby, but I always had some lingering doubts that I was taking compass readings correctly. This DVD is the experienced practitioner I wish I had had by my side years ago when I first started taking readings. I learned things and had other things confirmed. Compass Reading Fundamentals would be equally as useful for beginners as well as those with some experience.

Kartar is VERY generous in providing her knowledge and many years of experience about how to take a compass reading, and she's doing it for a fantastic price. Importantly, she gives you exactly what you need to take an accurate reading and the key details, all in a way that inspires confidence and knowledge of what to do. I particularly like that she shows you exactly how to take a reading using Google - it's a good way to double check readings that you take at the location. If you are or do take compass readings, this DVD is a must.",1370736000,,1356,4.512195121951219
8374981,5,B002NE4HAU,"Kartar Diamond describes in a practical and informative way everything that one needs to know about using the compass for Feng Shui.  She clarifies many aspects that may be confusing to people (such as how to choose the appropriate 'facing' direction of a building) as well as how to interpret the compass readings, and ultimately what to do to make a house a great environment for you and your family.  I found this DVD fun, helpful and intriguing.  Very worth watching, and her ideas and comments are inspirational!  I thoroughly enjoyed this DVD and recommend it to anyone that wants to improve their home's energy, livability, resale value and overall enjoyment.",1254528000,,666,4.972972972972973
8374982,5,B002NE4HAU,"This is one of the most comprehensive instructional videos on how to use a Feng Shui Compass I have ever seen.  Well done, Kartar!!! This is good for a beginner's first introduction or a professional wanting a brush-up compass reading course.",1254441600,,242,4.902439024390244
8374983,5,B002NE4HAU,"This DVD is great! EASY to follow, learn from and actually be able to DO IT with accurate results. Watching a professional do the compass reading is really helpful. It avoids the inevitable mistakes that can come with not knowing exactly what one should be doing and NOT doing; be it a long distance reading or in person.
Kartar is clear, informative and walks the viewer through each phase of the compass reading, step by step and then with a review! Just TERRIFIC!
