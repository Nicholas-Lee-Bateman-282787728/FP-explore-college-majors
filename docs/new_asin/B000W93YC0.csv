2963524,3,B000W93YC0,"one of the better ""dime a dozen"" movies of the sixties, enjoyed it even if it was not historically correct or even because of the cheesy acting.  Still would recommend it to viewers who like movies of this type",1387238400,,210,4.384615384615385
2963525,3,B000W93YC0,"I think this movie is OK for the sword & sandal story it is.  If you're looking for historical accuracy, look elsewhere.  If you're just looking for some muscle-bound mindless entertainment to kill time, this should fit the bill.",1368835200,,229,4.846153846153846

He is assigned by King Menalaos of Sparta to keep his wayward wife safe.  They are shipwreaked off Egypt and have to plead for assylm to the Egyptan King.  There are feats of strength, intrigue, love, and war.  Very good sword and sandal movie.",1356825600,5,363,4.714285714285714
2963529,5,B000W93YC0,"Mark Forest stars as the 'Lion of Thebes' and what an unforgettable sight he is. His body is beyond belief and plays a paramount role in this entertaining sands and sandal epic made in l963. Forest was actually Lou Degni of the Bronx who after becoming a much in demand physique model of the 50s went on to win Mr. America and Mr. Universe. Although his torso is not seen to its maximum advantage in ""Lion,"" you should see him in ""Kindar the Invulnerable"" and ""Mole Men versus Hercules."" He's like a heroic god with a beautifully chiseled face, a sensuous, sensitive personae and more human-like that his cohort Steve Reeves. Forest stopped making his series of highly successful musclemen epics in the mid-60s to study opera and today still teaches singing and lives in Los Angeles. What a waste! At least we still have his thorougly enjoyable epics such as ""Son of Samson"" and ""Hercules versus the Barbarians"" to remember that they used to have real, mighty men who possessed not only extraordinary male beauty but phenomenal torsoes to go along with them",1174867200,,1057,4.75

8221838,4,B000W93YC0,"Seriously, I'd give it 3 stars but I have to bump it up to four. How can I not add a star for the entire battle plan of ""We'll surprise them surprising us surprising them"" strategy near the end. And the even greater strategy of ""No, I will fight to the end! Sound the retreat!"" ? Otherwise, this is a typical sword and sandal with a bit better story and acting than most for the time. Mark Forest is heroic as always.",1498348800,2,417,4.097560975609756

8221841,2,B000W93YC0,"This is not about ""Hercules being heroic in ancient Greece"".  This is about some guy named Aryan (sp?) rescuing Helen of Troy/Sparta in ancient Egypt.  I was disappointed by the deception in the description.

I was not impressed with the hero as he was not particularly muscular or handsome as presented.  And Helen was not more beautiful than some of the other ladies in this.

The fight scenes were incredibly hoakie, but this was an Italian film from the '60s, after all.  And it would qualify as a fantasy piece because you have to fantasize real violence over top of the fake fights and battles

Having watched it I wouldn't watch it again, nor would I recommend it as a Hercules movie.",1472169600,,691,4.614754098360656
