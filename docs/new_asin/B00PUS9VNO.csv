8689339,2,B00PUS9VNO,"This is another urban crime film. Two things separate this from the rest: 1) it is not in Atlanta or Detroit and 2) There are 7 musical rap pieces that interrupt the plot.

Big C (Shake da Mayor) and D (Diego Redd) are pot dealers in Fresno and not Bakersfield their rival. When a member of D's gang gets hit, Big C is taking the blame in the streets. So in order to tell the story we get a two week flashback. There is a twist, but only because it was decided to show us something that never happened as if it did.

The acting was as bad as a 50 Cent film with cops being the worse. The film had the urban buttons: music, ""you feel me"" ""Ax 'em"" ""frequent N-word"" and a whole line of new baseball caps from Colorado to Pittsburgh. The production quality was as good or better than what is coming out of Atlanta, but the action wasn't there.
