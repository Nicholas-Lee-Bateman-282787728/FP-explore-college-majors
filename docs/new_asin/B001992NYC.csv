3428816,4,B001992NYC,"I absolutely LOVE Hazel!!!!  I thought I had this season but I didn't......I have them all now except for the final which was different since Dorothy and Mr. B left the show. :(  Bummer.  I have enjoyed this very much but there were a few glitches in the first DVD.......but not quite sure if it was some foreign object like fuzz or a hair or something in my DVD player or the DVD itself.  I checked the DVD out and it ""looked"" fine.........but I totally love it anyway.  It was actually a birthday present so that made it even better because I didn't have to pay for it myself. :P",1433548800,2,581,4.245454545454545
3428817,5,B001992NYC,"The very first change we see this season is that it is in Color. There are/were three different ""Opening Credits""Hiree first one is/was the ""Cookies Opening"". It's the second ""Cookies Opening"", in Color. The first one was in Season 1: Episode 6 - ""What'll We Watch Tonight?"", which was filmed to promote RCA COLOR TELEVISION SETS. I read that they were being sold from $1,200 - $1,500. The second COLOR ""Cookies Opening"" version is different from the first one. In the first one Harold, after smelling the cookies, skips backwards into the house. On the second one, after he smells the cookies, he turns to his left and runs back toward the house. On the second Opening Credit we see the ""Football Opening"". And the
tused.  Opening Credit is the ""Groceries Opening"". Originally I was going to describe each ""Credit Opening"" in detail, but I didn't want to spoil it
for anyone who haven't seen this season. So before I continue maybe I had better mention that my review may contain some spoilers for some
fans. But I hope that it clears up some questions for others. The ""Cookies Opening"" in this season is only on the first episode. The ""Football
Opening"" continues from episodes two to twenty-four. For the last eight episodes, The ""Groceries Opening"" is used. The Music Theme also
changed for this season. There was another more subtle change, except it was with some of the cast members. Not the show. Shirley Booth:
Hazel Burke, Don DeFore: George, and John Newton: Stan Blake, all seemed slimmer. At least Three Storylines were dropped after this season,
right along with their characters. I'll pick this up after I discuss my interpretations of each episode, below.

Episode 1: ""Hazel's Cousin"" - After Hazel's Cousin ""Sybil's"" Wedding Invitation is sabatoged, it's up to Sybil to save the day.
Episode 2: ""Rosie's Contract"" - George draws up a contract for Rosie's Employer to insure Rosie's Services, which makes Hazel believe she
should secure her future with one, too.
Episode 3: ""We've Been So Happy Till Now"" - When George and Dorothy are having a riff Hazel steps in to try to fix things up between them, which messes up her date with ""Fulton"", The Milkman.
Episode 4: "" How To Lure An Epicure"" - Hazel enlist her friends to help promote a restaurant that a ""Food Critic"" isn't favoring.
Episode 5: ""Barney Hatfield, Where Are You?"" - Hazel's inquiring to Barney's Supervisor about his not being at work almost gets him fired.
Episode 6: ""A Four-Bit Word To Chew On"" - Hazel and George, competing with each other for ""The Top Word Of The Day"", infuriates Mr. Griffin,
because he doesn't have any Formal Education.
Episode 7: ""Hazel's Tax Deduction"" - Hazel gets George audited she tells the I.R.S. that she is worth more than ten percent.
Episode 8: ""Mr. ""B"" On The Bench"" - Hazel blabs to everyone that George is going to be a Judge. Of course George hadn't made up his mind to accept the position. (NOTE: The liner in my purchase read: ""Mr B On The Beach"". I'm sure that was a typo.)

Episode 9: ""License To Wed"" - Hazel uses her form of ""Psychology"" to change Eddie's and Nancy's minds about getting married before they
finish College.
Episode 10: ""Genie, With The Light Brown Lamp"" - Harold is moping around because ""Smiley"" got lost. So when Hazel tells him the ""Aladdin's Lamp"" story, and he sees what he thinks is ""Aladdin's Lamp"" in ""Charlie's Antique Shop"" no one can make him believe that it is only a ""Gravy
Boat. (This was the show's second ""Thanksgiving Day Episode)
Episode 11: ""The Natural Athlete"" - George, tired of listening to Hazel brag about how good she is at ""Bowling"", makes him decide to practice the sport again so that he can compete with her in the "" Weekly Bowling Contest"".
Episode 12: ""New Man In Town"" - Hazel and Rosie compete for the same fella, putting Hazel's relationship with ""Mitch Brady"" in trouble. (Robert Lowery - ""Pablo"" smokes more on this one and only episode that he appeared in than anyone else does on the entire series.)
Episode 13: ""Herbert For Hire"" - ""The Johnson's"" are in trouble, financially. So Hazel wants George to help him find suitable employment.
Episode 14: ""Hazel And The Lovebirds"" - When ""Deirdre"" tries again to interfere with Eddie's and Nancy's relationship, Hazel, again shows her that she doing the wrong thing.
Episode: 15: ""Top Secret"" - ""Stan Blake's"" daughter ""Mavis"" accidentally picks up some ""Secret Documents"" that were delivered to ""Senator Sterling"". So The Senator and his Aide track down the documents through a comedy maze of what he remembered of Hazel's conversation, during their visit to his hotel room.
Episode 16: ""The Sunshine Girls Quartet"" - Hazel and the other ""Sunshine Girls chance to audition to sing in a contest is in jeopardy when Mr. Griffin's Birthday Party falls on the same night as the audition. (NOTE: Jean Willes plays ""Miss Dunbar"", who is in town for the auditions. She is sporting a very becoming Platinum Color Hair, which shows up on ""Deirdre"" on some later episodes in this season. I wonder did she get the idea from Jean Willes.)

Episode: 17: ""A Good Example For Harold"" - The Baxter's examples for telling the truth almost cost George a client.
Episode: 18: ""Hazel's Highland Fling"" - Mr. Griffin, not happy with his cook, enlist George help to get rid of her. But Hazel, after meeting her, decides to help her to find the man whom she is to marry.
Episode 19: ""Ain't Walter Nice?"" - Hazel's Nephew, Walter causes George to have some suspicious thoughts because of his behavior.
Episode 20: ""Mr. Griffin Throws A Wedding"" - Mr. Griffin's interference in his Nephew Pete's Wedding Plans causes a riff between Pete and his fiancee, Maggie.
Episode 21: ""Hazel And The Stockholder's Meeting"" - Constant maintenance on a brand new Vacuum Cleaner irritates Hazel, making her attend a Stockholder's Meeting, with the affective Vacuum Cleaner in tow.
Episode 22: ""Hazel's Day Off"" - Hazel runs into a client of George who doesn't have a clue how to relax, until he spends an entire day with her.
Episode 23: ""I've Been Singing All My Life"" - Hazel tries to enter ""Deirdre's Talent Show"", but Deirdre doesn't intend to allow anyone who is not of ""The Right Class"" into her Talent Show.
Episode 24: ""The Fire's Never Dead, When The Ashes Are Red"" - Hazel accidentally finds out who the woman is whom George's Law Professor is still in love with and devises a way to get them together.

Episode 25: ""Hazel's Navy Blue Tug-Boats"" - Hazel's trip to the ""Shoe Store"" turns into a ""Trip Of Adventures"", including bringing home a lost girl.
Episode 26: ""The Hazel Walk"" - Hazel doesn't want the area where she loves to hike to become a highway, so she invites some of ""The City Officials"" to come on a hike to prove it should be preserved.
Episode 27: ""Hazel Digs A Hole For Herself"" - Hazel convinces George's mother to become a Professional Gardener, which displeases both George and Deirdre. (Deirdre's hair is still lightened on this episode.)
Episode 28: ""Hazel Sounds Her ""A"" - When Hazel can't convince George to help get a ""Female Violinist"" reinstated to the ""Symphony Orchestra"", Hazel appeals to his wife with some very interesting ""News"".
Episode 29: ""Hazel's Luck"" - Hazel's beliefs in ""Chain Letters"" and ""Good Luck Charms"" has her believing that a torn up chain letter is causing some welcomed mishaps.
Episode 30: ""Oh, My Aching Back"" - George's competing with Hazel causes him to hurt himself.
Episode 31: ""Maid Of The Month"" - Hazel gets named as ""The Maid Of The Month"", secretly set up by Mr. Griffin.
Episode 32: ""So Long, Brown Eyes"" - Hazel's ""First Love"" breezes into town, and unexpectedly proposes. But Hazel's loyalty to ""The Baxters"" gives her second thoughts.

I do wish Amazon would state that in there description of the show, so that those of us who need that feature can make an informed decision before purchasing. I don't understand why so many companies who are placing these shows, especially the older shows on DVD, & with having an older audience don't make that feature available, you don't have to use the feature if you don't want to.

She is a simple woman who isn't afraid to speak her mind.  She is very wise and befriends everyone.  Shirley Booth is the actress who plays Hazel and she's perfect for the part ... I have to remind myself that she's just acting because the part seems so natural for her.  She is either thinking up another scheme or is helping a neighbor in need.,1391040000,2,500,4.177083333333333

3428924,5,B001992NYC,"As a child, I remember loving this show, along with the other classics of the late 1950s and 1960s. Although too young to remember some of them, I was old enough to remember Hazel. The show revolves around the adventures of this extraordinary Housekeeper/Maid and her uncanny ability to always make things turn out right. The family consists of ""Mr. B"" the attorney and head of the family, although if truth be known, I always felt Hazel was the one in charge. Missy, George's wife, has known Hazel since she was a child and is the perfect complement to her husband. An interior decorator with excellent taste, she and Hazel have a very loving relationship and Missy can be counted on to run interference when Hazel and Mr. B butt heads. Then there is the adorable Harold, better known as ""Sport,"" who is such a sweet little boy who worships Hazel and considers her a hero. The acting is superb and the storylines are anything but sappy. This series proves that wholesome programs have a place in society and with it, there is always a valuable lesson to be learned. Kudos to Shirley Booth, Don DeFore, Whitney Blake and Bobby Buntrock for delivering a beautiful and entertaining story to the viewers in every episode. And while all of them are no longer with us, it is comforting that their brilliance is on record and the days when the simple things were the best can truly live on!",1380499200,,1384,4.607287449392713

Other factors are taken into consideration that determine how many stars are given, such as story lines, characters, set designs, eye appeal, etc. but none of them matter at all to me if I cannot understand the lines.  I'm hard of hearing and it's difficult for me to understand the first time, so I'm not going to spend hours on end trying to understand the spoken dialogues included.  I have more important things to do.

I am beyond appalled with Shout!'s decision to leave out the subtitles.  Re-release the set WITH English captions/subtitles, and I'll order it, come back and change my rating with what may be a better review.  Thank you.",1359590400,2,723,4.653543307086614

While the content in season 2 is intact and still great to watch, it was disappointing that there was no color correction in this season.  Some episodes look to have had been done with a video camera capturing the video on a bed sheet.  Others just look like a period video freshly pulled out of Grandma's attic.

Sony released season one.  Second season was released through Shout Factory.  They have done better work that this!  Please find a professional telecine transfer machine!

The color, sound and print quality are not consistent from episode to episode.  Even most of the episodes themselves vary in quality from moment to moment.  There is no laugh track on over half of the episodes.  It seems to me that the original film was in very bad shape and I think Shout Factory did the best they could without getting too deep in restoration costs.

Even with these faults it is still very watchable.  I am happy with the result of this DVD set and I will enjoy watching it many times, along with the first season.  Hazel is all about God, Country and Family.  Add a large heap of common decency and this is a great TV show from the last days of Hollywood making shows worth watching.

I barely remember this show from my childhood, but the characters are likeable and the writing very good.  The black and white resolution was also excellent.  BUT when I received Season 2, the shows are in uneven color, the prints are not consistently clean, and there is no laugh track.  I realize you don't need a laugh track to tell you when to laugh, but I like to watch these shows as they were originally presented. The Lucy Show's sharp and brilliant color has spoiled me.

In Hazel's words, she is a ""domestic engineer who works for Mr. B, Missy and little Harold"". But she runs the household. As brassy as she is compassionate, she loves her kitchen and her family. And takes pride in being regional bowling champion. Her interactions with family, friends, etc. are priceless. Hazel is warmhearted and her actions always ring true.

Shirley Booth was one of the premiere talents of the 20th century.  She won the ""Triple Crown of Acting,"" i.e. Tony Awards, Acadamy Award, and Emmy Awards.  If you like the classic situation commedies of the 1960's, you will love this show.  The relationship she has with the family's young son is very touching and endearing.

I notice that Sony company actually released season 1 which does include close captions, and I couldn't wait to begin watching the following season, especially since it's in color.
Why Shout! Factory decided to forgo this important option to MANY viewers is beyond me. It's also quite upsetting that I am unable to watch these 32 color episodes i've been anticipating so much. Well, I can technically watch them, but i'd really have no idea what the heck was going on without captions or subtitles.

""Hazel"" the Complete Season 2 is a delight, aside from one problem.  The video and audio quality of the episodes here are a mixed bag.  Little, if any, work went in to remastering these episodes.  In fact, the video sample provided by Amazon is indicative of the quality we're talking about.  Surely the price point reflects this.  Lots of inconsistent colors, lines, pops and dirt are present on the episodes however unless you are an absolute purist, these shouldn't get in the way of your enjoyment. My initial thoughts were this quality was the way it looked in reruns on CBN back in the 80s.  Is this is a good thing?  I don't know. I'm guessing this is pretty much as good as its going to get AV wise but potential buyers might want to consider this before purchasing.

3429094,5,B001992NYC,"I've been waiting for this and will buy - can't wait to enjoy it. I bought Season One years ago and have been waiting and waiting for them to release the next season. Seriously, I love Hazel. She's my fav.",1321142400,31,205,4.15
3429095,4,B001992NYC,"""Hazel's"" second season originally aired for 32 episodes during the 1962-63 TV season on NBC and the Peacock Network had the distinction of running the first prime-time sitcom In Living Color!

While Season One was great in its own right (and placing #4 in the Nielsen's, its highest ranking of the five-year run), ""Hazel"" absolutely sparkled in color and this is how most fans remember it.

It's fun to see the wonderful sets with their early '60s/Kennedy era decor, be it that cozy breakfast nook or the tasteful living room or the masculine decor of Mr B's den.

""Hazel"" is a time capsule of when ladies wore hats and gloves to go shopping, sales clerks were called just that, and everyone was polite and said ""Yes, Ma'am"", ""No, Sir"" and ""Please"" and ""Thank-you"". These episodes only underscore how crass, selfish and automated society has become in 45 years.

Shirley Booth is absolutely loveable in the role. Every line reading and reaction is perfect, whether she's chuckling while telling an exasperated Mr. B her latest joke, or trying to mask her disappointment and hurt when she's insensitively left out of a dear cousin's wedding. Not even Bobby Buntrock's over-enthusiastic line readings can spoil the show.

Fans have waited over half a decade for this show to continue on DVD. Shout Factory has done a wonderful job once again. **NOTE** See the screen grabs I posted in the Images section of this product. I don't get Antenna TV (which has been running the show lately) but the episodes look much brighter and colorful than I remember seeing them on Family Channel and WWOR back in the 1990s, although they are not remastered and there are blemishes and lines here and there on the prints. There are no abrupt endings on the opening and closing credits like there was in syndication and the original Screen Gems logo is present. The insert lists the episode titles, descriptions and original airdates.

Let's all support this release so Seasons 3-5 come out as quickly as ""Dennis the Menace"" did (all four seasons in under a year). **UPDATE** Season 3 will be released May 15, 2012.

A BIG thank-you to Shout! for finally making it happen. ""It's gonna be a doozy!"".

Four Stars because the prints are not restored like they could have been.",1320710400,100,2254,4.8062015503875966

The first season was great but for me, this show was never better than it was in vibrant, early '60s color. In fact, at the time, ""Hazel"" was the only TV sitcom being telecast that way. Even Lucy didn't go full color on-air until the fall of 1965!

Shout! Factory could do an amazing job with this series, if Sony would just let go of the reins and license it out to them. And I bet Shout! would put out at least two seasons per year. We could have the remaining four in less than two years time. After all, they completed ""The Patty Duke Show"" with all three seasons out in a scant 11 months!

3429403,5,B001992NYC,"I so wish theyd release all the Hazel series. I bought the first one and have watched it over and over and over and I still enjoy it. I love the old ""clean"" black and whites with good humor and good times like Hazel, Father knows Best, Andy Griffith, Good Times, Barney Miller, Alice. I miss what TV used to be and am saddened by whats it become. Please bring more of the old shows back.  So with that said...MORE HAZEL PLEASE!!! SIGN ME UP.",1215648000,12,441,4.188235294117647

I'm taking this offer from Amazon to sign up for an email notification as a good sign. Sony, if you are listening, please release Season Two soon!",1213228800,13,349,4.384615384615385

8272929,5,B001992NYC,"I was introduced to this show not long ago on fetv channel. I'm not sure why Season 1 is so outrageously priced, but this is a must have series. I love watching Hazel! She's the most lovable busybody I've ever seen. Really wish they hadn't changed the actors out in the last season, but I could watch the earlier episodes over and over.

8272930,5,B001992NYC,Love Hazel. Great show.,1497916800,,23,5.0
8272931,5,B001992NYC,"This show came out about 4 years before my birth, and I'm forever grateful to SHOUT, for putting these fantastic shows
Available for the public to buy and cherish!! I started with season 3, found season 1 at a great price, and now enjoying season 2  ( by far the funniest and best!) but really all of these shows were very well written, with challenging subjects: the idea of a maid (Hazel) many times outsmarts, outwits, her employer
(Mr. B) a respectable lawyer, with a circle of ""high societies"" and extremely wealthy people, Hazel always figures a way to bring the snobs down to earth, and always forgives those her give her a bad turn. Purely enjoyable for the entire family!! It's too bad TV Land doesn't air shows like this anymore!! Also When I was very sick, and live alone, Hazel shows helped me through that, and I was so grateful I had those to ease those horrible days and nights! Hazel helps me sleep at night too!! :) This show is A+
It also makes me wonder what the outside world was like in 1962?? An the actors all did a terrific job, God Bless them!! Also if your a family that cares about what your children watch, Hazel is a fantastic role model, with pure clean family values, and delightful humor, the whole family can enjoy anytime!!

8272933,5,B001992NYC,We love this show! It is a very family oriented series as were several 1960's shows. A LOT better than what is on tv now.,1488844800,2,121,3.88
