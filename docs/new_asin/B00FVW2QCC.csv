8618772,5,B00FVW2QCC,"Just streamed this from Netflix. Now I'm here to buy it. I read the complains about the bypassing of disco, etc.; however, I think that's missing the point. This is the history of hardware analog synthesizers, not the history of the music per se. I guess this isn't for everyone. But to me, it is pure candy. GREAT! GREAT! GREAT!",1461801600,2,329,4.5
8618773,2,B00FVW2QCC,"They skipped over disco, post punk, new wave.  But did mention that punk music temorarily set back synths.
How do you slip over those.genres?
It started out well enough.",1441497600,,169,4.827586206896552
8618774,4,B00FVW2QCC,"I feel like ""THE GORN"" covered it well in his review.  It's clearly biased.  I saw one documentary where Wendy Carlos (then, Walter Carlos) was well mentioned in the pioneering work done.  It has a severe slant against the idea of ""that black and white keyboard"" being attached to it.  It's funny, because it appears like the artists themselves who were commercially successful at various points in their careers had rather balanced views on both styles of synths.  But then the Yamaha DX7 came up...  LOL",1440288000,3,505,4.813953488372093
8618775,5,B00FVW2QCC,"Well shot. Interesting. If you're into synthesizers and synthesizer-related history, this would be a wise choice. Glad I purchased it.",1398038400,3,134,5.75
8618776,1,B00FVW2QCC,"If you are hping for real synth history about Numan, NIN etc.. you will be diappointed.  This DVD is for modular synth nerds and that is it.  Not much about synth music music of the late 70s or 80s, so if you hope for synth band history forget it, very sad sorry.  I was hoping to see bands that changed music with synthesizers but all you will see are modular amateur modular synth nerds, very boring in my opintion.  The begining is good after that it sucks don't waste your money.  4 hours of modular synth nerds.  No real history about bands that made it popular.",1393545600,6,567,4.30188679245283
8618777,3,B00FVW2QCC,"The score and sound quality are amazing! Also really cool to see synth models I would never have the opportunity to see otherwise. You get 4 hours of coverage for a very reasonable price. I enjoyed the show. ""However"" I have subtracted 2 stars for the unwarranted and unnecessary bashing of Wendy Carlos. Who happens to be many peoples first exposure to synthesizers.  Also I believe the subject could have been shown and celebrated without putting every other type of synthesis down.",1386460800,8,484,4.902439024390244
8618778,1,B00FVW2QCC,Way 2 many replays on horrible moves. There is no point in it. Do not buy.,1263513600,,74,3.6875
8618779,4,B00FVW2QCC,"The Best of Deathmatch Wrestling Vol 1, in my opinon I think it was good DVD but there are few bad things in the DVD that ruin the experience

The Bad: To Many Replay's it gets very annoying after a while, The Commentators are annoying I wish I could have turned them off, and not all matches are what I would call  Deathmatch's

The Good: There are many great matches on here, some very extreme matches, the bonus matches are especially good, and some interesting easter egg matches

Overall: I say this is a good DVD but its just not as good as I had hoped I actually enjoyed the bonus matches more then I did the main matches, but if are a Hardcore wrestling fan then buy but just don't expect every single match to be really extreme",1200614400,3,736,4.273381294964029
8618780,5,B00FVW2QCC,"This is a great DVD! Many of you will not know the names of the wrestlers, but you will see amazing wrestling tied in with great hardcore matches. Every weapon was used in the matches. 3 hours of enjoyment awaits. During the matches many times we will see a replay of a huge move, 5 or 6 times during a match. It works out ok because you never miss any of the action.

I was impressed that they had some many quality matches. The DVD has 12 matches, that last 3 hours. You get a few bonus XPW matches that are just great. I cant recommend this DVD enough. I paid $12 for it and shipping and would easily pay double that.

GET THIS DVD YOU WILL NOT BE DISSAPOINTED.",1167868800,6,664,4.1
8618781,4,B00FVW2QCC,"I'm not sure what I' should think about the DVD. My greatest problem is the minor quality of this DVD. The wrestlers are quite good, especially Lufisto is very interesting. There is a lot of typical high fly action and a lot of Lucha libre. But there is only one single match and  a lots of Tag Team bouts. My problem is, i don't know much of these guys and there were no psychological moments. There was no moment I could say "" oh my god"".

Hope you get my message, because I'm from germany.",1167782400,,492,4.168421052631579
