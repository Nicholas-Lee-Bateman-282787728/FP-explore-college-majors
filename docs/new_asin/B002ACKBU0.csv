3883667,5,B002ACKBU0,"""The Patty Duke Show"" only aired for three seasons on ABC but its influence on classic television is timeless. Although not as popular as ""The Lucy Show"" or ""Dick Van Dyke"", ""The Patty Duke Show"" will always have a soft spot for viewers who watched early sixties sitcoms because of the innocence of the series and the wonderful acting chops of Duke. This boxset features all 36 episodes of the first year that aired from 1963-1964 as well as the never-before seen pilot. That first season was a highly rated one with ""The Patty Duke Show"" finishing the year at #18, a high number considering ABC was still regarded as the third network. The show was typical sitcom fluff featuring Patty Duke (fresh off an Oscar-winning performance for ""The Miracle Worker"") playing identical cousins Patty and Cathy who were polar opposites: Patty was the outgoing, devilish one while Cathy was Scottish, shy, sullen, and extremely smart. Contemporary audiences will love the show as it's filled with good writing aimed at a teenage audience. No murders, rapes, or gunfire: just an American sitcom that originally aired when the world was a bit more tamed. A few years ago I read Duke's powerful and honest autobiography called ""Call Me Anna"" and was amazed to learn that Duke was very unhappy while doing the series. She accuses her then managers, a married couple, of controlling and mentally abusing her, going so far as pushing her family out of her life. To make matters worse when Patty Duke went to collect her royalties from her show she was shocked to discover that most of her earnings had been squandered by her money-grabbing managers. She made over $3000 per episode on ""The Patty Duke Show"", which was an enormous sum of money for a sitcom child star of the 1960's to make, so Miss Duke should have had a nice nest egg to sit on after the series wrapped. Patty also stated that she was having severe mental problems (she was diagnosed as being manic depressive later in life) while filming the sitcom, but after watching these episodes one would never know she was suffering from a private hell. This is a true testament to the kind of actress she was. A true professional, Patty Duke has never let her problems interfere with her work. This boxset will also offer new interviews with the surviving stars of the show including Duke herself. According to Shout!(the studio releasing the series) ""The Patty Duke Show"" looks glorious as the prints have been remastered from the original United Artists archives. The show was filmed in glorious black and white and a total of 104 shows were made. Hopefully all three seasons will be released.",1250812800,3,2636,4.782894736842105
3883668,5,B002ACKBU0,"I can't possibly top what others have written about this fabulous show, but all I know is I'm SO glad to find out that it's finally coming to DVD. I was just 10 years old when I watched The Patty Duke Show, and it has always been a favorite. The theme song was unforgettable, but the most remarkable thing about the show was its star. Patty Duke was simply AMAZING in this show, playing two very distinctive characters. She is totally believable, and you really do feel as if you're watching two different people. Her performances are quite remarkable. It's no wonder that on the cover art of this DVD set it states ""The Patty Duke Show"" Starring Patty Duke. She deserves two mentions for the two characters she plays. Great fun and what a talented girl. ""The Patty Duke Show"" is that rare breed of sitcom; genuinely funny and absolutely charming; a classic show that will delight the young and the young at heart. Looking forward to this!",1250640000,4,939,4.562130177514793

3883670,5,B002ACKBU0,"Like everyone else here (and elsewhere!) I'm absolutely OVER the moon about the news of this release!  If any show deserves to be made available to the masses, this is certainly one at the top of the list.

Tuning in, you'll see a very well-crafted show that focused on situations and people as opposed to jokes.  I once read somewhere that The Patty Duke Show did for teenagers what the Dick Van Dyke Show did for sitcoms in general and I can see what the writer meant.  The comedy and characters are genuine, the performances are grounded in reality, meaning you'll view the characters acting and reacting in believeable ways that aren't racheted up in the usual sitcom styles.

One thing that is quite amazing about the character of Patty is that she is not at all a 2 dimentional cut-out. Amazingly, the writers had Patty as a person who could be at various turns, kind, manipulative, sweet, egotistical, nice, a fire storm, caring, fierce, vulnerable...in other words, Patty was played like a human being with faults galore but virtuous to the core. Cathy too (especially during the first 2 seasons) could be someone to contend with. For the most part, she was the sweet one for sure, but she was also the practical realist who was the one who kept Patty grounded with loving reprimands when needed.  On rare occasions, she could take a rather unexpected turn and outmaneuver Patty when the situation called for it with astonishing results! Above all, neither girl was a wallflower- each was resourceful and never ever played to the idea of a girl being helpless without a guy around, in fact, they often were the ones to take charge of situations and if all else failed, well, Mom and Dad were there to step in- and isnt't that what family is all about?

What I found amazing is despite the comments I read in Ms. Duke's autobiography about her acting on the show, the young actress does a incredible job of creating two distinct characters.  Even in the smallest details- such as how each one expresses gladness or anger, Ms. Duke never allows one trait of one character to cary across to the other.  Watching movies or other shows featuring one actor playing two characters, many times the performances come across more of as a gimmick than anything, but you never get the impression when watching Ms. Duke switching between playing Cathy and Patty.

A note about the split-screen effects. Too many times people will comment on how limited or ""pre-historic"" the technology was then and how you can easily detect the effects of the split screen.  Well, the split screen effect wasn't anything new by the time The Patty Duke Show aired. In fact, the whole double exposure method which allowed one person to play multiple parts had been in existence for quite some time, being used in movies a good 20 or so years before this show.

If anything, the effect is even more impressive now when you consider all the planning it took to ensure shadows from one characters movements didn't cross the ""barrier"" of the shot. Notice also in many of those scenes, Patty and Cathy are sitting at the same table, or on the same bench and in one shot from the 2nd season, there is an incredible set up that had Cathy sitting on a chair and Patty, at one point places a hand on the back of the same chair- it makes you wonder if they had to bolt those pieces of furniture down somehow- if anything moved even one fraction, the viewer would easily note the chair being higher on one side of the frame than the other!

I hope the release of the DVD will bring a whole new shipload of fans to this stellar show!",1247011200,34,3598,4.585669781931464
3883671,5,B002ACKBU0,"What an unbelievable year 2009 has been for putting THE BEST 1960's television shows on dvd sets, and now added to this list FINALLY is ""The Patty Duke Show""! Previously this year, Shout! Factory released ""Peyton Place"" and ""Room 222"", and the quality of the film on these two sets is like night and day. I contacted Shout! to find out if this ""Patty Duke Show"" dvd set will be beautifully restored and clean like ""Peyton Place"" or if it will be fuzzy and grainy like ""Room 222"". Shout! said they are putting out a good print of ""The Patty Duke Show"", and I hope ""good"" means really good like in Peyton Place good! They would not be more specific about the quality, so we will see when it's released on September 29, 2009.

""The Patty Duke Show"" was tailor made for oscar-winning Patty Duke to play two teenage identical cousins going through High School together in Brooklyn Heights, New York. Patty Duke plays Patty Lane, who lives with her newspaper editor father, Martin Lane (William Schallert), her mother Natalie Lane (Jean Byron) and her younger brother Ross Lane (Paul O'Keefe). Patty has a steady boyfriend Richard Harrison (Eddie Applegate). Patty's father Martin, has a brother Kenneth Lane, who is a globe-trotting journalist, who happens to have a daughter named Cathy Lane (Patty Duke) who not only looks exactly like Patty , but is Patty's exact age. Cathy comes from Scotland to live with her Uncle Martin's family in Brooklyn Heights, New York. Even though Cathy and Patty look alike, sophisticated Cathy is nothing like her cousin Patty, who is the typical American teenager in 1963.

""The Patty Duke Show"" ran for only 3 seasons from 1963 to 1966. The show featured some great guest stars over these years, some of my favorites being Frankie Avalon (in this first season), Chad and Jeremy, Sammy Davis Jr., Sal Mineo, Robert Goulet, Troy Donahue and Paul Lynde (also in this first season). Patty Duke played both cousins Patty and Cathy Lane and the technology used for Patty Duke to play 2 people on the screen at the same time, was quite primitive in 1963. They would shoot in split screen when the cousins were together facing the camera, and you can see the ""line"" where the two films are spliced together in almost every shot like this. A double was used when the cousins were talking face to face, so you would see Patty Duke's face and the double's back of her head. In a few of these first seasons episodes, the face of the double was accidentally briefly glimpsed! Martin Lane, Patty's father played by William Schallert, was such a well liked tv father, he was voted #39 in TV Guide's 50 Greatest Dad's of All Time. The show's unaired Pilot premiered in 1963 and was set in San Francisco, instead of Brooklyn Heights, New York, and father Martin Lane and brother Ross Lane were played by different actors. In this unaired pilot, Mark Miller played Martin and Charles Herbert played Ross. Sadly, even though Shout! Factory advertised everywhere that this first season would include the rare Pilot, they did not include it, and I hope this was a bad oversight and that they keep to their word and include it in Season 2!

BONUS MATERIAL INCLUDED:
Shout! Factory has confirmed that they are including a nice retrospective featurette on this First Season, which is based on the brand new interviews they just finished with the entire cast, all except for ""Mom"" Natalie Lane played by the late Jean Byron.

Shout! Factory also confirmed that the episodes are not cut up or shortened, as they are running the original full 25 minutes per episode.
I originally watched ""The Patty Duke Show"" when it premiered in 1963, and I enjoy it just as much now as I did back then! Even with the primitive 1963 special effects of seeing Patty's double's back of her head (and a glimpse of her face in this first season), and the splicing lines on the middle of the film, the show still holds up today with it's family warmth and charm. A huge thank you Shout! Factory for finally putting the long-awaited and wonderful Patty Duke Show on dvd!",1246492800,45,6964,5.296094459582198
3883672,5,B002ACKBU0,"Celebrations should be thrown at local `shake shops' with rock 'n roll blasting on the juke box for the first-ever DVD release of The Patty Duke Show!

The series was one of the best and most beloved Classic TV comedies from the 1960's. Shout! Factory is continuing its string of great Classic TV releases (including Father Knows Best, My Three Sons and The Donna Reed Show) by presenting the complete first season of this iconic series on DVD for the first time.

The Patty Duke Show aired on ABC beginning Sept. 18, 1963. It lasted 105 episodes spanning three seasons - all in glorious black and white!

One year before, Ms. Duke had won an Academy Award for her portrayal of the blind, deaf and mute Helen Keller in The Miracle Worker (at the time, she was the youngest person to have won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress). As a result, she was chosen for her own self-titled vehicle, which featured her in not one, but two prominent roles.

The series followed Patty Lane (Ms. Duke), a `normal' 60's teenager living in the Brooklyn Heights section of New York City, who loves boys, ice cream, and sleep-overs. Her father is the managing editor of the New York Chronicle. In the unaired Pilot, her ""identical cousin"" Cathy Lane (also portrayed by Duke), whose father also works for the Chronicle as a foreign correspondent, arrives in the U.S. from Scotland to live with Patty's family and attend secondary school.

The series was extremely popular with both teens and their parents, turning Ms. Duke into an early teenaged idol.

As an adult, Ms. Duke has documented her long struggle with mental illness. The brilliant star sadly disclosed that she also suffered abuse during the years this series was produced. As a result, there is a genuine darkness beneath the fictitious veneer of these sweetly, innocent episodes. It is a true testament to her talent and very hard work that none of that was conveyed on screen. In my opinion, this series should still be enjoyed to honor her performances, for which Ms. Duke rightly received an Emmy nomination. (She is also the former wife of wonderful actor John Astin. The couple's son, Sean Astin, is also an actor.)

All 36 half-hour episodes and the unaired pilot are expected to be included in this DVD boxed set, presented on six discs (to provide background material as needed, clips from the Pilot had been utilized through ""flash-back"" scenes describing Cathy's arrival in the U.S.).

Special features are expected to include interviews with cast members, plus a featurette on the series. The show was created by William Asher, who also created and produced Bewitched; and Sidney Sheldon, who created a host of thrillers but also I Dream of Jeannie in the 1960's and Hart to Hart in the 1990's.

In addition to Ms. Duke, the core cast included William Schallert, who played Patty's father, Martin Lane; Jean Byron as Patty's mother, Natalie Lane; Paul O'Keefe portrayed Patty's sister, Ross Lane; and Eddie Applegate, who portrayed Patty's boyfriend, Richard Harrison in 70 episodes.

Schallert has one of the longest careers in TV and also film, and remains active in his 80's. (Incredibly, there was almost no hit TV show - in all genres - from the 60s through the 80s that he did not appear.)

The dual role played by Ms. Duke presented special effects challenges for the low-tech 60's, as they were rarely ever used in sitcoms of the day. (A VERY notable exception was the daytime gothic soap opera, Dark Shadows.)

In each episode of this series, Ms. Duke appeared as both characters in the same frame through the use of a split screen effect. To complement these effects, child actress Rita McLaughlin was used as Ms. Duke's double (almost always seen only from behind).

First Season episodes are: The Pilot; The French Teacher; The Genius; The Elopement; House Guest; The Birds and the Bees Bit; The Slumber Party; The Babysitters; The Conquering Hero; The President; Double Date; The Actress; How to Be Popular; The Song Writers; The Princess Cathy; Christmas Present; Auld Lang Syne; Horoscope; The Tycoons; Author! Author!; The Continental; Let 'Em Eat Cake; Going Steady; Are Mothers People?; The Con Artist; The Perfect Teenager; Chip Off the Old Block; The Wedding Anniversary Caper; Pen Pals; A Slight Case of Disaster; The Friendship Bit; Patty, the Foster Mother; Drop Out; Leave it to Patty; The Little Dictator; The Working Girl; and The Cousins.

""Cousins,"" was the unforgettable series theme. The music was composed by Sid Ramin, while the lyrics that stayed in your head like a causality loop, was written by Robert Wells. For those not old enough to have the song still playing in their aged noggins, here it is:

Meet Cathy, who's lived most everywhere,
From Zanzibar to Barclay Square.

But Patty's only seen the sights
A girl can see from Brooklyn Heights--
What a crazy pair!

But they're cousins,
Identical cousins all the way.
One pair of matching bookends,
Different as night and day.

Where Cathy adores a minuet,
The Ballet Ruses, and crepe Suzette,
Our Patty loves to rock and roll,
A hot dog makes her lose control--
What a wild duet!

Still, they're cousins,
Identical cousins and you'll find,
They laugh alike, they walk alike,
At times they even talk alike--

You can lose your mind,
When cousins - are two of a kind!

Here's hoping the remaining two seasons are quickly released.",1245888000,76,5377,4.848253275109171
3883673,5,B002ACKBU0,"I enjoyed this show very much when I saw it as a teenager in the 60s, and now, watching it again on DVD, I can, without qualification say, I LOVE it. It's very funny, it's evocative of the time period, it's very touching and so heartwarming. I, undoubtedly like many teenage boys,  had a crush on Patty Duke then. Now, I admire her tremendously as an actress, and even more, as person. Her acting in this show is superb every moment she is on screen, and to think she is playing two roles, I have to give her acting two huge thumbs up. It's the sweet, touching moments that I loved the most, I feel. She shows such genuine emotions and I really feel that she wasn't acting when I saw tears in her eyes, and when hugged her parents and said ""I love you.""  Watching the bonus feature of the cast reminiscing about the show, I saw clearly that they all cared about each other; the warm heartfelt feelings they expressed for each other brought tears to my eyes, especially when William Schallert said he felt Patty Duke was the daughter he wished he had had. Patty's family life wasn't the ideal, so when she calls Mr. Schallert  ""Poppo"" in the show, she really meant it. I can't say enough good things about this wonderful show, and have already purchased seasons 2 and 3 and eagerly look forward to watching them. It's sad that Jean Byron (who played Patty's mother), William Schallert and Patty Duke have left us, but their humanity and love live on in this show.",1468972800,4,1462,4.4275092936802976

Oh, yes, he's French.  Age difference does not matter in TV sitcoms?  Gee, it is Funny, so anything goes.  What an innocent age it was.

But, as a pre-teen, I was attracted by some vaguely sexual feeling I still didn't understand, to look at Patty Duke as much as possible, to the point that my fellow prepubescent friends razzed me unmercifully. Today, it's entertaining to see the series whose topical references often went over my head in 1963-4 (LBJ, etc.) with the adult sensibility that allows me to appreciate even the high school world that mystified me then. Lots of surprise guest stars--Sal Mineo!--early in their careers, as well.

3883696,5,B002ACKBU0,"The Patty Duke Show was a unique TV show with the star playing 2 roles; the free-spirited American Patty and her otherwise down to earth British cousin Cathy.  Both characters Patty portrayed were throwbacks to 2 women who got their start in radio and by now were reinventing themselves in their separate and successive careers.  Patty Lane embodied the kind of spirit that harkened back to the days of Corliss Archer whom Janet Waldo portrayed during the 1940's on American radio and Patty was the 1960's version of that radio teenage sweetheart.  (Janet by now was already on her way to a career of cartoon voicing with characters like Judy Jetson, Penelope Pitstop, and Josie [of the pussycats])  Patty's cousin Cathy was also a reminder of another lady who get her start on radio only BBC radio; Cathy displayed the kind of innocence that Petula Clark, while she was just a child, showed during World War II and the immediate years afterward and Cathy would show a similar example during the course of the series.  (Like Janet Waldo in the cartoon voicing field, Petula was about to come into her own in the music industry with hits like Downtown, I Know a Place, and Don't Sleep in the Subway).  The Patty Duke Show itself is fun to watch with Patty being Patty and Cathy being Cathy with Martin Lane looking on.  Patty gets into hot water constantly and for even all her wisdom, Cathy can't do anything about it.  Patty and Cathy...like the 2 other women I mentioned earlier...are 2 of a kind.",1389916800,,1499,4.673003802281369

3883710,4,B002ACKBU0,"Patty Duke has often remarked that her sitcom, in which she played identical cousins, was an eerie foreshadowing of her eventual diagnosis with Manic Depression or ""bipolar"" (ie: the ""twin personalities"").  In THE PATTY DUKE SHOW, the talented actress shines in her dual roles and gives off little evidence of the private hell she was enduring behind the scenes at the time.  That is all documented in Duke's autobiography ""Call Me Anna"" and also outlined by several fellow reviewers here, so there's no need to go into that again in my review.

The youngest actress to win the ""Best Supporting Actress"" Academy Award for her remarkable turn in ""The Miracle Worker"", Patty Duke made another claim to fame in THE PATTY DUKE SHOW, becoming the youngest actress to receive her own self-titled TV series.  THE PATTY DUKE SHOW was an instant ratings success for the ABC, and coupled with it's other strong performer ""The Donna Reed Show"", proved to be quite a powerful pull for family audiences especially.

THE PATTY DUKE SHOW's premise revolved around identical cousins Patty and Cathy Lane.  Patty is the typical American teen, living in Brooklyn Heights with her parents (William Schallert and Jean Byron) and wiseacre younger brother Ross (Paul O'Keefe).  Into this family arrives Patty's Scottish cousin Cathy, whose father's job as a Foreign Correspondant prevents Cathy from having a stable education.  Cathy is cultured, refined, the perfect well-behaved young lady.  She sings opera, speaks several languages fluently and always obliges when Patty doesn't want to do the dishes!  Another plus for Patty is that the two can switch places (in classic ""Parent Trap"" fashion) when either gets into a sticky situation.  What a crazy pair!

The first season of THE PATTY DUKE SHOW isn't my all-time favourite (the second year is where I personally think the show really took off), but the blueprint is laid out, and there's lots of fun to be had.  Highlights include ""Double Date"", where Cathy is knocked flat from having two 'flu shots and Patty must take her place (as well as her own) in a dance contest.  ""The Actress"" sees Patty cast in a highschool production of ""Antony and Cleopatra"", but serious stage jitters set in when she organises for several Hollywood producers to attend the show.  ""Let 'Em Eat Cake"" is a real charmer where the girls accidentally slice into Natalie's prize cake entry and must attempt to bake a replacement.  ""The Princess Cathy"" finds Cathy contemplating marrying into Indian royalty.  Kaye Ballard is the owner of a charm and modeling school in ""The Perfect Teenager""; whilst Kaye's ""Mothers-in-Law"" co-star Roger C. Carmel is a shady publisher when Patty attempts to write her own Francoise Sagan potboiler in ""Author, Author"".

The set comes complete with some recent interviews from the cast.  It's lovely to hear how Patty regards her sitcom family as an extension of her own; and William Schallert speaks of Patty as being ""the daughter of [his] heart"".  For fans old and new alike, THE PATTY DUKE SHOW is back.

3883711,2,B002ACKBU0,"During its first season, the Patty Duke Show was #18 in the Nielsen ratings. Along with The Donna Reed Show (#16), it was one of only two shows on the ABC network to make the Top Twenty. Still it did not win its time slot against NBC's superb, The Virginian. The Patty Duke Show achieved its highest ratings during its first year and they tapered off with each succeeding season.

There is a reason for this, despite the fact that there was little marked difference in the series' approach during these years. People got hip to the fact that the writing was very insipid and increasingly more out of touch with youth as the series dragged on. Not that it was ever that in touch with youth to begin with. The fact that they are still hanging out in a shake shop is stupid enough, but the music they play on the jukebox sounds as if it was from the big band era. And it always seems to be the same song.

Another amusing thing about the show is that Patty's bit-part girlfriends always look years ahead of her in the fashion department. She bobs around with her over-the-top perkiness, stupid flip hair-do and a characterization that is insulting to all teenagers, even then.

Too bad the writing is so awful, because this is a first rate cast trying to work with the horse manure that's shoveled their way. William Schallert has always been one of my favorite character actors. Jean Byron does well with the awful ""doting wife"" material she has to struggle through. Eddie Applegate, despite being in his thirties when the series was shot, is a rather convincing teenager, despite the fact that his character, like all the others, is one-dimensional and unbelievable. Paul O'Keefe bugs me a lot as Ross, the dorky younger brother. I can't stand this guy, but maybe that's a compliment.

Applegate, O'Keefe and Byron added very little to their acting resumes after the show was canceled. This was their high point and it's extremely dated. But dated is what we expected. This show was already dated when it first aired in 1963.

I still remember my older sister watching this tripe on her tiny bedroom TV with Dippity-Do, rollers and a portable hair dryer going. I went to the den and watched The Virginian with my brother and dad.

For the uninitiated and the budget conscious, The Patty Duke Show is running in the wee hours on the THIS-TV network. You might want to DVR your favorite episodes and spare the expense of owning something overly formulaic that you will seldom watch.

I know that other reviewers here are big fans of the show. I love old TV too, and I'm glad Shout Factory put this out. It's great that it's available. But as with a lot of this retro TV, sometimes the fact that an old TV show is finally issued on DVD is more exciting than the show proves itself to be upon viewing.",1270944000,9,2796,4.535714285714286

Now they have a child to think about. I just wonder where the guys are that got them pregnant. The young ladies will be the one who has such a change in their life. The guys just go on like nothing happen. But i blame TV of today like I said sex and more sex. THis is why I love old classic Tv shows. They had morals and clean fun. ANd i keep watching them over and over not much on TV today that I watch. Then they wonder why their ranking is so down. there is people who like the old shows more than you think.

3883717,3,B002ACKBU0,"They laugh alike. They walk alike. At times, they even talk alike. What a crazy pair!
But when identical teen cousins--daffy Patty Lane and demure Cathy Lane--get together, their two different worlds create '60s sitcom at its best. Well maybe not best.
  It's not that The Patty Duke Show: The Complete First Season doesn't hold up, but it simply proves Sidney Sheldon and Bill Asher, the show's creators, didn't always hit a home run. This was Sid's training ground; he'd go on to write 5,678 bestsellers and create the sitcom I Dream of Jeannie. Bill had worked on I Love Lucy---material far superior than this stuff---and he'd later go on to Bewitched and Gidget. Here his work is as good as the material.
  Many of the episodes are dated (crazy!) and the tricks and techniques used to have Cathy/Patty on screen at the same time are noticeable, and at times, annoying.
  Still, there's no denying this is a slice of TV pop culture. By the time the show debuted in 1963, Duke had won an Oscar for her brilliant performance as Helen Keller in The Miracle Worker (1962)---indeed, Patty Duke was the first young star to have a television show named after her.
  In later years, she'd talk candidly about her bipolar disorder, and the signs and hints visible here make one wonder how much of a toll the double roles---and talking to herself!---took on her mind. This is especially when the name ""John Ross,"" the man who was her mentor/manager/guardian unrolls in the credits. Ross worked overtime, carefully monitoring how Duke appeared to the public; she may have looked happy and carefree, but she'd later reveal she was depressed and miserable and felt pressure to always succeed.
  Duke was only 16 when production began, the show was filmed in New York because New York's child labor laws were more liberal than in California, thus allowing Duke to work more hours per day. When Duke turned 18 before filming of the final season began, production was moved to Los Angeles, though the setting of the TV series remained the same Brooklyn Heights neighborhood it had always been.
  Oh yes, before we forget: For the scenes featuring both Patty and Cathy, actress Rita Walter played the back of Patty's or Cathy's head. She can also be seen in several episodes as a background character.
  Oh yes, again: The reason that Patty and Cathy looked exactly alike is because their fathers were identical twins, both played by William Schallert.
  If anything good came out this, it was Duke's bold move, at 18, to nab the role of Nelly O'Hara in the 1967 big-screen version of Jacqueline's Susann's sizzling bestseller Valley of the Dolls.
  Duke played a druggie who was based on the life of Judy Garland, another unhappy child star who had been forced into adulthood and stardom and with whom Duke had more in common than she probably knew at the time.
  Valley of the Dolls was a major flop, but has since gained cult status. It's our fave flick; in fact, we mention it every time we see Patty, who rolls her eyes and groans (cheerfully), ""Oh no! Not again!"")
  Read our interview with Duke here: [...]
  Back to the series. It's fun to take a trip back in time watching various famous folk make appearances . . . some before they actually became famous. Among the guest stars in this set: Frankie Avalon, Phil Foster, John McGiver, John Spencer, David Doyle, George S. Irving, Estelle Parsons, Margaret Hamilton, Roger C. Carmel, Jean-Pierre Aumont and Charles Nelson Reilly and Paul Lynde who were big queens even back then, even before the great unwashed masses knew what ""nelly"" meant. Bette Davis, then playing a double role in the film Dead Ringer (1964), was asked to guest star, but she demanded too much money.
  The box set bonus feature, a look back at The Patty Duke Show, is a tad short and disappointing: William Schallert looks (and sounds) great, Paul O'Keefe (who played Patty's brother Ross) and Eddie Applegate (who played her beau Richard Harrison) are fine, but Duke seems a bit unsure of herself, even now. She does confess that Sheldon recognized something odd about her personality; interestingly since Duke would be diagnosed with bipolar disorder 20 years later.

3883720,5,B002ACKBU0,"I was always deeply in love with Patty Duke. Back when the show was on Nick at Nite in the wee hours of the morning, I was hooked. I used to think about her when I went to bed, and usually would wait for my folks to fall asleep, so I could sneak up and watch her show. She was the hippest chick on TV. And she was twins! What a crazy duet!

Recently I was thrilled to find that some small time HD antenna station around my parts runs the show occasionally, re-sparking my interest in Patty Duke. She's still the coolest. Her cousin Cathy is the brains, but Patty has the go forth attitude that gets the job done! Think about it, that time Patty plagiarised the poem from the poetry book, and sent it into the Jimmy Dean Show. Remember? They almost crumbled under the pressure that they would be caught, and have to serve seven years hard time! But they prevailed, Patty quickly forgot her worries and enjoyed the stardom, once she heard Jimmy Dean mention her name, and sing the song on live TV. (By the way... thats Jimmy Dean! The sausage guy!) Turns out that her act of carelessness actually saved the day! (Something beautiful happened, just as she suspected it would!) The real poet was reunited with his lost love! Only Patty Duke and her strangely identical cousin could cause something like that to happen! Let them work that magic on you too!!!  Anything can happen when cousins are two of a kind!

It was never shown on TV Land, and it probably never will, because they show all the garbage shows from the 90's and the 2000's, and their channel is becoming a joke in my opinion.  I have never met Patty before, but I think she was a very creative, and super actress.  She used to sing once in awhile on the show, and she had a beautiful singing voice, and if I would have been in my teens back when her show was airing on ABC, I would have written her a fan letter every week, and I know I would have had a serious crush on her.  The show had a great cast of Characters surrounding her, William Schallert (her Papoa Martin), Jean Byron (her mom with one of the greatest smiles ever), her brother Ross, her boyfriend Richard, her hated rival Sue Ellen & John McIver as Martin's editor.  There is even an appearance by Phylis Coates as Martin Lanes secretary in the 2 part Christmas episode.  The staff who put this DVD set together did a great job with the audio and video editing, and I give everybody who worked on this a 20+.  I can't wait for Season's 2 & 3 to be released, I'm also waiting for Warner Bros/DC & FOX to get their act together so I can finally see BATMAN again.

3883724,5,B002ACKBU0,"Back in the late 90's when it became clear that the compact nature of DVD's would allow many TV shows to be released in their entirety I have been waiting for this one.

The Patty Duke Show was before my time. I had never heard of it until the late 80's, when it came to Nick At Nite. I had started to watch the channel more and more and developed a liking for older TV. It took about a couple episodes of Patty Duke to completely hook me. So much so I recorded the shows on tape. Since tape was more expensive back then, I kept recorded them in the 6 hour speed.

I was able to get most of the run of the show with the first 2 runs on Nick At Nite. That turned out to be important because after the second run, they went from editing about a minute out of the show to about 3 minutes (from 24 to 22 minutes from the original 25). The more edited versions of the show were the ones that were shown most of the time the show was on Nick At Nite.

And of course, when it came time for Nick At Nite to let go of The Patty Duke Show, it pretty much dropped off the face of the cable universe.

After that, I'd sometimes watch and would trade from those Patty Duke tapes but as my video set ups got better, the tapes looked worse.

Then came DVD and it soon became clear that DVD was a great way to get some more revenue action out of those older shows. I was only happy to get them as they came out. Still, there was one show that was always passed over.

That would be The Patty Duke Show. I had heard rumors throughout the years that a video release was being talked about. Years ago when they released Green Acres and Mr. Ed, I had heard that MGM was impressed by the sales and was prepping Patty Duke for some sort of release (either full season sets or best of).

But that iron cooled and it never happened. Some people point to the fact that studios are more reluctant to release black and white classic TV unless they are certified classics (like I Love Lucy or The Honeymooners) but whatever the reason, not much was ever heard about a release.

Until now, season one of The Patty Duke Show finds it's way to DVD from SHOUT!

It's a fantastic release with a couple caveats.

The transfers are variable in quality with some shows looking better and sharper than others. This is not a big problem as all of them are nice and watchable but they do reflect the fact that the transfers are not as up to date as the ones done for some old shows.

The sound on the shows can also be a bit wonky. Some episodes have distortion and level problems. It can be somewhat distracting and/or require you to increase the volume but it's not too much of a problem beyond that.

All the shows appear uncut with the possible exception of How To Be Popular. It runs about a minute shorter then the average of the rest of the episodes and appears to have an artificial fade out after Cathy sparks a family fight with her attempts at honesty. The 24 minute version from Nick At Nite cuts off even before that so we may never know if that is simply how the show was or if there was a small deletion for whatever reason.

Finally, it has to be explained that The Patty Duke Show had the sponsor tag announcements built into the opening credits and the final tag scene of the episode. At the end of the tag, the announcer would say ""The Patty Duke Show was brought to you by..."" and then they would run film of the sponsor.

Some people remember watching the show syndicated on local stations on a 16mm film chain and these sponsor tag announcements would be partially or entirely shown (shown without the sponsor, of course. The announcer would say ""brought to you by..."" and it would go to commercial or closing credits).

A Best of laser disc set came out a while ago that has 8 episodes intact with some commercials and all the sponsor tag material.

But on this DVD set, just as had been done with Nick At Nite the sponsor announcements were taken out and all the last scene tags have artificial fade outs before the announcer. This is why the music at the end of the tag sometimes seems to be cut short. There is no deletion of episode dialog, only the announcer that is on the end of the tag act.

I had hoped that these would be retained on DVD but it must be realized that the transfers were prepared by MGM originally for the syndication market and those are the ones that stand for DVD. Again, no big deal but I had held out a hope those moments would be kept for DVD.

As for the show itself, besides it's huge enjoyability it's also groundbreaking. Not only in having the youngest lead ever at the time in Patty Duke but also in the way the show was.

If you look at most family sitcoms of the time, Ozzie and Harriet, Father Knows Best or Donna Reed, the daughters were demure and entirely traditionally ladylike. Nothing wrong with that, to be sure, but a little variety might be in order.

Now, here comes The Patty Duke Show. Cathy Lane was more in line with Betty ""Princess"" Anderson and Mary Stone but she was a sidekick. The one out in front was Patty Lane, an impulsive, alternately brilliant, alternately scatterbrained, resourceful, hip minded, ambitious free spirit who tackles things at 100 miles an hour (with an occasionally fiery temper to punctuate her usual sweet perkiness).

Also contrary to the time, Patty was often shown to be somewhat sloppy, with her hair disheveled and dressed in untucked shirts and pants. Although most of the time, she was as put together as Cathy in the dress and hair sense, they allowed her a bit a sloppiness that was unusual for girl on a TV show.

Oftentimes, Patty would proceed like a teenage Lucy Ricardo, hatching schemes to get that dress that the parents won't pay for or getting a head of a studio to see her at the high school play. She would get an impulse and tackle it in a stream of consciousness fashion. That was new.

You wouldn't find Mary Stone plunging head first into turning a popular dress of her friend's into a business or pumping out a book that makes War and Peace look like a pamphlet when she learns about another teenage writer.

Cathy was a great counter balance for Patty and often had a few surprises of her own. Cathy is basically polite, level headed and well mannered and not as outgoing as Patty. They also allowed Cathy to be jealous sometimes and to outmaneuver Patty when she thought it was important.

Patty Duke plays both girls to a turn. It never seems that one character intrudes into the other. You soon forget that it's only one talented lady playing the two (even with the sometimes awkward efforts to hide the face of Patty's double in non split screen shots).

The writing for this show fulfilled the fun loving requirements for shows like this but also managed to work in a few bits of genuine emotional effectiveness here and there.

Bottom line, shows like Gidget, The Brady Bunch and even more recent ones like Hanna Montana owe a lot to The Patty Duke Show. From the overall dynamic to even some of the story lines. The more outgoing and take charge nature of Patty Lane was a clear departure of how teenage daughters were usually portrayed in TV land as was the general acknowledgment of youth pop culture and slang.

Season one of The Patty Duke Show has some of the best episodes of the series. Some of the best include (but are not limited to):

The French Teacher: Patty falls quick for a older substitute French teacher. When he gets wise to it, the teacher asks for help from Patty's dad to discourage her in an elegant and non hurtful fashion.

The President: Both Patty and Cathy get nominated for class President and it goes from friendly rivalry to a knock down drag out.

Double Date: Cathy accidentally gets Patty's flu shot and is confined to bed for Patty's party. In order to keep Cathy's date, Patty quick changes between Cathy and herself all throughout the party (much to Richard and Cathy's date's confusion). But what is she going to do when both Patty and Cathy get entered in the dance contest?

The Actress: Patty watches Cathy try out for the part of Cleopatra in the school play but ends up getting the part when the director wants her to read too. But when Patty's scheme to get a studio head to see her act in the play is successful, she psycho-semantically loses her voice.

The Princess Cathy: Patty loses what they both think is a foreign exchange student to Cathy. He actually is a prince and soon asks Cathy to marry him.

Author! Author!: Patty sets out to write the greatest book by a teenager ever.

The Perfect Teenager: When she fails a good teenager quiz in a magazine, Patty has a crisis of confidence and enrolls in modeling school.

Patty The Foster Mother: Patty becomes a foster mother to a Korean boy but accidentally ends up adopting him for real.

Today, most fans of the show and Patty Duke know of the problems Patty Duke had during the 60's due to her having an undiagnosed mental illness and from her being managed by a controlling and sometimes abusive couple. This probably led to her being dismissive of The Patty Duke Show initially, most notably in her first book. Can you blame her? She initially had no say about what the show would and would not be and one of the controlling mechanisms of her managers was to put down her acting work.

In recent years, Patty Duke has been able to actually see some of the shows (where she really didn't have the chance before) and has come to believe that she did some good work and that the show was worthy.

Also with the retrospective on the DVD set, you see that she was able to find solace in bonding with the cast members of the show as sort of a surrogate family (William Schallert, especially).

I am glad Patty Duke has found her way to embracing the series and to see it as a positive during her troubled time.",1255564800,8,9810,4.368681318681318
3883725,5,B002ACKBU0,"A lot of folks were concerned about the clarity that would be produced on this DVD set.  Nothing to fear; it is crystal clear.  After viewing the second disc (they were all out of the first with a long wait) from Netflix I am ordering the complete set from Amazon.  Hooray for ""Shout"" for doing a splendid job.  Am looking forward to the second season release.",1255478400,,360,4.409090909090909
3883726,5,B002ACKBU0,"I used to love watching The Patty Duke Show on ""Nick At Nite"" back in the day. That being said I was excited to learn that this series was being released on DVD. I was also excited to learn that it was being issued by Shout Factory, since they do a superior job re-issuing classic TV on DVD.  Shout Factory did a really good job with both the audio and video transfers. The black and white picture seems balanced and looks restored to eliminate any dirt or spots on the film. Though I cannot be 100% sure, all of the episodes appear to be uncut and open and close with the theme song. The ending always closes with the original United Artists Television vintage logo. Though I have not gotten to view it yet, the bonus features include ""All New Interviews With The Cast"" on disc 6 (I have only watched up until disc 2 so far).

The packaging is nice. the box shows Patty and Cathy against a green vintage patterned background. The one thing that irks me though is that on the front and back of the box it refers to the set as ""The Complete First Season"", while on the side of the box it says ""Season One"" as it does on all six discs, all three cases, and the enclosed booklet. I just think it should have been consistent as either ""Season One"" or ""The Complete First Season"".

The booklet is a nice addition too. These days you don't seem to get a booklet included anymore unless it is promoting other releases from the same company. The booklet provides a brief synopsis for each show, production number, airdates, guest stars (if any), starring, writing, music, producer and director credits as well as any trivia for that episode. There are also a bunch of pictures scattered throughout. Each slim case holds two discs in it and on the back show the episode title as well as the original airdate. The three cases are color coded as either purple, blue or pinkish, as are the discs that go in them. The front of each case has the exact same color picture of Patty Duke wearing a blue and green dress against a gold background. It's a good picture, but I wish they put a different picture on each case if for nothing more than variety. One thing that I was disappointed in was that Shout Factory did not include the original unaired pilot episode, which is mentioned in the booklet as trivia for the episode ""Cousins"" which used parts of it for flashback footage.

I hope Shout Factory continues to release all three seasons of The Patty Duke Show, but for now you get +/- 15 hours of enjoyable Patty Duke to make you lose your mind!",1254787200,7,2534,4.3965884861407245

Most of us know what the show was all about or we wouldn't have looked up this item in the first place. What we want to know is, how is this DVD presentation and is it worth purchasing? I have the DVD set in my possession right now, and there are 36 epsiodes in this complete first season set, not 26 (presumably just a typo on Amazon's part), but there is no pilot episode included as advertised. There are bits of the pilot interspersed in the last episode of the season as flashbacks, but that hardly counts. Great show, nice transfer, nice episode notes and (limited) trvia, interesting cast reminiscences. I'm glad to own it.",1254268800,14,710,4.511627906976744

But since the set DOES NOT include this episode ...Amazon should go through these older reviews written before the actual set was released and delete any mention of the Pilot being included.

3883731,5,B002ACKBU0,"I grew up watching this really cute series when it was in syndication as a teenager myself, and only wish today's teens had more programs of its quality and sense of genuine fun. ""The Patty Duke Show"" always reminded me of Disney's ""The Parent Trap,"" which starred another favorite Haley Mills.

The series portrays the story of two identical cousins, Patty and Cathy Lane. Cathy, the daughter of a globe trotting journalist, comes to live with her aunt & uncle, Martin & Natalie Lane. They have a daughter, Patty, who's the same age as Cathy and her absolute spitting image. However, aside from looks, these two teenage girls are completely opposite in personality, taste, and life experiences.

Patty Duke charmingly captures the dual roles of the cousins and manages to make the viewer think that there are actually two different teenagers here. There are some great special effects for that era when the 'two of a kind' cousins appear together on screen. Whether realistic or not, the show had a great story idea with a variation on the identical twins with contrasting personalities theme. Making them cousins with totally different childhood experiences, the screenwriters could make this pair of look-a-likes seem really diverse.

In fact, their ""personality"" and ""culture clash"" forms the basis of the series. Since Patty and Cathy are such opposites, they have trouble understanding each other. The urbane, sophisticated Cathy is a quiet and serious young lady, who has been living in Scotland with her father and has traveled abroad in Europe. Patty is a typical peppy, outgoing, and very social American teenager living in Brooklyn Heights. Cathy is studious and scholastically excellent, while Patty receives average grades and is more concerned with fashions, fads, friends, fun, and slumber parties than with schoolwork. Cathy's taste in music runs to classical, while Patty likes to bop around to the rock & roll music of that era. Even their taste in food...well, Cathy prefers gourmet cuisine, while Patty chooses hot dogs, ice cream, and junk food.

Although jealousy and conflict arise (always humorously conveyed of course), it's much like a sibling relationship. Underneath it all, the cousins really do care about one another and sometimes even conspire together to pull off pranks or get themselves out of scrapes. (Typically Patty gets into the scrape and Cathy must help her out of it!) Also, the cousins are not actually that different in some important ways. Patty desires popularity and Cathy at least some sense of acceptance. And of course both young ladies are interested in BOYS. Patty would accurately be described as boy crazy, and kept a steady relationship with one boy in particular, Richard Harrison (Eddie Applegate), while Cathy conveys her interest a bit more subtly. The girls don't always go for the same type, but in one episode, I recall the pair are actually rivals for the attentions of the new boy next door.

Patty's father, Martin Lane, is managing editor of a fictitious New York newspaper, the New York Chronicle, for which Cathy's father (Martin's brother) works as a foreign correspondent. The two brothers are identical twins, presumably explaining their daughters' close physical resemblance. Cathy's father wants her to complete high school in the States before returning to Scotland.

The father in this series really stands out in my mind these many years later. William Shallert is absolutely wonderful in the role of Patty's father, Martin Lane, the classic kind & caring American dad who's often at his wit's end over his teenage daughter's antics. This actor also plays Cathy's father in a few of the episodes.  Natalie Lane, as Patty's mother is also perfectly cast and manages her scenes beautifully.

""The Patty Duke Show"" was always entertaining and I always enjoyed seeing what kind of ""caper"" Patty would get into and then watch as Cathy would figure a way out of it.  There are many classic teen ""story lines"" featured, including parties, dating, school football stars, teachers, baby sitting, kid brothers, and peer rivalry. Patty spars with her own younger brother, Ross, (Paul O'Keffe) and must also cope with an annoying school rival, Sue Ellen (Kitty Sullivan). I'm very excited to see Season 1 of ""The Patty Duke Show"" finally making it to DVD and hope the following Season 2 and 3 won't be too far behind! Here are the Episodes featured in Season 1:
