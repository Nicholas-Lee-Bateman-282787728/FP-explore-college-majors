Although I am happy finally to have these games at all on DVD, they are not as well done as they
could have been.  In particular, they are not complete, as they are missing entirely the between-
period commentaries, e.g., between Ron MacLean and Don Cherry, as well as the after-game
festivities, e.g., the telephone call between executive director Wayne Gretzky and Canadian prime
minister Jean Chretien.  Surely these moments are as important parts of Canadians' memories of
the event as the game itself.
There is also the matter of the packaging: whereas the 4-disc ""Canada's Team of the Century""
Canada vs. USSR 1972 series has a simple but handy list of goals and penalties (and times) for
each of the 8 games, there is absolutely no such supplemental info on these 2 discs.  The makers
of this DVD would have done well to follow the model of the 1972 set in this regard; the current offering is a bare bones affair, with no bonus footage or on-screen menus of statistics, for example.
While being happy to have this DVD (it's inexpensive and better than nothing), here is what I
would ultimately like to see on a DVD set: all six of the Canadian men's 2002 Olympic games with
a printed (or on-screen) list of player stats, and list of goals and penalties in each game.  It sounds
simple enough, but will we ever have it?  I hope so.  Ditto for the women's games.",1048896000,,1460,4.5534351145038165
8049061,1,B00008NUUU,"You would think that CBC Sports might have put some effort into this product, as it is ostensibly the permanent record of our greatest modern-day hockey victory.  But.....for whatever reason....they appear NOT to have used the master game tapes for these DVDs, and the picture quality is ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE.  The players are mere blurs every time the camera moves, which is essentially all the time.  It's almost unwatchable.  I'm absolutely disgusted that our national broadcaster would release such a poor recording of such important games.  Shame on you, CBC!!  Shame!!",1048636800,,573,5.311111111111111
