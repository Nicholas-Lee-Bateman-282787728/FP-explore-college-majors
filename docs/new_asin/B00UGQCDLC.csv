8706368,4,B00UGQCDLC,"So Marvel does A DC-esque Film for once and its Captain America:The Winter Solider. The film Features Chris Evans(Sunshine) as Captain America, Scarlett Johansson(Her) as Black Widow, Anthony Mackie(The Hurt Locker) as The Falcon, Emily VanCamp(Revenge) as Agent 13 ,Samuel L. Jackson(Django Unchained) as Nick Fury, Cobie Smulders(Delivery Man) as Agent Hill , Sebastian Stan(Black Swan) as The Winter Soldier and Robert Redford(Jeremiah Johnson) as Alexander Pierce. This was awesome from the Captain America Theme to The Ends Twist and turns also Evans delivers as The First Avenger and he acted his best than his previous two films also Sam Wilson/The Falcon was awesome he was much funnier than Rhodey also he had amazing chemistry as the films progresses also it was interesting to see a Black & White Moral Code Cap in a very Grey world ala Superman in Man Of Steel also it was awesome to see him to keep to his code in spite of all lies and secrets. The film was great the only thing i didn't like is they cut Agent 13's screen time she was great character and wasn't useless like Darcy & Maya Hansen I wish she had more screen time in the final act other than Great Direction from Anthony & Joe Russo(Community) and Costume design from Judianna Makovsky(The Hunger Games) Definitely worth buying on DVD & BluRay and One of My All time favorite Superhero films and definitely better than X-Men DOFP & Guardians 9/10",1471996800,,1423,4.836065573770492
