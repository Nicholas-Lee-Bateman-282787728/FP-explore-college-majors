They follow the eminent scientist and her daughter (Bennett) from Paris to the front lines, where Curie hopes her portable radon-emitting machine (here, erroneously identified as an X-rayer) can be used to save the lives of wounded soldiers.

7914011,2,B00000K0B5,"The film has a good intention in its conception BUT, the story is not true. This film presents a not real Mme. Curie as she was in her time.

Her main field of study was radioactivity not X-rays.

This is a partial and erroneous biography. There are other films more realistics, even as a cartoons, about Mme. Curie's life and about her great contribution to science.",1179619200,6,367,4.545454545454546
