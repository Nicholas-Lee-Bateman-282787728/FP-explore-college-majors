I not only bought the movie ta watch with my niece, but I bought another cause one of my coworkers enjoyed watvhing it, too. Tami Erin (dare ta say) did a just as much, if not, a more awesome job than Shirley Temple did! An that covers alot of ground. Too bad there wasn't a ""Pippi Longstocking 2"".

If you like the dream, the fantasy of being a super cool kid then buy it. I love Pippi, to me she is like the female kid version of Popeye. Not perfect, but not a bad person. Easy going, gentle with her enormous strength, playful, and gotta love the monkey. The mother next door is sweet, like all mothers should be, trusting loving and gentle.

463944,4,6302447712,"The New Adventures of Pippi Longstocking is the ideal family movie; it features Tami Erin as the nonchalant, spunky redheaded girl who can touch a nerve or two with those she meets. This movie is a sometimes forgotten gem, because this film franchise has actually done better overseas in terms of box office gross, but still resonates in the U.S. This is the prototypical G-rated movie, in that it can appeal to a wide audience. I remember my first ever movie attended at the theater was a Pippi Longstocking movie (in the mid-seventies), and enjoyed it. Years later, it's nice to see a mild resurgence of this neat little character. I recommend this as a good family movie.",1439164800,,674,4.720338983050848

While they enjoyed the movie somewhat, my son couldn't get past the ""magical"" sound that played whenever Pippi did something that people don't normally do,such as soaring through the air.

I'm old enough to have forgotten the details of the story, save for rule-breaking-rebelious-yet-charming-girl-with-stick-out-red-braids bit, but even so I could tell this ""new"" version was a wack-o spin on the original. My son said it wasn't like the book. For full disclaimer and fair review standards, he sort of liked it, though he is an all around good sport and just likes any screen time he can get. The recurring ""song"" PiiiippppPI LONGSTOCKING is COOOMMMING INTO YOUR TOWN....will grind on your last nerve and haunt your for the rest of your days. On the plus side it has become a standing family joke to belt it out and watch everyone else cover his/her ears and cringe.

The one no one can keep down, no no no no
The one who's fun to be around, woaaahhh woah.

Pippi Longstocking is coming into your world

She had daddy make her very own scrubbing day shoes, so win win over here! LOL. She loves all the songs too.

The shipping was ensainly fast and as far as the comments and reviews on the movie being terribly put together,  voice dubbing or voice over being horrible, should consider the fact it is just an old  movie put together in the best form possible and more than likely very low budget. Any way I love the movie and it's everything in the description of above. So great to sit and watch it with my  children, seeing them laugh aND smile remembering the times I'd watched it at their age and how much I loved it then and still do today.

I am a retired teacher and showed this  movie at the end of the year to my kindergarten classes from 1995 thru 2000 - many years ago.  They always loved it and so did I !  Unfortunately I must have given it away sometime after the year 2000 when I retired.  My granddaughter finished kindergarten this year and I really wanted her to get to see it !  Since then, I found out from a friend who vacationed at Amelia Island and on Fernandina Beach in Florida that the movie was filmed there.  She borrowed this movie and was thrilled to see scenes filmed at places she saw on vacation. Now I have two
more adults waiting to see this movie.  I would highly recommend it to both kids and grownup - Once you watch Pippi and her fun adventures you'll  never forget her!",1405641600,2,877,4.160714285714286

465689,1,6302447712,"When I was younger Pippi Longstocking was my hero, still is in some form, that said I rented and eventually was given the Pippi Longstocking Movies as a present. My first exposure to her were the Swedish films, there was just something special about that show and something wonderful about Inger Nilsson acting the part, and then I got this one, The New Adventures of Pippi Longstocking. As a kid I loved it.

Then I got older and eventually found this on DVD and excitedly bought it feuled by nostalgia. I got home and popped it in...the first song made me pause it as I cringed in horror. My goodness it was terrible, people were horribly miscast, no one reacted as sensible people would to this young woman's antics (she looked too old to be called a little girl). Spoiler: she basically kidnaps her friends, nearly gets them killed and she doesn't really get reprimanded for it.

The slapstick comedy was misused and felt pointless with useless bumbling around by the movie's criminal antagonist who really served no point as the big bad seem to be the teacher from the Children's Home. I won't go into how stereotypically bad they made that place to be but it's not the simple bad because it's in poor condition but rather bad because it's abusive and restrictive there.

It was so bad that after forcing myself to get through half of it I called my mother to apologize for making her watch that over and over again when I was younger. In fact I let a friend borrow it years ago and still haven't gotten it back and I'm not the least bit upset about this.

Some people may love it, we all have different tastes, but this...if you have no knowledge of the books or the old Swedish films you may be okay with this, but give the others a try.",1398643200,,1744,4.4576802507836994

465694,5,6302447712,"I grew up watching Pippi and wanted to introduce her to my kids. What is better place to start then
reading reviews of all the available versions of the DVDs
My original instinct was to go with what I used to watch as  a kid. I almost bought the old original version
but then I decided to see the youtube trailers of old original movies and new adventures movie.
I was shocked to find out that I completely outgrew the slow pace and frankly rather boaring
and hardly keeping me from yawning old version and when I clicked the new adventures trailer
that felt more like home.

It is possible that throught the year something happened.. either my attention span changed
or maybe the movies in the old days were just so slow paced that it did not bothered me
but today I think that it is really hard to watch old versions.

The voice over did not bothered me at all as I am sued to watching foreign movies
but the whole slooooooow action is really hard to watch.

I would say that for an older viewer who just want to see original that might be an option
but if you have new generation younger kid who is used to modern movies it might
blow the whole effect and instead of having your kid interested you can get a kid
disinterested completely.

I am glad I watched the trailers and compared and made decision based on
my family preferences and my own and my kids abilities to watch certain type
of cinematography.

I am not saying this movie is for everyone as I red some complaining on modern
disney'esk flavor of it, I like it and it is well made and of course you can't have both.
you either have this one or the other.. unless you can have both?
My recommendation though is if you get old and this versions -
do watch the old first as afer watching new adventures it is really pain to
slow down with perception to watch the old version.",1396915200,,1837,4.279538904899136

I honestly don't remember too much about the book when I read it as a child (I remember liking the book), so I don't know how true the movie is to the book.  As an adult, I thought it was dull.  It's certainly a ""teaching moment"" type of movie if you want to watch it with younger children...

Campy as 80's kids movies are, but a refreshing break from disrespectful and mean and overly sexed CGI characters in today's movies.",1368662400,,425,4.461538461538462

466396,1,6302447712,"This film is one of those rare ""extreme"" triple-threats:  extreme bad acting; extreme bad script; extreme bad directing/editing!  All of these combined to make for a dual rating from myself:  1 star for being one of the worst movies ever made, and yet 5 stars for being one of the worst movies ever made, but SO much fun to watch and make fun of.  Not being familiar with the original story or the characters involved, I come from just a film buff stand point and I have to say that this ranks #2 on my list of all time favorite worst movies. The lead actress in the role of Pippi comes off as a mental patient in a red wig set loose upon an unsuspecting town.  Her ""medicated"" style of acting is humorously manic in a cold-reading sort of way. Out of 8,000 hopefuls who auditioned for this role, this was the best they found? Yikes!

Within 1 minute of the movie starting they were both in to it.  They were especially interested in all the animals in the movie.  Pippi has a pet monkey and a horse that rides on a raft with her.  I can't say that I watched the movie but I was in and out of the room and they were completely entertained and there was lots of laughing.  My daughter did come to me at the end and reported she was sad because Pippi's father left her again.  I explained that he would return again and she moved on.",1367452800,,788,4.1381578947368425

466467,4,6302447712,Pippi is a wonderful movie filled with friendship and love and good deeds.  A bit of fantasy but not too much.  A dream for any child to live the life of Pippi. It talks about responsibility and the power to change and grow.  My children and grandchildren know all the songs and love singing them all over our house.,1365033600,,316,4.322033898305085
466468,5,6302447712,"This is not a review of the film itself - you're reading this, so presumably you already like it! It is, rather, an attempt to guide you towards choosing the best DVD issue for you.

Firstly, as far as I am aware, at the time of writing, Pippi 1988 has been issued on DVD in just four countries: the US, Holland, Germany and Italy.

From an English speaker's point of view, you can't go wrong, as all of them feature the original English 2.0 Dolby Surround soundtrack and English subtitles.

The main difference between them is that the US region 1 DVD has a 1.33:1 (fullscreen) aspect ratio, open matte image, in the NTSC format, whilst all of the European region 2 DVDs have a 1.85:1 (widescreen) aspect ratio image, in the PAL format.

In a nutshell, the European editions are best, especially if you have a widescreen television, as they're in the original theatrical aspect ratio. They won't, however, play on most US televisions.

The US DVD is ok, if you must have it; it will also play fine on any region free European equipment.

For a more detailed breakdown of the other various different dub and subtitle options, look up Pippi's comparison page on DVDCompare.net.

I hope all this helps!",1364256000,2,1200,4.632075471698113
466469,2,6302447712,"... so I expect bad acting, a ridiculous plot, etc. I'm really not a fan of how the outrageous antics of Pippi are portrayed to be superior to the society of the town she lives in. You could say that there's a moral delivered near the end of the movie, but I think it's too little, too late. I won't be showing this to my children.

The picture is about as good as can be expected when considering when it was made. The sound is good and even all throughout the movie. I really dislike it movies that have uneven volume changes.

466683,2,6302447712,"I have to admit, this movie is creative with its portrayal of the characters. However, I get the feeling that the film is painfully low-budget. While the main trio of kids capture their characters, the writing makes them very bland, uninteresting characters. Pippi still has the carefree attitude and friendliness that Lindgren's writing conveyed, but Tommy and Annika both seem to have lost any personality they had originally, and they originally only really existed to be shown as ordinary middle-class children. The storyline is very good, and the movie is appealing to younger viewers. However, the sub-plot of the men hoping to tear down Villa Villikulla feels like they're trying to pad the film out, and it would have been better to leave that out.
Overall, the movie is worth a watch once, but you'd be better off reading the books about Pippi.",1324339200,,853,4.972027972027972

Pippi is allowed to do all the things that kids would love to be able to do -- make a big mess, flip pancakes up in the air and not worry where they land, scoff authority, etc.  However in watching it again I also realized that my kids are too young for this.  There are no consequences for Miss Longstocking, so though the kids liked watching it, it's not really appropriate for young children that think of all older kids as role models.",1321228800,,516,4.244897959183674

A half grown woman like this would also know better than to behave the way that Pippi Longstocking does is another good point.

  Since this film came out; Astrid Lindgren; Pippi's creator, made a set of rules as to how Pippi and the rest of her characters are to be handled.
If anyone plans to break those rules; they're not allowed permission to use the characters. Astrid Lindgren's family upholds these rules to this day. Those rules are a result of this terrible adaptation of Pippi with a storyline that was entirely changed; and, for the worst I might add.
The horse talks, Pippi, Tommy, and Annika are all three over grown yuppie kids who act sickeningly sweet, there is terrible/tacky broadway styled music throughout the picture,the writing on the film is terrible, the film lacks verisimilitude(no realistic acting), and isn't even set in the part of the World it should be set in.  Pippi Longstocking lives in a little village in Sweden.

By the way; Villa Villakula is supposed to be a yellow/sloppy looking cottage with a picket fence.  In this film; it is a white/ foreboding southern mansion that has a striking resemblence to the Disneyland Haunted Mansion facade.

Back in the late 60's and early 70's; 9-year-old Swedish Actress; Inger Nilsson nwas absolutely flawless in the role of Pippi Langstrump (Pippi Longstocking) From the sloppy mop of red hair with the pig tails sticking strait out, to the sloppy/ patched up dresses made from  a mixture of several materials that hung rather loose in places, to the enormouse shoes, and who could forget that wonderful buck toothed grin with the freckles and the big/ striking blue eyes.

466895,3,6302447712,"For children who grew up in the 1980s, THE NEW ADVENTURES OF PIPPI LONGSTOCKING has always been a cherished title.  Based on the series of books by Astrid Lindgren, it features a vivacious Tami Erin as the title character and a well-cast ensemble.

Pippilotta Delicatessa Windowshade Longstocking--Pippi for short--lives with her sea-captain father and enjoys a colourful life, until an horrific storm separates the pair.  Pippi makes her way ashore and sets up housekeeping in a rambling old house called Villa Villekula; and later makes two new friends, Tommy and Annika Settigren (David Seaman and Cory Crow).  But Pippi also faces a tough enemy in the stern orphanage owner Miss Bannister (Eileen Brennan), and the rest of the town authorities.

THE NEW ADVENTURES OF PIPPI LONGSTOCKING was the long-awaited followup to the fondly remembered 1969-1970 Swedish film franchise (starring Inger Nilsson in the title role).  Fans of the original movies have always treated it with contempt, and while it does create some slight liberties with the original material, it does stay true to the whimsical and carefree themes which were hallmarks of the books.

Tami Erin, if slightly too old for the role, gives a solid and heartfelt performance as Pippi.  David Seaman and Cory Crow are a bit too goody-goody, but that contrasts perfectly with Pippi's irreverent nature.  The always amazing Eileen Brennan steals many a scene with her hilarious role of the mean orphanage mistress.  Dennis Dugan and Dianne Hull play the Settigren parents, with Conrad John Schuck as Pippi's father.

The theme song is very catchy.  You'll find yourself humming it for weeks--though I'm not sure whether that's a good or bad thing!  I remember growing up with this movie, and it has been really fun to see it again on DVD.",1191715200,2,1801,5.064406779661017

466953,4,6302447712,"Pippi is a magical girl that seems simultaneously wise and nave.  When you begin to watch this film you wonder whether Pippi makes up all the things she talks about, or whether she can actually do them.  When Pippi flies, you know there is something about her that is magical.

Pippi is an outcast because she behaves strangely, and yet everyone quickly accepts her because she is so self-assured and has wonderful faith.  Pippi is simply unafraid to try.  While some of the things she does are socially bizarre, she also makes a role model for young girls and boys.  How often do we tell our children that they should not be afraid to try something new?  Pippi's life is has one constant, and that is always trying something new.

Besides being willing to try something new, Pippi revels in being a child.  She enjoys food fights and walking up and down walls.  Her tales of pirates and cannibals lend a tinge of Peter Pan to the proceedings.  Eventually you want to believe everything she says is real and has happened to her.  It is impossible to prove they have not happened to her.

My children loved this movie, and watched it several times.  I suspect that Pippi was able to break rules that my children could not, and Pippi's unwillingness to accept convention fascinated them.  Whatever the reason children love this movie, it is good harmless fun.

Oh, yeah.  And she's probably older and smarter than she pretends to be, and she's definitely MUCH wiser.
All these things have made her one of my favorite fictional characters ever.
So why is it that in this movie, she is none of those amazing things?
As a child, I was a fairly poor individual, not at all like Pippi, but I did have a library card, and so I spent much time reading.  Naturally, when this movie came out, I couldn't go to see it, however, I did read the book, and I was immediately swept up into a childhood crush on its main character that lasted for years and years.
At the age of 18 or so, I finally got the chance to see this movie, and I was apalled!  This film makes a mockery of everything Pippi is.
For about 70% of the film, Pippi behaves completely out-of-character, and much of the rest of it is consumed by lousy characters who have no substance.  Pippi does get to rough up a few people, but unlike in the books, she only does it to three bad guys that act like the Curly, Larry and Moe.
Additionally, this movie is plagued by the curse of having way too many unnecesary songs.  It could have been so much better.
If you want to speak kindly of this movie, however, you won't be entirely without ammunition.  It does contain a few scenes of pleasing metahuman powers, and several of Pippi being a brat which ALMOST threaten to drag the movie out of the gutter it made for itself.
If you still don't understand what I'm griping about, read all three Pippi books, then carefully review the scenes in the children's home.  You should be able to tell quite easily that none of them should have happened, especially the one where Pippi flinches at the striking of a ruler, as opposed to her book incarnation, whose skin was about the consistency of a brick wall.
Long and short, as a movie, it's only marginally bad, but you definitely don't want to watch it because frankly, you're better off reading the books by about a billion times.",1080604800,22,2232,4.43520782396088

467054,5,6302447712,"I'll address the one person (I'm sure that'll change) that gave this movie one star. Yes, it is true that this movie does not follow the books. In fact, they're taking artistic license all over the place, but that doesn't detract from the experience. The reason I read the books in the first place was because of this movie. Anyway, on to the real review. It's very light fare. A children's film. I have memories of watching it when I was younger and I enjoyed it. I still do. So, if you're looking for something you can watch with the kids, of if you're a big kid (like me), get this film. And unlike most ""kids"" movies you see today there is no bathroom humor. Highly recommended.",996105600,24,682,4.377952755905512
467055,5,6302447712,"This is a really fun, if simple, movie. I've never seen any of the original Swedish-made Pippis or cartoons, so I can't say how faithful this movie was (I hear it's not) but every child I know that has seen it has enjoyed the music and characters. I also heard a rumor that the star, Tami Erin, went to my high school (Ocean Township HS in NJ) that's why I first saw it, but I've never been able to confirm that. She was excellent in it, betraying a cute juxtaposition of affability and brashness. There's even a cameo from Dick VanPatten. Overall, a very cute and enjoyable flick.",995846400,2,581,4.388888888888889
467076,5,6302447712,"I first watched this video when I was six or seven and it instantly became my favourite. My family soon became sick of it as I got it out from the video shop every couple of weeks. The weeks I didn't have it out, my best friend would so I was always watching it! We used to make believe we were Pippi and would dance around the school singing 'Pippi Longstockings coming into your world...' Last year I was reunited with this best friend and when we saw each other the first thing we did was start singing that song! I'm now fifteen and last week when I was at the video shop I came across it again and decided to get it out. My family of course complained, but I've fallen in love with it once again! It's a magical story about believing you can do anything. And it's a video I'll love forever.",987033600,2,795,4.135483870967742
467077,5,6302447712,"Ok, I am 20 years old an I love this movie to this day.  Me and brother, who is 17, have watched this movie tons of times throughout the years.  Yeah we saw it back when it originally came out, but to watch it now is just simply a treat.  I would classify it as a hilarious comedy now.  Young kids will love it for what it is and people my age will get a good laugh and relish on our youth.  The songs are classic, Pippi is classic, and the movie in general is classic.  Simply put, it's classic!  Buy it, rent it, do whatever you must to watch this movie, because what is it kids?  That's right, it is classic.",982800000,12,611,3.9508196721311477
467078,3,6302447712,"The setting of Pippi Longstocking's home is supposed to be Sweden, in this movie it's relocated to America. That was perhaps unfaithful to the books- but this version of Pippi manages to be sweet and endearing in spite of this.
I've read a lot of negative reviews of this movie- I'm not exactly sure how many people don't like this movie, but I happen to think it sweet and charming for people of all ages.
The performances by the actors in this manage to recreate magic in a different setting. Tami Erin gives a positively charming performance as a little girl- she manages to give Pippi the trademark innocence, oddness, and yet she manages to give Pippi a sort of beginning of wisdom as well. Tami conveys the hurt and pain as Pippi is aquainted with the realities of kids who are unloved, her friend Annika's father's dislike of her, and the gradual evaporation of the magic of her childhood. She manages to make Pippi human and accesible while still making her an enduring, endearing figure. Some people refer to her as ''spoiled brat'', but I think her reaction toward these adults was more her shock that her cheer could not please them. The adventures between her and Tommy and Annika were sweetly shown, and it can end in Pippi's understanding of what she's done.
I have seen the other versions of Pippi and Inger Neillson portrays Pippi as a strange, detached, though not charmless character- but she is in no way human or accessible.
The songs are cute too- they manage to show Pippi's enduring innocence, and her good-hearted spirit.
I would recommend this movie to people of all ages ready to see a new version of the sweet, charming Pippi- Tami Erin was a charming young actress, I don't know why she didn't persue acting after this.",976752000,41,1747,4.656957928802589
467079,4,6302447712,"Most Pippi diehards, critics and most of the general public did not accept this film generally, but I have adored Pippi Longstocking for many years and I would like to say it was a good effort. This is the first (and maybe) last American adaptation of the red-headed girl. And like most movies based on books, it ain't going to be perfect or accurate. First and foremost, Pippi is supposed to be 9. Tami Erin (Who has seemed to fall off the face of this planet after this), was around her teen years when this was filmed. With that age barrier, she still does duplicate that trademark Pippi cheerfulness.
Another lasting memory of this film is the incredibly CHEESY songs! They make most Disney songs sound platable. If any one who grew up with this film, I bet you recall the title song (""Pippi Longstocking is coming into your town...""). One tidbit about that that it's sung by an Austrailan childrens chorus. So, it's good to watch once in awhile, not like every day or something.",975715200,2,983,4.590909090909091

The upsetting thing is that I could never  buy it because it wasn't in the shops.  If there is anyone that has a  version of the video that would work on a British video player then please  email me.  I recommend this to anyone with young kids.  Pippi Longstocking  is so cool and she's better than all these modern kid's characters like the  Teletubbies.  The theme tune to this film is great too!  Ooh please someone  out there sell me a British version of the video!  I could go on and on  about her but I've already been sad enough so just buy it!,956448000,2,727,4.014084507042254
