8611508,5,B00F1FVKFI,"Excellent transfer of this 1976 'Police Story' type TV Movie. A veritable who's who of familiar faces and a terrific dramatic turn by the talented Stella Stevens. Claude Akins is terrific as always. Solid performances from Robert Vaughn, Alan Fudge and Bruce Boxleitner. Not much screen time for Tisha Sterling.  Steve (here Stephen) Franken has one scene with Stella. and Bruce Glover has little to do. Recommended.",1520985600,,416,5.208955223880597
8611509,4,B00F1FVKFI,"Very risque TV content for the 1970's. Stella Stevens plays a detective investigating the murder of a crippled woman. Seems that the victim was sleeping around-- making for several suspects including a black guy, a bisexual man and a married cop. Robert Vaughn playing a gay man and a very young Bruce Boxleitner as a bisexual hustler is quite something for it's day. The performances are all good and the storyline is typical 70's mystery/police drama (except for the gay content). Interesting mainly because the film depicts the time period with all the various prejudices and stereotypes. Stella Stevens once again proves that she can take on serious drama as well as light comedy. Love those 70's TV movies of the week!",1390262400,5,723,4.934426229508197
