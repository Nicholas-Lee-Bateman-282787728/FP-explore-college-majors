2230771,3,B0007PP4KE,"Stories from passengers and drivers of the Kansas City, MO bus system.
Some are real people, some are actors -- it's not hard to distinguish between them.
As a former long-time rider of the Atlanta public transit system, I have a lot of interesting
stories I could tell about my experiences riding the buses in that city. I thought perhaps
Das Bus might serve up some interesing dish as well, but alas...
I didn't find many of the stories very interesting, and frankly a couple of the actors purporting
to be bus passengers could use a little drama school coaching.
My main reason for purchasing this dvd was the fact James Ellroy was in it. But Ellroy fans be
advised: he has about five minutes screen time in the whole movie. The rapper that shares co-billing
with Ellroy also has about the same amount of time - which might or might not be a disappointment to
you.
I've never been to Kansas City though, and this movie did serve as an almost interesting tour of parts of
that city from a bus rider's perspective.
Urban transit is a mystery to most Americans. If you've never ridden a city bus, go ahead and get on
Das Bus (why it's ""Das"" bus is never explained.) You might enjoy the experience. Otherwise, forgiddaboudit.",1258156800,,1224,4.568181818181818
2230772,4,B0007PP4KE,"Das Bus is much more than a film about buses and those whose lives are shaped by Das Bus.  This is also a story about a city whose center was hollowed out during ""white flight"" and now has only a tenuous connection through Das Bus to the city's miles of sprawl. As a native of KC, who lived there the first 40 years of my life, I see this flm as a poignant portrayal of my home town.",1111622400,3,383,3.91025641025641
2230773,5,B0007PP4KE,"A typical Ben Meade film, Das Bus will make you laugh and think at the same time.  The film has a hardball political message wrapped in a fluffy coating of lighthearted fun.  You will be laughing and clapping and singing along when Ben blindsides you with the reality of what has been lost in this city (or any city, for that matter!)due to ineffectual leaders and inept planning.  The lump in your throat and the ache in your heart makes you wonder what just happened.  You've just been run over by DAS BUS!",1111449600,2,508,4.43010752688172

I do have two 65 bugs, a 68 bug and a 2001 bug and hopefully later this week a 73 squareback. I will get another bus but I refuse to pay the stupid prices that are being asked these days so I will keep waiting and searching till the right one comes along. I loved the film and I think that it portrays what is sadly lacking from a vast majority of folks who own vdubs today; a bonding and love of your dub. It really is a way of life and a slowing down and looking and enjoying and appreciating LIFE. We are so busy living we forget we are alive. Its sad really. Everyone thinks that it is normal to buy into things that are designed to fail and be replaced with more expensive things in 5 or 7 years. Gotta keep the hamsters on the wheels turning the gears of capitalism. Today I picked up 4 vw motors and a transaxle from a guy on craigslist who was going to scrap them for a total of $175. They need rebuilding of course but they are complete. I can rebuild one a weekend in my garage and I am far from being a top mechanic.

2230853,4,B0007PP4KE,"Ironically this is one of TWO documentary films about Volkswagen collectors being released this month.  You can find my review of ""Circle the Wagen"" here on Amazon but, basically, it follows two guys who buy a used VW wagen and drive it for 1400 miles back home. I do recommend it.

This documentary (made in 2012) concerns the  history of the vehicle and introduces a few collectors (primaryily a singer/songwriter who has been living in his for the last five years).

The director uses vintage film to go back to 1947 when the ""Bus"" was designed - and interviews the son of the original designer).  He also interviews the author of the book ""From  Hitler to Hippies"" - a Master's thesis done at UT Austin in 2004. The book tells the story of how VW started under Hitler and the wagen became associated with the Hippie movement in the late 1960s.

There is clever use of vintage TV commercials and clips from movies that featured the Wagen such as ""Easy Rider"".  There's even a section of the documentary that shows ""Volkwagen buses on fire""!

The 66-minute film did drag a bit in a few places for me (it seemed longer than 66 minutes) but I never ownws a VW. For VW owners and collectors, it may even seem too short!

Unlike the ""Circle The Wagen"" DVD, this one has no bonus features, not even a ""trailer"".

NO, you don't need to have owned a VW - or even ridden in one - to enjoy this film. Think of it as a fun automotive history lesson.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

2230854,4,B0007PP4KE,"What an original idea of Ben Meade, Kansas City-based filmmaker.  Start riding the city bus with a camera and get to know the riders & drivers, then create a documentary of it.  Include a nostalgia tribute to bus and mass transit of old times.  To some extent, a plug for public transportation and a look at how a large city like KC had good useful public transportation when it was not considered only for poor people like the attitudes of today.  Few professional actors included.  Includes a full rap-video performance of KC local TECH-9ne (sp?), who plays a driver.

All along the way, meet interesting and zany REAL city characters.  The bus riders and drivers tell stories and some get hilariously re-enacted.  The scene of hippie bus driver ""Wild Bill"" Day (an actual KCMO bus driver) faking being blind when getting on the bus to drive is a scream.  Some of the other re-enacted stories flow like a reality show but much of the movie is based on actual reality.

I think Ben Meade has done a great job of bringing a micro-world of everyday Americans who just happen to ride the bus into an entertaining funny documentary.

A great use of the KC-based (at that time) Iris DeMent song ""Our Town"" is included, but I won't spoil it for you.

Recommended to anyone from Kansas City, independent film buffs, bus drivers and riders, public transportation advocates, and mass transit nostalgia buffs.

Just so you know, bus driver ""Wild Bill"" (my neighbor) has retired but is still ""at large"" around mid-town Kansas City.",1299196800,,1521,4.737642585551331
