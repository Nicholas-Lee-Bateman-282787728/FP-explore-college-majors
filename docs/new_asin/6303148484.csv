7839363,5,6303148484,"Charles Shultz characterized Charlie Brown as being stuck in 3rd grade.  No wonder I have always loved these Peanuts cartoons, as I was 8 years old & in 3rd grade when ""A Charlie Brown Christmas"" first came out.  These two shows both came out when I was in high school.  But I remember how, even as teenagers, my classmates & I still watched them.  If we referred to someone as Joe Cool, no other explanation was needed.  And Vince Guarldi still provided the background music.  In the post-Woodstock/pre-disco era of arena rock, the serious musicians amongst us listened to & played jazz; thanks in large part to Peanuts.",1374883200,,621,4.703703703703703
7839364,5,6303148484,"You can't go wrong with this one- 2 classic Charlie Brown specials!
In ""You're Not Elected, Charlie Brown"", Linus runs for Student Government and makes promises galore just like a true politician!  It all  seems as if Linus has the election in the bag until he pulls a plug for the  Great Pumpkin!  ""AUGH!""  Joe Cool makes his TV debut here!
In  ""It Was a Short Summer, Charlie Brown"", we join the Peanuts gang  at Summer Camp.  Charlie Brown was looking forward to playing baseball,  Schroeder was looking forward to practicing his piano, and Linus just  wanted to read comics and watch TV.  But no, Lucy signs the whole gang up  for summer camp.  It doesn't help the boys' cabin that the girls can beat  them at every game under the sun!  Can the Masked Marvel save the  day?
NOTE: This is one of the last Charlie Brown specials with Peter  Robbins (the original Charlie Brown) supplying the blockhead's voice.",962150400,17,912,4.6
