4691711,2,B005GM38NI,As I watched this movie although I didn't care for the main character and what he was doing I felt compelled to keep watching.  I thought the acting was well done and the story was interesting and I was anxious to see how it would end.  I will not give any spoilers but I think the director must have run out of money or something and had been reading too many Stephen King novels and thought - wow I should end this movie like most of his books and just stop where I am right now.  I was ready to give these movie at least 4 stars but with the ending - it really made me angry.  I watched this with a group of friends and all of them agreed with me.,1319760000,10,650,3.9015151515151514
4691712,1,B005GM38NI,This movie has high production value and good acting.  But the store is not any good.  It is supposed to be a romantic comedy but it is more like a romantic tragedy.  Not worth the money unless you just like to watch everything go down hill.,1319673600,4,241,4.195652173913044
4691713,4,B005GM38NI,".......almost all of us.  Read on to find out how).

  This isn't as well done as ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shelter/dp/B0013D8LCW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shelter</a>"".....nor quite as good as ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Latter-Days-Unrated-Edition/dp/B0002I84JO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Latter Days (Unrated Edition)</a>"".....BUT it's not far off their mark

A CAST OF ENGAGING CHARACTERS (making up the Devilish and Age-old TRIANGLE):

- Tommy Miller (Guy #1) - (played by: Ian Novick) ---- To date, a smaller parts actor.  Yet, this film shows he merits so much more....if nothing else, for the cute hunkiness and honesty he brings to Tommy....a Guy who grabs our hearts....a Guy who's In Pursuit.  ""T"" is Open...he's Out...knows the man he wants....and he takes us along on the joyride to get him.  He's an upfront Guy, who tells it like it is.  A Mister Personality....most definitely deserving of that capital ""P"".  Of our two male lead characters, Tommy's ""The One"" you're most likely to fall for.  And you will have a ball while doing so.

- Daniel (Guy #2) - (played by: Jon Prescott) ---- Lots of TV series work....yet with a plum film role in 2010's gay-related, ""Howl"", playing the James Franco character's oft-time lover.  Here, in this story, he's playing the built and pretty Daniel....an emotionally torn man, suffering a severe case of ""Closetophobia"".  Perhaps now's a good time for the question:  WHO is the love of this man's life?  Is it the fiance and wife-to-be?  Or is it, perhaps....what's that Guy's name, again?  Oh, and you should watch for what is, to me, the somewhat puzzling way in which Prescott plays this role:  facially expressive with other characters in the film.....BUT, strangely, almost always detached looking / fairly expressionless in his scenes with Tommy.

  AN ASIDE ABOUT DANIEL ---- Did ANY of you out there, having seen this film, realize how very many guys Daniel's life represents?  A man, like so many of us, who becomes engaged...marries and fathers a child....all the while never facing up to who he is, sexually.  How many of us are living this kind of life, one which Family...Society...expects of us?  A life which is not really our own...not who we really are?  Should it be at all surprising how many of us are Daniels

- Jen (The One Stuck in the Middle) - (played by: Margaret Anne Florence) ---- Quite a bit of TV work...with 3 or so lesser movies thrown into the mix.  Jen is a pert and pretty gal, as both fiancee and bride.  A level headed woman, very much in love with her man.  YET, she's a someone who unknowingly comes to meet and grow quite friendly with ""The Other Man"".  In doing so, Florence pulls it off in a most believable manner.  Even though you and I are watching her through guys' eyes....she'll MAKE us deeply feel both her happiness and her despair.  Be prepared.

A LAST THOUGHT (I told you at the beginning to watch for this):

- For those of you UNhappy with the way in which this film SEEMINGLY ends....in a less than romantic way (yes, I've looked at your reviews and displeasure here and there)....just read on.

- Aaah, yes.  So, Tommy...Our Mister Upfront Guy.  See...right about here is where you movie watchers should be remembering...recalling that really important thing he's already told us (more than once).  What?  What is it, you ask?  ....THAT HE IS IN LOVE...IN TRUE LOVE...(something he's also told the object of his affection).  SO...you doubters out there....put all such thoughts aside.  For there is NO way in which a man like the Tommy we've come to know...with his depth of feelings...would just walk away from ""The One"".  From that person who he just learned has again become available.  NO way in which a caring sort like Tommy would leave another man waiting at the altar.  Unless.....UNLESS he has very definite plans to reenter the life of ""The One"" (though he may wait a bit...just to make a Someone squirm).  And if you think otherwise about this, then ""T"" has, indeed, Totally Faked you out.  So....BUCK UP!...CHEER UP!......in the REAL ending of this film, you're going to get exactly what you were hoping for.  HAPPY viewing!

4691714,1,B005GM38NI,"I just do not agree so far with the one other review. I based my decision to purchase based on this review. I watched the first two to ten minutes of the movie, and pressed eject. First scene is of a verbal exchange with the protaganist, and a gay male friend who worships people who look perfect... Seems to hate his own body, and is stereotypical of gay men in general, I found it offensive. I may give this movie another chance, but not sure when.

Horrified is my response. love your body, love your cells, as GOD is not giving you another one. No wonder so many gay men and lesbians, hate their bodies, smoke, get over weight, and abuse drugs and alcohol. Sorry, just annoyed BIG TIME!",1319500800,4,690,4.348837209302325

4691723,4,B005GM38NI,"Complicated, well done by and large. Honest performances.",1467504000,,57,6.25
4691724,3,B005GM38NI,"The performances in general where good....There where moments between the two men that worked amazingly and other moments seemed to be discarded as unimportant.  This was a mistake in directing....I don't want to sound sexist but a woman can not direct to men in love....sorry....it just doesn't work....there is NO WAY for a woman to know what that is as there is no way for me as a man, a gay man, to know what it's like in the emotional depth of Lesbian love....We all know what love is but passion is expressed very differently.
Jon Prescott's performance was the glue that held the entire piece together.  The moment his wife, in full out hysteria, accuses him, OUTS him, forcing him to confront his deepest fears and humiliations with no where to run or hide....that moment  as expressed on Jon Prescott's face, no words, just the little frightened boy...shattered my heart.  Perhaps it was a budget issue but the film, the writing, the direction, I'm not sure what happened but it lost its way....and the ending just didn't make sense....How was it possible for Tommy to say goodby and turn away from this man who's life was just torn apart....Yes her life was torn apart also....but the story wasn't about her....because she left....but the main character losses both people he loves plus his soon to be born child!  ts dealt with a quite moment in a park, a book left behind on a rock and a baby stroller  being pushed under a small park bridge.....the tunnel and book symbolic to leaving the old behind while walking through the umbilical darkness with the newly birthed baby into the light on the other side......There is light at the end of the Tunnel!.

4691731,2,B005GM38NI,"Another one to disappoint me. I love Directors who Portray realistic people. Straight, Bi, Gay and In-Between, Mixes. This's yet one more who takes a Stab at turning Gays into Liars, Warp-Headed, Sick-O Freaks (just a few Stereotypes). The movie's about a guy who sees a another Man who decides he's going to ""get into his pants."" Maybe make a relationship out of it for a short time. Yeah. We never quite know the guys real story, that's really the story line. We do know he's a liar throughout the story (EZ to see it). Both guys are good looking, naturally. His intended Man is engaged to a Nice Woman whom he loves. Still he does seduce the Man. A guy can enjoy both sexes. But, he falls in Love with the Liar. In the end,  he ends up married to the woman, she carrying his child, she discovers he still loves that guy who's now with another & leaves him. He in turn wants him back... Stereo type comes in... Flighty warped original lying guy exposed by his Mom... Married guy left all alone. Pathetic ending.",1426723200,3,1013,4.4171122994652405

4691733,5,B005GM38NI,The One is a movie that I would have given a 4 1/2 stars because I was not real pleased with the ending...but that has nothing to do with the acting or the story.

4691734,2,B005GM38NI,"This movie has nice production values and a good cast. The really disappointing part of the film is the ending. I don't know what the writer was thinking but you shouldn't end a film with no resolution at all. Everything builds up to what you think is going to be a nice
ending- then the credits start rolling! Did they run out of money? Are they planning a sequel? Can someone tell me why they
can't make nice romantic gay films? I can't recommend this film unless you enjoy frustration.",1404691200,3,488,4.433333333333334
4691735,4,B005GM38NI,"Through the movie, I was overwhelmed by how much and how well the story captured reality for a gay man caught up in pleasing everyone but himself.  Even in today's world of marriages now being extended to gays, there are many gay men that suppress themselves, their needs and emotions in order to meet everyone else's needs...and in the end, as the movie portrayed, the gay man has little.  I walked this road as have many of my friends, this film did so well in showing the emotions of all involved.  Every man that has even an inkling of being gay and considering marriage should be required to see this film.  A great lesson from the film, be honest with friends, fiancs, and oneself before commitments and events happen that will multiply the pain and anguish many fold to undo.",1400630400,3,782,4.564285714285714

4691737,5,B005GM38NI,"There is much to be said for this film.  It is deep and filled with lots of unexpected turns.  I specially enjoyed this film because it dives into the realm of real raw emotion-just the way people feel and think.  The way the main character is conflicted about his values vs his true emotions mixed with societal/family expectations was developed very well.  The film is also a very intelligent, well crafted piece of real life and about how things work out due to unforseen circumstances.  It is also a cautionary tale of what happens when you allow true relationships to  linger for too long without really showing the way you feel.  People, as with life, move on, so the message to the story is clear.  Do not take people for granted because once that relationship that was special is gone, it is hard to regress back to how things were.  In short, ""The One"" is about living life to the fullest with all of its consequences.  A film definitely worth watching.",1396051200,2,962,4.573099415204679

4691739,2,B005GM38NI,"Spoiler alert. This movie was going so well, great cast, and an OK story line but it all goes downhill from there. The first seduction scene is missing from the film, and the coming out to the parents scene is ridiculously short, and there is no romantic sex scenes at all, this film just fails to deliver!  If there was an award for the film with the most pathetic ending, then this film would definitely be in the running to win! The ending made the whole of the rest of the film seem pointless. What a shame! It is times like this I wish DVD's came with alternate endings because I definitely didn't like this one.

It started as a romantic search of love, and diverted to a self indulgence of pleasure with no regard of consequences, and left us hanging to a less than ideal outcome. The ending does not justify the title or the start of the plot. It should have been titled Me, Myself and I !",1350086400,6,339,4.074626865671642
4691746,5,B005GM38NI,"OK, I'll admit the cover is a blatant attempt to sucker people into thinking this film is a comedy. It's not a comedy. If anything it's a tragedy.

The foundation upon which this film rests is a quote from the Jean Paul Sartre play, No Exit: Man is what he wills himself to be. (The main character majored in philosophy in college. Socrates is even quoted at one point in this movie.) Early on the viewer is given the reason for Daniel's actions. His father instilled in him the need to have total self-control over his life. One can extrapolate from that confession that the father's lifestyle is the model upon which Daniel will base his own life. The decision was made on his part to disavow his own feelings, needs and desires to attain a life that reflects his father's life. And here lies the weak link in Daniel's plan. He is not his father. He proves that to be the case when he realizes he has feelings for Tommy.

To what degree can we judge Daniel? He is imperfect. But then, so are we all. As a mature thinking man, I accept the fact that people make mistakes. It's part and parcel of who we are. What I cannot accept is the ease with which people judge others for their imperfections. Daniel made choices that hurt others. But, those same choices hurt himself deeper than it hurt the others. At the end of the movie he has lost the two people who meant the most to him. And, he must live with the knowledge that his actions were the reason for his situation. Ultimately he failed his father by trying to be like him. Yet, near the end of the movie when his father learns of his son's true nature his response is that no matter who his son is he still loves him.

For those people who wanted a happy ending I can only say that life does not always hand us the things we want. Man cannot will himself the things he wants in life. It doesn't work that way. We must earn our rewards. At the end of the film I believe Daniel has reached a point where, after all the destruction that has occurred, he can begin to rebuild his life based upon his own feelings, needs and desires. We need only remember that he knows how to get in touch with Tommy's mother. If there is a desire to attempt a reconnection with that person he loves, there is an avenue available for him. All is not lost. He only needs to figure out if that is what he wants in his life.

The One is a much more professional looking film than the average gay movie is. There is a real intelligence behind the words. An unrealistic happy ending was not tacked on to please viewers. There is a sense of integrity about it that turns people off. But I contend that speaks more about the people wanting a Pollyanna ending than about the film itself. I highly recommend The One for those people who are not fearful of thinking while watching. Viewing a film is more about what we bring to the experience than what the film brings to us. A good film provokes the thought process from the viewer. This is what The One does.",1346112000,4,2986,4.279646017699115
4691747,1,B005GM38NI,"it is no wonder the best characters in this flick are the two females:  the sad-sack fiance and the mother of the gay predator; the flick was made by women.  the two male characters at the core of this flick (one of whom is way too attractive and the other way too NOT) are stereotypes at best.  are we really supposed to empathize with the hunky dude who wants his cake and eat it too; who is so obsessed with having the perfect preppy life, he'll do anything to make it so?  are we supposed to see ourselves in the gay predator who is simply adding another notch on his bedpost (wreaking havoc on the way)?  i have the distinct feeling this flick was made backwards from the really lame ending:  making the 'plot' fit; the end justifies the means. well, i have a word for the makers of this fiasco,

The characters are depressingly shallow and the story is a queasy collation of unhealthy gay fantasy, laced with internalised homophobia.  Tommy scores the hitherto straight jock and instantly decides he's ""The One"".  There's nothing in the script to suggest this is about anything other than Daniel being ""straight""/virginal and (sorta, kinda) hot.  (Gay seduces Straight fantasy - check).  Our ""hero"" then pursues his quarry relentlessly, inviting him on a weekend away under false pretences, befriending his fiance, pretending to be straight to go on a double date with the newlyweds - and never stopping to wonder if any of this might be morally questionable, or evidence of a serious lack of self-esteem.  Yet we're supposed to like this guy, and then like Daniel when he starts to succumb.  I don't think so.

I'm sure there are still guys who'll find all of this a turn on.  But they need therapy not a twisted romantic drama to fuel their hopeless fantasy.",1333065600,14,1141,4.9267015706806285

In a few words - it's yet another story about a guy who has problems with his own sexuality, thus he hurts everybody around.
What I liked the most about this film, was the actress who played mother of the main gay character.
There are parts in the screenplay that sound and look quite fake (for example the ending scenes, or the scenes with french rap music in background (he????french rap???).
On the other hand, knowing the ability of US cinema makers to create real gay-theme nightmares, ""The one"" isn't entirely bad.",1323043200,11,713,4.622047244094488

I would have given this 3-4 stars but the ending totally soured me on the movie. It was almost like they ran out of money and said ""ok..lets just finish here."" There was no resolution it just stopped. And can anyone tell me what the closeup of the discarded book left in the park by Daniel was all about in the last scene. Was that significant or meant to mean anything? I couldn't make out the title of the book so if there was a message there then I lost it....

Years later, he spots Daniel in a sports bar, engages him in conversation and - many beers later - manages to get him in his bed, which Daniel claims is a first for him.  Unfortunately, he follows that up by explaining that he considers himself straight, and is engaged to marry a wonderful girl, Jen (Margaret Anne Florence).  Disappointed, Tommy makes it a point to ""run into"" Daniel (and often Jen) on several occasions, testing to see if the feelings he felt for Daniel, which he seemed to share to some extent, might make him change his mind about the marriage.

Writer/Director Caytha Jentis presents an engaging and emotional, yet very realistic, portrayal of a young man who has repressed his attraction to other men for so long, he has no idea how to deal with the feelings he experiences with the person who truly might be ""The One"" for him.  There is significant heartache along the journey, and == SLIGHT SPOILER ALERT== much less than a ""happily ever after"" ending, which some viewers have complained about in their reviews. Hey, life does throw some nasty curve balls once in a while, and you're not always going to be able to hit one out of the stadium.  I give the writer credit for taking the difficult, but likely more realistic, path here. == END OF SPOILER ALERT == The acting was quite good, and, despite an indie budget, I had no beef with the production quality.  DVD extras include a couple of deleted scenes, bloopers, and a couple of vanity items.  I give it four stars out of five.",1320710400,5,1666,4.60472972972973
4691755,1,B005GM38NI,"Despite the positive sounding title, and the promising start and premise the film's ending is a complete disappointment and, like other reviewers, just made me angry.  It is by no means a romantic comedy and is certainly not The One!  It just made me wonder what the point was (and wishing I hadn't wasted my money on it).",1320364800,9,322,4.5344827586206895

8471830,2,B005GM38NI,"I gave it two stars because it's shot well. The acting is so-so - competent but uninspiring, with no real chemistry between the leads, but that could be a directing issue.

The main character comes off as a psychopath, so it's hard to have any sympathy for him, and psycopaths destroy everything they come into contact with, so you can guess how the ending will go within 10 minutes. I also don't understand how a hyper-closeted man decides to get involved with a stalker who radiates creepiness.

It's totally implausible that a philosopy major is so un-selfaware that he could not understand he's gay, or that his worldly, strong and intelligent fiance can't see any red flags, like a 20-something man who never wants to have sex... I'm really tired of coming out films depending on clueless delusional women.  Also, there's no character consistency - one minute the closeted guy is nervous and looks sick, the next he's ripping off the psycho's clothes. Then he's nervous and looks sick, ad infinitum. Zero character development.

Also, this is absolutely not a comedy - like seriously not. I can't fathom why it's marketed as one - the cover pic definitely says 'comedy'.",1505520000,,1175,4.86
