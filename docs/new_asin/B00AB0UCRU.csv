8549486,5,B00AB0UCRU,"""Hard Style ABS"" by Pavel Tsatsouline of Dragon Door is an excellent collection of advanced abds exercises well documented, well explained,  and well imaged.  This is not a book for beginners in fitness, but is the latest in a long line of books on advanced fitness from the Dragon Door Publications.  Many well known experts such as Gary Cook (Movement:  Functional Movement Systems) are quoted.

This is a book with ""one goal - an extraordinarily strong and developed 'six-pack' -- and no other"" (from the first line of the introduction of the book.)  Throughout the book are many lessons on abs development and much science to back up what is said.  The writing style is hard hitting, as befits book with Hard Style"" in the title, but clear and concise.  As usual for Pavel, he is most dictatorial in his directions. Fortunately he has dropped yelling ""comrade"" at the end of every sentence, as he did in his early works.  (I have not seen the video version of this book.)  But he does say, ""The Party is never wrong,"" at least once in the book.  But the goal (one) and the purpose (one) of the book come through loud, strong and clear.  And his technique for abd development is solid.

The actual program is on pages 95 - 96.  It is an advanced, difficult workout program.  There is room for variation and modification.  There are chapters written especially for the contact sports and for fighters of all stripes.  On page 98 are directions for integrating this program into Pavel's other programs.  Be warned, Pavel does state that these workouts have to be scaled when combined with his other programs, or will over work the core section, as some of his other programs already work the abds hard.

This is not a book you can just pick up and start working out immediately.  There are lots of hints, directions, individual exercise explanations on technique, pitfalls and traps to avoid throughout the book.  Without these explicit directions, many of the exercises drop back from hard hitting abd development  to ""accoutrements of 'functional training.' (Introduction)  Pavel has taken three of those ""accoutrements"" and pushed them into hard, tough, ""proven strength training methodologies.""  The changes may seem small, but do make the exercises more effective for strength development. To be fair, Pavel does say in the Introduction ""Not because [acccoutrements of functional training] are useless -- far from it -- but because they are unable to produce real 'body armor.'  Don't blame a fork for being a poor knife.""

There are no diet directions in this book.  I assume Pavel assumes anyone undertaking this program is already at a body fat of less than 10%.

If you are already a follower of Pavel and Dragon Door, or if you are already working out hard and are in good shape, this book will give you a tool to develop  ""an extraordinarily strong and developed 'six-pack."" If you are just beginning in fitness, go back and pick up Pavel's earlier works (e.g. ""The Naked Warrior"" or ""Enter the Kettlebell."" or find another path.",1360368000,4,3041,4.827852998065764
8549487,4,B00AB0UCRU,Very nice instructions and easy to understand.  I learned a lot for the book and start working out as soon as I read it.  I highly recommend the Hard style Abs for anyone.,1359504000,,171,4.151515151515151
8549488,5,B00AB0UCRU,"I am impressed with this program. I work on it every day. I am already improving my performance in my pull ups, leg raises and sit-ups. I do not expect, at age 77, to develop Mr. America six-pack abs. But I am getting stronger, day by day, following the program. I would recommend it to anyone.",1352073600,3,294,4.267857142857143
