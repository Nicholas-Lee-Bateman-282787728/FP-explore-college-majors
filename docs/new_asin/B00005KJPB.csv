8171595,3,B00005KJPB,"The best part of this dvd is the interview with Steve Binder. He gave insight into Elvis' strengths and weaknesses in his career path. No, the dvd doesn't have music, but that you can get elsewhere.",1194307200,,198,4.527777777777778
8171596,1,B00005KJPB,"This DVD does not remember Elvis, it remembes trains. For a beginner, this is lousy, because if you are unfamiliar to Elvis, you should start with a little MUSIC (what a consept!), of which this tape lacks completely.  This is even worse than the Beatles' Celebration, which is also unofficial and musicless.  My point:  DON'T waste your money on this ...!  Get the new boxed set, or even the Alternate Aloha.",1030752000,3,409,4.71830985915493
8171597,2,B00005KJPB,"This is probably one of the most unusual documentaries where you rarely even hear elvis speak. A reviewer at Amazon.com stated there are more trains than anything. Well, not far from the truth. However, for a beginning fan, who's just entering the Elvis world, this would be a great introduction. There are some rare film clips in this, although not in the best picture quality. It would give a beginning some insight to one of the most influential singers of the 20th Century. Not to mention my personal favorite :)",1016064000,5,516,4.7444444444444445
8171598,1,B00005KJPB,"This DVD was a real disappointment.  There is so much to remember about ""The King of Rock N Roll"" but not even his music is featured in this lame attempt at documenting his career.  There were more trains in this ""documentary"" (the trains being a reference to his fast-moving rise to stardom) than information about his life.  OK for train buffs but lousy if you're an Elvis fan.",992476800,10,379,4.544117647058823
