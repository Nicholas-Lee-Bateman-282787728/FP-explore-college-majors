The plot is simple enough: Eikichi Onizuka, a former bike gang member, college karate champ, 22 years old and a bachelor, has taken it upon himself to be the world's greatest teacher. with little or no qualifications, he somehow gets accepted into a prestigious school, is assigned the worst class of delinquents ever, and proceeds to work on taming the adolescent beasts.
Simple plot, complex protagonist. Onizuka is the definition of ""man-child,"" the battle with the man and the child within him always in conflict. This is key as the series plays up the ongoing battle between the students and adults, be it teachers, administrators, parents or politicians. Onizuka is into videogames, internet porn, costumes, launching bottle rockets and ogling schoolgirls. At the same time he has a better sensitivity toward the real causes of the students problems, be it parental conflict, bad past experiences with teachers, money or bullying. Then again, he likes to deal with his problems in the most unorthodox methods, i.e. beating up students.
Just like standard fighting animes, Onizuka has to deal with various opponent-students during the course of the series. Bully Aizawa Miyabi, teacher-humiliator Urumi Kanzaki, super-smart Kikuchi, and fierce Kunio Murai, as well as the various teachers and administrators, particularly vice-principal Uchiyamada.
The art is on a par with Dragonball Z, and watching this series in Japanese is *necessary*! Not only are their numerous word jokes (that a student is suffering a trauma, pronounced ""tora-uma"" evokes an image of a giant tiger-horse animal in Onizuka's mind), or that the English teacher struggles with and forces English, the story has pretty significant differences from the English to the Japanese version. The Japanese vocal cast is far superior, and the vocal intonations better match the facial expressions; the storyline and what they say are far more risque and naughtier than the English dub as well.
This is an odd DVD collection to stop at Vol. 7. The series is a 43-episode set, so at a clip of four to five episodes a disc, there should only be about three to four volumes upcoming, max. Also, Vol. 7 ends on the biggest cliffhanger in the series yet (Onizuka always faces the threat of losing his job each time, but this one is huge), and Volumes 8 and 9 provide the closure to that series as well as the start of a different phase.
However, you'll get the all important first volume, where Onizuka's teaching tactics first develop, before joining Holy Forest Academy. There's also Vol. 4, ""The Test,"" which is by far the best of the series, involving numerous storylines, and introducing Urumi Kanzaki. That Vol. 4 was so good probably explains why Vol. 5 feels like it drags along, and makes it the weakest one of the series.
The extras are nothing more than character sketches, previews, montages, and an interview with the creator in Japanese.
A great series that makes commentary on a real life societal situation in Japan, with the paranoia of students toward adults, that is much more accentuated than here in the states. Also recommended are the Live Action GTO TV Drama Series (for which the final episode was the most watched ever in Japan) which follows the anime and manga storylines loosely (characters are made into composites, and Onizuka is more real-lifey), as well as the GTO live action movie that takes place after the live action series.
Highly recommended series, but waiting for the US releases to complete and to arrive in boxed-set form would be better.",1054944000,16,3763,5.041733547351525
