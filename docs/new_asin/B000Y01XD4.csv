3010227,5,B000Y01XD4,"Jason Gibson is a master at teaching complex subject matter in a manner that the most challenged student can appreciate. I love his entire series. I use his series for SAT, GACE, PRAXIS, PSAT, end of course and exit exam reviews. He is an excellent teacher.
I bought his entire series for my high school advanced math students, and my grandchildren.",1223856000,5,349,4.737704918032787
3010228,5,B000Y01XD4,"I'm a thirty year old husband and father that decided to go to college. My only drawback so far has been algebra. I thought I was just a lost cause, but these videos have helped me understand what was once Greek to me. Jason Gibson holds your hand through these videos and calms you down just before you start to freak out. He warns you when a big word comes up and calms your fears by breaking it down into simplistic terms that anyone can understand.
  I once thought I wasn't a ""math person"", which is a silly thought. Imagine all the illiterate people there would be if you could give up on learning to read by saying I guess I'm just not a ""reading"" person. Give these videos a chance and once he explains it all to you theres a chance you'll discover you were actually a ""math person"" all along.",1209945600,13,801,4.2631578947368425

3010231,5,B000Y01XD4,I got it for the algebra word problems. I didn't have too many word problems in school. I was just given an equation and asked to solve it. I thought it would be fun to learn word problems and brush up on my skills and have an extra challenge in my spare time. And if you are already familiar with algebra it shouldn't be too challenging.,1379894400,,338,4.136363636363637
3010232,1,B000Y01XD4,Save you money...There are better quality videos on You Tube that do a better job of reinforcing the word problem solving concept.,1366588800,,130,4.954545454545454
3010233,5,B000Y01XD4,"There is really no way to put out a DVD with every kind of word problem you will get exposed to.  Just look at any algebra textbook and you will see each section probably has 30+ word problems at the end of the problem sets.  What Jason does here is take some of the more common types of problems you will see, and the kind that are the most ""test friendly"" meaning they will not take a lot of time to work through once you can interpret them and walks you through step-by-step how to properly read, translate, and interpret the problem.  Then, once you get it from word form to equation form, how to solve the problem.

What is great about Jason's products, especially at the lower levels, is that he does not assume you know more than you do about the subject.  So he really spoon feeds you the information and shows every step, even steps you may be able to do in your head.  Once you get to some of is more advanced material he does make assumptions that you will know more, but even then tends to go step-by-step.

I have worked my way through the calculus sequence at my school, and am working through physics now.  I have really found that the key to word problems is to figure out what they are giving you in the problem, what they are asking you to find, and how to relate the two.  What Jason does in this DVD and his physics DVDs is provide you with a strategy of what to look for in the wording to get through that process.  And once you have the ability to do that, you can use it to solve other problems even though they are different than the kind on the DVD.

If you think you can learn from watching a recorded lecture of a guy in front of a white board doing problems, then I highly recommend any of Jason's videos.  They have helped me immensely in getting through math and physics, and while I still need to work hard doing homework and studying the material as presented in class, I attribute much of my success to these videos.",1342915200,3,1949,4.223719676549865
3010234,5,B000Y01XD4,"We enjoyed the DVDs. The instructor starts with the basics and moves to the challenging in an engaging manner.  He is organized in his presentation and encompasses the big picture by using real-world examples.  Although he uses a simple white board, his drawings and writing are clear and his explanations are usually concise.  He has a website which shows clips of the DVDs if you want to see examples of his teaching.  We recommend these for anyone who needs extra help or review in Algebra or any of the upper level math courses.",1336953600,2,532,4.688172043010753
