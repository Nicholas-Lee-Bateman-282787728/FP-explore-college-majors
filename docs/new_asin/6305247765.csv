7886072,1,6305247765,"I purchased this DVD because I have been to Vienna a couple of times with my wife (she was born there) and I was hoping it would be as good as the Naxos DVDs I have of Vienna and Salzburg, no such luck.

The video quality is poor being grainy with too much edge enhancement.  My copy also had two glitches that caused it to jump a few frames and/or freeze.

Audio was in the form of six Strauss waltz's. All sounded like they were old, poor quaility analogue recordings with a very compressed dynamic range and little bass.

The worst aspect of this DVD is its content. Approximately one third of the running time is taken up with images of a couple waltzing in a variety of nondescript parks around Vienna. When something of interest in Vienna is shown, it is often a montage made up of oddly angled close-ups of statues and windows of half a dozen Viennese landmarks.

The one bright spot of this DVD is the footage of 'Grinzing', an area of vineyards and Heuriger's, the highlight of this DVD.

The menus scene selection is totally useless because:

(A) It provides 8 scene selections for the 6 waltz's so most take you to the middle of a waltz rather than to it's beginning.

(B) All the little video images accompanying each scene selection shows trees and the couple waltzing in the nondescript parks. Totally useless.

Extras included a 5 question trivia game, a biography of Strauss and an instrument background that provides you with the vital information that you blow into some instruments. Overall a pretty poor effort.",947030400,6,1531,4.599264705882353
7886073,1,6305247765,"When you like Vienna and not be able to buy a proper cityguide on VHS or DVD you can buy this DVD. When you are looking for a good piece of music with the joy of Strau&szlig; then do not buy this CD. The quality is worse,  performance is even worser! I heared better for less!",946857600,12,276,3.9285714285714284
