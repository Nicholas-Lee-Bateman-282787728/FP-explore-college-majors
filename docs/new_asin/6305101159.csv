7883049,3,6305101159,I thought this was the movie I watched many years ago and it wasn't.  Kind of corney,1413676800,,84,3.9411764705882355
7883050,2,6305101159,Don't buy it.  I tried to give it away and no one would take it.,1411430400,,64,3.2666666666666666
7883051,1,6305101159,"The worst documentary on Nostradamus we have ever seen.  The acting by the presenter is horrible and the rest of it is just plain stupid.  It doesn't really give you any good information on Nostradamus's predictions and none of his predictions for the future.

Our recommendation, Pass on this one!",1161734400,4,298,4.92
7883052,3,6305101159,"It is a good program if you would like to know about Nostradamus but it wasn't what I expected. I had expected more detail about his prophecies but they were not dwelt on as much as his life was. That was okay. Alot of info I did not know about him. Again, Not what I expected but still a biography movie.",1043452800,7,305,4.016393442622951
7883053,3,6305101159,"This DVD doesn't take full advantage of the picture quality available to the format. I do like the recreations, and you have the advantage of being able to look at it when you want instead of waiting for cable channels to  play it.
The graphics are decent although you can tell its a transfer  from tape. The trivia quiz doesn't give a final score and it isn't very  long. Despite these shortcomings, it's a great buy. If you're building your  library right now as I am, this makes a great addition.",939600000,23,499,4.450549450549451
