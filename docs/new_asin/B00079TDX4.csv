8129364,4,B00079TDX4,"After the shock wore off of the entire audio portion of the DVD being in Japanese, I have thoroughly enjoyed using this DVD.

With no previous experience with Bojutsu, I have learned much from the DVD.  The video starts off showing your stances, strikes, and blocks from both the front and side view, them progresses through additional forms and kata.  And I have learned to count from 1 to 10 in Japanse as well.

I believe advanced practitioners of Bojutsu would not gain much from this video, except for the possibility of being able to practice the kata in the privacy of their own home.  But beginners such as myself can gain much from watching.",1181520000,9,650,4.6173913043478265
