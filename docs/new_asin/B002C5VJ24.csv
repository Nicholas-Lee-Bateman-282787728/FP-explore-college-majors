Hard to Get is fine escapist fare from the Depression-era that entertains me even today! The quality of the print I had could have been a little better but this becomes a minor quibble since the film itself has a plot that moves along well with good choreography and cinematography. The background musical score enhances the film and I really liked Dick Powell's singing ""You Must Have Been a Beautiful Baby"" by Harry Warren and Johnny Mercer. Dick Powell also performs an Al Jolson impersonation with his blackface (ouch) rendition of ""Sonny Boy;"" this is a sign of those times and although blackface isn't exactly my favorite thing to see on the screen we can't just hit the delete button to erase this and pretend these prejudices never existed.

When the action starts, we quickly meet a young spoiled heiress, Maggie Richards (Olivia de Havilland) who wants to stay in New York for the summer while her mother wants her to go to Newport to be with the rest of the family. (It's odd, though, that the rest of the family never seems to get to Newport as the movie progresses; but I digress and I doubt this is a major spoiler.) At any rate, Margaret takes the butler Case's (Melville Cooper) car into the country and stops off at a gas station when she unexpectedly runs low on gasoline. But there's just one problem-she can't pay for the gas because she has no cash on her; and station attendant Bill (Dick Powell) who works there with his buddy Roscoe (Allen Jenkins) insists that Margaret work off her debt then and there by cleaning the ten bungalows on site! Margaret tries again and again to sneak away but realizes that there's no way out; and she finally has to work off the debt.

And then Margaret wants revenge. She returns to the station and leads Bill to believe that she's really a maid in the Richards household and she even leads him on by making a date with him; then she sets Bill up by telling him a password so he can see her father Ben Richards (Charles Winninger) and his business associate Atwater (Thurston Hall) about a plan he has to build a chain of auto courts all across the country! This leads to many unexpected events and consequences for quite a few people involved as Bill tries again and again to pitch his business ideas all the while thinking that Margaret is really a maid. Look also for a dinner party sequence at Margaret's home in which Margaret must pretend she really is a maid and the real, somewhat ditzy maid named Hattie (Penny Singleton) pretends to be the heiress.

There's still more to the plot than this and I'll stop here so you can watch and enjoy this film as much as I did. Suffice it to say that the rest of the film shows how all of the issues work out.

Look also for solid performances by Isabel Jeans as Mrs. Richards; Grady Sutton as Stanley Potter; Bonita Granville as Connie; Granville Bates as Judge Harkness and if you look closely you can see Nella Walker as Mrs. Emmy Atwater.

Hard to Get is a rather good film for fans of the actors in it and people who appreciate lighthearted, escapist fare from the golden age of Hollywood will not be disappointed. True, there is that one brief scene with Dick Powell singing in blackface but the rest of what we get here is a good film.",1381104000,2,3260,4.47979797979798

3903864,4,B002C5VJ24,"""Does your dad appreciate
That you're merely supergreat
The miracle of any century?""

Brother, a guy sure knew how to court a gal back in the day - or in song, anyway. In 1938, HARD TO GET co-starred Dick Powell and Olivia de Havilland, two of the most disgruntled actors drawing a paycheck from Warner Brothers Studios. Both Powell and de Havilland were raring to land more dramatic roles, Powell having had enough of playing those boy crooner parts and de Havilland wanting something more meaty than being showcased in screwball comedies or in Errol Flynn adventures. So Jack Warner, sympathetic soul that he was, right away plonked them in another screwball comedy. What a guy! It won't be until 1944 that Powell would reinvent himself as a film noir actor in MURDER, MY SWEET. For De Havilland, prestige would arrive a lot sooner, as GONE WITH THE WIND - and her Supporting Actress Oscar nomination - was only a year away. And yet, as much as these two deserved the critical acclaim they would garner, I appreciate them most for their more lighthearted pictures. In de Havilland's case, I dug her comedies as much as her pairings with Errol Flynn. This is a longass paragraph that boils down to this: I utterly enjoyed HARD TO GET. So, thanks, Jack Warner, you inconsiderate git.

Sure, Olivia de Havilland is aces with the dramatic acting, but she's a hell of a lot more fun when she lets down her hair and acts the screwball dame. And, get this, whenever called on, she's ably demonstrated impressive comic timing. She's adorable in comedies like PRINCESS O'ROURKE, IT'S LOVE I'M AFTER, FOUR'S A CROWD, and GOVERNMENT GIRL. In HARD TO GET, she plays spoiled society girl Margaret Richards who develops a snit and tears away in the butler's car, and it's important to note that she's got no cent in her pocket. At the gas station, Maggie realizes that she's unable to pay the $3.48 she owes. She snootily tells the gas attendant - a skeptical Bill Davis (Powell) - that he'll be paid on the next day, but Bill ain't having it. Not believing Maggie's blue blood creds, he forces her to settle accounts by turning down beds at the gas station's adjoining inn. The humiliated Maggie vows bloody vengeance. And here comes the unwary Bill Davis straight into her trap.

Bill Davis is more than a gas jockey. He's also an aspiring engineer who dreams of founding a chain of auto courts. One of the most memorable (and funniest) sequences in this film is when Maggie tricks Bill into seeing her dad who then sics Bill on Mr. Atwater, an elusive financier who wants nothing to do with Bill and his business proposition. Bill hilariously resorts to assuming several disguises only to be ignominiously thrown out each time. Another comedic highlight is when Maggie decides to continue the charade of being a maid in her own household (named ""Maggie Case""). Bill Davis finds himself being invited to dinner and it's a hoot watching de Havilland exhibit awful domestic skills as she strives to serve up a fancy meal. Meanwhile, the actual maid (a delightfully ditzy Penny Singleton) steps into Maggie's shoes and pretends to be the young heiress, and she nearly wrecks the dinner party.

Powell's easygoing charm goes well with de Havilland's madcap spoiled brat turn, and we get good chemistry in their scenes together. And as these things are won't to do, mean-spirited sham turns into honest affection, and we're soon eyeballing Bill and Maggie romantically rowing in the lake, and there's the gibbous moon and here's Powell introducing the rather splendid Harry Warren/Johnny Mercer standard ""You Must Have Been A Beautiful Baby."" For my money, it's a much more memorable song than ""Sonny Boy,"" which Powell later belts out in blackface in his best Al Jolson impression. And I think we should all just move on past that fairly racial ""He went down the drain"" remark. Awkward.

Also worth keeping an eye on are amusing character actors Charles Winninger and Melville Cooper. One of the film's running gags is that Maggie's father (Winninger) insists on engaging his valet (Cooper) in strenuous physical activities like boxing, fencing, and wrestling. But Winninger isn't quite up to the task and would often resort to crying ""Foul!"" whenever Cooper gets the upper hand. It's a slice of slapstick heaven, not to mention Melville Cooper is a ton of fun as he seems to be impersonating Arthur Treacher. PRINCESS O'ROURKE will always be my favorite de Havilland comedy, but HARD TO GET is solid. I guess Jack Warner knew what he was doing when he teamed up these two unhappy campers for their second film together. Did you know HARD TO GET used to be a longer title? The full title used to be HARD TO GET A SERIOUS DRAMATIC ROLE. I may be lying.",1310601600,7,4737,4.764920828258222

3903866,4,B002C5VJ24,"If you only know Olivia De Havilland as the long-suffering Melanie in GONE WITH THE WIND, you will not recognize her here. She had some really fun roles in screwball comedy and this is one of the craziest.

In this gem she plays a spoiled rich girl who tries to charge some gas to her father's name, but the station attendant doesn't believe who she says she is. After making her clean the rooms at the adjoining motel to work off her gas bill, she seeks revenge. She returns to the station the following day pretending to be an upstairs maid, and apologizes for her behavior. After hearing of his plans to build auto courts, she sends him to her father (pretending he is her employer), and gives him her father's special nickname that will get him admitted to his office. Not knowing who he is, and annoyed that he gained admittance with his secret nickname, her father gives him a rough time, sending him on to a friend who repeatedly throws him out, but he keeps going back for a chance to explain himself. He is nothing if not tenacious.

When her father finally realizes that this young man is a victim of his daughter's plot, he invites him home for dinner. Now Olivia has to trade places with the maid to conceal her fib and the dinner doesn't exactly go smoothly.

Of course, she begins to fall for her foe (played well by Dick Powell), but doesn't know how to get out of the mess she has created and her father is enjoying watching her struggle for a change. Incidentally, the ongoing banter between him and his valet is a delightful highlight. This is not one of the top comedies of the day, but well worth a look.

Remember that DVD-R products (which is what this is) are not recommended for play in DVD Player/Recorders. They work best in players only.",1279324800,5,1764,4.452012383900929

The dvd case and disk were in perfect condition, and the digital quality and rendering was very good. The film could have been very similar to so many of the era; of a rich, spoiled girl who thinks she can do whatever she likes, and a hard working young man who sees life from the other side, but instead, the quality of the acting made the movie so much more entertaining. Olivia De Havilland and Dick Powell, both of whom I have always liked, along with the rest of the supporting cast, helped to make it an enjoyable comedy which was well worth watching.",1268524800,2,638,4.2809917355371905
