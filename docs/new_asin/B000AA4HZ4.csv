2383437,5,B000AA4HZ4,"I have been teaching Pilates for over a year now and I always welcome the opportunity for new creative ways to implement the practice. Janis does a wonderful job. Her moves are graceful, her cueing is impectable and I love the background music. I practice Pilates three to four times a week and after doing this entire video I woke up the following day and felt a difference.  My students were happy when I added some of Janis routines to my class. This video is great for all level since Janis begins each movement at a beginner level and works it up to advance. I love the way she progresses her movements. This video is on top of my list of Pilate videos.",1146787200,8,658,4.349593495934959
2383438,2,B000AA4HZ4,"Janis Saffell is a good instructor and her workouts are generally well-designed; however, this video was lacking.  My main complaint is it felt like half the workout was spent in the the downward-facing dog pose.  This has a couple of negative aspects: 1) too much strain on the wrists; and 2) very little time in standing poses that help to open up the hips and re-energize you.  I am not new to yoga, but my upper back ached the next day from all that in down-dog.  There are much better videos out there.  Though Janis' instruction is good, the design of the workout is lacking, and I would not recommend this to beginners.",1145836800,9,626,4.504424778761062
2383439,5,B000AA4HZ4,"I had found out about Janis Saffell because I picked up her Beverly Hills Yoga DVD (see my review of that on my amazon page). I've had a daily Yoga practice for the past 9 years and the main part of my home practice is driven by DVD/VHS programs so I'm always looking for more variety.

 Since I was extremely pleased with her Yoga DVD and I figured I'd give this Pilates disc a try.

Once again Janis came through!

 This is a very well done routine, all the poses start from a simple foundation and then build to harder variations. She does a beautiful job demonstrating the movements and is very pleasent to listen to (I have a difficult time with instructors who are too much like ""Rah Rah"" Aerobics teachers).

 While this is not ""Classic Pilates"", Janis's unique approach to the system is really interesting! In fact I think this creative approach is a really wonderful addition and complement to the more traditional Pilates programs out there. I also found that this DVD worked my body in a way that is a different but definitely complimentary practice to Yoga. I was certainly challenged!

In fact, I took the suggestion of someone who has been doing both Yoga and Pilates and followed the Pilates practice with some Yoga and that was perfection!

Though that is a personal preference I'm sure that many folks would enjoy this DVD as a practice in and of itself.

The routine, minus the introduction, take about 40 minutes from start to finish so it's long enough without being overwhelming.

Highly recommended!

2383440,5,B000AA4HZ4,"I purchased this program out of curiosity and must admit was fairly skeptical because of the title (something about ""Beverly Hills"" and ""Yoga"" being grouped together that doesn't seem quite right :)). But having been skeptical yet pleasently surprised by programs in the past (such as Kathy Smith's excellent Yoga Programs) and also because I happened to see this at a very discounted price, I couldn't resist taking a chance on it.

  I have to say that I'm glad I did, because this program would have easily been worth the full retail price. While I don't claim to be a Yoga expert, I have been practicing every day for about 9 years and have over 80 Yoga programs in my home library. I feel that I have a good idea of what constitutes a sound practice.

 Janis Saffell, like Kathy Smith, is a well known fitness instructor and likewise put together a really sound yoga practice. Often, it seems that fitness instructors can make a mess of a yoga program when they get their hands on it and bring that ""rah rah"" aerobics teacher mentality to it. Thankfully, Janis Saffell avoids that pitfall here.

 Though this program leaves out the ""spiritual side"" of yoga, Ms. Saffell certainly maintains an atmosphere of equanimity. She gives excellent verbal instruction (with a very soothing voice) and demonstrates the poses with beautiful body mechanics, no doubt a tribute to her background in dance.

 The actual sequence is very well done, in fact it's one of the most sound programs I've seen. She has lots of incremental movements that build to larger movements. She maintains a wonderful flow which keeps heat in the body and helps to gently and gradually open you up which prepares you for the more challenging poses to come.

 Timing in at almost exactly 45 minutes, it's long enough to be quite thorough but not so long as to be overwhelming. I would say that it's probably a late beginner to early intermediate level in terms of difficulty (though it has two poses that are quite challenging ""Side Plank"" and ""Revolved Crescent Lunge"").

 The only thing I would have liked at the end (and of course this is only a personal preference) would have been to finish off with a lying twist and then relaxation pose (Savasana). I just add those at the end on my own so it's no biggie and certainly doesn't detract from the overall excellence of this program.

 I would highly recommend this program for someone who wants a flowing, moderately challenging and straightforward Yoga practice. If you do this program regularly, you should be able to increase your flexibility as well as functional strength. I can definitely see this DVD playing a regular role in my own daily practice.

 Highly Recommended!

8076767,2,B000AA4HZ4,"The guidance in the video is lacking to say the least. If you have never done yoga before, this is not a good one to learn principles from. For example, the video starts with a breathing exercise. Janis does not direct you to breath through your nose. I mainly use yoga videos for the audio guidance only. Rarely was a pose given a name. I found myself having to watch the video to see what she was doing the entire time. This made it next to impossible to drop into the state of being I do yoga for.",1444521600,,500,4.112244897959184
8076768,4,B000AA4HZ4,"With a title of Beverly Hill Pilates, I wasn't expecting the outdoor scenary and also very nice soft background ballet type music and that was a pleasant surprise, very nice scenary and calming music.  I have only tried one other Janis workout in the past and did not connect with her as an instructor.  I am glad I gave this DVD a try because I think she is a fantastic Pilates instructor with great form and tips.  I like the way she talks you into the move so you can get the proper alignment and get the breathing in place as you extend into more advanced levels of the exercise.  I enjoyed the flow and elongating style of this workout and felt really good after the workout.  The slower pace did allow me to really get into the muscles well and can be used to build your strength as you practice the moves.  You will work and it is a nice challenge.  I was actually hoping there would be a 15 or 20 min consolidated faster moving segment at the end or as an add-on bonus segment but there isn't one.

In the beginning, it does seem a bit slow and I found myself a bit antsy the first 10 mins in but I now use this time to focus on the mind, body and breathing connection.  I will keep this workout in my collection as it is different than your traditional pilates workouts but doesn't stray too much into too much like some Pilates workouts that really are too fusioned with other disciplines for my tastes.  I can see myself reaching for this as an evening workout when I am tired but still want to do something.

I will also plan to use the beginning of this workout to help destress, stretch and unwind.  This would also be good to use to kick off an active rest day.

Minus one star for the amateur video editing that in my opinion detracted from the overall quality of the DVD.",1277424000,,1788,4.238938053097345
8076769,4,B000AA4HZ4,"This is a great workout that I seem to enjoy more each time I use it. Janis Saffell takes us through 44 minutes of flowing yoga which has been filmed beside a pool and in a relaxed apartment garden setting (reminding me of Melrose place without all the drama).

We begin with a wonderful series of neck and lower back stretches before progressing into a sequence of add-on sun salutations. Janis gives calm, fluid and precise instruction throughout and I didn't need to see the TV the entire time to know what to do. The standing postures section gets progressively harder and although I would consider this a beginner workout due to the amount of instruction given and lack of Sanskrit spoken. There are a couple of more advanced moves including Side Plank and in the Balance work section you will (try) to do Standing Head To Knee Pose. My only complaint with this workout would be the lack of floor work and non-existent relaxation at the end. I was very disappointed when after doing 2 quick forward bends the practice ended without any twists or stretches and I especially missed corpse pose.

Overall I would recommend BEVERLY HILLS YOGA due to the amount of times I've used it even though the picture is sometimes blurry and has a general feel of being cheaply done. I also wish there was an option to turn off the non-descript elevator music but that's just me.

Prepare for practice (6 min breathing, neck and lower back stretches)
Standing Postures (21 min)
Balance work (16 min more advanced)
Floor work (4 min and really lacking)

The only prop needed here is your mat, Namaste.",1258934400,,1590,4.667857142857143
8076770,5,B000AA4HZ4,This DVD is very challenging but allows you to work at your own ability with various options.  Looks a little homemade but does not take away from it's quality in instruction.,1240099200,,175,4.645161290322581
8076771,2,B000AA4HZ4,"This dvd is about 50 total mins, with the breakdown of: introduction- 4 mins, core work- 19 mins, leg work-9 mins, full body work- 12 mins, cooldown-6 mins.  Poor production quality, irritating instructor, and I wasn't loving the flow of exercises. I felt like there was an annoying amount of deep breathing exercises in the beginning and then most of the other exercises required either a lot of flexibility, or were just hard. I wouldn't recommend this for anyone looking to get their feet wet with pilates.",1209686400,2,509,4.850574712643678
8076772,2,B000AA4HZ4,"I purchased this DVD because I have used other DVDs by Janis Saffell, i.e. strike zone and brand new butt.  I really felt those two workouts the next day and I generally workout with very challenging DVDs (i.e. Cathe Friedrich, Jari Love, etc.).  This DVD is definitely for advanced beginners.  It really wasn't challenging.  However, if you are looking for a well cued workout and a relaxing not too challenging workout, this is nice, but I was hoping it would work my abs more.",1209427200,,479,4.666666666666667
8076773,5,B000AA4HZ4,"Don't let the calming music at the start of this workout fool you into thinking this will be a relaxing workout. The intensity increases throughout and there are many balance challenges. Janis Saffell does a unique roll up with legs crossed - something I've never seen in any other Pilates workout. She then takes you through a Double Leg Stretch which requires a good deal of core strength.

The Roll Over is for the adventurous and Bridge with leg extensions again tests your full body strength. Single Leg Stretch, Scissors and Criss-Cross follow. The exercise on all fours with a leg and arm extension tests your balance and core strength.

The garden setting is colorful with pink gardenias and vines climbing a wall. Janis Saffell works out on a turquoise mat and shows you how to obtain better posture and long lean muscles. While this workout claims to workout your entire body it mainly focuses on the core muscles and the legs. Plank does workout the upper body but upper body strength is not really the focus of this workout.

8076774,5,B000AA4HZ4,"Janis Saffell presents a calming yoga routine designed for intermediate practitioners. The relaxing garden setting by a pool adds to the nurturing aspects of the workout. The practice begins with gentle neck stretches then progresses into a series of swan dives. A vinyasa-style workout follows with an emphasis on plank and downward facing dog to ease you into various postures.

Cat/Cow appears once and most of the poses don't require extreme flexibility. Chair pose is not held for a long time and there is a modification called awkward chair pose where you are up on your toes. This creates a balance challenge that will be enjoyed by intermediates. A relaxing wide-leg forward bend stretches out the back of the legs nicely. You may also recognize triangle pose and warrior.

The poses flow together gently in a logical way and the soothing music and slower pace allows for an emphasis on breathing. This makes it a cleansing workout. You never feel rushed and each posture is held for the perfect length of time. Janis Saffell doesn't show some modifications for a few of the more difficult postures so I wouldn't recommend this for beginners.

8076775,2,B000AA4HZ4,"Like half the practice.

I think this must be aimed at people who are already quite physically fit, but are beginners at yoga.  There is too much instruction for an experienced yoga student, but there are some poses that are normally considered too challenging for beginners (in particular, an unmodified Side Plank).

After a decent warmup, most of the practice consists of Sun Saluations, to the point where I was really getting bored.  Then there is a standing pose series -- the strongest point of the video, I thought.  Finally, the instructor takes us to the floor for two quick forward bends and -- that's it.  No backbends, no hip stretches, no twists, and especially, no relaxation (Corpse) pose.

This is really not a complete yoga practice.",1154390400,5,751,4.866141732283465
8076776,5,B000AA4HZ4,"If you read any of my other reviews, you will quickly find I'm a big Janis Saffell fan.  I was somewhat skeptical that she could transition to doing as good a pilates wokout as her other strength/kickboxing videos.  I was pleasantly surprised by this video, she cues well just like her other videos and presents pilates in a very nice manner, increasing the difficulty of each move with modifications.  Most of the exercises are traditional with a few ""hybrids"" thrown in.  Her manner is nice and relaxed with complimentary music.  This is just a really good, nicely produced workout which I highly recommend adding to your rotation whether beginner or intermediate!  No disappointments here!",1151020800,5,692,5.026315789473684
