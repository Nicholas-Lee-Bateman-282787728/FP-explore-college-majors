Thomas Howell ""The Hitcher"" and ""Duel"". The scares just build and build. Got this for a college friend who'd never seen it. He said he didn't sleep that night.

4593409,4,B00571IMWK,"I absolutely LOVED the first Joy Ride.  Steve Zahn, Paul Walker and Leelee Sobieski were awesome!  I enjoy watching it over and over.  The second one, well it falls in the category of most sequels.  It is okay, not fantastic like the first, but the two-pack was worth the money.",1367107200,,278,4.5
