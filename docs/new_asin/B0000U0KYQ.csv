8323845,4,B0000U0KYQ,I purchased this book as part of my requirements to complete my yoga teacher training. I have found it to be quite enlightening.,1412380800,,128,4.608695652173913
8323846,5,B0000U0KYQ,"Someone in the study group I am in had asked me about Shambhala, as I had identified myself having taken the refuge vow with this lineage. The members of the group are mostly newcomers to the mindfulness practice of sitting meditation. The presentation by the Sakyong is hospitably congenial and conversational. The instructions are simple and clear.",1383696000,,350,5.157894736842105
8323847,5,B0000U0KYQ,"Excellent seller.  Sent it quickly. The book was like new, just as the seller stated.  As far as the book itself - it could have been 15 pages.  Good information, but Saykong Mipham rambles a lot, and says the same thing over and over only in different ways.  Still worth reading.",1255046400,,280,4.431372549019608
8323848,4,B0000U0KYQ,"This is an excellent DVD. Sakyong is the real deal and his teaching is deeply insightful and humorous (the ultimate sign of enlightenment). It is a great introduction to Buddhist philosophy and the importance of meditation -from a genuine master. The 21 minute ""guided meditation"" however, is not a guided meditation. It is more of a very thorough instruction on how to meditate.",1080864000,14,379,5.031746031746032
