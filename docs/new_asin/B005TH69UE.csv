8486191,5,B005TH69UE,I bought this movie because I'm learning Bulgarian and wanted to hear the language while reading the English subtitles. The movie did just that and was a pleasure to experience. Great story and great characters with beautiful scenes of Germany and Bulgaria. I also really enjoyed that the story reflected on the past when Bulgaria was a satellite of Russia.,1402012800,,357,4.966666666666667
8486192,5,B005TH69UE,"This movie is so moving, it makes you cry and laugh at the same time. The story of Alex who was in a car accident in which his both parents died and has amnesia and who through the movie with the help of his ""unknown"", larger than life grandpa becomes someone who knows who he is and where he comes from. The two man ride a bike from Germany to Bulgaria (where his family is from). You'll fall in love with the grandpa actor who is amazing in this Zorba like role.",1323043200,3,464,4.054347826086956
