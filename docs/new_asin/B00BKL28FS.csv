This is my 4th one and just like the other three I have ( Los Angeles, Chicago and Sydney this one is great. I have a Treadmill that uses iFit also which is a service that uses Google maps with your treadmill, these DVDs to me are just as motivating. I'll have them all before its over....LOL",1410307200,,391,4.36986301369863
