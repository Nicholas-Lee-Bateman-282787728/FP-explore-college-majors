7435864,5,B015G6WN98,"In the beginning of this new holiday movie you meet Dax. He is a high powered business man who is selfish, self centered, and does not care about anyone except himself. He has a fancy car, expensive home, and has a high opinion of himself.

Now Santa and his elf enter the picture. There is a contest to see who Santa's right hand elf will be. Santa sends an elf to help Dax pass the tests, but Dax has a lot to learn. You wonder if he will pass the test and become Santa's right  hand elf.

In this movie you will see Dax change. He learns kindness, patience, and to be true to yourself. Even though he had a difficult childhood, he uses his past to heal the future of a Youth Center that was an important part of his life.

There is laughter for the viewer. There may be cheering as you see Dax try to become the best person for the job Santa has for him. However there is also a surprise ending. Yes, Dax becomes important to Santa but he does not become the right hand elf. The twist in the story just makes this new holiday story even more endearing to watch.

7435865,4,B015G6WN98,"It feels a bit like a made for tv movie, but it's fun and silly in good ways.  You can tell that the whole cast had fun working on the project, and they take a lot of shots at themselves.  A instant classic, probably not, but a good holiday movie just the same.",1448323200,,261,3.9056603773584904
7435866,3,B015G6WN98,I had really high hopes for this one.  Paige's character needed more to carry the storyline.  It is a really cute holiday movie don't get me wrong but a small re-write would have helped.,1448236800,,186,4.4411764705882355

7435868,5,B015G6WN98,"At first, I had some questions about the movie and how it would unfold.  There is a fighting scene that caught me off guard, but it was to make a point.  Naughty or nice.  After that, and rethinking the movie, I am ready to see it again.  I LOVED it.  It has a lovely story.",1448150400,,274,3.909090909090909
7435869,3,B015G6WN98,"This is a mildly amusing, inoffensive Santa movie. There are a couple of laugh out loud moments. The Miz wearing a pointy green hat into a biker bar is really funny. You get to see AnnaLynn Mccord in a sexy outfit, followed immediately by the Miz in his undies for some equal opportunity eye candy. Just don't expect to see Paige. She's in less than 5 minutes of this movie. I was hoping to see Paige beating up the Miz through the whole movie.",1448064000,,444,4.2976190476190474

7435871,3,B015G6WN98,"Like most, Paige was the main reason I decided to check this out, so how did WWE's 2ns XMas movie with the Miz do?

Plot: Miz's character loses his job and as a result, loses everything he owns. He meets Anna's character who says there's a job offering for Miz and is faced with a challenge from Paige's character, who's also wanting that job.

Things I Liked:

- Paige. For her film debut, she did a great job and j found her believeable as a villian and fun to see:

- cultural references and Total Divas playing on tv in one scene.

Things I didn't Liked:

- Love story between Miz and Anna. It felt awkward at times and they didn't have amazing chemistry together. Solid album thorough.

- tr overall film felt like an ABC Family or showtime conpany.

- The backstory on a certain character was boring and unnecessary and a little forced.

So overall, a decent film for the family and kids and Paigr fans will enjoy seeing her as well.",1447804800,,939,4.350574712643678

7435884,2,B015G6WN98,"Three words: do not bother.

My wife picked this up at a Redbox for a post-Christmas film-night for our children & the family across the street. There's no such thing as accidents or coincidences. The family across the street couldn't make it & I should have paid attention. Did the neighbors know something we didn't? We wound up watching this straight-to-video movie all by ourselves. Even my children (ages 13 & 11) felt that this was the worst movie they've ever seen. That alone should speak volumes. The characters are one-dimensional. The settings are flimsy. The situations are poorly contrived & horribly acted. And if your Santa has to wear a fake beard, at least do a better job of make up.",1452297600,,701,4.745901639344262

7435889,4,B015G6WN98,"In the age of the internet, it's easy to be pretty cynical towards entertainment, nowadays. Especially those of low-budget movies. ESPECIALLY when produced by a company that hasn't put out quality material in it's day job since 2010, such as the WWE. Yes, WWE Studios have given us The Marine 2 through 4, and 12 Rounds 2 and 3, and.... well, a lot of other crap. However, a movie should be judged by it's individual merits and not who produces it.

""Santa's Little Helper"" doesn't have the best acting or even that much originality to it. But with that said, it's a good movie for what it is. It's the classic story of a bitter curmudgeon turned around by the holiday season and some Christmasy magic. The Miz may not be a likable (or even spectacularly skilled) WWE Superstar to many, however, he does have charisma, you can't deny that. And while nowhere near the level of The Rock, he has more of an ""everyday charm"" to him unlike John Cena. So that makes him pretty marketable on his own, unlike Cena who would be a poor man's Dwayne Johnson, to some.

So The Miz does shine here as a jerk hot-shot foreclosurer, Dax, who has had a bad life and grown bitter because of it, who gets fired from his job and loses everything, who gets a chance at a new beginning from one of Santa's tall blonde elves, Billie, played by AnnaLynne McCord, best known from The CW. Billie offers Dax a job at the North Pole as Santa's top assistant, the Ho-Ho-Ho, but only if Dax can pass a series of tests to prove his character. Saraya-Jade Bevis, aka Paige from the WWE, is the antagonist, a jealous, mean-spirtied elf bully named Elanor, who will stop Dax, a ""normie"" (human) from winning the job she feels is her destiny. The Miz and McCord have some chemistry; not great or amazing chemistry, but it's there. Bevis/Paige isn't the best actor, but she plays a jerk well, and pulls off her role as the antagonist well enough, here.

While the movie is nothing new or special, it's enough to not make watching it seem like a waste of time. What separates this from a 3-star to a 4-star is the fact that you actually feel good by the (admittedly) sappy 'feel-good moments' in the movie and cheap humor gags, involved. So, it's a good enough movie to be Made-for-TV (perhaps even network TV) and doesn't just feel like another $3 bargain bin DVD you've never heard of at the checkout aisle.

In other words, it's a good movie. Passable, at least. McCord and Miz have chemistry, Saraya-Jade Bevis/Paige is a good villain, although her character doesn't have nearly enough screen time to make you hate her as much as you should, and the movie ends as most Christmas movies do: leave you feeling all warm and fuzzy inside.

So yes. While 12 Rounds, The Marine 2, Inside-Out (with HHH), 12 Rounds II, See No Evil 2, and a load of other films they've done might be garbage, WWE Studios can say they have another movie on their ""it doesn't completely suck"" list with Santa's Little Helper. It can join the list of Scooby-Doo! WrestleMania Mystery, The Flintstones Stone Age SmackDown! and the few loosely associated ones they did starring The Rock before he became A-List.

So kudos to writers James Robert Johnston and Bennett Yellin, director Gil Junger, AnnaLynne McCord, and The Miz for giving WWE Studios a ""win"", for once with ""Santa's Little Helper!"" It's worth checking out, even if only as a cheap cable or Netflix rental. Now if only WWE's actual wrestling entertainment could show such signs of improvement...",1451174400,,3497,4.60513643659711

7435891,2,B015G6WN98,"We decided at the last minute to rent a movie on Christmas Eve. There wasn't much to choose from, so we ended up with this one. The beginning was incredibly painful to watch. Poor acting combined with sappy writing full of cliches and one dimensional characters doing very unrealistic things. Just awful. Then, somewhere, somehow, a little bit of charm came through and we kept watching. We watched the whole movie. Yes, it was awful and we laughed at so many things that the director didn't intend to be funny, but it was actually entertaining. We'll never watch it again, but it actually turned out to be a fun evening.",1450915200,,621,4.654545454545454

See if you recognize a subtle similarity to another ""classic"" non Christmas movie. :) If you happen to be in So CA, look for the Sam Morrison Band, and watch them perform, LIVE! :D Their music is also on Spotify under the same name.

7435903,3,B015G6WN98,"Dax (The Miz) is an arrogant cocky business man with no friends who hits a downward spiral by getting fired from his job & losing all the benefits from that along with his girlfriend dumping him leaving his future unknown before a woman named Billie (Anna Lynne McCord) comes to his doorstep to offer him a top position in a company but what Dax doesn't know is that Billie is one of Santa Clause's (Eric Keenleyside) little helpers from the North Pole who's looking for a new second in command.  Billie informs Dax that she can't reveal the job or her employer until he passes a series of unusual test to show personality traits in different environments while dealing with various issues from him confronting his past that lead to his change of attitude & one of Santa's elves named Eleanor (WWE diva Paige) making it clear that she feels entitled to the job & won't lose it to a ""normie.""

7435907,3,B015G6WN98,"Dax the Ax (Mike ""the Miz"") has just foreclosed on the Hope Springs Youth Center in Santa Monica...perhaps a pun intended.  In an act of irony, Dax the Ax gets the ax at work and must leave his house in an unrealistic time frame.  In a subplot, Santa's Little Helper retires and he must fill the position. He wants to give the job to Dax the Ax, a ""normie"" (muggle already taken) who he believes has the qualities to do the job...deep down. He tasks Billy (AnnaLynne McCord) a round eared mutant elf to test his qualities for the position. Meanwhile Eleanor (Saraya-Jade Bevis/ Paige) believes she deserves the job because her father had the job. She is portrayed  as being a mean person complete with a British accent. Her role is minimal.

If you have ever seen a film before, you have a good idea how this ends up. The path is slightly less predictable. The film is for kids. There is a bar room fight, although no one really gets hurt, but fists and objects fly. Certainly not worse than a Three Stooges episode. There is the use of the word ""freakin'"" as a substitute for a cuss word. Otherwise very kid friendly. AnnaLynne McCord provides eye candy for dad, and The Miz takes off his shirt for mom.

Not a bad film. Don't expect it to be an annual iconic classic.",1448755200,2,1269,4.405982905982906
