1247527,3,B00001U0I4,"Ok, Full Moon films are either hit or miss, so I'll skip any type of review and get right to the important stuff -- THE CONTENTS.  This is a double sided DVD.  On side one you get the feature film and a 15 minute feature called VideoZone.  Almost all Full Moon dvds come with VideoZone installments.  For the novices out there, the VideoZone is Charles Band's video magazine with news and previews of upcoming features and of course the mandatory making of the film section.  Pretty neat stuff with tons of cast interviews and a chance to see Phil Fondacaro guzzling Budweiser (priceless!)  Side Two has over 40 trailers from the Full Moon vaults and it's great to see current superstars Helen Hunt, Demi Moore, etc showing up as supporting players in many of Full Moon's classic series like Trancers, etc.  The quality of the movie transfer is excellent.  All of the graphics and colors are intact.  Some of the trailers are not up to par, but they probably are the best available.  Charles Band knows that these DVDs tend to be purchased, not rented, and he has taken the extra care to provide a little extra bang for your buck. Sit back, pop open your favorite beverage and enjoy this wacky stuff.",1005696000,8,1200,4.591549295774648
1247528,1,B00001U0I4,"When I saw a film full of midgets, and not just midgets, but moster midgets, the film was quickly snatched up for viewing. How could it go wromg?
Quite easily. The plot makes no sense. The main character works at a video store and wants to be a detective. Some brainless chick keeps coming back to him. An hour passess, no midgets.
Then there be midgets! The scenes where the midgets chase after ""victims"" (which is really us the viewer) are grand. The lil' guys are up to no good and hi-jinx ensue aplenty. Case in point: Midget Mummy and midget wolf man string a rope across a doorway and trip up the brainless chick. Funny stuff.
Then it all ends and Phil Fondacaro's famous line from the film is repeated during the credits: ""What is...this movie?""
Good old Phil hit that one right on the head.
Where is the legend born then? Well, this film was the first ever to meet both of my sweaty cheeks on a hot summer night. Bits on the tape and all. Horifying but hi-larious. This came to be known as ""Creeping"" a film, a practice that has been put into play many a time.
Thank you makers of ""Creeps"", you have given us a legend.",995241600,,1126,4.316037735849057
1247529,1,B00001U0I4,"if you want to see the one of the worst plots ever this is a must. i rented this movie because i like the actor playing the little vamp. well the plot is lame and seems like it was written by a 9-year-old. a demented guy steals all the first editions of the great works of horror, and uses them to bring them back to life, well if backfires and they come out pint-sized. well this gets to be ridiculous because the ""monsters"" cant even reach their preys' knees, you could just kick them and your fine, the actors run as if in danger! complete poopoo. worthless!! stay away unless you want to laugh at the ridiculous chase scenes.",980899200,,629,4.294117647058823
1247530,3,B00001U0I4,"This horror comedy is more dorky than funny.  A mad scientist steals the rarest of rare first editions of classic monster stories, all so he can bring them to life and rule the world.  Well things fall a bit SHORT (ha ha  ha ha ha ha) and the classic creatures come out as midgets.  Forget that  the monsters characterizations are all wrong and that the Wolf Man was  created largely in movies and not in a classic book.  This movie is just  made to laugh at and, as with most of Full Moon's fodder, is quite  entertaining in its own moronic way.",959904000,2,546,4.2745098039215685
1247531,5,B00001U0I4,"This is a fun, yet frightening movie. Classic monsters played by little people. Despite the premise, the actors in the monster roles are not played for laughs, especially Dracula. Entertaining, fun, and thought provoking as well. Not to mention, a little scary. You will enjoy this film.",1242777600,,287,5.127659574468085
1247532,4,B00001U0I4,"This is one of the better full moon movies. The acting is decent and the monsters take their roles seriously. Yes, this is a comedy but it is the situation and not the monsters that make it so. I have to recommend this to everyone.",1229212800,,231,4.155555555555556

1247534,4,B00001U0I4,"I started out with The Ultimate 3D Collection that included 3 IMAX 3D movies.  That set is good, but the price is a little steep for those who might not want to invest that much up front for a system they probably know nothing about.

This set, however, only has one movie, and it's a good title to show off the system's 3D capabilities.  At the price point for this particular package, you can't go wrong!

The 3D this system offers isn't perfect (see my lengthy review of The Ultimate 3D Collection here at Amazon), but it's full, true color and the 3D works GREAT.  I say it's not perfect because there is a slight flickering effect caused by the liquid crystal display glasses that are used to view the 3D movies.  But this BLOWS AWAY the anaglyph process (red/blue glasses) and it is quite popular among 3D hobbyists.

There are also more titles for this system in addition to the Creeps:  Spy Kids 3D (make SURE you get the HQFS version, which stands for High Quality Field Sequential 3D), Transition 3D, Santa vs. the Snowman (make sure it's the HQFS version!), not to mention the IMAX titles offered separately from first box set I mentioned.  See my Amazon.com list for details on all 3D titles I could find for this system here at Amazon.

There are also other titles available on auction sites and private websites from collectors of titles for this system.  With a little research, you should be able to find Jaws 3D, Friday the 13th Part 3 in 3D, House of Wax, dial M for Murder, Creature from the Black Lagoon, It Came From Outer Space, Andy Warhol's Frankenstein, etc.",1171065600,8,1583,4.538732394366197
1247535,1,B00001U0I4,"It worked the first time I used and then not at all.  There was no phone number on the instructions (which were difficult to read and did not even include instructions on all the parts that were in the box), that I called them from the telephone number on their box and before I even described the problem, I was directed to print a form off the internet and to send the whole unit back!

I think that if someone offers a product, the least they should do is to sort out problems quickly and without a fuss!",1159920000,6,507,4.163265306122449
1247536,3,B00001U0I4,"Bashing this movie is simply stupid.  Right off the bat you should know that it's a low budget, schlocky B movie.  Not really what you would call horror, either. This movie did it's job for me.  It entertained me and I bought it for about $3.  The story is good enough to keep you interested.  Of the 8 member cast, 2 did an alright job.  The little blond, altough wasn't a good actress, was OK on the eyes and at times funny.  You really think she thinks she's giving an Oscar worthy performance and that's funny to me.  One other thing; the little dude who played Dracula, was the best actor in the movie.  I thought he did a good job.",1144627200,6,637,4.198347107438017
1247537,1,B00001U0I4,"Director Charles Band has given us some strange but fun movies such as THE REANIMATOR, but in this one, I think he's gone off the deep end.  In the VIDEO ZONE feature, he extols his cast saying how good actors they are?  Charles, please....there's not one solid performance in this whole movie, and your boasting of the originality of having the monsters three feet tall is ridiculous.  How frightening can these clowns be?  Rhonda Griffin and Kristin Norton are the worst actresses I have ever seen, and Bill Moynihan is atrocious.  Only Justin Lauer as the hero comes across with any kind of screen presence.  This one's not even funny enough to be considered camp.
Is it time for the Full Moon to set?  With movies like this one, I'd say so.",1077148800,2,744,4.590909090909091
1247538,1,B00001U0I4,"Worst movie ever. Midget monsters? Give me a break. I'm not sure what audience this movie was trying to capture. It's too stupid to keep adults entertained. It seemed like a horror movie for kids until one of the sawed off runts pulls the top off the dumb blonde and starts dialing Tokyo on her nipples.
I admit that was the best part of the movie...wink,wink, nudge,nudge.
I'd let this one rest in peace if I were you.",1064534400,5,419,4.384615384615385
1247539,5,B00001U0I4,"Dracula. Frankenstein. The Werewolf. The Mummy. They're alive-and they're angry. These scary subjects of innumberable nightmares have been brought to life, but there was a problem in the process...
Though imbued with most of the expected attributes, the creatures' creator made a little error in the equation. The frightening fiends materialized in miniature! Three feet tall and not happy at all, the minuscule monsters embark on a mad mission to complete their creation-at any cost!",1026691200,,484,5.466666666666667
1247540,2,B00001U0I4,"Is this a horror movie?  No.  It just isn't scary.  But it has midget monsters, what more can one ask for?  In spite of the movie's weak plot,  script and 59 budget, there are some brilliant camp moments that make the movie worthwhile.  Yes, there are the midget monsters, but the reason to get this movie is all for Miss Christina, the lascivious head librarian.
The best scenes in the movie are all the ones with Miss Christina.  Think Catherine Deneuve in the horror classic ""The Hunger.""  But think Catherine Deneuve on ecstasy.  Miss Christina's over the top sex scene with a rare edition of ""Jane Eyre"" makes the movie.  Never before has anyone made love to a book like Miss Christina.  We get teased when Miss Christina briefly comes back from the beyond having been turned into a Viking War Goddess.  If only the movie had followed her and left everyone else behind.  Miss Christina is played by Kristin Norton - let's hope we see more movies with her - she is hilarious.  This lousy movie needs a much better sequel - ""Creeps II, The Return of Miss Christina.""",1013990400,,1069,4.557894736842106
7915044,4,B00001U0I4,"A curiousity, indeed! I quote >"" Originally filmed and exhibited in 3-D, this new Blu-ray is culled from the original negative and presented in stunning anamorphic, 2D HD 1080p transfer, all the better to appreciate Adolfo Bartolis rich 35mm cinematography and Gabe Bartalos amazing practical make-up FX.

I bought this, BECAUSE, while it is NOT presented IN 3-D, a 2D-movie can ALWAYS be seen in ""3D"" when you use the 2D=>3D button on your
3D TV & 3D Blu-ray disc player. This----from what I've read----is a better home-theater experience than, otherwise, is available.

7915047,3,B00001U0I4,"It's a pretty typical full moon movie, but it wasn't great like say ""The blood dolls"" or ""the gingerdead man"" , but that's my opinion, if you liked those two then you may not like this one as much.
It has a decent cast, who are over the top and pretty humorous. It's about a rare book library, and the head librarian is hysterical, but under used. Anna, the other librarian is okay, she lets a guy look at a rare book and he replaces it, and that's basically what the movie is about. Anna trying to locate the rare book that was stolen with the help of a ""detective"" who works in a video store. The guy who stole the book is trying to use them to raise the monsters from them, which he partially succeeded at doing. Phil Fondacaro is Dracula, and he is amazing as usual, i love that full moon uses him a lot, because half the time he is the only good actor and his performances are worth watching. The movie isn't very good, it has it's highs but mostly it has lows. This movie is sometimes billed as ""Deformed Monsters"" , which is annoying, because re-titling movies is a peeve of mine. I watched it for free, so i cannot complain too much.",1456704000,,1141,4.2146118721461185

7915051,2,B00001U0I4,"A crazed scientist steals the original manuscripts for the legendary monsters Dracula, The Wolf Man, The Mummy, and Frankenstein so that he can bring them to life using a machine of his own design, but things go horribly wrong when his virgin sacrifice escapes. The creatures are restored, but at only three feet tall! Now, the miniature monsters must track down the girl and bring her back to the lab so that they can be returned to their normal size in order to wreak havoc on the world! Charles Band and Full Moon Entertainment present another tale featuring a group of tiny terrors, this time employing veteran actor Phil Fondacaro in the role of Dracula. Fondacaro takes the character seriously despite the campy nature of the script, and gives one of his best performances to date. Bill Moynihan's stuttering scientist provides more fun with his odd, quirky behavior and foolhardy delusions of control. Additional praise goes to Gabriel Bartalos in charge of the special make-up effects for coming up with a series of excellent design updates for the hideous creeps. Like in so many other Full Moon flicks, the mood is kept light and playful, with story falling second to entertainment. For a cheesy monster romp, these ankle-biters are sure to please!

7915052,2,B00001U0I4,"Ok I know its a full moon movie so don't expect a block buster cast or even story ,but it was shot really good and it did have story to it which made it fun in a way. I thought this movie could of been played on tv like the ifc channel. It could even be a good monster movie for kids to watch. I really thought it was funny how they named a couple full moon movies in the movie. Good way to make fans check out your other movies. No matter what I will always be a fan of full moon/charles band movies and products.",1303430400,,514,3.8130841121495327
7915053,4,B00001U0I4,"Having just sat through this movie for the first time, I would have to say that Phil Fondacaro, who plays Dracula is really the only reason to watch this. He is a solid actor who makes you believe you are looking at Dracula made smaller. I would not say this is a horror movie, because nobody dies. Too bad really, because to watch Phil tear open at least one victims throat would have made it much scarier. It plays out more like a Children's Halloween film, except there is some nudity. There is no foul language that I can remember, so cut out the nude scene and this could be on Nickelodean. I liked it okay,because I love the old Universal monsters...well any monsters for that matter. But if they had played it a little darker,with real threats,and kills,and less hamminess(such as the annoying scientist) this could have been a much more fulfilling watch. I would love to see a sequel made to this, with the monsters really cutting loose. Come on Charles Band, spend another eight hundred dollars, and make us a sequel with blood in it!",1255219200,7,1043,4.553191489361702
