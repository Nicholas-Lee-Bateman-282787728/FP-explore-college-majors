4498523,4,B004XZ99I2,"This is a film from French Canadian Xavier Dolan, he writes, directs and stars as Francis.  He is a young guy who has a friend Marie (Monia Chokri) and they both meet a newbie to the Montreal social scene in the shape of the Adonis like Nicolas (Niels Schneider). Francis is gay and Marie is gagging for it, so they both start acting like lovelorn puppies and show as much maturity as a bootleg whisky.

The effect he has on them is barely suppressed as they all pretend to get on and care for each other whilst in actual fact Marie is in open hostilities with Francis to garner young Nikki's affections. He seems oblivious but also a tad over tactile, which of course only adds fuel to the fire burning in everyone else's loins.

There are a lot of monologues to camera almost in an interview stylie, and the camera pans in and out like an amateur news man. This is obviously done for stylistic reasons, but some may find it acts more like an alienation device and tends to slow down the narrative.

Everyone smokes, which is great, all the acting is well above average and it oozes style. With lots of references and homage's to Katherine Hepburn and angora jumpers for good measure. The musical score is rather good too and the whole film has a sensuality that I normally associate with Italian cinema. As things come to a head (forgive the pun) the bitchiness is ramped up to levels where even high school girls would find challenging.  You may also pick up some tips on the proper sensual way of eating a marshmallow too - if that is your thing.

This is a sensual, languorous tale of infatuation, jealousy and redemption and I really liked it. There are not too many bedroom scenes in case you were wondering, so for that sort of gentleman's diversion, you would be better off looking else where. It is in French with very good sub titles, it is 105 minutes  long and could probably have been shorter but still it is very recommended and I think Mousier Dolan has shown he has a lot to offer.",1317772800,8,1998,4.442622950819672
4498524,3,B004XZ99I2,"First things first, thank you IFC Films for picking up this movie for a US release! We need more foreign and indie releases.

""Heartbeats (Les Amours Imaginaires)"" (101 min.) is a 2010 Canadian movie centering around the friendship of Marie and Francis, who both take a love interest in Nicolas, a free-going kinda fella. Marie and Francis both compete for Nicolas' interest, threatening their own friendship. I don't want to say much more of the storyline, as I don't want to spoil the plot. While there were some nice moments, and the acting was fine, I have to admit that I really didn't get into the movie at all. I couldn't connect with the characters that much, for whatever reason. Maybe others will, and I hope you do.

As a final aside, again I want to applaud IFC Films, and others like it such as the on-going foreign and indie releases by Film Movement for bringing these movies to us. No, I may not like every single movie (such as this one) but the overall track record of these releases is great (in my book anyway), and I am sick and tired of the mainstream Hollywood movies (Iron Man 3? no thanks).",1315267200,2,1115,4.514851485148514
4498538,1,B004XZ99I2,"Although the cinematography is something to salivate for, the overall plot was weak and offensively derivative of other ""threesome"" films made in the past. Can we also talk about the pretentious audience to whom this film is clearly trying to appease? Everything about ""Les Amous Imaginaires"" was superficial--the clothing, the scenery, the dialogue. There's not one significant exchange between the characters, and there isn't much substance in the relationships either. Let's face it, the only good thing that came out of this film is Louis Garrel's cameo at the end.

Pro-tip: save your money for another indie film. But hey, if you're into hipster queer-baiting, be my guest.",1366934400,2,679,5.287037037037037

Xavier Dolan is truly a great young director and I will definitely be watching all his movies from now to forever. The plot of the movie, I think is pretty unique and the cinematography is truly amazing. The music! UGH! It's great. AHH J'aime questo film!",1341014400,,389,4.571428571428571
4498543,5,B004XZ99I2,"Pal and gal are both attracted to a lad who gives advances to both of them - and later refuses either of them because of his true sex nature and a social awareness surely.

If something could be improved, it is an actress chosen, playing a much younger twenty five year old character, an age she passed visually years ago-it seems, she was a mother of one of characters played by the same male actors in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-Killed-My-Mother-J-ai-tu-ma-mre/dp/B006LQY3KU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I Killed My Mother ( J'ai tu ma mre )</a>&nbsp;.

4498544,2,B004XZ99I2,"For a few minutes at a time, it works, and those minutes are a pleasure - but those minutes are gradually buried by the mass of the film which doesn't work and the audience is finally just rooting for the film to end.",1323388800,2,217,4.069767441860465
4498545,2,B004XZ99I2,"Woulda, shoulda, coulda . . . been an o.k. movie. The cast was alright, although true, while nobody exactly sizzled, they did show glimmers of hotness here and there. The camera work was technically passable--except when it tried to get tricky or artsy. The script appeared the biggest obstacle to turning out a decent film. The intention apparently was something about mutability of affection and genders, but other than to observe that people occasionally find these aspects of life befuddling, if not downright painful, there was little enough this film had to say, and certainly nothing we hadn't already seen others address better. Louis Garrell has a micro-cameo at the closing (So who had to do him to convince him to drop by? That's the only interesting question here.) but regrettably, the reminder of Garrell's work served solely to magnify the mediocrity of everything that had come before. Still . . . one wishes the director well and that he perhaps try to think through his next project a tad more thoroughly before he rolls camera. Just a suggestion.",1322179200,2,1065,4.955307262569832

4498547,5,B004XZ99I2,"This film has become one of my favorite films of all time.  Every scene is crafted with so much care - through lighting, music and motion - that an apparently simple story about a love triangle becomes a much more complex narrative about our desire for the unattainable and the loss of the self through love.  Xavier Dolan is not only a prodigious director and writer, but also an incredibly poignant actor who chose his two other protagonists perfectly.",1319846400,8,454,4.734177215189874
8447719,5,B004XZ99I2,"Very artistic and affecting.  Every shot is beautiful, the music is amazing, the characters are perfectly drawn and painfully relatable.  Even the subtitles impressed me, it seemed like a much more natural and authentic translation then a lot of subtitled films end up with.

I highly recommend this film and look forward to exploring the rest of Dolan's work.",1474848000,,360,5.067796610169491
8447720,3,B004XZ99I2,I enjoyed his other moves but thought this one was weak. Really never got anywhere.,1473379200,,83,4.6
8447721,4,B004XZ99I2,"One thing you can always say about French-Canadian auteur filmmaker and actor Xavier Dolan, his work leaves you pondering. Pondering on characters' true motivations and feelings, relationships, actions, etc, etc. And sometimes pondering on why the hell he put in that scene or filmed it that way. It definitely makes an impression.

It's not about plot. That's simple. Dolan and his fag-hag both fall for an Adonis and compete for his affection, which seems to be reciprocated in kind to both. Is he gay? Is he straight? Switchhitter? The contest reaches fever pitch at an outing in the country. Then things collapse. But that's not really where the story lies. It's in these two competitor's faces, their little nuances of dialog, their near self-flagellation of self-loathing in hopes of redemption by 'perfect love'. In fact, camera work is so focused on the actors' faces that full body shots are rare except in party scenes and the like. Interspersed throughout are documentary-style interviews relating the stories of failed relationships. These interviewees are not in the movie proper and are nearly devoid of emotion. Because they're also filmed from shoulders up, the contrast with the main characters' intensity is emphatic. The film's final scene (only seconds long), is as classic as when Charles Foster Kane's sled gets tossed into the furnace in ""Citizen Kane"" (though very different).

Fortunately the music is sung in French which obviates the banality of Sonny and Cher's ""Bang, Bang"". The costumes are excellent, nearly every actor qualifies as eye candy, and the scenes in the country are stunning, making ""Heartbeats"" a visual treat as well. There are no extras (Theatrical Trailer only).

If you like typical American films with their linear plots, cookie-cutter characters and a tidy little bow of an ending, you probably won't appreciate Dolan's style. I've seen four of his films and enjoyed all but ""Laurence Always"". The only reason I knocked off a star for ""Heartbeats"" is because it has a bit too little story for the time it takes to tell. It would benefit from a bit more editing. But definitely well worth the trip.",1441929600,,2147,5.076487252124646
8447722,5,B004XZ99I2,"Love his films a amazing young up and comming  true film maker. What is wrong with America not to know more about  this young mans amazing insite. I am older but can definitely relate to all his amazing films. Espically, I Killed My Mother.",1441411200,,240,4.431818181818182
8447723,1,B004XZ99I2,"Ugh.  What is with this filmmaker?  I gave this a shot, along with I Killed My Mother.  Both were absolutely baseless -- no character motivation, no useful  background  or  character  development.  And  pointless.  Just  mentally defective or vacuous characters.  The final  party scene was repulsive (who hisses at someone at a party because their  infatuation was not  returned?)  It was billed as a  coming of  age  film, only nobody came of  age (I define the term  as involving some  kind of growth).  These were  two self obsessed,  emotionally arrested twits who both repulsed  an apparently nice guy who felt genuine affection for  them  (despite his  boring non character) by behaving like psychos.  Then  they hate him for rejecting them.  I don't  have to like  characters  to find  them interesting, but these two  were without any observational  value.",1437609600,,865,5.043795620437956

8447725,1,B004XZ99I2,"But I couldn't even like it. I really adored Xavier Dolan's style, and enjoyed his first film, I Killed My Mother, but this one did nothing for me. Sure, it's stylistic and gorgeous looking---as you'd expect from him---and all the lead characters are gorgeous, but the plot was so weak and thin. I couldn't connect with any of the characters. I didn't understand what was it beyond the blonde haired guy's good looks that made the other two characters fall head over heels. I didn't even buy those two character's friendship. The chemistry in this menage just wasn't there. The movie overall just felt so unnecessarily pretentious, taking itself way too seriously. I'd recommend skipping this one. Just too boring and uninspired.",1420416000,,729,4.983606557377049
8447726,5,B004XZ99I2,"First, I rented ""I Killed My Mother"".  I ran to buy it and looked up Dolan's biography.  I as astonished to find out that he was not only gay, but only 19 when he made it, a first effort that was recognized with a prize at the Cannes Film Festival.  I decided to buy everything else he had done.  This young man shows outstanding talent both as an actor and a director.  This, his second film, is much lighter in mood than his first or third. He knows how to dance around his actors, allowing them the full expression of their talents. His are movies about the gay experience that do not hinge on violence or tragedy, both of which I consider part of the heterosexual take on gays.  Yo will be duly satisfied.",1412640000,,709,4.253731343283582

8447728,3,B004XZ99I2,"A 2010 Canadian drama Heartbeats (Les Amours Imaginaires) is so stylish (accompanied with nice soundtrack music) that you may almost forget that what the films star/writer/director Xavier Dolan, obviously talented, is trying to do could have been much better with his self-indulgent style.

This is a classic story of a love triangle with a bit of difference; two best friends Francis and Marie meet a handsome Nicolas and they both fall in love with him. The three persons initially sweet relationship takes a turn for the worse when the rivalry between Francis and Marie escalates without knowing.

Acting is excellent. Some scenes are so real that you may remember your own romance. However, slow motion, beautifully shot as it is, is overused. Interview section (a la When Harry Met Sally) is too long. Perhaps I didn't like the film very much because of the final five minutes that look superfluous.

Heartbeats (Les Amours Imaginaires) is an art-house film at its best and, to some viewers perhaps, worst.",1396224000,2,1011,5.041916167664671
