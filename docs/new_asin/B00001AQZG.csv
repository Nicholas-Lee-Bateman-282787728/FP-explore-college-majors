7914331,2,B00001AQZG,"Even though the story is still fascinating, the 1931 verison of the Opera is NOT brought well to the screen. Compared with other movies from the time, some of the characters seem very flat, especially Mr. Peachum's wife. Even Mack the Knife is not the character, Brecht intended. He and the great composer K.Weill were right to leave the production before it was completed.
Nevertheless a must for film historians.",999648000,13,414,4.928571428571429
7914332,3,B00001AQZG,"If you already know the story line of Brecht's ""Threepenny Opera"" this 1931 B&W film version will catch you off-guard.  German director Pabst has rearranged the scenes and added new material to the story of Mac and Polly.  Many of Kurt Weill's songs are not included in the movie.
This is a vintage and historically valuable film, but not completely satisfying in its production.  Both Brecht and Weill quit the production in mid-stream, and even sued Pabst for the liberties he took with their creation.",993686400,15,504,4.905882352941177
