7476659,5,B016NVSE3E,"I love this show. The DVD version is pretty no-frills, but the integrity of picture quality is good and none of episodes are cut off or compromised in any way. Exactly as I remembered it!",1454371200,,187,4.371428571428571

7476663,5,B016NVSE3E,ONE OF THE BEST TV SERIES ON TELEVISION I LOVE IT!! CANT WAIT UNTIL I HAVE ALL SIX SEASONS,1453161600,,90,3.789473684210526
7476664,5,B016NVSE3E,"The third season of Sisters is by far and away the series best season.  Georgie carries Frankie's baby via surrogacy and gives birth while trapped in car after an accident.  Following the birth, Georgie has maternal feelings for the baby and feels unable to give the baby to Frankie. Teddy finds success as a fashion designer; Alex feuds with Teddy and Alex's daughter Reed gets married to Kirby (Paul Rudd).  Frankie and Mitch deal with custody problems when they divorce and Alex battles cancer.

At the time considered groundbreaking for focusing on the lives of four women; Sisters dealt with human issues with warmth, heart and sensitivity.  Season 3 is by far the series best season and features perhaps the most memorable moments from the series history.  The performances are all solid and the writing is above par.",1450915200,9,823,4.927536231884058

7476671,4,B016NVSE3E,"This DVD set of Season 3 of the series surpasses the Season 1/Season 2 set in the quality of the video as well as the scripts.  Granted, the video quality may not be the normally expected re-mastering of a series, but what is presented here is how the series looked when it was first broadcast, which makes it a fine standard definition presentation.  It appears the original masters for the NBC broadcasts have been used, as the episodes include the commercial break bumpers as well as the trailers for the next episode (except for a couple that are missing when the network did the Christmas and spring breaks).  Overall, it's like experiencing the adventures of the Reed sisters as we did in 1992-93.  Definitely recommended.",1468540800,,728,4.8
7476672,5,B016NVSE3E,"Season three continues the great entertainment the much waited release of the Sisters show has to offer.  If you are reading my review, you probably already know how great this show is.  We've waited 20 years for this show to get released.  Don't wait any longer to see this show again.  It is as good as you remember it.",1465084800,,321,4.389830508474576

7476674,5,B016NVSE3E,"I've been waiting a long time for this series to come out on DVD. I would periodically check Amazon to see if someone had picked it up for DVD release. When I saw that Shout Factory had released it, I was excited and ordered these right away. I remember watching this show with my mother when it first started. Every Saturday Night we would watch the lineup starting with Golden Girls until that ended and continued with NBC's three hour block of programming. It was our Saturday Night routine and I was truly sad when this show ended. As I watched the DVD's, it's amazing how all of it came flooding back - some of the dialogue that I remembered, the storylines, etc. The quality is not as terrible as some of the previous reviews have made it out to be. Yes, it's grainy, but this show aired 1991-1996. We are lucky to even have the series released on DVD. I purchased Seasons 1-4 and have pre-ordered Season 5. Hopefully, I won't have to wait long for the final Season to be released.",1463616000,4,987,4.398907103825136
7476675,5,B016NVSE3E,This was such a great show and I now have four seasons of it.  Season 5 comes out in July and I have preordered it but am now wondering when the last season is coming out.  That will be Season 6.,1462060800,,195,3.731707317073171

7476681,5,B016NVSE3E,"The seasons where this series really starts to hit its stride, I felt. It's great to see where Ashley Judd and Paul Rudd got one of their early breaks too (and Ashley Judd was so beautful in this-so was Sela Ward and it's great to see that she hasn't aged from then to now). Wonderful performances all around. I enjoyed this season a lot more than I did, 1 and 2. Can't wait for s4 to become available!",1457913600,,402,4.166666666666667

8736888,5,B016NVSE3E,"This series has so much going on all the time, on every disc in every season. Much like real life actually is for most of us. They expressed the qualities and temperments of each person, showing such differences in thought and ideas, even though having the same parents. Oft times they were very much alike. This would have been my dream life, to have had sisters like these actors played.",1507420800,,389,4.571428571428571
