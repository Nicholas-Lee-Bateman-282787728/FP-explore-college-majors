7851510,5,6303622615,"I bought ALL the lost episodes, and all the 39 classics, and in my humble opinion, the lost episodes are even funnier than the original 39.  More spontaneous, raw, boisterous.  Really a whole bunch of gems in here and only a few stinkers.  I did not grow up watching the originals, discovered the 39 and the Lost episodes about the same time, maybe that has something to do with it, I have not been indoctrinated into the 39 as being automatically the best.  But anyway the two are both sides of one gold coin so get them ALL!",1127347200,13,526,4.336734693877551
7851511,5,6303622615,"How can ANYONE in their right mind not like ""The Honeymooners?""

Jackie Gleason & the rest of the cast were comic geniuses.

The person who wrote the review ""Tiresome Junk"" needs a good

BANG, ZOOM to the kisser!!",1095033600,12,213,4.552631578947368
7851512,5,6303622615,"The Honeymooners, despite the incredible humor, is gritty and occasionally a bit difficult to watch:  sometimes the arguments between Ralph and Alice are very intense and disturbingly realistic.  I recall hearing of The Great One's response when someone involved in the production suggested that Alice should cry during an argument:  He adamantly refused.  Gleason realized that they were already so close to the edge that if Alice ever shed tears as a result of Ralph's browbeating he'd be seen as an abusive husband to be feared rather than a foolish blowhard to be ridiculed (with lines like ""Awwww, SHADDUP!""): the comic opportunity would be lost.
Luckily, TV Land has recently reintroduced the country to the joys of the Honeymooners.  I can't put my finger on just why I enjoy the program so immensely:  ""I Love Lucy"" and many other 50's TV comedies bore me.  Whatever the reasons, I'd place the Honeymooners in the same category as early ""All in the Family"" episodes  and ""Sanford and Son"":  some of the greatest American TV comedy ever made.
As for the correction:  the last review mentions that, because of supposed 'racist' overtones, the rights to the ""Little Rascals"" were purchased to prevent their release on video tape.  That's an urban legend:  a search of the term:  little+rascals+video+rights on any web search engine should take the curious to a number of sites that refute this story, although it's been around for a long time.",979948800,10,1448,4.983333333333333
7851513,5,6303622615,"I now have both collections -- the classic 39 and the ""lost episodes"", and thank God for whoever it was who decided to put the whole shebang on tape.  The ""bang, zoom"", ""Baby, you're the  greatest"", ""Hey, Ralphie booooy"", and ""You're a sweet  kid"" won't ever get old.  The only slight fly in the ointment as far  as I'm concerned is Joyce Randolph's overacting, but that's a minor fly  indeed -- the two collections are more than well worth the $ they  cost, because there has never been another ""Honeymooners"", and  there will never be another either.  It's a classic no matter how you cut  it!",939513600,69,595,4.528301886792453
