1859041,5,B00008QSAQ,I knew nothing about country western couples dancing and this is a great one to start with. Mostly shows how the man is suppose to lead and women can easily follow.,1113609600,5,164,4.32258064516129
1859042,4,B00008QSAQ,"I can't say enough about this instructional program. I watched it only a couple of times and I'm already doing these steps. It's beautifully shot and the dances are well executed. Maybe not everyone will pick it up as fast, but there should be no problems with some practice. And I'm not the best dancer in the world and I learned. You can too.",1100131200,7,344,4.390625
1859090,3,B00008QSAQ,"This DVD doesn't show the kind of dancing that I want to learn, it says for beginners but not what I wanted.",1403395200,,108,3.9545454545454546
1859091,2,B00008QSAQ,Was expection a lot more instruction. I put it in the library but I will never use it again. Needs to be for beginners.,1395705600,,119,4.0
1859092,4,B00008QSAQ,"I like this bra. However, would like the straps not as wide. Also a small bit more of lining or padding in the cups. For concealment and modesty.",1395187200,,145,4.214285714285714
1859093,3,B00008QSAQ,This video was just ok. The instruction was difficult to follow. My wife and I watched it several times and could not get it together. However in the products defense we're not that good at learning new tricks.,1356739200,,210,4.552631578947368
1859094,2,B00008QSAQ,Although the cover has a country title the lessons are more of a ballroom style.  Very dissapointed that the Cha Cha was not a cowboy cha cha.,1345161600,,142,4.2592592592592595
1859095,1,B00008QSAQ,This is NOT for beginners.  The narrator in the video does not break down the steps or explain the theory of things.  It's hard to follow and really understand what's happening.  You cannot learn from this video.  It's even frustrating to watch because it is so fast paced.  It's useless as a training video.,1227225600,,308,4.62962962962963
1859096,2,B00008QSAQ,"This video is not for beginners. I am an experienced dancer. I picked a copy of this DVD up at the library hoping to be able to teach my boyfriend how to dance country and western dance. I know that this really won't help him.

It will only give me a quick refresher so that I can teach him. It's great for a refresher for someone who already has a good idea of how to do the dance and teach to someone else, but otherwise, do not get this if you are a beginner yourself. Spend some money and get a teacher (about the same cost of a regular dance DVD, but better instruction - one on one attention to detail), or surely there are better videos out there.",1181520000,2,654,4.069767441860465
1859097,1,B00008QSAQ,This DVD was awful.  Its impossible to follow.  The instructors don't break down any of the steps.  I have a little bit of dance background and I couldn't pick up any of the dances.  I would recommend one of Shawn Trautman's DVD's instead.  You will find it much less frustrating.,1148947200,16,280,4.52
1859098,1,B00008QSAQ,"I thought this video was awful. The instruction begins with no introduction, then quickly gives you the first steps. There are no repeat instructions. You have to be able to go from the first time you are ""quickly"" shown to the next step. There is no initial ""slow down"" of the steps. They are done quickly, and you are expected to remember them in the 2-3 seconds that you learn the next step with no real instruction. You could learn as much watching someone actually dance, and probably more. My husband and I were looking forward to this video, and it was a really big disappointment. DEFINATELY NOT FOR BEGINNERS, AS THE TITLE SUGGEST!!",1142640000,9,641,4.631578947368421
1859099,1,B00008QSAQ,"Okay, I normally don't believe in giving bad feedback on an item, but this is one that just isn't worth it. Unless you live in a dance studio, there's no way you can learn this. Also, this is nothing like the dances done at the country clubs.",1136419200,15,242,4.170212765957447
