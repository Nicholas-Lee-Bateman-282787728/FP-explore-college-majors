2772323,4,B000NO1XJA,It was an excellent movie and one I had not seen before.  The DVD was clear and easy to handle and see.,1226275200,11,103,3.6818181818181817
2772324,5,B000NO1XJA,"Set at the height of the Cold War, this Sam Fuller thriller has Richard Widmark as a former navy sub commander recruited by a private group to stop Red China from getting the bomb.  Action packed with a cast that includes Cameron Mitchell, a lot of fun.  Sure it's dated. Love it anyway.",1216080000,11,287,4.39622641509434
2772325,4,B000NO1XJA,It is always a pleasure to review the classic black and white movies with the legends of the big screen. this one is no exception.,1208476800,2,130,4.24
2772326,4,B000NO1XJA,"This is a Cold War era about what would happen if the Koreans (this is set during the Korean War, which ended during the year of its release) got a hold of an A-bomb and dropped it in a way to frame the United States.  Richard Widmark plays Capt. Adam Jones who is hired for a mysterious mission to trail a freighter in an old Japanese submarine.  He hires some of his old Navy crew and takes the famed atomic scientist Prof. Montel (Victor Francen) and his assistant Prof. Denice Gerard (Bella Darvi) on board as the directors of their mission.

They run afoul of Korean defenses including a very good sub battle, an island raid, and the final conflict I will leave to you to experience.  Widmark carries most of the dramatic load, the crew provides a bit of pathos and some enjoyable comic relief.  Victor Francen is believable as the bearded scientist and Bella Darvi looks pretty enough on screen (but not a real actress).

The special effects were very good for their time, but the Cinemascope cannot be appreciated on your TV no matter how high the quality or its dimensions.  However, it is an enjoyable tale and can be enjoyed by the family.

2772327,4,B000NO1XJA,"**** 1954. Written and directed by Samuel Fuller. One nomination for the Academy awards (Best Special Effects). Capt. Adam Jones, accompanied by two scientists, must find an island in the North Pacific ocean where Chinese are believed to build an atomic bomb. I love the extravaganza of the cinema of Samuel Fuller, Who else could have imagined a love scene between Richard Widmark and Bella Darvi in a submarine resting on the bottom of the ocean ? In a red light in order to conserve electricity and unable to speak because of the lack of oxygen ? This is cinema at its best. Highly recommended.",1208131200,36,597,4.695238095238095

2772330,4,B000NO1XJA,"Despite the expected cold war anti-commie propaganda, this is one fine submarine movie.  After the end of WWII an American ex-navy submarine commander takes on the task of transporting scientists by submarine up near arctic waters to spy on what the Chinese communists are up to (no good).  Of course, the sub is an old surplus Japanese I-Boat (a ""sewer pipe"" according to the captain) and the crew is a bunch of old hands and misfits.  There is a fair amount of action, as the commies don't like the sub's presence, and the movie has an interesting ending.

Rather, it's a combo war-oriented love story, with no surprises, but it's still entertainment. Besides, Richard Widmark plays the leading role, and since when does he ever deliver a bad performance?

I wish Richard Widmark, one of my favorite actors, hadn't lowered himself to do this movie. If viewers want to see the acting he is capable of, I can highly recommend ""The Bedford Incident,"" with a young Sidney Poitier"" as a talented co-star in this very well done movie. I think it will be especially scary to those of us who were old enough to be aware of the dangers of the Cuban Missile Crisis, but any adult and some teenagers should like this movie..

2772373,4,B000NO1XJA,Richard Widmark one of hollywood's most under appreciated stars. To be a major star you have to make at least 1 submarine movie. Widmark made 2. The other is the Bedford Incident with Sidney Poitier. Like Kirk Douglas Widmark brought a James Cagney like intensity to every role. While not as great a  sub epic as Run Silent Run Deep this movie was pretty darn good & in color. Widmark is an ex Naval submarine skipper because he is a loose cannon. He is hired by some scientists to recruit a crew to try to intercept a nuclear bomb before it is delivered. To do this he must command an obsolete WWII Japanese submarine. Like the legendary 707 japanese sub movies. Now there's a submarine movie you have never seen. The submarine 707 under Captain Hayami. It's animated But it will hook you..,1421193600,,791,4.531468531468532

2772416,5,B000NO1XJA,"This is a very well done and enjoyable movie. The thing is, you have to understand the 50's and the Cold war to understand the movie. Many of us who grew up in the 50's lived through the Cold War and the threat of nuclear disaster. This movie reflects the fears of that era. The Korean War was fresh in many people's minds, the treatment of the POW's by the North Koreans opened many people's eyes to just how insidious and ruthless the Communists were. Samuel Fuller fought with the Big Red One in WWII and he saw the ruthlessness of another ideology when they liberated a concentration camp. Put this all together and you have the basis for this movie. Love it or hate it but this movie reflects the Cold War mentality, as does Night People.",1388534400,,743,4.391304347826087

2772420,3,B000NO1XJA,"The concept of a secret Chinese Communist base in the Arctic planning a false flag nuclear attack on North Korea that would be attributed to the U.S. and ignite a world war was probably believable during the Cold War years of the mid-fifties.  If you can suspend disbelief and place yourself  back in that era, it is an interesting plot.  The characters however tend toward being caricatures. I knew a lot of guys who were in the service during WW II and their attitudes and prejudices were more or less accurately written into Widmark's character.  Even so, his performance was over the top.  Similarly for the other crewmen.  The brainey female scientist was probably a novelty for the era.  Predictably she and Widmark's character fall in love.  (She probably married him and gave up science to take care of cooking, cleaning and having children.)  There were exciting moments like the battle with the Chinese sub, infiltration of the islands, and, finally, the shooting down of the false flag bomber - and the resulting nuclear detonation.  The novelty of the concept and the fairly well done (for the period) action scenes will probably keep you awake and watching to the end.  If you like old movies revolving around submarines, nuclear weapons, and secret mission to the arctic, you will find it moderately entertaining.",1379980800,,1327,4.9324324324324325
