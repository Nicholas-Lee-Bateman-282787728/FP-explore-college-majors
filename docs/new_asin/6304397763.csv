7870086,5,6304397763,"The underrated Canadian Louis Quilico and the world famous Renata Tebaldi give us a program of operatic music culminating in the
tense finale to Act II of Puccini's 'Tosca'.  The performances of both stars are a delight in their various arias and they come together in a TV Performance of the scene from opera.  The latter will be the focus of attention to anyone purchasing this video and, although we can make comparisons to other performers, the stars here are in fine voice and do a 'bang up' job.  All in all a fine video.",1389398400,,527,4.526315789473684
