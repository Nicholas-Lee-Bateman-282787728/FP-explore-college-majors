8124286,5,B000FKP0OQ,"I read Stewart O'Nan's book ""The Circus Fire: A True Story of an American Tragedy"".  After reading the book, I purchased this dvd thinking it would offer more information on the fire.  I didn't learn any more than what I had read in his book. It was a good dvd just the same but I would recommend reading the book.  This is a good dvd for the classroom.",1370736000,,353,4.161764705882353
8124287,4,B000FKP0OQ,"I have used this video in class for about 4 years - video got lost so this is my replacement.  I like it, it gives some historical perspective (textiles, unions, fire safety)",1351555200,,174,4.4375
8124288,5,B000FKP0OQ,"I got interested in this topic because my mother remembered when it happened. She was living in Hartford, and her boss and his little girl were lucky enough to escape and survive the fire. When Stewart O'Nan wrote his book ""Circus Fire"", I bought it for her (from Amazon, of course! <--shameless plug). This documentary includes lots of footage and personal recollections that can only be surmised from any written account. It also interviews O'Nan, and really brings his book to life.

It was standard practice at the time of this incident to waterproof canvas circus tents with paraffin and gasoline, and it really makes you wonder how on earth anyone could have possibly thought it was a safe practice. I don't think they could have come up with a more flammable concoction if they tried. It only took one small spark to send the whole thing up in flames. The DVD shows the resulting panic in detail, and the repercussions to both the circus industry and the Hartford community in the tragedy's aftermath are thoughtfully discussed.

Anyone interested in history should check this out. It leaves you reflecting about what people 50 years from now will think about some of the actions we believe are safe today that will end up being just as deadly.",1232582400,4,1251,4.787037037037037
