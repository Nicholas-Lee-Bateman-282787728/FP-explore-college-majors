7861162,3,6304088094,"Davy's British heritage is spoofed in two episodes, one from each of the show's seasons.
The Peter-directed second-seasoner Monkees Mind Their Manor is the lesser of the two, displaying a mailed-in quality to the performances that betrays the boys' exhaustion with the series.  The only real saving grace is the closing video, ""Star Collector,"" a rip-roaring Moog-driven Goffin-King take-off on the then-growing phenomenon of groupiedom.  The video itself is a strikingly effective mixture of darkness and red lighting, and this particular version wisely cuts the song's bloatedly drawn-out ending before it degenerates into psycho jello.
The tape opener, Success Story, works far better.  Davy receives a telegram from his grandfather (Ben Wright) on a coming visit, but Davy is reluctant to see him, because he claimed to have made it in America but hasn't, and will be taken back to England should his grandfather find the truth.  Micky, Mike, and Peter of course don't want to part with Davy, and do what they can to keep him stateside.  Davy's grandfather doesn't want Davy ""frittering his life away,"" but the loyalty of the other boys displays something he can agree with.
At the end, Micky notes they should have played for him, so they launch into Mike's country-rock classic ""Sweet Young Thing.""  Once the song is wrapped up Bob Rafelson cues one of the show's best post-episode minute-short interview tags where Davy talks about his real father and grandfather, eliciting a terrific closing by Micky.",1028246400,,1510,5.168032786885246
7861163,5,6304088094,"First in ""Success Story"" Davy Jones's Grandfather comes to  visit, and Mike, Micky , and Peter help make him look like a star. But as  soon as Grandfather finds out the truth, he wants to take Davy Back to  England, But his bandmates prevent that from happening. In ""Monkees  Mind Their Manor"" You will find two actors who later did voices for or  starred in Disney Films. Davy wants to keep the  Manor, but not for five  years. (Laurie Main plays the guy who invites Davy to England, His voice is  found in some Pooh Offerings.) So the Monkees hold a Fair, and my favorite  part in there was Davy singing a nice, but short version of  ""Greensleeves"". Bernard Fox(He played the Rescue Aid Society  Chairmouse in the Rescuers movies) doesn't sing as good as Davy does,  anyway. By the way, those episodes had funny lines as well!",968803200,8,828,4.52027027027027
7861164,5,6304088094,"This is a great video.  I taped one of the episodes when it came on the Screen Gems Network, but the video quality was poor.  The episode I saw was soooo touching, that I went on a quest to find it online so I could  purchase it.  When I found it on here, I was overjoyed.  This is the  ultimate purchase for any Monkees fan who absolutely loves Micky Dolenz  & Davy Jones...  They r soooo adorable in these episodes.  Monkees  4-Ever!",964742400,2,435,4.195121951219512
