If you already own the other 2 or 3 DVDs' on Steve, then you've seen this one, just save your money. I did enjoy all the extras, there were more than I thought there'd be, some of which you'll only see on this DVD or if you were there.",1096070400,3,389,3.875

1986623,4,B0001CCXDO,"The fifth personality profile on Stone Cold Steve Austin in ""The Stone Cold Truth"", based off his book with the same name, takes place under a completely different setting than his previous volumes in that this set is the first one to come out after Austin retired from the ring along with this being more of a personal look at the man behind ""Stone Cold Steve Austin"" in the real life Steve Williams as you hear from not only various peers like Vince & Mick Foley & Eric Bischoff but also his family & his children.  Keep in mind that this was also originally broadcasted as a one hour TV special so the documentary will come off short on time based off that fact but this is the first time you hear Austin talk in detail & candidly about various subjects.

The documentary begins at WrestleMania XIX with Austin knowing it was his last match due to his health issues at the time before going to the details of how he ended up in the hospital the night before the show.  We then go into how Austin's life started with his mother & brothers describing him growing up, the family free, and what sports he was into.  His story of watching wrestling at an early age, seeing it live in college, and breaking into the business is discussed before Austin talks about the rise & fall of his Hollywood Blondes tag team with Brian Pillman.  His career in ECW & how Mick Foley felt that was the beginning of his ""Stone Cold metamorphosis"" was discussed before coming into WWE & where exactly the name & inspiration for the character of ""Stone Cold"" came from.  After briefly having fun at the expense of his singing talents, we hear Austin talk about his relationship with his two daughters & hear from them.  The biggest highlight of this documentary comes next as we hear Austin talk out of character about Owen Hart for the first time as Austin goes into details about the piledriver at SummerSlam & his feelings towards Owen afterwords before talking about how his death effected him.  After briefly talking about his shaved head look, we conclude the documentary on Survivor Series 2003 with Austin giving his thoughts on helping the younger generation & his ""farewell speech"" from that night.

While most of the other Steve Austin tapes chronicle his WWE career between time periods, this was the most personal one that was ever done on Austin as you heard more about the man in Steve Williams than the character of Steve Austin which is already a treat when you get to know these guys more personally & if your interested in getting to know that side of a performer than this is something I would recommend for a viewing.",1302480000,,2618,4.553191489361702
1986624,4,B0001CCXDO,"I recently purchased all four Stone Cold dvds. Because Stone Cold So covers 96-97 and Hell Yeah: Stone Cold's Saga Continues covers 98-99, Because Stone Cold is worth getting but i'd skip  Hell Yeah: Stone Cold's Saga Continues. Then What covers the his whole career up until 2001, it goes by fast but there is some good extra features on the dvd. Plus the origin of why he starting saying what is pretty funny and took me by surprise. This dvd came out when Austin's career was basically over and it would have been good if the documentary was longer. It's a basic hour that goes over his career quickly with no real new information to be found. The extras are a real treat especially all the ECW promos but thats one problem I got with WWE. Some dvds let wrestlers swear but other dvds censor the cuss words. WWE is the only company that censors dvds and its a shame. I know they appeal to families but there should be a choice of censored and uncensored tracks. Other then the weak documentary, the extras are the only real thing that save it.",1265414400,,1046,4.419689119170984
1986625,5,B0001CCXDO,"This dvd focuses more on austin's friends and family. However, this is good for die hard austin fan like myself to see steve austin the person ( steve williams) and to find out how austin's family feels about his whole career in the squared circle. There is good footage included of his early days in wcw and ecw. Im sure there will be some included on the upcoming austin dvd set as well. Anyway, i would recommend you purchase this dvd only if you are interested in knowing more about austin the person and not just the wrestler. I gave this dvd 5 stars because of the way it relates austin's real life with his wrestling career. The next austin dvd which comes out in november will provide a better comprehensive look at austin's career. The content will probably be a combination of previous austin dvds. This dvd is put together well, shows you a great amount of austin's family, and has some of his early matches and promos. So i give this dvd 5 stars and that is the ""stone cold truth"".",1175558400,2,993,4.4316939890710385
1986626,1,B0001CCXDO,"Im a huge Stone Cold fan and I have got to say that I am horribly dissapointed. This disc does not contain any of the good Stone Cold matches...specificlly the matches during the Austin/Mcmahon/Corporate Ministry era.

Luckally, I rented this from Blockbuster. The main story is good but the rest I have seen in other DVDs. I was hoping for alot of matches. It would take atleast 4-6 DVD discs full of matches to really go deep into Austin's history. But 1 disc is pathetic. I put shame on the WWE as they have no idea what fans want.

This DVD was not even worth the rent. I am a horribly horribly dissapointed Stone Cold fan and wonder how the WWE could put out trash such as this.

I hope the WWE releases a 3-6 DVD set on Stone Cold otherwise I hope the WWE goes out of business as they are a horrible wrestling company now a days ever since they lost competion (WCW and ECW) and have no motivation to become better.",1158796800,3,920,4.275862068965517

1986628,3,B0001CCXDO,"I'v watched a lot of WWE DVDs recently, I have to admit the production quality of TSCT was extremely well done. The Extras did have some good ""off camera"" shinanigans of SCSA, especially the ""Beer Bash"" with Goldberg in Montreal. It almost surpassed Austin showering Angle and the McMahon boys with the Beer Truck hose. But I do believe that the story jumped back and forth too much between starting out, and Austin's present status. It was extremely short for a dvd. Especially on arguably the best draw in wrestling history. And I think it was too soon for WWE to release a DVD on Austin when he carrer in the WWE, including actual wrestling, isn't complete yet. The coverage of his run in ECW was really short, as was WCW. More on Pillman would've have been good as well. Overall the dvd was good, but it seemed rushed. More matches would have worked, and more time spent on his carrer. Same goes if WWE released a Rock DVD. It's too soon. Now if they decide to release a SCSA DVD down the road, it will seem cheap, and repeatative. I gave it 3 stars cause I couldn't give it 2 and a half",1129507200,3,1091,4.352941176470588

  stone colds best matches and moments are NOT here.there is some pretty funny stuff he did in ecw.mostly,they talk about everything BEFORE 1997.that was when he won his first of 3 royal rumbles and won his first world title.
  ok heres whats not on the dvd.
  vs shawn michaels where he won his first world title
  vs the big show and ric flair where he beat them both
  any of the great matches on the vince mcmahon video
  any of his 3 royal rumble wins.
  in 1999 when he almost won the royal rumble from number one
  the time he ran into the royal rumble and everybody stopped so they could get a piece of him
  when he beat booker t all over a grocery store
  the home invasion where brian pillman was the first ever wrestler to pull a gun on someone
  when he picked up triple h in a crane and dropped him
  the uncut beer bath
  uncut clip of him and the zamboni
  uncut clip of him pouring cement in vinces car
  when he beat up all of the mcmahons and stunnered them all in one night
  when he was at the bar drinking beer to get a beer gut so he'd be harder to toss out at the royal rumble with a lower center of gravity
  his king of the ring win
  there IS  a bunch of old and rotten videos from like 1992 where he was one of the hollywood blondes.that wasn't a stone cold truth.it was a girly looking austin without any real edge.
  this guy was my favorite wrestler at one time but this dvd does him no justice",1306281600,,1661,3.963302752293578
