8620549,5,B00G4CHNOO,"This video makes valuable information available to health care professionals and others who want to understand how to support those who have had near-death experiences. Although most people have heard of near-death experiences, there is so much that isn't widely known about their effects on patients and how traumatic it is to return from heaven. It only adds to the trauma when the patient is told they were hallucinating. Near-death and other out-of-body experiences change a patient forever and require years to integrate. Hospice and trauma center workers, especially, should all be educated about the impact of these experiences and the protocols for handling those who have had them. Near-death experiences are becoming more prevalent and are widely accepted by lay people. Doctors and other care givers are advised to avail themselves of the latest information available through this highly professional video. Have your workplace order it and share it with colleagues.",1391990400,,977,5.434210526315789
8620550,5,B00G4CHNOO,"This video about NDE provided excellent insight into what patients experience and the impact NDEs have on them. It was extremely informative, outlining the characteristics and defining different types of NDEs. As a health professional, I now feel very comfortable knowing how to discuss these experiences with patients, validate them and help them interpret what happened. Before watching this video, I was not certain of what to say to patients or family members, or how to encourage patients to express what they encountered. I would encourage every active health professional to purchase this video to become proficient in addressing these life-altering experiences. This video is very professionally produced and should be required content for medical students and students of other health professions. It should also be encouraged as a continuing education course for all professionals involved in patient care.
