3513233,5,B001CIOCNU,"I saw this movie at the Chicago Film Festival in 2007, the day before I ran my first marathon in the blistering hot 2007 Chicago Marathon. This was a great movie and one that I will own and return to again and again for inspiration.",1223856000,3,232,4.177777777777778
3513234,5,B001CIOCNU,"My husband (who ran the 05 Chicago marathon) and I (a wanna-be runner) saw this at the 06 Chicago marathon/Chicago Film Festival.  The audience was largely full of those running the marathon the next day.  The atmosphere was electric as the movie began and throughout it did not disappoint.  The story follows 2 elite runners, someone trying to qualify for Boston, 2 women running their first marathon and a master's runner trying to complete his fourth.  Each person has such a compelling story from Deena Kastor who is attempting to win at Chicago to Leah, a woman who is trying to pick up the pieces from a divorce and gain back some physical fitness in the process.

The sweeping shots of stunning Chicago and chill inducing music make this an especially entertaining and inspiring movie.  Whether you're a long time marathoner or a couch potato, you will find yourself identifying with at least one of the featured runners.  You may even find that you're lacing up those running shoes and heading out yourself after watching!!",1223683200,18,1031,4.857142857142857
3513235,5,B001CIOCNU,"I am an ""everyday"" runner who ran the Chicago 05 marathon...I cried when I saw this in the theatre (both times)! It brought back so many memoris for me - I ran with two friends and it was so special for me....I kept looking for us, and for my husband and our son who were cheering us from the sidelines..so much effort goes into training for a marathon and it was amazing to see the different levels of athletic ability portrayed in the movie.  I saw Deena Kastor before she went to sign course maps and posters at the marathon expo-not realizing who she is - now she is my running hero!  This really is a must see movie for anyone training for a marathon!

3513236,5,B001CIOCNU,"I saw this movie at the theatre. It was remarkably inspiring. I wanted to go out that night and run a marathon. The director does a beautiful job of weaving the stories of several runners who are training for the Chicago Marathon. He takes both elite runners and everyday middle of the pack runners. Many, many inspiring stories! I plan to own it and show it to my cross country kids. THIS IS A MUST SEE FOR ALL RUNNERS!!!",1222732800,16,422,4.3544303797468356

3513251,4,B001CIOCNU,"For what it is the film is very inspiring.  Boy the Chicago Marathon looked flat as a pancake after watching them drive the course.  Of course being off the great lakes the wind probably makes it much more challenging.  The movie does get the blood flowing and you end up rooting for several of the characters during the race.

One thing I noticed the novice runners made a big deal out of the 20 mile run making it much harder in their minds than it needed to be.  I don't know what running program they were on but if they had only done 1 20 miler 3 weeks before the marathon then they would be in big trouble for the actual full marathon event. I felt badly for the Ryan Bradley character but doing that treadmill highest speed setting was a very stupid thing to do. It would have been easier on the body just to try and duplicate that on a track from what he can run compared to the world elite.  Not surprising that he got injured although I don't wish injuries on anybody but it does come with the sport.

The highlight of the movie is really Lori O Conner.  You can see her gain confidence as her training progresses.  She was training correctly  and was ready for the race.  By the day of the event you know she is going to do well.

The opposite is the Leah Callie lady, when she pulled out of the half marathon less than half way through you knew that if she made it to marathon day the race would be much harder for her and it was.

Watching the veterans was pretty interesting I would have liked the DVD to spend a little more time on them.  Deena Kastor was amazingly fast and could probably outrun the majority of men.  The Kenyan guy Daniel Njenga tried so hard in the event only to keep coming up just short of the prize.  It made me wonder if Deena and the Daniel would have tried to win smaller marathon's first to gain their confidence on the bigger stages.  For instance if they won San Diego, San Francisco, Portland or Seattle would that give them the confidence to win the bigger races in London, Chicago, New York, Boston and Berlin?  Also it would have been nice to see Deena's training recovery schedule to see what kind of miles she did to get back into form after the freak foot injury.

I was kind of surprised that they did not stagger the start of the Chicago Marathon since the race had so many people in it.  But then again they probably know what they are doing.  The film shows you the struggle the athletes endure during the latter stages of the race but you don't feel the dread of miles 22-26 in the movie.  When most of the athletes have used up all the glucagon in their bodies and run out of gas literally.

I found the movie thrilling and worth watching and would rate it about 4 1/2 stars.  It has a nice small history of the marathon as well in the movie.  It is probably a movie best rented at your local library rather than buying the DVD.",1473206400,2,2885,4.230347349177331
3513252,5,B001CIOCNU,"I watch this movie every year to get mentally prepared to run my own marathon.

It is inspiring to follow the runners, and they did a nice job of mixing in a wide variety - from the professional to the elite, the sub elite to the very slow.  my only criticism is that there is very little coverage of the marathon itself, and some of the shots of the runners crossing the line is a bit clumsey, almost anti-climactic (which, I suppose, is accurate, albeit uncinematic).

Even if you cannot accomplish a marathon, it makes you want to get off the couch and run. It makes you want to set a goal and accomplish something. It also clearly shows why people find such fulfillment in running and how it is not just a crazy man's sport. They show every type of runner, from the most elite to some of the slowest, which allows the viewer to understand that really anyone can run if they set their mind to it.

I like the fact that the movie chronicles both professional runners as wells as ordinary recreational runners during their training up to and achieving their marathon goal.

3513369,4,B001CIOCNU,"If you are a runner, especially if you run or are contemplating running a marathon, this will be a favorite video.  I am none of the above, but still enjoyed the show all the same.  Quite long at just about 2 hours, the ""documentary"" (movie?) shows the preparations runners make to compete in the Chicago Marathon.  Specifically, the race is viewed through the eyes of about 8-9 competitors, but these competitors span the gamut of running ages and ability.  It featured two elite marathoners, several dedicated marathoners, and then those that just wanted to be able to say they did it.  I truly enjoyed all their stories, and there was a definite drama in finding out how they did on race day.

The direction of this movie is excellent.  The central competitors are adequately introduced to the point where the viewer has an interest in seeing if they accomplish their goals.  The sequencing of the segments leading up to the marathon are orderly and give the viewer a sense of the time progression one needs to prepare for a marathon.  The scenes of the race day are particularly well shot, and are emotion-provoking and provide a very satisfactory conclusion.

All ages will enjoy this film, but certainly it is geared to those with an interest in long-distance running.

It beautifully demonstrated the motivations and the hardships involved with taking on such a arduous goal. I especially loved how the filmaker followed each runner through the race. I was crying for the last 20 minutes of the movie as I watched and cheered each runner to the finish line. The runners and this movie were truly inspiring-- not just for runners but for anyone who is trying to achieve something that they think is close to impossible. Please watch it.

3513387,5,B001CIOCNU,"I generally prefer trail races over road races.  However, I have run several road marathons and can appreciate and relate to the experiences of the runners portrayed in the documentary Spirit of the Marathon.  I love the way the film is arranged, following the training and motivation of several runners preparing for the 2005 Chicago Marathon.  Marathon legend Deena Kastor stands out.  She's remembered for her 2004 Olympic bronze medal, but up to the point of this film, had never won a major marathon.  (Spoiler: she won!)  We also meet Daniel Njenga, a Kenyan runner.  He ended up placing third with a time of 2:07:14, 12 seconds out of first place.  Fast!

Besides these elites, the film also follows the training of some non-superhuman runners, both first-timers and seasoned runners.  Anyone who has trained for a marathon can relate to some of their experiences.  It takes dedication to get up on Saturday for the long runs, for the single mom to fit in her training runs, to pay attention to what you're eating (and not eating).  The interviews and training run footage will remind you of what you love--and hate--about running a marathon.  But mostly it will remind you of what you love.

Besides the personal stories of these runners, there are plenty of interviewers with other famous runners, as well as some brief historical information about the marathon racing's illustrious history.  A well-made, inspiring film.",1342310400,,1430,5.0

This movie was different- it prominently featured women [Deena Kastor and Joan Benoit-Samuelson are ah-mazing, as is the funny Kathrine Switzer, Lori O'Connor and all the lovely women and men featured],  and also truly defined the title of the documentary- SPIRIT of the Marathon- it delved not just into the physicality of the sport, but also the emotional and spiritual side of it, and like a marathon, was truly a journey. It's almost like a meditation- and the music was brilliant and epic. I LOVED this movie and cannot recommend it enough. See it for yourself- it'll inspire you to run!",1310774400,,852,5.173913043478261
3513396,4,B001CIOCNU,"The best part of this film, from my perspective, is the opening five minutes.  This is the sequence that shows up on YouTube and that led me to purchase the film.  It offers a condensed and thrilling vision of the marathon as a field of epic endeavor on the part of elite athletes:  Abebe Bikila, Frank Shorter, and the rest.  The vintage footage looks marvelous.  The editing is superb.

This opening sequence is false advertising.  The film itself quickly trades in the epic for the everyday:  the story of the 2005 Chicago Marathon told through up-close-and-personal documentary narratives of a half dozen runners, two of whom (a Kenyan runner and Deena Kastor) are elites, but the rest of whom are average Joes and Janes.  I get it:  the midpackers and back-of-the-packers deserve our attention, too.  They, too, partake of the marathon's epic soul-voyage, whether they're seeking to qualify for Boston or waddling at 12-minute pace.  The film also seeks to show that the elites and the Others share certain preoccupations (nagging injuries, focus on goals).  The film does this with some success.

What the film also shows us, perhaps more than it means to, is that the everyday of the Other Runners is filled with...stuff.  The peevish whining of the injured husband crushed at the fact that injury will prevent him from joining his wife in this year's race.  The tears of the inadequately prepared and slightly overweight woman who walks much of the final miles, experiencing the agony of almost-defeat and the transcendence of She Who Just Won't Stop as she crosses the finish line.  The manifold fleeting narcissistic preoccupations that fill the days of all distance runners.  Most of us know them well.  Are they the stuff of a great movie?  That's the question.

This film does some things wonderfully.  The cinematography is brilliant.  The editing is superb.  The sequence in which we follow the Kenyan runner through HIS everyday back in Kenya is inspired and revealing.  One of the Other Runners, Lori, has a face that gleams with spiritual energy:  her story is inspiring (and her running technique ain't bad).  The talking heads (Joe Henderson, Amby Burfoot, Katherine Switzer, and especially the eloquent Roger Robinson) are chosen with care.  The photo montage through which Switzer's pioneering run at Boston many years ago was almost derailed by Jock Semple's hands-on approach was terrific--and inspiring.

Still, for those, like me, who expected a focus primarily on the elites, there was something lacking.  There was, needless to say, no post-race interview with the Kenyan guy who failed, after many second- and third-place finishes, to win the race.  We got more than enough of the Other Runners.  The marathon is indeed an epic thing, and the spirit of it should be celebrated.  If you're a non-runner who is thinking about lacing up some shoes and trying a marathon, this IS the movie for you.  If you're one of John Bingham's ""penguins,"" somebody who celebrates the back-of-the-pack and especially the challenges of running a marathon with marginally adequate preparation and suffering through the final miles before achieving your moment of epic transcendence at six-and-a-half hours, this IS the movie for you.

But if you're somebody who would have liked to know a little more about Bikila, or Shorter, or how the race actually felt at the front of the pack--well, you may want to think twice before pressing the ""buy now"" button.",1299715200,6,3464,5.017543859649122

Join two top-flight runners, a couple of first-timers, and a couple of repeat marathoners as they prepare for the race.  Threaded through their story are comments from prominent runners, past and present, as well as narration and images that describe the history of the modern marathon.

This is a documentary, but it includes real-life drama, and tense moments.

I can't recommend this film highly enough!  5 solid stars.

It may even be enough to convince you to do a marathon of your own!

OK, a couple of major jaw-dropping parts of the movie include the start of the Chicago Marathon, and a panning shot of the 40,000 runners that participate!  Wow!  Also, the elite men who run the race at a pace of about 4 min 40 second miles for 26.2 miles!  Crazy!  And, they finish in just over 2 hrs...a time I'm happy to have for a 1/2 marathon.

The film follows them from the beginning of their training to race day. If your new to running, an intermediate runner or an advanced runner there is someone in this film you can identify with. Many things that happen to runners during training and racing also happen in this film from hitting the wall,struggling with injury to the guilt that comes with how much time it requires to train for a marathon is covered. The history of the marathon is also briefly covered and a few great runners such as Katherine Switzer are interviewed as part of the film to discuss marathon running.

It is often asked ""Why would you want to run 26.2 miles?""  The answer is the moment you cross the finish line.  The marathon is a journey that defines you.  There simply is no way to describe finishing one.  Because the camera is able to track the runners during the marathon, this is as close as you can get to actually experiencing it.

The stories are very compelling and honest, I like the fact that there is no judgement on why you should want to run a marathon, there are 6 different people, with 6 different reasons to do it. I also like the way the history of marathoning is interlaced with the rest of the stories, and I also enjoyed very much the takes of the beautiful city of Chicago.

While I enjoyed the documentary, and, in no way want to diminish it, I think I expected something different.  I thought I would see more elite runners and clips of epic marathon moments.

The DVD basically highlights 5  runners
and the emotional highs and lows that they go through as they each train for and run the marathon for different personal reasons.  While you come to appreciate each one's hard work and struggle, it was not exactly what I was expecting in the way of personal inspiration for myself.  Perhaps it was the way the movie was made - it didn't stay on one person for long before they would cut to a different runner.  It went back and forth a lot and I felt like I couldn't really get a grasp on anyone.

One of the best scenes for me was the sweeping shot of the starting line at the Chicago Marathon.  Approx. 40,000 runners all lined up waiting to start appeared to go on forever!  That shot was spectacular.  I got very emotional seeing that.

3513502,5,B001CIOCNU,"As originally posted on my blog - [...]

I just finished watching ""The Spirit of the Marathon,"" a documentary that follows six people through their preparation and completion of the 2005 Chicago Marathon. Despite being filmed back in 2005, the movie didn't come out until 2008, so there were nice updates about all of the runners at the end.

Someone recommended this movie on the Runner's World forums and I was able to watch it on my computer via Netflix, so it is widely accessible (also available on DVD or for rent/purchase at Amazon). It was a phenomenal movie and well worth the viewing. The six people they chose were a good mix of professional runners, experienced marathoners and first-timers. Additionally, among those categories, there were younger and older runners as well as runners who were trying to balance all of the demands of marathon training with raising a family.

The thing that I took away from the movie was first, never give up no matter what and second, you're only racing yourself. For example, there is one man who is attempting to BQ (Boston Qualify - so he needs to finish in 3 hours, 10 minutes) and ends up being injured a few months before the race. He, understandably, is very upset, but continues on and ends up supporting his wife's efforts and volunteering to help others. Contrast this with an older gentleman who is running his fourth marathon and is pleased as punch to finish in 6 hours, 15 minutes - while dragging his adult daughter along for the ride. I think people come to marathons for a variety of different reasons and motivations and this movie did a terrific job of showing a few of those.

Additionally, the shots around Chicago on race day really do try to portray the atmosphere and adrenaline that the crowd creates. While the movie is no substitute for being there and experiencing it firsthand, it's a good second cut.

I highly recommend anyone training for or contemplating a marathon to watch this movie - even multiple times. I know I'll watch it again before the race.",1241481600,,2033,4.715492957746479

The documentary follows multiple runners from all walks of life (from pros to amateurs, old and young) from their training all the way up to the marathon finish.  It has made me, a non-jogger/runner, seriously contemplate making it an integral part of my lifestyle, marathon-training or not.",1515974400,,568,4.707070707070707
