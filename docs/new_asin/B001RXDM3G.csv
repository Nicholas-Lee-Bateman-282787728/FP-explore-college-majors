3781586,4,B001RXDM3G,"Money in the Bank: It came down to Christian and Punk and Punk won. Christian should have won though since I was hoping all his recent jobbing would actually pay off. Still the match did have some good bumps. R. Truth and Evan Bourne would have been more entertaining in the match than Finlay or Mark Henry though.

Kid Rock came out and sang like 4 songs and it was a waste since the Tag Team Title match never happened, unless it happened during the pre-show.

  Woman battle royal: it was obvious Satino Merrella would win, he was dressed like a woman and was obvious to anyone watching that it was him. Yet, the announcers of course didn't notice him until the match was almost over. He eliminated Beth and Melina to win.

  Jericho vs Steamboat, Piper and Snuka: The legends surprisingly were impressive, well Piper and Steamboat anyway. I don't remember Snuka doing much at all. He was eliminated by the Walls of Jericho. Piper was surprisingly agile for once and even did a sunsetflip and a drop kick too at one point. Until he was eliminated as well with an enziguri ""if I actually spelled it right lol."" Steamboat was left alone and was awesome. He hasn't wrestled since like 1994, yet it was barely obvious. He should have won but after many near falls Jericho hit him with the Code Breaker.

  Flair then ran in and also eventually got a Code Breaker. I knew from the start though that the 3 Legends would put over Jericho just so Mickey Rourke could come in and look good. I'm a Rourke fan but the WWE really does put over celebrities too much at WM. I had enough of that since the Big Show put over stupid little Mayweather. Steamboat deserved for it to be his night a lot more. Rourke got in 2 punches and Jericho left holding his head. It was dumb.

  Matt vs Jeff Hardy: This was one of the less predictable matches of the night. I was hoping Jeff would win and thought he would but Matt won with a Twist of Fate on a chair.

  Rey vs JBL (IC Title): in a quick match Rey won with a 6:19 and JBL got the mic and said that he quits.

  Show vs Edge vs Cena: The whole match to me just felt like the John Cena show, it was lame and predictable. I think Show actually should have won since I can't remember a WM that he won at. But lame John Cena is champ yet again and won by FU'ing ""is called some other lame name now, but I can careless to remember what"" Edge on top of Big Show and then pinning Show. Since Cena has put over Show on both Smackdown and Raw in 2 separate matches it was obvious he was going to win at WM.

  HBK vs Undertaker: This one could have went either way but it was obvious it wouldn't and that Taker would win. Still, it was no doubt the best match of night. HBK actually kicked out of the Tombstone once but didn't after the second time it was hit on him. But if anyone is going to end Taker's record it should have been HBK. HHH or Cena will though I think and that will just be stupid when it happens.

  Orton vs HHH for the 100th time: I guess this was supposed to be WM worthy just because HHH finally admitted on screen to being married to Stephanie. Orton hurt her and made it personal and HHH was obviously going to get revenge. He hit a sledge hammer shot to the head then punched him a few times in the head until the ref pulled him off of Orton. Then when he felt like ending it, he hit the Pedigree. Woo Hoo, wasn't exactly WM worthy.

  I knew his reign wasn't going to end already. Edge and Jeff Hardy had short reigns recently but HHH gets to hold it for a few months every time he's champ. Hardy deserved a long reign a lot more.

  I like World title matches at WM with people who never versed each other. Both World Title matches were badly booked and I could careless about either of them. Cena and HHH need to both step aside and let someone else be in the World title match next year. Well as long as they don't verse Taker and end his record instead.",1238889600,2,3914,4.171770972037284

-The Undertaker vs. Shawn Michaels. (what can I say about this one...THE UNDEFEATED Undertaker 16-0 at wrestlemania puts the streak on the line vs. Mr. Wrestlemania. I personally would like to see the Undertaker keep his streak...IT IS AWESOME)

3781611,4,B001RXDM3G,"Hey Guys, I bought this dvd all the way to the philippines( yes, philippines knows wwe)
and imma be doing a review about WM 25.....

Money in the Bank ladder match:
This was a wrestlemania quality match! even though there were some botches, it was spectacular.
We saw Shelton Benjamin Fly 20 feet in the air, Killswitch to cm punk, and even kofi climbing
the ""half ladder"". but in the end punk becomes the 1st ever back to back MITB winner.
(shelton benjamin is just a poor guy. performs his ass of every MITB but never got the title shot.
in my opinion, he should have won the match.)
(4/5)

25-Diva battle royal to crown Miss WrestleMania:
It was a bit of a mess, we didn't even get proper introductions for returning Divas like Sunny, Molly Holly, and Torrie Wilson.
I mean thats just rude.
completely not the divas wrestling i once watched.
(1/5)

Handicap elimination match:
Now this was unexpected, i was betting that this was going to last like 2mins, or sumthing like that.
but ricky the steamboat did a brilliant job of ""showing up""
truly chris jericho is a hall of famer and deserved to win that match.
(3/5)

Extreme rules match:
The Hardy brothers faced of which to me wasn't given enough time.
It had its moments but still wasn't that extreme.
The only ""extreme"" stuff their was the table dive and the 20ft ladder missed leg drop.
but it was still entertaining.
(3/5)

Singles match for the WWE Intercontinental Championship:
Absolutely pathetic, JBL loses in 10 secs?....
jbl is one of those deserving stars to be in the hall of fame.
it would have been a good wrestling match but once again wwe makes a poor choice

Undertaker vs Shawn Michaels
one of those Stone cold vs The rock matches feel.
truly entertaining, there wasn't a moment that i was bored and wanted to skip it.
the beggining until the end. Spectacular!
(5/5)

Triple threat match for the World Heavyweight Championship:
Its a triple threat but the whole time was me seeing cena vs edge, edge vs big show and cena vs big show.
i mean someone was gonna get knocked down they they'll start fighting, then it was like that.
the only time they didn't gone 1 on 1 was when cena lift them simoultainiously.
(2.5/5)

Singles match for the WWE Championship:
If Triple H had been disqualifed or counted out, Randy Orton would have won the WWE Championship.
People are saying that this was one of the worst WM main event next to Cena vs The Miz.
I'll tell you why they taught of that. Pretend that the Undertaker vs Shawn Micaheals was a Diff. match,
now think of the main event. i would have cheered for that if that was the case, but since the crowd knew
that no match can top the taker vs shawn match that they didn't cheer anymore and did not care at all. They were just plain dead! But admit it or not, it was a great match.
(3.5/5)

Extras:
Stone Cold Celebrates with the wwe universe was a Wrestlemania moment that i'll never forget.
as in i had goose bumps until he left.
it was just terrific.

Wrestlemania 25:
Was it a good mania?
yes
Is it worth buying?
100% sure its worth it.
not the best Wrestlemania but it was sure entertaining.",1337126400,,3121,4.47887323943662
3781612,5,B001RXDM3G,"Let me start off by saying this was a very very good Wrestlemania regardless of what some other reviewers have stated.  This of course was supposed to be the silver anniversary of WM and I think the WWE put on a great show for its silver anniversary.  The event began with an opening promo for WM and then we see pop singer and former Pussycat Doll Nicole Scherzinger singing a pretty good version of ""America the Beautiful.""  Then the event itself really begins.

The opening match was the Money in the Bank Ladder match which featured Mark Henry, MVP, Finlay, CM Punk, Shelton Benjamin, Kofi Kingston, Christian and Kane going at it.  The match itself was very good with some great highspots as well.  I do feel that Kofi stole the show and I think deserved to win the match but we see CM Punk win the match for the second year in a row much to the dismay of some people.  Still though, at 14:24 it was a really good way to start the show.  (8/10)

After this match we get some footage of WWE fan axxess.  This is followed up by a terrible Diva Battle Royal that was supposed to feature some women from the past such as Sunny, Victoria, Molly Holly and Torrie Wilson.  On the DVD Kid Rock's performance before the battle royal is edited out and I just wish they would have edited this match as well.  It was just so bad and then to have Santino Marella win the thing as ""Santina"" was just horrible.  Terrible match from a great PPV.  This was 6:00 too long. (1/10)

After that crap we see some of the events that led up to the Chris Jericho Handicapped match.  After that we get to see Hall of Famers Roddy Piper, Jimmy Snuka and the great Ricky Steamboat along with Ric Flair come to the ring to take on Chris Jericho.  Honestly Snuka was great to see but his in ring ability was terrible and Piper wasn't much better.  Thankfully this was an elimination match so we didn't have to see much of them.  Steamboat stole the match with a great just great performance that proves that he's still got it.  It was truly a joy to see Ricky and with the exception of some gray hair and some added weight Steamboat really hasn't lost much to his step.  Still, Jericho was too much for all of the Hall of Famers and he was able to win the match after 8:55 of action.  After the match, Mickey Rourke, who was in the crowd basically there because of the movie ""The Wrestler"" got into the ring and with like 2 punches knocked Jericho on his butt and got a huge pop from the crowd.  Great moment and pretty good match.  (7/10)

Once that match was done we see some of the events that led up to the Extreme Rules match and then we see the Extreme Rules match between brothers Jeff and Matt Hardy.  Most people were looking forward to this match and were hoping that Jeff would beat the holy hell out of his brother but that was not to be because even though Jeff put on a great effort he still was not able to beat his big brother in this great contest.  It was a great match but I feel it did not have any real emotion to it, that it was just 2 guys going through the motions to put together a good effort.  I was looking forward to feeling something in this one like I did when Bret and Owen went at it 15 years earlier or even when Vince and Shane went at it 8 years before, but I didn't feel it.  Still, a lot of cool moves and great highspots at a little over 13:00 made this match worth seeing.  (8/10)

Next we go backstage with Randy Orton and The Legacy.  Good skit and not too long.  After that we get, believe it or not, an Intercontinental title match between JBL and Rey Mysterio.  This would be the first time the IC title would be on the line at this event since WM 18 and I was looking forward to seeing it.  As soon as the bell rang though the match was over.  Rey hit a few moves and 21 seconds later the match was over and Rey was champ.  Not really worth seeing but still great to see JBL lose that quick.  (Also as a side note I loved Rey's mask as he was dressed like the Joker).  (3/10)

Up next we get all of the events that led up to the Shawn Michaels/Undertaker match and then we get to see the match.  Before this match we had seen these 2 go at one on one at only like 3 PPV's so it was going to be a real treat to see this one.  I got to tell you, these 2 put on one hell of a contest.  I mean for over a half an hour these 2 guys (in their 40s) made us all sit back and just remember why we love wrestling so much.  Many have said this one will go down as the greatest WM match of all time.  I don't know, only time will tell but I think it very well may.  This match has all the action and raw emotion that I wanted to see in the Extreme Rules match and didn't get.  This was definatly the match of the night and did win Match of the Year from PWI magazine.  Awesome contest and I hear it's the reason that Bret Hart wanted to come back to the WWE after seeing it.  Awesome!!!  (10/10)

Up next is all the events that led up to the World Heavyweight title match.  After that we see Edge once again defend his WWE World Heavyweight title against a very game John Cena and a monster of a man in the Big Show.  There are so many haters of this match but it was one that I actually enjoyed.  I think all 3 men worked well together and put on a very good and entertaining match for the people in the audience and at home.  I don't know if Cena needed to win the title this night but I was ok with it.  I do wish that Edge would have won but what can you do?  At a runtime of about 14:00 this match wasn't too short and not too long so I am fine with it.  (8/10)

After that we get footage from the Hall of Fame ceremony and then we see the introduction of the HOF class of 2009 which is always great to see.  This year had a Texas and cowboy theme to it.  This year Howard Finkel, Koko B. Ware, Terry Funk, Dory Funk Jr., Bill Watts, the Von Erich family (mainly Kerry, David, Mike, Fritz and the only living Von Erich Kevin), Ricky Steamboat and Steve Austin.  Still scratching my head over Koko's induction into the Hall but the rest were very deserving individuals and I for one was glad to FINALLY see Austin and Steamboat go into the Hall.  Up next we see where WM 26 is going to be and an attendance announcement announcing that 72,744 people attended the Astrodome event.  After that we see all of the events that led up to the main event and then we see Triple H and Vince McMahon backstage.

All of this takes us to the Main Event where Randy Orton would try to win the WWE Championship from Triple H.  I got to tell you, all of the stuff that Orton did to Triple H leading up to this match was actually better than the match itself.  Everything from winning the Royal Rumble, to punt kicking Vince in the head, to beating the holy hell out of Shane and of course DDTing Stephanie was just great but this match felt a little flat to me.  Maybe it was the fact that most felt it should have been a little more violent maybe even having Orton show some blood (which didn't happen due to WWE's PG stance at the time).  For 23:00 it just seemed like Orton and HHH were going through the motions of trying to put together a great match but unfortunatly they failed in that effort.  Also not having Orton win and continue his path of destruction through the WWE was just a bad mistake.  Pretty good effort though.  (8/10)

This event as a whole was very good.  There were some missteps like the battle royal, the extreme rules match and the main event but this event was still good enough to watch.  I did enjoy the MitB match, the Handicapped match, the World Heavyweight title match and the Taker/Michaels match which made this event worth seeing again and again.  I give this event a 10/10!",1336694400,,7710,4.120724346076459
3781613,4,B001RXDM3G,"In 1985 Vince McMahon put everything he had into a grand vision of a wrestling event known as Wrestlemania, now on this night for the 25th anniversary of Wrestlemania we will witness title clashes, personal grudges and a contest between two veterans that brought the crowd to its feet and stole the show.

-We start out with a video package where many superstars talk about their favorite Wrestlemania moments, which was very good and did help build-up the big event feel of the show.

-Money In The Bank Ladder Match, CM Punk vs. Mark Henry vs. MVP vs. Finlay vs. Shelton Benjamin vs. Kofi Kingston vs. Christian vs. Kane: Good opener here with the usual spots, expecte double teaming and of course Shelton shines hitting a couple of good high spots, including a helo dive off a ladder onto a bunch of guys on the outside. Kane and Henry also have a good showing as they use their strength to overpower the other superstars and there was an obvious comedic spot where Hornswoggle hit the Tadpole splash onto everyone on the outside. As Kane & Punk are battling at the top, Punk kicks Kane off the ladder and grabs the briefcase to win his second straight MITB match. 9/10.

-25 Diva Battle Royal: Thankfully the horrid Kid Rock performance was not included, unfortunately the match itself still was shown. There's diva's from the past, the present and also a new ""diva"" that turned out to be Santino in drag. This wasn't a very memorable match, the eliminations happened fairly quickly and no one really seemed the care. The fans cheered for Santino more than anyone and he ended up winning the match. 2/10.

-3 on 1 Handicap Elimination Match, Ricky ""The Dragon"" Steamboat, Jimmy ""Superfly"" Snuka & ""Rowdy"" Roddy Piper w/Ric Flair vs. Chris Jericho: Its standard for a handicap match until its down to Steamboat and Jericho, then the match picks up as Ricky looks like he never missed a step and was able to take it to Jericho and almost have him beat on a few occasions. He even hit his trademark arm drags and a nice crossbody but he finally fell victim to the Codebreaker as Chris pinned him for 3. 6/10. The aftermath with Flair attacking Jericho was fine but the part Mickey Rourke coming to the ring and knocking out Jericho wasn't very good honestly.

-Extreme Rules Match, Matt Hardy vs. Jeff Hardy: After costing Jeff the WWE title at the Royal Rumble and weeks upon weeks of slander and egging him on, these two brothers met on the grandest stage of all Wrestlemania. Its pretty hard hitting, plenty of weapon use, Jeff hits a big splash off the top rope through two tables Matt was on. Matt was also able to hold his own countering the Whisper In The Wind with a steel chair to the legs. Jeff jumps over a huge ladder in the ring but Matt moves and Jeff crashes to the mat, then Matt puts Jeff's neck on a steel chair and hits a Twist of Hate for the win. 8/10.

-WWE Intercontinental Championship Match, JBL (Champion) vs. Rey Mysterio: There's a good JBL promo where he slams the fans and says he will win tonight. The match itself is so quick, JBL attacks Rey before the bell, then once it begins Rey ends up stunning JBL with the 619 and the splash from the top for the 3 to win in 21 seconds. 3/10. Afterwards JBL ends up quitting in the middle of the ring.

-Shawn Michaels vs. The Undertaker: Whatever I say will pale in comparison to the match itself. From the entrances for both men, to the the numerous close falls, to Taker's dive over the top rope and landing on his head, to Michaels kicking out of a Tombstone and being the one man you felt could end the undefeated streak and he almost did. It goes for 30 minutes of high impact action, Taker hits a second Tombstone and finally keeps Michaels down for three. 11/10.

-Triple Threat Match for the World Heavyweight Championship, Edge (Champion) vs. John Cena vs. The Big Show: Good entrances by all three including the usual over the top type from Cena and it wasn't a bad match, all three got some good moves in as well as chances to shine. Show was dominate at points, Edge picked his spots and Cena showed his strength lifting both Show and Edge on his shoulders. John of course ends up picking up the win here to become the champion, again. 7/10.

-Introduction of the 2009 Hall of Fame Inductees: Good segment where the inductees come out and we're treated to Stone Cold Steve Austin giving the fans one last celebration like only Austin can do.

-WWE Championship Match, Randy Orton (Champion) vs. Triple H: After weeks and weeks of Orton targeting HHH's wife, the McMahon family and HHH himself, we finally have this clash which while not a bad match isn't Wrestlemania main event quality. They battled outside and inside the ring and there was plenty of hard hitting moves with both having the advantage at times and some good nearfalls. But for all the buildup it seemed to be a lot like the Triple H/Chris Jericho match at Wrestlemania X8 where they both tried hard but something seemed to be missing, that certain magic. It ends with Trips hitting a ton of mounted punches then the pedigree for the win to retain his title. 6/10.

-Lumberjack Match for the Unified Tag Team Championship, Carlito & Primo (Champions) vs. The Miz & John Morrison: Its your standard warm-up match for the live crowd and the usual lumberjack match, with the superstars outside getting involved at times and there was good tag team wrestling throughout. Carlito & Primo end up winning to become the Unified tag champs. 6/10.

-Highlights from the first 24 Wrestlemania's, good clips of all.

Disc 2

The entire Hall of Fame show is included with speeches by Stone Cold Steve Austin, Ricky Steamboat, Terry & Dory Funk, Koko B. Ware, The Von Erichs, Howard Finkel & ""Cowboy"" Bill Watts. All the speeches are good though Austin's and Steamboat's are the best and like always its great to hear from many of the legends, the inductees and those who induct them.

The event really didn't have that huge Wrestlemania feel, as the only standout classic is Taker/HBK. The rest of the matches are good to just horrible and while not a bad event its not Wrestlemania quality.",1321747200,,6132,4.5821167883211675

WRESTLEMANIA 25

1.[MITB] CHRISTIAN VS FINLAY VS CM PUNK VS MARK HENERY VS SHELTON BENJAMIN VS KANE VS MVP VS KOFI KINGSTON-as with every Mania this match was good and nothing but fun. That is all this match is meant to be really while at the same time put some one over. Of course there are numerous high spots and every one here gets in some good moments. I wouldn't say this is the best MITB match ever but like the others it is good. Good opener with Punk being the first man ever to win back to back MITB matches.

2.25 DIVA BATTLE ROYAL-all I can say about this is HILARIOUS, just check this out and you will know what I ma talking about.

3. CHRIS JERICHO VS RICKY STEAMBOAT, JIMMY SNUKA, RODDY PIPER-three of the all time greats go up against another all time great. All three men do what they can but Snuka is the first to go as he taps to the walls of Jericho. Shortly after that Piper is eliminated, Piper is still one of my favorites ever. Now I have to say that if you are not impressed by Steamboat here then you are not watching what I watched. The Dragon puts on a great performance for a Legend, in fact unlike any Legend really. Although Y2J pins him after a code breaker he still put on a great show. Afterwards Y2J is dropped by Mickey Rourke, I would like to point out that MMA Legend FRANK SHAMROCK was sitting right next to Rourke on his left.

4.[EXTREME RULES]MATT HARDY VS JEFF HARDY-this is a pretty good extreme rules match as the brothers go right at each other. They waste no time going for the weapons and trying to really hurt one another. Jeff takes a big chance and it does not pay off, Matt though takes advantage and ends it. He hits a twist of fate while Jeff's head is inside a fold up chair. I was so happy that Matt won this since I have always preferred him over Jeff.

5.[I-C TITLE]JBL VS REY MYSTERIO-I have to say I am a fan of JBL because the guy is hilarious. He shows how as well here with his opening mic time as he addressed us Texans. After that he attacks Rey once he gets to the ring, which by the way Rey's Joker influenced ring attire was great. Any way he attacks him before the bell to get the early advantage, things turn though once the bell rings. Rey wins the title easily after his 619 and such, what happened afterwards upset me though.

6. SHAWN MICHAELS VS THE UNDERTAKER-ah yes the match that every one wanted to see and for good reason. The battle of two Texans right here in Texas and two legends at the same time. The entrances for this match are legendary to say the least. HBK coming from up high in white like he was sent from heaven. The Undertaker emerges from the depths like he is from, well I am sure you know. This match is honestly one of the greatest matches ever and possibly the greatest Mania match ever. It really is that good and everything else does not compare on the card, this was an instant classic. I can't even begin to explain how great this match is but the story that was told was brilliant. My boy fell at the hands of Taker on this night but they both won in my opinion because they made sure we won in getting to witness it.

7.[WORLD TITLE]EDGE VS BIG SHOW VS JOHN CENA-the storyline going into this one revolved around a love triangle. That triangle included Vickie, Big Show and of course Edge. Cena got involved and was the one that brought the triangle to light. Now as for the match it is not going down as an all time classic but it is entertaining. Cena's show of strength at the end is cool as he pulls off the win for the title. Also Cena's entrance is cool as usual.

8.[WWE TITLE]RANDY ORTON VS TRIPLE H-now while most people hate on this match I will say it is not as bad as most say. I will admit that with these two though it was a little lackluster but not horrible. The storyline going into this was good and had a good build up and this turned into a brawl a bit. The problem here was that the pace was to slow for to long to be honest. Triple H gets the win here but not the best of main events especially after HBK/Taker on this card.

BONUS

9.[TAG TITLE LUMBERJACK MATCH]THE MIZ & JOHN MORRISON VS CARLITO & PRIMO-now this here was a good match and it is a shame that it was not on the televised card and regulated to the DVD special features. The action here is faced paced with great high spots, plus when is a lumberjack match not fun. Also it was great to see Tommy Dreamer, one of my all time favorites. This match really should have been on the pay-per-view. Carlito and Primo end o up being the first Unified Tag Champs here in a great match.

Also as a special feature they have these cool little videos of each Wrestlemania prior to this one, and then of course you get the Hall of Fame ceremony from that year. Over all this was an ok Mania that while had some good matches it was also a bit of a let down at times. Honestly though I did enjoy it as I always do.",1312675200,,4895,4.169312169312169

1. CM Punk vs Mark Henry vs MVP vs Finlay vs Shelton Benjamin vs Kofi Kingston vs Christian vs Kane Money in the Bank Ladder Match: This was a great way to kick off wrestlemania, another great money in the bank match, i would say though that this is the worst one, but it is still very good, some crazy spots include, a worlds strongest slam onto a ladder, a leap of faith off a ladder and a chokeslam off the ladder, this was a great match ****

2. Chris Jericho vs Ricky Steamboat/ Roddy Piper/ Jimmy Snuka: This wasn't that good, snuka was terrible in the ring, piper was ok, but then ricky was great! He out wrestled jericho at some points, GGood ending, and the aftermath was interesting too **1/4

3. Matt Hardy vs Jeff Hardy Extreme Rules Match: This was a physical, personal war, this was a good match, not as good as there match at backlash but still good, jeff puts matt through 2 tables, there are a lot of weapons involved, even a vaccuum cleaner! The ending fitted perfectly with this match and it looked quite sick ***1/4

4. JBL(c)vs Rey Mysterio IC Title: I cant rate this match, it only went on for like 20 seconds, I will say that rey looked cool in the joker outfit, RIP Heath Ledger, who was a great actor N/A

5. The Undertaker vs Shawn Michaels: This is in my top 3 wrestlemania matches of all time, this is incredible! So much action in this match, near falls, finisher after finisher, kickout after kickout, there is a sick spot in the middle where undertaker does his signiture leap of faith and lands on his head on top of the camera man, these two battle an unforgettable war for 30 minutes, the ending was perfectly done, you have to see this match, this ppv is worth getting just for this match *****

6. Edge(c)vs Big Show vs John Cena WH Title: This is a very good match, I really liked it, I didn't expect it to be that good, crazy spot where edge spear show through the barricade, this match goes back and forth, and each wrestler gives it there all until the final bell rung, I wasn't suprised with the outcome, check out Bcklash 2009, a month later, John cena and Edge have and amazing match in the last man standing match ***3/4

7. Triple H(c)vs Randy Orton WWE Title: This was a very weak main event, I thought it was going to be a lot better, randy made this match very slow paced when he was on the offense, I liked both of there finishers being hit in the first minute, the ending was predictable, this main event should of been a lot better and was actually a big let down **3/4

The match between HBK & The Undertaker was a back-and-forth,well-plotted,well-executed,nail-biting,heart-stopping match of the year.

3781619,4,B001RXDM3G,"Ive been a fan of WWE since I was a kid and will be till the day Undertaker retires. Only PPVs I ever watched were Wrestlmania and Summerslam, Wrestlemania 25 is a memorable event, but it isn't complete. You are thinking.....you liked it and you say something like this? Here is my reasoning: during this ppv, there was also a special performance by Kid Rock that was actually good enough to remember. Im watching the ppv and all of sudden it goes straight to the diva battle royal. I was thinking.....what the hell? Rewound it couple of times to make sure I wasn't dreaming, but it was true. The Kid Rock Concert was taken out completely and was the beginning for the divas to make their entrance. While I am mad that this good performance was taken out, I would understand if there were copyrights involved or Rock wanted too much money.

This PPV is great from beginning to end. My favorite matches were Shawn Michaels vs Undertaker and Matt Hardy vs Jeff Hardy, which these matches in my mind, were two of the greatest bouts ever done with in the squared circle. Ive been a fan of Undertaker and Jeff Hardy, as well as Matt, for a long time and these matches kept me on the edge of my seat when I first ordered it on PPV. My favorite Wrestlemania moment was with Mickey Rourke ""knocking"" Chris Jericho out. Wrestling may be fake but it is very entertaining to me and like I said before when Undertaker retires is the day I stop viewing WWE until I have kids. He is the only reason I still watch wrestling because of the Wrestlmania streak. There have been streaks like the Yankees streak in world series victories and others that I cannot think of off the top of my head, but Undertaker's streaks is one of the greatest accomplishments in sports history.

If you are a WWE fan and you like wrestlemania like I do, then pick this up because while it is a keeper, still a little made the Kid Rock performance was taken out.

PS: this years wrestlemania was alright but I do not think Ill be buying it. It was just one of those PPVs that only gets a few hand claps after someone makes a presentation. Only things memorable were shawn michaels vs undertaker 2, edge vs chris jericho match, Hart vs McMahon match, mysterio vs CM Punk and HHH vs Sheamus match; these are the only matches that stood out in my mind.",1272326400,,2312,4.409836065573771

I think I saw Sunny for about 2 seconds if that, and that's all. To top it off, they had Santino in it and he won... WEAK!

Kid Rock pretty much killed the show with that long set he played.

3781631,3,B001RXDM3G,"C.M. Punk Vs. Mark Henry Vs. Kane Vs. Finley Vs. Kofi Kingston Vs. MVP Vs. Shelton Benjamin Vs. Christian (Money In The Bank Ladder Match) - The annual spot-fest that WWE fans have come to love. If you are a fan of spotty, yet very entertaining matches, this will be your bread and butter, but if not, it won't do anything for you. One thing that is undeniable, however, is the Money in the Bank's ability to create stars, at a time when WWE needs it the most. C.M. Punk wins in a very good, entertaining opener. Nothing you really haven't seen from this specialty match, but it certainly wasn't bad. ***1/2

25 Diva Battle Royale - Absolute garbage. After an exhausting, and incredibly terrible Kid Rock performance, which drained the life of out of the crowd (in a bad way), this match made me wonder why I even tune in. Truly terrible; even the winner was pathetic. Having a male win a female battle royal shows how much the WWE cares about their Women's division. The returning Diva's, which was supposed to be the highlight of the match, didn't even get proper introductions, or farewell's. In all respect to the commentators, they stunk it up as well. 1/4* (Just for seeing the returning Diva's.)

Ricky Steamboat, ""Rowdy"" Roddy Piper & ""Superfly"" Jimmy Snuka Vs. Chris Jericho (3 on 1 Handicap match) - Going into this match, I was convinced it would be the garbage of the night, but I was more than pleasantly surprised. Simply put, this match was actually very solid- nothing special, but a more-than-respectable effort put out by 4 Legends in this business. Jimmy Snuka and Roddy Piper put on a performance that was nothing to go out of you're way to see, but who can blame these 55+ year olds? Ricky Steamboat, however, gave the fans one of the highlight's of the night- he was actually a great performer! Honestly, he could probably out=work 80% of the WWE Roster. Also, kudos to Jericho for putting up a great WrestleMania performance (something that was lacking from other athletes the entire night). **3/4

Matt Hardy Vs. Jeff Hardy (Extreme Rules Match) - Going into this 'Mania, I' sure we all expected this to be runner-up for match of the night, however, it definately was not. While it was far from  bad, it was also nothing special at all. Again, an underwhelming performance from both of the Hardy Boyz. To be honest, I've never thought they've had good chemistry. ***1/4 (It wasn't atrocious y any stretch of the word, but it was very disappointing, keeping up with the theme of the night.)  However, I did enjoy the fact that Matt got the win.

Rey Mysterio Vs. JBL (WWE Intercontinental Title Match) -Here, the WWE shows that not only do they not care about their tag team division (by kicking it off the card in place for a poor mini-concert), or their women's division (by having a male win the 'Miss WrestleMania' crown), they also demonstrate why the midcard means nothing to them- simply put, Rey pins JBL in 21 seconds. DUD

The Undertaker Vs. Shawn Michaels - Absolutely stunning match. If it wasn't for these two guys, this would have been undoubtably the third worst 'Mania of all time (behind 15, and 2). They absolutely tore the house down with some awesome storytelling and psychology, false finishes, and sick bumps. Although 1 move was slightly botched, to me, this is the essence of Pro-Wrestling. They had the crowd in the palm of their hands, and didn't let go. ***** (And I don't give those away too often!)

John Cena Vs. The Big Show Vs. Edge (Triple Threat Match for the World Heavyweight Championship) - Again, really underwhelming. It was far from bad, and my favorite of the double main event here, but definately not that great. For a World Heavyweight Championship Main Event at WrestleMania, this really disappointed. Nothing special here. ***

Randy Orton Vs. HHH (WWE World Title Match) - Absolute disappointment of the night, and that is truly saying something, considering the rest of garbage on this card. They didn't work a particularly bad match, but if this was a main event for Raw, I would have been slightly disappointed, let alone the main event for their most coveted prize in the 'grandest stage of them all'. The crowd was absolutely dead, and they had every right to be that way. **1/2 (Nothing truly terrible, but incredibly disappointing. One of the most underwhelming (and I know I've used that word a lot) main event's in Wrestlemania history.)

Overall, this was a disappointing show. It truly demonstrated what is wrong it WWE- lack of mid card depth, tag team depth, and women that can actually wrestle. Although Michaels/Undertaker is an absolute must watch for any pro wrestling fan out there, nothing else on this card (with the exception of Steamboat's performance) was particularly great. It just goes to show you that the stars of yesteryear (Michaels, Undertaker, Jericho, Steamboat) will always be legends, while the stars of today (Orton, Cena, Big Show) will always be just wrestler's.

This match is great and very fast paced. I didn't think that it was worthy of being the opener. Great spots in this match like Benjamin doing a dive off the ladder on to everyone, kofi getting world strongest slammed on a ladder, hornswoggle doing the tad pole splash on everyone, christian saving himself and the ladder, and a huge cokeslam off the ladder. The wrong man won though later cashing in his money in the bank and screwing Jeff Hardy. This match also includes a lot of highflying moments and ladder use.

This match is pretty good. It could have been better, but still good. I didn't like the stipulation to this match(elimination) Not very good with jericho winning. But great moment when jericho got punched by Mickey Rourke.
3.5/5

Jeff hardy vs. Matt Hardy-Extreme rules
Great match here. A good use of weapons in this mach like a, trash can, vacuum cleaner, tables, chairs, ladders, creches, Kendo sticks, and a wm 25 poster. What a moment when Jeff missed a leg drop off a 16 ft, also, if you look closely, you can see Jeff go through the ring some. Also, awesome moment when Jeff dived off the top rope and made Matt go through tables. A very sick ending.
4/5

JBL vs. Rey Mysterio-Intercontinental Championship
This match is a total waste and is just a filler. This match is only 21 seconds, and was dominated by JBL before the match was even started, and mysterio finally wins the intercontinental title. Great moment when JBLOSER quit. FINALLY!!!!! No more blubber.
2/5

Undertaker vs. Shawn Michaels
I hope you can say the word classic because that is what this match is. This match is fast paced through the entire match and is never boring, and was like all their other matches, really good, except this was a classic. This match totally deserved to be the main event, but sadly wasn't. This match is defanatly match of the night and match of the year. I really liked the buildup for this and that these two had a very good rivalry going. Great moments when Shawn missed the moonsaulet, and when undertaker dived on a camera man. I loved that the streak continues to 17-0. Awesome moment when taker kicked out of the sweet chin music and michaels kicked out of the tombstone. Best moment in the match when taker countered the moonsaulet into the tombstone for the win. This match is very entertaining and is one of the best WWE and Wrestlemania matches ever. It is also the second longest Mania' match ever.
5/5

John Cena vs. Edge vs. Big Show-World Heavyweight Championship
Good match, but a little short for a triple threat, but still good. This match was surprisingly brutal with Cena pulling off the win with a attitude adjustment on big slow and edge. Also, great moment in the match when edge made big slow go through the barricade. Also, who can forget the super human effort by cena when he picked up slow and edge on his shoulders. Good triple threat here.
4/5

Triple H vs. Randy Orton-WWE Championship
I don't have much to say about this match it is so stupid. This match is almost watchable, but not very good. This is more like a brawl than a match and didn't deserve to be the main event. I like how hhh kicked orton in the skull and hit him with the sledge hammer when the ref was down and got the pedigree for the win to retain. The only good thing about this match was the orton goes too far and eliminates the McMahon factor buildup.

3781659,5,B001RXDM3G,"Ok, first of all, the WWE doesn't try anymore.  The creative team should be fired.  The marketing team should be fired.  Why?  They threw this card together with little to no build up with the exception of three matches.  They wonder why their PPV buyrates have plummeted over the last year.  My advice?  Start promoting the card weeks before the event, rather than announcing matches DAYS before you expect people to drop 40-55 bucks for your PPV.

Expectations for the silver anniversary of Wrestlemania were high.  Big matches, big build ups, 25 years worth of superstars.....  Not much of that hype was met unfortunately.

MITB- 4.5/5
Much better than you'd think looking at the participants.  Some of the sickest spots EVER in any MITB.  This one exceeded my expectations.

25 Diva Battle Royal- 0/5
The women's division is a joke for one reason.  The WWE pushes and promotes the ladies with the most silicon, rather than the most wrestling talent.(And there are SEVERAL ladies who are excellent in ring workers.)  What a waste.

Jimmy Superfly Snuka, Rowdy Roddy Piper, and Ricky The Dragon Steamboat w/Ric Flair vs. Chris Jericho-2/5
Pathetic exploitation of once great performers.  Snuka and Piper are understandably shells of their former selves.  They most definately SHOULD have been part of WM25...but not in this manner.  The only saving grace from the ugly match and the groan worthy predictable involvement of Mickey Rourke was Steamboat's amazing performance.  He was well deserving of the 'You've Still Got it' chants.

Jeff Hardy vs. Matt Hardy EXTREME RULES match- 3.5/5
Neither mans best effort.  Perhaps with more time they could have done more, but this one didn't live up to my expectations from these two super talented bucks.

IC Title Match JBL (c) vs. Rey Mysterio- 0/5
JBL may have lost his in ring skills and physique due to years of nagging injuries, but he was easily the best heel on the mic that the WWE had.  What a shame to send him off this way in a squash match.  Hell, it wasn't a match....it was a circus show.  Like JBL or not, doesn't the IC title deserve better than this?

HBK vs The Undertaker- 5/5
The match that saved the show.  Period.  The reason to spend 30 bucks on this item.  An instant classic that will be celebrated for decades to come.

World Heavyweight Championship Match
Edge (c) vs. Big Show vs. Cena-0/5

First of all, Poor Big Show was thrown in this match just so we could blissfully avoid the 1,999,999th singles contest for a world title between Edge and Cena.  It's sad that Cena can hope for 60% crowd approval at best and this damn company keeps him a face.  Not only that, but buries talent like Jericho, Edge, Triple H, HBK, and anyone else stood up in front of him.  Thankfully this wasn't the last match of the night.  The WWE has sent far too many hardcore wrestling fans home unhappy with WM closing with a Cena main event win.

WWE Championship Match
Triple H (c) vs. Randy Orton- 3/5

Without a doubt the most engaging storyline of the year.  The best lead up to WM by far.  So much hype, yet come matchtime, so much disappointment.  Both men are capable of better, but this simply wasn't their best efforts.  Honestly, the biggest joke was the one sided DQ stipulation put against Triple H.  What a joke.  How stupid.  What a way to handicap a WM main event...what should be the culmination of an excellent long term feud.  *groan*

Extras
Miz/Morrison unification match against the Colons.  Good match, should have been on the live show.
WM Moments-Basically the same spots they aired on Raw/Smackdown in the weeks leading up to WM.
Hall of Fame 2009

The ladder match and HBK/Taker are worth the purchase price, the rest ranges from good to whatever.

The Kid Rock segment was completely cut from the DVD/Blu Ray.  That is NOT a bad thing...

Definately not the best WM and a pitiful attempt at a celebration of 25 years.  A lackluster effort saved by the dead man and Mr. Wrestlemania.",1243728000,5,3965,4.686046511627907
3781660,4,B001RXDM3G,"Originally before Wrestlemania 25 aired, I didn't know what to expect. I recieved some disappointments and some great moments.

Money in the Bank ladder match: Mark Henry vs. Kofi Kingston vs. Kane vs. Finlay vs. MVP vs. C.M. Punk vs. Christian

MITB matches you usually see some new an innovative moves, along with other moves that makes the crowd applaud and come to their feet and cheer for all competitors involved.. This was no different. This had some great moves in the match. Christian, C.M. Punk and M.V.P stole the show. Personally, I rather had two other guys win the match, than the guy that did win. However, I am ok with the outcome.
On a scale of 1-10:...... 8.5/10

25 Diva Battle Royal...... Not even worth typing about..

Roddy Piper, Jimmy Snuka, Ricky Steamboat vs. Chris Jericho----Three on One Legends Handicap Match

When it came down to it being Ricky Steamboat against Jericho was when the match got good. I didn't know Steamboat had it left in him and he held its own. Not as great as Steamboat vs. Savage at Wrestlemania 3, but it was good.
On a scale of 1-10:......... 6.0/10

Jeff Hardy vs. Matt Hardy: Extreme Rules

In My Opinion this match was mostly dominated by one Hardy, awesome use of weapons, moves, props and so forth..A sick and devastating Twist of Fate by one Hardy ends the match, but the wrong Hardy won.
On a scale of 1-10:....... 7/10

Rey Mysterio vs. JBL: Intercontinental Championship Match

The match was a very short match, I think the storyline was bad but the right person won the match. I'm going to give a rating cause of who won the match.
On a scale of 1-10........  7/10

Undertaker vs. Shawn Michaels: The Streak on the Line

In this match were/are my #1 and #2 favorite wrestlers. I was really afraid for the Undertaker after his dive over the top rope missed and nearly wound up with a broken neck. This was the top 5 match of all time and best Wrestlemania Match of all time. It was hard to tell who was gonna win. There were so many near falls, kick out of finishers, two super kicks, tombstones, last rides, figure four, Hells Gate all either broken or kicked out of. After nearly 35 minutes of action and suspense. I am happy with the outcome. This match was worth the price of the dvd and it saved Wrestlemania.
On a scale of 1-10...... 10/10

John Cena vs. Edge vs. The Big Show...Triple Threat Match for the World Heavyweight Championship

This match was good but not great, I would have rather seen Cena vs. Edge but it has been done. It was good and amazing to see Cena pick up both men for a double Attitude Adjuster. If it was w/o the Big Show, I would give this match and 9.0, but although it was a good match and the slowness of The Big Show, Cena and Edge made it watchable and good and I will give it the following rating.
On a scale of 1-10......... 7.5/10

Randy Orton va. Triple H...WWE Heavyweight Championship

This match has been done more than Cena vs. Edge, I do think the Only perfect match between Orton/Triple H was there Last Man Standing match at No Mercy 2007. This was a decent match, the build up was good, however I would have left a couple things left out of the build up. The punt to the head of Orton was a nice touch but it would have nice to sell the punt afterwards with an injury. It was a decent match, not long enough, but decent enough.

3781662,3,B001RXDM3G,"First let me start off by saying that I've been a wrestling fan for a while, but unfortunately this maybe one of the last PPV's I get because of how poorly the PPV was done, and one more reason is because if you watched RAW on May 25th of 2009 you can agree it was probably one of the biggest wastes of time for any wrestling fan. Anyway lets move on to the PPV shall we.

In terms of how the PPV was hyped it was pretty big. It was being held in Reliant Stadium which is a huge stadium where the Houstan Texans of the NFL play. Big storylines were done and huge people were booked for the event (or so we thought). So would this PPV live up to the hype with its matches?

Match 1. Money In The Bank Ladder Match: CM Punk vs. Kofi Kingston vs. MVP vs. Shelton Benjamin vs. Kane vs. Mark Henry vs. Finlay vs. Christian

Going in I thought this match was going to be awesome, and it was. That was until I saw The Money In the Bank Ladder Match from Wrestlemania 21. What I realized is that at least half of the stuff that was done in the MITB in Wrestlemania 25 was done in Wrestlemania 21. One HUGE example was when all the people do moves off the top rope and land on everybody that's outside. Don't get me wrong there were some amazing moments like when Kofi Kingston nearly climbed to the briefcase on a ladder that wasn't even set, and when Shelton jumped from a ladder on everybody. That stuff was cool. Unfortunately CM Punk won the match again even though he really didn't do a lot in the match. Oh well that's how the WWE works though. Overall: 5 out of 10

25 diva battle royal

This match starting off looked ok at best. Until you noticed Santino... I mean Santina Marella in the ring. As soon as you saw her you knew she would win the match. So basically the match was a waste of time in my book. Overall: 1 out of 10

3 on 1 Handicap Elminination Match: Ricky ""The Dragon"" Steamboat, ""Rowdy"" Roddy Piper, and Jimmy ""Superfly"" Snuka vs. Chris Jericho

This match also was unfortunately a squash match in a way. Although it is worth viewing because of how good Ricky Steamboat still is in the ring. He maybe old but he definately still has it. Unfortunately Jimmy and Roddy don't. Jericho does win the match, but then... MICKY ROUKE COMES IN TO SAVE THE DAY!!! Actually instead he gets in this very awkward brawl/boxing thing with Jericho and then awkwardly hits him in the ear. It was a very wierd moment for both men probably. Overall: 4 out of 10

Extreme Rules Match: Matt vs. Jeff Hardy

Brother vs. Brother. Blood vs. Blood. A huge grudge match between family. This match was actaully pretty good when I look back at it. Some good spots including a pretty good twist of fate done by Matt when Jeff's neck is in between the chair. This was proabably the second best match of the night in my book. Overall: 7 out of 10

UNDERTAKER vs. SHAWN MICHAELS

This is the only... AND I MEAN ONLY reason that you should look at this dvd. These two men are the true Mr. Wrestlemainas. Never in my life have I seen two men give their all and then some in that ring. The match may have been slow at first but my god did it get exciting. Not only is this the best match of the year, but this maybe one of the greatest of all time. You have to see it for yourself. Overall: 12 out of 10

Triple Threat Match: Big Show vs. John Cena vs. Edge

Unfortunately we are brought back down to earth by a pretty sloppy match between these 3 good wrestlers. Unfortunately it was hard to get into this match because of how weird it was done. There were some good parts though in it, and the ending was pretty funny and a bit scary to. Good quick thinking on Edge's part by the way at the finish. John Cena does win the match of course though because CENA ALWAYS WINS!!! Overall: 5 out of 10

MAIN EVENT: RANDY ORTON vs. TRIPLE H

This match was hyped way beyond what I thought. The hype actually began right after the Royal Rumble if I remember, which is why it fell EXTREMELY short of my expectations. The match overall was so much slower than I expected and proves how much of the WWE is just entertainment. I was expecting Triple H's character to beat Randy Orton badly. Instead it was more of a typical wrestling match. The ref gets knock down during the match and Triple H does use a sledgehammer, but other then that there was no blood which should of been done in the match, there were barely any weapons which should of been used in the match after the ref got knocked out, and there wasn't a lot of action. Triple H does win a very boring main event in my mind. Overall: 3 out of 10

The dvd bonus features by the way are absolutely terrible. The lack of effort the wwe put in to the special features on this dvd is horrendous. The only features are a dark match before the ppv, the usual 3rd HOF induction disc, and the highlights of Wrestlemanias 1-24. You may think the highlights are excellent and well done. Well unfortunately a lot of people are in for a rude awakening. The highlights are basically just about 2 minutes long which is terrible since there are so many great moments to highlight and they only talk about one of the matches from t he whole entire PPV.

Overall this DVD was extremely bad, and that's bad because it's WRESTLEMANIA, so it should of been great. The only reason why I give this three though was because of the Michaels vs Taker match. Trust me it was that good. Although if you can find that match without buying the dvd... GET IT. Other then that match the PPV sucked. DVD Overall: 3.5 out of 10",1243468800,,5525,4.236692015209125

Take the Kid Rock performance for example. It was cut out. I'm not a Rock fan, but editing him out skimmed the diva match. By the time you see something they're already in the action. There's no mention of who's even in.. That dropped the rating to a 4 for me being a lil slopy.

3781707,3,B001RXDM3G,"Paul Rudoff's review said many of my thoughts but I figured i'd add my own two cents into the mix. I use to be a wrestling fan but now im just bored to death with WWE. I only get Raw and ECW but i've always prefered the Smackdown brand over Raw. Now with Vickie Guerrero as the GM of Raw, I rarely ever tune in to watch it. WWE can rarely build a PPV event like they use too and the champions are usually always the same, with wrestlers like Jeff Hardy and CM Punk getting short title reigns. I hesitated getting this event but I eventually purchased it and here is my thought on a lackluster event

Money in The Bank with CM Punk, Christian, MVP, Mark Henry, Shelton Benjamin, Kane, Kofi Kingston and Finlay- Yes, this match is usually always good. However, you can lose track of who is wrestling with wrestlers come in and out of the match. Two points-Christian or his opponent should practice hitting the killswitch off the top rope, it would be cool but he has yet to hit it successfully. Point Two is they should just rename this match Yes, Shelton Benjamin is still with WWE. Every year Benjamin is the MVP (no the wrestler) or the match and he never wins. Maybe it'll become a storyline but I highly doubt it. CM Punk wins it and he is now getting buried on Smackdown.

Kid Rock replaces Miz/Morrison VS Colons match up. Yes, a tag team match that had a good build up got replaced by a Kid Rock concert. What the hell? They should have aired a video of great tag teams thru the years and had the bell ring ten times. Morbid but WWE just killed off tag team wrestling within the company.

As Rock sung, the women came to the ring. Many former divas returned but no one could tell and probably no one cared. This was a waste of time and poorly executed. Santina makes his debut and wins this poor match.

Chris Jericho VS Jimmy Snuka, Rowdy Roddy Piper, and Ricky Steamboat with Ric Flair and Mickey Rourke at ring side: I was happy with Steamboat and he can still wrestle. The problem was WWE needs a new crop of legends because its always the same people. I see Mike Rotundo (IRS) look in good shape and he could have been used for a one time event. Rourke knocks out Jericho with a punch after the match.

Jeff Hardy VS Matt Hardy in an Extreme Rules match: A pretty good match up with the same old story. I prefer Owen VS Bret and I think everyone would agree but they did have a good match.

Intercontinental Champion JBL VS Rey Mysterio: I remember Regal said he'd bring honor back to the Intercontinental title but that idea was quickly squashed. Speaking of squash, that is what this match was. Mysterio wins in twenty five seconds or less and sends JBL into retirement.

HBK VS Undertaker: WWE Shop Zone released a shirt proclaiming Undertaker's victory a week before this match happened. No one thought Taker would lose but it was the only reason why you'd want to watch this event. A classic match from two legends near the end of there careers. The dive over the top rope was scary but i'm glad Taker was ok. A must see match up.

Edge VS Big Show VS John Cena: The big problem with the WWE lays within this match. Edge and Cena have won or exchanged world titles for the past few years and its getting really boring. Edge acts like the worlds biggest jerk but you watch a WWE home video and he is the nicest guy. Edge has won more world titles in three or four years then Steve Austin, Hulk Hogan, Bruno Sammartino, Randy Savage, and The Rock to name a few legends. Granted, Hogan and Sammartino held the title for years but its unbelivable to think of it. He is closing in on Triple H for most title reigns and i'm surprised WWE has not brought this fact up. Wrestlemania main event next year perhaps? Edge VS Triple H for the world title-it could happen. Edge's title reigns are becoming a joke with alot of wins coming out of being the right place at the right time or being the general managers boy toy. I cannot respect Edge's title wins and he'll never stack up to the legends I noted earlier. Cena cannot wrestle very well but he seems to always hold the world title. This two men ruin wrestling when they hold a world title but ratings take a dip if someone else holds the belt. Its a lose, lose situaion and shows wrestling fans don't know what they want.

Triple H VS Randy Orton: I remember the story going into the main event and this match was disappointing. It was boring and I really didn't care to watch the whole match.

The only real stand out match was 'Taker-HBK, which will probably be on anther dvd set sooner or later. I have all WrestleMania dvds and its the only reason why I purchased this dvd. Not the best place to start if your just a casual fan.",1243036800,2,4693,4.3106575963718825
3781708,2,B001RXDM3G,"For it being the ""silver"" anniversary of Wrestlmania, it was an utter disappointment. First off, it wasn't the 25th anniversary. Second, the matches were very lackluster. The MIB match was exciting, and I was happy to see CM Punk win.

On the PPV Kid Rock performed. I enjoy Kid Rock and was looking forward to seeing it on the DVD. To my surprise it was edited out. WTF?? If they can put in some has-been or never-was sing the national anthem on the DVD why not that?

The women's match did not live up the the hype. All the wrestling websites were promoting about how all these past ""divas"" were showing up for it, and there were no introductions, and the match itself sucked. Women matches are either hot or cold. And this one was freezing.

The only thing good about the next match was Ricky Steamboat. I've been watching wrestling for 25 years, and I'm a huge mark for the legends, but it was pathetic to see Snuka and Piper staggering around the ring.

The Hardy match was good. Was surprised to see Matt go over on Jeff, but it is what it is.

JBL vs Mysterio? did this match even happen? What was the point. They should have been given the night off for the BS that was done with them.

Taker vs HBK was the best match of the night. Period. Don't have to write anything else about that.

Triple Threat match was pretty good. I like all three combatants, but it just lacked something. The whole thing with Vickie Guerrero is embarrasing. Eddie must be rolling over in his low rider.

The HHH/Orton match was the biggest disappointment of the night. For all the hype leading up to it, it was short, and not very exciting. Both men get their finishers off in the first 15 seconds of the match? What's up with that? It's called a finisher for a reason.

Now on to the 2009 HOF Ceremony.
I enjoyed seeing the Funks, Von Erich, and the Fink. But Koko B Ware? Are you kidding me? Why not induct HL Topper, or Tugboat. That was ridiculous. It was like they needed one more person and just threw the worst gimmicks in a hat and chose one. It was cool to see Flair induct Steamboat and Vince induct Stone Cold. Wish Stone Cold spoke longer. They let Watts ramble on like a senile old man but Austin made a comment that they were winding him down on the speach. Gee the most hated promoter and a wrestler from the 60's can talk as long as he wants, but the biggest name in wrestling gets a few minutes?

All in all the PPV and DVD was kinda disappointing. I thought Vince would have put together a better show.",1243036800,,2507,4.314893617021276
3781709,4,B001RXDM3G,"Let me start off by saying that I was at WrestleMania 25 ($255 seats) cause it was in my hometown of Houston, Texas. I also was at WrestleMania 17 too!

I bought the WrestleMania 25 (Blu-ray) so here's my mini review:

Pro:
1. The entire 4 hour event is all on one disc instead of 1 1/2 on DVD.

2. The entire WWE Hall of Fame 2009 event (running at 2 1/2 HRS) is there.

3. The WWE/HD is alright. It's the first time I see the WWE in HD so it was fine. The max resolution for HD output is 1080i. Why not 1080p WWE?

4. Undertaker / HBK is still the freakin' best match to watch in HD.

Cons:
1. I don't know if it bothers anyone but the WWE got rid of the entire Kid Rock concert on the disc.

2. When the Divas Battle Royal started, Kid Rock was playing them to the ring but instead WWE Home Video skips all that and quickly cuts to the Battle Royal in progress. I guess Kid Rock wanted $$$ for his appearance on video too.

3. When the WrestleMania 25 video intro starts, they completely removed the Army National Guard sponsoring and logo too.

4. After the pyro to start the show was over, they removed Michael Cole's comment when they focused on the briefcase in the air where he states, ""And that briefcase should be made of gold........."" Very odd? I guess he screwed up to start the show.

5. The features on this Blu-ray set are very weak. Sure they have the entire WWE Hall of Fame 2009, but to only contain the Tag Team title match and the 2-3 minute WrestleMania rewind videos for WrestleMania's 1-24 is not what I call extras. So no videos on how the participants of the MITB got to where they are, no WrestleMania 25 promo / commercial videos pumping you up for the HHH/Orton match or others like Hardy/Hardy, NOTHING!!!",1242777600,,1735,4.214501510574018

--------------------------------------------------

(This review was written on April 6, 2009, the day after the live Wrestlemania 25 event took place.)

I have been a WWE fan for over 25 years.  I've seen every Wrestlemania, been to three of them ""live"" (via closed circuit television in the arena in the late 1980s - before pay-per-view existed), and have ordered every single one on pay-per-view for the past 15 years.  I have enjoyed each and every one that I've seen...until last night's 25th event.

For starters, it annoys me to no end that WWE kept promoting the event as the 25th anniversary.  It was the 24th anniversary, not the 25th.  The first Wrestlemania took place 24 years ago in 1985, not 25 years ago in 1984.  Putting that aside, going into the event it looked like it was going to be a great show.  The first sign of trouble was the night before Wrestlemania at the Hall of Fame ceremony.  The televised portion of the ceremony was like one big ad for the  Wrestlemania event and the Legends of Wrestlemania video game.  WWE even had Jerry Lawler stop the awards show to present a clip from the game featuring Shawn Michaels and The Undertaker.  This is supposed to be a prestigious event, not another opportunity to shill WWE's wares.

While I'm on the subject of the Hall of Fame ceremony, WWE needs to start showing the entire ceremony live and unedited on television, like the Academy Awards and every other major awards show does every year.  There's no need to show part of it live online and tape the rest, only to show it edited a few hours later on television.  It's not like the USA Network has anything more important to show.  All they played last Saturday night were 5-10 year old movies that they've shown numerous times before.

Anyway, getting back to Wrestlemania 25...Things started off fairly well.  Although I thought Nicole Scherzinger's performance of ""America The Beautiful"" was rather lackluster, it served its purpose nicely and was well done overall.  The Money in the Bank ladder match was also very enjoyable, even though Christian should have been awarded the prize instead of C.M. Punk.

Then came the first of the event's many downfalls: Kid Rock.  What the heck was he doing there?  Nobody goes to Wrestlemania to see Kid Rock.  If, like Motorhead or POD, he was there to perform a superstar's theme music, that would be fine.  Instead he performed a 10-minute medley of his ""greatest hits"", concluding with his latest single - which an on-screen graphic was kind enough to let us know is available on his latest album.  Geez, even the video game shilling on the Hall of Fame ceremony the night before wasn't this much of a time waster.

Kid Rock segued right into the event's second downfall: the 25 ""woman"" Diva Battle Royal to crown the first ever Miss Wrestlemania.  It started off bad, continued to be bad, and ended bad.  Why weren't any of the Divas given introductions so we'd know who they all are?  Yes, I know WWE were trying to hide the fact that they had a man in drag (Santino Marella) in the match, but why bring back all these women from years past and give them absolutely no attention whatsoever?  Sunny was in the match, but there was hardly a mention of her, and she was only fleetingly seen on screen.  The same for the other past Divas - Molly Holly, Jackie Gayda, Joy Giovanni, and Torrie Wilson - some of whom were only mentioned when they went sailing over the top rope.  Victoria was the only past Diva who got any bit of screen time, and it was just a brief few seconds.  Having no introductions also hurts the current Divas, as it gives them no way to stand out from each other.  Looking at all 25 women in the ring, without knowing who is who, it ends up being just a sea of generic blondes and brunettes.

It's absolutely ridiculous that the women, some of whom can really work, were given one worthless spot on the card, and a man in drag walks away with the victory.  That says a lot about what WWE thinks of its women's division.  But WWE didn't just insult the Divas, WWE also insulted the audience by NOT having ""Santina"" be revealed to be a man in drag.  The fact that WWE had neither the women in the ring NOR the commentators notice that there was a man in there was absolutely moronic.  It was completely obvious to anyone watching, yet the announcers (of course) didn't notice that he was even there until the match was almost over, and none of the Divas even touched or attacked him throughout the match.  After he tossed out his girlfriend Beth Phoenix, why not have her go back into the ring and pull his wig off, and then kick his butt?  That would have been a somewhat respectable way to salvage this debacle.  Instead WWE continued on as if ""Santina"" were a real woman.  This match was clearly the Wrestlecrap Match of the Night.  That's not something WWE should be proud of.

The Chris Jericho vs. the Legends match started and ended with great disappointment.  Roddy Piper was good, Jimmy Snuka was sad to see (he can hardly walk), but once Ricky Steamboat and Jericho were left to go at it one-on-one it was AMAZING!  That part of the match was one of the few highlights of the whole night.  Then it got really disappointing.  Much ado was made of Ric Flair and Mickey Rourke, but they did little to nothing to affect the match.  A run in or some interference during the match would be been appropriate (Flair briefly ran in and was quickly taken care of so that negated his presence at ringside).

After the match was over, THEN Rourke is brought into the spotlight, having been called out by Jericho.  After an eternity of making his way into the ring, Rourke gets in two punches and Jericho is left holding his head.  I know that the WWE likes to put celebrities over at Wrestlemania, but that just looked bad for both Jericho AND Rourke, and it was so anti-climatic for the audience.  I suppose, looking back, there wasn't much more that he could have done, but WWE could have handled it with more excitement than THAT.  Flair and Rourke might as well not have bothered to show up since they did nothing of importance.

The Matt Hardy vs. Jeff Hardy match was another one of the event's highlights, so there's really nothing bad to say about it.  Well, other than the fact that for an ""Extreme Rules"" match, there sure was a distinct lack of blood (save for a small cut on Matt's head).

The Rey Mysterio vs. John Bradshaw Layfield match was barely that.  From bell to bell it ran a mere 21 seconds.  The match was a disgrace to all the great Intercontinental matches in Wrestlemania history.  I didn't pay almost sixty dollars to see an event with a match that didn't even last half a minute - especially when both wrestlers are capable of putting on an enjoyable and much longer match.

Next up was the Shawn Michaels vs. The Undertaker match.  An absolute classic that was damn near perfect.  If anything it could have been a tiny bit shorter - there were too many near falls for my liking - but that's a very minor quibble.  This was the last match of the night for which I truly felt like I was getting *some* of my money's worth.

The first title match of the televised event was next, and it's the Triple Threat featuring John Cena vs. Edge vs. Big Show for the World Heavyweight Championship.  I'd ask why there needs to be a Triple Threat at every Wrestlemania, but that's irrelevant.  The whole match just felt like The John Cena Show to me.  It was lame and predictable.  WWE even had the same exact spot in the match that they had on free TV a few weeks ago: Vickie Guerrero on the ring apron, Cena runs at her but stops, steps aside, and Edge spears her off the apron.  The Big Show never won a singles title at Wrestlemania.  He's long overdue.  Instead WWE gives us the same old, same old.  Yawn.

The Hall of Fame Class of 2009 come out next and get the bows they deserve.  Stone Cold Steve Austin then drives around the ring in his ATV and has a farewell beer bash.  This was all well and good, but the fact that Kid Rock got more screen time than the Hall of Fame class is complete BS.

Then we have the final match of the evening: Randy Orton vs. Triple H for the WWE Championship.  I was actually looking forward to this match because their feud was intense, and it could have been a big payoff.  But WWE ruined it by getting awfully strict with the rules.  When you have a feud where both men attacked each other in the most vicious and brutal ways, and each one of them is just waiting to get his hands around the throat of the other, you don't set up a match where the rules of disqualification are stricter than ever.  Because of that, there was no twist, no interference (by either Legacy or the McMahons), no nothing.  It was lame, tame, and ordinary.  The build up was better than the match.  Besides that, it had NOTHING to do with the title. This was a personal grudge match, not a championship match, not a pay-per-view main event, and sure as heck not a Wrestlemania main event, let alone the main event of this big landmark ""25th anniversary"" Wrestlemania. THIS is the match that should have had Extreme Rules, THIS is the match where they should have been beating the ever loving crap out of each other.

Wait a minute!  That was the last match?  When I ordered the event, one of the matches I was most looking forward to was the Champions vs. Champions Tag Team Title Match featuring Carlito & Primo vs. Miz & Morrison.  But where is it?  As I would find out the next day on WWE.com, the match did indeed take place at Wrestlemania - just not as part of the televised event.  WWE shunted the match to the non-televised pre-show.  A match for the freaking Tag Team TITLES was not worthy of being shown on television?  It was not only a title match, but one in which the titles would be UNIFIED! Surely that's something important? Surely that's worth showing live on the air instead of a 10-minute Kid Rock concert or a joke of a Divas Battle Royal?  The tag team match was thrown off the show so that Kid Rock could sing?!?  Ummm...does WWE realize that the event is called WRESTLEmania, right?  I paid to see wrestling, not a concert!

Here's the thing I just don't understand. It's a scripted show, WWE knows they only have four hours in which to fit everything in, so why doesn't WWE plan it out better?  Set time limits for each match and segment so that everything can be shown, and nothing feels rushed.

Outside of two or three matches (none of which were for titles), this did not feel like Wrestlemania.  Had this been No Way Out or Backlash, the card would have been fine and I probably wouldn't feel as negatively as I do about the fiasco.  But it was Wrestlemania, it was the grandest stage of them all, and the WWE sorely disappointed.  To make a big deal out of the ""25th anniversary"" and then put forth what I, and millions of others, watched Sunday night was almost atrocious.",1242777600,6,11535,4.586999022482893

This wasn't the greatest Wrestlemania, but it wasn't the worst. Shawn Michaels/Undertaker stole the show, but what i want everyone to watch is the Unified Tag Team Match between The Miz & Morrison/ The Colons. Man, this match shouldve been on the main card. To me its the second best match out of wrestlemania.",1242172800,,468,4.719512195121951
3781712,4,B001RXDM3G,"I was there live, yes live in Houston, Texas, live infront of 72,000 fans.

To sum it up, it didn't feel to much like a WrestleMania, it felt more like Survivor Series or maybe a more hyped up Royal Rumble. Maybe it was the match quality or the actual matches.

I enjoyed everything about WM 25 otherwise. John Cena's entrance was great as usual, and WWE please....please keep Big Show out of main events. Seeing Austin live was something good, and Shawn Micheals Vs UnderTaker was possibly the greatest match of all time.
Randy Orton vs HHH was possibly the most boring match that I have ever experienced, even the crowd was dead.

The quality of HD on the Blu Ray disc is ok, not 1080p, but definitely better than 480i or anything televised, plus you also get the HOF on Blu Ray, kinda boring to watch, it's one of those things that you gotta watch live to enjoy.

3781713,4,B001RXDM3G,"Wrestlemania is supposed to be the premiere show of the WWE and it usually does deliver some of the most exciting and talked about matches of the year.  This year should have been one the top ten Wrestlemania's but unfortunately due to time constraints and bad booking the show was far from one of the greatest.  Shawn Michaels and Undertaker should have closed the show.  Most wrestling fans only bought the pay per view so they could see this match live.  Both men are from Texas and they are both legends and no other match was going to be able to top it.  Whoever made the decision to not have this match at the end of the show should take a huge pay cut or should be spanked with a paddle so they learn their lesson. Also, we were promised a tag team title unification match on the pay per view and it was moved to a dark match and it wasn't even seen live!  The diva battle royal should have been the dark match.  Tag team matches are some of the best matches around and if Vince Mcmahon would get his head out of his billionaire anus then maybe he would realize that. I could keep talking but I will go match by match and explain myself in better detail.

Dark Match--WWE and World Tag team title unification match
WWE Tag Team Champions Carlito and Primo Colon versus World Tag Team Champions The Miz and John Morrison

I have not seen this match so I can't rate on how good of a wrestling match it actually was although I have heard that even though it was short it was excellent.  The Miz and Morrison in my opinion are one of the best tag team's in wrestling right now.  The Colons are very good and it's good to see them using Carlito because he is a wonderful talent.  The Colons unfortunately are overlooked because they never had any competition on Smackdown.  I am still disappointed that they didn't develop a rivalry with the Major brothers (they won the titles from them) because they could have had some wonderful tag matches.  The Miz and Morrison are a pretty well established tag team which is unusual since Vince doesn't understand what tag team wrestling can be.  This match should have been on the card, but it is what it is.  I am curious on what they do with the whole 'unified' tag team title situation and who the Colons will defend against since Miz and Morrison are broken up because of the Draft.  Match rating--N/A

Winners and New Unified Tag team Champions--The Colons

Money in the Bank Ladder Match
CM Punk vs Kane vs Mark Henry vs Christian vs MVP vs Shelton Benjamin vs Finlay vs Kofi Kingston

I remember seeing the first Money in the Bank at Wrestlemania 21 and was amazed at the match itself.  I am still happy that this match has become a major part of the last few Wrestlemania's.  The match itself didn't disappoint.  It was a wonderful way to open the show as it always is because it always pumps the crowd up for the remainder of the night.  I these matches were longer than fifteen minutes but I understand why it is kept short because any longer and the match itself would become boring.  Kofi Kingston was the main star in this match as he did certain moves with the ladder that hasn't been seen in a Money in the Bank.  Everybody had their moments as the always do in Money in the Bank.  I still wish Christian had won the match.  I love CM Punk and if anybody had to win I'm glad it was him (even though the Texans were not very happy about it) but this could have been the start of Christian's push.  I hope other people noticed what I noticed.  I also hope that Vince noticed what I noticed when it came to Christian.  Christian got the loudest ovation in the match.  Most of the crowd was rooting for him and were disappointed when he didn't win.  It makes no sense to bring him back and not use him.  I know that the plans with him were leaked at the Royal Rumble and they had to be changed but if you give the briefcase to Christian he could have a huge run with Edge on Smackdown for the World Title.  Does anybody else agree that that would be a definite money maker?  Although I would like it if it was CM Punk versus Edge.  I have been waiting for that for a year.  Match rating--4/5

Winner of Money in the Bank for the second year in a row--CM Punk

Kid Rock then performs what seemed like 200 songs and it took forever.  The Texas could have cared less because, and this is shocking, they were there for WRESTLING, not a damn rock/country concert.  I felt bad for the Kid because he was doing his best but the crowd just didn't care.

25 diva battle royal to crown ""Miss Wrestlemania""

This should have been the dark match.  I don't blame the women in this match.  I actually feel horrible for them because their Wrestlemania moment was taken away from them because of bad booking.  Even the special entrants didn't have the entrances they deserved.  Actually, none of the women got their entrances and the match started before anybody knew what was going on.  The stuff with Santino was hilarious, and I am a huge fan of his comedic talents, but I thought it was a slap in the face that a MAN won the DIVA battle royal.  It looks like Vince doesn't understand woman's wrestling either.  Match rating--1/5

Winner--""Santina Marella""

Handicap Elimination match
Chris Jericho versus Ricky Steamboat/Roddy Piper/Jimmy Snuka with Ric Flair

The build up to this match was very well done, and that was mostly because Chris Jericho is the best interview in the WWE today.  I really didn't give a turd about the match until it came down the Steamboat and Jericho.  They put on the most exciting few minutes of the night in my opinion.  I couldn't believe how good Steamboat still is, but that's why is a legend and now a Hall of Famer.  I hated Mickey Rourke punching out Jericho and that moment ruined almost the whole match for me, but seeing Steamboat in the ring one more time on the grandest stage of them all will stay with me for a long time and nothing will ruin that.  Match Rating--3/5

Winner--Chris Jericho

Extreme Rules Match
Jeff Hardy versus Matt Hardy

Now, I know that the original plans for this match was Christian vs Jeff Hardy.  I also know that those plans were leaked online, and I understood why they changed it to Jeff vs Matt.  Although Vince doesn't understand something.  Even though people knew at the Royal Rumble that Christian was going to cost Jeff the WWE title, it still would have been a shocking crowd pleaser.  Now Christian and Jeff could have had a good wrestling match, and it would have been more shocking for Matt to turn on Jeff at Wrestlemania and they could have had a great run together through Summerslam but it is what it is.  Matt and Jeff put on a good spotfest here but they should have been given a lot more time because this was a personal match.  The ending was well done, although it felt rushed.  Also the right guy won as he needed the win more.  I don't like the way this rivalry has been handled but at least two brothers got to have a match at Wrestlemania together.  I hope though that they make this rivalry what it's supposed to be but knowing Vince that won't happen and what should have been a historic match and series of matches will be forgotten in a few months.  Match rating--3/5

Winner--Matt Hardy

Intercontinental Title Match
I.C. Champion JBL versus Rey Mysterio

What a waste of a title match.  The Intercontinental title hasn't been defended at Wrestlemania since Lincoln was president and instead of getting at least an average match we get a quick and useless match.  Maybe this should have been the dark match.  JBL for weeks kept saying he was going to make history, and he kept that promise. For the record I am happy that Rey has won a big title like the I.C. title. JBL quits at the end and his home state cheers his departure.  JBL makes history and that's what this match now is....history.  Match rating--1/5

Winner and New I.C. Champion--Rey Mysterio

Legend versus Legend
Shawn Michaels versus Undertaker

The only reason why I wanted to see this ppv live was for this match.  Now nobody can act like they thought Undertaker's streak would be broken but we knew that we would get a half hour Wrestlemania classic and that is what we got.  There were a few slow spots because of a sick fall where Undertaker fell right on his head and when Shawn fell straight on his back.  Even with a few flaws the match delivered the way it was supposed and will probably win Shawn his one hundredth match of the year award (which he always deserves).  The crowd loved this match and so did I.  The last ten minutes were amazing.  This was the match of the night but that shouldn't surprise anybody.  Match rating--5/5

Winner--Undertaker

Triple threat Match for the World Heavyweight Championship
Champion Edge versus John Cena versus The Big Show

The build up to this match was horrible but it was entertaining.  I was actually looking forward to see John Cena and Edge go for the title on the biggest pay per view of the year but I guess they thought they audience had seen enough of that so they added the Big Show.  The match itself was surprisingly good even though it felt too rehearsed, and yes I know that they rehearse matches but classic matches don't look rehearsed at all.  For some reason there is now a triple threat match at almost every Wrestlemania now, but there is nothing wrong with that.  They are fun matches and this one is no exception.  I don't agree with Cena winning, I actually thought that the Big Show should have won, but I understand that they were trying to have the fallen champion get his belt back.  I actually like Cena, but just not as champion.  I liked him as champion at one point but I prefer him chasing the belt than him wearing it.  I also wish they would give Edge a longer title reign, he deserves one.  Match rating--3/5

Winner and new World Champion--John Cena

WWE Championship Match
Champion Triple H versus Randy Orton

This match deserved to be the main event, but once the match happened I no longer felt that way.  The build up to this match was amazing, and one of the best creative things that WWE has done in forever.  I would have loved this match more if Orton had won the title.  He should have won the title.  They built him up and built him up and he didn't win.  It was a wasted opportunity.  Wrestlemania should have been the real start of the Age of Orton.  He is the best in the WWE right now, and god forbid that they take the belt off Triple H.  Now I am a fan of Triple H but with him as champion the WWE is not going to get out of the funk that they have been in.  Also, why was there no interference from the Mcmahon family or Legacy?  This match should have been similar to the Main event of Wrestlemania X-7 between Stone Cold and The Rock.  The match was no disqualification and although it wasn't a wrestling masterpiece it was still one of the most exciting title matches in Wrestlemania history.  This one should have been as well, but it wasn't.  The crowd was completely dead and this did not feel like a Wrestlemania Main Event at all.  It should have if the match was done right.  This could have easily followed Undertaker/Shawn Michaels if there was a No Dq rule and interference.  This match was a huge disappointment and they will probably make it right in the coming months but I'm sick and tired of WWE always having to have the better matches at other pay per views when it should have happened at Wrestlemania.  Match rating--2/5

Winner and still WWE Champion--Triple H

This Wrestlemania was a lot better than last year's edition but not by a lot.  I am not trying to preach that I know more than the people who run the WWE but they need to start listening to the fans a lot more.  I feel at times that I could book better shows and I should never feel like that.  Luckily for them TNA is doing worse than they are otherwise I would switch to them and leave WWE behind.  I the whole WWE company would wake up and realize what they are doing wrong, but at the same time nobody what they do right, somebody out there will think it was wrong.  So I guess it's a no win situation.  I do suggest getting this pay per view because you will still enjoy it, but there are to many misses at this event, even with the tremendous hits that took place.",1240185600,,12272,4.396888888888889
3781714,4,B001RXDM3G,"I actually live in Houston and have been a bigtime WWE Fan for 5-6 years. This being my first WWE Live Event was Way different than i expected. This was a great experience but rather suprising and unpredictable WrestleMania, for the 25th anniversary.

Money in the Bank Ladder Match
This was a great opener and one of the best matches of the night. This match had several spots that had me and my two friends jumping out of my chair. The crowd was really into this one. Everything about the match was great except the winner. Freakin Cm Punk won AGAIN. I was happy when he won last year but this year live at WM was a little redundant. Otherwise it was great money in the bank match. 8/10

Miss WrestleMania Battle Royal
WTF? Okay first Kid Rock had his time in which unexpectly being with the rest of the crowd wasn't that much into it. For the match itself it basically for laughs seeing Santino in drag. Who cared about 25 old and new divas trying to act, Santina Marella owned this match and actually WON!!! 3/10

3-on-1 Handicap Legends Elimination Match
Now being a big Chris Jericho fan I really wasn't the best fan of this storyline. But the match itself proved one thing, Ricky Steamboat needs to make a return. Now Snuka and Piper got eliminated pretty fast, which made me a little nervous that this main event was going to be a time-filler. But Ricky Stemboat and Chris Jericho ended up putting on a classic mini match that the whole crowd was into. Of course Jericho won and gave Flair a SICK codebreaker. Then Mickey Rouke came and everyone in the crowd including myself was anxious to see what to happen. But Rourke basically mildly punched Jericho which actually looked botched where i was sitting. Overall it was what it was expected to be. 6/10

Extreme Rules
Brother vs Brother
I was REALLY anticipating this match being a long time fan of both Hardyz.
There was an enormous storyline here and it was cool to see Matt's new uniform live. The match itself was rather bizarre. Don't get me wrong as usual both Hardyz had some extreme spots, but the match felt rushed. And the shocking ending was what really got me out of my seat. But i heard for sure that this was way better than the Vengeance 2001 encounter. Overall good, but felt way too rushed. 7/10

Intercontenintal Championship Match
This is the BEST Time-filler I've ever seen. Rey Mysterio as the Mini-Joker came out and whooped JBL's butt in 21 seconds. And on top, JBL quit. One of the memorable moments of the night came when I and my two friends got to see the goodbye song. Overall this was a great way to get us pumped for the next match. 8/10

Best Match EVER
Now I've always loved Undertaker and Shawn Michaels and seeing them live was mind-blowing. But seeing this 30 minute epic was way past any words i could think of. This match brought me back to Rock vs Austin at WM 17 and Michaels vs Angle WM 21. Except, that this match was better. It Was the Best Match in Wrestling History. Absolutely AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!! Both of these men have earned my respect more than any other WWE Superstar. I cant remember a time i jumped out of my seat screaming for 30 minutes straight. Although i rooted for HBK, who cares. This is was what i paid 255 dollars to see. 10/10

World Heavyweight Championship Triple Threat Match
Now after seeing the greatest wrestling match of all time we knew this match wouldn't come within a 5k of being better, but this definitely went above and beyond my expectations. I especially liked actually being there live singing John Cena's Basic Thuganomics as it played. Despite the Big Show this match was a solid fast-paced match overshadowing last year's boring triple threat. All three men had good effort. But of course the crowd fav John Cena wins back the title and had his little celebration with the fireworks coming out. It was another little surprise and definitely better than the disaster of the night that was to follow. 7/10

WWE Championship Match/WrestleMania 25 Main Event
After seeing the greatest wrestling match ever, John Cena parade around with the World Title and Stone Cold's WrestleMania Beer Bash, being in the crowd we were pretty much dead. We knew Triple H and Randy Orton had to pull off something big especially with the one of the greatest storylines in WWE History and my personal Fav. If there was one other match that would beat Taker vs HBK it would be this. Being there live this match didn't even beat the Diva Battle Royal. Literally every single match on the card was good except the main event. WTF? We were dead in the crowd almost the whole frikkin match. Triple H and Randy Orton had to be drunk or high cause i cannot remember a letdown of this proportion. After all this hype for the main event. One pedigree and the match ends. After all these WM moments before we end the show on a very disturbing note. 6/10

Overall, combined with WWE Axxess before, I had the time of my life at this event. Anticipating this event for a long time, it really didn't letdown (especially Undertaker vs Shawn Michaels). The only travesty here was actually the most hyped match, the main event. Overall great show, dead main event. Overall this was a 7/10 and would've been even better if the main event hadn't failed.",1240012800,,5251,4.559915164369035
3781715,2,B001RXDM3G,"Considering this is labelled as the biggest event in the wrestling calendar, you would have thought the 25th anniversary would be the biggest yet. Considering the history this PPV has, you really would have thought they would go all out to try and create the biggest Wrestlemania to date, much like that tried to do with Wrestlemania 20. Like WM 20, this is a massive disappointment, but this seems like they haven't even bothered to try and make every match a memorable showcase. There were a few worthwhile matches, apart from one; however, the rest will pretty much disappear into the depths of my memory never to be conjured up again.

Match Listing:

C.M. Punk vs. Mark Henry vs. Kane vs. Finlay vs. Kofi Kingston vs. MVP vs. Shelton Benjamin vs. Christian - Money in the Bank Ladder Match.

Compared to the last few years, this really wasn't a stand out MITB match. Of course it was high spots galore, but one thing you must not do with a ladder match and that's have Mark Henry involved. Punk, Kingston, MVP, Benjamin & Christian all helped create the usual atmosphere & action that you would expect from a match of this kind, but Henry & Kane sought only to slow down the momentum. Finlay played his part and Hornswoggle got involved which was a delightful scene, much like last year. Kingston displayed some remarkable skill and bravery with his uses of the ladder, much like you would expect from Benjamin. Have to be honest and say I was disappointed Punk got the win as I was buying for Christian as a way of spitting in the face of TNA, but alas it was not meant to be.

7 / 10

25 Diva Battle Royale

The WWE, at times, has a real ability to promote their female wrestlers as just that; wrestlers. But they always really let me down in their promotion of women's matches in the case of Wrestlemania. The last great Diva match at a Wrestlemania event was Trish Stratus vs. Mickie James at Wrestlemania 22. In fact, that was about the best Diva match the WWE have had in years, which makes it even more saddening to see tripe like this destroy any credibility the Woman's division may have developed beforehand. It was good for the comedy with the involvement of ""Santina"" Marella, but other than that it was a genuinely throw away match as we all knew who was going to win.

2/10

Chris Jericho vs. Jimmy Snuka, Roddy Piper & Ricky Steamboat - 3 on 1 Handicap Match

I'm never usually a fan of these types of matches but this really was a surprisingly entertaining match and showcased the idea that Ricky ""The Dragon"" Steamboat still has a lot in him. Snuka & Piper did the usual, old wrestler struggling to beat the new guy, but when Snuka got in the ring he really worked toe to toe with Jericho and I would absolutely love to see Steamboat and Flair in the ring one more time. Anyway, Jericho did as predicted and won the match, but the real interesting bit was what happened afterwards. During the weeks leading up to Wrestlemania, Jericho was goading ""The Wrestler"" movie star, Mickey Rourke into a confrontation for this event. Mickey was in attendance and sure enough ended up in the ring with Jericho to knock his lights out. I was hoping to enjoy this more than I actually did and the crowd didn't seem much into it either.

4/10

Jeff Hardy vs. Matt Hardy - Extreme Rules

This is obviously the match to further quite a personal rivalry between the two brothers and putting them in the environment they're most comfortable, you knew this was going to be a good match. Although violent, it didn't reach the point where it involved blood. This was a match that didn't really need blood to get the point across and that is what really made this match work. We knew of their capabilities and most of us have been fond of their tag team matches, so we knew what was coming and we knew they would take the risks. Tables were broken, chairs were used and obviously ladders were brought in to end the match which could have meant Jeff breaking his spine. I was quite disappointed that Matt won, but this would have meant the rivalry could have continued for longer, which it seems to be doing.

6/10

Rey Mysterio Jr. vs. JBL - Intercontinental Match

Rey won in about 15 seconds and lead to JBL being so annoyed that he quit. Squash matches like this have no place at Wrestlemania. This sure was worth the Pay-Per-View price.

1/10

Undertaker vs. Shawn Michaels

These two men have a long history together in the ring and seeing the build up to this match was an excellent bit of nostalgia and this was really the match I was looking forward to the most. My anticipation was justified as this really was the show stealing match. The match is filled with emotion and intensity as there are constant near falls and just genuinely good wrestling. Thankfully, Taker wins at 17 - 0 continuing the streak with an amazing match.

10/10

John Cena vs. Big Show vs. Edge - World Championship

I didn't bother with this match as I utterly hate Cena and the fact that he won made me even angrier. I'm lead to believe that it was more entertaining that I was expecting so I may check it out based on what I've heard, but I'm still not holding any high hopes.

Randy Orton vs. Triple H - WWE Championship

The build up for this match was absolutely superb and really helped develop the Randy Orton character as sick and sadistic. It allowed for the revealing of Triple H being married into the McMahon family and cemented the newest stable Legacy, as a promising force in the WWE. The match was quite back and forth, but was cursed by the DQ stipulation as it would have been much more entertaining if it were no DQ. I wanted Orton to win this as although the build up was superb, it also damaged Orton's credibility in the sense of him getting beaten down quite easily by Vince & Shane McMahon individually, before using an illegal move to get the upper hand. If he were to have won cleanly, that would have really made the rivalry much more interesting and would have allowed for a more credible continuation of the feud.

7/10

This was overall quite a disappointing PPV especially for a Wrestlemania event and even more so considering the fact that it was celebrating 25 years. The crowd essentially ignored Stone Colds Hall of Fame celebration which was a surprise considering where he was. He got the initial glass smashing pop, but after that they just sat down and watched him drink beer. Compared to the Wrestlemania's of the past 5 years, this is definitely the weakest and Wrestlemania 20 itself was pretty poor. With only 2 really memorable and worthy matches, I would really say this isn't worth the price of the DVD.",1240012800,5,6634,4.517529215358931

Plus seeing Ricky in the ring brought back alot of great memories. Now the fans will get to see his son bring back those memories and make new ones with the Steamboat legacy continuing! The Undertaker and HBK (both over 40 yrs old) STOLE THE SHOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Everyone else on the card should have been taking notes on this classic!!!!!!!!!!",1239926400,,530,4.638297872340425
3781734,4,B001RXDM3G,"On April 5th I watched Wrestlemania 25 and after that I had some mixed reactions so I figured I will watch it again from online videos and things like that. Im watching it now while I make this review so its as accurate as possible but this time Im watching it with the Undertaker vs. Shawn Michaels match last because I believe that should have been the main event. Ok lets get started

Match #1 Money In The Bank Ladder Match #5: Shelton Benjamin vs Cm Punk vs. Mark Henry vs. Kane vs. MVP vs. Christian vs. Kofi Kingston vs. Finlay: This was a pretty good match but it could have been better. This match (as expected) was more of a spotfest than an actual match. The crowd was into Christian and Kofi Kingston was very impressive in this match as well as Shelton Benjamin. There was one time in the match where kane and henry were on the ladder at the same time. Great spots included sheltons dive off the ladder, cm punk and kofis dive to the outside, christians unprettier off the ladder and henrys worlds strongest slam on the ladder. Like i said it could have been better but not a bad match at all. However in my opinion the wrong man won. I give it a 8/10 Winner for the second year in a row: CM Punk

Match #2 Miss Wrestlemania 25 Diva Battle Royal: Not to much to say here excpet that Santino won as he was dressed up like a woman. I give it a 5/10 Winner: Santino Marella

Match #3 Chris Jericho vs. Ricky Steamboat, Jimmy Snuka, and Roddy Piper: I liked it how Jericho had to beat each guy individually. It made the match more interesting. Not much to say while piper and snuka were fighting jericho but once Ricky came in the match got alot better. Ricky Steamboat showed how well he could still wrestle even at the age of 55. It was interesting to see because Steamboat heavily influenced jericho on the way he wrestles. Snuka tapped out and Piper got pinned after the ensiguri. For a good five minutes Steamboat and jericho put on a great contest and in the end Jericho pinned steambot with the codebreaker and after the match did the same to flair. Rourke then comes in and knocks out Jericho which was a very badly done punch. I have two ratings for this match one for before steamboat came in and one for after he came in. Before 5/10 after 7.8/10 Winner Chris Jericho

Match #4 Matt Hardy vs. Jeff Hardy Extreme Rules Match: This match was pure entertainment and very violent. You could tell just by watching the match the pure hatred between the two brothers. Weapons used included a poster, trashcan, chair, dry vac, 2 tables, a kendo stick, a crutch, and two ladders. There were several extreme moments in this match and both men has their chance to shine. Somewhat of a cheap ending but I don't think it took much away from a great match. I give it a 9/10: Winner Matt Hardy

Match #5 Rey Mysterio vs JBl for the Intercontinental Championship: This match lasted 21 seconds with mysterio doin a few kicks the 619 and the splash. The aftermath included JBl quitting. I give it a 6/10 jus bc rey won and became intercontinental champ for the first time. Winner and new Intercontinental Champion Rey Mysterio

Now on the card the next match would be HBK vs Taker but im watching the world title and wwe title matches first.

Match #6 John Cena vs. Edge vs. The Big Show for The World Heavyweight Championship: This was an entertaining match to watch althought slow at times it eventually picked up. Im not sure why big show was in this match but i think it made a little better and it made it a triple threat as oppose to a singles match. Each competitor had a good showing as big show showed his dominance as usual. It was also interesting to see chavo and vicky get involved. A cool move by cena off the top rope as well as a spear to cena in mid air by edge. Edge took out big show in a huge way. A cool double team move to big show by cena and edge. Overall this was a pretty good match I give it a 8.5/10 Winner and new World Heavyweight Champion John Cena

Match #7 Randy Orton vs. Triple H for the WWE Chamipionship: This was a very personal match and you could tell by the way these two wrestled. Very hard hitting moves and you could tell that they were out to hurt eachother. It kicked off with both men hitting their finishers which was pretty cool. The match had a slow pace but it also told a great story. Great moves by both men and the highlights of the match were ortons backdrop to hhh on the table, ortons ddt off the announce table, triple h getting retribution and punting orton as well as hitting him with a sledgehammer. Alot of people including me expected intereference and i do admit it took something away from the match but not too much. It was good to see them settle their differences with no interference. Not so much of a wrestling match but still good. I give it a 8.9/10 Winner and still WWE Champion Triple H

Match #8 The Undertaker vs Shawn Michaels: One word CLASSIC This match was unbelievable and in my opinion is one of the greatest if not the greatest wrestlemania match of all time. Back and forth action where at one point when i first saw it i did not know if taker was gonna win. Kickouts, reversals, counters, great moves. It was a great match and match of the night i give it a 10/10 Winner and 17-0 at Wrestlemania The Undertaker

I would recommend getting this dvd when it comes because I think its worth the money. Best match= hbk/taker worst match= diva battle royal. Hopefully when the dvd comes out we can all see WHAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN ON THE CARD The Colons vs Miz & Morrison for the Unified Tag Team Titles",1239753600,,5581,4.326959847036329
3781735,4,B001RXDM3G,"Wrestlemania is the biggest event of the year for wrestling fans around the world. We have seen some great matches in Wrestlemania past such as Hogan/Andre(WM3), Hogan/Warrior(WM6) and so many others. So did this PPV live up to the hype or did it sink like the Titanic? Well I'll go down the list of matches match by match. So lets get started: (I'll be rating everything out of 5 stars)

Money in the Bank was the first match of the night, and while it wasn't the greatest Money in the bank it was still very enjoyable and as always included tons of crazy spots. My only gripe was even though I am a fan of CM Punk I would have liked to have seen Shelton or MVP win it also it could have been a tad bit longer. 4 out of 5

25 Diva Battle Royal was very bad. First of all the divas didn't have a proper entrance, they all just came out together while Kid Rock played. So, you didn't know who was all in the match except for a few divas here and there. I found out the next day that former WWE diva Joy Giovani was in it, but I would of never known that because well we were never told or she was never seen. So, that was a huge disappointment, as the match which could have been decent ended up being one giant mess. 1 out of 5

Jericho vs The Legends was ok, at first it was boring and slow and then when it came down to just Jericho and Steamboat it took off. Steamboat for being up there in years looks like he did years ago. He looks like he can still go and put on a good 20 min match. I hope at Backlash Jericho faces Steamboat in a one on one match. 3 out of 5

Jeff Hardy vs. Matt Hardy was better then I expected, I remember when these two guys feuded years ago and their matches weren't that good. Well this match was a lot better then I had thought but still could have been better then it was. The double table spots was cool as was the Jeff jumping over the ladder and missing Matt. The ending with the Twist of Fate using the chair was sick and was a great ending to this match. I doubt this feud is over so lets hope these two can continue to put on great matches. 3 out of 5

JBL (c) vs. Rey Mysterio for the IC title was a joke, literally maybe thats why Rey came out as the joker. I don't have much to say about this match as it was only 21 seconds long. So all im saying is it sucked. 1 out of 5 stars

The Undertaker vs. Shawn Michaels, OMG this match was great and I mean great. This should have been the main event. I t was so good it made the 2 world title matches look like crap compared to it and it made it hard to follow it up. The match is worth buying the event just for this match alone. The spot when Taker flew over the top rope and on to the camera man was sick as hell, I thought Taker and the cameraman were dead. The ending with both guys hitting their finishers and only getting a two count was awesome this match has to be Taker greatest Mania match ever and also one of the best matches we have seen in WWE in a while. 5 out 5

As for the last two matches, for the Edge (c) vs. John Cena vs. Big Show it was boring and I really can't remember all that happend in the match except for the spots where Cena picked up Big Show and Edge at the same time and Big SHow stuckn the ropes, and Cenas entrance with 300 Cena clones. Cena winning was predictable as Big Show has only won 1 Wrestlemania match in his life. 2 out 5

Triple H vs Randy Orton was a complete and total let down, they had this really good feud going and had it very personal with great segments leading up to the match. The match in no way lived up to its expectations and as I said thats the reason why the Taker/HBK match should have been last it was just too good to have any other match follow it up. The ending was dumb and nothing special really happened in this match. I thought we were going to have someone come down and possibly help Orton win and turn on HHH but nothing. 2.5 out of 5

Overall, it was pretty good, match of the night was Taker/HBK and while there were some matches that sucked, it was Mania and thats good enough for me. [...] I still enjoyed it and I'm still glad I ordered it. The DVD will be out on May 19, according to Amazon as its up for Pre-order, so I'll be picking it up and recommend that you do to.

3781736,4,B001RXDM3G,"Hate to be a nerd here but when your born or married or had a special occassion that you celebrate every year, the anniversary isn't when the event happened but every year afterwards so do the math, this is the 25th EDITION of WrestleMania but the quarter anniversary comes next year...but let's not let the facts get in the way of a good story.  A couple of notes for this WrestleMania is that Tazz left WWE earlier in the week when his contract expired & with there being no ECW match, the entire event was a 3 man announce team of Michael Cole, Jim Ross, and Jerry Lawler.  It should also be noted that a Unified Tag Team Championship match was advertised on the card with the WWE (SmackDown) Tag Champions of Carlito & Primo Colon vs. the World (RAW) Tag Team Champions of John Morrison & The Miz but at the last minute, they moved the match off the main card onto the DVD extra dark match.  It should also be noted that WWE went all the way to the four hour mark on this PPV & the lead singer from the pop group ""The Pussycat Dolls"" (don't remember her name & honestly, don't care) did the national anthem.  Now onto the matches...

Money In The Bank Match: C.M. Punk vs. Kofi Kingston vs. Christian vs. Finlay vs. Kane vs. Mark Henry - After the last couple of MITB ladder matches starting to become a little ""routine"" when it came to the spots, this one had the ladders used in ways we've never seen before in more unique ways.  Moments to look out for are the showcases of strength by Mark Henry & Kane, Christian clearly being the crowd favorite, Shelton Benjamin's leap off the ladder outside the ring, Hornswoggle & his ""ladder"", and the darkhorse (no pun intended) in Kofi Kingston being the human highlight reel of the match.  There were some botches for the stuff they were trying to pull off but overall, entertaining match & great way to kick off the show.

Right around here was a Kid Rock performance doing a medley of songs that lasted around 10 mins. that lost the crowd for a while that ended with the divas appearing for...

Ms. wrestleMania Battle Royal - ...this battle royal to crown Ms. WrestleMania featuring all the current WWE divas along with ones from the past like Sunny, Ms. Jackie (Tough Enough winner/Charlie Hass' wife), Victoria, Molly Holly and Torrie Wilson.  However, unless you went to WWE's website to look at the photo shoot earlier in the day (that Michael Cole had to plug), they decided not to give all of them introductions unlike how they've done at every battle royal in WrestleMania's past so you couldn't tell who was who (and neither could the announce team half the time) throughout most of the match since it was a huge cluster of blondes & brunettes until towards the end.  Unless your a fan of Santino Marella (or maybe even RuPaul), this was a skipable filler & complete waste of the appearences from the past divas.

Roddy Piper, Jimmy Snuka, Ricky Steamboat w/Ric Flair vs. Chris Jericho - This was a handicap elimination match in that Jericho has to beat all three men to win & Mickie Rourke from the movie ""The Wrestler"" was at ringside for this.  This match was about what you expect from Roddy Piper & Jimmy Snuka at this point in their careers but the real suprize of the night was Ricky Steamboat as this was his first real performance in almost 15 years and first WM match since '88 years eventhough he wasn't as quick, he looked like he didn't miss a step & still hit his classic spots & moves.  Other moments were Roddy Piper forgetting that this is a ""Rated PG"" show & everything with Rourke afterwards but it was the interaction between Steamboat & Jericho that was the main highlight of this match.

Extreme Rules Match: Jeff Hardy vs. Matt Hardy - As J.R. would point out on the commentary, how ironic is it that 5 years ago at WMXX it was the ""brothers"" of Kane & Taker that had a match while 15 years ago it was the Hart brothers of Bret & Owen who were fighting each other and now it's the battle of the Hardy brothers.  Various weapons like a shopvac (you read that right), a singapore cane, trash can, crutch, and of course...tables, ladders, and chairs were used as not only just weapons but to make moves more impactful like the side effect, legdrop and the sickest looking twist of fate I can remember seeing.  Unlike how their Vengeance '01 match was a trainwreck, this match lived up to the hype and the right guy who NEEDED the victory got it.

Intercontinental Champion J.B.L. vs. Rey Mysterio - Along with the fact that this was the first Intercontinental Title defence since WMX8, Michael Cole pointed out that this was Mysterio's first WM appearence since he won the World Title at WM22. Eventhough I'm a fan of Mysterio's unique WM outfits of comic book/movie characters, his costume this year as Heath Ledgers ""Joker"" came off like the time he tried to be the Silver Surfer from Fantastic Four.  Anyways, it took you just about as long to read everything I just said about Mysterio & the I.C. title at WrestleMania than it would to watch the match because this was a repeat of the ECW title match last year.

Mr. WrestleMania vs. The Streak: Shawn Michaels vs. Undertaker - This is one of those matches that I can try to describe & review but the words wouldn't do it justice.  This match had everything (including the enique ""Heaven & Hell"" entrances) on a physical & emotional level of both men refusing to lose to the point where this was the cloest anyone had ever come to breaking the streak to the point where you saw the most emotion from Undertaker since his ""Deadman"" character returned 5 years ago & Shawn was even so desperate at one point, he was hoping for a win via countout.  Instant classic here & quite frankly, this was the match that saved this show, should have ended it since nobody was going to be able to top it, and makes the DVD worth buying alone.

World Champion Edge vs. John Cena vs. Big Show - As usual, Cena had quite an entrance as it was an almost scary sight seeing that many John Cena's and I even joked with my friends saying that it was the ""Cena Clux Clan""...will the real Slim Shady please stand up?  All three men put in a good performance here with various highlights featured the Guerrero's getting involved & Big Show putting in a dominate performance along with doing a classic Andre The Giant spot at one moment.  This was one of those main events were it solid & had some fun moments that surpassed all the buildup going into it (thought the storyline was pretty weak myself) but it wasn't the best match each man has had against each other.

I had to make a note of this & point out that right around here was when they did the roll call for the Hall Of Famer before ""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin saluted the crowd the only way Stone Cold can for a memorable WrestleMania moment.

WWE Champion Triple H vs. Randy Orton - The stipulation for this match was that if Triple H got DQ'd or counted out, he would lose the title.  Now I'll admit from the start that eventhough I thought the storyline was very well done, I didn't care to see this match because they've fought so many times in so many different matches (I counted at least 8 times on television/PPV in the past 18 months including the WM Title match just last year...and that's not even counting all their previous feuds with DX/Rated RKO & the breakup of Evolution over the past few years) that a normal one on one match after all those matches are still fresh in people's heads didn't seem like a main event for what your hyping up as a landmark WrestleMania.

Anyways, the match tried to tell a good story as both men traded places with Orton being more of the ""cerberal assassin"" by being very calculating throughout the match while Triple H was more emotional & aggressive to the point where the referee had to keep reminding him various times that he'll lose his title if he gets disqualified as Triple H was constantly tempted to get revenge instead of a victory.  However the problem is that the match wasn't bad but it just didn't click on so many levels as the match started off quick with both men hitting their finishers in the first minute and then heavily slowed down afterwards to the point where the crowd died & only made noise for big moves unlike the previous two matches where they were into it from start to finish.  Also the whole ""champion loses the belt on DQ/countout"" rule wasn't played out well here unlike how it's been in the past (Luger/Flair from Starrcade '88, Angle/Lesnar from WMXIX, Rock/Benoit from Fully Loaded '00). For example, the referee kept stepping in whenever Triple H would just keep pounding on Orton & once even came close to hitting him with the monitor with the referee warn him about losing the title...only for these guys to bounce each other off the announce tables and fight on the outside for more than what would have been more than a 10 second countout with the referee just stepping back & not doing anything about it.  After all of that, the ending just made you go ""that's it?  After months of buildup, character development, and everyone who was involved in this from the McMahons to Legacy...that's it?""  This match heavily reminded me of Triple H/Jericho from WMX8 or HBK/Cena from WM23 in that the match wasn't bad/horrible but they've had better and it wasn't the best way to end the show.

Overall, this PPV had some flops (Kid Rock going on too long for my taste, battle royal, Mysterio/J.B.L., the Unified Tag Team match being moved to the dark match last minute, and everything surrounding the HHH/Orton match that I talked about). However this DVD will also contain the Hall Of Fame featuring Koko B. Ware (why?), The Funks, The Von Erichs, Bill Watts, The Fink, Ricky Steamboat, and Steve Austin that is always worth watching along with the highlight packages from previous WM's they showed for weeks & the Undisputed Tag Team Title match along with the Kid Rock performance being edited out of the show. So overall, this event was a stepdown from last year's event & ranks around 3 stars but I'll bump it up one more for the Hall Of Fame extra you'll get with it.  So I wouldn't recommend getting the $55+ encore replay (unless you really need to see that HBK/Taker match) but I would recommend waiting & get the DVD for half price with the bonus extras.",1239062400,,10317,4.504282655246253

3781738,4,B001RXDM3G,"As far as PPVs go, this was a real good show, but I can't say that it lived up to the standards of most wrestlemanias.  The crowd checked out for the most part after the Shawn Michaels vs. Undertaker match, because nothing could follow it, and crowd heat hurt the last two matches (not that they were great anyway).  However, wrestling wise it was a good show, and I would consider this DVD a must-buy just for the Michaels/Undertaker match alone, because it was one of the finest wwe matches I've ever seen.  Matches are rated out of 5 stars (*****).

1. Money-In-The-Bank Ladder Match
Kane vs. Mark Henry vs. CM Punk vs. Christian vs. Kofi Kingston vs. MVP vs. Shelton Benjamin

Not the best MITB, but a really good opener none-the-less that the crowd was really into.  There were your usual insane spots, along with a few missed ones, but they didn't hurt the match.  Definitely worth a look, this was the second best match of the show.  ***3/4

2. Miss WrestleMania 25 Divas Battle Royal

Utterly atrocious, and a complete waste of time.  Almost as bad as the Kid Rock segment which came before this match. Can someone exlpain to me why this was left on the show but a TAG TEAM TITLE UNIFICATION MATCH was left off??? Horrible.  There were several past divas in the match, but because they got no introduction, I didn't even see some of them and only found out later they were in it.  Santino wins, which was funny, but good lord this was unfathomably terrible. - **

3. Chris Jericho vs. Jimmy Snuka, Rowdy Roddy Piper, & Ricky Steamboat

This was not pretty early, and Piper and Snuka were both appallingly bad, but once they got eliminated and Steamboat got to work I was basically marking out.  Steamboat can still go, and even though his timing wasn't great and he missed a couple moves, he got the crowd into it with some near falls and made the match acceptable for me.  I enjoyed the Steamboat part of this match, but not much else.  **

Aftermath predictably saw Mickey Rourke and Jericho go at it, with Rourke coming out on top.  This was not good and the crowd did not seem to care in the slightest.

4. Extreme Rules Match
Jeff Hardy vs. Matt Hardy

Match didn't get a whole lot of time, and because of that it felt rushed, and they basically did one spot after another with no psychology whatsoever.  In essence, a ""garbage"" match.  However, it was a good ""garbage"" match that had some nice moments, and I enjoyed the ending quite a bit.  Absolutely worth a look. ***1/4

5. Intercontinental Championship Match
JBL (c) vs. Rey Mysterio

21 seconds this match went.  Yee Haw.  Not exactly what I expected from the first WrestleMania IC title defense since 2002.  Rey won, he looked ridiculous wearing a Heath Ledger Joker outfit (w/ suspenders), JBL quit.  End of story. DUD

6. Mr. WrestleMania vs. The Streak
Shawn Michaels vs. The Undertaker

At a combined age of 87, Shawn Michaels and the Undertaker not only outworked everyone on the show, but had unquestionably the best match of the night, and one of the best matches in WrestleMania history.  I would even go as far as to say it was one of the finest, most spectacular matches I've ever seen from the WWE.  Simply an epic, 30 minute classic that could not possibly be followed.  Crowd checked out after this match ended, and this without question should have been the main event, because it actually hurt the rest of the show.  Fantastic performances by both men, they are legends in the truest sense of the word. *****

7. World Heavyweight Championship Match
Edge (c) vs. John Cena vs. the Big Show

These men were put in a very difficult spot, because there was no way they were going to top the match before, or even come close.  I had pretty low expectations for this match going in, as did many people, but I must say they worked hard and did the best with what they could.  Crowd heat was nonexistant at first, as expected, and it didn't help matters much that Cena was working with Big Show (always an ugly affair), but they turned this into a darn acceptable match.  This was below standards for a World Championship match at Wrestlemania, but it was good for what it was and I found myself enjoying it. Worth a look as well.  **3/4

8. WWE Championship Match
Triple H (c) vs. Randy Orton

This not a bad match, but way below expectations and far from great.  There was a profound lack of heat throughout the bout, and the ending was extreemly anticlimactic, which didn't help matters.  That being said, the ring work was very solid and believable, but just like the last match this fell below standards of what has come to be expected from WWE Championship matches at Wrestlemania.  **1/2

Had this been any other PPV, the 4 star rating I gave this event would have gone without question.  However, this being the biggest show of the year from WWE, I feel as though the rating was a bit generous.  Barring the classic bout between 'Taker and Michaels, and a couple real good undercard matches, this was underwhelming for a WrestleMania and seemed to lack that big show feel, despite the tremendous size and setting of the event.  However, if you can look beyond that fact, this is a DVD that is worth your money, if not for the Undertaker/Michaels match alone.",1238976000,,5245,4.543223052294557
3781739,2,B001RXDM3G,"Since WrestleMania X-Seven, WrestleMania returned to Houston, TX for it's 25th Anniversary. And for the first time since WrestleMania X8, only one broadcast team announced the whole event card. However, this WrestleMania DID NOT deliver at all. There were a lot of bad bookings and match making decisions that really brought this event down. Not even a special appearence by  the 2009 Hall of Famer, Stone Cold Steve Austin could save this WrestleMania.

Money in the Bank Ladder Match
Kane Vs. Shelton Benjamin Vs. Christian vs. C.M. Punk Vs. U.S. Champion M.V.P. Vs. Finlay Vs. Mark Henry Vs. Kofi Kingston - This was a really great opener however it didn't stand up to previous MITB Matches. The match brought the crowd to their feet which eventually led them to start chanting ""THIS IS AWESOME"" throughout the match. Shelton Benjamin once again stole the show as he competed in his 4th MITB Match here. Everybody else looked very good, even Mark Henry who slammed Kofi Kingston onto a ladder at one point. Benjamin and Kingston brought some great athleticism to the match. The fans were a little bit disappointed with the winner but this was still an awesome match. A great way to kick off the show and one of the high notes of the night. 4.5/5

25 Diva Miss Wrestlemania Battle Royal - This Battle Royal was more RAW material then actual WrestleMania material. There was a few old faces that made it to the match such as Molly Holly, Sunny, and Victoria. But with Lita and Trish unable to participate in the match, Santino Marella was forced to be entered and would win. If it wasn't for the Intercontinental Title match, this would have been the worst match of the night. 0.5/5

Chris Jericho Vs. Roddy Piper, Jimmy Snuka, & Ricky Steamboat - Ric Flair was in the corner of the Legends in this match. This match was much better then anybody expected it to be. Piper and Snuka looked way off key so thankfully they were the first ones eliminated. In the end, Ricky Steamboat and Chris Jericho saved the match from being a trainwreck. Steamboat looked like to have gotten in great shape for the match which was a very good thing. The crowd really got into match towards the end. The post-match confrontation between Chris Jericho and Mickey Rourke is something worth checking out as well. 3.5/5

Extreme Rules Match
Jeff Hardy Vs. Matt Hardy - This was a much better match then their first meeting at Vengeance in 2001. These guys didn't wait for anything, they brought in weapons from the start. Matt at one point bringing out a vaccum cleaner and slamming it into Jeff's head. Couple of good spots to check out are Jeff splashing himself through two tables with Matt in-between of them and Jeff missing a huge leg drop off a 20 foot ladder. The ending with Matt hitting Jeff with a Twist of Fate and with Jeff's head in a steel chair was very disturbing. However, I felt much more could have been brought from these two. In the end, the right brother won this match. 3.5/5

Intercontinental Championship
John ""Bradshaw"" Layfield Vs. Rey Mysterio - Sad to say that this match had no point to it. The Intercontinental Championship was finally brought back to WrestleMania after 7 years and this is how it is treated? How shameful. The only purpose this match had was to crown Rey Mysterio with the IC Title but not in a good way. JBL got in cheap shots before the bell rung and when the bell rung, Rey scored with a 619 and hit JBL with a splash from the top rope and became the new IC champ in 21 seconds. This is the second time in a row that WrestleMania had a squash match. This match should have been on RAW and NOT at Wrestlemania. After the match, JBL announced that he was quitting the WWE. The only thing to notice in this match is Rey's Joker outfit from ""The Dark Knight."" This match really doesn't need a rating and it would soon become forgettable after the next match. 0/5

Undertaker Vs. Shawn Michaels - Can you say classic, because thats exactly what this match was. This was the most intense I've seen Undertaker at a WrestleMania. Shawn Michaels was bringing it to the Deadman very early on and applying moves such as the crossface and an inverted figure four leg lock to the Undertaker and even faining a knee injury to gaint he advantage while the Undertaker used his size and strength to overpower and dominate Shawn Michaels. The match went very back and forth with a mix of good wrestling and both men countering each other moves and finishers. The crowd even chanting ""THIS IS AWESOME"" at times as the match went on. Fantastic match that delivered all the way. Match of the night without a doubt. 5/5

World Heavyweight Championship
Edge Vs. Big Show Vs. John Cena - A better match then with what the storyline leading into it was. This was very solid triple threat match for the World's Title. Everybody got their spots in this one. Cena pulled off an impressive leg drop from the top rope to Big Show on the outside and also FU-ing Chavo Guerrero on the outside floor. Edge got his spots in too that includes spearing the Big Show through the barricade wall and spearing Cena out of mid-air from the top rope. A good Triple Threat match that exceeded many expectations. The only flaw was the outcome but that doesn't hold back against the match itself. 3.5/5

WWE Championship
Randy Orton Vs. Triple H - The stipulation to this match was that if Triple H got DQ-ed or Counted Out he would lose the WWE Title to Randy Orton. This was the most raged I seen Triple H in a Wrestlemania Main Event then ever before. This being his first Wrestlemania Main Event, Randy Orton looked pretty good. But the down side to this Main Event was that the crowd became completely dead after Orton and Triple H both pulled off their finishers within the FIRST minute of the match. And a Wrestlemania Main Event should NEVER make the crowd lifeless. After pulling off their finishers, Triple H and Orton put on a seemingly good match but nothing really stood out though. A little bit of a wrestling match but this match was more of a brawl and slugfest then anything. The match gets taken to outside various times where Orton inflected damaged to the ribs and mid-section of HHH. The closing moments to the match was HHH hitting Orton with a sledgehammer with the referee knocked down followed by a second Pedigree for the win. This wasn't a very good main event and should have been a lot better after all the hype this match got. 3.25/5

Overall, this WrestleMania has to be declared as one of the worst and most disappointing WrestleMania's EVER! However, I would still recommend this DVD release.",1238976000,,6612,4.591024555461473
3781740,3,B001RXDM3G,"I won't mince words, let's get to it:

C.M. Punk Vs. Mark Henry Vs. Kane Vs. Finley Vs. Kofi Kingston Vs. MVP Vs. Shelton Benjamin Vs. Christian (Money In The Bank Ladder Match) - Awesome opener! Even though their time in it was limited, even Kane and (surprisingly) Mark Henry looked good here! As usual, it was a spotfest wtih Shelton, MVP, Finley & Christian coming the closest to winning but in the end it was Punk who took the match for the second year in a row! I was actually pulling for MVP to win but I won't argue Punk. Watch for a sick powerslam from Henry to Kofi onto a ladder and an even sicker powerbomb from Shelton to MVP from the ring to the floor!

25 Diva Battle Royale - The winner was pretty much given away the second you saw Santino Marrella in drag in the match. I also think the fact that WWE couldn't get some of the more popular Divas like Trish Stratus and Lita really hurt this bout too. Still, the final sequence pretty much is the highlight of the match as Mickie James and Michelle McCool had a vicious exchange as well as Beth Phoenix and Melina. Ends when Santino....opps, Santina dumps out both Melina and Beth! Match itself wasn't bad but the angle and storyline on it sucks!

Ricky Steamboat, ""Rowdy"" Roddy Piper & ""Superfly"" Jimmy Snuka Vs. Chris Jericho (3 on 1 Handicap match) - With ""Nature Boy"" Ric Flair in their corner and Mickey Rourke at ringside, these three legends came in determined to teach Y2J a lesson in respect.

This match actually turned out better than expected! While its obvious that Piper and Snuka need to stay retired, Steamboat looked great! Heck, he and Flair could probably still go at it right now. Probably not for an hour but just 10 minutes would be better than some of the wrestling we get today!

Anyway, Jericho wins after eliminating all three wrestlers with Steamboat having the standout performance. After the match, Flair and Jericho get into it with Jericho getting the better of the exchange. Then, we have Jericho wanting to get it on with Mickey Rourke. Rourke, who was a boxer in his younger days, got into the ring and rather play Jericho's game (whiich is wrestling), he made Jericho play his by goading him into boxing. It ends with Y2J getting knocked out!

Guess the bad guy had to get his cummupance but it would've been more appropriate for a former wrestler to come to the aid of Flair & Co., perhaps one of his old Horsemen comrades?! The match itself was okay with a great performance from Steamboat.

Matt Hardy Vs. Jeff Hardy (Extreme Rules Match) - This one was more of a spotfest with both men doing some pretty high risk and dangerous moves. It wasn't bloody but as another reviewer said, it didn't need to be bloody as it was so personal with these two.

Ends when Jeff Hardy attempted a legdrop over 20ft. from a ladder only to miss, which allowed Matt to uses a funky version of his ""Twist Of Fate"" using a steel chair! Matt takes this one!

Rey Mysterio Vs. JBL (WWE Intercontinental Title Match) - In one of the few surprises of the night, Rey beats ""The Longhorn Loudmouth"" in 21 seconds! Also, as a bit of a surprise, JBL ""quits"" WWE much to the delight of the Texas crowd. Not much to talk about here other than Rey is the new I-C champion.

The Undertaker Vs. Shawn Michaels - Seems like every WM has at least one match that is as good or outshines the slated main events, THIS ONE WAS ONE OF THOSE MATCHES! In my eyes, this was the true main event of WM25 and is a MUST VIEW on this card! About the only thing that keeps it from being a 5 star bout is the slow part where both UT and Shawn miss respective dives outside the ring (though UT's does have him take a nasty spill on his head and knocking the crap out of a cameraman with him).

Lots of false finishes and surprise moves here. Michaels goes for submissions twice with his version of the figure four and his version of the crossface while UT nearly gets the win with his ""Hell's Gates"" chokehold. Long story short, UT gets his first ever one on one victory over Shawn and extends his record to 17-0 at WM. GREAT MATCH AND THE BEST ON THE CARD IN MY VIEW!

John Cena Vs. The Big Show Vs. Edge (Triple Threat Match for the World Heavyweight Championship) - Don't expect HHH/Benoit/Michaels from WM 20 here though it wasn't a bad bout. In fact, of the two world title matches, this one had the worst buildup BUT it actually turned out to be a pretty decent bout....except for the fact Cena won! Ugh! At least they got Vickie Guerrero out of the way early so that the focus went to the match.

Cena wins when he first hits the FU (sorry but its new name sucks) on TBS and then he FU's Edge on top of TBS for the win. Personally, I felt TBS should've won because he was so dominant in this bout and in leading up to the bout. Heck, I would've settled for Edge somehow keeping the belt! Cena is now a 6 time champion but somehow I don't feel too excited about this! Maybe we can talk C.M. Punk into pulling what he did last year!? LOL!

Randy Orton Vs. HHH (WWE World Title Match) - While not a bad match (it is worth a look as it does have some surprise and rugged spots), it feel far short of expectations. I think adding the ""DQ-rule waived"" stipulations actually hurt this match more than helped. They would've done better to go the Austin/Rock route back at WM X-7 and had it No DQ! I mean, think about it. With the way they build up this match, a no rules bout would've been perfect!

As it is, it isn't a bad bout but the crowd was DEAD in this match! In fact, they were dead after UT/Michaels and Austin doing his special farewell but even Cena/Edge/TBS got more reaction than this match. As I said, it actually isn't a bad match but it didn't feel like the main event!

Overall, this WM was okay but for a 25th Anniversary, it sure as hell didn't feel like it! I'll probably buy it anyway for UT/Michaels and a few other surprises but I wouldn't say this is a must buy.",1238976000,10,5940,4.313901345291479
3781741,4,B001RXDM3G,"The 25th Anniversary of WRESTLEMANIA had a lot to overcome.  The poor economy forecasted that the event wouldn't sell out the arena.  Strange booking had wrestling websites and loyal fans scratching their heads.  Like many naysayers pointed out, it just didn't feel like WRESTLEMANIA this time.

However, after a heavy gulp and a $55 dollar gamble, I am delighted to inform you that I found this PPV to be a pleasure to watch.  In fact, the show was going so well that it almost reached a five-star status...Almost.  Much akin to how WRESTLEMANIA 21 went down from Los Angeles a few years ago, the show simply ran out of gas in its final stretch.  The first three hours were fun, and even the poor aspects were forgivable.  The fourth hour, however, is going to be the most divisive for people who review this PPV.

So, I'm gonna dig in, and hope my reflections help you out.

1) Money-In-The-Bank Ladder Match
---The eight superstars who competed in this opener are to be commended from keeping this annual spotfest from getting stale.  In fact, this MITB Ladder Match is definitely one of the better ones.  First, I want to give Mark Henry and Kane a lot of credit for using their giant physiques to put some neat spins on the match.  Yes, they actually climb the ladders, and Henry even gets to pull off some sweet counters when a wrestler tries to use aerial attacks against him.  Another good moment is a wonderful bit of self-parody, when all the superstars shrug their shoulders before attempting the obligatory inside-to-outside dives.  It's almost as if the wrestlers knew that fans wanted to see it, and are mocking the poor strategy.  Shelton Benjamin is once again an MITB staple, but Kofi Kingston just might've eclipsed Shelton's show-stealing this year.  It's a toss-up, but if this match is to return at WRESTLEMANIA 26, then WWE would be wise to put both guys in it.  My only gripes with the match are that Christian and CM Punk (one of them won the match) didn't seem to do a whole lot.  Considering that the former helped revolutionize Ladder Matches and the latter used to work in ROH, I'm surprised that I don't remember them more.  But all in all, there are too many sweet spots to recap with this match, which is the best compliment you can give to a Ladder Match.
""8.0 / 10""

________________________________________

2) 25-Diva Battle Royal
---Not surprisingly, there's not much to say about this one.  It's a short cluster of a battle royal, with barely any kind of flow or rhythm to it.  I'm very disappointed that WWE didn't take the proper time to introduce the ladies, especially because a few of them were former talent for the company.  Then again, it would've ""ruined"" the surprise that Santino Marella was dressed as a Diva, and won the match.  The finish was funny, but the match is forgettable.  At least it was short.
""3.0 / 10""

3) 3-on-1 Handicap Elimination Match
Chris Jericho v.
Ricky Steamboat, Jimmy Snuka, & Roddy Piper (w/ Ric Flair)
---This was another match I didn't want to see, but it came off MUCH better than anticipated.  Prior to the match, WWE managed to use footage from THE WRESTLER, to hype Mickey Rourke's original challenge and eventual participation in the contest.  When the bell rang, the physical action was pretty smooth.  Basically, Snuka couldn't do a whole lot (no big surprise) and Piper could still pull of some good stuff (good news).  But Ricky Steamboat --- I kid you not --- was tremendous in the ring!  The one-on-one action Steamboat and Y2J delivered was crisp and exciting.  It was almost as if fans were given a chance to revisit the Steamboat/Savage classic from WRESTLEMANIA III, a match that Jericho claimed he used to reenact over and over again.  I am praying that WWE, Jericho, and ""The Dragon"" get to produce a rematch.  The aftermath involved Jericho challenging Mickey Rourke to enter the ring; the segment came off alright, but took a little too long.  In short, after some taunting, Rourke knocked Jericho out with a few punches, and celebrated with Ric Flair.  I'm more than satisfied with this match considering how poor it could've been.
""7.0 / 10"" (mostly for Ricky Steamboat's awesome performance)

4) Extreme Rules
Matt Hardy v. Jeff Hardy
---If you're concerned that these two will let you down like they did back in 2001, you can put your fears to rest.  In fact, the weapons come into play immediately, and both brothers just use toy after toy to punish each other.  Rather than trying to warm up the crowd with any kind of traditional wrestling, Jeff and Matt just pummel away for our viewing pleasure.  And what a pleasure it is!  There are no botches (that I saw), and the two guys don't even protect each other's attacks much.  Chairs, trashcans, a super vacuum, a kendo stick, a crutch, a trash can...need I say more?  The match isn't bloody, but it doesn't need to be.  After seeing these guys jump from ladders and crash through tables, their anguish was real enough.  The match might be a little shorter than I expected from a marquee WRESTLEMANIA match.  But if the finish and commentary is of any indication, the war has only just begun.
""7.5 / 10""

5) Intercontinental Championship
JBL (champion) v. Rey Mysterio
---I'm sad to report that this one is a disappointment, although there is a method to its madness.  You see, the match itself is less than a minute.  JBL trash talks his way to the ring, Mysterio shows up looking like Heath Ledger's Joker, JBL assaults Rey before the bell rings, and then Mysterio pulls off four moves to win the IC Title.  Now, I understand that having a bad guy promise ""the most dominant victory in WM history"" is a funny way to setup a squash.  JBL is an excellent talker, and Rey deserves a title run.  After losing, JBL grabs a mike, and QUITS!  But why couldn't there have been a longer match to setup JBL's loss?  I'm really torn, because I wasn't bored, but I'm still very disappointed that these two didn't get to show off their abilities.
""4.0 / 10"" (even lower if you're looking for a match)
________________________________________

6) Shawn Michaels v. The Undertaker
---Get ready for what is sure to be a WRESTLEMANIA fan-favorite!  Are you really surprised to read that comment?  Two native Texans with a couple of infamous WWE matches together got to square off in their first one-on-one match in over decade.  Everything you want from a Taker WM match is here: his opponent is a credible foe very capable of ending his streak, and almost does on numerous occasions.  HBK and Taker use some good submission holds, good old-fashioned slugfests, countering the finishers, VERY close pinfall attempts...all resulting in utter exhaustion from the audience and the two competitors.  Is the match perfect?  Not really, mainly due to a very strange sequence where Taker & HBK both fail to land a suicide dive, resulting in a long period of both men staggering around.  Also, the final minutes include both men taking a while to just stand up (think the HBK/HHH Hell-In-A-Cell from 2004).  But is the match worth your time?  Absolutely, this is one of Undertaker's finest matches, Shawn Michaels' finest matches, and WRESTLEMANIA's finest matches.
""8.5 / 10""

7) World Heavyweight Championship
Edge (champion) v. Big Show v. John Cena
---In case you're wondering, Cena has a very interesting entrance for WRESTLEMANIA again.  As for this title bout, this has one of the worst angles I've ever seen from the WWE, but the match itself isn't bad.  There's some good comedy moments where the three men have to help each other out in various situations, and the action is fast-paced and rarely boring.  All three men almost win the match on plenty of occasions, and looked like championship material amidst a crappy storyline.  Where the match goes wrong is that like most Triple Threat Matches at WRESTLEMANIA, this one is shorter than it should be.  So, after all this analysis, what do I think?  I think that Edge, Show, and Cena overcame a very rough road to WRESTLEMANIA, and delivered a crazy entertaining ride that belonged on another PPV.  It's fun, but it could've been better.
""6.5 / 10""

***After anncouning that WRESTLEMANIA 26 was going to Arizona, we were then introduced to the 2009 Hall of Fame inductees.  Not a bad bunch.  I personally didn't care for 'Stone Cold' Steve Austin driving around in a buggy and drinking a crapload of beer.  On the other hand, he is (IMHO) the most popular wrestler in history.  So, perhaps he deserved these few minutes to celebrate.***

***The HHH/Orton main event is now being hyped, which means that the advertised Unified Tag Team Championships is not on this PPV.  I learned later that is was a pre-show match.  Yeah...I'm definitely angry about that.***

8) WWE Championship
Randy Orton v. Triple H (champion - Loses Title If Disqualified or Counted Out)
---Oh boy...this one is gonna produce a lot of heavy debate for years to come.  Let's start with the buildup: In short, I thought it was awesome.  The video package and commentators do an excellent job of making this a match filled with hatred & revenge & obsession.  It's a very psychological scenario, made clearer when HHH's entrance has him looking in a mirror, and crashing through it to walk to the ring.  But this setup eventually produced a lot of big missteps, in my opinion.  First off, seeing the Pedigree and RKO within the first minute is a VERY stupid decision in my book, because now the moves have no crowd psychology when they come back into the match.  Because of the storyline, the contest had to be a hard-hitting fight, with little wrestling involved.  Slugfests and crazy fights are fine with me, but after a while, clotheslines and punches just start getting repetitive after a while.  I'm also surprised (and disappointed) that Legacy and/or the McMahon Family didn't make a single appearance during the match.  How could such a personal war between two men be so restrained?  The pace was very slow, but not in a good way.  Slow paces are supposed to either draw a crowd into the minds of the wrestlers, or tease us for the big spots.  Sadly, I found it hard to care about the wrestlers' actions, and the big spots weren't anything special.  I guess the best way I can sum this up is that it's too cerebral.  It challenges our minds, but doesn't rouse our spirits.  It makes for interesting TV, but makes for a poor live showcase.  The Houston crowd was deader in this match than any other on the card, and the main event should NEVER be that way.  Houston didn't even make noise when HHH's finishing Pedigree was executed; the three-count was almost more of a relief than a celebration.

Overall, I appreciate the concept of this main event, but can't say I enjoyed it very much.
""6.0 / 10""
________________________________________

The 25th Anniversary of WRESTLEMANIA is definitely a good one, even if its 4th hour loses steam.  I forgive the Diva Battle Royal and the IC Title squash, because neither match was a big draw.  But the two main events (and lack of the WWE Tag Team Titles match on PPV) are what brings this PPV down to a 4-star rating for me.  Again, this event is very similar to how WM 21 proceeded, where a strong show just lost its momentum.

Many press reporters and fans had doubts about the 25th Anniversary of WRESTLEMANIA.  But I definitely recommend that you check this one out.  It's a good PPV with some worthwhile matches, and a couple of good musical performances.  No wrestling PPV is perfect, and WWE has done its annual extravaganza proud.",1238889600,3,12172,4.863879436071949
3781742,3,B001RXDM3G,"This could have been such a great event. Come on Wrestlemania 25! It's a good thing Wrestlemania 20 delivered because if it hadn't, this one could have been twice as baffling. There were opportunities for great turns and story cappers - none took place.

The event started with the Money In The Bank ladder match. Participants were Mark Henry, Kane, CM Punk, Christian, Finlay, and, I believe, Kofi Kingston. Looking back at the previous MITB matches, this one wasn't quite as strong. A few very cool spots, but the most memorable thing about it was that it featured something plaguing most of the subsequent matches: remarkably unremarkable finales.

After this opener, Kid Rock was allowed to torture the ears of the audience with some musical laxative. It could be that the audience indeed hurt its ears during this snoozer. Why? Let me put it this way: judging from the behaviour of the audience, one could think most of the 70 000 people weren't there at free will.

After those interminable minutes, the much-dreaded Diva Battle Royal rose its ugly - or very pretty -  face. I'm tired of commenting on these things, but if there are indeed people out there enjoying such things, well, god bless, enjoy.

Now, I expected not much, if anything, from the Jericho Vs. Legends match, but it did really well! Believe it or not, after Jericho eliminated Piper and Snuka, him and Steamboat put on a show that had more fire than much of the other matches - and the audience was into it, unlike during the rest of the show.
Eventually, after beating everyone up, Jericho wanted Mickey Rourke in the ring. And, god honest truth, I wanted Jericho to beat him up, and if only because the booking team stuck Chris Jericho into such a darn goofy match at Wrestlemania! And again, the unremarkable ending: you could literally feel the audience thinking ""this was it?""

Matt Hardy Vs. Jeff Hardy was one of the few matches I had high expectations for. And why not? It took place under ""Extreme Rules"" - which is just a fancy way of saying ""No DQ"" - and if there is a team good at that, then by god it's the Hardys. I just don't know; like so many other matches of the night, it just felt slow and staged, and the snoring of the audience heavily enforced this feeling. Make no mistake, it was a good match, but didn't come anywhere near the performance of the classic TLC matches. Which is amazing, you would think that, as brothers, they would harmonise better.

JBL Vs. Rey Mysterio for the IC Title.
On paper, this is not a good combo (assuming there is indeed a man capable of making JBL look good), but stranger pairings worked out, so why not? Guess what, we never find out! JBL comes out, announces the ""most dominant victory at Wrestlemania ever"". Rey delivers the 619, the splash, and it was over in 20 seconds. A little brawl before the match officially started made no sense, and was just off-putting.
After the ""match"", JBL made an announcement I couldn't care less for, but find out yourself.
This made zero sense.
Oh, and by the way, one audience member held up a sign saying ""Jelly Belly Loser"", and I agree. Lay off the carbs, you bloater!

Shawn Michaels Vs. Undertaker.
Finally, a true Wrestlemania classic, on paper. But this time, this time, dear reader, it truly was! The side aspect of this story about Dark Vs. Light was slightly irritating, but it doesn't matter, this was a match for the ages.
Both men battled for 30 minutes, and it was the only (!) time the audience was really on fire. It never dragged, and the tension was just palpable. The ending could have been a tad shorter, but that is a truly minor quibble. Even though I was sitting at home, I couldn't help but applaud a few seconds afterwards.

Following this superb WM match was a Triple Threat bound to dissapoint. Occasionally, something can be more than the sum of its parts, but any match featuring Big Show and John Cena is bound to NOT be more. Who came up with the idea of squeezing Big Show into this whole enchillada? During the match, I kept thinking ""now, this could start to be good if that 7 foot klump of clay didn't continue to disrupt the pace.""
This match just rambled on incoherently, until all three men fumbled an already unremarkable finale. It was all the more lame because you really expected at least *some* sort of story twist or turn or capper or *anything*. In the end, the audience was too bored to even celebrate the victory of Cena.

I was actually looking forward to Triple H Vs. Randy Orton, simply because their feud was intense, and it could have been a big payoff. But, first of all, let me get one thing out of my mind right now. If you have a feud where both men attacked each other in most vicious and brutal ways, and each one of them is just waiting to get his hands around the throat of the other at WM, surely you won't set up a match where the rules of disqualification are stricter than ever?
Well, this is the result of doing just that. There was no twist, no interference, no nothing. It was lame, simply put. Lame, tame and ordinary.

And, honestly, this is the biggest sin; not that the matches were slow or illogical or tame - they were ordinary. At Wrestlemania, much less at Wrestlemania's 25th anniversary, you don't serve the ordinary. The audience expects the extra-ordinary, and when the people don't get it, a crowd of 70 000 is affecting the atmosphere of an event more severely than a crowd of 20 000.
Seriously, during most of the event, the audience was just dead. Dead! This was actually the most baffling audience behaviour I have ever witnessed. It was like the audience didn't warm up properly, then they were let down by one match, and the subsequent let-downs came so quick in a row that they never caught up with digesting all of them.

The only two people producing something extra-ordinary tonight were Shawn Michaels and The Undertaker, their match was indeed more than exquisite, even for a Wrestlemania.
