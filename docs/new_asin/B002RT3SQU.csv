8378844,5,B002RT3SQU,Best holocaust documentary I've seen,1421107200,,36,6.4
8378845,5,B002RT3SQU,A very different view of the Holocaust - as seen through the eyes of artists (mostly children at the time) who secretly produced art while in captivity and after.  Dramatic and moving interviews with surviving artists and good presentation of the artworks.  I watched with a group and we all thought it was a wonderful view of these events.,1403222400,2,340,4.745762711864407
8378846,5,B002RT3SQU,Very heart wrenching to hear what these holocaust survivors had to do to live.  I'm going to share my experience with those I work with.,1374451200,,136,4.44
8378847,5,B002RT3SQU,"I use this in my English class to precede a closure activity for Elie Wiesel's NIGHT.  The students are mesmerized by the artwork and by the stories.  Choosing Maya Angelou as the narrator was a wonderful idea.  She uses her poem ""I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings"" to introduce the film.  It is perfect as I also teach this poem.",1370044800,2,328,4.327868852459017
8378848,5,B002RT3SQU,"Extremely well done.  Holds your attention with file photos of period and interviews with people who experienced the horror and survived.  The films are hard to watch but the interviews and Maya Angelo's voice calms the situation for a historical lesson of man's brutality to man, side by side with man's kindness to one another helping each other to have hope.",1301011200,7,361,4.901639344262295
