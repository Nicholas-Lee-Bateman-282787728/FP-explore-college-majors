1565580,5,B00005JP3M,"I absolutely cannot say enough about this show!  It debuted when I was 4 and I've probably been watching it ever since then.  It's my favorite show of all time and it depicts small town life in America's heartland.  The characters are believable and incredibly funny.  There's Thelma (Mama), the sassy grandma and matriarch of the Harper clan, her son Vinton, the dimwitted key grinder, his wife Naomi, the sexy grocery store checker, Mama's grandson Bubba, a wild rough around the edges teenager just out of reform school, and Mama's neighbor and best friend Iola, a spinster and a whiz at arts and crafts who can make just about anything out of well...just about anything.  There were several other characters when the show first aired and they were great, but I loved the show even more when it went into syndication.  Every single episode had me laughing 'til I was crying.  And no show has ever made me laugh, cry, and smile quite so much.  I think we Mama's Family fans have waited more than enough time to get our favorite show on DVD.  Hopefully the powers that be are reading these reviews and will see this show is most definitely worth putting on DVD!",1149379200,5,1162,4.6292682926829265
1565581,5,B00005JP3M,"I am so happy this is on dvd despite some flaws. Mama's family has been a staple in my life since it was called The Family.  Eunice was always my favorite character in those days.  I was very glad to see her appear during the tv debut of the sitcom.  But as time went on they made Mama out to be the lead star and it really worked.  After nearly being cancelled after two seasons another network came to the rescue of Mama.  Aunt Fran and Ellen Harper Jackson left the show to be on the Golden Girls.  I don't know where Buzz and Sonia went.  Maybe to live with their mother Mitzi in Las Vegas.  Enter Iola Lucille Boylen (The Harper's Neighbor) and Bubba Higgins (Ed and Eunice's wayward son).  The two characters added some much needed change to the series.  Iola as mama's sidekick was such a great idea becuase the chemistry between the two was remarkable.

Some of my favorite episodes from the entire series of Mama's Family:

Vint and Naomi's Wedding
Eunice and Mama spend the night in the Jug.
Mama's Class Reunion.
Madame Rita meets Ezmarelda The Queen of The Gypsies.
Naomi's troubles at Food Circus with the new boss.
April Fools.
Mama Clause.

Some of my favorite lines:

1.(MAMA) I'M MOVING AS FAST AS I CAN CHUBS!!!
2.(NAOMI) I'M NOT PLAYING WITH A BIG LOSER.  (MAMA) WHY NOT YOU SLEEP WITH ONE!
3. (MAMA) OH REALLY YOU LOOKED 70 BACK THEN TOO HAH
4. (MAMA) I SAID SIT DOWN AND SHUT UP!!!
5. (EUNICE) HE SAID LOOK MUFFIN LOOK AT THE STAR!!

Too many to mention but you get the idea.  I love the front cover art of the dvd.  I don't love the fact that these episodes are the edited versions.  I hope season 2 comes out soon I can't wait to return to Raytown The Jewel of the Tri-state area.",1149206400,39,1703,4.29874213836478
1565582,5,B00005JP3M,Thanks to Amazon for posting this. Maybe it was done to see if there is enough interest in Mama's Family on DVD. I for one am very interested. I have made numerous copies of all the episodes on VHS and given to many of my friends as we are all fans of the show. The VHS quality only lasts so long after many viewings that it being on DVD would be wonderful. I hope that this becomes a reality.,1149120000,8,393,3.9873417721518987
1565583,5,B00005JP3M,"Mama's Family is on the greatest TV shows of all time. Seriously! I have been watching it 20+ years (thanks TBS) and though I've seen every episode hundreds of times, they never grow stale! Just like The Golden Girls, the humor is timeless and universal! Thelma 'Mama' Harper rules her roost with an iron oven mit (most assured it came from Neidermayer's) which houses nincompoop son, Vint, his 2 children (Buzz & Sonja) from a previous marriage, new wife Naomi (Mama's nemesis and the town floozie) and sister Fran (played by the always remarkable Rue McClanahan). Other children include Vint's older sisters Ellen (Betty White) and the indominable Eunice (Carol Burnett). The first 2 season are great, but like most others, I agree that the syndicated years were far funnier with Bubba and the inspiring Iola Boyland (knock, knock...). My fave episodes include: The Keek, the terror of Li'l Eugene, Rashomama (well what the...), Iola's freeze-dried cat, Mama gets mugged, Mama ruins Vint & Naomi's house party, Mama & Iola think Naomi is trying to kill Vint and collect the insurance, Mama's dead mother pays her a ghostly visit (didn't put enough salt in them peas!), Mama & Bubba work at McRay's, Mama goes to work at the Ray Travel Company, etc... Like I said each show is its own gem!!! PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE release this on DVD...us Mama fans are ready to kick back with a can of Circus Beer and enjoy the memories all over again!",1149120000,6,1436,4.794354838709677
1565584,5,B00005JP3M,"I have watched this sitcom each weekday am for many, many months.  It runs 6 - 7 am.  Each time I watch an episode I find something new to laugh about.

1565585,5,B00005JP3M,"Please release this on DVD!!! My VHS tapes of it are worn to the bone from being played since the mid nineties! When I saw Mama's Family on Amazon I absolutely cheered. I have an awesome and growing DVD collection and it just wouldn't be complete without Mama's temper with her family every time they walk in the door, walk out the door, or sit down for a meal. Mama's Family so totally rocks! Hurry up and release this, pretty please!",1148428800,7,435,4.382716049382716

The theme song plays on loop the entire time you are at the menu, the theme song also plays at the beginning of each episode, and every line of every episode is included. (Yes even the ones that were considered risque') Apparently they fixed the problem and re-released these. Because mine is perfect and each episode is exactly as long as it should be.

1566634,5,B00005JP3M,"I looked for these some years ago...I always liked the characters they created for MAMA'S FAMILY.  The things I don't remember is the first few seasons of Harvey Korman beginning each episode talking to the camera (which in my opinion gets old and quite stupid) which is very annoying! And the other cast members like Rue McClanahan is a good (evidently before she went on to Golden Girls) actress, and of course, the most enduring and beloved Betty White is an outstanding actress who plays one of mama's daughters Ellen. And she moved onto Golden Girls too. Checkout the back story on one of the dvd's about the characters being switched when the two actresses moved on to Golden Girls. Vicki Lawrence does a superb job as usual as Mama and is hilarious bouncing insults off of Dorothy Lyman who plays Vinton's love interest Naomi. Of course, Vinton is played by the excellent song and dance man Mr. Ken Berry. I remember watching him on a lot of the variety shows (especially Carol Burnett show) singing and dancing and never knew how talented he was until I saw him perform. Before that I just saw him on Mayberry RFD. So roll up or down your stockings and take a load off, AND wake-up and SMELL the coffee Mama's back in DVD!!",1419897600,,1231,4.570135746606335

1567035,4,B00005JP3M,"Being 33, I was too young to watch this show when it originally aired, nor the Carol Burnett Show from which the premise originated. So my recent viewing of this DVD set was my first introduction to Mama's Family, as well as actresses Vicki Lawrence and Carol Burnett.

In the pilot, Thelma Harper (Lawrence), who already has her sister Fran (Rue McClanaghan) living in her home, finds she will be making room for three more, as her divorced son Vint (Ken Berry) admits to having been evicted and now being homeless with his two teenage children, Sonja and Buzz. Of course, Thelma can't refuse them, although she makes sure to let Vint know precisely how she feels about his life, his choices and his personality flaws at every moment she gets.

The family also includes Thelma's daughters Ellen (Betty White) and Eunice (Carol Burnett), as well as Naomi (Dorothy Lyman), Thelma's neighbor who reconnects a high school friendship with Vint and soon after marries him.

Particularly noteworthy Season 1 episodes include the two-part wedding of Vint and Naomi, which spawns all sorts of family fights and hijinks; ""Family Feud,"" where the family travels to California to appear on the show (with a guest appearance by the real host, Richard Dawson); and ""Mama Gets a Job,"" where the long-time homemaker takes a position at a local travel agency, with disastrous (and hilarious) results.

Although this show aired three decades ago, the storylines and humor are still just as funny and relevant today! Mama's Family is a genuine classic.",1393372800,,1534,4.957198443579767

This was also a problem when they released the ""UNEDITED"" Carol Burnett show dvds. They KNEW they were edited, but, ultimately it's about the cash folks! Would they sell as many copies of an EDITED dvd set or the original broadcast UNEDITED dvd set?

When you watch disc 1 then 2, you'll notice that Vint is not even married to Naomi yet in some of the disc 2 episodes when he just got married to her in disc 1! Pretty bush league if you ask me.

1567679,5,B00005JP3M,"I been hooked on this show for about a week now. We get to see some special gust stars by Carol Burnett the legendary herself Betty White who are just as wacky as ever. Specially Carol. Mama is my favorite character which is played by Vickie Laurence along with Eunice who is played by Carol who is one of mama's three children. The chemistry between Mama and Eunice is priceless. You get all the laughs and more out of ""Mama's Family"". I already told you about the all the fun you could have by watching this great show. Now hear comes the sad part about this ""DVD release. Like so many other ""good"" TV shows it is sadly standing alone with no word of it's follower....season 2. The fact is that this season was released back in 2006. I thought to myself ""Well that's typical. Looks like another case of bad sales."" I'm noticing a lot of these ""good"" TV shows are suffering because of bad sales. What people needs to realize is just because a show is old doesn't mean it's worthless. I really don't see a reason why today's generation just can't sit down and appreciate comedy of this show's quality. I'm young myself so I can speak for myself when I say I ""actually"" like comedy like this. Oh, sure I am also in to a little bit of today's TV shows but I seem to manage to fit an oldie in every once in a while. I bought this for $24.99 and I know for a fact that that was extremely close to Warner Brother's asking price. Now everywhere I look copy's for this is on sell for $9.99. Warner is ""in fact"" losing money now. So if by any chance that price for this show goes back up to the full asking price and you have not got it yet, tell your friends and family and whoever likes this show to order there copy's ASAP. I get the fact that some people can't afford it and that is perfectly understandable. We do live in a low down economy. But take this as good advise, if you are a fan of this show and you are saving for something newer(perhaps a newer TV show) and you want to wait on this one pick this one up first because you know the newer items will last longer on shelves plus most likely there will be more seasons seeing's how it's a new show anyway. The popularity is very high for newer shows. Show's like this however needs the most attention. Believe me. You don't have to take my advise but it's the only way I can think of that ""could"" work on saving the future for this show and other cancelled TV show's for DVD release.

Unfortunately, you'll only get a small sample of Mama's Family as this is the only season offered on DVD, and it's been that way since I purchased this in 2006.  It's also quite frustrating that the DVD is edited and not the full episode as originally aired on TV.

I've watched Season One so many times I've lost count, and I still laugh every time I watch them again; a mark of a true classic that retains its freshness and entertainment quotient many years down the road.

1568043,4,B00005JP3M,"An unexpected spin-off from the 'Family' skits on ""The Carol Burnett Show"", MAMA'S FAMILY reunited audiences with Vicki Lawrence's sharp-tongued Thelma Harper and introduced her extended brood of wacky family members.  As the show opens, Mama isn't too pleased about the arrival of her son Vint (Ken Berry) and his two teenaged kids Buzz and Sonja (Eric Brown and Karin Argoud), who've decided to stay indefinitely following Vint's wife's departure to become a Las Vegas showgirl...er, cocktail waitress.  Vint later hooks up with Thelma's floozy neighbour Naomi (Dorothy Lyman).  Also living in the house is Thelma's spinster sister Fran (Rue McClanahan); frequent visitors include Thelma's squabbling daughters Ellen (Betty White) and Eunice (Carol Burnett).

MAMA'S FAMILY originally debuted on NBC in early 1983.  It was cancelled in 1985 but brought back in first-run syndication the following year; finally wrapping in 1990.  ""Golden Girls"" fans will get a kick out of seeing Betty and Rue together here; Carol Burnett's guest appearances in several of the better episodes (including the two-part ""Wedding"" and ""Cellmates"", arguably the best episode in the first year) are to be savoured.

At this stage it would be safe to assume that Warners won't be issuing any further season sets.  Let's hope that Shout! Factory (or similar) will come to the party.  We need Thelma Harper now more than ever!

Episodes:

""Vint and the Kids Move In"" - Vint's chinchilla business has gone belly up, leaving him and the kids homeless...but Thelma promised the spare room for Fran to use as a writing studio...

""For Better or For Worse"" - Thelma's nightmare has come true.  After an evening of poring through Vint's collection of TV Guides, Vint and Naomi announce their engagement.

""The Wedding"" (Parts 1 & 2) - The day has arrived.  Vint and Buzz head off for the buck's party, leaving the girls at home to amuse themselves.  Cheap wine soon livens up the proceedings but Ellen still has a secret involving her husband's secretary.  Eunice wants to sing ""Oh Promise Me"" at the ceremony, but not even a tray of chilli dogs will sway Thelma.

""Family Feud"" - Vint arranges for the Harper clan to appear on ""Family Feud""...will it all end in tears?

""Cellmates"" - Ed (Harvey Korman) and Thelma surprise Eunice with a birthday celebration at the Bigger Jigger...which soon dissolves into a fiasco when Eunice uncovers the reason why a childhood boyfriend left and never called on her again.

""Mama Gets a Job"" - It's a GREAT day at the Raytown Travel Agency...or is it?  Unappreciated Thelma gets a job but the opportunity soon turns sour, as Vint and the others can't seem to operate without constantly phoning her.

""Double Standard"" - Sonja is woman...hear her roar!  When she discovers the differences in how Vint treats Buzz, Sonja (with the support of Thelma and Naomi) decides to take a stand.

""Mama's Boyfriend"" - Thelma has a date...with a MAN?  The Harper clan don't know what to make of this unusual occurrance.

""Fran's Dress"" - Disaster for Fran when a distracted Thelma ruins her beautiful new dress hours before she's due at an awards banquet.

""Alien Marriage"" - Vint decides to marry a Portugese woman in order to get some money.  *This story does not follow the continuity of the earlier episodes (ie: Naomi and Vint are not yet married).

""Positive Thinking"" - A new Eunice?  That seems to be the case when she starts a regime of positive thinking cassettes, and lands a small role at the Pepper Pot Playhouse.  Guest stars Gloria DeHaven.

""Mama's Silver"" - The gloves are off when Thelma discovers that Vint pawned her silver service in order to bail a deadbeat friend (Geoffrey Lewis) out of jail.",1282003200,,3711,4.935483870967742

1568206,5,B00005JP3M,"Contrary to popular belief, ""Mama's Family"" is technically not a spin-off of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Carol-Burnett-Show/dp/B00006G8I2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Carol Burnett Show </a>. It is actually an aftereffect of the (much) lesser-known 1982 movie, aptly titled ""Eunice."" However, there were many eps of ""The Family"" (as it was known on Ms. Burnett's show) that are very much-loved. As you know, the sitcom premiered as a mid-season replacement in Jan. 1983 on NBC and was canceled the following season. Like many other family-friendly shows of the 80's ""Mama's Family"" found another life. This time the show was re-invited for first-run syndication. And, throughout the rest of the run of ""Mama's Family"" it remained the number one syndicated show in the country!

""Mama's Family"" is as 80's as the New Coke, Apple Computers and the Material Girl's conical braziers. You can't get more 80's than ""Mama's Family,"" nor can you find a funnier or more clever sitcom with such a stellar cast. From Vicki Lawrence (Mama, of couse) all the way down to prudish Aunt Franny (Rue McClanahan of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Maude/dp/B000MGTQ6G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Maude </a>and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Golden-Girls/dp/B0002W4SX6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Golden Girls </a>&nbsp;) the entire Harper Family and extended family was blended together so well.

Of course my favorite member of Mama's family is her troubled and perpetually unhappy (and equally insecure, not to mention kooky) daughter, Eunice Higgins. Eunice was played by none other than the legend, Ms. Carol Burnett. There was something about Eunice that just made everyone love her. She was always able to draw people to her with one hand while simultaneously pushing them away with the other. The best way to describe Eunice would be as the lovable-loser. She just had such a quality to her that was inexplicably unique because this same quality also managed to cause as much trouble as possible. Eunice was the black sheep of the family that everyone wanted to kick out the door; but never could. I always loved it when Ed (Harvey Korman) called her ""Eunie""

Like a really tasty pot of Hungarian Goulash, ""Mama's Family"" is just as diverse. Because like this pot of stew, the family runs the gamut  of having all types of personalities thrown in; including the kitchen sink! One scene could have a warm and fuzzy moment and another could involve a nasty cat-fight between Eunice and Naomi Harper (Dorothy Lyman.) Never one to play second fiddle, Ellen (Betty White, of course best known for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Golden-Girls/dp/B0002W4SX6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Golden Girls</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Mary-Tyler-Moore-Show/dp/B00005JLIC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Mary Tyler Moore Show </a>) always managed to wiggle her snobbish upturned nose into everyone's affairs. I loved it how someone (usually Eunice) could make such a hateful comment and by the end of the show all would be forgiven. It really was so entertaining watching some of these ""barroom brawls"" take their course on ""Mama's Family."" And, isn't that just like family? The ones that love you the most always hurt the most, right?

These are the Season One usual suspects:
Vicki Lawrence (Mama Harper)
Carol Burnett (Eunice Higgins)
Ken Berry (Vinton Harper)
Dorothy Lyman (Naomi Oats Harper)
Betty White (Ellen Jackson)
Rue McClanahan (Fran Crowley)
Harvey Korman (Ed Higgins)
Eric Brown (Buzz Harper)
Karin Argoud (Sonja Harper)

There's a total of 13 eps from Season One. Yes, and these aren't the full network versions; instead these are the syndicated versions. I say: so what! These are still great shows. I'm sure some crybaby/hater will leave me a nasty comment but I don't care. (My response to him or her is get a life, don't you have more important things to scream about?!!) If Warner Home Video chooses to do this I am none the sadder. The only other option is to try to catch ""Mama's Family"" on the ION Network. Now those people are the real crooks. Because they license as many shows as they can from Warner Bros. and then they splice and dice and cut to a commercial right in the middle of a pivotal scene. So I don't mind these DVDs at all. As a matter of fact, I just purchased this set as a stocking stuffer for my dad. Like my entire family, he loves this show!

Here are the Season One show titles with the original air dates:

Vint and the Kids Move In 1/22/1983
As the title states, Vint moves in with Mama and Aunt Franny after his first-wife, Mitzy takes off.

For Better or For Worse 1/29/1983
Vinton is reunited with Naomi Oats, to Mama's horror.

The Wedding (1) 2/5/1983
The 2 wedding eps are my very favorites from the NBC version. The girls get ready the big day, while the boys go out and celebrate. Ellen makes some comment about it being one of the best evenings of her life; of course this is all prior to Eunice showing up and telling her that her hubby is having an affair with his secretary!

The Wedding (2) 2/12/1983
Eunice causes temper-tantrum after temper-tantrum during Vint and Naomi's wedding ceromony.

Family Feud 2/19/1983
The gang all go on ""The Family Feud."" Richard Dawson plays himself in this memorable show.

Cellmates 2/26/1983
This is another favorite of mine. Eunice really does have a barroom brawl when she finds out that Ed didn't plan any splashy party for her birthday. I love it when Ed says to her, ""what friends Eunie"" when she asks if her friends are going to suddenly pop out to surprise her. In the jail cell, Mama (who's also locked up) befriends Scarlet; a tough-talking hooker who managed to put everything into perspective for Eunice and Mama. I think in this show Mama and Eunice really managed to bond.

Mama Gets a Job 3/5/1983
Mama gets a job as a receptionist at a travel agency. After she insults an elderly couple one too many times she gets the boot.

Double Standard 3/12/1983
Mama's grandchildren go to a school dance.

Mama's Boyfriend 3/19/1983
Mama goes out with an old flame.

Fran's Dress 3/26/1983
Aunt Fran threatens to move out after Mama scorches her dress.

Alien Marriage 4/2/1983
Claude, a friend of Vint's tries to get him to marry an illegal immigrant. Note: this ep aired out of order as Vint was already married to Naomi by now.

Positive Thinking 4/30/1983
Eunice is the star of this show! She takes up a new positive attitude and things really start to turn out great! She even gets a part in a play that the coveted Pepper-Pot Playhouse is putting on. When Mama comes to the rehearsal and sticks her nose into Eunice's affairs things really start to cook! It's so funny when Eunice manages to pull the toupee off the director's head. And I love it when Eunice refers to the star of the play as ""Miss Piggy."" So funny! Then she come's back to Mama's (seething) and gets into another viscous fight with Naomi, barking, ""I just decked the entire crew at the Pepper-Pot Playhouse, don't think I'm afraid of a freak from the Food Circus.""

Mama's Silver 5/7/1983
Vint hocks Mama's silver to bail Claude out of jail.

Keep in mind, in Season One there isn't any Iola Lucille Boyland (Beverly Archer) or Bubba Higgins (Allan Kayser.) These two (incredibly comical) characters were only relegated to the syndicated version of the show. As Vicki wrote in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vicki-The-True-Life-Adventures-of-Miss-Fireball/dp/0684802864/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vicki!: The True-Life Adventures of Miss Fireball</a>, she chose to fire those two that played Vint's kids.

So how does this ""Mama's Family"" DVD measure up?
UPSIDE: The picture and sound quality are just gorgeous. Couldn't be better!
DOWNSIDE: A lot of good, funny lines I remember have been cut completely out. I miss them!
A lot of TV shows get stuff cut out of them to make more room for commercials. The whole idea of a DVD is to do away with commercials, have the customer actually PAY for the show, and then deliver the product in its unadulterated form.  Plain old common horse sense.
GREAT WARNER'S DVD: The old Popeye cartoons. Stellar sound and picture quality. UNCUT!
BAD WARNER'S DVD: Mama's Family. Stellar sound and picture quality. CUT ALL OVER THE PLACE.
If you've never seen this show before, the DVD won't bother you: what you don't know can't hurt you. For the rest of us, the pleasurable viewing experience is marred by exasperating, meaningless editing. Buyer: beware!
I'll probably never become a ""Top 500 Reviewer"", because I always complain when DVDs have been cut or tampered with in ways which detract from their artistic integrity, and most people find that my ""review was not helpful"".

The main thing to remember is that they FINALLY released the first season of this fabulous show after more than 20 years!  I LOVED ""Mama's Family"" when it first aired back in 1983 and it is probably one of the funniest and most under-rated family sitcoms in television history!  Vicki Lawrence is an absolute hoot as Thelma ""Mama"" Harper and her insults and put-downs are hysterical!  She is the ""template"" that other outrageous sitcom grandmothers are based on.

1568523,4,B00005JP3M,"Mama's Family definitely gets five stars.  One of my favorite shows of all-time, especially during its first two seasons with the occasional appearances of Eunice.  What a stellar cast: Vicki Lawrence, Betty White, Rue McClanahan, Carol Burnett, Harvey Korman, Dorothy Lyman, Ken Berry (How was it ever canceled in the first place?) I really liked the kids Buzz and Sonja, too.

The reason I am knocking a star off the score is that these episodes are edited.  They are like the syndication edits that are still aired all the time. What's up with that??!!  I've been waiting to see these episodes uncut for years.  I know how much they've cut because I have an audio recording of ""The Wedding Part 1"" from when it aired back around 1985 (a rerun even, not the first airing which was 2/5/83):

1. They cut out the part about the hoochie coochie dancer in the kitchen scene with Mama, Buzz, and Vint.

2. When Sonja asked if she was a slave, Fran's comeback line ""If you were, you would've been sold years ago"" is gone.

3. Mama explaining to Sonja that ""strong drink can make even the daintiest of ladies seem unattractive and crude"" (and then hic-ups from the beer) got the ax.

4. The scene with Mama and Fran in the kitchen is shortened.

5. They cut out Mama talking about seeing her husband Carl naked out of the shower. She shoved him in the linen closet and never looked again.

6. A lot of dialogue about the controversy over Eunice's ""O Promise Me"" solo is missing.

7.  And the worst omission of all:  Eunice screaming ""Well All Right!!!"" after Mama exclaimed, ""This is my house and I say there ain't gonna be no da*n singing!"" isn't there!  I've been looking forward to seeing that scene again which always seems to be cut in syndication.

These are just what is cut out of one episode! And the tags during the closing credits are missing, too. I definitely would have paid more money to get these episodes uncut, wouldn't you?  Anyway, here are the episodes from Season 1:

""Vint and the Kids Move In"": Vint and the kids are kicked out of their house and they have to move in with Mama.

""For Better or For Worse"": ""Her! Him! Here!"" Mama hyperventilates when she finds out Naomi and Vint spent the night together down in the basement.  Vint and Naomi then decide to get married and run a trailer park in Arizona.

""The Wedding Part 1"":  While getting ready for the wedding to be held a Mama's showplace, Eunice takes delight in telling sister Ellen the truth about her husband and his secretary.

""The Wedding Part 2"": Eunice slightly changes her rendition of ""O Promise Me"" after she finds out Mama gave Vint her father's sapphire ring.  Later, Vint and Naomi discover there trailer park plans were a rip-off and they have to move in with Mama again.

""Family Feud"": The Harpers ""wind up"" on Family Feud.  Richard Dawson is a guest.

""Cellmates"":  Eunice and Mama find themselves in jail with a prostitute who gets them to consider their mother/daughter relationship.  This is the episode where Eunice finds out Mama sent her dream man Duke Reeves away when she was in high school.

""Mama Gets A Job"": Mama gets a job at a travel agency and her family keeps bugging her a work.  I like the part where she's learning how to answer the phones: ""It's a great day here at the Raytown Travel Agency!  May I heeelp you?!""

""Double Standard"":  Sonja gets all women's rights when she finds out her younger brother has a longer curfew.

""Mama's Boyfriend"": Mama shocks her family when she plans on spending a weekend in a cabin by the lake with an old flame.

""Fran's Dress"": Mama accidentally ruins Fran's priced dress she plans on wearing to an awards banquette.

""Alien Marriage"":  In another get-rich-quick scheme, Vint plans on marrying a Portuguese woman to get her a green card.  In this episode, Naomi and Vint are not married yet.  Naomi is still Mama's complaining neighbor.  Anyway, Mama really goes off in this one!  Great shouting scene including a nice argument between Mama and her flighty, old maid sister Fran.

""Positive Thinking"":  One of the funniest episodes.  Eunice starts listening to positive thinking tapes and gets a role in a play.  Great Eunice line: ""I just decked the entire cast over there at the Pepperpot Playhouse!""

""Mama's Silver"": Vint pawns Mama's precious sterling.",1163203200,129,4308,4.651193633952254

1568527,4,B00005JP3M,"""Mama's Family"" is an occasionally very funny sitcom that debuted on NBC in January 1983 as a mid-season replacement during the 1982-83 TV season. Here's a show that began as a series of sketches on the classic ""Carol Burnett Show"". These uproarious skits revolved around an abrasive southern woman named Eunice (played by Burnett) who along with husband Ed (played by Harvey Korman) was constantly at odds with her cantankerous mother (played by Vicki Lawrence). This comedy sketch (which became known as ""Ed & Eunice"") ran occasionally for years on ""The Carol Burnett Show"" (which in reruns is now known as ""Carol Burnett and Friends""), and turned out to be one of the most popular sketches of the long-running comedy/variety show.

""Mama's Family"" debuted five years after ""The Carol Burnett Show"" went off the air. Vicki Lawrence reprised her role as Mama (aka Thelma Harper), with Burnett and Korman reprising their Eunice and Ed roles but only in a couple of guest appearances. This show was going to be a little different from the sketches that appeared on Burnett's variety series, because it was going to revolve less around Eunice and Ed, and more around the other members of Mama's family. In the first  episode of ""Mama's Family"" were introduced to Mama's sister Fran (Rue McClanahan), her son Vint (Ken Berry), her teenage grandchildren Buzz and Sonja (Eric Brown and Karin Argoud), and her next-door neighbor Naomi (Dorothy Lyman). Also turning up in episode one is Mama's other daughter Ellen (Betty White), who was a recurring character in the ""Ed & Eunice"" sketches on ""The Carol Burnett Show"" and would show up here several times on ""Mama's Family"".

As the series starts, Mama lives in a house with Fran in the city of Raytown. Then Vint and his kids Buzz and Sonja move in with Mama and Fran after his wife runs off to Las Vegas to become a showgirl. Then Vint falls in love with neighbor Naomi, marries her, and in the process she moves into the house too (this after their plan to move to Arizona backfires through a crooked scheme). Through all of this the cranky Mama practically has verbal battles with just about everyone, including Eunice, Ed, and Ellen whenever they stop by for a visit. That's what ""Mama's Family"" is all about: this noisy clan with a matriarch constantly arguing with her family members about all the shenanigans that go on in and out of the household.

This leads to some very funny episodes. The two part episode titled The Wedding (episodes 3 & 4) is uproarious. It's the one where Vint and Naomi get married, and everyone is there for the event (including Eunice, who as usual gets angry with her family members who end up ticking her off over certain things). The best and funniest episode of season one is episode 5: Family Feud. This is the one where Mama, Vint, Naomi, Ellen, and Buzz fly out to California to appear on the classic game show, and end up making fools of themselves (especially Mama, who doesn't know how to play the game right). Richard Dawson, the original host of Family Feud, guest stars as himself and is hilarious. Another funny episode is episode 7: Mama Gets a Job. In this one, Mama gets a job at the Raytown Travel Agency and all hell breaks loose. Episode 11: Alien Marriage, is another explosively funny episode. Here, Vint agrees to marry a Portuguese woman so she can obtain a green card and live in the United States, and when Mama finds out what's going on the fur starts to fly big time as Mama proceeds to yell at just about everyone, especially Vint.

All 13 episodes of ""Mama's Family"": Season One is for the most part very funny and are worth seeing again. But one thing disappointed me about the episodes that appear in this DVD set: they're the edited episodes that have appeared in rerun syndication, not the original uncut episodes that aired on NBC. I was really hoping to see these episodes of ""Mama's Family"" uncut again, but that's not the case with this DVD. I remembered watching episodes of ""Mama's Family"" when they first aired on NBC when I was a kid, and one of the things that appeared at the beginning of some episodes were special appearances by Harvey Korman who turned up not as Ed but in another role as Alistair Quince, who introduced episodes as if they were a part of a Masterpiece Theatre-type presentation. These quirky introductions were never seen in reruns, and they're not seen here on DVD either. But that's not all. Other scenes have been cut. Take for example my favorite episode Family Feud. After Richard Dawson finishes introducing the opposing family (whose first names all end alike) that's taking on the Harpers, you can hear Mama saying that the whole family is named after puppets while Mr. Dawson continues to talk to the patriarch of that family just before going over to introduce the Harper clan. Another scene that's cut in this episode is the moment where it's Vint's turn to go up to the buzzer to play the next round and hesitates because he's too nervous, and Mama angrily forces him up to go up there because it was his idea to get on the show. In the DVD version of this episode, you can tell there's an edit because when he goes up there, you hear Mr. Dawson tell him ""you're fine."" Also when the question that Vint is asked (""name something that comes in flakes""), Vint responds by saying: ""Cereal. That's what I had for breakfast. Cereal."" One of the lines that's edited in that scene where Vint doesn't want to go up there, he mentions that his mind is so blank to the point where he can't even remember what he had for breakfast that morning. So the edits are quite obvious.

Still, there are a lot of laughs on ""Mama's Family"". Vicki Lawrence is a hoot in the lead as Mama, and has a great supporting cast behind her. It's great to watch Betty White and Rue McClanahan working together here just before they both went on to ""The Golden Girls"". Dorothy Lyman is hilarious as the flirtatious Naomi. At the time Lyman was doing ""Mama's Family"", she was also starring on the popular ABC soap opera ""All My Children"", and the role she played on that show (the argumentative Opal) was kind of similar to her Naomi role (she won a daytime Emmy for ""All My Children"" in 1983). Lyman doesn't appear in all 13 episodes of season one, probably because she was working on ""All My Children"" and ""Mama's Family"" at the same time. Nevertheless, whenever Lyman does appear, she's very funny. Eric Brown and Karin Argoud are fun as the teenagers of the household. And Carol Burnett and Harvey Korman are always a welcome presence whenever they turn up (Korman also does double duty as co-director of 11 episodes). The only weak link in the cast is Ken Berry, who's only adequately funny as the lazy, dim-witted Vint. He's O.K. in the role. It's just that the other characters that surround him are more funnier.

""Mama's Family"": Season One delivers plenty of laughs for fans of the series. And I'm eagerly anticipating season two, which will have more episodes.",1160956800,9,6993,4.662074554294976

However- it is something and I won't rate it horribly, because it is like watching it on TV. But to call it the ""Complete"" first Season is a misnomer, and terribly misleading.

The original NBC openings, and Alistar Quince sequences have not been included in this release. There are no special features and the DVD runs approximately at 278 minutes. With 13 episodes in all!!!!! Even though they are the syndicated cuts I still recommend you to buy this set, Warner does not own the original cuts.

With being over 20 years old, this show is still as funny if not FUNNIER than the shows that are on today. Jokes are still laughable and not out of date, as is with many sitcoms of the past (Leave it to Beaver). Please note the episodes appear out of order on this set.

First of all, there are no extras on the dvd, no original opening, and most importantly no complete episodes.  All of these episodes are exactly as they are shown on tv, with a few minutes cut out of each.  I find it very deceiving, the front of the case says complete first season.  How can they call it the complete first season if they are the episodes that have been cut down for syndication?  I hope that if they do come out with a set of the second season, they will include full episodes and some bonus material, otherwise there is no way I would buy it.

Added to cast was Ken Berry, Dorothy Lymon and Rue McClanahan. with special guest appearance by Carol Burnett, Harvey Korman and Betty White. One would wonder why Tim Conway wasn't asked to guest star.

Now the problem, these thirteen first season episodes are finely cut as they are syndicated versions. It seem jokes are missing, lines are cut-seems like this is a rough cut of the shows..this edited piece is fun, but it could be better, especially for the price you pay.

This dvd set is just like watching them on tv, exactly what I wanted and expected. So if you're looking for bonus features and all that, you will be dissapointed.

BUT we should all remember that, to Warner Home Video, a boycott from buying this DVD will only mean a lack of interest in the show and no season 2 will be issued.  Warner will only consider a season 2 if season 1 sells well.  So a boycott could do more harm than good.  Warner Home Video will not see a boycott as a dissatisfaction of their product from the fans, only complaints will do that.",1159315200,10,604,4.454545454545454
1568713,1,B00005JP3M,"As a loyal fan of ""Mama's Family"" for years and years, I thought no one was more thrilled than me that this series was finally seeing the light of day on DVD.

But Warner Bros. did a sloppy job by giving this show the barest of releases, so why should they get my money?

They won't.

And as you can see, I am not alone---the fans are speaking out.

It's awful enough that they couldn't even bother to put the complete episodes on the discs. But no Special Features? Give me a break, how pathetic.

Where is the original opening theme song, not seen since the original broadcast?

Where are the introductory segments of Harvey Korman as Alastair Quince, also not seen since said broadcasts?

Where is the ""Eunice"" TV movie?

Where are any ""Family"" sketches from ""The Carol Burnett Show""?

Where is the clip of Vicki Lawrence winning her Emmy award for ""The Carol Burnett Show"" in 1976, which she won partially for her portrayal of Mama?

Where is the gag reel of bloopers?

Where are any cast or crew interviews/documentaries?

Where are any commentaries?

ANY of those would have been very welcome Special Features for the fans. And while I'm at it, where is season 2? Since only seasons 1 and 2 were on NBC, why not release both seasons packaged together---since they have Fran, Eunice, Ellen, Buzz, and Sonja---complete and with extra goodies, and then you could tout the season 3 release as the ""new phase"" of the show with Bubba and Iola, since seasons 3 through 6 were a bit different in syndication. Season 1 has only 13 episodes, Season 2 has 22, and the others have over 20. So it would have made much more sense to squeeze 1 and 2 together---the NBC years---and then release the remaining four seasons separately.

I have news for you, Warner. You can't simply put out a mundane release and have the fans not notice. We're making our voices heard that we want full, unedited releases packed with special features---what this show deserves---and what there it could be.

I strongly encourage everyone disappointed in this to write and call Warner Bros. (more effective than e-mail) and voice your frustration, disappointment, and refusal to buy:

1568715,1,B00005JP3M,"10/02/06 Surprisingly enough, I received a personal e-mail from Waner Brothers Home Video, explaining the Mama's Family situation.  Now, I am very disappointed that this is an edited, watered down, syndicated version of the first season, but Warner Brothers has informed me that they do not own the rights to the first run episodes that were aired on NBC in the early eighties, only the syndicated versions that have been shown on TBS and more recently the i network.  My response to them was, of course, if you are selling edited releases, the packaging should clearly reflect this.  A series cannot be advertised as Complete if several minutes of footage are missing from each episode.  I realize that some reviewers are satisfied with the edited versions, however, I am not, and will be selling my copy to the local used book store, and hoping that sometime in the future, the original first-run episodes will be made available for release.  So, for those of you looking for a complete second season, that is unedited, it looks like you might as well hang it up.  Warner Brothers doesn't own the rights, so don't expect to see anything but an edited, syndicated version of the second season, as well...",1159228800,9,1205,4.825242718446602

Warner needs to get some people in there who care about the products they are selling and packaging.. furthermore they should've released SEASON 1 + 2 as one set instead of the small 13 episode first season. Now that I know these episodes are cut I WILL NOT buy this set. MAybe Warners can correct the error .. or even go one better give the full episosdes in a Season 1 + 2 Box set.

Harvey Korman played Alistair Quince, who introduced (and I think closed) each episode.  The full version of ""Mama's Family"" has not been seen since it first ran on NBC.  I for one was so excited to finally see the full episodes again..... BUT!!!

NO... these episodes are edited down by a few minutes each in their butchered, syndicated, ""I can see it on TV like this everyday"" form.

I am so disappointed and feel so cheated.  If I would have found out sooner I would have canceled my pre-order but it's now too late.  Warner Bros. has some major explaining to do.

1568720,1,B00005JP3M,"I was extremely excited when this underrated gem of 1980s TV was announced for DVD, but then I saw the review on Sitcoms Online. The DVDs are not complete, not by a long shot.

The NBC era episodes originally ran about 24 to 25 minutes and featured introductions by Harvey Korman as a character called ""Alastair Quince,"" spoofing Masterpiece Theater's Alastair Cooke. These are gone, along with three minutes of footage from each episode. They now run 21 minutes, as they do in syndication. The later episodes (seasons 3-6, which were first-run syndication) ran at this length originally, but the first 2 seasons did not. Enough footage is gone to equal about one and one half of an episode.

After the debacles with ALF, The Cosby Show, and Roseanne on DVD one would think that Warner would have tried to avoid this. Nope. They just slapped on edited episodes and hope fans wouldn't notice. That they didn't include the original 1982 special ""Eunice"" which spawned this show, nor any of the Carol Burnett Show sketches which inspired it, is bad enough. But this disc fails to meet the minimum standard of presentation.

Do not buy this DVD. You need to write to Warner Bros. and tell them you will not buy this show in an edited version. Tell them you want season 1 reissued in its original, uncut, network version and then you will buy it, and that all future releases must be released in their original form. Buying this product sends a message that cutting corners is acceptable.",1159142400,97,1483,4.718146718146718

(not to mention the horrible audio/video quality here and lack of special features.)

i know ""mama's family"" is not exactly high art, but this is still a fun show with a fanbase that this dvd set is allegedly supposed to be geared toward.  if we fans don't boycott this kind of ruined product, we'll never get seasons 2+ released the way they were originally written, shot, and broadcast.  when fans put the pressure on rhino to release the second season of ""too close for comfort"" uncut after they'd released the first season cut -- guess what ?

1568805,5,B00005JP3M,"Mama's Family was one of the enduring 1980s sitcoms that never received any respect from critics. The ""Hooterville"" aspect and often slight plotlines caused a lot of disdainful scorn. What these critics missed, and what audiences loved, however, were the outstanding characterizations. The first few seasons, some of those characterizations took awhile to evolve (but never less than entertaining); Mama for example was none too bright at first, but luckily, she later became the sassy, bossy voice of reason that held the family together. Vicki Lawrence really had a faultless, masterful command of this character. It is a classic TV personage. Her Mama's perpetual crankiness, all from a skilfully limned comic timing, was flawless. Lawrence had all the classic irascible old-lady mannerisms down pat. Ken Berry's Vint evolved from being slightly tedious to a truly funny, lovable goofball who was always tripping over himself. Dorothy Lyman's endearing sex kitten Naomi got funnier and sexier with each succeeding season; Lyman was an impeccable comedienne. Carol Burnett's Eunice added a shockingly bitter, but funny edge to the first season. Betty White's Ellen was a delightful I-don't-want-to-be-seen-with-my-family upper class, Seville-driving snob. Rue McLanahan didn't quite work as Aunt Fran (the character was too ambiguously drawn): she found a much better role as the nymphomaniac Blanche in The Golden Girls. Vint's kids in the first season did OK, but they never really found their niche in the ensemble. Allan Kayser's Bubba was the perfect replacement as Eunice's juvenile hall son. He added an edgy, youthful countenance that the show needed, and for Mama to play off of. Beverly Archer's hilariously anachronistic Iola was an absolute hoot: she brought the perfect nosy- neighbor, awful-crafts-making characterization to the show. Best of all, this cast played off each other like true pros. There was a true sense of the ensemble spirit that only comes from a mutual self-respect amongst the actors. They made it look so easy and effortless, one might have a tendency to see only the zany, sometimes thin plots to overlook just how indelibly formed all the characters were. Often, nothing major happened in the Harper's lives; they were lower-middle class citizens who had rummage sales, church suppers, etc. But the cast brought a true down-home quality to the show, and most importantly, they made it funny - how?? By playing the comedy absolutely straight. No schticking, no ""Oh look at me I'm funny"" behavior. These are talented, professional farceurs who knew exactly what they were doing. You realize, after all the bad sitcoms that came and sank without a trace, why this one survived. There was a reason this series endured for 8 seasons, and why it continues to win new fans in syndication: it was one of the best, unheralded sitcoms of the 1980s. Great to see it on DVD at last, and hope that WB will follow through quickly with the remaining seasons. No doubt about it: this series will sell.",1157155200,18,3024,5.173469387755102

However, one standout episode I recall was a flash-back to Mama's 30th birthday.  We saw Vint, Ellen and Eunice as children.  The child actress chosen to play Eunice was outstanding.  Same dress as Carol's, same hairstyle, it was Carol's ""Mini-me.""

There was another episode in syndication which featured another flashback and Eunice was around 17.  Again, the actress chosen to play Eunice was great.  Again, same dress, same hair.

What makes this show great to me was that it was the first time in my life as a television viewer where I saw characters with flaws and all. Nothing was ever really solved by the end of each episode. The characters were memorable for their clothes or lack of fashion sense and their style. It was nice to see people who weren't rich, educated, or sophisticated like the Harpers. They were like a lot of families then and now in America. Struggling to make ends meet. They didn't look perfect and they weren't smart enough but we loved them anyway.

This classic sitcom is all about laughs and boy are they big laughs. Mama/Thelma Harper is played by Vicki Lawerence and does an amazing job, as the wise cracking,old fashion, yet modern grandmother. She has the spunk that makes you not want the show to end. Vint played by Ken Berry is astoundingly funny, in a knuckle head kind of away. Vint is Thelma's son that lives at home, with Naomi his second wife. Also in the first season Vint's kids live there. But Iola takes the cake as the nosy/perky neigbor in love with Vint, played by Beverly Archer. She like Vicki Lawerence is a comic genius and together they are quite a pair. Of course you will see many guests stars and few huge actors in season one such a Betty White and Carole Burnett. Raytown is the fictional city where all the hoopla takes place and it may be small town middle America, but the high jinks are non stop fun.

I have been waiting forever for this series to get a DVD release.  Especially Season One, which by far, was the best season of the series, thanks in large part to the brilliant appearances of Eunice, played by Carol Burnett.

Season One also features regular appearances by Betty White and Rue McClanahan, both of whom jumped shipped during the second season to star in one of the most successful sitcoms in history, The Golden Girls.

1569026,5,B00005JP3M,"i have been watching this hilarious show for years and i hope they release it on dvd soon! i know this show has alot of fans. they just don't make good shows like this anymore. this has got to be my favorite show of all time followed by golden girls. the show is about thelma harper a grandma who won't take any [...] from nobody, her peabrain son vinton, his wife naomi(who mama constantly refers to as a tramp) her best friend Iola and her grandson from reform school bubba. the first few years were great with betty and rue but nothing can top the syndicated series. my favorite episodes have got to be when mama has her pool party outside and thinks naomi and vincent are up to something(stop it stop it stop it), or when naomi has her baby( i know i know i know),when mama and her family have to babysit the preacher's bratty grandson(well, i cant hit him when he's behind the door), when mama's dead mother pays her a visit(get back in there and scrub them hands good), when iola and mama plan a single cruise and iola has to stay with them(fine by me, because with you gone, they're the ugliest things in the room),
when mama gets hit over the head with the pan(its the berries you tramp), and many many more. each episode is a gem. Even the facial expressions Vicki Lawrence does is hilarious! Please release this on dvd soon!!!!!!!!!",1149465600,9,1342,4.393574297188755
