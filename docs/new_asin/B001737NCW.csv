The exercises and clear instruction on the strokes, exercises and rhythms are really tightening up and enhancing my play.  An excellent DVD.",1282348800,2,305,5.586956521739131
3167268,4,B001737NCW,"I am halfway through Karim Nagi's first DVD, and it is the best of its kind I have yet seen either in DVD or on the Web.  Nagi offers some good basic drum exercises, followed by what he does best--a clear presentation of rhythm versus ornamentation.  Interestingly, he starts with teaching you a handful of basic ornaments before he gets to some fundamental Arabic rhythms.  As a result, the fundamental distinction between rhythm and ornament becomes clear in the drummer's mind.  With each new rhythm, the ornaments are then added in the order they were originally learned.  At the end, he invites you to combine them all.  The problem with this DVD may simply be that it is indeed a DVD and not a private lesson.  What Nagi should do, but does not, is to invite the viewer to hit the pause button frequently so that he or she can practice at his or her own speed and, most of all, slow down and take things apart at a much slower count than Nagi races through.  In particular, what he calls the ""running"" ornament can be very confusing if you don't takes things very slow at first to see which hand ends up doing what.  A drum student with previous hand drum experience of any kind will already know to do this, but someone completely new to drumming might give up in confusion and blame him/herself for being uncoordinated and untalented.  Because Nagi does not quite reach out enough to the novice drummer I give him four starts instead of five.  However, having said that I do recommend his DVD.  I also have his second, and look forward to working through it.  In the end I think we all need to seek out live lessons with teachers--I'm sure Karim Nagi would be the first to agree with that--but if like me you live in a remote area, this DVD series makes for a very good start if you use it well.",1264809600,10,1803,4.410876132930514
3167269,5,B001737NCW,"Rhythms of the Arab World Part 1 is easily the most professional and helpful DVD for learning Arabic/Middle Eastern drumming that I've bought, and, believe me, I've seen quite a few of the offerings on the market.

Besides having top-notch production values in terms of lighting, sound, titles, scripting, etc., the video excels at teaching not just technique and rhythms, but also stresses playing with musicality to bring the music alive.  And it's all laid out very logically and clearly.

First, Karim demonstrates the different stroke techniques (doum, ka, tak, slap or sak), and his strokes are extremely clean and crisp, not the sloppy-slappy sounds that other teachers pass off as strokes.  In this section, he demonstrates a fantastic trick for learning the notoriously difficult weak-hand tek or ka sound, and this was a joyous breakthrough for me as it was the first time someone on a drumming video explained exactly how to do it.

Next come a variety of fills and embellishments, and these are laid out very nicely with lots of examples and tips.

Next, Karim demonstrates many of the foundation rhythms for the Arabic drum, but rather than dryly marching through each rhythm, he presents each via a solo, a kind of miniature performance piece, that starts out slowly, builds in intensity and excitement, and finally ends in an inventive and exhilarating way.  A student would do well to take note of how each piece builds and develops:  Karim seems to have an excellent sense of which fill patterns and embellishments are the most effective and exciting as the rhythm develops and builds, with the end result being a collection of solos that I can only describe as very satisfying and  instructive for anyone's compositions.

Overall, this is a marvelously useful and entertaining DVD, and there's a generous amount of material here, enough certainly to guide a student from a beginning to an intermediate level.  From there, I'd recommend  Part 2 of Karim Nagi's ""Rhythms of the Arab World"" to build on the solid foundation laid here.",1247356800,21,2049,4.9941176470588236
3167270,5,B001737NCW,"I am a beginner and I don't have anyone close that teaches how to play a doumbek so I am doing all my learning from DVDs and CDs. This DVD provides a good foundation, excellent exercises and some basic rhythms.

It starts with how to hold a doumbek and shows you how to play the dum, tek, ka (weak hand tek) and sak sounds.

The exercises start slow and then speed up as they go along. Typically there are 4 different speeds so you learn how to hold the beat at different speeds.

Next you learn five basic ornaments (fills) to add variety to basic rhythms. Then you learn the basic rhythms and get to practice each rhythm with the ornaments with the ornaments you learned earlier. Finally Karim teaches rolls and how to switch between rhythms.

Karim teaches Ayoub. Saudi, Masmudi (Baladi), Maqsum, Malfuf, Wahda, Saidi and Sudasi on this DVD.

When I started working with this DVD I was only able to play at the slowest speed for the exercises and I thought I would never get a good ka sound. Now after only a month of practicing 5 hours a week with this DVD I am able to keep all but the fastest beats and still sound good. I recommend this DVD along with Souhail Kasper's and Amir Maoum's beginning DVDs.",1238803200,10,1208,4.375
3167271,5,B001737NCW,Karim explains the techniques so well that anyone whom dares to pick up the drum will def. achieve something.

I'm a dancer and not a drummer but this even helps me familiarize with the dance beats. I give this a A+!,1212537600,3,330,4.171875

This one is great for learning the sounds, technique, rhythms, and ornaments, but in addition to all that, he teaches how to fit the ornamentation into the rhythms and how to change from one rhythm to another! I've been enjoying practicing regularly with it. Thank you, Karim!",1475280000,,309,4.7407407407407405

8264817,4,B001737NCW,"With excellent sound and production values this is a great instructional DVD. Its always best to have live instruction for the feedback and correction of technique from teacher, but this is a good place for a beginner to start.  Karim's demonstrations of techniques are clear and easy to understand and the sounds on the DVD sound like what you hear in a live setting.  Watch his hands as he plays, compare them to what is behind them: the drum and his button line on his shirt. Karim's hands are striking the drum in the same place every time. As stated in other reviews he does move along quickly, and there isn't much in the way of graphics showing you a rhythm.  I have been playing doumbek, riqq and frame drum for about 7 yrs with weekly instruction, I bought this DVD and the second one to supplement what I already know, and I am not disappointed. If you are a beginner, don't get discouraged with how quick these DVDs progress, learn and practice what you can, save the rest for later as you improve your skills.",1418428800,,1021,4.478494623655914

8264820,5,B001737NCW,"I recently became interested in the doumbek and bought some instructional DVDs to help me figure it out. I purchased Amir's first, and it was pretty good but not instructive enough. He just does a quick briefing of technique and then demonstrates some of the rhythms.
Then I ordered Karim's 1st DVD and Carmine's DVD. I knew I wanted to play this drum well and needed to learn how.
Carmine's DVD was just like sitting in on a pretty basic workshop, a lot of people all doing basic patterns together. If you want a drum circle feel in your own home this may be the one. However...
Karim Nagi's DVD blew me out of the water! He rocks that doumbek like he was born with it. Plus, he's a gifted educator as well. He explains all the techniques and shows you step-by-step, how to get the sounds right.
I highly recommend his DVD. In fact, if you only want one, his is the one you want.
I have already purchased his second DVD, even though I have much (much, much, much) to practice with the first. I just couldn't wait to hear more! (spoiler alert- He demonstrates how to drum for a belly dancer! I'm down with that ;p )",1379635200,,1115,4.314285714285714
8264821,4,B001737NCW,"I recommend this product to all beginner level players and to all intermediate players who are looking for different rhythms and approach.

Pros:
- Good video and audio record.
- The instructor is a master in his Arabic technique.
- Very clear explanations about the strokes and rhythms.
- His attitude is very warm.

Cons:
- His technique is traditional Arabic technique. If you are looking for a modern and promising technique like Turkish technique (split finger technique) you will be dissappointed.",1346716800,,503,5.121951219512195
8264822,4,B001737NCW,"This product was great for learning the basics. He should have shown the names of the rhythms in writing the whole time he was playing so that it would have been easier to memorize. He was a little too quick on the more advanced stuff, but if you have fairly good rhythm you could figure it out.",1324252800,,295,4.192982456140351
