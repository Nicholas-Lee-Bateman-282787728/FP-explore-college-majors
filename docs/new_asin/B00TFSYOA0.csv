8701577,1,B00TFSYOA0,I've watched 30 seconds of the movie and I can tell it's in terrible quality looks like it was recorded in EP speed. Looks like Amazon is saying that when sold on demand they  made it  DVD-R recordable media which that must mean Amazon  made and shipped it with bad quality I cannot believe I paid $17 that's pathetic. It is a very good love story none the less I like the movie.,1532736000,,379,4.164383561643835
