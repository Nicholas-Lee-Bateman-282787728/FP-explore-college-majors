8763339,5,B01GQROZJW,"Angry Video Game Nerd or for short AVGN just keeps getting better! A informative show of past video games that are really, and I can't express really bad! I enjoy learning about the history of different consults and game controllers! His fresh look into awful games is just as refreshing as a old fart joke! I don't know who creates his dvd's of his show, and that's another story. Its impressing to see that over the seasons how the dvd set have improvement. Wouldn't like to know who is graphing the dvd's? If its the creator of AVGN, then its understandable and as each seasons pass, we get to see new improvements! As for the show it self! No words can not say how well done it is! I just love it! Not only it catches my interests, but the evolution as the show progress makes me keep coming back for more! The is meant to be comical, but informative as well! Sure the games are crapy! Some, Idk what the game creators was thinking! Maybe they was just a rush job!

Topics I enjoy the most are these two!
Godzilla  I really enjoy the classic NES but I never fig out how to get further into the game. Which really suxs monkey butts. What got my mind was a little preview of other Godzilla games I never heard off!
Castlevania Parts 1 - 4   Love the review of the games! I love the first think its one of the hardest and beaten it a few times. The third for NES, I thought it was much easier to play. I beat that game at a good rate. There few choices to make but if your smart! You fig out the easiest choice to beat the game! Learning about the history of the games is a wonderful expertise as well!",1475798400,,1603,4.17799352750809
