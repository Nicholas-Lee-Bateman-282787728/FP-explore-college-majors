7887208,1,6305280673,"I ended up in a lousy movie from the late 80's, with a talk a lot more than necessary narrator. A psycho talking car (where did I hear that before, no need to answer, anyone who has heard of the mostly lousy movies made from King's novel knows the answer). An evil thing growing in a fridge (where have I seen that, asides from three lousy 80's movies, it was a theme). And some desperate female doing something crazy, as in using a dating site to get herself in a mess. Where have I heard that before asides from countless movies from when dating crazy people who you don't know, became popular, which was a long time ago. Lets just say it has all done before, which was another common 80's theme, but better. But, some people seem to like it, believe them and see if you actually like it.",1507939200,,790,4.273333333333333

7887211,5,6305280673,"Three half-hour stories combined into a trilogy. The common thread is the three protagonists share a bus ride ""that can take you places you
can't even imagine"".

The Classic
The first story is about a classic MG that talks - but only its owner can hear HIM. A possed car - John Carpenter's Christine, anyone ? The car's
voice reminds me of the God voice over character in ""A World without Men""...  However this car is more of a Cyrano de Bergerac character -
telling the guy what to tell his gal to win her back...

Kitchen Culture
The second story line is original - a guy's old tuna casserole turns into a creature growing inside his fridge and taking over his life.  An original
idea and a good script make this one well worth watching. The make-up special effects on the creature is a site to behold.

Too Good To Be True
The third story was also original for its time  ( although the trilogy was released on video in 1991, this segment was shot in 1987 ), a gal is
looking for Mr. Right by buying into the Perfect Match Computer Dating Service.  Their computer holds a big database of potential dates. The
interviewer explains how their service helped thousands of people so far.  ( Computer dating started in the late 60s. They were using big IBM
mainframes. See an article from The Harvard Crimson of  November 3, 1965 written by T. JAY Mathews )
The dating service finds Mr. Right until she catches him making a phone call ...  And his arm starts to twitch while bowling...  and he turns out to
be a know it all...  but worst of all - she finds out how  the Perfect Match Computer Dating Service find their perfect match!

7887212,3,6305280673,"Here we go with a lower budget film from the early 90s. I came across the DVD of this at a flea market, I was intrigued by the DVD cover, showing a green zombie like man who looked like he was jumping up at someone, and it was only $1.00, so I said ""ah, what the hell lets check this out"", so I watched ""With Friends Like These"", and now, Ill tell you the plots. (By ""plots"", I mean the movie is a trilogy)

Story #1: Story number one is virtually the exact same plot as John Carpenter's Christine, where a guy purchases a car, thats pretty much possessed. (Literally, that IS the plot of Christine)

Story #2: Story number two is very odd, its some punky looking dude who has the green moster (as shown on the cover) living in his fridge. I couldn't believe what I was seeing at first.

Story #3: Story number three is a woman trying out a dating website who pretty much gets set up with a crazy dude.

All the stories open with our protagonists getting off of a bus. That should've been the title of the movie ""Death Bus"", the only problem is that the bus will only have been seen for like seven minutes total. Theres a narrator with an annoying voice taking us through the events, which I thought the film could've done without. But since this was a very low-budget film, Ill give it the benefit of the doubt:

I give it a 3/5, but most people will probably not like it  was what I did.",1284768000,,1389,4.1835205992509366

7887215,5,6305280673,"i don't know know how to start to explain the magnificence of this piece of motion cinema. one word i suppose would be breathtaking, another would be ahead of its time. it simply is a must see piece of film.and always available at a reasonble price.if there were more films like this on display to the public the world would be a better place.",1045958400,3,343,4.375
7887216,1,6305280673,"This film tries hard, very hard to be fun, clever, and scary but fails on all accounts...
The stories are very poorly written, and acted even more poorly. There isn't a single scare to be found, except when the movie is over and you realize you wasted 90 good minutes of your life watching this...
The second story is mildly amusing, if only to see the food to come to life in the fridge. But after that, it's all downhill. WAY downhill.
Its amazing to think that someone, somewhere read this script and thought it was a good enough idea to put money into. Hey, if you're reading this, I have a script I'd love to sell you...
For the horror buffs, just say no to this...and move on. Not worth even a passing glance.",1034035200,3,715,4.303703703703704
