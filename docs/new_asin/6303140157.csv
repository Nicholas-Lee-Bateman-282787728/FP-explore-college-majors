606123,4,6303140157,"""Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit"" takes place shortly after the first film. Deloris finds herself back in her nun guise at the request of the Reverend mother when asked to teach a music class at a failing Catholic school. But, there's a few problems the class is rowdy and disrespectful and is lead by a head strong and stubborn teenage girl (Lauryn Hall). Desperate to turn the school around Deloris decides to change the curriculum and turn the music class into a choir, but will she be successful or will the students and staff find out her true identity? Most of the main cast returned including Maggie Smith, Kathy Najimi, Wendy Makkena (singing voice provided by Andrea Robinson) and Mary Wickes. Newcomers to the cast include Michael Jeter, Brad Sullivan and Jennifer ""Love"" Hewitt. While the film did not manage to gross as much as its predecessor it was a modest box office hit. ""Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit"" is a fun, feel good family film.",1499040000,,954,4.617647058823529

606486,1,6303140157,"The original Sister Act is a movie I love and watch over and over as I have it on DVD.  I had never seen this sequel because I heard it was terrible, but curiosity got the better of me and I decided to rent it.  Well, everyone was right, it is terrible.  Whoopi Goldberg is always great, but the plot is so weak, boring, and predictable, that her acting can't really save it.  Also, I love Maggie Smith and was disappointed that she is actually hardly in this one, seemed like they put her in just enough to list her as being in the cast so people who love her would come see it.  So, I am sorry to say I can not recommend this and I will be basically wiping it from my memory so that the wonderful movie that is the original Sister Act will remain untainted.  Save your money and go watch the original Sister Act again.",1466035200,,820,4.09375

606528,3,6303140157,"I don't know why they bothered to call this sequel Sister Act 2 when most of the sisters aren't present and those who are ended up in supporting roles, rarely seen or heard from.  Instead, theres Whoopi complaining about becoming Sister Mary Clarence again and a lot of angry teenagers.  As for the plot, it has been done to death with mixed results (and yet lazy writers will keep returning to this worn-out ploy of winning a contest to save the school).  James Coburn is wasted as a pseudo-villain.  Barnard Hughes basically takes over the head spot leaving Maggie Smith to wander around looking concerned.  Mary Wickes is shamefully wasted.  Instead of great fun and great music we get crabby teachers and nasty students and a few songs.  HUGE disappointment!",1465257600,,762,4.815384615384615

608310,3,6303140157,"This is a different movie in many respects, with the only common thread being Doloris Van Cartier aka Sister Mary Clarence (Whoopi Goldberg) and a couple of the other nuns, including Mother Superior (Maggie Smith). Before, Doloris was disguised as a nun involuntarily to keep her identity and location secret in a witness protection program. This time Mother Superior sends her old friends to fetch her from a headliner show in Las Vegas. She returns voluntarily to the habit in order to help save St. Francis Academy in San Francisco, where she went to school so disastrously as a child.

Also, this time she's not teaching nuns, she's teaching adolescents. That makes it a totally different story right there. What could be a simple remake of ""Going My Way"" or ""Angels with Dirty Faces"" is redeemed by the kids themselves. There's some very competent acting, and some truly excellent singing and dancing among these kids. The interaction with Sister Mary Clarence is great fun and very involving.

The story about a misanthropic school official (James Coburn) and a skeptical principal is just the frosting on the cake. Yes, the story is repleat with cliches, like the state-wide competition which will somehow save the school from being closed. But if you simply allow the story to be the trivia it really is, you can have a lot of fun, and find yourself rooting for the talented kids against all odds, even their well-intentioned but emotionally hardened mothers. We had to have one that had a mother who refused her permission. We had to have at least one person in the school who is openly against the school choir be converted at the last minute by how very talented they are, and they had to win the competition against impressive odds, largely due to a major pep-talk by Whoopi.

608486,5,6303140157,"I saw this movie when I was a substitute teacher.  I could feel Whoopi Goldberg's Sister Mary Clarence when she first walked into that out of control classroom.  The blatant disrespect they showed her was realistic.

The way she gained the class's respect made me pay attention.  It was what you would hope a good teacher would do.  As a matter of fact, the class and the teacher in this movie were based on a real teacher and her music class. I remember seeing the real teacher and her class on a talk show in 1995.

But the class in the movie had Lauryn Hill.  She lit up the screen as the attitudinal Rita Watson.  Her mother, portrayed by Sheryl Lee Ralph, had much to do with the Rita's poor attitude, we later find out.  Yet somehow, Sister Mary Clarence is able to get through to Rita and she is able to do what she does best--sing.

The singing in this movie is phenomenal!  The musical arrangements took this movie to another level than the original movie.  In fact, the scenes with just the nuns singing are flat and dull by comparison to the scenes with the teenagers.

There's a line in the movie, ""What she's done with those children is nothing short of miraculous.""  You get caught up in that `miraculous' watching the movie.  And you laugh.  And you cry.  And you want to watch it again and again and again.  That's why Sister Act 2 is one of the 7 happiest black movies of all time.",1192320000,,1398,4.352713178294573

SA1 has good music. But SA2 has Great music! The arrangements of

old standards like ""Joyful, Joyful"", ""Oh Happy Day"", ""His Eye is on the Sparrow"" by Roger Emerson are sheer genius. Remakes of Temptations, Supremes, and James Brown songs are great fun,

too. There are even some new numbers- and a little Aretha. But the assemblage of talent in the choir is first class-their enthusiam is absolutely contagious! The story line has been criticized by some reviewers, but I thought it was pretty good (different strokes, I guess). OK, so it's not Les Miserables- so what? It's great fun!

608608,1,6303140157,"This is dreadful. Sister Act was wonderful: original, funny, and heart-warming. Sister Act 2 is appalling in every way- the teenage characters are stereotypes, most of the jokes are bad cliches, and the storyline is like a fluffy, crappo version of Dangerous Minds. Worst of all, we don't get to see much of the characters we know and love from the first film- they are shunted to the background, and Whoopi Goldberg is expected to carry the whole feature- along with her idiotic, wooden, and unrealistic class of students of course. I also find Whoopi Goldberg's character's new preachiness unconvincing and hollow. In a nutshell? Thumbs down.",1136160000,5,644,5.02803738317757

I love both Sister Act movies, but purely for the songs. There's a slightly better storyline to the first one, but both films have great characters, and actors. Hands up who loves Maggie Smith? Whoopi is alright, but Lauryn Hill is kinda wooden in this I thought. She's better at singing than acting. Look out for Jennifer ""Love"" Hewitt (that's how she's credited) too, as a very made up student, who always seems to be missing from the dance numbers!

This movie will always have its critics, but it's a terrific, light hearted, ball of fluff, which won't harm or offend anyone. I like it. That's all that matters isn't it?

But it's still not worth 5 stars, like most reviewers on here.",1127952000,6,932,4.636363636363637

Sister Mary Clarence, a music teacher is back again to teach young and talented kids at St. Francis School in San Francisco. The sisters need her help and they're running out of ideas on how to stop the school from closing down. Finally, with a lot of PATIENCE, help and lots of encouragements the students proved to everybody by joining the competition that they're not just bunch of kids but they can do GOOD things through MUSIC and TEAMWORK. My favorite part of the movie when they started performing ""Joyful,Joyful"" with Lauryn Hill doing the intro I was blewn away.",1115856000,10,792,4.538461538461538
608701,3,6303140157,"In ""Sister Act 2: Back In The Habit"", Whoopi Goldberg returns as Sister Mary Clarence.  This time, she and the sisters work in a San Francisco High School to save the school from closing down by truning their music class into a chior.

I never found this film to be just as funny as the first ""Sister Act"" movie.  But there were a couple of great musical sequences, which ultimately saved this movie.  Whoopi with the classic rock/soul medley in the opening and the kids chior singing ""Joyful Joyful"", which I found to be pretty good.  I think the most important element about the second Sister Act movie was that several members of the kids chior went on to star in other movies, including Jennifer Love Hewitt and Alanna Urbach.  But the most notable in the kids chior was future Fugees member and grammy award winner Lauryn Hill.  Kathy Najimy, Mary Wickes, Wendy Makkena, James Coburn, Ryan Toy of the R&B group City High and Maggie Smith also star.",1109203200,15,953,4.603550295857988

The basic plot is the same as the first (""saving"" the kids the way whoopi's character was ""saved""; the mafia still chasing after whoopi's character).

zzzzzzz.....

Enjoy the first Sister Act and be happy. (btw--the kids don't sing. They do hiphop and rapping at the end of movie. Rapping, for those who don't know the difference, is not singing. Sorry folks!)",1103846400,4,539,4.836956521739131

Many of the scenes are very moving, including the ending sequence involving Lauren Hill's character, Rita, and her mother.
Overall, this is a great family movie that everyone can enjoy.  The comedy is simple enough for children to understand, and there isn't one scene in the movie (that I can recall) which is inappropriate for all ages.  Like a few other reviewers, I've found that I long to hear a few of the songs from the movie when I need cheering up.

Yes, if you were under a rock when this film came out, this second Sister Act film has a killer soundtrack, which for me was better than that of the first film. The songs, especially Oh Happy Day and those songs with Lauryn Hill (her presence is electrifying) never fail to produce goosebumps. Unbelievably soulful.

For people who aren't raising teens or who just don't connect with kids, this movie may at first glance be trite and uninteresting. Take another look, because kids really CAN do this--it isn't just a cool idea for a film. What tugs the heart is watching it happen (plus the music is terrific). A variation on ""To Sir With Love"" or ""Mr. Holland's Opus"" or ""Finding Forrester"" or ""October Sky""? Sure, I guess. But WHY do producers and directors keep creating these great films, and WHY do we keep loving them? In a time when the government wants us to hold schools and teachers ""accountable"" for the demise of our youngsters and our society, these stories show us what MANY real teachers--and students--are doing, and it gives us hope. Watch this movie and let these kids be real to you. Just knowing where your kids are and what they are doing isn't enough. Somebody (you?) will have to be there for them.

The kids in it were so mean and so rebellious at the first, gluing Sister Mary Clarence to her chair, that I could not forgive them.  Even though they won the singing  championship, I did not feel they deserved it.  I really thought the group  that when they sang, the St. Francis girls said, ""They're good,  they're really, really good,"" should have won first place.
I loved  Whoopi and the nuns, and I really took a liking to Father Thomas and  Ignacious.  My favorite part of the movie was where Father Thomas was  driving the bus, and he really should not have been.  It was pretty  funny.
However, I'm only rating this movie two stars because I felt the  kids in it did not need to behave the way they did.  I have no respect for  children who do whatever the heck they want to do, even when their parent  objects, and then gets a sweet little slap on the back for doing it.  I  feel Rita's mother should have been a little angrier at being disobeyed,  even though I felt the mother, too, was wrong in thinking you couldn't put  food on the table with singing.  I happen to love singing, I sing at  church.  And if singing couldn't put food on the table, then what about all  those Christian singers like Sandi Patti and Michael W. Smith who do just  fine eating and singing?
I feel this movie could have been a lot better  planned than it was, and if there is ever a Sister Act 3, I hope it is more  like the first one.",960076800,,1480,4.192857142857143
