334987,4,6301581474,"G-MEN VS. THE BLACK DRAGON (1943) was one of the Republic serials of the 40s.  These chapter plays had some of the best fight scenes and cliffhanger endings compared to any of the other studios that made them.

Ok, big 15 chapter serial.  Rightly spread out over 2 platters.

The problem is the transfer.  It looks like it has been transferred from VHS over to DVD.  Contrast is weak, there is a lot of flicker, etc.

Having this Cheezy edition is better than nothing.  The sad fact is that Paramount/Viacom owns these great serials and used beautiful source prints for their laserdisk releases several years ago.  I collected all of these Republic serials on laserdisc, including G-MEN VS. BLACK DRAGON--which looked pristine on laser.

So far, Lionsgate has thrown us only one bone, with the DVD release of THE ADVENTURES OF CAPTAIN MARVEL.  Lionsgate still has a distribution deal with Paramount for release of Republic catalogue titles.

There are still many great titles from the Republic catalogue that these guys are just sitting on!  Wish they would license them out to someone who cares!  Legend films??",1230595200,46,1112,4.908602150537634

Date of birth:  7 December 1910 - Calgary, Alberta, Canada
Date of death:  21 December 1983 - Gainesville, Georgia

Special Footnote,  Rod Cameron Canadian-born leading man entered films as a stunt man and stand-in, doubling for such actors as Fred MacMurray and Buck Jones ... whose movie career stretched from the 1930s to the 1970s ... In 1943, Cameron would rise to starring status in a pair of fifteen chapter serials: ""Secret Service in Darkest Africa"" and ""G-Men vs. The Black Dragon"" for Rebublic Pictures .... He spent the rest of the 1940s as a western leading man at both Republic and Universal. In 1953, Cameron and producer Richard Irving collaborated on the first of three syndicated television series, ""City Detective"". The 65-episode series was sold to 117 markets, a record at the time, and made more money for Cameron than any of his movie endeavors. The second Cameron/Irving TV project, 1956's  ""State Trooper"", was even more successful, clocking in at 104 episodes. Cameron's third syndicated series, ""Coronado 9"", was released in January of 1960 --- Recently, Cameron was awarded a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

Total Time: 250 min on VHS ~ Republic Video ~ (5/30/1995)",1167264000,2,6670,5.146025878003697
334989,5,6301581474,"This has one of the best collections of cliffhangers ever in one serial.  There are many good examples:  The explosions at the end of Chapter One go on and on.  Chapter Two has that great damsel-in-distress gimmick, a buzz saw.  Chapter Three has an exciting bomb situation that isn't even a cliffhanger, somewhat of a Witney specialty.  Chapter Eight's ending is extremely well presented--play the revelation in Chapter Nine in slow motion and you'll be amazed!  The cliffhanger fights take place in such venues as a small plane, the top of an electrical power tower, in mini-submarine, a laundry, a railroad trestle, even a hospital room, all places in which exotic fights can take place.  Some cliffhangers are better than others, of course, but there's not a bummer among them and not a single cheat.  And Howard Lydecker's special effects were never better.

In addition to the cliffhangers, this has nearly as many great fights, in better places, as in Rod Cameron's other serial, ""Secret Dervice in Darkest Africa"" (aka ""Manhunt in the African Jungles""), in which he played the same character, Agent Rex Bennett.  Cameron was a rugged athletic type and he was able to do a lot of his own stunts for the close-up work, but he was doubled by Tom Steele in the more dangerous stuff.  And Rod seems to take his character a little more seriously this time than he did in the other serial--maybe he was exhausted from this one by the time he started the other.

Australian-born Constance Worth was a child actress in the 1920's.  She later starred in B-films such as the Boston Blackie series.  She brings real class to the role of Agent Vivian Marsh, a 40's film noire look.  She's especially good in the middle chapters when she goes in disguise to trap the master spy Haruchi--one of the most convincing acting jobs I've ever seen from a serial heroine.  And wait till you see her handle a Tommy gun!

To me, the weak link in this cast is Nino Pipitone, an Italian-American who tries his best as the Japanese spy Haruchi, but I'm afraid he was miscast.  George Lewis is competent as usual as one of Haruchi's henchmen, but Noel Cravat manages to outshine him as the other main henchman.  Roland Got is very good as Agent Chang Sing.  Got played Chinese and Japanese roles in several wartime pictures, but I couldn't find too much on him--one website said he died in 1948 and another said he appeard in ""Vertigo"" in 1958, so go figure that out if you can.

William Witney used his wife Maxine Doyle (""SOS Coast Guard"") in a very brief cameo role as a maid in Chapter Eight, for which he gave her first billing among the secondary roles, while serial veteran Montague Shaw, who appears in an important part in two chapters, appears halfway down the list.  Oh well, who says the world's best serial director isn't entitled to a little nepotism?

To me, the greatest serial of all-time is ""Spy Smasher,"" also directed by William Witney.  But this one is right up there with it as a strong second, the difference being the performance of Kane Richmond over that of Rod Cameron.  This is, however, better than the other Rod Cameron serial, ""Secret Service in Darkest Africa,"" on the strength of the great performance of Constance Worth and the fact that Cameron is much better in this one.",1140825600,,3287,4.6747826086956525
334990,4,6301581474,"This serial finds the Republic cliffhanger machine in top gear with top special effects by the Lydeckers, a pounding musical score by Mort Glickman and the usual knowing direction from ace serial director Witney. It is the better of the two serials with Rod Cameron and while it doesn't have as many slugfests as Secret Service in Darkest Africa (aka Manhunt in the African Jungle) it has much less of the juvenile dialogue of that serial and a much more convincing millieu (Republic's North African settings are not that realistic). Although Nino Pippitone as the Japanese mastermind Haruchi has a very fragile looking frame; he exudes considerable reptilian venom. The Republic Golden Age of Serials had one or two more years to go but after viewing this very entertaining and well-made entry you will wish it never ended.",1027900800,4,824,4.978260869565218
334991,5,6301581474,"Of all my collection of Republic's ""Golden-Age"" Serials, this is the one I can watch again and again and enjoy it better with each viewing. This serial surely equals the ""ultimate"" cliff-hanger, ""Spy Smasher."" For one thing, everything in this stunningly directed, edited, acted, photographed chapter-play is so darn fresh. Only a few stock shots are used. Another great plus is the fantastic cast: Rod Cameron,probably the greatest of all action heroes, and the cool, voluptuous and feisty Constance Worth who isn't afraid to get her hair mussed as she jumps right in with machine guns, revolvers and pluck to help out Cameron. You wonder whatever happened to her? By far the most chilling and inventive cliff-hanger ending comes at the end of Chapter 8 and it features our gal, Constance. I won't tell you what happens but it involves a spear. William Witney proves himself to be a master craftsman, an over-looked genius who was the major force that elevated Republic Studio Serials to great art--and fantastic entertainment that can be seen and enjoyed by modern audiences. Bravo to Rod, Constance and Witney!",1012435200,23,1113,5.054347826086956
334992,5,6301581474,"The best WWII-themed serial, with directors William Witney and Spencer Gordon Bennett teamed up for the first and last time. Witney was a storyteller and Bennett an action man. Together they mixed up a heady brew. The unique ending of Chapter 8 is often mentioned, but it's the end of Chapter One that stands out, with a strong feel of chaos unleashed upon the earth. From then on Rex Bennett has not one but three bad guys to contend with, and they keep him busy right up to the moment civilization is saved in the rather perfunctory ending. One of the few serials that you wish could have been longer.",1010275200,3,603,4.490909090909091
334993,5,6301581474,"This is yet another of the greatest serials made.  It's interesting to compare this great serial with the earlier Universal serial, JUNIOR G-MEN OF THE AIR.  There are several notable similarities between the two, though the Republic serial is obviously far better. The raven with a poisoned beak is one of the greatest touches. The villain has to be one of the top serial bad guys.  The lady in peril situations are good variations, and Constance Worth's characterization gives us one of the feistiest heroines in the genre.  And then, there's Chapter 8, which has to be one of the greatest cliffhanger endings.",993772800,,612,4.912621359223301
334994,4,6301581474,"This is one of two World War II serials in which Rod Cameron played federal agent Rex Bennett (the other being ""Manhunt in the African Jungle,"" aka ""Secret Service in Darkest Africa""). In both,  he links up with a heroine (an English agent played by Constance Worth this  time) and a national from another ally (a Chinese, here), and his natural  stunting ability sparks some of the best fight scenes in serial cinema.  Watch for an explosion which seems to go on forever at the end of chapter  one, and an appearance by director William Witney's wife impersonating a  maid on the phone for the good guys. And try to suppress a cheer in the  last chapter with Cameron's precisely-underplayed remark to his captors who  are boasting of Axis victories in the Pacific: ""Tell it to the  Marines.""",959904000,4,792,4.681159420289855

335080,5,6301581474,"The quality of this DVD is probably about as good as one could hope to get given that the source print/negative is more than 70 years old.  I read one review that claimed that this version was digitized at 25 source frames per second instead of the theatrical release at 24 frames per second.  I could not detect any consequence of this other than the fact that each chapter ran about 4% shorter in elapsed time than Republic Pictures original release time, so it may be true.  Even so, it is still very watchable and an excellent example of Republic's serial product at the height of their quality of production.  No other studio released serials to match the production values, cliff hangers, action and chase scenes, film scores, great direction and film editing of Republic's best, and this is a good as it gets!",1372723200,,816,4.645833333333333

It also has the 'us against them' feel  that you get watching a lot films made during the war.  And yes, there is racism here, with the Japanese taking it on the chin,  but we have an amazing piece of casting here.  With the U.S. fighting the Axis powers while this was made, no one would ever consider using a Japanese/American actor to play the evil head of the Japanese Black Dragon Society.  So they used an Italian/American actor to portray the Japanese!  Seriously, if you like your action almost non-stop give this one a try.  It's one of the best.",1301961600,,724,4.465648854961832

The problems with the DVD edition from Cheezy Flicks are mostly with the original video source.  When Republic Home Video released this serial on Laserdisc in the early 1990's, they ran the film something over 4% fast (doubtless 25 frames/second instead of 24) so they could cram all 15 chapters plus the trailer onto four 60-minute sides.  This was fast enough that voices sounded odd, especially the already squeaky one of Constance Worth.  Even George Lewis sounded like he'd inhaled a little helium.  Republic's VHS edition was released at the same time and had the same problem.

Unfortunately the DVD from Cheezy Flicks also runs fast, and the timings are exactly the same as the Laserdisc, including the rather short times between the chapters.  There is a pause, the video having a repeat of some of the credits, where the first side break was in the Laserdisc.  The image quality isn't as good, being slightly unsharp, about like the VHS release, but with less video noise.  The contrast is a little low, but the gray scale is adequate, so compensation can be made by adjusting the controls of the TV.  The other problems I saw were also present on the Laserdisc.  There is quite a bit of flicker in the first reel of Chapter 1, and lesser amounts elsewhere, mostly in the titles.  The image also has a slight vertical bounce, about 100 times per minute, possibly from the film speed change.  These defects are not especially annoying once the contrast has been corrected.

The price asked for the DVD is reasonable, given that it is on two discs, and the menu makes finding the chapters almost as easy as with the Laserdisc.  The trailer is included, apparently at the correct speed, along with trailers for some non-serial films available from Cheezy Flicks.  But the main virtue of the DVD edition is that it is available to those who don't have it in another format; it is unfortunate that the same corrupted source was used when the DVD does not have the Laserdisc time-constraint problem.  I rate it down to three stars primarily for the speed problem; it is still an enjoyable serial.

Update, September 27, 2016: Grapevine Video's edition, while also from the Laserdisc, and on DVD-R media, has addressed the speed issue and has somewhat better video quality in most respects.  See ASIN: B01K5Z8MHM,",1280966400,19,2642,4.815964523281597

Some reviewers have pointed out playback-speed issues, but to my untrained eyes, it was never a distraction.  If anything, it only heightens the intensity and bolsters the pulverizing that the Republic stuntmen dish out.  Otherwise, this is another nice, clean print from Cheezy Flicks.
