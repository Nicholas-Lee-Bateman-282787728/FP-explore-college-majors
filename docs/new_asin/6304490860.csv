This story depicts the children in the simple (yet initially naughty way they were). In the end, they made sacrifices, though all the sacrifices, like tying the cord around their necks as a penance, were not shown. Most importantly, Hell was shown, and it is good that it was since God made it clear through Jesus that many go there.  There is a lot to learn from this movie, from the importance of the Rosary to the innocence of children, to the evils of communism. I truly recommend it, though the book by Thomas Walsh is more accurate and doesn't soft peddle anything.",1423008000,,719,4.565891472868217

After the apparition of Mary occurs, the tone of the piece soon becomes evil and sinister. The parents of the children are dark and threatening, berating them and denouncing them for embarrassing the family. It gets worse! The children are hauled to municipal court, where they are threatened by dark and twisted officials that if they do not recant, they will be boiled alive in oil. As another reviewer mentioned, there is also a vision of hell that will give little ones nightmares. Is this wholesome family entertainment? I think not! The story could have been presented in a much more age appropriate way!",1267660800,,735,5.032786885245901

The animation is beautiful, and it paints a clear picture for young children who watch it. The complexity of the story is lessened in order to cater to the younger audience, which makes this a very good choice for your kids if you want to teach them about the story of Fatima. Of course, you don't have to be young to enjoy this one--it's guaranteed to make both the young and old smile! =) This is one of those stories that will be well-loved by many for all eternity, and this well-made version is surely a must-see. You'll love it. =)",1009497600,16,696,4.320610687022901
