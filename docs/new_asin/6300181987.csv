214153,5,6300181987,"I've seen this movie at least 10 times and still watch it every time it comes on TV.  This low-budget flick demonstrates Spielberg's great talent for taking minimal cast or props and developing a spell-binding suspense  movie.  Dennis Weaver, in an essentially solo role, masterfully plays the  frightened driver engaged in a life and death road game with a truck driver  whose face we never see.  The build-up of suspense is beautifully crafted  and anyone who drives can identify with a frustrated Dennis Weaver whose  driving actions that starts the whole terror-filled episode.",926640000,2,581,5.172043010752688
214154,5,6300181987,"A movie made by a 23-year old kid for a few thousand dollars that puts you on the edge of your seat would be quite impressive.  That's exactly what ""Duel"" is.  The fact that it's so suspenseful and so exciting without million-dollar special effects is a testament to Speilberg's genius even at an early age.  Dennis Weaver was well cast in his lead role and plays a difficult part very believeably, although his ""hear-my-thoughts"" self-narration is a little hokey by today's standards, ""Duel"" is a must-see for fans of Speilberg or any Suspense fan.

214155,5,6300181987,"I saw ""Duel"" one night and I knew nothing about it but it grabbed me and wouldn't let go!!  Since then I've found out that it was one of  Steaven Speilbergs first movies and on the strenth of this film, he was hired to make ""Jaws""  A must see if there ever was one!!

214156,5,6300181987,"Duel is amazing.  The cast is very small, it couldn't have cost too much money to make, but the story is so mysterious, the circumstances, are extreme, so extreme you are dying to know the motive.  You can't stop watching it, it's a very simple plot, and an unforgetable classic!  END",875836800,,284,4.529411764705882

214324,5,6300181987,". . . and it's a humdinger. Made during Spielberg's apprenticeship with Universal Television, ""Duel,"" based on a razor-sharp story by Richard Matheson, is the simplest tale of terror imaginable: Everyman, expertly played by Dennis Weaver, is pursued across a desert highway by a maniacal 18-wheeler that repeatedly tries to kill him. It's all in the execution, and, boy, does Spielberg execute. He also took huge gambles that could have destroyed his career just as it was beginning: instead of filming on the cheap, with studio process shotsas all the old experts warned him he should doSpielberg took his cameras out on location, meticulously storyboarded everything, stayed on budget, finished in a matter of days (!), and created his first masterpiece. A long interview with the director himself describes all this in detail and everything else related to production. At this writing this item is priced under ten bucks: a steal. It's so well made that you'll likely want to see it more than once, so I suggest you buy, not rent.",1508630400,5,1033,5.011627906976744

I thought since it was originally a made-for-TV movie from 1971, it might have been shot on lesser film or this is a direct transfer from the DVD version. I went out on a limb in buying this but they seemed to have digitally remastered this film and scanned from the original source material.

214430,5,6300181987,"Undoubtedly the best TV movie ever made. The young Speilberg equals Hitchcock's Psycho in intensity and cruelty toward the viewer, who has to watch Dennis Weaver frantically fleeing a large oil truck bent on killing him.

The editing is masterful, and there are shots under the truck, showing its pipes, its pistons, etc.

The original movie was 76 minutes long, and extra scenes (not as good) were added to reach the 90-minute feature length.

There are two little options open to Weaver that the intensity of the movie makes us forget:

(1) All he has to do is get out of the car and the truck driver can't hurt him.

(2) All he has to do is turn around and go home, abandon his trip, and he will be safe.

But the real thrust of the story is that he can't abandon the duel, he has to see it through to the end, because he is a man. ""David Mann.""

The exigencies of masculinity drive the story. There could never be such a story about two women.",1496448000,,947,4.31638418079096

214566,5,6300181987,"I watched Duel on Blu-ray today and it's the best I've ever seen or heard it. The nice picture is especially apparent on scenes where Weaver is outside the car, such as at the gas station, the diner or walking outside. Detail on the tanker truck is also clearly visible and well-defined, rather close-up or from medium-distance. I saw certain objects, coloring, etc, about the tanker truck I never noticed before. A lot of detail is clearly visible on the front of the truck. The daytime scenes with Weaver walking outside are also pretty and colorful, such as the school bus scene. Weaver's red car was the prettiest and clearest I ever saw it.

The audio was just as good, if not better. I watched it in DTS HD Master Audio 5.1. and it sounded amazing. Clear and loud. It made my soundbar sound bigger than it is.

Watching it again on Amazon, it was everything I thought it would be. It's easily my all-time favorite made-for-TV movie. The slow, slow build of suspense is masterful. Unlike so many suspense films, this is one many of us can perhaps imagine happening to us. Any driver who's ever been intentionally cut off in traffic, or nearly run off the road by an angry driver can imagine the fear that would grow and grow in us as we realized there is no alternate route, and no way to escape the increasing danger. This film needed no special effects or eye-rolling coincidences to achieve its horror; it's all done with camera angles and acting (there are even tense segments that are not played out with no music used to increase the viewers' anxiety). Well done, through and through.",1474848000,4,910,4.6234567901234565

214791,5,6300181987,"This 1971 film was Steven Spielberg's first full-length feature film and, immediately, all his tell-tale signs of tension based on events that are essentially somewhat out of the control of the films main victim are readily apparent. In this case the scenario is simple.

Man, probably some sort of travelling salesman, leaves to go somewhere not specified. On the way he becomes the victim of a driver, never seen, of a powerful large lorry which is filthy and emits copious fumes etc. The victim is portrayed as a mild-mannered man who is forced to flee for his life. This strategy fails so a battle ensues that lasts until the conclusion of this uneven struggle is climaxed.

That such a single themed and unyielding plot can prove to be unfailingly gripping throughout is testament to a plot line that any driver in deserted terrain might fear an identify with coupled with director skills that steadily winds up the tension. The final conclusion is not a disappointment although perhaps not as obvious as some might expect. Spielberg does not make the mistake of extending the drama beyond what can be sustained.

This is a fine start to a director's career centred around steadily rising tensions and has achieved a considerable following. It is also historically significant for that reason. However, this review is not intended to discuss the actual film as by now it will have both its supporters and detractors. Entering into those conflicts is not the purpose of the review which is aimed squarely at the many supporters of this film.

Essentially, for all of those who are keen supporters of this film and who have bought the previous DVD version of this disc, the only issue of vital importance will be whether the Blu-ray offers an improvement technically sufficient to justify the additional expense.

For this reviewer the answer is a clear affirmative. The upgrade offers a clear advance on both image and audio quality with the imaging being a marked improvement. The colours are firmer and there is an increase to the perceived depth of the imaging. The whole film simply becomes more 'real.' The film, which is so concerned with close characterisation, benefits considerably from this enhancement of reality.

The degree of improvement experienced from this BD will also inevitably depend on the replay equipment used. The following technical information is intended to be a guide to aid in assessment.

The screen used for this review is only of moderate dimensions being a 40 inch television screen. However, the television is a high performing 4K unit which delivers a compensating positive effect. The moderate screen size lacks the impact of larger screens but is less critical of film faults.

However, the contributing player is, unusually, able to separate the audio and visual HDMI signals before they leave separately to the television and pre-amp. That feature enhances both the visual and audio elements of the output. The audio, not so critical in the case, delivers an unusually wide-ranging and revealing performance. Its precision is equally revealing of film scores.

Readers with alternative equipment will have to interpret this review bearing in mind their own equipment and its comparative advantages and disadvantages.

The disc offers purchasers with suitable replay equipment a substantial improvement over the previous DVD.

In summary this BD is a transfer from well-preserved 1971 film stock and has responded well to the upgrade and well worth considering",1474329600,,3503,5.117338003502627

214910,5,6300181987,"I caught snippets of Duel on TV now and then over the years in my childhood (ya know, back when they showed GOOD films on TV), but somehow I never saw the whole thing. Maybe my parents didn't want to scare me. Many years later a co-worker told me I should watch it because it's a classic. I watched the lousy DVD release a while back and out of that I got that it was a great movie, but badly in need of a restoration. Fortunately I can report that this Blu Ray isn't good... it's absolutely mind-blowing! Perhaps this film is finally going to get the recognition it deserves.

I've recently been re-watching a lot of Spielberg's older films, and I'm fascinating by how some of the films are even better as an adult (watching glorious Blu Ray quality picture and sound), and others seem greatly diminished after all these years despite being legendary when I was a kid. I re-watched E.T. on Netflix and found it to be a boring film with lousy special effects (as a kid it was a lot more exciting). I re-watched Jaws and it's just not as entertaining for me as it was as a kid (maybe because it's better watching it with my family?). Close Encounters of The Third Kind however, was a MUCH better film than I remembered, and the video and audio quality of the Blu Ray with it's earth-shaking bass and astounding clarity blew me away. Duel on Blu Ray was a surprise as well for quite a few reasons.

Hitchcock via Spielberg

As I've gotten older I'm able to recognize a lot more threads from old films that carry over as influences in more modern films. If you watch Jaws, you can see a great deal of Hitchcock film-making techniques in place, from camera angles to the slow-tension build-up in scenes. Don't get me wrong, Jaws is a good film from a film-making viewpoint, but in my opinion this film is BETTER. There's GREATNESS in the film techniques used here, from  the opening credits rolling from the perspective of the driver of the vehicle to fixed camera angles which work that wonderful bug-in-a-jar effect Hitchcock was soon good at.

I very recently watched Kurosawa's ""Stray Dog"" and because of that realized that a scene where Mann is in the diner trying to piece together the identity of the driver of the truck is just like the climax of that Noir classic (running out of time, everyone in the room matches the limited description of a killer).

When I was a kid people said Hitchcock could create tension anywhere, even a single room, or a boat. Spielberg apparently thought if Hitchcock could do that so could he. Everyone knows he created some epic tension at the conclusion of Jaws on a boat. So how does a film set mostly on a car fare?

Psychological Thrills on the California Highway

The brilliance of this film is it's plausibility. I lived in California for 20 years, and I've driven up and down the desert highways. I've seen a lot of strange stuff on the highways over the years, and when you're all alone over those hundreds of miles driving by yourself, there's a real feeling of possible danger that overcomes you when you realize you could just ""disappear"" on those empty roads and never be found. Speeders, reckless drivers, and heavy machinery present real dangers which seem to be amplified by your isolation. This setting is PERFECT for this kind of film.

Dennis Weaver is absolutely FANTASTIC in his role here, as he's just a mild-mannered every-man on his way to an appointment, with every day human reactions. At first, he's annoyed by the truck that seems to be ""playing games"" with him on the road (even slightly amused). But after a few interchanges with the truck, there's a great moment in film-making history (one of the most chilling of any thriller ever made). It's the moment when you (and Mann) realize that the driver of the truck is trying to kill him. Yikes!

Mann tries to get away from the mysterious maniac driver, and he can't because he's being stalked. He reacts exactly the way anyone would. This can't be real. There must be a logical explanation. I'll get away and forget about it. This person is crazy. I'll call the police. They won't believe me. I have to run. I have to fight.

Mann is chased across the desert, and eventually in his desperation grasps at ANY potential help to escape his situation. He tries to out-wait his enemy, or get help, but everything he does only serves to draw things out to an epic climax. And what a climax it is. You could probably read the conclusion of the film in a number of ways, but personally I see the inner hero coming out of Mann. In his introverted, mild-mannered way, he stops running and confront his terror head-on. And it is awesome.

This may be a made-for-TV film, but as far as thrillers go, I think it's one of the best. In fact, I think it's in the top five films Spielberg ever made.

Why Buy The Blu Ray?

The Blu Ray is absolutely glorious. The picture quality is gorgeous (I'm talking Criterion quality here). There's beautiful film grain and perfectly calibrated picture. The sound, oh my goodness! I played the Blu Ray on my projector through my stereo amp, and there's a spaciousness and range to the sound that might make your neighbors think there's a semi in your front yard. There's beautiful bass and directionality to the sound, and it's absolutely clear. This film is a three or four star film on DVD, but on Blu Ray it's a five star film because it hits harder, draws you in deeper, and glues your eyes to the screen for snappy hour and half of thrilling entertainment. This film is a must-watch on Blu Ray, and a must-own for people who like thrillers and Spielberg films.

Oh, and that truck with it's mysterious never-seen driver, irresistible weight and momentum, and impossibly powerful engine, is one of the greatest villains of all time.",1469836800,2,5772,4.563285024154589

They did not show us the Evil Demon who rose out of the Truck after crash landing
with car.  Big disappointment as that was the clincher in the movie that really portrayed what that Truck was all about. The original
movie showed smoke erupted out of the Truck which was The Demon Image! The ending was cut out or changed.  I purchased this movie thinking i was going to see the original. Big disappointment.

215148,4,6300181987,"I was late to the party when I first saw ""Duel"" on DVD.  Everybody knows who Steven Spielberg is, but this 1971 Movie of the Week was his first ""big screen"" production and a real hidden gem more than 40 years later.  It's got a simple and accessible premise (man terrorized in the middle of nowhere by a vengeful truck driver) that holds up well, and it's perfectly acted and directed from start to finish.  It was also shot on a tight budget in just a few weeks, which is impressive for a now-famous filmmaker barely old enough to drink at the time.

Anyway, on to Universal's Blu-ray.  Originally part of a larger boxed set, this stand-alone release is great for people like me that already owned most of the titles on Blu-ray but didn't want to shell out $70+ for the rest.  It's got a newly remastered 1080p transfer in 16x9 widescreen; the original DVD kept the film's TV-friendly 1.33:1 ratio (open matte), while this is meant to replicate a theatrical showing.  Fun fact: ""Duel"" actually was released to theaters overseas shortly after its TV premiere, with about 15 minutes of footage added to reach the 90-minute requirement.  Oddly enough, the original (shorter) version has not been included on any home video release---including this one---and the addition of both version would've been appreciated.

But more ""Duel"" is never a bad thing, and this Blu-ray is just as good as the DVD otherwise: all the terrific bonus features are included, so the bump in A/V quality makes it a good overall package.  I'm keeping both discs because of the aspect ratio difference, but I'll probably return to this Blu-ray more often than the DVD.",1456185600,3,1641,4.746478873239437

215210,5,6300181987,"Spielbergs dramatic psychological thriller is impressive after more than four decades. Despite the films simple premise it is complex and intense. Not only is David Mann, the ordinary everyman character, forced onto a knifes edge for most of the film, but he shows how the terror of his situation brings out the best of him. He is forced to rely on himself to defeat and escape his adversary when attempts to enlist help are rebuffed or fail. Even more impressive is how Spielberg blends the genres of the western, the thriller, the chase movie, horror and the road movie. He uses shades of Hitchcock, such as the sound track. The cinematography is brilliant especially when dealing with the truck, portraying it as almost a living thing belching smoke, its engine roaring and the horn bellowing. This neat thriller cleverly interweaves a number of themes, such as masculinity, isolation, both personal and communal, violence, the frontier and the west. Thought provoking imagery, for example, the snakes are emblematic of both the Wild West and the truck driver. I wouldn't usually watch a road movie, but was entranced by this one.

This movie is noteworthy because it's one of Spielberg's first films, but beyond that it nothing short of awesome.  What really drives the creepiness is the rusty tanker truck billowing noise and smoke.  In fact, the vehicle from ""Jeepers Creepers"" probably ripped off the look of the truck in ""Duel.""  What drives the tension is the unknown, angry trucker's response to Dennis Weaver's character, but also Dennis Weaver's character's reactions and mounting stress as he battles it out in the desert, just him and his red Plymouth Valiant.  Seriously, watched it with my wife and kids (12 and 10) and we all loved it.  Plus all the effects are real.  No green-screen business.",1444176000,7,812,4.883211678832117

215240,5,6300181987,"As an FYI, the newer editions on Blu-ray and DVD appear higher rez and much cleaned up from previous releases.
There's an old adage in filmmaking which says sometimes ""less is more"". In Steven Spielberg's feature-length debut, ""Duel"" achieves a lot within a surprisingly small scope. And yet within a film which was shot in less than two weeks on a shoe-string budget, Spielberg managed to create a highly suspenseful film worthy of Hitchcock. The original clocked in at 72 minutes as a made-for-television ""movie of the week"", and was subsequently expanded to 90 minutes for release in Europe.

The elements of the film are surprisingly sparse: a small cast of characters, an unchanging setting, and a deceptively simple plot. Let's explore them in reverse order. The main characters include a middle-age/middle-class driver (Dennis Weaver), a red compact sedan, in this case a 1970 Plymouth Valiant, and a nameless tanker trunk from the 1950's with the word ""FLAMMABLE"" in large bold letters at the back. The truck and its faceless driver seem nearly one, which is why I characterize the truck and driver as a single character. The action takes place on Route 14 in the California desert, about an hour's drive north of Los Angeles in Southern California near Palmdale.

When we first see the truck, we already sense something menacing. An older engine protrudes from the cabin like a large snout in front of the wind-shield eyes. The entire body is oiled and brown, as if having fought in many battles in the past. The engine doesn't hum, but rather breathes and groans like a large sentient creature, a la King Kong. Its smokestack and other areas constantly spew smoke like a dragon. And occasionally it sounds its horn, a loud menacing grunt. It's obviously an older vehicle but seems to have lost none of its energy, strength and speed over the years.

The plot concerns David Mann (Weaver) and his unassuming compact sedan driving off Interstate 5 onto Route 14, a two-lane desert highway in the middle of nowhere, and encountering the large tanker truck. The conflict is an updated version of a duel. Instead of a noble knight facing a black-clothed foe with swords, the duel is between the vehicles. The truck seems determined to destroy the small red Plymouth, the automobile equivalent of a little minnow being pursued by a vehicular shark. At first Mann doesn't understand he's being pulled into this dangerous game. The only times we sense someone else behind the wheel of the truck is when an arm motions Mann to pass him, not because he's being a courteous driver but because he wants to continue ""the game"". Because he's over-matched by the far-larger tanker, Mann realizes if he's going to survive the game, he'll have to outwit this dragon, a bit like Frodo versus Smaug.

This is first-rate suspense on the level of Hitchcock with almost no lag at all. We see the story from Weaver's point of view the entire time, and like him, we don't know why the truck is playing this deadly game of cat and mouse, or car and truck. When we first meet the truck, it is menacing but we're not sure what its intentions are, and the pacing gradually reveals its desires. We are given very little information about the human characters except Mann is on his way to a business meeting, and he had a dispute with someone before he left. At first Mann is worried about missing his meeting, but as events unfold, that becomes a very small concern. Dennis Weaver as Mann offers a stellar performance, believable to the very end.",1439510400,,3527,4.786535303776683

Dennis Weaver was just the right choice as the stressed out salesman trying to get to meet a client when he encounters hell on 18 wheels. Somehow he really gets a truck driver really , and I mean really ticked off and from there it's on. In todays world of crazed road ragers this is a well done with practically no money very believable movie. The first time I saw this was when it aired on TV on the ""Movie of the Week"" if I recall.

It is still quite thrilling when you view it as an adult...also makes you appreciate having technology (as in cell phones) when you do have to travel those long, frequently uninhabited stretches of desert road.

215301,5,6300181987,"The car I learned to drive on was a 1971 Plymouth Valiant with the V8 option, the same car as in the movie.  I drove it from high school through graduate school.  It was metallic blue rather than orange.  It had the same interior!  (If you look close you can see the little sticker indicating the V8 option a few inches back from the headlights on both front side panels.  I learned that only one of about one hundred Valiants had the V8 option.  Most had the venerable slant six.)

For this reason, I really feel for and root for Dennis Weaver through the course of this movie.  I wonder if I were in his place whether or not I could outrun that truck once and for all and be safe.  The Valiant with the V8 is a quicker car than it looks like.  I'd like to think I could do better than Dennis Weaver did.  Surely I could put some serious distance between myself and the truck when we ran into hills.  But could I ever shake the truck completely when we're stuck on the same highway in the middle of nowhere?  I don't really know.

Anyway, this is a brilliantly simple  and great old suspense movie.  If you haven't seen it before, please give it a try.  You may be pleasantly surprised.",1432339200,,1187,4.227678571428571

A man out on a desert highway being stalked by a big giant crazy 18-wheeler. This is the most badass movie of all time. This is a young and hungry Stephen Spielberg trying his hand at independent filmmaking and this is in my opinion better than Jaws. I wish more of his films were like this, but in the audio commentary even Stephen himself admits, he couldn't do it again like this even if he tried. He's too successful, and too comfortable, and he has all the money he knows what to do with. And big studios won't allow films like this to be made anymore. Stephen Spielberg's Minority Report has changed the current climate of social norms and how the powers of authority think and act, and sadly, there's no way out.",1431302400,,851,4.3584905660377355

But there were too many times through out the film that it was the same thing over and over again. At those times it took a bit of self control Not to ""fast forward"" just to make it STOP. The ending was predictable but satisfying at the same time. I would watch it again.",1431302400,,555,4.148148148148148

Even with the padding of additional scenes to lengthen the story for theatrical release after its debut on U.S. television, it is still a masterwork of ruthless economy in its staging, editing and plot.  Dennis Weaver is the perfect Mr Average who plays a little chicken with a foul, evil-looking old rig, and gets a hell of a lot more than he bargained for.  Everything hangs together - everything is plausible - the tension is built up seamlessly and then, ""there you are: right back in the jungle again.""

215392,5,6300181987,"Having grown up in the 1970s as a kid, I have some fond memories of that decade. This movie is one of them. I was not aware of who Dennis Weaver was until I saw this movie. From that point on, I knew who he was and identified him with it. I loved the movie and the premises of it was fairly new. Road rage in some form or manner. I'm sure we have all had it in our driving lives. Dennis Weaver plays a businessman out to see a client. If he doesn't get to see him, he will lose an important account. It all starts out well enough until he gets behind a stinky, smelly and loud tanker truck that doesn't seem to be in ANY hurry. Well, David, played by Dennis Weaver IS in a bit of a hurry to get to his destination.
When he passes the truck just like he did many times before with other vehicles, all seems okay, until the truck speeds up and gets in front of him, slowing down and putting his brakes on just to annoy. That is when the tensions get high and things start to turn for the worse. I won't give the ending away, but those of you who have seen it, already know it's conclusion.
I wouldn't call this a horror movie or even a scary movie at that, it is more of a suspenseful, what would you do in a situation like that kind of movie. Well done! There is a little swearing in it, but other than that it is pretty tame compared to today's vulgarity and violence in movies.

If you want an early piece of 1970s cinema, you cannot ignore DUEL. Directed by Steven Spielberg, who brought you JAWS in 1975 and CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND in 1978. The prime focus is on Dennis Weaver's character and what he does to confront this kind of evil that seemed to be an ordinary business day going to see a client. This Special Collector's Edition is pretty good for a DVD release.
I saw that there is a future Blu-ray release of this movie coming also, so hopefully it will address some of the issues some reviewers have with this movie edition. That being the missing original ""growl"" with the truck toward the end of the movie. I also noticed that the Coyote howl is not there also when he visits the ""snake lady"". There is a different sound to the truck trailer and I also think the fight scene in the caf was edited a bit. I remember Dennis Weaver's character getting hit twice before he went to the pool table.

215427,5,6300181987,"One of my favorite thrillers that isn't Hitchcock. ""Duel"" has the same face to face showdown that is the theme for ""Jaws"", even the Shaw's boat starts to break down as the shark starts circling. In one of the movie reviews after the movie played on TV, Dennis Weaver stated that he was one of the only actor to approve Steven Spelberg as the director for any movie. Weaver was also one the deputies to work with James Arness on ""Gunsmoke"", might be why ""McCloud"" was a cowboy lawman.",1424044800,2,483,4.438202247191011

215429,5,6300181987,"This movie came out as an ABC TV Movie of The Week in 1973. Steven Spielberg's first full length attempt. My brothers and I were hooked on it as kids. Most truckers are the coolest people in the world and talking to them at this this time was the best ever if you happened to own a CB Radio at the time. Road rage does happen, however, at least at certain points in time.. This movie in all honesty was not meant to put a bad impression on truckers of the day, but rather create an amazing highway road war story.  It works very well.  This was Steven Spielberg branching out and creating his own vision on movie making. It was very effective for it's time. The diner and roadside scenes were done quite well. Dennis Weaver's paranoia and all that stuff were like an Alfred Hitchcock movie.  I still love this flick to this day!  Spielberg used his experience from Duel in the making of Jaws, including the sound effects. How cool is that?

215463,5,6300181987,"This is a great film - Steven Spielberg's first big break, a TV movie at the time (and eventually released theatrically overseas, allowing Spielberg to go to Europe for the first time, to Rome, where he met and became friends with Fredrico Fellini), and a prototype for Jaws, it's the story of one an Everyman (David Mann, played  by Dennis Weaver) versus a monstrous truck, itself the product of some dark, Satanic mill. The film has one main role, and fourteen supporting roles, but the real star of the tale is the truck itself (forget about the shadowy stuntman driver - he's hardly ever even hinted at... a pair of boots there, hands on the wheel, an arm out the driver's window...). It's amazing how much Spielberg wrought out of such a simple concept - man, road, truck - and how it was spun into so many twists. The first 20 minutes drag a bit, as you watch Mann leave town and enter the desolate roads of Mint Canyon where all this action takes place, but it very quickly picks up and doesn't let you go. During this time we get to take in a bit of radio dialogue, which is strangely compelling and familiar, if a bit kooky.

This collector's edition contains tons of extras:

""A Conversation with Stephen Spielberg"" (35:00) - based on a story Spielberg's assistant read in Playboy magazine by Richard Matheson, who wrote for the Twilight Zone, and for films. Went on a casting call for the truck, found one with a snout and a ""face"" that has multiple state plates on it, probably one for each of its victims. Spielberg, erudite and informative, regularly references Hitchcock, and we do often think about the aimlessly murderous intents of the cropduster in North By Northwest when we watch Duel, since we never know the motive of the driver of the killer truck (European film critics sought symbolic ideas of class struggle, which Spielberg disavows). Ever the self-tributising sentimentalist, Spielberg notes how he put the Snake-o-rama lady into a similar desert road gas station scene in 1941 with John Belushi and his errant airplane. Spielberg shot it in only 13 days, then used five editors to get it ready for network TV broadcast within 2.5 weeks of wrap!! The music was experimental, and ""added so many layers of creepiness."" With the film only 73 minutes long for network TV, Spielberg shot some extra scenes so that it could be re-edited to 90 minutes for theatrical release outside the US. One of these scenes was the ""train push"" scene where the rig tries to push the car into an oncoming train, one of the most intense scenes in the film; another extra scene was the school bus scene, which is basically pretty silly and could have been left out... Ditto for the third new scene when Mann calls his wife, but it's at least significant to establish his Everyman-ness through his young, imperfect family (funnily, explitives were ADDED to the theatrical release to make it seem less like a crappy made-for-TV piece). Mann's ""inner monologue"" is a bit silly too, but I can see why it's important to this technically challenging film.

""Stephen Spielberg and the Small Screen"" (10:00) - talks about his experience working on the first episode of the regular Columbo TV series, Duel, The Name Of The Game, Owen Marshall, The Psychiatrist, Marcus Welby MD and Night Gallery, where he worked with Joan Crawford in the episode ""Eyes"".

""Richard Matheson: The Writing Of Duel"" (9:20) - the idea grew on the day of the John F Kennedy assassination, when Matheson and a friend had a nasty encounter with a truck themselves. Matheson notes that the character of David Mann was to be a metaphor for Everyman, while in the original story the truck had the word ""Keller"" printed on the side, to hint that it's a ""killer"".

Also included are 22 images and posters, a one-minute trailer, interactive ""Cast and Filmmakers"" feature, and another interactive ""Production Notes"" feature.",1418947200,,3890,4.772659732540862

215483,5,6300181987,"Of all the Steven Spielberg films ""Duel"" is my favorite one of all.  This of course is saying a lot since Spielberg is one of the great living directors with titans to his credit such as ""Schindler's List"", ""Jaws"" and ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"".  But this one, the most stripped down, the simplest of his repertoire clearly shows his genius because he proved without a shadow of a doubt that if you are truly talented all you need to make a movie is a little red car and a great big truck...and a knock out performance by Dennis Weaver.

The idea for this great story came to writer Richard Matheson as he was driving home from a canceled golf game after finding out President Kennedy had been assassinated.  On the way he and his golf buddy were terrorized by a large truck on a narrow pass.  The truck started tailgating them and the faster they drove the faster the truck pursued them until finally his friend who was driving the car turned off into dirt siding causing the car to spin around while the truck driver went flying past.  Moments after the occurrence he jotted down on an envelope ""man gets chased by a truck"".  After writing it he tried pitching it as a television film but everyone passed on it and said it wasn't enough of a story and he ended up publishing it as a short story in Playboy Magazine, which goes to show how well the experts in Hollywood can spot a great story.

A lot of thrillers these days look slick and polished depending on the help of special effects and gore to ignite their audience.  But here there is none of it.  What truly makes a movie terrifying is its ability to distil a common ground fear that everyone has regardless of when the story takes place in time.  In this case the fear is someone bigger than ourselves attempting to destroy us.

The underlying theme that runs through the movie is overcoming proverbial emasculation and finding the courage to regain ones masculinity.  Dennis Weaver's character aptly named David Mann, as in David and Goliath, does not like conflict and avoids it at all costs.  We see this clearly when after having his first encounter with the sociopathic truck driver he stops at a laundry mat to make a collect call to his wife.  They had an argument over an event that occurred the night before in which another man named Steve made an overbearing pass at David's wife.  She expected David to deal with Steve by standing up to him and challenging him to a fight where David, fearing what would happen if he actually took on Steve ignored the situation and chose to look at the incident as something that was no big deal.

At another point in the movie David's car careens into a fence by a caf after trying to escape the truck driver.  David tells the elderly man who walks up to his car in a voice similar to that of a small boy who has gone crying to his mother that his neck is hurt from the crash to which the elderly man tells his friend who is standing by that David only has whiplash showing the elderly man's common sense in contrast to David's timidity and fear after having been confronted.  The people in the caf see David as weak when he comes in to splash water on his face and their assessment of him is solidified when David, wrought with paranoia after seeing the menacing truck parked outside and thinking he has found the culprit, knocks a sandwich out of the man's hand followed by the man becoming angry and beating David up.

Later on in the movie he is asked by a school bus driver to help get the bus moving again by David taking his small red car and pushing it.  David is reluctant to help and when he does his car gets stuck under the back end of the bus.  The truck driver again shows up and David desperately bounces on the hood of his car to get it loose so he can get away.  As he does he sees the truck driver drive over and help the bus, just to show who's the bigger man.

Also take note of the color red which works both to identify David and as a feminine color in the film.  All the men including David wear blues and grays where many of the women wear red such as David's wife, the woman at the laundry mat, the old woman in the car, the woman playing pool and the school girls in bright red who gather around him in the bus scene. One of them wears red tights as she sits on his car.  David is the only man who wears any red at all (with the exception of a single red stripe on one of the boy's shirts on the school bus) which are the red stripes on his dark blue tie.  They work in denoting his battle with keeping the peace and his fear of conflict and being brave.  He is also the only man in the film who actually wears a tie showing the difference between his white collar world and the blue collar world of the open road he has found himself alone and immersed in.  Another place red shows up is the solid colored ball that the man playing pool knocks across the table in the caf scene which is the same red color as David's car.

In further looking at the theme of emasculation take special note of the radio crank call made to the IRS that plays on David's car radio right before David first encounters the trunk driver.  The man on the radio talks to a woman he calls up who works for the IRS about how he is not the head of the family but rather that his wife is.  He continues to talk about how his wife works, he stays home and takes care of the kids and the house work and even wears a house dress.  Yet he is embarrassed he is not the head of the family and tells the woman he is not certain how to fill out the form.  This scene is echoed shortly thereafter when David pulls into a station to get gas and when the gas attendant tells him he needs a new radiator hose (a phallic symbol that will come back to be important later in the film) David says he'll get a hose later.  The man tells him ""you're the boss"" to which David replies, ""not in my house I'm not"".  Also watch how David gnaws on the temple tips of his sunglasses, a great actor choice which also point to his emasculation.

Continuing with the use of red in the film, Spielberg wanted David's car to stand out against the landscape of the California Desert and decided that it needed to be red in order to pop out against the browns of the desert.  The car that was chosen turned out to be a Plymouth Valiant, the word ""valiant"" ironically meaning ""courageous"".  The truck in contrast has the rust tones of the desert to further amplify David's car is a stranger to the open road where the truck is a part of the land.  Also to note is the truck has eight license plates on it; one California one underneath in the front next to a red light and one on the back of the truck and then the following six reading left to right: Wyoming, Nevada, Idaho, Arizona, Montana and New Mexico.  The truck has been all over the west where David's car has the lone California license plate 149 PCE.  The PCE may stand for ""peace"" or possibly ""pace"" as in to keep pace with the truck driver.  It is also interesting to note the truck wears some red items on it such as the red lights, the red tank by the door, the brand name Peterbilt and the words FLAMABLE in large red letters in different places on the truck.  One interesting fact to consider is in the original short story Richard Matheson had the word ""KELLER"" on the truck which David thinks says/looks like ""KILLER"".

A lot of DVD's have extras on them but I strongly suggest watching the interview with Richard Matheson on this one and especially the interview with Steven Spielberg which is excellent.  Spielberg talks about how he was only given ten days to make the movie which he shot it in twelve or thirteen which is remarkable especially since as he says he filmed it all on location plotting several cameras on the road and shooting on both sides of the road to get the different shots.  He also discusses how they created an overhead map of the road similar to that of an architect that the movie would take place on so he could write out where the different scenes were going to be shot.  The map was so large it wrapped around his entire motel room.

""Duel"" is without a doubt one of the great suspense films of all time and not to be missed and this collector's edition is a great way to celebrate not only the movie itself but with the addition of the extras a way of looking into how this master work came to be made.",1414972800,,8387,4.267845862286797

215533,4,6300181987,"Duel: adapted by Richard Matheson from his novella; directed by Steven Spielberg; starring Dennis Weaver (David Mann) (1971): The late, great Richard Matheson adapted his own novella for this television movie, one of the first (and best) things ever directed by Steven Spielberg. Hitched to a great script, the young Spielberg pretty much shoots out the lights in this gripping, terse tale of Man vs. Truck(driver). David Mann vs. Truck(driver), actually.

Dennis 'McCloud' Weaver plays David Mann, a frustrated California travelling salesman driving through California's scrub brush and deserts to make an appointment. He's having problems at home, centered around his wife's perception of him as something of a nebbish. Then he innocently passes a slow-moving truck. All hell follows.

You can view this a great thriller with a sub-text that deals with a modern man's battle with his own feelings of inadequacy and emasculation. You can view this as a thriller of paranoia and terror, as the early stages of Mann's battle with the truck-driver (never fully glimpsed at any point during the movie) repeatedly put Mann in situations in which no one believes that he's in a duel to the death with a crazy person.

Weaver is flat-out terrific, sympathetic and squirmy. Screenwriters aspiring or otherwise should look at this film as a model of how to effectively use voiceover narration in a movie. We're privy to Mann's internal dialogue at points, and it's beautifully done. The scenery is suitably deserted. The truck, as much a character as Weaver, is about as sinister a vehicle as one could want, grimy and menacing and way, way too fast for its weight class.

Duel taps into very specific fears related to driving, and driving around large trucks. But it's also rich and wide-ranging in its use of fear and suspense. There are moments that have the quality of a nightmare, and suspense scenes that Spielberg would never surpass in all his later years of film-making.

In a way, this is a companion piece to two of Matheson's great 1950's novels that were adapted into movies, The Shrinking Man and I am Legend. Both dealt with self-doubting masculinity left virtually alone to confront some mounting horror. Taken together, they form a triptych, though I am Legend has never received a satisfactory film adaptation in the way the other two have. Highly recommended.",1407888000,,2370,5.051150895140665

Basically it is about a business man (excellently played by Dennis Weaver) on his way to work in a small car being chased by a large 18 wheeler. The driver of the truck wants to kill the man just because he passed him. The truck has licence plates from the states where the driver of the truck has killed a person. Everywhere the car goes, the truck goes. If you like suspenseful movies, then this is one movie that you have to watch. The part that makes it suspenseful is that the driver of the truck is never shown. I won't give anything away. You have to watch it to see what happens.  Oh yeah. I almost forgot.

Apparently this truck driver is nuts or a killer and wants a competition to get this man killed behind the wheel.  This movie gets you to fear big rigs because you never know what kind of driver is in control of them and can turn them into one large killing machine.

Unfortunately this DVD release from Universal has omitted the wonderful dinosaur growls as the truck is meeting its demise. It is no longer in the soundtrack. Even weirder is the fact that those very growls are discussed by Steven Spielberg in the bonus piece and then a clip is shown that HAS the growls. Why would Universal do this?
Also missing is the 74 minute version of the film which many fans, including myself, prefer. Whatever your opinion, it would be better to have both versions available instead of just the longer cut.
Here's hoping this film gets a proper release with BOTH versions and the original mono soundtrack with the growls (which would also show up in Jaws). It would also be great to see some original ABC t.v. spots and perhaps Billy Goldenberg's score isolated.",1399161600,12,809,4.74468085106383

Cat and mouse between a car and a tanker truck through nearly barren foothill type terrain for 90 min can be pretty painful.  Having the driver of the car do some absurdly stupid things just to drag the plot along doesn't help.  The acting wasn't very good.  The ending of the movie didn't make much sense either.

His visual styling is readily apparent, and the brilliant way he constructed the film in less than two weeks is nothing short of astonishing.  The commentary is indispensable.

The film's plot from Richard Matheson is perfectly simple, and all the more pulse-pounding for it.  It still holds up very well and looks just terrific, especially considering it was a TV movie (imagine if we had such effort put into TV movies today).  Dennis Weaver's performance is very quirky, as usual, and especially unhinged towards the end as he bravely portrays a man pushed to the very edge by a faceless horror.

Steven Spielberg's first movie, & man is this one a nail biter! Made for TV in 1971, Dennis Weaver plays a traveling sales man on his way back home, when he encounters the semi truck from hell! Maybe the first evil vehicle movie ever made, & certainly the best! We really never get to see the driver of the truck, so are left pondering if this is a maniac, or a maniacally possessed 18 wheeler. One white knuckled chase scene after another happens, as Weaver plays a dangerous game of cat & mouse with this mechanical monster on 18 wheels! One will never forget the semi's horn blaring, like some horn blowing from the very depths of hell, warning all, it's coming!

Superbly directed by Spielberg, edited, & acted by Dennis Weaver, this film will make you think twice every time a semi blows it's horn behind you on that lonely stretch of road!",1371945600,2,868,4.487341772151899

215613,5,6300181987,"There are a handful of movies that I absolutely must stop and watch if I come across it while flicking channels. Duel is one of those movies. Just spectacular.

I notice some of the comments here that mention how it could have been more exciting, needed other characters to be developed. But that's the beauty of this movie, and many of that time. They didn't rely on explosives and animation and the big bang. This is a mental ride. And being that the movie is focused on just one person, you virtually feel his anxiety within 15 minutes of the movie. You start thinking like him, looking at the road in front of him, wondering what you'd do. Every time I watch I try to put myself in that place - I was only 3 when the movie came out. But what *would* I do on a long highway with an idiot behind me, an old car and no cell phone? What would I do? In one scene he lets a van pass him and I wonder why didn't he stop 'em, park the car somewhere and hop in. Why, Dennis Weaver? WHY???? I know, it's a movie but it's a thoughtful movie. After all these years it still gives me a brain massage any time I watch.

I watched this with my best friend's daughter previously and about halfway through she asks, ""Auntie Pat, those old cars didn't have cell phone chargers?"" Bless her heart. In her world this movie is over in 25 minutes: truck guy scares Dennis Weaver, Dennis snaps a pic of the license plate, calls the police on his iPhone, the cops head the truck off at the pass and the driver is arrested.

I remembered the feeling of the movie, the helplessness and terror experienced by David Mann.  But this time I caught a line he spoke after crashing through the fence across from the cafe.  In the restroom of the cafe he said ""....and then one stupid thing happens -- 20,25 minutes out of your whole life -- and all the ropes that kept you hangin' in there get cut loose.  And it's like -- there you are -- right back in the jungle again.""  Since the movie was produced during the Vietnam War, I thought perhaps Mann had been a soldier -- and perhaps the truck was a metaphor for what is now termed PTSD. Am I reaching here?  I didn't read all 257 other reviews so don't know if anyone else came up with this premise -- or if like most agree it was just ""every man"" versus a horrific encounter.

Spielberg's success with this film early in his career then gave him the opportunity to do 'Jaws,' and the rest is history. Previously he had done Night Gallery and Columbo, and was only 23-years-old.

What made the movie even more interesting was the clip with Spielberg at the end, explaining how he went about shooting the movie in only 12 days on location.

When your daddy says ""I've seen that guy on something before"" you say ""He was on Gunsmoke.""

It's pretty much just a big tractor-trailer truck chasing a car and trying to run him off the road. That's it. You have to see it though. This movie is shot so well that you actually get the feeling that you are in the car and trying to avoid the semi!

In the 70s we didn't have the term ""Road Rage"" or the kind of C.G.I. you see today. That means what you are seeing pretty much had to happen and be captured on film and this movie accomplished that in a big way.

Sure, the clothing and look is a bit dated but that in my opinion adds to the appeal - if it looked modern then you would just expect Dennis Weaver's character to whip out a cell phone and put an end to the movie at any time!

This is a truly great film. The suspense is built gradually and Dennis' monologues throughout the film are perfectly done. It is incredible how the director was able to use multiple angles to avoid the monotony which could easily develop in a movie centered on a driver. Not seeing the truck driver is, of course, brilliant as well. My wife had never seen this and she enjoyed it as much as I did.

I think my favorite scenes are how the evil truck driver deals with the school bus (no spoilers but it isn't what you might think) and the scene my title refers to. I still sometimes say that out loud in traffic (but that's probably something I shouldn't admit to!)

The extra features on this disc were great as well. It was fun learning the details especially how quickly the shoot for this film was done.

215646,5,6300181987,"Duel, where to begin!?

Spielberg's first film ever! Let's start with that!
Yep, for those of you who didn't know, this was the first ever full-length film directed by the master of Hollywood: Steven Spielberg! And what a film it is!

Spoiler Alert! Do Not Continue Reading If Not Previously Viewed!

The movie begins in the first person view of the car driven by Dennis Weaver, the star of the film. Viewers listen to the radio in the car as we are taken for a drive down America's highways. We get to know Dennis as an ""average-Joe"" typical business man on his way to a meeting somewhere out of town.

After driving a while, Dennis' trip is slowed by a large lumbering Peterbuilt Tanker truck hogging the road. Thinking nothing of it Weaver passes the truck with ease, only to have the truck shoot by him a moment later and slow down in front once again. Upon his second attempt to pass the trucker's temper is sent over the deep end and the chase is on.

The rest of the film is a toe-curling, nail-biting, suspense-filled chase through the desert that never loses focus or gives you a chance to catch you breathe!

From beginning to end, this movie keeps the viewers glued to their seats while at the same time they are struggling to rip themselves free from the tension. From the chases, to the mind games being played on the protagonist, Duel is THE BEST Thriller/Suspense movie I have EVER seen. I would recommend Duel to any movie goer and Steven Spielberg movie lover.

Overall I give this movie a 10/10. Spielberg never loses our attention and keeps us in our chairs throughout the duration of the entire movie, no matter how much we need to use the restroom!

If you haven't seen a thriller before, bring some snacks, or you might just bite you hands off! You will be grinding your teeth and clutching your seat cushion from Point A to Point B in this wild ride!

Easter Egg: you can see young Spielberg in the phone booth scene, just as Weaver enters the booth, look at the glass reflection in the lower right-hand corner of the booth.",1337212800,4,2047,4.495956873315364

It seems it will always be a great movie but I have, since first viewing it, become an Old-Time Radio aficionado and have discovered, as there is much in movies & music today, taken (borrowed, sampled, whatever..) the same was true in the genre from decades ago.

This movie is not all that original and the idea was probably taken (borrowed, purchased, given, lent, who knows) from a radio programme named Suspense. There is a Suspense episode, from the late 1940's, where this truck driver (a pick-up or tow truck) would terrorise this man & woman couple along the highway. This truck driver was almost never seen and would sound a frightening horn from his truck and would try to run the couple off the road.

Once I can remember and relocate the name and date of this Suspense show, I'll return and post the info. You can then be your own judge. Or, research it yourself in the meantime. You may be surprised just how much has been taken from old radio progeammes. It surprises me to no end when a ""new movie"" come out and I recognise it to be from a radio show performed 60 to 70 years ago.

215659,5,6300181987,"Saw ""Duel"" many years back - I'm 64 now, and STILL REMEMBER JUST ABOUT EVERY SCENE!

A totally engrossing, eerily sinister portrayal of the dark side of human nature.
That unknown truck-driver trying to pay back Weaver for passing him (her?) does not let up until the very end, after Weaver tries everything sane in the book to lose him (let's assume it's a him!), and finally almost comes to resemble his pursuer in the mindset change that overtakes him in the name of survival!

To this day - and I haven't seen this film for a long long time - I sometimes get flashbacks about this scene or that, orchestrated by the great, and soon-to-hit-the-blockbuster-circuit(!  because of this one!), STEVEN SPIELBERG!  Rod Serling would have loved him!)).

So ominous and scary is this unseen truck driver, his big rig like some fantastical
oncoming T-Rex in Jurassic Park with Sam Neill and the kids in that speeding jeep in the jungle being the intended victims!  Before this, Dennis Weaver was that guy with a limp on Gunsmoke (hey, I think it was ""before"" - give me a break!  It's been so many years!) - and his portrayal of a flummoxed and hyper-frightened regular guy just wanting to get to his destination in his rental car(?) out in the middle of nowhere is so real, so devastingly real, that you feel you're right there in the front seat beside him, as scared as he is at the monster mind trying to ride you into the ground!

Steven Spielberg, and Weaver(!), both deserved some kind of award for this movie!
It gets inside of us - to ""The Heart of Darkness"" that resides in all of us and, we hope!, is usually held under control by eons of evolutionary thinking brain development.  But, not in this case!  I still see the scenes after all these years,
the swerving on the highway to get out of the path of this oncoming monster semi with its even more monstrous driver (made so by Spielberg's wise and insightful decision NOT TO EVER SHOW US OR WEAVER its psychopathic driver!

Whatever you do, if you loved The Twilight Zone, if you love many of the great later Spielberg movies, if you love horror done in a way that strikes home BECAUSE IT FEELS SO REAL!, then get this movie - have a full glass of a good whiskey or brandy handy (or a tranquilizer!) - and plop down into your comfortable and caring
""loveseat"" AND WATCH A MASTER AT WORK!

215660,5,6300181987,"I thought this movie was superb! A motorist (Dennis Weaver) is on a long journey when he incurs the wrath of a murderous truck (I say 'truck' and not 'truckdriver', because the truck itself is the character - a monster on the rampage). The rest of the movie is spent in Weaver trying to get away from the truck. Every aspect of the movie underscores the motorist's puniness and lack of power; his car gives him trouble; it is not as fast as the truck, and the driver tries (in vain) to indentify who the truck driver is.

In fact, we never see the truck driver. We only see an occasional arm or hand. This emphasises the fact that the truck is like a prehistoric monster with demonic strength.

Dennis Weaver is superb. He virtually has to carry the entire plot himself. He expresses the motorist's rising sense of panic, and his feelings of increasing desparation as he tries to get out of his life-and-death predicament.",1315180800,,922,4.548192771084337
215661,5,6300181987,"Can't say enough about this movie. I remember seeing it when first shown on television in
the early 70's. 'Duel' is an early, suspense-filled masterpiece of filmmaking by Spielberg
and shows the burgeoning genius that his subsequent work would fully exhibit. This film has all the
trademarks of a Hitchcock film (which is fitting since Hitch as it turns out was one of
Spielberg's idols). The mysterious, unseen menacing truck driver, the creepy randomness of
the attack (envision 'The Birds') etc etc. Dennis Weaver does a brilliant portrayal of a victim
trying in vain to figure out the motive for a truck driver's murderous rage toward him while at the
same time just trying to survive the ordeal itself. As he contemplates in the cafe restroom: ""You just
go along thinking some things never change, like being able to drive on a public highway without
someone trying to murder you...the ropes that have kept you hanging in there have all been cut loose,
and there you are, right back in the jungle again."" Weaver was in his late 40's when this was made
and it's amazing that he did most if not all of his own stunts and these were extremely dangerous
like the close call with the phone booth attack (""I'd like to report a truck driver that's been
endangering my life.."") Perhaps most notable is how many scenes are at one time both terrifying
and hilarious, like the extreme closeups of Weaver screaming hysterically while the truck moves in

Dennis Weaver's portrayal of David Mann (""that's M-A-N-N"") as a everyman who suddenly finds himself in a struggle to survive is just so funny at times.  Certain scenes - such as the diner where he just HAS to spell out that he wants R-Y-E bread, or towards the end when his little Valiant car is overheating and he is freaking out at the wheel, just crack me up.  Weaver did a great job portraying an average, skinny little guy gradually sinking into hysteria.

He tried in 1971 to build a thriller in the road tradition, road rage and other brutalities. A poor man in his car crossing some desert area in California is chased by a truck that was not for him going fast enough and that he dared overtake. The chase will be a full success without a real ending. It is not a masterpiece just because of that. The frenzy is too long and hence too slow and chaotic. A scene of that type cannot last more than ten minutes. And the end does not bring any solution. The truck is destroyed, fine, but the flammable product in it does not explode, shucks. But the driver does not come out to haunt the dumb car driver who had defied him. That's a shame and he stays there sitting in the desert with no car, no water, a full blasting sun on his head and miles away from the closest desolate road where there is one car every two weeks. What was he doing on this road anyway? The best part is the rattlesnakes, the tarantulas, the boas, and a few other creepy crawly animals, but this time it was too short.

215681,5,6300181987,"Duel is one of my favorite movies. One i can pull off the shelf and view again and again.  The story line is well covered by other reviewers, so i'll spend a moment on other areas.  Duel reminds me of the kind of suspense Hitchcock was so well known for and a little bit like some of Stephen King's works.  This movie builds a generic character (Dennis Weaver) as just a normal guy.  The kind of guy you see every day in the restaurant, or car beside you.  The development of his character and who he is throughout the movie is intriquing from the start.  Opening: he backs out of his non descript suburban home, drives down his street, 'coasts' through the stop sign to turn right(St. Louis stop hehehe).  Them proceeds down a business district street.  He drives STRAIGHT thru a left turn only lane, then as he approaches pedestrians in the cross walk, slows just enough to let them cross in front of him.  All very typical driving patterns of people who don't have a policeman in their rear view mirror.  He drives through a lonely stretch of highway listening to talk radio and talks to himself as a comment or laugh at what's being said.  We've all been behind people driving (not just trucks) who seem to ignore basic courtesy, traffic laws, and common sense.  In this case, the trucker is downright crazy or suffers from a severe case of road rage.  Weaver's character changes as the movie progresses.  Instead of being the 'nice guy' don't make waves guy, or passive driver, he becomes aggressive, defensive, and vindictive while still remaining the victim.  Indeed the Duel is a most interesting character study and an excellent story.  It brings out the inner hidden feelings most of us have or would have if put into an unbelievable/outlandish situation.  In the Duel, we experience that rarity, temporary suspension of disbelief.",1286755200,3,1841,4.703125
215682,5,6300181987,"Well Duel is a masterpiece of film , Jaws is my favourite film of all time but in a lot of ways Duel tops that movie. I first saw it on television in the early 70's and then they brought it out at the theatres with the extra scene with the bus in it(and a different truck)that brought the running time up to more of a theatrical release.

I have never met a guy who does not love this film , my wife hates it and even though their will be ladies out there that will be a fan of it I suspect this is more a guy kind of film. There are three road films that were made in the early to mid 70's that define that era and they are:Duel , Vanashing Point , and Dirty Mary Crazy Larry-now that would be a great triple feature but lets get back to Duel.

I have always thought Spielburg was at the top of his game when he made it , even though he has made some great films over the last 40 years. Duel is a psychological film with Dennis Weaver in my opinion giving his finest ever performance(and I am a big Gunsmoke fan)worthy of a Oscar. The camera work is great and the close ups of the truck with that oily look make it even better.

When Spielburg had to extend the film he had to scour the U.S for the same kind of truck remembering he had wrote the original off at the end of the movie. You can see the colors are just a bit off when the truck goes to help the stranded school bus but other than that there is not many faults with the film in any other aspect.

This film should be used by film students as a learning tool on how to make a great film on a small budget , we actually need to start making tv movies like this again so one day we might find another Spielburg.",1284768000,,1672,3.9088235294117646

It was SO DEEP that i had to lower the volume of the sub, because it felt like my flat/living room was shaking. It felt like that truck was right in front of me.

Those that remixed the original Mono to DTS 5.1, did a really good job in my opinion. I was also pleased that the dialog in the Center was good. I liked that the rear speakers was often used to great effect, like hearing directional effects(which i really like) and when his car was rushing by and when he skidded his car.

215685,5,6300181987,"Still, to this day, DUEL (1971) is perhaps my FAVORITE Steven Spielberg ""film""! Technically released as a made-for-TV movie in 1971 in U.S., it was re-marketed and theatrically released on Europe as a feature in 1972. Not surprisingly, it was a major success in both arenas, garnering major award nominations (Golden Globe for Best TV movie and Emmy noms for Sound Editing and Cinematography) and even garnering a film festival award as Best Feature Film of 1972. The then early-twentysomething Spielberg was immediately hailed as a phenom and the rest, as they say, is history. As far as I'm concerned, DUEL is a FILM. As good or better as any debut of an actual feature film of an up-and-coming director...and just as influential.

DUEL is a thrilling psychological tale of a cat-and-mouse game between a psychotic truck driver and David Mann (the perfectly cast Dennis Weaver in a magnificent performance), a weary family man and salesman on a business road trip. Mann is just casually trying to get to his destination, when the trucker goads him into road rage by constantly passing and blocking him. Just when Mann thinks he's gotten the better of the trucker, the real ""game"" begins and it becomes a matter of life and death as Mann must navigate the desert highway to elude this pyschopath. Weaver perfectly relays Mann's slightly frustrated, meek, everyday Joe quality. I like the fact that the story never makes Mann do anything out of character or impulsive and forces him to react, rather than act, for most of the film. Even when he does kind of take action, it does a good job of explaining his inner thoughts and what motivates him to act this way.

DUEL, minus a couple of hiccups, is one of the best edited films as each cut serves an actual purpose to simultaneously move the story along and relay the intensity of the situation. It's of great benefit that Spielberg was forced to use his imagination with intricate camera work as this was even before the era of fancy special effects in films. And Spielberg's direction is rock solid BEYOND good! Hard to believe it took less than 2 weeks to make this classic!

It always fascinates me how an older film like DUEL, which SHOULD be dated, still manages to seem more modern than many of the films that have tried to copy it over the decades. ""Simplicity"" is a word that often comes to mind. DUEL is minimalist filmmaking in that it's told from a singular point of view and presented in a (feasible) way that makes us totally empathize with the main character's plight to the point where we can actually see ourselves going through this. Another thing is that DUEL was literally shot on location in remote roadside desert locales, which gives the film a timeless quality. Not to mention that all minor characters (the diner crowd, the elderly couple on the highway, the bus driver and kids, and the ""snake"" lady) come across as being very convincing in their bit parts. The dialogue is spare, natural, and realistic. None of that ""too clever for it's own good"" stuff you hear in so many flicks like this nowadays.

I still think this is one of Spielberg's top films, right up there with JAWS, probably the only 2 films that he's made that I don't think slow down or lag at any moment. I own the DVD with Spielberg's commentary and added scenes that flesh DUEL out into a ""film"" more than it's initial TV-movie-of-the-week presentation, and for the most part, I think these scenes are of benefit.....TV movie?.....Film?..... A masterwork whatever the format!",1279497600,5,3522,4.75
215690,3,6300181987,"This movie filled my spirit with strife. It seemed unending in its footage of driving on different roads that all looked the same. The man who drives on his way to work and than home to his same routine is caught in this mindless disconnected motoring when suddenly a semi seems to be playing a game of overtake. It starts out as a normal little car power struggle that we all experience yet wends its way to a full blown attempt at murder. The semi driver is never shown so it feels like its between the actual truck and the civilian driver. They try and overtake each other at first, with dangerous speeding and competitiveness, than the civilian takes on another role, it is not a game of who can be first, he begins to become a victim. He doesn't know what to do. He tries to confront the possible trucker at a cafe, but it is the wrong person. He is becoming more and more agitated. He can't lose the guy. It becomes deadly, knocking over a phone booth the civilian is in. Pushing him off the road, where he slams into a guard rail. The civilian isn't in touch with center and pulls off the road and than pulls back on, instead of just stopping and waiting for police, etc. He tries to call them but gives up, cus the phone is demolished. Its like the civilian can't give up his normal routine no matter if death is at stake. The emotion is very well acted by Weaver, who is the main character in this film. He starts out with the normal day to day stress and we see it build and his fear take over and again rational thought seeming to not be as present. The good thing I got from this film was the feeling of something being over. Over and done, no more, alive and safe. Free for the moment and still being alive. Thats when the routine of daily life fades and it doesn't matter anymore, you can sit and throw rocks and know that no one will be hurting you anymore.",1279411200,2,1872,4.231843575418995

Once the Dennis Weavers character make a harmless move on the road he is plunged into a game on the road that is not as far fetched as you would think. Meaning no harm when he passes an eighteen wheeled tanker truck he has the truck retaliate on him by passing him back up and then the game is on. Stuck in a hot dessert and being the only two on the road most of the time is the best stage to show how men on the road can break down to a primal instinct of kill or be killed. The cat and mouse game turns back and forth so many time through out the film and the best thing of it all is that the truck driver is never reveled.
The way people act on the road when they are behind the wheel is different then the personality that they show everyone in normal situation. This could be the first case of road rage that has been shown to the world. It is a film that is so far ahead of it's time for most Americans did not hear about road rage until the late eighties or early nineties.

215696,5,6300181987,"Duel was created by a young Steven Spielberg, way back before he became a Hollywood legend. No other film maker does suspense, like Spielberg does. This is certainly evident with Duel, which was Spielberg's first film. Dennis Weaver is cast as the main character, named David Mann. David is a rather milquetoast traveling salesman. He's a bit afraid of his demanding wife, and under constant pressure to perform well at his job.

One day, David sets out on a long road trip, to handle some important business at his job. David travels lots of deserted highways, to get to his destination. He has no reason to expect his journey to be anything other than a pleasant drive, out on those remote highways. But a deranged trucker harasses David out on the road, and turns his otherwise routine business trip into a nightmare.

This film belongs entirely to Dennis Weaver, as David. The few supporting characters, seem to be just incidental to the plot. Spielberg made sure that the whole thrust of the story-line, was intensely focused on David, and his quest to escape the insane trucker. None of the other characters take David seriously anyhow, when he tries to get their help to fend-off the trucker. David realizes in horror, that he is left all alone, to defend himself.

Dennis Weaver does a superb job, of portraying the terrified David Mann. Weaver makes the viewer believe that David is utterly shocked and bewildered, by his predicament. Spielberg's genius at milking every iota of the film's suspense element, is everywhere in this movie. For instance, the viewer always wonders if David will ever identify the trucker, or why the trucker is after him to begin with. Also, just as the trucker is closing in on David, David's car starts to malfunction. This is one of the most spine-tingling parts of the film, that will have you on the edge of your seat.

Duel is a sparse film. It was made during an era when most films lacked all of the frills, of today's overblown 'blockbusters'. It's all substance, without a slick veneer of style. If you like movies with genuine, cliff-hanger suspense and visceral thrills, then Duel is a must-see.",1261872000,2,2145,4.804878048780488

The truck driver is never seen, adding to the suspense and intensity of the film.  It's interesting to watch if only to see Weaver's emotional state, since he's usually a mild mannered character in most of his other movies.

""Duel"" is a highly entertaining and suspenseful movie, and one thing that makes this movie so great is how minimalistic the whole thing is! Think about it; how many movies can you name where the whole film is basically one giant chase scene? Any movie that can pull such a feat off and be interesting all the way through is a surefire winner in my book, and ""Duel"", being such a movie, earns a spot amongst other classic horror/suspense movie that I've seen.

With so little to work with, it makes it that much easier to add detail to everything. Details that were worked to perfect include that of the truck: If you look, it has a railroad track with a bunch of license plates on it...hhmm, a giant truck with the license plates of other cars on its front. Yep, we have a serial killer on the loose! Speaking of which, I also find it curiously interesting that they never show the face of the truck driver, which highlights that the scariest thing about evil is the unknown factor behind it.

One of Steven Spielberg's early directorial efforts, it is a classic among TV movies. Simple story of a working family man just trying to drive his car across the barren dust-beaten rural Southwest following, then being followed, by a truck. Soon the truck is trying to drive the poor urbanite off the road. A cat-and-mouse game ensues until things get nasty and it becomes evident that getting killed is a distinct possibility. The goings on take place on a simple stretch of interstate highway. The visual menace is the imposing truck with its exhaust, its metal, its speed. The psychological menace is in the intent, the perceived motive, the senselessness, the isolation. Its driver is faceless---we see a boot here, a rear-view window reflection there, a glancing back-of-the-head shot there. The terror experienced by this poor guy was predominantly in the expansive, intangible universe of his mind where civilized common sense gave way to paranoia and then to rudimentary survival. The lead was played by the always underappreciated Dennis Weaver whose TREMENDOUS performance I will never forget. The scene where he is trying to outrun the truck , with his car's radiator overheating,  struggling to get the faltering vehicle beyond the highway incline so that he can coast the rest of the way is memorable. The scene where he walks into a diner in a paranoid daze and surveys the farmers and truckers for possible complicity is a beaut. This was a tense, suspenseful, riveting TV movie and a classic one. Hopefully, it will actuate movie companies to put more of those lost but great late 60's and early-to-mid 70's TV movie gems out on DVD.",1250985600,2,1776,4.9397993311036785

Don't pass this movie just cause it a bit old. It has a good rhythm and good pace that won't loose you. Trust me, you'll think of this movie the next time you are out on the road and a big tanker starts to close in on you!",1247616000,7,1078,4.202898550724638

Simple and yet if you are a interstate driver and have encountered a bully along the way, this movie is the bomb.  Dennis does an awesome job as usual with his character and car limitations, with todays perspective.  My whole family loves to watch and rewatch this.  Hats off to Spielberg as well.

No flying saucers, no giant sharks...just an average business trip where Dennis Weaver happens to pass the wrong truck - and heerrre we go!

Dennis Weaver is excellent - his low key demeanor at the start, laughing at the absurd talk radio and then out on the two lane desert road, he comes across a tiredly slow moving, smoke belching, eye sore of a tanker truck.

All the scenes are so real and the simplicity of the characters is truly artistic. Just some folks at a diner, thinking he is crazy when he tries to express his panic regarding the maniac truck driver....the bland discussion with his wife on the phone, his sheer frustration in trying to identify the driver, the combination old style gas station and snake store! HA! The kids in the school bus....and of course - the chase!  Everything is so authentic and this film is timeless. Although it was shot in 1971...it could still play out today in 2009.

The camerawork, the sound effects, the editing are all superlative, and the pacing is perfect. Consider the challenge: Speilberg and Matheson had to take an extremely thin premise--businessman pursued/terrorized by trucker--and get ninety minutes out of it. Adding to the challenge, the main characters can't communicate with one other, and the central character is by himself, so the opportunities for dialogue are pretty spare.  Which is what makes this a masterpiece more than anything else. Spielberg was forced to tell the story visually, almost as a silent film (although the sound effects add quite a lot to the tension).

Overall an intelligent, though-provoking film.",1237507200,,839,5.109489051094891

Have we all not had a semi breathing down our necks on a freeway, interstate or elsewhere?  They could not stop if they had to and we would be a greasespot on the road.  Dennis Weaver is great as the unsophisticated salesman that is terrorized by this demon.  You feel the truck is driving itself, pre-programmed as you never see a driver at all, just feel the evil bearing down.  Spielberg works hard to build the tension perfectly in this movie. We witness the roller-coaster emotions of Weaver as he has gotten rid of him, then realizes he is still there, gets rid of him again, and he is back. The noise of the 450 Cummings (?) and the irritation of the horn, the air brakes, the rear-view mirror images of the monster.  A thrilling movie.",1221091200,,848,4.397435897435898

215754,5,6300181987,"Steven Speilberg made his mark on Hollywood with ""Duel"", which was his first ever full length movie. Originally airing on ABC as a Movie of the Week, ""Duel"" deals with a man, played by Dennis Weaver, who is driving on the highway and is terrorized by a madman driving a full-ton truck. A very suspenceful film, the direction is the best of any film made for television. This was the film that made producers realize how talented Speilberg was, and he was ultimately offered big screen films like ""Jaws"". The DVD is exceptional with a wonderful interview with Steven and the making of this classic. The film is fully restored and comes in full screen, as was the standard for movies made for television back in the early '70's. The running time is 90 minutes.",1218240000,,758,4.622222222222222

I have never forgotten it, and still get a chill down my spine whenever I see a tanker truck on the road. Duel is a great psychological thriller, made in the best Hitchcock style. Dennis Weaver is perfectly cast as the nervous, twitchy salesman in a Plymouth Valiant who tries to initially challenge a tanker truck on the desert road, not realizing that the driver is looking for someone to pick on. And pick he does. Just when you think Weaver has escaped the terror of the tanker, he's baaaaack! Taking place in the days before cell phones, the viewer really feels Weaver's isolation.

When I got it, I decided to ""test drive"" it, so I hit some of my favorite spots, like when David was talking to himself, and called the driver a miserable fat head, or when he lost his balance, when he got out of the car, after he crashed into the white fence, across from the diner.  So, I speed ahead to the end, when the truck falls over the cliff, and to my surprise, the ""truck roar"" was edited out from the scene!  I'm like, ""What tha....!!!???""  How could the truck roar (the same roar used in Jaws) be edited out!!!  It almost gave you the since that the truck had a life of its' own, as it roared to its' death.  Even worse, Spielberg mentions the roar, during his interview, on the dvd ""extra"" i.e. why he used it and what-not.  They even have the roar, as they show it, during his interview...BUT NOT IN THE MOVIE, ittself!  I'm almost certain that Spielberg is unaware that the truck roar was edited out from the dvd.

215782,5,6300181987,"Duel is the only Matheson classic where the movie actually has much similarity to the original Matheson story.  This may well be due to the fact that Matheson also wrote the screenplay but none the less this is a pretty unique factor for a Matheson story and something those who sat through the Wil Smith version of his masterpiece&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-Am-Legend/dp/1857988094/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I Am Legend</a>&nbsp;no doubt wish had happened there as well.  What makes Matheson's masterpieces in print work, is the ordinary man verse whatever the unexpected element factor is (in the case of Duel a tormenting semi trailer). The books are so successful because the reader can place themselves in the situation in the character's shoes, they think what I would do here? Would I do the same thing as the man character?  Would I survive?  The ordinary man readers can relate to is usually lost in the movie version as film studios try and fill cinema seats with more heroic or popular actors than your every day person is but not so with the movie version of Duel.  Not saying Dennis Weaver is an average actor by any means, just that he plays and every day relatable to the reader David Mann very, very well.

Even though this is a very low budget film (the film is made up of an ABC telemovie, shot quickly in twelve days and later expanded to movie length with the train crossing and car being pushed by truck and other added scenes necessary for the legal minimum length to show it in cinemas in Europe), I don't think that increasing budget or modernising it today Spielberg or anyone else could achieve a much better or edge of your seat thriller of a film.  It is really only the beginning shots before David Mann encounters the truck with the opening credit fonts and shots of 1971 version of San Diego and other towns being a bit dated.  Once the film quickly reaches the desert it could be happening in the modern day.  The only thing I think where Spielberg's lack of experience let him down was the final couple of minutes as the vehicles climb a mountain where continuality isn't achieved with the truck sometimes being right behind and in the mirrors of the car, and sometimes being a long way behind when it should have been the same or even gaining.

Apart from the great movie itself the DVD also comes with three mini documentaries.  The first being Spielberg recounting how he made Duel, the second a look at Spielberg and his early TV director career and the final an interview with Richard Matheson.  The first and last are very interesting documentaries where you not only learn how the film was made/story was written but get to know some trivia as well.  Spielberg points out due to the fact that the film was airing a few weeks after he shot it and he was out in the desert filming so never saw the camera on shots on screen, he never knew he was actually in Duel. You can see a glimpse of him in the back seat of the car in one shot and his reflection in the phone booth as David Mann calls the police and the truck bears down on him.  Matheson also tells us along with recounting the story of the truck that harassed him and a buddy on the day JFK was assassinated that he didn't think the story could last the length of a TV movie so was going to add a wife in the car but someone talked him out of it and he's glad they did.

The original trailer and some poster images and photos are also included.

Duel is a classic film that you'll watch over and over again!",1206230400,4,3554,4.582018927444795
215783,4,6300181987,"With Duel being his first film, Spielberg's potential is clearly demonstrated, and you can see the building blocks to future, more perfected works. There is a kind of an underlying ""Hitchcockian"", Twilight Zone aspect to the film, which is not surprising since the story is based on Matheson's work. When I saw this film as a kid, something struck me that made me a little uneasy--it was the faceless, unknowing identity of the semi's driver. Now after watching the film again, I realize what a nice touch this is. The driver takes on a ""demonic"" or ""hellish"" persona,  and whomever or whatever is going after the business man (Dennis Weaver) on the interstate is relentless to the point of absurdity. But, then again, that is what makes this film a great thrill to see again. This ""less is more"" theory of suspense is something that most directors don't pick up on, and the longing to know this driver's identity seems to get into not only Weaver's character, but the audience's as well.

There is also that level within the business man's head, the inner narration, to try to understand the truck driver's motivation for hunting him down. The scene that captures this best is when the man goes to stop at the diner to eat lunch and call his wife. Part of the scene is the ""outer"" point of view, where we see the drivers' eating and the patrons having a regular meal, but, at the same time the inner workings of the man's mind is frantic and gut-wrenching, especially when he sees that the ""empty"" semi is just outside the diner. As he inconspicuously looks around for shoes that might match the man behind the wheel, he contemplates within his thoughts whether a mad-man is after his life. That is what great suspense is about.

As far as other aspects of the DVD, I'm not usually a junkie for the extras when it comes to movies, but I found the extras that come with Duel to be extraordinary, specifically the interview and dialogue with Steven Spielberg. Spielberg looks back on the film, and gives a sense of how the concept of the movie came about, such as the inspiration to make Matheson's work come to life, as well as the tricks of making the chase scenes work. Also, he gives some insight into the film's amazing ending.

If you haven't seen this film yet, go check out Spielberg before he became Spielberg.",1203724800,,2318,4.605326876513317
215784,5,6300181987,"This was originally a short story which attained prominence and (well deserved) which appeared in Playboy magazine in the late 1960's.  Steven Speiberg's secretary noticed it and thought it would make a great film.  From there, Speilberg began to take the story and make a film out of it.

The original author, Richard Matheson wrote quite a few short stories from the late 1940's through 1970.  He wrote many of the 'Twilight Zone' stories, including 'Third Rock from the Sun', and 'Nightmare at 20,000 ft.'  Yet, 'Duel' may be the one story he is most remembered for.

David Mann (Dennis Weaver) starts out on an ordinary workday to make an appointment in another city and very quickly encounters a truck driver with a big rig and a psychotic disposition.  The rest of this movie is a non-stop thriller with lots of twists and turns (literally) and a dramatic conclusion.

The acting, filming, location, and direction is superb.  There should be more movies like this.  It is a timeless classic, that even though made in 1970, is as relevant and disturbing today as it was then. 'Duel' rivals anything Alfred Hitchcock ever did.  Yes, it's that good.

215785,5,6300181987,"DUEL is Steven Spielberg's first full length feature movie (originally made for the ABC Movie Of The Week and then expanded for theaters) and the one that put him on the Hollywood map. If you're in the mood for a good Hitchcock-like movie, this is it. Watch it when you're home alone at night.  The film stars Dennis Weaver and THE TRUCK. It starts out looking thru the lens of a camera mounted on the front bumper of a car backing out of the garage, then driving thru the suburban Los Angeles neighborhood, into the rush hour traffic of the LA freeway system. When you finally meet the middle-aged salesman on his way to meet a client somewhere outside of LA in a rural, desert area, he's turned off the freeway onto a lonely, two lane highway. That's where you also meet the co-star of the film, the Peterbilt truck with the tanker trailer. Peterbilt has the long, menacing-looking hood (the face) and the small windows (eyes) and this one looks like it went thru the Vietnam War and is dirty and greasy and has a set of various state license plates on the front bumper (which you learn in the commentary represent each state where he has killed a motorist). Sick of the diesel smoke blowing in the window of his red 4 door Plymouth Valiant sedan, Dennis Weaver looks for an opening to pass THE TRUCK. Whether it was passing it that triggered the decision to terrorize the motorist or he was just waiting for the right victim to come along, we don't know but we keep waiting to see the driver and there are many suspenseful moments when you think the two men will confront each other face to face. The movie is full of suspense as THE TRUCK tries to run Weaver down in the mountains and desert of rural California on a lonely highway. The suspense is constant so that you don't want to turn away for a minute or you might miss something. There is little or no foul language, no sex, just good old fashioned suspense and a fist fight and some vehicles doing damage to property. Very climactic ending. The movie was made entirely on location in 12 days, a phenomenal accomplishment.  Watch the interview with Spielberg and you will get a feel for the genius of him as a filmmaker.

It's so unrealistic, when was the last time a road rage driver followed you for 30 minutes or more?  Hardly.  They might follow you 5 or 10 minutes but most will just pass you and be like, 'C' Yah'.
The whole movie is just about some trucker, whom you never see his face, who apparently gets enraged by the driver having cut him off or driving too slow and he follows him throughout the movie.  I think the best part was at the end when the truck flipped, blood spilled from the side of the truck, you knew the driver had died or was hurt seriously, but even better,  the movie was ending.",1189814400,,848,4.1030303030303035
215787,4,6300181987,"At first i thought Steven Speilberg's Duel was a simple story of a guy on the road who angers another man and that man is going to terrorize him, and it is.  Then again never putting a face on the driver is a great move, it doesn't make the man and the truck human it's just this thing relentlessly chasing us, when you remember the movie you don't remember this specific guy chasing another you remember this thing coming after you.  That truck could symbolize anything we've been pursued by or feel unable to escape from be it credit cards, secrets, guilt or anything else you could think of, and for David Mann it could be guilt.  In an earlier phone conversation with his wife we learn that the night before David and his wife went to a party and another man was very disrespectful to his wife and David did nothing, which angered the wife and caused a fight.  Now here is this truck that is terrorizing him and David tries and thinks of every way possible to avoid confrontation and tries to rationalize what he did even though this guy is trying to kill him, but unlike the man at the party and I'm sure other times in David's life he is being forced to face his problems and isn't allowed a way out.
For all we know maybe after that fight with his wife and feeling emasculated David could've gone to bed and we are witnessing his dream.
The movie is interactive i challenge anyone to watch this with a group of friends at their house preferably with drinking involved and not talk to the screen.  We've all been in little altercations on the road and we all have an opinion on what David should do, i myself was annoyed with David many times.
Duel is also ranked 67th on Bravo channel's The 100 Scariest Movie Moments, which was a great show.

Absent his later big Hollywood budgets, the director's special knack for building tension is still evident, resulting in a spare, ingenious thriller. Weaver is excellent as the rattled David. For God's sake, Dave- stay off the road!",1183420800,2,324,5.372549019607843
215820,5,6300181987,"So here's an irony:  Thirty-five years on, the movie audience which Spielberg's later work helped to capture - multiplex consumers of overblown CGI, gross-out, slapstick, and ever-greater explosions - may not ""get"" this one at all (e.g. see some of its other reviewers here).  For anybody else - and this is most certainly not ""art-house"" either, don't be put off - here's an astounding, must-see thriller.  OK, so it's a wannabe western, or Hitchcock (or Beowulf, or Alien, or High Noon) on wheels:  None of that detracts from its great premise, which is delivered utterly without frills.

So many reasons to see this:

Spielberg is SO good at doing minimal (seriously, Steve, about time to get back to some of that?):  Pared-down music, only natural-sound detail; no human baddie, just a perfectly cast truck as the anthropomorphised ""killer"".  Even the shattering finale is captured on ordinary live film, albeit in one of the most awe-inspiring shots ever taken.

Great raw material:  OK, so of course the script dates just a bit, with what dialogue there is sounding TV-ish and a wee bit cheesy to the modern ear; and kids now seeing this film might snigger at the personal styling details and plot's obvious reliance on predating mobile phones; but hey...  We're right there for Mann (Dennis Weaver) from the very start, as it's vital that we have to be, because his story is so discreetly and elegantly constructed.

And as a piece of performance:  Not just by Weaver, who's entirely credible as the put-upon everyman reluctantly forced to find his inner warrior.  The film works because it sustains a gut-wrenching kinetic energy that few others ever reach (woeful comparison with, for example, the new Pirates III, which for all its frantic rushing about, quite fails to draw its audience into the action).  DUEL is all the more impressive because the whole movie is shot ""for real"" - perhaps partly because the frantic pace of its actual production (see below) seems to rub off onto the screen.  That it works at all is largely because it's propelled by uncannily perfect pacing of the long road sequences, which (as Spielberg acknowledges) only happens when you perfectly combine the ingredients:  obsessive planning of sequences; unobtrusively brilliant stunt driving; then-new moving camera techniques (including a contribution from Bullitt's road unit); and laser-sharp editing.  That's not to overlook the out-of-car scenes, which have a gloriously welcome fingernails-down-the-blackboard inner screech of Hitchcockian suspense - best of all in the diner scene (""which one is him?""), complete with some hilariously dark 'red herring' moments; the snake farm; and the old couple who (with pitch-perfect Buchan / Hitchock irony) mistake Mann for an attacker.

Visuals:  It's clear from the first frame that, as Fats Waller put it, ""the gods are in the house"".  Details are pin-sharp, not just as to focal clarity, but in their layering up the metaphorical landscape of the story, with every single shot both perfectly framed and constantly informing character and/or building pace; and that's a lot of shots, often complex and kinetic ones.  And all set in a serenely beautiful landscape, mocking the petty anxieties and feuds of the men and machines scuttling across it.  All the more surprising therefore to find in the bonus material that DUEL was made in less than a month:  just 13 days' shooting, including the 3 days of (ultimately unused) ""spare plate"" shots insisted on by the studio.

This DVD edition is deeply satisfying both for the transfer quality of the movie itself and for a joyous Spielberg interview.  Refreshingly modest and candid, the director reveals his debt to a quick-witted PA, to his production team and actors, and how great achievement springs from being young and hungry.  It's amusing by-the-by to see Spielberg look back on this period of coming to terms with the public impact of his own virtuosity, coming to realise how a seemingly minor movie shot in 13 days can outgrow its origins to signal his big breakthrough.  (Among all the fascinating stuff about how to get a 50-mph lorry to go at 100 mph, he also, touchingly, points out a couple of minor rookie mistakes you might not otherwise have noticed.)  Musing on the cultural impact that his astonishing debut piece had, stumbling upon a global audience, he notes that what started as simply a domestic ""TV ratings Titanic"" became, internationally, a bigger but quite different phenomenon: ""Here I was making a roadkill tribute to High Noon and Hitchcock, then the Europeans were reading in all this esoteric abstract symbolism about class warfare in America"".  It also, so he says, earned him the instant and lasting respect of Fellini (cue archive photo to prove this!).

Hey look, this film is basically an hour of a geeky guy in a little red car being chased up and down the mountain by one helluva scary truck.  You can find much more if you want to look for it - Dostoevsky stuff about man and machines, or the 20th century post-feminist crisis of male identity, or the jurisprudential question of whether we need to be able to attribute a motive to evildoing, etc - but, for me, what nails the simple greatness of this piece is that WE ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENS in the end.

I rarely go on the interstate, well becuase where I live I don't need to go on the interstate really, but I do live in a small town in south Georgia, alot of long roads through farm land etc.  And trucks like this one in the movie are always seen.

215825,5,6300181987,"What fascinates me the most about the film Duel is how simplistic it is.  Stephen Spielberg was given a car, a truck, the desert, a few town stops along the way, rocks and more desert and was able to make a 72-minute TV movie out of it (and then later expand it to 90 minutes for official release).  For those of you unfamiliar with the film, it's very simple.  A salesman is driving through a desert on his way to a business meeting; after he passes a truck that is going too slow multiple times, it escalates to a sick game of cat and mouse as our hero must drive for his life before the truck driver ends it.

Duel was Spielberg's first movie and is a great example of what can be done with very little.  The camera work is brilliant; Dennis Weaver's acting really draws you in to his character's fear and paranoia; and the truck always looks menacing.  The truck's warning Flammable seen on the side of the truck implies that the driver is a ticking time bomb just waiting to go off, while the multiple license plates on the front bumper imply that the he has killed before and is a possible serial killer).  There are many things drawn from Hitchcock films such as the constant usage of suspense to hook the viewer.  The greatest example of this is the fact that we never see what the truck driver looks like.  Sure, we see a hand of a foot every now and then, but we never get a glance at the man's face.  This little bit of missing information allows us to be afraid because we never know what kind of monster we are up against.

If you haven't seen this movie and are a Spielberg fan, hunt it down as quickly as possible.  It's basically the rough draft version of Jaws, as the death cry of the shark is the same sound used in Duel when the truck is destroyed.  I personally think Spielberg needs to go back and do another horror/suspense film like Duel or Jaws just because he was so good at it and it would be nice to have another film like those released today where as most horror films are just so bland and dull today, lacking a unique edge.",1172534400,5,2055,4.251928020565552

While NBC seemed fixated on the Sunday and Tuesday ""Mystery Movies""--McCloud (DENNIS WEAVER AGAIN!), MacMillan & Wife, Columbo, The Snoop Sisters (remember them?? Helen Hayes and Mildred Natwick???)--ABC seemed more ""groovy"", serving up 90 minute movies like DUEL and KILLDOZER with Robert Urich trapped on an isolated island with a demonically possessed bulldozer that's killing off the oil drilling crew one-by-one!  While, sadly, KILLDOZER isn't out on DVD, you CAN own and enjoy DUEL with Dennis Weaver!  Scary when you're a kid, still awesome when you're and adult, and keeps working even after multiple viewings!

An added bonus 35 years later???  Have fun checking out all the vintage cars and trucks, from the dirt encrusted Peterbilt semi-tanker to Dennis Weaver's plain-jane Plymouth Valiant four-door sedan and many more 1950's and 1960's rides!  Also great is the small part of the ""Snake-Lady"" played by Lucille Benson.

As scary today as it was in 1971 because of the frightenly easy to accept premise--THIS COULD HAPPEN TO YOU!  None of the goofy, computer generated, laws-of-physics defying special effects that plague movies of today.  Just honest-to-goodness REAL LIFE, REAL WORLD ACTION and FEAR.

A classic.  Guaranteed to make YOU think the next time YOU pass a decrepit 18-wheeler!

Written by the legendary Richard Matheson (Twilight Zone, Legend of Hell House, Somewhere in Time) and directed by a young (""soon-to-be legendary"") Steven Spielberg. Duel is a film that stands the test of time and delivers more geniune thrills than the majority of todays big budget, formula driven, action ""flicks"".

Elements of Duel have been copied, rehashed and borrowed ever since its debut in 1971. You can spot the influence of Duel in such films as ""West World"", ""Terminator"", ""Breakdown"", ""The Hitcher"", ""Mad Max"", and Spielbergs own ""Jaws"" just to name a few! But unlike many of the films that it inspired, Duel remains practically flawless 35 years later.

By highlighting the psychological aspects of the script and by shooting the entire film ""on location"" within a thirteen day period a certain timeless magic and a suspesful sense of urgency was captured on film. It's that sense of urgency that jumps off the screen, pulls you into the film, drops you onto a long stretch of desert highway and quickly traps you within the mind of a motorist named David Mann!

215897,5,6300181987,"Picture this: a 23-year-old directs a cast composed entirely of actors older than him (with the exception of a bunch of school children whose scene lasts just a few minutes), exceeds the producers' budget, fails to meet the imposed deadline, and comes up with a piece that still packs enough chills to terrify motorists 35 years later.

Eschewing plot intricacies and character depth, Spielberg brings us back to the time when movies were vehicles for no-frills storytelling. The sheer simplicity of the plot is in fact what makes Duel so frighteningly real to anybody who has gotten behind the wheel and traveled alone, especially on long stretches of highway.

One thing I noticed that was not mentioned by any of the other reviewers here is the fact that Duel plays out in real time. With the exception of one scene where a time lapse is compressed into just under a minute (when David Mann hides his car behind some bushes and waits it out for an hour or so before continuing his trek), the entire movie's events take place in the same amount of time as the movie itself. So what's the significance of this?  It makes the entire experience of our protagonist even more real. You get more of that ""oh-my-God-this-could-very-well-be-me"" feeling when you see the events unfolding with virtually no time lapses.

Spielberg holds the distinction of being the only director with five entries in the American Film Institute's list of the 100 Greatest Movies Of All Time (from 1896 to 1996): Jaws, Raiders Of The Lost Ark, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, E.T, and Schindler's List. I'll go out on a limb here, folks, and declare that Duel remains Spielberg's best movie. The others have not aged all that well. The awe and wonder of his fantasy flicks have faded, and so has the pathos of Schindler's List. On the other hand, the terror that Duel elicits has remained real as ever.

So does that lead me to the conclusion that Duel deserves to be in the 100 Greatest Movies list, in place of one of these five Spielberg films? It's a tough call, but I would have to say that at the very least, Duel just has to be the greatest made-for-TV movie of all time.",1135900800,5,2157,4.650918635170604

215940,5,6300181987,"I like this DVD, not only because it's the early Speilberg classic, but because the special features are really cool.

Of course, you get the classic...
A regular, mild mannered 70's salesman from Southern Cal, David Mann (Dennis Weaver) is on a road trip accross the desert to meet a client.
On his way, he has a simple run in with a mysterious, rusty, huge deisel truck with an unseen, mystery driver. As everyone knows, you never see the driver throughout the film, but it becomes obvious early on that this driver is crazy and has singled out Dennis Weaver's character for no aparent reason, and continues to terrorize and chase David Mann across the desert, until the climactic showdown.

A lot of films that have come out since then have drawn a lot of inspiration from this suspense classic, from the 80's (C Thomas Howell/Rutger Hauer ""The Hitcher"" comes to mind), all the way up to more recent suspense/horror films with more obvious influence from Duel, like Kurt Russell's ""Breakdown"", ""Joyride"" with Paul walker, and of course ""Jeepers Creepers"", which repeats certain lines and camera shots from Duel as an actual tribute...it would have been cool if the Bonus Materials had gone through and interviewed other directors who have referenced Duel in one way or another in later films. As far as suspenseful desert highway films go, this is the classic.

I like the original movie for it's 70's style cinematography, (the use of sunlight is really retro 70's, but is still cool) and for the details that, even that early on, Speilberg addded.

The special features are really good, especially the extended feature where Speilberg himself talks about the making of the film. Anybody who is an aspiring filmaker (like myself) would find this interview really informative, because he gives a lot of camera tricks and production techniques he used. He also shows the time saving techniques he used to shoot the entire film in as short a time as possible (he was only given 13 days). A lot of cool details are given out about camera angles, production techniques, why and how he picked the truck that was used, and more. Even though the film was made in 1971, a lot of the tricks Speilberg used then are still pretty ingenious, even today. Also the references to past films and filmakers (especially Hitchcock) was cool as well.

215941,4,6300181987,"It's neat to look back on a career, especially one as influential as Steven Spielberg's. Known for action films such as Raiders of the Lost Ark, Jaws and Jurassic Park and serious films such as Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan, he had to start somewhere. So we have his first feature debut(not officially, this was a made for TV movie while Sugarland Express was his first official theatrical release) which proudly wears its Hitchcock-like atmosphere on its sleeve.

David Mann is on his way to a meeting when he ends up running into a slow moving but really ugly looking truck and passes him. Only the truck ends up passing him too and pretty soon this truck gets into a big hissy fit, such as following David around and trying to run him over.

Narratively it doesn't seem like much: a guy and his car being chased by a guy in his truck(which we don't see, which makes it more effective). But somehow there's enough to make everything work better and never seems to falter in its pacing. You can probably count with your fingers how many times David looks behind him or the truck coming towards camera but you don't mind.

Also great is Dennis Weaver(who for some reason, facially reminds me of Burt Reynolds) who gives a nice paranoid performance as he's being mind****ed. One nice scene was after he ends up crashing in a gate he gets whiplash(this doesn't happen much in car crashes on film does it?). Spielberg oddly has a cameo, 2 actually: he's in the backseat on one shot and in a reflection on the phone booth.

Both of those cameos are featured in one of 2 big sit-downs with Spielberg himself as he remembers everything from his big map to a segment of the film an editor made from scratch and the dinosaur roar that the truck gives(which oddly I didn't hear on my speakers but maybe it was buried).

Weaver is a middle aged, middle class man riding in a humble sedan. He has a modest clash with a trucker on a desert highway and in turn earns the unrelenting hatred of the trucker whose lone focus is homicidal revenge. The uniqueness of the film is that neither the face nor the voice of the truck driver is seen or heard but throughout Weaver's journey across the barren southwestern landscape, the truck is always gaining in his rearview mirror or confronting him while making legal stops. Steven Spielberg directs this 1971 classic that leaves you in suspense as to the motives of the truck driver as this movie becomes a gladiator fight between the weak and un-powered, Weaver and his pedestrian car, and the strong and powerful, the truck driver and the engine and weight of his tractor trailer. The movie is virtually frightening as Weaver's character seems weak and powerless symbolized by his confrontation with a man he thinks is the truck driver while stopped at a remote dinner. After suffering an undignified physical trauma, Weaver returns to the road but again, the unseen truck driver continues to stalk Weaver as it becomes obvious that the hunted and the hunter can only finish with a violent and abrupt ending. The ending is all those things but considering the unresolved mystery, the ending is ironically satisfying. Devoid of other characters, the total action touched with a virtual close up of Weaver's racing mind makes one think this was an early Spielberg college film entry that was magnified by a studio budget, which may be why it's so unique.

215948,4,6300181987,"My parents had both seen this film when it was first made, and had always spoken highly of it. Last night, we finally checked it out from the library.

As some reviewers have said, the plot is extremely simple. A businessman in a small car is attacked by an enormous semi truck on a lonely California highway. But sometimes the simplest plots are the most effective, and the most tense. There is no room left for complication, for viewer confusion or structural inconsistency. You don't forget which truck it is that's really chasing him; there's only one. And it comes back, again and again, with frightening patience and consistency.

Dennis Weaver's acting is consistently good in this film. His reactions were understandable and well-portrayed. The scene where his voice-over depicts his thoughts in an almost stream of consciousness way when he stops at the cafe was very well done.

I have a few quibbles, of course--no film is perfect, and Spielberg was just starting out with this film.

First of all, there is the problem that Weaver's character never simply turns back. The truck is almost always just behind him or in front, waiting for him. If he had taken the opportunity, when it was in front, to turn around and go racing back for home as quickly as he could, it would have made more sense. Perhaps the truck would have still caught up, but if he had survived long enough he could have gotten back into habitable areas and thus out of the danger zone. If Spielberg had a reason that he did not, he should have had the character at least toy with the idea, and then reject it. Otherwise the viewers are left wondering why he keeps on going in the same direction, even after the truck has nearly killed him several times.

Also, at the scene in the cafe, when Weaver's character is searching among the men at the bar for which one might be the truck driver (we never see his face; only his arm and his cowboy boots), the men consistently turn around and stare back at him. I have been in restaurants numerous times before, and it is possible to look at people without getting stared back at almost every time. From his position Weaver's character is fairly far from the men in an inconspicuous position. There would be little reason for all of them to turn and look at them as though they knew he was staring at them.

But those are minor quibbles. In all the suspense was handled quite well. The film did not leave me with quite the sense of creepiness that some other suspense films--including Jaws--have, but perhaps that is because those deal with areas I have never really explored (I'm rather scared of the deep sea, and have never been in it, nor do I ever plan to be). But I've been on the highway a lot, and, scary as it would be for a truck to chase after you, it does not carry that sense of unknown possibilty that makes some suspense movies so effective.

But it was a good movie overall, and I recommend seeing it. The truck starts out looking innocent enough, but it will become almost a personality as the movie progresses...",1120608000,2,3054,4.541818181818182
215989,5,6300181987,"This was always a little Steven Spielberg masterpiece that always alluded me. Being a gigantic Spielberg fan, and him being the number one influential movie making source for me, I couldn't believe that I had never seen this little gem of a film. For years I kept hearing about this cool little road thriller that he did back in the early 70's. Before ""Jaws"", and before ""The Sugarland Express"". This one was an elusive little creature, as I couldn't track it down. Thankfully, they showed it last night on AMC and I finally got to see the ""lost"" Spielberg movie I hadn't seen. Was it worth the wait?. Yes and yes. I am always a sucker for a really good road thriller, and I have to say that this one is not only the starter of all road thrillers to come, but it's the granddaddy of them all. Spielberg was only about 24 years old when he directed this, and you can see from the start of the Spielbergian flourishes that will come into play later in his career. Dennis Weaver, best known from ""Gunsmoke"" and ""McCleod"", stars as David Mann. A traveling salesman. Weaver plays the character as a real normal, every day kind of guy, which makes the material hit closer to him, and make the audience more connected with the character and his plight. As Mann is traveling to get to an appointment thru the rustic scenery of California, he is confronted by a big, ugly, rusted looking rig. Menacing and imposing, the truck itself is a character all it's own. From here on out, the mysterious rig begins to play a serious and deadly cat and mouse chase with Mann. Wherever Mann goes, the truck is there. He stops to eat, use the phone, try a phone, everything. He can not the shake the killer truck off. Finally pushed to the edge, Mann tries to save his life and stop this menacing rig once and for all. The movie is perfectly executed by Spielberg, and it amazes one that this is a TV movie. They sure don't make TV movies like this anymore, folks. The truck is the character. It's not so much about the truck driver as the movie rolls on. It's focused solely on the truck. As if it is not being controlled and driven by a human being, but is it's own self. It is it's own person with a mind of it's own. A piece of rust and metal that will keep charging forward no matter what, until it finally gets it's prey. It's no big surprise that Spielberg has pointed out the similarity to this and to ""Jaws"". The film doesn't really have a whole lot of dialogue. What dialogue there is is Weaver's inner voice speaking to him. Trying to figure things out. It's a different and ingenious way of handling things. The fact that there is less talk in this movie, just adds to the overall vibe of the film. Spielberg really shoots the film as if you were there. As if you can feel the California heat on the pavement, and feel the rumblings of the truck behind you. He uses brilliant techniques to shoot the film, and shows you that this is one guy who will become a masterful storyteller. Unless you read the one star review below from a reviewer who didn't seem to get it at all. He makes the movie very bare, with little to no dialogue, no main characters other than Weaver's, and basically lets the suspense and the surroundings play itself out and tell the story. From beginning to end, this suspenseful yarn is pretty much non stop. Car chase to car chase, with nice little touches here and there that Spielberg sets up to make the viewer wonder who this driver could possibly be. It's a very impressive film debut, and after seeing this debut film, it's really no surprise that the director went on to become who he did.",1120348800,,3610,4.3976083707025415
215990,1,6300181987,"I understand that this was Steven Spielberg's first movie, but WHAT ON EARTH possessed him to make such a plotless piece of crap??

Seriously, the movie has no plot WHATSOEVER. Sure, it is psychological but he could have chosen to show the insecurities that we have in our minds in a more substantial way. The plot, for instance, could be more realistic and definitely more meaningful. Sorry Steven, but in this you definitely do NOT cut the chase.

Another movie of Spielberg's that made no sense to me was Close Encounters of The Third Kind. Do NOT watch this, people...you can't say I didn't warn you!",1120003200,6,604,4.688679245283019
215991,5,6300181987,"Wow! Who says you need blood, guts and gore to make a good horror movie? Sometimes all you have to do is place yourself in a person's shoes and feel their utter terror in order to experience true horror chill through your bones. I still can't believe that this is director Steven Spielberg's first film. He should have gotten the 1971 ""Rookie of The Year"" Award.

Ever experienced road rage? I have. Usually it was in the form of an obscene finger gesture. But road rage comes in other forms; forms such as gigantic semis with ""Caterpillar"" diesels roaring at your car bumper. With 1971's ""Duel,"" you are literally put in the drivers seat with Dennis Weaver on one of the most hellish highway races around. I remember watching in horror with my heart doing flips in my chest during my first encounter with this movie on television years ago. I've seen this movie several times since.

Dennis Weaver, perfectly cast for this role with his panicked deer-caught-in-the-headlights eyes and his chilling hysterical shrieks, plays a salesman named David Mann who is on the road to an important meeting. On the way, he finds himself coughing behind the fumes of a huge semi in front of him. We find out pretty quickly that it does not take much to piss this semi-driver off. After they each take their turns of passing one another, the semi driver promptly leads David Mann on into an on-coming car. Okay....this is not your ordinary Sunday-drive on the road.

The suspense builds as the semi virtually rides Mann's bumper down the road at at least 100 mph in a seemingly endless saga, forcing Mann to go beyond all limits and finally come ""crashing"" into a nearby ""Chuck's Cafe."" What follows is one of the more humorous parts of the film when Mann becomes suspicious of everyone in the cafe being this dreaded driver, and ends up getting into a fight with one of the customers. Word to the wise, if someone tells you to ""Just cut it out"" and then slaps your sandwich out of your hand, you best put up your dukes and fight like a man!

Unfortunately the time comes for David Mann to be on his merry way, and he's off like a dirty shirt; sweat stains and all, back on the road again in that little red Plymouth. Anyway, I bet you can pretty much guess what lies ahead for the poor salesman. Actually there are many things lying ahead for David Mann from attempting to help a stalled busload of kids, to nearly getting pushed into a fast-moving train, to a frustrating encounter with a freaked-out elderly couple, to the stop at the reptilian gas station that gets rudely trashed. The semi driver was intent on creating a ""duel"" to the death with David Mann.

A bit of comic relief takes hold as Mann struggles to give a school bus of kids a push with his little red car only to be literally chased away by ""Mr. Diesel."" Adding to the comedy is the elderly couple whom Mann tries to stop and tell to call the police. Mann only succeeds in freaking them out and is chased away by the mighty ton on wheels. Then there's that classic reptile gas station, and I must say, I felt so bad for the woman running the place. Here is a middle-aged woman who is passionate about her caged snakes, lizards and spiders surrounding the station. She's clear out in the boonies and probably gets hardly any business at all. Needless to say, she is overjoyed when David Mann pulls up to let her check under the hood of the car while he checks into a phone booth to call the police. Unfortunately the diesal takes care of the poor lady's station in an attempt to get after Mann. Obviously, Mann needed to heed Dr. Diesel's wishes and get back on the road of terror where he belonged.

Probably the most terrifying part of the film comes toward the end when Mann is being chased by the semi up a grade. If you have not watched this movie before and are planning to watch it for the first time, you may have a difficult time getting through this part and need a paper bag to breathe in. This scene involves a radiator hose, lots of hissing steam, speed dials dropping, spine-tingling screams and pleading from David Mann ringing in your ears and the sound of the engine frying. And no, we're not talking about fried chicken. This all comes together to create one of the most edge-of-your-seat experiences around.

For those of you who have not yet seen this movie, I will leave you with a few little details. #1: You will learn just how handy a brief case can be when you're in a jam, #2: A fire's blaze can be quite blinding, and #3 Living on the edge will eventually leave no edge to live on. Unfortunately you may just realize it when you're flying off a cliff.

Something that is definitely worth a mention is the music of the film. It is intense, frantic; the music of an adrenaline rush echoing the rapid pounding heartbeat of someone on the run with racing thoughts filling the head. Urgent and screeching violins and other haunting sounds; I really mean HAUNTING, completely engulf you that much more into the terrifying world of David Mann and the deranged madness of the truck driver. Even the truck itself looks mean; dirty and metal-colored with a face only a mother could love. In this case, the truck and driver make perfect partners in crime.

Also definitely worth a mention are the highway shots throughout the movie. We get some excellent footage of the truck's tires grinding against the hot pavement as well as its foreboding bug-smashed grill. The quick shots of the speedometer dropping and speeding up in Mann's car is a fantastic touch, and the overall chasing scenes down the highway are very well done. You can feel the speed, the terror rise, and you'll be guaranteed to get very anxious.

Dennis Weaver does an EXCELLENT job in this film as we see some amazing close-ups of his terror-drenched face and his hysterical yells at the truck driver and at his own car to go faster. The close-up shots of him looking back frantically to see how far the truck is behind him, really add to the mounting terror. Weaver is a very versatile actor in that he can swing from the calm man listening to the radio on his way to the meeting, to the frantic man literally driving for his life.

The extras in the movie are worth the price as you get a complete history on how the movie came about, and the making of the movie with all the techniques, tricks and styles that Spielberg chronicles for us in his commentary. You'll even find out how he picked out his actors/actresses for the film, as well as the truck! It is quite interesting indeed.

I tell you, even though this is Spielberg's first full-length film, it is one of his very best works, let alone early works. As my heart raced and panic rose during my first viewing of the film, I remember my mom telling me that this was a Steven Spielberg film. Then I, totally engrossed in this amazing 1971 film, turned to her and said, ""Well that explains it.""",1119312000,5,6895,4.502797761790568
215992,4,6300181987,"Dennis Weaver plays a nice guy on a business trip through the dessert. He's got a shrewish wife and brats for kids but things could be worse. A whole lot worse. For reasons that the director, young Stephen Speilberg wisely never spells out a crazed trucker has taken a dislike to Dennis and spends the rest of the movie chasing him over the highway.

At first Dennis is surprised, then he's shocked then finally as he and the audience realize that he's in bad trouble and totally on his own, he's terrified. He's a civilized man in an uncivil situation and the only way he's going to survive is get just as smart and maybe just as crazy as his attacker.",1116633600,2,653,4.396694214876033
215993,5,6300181987,"I guess The twilight zone was, with absolute conviction, the main inspiration's source for Steven Spielberg in this hair raising and unequal duel between a simple man, who chose an unfortunate evening to meet a real mad driver who suffers undoubtedly of serious emotive and emotional disturbance when decides to make a race plenty of suggested and evident violence.

Few times in the screen you will be tied to your seat as in this picture. And through your emotive memories you have found as I do in my personal case, with this kind of guys who simply play to be the death's emmisares driving any kind of vehicle. All his inner anguishes and impotence state make of them assume the total command of the highway, until the transit authority makes its appearance.

But knowing Spielberg, his message goes far beyond still, I have not any doubt, the metaphor is overclear. The Vietnam affair still resounded and the use of the machine as death's device was in last instance another way to express and exert violence, may be you call urban violence but this germen lives in our souls and has nothing to do with tension states or worst still a honor question.

Dennis Weaver made a terrific role as the frightened driver who tries to keep the relative control of its own when he has to face during ninety minutes with this absurd and merciless nigtmare.

The first little gem of Spielberg!",1113436800,,1385,4.710743801652892
215994,5,6300181987,"Steven Spielberg, more than any other director, has become synonymous with the big budget Hollywood summer blockbuster. His film ""Jaws"" in many ways started the trend, and just about every year or so Spielberg debuts another jaw dropper. Let's see, what films has the big kahuna made since ""Jaws""? Hmmm, it looks like quite a few if his extensive filmography is any indication. After ""Jaws"" came ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind,"" a smash hit that still holds up well today in the special effects department. I guess we'll skip over ""1941"" since it tanked at the box office. Then there is ""Raiders of the Lost Ark,"" which needs no explanatory description. If you haven't seen this film, check your vital signs. Ahhh, ""E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial,"" a film that's sure to bring a tear to your eye. I could go on and on, I guess, but the above description is enough to pad out my usual context setting paragraph. Spielberg is a big shot whose films always draw attention, even the bombs. But even Stevie had to start out somewhere, and that's where ""Duel"" comes in. I'm surprised it took this long for the film to reach DVD.

Just as ""Jaws"" set the standard for every animal run amok film made since then, ""Duel"" did the same thing for killer car movies. Yes, there is a killer car genre, although it's much smaller than the animals run amok genre. Anyway, ""Duel"" stars veteran actor Dennis Weaver as a sort of average, everyday buttoned down business type who runs into far more than he bargained for during a trip across a deserted stretch of country. At some point in his travels, he angers the driver of an ancient, dirt encrusted semi-truck. Mann--that's Weaver's character--sort of shrugs the belligerent driver off at first and continues on his way. Most of us would do the same thing on a long trip, preferring to pay more attention to the radio and the road than waste time wondering what a touchy truck driver is doing. Heck, most people get mad on the road and then let it pass. At least they did back in the 1970s before road rage reared its ugly head. Problem is, Mann unfortunately angered a total sociopath, and a sociopath tends to NOT let things that irritate them pass by without a response. In no time at all this guy is following Mann, roaring up behind him, trying to run him off the road, and generally making quite a nuisance of himself. When truck drivers want to pose a menace to their fellow citizens on the highway, they can certainly do a good job of it.

Events escalate from nuisance to worry to downright fear as the trucker makes it quite clear he won't be happy until Mann dies horribly. He gets Mann so jittery that our hero makes a total fool out of himself at a diner when he thinks a poor guy eating a sandwich is the villain. Oops. Then there is the situation in which a desperate Mann trying to use a pay phone has to dive out of the way as the truck flattens the booth. What in the heck is it going to take to put an end to the madness? Well, Mann is going to have to stand up and be, pardon the pun, a man. He's going to have to swallow his civilization-induced cowardice and put this guy down for the count. It's sort of hard to imagine how Mann can do anything about his situation, however. He doesn't have a cell phone since it's the 1970s, he drives a dinky red car that couldn't run a bicycle off the road, and he's stuck out in the middle of what must be one of the most desolate regions in the nation. There aren't even that many other cars on the road to seek help from, and the few that do pass by make it a point to stay away from any potential problems. It turns out that a bait and switch routine might do the trick, but it all comes down to the wire as the milquetoast makes his final stand. Who will win? If you've seen any of Spielberg's films, the answer shouldn't elude you for long.

""Duel,"" considering it's a made-for-television movie, succeeds for a number of reasons. The biggest thing going for the film is that it's based on a Richard Matheson story with a screenplay written by Richard Matheson. He's an old hand at suspense and horror stories, so Spielberg started out with great material before shooting a single frame. The acting chops of Dennis Weaver give the story a lot of oomph as well. No one plays sweat soaked nervous like Weaver (see him in ""Touch of Evil""), and ""Duel"" is another example of this actor carrying panic to the nth degree. Spielberg says in an interview included on the disc that he jumped at the chance to cast Weaver in the film because he wanted a character who would properly convey a sense of overwhelming panic. A final reason the film works is Spielberg's direction. The same interview on the disc serves as a sort of miniature commentary track in which Spielberg relates a lot of the camera tricks he used to give the film a sense of frenzied pace. One interesting factoid concerns the sound effect he used in the film's denouement, an effect he used again in ""Jaws.""

Extras on the disc include the thirty-five minute interview with Spielberg (he refuses to do traditional DVD commentaries), an interview with Richard Matheson discussing how the genesis of ""Duel"" came about, an intriguing documentary about Spielberg's early career directing television shows (he worked with Joan Crawford at one point), a photograph and poster gallery, a trailer, and cast and crew biographies and filmographies.

Businessman David Mann is on his way to a business meeting when he nonchalantly passes a huge semi-truck on the interstate.  Before he even knows what is going on, Mann is being hunted down by the trucker.  At a crisp 90 minutes, this movie never slows down keeping you on the edge of your seat the whole time.  The viewer feels like you're there with Mann as the truck driver continuously tries to kill him.  What makes this made for TV movie that much more effective is that the truck driver is never shown, leaving the viewer to imagine what he looks like.  And just like Jaws made you scared of getting back in the water, Duel will make you wary of getting on an interstate the next time you need to go somewhere.

  Dennis Weaver is excellent as David Mann, the businessman being hunted down by a murderous truck driver in his gas tanker.  Weaver's emotions are completely realistic making the whole movie seem that much more real.  The fact that this could happen to anybody makes this movie all that more terrifying.  While Weaver is the only person with a big part, the huge semi-truck deserves billing as a character.  The truck is just as scary as the shark in Jaws because of its immense size and speed.

216038,4,6300181987,"DUEL is Spielberg's first TV movie about an innocent man (Dennis Weaver) who is pursued by an angry truck driver.  In this age of road rage, the movie is very relevant. What starts out as a long drive to a meeting, turns into a long drive to hell.  The film focusses on Weaver's emotions well, in particular during the cafe scene where there are six or so truck drivers at the bar and one of them is the person who has been following him.  Which one?  The mind games begin.  The film never reveals the actual truck driver which is good, because the fear of the unknown remains throughout the film.

DVD SUMMARY:  AS the movie was filmed for TV, the aspect ratio is 1:33.  It's unfortunate it wasn't filmed in widescreen to capture the landscapes better. The image is quite soft in parts, and crystal clear in others.  Considering the age of the film, the transfer is more than acceptable.  The DVD includes several special features such as a featurette on Spielberg's TV work titled ""Spielberg and the small screen"".  This featurette also includes discussions with Spielberg.  The other featurette focusses on the writer of Duel and how it developed from a short story to a feature length film.  There is also an audio commentary and trailer included on the disc.  To be honest, I was surprised to find a trailer considering the film was originally made for TV, not cinema.  SOund purists will enjoy the audio options available on the DVD - both DTS and 5.1.

OVERALL: Duel is nailbiting stuff, and is an accomplishment to Spielberg considering he had to film it in 10 days. He actually took 13 days to do it, and got in trouble for it as revealed on the DVD. Excellent camera work, and suspense make for a good night's entertainment. The DVD is worth buying to have Spielberg's first movie.

Duel is a ""forgotten"" classic, it is Jaws on the road! Why haven't I been told about this movie?!

To make the movie look the way it does must have required a LOT of planning, not to mention brains -and this because: No matter how simple the story may be, no matter how easy it looks the crew had no computer-help in 1971 for good effects other than editing and what was arranged to happen infront of the camera.

216040,5,6300181987,"It has been 20 years since I last saw this movie, and after watching the new DVD it still holds up.  It's a classic mystery/suspense movie, showcasing a deadly cat-and-mouse game on wheels. It's a David and Goliath battle between a puny red car, and a demonic truck with the implications of ego between the drivers. Superp camera angles further add to the suspense of the film. The beautiful scenery of the desert highway compliments the movie even further. Dennis Weaver's acting in the movie is excellent, playing the part of a humdrum salesman driving on the open road and going through the motions of the day- until he passes a menacing-looking truck.  Steven did great justice to a great story and plot by Richard Matheson.

There are however, a couple minor yet significant errors on this DVD.  Periodically, the movie captures the thoughts of David Mann as he struggles with his situation psychologically and emotionally.  Two of those essential audio clips were deleted from the dvd for some unknown reason.  In the original tv movie, both of these audio clips happen towards the end of the movie. The first one is where David Mann passes the truck from a dead stop- the part that begins the final chase sequence. Upon passing the truck, David thinks to himself:

""Okay. I passed him. Probably just what he wanted. Then he'll keep me in his sights until it's time for the kill.""  David then looks in the mirror and sees his nemesis rapidly closing in on him. He then says, ""Just what I thought.""

The second audio happens a couple minutes later while David is thinking about his strategy of beating the truck driver. His strategy is to get to the high mountain pass on the upgrade. He believes this would surely cause the truck to fall far behind. But how to get there while maintaining his distance with the truck is the concern, as David thinks to himself again:

""...But can I hold that speed over a distance? I've never done that before. Well, then again I've never gone through this before. Okay. Okay, I'll just keep remembering there's a muderer behind me.""

Both of these original audio clips I thought were essential parts of the movie, since they captured the FEAR and PANIC of the protagonist.

Last but not least, the ""dinosaur roar"" audio clip at the very end of the movie was also deleted. The original tv movie had the sound happen just as the truck was going over the cliff, and again as it crashed at the bottom of the mountainside. Ironically enough, Steven Spielberg himself talks about including that clip on the interview section of the DVD. So why did he leave it out then? I thought the ""roar"" was a perfect audio effect to include as the monster truck fell to its doom.

It was disappointing that all of these original audio clips were deleted from the movie. Yes they are minor changes, but nevetheless it takes away the originality of the film.

the whole idea of the mystery truck driver and many of the specific camera shots and ideas from this movie have influenced a lot of directors in recent movies, including ""Jeepers Creepers"" and ""Joy Ride"" just to name a couple...but this is the original and it's a very cool psychological thriller of the ""everyman"" vs the mysterious dangerous ""unknown person""...I think Spielberg pulled it off really well for a 1971 movie (I will say that this film SEEMS like it was filmed much later in the 70's then it was, which shows the influence Spielberg would have on film from then onward)",1098057600,2,912,4.883870967741935
216045,2,6300181987,"Like the other guy said, you might enjoy this movie if you are high.
You can certainly see all the Spielberg crap in it's formative stages.  His desire to create suspense at any cost, even if it means repeating essentially the same scene over and over, and drawing out scenes way beyond their logical end.  His willingness to create situations and behaviors that have no basis in reality.
This looks like a TV movie made by a talented teenager.  You can't say I didn't warn you!",1096848000,2,478,4.534883720930233
216046,5,6300181987,"33 years later, DUEL remains an excellent exercise in filmmaking.  Based on a Richard Matheson short story, Steven Spielberg's first real directing effort stands as one of the most sublimely suspenseful films made.  Although a TV movie, it ranks up there with some of the cinema's most interesting and different thrillers.

The story is pretty simple and one millions of commuters will find familiar:  a traveling salesman (played laconically and superbly by Dennis Weaver) is late for an appointment.  So he does what any driver would do:  he passes a fuel truck.  But it seems the driver doesn't want anyone to pass him, so he returns the favor, many times.  It becomes clear that this particular trucker is a vengeful, actually psychotic man, as he relentlessly pursues Weaver, obviously to kill him.  Spielberg made the wise choice of not showing us the truck driver, so in essence, the truck itself becomes the Freddy, Jason, Michael Myers, etc. of the film.

DUEL doesn't have splashy effects, no bloodshed, and a slam bang of an ending.  If it seems preposterous and dated, remember it's 1971, folks, and this kind of movie wasn't being made.  Spielberg and Weaver are to be commended on taking so little and winding up with so much.

An innovative film, and evidence of great things to come from Spielberg.",1096070400,3,1314,4.891402714932127

Now, years later, I tried to convince my wife that it was really a very suspenseful film, but it was not until she actually WATCHED it with me that she believed how compelling it truly was.

Totally ridiculous in that nothing that happened in this movie would, or even COULD happen on this planet.  I sat there watching this mess, as my brother urged me on.  I cringed at its ineptitude so many times, that I ended up getting cramps.

So what exactly was wrong with it?  OH, just the script, the acting, the direction, the production, the story...Just one non-credible scenario after another.  The protagonist (Weaver) was so retarded in everything he did, that I started rooting for the truck.  I figured that even on whatever planet this story was supposed to occur, Darwinism still could not be denied.  This guy was simply too stupid, weak, pathetic and annoying to be able to survive a single day on any planet...even Planet Spielberg.  But, in the end, not only did he overcome his adversary and actually survive, but he did it in the most ludicrous way...only fitting for such a disaster of a movie.

216089,3,6300181987,"I saw this the first time years ago on TV and was impressed. Spielberg did a great job and went on to make ""Jaws"" shortly after this and all the other great movies. Go into this understanding this is his first director movie and it was made in the early 70s and you will be impressed. Dennis Weaver does a great job as an auto driver that somehow enrages a semi fuel truck driver to the point of trying to kill him. The rest the movie finds Weaver struggling to keep his car on the highway and ahead of this maniac trucker. Fans of movies like ""Breakdown"" and ""Road Games"" should like it.

At times it may seem a little slow since that is the movie. We don't see that much scenery or other actors. I think this movie would have been even stronger if they had developed a couple other characters and added a couple key danger areas in the sets/scenery. This is still a fine movie after all these years. I bought the special edition and it is excellent quality with many extra features.

I remember seeing it as a very young child, during it's debut and I have had a soft spot for this film since then. It is Spielberg's first, official film and it has his mark all over it. It is interesting to watch and recognize the same brush strokes that would later make Jaws one of the greatest films ever. You can see Spielberg's developing style and camerawork. To have created such a wonderful, suspensful film, for the small screen, speaks volumes for the then budding talent of Spielberg. Plus the supplements are informative. The director himself has said the he will watch this film on occasion to remind himself how to make a film. From that standpoint, this disk is definitely worth a peek. Worth a purchase? Now that is another story. It is a TV movie afterall, allbeit one of the best. Honestly, I don't see myself needing it in my library to rewatch. So my 3 star rating here reflects my recommendaton for purchase and not my judgement on the the film solely. unless you are just a super-fan or a film historian, do what I did.

After seeing the movie, he was able to divert his driving direction from the hazardous 18-wheeler truck that was in the process of making a sharp left turn. With brutal force, admiration, determination and motivation, my cousin was able to steer right off the road into a mudded swamp like ditch in the hopes of escaping this brutal 18-wheeler who almost crushed him and his Taurus while he screamed ""KNAI!!!"" and flooded his car into this swamp.

216092,5,6300181987,"DUEL is one of those TV rarities, a well-made horror movie that actually works! You know the story. Businessman, Dave Mann (Dennis Weaver- WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH HELEN?, TERROR ON THE BEACH, DON'T GO TO SLEEP) ends up behind a big, rusty fuel truck on his way to a meeting. After passing the slow-moving vehicle, Mann gets caught up in a cat-and-mouse / life-and-death struggle for survival with the maniacal truck-driver. What I like most is the fact that the entire tale unfolds in the wide open countryside, in broad daylight. No dark, misty streets. Both predator and prey are seen in full sunlight, under bright blue skies. This makes DUEL all the more frightening and real. Writer Richard Matheson (Night Stalker / Night Strangler) spins another of his impressively scary yarns. Director Steven Spielberg isn't known for horror movies, but he has had some experience in the field (He directed 2 first season episodes of Night Gallery). The tension and suspense he creates in DUEL is relentless, unheard of in television (especially in the wacky 70's). Dennis Weaver is oddly perfect in his role as victim-turned-victor. Starting out calm, he slowly gets nervous, then spends a lot of time being terrified, finally getting fed up and determined to put an end to the insanity. And just who IS that mysterious truck-driver anyway?? The truck itself is a demonic presence, a juggernaut of death! The movie JEEPERS CREEPERS pays homage to DUEL (check out the kids' first encounter with the Creeper's truck). DUEL would make a great double feature w/ THE CAR.

The atmosphere is much like a Hitchcock feature and it will keep your attention to see who wins this dangerous match.

This is Steven Spielberg's first major feature, produced for TV broadcast, but remains one of his best products for developing a simple story into a spine-tingling thriller.

There are some great extras on this DVD edition...an interesting interview with Steven Spielberg, who tells a little bit about the making of the movie, a trailer, info about the cast, photos, etc. The picture quality is as great as ever too. Not too bad for Duel's DVD premiere. I have but one tiny complaint, however. The sound quality, as great as it is, is a bit different. I noticed at some parts...most noticiably the end, where the truck ""dies""...it seems to sound a bit differently from my VHS version. Call me picky, but it's just something small I noticed.

216140,4,6300181987,"Hard to believe this guy was in his 20's when he made this great thriller. ""Duel"" has the assured hand of a veteran film director and while Spielberg had been directing television programs (""The Name of the Game"", ""Night Gallery"" among many others), he had yet to make his big screen theatrical debut. ""Duel"" made it all possible.

Based on Richard Matheson's fine short story and original screenplay, ""Duel"" was part of ABC's amibitious efforts to produce original movies of the week. Others included the Ted post thriller ""Night Slaves""(1970) and ""Killdozer""(1974)(based on Ted Sturgeon's short story and, although not as memorable, it was a fine TV movie and influenced a certain Stephen King on his directorial debut as well for ""Maximum Overdrive""). Dennis Weaver stars as a David Mann (as generic a name and universal as possible with some interesting biblical references as well) returning home after a long period on the road. He passes the driver of a big rig truck. Roadrage takes effect and this mysterious driver (we never see his face)like Spielberg's shark in ""Jaws"" irrationally hunts the man in this game of cat and mouse trying to kill him.

Having seen the 90 minute version on laserdisc when it was released a couple of years ago, I can comment on the theatrical version vs. the original broadcast version of the movie. The scene in the diner was, indeed, in the original broadcast version but much of the other footage involving his phone call to his wife, etc. was not. While is does dissapate some of the suspense of the original, tighter wound version it also adds some nice character moments fleshing out Mann in ways that were only hinted at before. Matheson (a novelist well known in Science Fiction and Horror circles as the author of the classics I AM LEGEND, HELL HOUSE and for the big and little screen ""The Night Stalker"", ""The Incredible Shrinking Man"", ""Star Trek"" and ""The Twilight Zone"")creates a tense, simple but powerful story that Spielberg twists into a small screen masterpiece.

An under rated actor, Dennis Weaver (""Gunsmoke"" and ""McCloud"" among many other TV programs)gives a performance that turns from thoughtful to animalistic rage within the course of an hour and a half. The production values aren't high for the film (it's set in the middle of nowhere and really involves just a single actor for much of the movie)but the editing by Frank Morris and music by creepy music by Billy Goldenberg slather on additional tension to an already tightly wound movie.

This film pointed the way to ""Jaws"" and Spielberg's first theatrical film the road movie ""The Sugarland Express"" featuring Goldie Hawn. Although I haven't seen the DVD extras, the suspensful direction and nicely paced editing on the laserdisc edition are exactly the same as this edition. You'll be pulled in immediately from the first five minutes of the movie.",1091836800,3,2870,4.935817805383023
216141,5,6300181987,"In perusing others' reviews of this gem, i find it rather amusing that among the scenes cited most often as exemplary is the cafe scene, in which Weaver's character attempts to see if any of the other patrons might be the driver of the truck.

 What's amusing aboout this is that this is one of the scenes added to expand the original 77-minute version to 90-plus minutes to make it suitable for theatrical release (mainly in Europe) and for local US television (At 77 minutes, it was too long to fit a local tv 90-minute with commercials, and too short for a two-hour local tv slot... 92 minutes is just about perfect for the local tv two-hour slot.)

 Other added scenes include the phone conversation with his wife (also cited by one or more reviewers) and (i think; it's been a while since i saw the short version) the scene with Lou Frizzel as a schoolbus driver.

 While some of the added material (like the school bus scene) is fun, it does alter the overall pacing and form of the film from what was originally shown.

 As i've said before, maybe when we get the DVD it will have the chapter breaks so arranged that we can see either version if we so desire. (It would be nice if, like the DVD of the Bogart/Bacall ""The Big Sleep"", both versions were on the disc...)

 (Incidentally, just as this was the first of many films, ranging from excellent to execrable, for Spielberg, it was also the beginning of his reputation for never finishing a film within budget or on schedule -- he ran over on both.)",1091404800,2,1510,4.458181818181818
216142,5,6300181987,"""Come on you miserable fat-head! Get that fat-*ss truck outta my way!"" - David Mann gets his road-rage face on & starts ""Duel""
Before the term ""road-rage"" was coined there was Steven Spielberg's first film. ""Duel"" still holds its punch 33 years after its movie of the week debut.
David Mann is a simple business man, late for a convention thats taking him cross country to get there. It seems that he's making good time, that is, until, an old tanker truck gets in his path, and won't let Mann pass at any cost, except, with the cost of his own life. But, when Mann sees an opening and slips past the truck, an annoying situation escalates into a dangerous game of cat & mouse as the truck and its unknown driver hunts down, teases, & taunts Mann, & his crappy Dodge Dart, all over the Arizona highway.
The film is still great. Its like a feature length episode of ""The Twilight Zone"". Dennis Weaver is at his best as David Mann, who seems confindent, one of the guys that seems to have an infinite amount of patience, at the films beginning, but, at films end he's a nerve-shattered shell of his formerself & you wonder if he would ever drive a vehicle again, let alone sit in one!
Spielberg shows his first flair for suspense in ""Duel"" with the school bus sequence and the gas station attack (if you weren't at least on the edge of your seat when Mann was trying to help the kids & the school bus out while the truck ominously watched in the wings, you better check your pulse!).
""Duel"" is one of those films that makes you think twice about showing off your road-rage & flipping someone off after they cut you off on the highway. A must for the DVD collection. Not to be watched on long road trips.",1089504000,3,1701,4.369085173501578
216153,5,6300181987,"This movie has been reviewed many times on the basis of 'man vs. technology'. I believe a closer look at the nuances presented in the movie show an excellent metaphor of 'man (Mann?) vs. his fears'.
 We are allowed to over hear the phone in radio show on Mann's (Dennis Weaver) car radio. The show highlighting how the caller is no longer master of his own house and the fears he has on how to handle it. That is echoed when Mann stops for gas. The station attendant says 'you're the boss' while Mann replies with 'not in my house' Mann's phone conversation with his wife reinforces his character of trying to hide his fears and not deal with them.
  The truck is the symbol of his fears and his way of handling them, or rather avoiding them. He can't stop and let them pass by, they will always be there farhter down the road, as the truck is. He can't out run them as they will always be tailgating. Throughout all this we never identify the truck driver as that fact is unimportant.
 Mann is finally backed to a corner where he has to either die or face his fears. He does face them with interesting results.

Spielberg, in his first try, gave cinema the prototype of an everyday situation that becomes a nightmare.

216157,5,6300181987,"This is one of Steven Spielberg's first movie.  Here it is easy to see how he went from being a little known young director to a multi-zillion dollar movie mogul.  Spielberg, now known for making movies with huge spaceships, carefully detailed war zone replicas, and sophisticated special effects, shows us how to make a movie with a very simple small allotment of resources.  The main props are one car and one truck.
This movie will have you on the edge of your seat as a maniacal truck driver tries to kill a simple motorist who makes the mistake of annoying someone with a much bigger vehicle.  To make matters worse, the chase occurs in the California desert where there are almost no telephones, police stations, trees to hide behind, or anything else to go to for help.  Remember, this is in the days before cell phones.
""Duel"" was not meant to be a prediction of the future, a movie with a social message, or a warning about where our society was headed; just an entertaining roller-coaster ride for its watchers.  Nonetheless, this 1971 movie turned out to be a startlingly accurate prediction of the rise of road rage, a phenomenon that later started in Southern California and is now common nationwide.
This is the movie that passes the time quickly.",1079222400,3,1261,4.709090909090909
216158,5,6300181987,"Since the astronomical success of `Jaws' in 1975, Steven Spielberg has had numerous opportunities to show us what he can do with a monster budget. Here, in what began life as an improbably good TV movie, we get to see what the youthful Spielberg could do with a budget of, by his later standards, more or less nothing. The answer is quite a lot. Indeed this is, in very many ways, a far better thriller than, say, `Jurassic Park' or `Minority Report'.
It's a story of extreme simplicity. It begins with a middle-aged businessman, David Mann, about whom we know almost nothing except his name, that he is married and that he is heading for a business meeting and hopes to be back in time for dinner, sets off on a long road journey north from Los Angeles in a rather tired-looking red Plymouth that could do with a service. As he comes into the mountains he gets stuck behind a huge dirty great truck. He overtakes it but then it overtakes him back. So he overtakes it again and in doing so, it would seem, he annoys Mr Truck Driver. Annoys him quite a lot. To begin with Truck Driver won't let him overtake again, swerving about to block the road. Then Truck Driver maliciously waves him forward just as an oncoming car is approaching at speed. Then Truck Driver gives chase and sets out to run him off the road. From here on, this continuing game of cat and mouse makes up the entire film. There is never any explanation of why Truck Driver reacts in such an extreme way to so mild a provocation. Indeed we never ever see Truck Driver, only his darkened windscreen, his upper arms, and, at one point, his feet. (Not quite accurate that: we do, perhaps, see him in a group of people but neither we nor Mann knows which, if any, of them is he.) . His behaviour is so strange and his ability to double-guess Mann's movements so considerable that at times indeed it is a bit ambiguous whether we are watching a regular crime thriller or some sort of supernatural story. This extreme simplicity of plot and complete lack of any good explanation for Truck Driver's insane behaviour are both significant artistic risks to be taking but contribute highly effectively to creating a unique movie shot through with something of the terrifying intensity of a real nightmare.
Mann is the only character apart from the unseen truck driver and a few very tiny other roles and his role is ably carried by Dennis Weaver. This being low budget land, Weaver isn't the most famous actor in cinema history, but he nonetheless enjoys a certain iconic status among film lovers for having been the unforgettable `Night Man' in Welles' `Touch of Evil'. As that would lead one to expect, he is rather good at nervous, something much called for here.
The movie is very well thought out. Given the simplicity of the story, 90 minutes takes a bit of filling. Straight truck-chases-car would hardly fill it so it's necessary to raise and lower the intensity of the action and vary the forms taken by the truck driver's murderous aggression in ways that call for - and receive - a fair bit of ingenuity. And of course, it's beautifully directed.
I have only one quibble, just for the sake of finding fault. At times I was reminded of the fictitious screenwriters' manual employed by the Donald Kaufman in `Adaptation' with its central injunction to avoid voiceover at all cost. A hugely overstated injunction of course as voiceover can be a splendid thing in his place but here I think the manual has it dead right. Occasional voiceovers by Weaver, employed to let the audience listen in on his unspoken thoughts, seem something of a cop-out. The audience could and should be trusted to make sense of his actions well enough without them and I think the film would have been more powerful and dramatic had they simply been dispensed with. But that's about all I can think of to object to in this genuinely exciting and beautifully put together little movie.",1076976000,3,3927,4.611428571428571
216159,4,6300181987,"I started watching Duel at about midnight. It was about 10 minutes in, and a half hour later, it had me absolutely hooked. Tell someone what this film is about, and they'll laugh in your face, have they not seen it. But Speilberg's debut effort has really shown us what a talented director can do with any plot. The storyline is bleak, and it's clear that this film cost about the same as that car would. The acting is below-par, and it is a bit the same all the way through, but you forget any little nit-picks that you'd come up with any other film. The sheer suspense is unbearable for a large portion of this. I wouldn't classify this as horror, as it seems to have been widely, rather thriller/horror, because while it was scary for a while, it doesn't have the same 'bring you out in sweats' as pure horror films. The reason people find this so scary is the suspense. Speilberg has based his entire film around that aspect, and if you look at the camerawork, you really notice how he does it. The only part of the driver you see is his arm, as he sadistically waves Weaver past. Close ups of the truck, and prolonged shots of Weavers face as he is being chased, provide and endless amount of suspense and frustration, leaving you begging to see the drivers face, or feet, or anything!!
By the way, any of you seen 'Jeepers Creepers?' If you have, watch this, you'll go and give JC a 1 star review. If you haven't, just don't bother, watch this.",1076803200,,1450,4.374074074074074

This movie is simple but effective. Its a typical example where Spielberg shows us how you can make movies without all these wam-bam super computer effects of the modern film era.
The atmosphere showing the struggle between the salesman and his puny red car against the mad trucker with his collosial size and weight of death that pursues him really kept me on the edge of my seat. This film had such an eerie feeling about it from start to finish and was so well delivered.
This is a must see if you are a suspense junky and i close my review  with a little bit of advice: think twice before getting involved in a road rage battle with truckers**",1074816000,,781,4.461538461538462
216161,5,6300181987,"This movie makes one yearn for simpler times before virtuosity was replaced with special effects. The shoestring budget in this originally made-for-TV movie is its very strength, forcing the director to use his filmmaker's skill to compensate for its lack of pyrotechnics or star power. This is one of Spielberg's very first directorial efforts, and his mastery of his craft is cast into sharp relief through the stark simplicity of this film: just a guy, a car and a truck. The resulting film is one of the tautest in the suspense repertoire.
Much attention has been focused on this film over the years, mainly because its director would later go on to become one of the most successful filmmakers in history. It contains many of his trademark touches: the everyman thrown into conflict against his will, the dramatic suddenly rearing out of the commonplace, ordinary people confronting extraordinary evil or terror.
It isn't slick like his later films, but is made more compelling by its austerity. Stripped of artifice, it exists as a clean bracing example of film in its essence: a great story told by a great storyteller in as simple, forthright and direct a manner as possible.
An ordinary guy is driving to an appointment down a lonely stretch of highway when he gets stuck behind a semi-trailer that is obviously baiting him. He eventually makes a fateful decision, passes the truck, and in so doing earns the enmity of its unseen psychopathic driver. This leads to a cat and mouse chase down desert roads; fear, anger and paranoia; and the development of the main character from a comfortable dweeb into an unlikely hero.
It's all done with a minimum of camera platforms, stunts and explosions. Instead, Spielberg relies on pacing, editing, mood and internal dialogue. There is a scene at a diner, and later, one with a school bus, in which the hero's fear is transformed into paranoia. For the occupants of the diner and the bus, the hero's actions look like those of a lunatic. For we, who have shared his experiences, his are the frantic actions of a man desperate to escape impending doom. This is masterful technique forcing us to adopt the protagonist's viewpoint so completely that we feel like screaming at the various characters along the way to help the poor fool.
If the protagonist is weak, timid and a little stupid, these traits work to the film's advantage. He isn't some plastic action figure, but a man with whom we can identify. We've met his type before, may even share some of his qualities, and this makes his troubles so much more our own.
Not everyone will enjoy this film. Those weaned on a contemporary diet of wall-to-wall destruction and ballets of death will lack the refinement necessary to appreciate its simplicity. Likewise, those who confuse suspense with mayhem and character development with macho swagger won't get it. But if you are the kind of person who associates suspense with circumstance and intrigue, who can see past low-cost production constraints, and who values quality over quantity, you will find this film not only a pleasure, but a master-class in Filmmaking 101.",1069200000,12,3124,4.9073724007561434

As I recall seeing the movie in the 70s when I was in elementary school. I believe the movie was on one of those movies of the week on a major network at the time. But what caught my attention was the skillfull acting of Dennis Weaver, whose credits go back to to the early gunsmoke days, McCloud, detective series late 70s and today does small cameo appearances for a western channel. Dennis Weaver, comes across as a nervous business man who is trying to get from point a to point b, and is chased by a mad trucker, whom is never shown. Lot of the footage is done along the grapevine, which is a term used by southern californians,(a stretch of freeway between san fernando valley and bakersfield. One of my favorite scenes and scary when I was in elementary school first seeing Duel was when the old lady with the southern draw runs into Dennis Weaver. While Dennis is using the payphone,(no cell phones back then), the mad semi trys to plow over Dennis, misses him and gets the old ladys display of live snakes and tarantulas.

Undoubtedly, the driver was laying down in the cab of the truck at Chucks Restaurant. Chilling to imagine he parked there solely to make sure Mann couldn't have a relaxing meal. A murderer truly fixated and anxious to haunt every minute of Manns journey. I have discussed this movie over the decades and I contend that David Mann was mad (not angry, but insane) at the end. The way he jumped up and down and made that strange squealing sound looked like a man who would face PTSD for a long time and spend the rest of his life leery of ordinary situations.

216239,4,6300181987,"'The Duel' is a very successful suspense movie, that depicts the road rage theme. Basically, a business man plans to arrive in a certain location in a couple of hours. However, an oil truck has been following him. At first, the man (Dennis Weaver) does not really care about the truck driver's pointless moves on the road; he thinks that somebody just wants to have fun or something. But as drives further, the truck driver becomes more insane and crazier than ever, and pursues Weaver's death.
Weaver seems to be not used to driving fast; and he sweats as the truck follows him with 80 miles per hour. He gives a break at a cafe to think of what to do. These scenes are especially well established tension scenes. We see Weaver's helplessness, stress, and anger. Now, it's not about getting to his destination on time; it's about surviving, it's about staying alive. Yet, it will require a lot more sweat and stress.
I agree with another reviewer in that 'The Duel' has a Hitchcockian style to it, as far as how tension is created. The camerawork, the soundtrack, the choice of main and side characters are very well done, indeed, all responding to the suspense in some way. I highly recommend seeing this movie.",1054771200,,1213,4.6465116279069765

After seeing that, I made it my personal quest to find the film DUEL, but because of where I live, this was very difficult. In fact, it took me a good year and a half, at least. I found it while visiting family back home, and it was SOOOO worth the wait. The story centers on David Mann (Dennis Weaver, in a role he oughta get more credit for) a rather timid salesman on a drive through the
Mojave Desert for an appointment. He is so naive as to cut in front of a diesel truck. Next thing he knows, the crazy driver is in relentless pursuit of Mann. Taht's about all there is to this movie, but what's cool is that the driver of the truck, save for his hands at the steering wheel and his cowboy boots, is never, NOT ONCE seen in this movie, making it twice as scary as it already was. It's really quite easy to feel sorry for poor old David. The crazy trucker tries shoving him into an oncoming train for God's sake!!! As a Horror film, it's right up there with THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, CHILD'S PLAY, PSYCHO, SCREAM, and NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, which is not an easy rank to shoot for.

He passes the truck and everything is fine. The truck then decides to pass him again and slow down, again hindering his progress. What comes next is a film filled with chases and suspense. The coolest thing about the movie is that you never find out the identity of the driver of the truck. This leads you to believe that it's the truck, not the driver, who is causing all of this havoc.

A harrassed businessman, played by Dennis Weaver, takes a seemingly routine car journey to meet with a prospective client. Probably glad to have a break from his overbearing wife, witnessed in early scenes, Weaver's journey is thrown off-track (literally) by an unseen menace in a huge truck, who initially irritates, then frustrates, and ultimately scares, the defenceless Weaver. Why this vendetta occurs is never explained, but the movie does not suffer for this. Instead, the viewer is enthralled as Weaver's paranoia and desperation increase as his foe constantly reappears. Shot in real time, the movie, as befits the thunderous chases sequences, zips along, and seems to pass by in no time (usually the sign of a good film).

216276,5,6300181987,"Just as many people find themselves viewing the shower with trepidation after viewing Psycho, I've found myself wary to get on interstate highways after viewing Duel.  A 1971 tv-movie (that was, yes, the first film to be directed by Steven Spielberg), Duel is an effectively, simple little film that sticks with you long after the end credits have run.  Dennis Weaver plays a businessman travelling alone across a desolate strip of America.  For reasons that neither he nor the viewer can quite understand (and, for once, this makes the film's terror all the more effective), a truck driver targets Weaver and for the next hour and a half, we watch as Weaver struggles to survive against a faceless, seemingly more powerful opponent.  It's a simple premise but it is also a premise that taps into our deepest fears of the unknown.  Weaver's struggle is made all the more terrifying because it seems to just happen at random.  Weaver is targeted for no specific reason and, as unfair as that might seem to both him and the viewer, he now has no choice but to try to survive.
Duel works because of the talents of a young Steven Spielberg and the likeable everyman performance of Dennis Weaver.  Indeed, Weaver's contribution has often been overshadowed by the hype surrounding Spielberg's involvement and that's a shame because he gives a truly perfect performance, a worthy model for actors (especially those currently sleepwalking through today's crop of horror films) everywhere.  Weaver is one of those talented actors who, because he was never a showy performer and for the most part limited himself to television work, has never really gotten his due.  In Duel, he is totally believable as an ordinay man caught up in an extradorinary situation.  From the minute he first appears on screen, viewers can easily accept him as their surrogate and it is this indentifiability that makes what happens to him so enthralling and disturbing.  As for Spielberg, this film proves that, had he not gotten into his head to be a great filmmaker, Speilberg could have had a very lucrative and rewarding career as a modern day Roger Corman.  Using the techniques he would later hone to perfection in Jaws, Spielberg crafts an unpretentious, massively entertaining horror film that never loses sight of reality.  Working with essentially one actor and one set, Spielberg manages to capture the viewer from the first minute and keeps the narrative flying for the next 90 minutes, never allowing things to slack off and never giving viewers a reason to look away from the screen.  Especially compared with some of Spielberg's later, more ""respectable"" entertainments, Duel represents the ideal Spielberg -- all of his skill without the later need to prove he was capable of more than just being a ""mere"" entertainer.  Duel, despite being this young director's first film, is a perfect example of everything that Steven Spielberg does right and when compared with his later films, it becomes just as perfect an example of everything Spielberg's done wrong since then.
But don't watch the film because it was directed by Steven Spielberg or because Dennis Weaver was always underrated as an actor.  Watch it because it does everything you could possibly want a thriller to do.",1046822400,133,3260,4.976058931860037
216277,5,6300181987,"I never get tired of watching this movie. While so many stories center around a protagonist who has strong personal attributes that help create situations where the odds are easily stacked in his or her favor, Duel, on the other hand, portrays the good guy in the form of David Mann, a status quo, well-meaning, down-on-his-luck salesman who comes a lot closer to being like Charlie Brown than he does Arnold Schwarzenegger.
While he is traveling through desert areas in the U.S., heading home by taking alternate routes that are sparsely populated, Mann intermittently encounters a madman of a motorist who drives an old, flammable oil tanker. At first, it seems as if this person is just a hazardous, highway irritant that will soon turn off at some other road and that Mann will never see again.
The problem is, however, that this oil tanker from Hell keeps appearing and reappearing, creating even more highway havoc, causing Mann's Plymouth to nearly end up in: head-on collisions, rear-end collisions, railroad tracks soon to be occupied by a fast-moving train, and abandoned, deep, isolated, Grand Canyon type territory where Mann could possibly be pushed over the ledge and fall several feet below.
Throughout the movie, Weaver portrays the neurotic man in a small car quite well. In one scene, he is so frightened when he is being chased down that he bites his lower lip to the point of bleeding. Scenes of near nervous breakdowns are intermittent but become more frequent as the movie progresses.
No matter where he goes, that accursed oil tanker appears. On a parallel note, it reminds me of the Twilight Zone episode of the female motorist who, no matter how fast or how far she goes, there is always that same hitchhiker who keeps thumbing a ride.
Near the end, the Plymouth starts to show signs of wear and tear, and Mann, in this overheated vehicle that can no longer accelerate while having this deranged truck driver closing behind him, is screaming, ""Where's the summit?!!!... Come on!!! ... Come on!!!"" It is then that you are truly at the edge of your seat and can feel your muscles tighten up.
All in all, this is a gut-wrenching, David versus Goliath classic from Steven Spielberg. And I agree that it can do for the highway what Jaws did for the ocean.
As an added note, Steven Spielberg used in the conclusions of both Duel and Jaws the very same sound effects that were borrowed from old B dinosaur movies.",1045180800,2,2431,4.776722090261282
216278,5,6300181987,"This riveting suspense film helped to launch the career of a then unknown young filmmaker by the name of Steven Spielberg. Though made for TV, it became clear upon its release that both the film and Spielberg were too good for television. The film was released in Europe with some added scenes (well integrated) and got great reviews and business, while Spielberg graduated to feature films becoming the most financially successful filmmaker of all time.
Dennis Weaver stars as David Mann, a mild mannered business man on his way to a meeting. Driving along a lonely stretch of road in the California desert listening to the radio, Mann reflects upon an argument he had with his wife the night before. It seems that a guy at a party they were at made a drunken pass at Mann's wife, and she is angry that Mann did not come to her rescue.
""Well what was I supposed to do?"" Mann demands talking to his wife from a pay phone, ""challenge him to a fist fight?""
Little does the emasculated Mann know how prophetic those words are to be.
Mann's seemingly benign journey takes a frightening turn when he makes the mistake of passing a gigantic, beat-up looking diesel truck on the highway. The truck driver is so offended by this, that he makes it his unrelenting mission to eliminate Mann. Now Mann is in a desperate battle for survival against the Goliath-like truck who will stop at nothing to wipe him off the face of the earth.
Spielberg successfully captures the baren look of the desert while portraying Mann's increasingly frantic state of mind. As Mann is chased across the desert, he must contend with not only the psychotic truck driver, but also the unhelpful deadbeat locals who inhabit this God foresaken land. Ultimately Mann is left to his own devices. The truck driver (who is never seen), becomes the very personification of Mann's inner demons. Mann must take on the truck driver and in the process overcome his feelings of emasculation.
That's about if for plot, but don't despair. This is one of the most heartpounding suspense films ever made. It is also a foreshadowing of the spectacular career upon which Spielberg was to embark. Hold on to your seats!",1029024000,6,2168,4.722955145118734

From the way it starts, with Dennis Weavers car backing out of the garage, to the scenes where he is travelling on the highway serve perfectly as a premise to the chace that follows.
There are plenty of cars about, but something about the red Plymouth upsets the driver of the tanker, and it blows it's horn in protest of the overtake.
Thereafter, the juggernaut chases Dennis's car at high speed across barren country, the juggernaut seemingly having massive speed and grip, whilst the Plymouth strains and slips on it's skinny cross-plies. Poor Dennis does not know what he is up against until the chase is well underway.

See Dweeby Dennis get paranoid and accuse innocent truckers of hassling him (maybe someone poisoned his cheese sandwich and glass of water- why can't he order a big, bloody steak and a beer?), see Dweeby Dennis get humiliated when his  dweeby car isn't good enough to help shunt a broken down schoolbus- but the faceless psycho in the truck can do it.
Yes it is fun watching the little dishmop be mercilessly hunted down by the psycho. I'll stop hassling him to say that Spielberg's direction is superb, Matheson's script is brilliant and this is a definate must see, I've seen it at least half a dozen times and if you've never watched DUEL before do yourself a favor and buy a copy.",1022976000,8,1119,4.595

216324,5,6300181987,"Originally a T.V movie, Steven Spielberg's ""Duel"" was seen as too good to just be on television so some extra scenes were shot and in 1973 it was released in cinemas to excellent reviews and strong box-office returns. Starring Dennis Weaver (David Mann) and Eddie Firestone, Duel is the story of a menacing truck driver terrorising a hapless motorist on the road. Tautly directed and suspenseful, the film is one of Spielberg's most gripping movies.
The extra scenes shot for the film's theatrical release consist of a longer set-up, with Weaver driving along listening to the radio, an unnecessary scene where Weaver's character calls up his wife to talk, and one terrifying sequence where the truck driver tries to push Mann's car into a passing train. Spielberg's talent for unique camera shots and technical stunts can all be seen in the film, with some truly shocking moments. The creepy bell-like music adds to the suspense, and Weaver's character growth is surprisingly good, considering the film's short running time. And the inspired idea of never showing the truck driver almost creates a personality for the truck's menace. This is where Spielberg's talent for vivid and shocking storytelling was first shown, as he would go on to direct Jaws (1975) and Jurassic Park (1993). Duel is one of the greats.

216325,5,6300181987,"Noir fans may exalt Detour as the best cheapo road movie in film history, but the non-noirish Duel certainly has it beat in the suspense department. This is a tour-de-force of direction and editing that stretches a scanty plot into a breathless 90 minutes of edge-of-the-seat entertainment as Mann (man) duels tanker to the death. And where could the producers have located one of filmdom's scariest monsters?-- that rusting leviathan that could only have come from 18-wheeler hell. The movie itself confims what many of us only suspect: that heavy machinery operators should be psychologically tested before being loosed on the road. On another level, director Spielberg views the contest as a primeval one between man and beast, replete with feral death groans, dripping oil, and the fading heartbeat of a slowly rotating tire, all arrayed against the prehistoric backdrop of the California desert. Man wins because his more highly-evolved brain and agility will always best clumsy bulk and strength. This is a vehicular Jurassic Park played out on one of America's many deserted byways, (the trucker probably spent the night at the Bates Motel).Too bad Spielberg didn't stick to this exciting fare that is his real element, instead of settling for the dubious title of king of Hollywood middle-brow.",1020038400,,1302,5.204761904761905

It was not a complicated story by any means and sometimes that can be all the difference. I like that the driver of the truck is never seen. You don't need to know him/her. For those of us who remember it coming on tv and making sure you saw it, again and again, year after year, I recommend that you get this movie and add to your collection of DVD's.",1018656000,3,616,4.228813559322034
216327,5,6300181987,"I just finished watching Errol Flynn's THE DUEL for the first time--THE DUEL IS ERROL FLYNN'S BEST MOVIE!!!  I don't usually like watching black and white tapes, but THE DUEL is a hell of a look back for anyone at a time when movies were made for one reason--to entertain!
  THE DUEL has no endless list of credits, no wasted scenes or token characters, and no baloney as Errol Flynn plays a ruthless English lord who has murdered a man 10 years before and now wants to intimidate the man's daughter--who has been living in his home as his ward--into marrying him for one reason that he actually tells her:he has gambled away his fortune and wants her money!  But Flynn knows that she wants to marry a young English soldier and has a contingency plan that he tells her, too:he is a master with pistols and will trick the young man into a duel!
  Errol Flynn isn't as young and dashing in THE DUEL as he was in THE ADVENTURES OF ROBIN HOOD or CAPTAIN BLOOD, but even in his 50s he's still tall, rugged, and handsome enough to make a terrific villain, and there are plenty of subtle references to his well publicized private life that help to add to the momentum leading to the movie's exciting final scene.  And all this in only 30 minutes!!!

216328,5,6300181987,"Long before Close Encounters, Steven Spielberg helmed this dynamite suspense film in 1971, a powerful tale which seamlessly combines paranoia and road rage, based on an equally strong short story by Richard Matheson (same title).
Dennis Weaver plays the nameless suburbanite, a salesman road warrior who gets caught up in a horrific battle with another nameless guy, a trucker who drives a huge semi that repeatedly cuts Weaver off on the road and frustrates him just as repeatedly by moving so slowly the frantically impatient Weaver's edginess boils over into outright dementia.
The trucker is not only nameless, but invisible; Weaver never really sees him.  In a great and very disturbing scene in a typical truck stop diner, Weaver sees a lineup of similarly attired guys at the counter and tries to figure out which one is the demented trucker.
The pacing in this film is flawless, and Weaver's acting has never been better.  The ending is a perfect culmination of the momentum that is so effectively built during the course of the film.

With mere minutes of spoken dialog scattered throughout the entire movie, it's amazing how attached to the ""characters"" (by which I mean, Dennis Weaver and a big ol' truck) you become.
This movie is absolutely riveting - which is impressive considering the budget (or lack thereof) it's obviously shot on.  I learned later that it's by a first-time director, Steven Speilberg.  He was only 16 at the time, but after seeing this movie, it's incredibly evident that this man knows what he's doing.  He could really go far someday.

216342,5,6300181987,"Traveling businessman David Mann (Dennis Weaver) encounters an enormous, rusty, slow-moving tanker truck on a lonely stretch of desert highway, and passes it.  The never-seen truck driver, who is obviously ""a few gallons short of a full tank,"" responds by turning his truck into a terrifying murder weapon, trying to run Mann's tiny Plymouth Valiant off the road.  That's the entire plot of ""Duel.""  In the hands of a young director named Steven Spielberg, it's all the plot that's needed.
Spielberg got the green light to direct this made-for-TV movie because producer George Eckstein had seen and been impressed by Spielberg's directorial debut, the pilot episode of ""Columbo.""  Working on a shoestring budget, Spielberg delivered a tale of suspense that puts many a big-budget Hollywood action thriller to shame.  Equal credit has to go to Weaver, who superbly conveys David Mann's emotions to the viewer:  His initial frustration when the truck passes him and slows to a crawl, his satisfaction when he thinks he's gotten the upper hand, his terror when he realizes the truck driver's intentions have turned deadly, his isolated helplessness as every person he encounters thinks he's crazy and/or refuses to get involved and, ultimately, his determination to survive his ordeal.
There is a great moment in this movie which no one else has mentioned:  Mann, thinking his ordeal is over, is flagged down by a bus driver whose bus has broken down.  While assisting the driver, Mann suddenly notices the truck, waiting in the shadows under an overpass.  Then, the truck's headlights come on.  At this moment, the truck resembles a yellow-eyed demonic apparition straight out of David Mann's worst nightmare.
Far less impressive is this film's monaural sound, although it does have its moments.  This is a made-for-television feature film from 1971, so don't expect the aural impact of a modern-day surround-sound blockbuster.  Anyway, the chances are good that you'll be so caught up in the movie itself, the (relatively) poor sound quality won't matter.
But be warned:  When you're out on the road, and you look in your rear-view mirror and see a large truck closing in behind you, this movie WILL come back to you.",1010534400,11,2216,5.088397790055248

The car would be in the ditch and flipped. When people talk about REAL in films the filmmakers think we mean blood and goar...try common sense for a change!

216390,5,6300181987,"DUEL is the film that made Steven Spielberg a household word in Hollywood--and for good reason.  Though made in only three weeks on a budget of less than $500,000, this superlative made-for-TV movie helped to launch his career beyond the stars.
This is an extremely lean but effective psychological thriller with Dennis Weaver (of ""Gunsmoke"" fame) effectively portraying the first of Spielberg's favorite characters, the Everyman--in this case, an average auto motorist driving to a business appointment on a lonely California highway.  He tries to pass a road-hogging diesel truck; but when he does, the truck goes after him for the rest of the way.  Neither Weaver nor the viewer ever sees the truck driver, with the exception of a beefy hand and a pair of cowboy boots; but it's perfectly obvious that this man is a total psychopath.
Though suffering from some slight technical flaws, DUEL is brilliantly directed by Spielberg.  The film's screenplay is by the always-excellent sci-fi/horror writer Richard Matheson, who based it on a short story he had published in the April '71 edition of Playboy magazine.  Matheson, known for such novels as ""I Am Legend"" and scripts for ""The Twilight Zone"", is a master at this kind of mind-bending terror, and the combination of his and Spielberg's talents results in one of the most gut-wrenching and emotionally draining suspense films of all times.  One can see its influence on later films like the underrated 1997 thriller BREAKDOWN, and as a chilling precursor to today's violent, real-life incidents of road rage.

Duel, to which many disagree, is Steven Spielberg's greatest achievement.  It lacked a  budget, well-known cast, and a thetrical screening in the U.S., but has a  great deal more subconscious impact than any other of Spielberg's films.
The first ""act"" of Duel follows David Mann, a ridiculously  passive, conservative, and non-threatening businessman as he leaves on a  drive across the state.  Although Mann's persona seems overdone, we can  still identify with him in every sense, as he calmly flips through radio  stations and laughs at unfunny talk programs.
Like so many of us have  experiences, Mann finds himself caught behind a massive, greasy, rusted oil  tanker, who veers into his path each time he tries to pass.  After fretting  and cursing, Mann eventually pulls off the shoulder onto a dirt road, and  beats the trucker, laughing hysterically as the tanker bellows smoke and  picks up speed.  But much to Mann's dismay, the tanker mercilessly chases  him down the highway at nearly 100 miles per hour.
Thus begins a  terrifying, tense, and gas-guzzling saga of mortal game of cat-and-mouse,  winding down to an unforgettable climax at the peak of an uphill grade.  A  must-see for any serious film lover.  Don't be surprised if the image of a  giant, black-and-brown juggernaut of a truck plummeting down a highway  towards you sticks in your mind.",961113600,7,1497,4.967611336032388
216435,4,6300181987,"Duel is an especially effective film because it plays upon the fears of man, specifically the fear of losing control over a seemingly routine situation that, without warning, becomes life threatening.  What this movie  does is take a common, ordinary human being (he could be anyone of us) and  puts him in a horrific clash against an unknown assailant: a savage truck  driver whose person (as well as motive) is never revealed to him.
The  film opens to nothing more than the view from the hood of a car as it  progresses on a long business commute through a suburb, city, and finally a  rural, desert area.  There is a very special purpose for why there is no  dialogue, action, or character development in the first 15 minutes...it  sets the mood and condition: Dennis Weaver plays the driver, but we are  never allowed to know enough about him where we can separate his identity  from our own.  Thus, we become the driver, alone and quietly listening to  the radio, just trying to reach our destination.  And then the adversary  arrives, almost imperceptibly as just another vehicle on the road...a  large, rusted truck.  The truck's actions seem innocuous, even playful at  first.  But the scenes grow more unpredictable and terrifying with each  encounter.  Now we see ourselves as the driver, alone on an empty highway,  radio turned off, and just trying to stay alive.  Weaver's anger and  bewilderment matches our own as he struggles to regain control of a  situation that pits man against beast, David against Goliath.
Spielberg's  first effort, this film shows flashes of the brilliance that would come to  signify his finest works, including Jaws and Close Encounters.  Also  noteworthy are the convincing performances and a bone-chilling score.",960768000,18,1757,4.958620689655173

Dule , i think was made to be seriously but you all might  aswell face it its one of the best laughs you've had with a film, well  thats my opinion. I remember whre i watched Dule i ws in a mood and i  started watching it and it took me 10 mins to put me  in a good mood . But  i garantee any body thats got a sense of humour will be crying of laufter  at the end, and i don't know about any of you people who watched it but it  makes me want to go to the nearest cafe and ask for a cheese sandwich just  like david mann does in Dule. So COME OOOOOON Come on go and get Dule for  your video collection",959817600,3,762,3.5421686746987953
216437,5,6300181987,"Steven Spielberg's masterful TV-movie is still as riveting today as it was almost thirty years ago.  This gripping thriller holds the viewer from its opening credits all the way until the mind-blowing finale.
It is  especially contemporary in light of ""road rage,"" big SUV's, and  our passion for the highway.  Spielberg crafted a superb ""what  if"" story about a motorist terrorized by an unseen trucker.  The fact  that the truck driver's identity remains a secret just heightens the  tension. He becomes the ""Boogeyman"" of whom we, as children, were  always afraid.",958262400,,567,5.142857142857143
216438,5,6300181987,"This is a relatively unknown film, but I hope that more people are able to view this absolute classic film. The suspense is superb and spine chilling, and the relative lack of real dialogue is not missed due to simple yet  brilliant story line and plot. Spielberg really did outtdo himself on this  one. One of my all time favorite films, irrespective of genre.",956707200,2,361,4.625
216469,5,6300181987,"I remember watching this movie on television, when I was a kid.  Such an great movie, putting it simply.  Ummm, by the way... during the movie they did show the truck driver. Just for a glimpse. I had to watch it again to  realize the truck driver was in the restaurant.  Do you know what he was  doing in that restaurant scene? Give you a hint, not eating nor drinking  beer.",956275200,3,376,4.225352112676056
216470,5,6300181987,"One of Spielberg's great films.  Before Jaws even came out, he took the then unknown concept of ""Road Rage"" and portrayed it into an intense Thriller. Dennis Weaver portrayal of a mild-mannered business man,  on his way home from a trip and being terrorized by an unholy trucker, to  be over the top.  Weaver goes from anger to denial to fear and back to  anger again, as he deals with one PO'd truck driver with an axe to grind.  Since the truck driver is never shown in the film, the truck itself takes  on a meanacing form for Weaver and the audience.  One would never think  that something as road rage could be elevated into gripping on the edge of  your seat thriller.",956102400,,674,4.40650406504065

216472,4,6300181987,"Not only a great debut film by our country's current filmmaker laureate Steven Spielberg, but a subtle cultural harbinger of the madness people  can be driven to behind the wheel.  Screenwriter Richard Matheson's  (""I Am Legend,"" many classic ""Twilight Zone"" episodes)  output was so rich and varied during his lifetime, but ""Duel""  remains a career highlight.  One star from perfection due to the 'in'  early 1970s inner monologue and watered-down-for-television soundtrack (Who  is Billy Goldenberg and why couldn't Johnny Williams have met Spielberg  earlier to score this?), but ""Duel"" still taps into every  driver's subconscious--and stays there forever.  Anyone who feels like  they just can't deal with their traffic 'nightmare' anymore should watch  this.  I've seen the movie at least once a year for the last 20 years  (since I was five), and not only does it remain a personal favorite, but  its indelible memory has helped me keep my cool--and my driving record  clean.",947376000,,982,5.232258064516129
216473,5,6300181987,"Dennis Weaver's masterly portrayal of a pacifistic ninny pushed beyond his endurance is a classic! Mr Weaver blends reality and craft to bring just the right touch of nerdiness to his performance. Don't miss his class  ""Cheese sandwich"" scene in the diner. Mr Spielberg also shows us  what he can do with no budget. He coaxes the grandest performances from the  non-human actors: The menacing juggernaut of a truck and the touching  nice-guy Dodge Dart.",944352000,2,453,5.0

Everything about is great, the camera work, the pace, the actors, the sights and sounds, even the stupidity of the main character drives the story along (we don't know why he is going  where he is going but it must be important.  The only thing that could make  this movie better was if the voice over of the main characters thoughts  were omitted.  It is quite clear from his expressions and bady language  that we know what is goind through his head, probably the samething that  would be going through ours.

216476,5,6300181987,"When he was only 23 Steven Spielberg persuaded a studio to let him make ""Duel"", and the result is a classic.  The director always claimed that this is nothing more than a simple thriller - 'man in car chased by  maniacal truck', but most critics read far more into it than that.  Weaver  is superb as a first-world man coming to terms with his demons, the action  sequences are a real part of the story and the dialogue is mercifully  sparse.  What is ""Duel"" really about?  Form your own conclusions  as you marvel at this little gem of a movie.",941587200,3,545,4.37
