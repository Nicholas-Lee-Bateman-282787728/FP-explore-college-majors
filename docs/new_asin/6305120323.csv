7883428,4,6305120323,"Most fire videos are specifically for children, but this is not one of them.
This tape has fine video of fires and firefighters, but it is NOT for young children.  I certainly don't miss the goofy hosts found on several children's fire tapes; they are not present here.
The problem is that this video does include several rather graphic scenes showing injured, and possibly dead, fire victims, including children.
I would be glad to have my 4-year-old watch this video if I could edit out the injury scenes.",1015804800,4,507,4.761363636363637
