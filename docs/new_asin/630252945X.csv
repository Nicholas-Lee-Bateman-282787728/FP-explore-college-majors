7827781,3,630252945X,"Eh, I guess I was entertained.  Extremely random; occasionally funny.  ALTERNATE TITLE: The Lamp, which makes waaaay more sense than The Outing. What was this ""outing?""  The school trip to the museum?  Terrible title!

Some young criminals break into some old gypsy's house, axe-murder the venerable homeowner as she's trying to warn them away, and find a lamp dry-walled into the foundation.  Immediately weird crap starts to happen.  Not 10 minutes into the movie the axe-murdered gypsy axe-murders her axe-murderer with the murdering axe that is still embedded in her axe-murdered head.  Then his buddy is cut in half by some animated ectoplasm and their slutty tagalong is air-strangled by an invisible force after sprinting naked through the house.  [Best opening sequence in a bad horror EVER!  Also, most use of axe-murder in one paragraph EVER!]

I later realized that my ""gypsy"" was an Arab.  So the lamp and some of the Arab's other effects are moved to a museum and we learn the lamp is 5500 years old!  The lamp imprisons a Djinn (aka, Jinn or genie) and, during a high school field trip, some chick unleashes the Djinn and then plots with her friends to spend the night in the museum.  Why do that?  There is nothing cool or rebellious about spending a night in a museum.

Overnight some ridiculous stuff happens.  A chick takes a bath (in a museum!) and is attacked by a coil of cobras, we just ""find"" her boyfriend with his body cut in half, a guy's head is twisted around, random animated objects stab people on their own, a guy is bitten on the balls by a cobra, a Central American mummy goes zombie on someone...just totally random, unwarranted kills.

When we finally see the animatronic genie it looks like a mix between the demons from The Gate (1987) and a giant Gremlin.  An anthropologist tries to fight it with a fire extinguisher, which doesn't go well.  Luckily, a 1987 computer program provides the answer of how to kill a genie.  So they kill it.  However, on a major error on the writer's part, they discovered this ""how to kill a genie program"" while the genie was pretending to be the guy who found the program.  So, evidently, the genie revealed how its enemies should kill it while it was hiding among them. WTF!?!

I'd skip this one.  But if you insist, you'll probably find a few laughs and perhaps the opening scenes are worth it on their own.",1359849600,2,2380,4.663461538461538
7827782,5,630252945X,"""The Outing"" is one of those films that could be easily misunderstood unless the viewer realizes that the filmmakers are having fun and expecting the audience to join them in this very creepy but riotous spoof on Aladdin and every other magic lamp movie you have ever seen.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Outing-VHS/dp/B00004RP8C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Outing [VHS</a>]

Brilliantly written by veteran screenwriter Warren Chaney<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Workbook-for-the-Dynamic-Mind-Read-3-Times-faster-Remember-10-times-More/dp/0979339219/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Workbook for the Dynamic Mind (Read 3 Times faster- Remember 10 times More)</a>&nbsp;and adroitly directed by Tom Daley - ""The Outing"" sets you up for a ""Tall Tale"" of grand proportions. For some unexplained reason the film's American distributor removed the ""setup"" scene from the original. The missing scene takes place onboard a cargo ship in the early 1800s and shows the magic lamp and it's Genii entering the country as undocumented immigrants. Even without this scene, the ""setup"" becomes obvious in ""The Outings"" opening sequence where three over-the-top hicks are bent in invading an elderly mid-eastern woman's home. The stupidity of the invaders is comical but the eeriness of it all makes you afraid to laugh.  Such is the brilliance of the screenplay and the film.

The discovery of the magic lamp, hidden away in the alcoves of an elderly victims home is nothing short of brilliant. The stupidly disgusting over-the-top hicks discover the lamp and kill the woman.  They inadvertently uncork the lamp, accidently rubbing it and releasing evil genii. This initiates a sinister but constantly uproarious spree of destruction that continues for the remainder of the film.

The audience send-up is unending as a group of intentional dislikable teens decide they will secretly spend a night in the museum. Once there the exhibits come alive and mayhem reigns (sound familiar - a hit comedy was taken from this premise years later).

From setup to setup, the viewer doesn't know whether to laugh or be serious because the film's comedy is very clever and played straight.  One might think this mix was unintentional but that illusion is dispelled when the evil genii kills the museum guard by stuffing him with everyone's favorite movie snack, Jujyfruits. Because of the tall-tale properties, viewers find themselves cheering for the genii.

Jim Huston aptly portrays the father of the teenager responsible for releasing the Genii. However, it is veteran actor Deborah Winters, who expertly brings her experience to bear in this eerie romp through a strange museum.  She and Huston have good onscreen chemistry and it is easy to see that they, like the audience are having fun putting you on.

The appearance of the Genii is effective delayed to the end of the film and when it does appear - you realize that you have been had...again. Director Daley intentionally leaves the camera on the lamp dweller slightly longer than one would expect...but does it for the effect. It lumbers through the museum in a way that would make Boris Karloff proud.

The screenplay is shrewdly written and capably directed. The brilliant scripting and uncanny cinematography set the viewer up for an expected serious film. It then cunningly plays with the viewer in scene after scene - intentionally overplaying in some cleverly underplaying in others.

The American version of the film leaves the possibility open that some viewers might not get it. Thinking the film to be serious without the setup scene, they could potentially see this a camp, which it is not. This is a genuine imaginative yarn, not meant to be taken seriously. However, the early scenes are so well done and the film so well produced, this will not occur with most astute viewers. I must agree with other reviewers in the media who predict that ""The Outing"" will rise to become one of the all time great cult film favorites. In Europe, the original version already has.",1297382400,,4096,5.453396524486572
7827783,4,630252945X,"Despite the arrival of this VHS tape in dirty wrapping plastic,I enjoyed this movie.
The print quality was not too bad either. Good work.",1286496000,,137,4.75
7827784,3,630252945X,"I recently saw this movie for the first time and if you like really cheesy B movies, this is definitely one for you. An enjoyably cheesy B-movie that has bad acting all around (everyone seems to agree on that), but also some imaginatively gruesome scenes that make it worthwhile for undemanding genre fans. Inarguable highlight is the scene involving a naked girl (of course!), a bathtub and several snakes.....ugh! See if you can understand the point of the brief shot after the closing credits.

It's got it all...bad acting, horrible effects, random naked people. I found it particularly enjoyable because it's set in Houston, TX.  So I got to look back and remember what this city looked like 15 years ago.  All in all, this movie is a good way to spend a couple hours.",1240272000,3,773,4.711111111111111
7827785,5,630252945X,"Be forewarned- If you ever Wished for a great scare THIS Movie is for YOU! Just be careful what you wish for? This is what the young teens in the closed-for-the-night town museum wish for: to live through the night, after they make light of rubbing an old ancient relic lamp found in the museum they have taken a field trip to tour. They wind up releasing a force they have no idea of how to defeat. For the force, is a vengeful, evil, Djinn Spirit--who doesn't care for granting wishes, since all the djinn Wishes for is to Kill to obtain the life forces of the young people who foolishly awoke and released him from his cramped prison. This is the VERY FIRST Movie to watch BEFORE Wes Craven's Wishmaster & Wishmaster2..since compared to the Djinn/Nathaniel Demerest, THIS Killer Djinn will make you wish you had began the movie--With all the lights ON !! A definite Must-Have if you enjoy learning the TRUE nature of the Ancient Persian Spirits/Gods. Definite Scare your pants off material.",1098489600,16,993,4.6477272727272725
