Manaos (1979), or Slaves from Prison Camp Manaos

This film from the late 1970's isn't as bad as it would seem, although it could have been better if they worked on the character development and the plot instead of concentrating on the sequences as nothing but battle related themes. The story is about a rubber plantation in South America which is worked by foreigners, indians, and prisoners. They all have to contend with an evil plantation owner played with zeal by the great Dominican-born Mexican actor Andres Garcia (a popular Latin actor who is concentrating on soap operas now). He could have been a Latin Paul Newman but films like this did not establish his dramaturgical expression and credibility. His arch nemesis in the film is played with silent self assuredness by Jorge Rivero (another leading man in Latin film).

The plot deals with some of the intelligent workers leading a rebellion against the vicious owner and there are battles with armed guards and dangerous jungle crossings along the way. This was made in the 70's so you have to bear with the corny music that doesn't really fit the period, which could have been 1898, or so; it's hard to tell because of the random infusion of clothes, guns, and unhistorical elements in the film.

Manaos wants to be a cheap version of 'Papillion' but mainly it is for action buffs or jungle exploitation film lovers.

Altogether you won't be bored by it, but neither will you be entirely impressed.

7903658,4,B0000064IF,"This is one of two films directed by Alberto V&aacute;squez Figueroa (the other being the very entertaining ""Oro Rojo"" or ""Red Gold""); he's the writer behind ""Ashanti, Land of No Mercy,"" Monte Hellman's ""Iguana"" and ""Tuareg: The Desert Warrior."" He's probably a better writer than a director, but there's still much to recommend this film.

The aforementioned ant-feeding scene, which opens the film, establishes from the get-go its exploitation bona fides. Within 10 minutes we are treated (if that's the right word, and it probably isn't) to a lengthy scene of Agostina Belli being gang-raped (although I would note that they clearly used a body double for the nudity), while macho leads Fabio Testi and Jorge Rivero listen in helplessly.

In an odd pick for counter-intuitive casting, the lead bad guy is played by none other than Andres Garcia, who here gets a chance to demonstrate his range as an actor. It's too bad that this guy didn't cross over more into international markets. Like Testi and Rivero, he's got real screen presence.

Supporting roles are filled in by the likes of Florinda Bolkan (underutilized, yet still making the inevitable impression, such is her talent), Jorge Luke (as an Indio), Milton Rodriguez, Carlos East and others.

As the previous reviewer notes, the film's score is hopelessly out of synch with the setting and tone, a poppy disco confection that summons images of bellbottoms and afros, not 19th century jungle rebellion.

By the way, as mentioned in the opening and closing credits song, the original release title for this film was ""Manaos"" (1979).",1344729600,,1593,5.064885496183206
