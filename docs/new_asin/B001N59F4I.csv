8472707,5,B001N59F4I,I believe this is an opera that is very much under appreciated. This production is beautiful and classically done. The signing by the entire cast is excellent.,1390089600,,159,4.925925925925926
8472708,4,B001N59F4I,"We loved this DVD and it is part of our library.  A couple of months ago we saw the filmed version released by Emerging Pictures from the Royal Opera House Covent Garden with Jonas Kaufmann and Angela Gheorghiu.  We have heard it is being released this month, January 2012 and we want to buy it.  It was gangbusters!",1326067200,,316,4.413793103448276
8472709,5,B001N59F4I,"Excellent performance.  Daniela Dessi is phenominal in the role of
Adriana Lecouvreur.  Sergei Larin as her lover is also excellent.
A must-see for every opera lover...Cilea should be reconsidered in the same breath as Mascagni and Leoncavallo...0utstanding compos-er...the devise of poisoned flowers is sort of far fetched, but in the performance entirely believable.  Enjoy this performance with your significant other...and LaScala is the ideal setting...the ballet in the third act is phenominal...I enjoyed it immensely...",1290988800,4,527,6.0
8472710,4,B001N59F4I,"Adriana Lecouvreur by Francesco Cilea, is definitely ""verismo"" at its best.  Any time I embark in the adventure of listening or watching this opera I feel its vibrant strength and passion.  Do not expect well-defined arias as the ones you would find in more classic operas.  However the melodic thread  is  always there with passages of great beauty and a nostalgic mood that pervades the whole opera from beginning to end.  Such is the case of ""La dolcissima sfige..."" (followed by a fantastic duet with the soprano) and ""L'anima stanca"" both sang by the tenor at the first and second acts respectively.  Most of Adriana parts are also memorable, including the aria of the flowers in the last act and the stunning Fedra's monologue at the end of the third act.  A second love duet wit Maurizio in the last act is also glorious.  Symphonic intermezzi are outstanding (e.g. the one before Adriana's encounter with the princess Bouillon in the second act, the ""French"" ballet in the third act and the overtures of the first and fourth acts).  The role of Adriana Lecouvreur is not easy to sing and even great divas have failed in it.  I have had the fortune of listening Magda Olivero (one of  Cilea's favorite) in the title role, in Caracas, in the early seventies.  However I also had the misfortune of listening the ""great"" Joan Sutherland, in the same role, in Toronto in the mid eighties.  This version from La Scala is quite irregular.  None of the lead singers, with the exception of Olga Borodina (aka princess Bouillon), really impress me as singers.  Their acting and scenic presence are good though and, somehow seem to surpass their musical talents.  The settings and costumes are beautiful and elegant and work quite well in the background of a careful stage direction.",1120780800,11,1780,4.802631578947368
8472711,4,B001N59F4I,"It is often said that Italian Versimo operas are no longer viable, that there are no singers who have the skills to bring them to life.

This fine DVD shows that these operas ARE viable today.

La Scala gives this a fine, rich, but tasteful production.

Daniella Dessi voice is not particularly lush, in fact it can be a bit wiry, but I thought she did a fine job in the title role. She's an affecting performer with a fine sense of style, understands how to accent the words and has that quality known as ""morbidezza"", so important to Italian Verismo. She is able to bring Adriana to life without making her a silly victim.

Olga Borodina is a beautiful woman with a full-bodied, warm mezzo. She sings the jealous Princess with great power and conviction.

Both these women are vying for the affection of Maurizio, here played by Larin. He's a good , sturdy tenor with a good technique. However his voice refuses to stay in my memory, as a result I always find him a bit faceless. This makes a bit of a hole in the opera, which really needs charismatic, distinctive performers. So he's the reason for clipping off one star.

The staging is traditional but effective and the orchestra plays well.

All in all this DVD was a pleasant surprise for me and I was glad that I purchased it.",1106956800,,1284,4.461538461538462
8472712,5,B001N59F4I,"Given mixed reviews elsewhere of both this opera and its production, I was quite peasantly surprised by the effectiveness of both.  The opera itself is quite melodious and it may be noted that in the past some of Cilea's areas for the baritone and for the tenor have been recorded with a fair amount of frequency.  Dessi's portrayal of Adriana is more girlish/hysteric than that I have heard from exerpts by others but in context of a complete performance her view seemed valid. Sergei Larin sings well and while he doen't look like a fellow two women would be fighting over - well that's not too unlike reality.  In general, I would say, all roles were well acted and well sung with Olga Borodina's princess receiving universal and well deserved praise.

And what sets and what costumes! The production is lavish - a feast for the eyes.  I can not immagine a better way to enjoy this opera than live or on DVD.",1095638400,14,911,4.564417177914111
8472713,4,B001N59F4I,"The La Scala production is gorgeous and effectively captured on this DVD.  The singing is always good and sometimes very sensitive and gripping; the conducting is superb, vigorous and also nuanced and delicate.  The video filming is especially effective in giving enough cut away shots so that you can really appreciate the beauty of the sets (shades of Fragonard, etc. very appropriate--although why the mosque at Cordoba shows up in one backgound painting is hard to say).  All the singers except for Carlo Guelfi, who is very assured throughout, seem to be warming up during their first appearances but overall their committment and acting is effective and moving.  The subtitles are amazingly literal so that at times they are very silly, but at least it teaches you just how basic opera librettos often are. Color gorgeous, sound excellent. Highly recommended for any fan of this beautiful and tuneful opera.",1084838400,8,913,5.10738255033557
8472714,2,B001N59F4I,"Many years ago, I owned a recording of Adriana Lecouvreur and I think I enjoyed it enough to purchase this new DVD of it.  Boy, was I wrong or awfully forgetful.  This truly has to be the dullest opera that I have ever witnessed or have ever heard.  It truly is a ""one tune"" score with no exciting arias, ensembles or choruses.
The signers come-off as interesting as dish-water--not even Olga Borodina seemed to be too inspired.  Dessi has always bored me to tears and in this opera, I almost broke down in hysterical sobs. Larin appears and sounds like he just wondered in off the streets.
The production, I guess was nice being what the producer had to work with.
Buy this DVD only if you absolutely ADORE Verismo operas.",1081814400,5,723,4.4961832061068705
