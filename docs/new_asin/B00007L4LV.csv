1819163,4,B00007L4LV,"This is a sensational, tabloid type story that the producers/director thankfully didn't turn into heavy handed schlock.

Here's the scoop. Taken from a true story, this Ontario set film revolves around a Manson-ish cult leader who is very charismatic and keeps a harem of women and their offspring to do his bidding. A local social worker thinks things might not be so rosy and mounts a campaign to get the children and women out of there. It's not as easy as she'd hoped.

This is a decent, low budget, independent type flick. There are very few sets and no frou-frou. The focus is on the characters and the script and both are good enough to see this through. Polly Walker, as the social worker, was herself an abused wife, so she has a keen eye for this situation, along with a personal desire to see that no harm comes to these ""church"" members. Luc Picard as the leader of said church also does a fine job. Though not handsome, he still has an arresting presence. He can be charming when needed but, underneath, he's a snake who just wants to have his cake and eat it too. He dishes out punishment and death with little remorse of conscience. You want Polly to succeed and get all these folk safe and make certain Picard pays for his cruelty.

The director, Mario Azzopardi, has a ton of credits, mostly TV, under his belt. To his credit he made this story believable. What could have been a heavy handed effort is told with a quiet authority that allows the story to speak for itself.

This is probably more three and half stars than the four I gave it but it's more than a worthwhile watch.",1332720000,,1597,4.458904109589041
1819164,4,B00007L4LV,"This movie was very good. It depicted the savage nature of 'Moses'. Those poor women and children were as controlled by this man as the Manson family was. They were afraid to leave and stayed with the abuse. Finally some of them won't take it anymore, with the help of a social worker and the police.",1237161600,3,300,4.375
1819165,3,B00007L4LV,as a woman this was hard for me to watch the women and children being abused. but it was an ok film.,1235347200,,100,3.590909090909091
1819166,5,B00007L4LV,"The sociopath Roc Tremain (Luc Picard) is the Canadian version of Charles Manson.  He ruthlessly manipulated those within his community of true believers.  They refused to abandon Tremain even after witnessing his torturing and murdering one of their fellow members.  Their own children were readily sacrificed to this mad man's lust and violent behavior.  Disgustingly, Tremain had little sexual interest in the older children.  He apparently preferred his female victims to be no older than five or six years old!  Government officials did next to nothing until a brave social worker (Polly Walker) relentlessly forced the issue.

I thoroughly enjoyed Savage Messiah.  The acting is superb along with the dialogue.  Why am I among the very few who thinks so?  I cannot begin to understand why this gem of a film is so ignored.  It is truly a four and a half to five star film.  Please make a point of seeing it.  I'm sure you will agree with me.

1819167,4,B00007L4LV,"Savage Messaih is the true story of Roc Tremain who had a commune up in Canada where he lived with his 9 wives.  On the outside it would seem like they are a happy and peaceful folk, if not a little kinky at times.  However whn dweliing upon the inner mysteries of the commune it was revealed that Roc was truelly a monster who physically, psychologically, and sexually abused his 9 wives and 17 children.
This stroy story tells how he was found out about what he did.  ALthough the movie cannot even begin to explain what all he really did (and still hold the R rating as well as being viewable in most nations) it does show mostly how he manipulated his wives especially when they all claimed to love him.
The reason this story is so sad and disturbing is the fact that it actually happened, and to many degrees still happens not just in Canada, or BRitian, or any other nation, but also here in the United States. This harsh tale of Physical, Mental, and Sexual abuse may test to some degree of what you thought you knew about Society, and of people as well.",1047513600,15,1061,4.348484848484849

7977855,5,B00007L4LV,"I am giving this movie five stars, not because I ""loved"" it as the rating says, but because the movie did a good job of telling the true story without being too graphic.
I enjoy true stories, and all of this movie was true, and, amazingly, so many more horrible facts were left out.

I had never heard of this man. After seeing the movie, I looked him up on Wikipedia and Google and Murderpedia and I was shocked at how many graphic details the movie left out. This man's unbelievably torturous crimes, according to Wikipedia and Murderpedia, were so much worse than shown in the movie. You all can look it up for yourselves, and be prepared to be more shocked than you were when you watched the movie.

I think that the movie should have gone into more detail of why these people chose to be in this cult, more ""backstory"" of the wives, and the movie should have told about what happened to all of those children afterward. The movie should have mentioned his death and about how he died, even if it was just printed at the end, and again, you all can read about it all on Murderpedia and Wikipedia and other websites. I am shocked that he got ""only one"" life sentence, because I have heard of other people getting several consecutive life sentences for much less, and I am shocked that he was eligible for parole after only ten years, which he was actually denied, and he actually was murdered in jail.

I am most of all shocked that all of this movie is true and that much more of the facts that were left out of the movie are true.

SPOILER....The movie left out so many details regarding the woman getting her arm chopped off, most of all, that after her arm was cut off, she actually went back to Rock again. The movie left out facts about the murder of his wife and about so many other tortures that are just so shocking and horrible that it is unbelievable that it is all true and that these people still chose to stay with him.",1417651200,,1936,4.325068870523416
