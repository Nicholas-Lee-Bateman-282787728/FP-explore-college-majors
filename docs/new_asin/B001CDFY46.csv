3509123,3,B001CDFY46,"Somewhere the highly regarded Taiwanese director Hou Hsiao-Hsien had the idea of paying homage to the 1956 classic Albert Lamorisse film THE RED BALLOON, a tender story of a child's interaction with a nearly animate floating balloon, and while there is indeed an short introduction of a small boy  addressing an errant red balloon floating in Paris, the 'homage' stops there. What follows is an overly long, frustratingly impromptu series of scenes that lack cohesion and resolution.

THE FLIGHT OF THE RED BALLOON (Le Voyage du balloon rouge) is a prolonged (113 minutes) series of scenes that stutter along  with the same sort of wandering course of the occasionally visible red balloon to present moments in the life of a disheveled, frumpy, single mother  Suzanne (Juliette Binoche) whose income depends on her fascination and obsession with Chinese marionette presentations for which she supplies the backstage voice for all of the characters. Her absent 'husband/boyfriend' has left her to write in Montreal while Suzanne must care for her young son Simon (Simon Iteanu) with the help of a newly hired Taiwanese photographer nanny Song (Fang Song) while her daughter resides in Brussels.  This disheveled household is further complicated by the freeloading Marc (Hippolyte Girardot), the  friend of her absentee 'husband',  by Simon's piano lessons taught by Anna (Anna Sigalevitch), and by impossible conflicting schedules for marionette performances, partially relieved by Song's quiet ability to take Simon on adventures outside the confines of the cluttered little space they all call home. The only quieting element of this film is the occasional appearance of the 'guardian angel' red balloon, which seems to be a symbol for defining the real world of Simon and the illusory world he craves.  The dialogue as written by Hou and Franois Margolin is choppy and the camera work and constant meandering piano music  seem extemporaneous: there are few resolutions to the individual stories that are only hinted.  Juliette Binoche is a solid actress able to make the most of a minimal script and horrendous costuming and makeup: her moments of being the voice of marionettes are magical.  But this Red Balloon just doesn't take flight in the context of this homage.  As with the rest of the film the balloon just floats off at the end. The viewer needs a lot of patience with this film!

3509124,1,B001CDFY46,"About 10 minutes into this film I realized that I had no idea what the characters looked like.  Then I realized that every shot was either a long shot, or we saw the sides of their heads and mostly their hair, or we saw the characters through a glass or reflected in a glass.  There was one close up of Juliette Binoche but that was all the director gave us.  I left the film feeling as if I never was able to get close to the characters I was watching.  Which was too bad because their performances were wonderful.
Whenever the balloon came into the picture it was also at a distance.  There seemed to be no connection between each of the characters or of the balloon.  This film has serious intimacy issues.  Right afterwards I saw the film ""Bella"" and was struck by how powerful a close up shot could be.",1217980800,4,807,4.269736842105263

I agree that the wandering red balloon appeared somewhat randomly and made no connection to the characters at times. I found this mildly, persistently frustrating when it happened, but I also kind of liked it. After all, things in real life often don't seem to connect or intersect. The performances are all amazing, it's generally in real time; the lighting is magical, with leaf-light patterns transporting me back to childhood every so often. The piano music throughout is lovely, playful, and transporting. This is an unusual, beautiful film. I think it's best to watch when you are alert and relaxed, and willing to participate a bit in making the story meaningful. A unique and wonderful thing about this film is that you feel as if you are participating, at different points.",1216684800,10,1025,4.829545454545454
3509126,3,B001CDFY46,"OK. Two stories. One is the tale of a lonely young Parisian boy's relationship with an errant red balloon (or of the balloon's relationship with the boy). The other is the day-to-day struggle of a working mother trying to care for the boy amidst the tumult of her own life.

A great movie would have intertwined the two stories, with one commenting on or contradicting the other. But this was not such a great movie. Instead, we had a very interesting drama of a mother (played by Juliette Binoche) turning to a Chinese nanny (Fang Song) for relief from the crushing burden of childcare duties. Song and Binoche's son, Simon, find themselves immersed in the ordinary chores of daily life -- cutting new keys, buying groceries, showing up for piano lessons, etc. Along the way, we learn of the tense relationship with the downstairs neighbors and with Binoche's absentee ex, who has escaped to Montreal.

Oh yeah, the balloon. Once in awhile, a red balloon floats by unconvincingly. Except for the first ten minutes oft he film, it has nothing to do with Simon. It shows up at random times that have little to do with the narrative. Simon takes a nap, and it bounces against the window. Might have been interesting if Simon woke up and smiled at the return of his friend, but that doesn't happen.

Director Hsiao-hsien Hou obviously made the film as a homage to the 1956 ""The Red Balloon."" But the substance of the homage is lost on me. Unfortunately, the Binoche story also ran out of gas and ended with no resolution. It's ambiguous whether this was to lend verisimilitude to her story (real life is not neatly packaged into episodes) or lack of narrative skill. But the characters hardly develop, and neither does their relationship to each other.

Anyway, if you love French films, fabulous acting, and a peek into the private lives of others -- and if cinematic plotting and coherent storytelling mean nothing to you -- The Flight of the Red Balloon will be just your thing.",1215993600,7,1978,4.708092485549133

3509140,5,B001CDFY46,"***INTRODUCTION***

Hou Hsiao-hsien may be the most fearless, sophisticated, and brilliant filmmaker of the last 30 years. He's fearless because after establishing his presence with a string of late 80s/early 90s masterpieces he consciously diverted from the stylistic formalism that he had cultivated and has been changing and experimenting with each new release ever since. His sophistication lies in his complete mastery of each new style: his poetic, haiku-like images and editing, his superficial minimalism that reveals incredibly rich aesthetic and thematic depths, his ability to synthesize some of the finest quality from the best Asian directors (notably Ozu and Mizoguchi). Finally, he's brilliant because he has been able to invite comparison to these masters and hold up well (sometimes even better) under scrutiny.

His daring, sophistication, and brilliance has been especially proven in two of his 21st century films, Caf&eacute; Lumiere and Flight of the Red Balloon. Both found Hou in foreign countries (in the former Japan, and in the latter France) making films dedicated to a master (Ozu in Lumiere) and an enduring masterpiece (Lamorisse's Red Balloon). Both films display the tremendous versatility of Hou, and his ability to take something familiar, like Ozu's deceptively simple formalism or the touching premise of Lamorisse's fable of childhood and innocence, and elaborate on them with his own vision, and enrich them with his artistry.

In the original Red Balloon, a young boy named Pascal discovers a sentient red balloon that takes to following him about his everyday life. Everyone takes notice of this phenomenon, such as the local boys who take to tragically destroying the balloon in front of Pascal. But the film ends with a transcendental uplift as a cadre of balloons appear to lift up Pascal and take him away to who-knows-where. The film has always been taken as being a whimsical, poignant fable of childhood and innocence, perhaps both lost and redeemed.

***SYNOPSIS***

Hou's re-envisioning of the original Red Balloon loosely keeps its basic premise, but sets it in a more naturalistic, ephemeral, and elusive key. Suzanne (Juliette Binoche) is a single mother who works as a puppeteer voice at a local theater. She is also sub-letting her apartment to a couple who appear to be friends of her ex-husband. Because of her busy schedule she hires a babysitter named Fang Song (Fang Song: Yes, the actress' name is the same) to watch her young son Simon (Simon Iteanu) during the day. Song is a Chinese films student who happens to be shooting a remake of The Red Balloon, and decides to use Simon as the boy in the film.

For the first time since his breakthrough masterpiece A City of Sadness, Hou has turned his camera squarely upon a family. While his films post-City have featured families the focus has usually been on individuals within them. But unlike the sprawling focus of City, Flight keeps up with Hou's post-Puppetmaster chamber drama trend which reduces his cast to an intimate few. Flight's focus is extremely balanced, giving equal time and attention to Suzanne, Simon, Song and the interconnected relationships between them.

***REVIEW***

This intimate setting allows his cast to shine, and shine they do. I've often thought Juliette Binoche was the most under-rated actress of her generation, and here she gives an extraordinary performance as Suzanne. A completely ""normal"" character if ever there was, Suzanne is utterly relatable; she's a woman who finds herself always rushed, always under pressure from multiple sides, from dealing with her tenants to taking care of her son to keeping in touch with her daughter who's away to supporting her family without the help of a husband. Like most of us, the everyday struggles wear away it her, and what we see is a woman breaking down but striving endlessly to hold it all together. In true Hou fashion, Binoche communicates this through minimal gestures, so we're never actively aware of her breakdown as we're watching it.

Song and Simon are a different story entirely. With his youth and innocence, Simon exists in a world all his own, one of games (pinball, video), music (his piano lessons) and school. Simon Iteanu is utterly believable in the role and thanks to Hou's good sense of taste he never comes off as a fake or precocious child star. Fang Song (the character) strikes a balance between Simon's carefree innocence and Suzanne's reality frazzled self. She's able to sympathize with Suzanne and yet still relate with Simon. As an actress, Song plays the character almost like a blank slate and observer, which is utterly appropriate when one considers Song is an obvious analog to Hou himself.

Enough also can't be said about the stunning cinematography of Mark Lee Ping-Bing, who is right there with Roger Deakins as the best of the modern cinematographers. Mark Lee seems to share more in common with one of the old masters, Vittorio Storaro, in his mastery of color and light. All of Hou's modern films have used light, color, and compositions in interesting ways and Mark Lee has showed his ability to shift from the deep, neon-blues of Millennium Mambo, to the organic naturalism of Cafe Lumiere, to the Barry Lyndon-esque lantern-lit interiors of Flowers of Shanghai. One should also applaud the graceful movements which achieves an almost Mizoguchi-like elegance despite usually being hand-held.

***ANALYSIS***

Flight is Hou's most reflexive film, literally. Shots of reflective glass abound in the film, sometimes shooting through to the other side, sometimes merely shooting the reflections. In one of the film's most extraordinarily beautiful shots, Hou captures the sunset through the windows of the train as trees pass in front of it, essentially reflecting two sunsets that periodically pierce through the throng. This is one of the many scenes accompanied by the haunting, lyrical solo piano piece which lends the film much of its elegiac, poetic aesthetic quality.

It's also Hou's most self-reflexive and metafictional film. The fact that Suzanne is a puppeteer voice harkens back to The Puppetmaster. The fact that Song is shooting a remake of The Red Balloon self-consciously alludes to Hou's own remake in progress. Just like Hou takes us behind the scenes of the puppet show, likewise does he take us behind the making of Flight when Song reveals to Suzanne that she uses a man dressed in green to hold the balloon so he can be erased digitally. More subtly, Hou's profusive gold and red color scheme reminds one of Flowers of Shanghai, while the intimate, cramped spaces of the apartment in contrast to the large, outdoor spaces remind one of Millennium Mambo or Caf&eacute; Lumiere.

Flight is one of Hou's most particularly brilliant uses of color. Besides the magnificent use of natural light (usually golden-tinged indoors shot with angles, diffused sunlight), red and green both act as a symbolic motif. Green and red are unique choices as they are contrasting colors in which the former recedes and the later advances (in photographic color theory). Obviously, the red echoes that of the balloon, and a symbol of childhood innocence and fantasy it crops up tellingly throughout, such as the door that leads to Suzanne's puppet show and frequently in the apartment. The green seems to symbolize the congestion and frustration of adulthood and modern culture. The first time we see the balloon it becomes caught in a tree and then obscured by the leaves and branches. Later, when the balloon tries to join Simon on a train (which is also painted green) it's knocked aside by the train's arrival into the station. It stands at the door as Simon seems to be swallowed by the masses inside, almost as if the balloon is trying to save him from the inevitable fate of growing up.

Elsewhere, Hou seems to edit playfully around this. In one scene, Simon and Song stand outside a caf&eacute; and a traffic light is visible nearby on green. On red, the two enter inside where Simon begins to play pinball, and when the light changes again, Hou quickly edits to inside the building. These rhythmic nuances are prolific in the film and accentuate its free-flowing, baloon-like floating, jazzy rhythms. In one of the lighter instances, Simon is playing with Song's digital camcorder inside the apartment, filming her making pancakes, and when he says ""there's nothing else to film"" Hou quickly cuts.

Elsewhere, Hou's ellipses are more thematically and emotionally relevant, such as when a scene with Simon telling Song about his sister whom he never sees. Hou cuts to a long shot of Simon standing on a bridge with a woman we can't see, and as Simon's voiceover continues, they walk towards camera, revealing the girl to be, presumably, his sister. This memory will appear again later with Simon, his sister, and Suzanne inside their old house as a loving, happy family.

Joining Hou's artistic mastery of time and color is his mastery of composition, space, and sound. The film begins, like many Hou's, of sound occurring over a credit screen. Here, what we hear first is the traffic of a French city street as Simon stands upon a lamp near a subway, attempting to coax the red balloon (that isn't shown) to come down. Hou continues his visual suggestion of the suffocating modernism of the city by shooting through crowds of people that fill the frame. This congestion is echoed by the messiness of Suzanne's apartment. Flight essentially joins Hou's filmography from Goodbye South onward as being an expression of his distaste for unnatural modernity.

But all of Hou's artistry comes together in the film's overarching theme of the innocence, freedom, openness, and imagination of childhood versus the soul-crushing drudgery of adulthood. Suzanne and Simon are contrasts in every possible way, but Hou's magic is his ability to find to moderation between the two, that moderation is art and, in particular, film. Song is literally the link between Suzanne and Simon in the film's fictional world, just like Hou is in his behind-the-scenes direction and orchestration.

All three are engaged in some artistic endeavor and at different levels: Simon is learning piano, but is only able to perform scales. Song is recently out of film-school and is making student films on her cheap, digital camera. Suzanne is a professional, making a living performing voices for puppets. In one telling scene, Suzanne reveals to Song how her film (appropriately titled ""origins"") brought her back to her youth and all its vivid memories, things she reveals that ""I thought I had forgot about"".

The same way that art can mediate age, it can also mediate culture. In another scene, Song acts a translator for Suzanne and an elderly Asian puppet master where Suzanne gives him a post-card she received in China. This is almost like an in-film communication between Hou's Asia and Suzanne's France, where the former is filming and depicting the latter, and the latter is attempting to find a common ground.

But if art can mediate ages it can't synthesize them into one. It seems the only time Suzanne is happy is when she is performing her art. Everywhere else, the troubles of reality invade her life. In one of the film's most poignant scenes, Suzanne breaks down crying after a hostile encounter with her neighbor whom she's trying to evict, and after a call with her daughter who might not be coming to stay. She rushes towards Simon, hugging him and talking to him about how he's doing. Here we can literally feel her attempting to grasp and recapture some spirit of childhood that's long gone.

Appropriately, Hou saves his finest magic trick for the end where Simon and a group of schoolchildren visit a museum to see Felix Vallotton's original Red Balloon painting. Suddenly, the film's mostifs seem to synthesize immediately (even if subtly and imperceptivity): the child in the light foreground chasing the balloon, the adults in the shadowed background, the green of trees allowing the red of the balloon to pop out by contras. We finally see that Hou has all along been replicating this painting in the form of the moving images; dramatizing it, and adding poetic visual and rhythmic layers elaborating on the theme.

***CONCLUSION***

Hou is one of those directors from whom every film seems like an invaluable gift from your best friend, and in an oeuvre full of brilliant masterpieces, Flight of the Red Balloon is one of his most impressive. It's a remarkable achievement for a director who came to prominence more than 20 years ago. It's a film that's both utterly like and yet quite unlike anything else Hou is done. It has the same cinematic sophistication, the same minimalism, the same aesthetic sublimity, and the same stylistic complexity, but it feels like it's in an entirely different mode. Flight is one of Hou's most ephemeral, rich, poetic, elegiac, magical, and even uplifting films. It's one of those films to get lost in: lost in its impressionistic sensuousness, like staring at a Monet painting or reading a Yeats poem, lost in its wistfulness that, like the kids say of the painting, is a both a bit happy and a bit sad. It's one of those films that leaves me with a deep sense of peace, and an even greater sense of wonder. It's a magic trick by one of cinema's most talented magicians and, what's all the more remarkable, is that even after I figure out the trick my sense of wonder seems to enrichen and deepen rather than dissipate. It's just such a shame that so few in the west seem to appreciate that poetic magic.",1275868800,8,13585,4.990282685512367
3509141,4,B001CDFY46,"Yesterday evening this film came on the television, late.
Somehow it brought the feeling of ""day"" into my evening spaces and lightened fatigue, caught me with the French, and I watched.
I  loved ""The Red Balloon"" and used to show it to students in 1st grade, my daughter in kinder saw it- and always stated it terrified her. So there was enough just in that to make me interested in an homage.
For the most part you follow a beautiful child, into his day,he's very independent, learning of his new child care taker, seeing his small apartment, the life of his mother. She voices puppets. His Maman is so beautiful, sensual, high strung a bit, struggling. His father it appears eventually has left her and she has someone living in the apartment down stairs from something he allowed-not paying- that she's got to deal with and apparently evict. And that's causing her to struggle.  She's in her own world-has her share of pain, the child has his, the care taker serves as an observer. It's a kind of movie moving like the balloon did in the other -through their existence. You know what I always recall of the Red Balloon? The teasing playfulness, how it would come in and take you, float you, so I think the child in this movie, the characters, tend to come in and rather float you. It moves through music, it made me wistful this score. There wasn't the humor though, and I noticed that.

I doubt I'm capable of revealing this movie. There are very long shots of the characters just living, mostly in an apartment but escaping at times to the street, the actress Binoche reminded me of a friend Norma and her relationship as I knew it with her two children. Almost entirely I felt an observer of their life-as this is-noticing as I did here-being engaged. There was such similarity it felt like spending time in their lives once more. The apartment space was cluttered, the life was revealed, the love- mother to child was there, she felt a bit alone, her son seemed to pull her into reality. Her puppet work was so odd to me. I couldn't watch that easily-really high pitched, dramatic, histrionic almost stuff. Like Punch and Judy, older, an art outside my understanding. The child Simon was brilliant, in all his interactions he was just charming, real. He came for me from the movie this saluted.

What happens. Life. A little bit. This new care taker for Simon is entering their life, as you are, it serves to bridge that. As she looks, rather free of judgment, saying at one point she is new here- so too we are looking. Discovering the love of child and mom, the things that feel painful, the sister lives away, you gain brief insights into the felt loss of her presence, sadness over the father-noting not the best behavior in the mom all the time-but nothing so awful either.

So yes, it does have a red balloon, I cannot conclude entirely what I make of the meanings.
I'm not sure the movie would work for some I know, some even that I know love the Red Balloon, for children even.

But I enjoyed the movie and it held me to its floating away.",1256428800,4,3054,4.513562386980109

Hou Hsaio Hsien's ""The Flight of the Red Balloon"" is a tribute of sorts to 1956's ""The Red Balloon,"" probably the most well known and widely seen short film of all time.  That movie told the simple but lyrical tale of a young boy who is followed around the streets of Paris by a helium-filled balloon that seems to have a life and mind of its own.  But if you go into this new film expecting anything close to a remake of the first one, you will be supremely disappointed.

""The Flight of the Red Balloon"" is also set in Paris and it DOES feature a balloon and a boy - but that's about as far as the comparisons go between the two movies.  What ""The Flight of the Red Balloon"" fails to capture is that special spirit of wonder, magic and imagination that has so enchanted ""Red Balloon"" aficionados for generations.  Instead, we're stuck with a mind-numbingly tedious story involving a single mother (Juliette Binoche), her somewhat soporific son (Simon Iteanu), and a Chinese filmmaker (Fang Song) who serves as the boy's nanny and who wants to make a movie of her own modeled after ""The Red Balloon.""  For long stretches of time, the title character doesn't even appear in the film, and you may find yourself wanting to holler ""Bring on the balloon!"" everytime these self-absorbed characters launch into yet another of their eternal gabfests.  In fact, when the balloon does make one of its infrequent appearances, all it does is hover around the edges of the scene to no discernible point or purpose.

Too bad these nonstop blatherers didn't yield more of their screen time to the balloon.",1232841600,11,1597,4.634751773049645
3509145,3,B001CDFY46,"Nothing really big happens in Hsiao-hsien Hou's ""Flight of the Red Balloon."" Juliette Binoche is Suzanne, puppeteer and emotionally fragile mother of a seven-year-old boy Simon, both living in a small Paris apartment room. A red balloon floats in the Parisian sky as if watching over the little boy, a reference to Albert Lamorisse's 1956 classic film ""The Red Balloon"" (though the new film could hardly be called a remake).

Respected Taiwanese director Hou Hsiao Hsien captures the slightly nostalgic atmosphere of the Paris streets very beautifully, but for all (or perhaps because of) Binoche's fine improvised acting the film feels overlong and needs editing. The camera lingers on Binoche and other characters including the lonely boy and Song, a Chinese nanny (she is also a film student studying ""The Red Balloon""), but few things really interest us. I know some films, especially so-called art-house films, require patience on our side, and they end usually, if not always, with satisfactory results, but somehow I couldn't find them here except the beautiful street scenes and nice soundtrack music.

Perhaps this is because the film's reference to ""The Red Balloon"" is too contrived and the red balloon of this film, it seems, appears and disappears at random. Some of the cast are to be blamed too. Fang Song as nanny is not a professional actress, but, like the character she plays, a (former) film student in real life. However, she is an amateur as far as acting goes and it shows, so does the boy playing Simon, and the lack of emotion in the characters they play are obvious.

That makes us ask ourselves: Why is she there after all? Or why is Suzanne a puppeteer? What is the point of introducing the annoying (so she thinks) tenant below? And most of all, why the red balloon?

The Boys From Fengkuei (1983), A Summer at Grandpa's (1984), A Time to Live, A Time to Die (1985), A City of Sadness (1989), The Puppetmaster (1993) and Good Men, Good Women (1995) all won major prizes at international film festivals and it is criminal that we are denied a chance to see them. As it is we have only Cafe Lumiere (2003), Three Times (2005) and the film under review here, Flight of the Red Balloon (2007) or Le Voyage du Ballon Rouge to give it its proper French title. Of the three only Three Times really captures the recognized essence of this original director. Its refraction of Taiwanese history through personal lives is thoroughly typical throwing back as it does to acclaimed masterpieces of the past, especially Flowers of Shanghai (1998) and (I gather from reviews) A City of Sadness. Cafe Lumiere is a very impressive homage to Ozu Yasujiro which truly captures the spirit and style of the Japanese master, and which also accurately catches the transience of today's Japan. However, made outside Taiwan and eschewing all concerns with history the film amounts to a new departure for Hou, one which is continued in Flight of the Red Balloon.

Made on the back of the success of Three Times, Flight of the Red Balloon sees Hou go to Paris to make a 110 minute riff on the famous Albert Lamorisse 1956 short film, The Red Balloon. The film opens with a boy (Simon Iteanu) reaching into the sky to tempt down a red balloon that sails tantalizingly above him. The boy disappears down the Metro and Pin Bing Lee's camera follows the balloon around Paris capturing buildings, streets, trains, buses, and finally resting on Chinese film student Song (Song Fang) who is en-route to meeting her new employer Suzanne (puppeteer voice actress Juliette Binoche) in a theater where she is rehearsing her Chinese puppet play. It turns out Song is to be nanny to Suzanne's son and the film charts their relationship as they walk around Paris sometimes accompanied by the balloon, sometimes not. What 'plot' there is in the film derives from depicting Suzanne's crazy single mother world where she has to take care of a son while working full time and dealing with neighbor Marc (Hippolyte Girardot), a friend of Suzanne's estranged (and completely absent) husband. Marc is leeching off her, staying in her apartment without paying rent or any of the upkeep. We see the effect this chaotic situation has on her son (who disappears into a lonely computer game/pinball world), her daughter Louise (Louise Margolin) who refuses to return from her grandfather to live with her mother as she knows the home situation too well, and of course the mother herself who tries her best but is all at sea without any kind of male emotional support.

Hou doesn't really tell a story here. The narrative is open-ended. We wander in and out of characters' lives as if we were the balloon ourselves and those who want a traditional story with beginning, middle and end had better go see another film. However, watch closely and we discover that ironically, though the film may not have a 'story' itself, its central narrative nevertheless concerns story-telling with each character yearning to construct their own 'sub-narrative' if you like. First of all there is the mother who makes a living by telling stories through puppets. Then there is the son who lives his own fantasy world where he imagines living with his absent sister or living through the artificial devices of the TV game or the pinball machine. The film student Song has her own artificial device of course and it's called a camera. She is an obvious alter-ego for the director Hou and spends the film shooting pictures of the boy, deliberately citing The Red Balloon as an influence on her making another film about the subject, and even putting old video tape of Louise's childhood onto disc for her mother.

Flight of the Red Balloon then is about narrative construction rather than a narrative in itself. This is something that intrigues as the film develops with Hou and Pin Bing Lee constructing a very careful mise-en-scene which makes great use of the tracking shot. Rarely has Paris looked so luminous as the camera swerves up and down, left and right depicting the city as if from the characters' idealizing perspectives rather than from the point of view of Hou himself. Especially warm is the sequence in the park with the trees and fountains looking incredibly fresh as imagined through the boy's fantasy. Then there is the great use of reflective surfaces - shop windows, windscreens, windows in buildings, in trains. Everywhere Hou finds images which reflect and frame adding up to a depiction of movie-making itself. In one scene we see Song watching Simon through a window play pinball, the street reflected clearly in the pane. Then we move inside to see the same subject and suddenly it looks so different. It's all a matter of perspective and it seems to me that this is at the heart of what Hou is getting at here. The same things are not the same for everyone. We all have our own perspectives, our own emotional needs, our own ideas - all of which we project on everything that surrounds us. We all have our own narrative to tell - hence the confusion (the richness?) of the world in which we live. Hou embraces this confusion so that the simplicities (or in Suzanne's case, the complexities) of everyday life take prominence over any artificially contrived melodrama.

In Flight of the Red Balloon Hou disavows his own role as master creator and accepts that the world is certainly not a neat tidy narrative with a beginning, middle and end as conventional film would have us believe. On the contrary, the world is a confused, confusing rich mess which no master planner with any one theory can completely explain away. This embracing of confusion as a definition of life takes the film into post-modern territory. The associated paranoia is present in the repressed behavior of the son and in the angst of the mother, but Hou doesn't burrow deeply down into that. Instead he keeps a distance and everything is imbued with light and warmth. He demonstrates his usual astuteness with the use of music (a seductive piano score) and is helped enormously by warm semi-improvised performances, especially from Juliette Binoche. In Suzanne's final scene the camera stares at her for a full 3 minutes as everything rages (off screen) around her. Here Binoche manages to depict all the sadness, the loneliness, the rage, the frustration, the warmth, the love, the stamina and the resolve which any single mother in her position must feel. She's a great actress and Hou truly makes full use of her here.

As other reviews posted here reflect, this film has divided critics and general audiences down the middle. My advice is to give it two or three viewings and let Hou's quiet, contemplative meditation on single motherhood and post-modern narrative construction work its spell gradually over you. I must confess on first view to finding Suzanne's neuroses irritating and Hou's general point muddy, but having seen the film two more times I am now much happier with it. Mind you, I still don't like the air of a promotional feature advertising as it does the Musee d'Orsay who part-financed the film. The film conveniently finishes up there with a critical dissection of Felix Vallotton's painting The Balloon which states Hou's central theme of 'perspective' very clearly.

This Network DVD is very good, the images (aspect ratio 16:9) and sound top notch. The English subtitles are very clear (the eponymous Hou enthusiast Tony Rayns adding French to the Japanese and Mandarin already in his armory of languages), but there are no extras. I notice this film is also available coupled with the Lamorisse short which inspired it and that seems a better recommendation than this single disc bare bones release. Hou is one of the greatest directors working right now and he deserves to be better known. Let's hope his earlier 'masterpieces' (hailed by many as constituting his very best work) will be released soon.",1411430400,,8424,4.862813370473537
