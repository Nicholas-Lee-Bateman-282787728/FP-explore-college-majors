6351883,5,B00JB4TOTY,Great tie off to a great show. When Season ended with Magnum dying the fans rose up and demanded another season and a more optimistic conclusion. Season 8 of Magnum delivered and the series finale was a great conclusion to the show that also opened the possibility for a reunion movie. This was the way a great show like Magnum should have been concluded.,1501977600,,355,4.5625

6351893,5,B00JB4TOTY,"This is one of my favorite TV shows of all time! Tom Selleck plays the role of a former Navy man turned Private Investigator, thus the P.I. title for his current profession. People love this sries for it's excellent combination of action, drama, and some comedy mixed in. The ""friendship"" between Higgins and Magnum is hilarious at times! Don't let that fool you, though. The main theme of this series is crime action. Thomas Magnum takes on multiple cases that lead to deat defying trouble every time! This show made the red Ferrari(328?) a household word! Audi sedan fans also get an occasional treat now and then. The scenery/locations are in Hawaii and are stunningly beautiful! This series won multiple Golden Globes and Emmys and deservedly so. There is also an episode of the Rockford Files, another famous crime drama, when Selleck got his big debut. I would rate this PG for minor language, violence, and action. There is nothing racy or obscene. This is like Miami Vice in that it will never die! Enjoy!",1459209600,3,1013,4.7942857142857145

8649534,2,B00JB4TOTY,"Worse series season by far. Silly scripts, characters acting out of character, laughable villains. Worst are the terrible scripts. Not one memorable episode for season 8. It's easy to see why this was the last season before the series was cancelled. They should have pulled the plug after season 7.",1530748800,,298,4.98

8649542,3,B00JB4TOTY,I bought every season of magnum pi and what disappoints me most is that I have found some of the same episodes in different seasons and feel as though I have been cheated by being shorted episodes because they were not all unique.,1516752000,,230,4.372093023255814
