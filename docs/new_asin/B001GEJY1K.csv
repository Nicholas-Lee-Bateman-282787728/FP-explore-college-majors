3610890,3,B001GEJY1K,"The basic film is pretty good.  The problem is that the DVD is made from a multiple generation copy with the usual low resolution, distorted gray scale, and snow making it almost unwatchable.",1233964800,3,191,4.787878787878788

8305165,1,B001GEJY1K,Awful reproduction and acting. But hearing Mr. Lundie's voice again (Barry Jones) from 1954's Brigadoon was great.,1510099200,,114,5.764705882352941

8305168,1,B001GEJY1K,An absolute joke.  Horrible. The woman playing Vera is way too old.,1489968000,,67,4.583333333333333
8305169,4,B001GEJY1K,"This version was made for TV years ago and therefore is a shortened presentation. The deaths come quickly and even the poem is different, but the production is clever, well-acted, and a good script. I think Agatha Christie would be pleased with it considering the time constraints of a live TV broadcast. Highly recommended for Christie lovers.",1463961600,4,344,5.052631578947368
8305170,4,B001GEJY1K,"very interesting seeing a tv show I saw the year I graduated from high school.  for an Agatha Christie mystery in 1959 I thought it was great.  not so much after more than 50 years.  this has been done and redone.  the best is 'and then there were none' with Judith Anderson, barry fitzgerald, walter Huston, and a slew of great character actors. watch them all for fun.",1457913600,3,370,4.397058823529412
8305171,4,B001GEJY1K,"I have yet to find the perfect movie of this story, but this is a very nice try.  It is a television version and I assume it was filmed live, or shown live since this is obviously a kinescope.  It includes the live commercials for Rexall drug stores.  It is very well done for being so condensed and I'm glad I got to see it.  It is however very washed out, as most kinescopes are, but very watchable.  There are a couple of mistakes so that is why I think it was live.  The Judge forgets a line and struggles to get back on track and Nina Foch screams before the thunder and lightning strikes in one scene.  But all in all it is a very entertaining little version of this wonderful story.",1352505600,7,689,4.135338345864661
8305172,2,B001GEJY1K,"I was expecting a better quality film than this, especially paying 20 dollars for it. Even the packaging has the feel of being ripped off. The quality is grainy and I feel like I am actually watching on an old black and white T.V. The one good thing I can say is I still enjoy this version of this movie.  If you know going into buying this movie that you are buying a version that seems to have been recorded off the T.V. and then sold as a high quality film, then you will enjoy the movie.",1254960000,2,491,4.061855670103093
8305173,4,B001GEJY1K,"I have seen this movie multiple times.  But I still enjoy it.  The acting is over the top in places.  But still entertaining.  It follows closely the storyline of ""And Then There Were None"".  The difference being that this group is stranded on top of a snowy mountain instead of on an island.  Fabian is an interesting addition to the cast.  If you like Agatha Christie you will probably enjoy this movie.",1246752000,4,405,4.541666666666667
