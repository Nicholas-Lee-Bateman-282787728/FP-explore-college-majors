7881256,3,6305018995,"Well made movie.  Very realistic and true to the times which makes this movie very difficult to watch - never mind 'enjoy'.  (Since I knew I would not be watching it again I gave it away to someone with a penchant for The Old West.)  Just so sad and depressingly real.  Again, not saying it was not well acted  (it was!!!)  not saying it looked cheaply made  (it wasn't!)  but the hard life of those 'Soiled Doves' at that time .. was hard to watch.
The production and direction and acting was VERY well done I must say!!!",1385424000,,522,4.255102040816326
7881257,4,6305018995,"This is NOT the fast-paced, shoot 'em up westerns of Hollywood.  This movie is for people who love history, and good stories, and don't have attention deficit disorder.  Each frame is a ""painting"" that you want to look at for awhile.  It's gritty and real.",1321228800,,256,4.644444444444445
7881258,5,6305018995,"This film is hard to sum up because there is really not a plot, per se. The film follows the lives of prostitutes living in a brothel owned by Brenda Fricker. This is not the brothel of TV westerns, this is a dark, dank place barely lit by candle light in a dingy little ten building frontier town. McGillis plays Nettie, who helps the other prostitutes through their time at Fricker's establishment, as well as the competition down the street. It is implied she performs abortions for unexpected pregnancies. She tries to raise her five year old son in the house, with less than successful results. Eileen is Irish, and befriends German dancer Katya, who replaces Eileen's best friend, who we see murdered in the opening scene. Georgie is the new young prostitute who knows she can do better that this one horse town, and sets out to prove it. Ada is the prostitute with children who is getting older and less desirable to the men.
The entire cast does a fantastic job. Sanders' direction (he also cowrote this) is very intimate wihout being exploitative, except for McGillis' topless scene. The film is sad, without being a complete downer, but you get the idea that this is what the prostitutes went through. The pace seems deliberately slow so we get to know the characters. The pace is a little too slow at times, and a few supporting actors blur in confusion here and there, but Sanders keeps things going.
Despite the stupid title, and cleavage baring video box, this is not something along the lines of ""Bad Girls"" or ""Hard Bounty."" This tells a very realistic story of tough lives gone wrong. If anything, it is hard to forget.
This is rated (R) for some physical violence, gun violence, some gore, female nudity, strong sexual content, and strong sexual references.",1022371200,17,1775,4.7290322580645165
