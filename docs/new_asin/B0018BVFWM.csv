8269314,5,B0018BVFWM,"I substituted the Stott Toning Ball with a playground ball and a mini toning ball from another DVD.  This workout was fantastic and truly effective in feeling energized at the end.  This is a 40 minute workout based on classic Pilates moves.  It will work your core and back area and your posture, plus you'll feel your body/muscles lengthen and strengthen.  Instructor Moira, whose soothing and peaceful voice,  will lead her model through the moves in a pace where you are continuously moving with excellent transitions.  It flows smoothly in which you will be mainly on a mat in supine, prone, side, and sitting positions.  Excellent camera angles, especially when shot from above looking down at the model. It is very helpful when Moira points out where and which muscles you should be focusing on and counts out loud to tempo.  These effective and classic moves require you to engage your core at all times (hundred, roll-ups, leg circles, shoulder bridge, et al.)while incorporating the use of the ball (soft, flexible kind)that make the moves easier as well as increased challenges.  Recommended level: intermediate-basic advanced.  I actually prefer this DVD over the 10 Minute Solution Pilates with toning ball DVD.",1275696000,4,1224,5.075
