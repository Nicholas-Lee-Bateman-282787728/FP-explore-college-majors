7749581,1,B01FBKVXPO,Currently each season is $18 making the whole set worth less than $200. Charging double is a rip off,1491350400,3,100,4.315789473684211
7749582,3,B01FBKVXPO,"I bought this for my husband as a Christmas present. When it arrived it was not packaged very securely and had been obviously tossed around quite a bit. When we opened each one, all the cases except for one were broken to smithereens. Luckily none of the actual BluRay discs were scratched but we ended up having to buy new cases as they all just fell apart in your hands. So, still had an excited husband for the set, just please package better especially for the price I had paid.",1484006400,7,482,4.366666666666666

7749607,5,B01FBKVXPO,"Couldnt be happier with this product, shipping was very fast and all the discs work and are there (apparently was a problem with previous reviews). The picture and sound quality is incredible. You can watch English dub with original music, English dub with Bruce Falconer soundtrack or Japanese sub. Can also confirm that this works on Xbox one. This is full screen so if you want original aspect ratio you will want to buy the orange bricks. Great buy for $120!",1523059200,,462,4.716049382716049
7749608,5,B01FBKVXPO,"Came sealed, looking perfect. I'm so happy to own this Amazon Exclusive boxset.",1523059200,,79,5.153846153846154
7749609,5,B01FBKVXPO,"Looks better than ever, and I never felt like the cropping took away from the experience. Being able to switch between the Japanese tracks and the Faulconer music is a really awesome feature. The only thing that would be better is if you could also switch the the tracks from the ocean sub, since that's how I remember the first parts of the show.

Marathon mode has spoiled me. I watched Dragon Ball on funimation and skipping through the recaps and credits is pretty annoying. The marathon mode skips through the recaps and the opening/ending credits making it feel more like watching one giant movie.

The product is packaged well and looks really great on a display shelf. Definitely love this product, and at $125 it's a steal!",1522972800,,732,4.7109375
7749610,5,B01FBKVXPO,Awesome dvd collection set for dbz fans.,1522972800,,40,4.857142857142857
7749611,4,B01FBKVXPO,Everyone who is a true dbz fan should get this if you haven't got the whole collection i will be watching pretty soon and i gave it 4 stars for 2 reasons there was some tear on one of the slips on season one and season 4 had the tray broken but thats about it but im still going to enjoy these thanks,1522972800,,300,3.7777777777777777
7749612,4,B01FBKVXPO,"Haven't watched yet. Some of the discs fell out of holding slots within cases, but that is normal through deliveries (Through my experiences ordering discs) Some of the individual case covers were damaged slightly but nothing too major. Discs also have minor smudges which is odd considering it's a new product. They do look watchable though, so we'll see soon.",1522886400,,361,5.033333333333333
7749613,5,B01FBKVXPO,I absolutely love having this! Everything came packaged nicely. Each season was individually wrapped as well as it all together. The blu-ray is so nice to have! It still has the English music. It has all 3 options for the different languages that the original DVD's had. The subtitle options are still the same as the original DVD's as well. The picture with the white glare on it is the DVD and the other picture is the Blu-ray Disc of the same scene. I do see a difference to the picture quality of both and think that the Bu-ray is more crisp and brighter.,1522800000,2,559,4.384615384615385
7749614,5,B01FBKVXPO,love the show and am ecstatic that i finally own the whole series,1522800000,,65,4.076923076923077

7749622,5,B01FBKVXPO,Amazing value for my childhood in a box. Everything looks and runs great. No idea what people are talking about. Absolutely nothing is widescreen or cut off. Everything is in full screen and as intended. Highly recommend for any DBZ fan!,1521158400,,237,4.804878048780488

7749625,5,B01FBKVXPO,"Check out the customer pics to see that it will play on Bluray players either A or B. Called customer service and they told me it will only work on the B region players and were very wrong. Im in Canada so I had to import it.

100% worth it! Amazing picture and sound. If you're a DB fan then this is a must own. Got it on sale for $125.

Everything is framed nicely for 16:9. DBZ looks its best like this. I hope the original DB series gets this treatment in a box set. Also hope the DBZ movies will get a box set as well.  Id import those in a heartbeat.

On season 2 right now. The Goku and Vegeta fight was amazing. Especially the Kamehameha vs Glacik Gun scene, extremely pretty and an amazing light show in HD. We all know DBZ has other amazing scenes as well.

Also Marathon mode is a godsend. I just turn that on and can watch for hours with no intro or recap. One of the best features. The original Japanese music is available in 5.1 audio and the English is 2.0 audio.

All scenes are centred and its the entire uncut version of the anime. All the cool death scenes are there and there is mild swearing. Which is amazing, best way to watch the series is this set. Highly recommended.",1520640000,4,1193,4.120689655172414
7749626,5,B01FBKVXPO,"Awesome set
The cases were cheaply made though

7749629,3,B01FBKVXPO,I love the series but I am having difficulty playing them. Both of my blueray players have said unreadable discs and the ones that do play will go to a completely black screen for a second or two from time to time.,1520035200,,214,4.119047619047619

7749634,3,B01FBKVXPO,Blu-ray discs were loose in many of the cases. Season 1 discs were covered in fingerprints and streaks. These were clearly repackaged and not brand new. Edges of sleeves were damaged/bent. Would have been 5 stars if it was actually brand new.,1519603200,2,242,4.785714285714286

picture & good sound.",1519430400,,94,4.588235294117647
7749636,3,B01FBKVXPO,Cheapest blue-ray on the market for all 9 seasons together. Blu-ray doesn't look much different than standard DVD. I recommend purchasing this on DVD to save the money because it really is almost identical. Case could have been made better and sturdier... Easily will come apart or rip if not extra careful. Every disk you are forced to watch a 2-3 minute preview that you can't skip or jump to the menu. I'm a huge DBZ fan so I was a little more generous with the rating but really I would probably only give it 2 stars if I wasn't.,1519430400,,533,4.34
7749637,2,B01FBKVXPO,"The product itself looks very nice and came in earlier than expected delivery BUT I did not receive a season 8..

7749641,5,B01FBKVXPO,"Great series. I grew up watching dbz. This is a region A set, the product information is wrong. The blu-rays in this set are the same as the individual ones. I reported the issue hopefully amazon will fix the product information.",1518739200,7,229,4.609756097560975

7749645,5,B01FBKVXPO,Was everything I dreamed of,1518134400,,27,4.6
7749646,4,B01FBKVXPO,"This is probably the best way to watch Dragon Ball Z in HD however I have some issues. The music by default is not the falconer music. You have to physically switch the audio to audio English 2 in order to listen to this with Falconer music. It gets annoying having to do this for every disc but at least its there and available.

My biggest issue that I have is that in some episodes you will notice that the animated lines outlining characters are slightly blurry. As if the projector when scanning the film was not in focus. Im curious if this is only the Blu Ray that was like this or if the original dragon ball z episodes had these blurred lines and we just couldn't tell until now. It starts to happen after the Frieza Saga, maybe around season 5. One episode that stands out to me is the one where Vegeta becomes Super Vegeta. Ill include some photos.

As for the wide screen crop I don't mind it. Each scene was put into account when cropped that it wouldnt effect the story. You honestly get used to it.

Besides some blurry episodes this is truly the best possible way to watch Dragon Ball Z",1518134400,34,1102,4.288461538461538

7749653,5,B01FBKVXPO,Such a great series!!! My fianc got it for my birthday and I absolutely love it. I remember coming home from school rushing to see if it was on and if I missed it I remember being very upset. So ready for the nostalgia. Also great job on the shipping it came a whole day early!! Way to earn 5 stars ALL THE WAY AROUND.,1516752000,2,318,3.9076923076923076
7749654,5,B01FBKVXPO,"Is it cheesy? Yeah. Did it go on way too long? Probably. But it's simply so much fun to watch, even on multiple viewings. Every major villain is excellent as well.

I have only ever watched DBZ in Japanese, I can't stand the English dub. This isn't the case for all anime, but this one is far superior in the original Japanese language.

As for the set itself, it's gorgeous. There was part of the box that was somewhat damaged which is a shame for a 200 dollar set, but all the individuals cases are in perfect condition. For the amount of content it's no doubt worth the price. If you've never seen Dragon Ball in any format, this is a great way to get the best experience.",1516492800,,675,4.265625

7749661,4,B01FBKVXPO,"First and foremost, my Xbox One X will NOT read these properly.  The opening anime preview works great but once it gets to the menu, the discs basically don't work - the menu skips and doesn't load properly.  Switched to my standalone player, all is well.

As for the discs themselves, the HD transfer is great and the audio (the TrueHD track to be specific) is fantastic.",1515196800,,372,4.522388059701493

However, this is a great way to watch it and the cropping has minimal impact on the experience. The colors are wonderful and even when I sit arms length from my 50"" it looks great. I can also confirm that it DOES work on Xbox one.",1514851200,,405,3.951219512195122

7749665,4,B01FBKVXPO,"These blu-rays look great, a massive improvement over the dvds. Still, theres some issues I have. First of all, these are widescreen (when the original was fullscreen) so some is cut off the top and bottom. This issue is fixed somewhat by the fact that they adjusted the view pwr individual scene to try to avoid cutting anything important, but it's still obvious in some instances. Unfortunately, there's no set in production currently without this issue. Also, the English dub with Japanese music option does not feature the original opening songs; you have to switch to the japanese tracks to hear Head Cha-La or We Gotta Power. Additionally, the ""textless opening"" special feature doesn't have the original songs either and this can't be changed. Other than that, the set is fine; interesting special features and great picture quality, and if you can overlook the few issues, DBZ in HD is breathtaking.",1514592000,15,907,5.013245033112582
7749666,2,B01FBKVXPO,"Buyer beware! Mine came with 2 Season 8's and no Season 7. I'm not the only one who this has happened to. Spend the little extra cash and buy them separately, so you're guaranteed the right product.",1514505600,3,198,4.378378378378378
7749667,5,B01FBKVXPO,"I'm extraordinary satisfied with something IO rdered on the internet for once!
The delivery was really fast - although it was shipped all the way from America to Germany!
I received all the seasons in order without anything missing. I was especially happy that I can select japanese audio in combination with english subtitles.
The box is beautifully designed and there were no major flaws or damages - some tiny damages on the very edges of the box aside.
I really recommend it to every DBZ fan out there!!",1514160000,4,507,4.707865168539326

This is the perfect gift for a serious Dragon Ball Z fan. It looks fantastic on a massive tv. It plays full screen (not Wide screen). This is the best present for die-hard fans because it contains all of the filler content that was cut out of the versions that were usually on TV.,1513468800,,418,4.109756097560975
7749673,4,B01FBKVXPO,I love this series so of course i would buy the box set. The only problem I have is season 3 disc 4 will not load in my bluray player. I've reordered and am still having the same problem.,1513382400,,187,3.8205128205128207
7749674,5,B01FBKVXPO,"If you're not an absolute/extreme DIE HARD critique and fan of dragon ball z: I know people criticize the removal of grain from the background from the scenes of these Bluray versions of DragonBallZ however I must say it's not annoying at all. The background is still the background, and the colors are impressive. I also heard some people criticize the contrast and brightness, however it's absolutely fine and sharp in my opinion. The whites aren't blinding, and the image is so sharp that the fight scenes are absolutely beautiful. I grew up watching dragon ball z and always wished I had all of the episodes. In the Orange Brick sets (DVD) release of DBZ, the lines on the characters had gaps in them and it looked very unfinished. These Blu-ray releases absolutely fix that and the image is sharp, clear, and nicely colored. Now to address the cropping issues that people complain about: the cropping doesn't interfere with the characters or scenery because they were careful about where they cropped the scenes- compared to the orange brick set that automatically cropped the image (in those, the cropping definitely interfered with the characters etc). (They decided to crop because DBZ was originally made for TVs with a 4:3 aspect ratio but since TVs became wide instead of squarish it's now 16:9 so they decided to adjust the image. I'm just saying they did it way more wisely with the Blu-ray compared to the DVD).  Only if you're TRULY super METICULOUS about details, should you complain or criticize this Blu-ray release. Personally it's absolutely 100% perfect for people looking for the series, in great quality, as a set.

Now for the package: it came in near perfect condition within 2 days (I have prime). The only very slight problem was that a corner of the set was revealed so it had a very small amount of damage. Nothing major at all though. Overall extremely satisfied. View pictures attached.",1513209600,5,1917,4.859327217125382
7749675,4,B01FBKVXPO,Bought as a gift. Giftee was surprised to get the blu ray but very happy with the set. Exactly what he wanted.,1512864000,,110,4.045454545454546
7749676,2,B01FBKVXPO,I ordered this package brand new and the box arrived looking worn and bent in and frayed on the corners,1512777600,2,103,4.2

7749679,5,B01FBKVXPO,Amazing collection at an affordable price. Watching DBZ in Blu-ray is breath taking! It has the US broadcast as well as the original Japanese music.,1512432000,,148,4.96
7749680,5,B01FBKVXPO,It looks good. Great case. Great cases in cases in cases design. Great menu for each disc with cool music. Im sad that it doesnt load on xbox one at all even in the Blu Ray app. It works on ps4 though.,1511827200,2,201,3.8095238095238093
7749681,5,B01FBKVXPO,"The box set is great. If you line up side by side the seasons by 3's they make a bigger picture (1-3, 4-6, 7-9) so that's pretty badass. The episodes are 100% original and uncut with 3 listening options: English with original Japanese music, English with everyone's beloved Bruce Faulconer music, and original Japanese audio, with original Japanese subtitles. The only difference between these and the true original episodes is how great the picture quality is, I own some of the seasons on DVD orange brick, but these look noticeably better, at least from me eyes. Sure, the image is cropped at the top and bottom but i prefer it than having the black bars on the sides, you only miss out of excess hair sometimes. They don't include the Tunami intros and endings, only original opening and ending and they also don't have the episode previews at the end of the outro. Overall I give it 100% positive rating. The only downside is my box came smashed in at 2 of the corners a bit, but i won't knock off a star for such an overall amazing product at such a low price.",1511654400,3,1066,4.5
7749682,5,B01FBKVXPO,"Great series. If you want to play episodes with the Bruce Faulconer music, make sure to change from the default settings in the set up.",1511654400,,135,4.44

7749686,4,B01FBKVXPO,"Ive always been a huge fun of the Dragon Ball and Z series. I was really excited about this bundle so I preordered the bundle. I got very excited to start the series again. I received my bundle and was about to open it, until I noticed something weird. THE BUNDLE DOESNT HAVE SEASON 1!!!! I have two season 2s in a wrapped up bundle. Its weird and idk who to talk to about this situation cause its an awesome deal. Theres pictures as well. Other than that, the packaging was good and the case is awesome.",1510704000,38,504,4.206185567010309
7749687,4,B01FBKVXPO,"I'm loving this. However, it's not without it's flaws. The HD reolution is superb and they did a great job making it visually stunning. It's a shame they felt they had to crop it to be widescreen. It can be distracting at times when you feel part of a character is cut off.

I'm pleased to see that they have English with either the original Japanese music or the US version with the Bruce Faulconer music. If the US version was in 5.1 instead of Stereo, I would have been ecstatic, but it isn't sadly. And if you wanted to watch this subbed, you only get Mono sound.

All-in-all, a very solid purchase. I will recommend.",1510704000,55,621,4.344827586206897
7749688,5,B01FBKVXPO,"Everything about this is great. Just got one question, can just get the box? I pre-ordered each season separately when they were first released.
If you don't have any of the seasons on blu-ray and want them, then get this.",1510531200,,222,4.575
7749689,1,B01FBKVXPO,"Just release the set in the original aspect ratio. I hate the cropping. DBZ was not made in widescreen.  I will not wacht this abomination. You were doing it right with the power levels set, why change grrrrrrr.....

7749690,5,B01FBKVXPO,"Well first off in response to the person named ""Comic fan"" who commented on here an said in the 90's and early 2000's we didn't have excess to Animae except only on VHS an Cartoon Network smh That's a FAT LIE! In the 90's there was a very popular store called ""Suncoast"" which  carried every Animation film or show you could think of on DVD, Also in the early 2000's you had stores like ""Media Play"" & ""Circuit City"" that carried All the Animation DVD's so again Animation has always been available to buy an not hard to find sense the 90's. Now far as the review for this item I have to say I'm so glad I went with my gut instinct an waited for this Blu Ray box set I knew they would make eventually! I actually bought volumes 1-5 on Blu Ray individually then took them back to the store immediately because I always wanted the box set. Box sets are cool for a number of reasons  I'm sure you readers all ready know. So with that being said Thank you Amazon for putting out this early Christmas gift!!!

7749693,4,B01FBKVXPO,"Great series, but, I am concerned that this is just a set thrown together of all the previously released seasons.. what I mean by that is, there are some things that needed to be fixed with 2 or 3 of those sets (color, greenish tint in season 5, sound issues etc.) so hopefully, those got resolved here, in this set. Then this would truly be the best way to own the DBZ series. Especially since on the Blu Ray releases, the cropping was actually done pretty well",1507420800,3,462,4.32183908045977
7749694,5,B01FBKVXPO,"I have been waiting for a Bluray box set for a while. I purchased the first 3 volumes on bluray, and decided to wait until a box set came out. I personally enjoy the 16:9 aspect ratio. I know that some people don't like the cropping. Funimation will honestly never be able to please everyone with DBZ releases. It is such a popular show, and remastering it caused a divide in the community.

I do have the original Orange Brick set and the Dragon Box set, and even the Rock The Dragon set, but I enjoy the bluray with Bruce Faulconer music. You can also change to Japanese language as well.

I can't wait to see the DragonBall Super Box sets in the future!",1506902400,5,656,4.282258064516129

7749697,5,B01FBKVXPO,"If you grew up in the 90's or early 2000's, you probably owe your entire anime watching history to Dragonball Z, Sailor Moon, Gundam, or Cowboy Bebop. Back in the day (old man swag), anime wasn't accessible on DVD or Blueray. We actually had to run home from school or work and flip on Cartoon Network's Toonami everyday to catch the newest episode of Dragonball Z! They'd release new episodes on VHS every so often but needless to say, finding anime was expensive.

8760568,1,B01FBKVXPO,"I have to say, the rating I gave was more for product quality.

I was happy to find this Amazon exclusive on Blu-Ray for $187.00, being cheaper than the DVD set at the time, and I saw it as a deal.  Unfortunately, when I got to season 4 there was a problem.  What I expected to be the third disk of the 4th season, was instead the third disk of season 8.  I couldn't believe what I just found, and worst part was, I looked at the season 8 disks, and they were all correct.  So now I am missing disk 3 of season 4 and have 2x of disk 3 in season 8. Not something you want happening after spending $187.00, and by the time I got to the season, the return window had already closed.

I did contact Amazon and they did help me out a little in buying the 4th season again, which they didn't have to do,  but I still had to spend an extra $16 to get what I wanted which should have come correct in the first place.

All in all, I love the set and its been bringing me back to my childhood, and the item was for a great price when I bought it.  I just have a new policy when I purchase TV series, open all the boxes and make sure all the correct disks are there.  Now, I'm just hoping I don't have any other issues come up.",1532131200,2,1216,3.8669354838709675
