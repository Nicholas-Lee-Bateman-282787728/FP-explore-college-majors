The captions are literal translation, so it is hard to follow if you aren't used to the Japanese language. A few times I had to pause and think for a minute, but other than that, the show is awesome. I highly recommend it if you like supernatural shows. It's not super supernatural, but it's the closest word that I can use to describe it.",1266192000,,457,4.325581395348837
