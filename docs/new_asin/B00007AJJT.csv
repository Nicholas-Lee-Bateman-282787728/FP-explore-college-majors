7974869,4,B00007AJJT,"Volume 2 represents the middle third of Season 3 of ""M*A*S*H,"" which was the low point mainly because the previous tape had ""O.R."" and the next tape has ""Abyssinia, Henry.""  The episodes continue to focus on military hijinks, buttressed by real anecdotes and stories the producers picked up visiting medical units in Korea:
(57) ""Alcoholics Unanymous"" (Writers: Everett Greenbaum & Jim Fritzell; Aired: November 12, 1974) has Henry away and Frank (Larry Linville) declaring prohibition at the 4077th.  Grade C+: I never really find all the drinking to be all that funny, although I certainly understand the motivation behind it.  But the resolution on this one is just too cute.
(58) ""There Is Nothing Like a Nurse"" (Writer: Larry Gelbart; Aired: November 19, 1974) has the nurses being evacuated from the camp when the enemy mounts as invasion, which forces the guys to deal with each other.  Grade A-: Singer Loudon Wainwright III justified having a recurring supporting role during Season 3 with the song he sings in this episode.
(59) ""Adam's Ribs"" (Writer: Laurence Marks; Aired: November 26, 1974) has Hawkeye (Alan Alda) sick and tired of army chow.  So he decides that what they need to do is order forty pounds of ribs from Adam's Ribs, the celebrated Chicago barbecue joint.  Grade B+: This is one of the better scheme episodes of the series with bonus points for the cole slaw joke.
(60) ""A Full, Rich Day"" (Writer: John D. Hess; Aired: December 3, 1974) is another one of Hawkeye's letters home detailing another fun day at the 4077th.  Grade B: A solid but not spectacular episode.
(61) ""Mad Dogs and Servicemen"" (Writers: Linda Bloodworth & Mary Kay Place; Aired: December 10, 1974) has Radar dealing with the former when he is bit by a dog that might be raid, and the doctors concerned with the later, a solider suffering from psychosomatic paralysis.  Grade B-: This is a double-plot line episode where the two halves do not fit together all that well.  Not that they should, but it is nice when they do.
(62) ""Private Charles Lamb"" (Writers; Larry Gelbart & Sid Dorfman; Aired: December 31, 1974) has a grateful Greek regiment preparing a traditional Easter feast for the 4077th and Radar horrified that they are actually going to slaughter that cute little lamb.  Grade B-: Radar will not stand up for himself, but becomes a lion to rescue a lamb.
(63) ""Bombed"" (Writers: Everett Greenbaum & Jim Fritzell; Aired: January 7, 1975) has the O.R. keeping busy while the camp is being pounded by friendly fire, during which Trapper and Hot Lips get, well, trapped together in the storage room.  Grade B+: This episode is sort of a lesser version of the classic ""O.R.""
(64) ""Bulletin Board"" (Writers: Larry Gelbart & Simon Munter; Aired: January 14, 1975) is another collection of vignettes this time centered around camp activities posted on the camp bulletin board, including a picnic and a Shirley Temple movie.  Grade B: Nice touch with Trapper writing a letter home to his daughter.  These episodes show that ""M*A*S*H"" was comfortable just playing off of its characters without necessarily having standard plot lines.
As I indicated above, there are no classic episodes among the eight collected here (I am sure my affection for ""There Is Nothing Like a Nurse"" is atypical), but it is still a solid collection.  The rating has to do with judging these eight episodes by the high water mark on ""M*A*S*H,"" so while these were shows as good as any other situation comedy they do not represent the best of ""M*A*S*H.""",1054252800,,3529,4.869782971619365
