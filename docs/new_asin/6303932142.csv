7856394,5,6303932142,"This is the best Tweed movie I've seen. While Sensual Response, available in UR is a bit more revealing, the Scorned plot is better and Shanon's acting skills show too.  ... Nothing hidden.
Tweed's hubby is hoping to be promoted. He arrives at work that day and finds out otherwise. Destroyed, he kills himself. Shannon finds out who the guy was who beat her husband out. She must get revenge at any cost and begins.
Learning about the creep, somehow Tweed gets to be close friends with him, wife and virgin teen son.  She learns
all their moves. At same time, she deflowers the lad and falls
for his youthful staying power.  Toward the end, the creep figures out who is haunting him.  There are a few last scenes.
This has more sensualism than her others, a good plot and all-round excellent acting. One nude of Shannon is worth 100,000
others. So, don't count. The R version is already getting scare. W/in a year, barring a re-issue ... For Tweed fans and admirers of sensual beauty,
this is the best.  Thrilling, chilling deception too. Dr. K.",1046217600,12,1046,4.602150537634409
7856395,5,6303932142,"Count your blessings if you are able to get a hold of the unrated
version! The rated version is still good,but alot of scenes get shortened. The way Shannon completey stupifies the virgin son in the family with raw,sexual temptation is a work of art. My favorite scene in the movie(and I have yet to see another Tweed movie with her doing anything even remotely close to this)is where she gets it from behind on the pool table.....that scene is extremely close to porn with all her grunts,groans and facial expressions. In short:BUY THIS VIDEO!!",1021248000,18,545,4.747368421052632
7856396,4,6303932142,"The marvelous Shannon Tweed, is at her finest in this soft-core thriller where the story is just as excplosive as the sex.  A must for all Tweed fans and a definite for ALL fans of flesh.",923097600,4,187,4.194444444444445
