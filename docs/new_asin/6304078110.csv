776433,5,6304078110,"Oliver Stone's ""Nixon"" is an extremely powerful study of not just Richard Nixon, but of politics and power. Of how our system works, about the dark corners we rarely hear about, only when things like Iran  Contra come to light. This is an epic biographical study of one man and how  he shaped history. Anthony Hopkins gives a performance that immediatly  ignites the screen with a fury. Stone's directing is that of a master. He  truly is a genius in not only the craft of screenwriting, but directing as  well. The screenplay by Stone, Stephen J. Rivele and Christopher Wilkinson  is wonderfully complex. Like ""JFK,"" this is a masterpiece in film  assembly. There is so much information in here, so many characters, all  skillfully written into a grand, intense and powerful work. Everything from  the Kennedy assassination to the assassination of Patrice Lumumba are  explored here to some degree. I also loved the way in which Stone with  cinematographer Robert Richardson, combine so many film formats. Some scene  are in color, others in black and white, and some scenes are shot in both  formats. The score by John Williams is rich and powerful, even inspiring.  This is a huge, brilliant movie. ""Nixon"" is a great, great film  that everyone intersted in how the system works should see.",943660800,4,1293,4.894009216589862
776434,5,6304078110,"Although never one for historical accuracy, Oliver Stone has once again crafted an intoxicating motion picture.  If you like politics, ""Nixon"" is hard to resist.  And even if you don't enjoy politics,  this is an entertaining tour-de-force.  The DVD transfer is overall quite  good, with the 2.35:1 widescreen a joy to watch.  I found Anthony  Hopkins' performance terrific, and the ""flashbacks"" to the  childhood days poignant and at times beautiful. I would highly recommend  this movie to all film buffs.",931219200,4,507,5.2375
776435,5,6304078110,"Oliver Stone's portrait of the defining character of American political history in the second half of the twentieth century is disturbing, illuminating, overwhelming, impressive, artful: a poetic statement on a  grand scale.  A worthy sequel to the revolutionary incisiveness of  ""JFK,"" this epic gives a human face to the beastly nature of  modern geopolitics.  Nixon, to Stone's credit, wears this face in all its  sympathetic, tragic, fatally flawed glory.  Here is the man, beset with his  own psychic struggles and simple ambitions, who dared to ride the beast and  was thrown off bucking to the ground.
Here's the political statement  established beyond question in ""JFK"" and elaborated in  ""Nixon"": world politics, driven ostensibly by the most powerful  nation in the world, is at the mercy of gangsters.  Gangsters and Big  Money-the privately powerful-strike deals with government through covert  liaisons such as the CIA.  The deal is this:  Protect us from prosecution  and we will kill your enemies for you, our way.  We will even fund your  next campaign.  Just let us continue doing business the way we like to do  it.  If you don't like this deal, we can end it for you at any time:  ""in a heartbeat"": our way.",930528000,2,1226,4.985074626865671
776436,5,6304078110,"One of the greatest films of all time.  A fascinating, engrossing, and stirring story, an intriguing but always realistically portrayed cast of characters, and a tragedy that will become as legendary as Macbeth or  Hamlet.  Oliver Stone, the  most successfully bold filmmaker since  Stanley Kubrick, finally matures and realizes his potential with this one.  It is over 200 minutes long, but it is watchable again and again. Even  though ""Nixon"" would have worked even if Richard Nixon had never  existed, it is gratifying to see Oliver Stone sticking to the actual  history, give or take (quite unlike ""JFK"").  Anthony Hopkins  becomes the character, rather than immitating Nixon. James Woods does the  same thing with John Erlichman.  Paul Sorvino takes exactly the opposite  approach with Henry Kissinger, but it works both because his performance is  entertaining and because Kissinger is so ingenuine.  The scenes that  Oliver Stone CUT from film (which you'll get to see if you buy the video)  are better than 99% of the crap that's playing in theaters.  Do yourself  a favor and purchase ""Nixon"" right now.",923616000,2,1113,5.111731843575419

776524,5,6304078110,"In writer and director Oliver Stone's amazing theater-in-the-round type exploration, I felt I was seeing this story from several sides concerning our thirty-seventh President Richard Milhous Nixon. I found it to be so engrossingly real in the lead character - a flawless Anthony Hopkins. There was absolutely nothing that I could find wrong with his portrayal - from his diction, intonation, cadence, chronic paranoia, mannerisms, temperament, etc. but a strikingly convincing study of a disturbed man and President found to be involved in criminalities that turned this country (and history) upside down then shook it around for a while for the truth of what had happened. The ensemble cast here neither disappoints nor could I find one that was not a standout. Paul Sorvino as Henry Kissinger is an unbelievable actor and a chameleon here, James Woods as H.R. Haldeman dons his crewcut and arrogant persona but was completely devoted to Nixon. Joan Allen portrayed Pat Nixon (Buddy) brilliantly as not being the dutiful wife at all times but voicing her opinions and does not hold back her own desires or anger while keeping a sometimes quite awkward 'iffy' balance with a man who could be incredibly emotionally cruel. The President and First Lady, along with a flawless cast, intriguingly fill the time with the measured pace of a metronome, plumped with information which extends to the full runtime of three hours and eleven minutes. We understand things which we may not have known as sharply many, many times and especially through what was secretly taped within the White House unbeknownst to most everyone.

This has enough real life happenings (Vietnam War, archival footage, Watergate, huge protests about the war, Congressional hearings, etc.) and several private times with Nixon alone where some artistic license would have been added but was so entertaining that I was glad for Nixon's times by himself to make up my own mind about the man. I still came to the same conclusion although was gratefully pleased with the added footage. I also enjoyed seeing where Richard Nixon grew up and came from - Whittier, CA - his devout Quaker family situations with his brothers (including a younger Tony Goldwyn as Harold) and parents (Mary Steenburgen as his mother Hannah), his feelings about his early life, his school life and early advancement in schooling by joining football or his social class standing. Most of all, Nixon's feelings about himself appeared to carry him throughout a lifetime of self-loathing especially while alone. This is all fleshed-out with the feeling of your 'present may be shaped from your past' but doesn't give any license to be criminally inclined to favorability amongst a people when so much power is within one's own grasp. If only one could really learn from the adage...""Those Who Do Not Learn From History Are Doomed To Repeat It.""... Nixon seemed to me to believe that he was an obstacle-free President. Believing he should trample anything in his myopic path, he made decisions the way he pleased as his opinions of how the nation should be run, honestly or not, was the only way... but his personal way to equate greatness was for proving himself first and our nation second. All in all, an introspective look into the President's life with a tighter vision and many ideas that I have seen before in several documentaries, oral reports, book studies, later extremely concise interviews on ""All the President's Men"", and the like. Richard Milhous Nixon was one President that surely was an anomaly.",1499558400,2,3548,5.044293015332197

776577,3,6304078110,"Checking in at over three hours this feels like it is longer than the Nixon Administration. With flashbacks inside of flashbacks this tells the tortured tale of Richard M. Nixon who was raised in a spiritual family by the Salt of the Earth (poor) father. He lost two of his brothers to ailments. He loses to Kennedy in 1960 and then is unable to win the Governor's Office in 1962. His wife has had it.

He appears to be in Texas when Kennedy is cut down an after Bobby Kennedy gets lead poison he decides his time has com in 1968. After that it is a string of battling 'enemies' as he appears to conspire to cover up his actions and then tape records his doings which is then evidence (his undoing).

He does go to China and works up a stand off with Russia, but Viet Nam remains a problem. A large load of imagery. A lot of characters. A mess. Swearing.

Disk Two features Director Stone talking to the camera about the film and then a nearly hour-long interview with Charley rose where they take turns asking each other 'What do you think/' (REALLY?!)

776617,1,6304078110,"To give context, I disliked Nixon and have no interest in defending him in any way. The movie is awful and terribly miscast. It is too long and in that extended time tells us nothing. It is only the most well-known and already famous incidents and appearances, the insight value is zero. But mainly it is just a very boring movie. And mainly, Anthony Hopkins in no visual or vocal way resembles Nixon. Half of America in 1972 could do a better Nixon impersonation than he even attempted.

Stone is too obviously fixated on his own interpretation of events and has no hesitancy to distort historical facts in his own favor. For that matter he has no qualms about outright fabrication. Maybe Hollywood is known for conspiracy theories and maybe the viewing audience expects it, but for this movie to spend so much time glossing over so many important events but still have time for the loony is one of the main reasons it fails.

The casting is horrendous. Maybe it is the makeup that is horrendous but the actors simply do not greatly resemble the figures they portray. The main problem is Hopkins. He doesn't vaguely look like Nixon and he does not sound like him either. He does get a good bit of his personal nature and mannerisms across, but the stand-up comics of Nixon's time especially Rich Little were ten times better at it. But if you showed someone a photo of George C. Scott as Patton, you would say that is Patton. But show a thousand people who have not seen the movie a photo of Hopkins from this one, and not one of them would guess Nixon. That is too major a failing for a major film.",1480550400,,1600,4.476027397260274

776659,2,6304078110,"First of all, while I am a fan of Sir Anthony Hopkins, he is miscast in this movie. Second of all, the film stays closely to Oliver Stone's directing themes...the Vietnam War was/has been the worst event in mankind's history, John Kennedy walked the surface of the sea and healed by touch, and Richard Nixon was just shy of Satan himself. What I thought Stone conveyed well in the film was the absolute fierce will Nixon had, his ambition, which drove him for political success but eventually undermined his political life. I thought Stone took liberal license with Pat Nixon being portrayed as (apparently) an alcoholic...not sure if that has ever been verified, but portraying Mrs. Nixon as suffering humiliation hit the nail on the head.
One idea that was brushed on lightly by Stone, (and I found it disgusting) was the implication that Nixon had some exposure to a group of powerful men (in the dusty hinterlands of Texas, apparently) who were serious about killing John Kennedy. Can we please have movies free of baseless conspiracies? I forgot that Stone loves them, especially regarding Kennedy's assassination. Unnecessary.

The overwhelming reason for this is that so much of the source material comes from concrete sources such as the Nixon tapes, the David Frost interviews, Congressional testimony, and Nixon himself.  Others that were part of the Nixon administration have also written their accounts of Watergate, so there is plenty of source material to work with.

776747,4,6304078110,"Oliver Stone kept a tighter rein on the facts for Nixon than he has with other productions of his, affording a concise and detailed look at this complex politician, from his childhood to his resignation from the Presidency.

This entire cast is amazing, stepping into the persona of each person we followed on the news for several years as Watergate unfolded.  Joan Allen becomes Pat Nixon, with a depth of character that we never saw in her dutiful public life as First Lady, not always silently enduring her husbands political drive that could, at times, make him cold, distant and mentally cruel.

Paul Sorvino is Henry Kissinger, voice and all. Erhlichmann, Haldeman, Haig, all represented with top-notch performances.

Larry Hagman is perfect as the embodiment of all bourbon-swilling Dallas Republican millionaires, the kind who didn't have any love for Kennedy. Hagman is far more convincing in his brief role here than he ever was as J.R.

But it is Anthony Hopkins who was chosen for the lead role, and he commands this movie with the same pseudo confidence that Nixon showed as a statesman, presiding over world events for six years, including his own downfall. Hopkins gives this role a genuinely definitive interpretation, complete with the phony spring-loaded smiles and happy public face, the mask behind which was hidden all of the mans insecurities and fear of not being loved.

That, in short, is the story of Nixon, and Oliver Stone tells it very well indeed.

776795,5,6304078110,"This film covers a fascinating and complex subject, to say the least.  I appreciate the way it ""fills in the blanks"" of President Richard Milhous Nixon.  I realize that no book or movie can explain the totality of an individual.  However, this one does a very good job of helping the viewer understand his perspective and motivations.  Not condone them, but understand the how's and why's of President Nixon's actions.
The selection of Anthony Hopkins to fulfill this role, was perfection!  Not surprisingly, he hits this one out of the park! (Doesn't he always?)  The time he spent in studying Richard Nixon is clear.  He embodied the character and will blow your mind with the physical resemblance, the mannerisms, the speech cadence and intonations.  This portrayal is haunting.  This film offers a excellent ensemble cast.  Everyone gave stellar performances.  They obviously cared and understood the historical gravity of the story they were telling.  I highly recommend this film to anyone who has an interest in this Presidency, this period of time in U.S. history and in Sir Anthony Hopkins.  This incredible actor keeps amazing me!  I've learned to just buy his films - sight unseen!  Because he delivers!!  He never disappoints the viewer.  He never half-steps.  If he takes on the project, he will give it everything he's got.  He reaches into the depths of his being, to convey to the audience the character's feelings, thoughts, beliefs, and  fears.

Like many other viewers, I have trouble following all of the plot twists. Nixon's involvement with CIA Black Ops during Eisenhower's presidency is shadowy at best. I respect Stone's view that History is fluid, which in practical terms means that the establishment, history-book version of American events is often just as imagined and exaggerated as his own re-vision of American history. However, he takes outrageous liberties with his material in this movie and I feel like he's stirring the shi*** rather than trying to find the truth behind Nixon's presidency.

The film must've been exhaustively researched.  Some people don't believe this, for it is Oliver Stone.  Critics say, he's drawing his own conclusions and dramatizing history, essentially bending it, toward his will.  Okay, fair enough.  I suppose it's a fair critique to say this is true of Stone in Nixon.  But I was very surprised, after watching the new HBO documentary, ""Nixon By Nixon"", that some of the conversations that appear on Nixon's very own personal recordings with his staff can be seen and heard in this film verbatim.  Seriously!  Spend an afternoon, as I did, and watch Stone's Nixon alongside the HBO documentary and you will see it is--partially or perhaps-- very accurate.

There are so many important issues here in this film that still ring true today.  For example, Daniel Ellsberg and the persecution of the press under Nixon.  Nixon wanted nothing more than to silence Ellsberg forever for the leaks to the press of Pentagon Papers, just as Edward Snowden is the thorn in the current administrations' side.

The fact is, you have to be power hungry to want to be president.  You'd have to be crazy to want that job!  No matter what the Government says about transparency and the leaks' negative effects on how it conducts its business-- transparency is essential to Democracy.  Whistle blowers are always important.  It's no wonder the government wants their secrets in the shadows.  Of course they do, it gives them more power than is necessary to effectively govern its own people.

Look at me, I've gone off on a tangent.  And now I risk sounding crazy like Oliver Stone, that wild man.  (However, I must say I don't agree with his JFK conclusions, but simply find it interesting.)  No matter; this is my review and this is how I feel.  I agree with the conclusions Stone comes to with Nixon.  For example, America's perpetual War Machine, if you will.

The quagmire of wars the U.S. finds itself in then and now--it's the same.  Which is why the slogan for the cover of the Nixon ""Election Year Edition"" blu ray is: History Repeats Itself.

I love the scene where Nixon explains to a female Vietnam protestor, or rather she him, that it's as if he's trying to control a wild animal...which I'm assuming is a reference to what Eisenhower called, a Military Industrial Complex.  It's fantastic when Hopkins realizes he is, essentially, powerless to stop America's War Machine.  This is the nature of ""the beast.""

Check out the interview w/ Stone on the Charlie Rose show, bonus features.  And the documentaries and commentaries on these discs.  Stone, obviously, has a lot to say.  He's done two documentaries and a nearly 4 hour movie to prove his point, with this director's cut.

777029,1,6304078110,"I found this movie to be gratuitously mean spirited towards the memory of Nixon.  I never felt Anthony Hopkins really captured the persona of Nixon from what I've watched in old clips.  Hopkins never should have been cast for this role as he played it more like a Richard III Shakespeare role.  Stone experimented with several split screen images in which Nixon is shown giving a very weak justification for some action while footage of some horrible aspect of the Vietnam war ran in the background.  In the end, Stone, just not to be vicious, plays footage from Nixon's funeral and, through narration, gives some credit to Nixon for rolling back the cold war.  But after 3 hours of watching Hopkins play Nixon like a drunk clown, I didn't find the half-sincere epilogue to be very balancing.

I think Stone missed an opportunity to surprise us with an interesting but balanced depiction of an turning point in history.  It was just the movie version of every liberal's jaded view of who Nixon was.  I also didn't like that where Stone added little fictional touches, they universally just were more attacks on Nixon's memory.  3 hours is a lot to invest in this turkey.",1401840000,3,1170,4.724137931034483

In either case, it was unbearably long, unbearably overacted -  and I'm a big fan of Anthony Hopkins. No one shined in this 'drama.' Did I watch it all the way through? Yes. What was my reward?

Before I saw this film in the 1990s, I was skeptical that Hopkins could play Nixon. Lane Smith had done a fine job in a made-for-TV film, but he looked a lot like the man already. Hopkins is really brilliant, though. He has all the mannerisms and quirky body language down perfectly. He displays all of the weaknesses, fears and anxieties that Nixon generally concealed behind an armored personality. The Jekyll-and-Hyde personality of RN leaves the viewer overwhelmed that such a troubled man could rise so far in American politics.

Stone depicts the Watergate scandal ambiguously enough to leave room for alternate theories about it (What were the Plumbers really doing? Was the CIA involved in trying to bring down Nixon?). Larry Hagman's ""Jack Jones"" character and his mysterious friends represent the darker forces lurking behind the scenes, threatening Presidents one way or another.

The rest of the cast is brilliant too. James Woods is terrific as always. Joan Allen frequently steals the scene as Pat Nixon. It's wonderful to see the restored scene with Sam Waterston playing CIA Director Richard Helms.",1397606400,2,1241,5.138613861386139

777037,3,6304078110,"There are clearly TWO different ""reviewers"" to offer an opinion on this film: the ones who were young enough to live with the horrible events of the political tumult that engaged this president------democrats, fiercely protective Republicans, as well as Independents, etc. and those who, curious and motivated enough took a good, ""objective"" (what is that?) study of it all, perhaps years later, or in school or college. Then there are us, (this reviewer was a child (ten-twelve to be exact) and the last thing I was concerned with was (uggh!) politics-----though I am proud to say I was reading Maxim Gorky already,and I thank a good Humanities program (only in retrospect) and as time went by, and after two books AND a mini-series of about ten hours, (its name escapes me, but very, very engrossing) was, barely so,""educated"" on the subject and Nixon himself, yet, alas, quite a bit unable to fully grasp in any scholarly way the complexity and ramifications of this horrible catastrophe, except in chapters here and there. Therefore, for me there isn't the ""problem"" of having much preconceived notions about Mr. Checkers (or passionate, particularly, ones.) Perhaps the observation on which so many agree that he was one of the most corrupt (caught, that is...), curiously ""Bi-polar"" (ha! the word of the day) president with a most pathetic, tragic personality is a general statement that is not too clueless when delivered.
My conclusion is that Mr. ""Revisionism"" was not concerned with the political, professional record as much as the PERSONAL one. After all, tremendously  important, seminal events (Cambodia, say) get simply a word while Mr. Nixon carries on and on with a distinctly personal plot---again, concentrating on his life and the haunting memories of his past, among them a brother who died when Nixon was a kid.
The film is,indeed, magnificently long------long enough to take that  trip to the kitchen or bar to fortify yourself for more grimaces and a strangely pathological grin that has you shuddering, but somehow things rarely lag. At 3 and 1/2 hours, perhaps it could have been 3 instead, but again, you rarely look at your watch.
I can't remember the last time I saw an Oliver Stone film, but what I DO remember is the controversy regarding his manipulation of truth when it comes to these biopics (which I myself generally avoid, the closer I am to the subject---intellectually, morally, etc.)
A BIG word of advice is to check your Wikipedia, but perhaps more academically your Oxford biography on Nixon  since Mr. Stone offers you NO clues whatsoever in what slowly becomes a more and more convoluted life. But again, you will barely need the full events of the Watergate scandal, for example, since it is all filmed in a sloppy manner for the (not including you, of course) uncultivated masses that do not even know that Watergate was a major stain in American history, and the rather ""tony"" ones (remember TONY?!)who will think of the very interesting architecture of its hotel and Condo/rental (?).
Again, if you have no solid knowledge of a character from real life, you must find other ways to ascertain this work of ""art"", if it piques your curiosity (and it certainly should).
The man was deeply flawed, HAUNTED by demons that never receded, an extraordinarily TOUGH career which would drive you and I to suicide, with the luck of a beautiful, loving wife always present, ever-suffering there for him, and an uncomfortable quality due to the most unbalanced of egos that was awkward, arrogant, sadistic, foul-mouthed, coarse----and every possible adjective that you could add in the negative. Yet, after all this mess of a personality, Mr. Stone would have us believe that he was a deeply spiritual man, in constant struggle with himself, ultimately a good human being (watch him praying with that shadow of a man, Mr. Kissinger himself! A truly bizarre moment!)
Perhaps it does not stray from the truth much. Being president, more and more we realize, is a creepy job that has little to do with anything truly heroic but with the struggles of a gigantic ego constantly in search for adulation and love.
Sociopathy, indeed, has taken a greater and greater place in the set of characteristics necessary for such labor, perhaps one that may partly begin with delusions of changing the world, soon crushed by the realities of such a set of putrid elements.
But----closer to the film, let me tell you that the acting is wonderful, and Ed Harris, Joan Allen, Larry Hagman---------a magnificent group of brilliant actors inevitably elevate the screenplay to something of greater quality than it may be.
And Anthony Hopkins? Well, one great sign for me is that I never thought of his serial killer for once. It has happened a couple of times, but it was absent here. As well, the mannerisms, the shyness coupled with a roller coaster of bravado and self-confidence add up to a quite believable job. And unlike Ms. ""identical twin"" (you do know  who, of course) he does not only offer us a mimic's ""genius"" but an interpretation. This is a most extraordinary feat to perform, and one to which ""Ms. Thatcher-double"" has managed less and less to achieve.
And yet Nixon is nowhere to be seen somehow. The script, perhaps? Direction?..... It misses my limited powers of analysis, but you know when you are dealing with a character that's fully ""realized"", and that is not the case here. Riveting, yes, but words fail me. And I will not blame Mr. Hopkins for it.
How much LESS corrupt was Ronald Reagan, JFK, FDR, ------My G-D, Bush Junior????? My estimation, as somewhat uninformed and fragmented as it is, is that none of these men were any BETTER, morally, than Nixon. That has been my idea, if a very sad one, of politicians ever since childhood indeed, and Stone manages to support it.
Presidents are no more ""corrupt"", no more  ""moral"" than you and I. Their lives, however, are scrutinized in such a microscopic way that you MUST find error.
Of course, corruption of justice is no joke, but I believe that to a certain extent Nixon tried hard and succeeded in elevating himself ABOVE his dreadful, criminal ""mistakes"", after such a humiliating end--------and perhaps, most ironically so, bring down the office to a level closer to ""humanity"" (re: Bill Clinton). There are no ultimate HEROES in politics (Thomas Jefferson, perhaps?)----for that matter, in life itself. We are all simply trying our best (or even worst) to find peace of mind. Ultimately, and inescapably, we are reduced to our own needs, our own illusions, selfishly so (but don't get me confused with an adherent of Ms. SELFISHNESS herself, ""philosopher"" RAND.)

777073,4,6304078110,"Richard Nixon, who served as the 37th President of the United States from 1969 until he resigned in disgrace in 1974, is probably the most controversial president in American history. Nixon was a man with a complicated and awkward personality.

In its three-and-a-half hour running time, Director Oliver Stone looks at Nixon's entire life from his childhood in Whittier, California until he resigned the presidency. Nixon had a long and eventful professional life and the film explores many parts of it. This goes from his earlier political career in Congress, his failed run for president in 1960 and his return to politics in 1968. The movie employs a non-linear form of telling its story and tends to jump around different points in Nixon's life.

The best part of this movie is the acting which is excellent all around. The star of the film, Anthony Hopkins, does a tremendous job in his role as Nixon. In my opinion, the other greatest performance in this film is Paul Sorvino as Henry Kissinger who plays the part so well it is difficult to tell him from the real person.

Oliver Stone is well-known for not shying away from controversy. Despite his own dislike of Nixon, the film generally tries to depict Nixon fairly. (It seems the only person Stone really wanted to denigrate was CIA Director Richard Helms.) Nixon was a complicated person and was often cynical and paranoid and the film generally shows this well. There are times when the movie strays into the realm of conspiracy theories. Probably the most egregious example of this is that it is implied that Nixon, whether implicitly or not, was involved in the John F. Kennedy assassination which is a ludicrous accusation.

Overall, I generally liked this film despite a couple of small flaws. I would recommend this DVD to those interested in Richard Nixon or American political history.",1387843200,,1855,4.898089171974522

It is a slow, yet damn good 3 1/2 hours of filming and really reveals the struggles the former President endured despite his good intentions which have been overruled by his flaws.

I have to agree with reviewers who have referred to the production in general and Hopkins' performance as Shakespearean. As a lover of Shakespeare, perhaps this is why the film appeals to me so much. RN as played by Hopkins and written and directed by Stone is endlessly fascinating. He is sad, insecure, flawed, slimy, heartless, self-absorbed--& sympathetic. The film is 3.5 hours long because it actually attempts to give a full portrayal. We see his relationship with his parents and brothers; his relationship with Pat; his interactions with his staff & Hoover; a brilliant scene b/w RN and R. Helms of the CIA; one with the student movement; and most of the famous scenes of his career.

777125,5,6304078110,"I was a preteen when President Nixon resigned and remember watching it on television with my father and it is a powerful memory even at that young age and which was reinforced by this great film by Oliver Stone.

Sure, some loose historical connections are made which are a bit fanciful and Anthony Hopkins, great actor though he is, sometimes comes off playing Nixon as a caricature rather than the actual individual but these are all done in the name of making the film entertaining as well, which it certainly is.  If you visit the Nixon Presidential Library in California, you can get more of the balanced facts, both good and bad, on Nixon the man and leader.

Nevertheless, what this film does get completely right is in providing a gripping psychological portrait of the 37th President of the United States, against the backdrop of the tumultuous events of those times and how he dealt with them, given his complex personality that was shaped by his world view and personal background.  Speaking of his personal background, particularly Nixon's younger years, he is played as a child and as a young man by two different actors who both do a superb job via black and white flashback sequences.  Their sensitive performances really lead into what is really the key to this picture, the fantastic acting jobs done by a virtual ""who's who"" of Hollywood.  Some are cast in smaller roles than others based on the size of their connection to Nixon but it seems as though even one of them adds something meaningful to the story.  I will just mention a few others but others are certainly worthy of note as well.  Larry Hagman is perfectly suited to play a right wing, Texas businessman that is involved in a few ""smoky backroom"" scenes both before and after Nixon becomes president.  Paul Sorvino in a larger role as Henry Kissinger has the part down perfectly in terms of looks and voice and Bob Hoskins is very good as Head of the FBI, J. Edgar Hoover.  Also convincing is James Woods as H.R. Haldeman and the list goes on and on...  Joan Allen is terrific as Pat Nixon although like the Nixon Role played by Anthony Hopkins, she goes over the top in a few scattered scenes.

Lastly, I had to mention the terrific musical score by John Williams.  Although he has done much more popular works, I just thought it was wonderfully ominous and really added to the film's magic.  As for Oliver Stone, I think he was quite smart to engender a lot of sympathy for Nixon in the film and again, he spent a lot of time probing for the clues from his past to his behaviors and actions while in the White House.  There is also some real dark humor  in the film which I personally love and the scene where Nixon cannot open his bottle of prescription pills while listening to excerpts of his tapes behind closed doors is great!

Again, a great film in my opinion all the way around and this ""Director's Cut"" Version with additionally restored scenes is well worth the price of admission.",1371945600,3,2974,4.591682419659735
777126,5,6304078110,"Oliver Stone's 1995 film Nixon is something of an oddity. Released on the back of Stone's success with JFK and Natural Born Killers, it was largely praised by critics yet was all but ignored by audiences. Nearly twenty years later, the film stands up though as one of Stone's best films and presents an intriguing portrait of one of the most controversial men to occupy the Oval Office: Richard Milhous Nixon.

Anthony Hopkins performance as Nixon is the heart and soul of the film. While Hopkins may not have done Nixon's voice or bare the greatest resemblance to him, he is nevertheless compelling in the role. Hopkins does that by capturing the many varying and often contradictory qualities of Nixon as the film moves back and forth through time from 1960 to 1974 and the year's in-between. There are moments of introspection, moments where's purely unlikeable (such as the dinner scene between Nixon and Pat late in the film) and yet moments where he is all too human. What Hopkins and the film succeed in doing is making Nixon not a caricature, but a human being and the film ultimately works as a result.

The rest of the cast is strong as well. Paul Sorvino makes for an excellent and utterly convincing Henry Kissinger and, like Hopkins, rises up the caricatures to create a full-fledged character. Joan Allen's performance from Pat Nixon is interesting to watch as the relationship between her and Nixon develops and leads to some of the film's best scenes (such as the aforementioned dinner scene). There are also strong performances from James Woods, J. T. Walsh, David Hyde Pierce, Powers Boothe, Bob Hoskins, Sam Waterston (who only appears in the director's cut and steals the show for the space of his lengthy scene as CIA director Richard Helms) and Mary Steenburgen amongst others in the large cast. Like Stone's JFK, the film works in large part due to the strength of its cast.

The film's production values are strong well. The film's recreations of the Nixon White House are stunning both to look at it and in their historical accuracy. The production design also does fine work creating the various settings of the film ranging from where Nixon grew up to a TV studio where one of the 1960 television debates took place to Air Force One and the presidential yacht. There's also a sparse but well done score from John Williams which also incorporates some good source music, including quoting Williams' own score for JFK at one point. What doesn't work as well is a newsreel sequence set after Nixon's 1962 defeat when he ran for governor of California due to some crude and even laughable pasting of Hopkins face into archival images and footage but that it is just about forgivable in light of the rest of the film.

Looking at the film itself, it's easy to see why it failed to find a larger audience. Nixon takes the leaps in time seen in JFK (which itself was arguably a murder mystery on a fundamental level) to new levels as the film begins on the brink of the infamous 1972 Watergate break in, jumps forward to November 1973 and then proceeds to engage in a series of flashbacks (often within another flashback) as well as leaping forwards in time as it heads to the Presidential resignation in August 1974. The film also takes on a surreal and, at times, hallucinatory air such as bomb's exploding behind Nixon during a visit to the Lincoln Memorial, an odd tunnel effect used during his pneumonia episode or his mother's ghost appearing during one scene. The results can be hard to follow at times but the result is a rewarding one if the viewer sticks with it.

The reason is that the film, largely through its script and Hopkins' Nixon, presents a fascinating portrait of a man and his times. The film shows a man who was in many ways admirable yet could be distant, cocky, ruthless, self-pitying, and paranoid who seemed to always be unsure of himself. Ultimately, Nixon as a film is a tragedy, the story of a man who causes his own downfall as a result of letting his personal demons overrule his better nature. While the film has been criticized for its historical accuracy (though the extensive footnotes in the published screenplay goes a long way to refute that), it nevertheless presents a fascinating was and perhaps even truthful image of a man who rarely if ever showed his true face.

Nixon then is an intriguing film filled with strong performances, strong production values and a script that paints a fascinating image of a controversial figure. Yet in the way it's told, it is a film that can be long winded, leaps around decades of history and can be oddly surreal at times. As a result, Oliver Stone has created a film that is every bit as complex as its subject matter and, quite possibly, made all the better for it.",1371772800,,4768,4.690561529271207

777155,5,6304078110,"This is an amazing film, not because you will feel vindicated in one way or another for your admiration or loathing of Richard Nixon, but that you will empathize with Oliver Stone's depiction of him.  Considering how deep and complex this man was, the level of empathy can be startling.  Equally startling is the depth of the man's tragedy.

Stone borrows from Citizen Kane quite a bit in the style of story-telling, except Stone covers a much more complex character in much more depth.  This is not a Great Gatsby treatment of a man - superficial, frothy, charming - but rather its polar opposite - brooding, dark, and exceptionally introspective.  There are rays of light - moments of inspiration and triumph - interspersed in the film, but like many of the darker scenes in Citizen Kane where light trickles in from a small window penetrating an otherwise dark room, the light in this movie serves only to demonstrate the totality of the darkness in which Nixon ""slouches towards Watergate"" (if anyone recognizes the Yeats reference in the film, the quote will make sense).

There is a LOT of dialogue, and I cannot imagine anyone unfamiliar with the actors and general details of significant events in the 60s being able to enjoy this film, as the significance of events like Kent State, the Bay of Pigs, Watergate, etc., would be lost on a virgin audience.  It delves not only into these events, but speculates how Nixon, his inner circle, and his family react to them, all the while giving the significance of these events their just due.  The pace is also surprisingly quite kinetic.  Many controversial events occurred in the 60s, and the movie addresses most of them through the lens of Richard Nixon's perspective.

The acting is superb.  Anthony Hopkins transforms Nixon from the caricatures we know (and indeed his own caricature as ""the madman Richard Nixon"") into a tragic figure, a brilliant man struggling against his own demons, which seem to feed off his own hatred and multiply.  There are many instances in the film where Hopkins displays the brilliance of the man's political skill, whether it be fighting against extreme right elements in his own party, containing the damage from Kennedy's war in Vietnam, or his true legacy, the detente achieved with China and Russia.  Unfortunately, all of it is overshadowed and ultimately undone by the fights Nixon could not win, and his last concession in the movie is that the battle that cost him the war was the battle within himself, the most obvious symptom of which was Watergate.

Joan Allen plays the virtuous Republican wife, loyal to the end, slowly breaking every step of the way along with her doomed husband.  Another amazing performance.  James Woods, J. T. Walsh, and Paul Sorvino all add excellent support to the central plot - the script allows each of these pivotal figures in Nixon's inner circle to think, analyze, and empathize with Nixon's plight without taking the focus off the titular character.  David Paymer plays an almost comical role as Nixon's press secretary, although like nearly every aspect of the film, it is a comedy clouded in darkness.

All in all, for those curious as to how history will treat this complex man, Stone's Nixon does a tremendous job in elucidating Nixon's parting words: ""...only if you have been in the deepest valley can you ever know how magnificent it is to be on the highest mountain.""  Highly recommend for anyone that would like to understand why, for better or for worse, many proclaim the second half of the 20th century to be the Nixon Era.",1354147200,6,3569,4.850082372322899

I had the VHS many years ago, and I was determined to have the Director's
Cut. I wanted to see the power struggle, a debate between the CIA director
and Nixon. I wanted to see Sam Waterston recite ""Slouching Toward's Bethlehem"".

It's so powerful. Everything that happens, all that's said, the creativity of
the lighting, the various special effects. Nothing is stale, and nothing taken
from history is arbitrary. Not from the White House perspective, at least. I
apologize in advance, but if this is not an honest portrayal, then you must
have known Nixon and served on his staff. I have never been in that party,
yet I could divorce myself from my my support for Gary Johnson. Even in a totally
bipartisan environment, one must joke at things. We're not anymore. Presidents
should not be autocrats.

After skimming some journals, I find that Stone did not leave a lot out. It
would be more worthwhile to about Nixon in the blogs, knowing the basics.
I just remembered, Nixon was about 21 in the middle of the depressions. So it
gets foggy, history I mean. Young Richard was a survivor, literally. He dwelled
on the death of his siblings. I'm not sure if he felt that way about Haldeman
and Ehrichman. Dean got less compassion, although they were all attorneys and
not honest.

My favorite actors in the film are James Woods(Haldeman), David Paymer(press agent),
Larry Hagman(playing J.R. Ewing, basically), and I had a love-hate relationship
with Paul Sorvino(Goodfellas). Henry Kissinger really acted like he enjoyed the
war. The Vietnam War lasted practically the whole first term of Nixon, and his
ill-fated second term.

777161,5,6304078110,"Saying that Oliver Stone is hit or miss for me comes with the full knowledge that there is a chunk of his filmography I have yet to see.  The gap has surely been tightened thanks to my recent viewing of `Nixon' (a truly remarkable film).  Stone is, above all other things, a very controversial and opinionated director, which is probably why his films are often the center of a lot of `talk', good and bad.  Of his nineteen feature films (that is not including his documentaries, shorts and television work) I've only seen eleven.  Of those eleven, they range from the embarrassing (`Alexander') to the dismally boring (`Wall Street') to the admirable yet largely flawed (`The Doors') to the good (`W.') and the superb (`JFK').  You can list `Nixon' as one of his superb feats as well.  Honestly, this movie is fantastic.

Maybe Stone needs to pick apart all of our presidential figures.  I mean, even a film as unintentionally campy as `W.' manages to become something truly inspired in scope and reflective in manner.  You can see the love/hate relationship that Stone has with these powerful men, and he understands how to shade their lives in a way that endears us, while at the same time repulsing us.

And yes, I know that `JFK' isn't really a presidential film, but you know what I mean.

I hadn't seen `Nixon' before this weekend.  It isn't that I avoided it, but outside of Joan Allen, it doesn't really get a lot of praise on internet movie databases and so I wasn't in a rush to see it.  My tepid relationship with Stone (I want to love him because his passion inspires me, but he fails to connect the dots on many occasions) was also a stumbling block for me.  That said, the opportunity presented itself and I apparently had three hours of nothing to do, so I settled in for the long haul.

It was incredibly worth it!

Oliver Stone is not one to ever take the easy way out, and so this is a very epic consideration of Nixon's reign as president.  Instead of targeting a specific event (say, Watergate, which does happen to be a central plot point), `Nixon' basically attempts to tell of Richard's life.  In flashbacks (such clever use) we see glimpses of Nixon's childhood which helps to color in his internal animosity.  As his world is cluttered with people (this cast is expensize and impressive) we are guided along his journey from potential candidate to loser to ultimate president striving for the acceptance and love from not just the world, but himself.  Stone builds a brilliant picture of a lost soul and helps the audience to understand the man behind the name, and man that one may quickly write off or label because of certain decisions.  Instead of casting direct condemnation on Nixon, Stone uses all his resources to paint a complete portrait and allows us to decide for ourselves what kind of man he really was.

Hopkins, Allen, Sorvino, Pierce and Woods are all outstanding.  I was a little iffy on Hoskins overly obvious take on Hoover, but it was a small qualm in an otherwise overwhelmingly outstanding film.  The score, the pacing (that editing is flawless), the script and the art direction (those sets are to die for) all help create one of the better biopics of the 90's.",1341187200,4,3211,4.642477876106195

I find it hard to be inspired enough to write when I didn't engage or feel fulfilled at the end of a film (or even a music or book) experience. Sadly Nixon is one of the few films I've really not enjoyed and have given such a low star rating to. I know the period and subject relatively well, having studied it at college and reading around American politics since, and it is here where the film redeems itself; the research seems fairly well done. Unfortunately, considering the amazing cast assembled, I found many performances very dry and lack lustre. I just didn't engage or relate to any of them enough to care about the story. The direction was pretty good, as to be expected from Oliver Stone, but the constant flicking between time periods was a touch annoying and didn't do the story justice.

But Stone shows this through the filter of Nixon's wounded, bitter character. Nixon grew  up poor and had two brothers die. He had tremendous survivors guilt, and tremendous anger at rich and powerful figures like John F. Kennedy.

This is what fueled Nixon: He fought to reach peak power, and once there, used the flaws of those he hated to justify anything. We can argue if its true--but as cinema, it is amazing to watch these two forces drive the leader of the free world to madness.

You get all the perks of an Oliver Stone movie: great actors, amazing cinematography, detailed history, and epic ambition. But Stone never deviates from the psychodynamics driving the man, and that makes this dark sprawling examination the essential one on Nixon.",1295654400,8,978,4.975460122699387
777220,5,6304078110,"I'm an old hand at hating Richard Nixon. I had a head start over Oliver Stone at Nixon-hating; I was already adept at it in 1960, when Stone was just an early teenager. Stone's cinematic biography of Nixon insistently portrays Nixon himself as a Nixon-hater, the most ardent Nixon-hater of all, a man of painful insecurity, what radio/TV psychologists would call a victim of poor self image, verging on clinical paranoia. In fact, Stone's depiction of Nixon is remarkably sympathetic and multi-faceted. This fictionalized Nixon was, as the despicable fictionalized Henry Kissinger says, a man who had greatness in his grasp but who destroyed himself. The cast of accomplices and sycophants - all fictionalized of course - around Nixon during his presidency are uniformly lesser men, simpler in their evil, than he is: Haldeman is a cold-blooded apparatchik, the least troubled by ethics of the crew; Ehrlichman, Mitchell, Dean are uncomplicated placemen; Colson, Hunt, Hoover, Haig, and especially CIA Director Richard Helms are figures of Machiavellian evil. Surrounded by such a crew of villains, poor Richard Milhouse can honestly be perceived as 'a man more sinned against than sinning.'

Did you heed the word 'fictional' in that first paragraph? This film is a work of artistic interpretation, as much so as Shakespeare's Richard the Third or John Adams's opera Nixon in China. Most of the negative criticisms of the film have essentially denied the legitimacy of an artistic interpretation of 'current' events. The film was released in 1995, only twenty three years after the Watergate burglary-fiasco. Is that enough time to justify the use of Nixon as a 'dramatis persona' in what amounts to a modern Greek tragedy? All the themes of Aeschylus and Sophocles are here, fatal chance and hubris in abundance. Judged exclusively as a work of art, a theater piece intended to challenge the minds and emotions of an audience, Stone's ""Nixon"" seems to me to be a magnificent success. Anthony Hopkins is powerfully believable in the title role, just as he would be in the roe of Macbeth or Dumas's Richelieu. The collage cinematography - color mixed with black-and-white, flashbacks to Nixon's childhood, news photo realia blended with Stone's own footage - is superb. Joan Allen's portrayal of Pat Nixon was Oscar-worthy, and virtually any of the supporting cast of baddies might equally have been honored. In short, it's a potent piece of theatrical drama.

But there's still a nagging question of its 'historical' accuracy, much as we'd like to assert that history and art are different matters. Just how historically accurate is it? I'd suggest taking a look at other books, or merely at the Watergate article on wikipedia, if you're perturbed by that question. You'll find that Stone has hewn rather closely to the known facts of the events. What isn't known ... where the facts are vague... there Stone has freely asserted a controversial interpretation. The film implies that CIA attempts to 'eliminate' Fidel Castro were directly responsible for the assassination of JFK, or at least that Nixon labored under some fearful sense of guilt that such a responsibility was his. Stone does NOT explicitly endorse such a 'conspiracy' theory; he subtly shows Nixon agonizing over its consequences. Only the most fervent right-wing 'patriot' could deny that the CIA had gone 'rogue' in its several decades of covert operations. Stone's Nixon is helplessly aware of his inability to manage the ""beast"" of State; in full conscience, he both detests the CIA/FBI and depends on their complicity, in a ""can't live with 'em, can't live without 'em"" moral quandary.

Stone's ambiguous hero Nixon saw himself as a great president, an accomplisher, and he repeatedly lists his accomplishments: ending the draft; generously increasing Social security and SSI; diplomatic recognition of China and cautious arms reduction negotiations with the USSR; decreased military spending; some Keynesian measures of economic stabilization; effective support for desegregation, Civil Rights in general, and the ill-fated ERA; support for abortion rights, urged by his wife Pat; an impressive record of support for environmental protections; and above all, in his mind, ""ending the war"" in Vietnam with 'honor' by withdrawal under a guise of diplomacy. And Stone has his history right! In hindsight, Nixon was probably the best 'Democratic' president the Republicans ever elected. What his most fervent haters failed to realize was that ""opportunism"" is sometimes a synonym for ""pragmatism."" Nixon WAS a pragmatist for America, an opportunist for himself.

The dramatic climax of Nixon's career, and of this dramatization of it, was obviously Watergate, with the subsequent Constitutional turmoil and his eventual resignation. Again Oliver Stone got the basic known facts correct. His depictions of the unseen maneuvers of Nixon's staff, of his strife with Pat, and especially of Nixon's own agonistic psychological collapse are all 'artistic' liberties, speculative interpretations. Are Stone's insights legitimate? He has the art to make them seem plausible, and such artwork is/guesswork is intellectually legitimate as long as the viewer recognizes them as such. Once again in hindsight, Watergate was a paltry affair, a petty abuse of power that might have been applied to far more odious misdeeds. Stone's Nixon asserts that other presidents had pulled far sleazier stunts, used their power far more abusively, and in that he is surely accurate. Watergate was a molehill of a scandal compared to Ronald Reagan's outrageous Iran-Contra shenanigans, the most patently impeachment-worthy abuses of any president in history. But Nixon was 'hated' as vehemently as Reagan was loved. In that light, one might conclude that Nixon was fundamentally correct when he raged that 'it wasn't about the war or the nation, it was all about destroying him.' Oddly enough, Oliver Stone's Nixon isn't a cartoon monster after all; he's human enough not to be hated, although it would take an act of God to make me love him.",1294272000,10,6086,5.271134020618557
777221,5,6304078110,"When you watch Anthony Hopkins play Richard Nixon you forget all about Anthony's Oscar-winning role as Hannibal Lecter in ""The Silence of the Lambs"", a feat I believed he would never pull off. This really adds credence to the kind of wonderful actor Hopkins is; highly identified as the mad serial killer he became known as, Hopkins tore into the role as the complex and very controversial 37th President of the United States. An Oliver Stone film, ""Nixon"" tells the dramatic story of a young boy growing up in California who would become the only President in U.S. history to resign from office on August 9, 1974 due to his involvement in the Watergate scandal.

 ""Nixon"" also dramatizes the President's battle with alcohol and presription drugs and his battle to end the Vietnam War.

 Although some critics loved the film ""Nixon"" became a box office disappointment grossing a modest 13.5 million dollars on a $44 million budget. The film received four Academy Award nominations including a nod for Hopkins as Best Actor and one for Joan Allen as Best Suppoting Actress for playing Pat Nixon.

777224,4,6304078110,"[Review based upon VHS tapes].

Brilliantly written, acted, photographed movie about a self-destructive, tormented man who nonetheless had gifts most public servants did not/do not have.
Anthony Hopkins is astonishing in every scene he's in - a careful mix of imitation and creative interpretation. Paul Sorvino is also amazing, in fact, this reviewer could not identify this excellent actor until deep into the final credits. Another effective feature is the recreation of newsreel footage; the obvious depth of research is laudable.
The movie is a bit over three hours, cut down from over four. Too bad it wasn't cut down to two hours and forty minutes - the final scenes are redundant and so melodramatic that it's difficult to suppress a laugh. Another problem is in the portrayal of Pat Nixon by Joan Allen: another strong performance but in the end, very unconvincing - I surmise that the powers-that-be felt it necessary to ""feminize"" the First Lady; the ""real"" lady did not exactly confine herself to tours of the Rose Garden. Far too many scenes with *the movie* Pat as the exasperated, long-suffering, wife, psycho-analyzing the guy who never grew up.
The film is an overall drammatic and historical success and should provoke lively discussion and reflection: with such easy access to the ""Nixon Record"", 15 years later via the Internet, his accomplishments can be compiled into a very impressive list. A picture is formed of a true maverick Republican, who was pro-Affirmative Action, ended the Vietnam War and the draft; opened up positive relations with ""enemies"" who years later would actually help the United States financially and scientifically.
Although Ronald Reagan is today's conservative role model, his public record cannot stand up to Nixon's. This Oliver Stone effort should go a long way to giving credit where credit is due.",1270080000,,1852,5.152823920265781

The Bottom Line:

Nixon contains a lot of fascinating material, from Anthony Hopkins' magnificent performance to Oliver Stone's interesting take on Nixon as a tragic hero, but eventually it wears out its welcome due to poor choices by Stone (the constant flashbacks to Hannah Nixon) and an incredibly overlong running length with some scenes (e.g. Sam Waterston as the CIA director) that beg to be cut; if you're interested in the Nixon presidency the film may involve you, but its greatest achievement is merely to show how much Oliver Stone hurts his own work simply by being Oliver Stone.

777254,3,6304078110,"With ""Nixon"" director Oliver Stone aims for the next ""Citizen Kane,"" and he proves he's no Orson Welles.

It seems odd that a movie sequel can be more melodramatic than its antecedent of fifty years ago but that's exactly the case here, a case made definite by Stone's silly juvenile plagiarism of Kane's beginning. In ""Citizen Kane"" there's the ominous dark cavernous mansion that bespeaks of a life so grand yet ultimately so empty, followed by the rush of reporters in a newsroom determined to discover the secret of ""Rosewood."" ""Nixon"" begins with the Watergate burglars meeting and planning, and then transitions to the White House on a dark night overlaid with ominous music, and then finally to a defeated and alone Richard M. Nixon (Anthony Hopkins).

If Oliver Stone were to simply maintain this blatant plagiarism he would at worst be called a plagiarist, which is not really an offense in Hollywood or in life. Yet he trusts his intelligence and his taste and his instincts to create a powerful drama, and he shows that he lacks in all three.

Consider Richard Nixon's historic meeting with Chairman Mao, who looks and speaks like the devil. ""You are as evil as I am,"" Mao tells Nixon. The melodrama and implausibility of the scene aren't enough for Stone: he has to overlay the scene with Chinese calligraphy and screamingly annoying music.

In the beginning of the movie Mr. Stone has the courtesy to tell us that some scenes are redacted, shortened, or just dramatized from real life -- which is his most comic conceit because it's clear that MOST of the scenes have been imagined. Clearly Oliver Stone believes he is re-making ""Citizen Kane,"" and it is his duty to history to set the record straight once and for all about Nixon.

Thus, we should know that Richard Nixon was fundamentally an amoral man whose conscience was his saintly mother (Mary Steenburgen), and then his mother's surrogate and wife Pat (Joan Allen). Indeed Pat Nixon is the film's moral center of gravity, and it is when she finally in 1968 relents to Nixon's relentless political ambition that she loses her moral authority and Nixon fall aparts.

We should also know that Nixon's presidency was borne of the death of four people, and it was this that haunted Nixon and permitted him as president to sacrifice without remorse Cambodians, student demonstrators, and finally his own loyal White House staff. Tuberculosis killed Nixon's two brothers and permitted Nixon to attend law school, and Nixon's two deadliest political adversaries -- John and Robert Kennedy -- were conveniently assassinated.

In fact Nixon, as the film claims, may have been indirectly responsible for JFK's death by being as Eisenhower's vice-president chair of a secret committee that sanctioned the killing of world leaders sympathetic to communism. As the CIA's Jesse Helms (Sam Waterson) explains to Nixon in one of the film's most outrageously implausible and embarassing scenes, what they created was ""organic"" and ""had a life of its own"": no one could have predicted these same individuals they had unleashed to kill Castro would have come back to kill Kennedy -- but then again no one made Nixon attach his name to documents linking him to these murderers.

Stone tries to display different facets of Nixon's personality -- his outrageous paranoia, his self-hatred, his sexual insecurity and jealousy -- but what he best shows is Nixon's pettiness and shallowness and arrogance. And it may be because, despite Stone's professed high-brow cultural impact with his films ""Platoon,"" ""Wall Street,"" and ""Natural Born Killers,"" he is ultimately a petty and shallow and arrogant director. The film in its bloated morality and heavy-handedness treats movie-goers as children to be taught and admonished, as Nixon's mother once taught and admonished him and as Nixon taught and admonished the American people.

""Nixon"" is a very flawed film of a very flawed man, and shows a director who we once respected to be very flawed as well.",1257724800,3,3995,5.004518072289157
777255,2,6304078110,"It's a shame that Oliver Stone's inner demons are wasted on this 3 1/2 hour bloated mess. Very little of this movie is based on fact. It looks like it was written by every Democrat official and Hollywood activist who hated Nixon. Despite the movie's deadly length, there is very little here about Nixon's real accomplishments. Instead, it's one long hate-fest from the Democratic National Committee.

I recommend reading some books on Nixon to get a real picture of the man. Nixon did not ""invade"" Cambodia, the murderous North Vietnamese invaded that poor country first, and used it as a supply depot. He did not say ""C-sucker"" 6 trillion times a minute. Mrs. Nixon was not a dishrag. The story is about as accurate as the ""Futurama"" cartoon episode where Nixon's head goes on a robot rampage.

It is sad that those on the left are still rotting with hatred for the man. Can you imagine what a Republican film on President Obama would look like? Would it spend an hour documenting his failure in obtaining the Olympics for Chicago? No president deserves the hatchet job this movie presents. I guess we'll have to wait for Stone's next movie where Presidents Kennedy and Johnson are shown wiretapping DOMESTIC political enemies. Keep on waiting!",1255392000,9,1245,4.84037558685446
777256,4,6304078110,"The first hour of this film, after a brief introduction to set the basis of the storyline for the viewer, is a flashback that displays the depth of the subject of this film.  The rapid fire nature of the topics that are dealt with forces the viewer to piece together events on the fly, which I am sure was the case during these troubling times.
  The approach that Mr. Stone takes to this story telling should be considered an artistic interpretation of what these times really were.  The character development of Nixon shows a possible loss of contact with reality.
  In a subplot, this film also deals briefly with a familiar subject for Mr. Stone, the Vietnam War.",1245974400,3,667,4.610169491525424
777257,5,6304078110,"The Film:

Let me say right now by way of disclosure: I love Oliver Stone films. I don't think he's the ""conspiracy nut"" he's often painted as. I do think he is a biased historian. He has an ideological axe to grind, especially insofar as American politics are concerned. But it's easy enough to detect and set aside (if you want to), and nonetheless he is a stunningly talented filmmaker.

""Nixon"" presents probably the best of Stone's ""presidential"" films (JFK, Nixon, W.). It contains a spectacular performance by its principal character (Anthony Hopkins), and a great set of supporting players, as per usual in Stone's films (particular standouts include Bob Hoskins as J. Edgar Hoover, James Woods as Bob Haldeman, Paul Sorvino as Henry Kissinger, and Joan Allen as Pat Nixon). Hopkins does something amazing - without directly aping every little thing about Nixon, he portrays the inner Nixon so well that he ends up replacing the original in the mind of the viewer, to the point that when at the end Stone shows us the real Nixon's farewell helicopter ride, it is phenomenally bizarre to see someone else as Nixon.

Stone weaves a story of Nixon as a sympathetic, troubled, perennially downtrodden little guy who claws his way into power through tenacity, dirty tricks, perseverance, and canny manipulation of current events. Nixon is a man who has the highest aspirations of power, and is brought to the lowest possible point through his own frailties, paranoia, and personal demons. Stone at once makes him sympathetic and demonic.

I think Stone is a humanist, and a person who is seeking the truth. His humanism puts him at odds with those who would use mass populations as pawns and destroy vast populations for policy objectives - but it also drives him to seek what is human in these sorts of manipulators. He seeks to tell the truth - the human truth - of the events and the times he focuses on. He uses different kinds of footage, and compresses times and conversations, creating montages, almost collages, of images and words that evoke the spirit of a time.

""Nixon"" may well be Stone at his best in this art of collage film-making. It is utterly absorbing, despite its 3.5 hour heft, to anyone who enjoys deep character drama, and of course any political history aficionado.

The Blu-Ray:

At its best, this HD transfer presents images of amazing detail. Certain scenes show incredible facial detail, with pores, whiskers, fine lines, and the like shown in pristine clarity. But, as with many Stone film, detail is often obscured by intentional choices on his part - so many types of video sources are used, from 35mm to 8mm, TV broadcasts, all kinds of material with all different levels of inherent detail. This Blu-Ray displays them all probably as well as they'll ever be displayed. Whatever grain is inherent in the source image is always faithfully presented, never scrubbed away by excessive DNR. So, no, this is not a transfer you'll want to choose to really blow away a viewer with ""HD"" quality (try Stone's ""Alexander"" for that). But it's faithful, and as the film works on you for its 3.5 hours, I think  most viewers will appreciate it.

Audio is an uncompressed Dolby Digital 5.1ch mix. It does a fine job presenting the sometimes booming soundscape Stone employs with all of his complex cuts from dialogue scenes to documentary shots and pictures of war. Dialogue is never drowned out, and John Williams' score comes through very nicely.

Stone has recorded two commentaries for the film, one dealing with the movie-making end of things, one dealing with the political backdrop of the age. Both are entertaining, as per usual with Stone commentaries. Sometimes there are gaps (heh heh), but when he is speaking he is always lucid and informative.

The second disc has a wealth of extras. 58 minutes of deleted scenes (more like 30, when you cut out Stone's explanations and the contextual bits of the actual film) are presented in 480p. Most of them have been reintegrated into the director's cut on the main disc however. So this is more interesting for Stone's intro than anything else. A 35-minute HD documentary by Sean Stone is the new item here, collecting many big-wigs discussing the pros and cons of the film. An hour-long Charlie Rose interview with Stone presents a deep and occasionally tense conversation between a master interviewer and a master filmmaker. Overall, it's a pretty good slate of extras.

Helms and his agency are virtually said to be the devil. Flowers in Helms' office are shown to bloom and wilt in supernatural ways, presumably depending on Helms' evil whim. Waterston's eyes are shown to be coal black. He is Satan!
Nixon asks himself the rhetorical question, ""Whose helping us?"" while staring into a fireplace flame under a portrait of Kennedy. The theme is first brought forth in Nixon's college years, when his older brother dies, and apparently this frees up money through an unexplained source (an insurance policy?) that allows Nixon to go to law school. In light of two Kennedy assassinations, the answer to Nixon's question seems to be the same one that Mick Jagger gives in ""Sympathy for the Devil"".
""After all, it was you and me,"" Jagger sings, and Stone would have you believe it was the devil in silent concert with Nixon and his brand of...something. Jingoism, patriotism, xenophobia, bloodthirstiness? Nixon is seen on a couple of occasions shadowed by a devil-like winged creature (the beast), and his conversation with a female college student at the Lincoln Memorial ends with her identification of the beast as the controlling force in American politics. Presumably the girl is able to see this clearly because her heart is pure.
Stone invents secret cabals that never happened between Nixon and John Birch Texas businessmen, racist to the core, who along with a smirking Cuban are there to tell us that because Nixon was in Texas on November 22, 1963 he was somehow plotting JFK's murder.
The conspiracy link between ""JFK"" and ""Nixon"" exists in this reference, and the CIA ""tracks"" like the one Agent X talks about in ""JFK"", apparently tie Guatemala, Iran and the Bay of Pigs to subsequent events. The Bay of Pigs tie-in, led by E. Howard Hunt and his Cubans, Bernard Barker, Eugenio Martinez, et al, is real enough, but the assassination is one Stone insists is part of the same ""track."" Something on the list of ""horribles,"" which Nixon discusses with H.R. Haldeman (James Woods), who then talks about ""bodies,"" references to something I still have never figured out after watching the film 15 times. The Kennedy's bodies? Vietnam dead bodies?
Stone gives Watergate its due, but lets the actual events speak for themselves without embellishing it with more hate towards Nixon than that era produced of its own accord. He actually does a solid job of demonstrating the semi-legitimate reasons for creating the Plumbers in the first place, which was to plug leaks in light of Daniel Ellsberg's treacherous ""Pentagon Papers"" revelation, in concert with the bunker mentality caused by anti-war protesters threatening, in their mind at the time, a civil war like the one that forced Lincoln to declare martial law.
Stone also makes it clear that Nixon and his people were convinced that Kennedy stole the 1960 election, and he does not try to deny it (without advocating it, either). Murray Chotiner represents the realpolitik Republicans who, Stone wants us to know, pulled the same fraudulent tricks, when he says, ""They stole it fair and square.""
Nixon is depicted as foul-mouthed and quite the drinker. His salty language apparently was learned well into adulthood, and he did occasionally imbibe after years as a teetotaler, but his associates insist it was by no means a regular thing. Woods' Haldeman is no friend of the Hebrews, and Paul Sorvino, doing a big league Henry Kissinger, finds himself constantly at war with the inside Nixon team, put down for his Jewishness. Powers Boothe is a cold-blooded Alexander Haig, representing the reality of Watergate's final conclusion.
It never would have happened under J. Edgar Hoover, Nixon says, and Haig agrees that Hoover, who died just before Watergate, was a ""realist"" who would have kept it locked up. Nixon discusses suicide with Haig, who eases him out of that but never really tells him not to. When Nixon asks for any final suggestion, Haig says something the real man probably never said:
""You have the Army. Lincoln used it.""
Sure.
Nixon breaks down, incredulous that for all his accomplishments, he can be brought down by such a nothing event. Stone allows Hopkins to infuse this scene with Shakespearean irony. Stone gives Nixon his due in many ways. He demonstrates that he was utterly faithful to his wife, Pat, turning down a right wing lovely served up by the Birchers, while telling the girl that he entered politics to help people. His hardscrabble youth is nicely portrayed, with Mary Steenburgen playing his long-suffering Quaker mother. Young Nixon is utterly faithful to her and the honest, religious ethic of the family. But in a later scene, Steenburgen looks questioningly at his Presidential aspirations, saying he is destined to lead, but only if God is on his side. It is a telling statement playing to his theme that dark forces are the wind at Nixon's sails. He enters politics as an idealist, and becomes something else because he discovers he has the talent for it. He is industrious, in contrast to the Kennedys, and will earn everything he has simply by out-working everybody.
An entirely loving portrait of Dick Nixon would have no credibility. Stone does a great job with the movie, which is as balanced as it could be with a side of liberal righteousness.(...)",1233878400,4,5571,4.940298507462686

Right or wrong, his works are wonderful cinema, it doesn't matter if his version is slanted to the left, it is a distinct vision and he is skilled at executing it.

Though both are named for presidents of the same era, one is about a murder and it's associate conspiracies-presented in staggering detail, while the other is a psychological Greek-styled high drama of a hugely important personality, flawed and potent, crumbling and explosive.
Anthony Hopkins disappears into the role, and as these things usually do, a great actor and a great part/material make the best of art. Hopkins makes Nixon the uncomfortable, paranoid, awkward, occasionally warm, humorless titan I wonder that he was. Again, it doesn't matter if he is right. Such a secretive administration and time has to be interpreted when records are classified...sounds familiar doesn't it? Joan Allen is fantastic in a difficult, angry role and is the only source for bringing a sense of fraudulance, pity and heart to a man consumed by control and power, order and hubris. The supporting cast is pretty amazing too, Paul Sorvino's Henry Kissinger and E.G. Marshall's John Mitchell come to mind.

777294,5,6304078110,"Nixon was denounced by Nixon's daughters and the Disney family as an unfair portrayal of the only United States President ever to resign from office, but after watching the three plus hour epic, you are left feeling somewhat sympathetic to the man, and you have to give Nixon credit for his many accomplishments. Oliver Stone dedicated this film, and also Wall Street, to his father, Louis, a stock trader. Perhaps Oliver's father admired Nixon, so Stone wanted to give him his due. Oliver Stone always does seem to have his own not-so-hidden agenda, but if you take him with a grain of salt, you are left with a dramatic and compelling historical drama, a tragedy of epic proportions.
Anthony Hopkins gives a great performance as President Richard Milhous Nixon, capturing the essence of Nixon, his mannerisms and way of speaking, and he also manages to convey the conflicted emotions that tore him asunder. It was while watching Hopkins' conflicted character in The Remains of the Day that Stone decided to cast him as Nixon. While Hopkins doesn't even look like Nixon, nevertheless, he becomes him. The stellar cast boasts many familiar faces from other movies and television, but no matter how familiar they may be, they all manage a strange alchemy and become their characters. Oliver Stone not only manages to pull great performances from everyone, he also manages to put it all together, archival footage, special effects, flash backs, symbolism, in such a way that you are pulled into the narrative and time melts like the watches in a painting by Salvador Dali. Nixon is the cinematic version of a page turner.

Though it was a very long movie, there was still a lot of great footage that had to be left out. There is a great sequence that was included as bonus material where Nixon goes to meet with the Richard Helms (Sam Waterston), the head of the CIA. It is an excellent sequence, at one point Helms' eyes are totally black, with a special effect that would seem out of place in an historical picture, but Stone gets away with it because he is speaking in the language of images and dream symbolism. In spite of the flowers and poetry, Helms is only darkness reaching for more darkness.

===============================
Richard M. Nixon: Do ever think of death, Dick?
Richard Helms: Flowers are a continual reminder of our mortality. Do you appreciate flowers?
Richard M. Nixon: No, no they make me sick, and they smell like death. I had two brothers die young... Well let me tell you. There are worse things than death.
Richard Helms: Yes?
[special effects have turned his eyes completely black]
Richard M. Nixon: There's such a thing as evil.
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

By the way, the poem Helms recites is The Second Coming by William Butler Yeats, and Anthony Hopkins actually is related to Yeats: ""What rough beast, its hour come round at last, slouches towards Bethleham to be born?""

777295,5,6304078110,"Oliver Stone's Nixon was among the finest films of the nineties, and also among the most under appreciated. Anthony Hopkins cuts through the mystery of this complex man and captures his conflicted and wounded soul in a performance that earned him an Oscar nomination for best actor, and stands among his finest work. Both Stone and his actor are not interested in attacking Nixon, but rtather exploring his life for all its complexities and contradictions, and studying how a man could achieve so much and yet fall so hard? Almost Shakespearean in its tone, it is a stunner, with a mesmerizing performance from Joan Allen as ""Plastic Pat"" who knew better than anyone the flaws of the disgraced Presidnet. Though he resigned in a sea of scandal is it not interesting that every single US President to follow sought his advice in matters of foreign affairs? As he hoped, history has been kind to Richard Milhous Nixon, and so it should be.",1215388800,,937,4.790123456790123
777296,5,6304078110,"Amazon needs to change its movie review process. This is actually a review of the ""Election Year Edition"" that was released in 2008. I tried to enter a new review under that DVD release (after typing the entire thing, I was told that it was not allowed--only one review per item (I originally wrote a review of the ""Collector's Edition""--but there is now a different item/version--why can't I write another review about that version?! How absurd!)).

Anyway, the original release of ""Nixon"" was letterboxed--and with this newest 2008 release, this problem was corrected as the DVD now has a beautiful anamorphic widescreen format. The images are sharp and crisp and the colors are also perfect, also great sound.

This is another well-crafted masterpiece from Oliver Stone with an incredible performance by Anthony Hopkins in the title role. The 'R' rating is due to some profanity, which is hardly noticeable compared to other 'R' rated films.

I viewed this movie on a 46-inch Samsung high definition LCD TV, played on a Toshiba HD DVD player. This upgrade is worth replacing your old, letterboxed DVD version with the new anamorphic edition. ""Nixon"" is a movie that you will watch again and again.  Highly recommended!",1209686400,3,1221,5.02970297029703

The accents are pretty bad: Hopkins is a Scotchman playing a southern Californian. If you don't know your history very well, you'll be fooled and flummoxed by all this nonsense. If you do know history, then it's safe to watch this as pure entertainment, which, as such, isn't half bad. Stone's purely speculative connections about Nixon's youth and his role in the Bay of Pigs are just that, so beware. I had to watch it over three days: it's pretty long. But it's worth the time, as most any Stone film is. Just don't take it too seriously.",1208390400,,666,4.605042016806722
777298,3,6304078110,"While this film starts at a good dramatic clip, Stone tried to include too much in it for it to be a good movie-going experience, in my viewing.  Unfortunately, in an attempt to cover as much as he hopes, Stone falls back on apocryphal scenes that are purely fictional: not only do they pack too much into it, but they are so excessively full of message and symbolism that they completely ruin the drama.  For example, we see Nixon meeting with shady and mysterious extreme right-wing oil types in Texas, which so far as I know have little or no basis in fact; there, Nixon at turns makes corrupt deals or displays the arrogance of power.

Nixon was a fascinating character and was involved in enough for a long mini-series.  What Stone should have done was chosen one of his machinations or crises, to tell a good story.  Instead, he covers his entire presidency, showing headlines of extremely complex events such as the bombing of Cambodia, rushes Nixon in to meet the protesting students (a real event), and zooms in on many other specific scenes, most of which never occurred.  At least to me, it came off as a mishmash.

Hopkins is very good as is Joan Allen as Pat, but it just doesn't work.  I did enjoy many of the scenes, such as his praying with an uneasy Kissinger, I admit.  I just wish it were more focused.

Not recommended.",1207612800,3,1339,4.518672199170124
777299,4,6304078110,"An excellent, well crafted show which reveals the real Nixon.  Actor who played the part was one of the best.

777300,3,6304078110,"Even Oliver Stone admits that his ""historical"" films are very biased but Nixon is the most biased of them all.  Stone shows no balance in this film but implies many things that he could never support including that Nixon was knowledgable of both Kennedy assinations.  This is just irresponsible film making.

This extended film contains an extra 20 minutes (original running time 3:11 DVD running time 3:31).  Ten minutes are two consecutive scenes where Nixon is driving through protesters and making some remarks and acting rather childish followed by a meeting with the CIA director in which Stone accuses Nixon of a plethera of dirty deeds.  The rest are small scenes or estended scenes.  All are found on disc two.

Now for the good news.  This film contains two great performances.  Anthony Hopkins successful gives Nixon humanity in a film that does not want the character to be anything but evil.  Joan Allen also shines as Pat Nixon.  She is wasted for most of the film but when she is given any kind of scene she dominates it.  (My guess most of her work is on the floor because she is so sympathetic).  Also technically, the cinematography is superb.  The use of film and video almost creates an additional character.

Basically if you a looking for a historical film about this time, this is NOT the film to watch.  I would suggest, All the President's Men (a definite 5* film) or Nasty Habits (which will never be on DVD).

If you are looking for a master class in acting by Sir Anthony, this is is a great example (of course Remains of the Day is even better.) (He definitely should of won the Oscar for this film.)

If you want to see a great character actress show how to make a small role into something more than it was intended, Joan Allen shows why she received her first Oscar nomination.

777301,5,6304078110,"The ups and downs of an American President. The five stars are for the film as a film. I appreciate that, for many Americans, there's quite another side to the story. However, I have to say that I was fascinated by the film, and lost in stunned admiration for Hopkins's performance. The whole production was a dizzying ride, and I admit to being impressed. Who wrote this, I kept asking myself. Was this Stone's dialogue as well as direction? The theme seemed to be that Nixon's enigmatic character could be explained by his upbringing and his relationship with his parents. Caught out in a little lie, he felt compelled to confess. Did his mother forgive him? For a non-American, one of the most extraordinary features of the Nixon news story was the existence of those tapes: it seemed incredible that the man would actually arrange for incriminating evidence to be continually recorded, and that he would then ensure its preservation, when it could only lead to his certain downfall and destruction. This, it was argued, was his mother's doing. Other political figures make sure they cover up beyond detection.  Well, interesting, but impossible to prove. Were the childhood scenes complete invention, or is there some reliable biographical background to them?  I've got to the stage in life where I'm pretty well convinced that all politicians are crooks, and instinctively corrupt; ready to do anything to climb the greasy pole and sit on top of the heap. It's been called the art of the possible. It's not admirable: what people admire are those who attempt the art of the impossible, achieving success while staying straight. So it's not really acceptable to defend this movie as a real portrait of Nixon the man. It still convinces, in parts, as a picture of power politics. Surround yourself with sycophantic second-rate mediocrities. Submit to pressures which will gain you some advantage. Even taking the way Stone presents these aspects with a large dose of salt, it's still a stimulating ride.",1194825600,3,2006,4.967261904761905
777302,3,6304078110,"When I saw that Oliver Stone made a film about Nixon, I was expecting a replay of his wildly entertaining piece of junk ""JFK"", where all pretense of reality of discarded. That is not the case with this film although it could have done without all the surrealistic effects and Stone's favorite conspiracy theories about Kennedy's assassination. Instead, we see a fairly sympathetic portrayal of Nixon where his own insecurities and paranoia mix with the usual institutional inertia of the Federal bureaucracy combined with the contempt of the ""liberal elites"" who have great influence in the media and ""The Establishment"" to destroy him in the end, in spite of his major accomplishments as President.
Anthony Hopkins did a good job covering his British accent and showing Nixon's insincere smile and his sweaty phyical awkwardness combined with Nixon's seeming discomfort being in his own skin. Still, I think his performance left something to be desired in addition to him being ""too bulky"" for the role.
As I said, we are treated to Stone's ususal myths about JFK, for example that Kennedy ""didn't know anything"" about the assassination plots against Fidel Castro, which simply isn't true...Bobby Kennedy took a direct role in pushing these schemes forward. Stone's claim that the ""CIA was out of control"" during JFK's term is total nonsense.  We are shown the ""Texas Oilmen"" who supposedly control the US obliquely referring to getting rid of JFK and threatening Nixon himself if he didn't do what they want.  J Edgar Hoover is shown as a monster who seems to indicate that he knows about plans to get rid of Bobby Kennedy, with Stone forgetting that Hoover was a good friend of poppa Joe Kennedy and he put up with a lot of indiscretions from the Kennedy's including their womanizing and endangering national security with liaisons with women connected to the Mafia and East German intelligence organizations.  Hoover could have easily disposed of them by leaking information about these things, but he didn't.
The film shows Nixon's subordinates , particularly John Ehrlichman, as basically decent people who get swept up into Nixon's paranoid world which ends up destroying them as well.
What I find particularly interesting is Stone's portrayal of Nixon's youth and family. Nixon, unlike so many politicians seems to have been a devoted family man and did not womanize. Nixon's parents were straightforward, honest people who tried to inculcate their religious values on their sons. Unfortunately, it didn't seem to rub off on son Richard, although it has been stated that he couldn't look people in the eye, so maybe he was having guilt feelings for having to lie to so many people. Maybe his self-destructive behavior (keeping the tapes?) was some sort of self-inflicted punishment for betraying the values of his parents.",1194048000,,2830,5.094827586206897
777363,2,6304078110,"I gave this movie two stars because Oliver Stone is a brilliant filmmaker with a high level of talent, but I simply cannot understand why he had to be so dishonest about his subject. There was so much wrong with Richard Nixon that there is little justification for making things up. Anthony Hopkins, a magnificent actor, gave a superlative performance and played Nixon exactly the way the Director undoubtedly wanted him to--as a psychopathic, blithering, hard-drinking ape. This is totally unfortunate as he could have made an excellent work of art from this story. Many of the lines attributed to the principal players--like Sorvino's Kissinger saying that had Nixon been loved as a child things would have gone differently--are so fantastic as to boggle the mind. Nixon's relationship with his wife may have been one of the few things the man did right in his life, but Stone infuses their bond with total torment. Why he did these things I cannot fathom. I just finished a biography on the 37th President and his financial shenanigans alone would have been enough to base a movie on. The guy was a big-spending liberal, paranoid, and disloyal. In short, he was an embarrassment to both the right and the left. Why not simply tell the truth? That would be demeaning enough but what we have here is not a man but a total caricature of one. The depiction is so patently ridiculous that it cannot even effectively function as propaganda, as, to most sensible people, it is simply unbelievable.

777364,5,6304078110,"I never would have imagined that Anthony Hopkins could pull off a convincing Nixon, well color me surprised!  Both he and Joan Allen (playing Pat Nixon) deserved their Oscar nominations - Allen should have won!

Oliver Stone is polarizing, not always honest in his portrayals and always out to bite the bullet in some capacity, but he's a great filmmaker.  The fictional aspect of JFK hurt the film, mostly because Stone presented them as truth's.  But the question of truth behind his portrayal of Nixon adds to the film, Nixon's presidency and Nixon himself is already a work of fiction that historians are still trying to figure out.  But Stone focuses more on the downfall of Nixon as a man rather than the politics that came with the man.

footage in Nixon has been mainly culled from the deleted scenes.

What do the characters who produced this dvd do? They simply tagged

on these scenes where they belong in the theatrical version of

the film, but the quality of this extra tagged footage makes the

777367,5,6304078110,"American history has seen both its high and low moments,and one of the lowest moments in history has proven itself to be,by far,the Watergate scandal. A scandal that lessened people's respect of Richard Nixon and continues to fascinate history fanatics to this day,one would hope to see more information made about the scandal--something that director Oliver Stone pulls of well with this film.

What you have here is pretty much a detailed biography and memoir of not only the Watergate scandal,but also of the life of Richard Nixon. You receive full and interesting detail about Richard Nixon's childhood out in Southern California and how both the good and bad parts of Nixon's childhood shaped Nixon as both a person and a President. Also,alongside a well-constructive (as well as accurate view)of Nixon's loss in the 1960 Presidential election to John F. Kennedy and his loss of the 1962 California Gubernatorial election to Edmund Brown,and what caused both defeats for Nixon and how the defeats,in a way,made a negative effect on Nixon's life (good and interesting detail are given throughout these scenes,and do a good job at showing what really happened in both campaigns without a theory,something that Oliver Stone used for the John F. Kennedy assasination in the movie ""JFK""). However,the real scene stealers for the Nixon biography in this film are the scenes with Anthony Hopkins and Joan Allen,with Hopkins as Richard Nixon and Allen as Patricia Nixon. If you go into this movie knowing anything about the life of Richard Nixon,you will notice that these scenes are not only accurate in how the relationship of Mr. and Mrs. Nixon is shown here and what it was that lead to the low parts of the marriage of Mr. and Mrs. Nixon. But,what really brings the movie to life in these scenes are Anthony Hopkins and Joan Allen. Here,Hopkins and Allen use their dramatic talents as actors in a richly executed manner that represents both Mr. and Mrs. Nixon very well. Hopkins looking and sounding like Mr. Nixon and pretty much the same thing going with Allen for Mrs. Nixon,alongside how Hopkins brings emotion into his character of Nixon when the script calls for Nixon going into how important his political career is and not wanting to give it up (something that most Nixon biographies claim about Nixon)and Allen bringing emotion into her portrayal as Mrs. Nixon by making her husband aware of how much she had sacrificed for him to have a good and successful political career (something that Mrs. Nixon did talk about openly in public from her rise to fame and before she stopped making public appearances). These scenes are resourceful by not only including important details in the life of Richard Nixon for this movie,but also in showing who Mr. and Mrs. Nixon really were and answering questions to the people who have wondered what happened to the marriage of Mr. and Mrs. Nixon during the most crucial parts in Mr. Nixon's life through politics (his years as Vice President and President,his run for the Presidency in 1960 and Governor of California in 1962,as well as the discovery that Nixon had been involved in the Watergate scandal).

Oliver Stone also does a really strong job at covering the entire Presidency of Richard Nixon. Here,with these scenes,you are given an honest and straightforward (not too confusing either;something that is unusual for an Oliver Stone picture)description of the Nixon
administration. It is nice to see how and when Richard Nixon ended the Vietnam War and how Nixon gave America a good foreign affairs policy,which was carried by Nixon's Chinia visit and held well by this film's detail and description of the visit that Nixon made to China (glad to see that those two important and successful parts of the Nixon administration were included here,considering the fact that most people do not remember Richard Nixon for his accomplishments as President,and that it was Watergate that ruined Nixon's Presidency and hurt Nixon's reputation as both a President and as a person). The Watergate burglary is depicted with several scenes and footage being used in this movie and showing the events in order,allowing the viewers of this film who want a good understanding of Watergate a good understanding of not only the scandal itself,but also all of the suspicious activities that came from the Nixon White House before it was discovered that Nixon had been involved in the scandal,the information that had been given to Nixon about his future because of his role in the scandal and the scandal itself which both resulted in Nixon's decision to resign,and a very intense,dramtic,and brilliant showing of what Nixon was like because of the scandal and his regrettal for being involved with it,before the movie ends with good ""shortly after"" information and a good tribute to Richard Nixon himself,as well.

If you are a history buff fascinated with the Watergate scandal and have always wanted to know the full detail on it,""Nixon"" is the place to be. This film does a good job at being a straightforward,honest,and great film with not only all of the information anyone who watches this film would want to know about both Richard Nixon and the Watergate scandal,but is also lead by talented and experienced direction,along with superb acting and a good cast of supporting actors acting alongside Anthony Hopkins and Joan Allen (Ed Harris,David Hyde Piece,Mary Steenburgen,plus several others),make ""Nixon"" highly informal and entertaining,one of the best history based films to be made,and,of course,a must see film.",1169251200,,5565,5.059912854030501

777372,5,6304078110,"I saw this movie on HBO two years ago and later decided that I just had to have it! I had applied for VA Benefits for disabilty in 1993. Strangers would walk up to me in public and would threaten to have me committed for doing my application. In the summer of 1993 in July I had a dream suggesting that Richard Nixon was scaring me. He then died in the fall of that year.
I found several things interesting in this movie. First, that Nion had described the military-industrial complex as a 'BEAST' that could not be restrained. Either Nixon or Oliver Stone understood Apocalyptic prophecy and Revelation 13 because America is a good candidate for the second beast of Revelation 13 which would dominate the world militarily.
Then I noticed how Nixon like Johnson had viewed the assasination of the two Kennedies as bodies which they had walked over on their way to the White House. God has caused tragedies to some of my political enemies, but I am not a politician, nor do I have any political ambitions in life. All I did was apply for the Federal Civil Service in Graduate School.
I was also amused that Oliver Stone showed J Edgar Hoover of the FBI as a queer trying to pick up his host's pool boy. Maybe this is some sort of unwritten tradition in the FBI and CIA-and that is why they tried to make a queer out of me in graduate school. I had read about the Hoover Biography in the WASHINGTON POST NATIONAL WEEKLY EDITION. He was also a transvestite and used to masturate as people read the Bible to him. What an evil, twisted man, too. I guess those self-righteous Establishment types are like that, eh?
Nixon did have a strict religious upbringing and then he turned evil with his ambitions. And Oliver Stone had cited the words of Jesus Christ at the beginning of this movie ""What does it profit a man if he gains the whole world; yet loses his own soul."" Nixon in the White House had believed that he had stepped over the dead bodies of four men to get into the White House-his two brothers and two dead Kennedies. He believed that God kills people for a reason. I had just written to Insight for Living expressing a similar view on why my enemies seem to die, and they wrote me back calling me insane. Was Chuck Swindol buddies with Nixon? I know that all the Watergate crooks all try to sanitize their reputations with religion. The calendar in my dream in 1993 was an INSIGHT FOR LIVING calendar with the words THE DARK DAYS OF RICHARD NIXON written on it. I also discovered that Nixon's family name was German like mine!",1152403200,2,2532,4.435622317596566
777416,5,6304078110,"I found this quote most interesting about the movie:

""Oliver Stone, as in JFK, takes certain liberties with Nixon's story and acknowledges as much in a disclaimer before the story begins. Even those who believe President Kennedy was assassinated as the result of a conspiracy, for example, would find it hard to believe that Richard Nixon was involved, even tacitly, in the plot to kill JFK. Stone also takes liberties with his portrayal of Richard and Pat Nixon's marital relationship. Even though some incidents are no doubt true, it's pretty clear that some scenes between the two are conjecture on Stone's part.""

Hopkins as Nixon sweats his way all the way through this one.  What a corrupt and dishonest administration Stone lets us see first hand.  It's scary how corrupt an admistration can be.  It just kept getting worse and worse for RMN.  The worse it got, the more it appears he tried to lie to get himself out of things.  It was interesting to see Haldeman and Erlichman and how they were portrayed as team players, quickly demonizing John Dean when they found out he was an independent thinker.  Nixon tried to intimidate Dean with his power, but in the end it didn't work.  Politics can be very dirty, and it makes one sad that politics cannot be more clean and honest and most importantly, straight-forward with the American people.

It was also interesting to see how horrible Nixon's marriage was and how obsessed he was with politics while ignoring his family.",1149292800,,1481,4.818181818181818

His performance however, was outstandinding. I'm not a Republican nor am I a Democrat. Regardless as to what one is, it is sad to see how Nixon went down. He was truly a humiliated and tormented man. Several of his cabinet members were fired or resigned. He mentioned to Henry Kissenger the fact that he was his only friend.  He was reduced to dancing to the tune of unsavory characters. He was not capable of maintaining the dignity that his position required. But with all said the movie is one that I will add to my collection. I did not know that it exisited until I saw it on t.v.

777419,2,6304078110,"That English actor as Dick Nixon?  Get outta here!  How about 60s comedian David Frye or someone without a trace of an English accent and a feel for Nixon's unique personality and style.  Hopkins' performance, with all due respect to this fine actor, in this case just does not present a believable characterization of ""Tricky Dick"".  While this passes with JQ Adams, Nixon is too recent and well known of an historical figure, one with a too pedestrian of an American plebian style to be credibly captured as someone cut from the cloth of a British patrician; indeed contemporary American politicians, to the extent that they don't embody this, conciously cultivate a ""low caste"" style as part of the political persona they market to the masses.  This, of course, is part of the ""race to the bottom"" in America's increasingly polarized political scene.",1135296000,2,853,4.937062937062937
777420,4,6304078110,"Nixon is arguably the best of Oliver Stone's films, as far as historical accuracy goes.  The movie still bears the hallmark of Stone's Kennedy assassination paranoia, but it does not negatively affect the movie as a whole.  While JFK was about Jim Garrison, ""Nixon"" is about Nixon.  This is a complex film, and it is not really made for an audience that does not have a good grasp of history.  After viewing the movie a couple times, I would suggest the viewer read the annotated screenplay which goes a long way in establishing the veracity of some of the more dubious assertions in the film.  Many have complained that this movie is just a mere compilation of Richard Nixon's greatest hits.  Here, we have the ""Checker's Speech"", ""You Won't Have Nixon to Kick Around Anymore"", ""The Smoking Gun"", and ""The Trip to China.""  The made for TV movie Truman however is more representative of this kind of `greatest hits' docudrama.  In ""Nixon"", we see the psychological struggles behind the great events.  Thus, right before the great ""Silent Majority"" speech we see a poignant flashback sequence going back to the young Nixon in California.  For viewers that thought a Catholic guilt-trip was bad, imagine a Quaker guilt-trip.  This intense feeling of guilt of letting his mother down was what may have driven Nixon.  Therefore, on one level, the movie is about the events swirling around Nixon in the 50's, 60's and 70's, but on another level, it is really about what motivates a man, and how that motivation can lead to a downfall.  Stephen Ambrose has quoted President Eisenhower as referring to Nixon as: ""I don't know how a man can go through life with no friends.""  Stone's Nixon maintained an innocuous relationship with his wife Pat.  In one of the key scenes early on in the movie after Nixon's defeat to Pat Brown in 1962, Nixon shows affection to Pat, but only after she talks about a divorce.  One wonders if this is a true sign of affection towards Pat or if its just another cold calculated Nixonian movie.  However, Stone's Nixon is NOT evil!  He began his career in law and politics with the best of intentions and as he fights back the storm of Watergate, he remains steadfast in the belief that his mother would expect nothing less of him.  Driven by his compelling need to please his mother, he begins mentally justifying his dirty tricks to achieve what he thinks is for the greater good.  As Nixon walks to the helicopter on the final day, one wonders if the look in his eyes signals regret or just more insistence that what he did was right.",1131840000,5,2559,4.669642857142857
777421,4,6304078110,"This technically superior film begins with a caveat that the portrayal of Nixon is interpretative. Even given that, though, the acting is so fine one finds oneself slipping into the assumptions of the movie. No doubt much of the Anthony Hopkins' portrayal of Richard Nixon is historical. But here's the rub: we don't really know where history ends and interpretation begins. For example, we know Nixon suffered bouts of paranoia and even perhaps mental illness, but we don't know if Hopkins went too far. He so magnificently fills the role of Nixon we tend to forget this may not have been the actual Nixon. Same thing with Oliver Stone's twist on history. For example, in the movie itself, and more explicitly in his director's commentary (there are two different tracks), he strongly implies that Kissinger was the main leak. We now know, however, that Mark Felt was ""Deep Throat,"" not Kissinger. Yet, Stone in his commentary says it almost definitively, and the movie we watch reflects his opinion-portrayed-as-fact.

On one hand, this does not detract from the magnificent achievement that this movie is. It's incredibly well-made and multi-layered. However, the line between interpretation and history is so blurred, in so many ways, the high marks we give it for its artistic achievement cannot help but be qualified by the iffyness of its interpretiveness.

This, I believe, can best be illustrated by one of the peculiar gimmicks Stone employs. And I couldn't figure it out the first couple of times I saw the movie. He mixes black-and-white footage with color. This makes sense when he uses stock footage -- e.g. a clip of Lenin or a flashback to the Alger Hiss proceedings. It makes no sense, at least at first, to switch between b-w and color, in numerous scenes throughout the movie, that are not flashbacks. Why, for instance, switch from b-w to color and back to b-w while Nixon is talking with J Edgar Hoover or Haldeman? It's not a flashback. Then it struck me. This is the expression, whether conscious or not, of Oliver's attempt to balance interpretation and history. It's as if the b-w parts represent raw history and then the color parts represent interpretation. So the scene with Hoover that fluctuates between b-w and color is Stone's artistic way of saying: history-interpretation, interpretation-history; we don't know where one starts and the other stops. It's a mixture. This is both the beauty and the beastliness of the movie.

Stone's commentary is good, not great but good, and enlightening. I would have really liked to have heard a running commentary, however, by a real historian, or someone with a political bent different from Stone's. Maybe someone like Stephen Ambrose, who write the definitive biography of Nixon. That would have made this more than a movie, but a visual document of historical worth.

Still, a worthwhile movie to see and see again. Just not quite a fiver.",1118275200,7,2914,4.97741273100616
777422,5,6304078110,"This may indeed be Oliver Stone's masterpiece, although as one would expect from Oliver Stone, it is a flawed and disjointed masterpiece, a monumental tragedy in the cathartic mode of the ancient Greeks.  There is an Orson Welles/Citizen Kane quality about the film that is fascinating, including a journalistic/newsreel-ish feel that is unmistakably derivative.  But it isn't really about Richard Nixon.  Rather what Oliver Stone has constructed here is a mythology about a certain political persona that resembles Nixon in a milieu that resembles American politics and some things that happened once upon a time some thirty years ago.

Anthony Hopkins is brilliant and compelling in the title role, but in no way would I mistake him for Richard Milhous Nixon.  He is both too depraved and all too human in his intense portrayal of the only president to resign under the pressure of impeachment.  The Richard Nixon that I recall played his cards much closer to his vest (he was a terrific poker player, according to his naval buddies who lost a lot of their mustering out money to him aboard ship) and was not nearly as sympathetic as Hopkins and Stone make him.  Nixon was cold and unfeeling except when it came to something that touched on his self-interest, and then he became pathological.

One sees in this film traces of Oliver Stone's JFK (1991) in that he hints of a Cuban plot to kill John F. Kennedy while imagining that Lee Harvey Oswald was Cuban-inspired.  Indeed, Stone intimates that J. Edgar Hoover was somehow involved in the assassination of Robert Kennedy in 1968 partly because he wanted to insure Nixon's victory by eliminating the one person who could beat him, and partly because his experience with Robert Kennedy as Attorney General was not a pleasant one for Hoover.

Conspiracy was in the air in those days, and many Americans took it as gospel that FBI director J. Edgar Hoover was a player in those assassinations.  And of course it is always wise to ask who benefits from certain events, and there is no doubt that Nixon would have had a lot more trouble beating Robert Kennedy in 1968 than he had in beating George McGovern.  And Bobby Kennedy as president would have been a nightmare for the corrupt J. Edgar Hoover and his fiefdom.

But Oliver Stone is not really interested in actual history as much as he is in his vision of the tortured Nixon himself and his fall from grace.  It is strange but although Hopkins did not really look like Nixon or behave like Nixon (although he had some of the mannerisms down pat) it didn't matter because somehow he became a Nixon-like personage, a kind of ghost of Nixon, perhaps, a Nixon truer than true in some ways with his ever present worry about his image and his obsession with the Kennedy glamour that he could never have, his ""Republican cloth-coat"" middle-class heritage, and his gift for political infighting.

One of the best scenes occurs under the Lincoln memorial as Nixon is confronted by some Vietnam War protestors and especially one 19-year-old girl who challenges his view of his responsibility and ultimately of himself.  What Stone is able to do through such scenes is to make Anthony Hopkins's Nixon more sympathetic than the real Nixon ever was.  We see Hopkins as a tortured Shakespearean protagonist, King Lear or Othello or Hamlet, souls tormented with the contrast between the grandeur of their station, and the weakness of their flesh.

Another great scene is when the Texas power broker threatens Nixon by reminding him ""who made him"" and ""who can destroy him.""  Nixon is unperturbed as he counter-threatens the power broker with the holy terror of the IRS, and then smiles as though it is just another day at the office.

A third great scene is late in the film as a drunken Pat Nixon confronts Nixon, who is falling apart under the pressure of the Watergate investigation, her eyes the eyes of woman looking at a worm, her manner accusatory and venomous.

In the end we come to identify with Nixon as we did with Lear and Hamlet, although of course Nixon properly seen is more like Claudius.

The cast is eclectic and you really need a program to keep track of them.  Although I recall the players from the Nixon years, Haldeman, Erhlichman, Henry Kissinger, John Dean, Al Haig, Attorney General John Mitchell and his bimbo wife Martha (burlesqued in a fine cameo by Madeline Kahn), and the rest of them, I couldn't form distinct persons in my mind.  The actors themselves are top notch for the most part, James Woods, J. T. Walsh, Paul Sorvino, Ed Harris, E.G. Marshall, etc., but the real world contrast between their countenances and those of the historical figures was so glaring as to be almost comical at times.

Of course there was no getting around this. Stone had to either hire unknown actors or to just live with the unreality of the actors not really resembling the people they were portraying.  There were some striking exceptions, however.  Joan Allen as Pat Nixon, the president's straight-laced and ever loyal (in public) wife was something close to a dead-ringer, and Allen did a brilliant job of bringing the historical first lady to life.  Sorvino did not look all that much like Henry Kissinger, but his voice and manner were absolutely perfect.  David Barry Gray who played Nixon as a young man did indeed look a lot like the young Nixon.  Corey Carrier who played him as a boy was much like I would imagine Nixon as a boy.

Also worth noting are Mary Steenburgen who played Nixon's mother, and Bob Hoskins who played J. Edgar Hoover.  Steenburgen seemed the very embodiment of the wise and hardtack Quaker mother while Hoskins's sleazy lampoon of Hoover was creepy enough to make your skin crawl.",1112659200,25,5722,4.783536585365853
777423,4,6304078110,"once again Stone manages to get an Excellent Cast, a decent script to manage to tell the Biography of Nixon. Joan Allen does resemble the real Pat Nixon.  he delves into controversy like the legendary 18 1/2 minute gap suggesting that the Kennedy Assassination was included in the missing gap. even some of the Watergate people contributed to the movie. E. Howard Hunt although not credited, contributed as well. just to remind you this movie is ""fiction"" or ""faction"" as its called nowadays so Stone took some liberties and condensed a few events and people to tell the Nixon saga.",1110931200,3,582,4.82

Oliver Stone's least developed and most incoherent film, Nixon was a potentially great film gone wrong. Coming after the masterful JFK and other excellent Stone movies like Talk Radio and Platoon, Nixon by comparison looks rushed, sometimes self-indulgent, and not entirely coherent. The biggest flaws are probably the chronological skipping around the film does, and the repeated intrusive injection of disturbing images at various times. As a result, there is too much of a stream of consciousness feel to this movie. Anthony Hopkins as Nixon sometimes does a great job, while other times he overacts, and seems not so much like Nixon but like a comedian making fun of Nixon. Events and names are run past the viewer without explaining them or providing much backstory; this might make this movie difficult viewing for somebody not already familiar with Watergate.",1109980800,10,1129,4.962962962962963

777476,4,6304078110,"President Richard Nixon was known for mostly negative things, like the war in Vietnam, the economic crisis at home, and most importantly, the Watergate scandal that brought him down. This movie, directed by Oliver Stone, attempts to summarize some of the key events in Nixon's early life and presidency into one long film.

Stone's portrayal of Nixon is more balanced and more sympathetic than I expected it to be. It is known that Stone is no fan of conservative policies and when I first watched this film I expected Stone to bash the former president left and right, giving him no credit for some of his accomplishments and complete and total blame for his failures. But Stone actually treats Nixon fairly, and when you finish watching the movie, you feel a little bit of empathy for the former president.

Anthony Hopkins is cast in the role as Nixon, and he is quite good, as are most of his co- stars, particularly those who play his wife, Pat, and his secretary of state, Henry Kissinger. Hopkins may not look much like Nixon in reality, but the makeup people did a good job getting his facial expressions, hair, and crows feet to resemble the thirty- seventh president. And Hopkins performs very well when he mimics Nixon's mannerisms and voice. This is quite an accomplishment for a man with a British accent.

Nixon isn't good enough to rank as a five- star film, but it is still very good and entertaining. It is not one- hundred percent historically accurate, and there are some scenes where Stone adds own assumptions about Nixon and his personality. But since this isn't an official documentary, I don't blame the director for adding his own take on things. And besides, the majority of the film is pretty accurate and it keeps your attention even during the slower parts.

Nixon, the man, wasn't perfect and neither is this film. But ""Nixon"" is still a good flick and it's the type of movie that people 40 years of age and older will really enjoy as they relive the tense moments during the Nixon presidency. The Vietnam War, the Arab oil embargo, and the Watergate scandal that caused the first and only resignation in U.S. presidential history are all part of the Nixon legacy, and this movie brings them all back to life for viewers to reminisce and debate.",1103241600,3,2275,4.708542713567839
777477,5,6304078110,"This was a very well done look at one of America's most important presidents. Oliver stone aviods taking sides (for the most part) and offers a film that focuses on the Whys, rather than the unfortunate events themselves.

Suprisingly though, this kind of political biography has a very limited audience. many people will expect a fahrenheit 9/11, but get something alot closer to the godfather. Even among those with historical knolwedge, it seems like most completely misunderstand the film and the man (judging partially from the other reviews here). like it is said in the movie ""we never really knew who Richard Nixon was.""",1102118400,2,628,5.038461538461538
777478,4,6304078110,"Oliver Stone's ""Nixon"" isn't really the cinematic biography of American Commander-in-Chief and Paranoid Extraordinaire Richard M. Nixon, but more like a latter day ""Richard III"". Stone need only have given the ogrish Nixon (played fascinating and disturbingly by the gifted Anthony Hopkins) a hunchback and had him kill a few kids in the Tower of London to have completed the deal.

I am a big Nixon fan, if only for his strangeness, for his political eccentricity in a political system where only the bland, the smiling, the sound-biteable, the contempibly predictable is rewarded. Nixon, to me, has always seemed like an anachronistic creation of pure will, a force of random Brownian motion, a misunderstood Machiavellian demon, hopelessly paranoid, unmistakably brilliant, brutally deformed, unequivocally human, a misshapen creature.

Stone turns that on its head, and suggests that at worst Nixon may just have been naive. Driven, yes. Ambitious, yes. Duplicitous, only when it suited him. But naive. And that, truly, is the fascination with this lavish little probe into the mind and madness that was Richard Nixon, and the insanity that was the America he helmed. Oliver Stone's ""Nixon"" is flawed, oddly talky, features an impossibly gorgeous Joan Allen as the impossibly dowdy Pat Nixon. But with all that against it, it is compulsive. It is fascinating. It kept me up all night, for all 212 of its minutes (get the Director's cut). Can more be said?

Perhaps. Stone, who helmed ""Natural Born Killers"" and ""Wall Street"" and ""JFK"", is incapable of making a bad moviek, and ""Nixon"" is no exception. But like those other cinematic feats, Stone has a peculiar knack for glorifying his monsters: ""Wall Street"" became nothing so much as a Wall Street investment banking recruiting video for finance neophytes frothing at the mouth to become the next Gordon Gekko. ""Natural Born Killers"" made mass murder look sexy.

Same with ""Nixon"": far from a gnomish American Machiavelli, Nixon comes across as a sympathetic dupe, manipulated by his Quaker California youth, by his hopeless class insecurity, by the very real fear and lack of confidence made manifest in this sweating middle class creature, contrasted unseemingly with the sweatless WASP Prince John F. Kennedy.

""Nixon"", then, is surprisingly sympathetic, a toxic stew of Nixon's paranoia and the insanity over which he ruled. Stone is a brilliant director, but he is capable of terrible stuff: here an editor is called for, and the team of Brian Berdan (""Mothman Prophecies"") and Hank Corwin (""Natural Born Killers"") cull the bad stuff while emphasizing the good. Director of Photography Robert Richardson, who loves MTV-quick cuts juxtaposed with ethereal, epic, jaw-dropping long shots (he has rolled out all of Stone's work---all of it!---""Natural Born Killers"", ""JFK"", ""Wall Street"", ""Platoon""---and gone on to helm both ""Kill Bill"" flicks as well as ""Wag the Dog"" and the lush Victorian ""Four Feathers"") does that voodoo he does so well.

Frankly, though, ""Nixon"" is an actor's movie. The acting is nearly uniformly superb, with the exception of Joan Allen (Pat Nixon, Nixon's dearly beloved), who was yummy to behold but totally failed the sniff test. Anthony Hopkins doesn't look a thing like Tricky Dick, but totally owns the movie and compels respect: and what a complicated role! James Woods does his thing as Haldeman, sneering and brooding the whole time. The late great J.T. Walsh brings up the rear as the crafty Erlichmann. David Hyde Pierce is nervous and spot-on as John Dean, though John Diehl is underwhelming as the legendary GG Liddy.

But again, this is an actor's Nirvana: Paul Sorvino as Kissinger (pure caricature)! Bob Hoskins as the cruel J. Edgar Hoover! Ed Harris as the murderous Howard Hunt! Uber-liberal Sam Waterston as the truly demonic (I mean truly demonic) Richard Helms (love the contacts, bro!). And best of all, the inimitable, tightly contained Powers Boothe as Alexander Haig, always in ""charge here"", always ready to blow. Did I mention the score is by John Williams? I didn't? It works (duh!).

""Nixon"" is one of Stone's masterworks, easily rivalling ""JFK"" for pure consumptive paranoid entertainment. Absolute power may not corrupt absolutely, but it sure does entertain---absolutely.",1101686400,18,4288,5.213352685050798
777479,3,6304078110,"Like most of Oliver Stone's work, ""Nixon"" is full of conspiracy theories and ho-hum, lavish production values, overlong and quite winded.  The casting of Hopkins as Nixon is puzzling, but interesting.  Suprisingly he is believable.  The big star here is Joan Allen as Pat Nixon.  She looks, sounds, acts, breaths, eats, and drinks Pat Nixon.  A well deserved oscar nomination (actually she should have won-I've never seen such a dead on performance).  Like ""JFK,"" this film features an all-star cast (ala Love Boat).  Characters fall in and out all the time, making it hard to follow at times.  Filmed and shown before Nixon's death, I would like Stone to 'revisit' this subject matter now to see if anything changes.  But wait!  That would be something George Lucas would do, and he's NO George Lucas.  May the conspiracies be with you always, Oliver.  Maybe his next project should be a remake of ""Fahrenheit 9/11.""  But, wait, they're aren't enough consipracies in that subject matter, are they?  Nice effort.  It's like a pretty package-well wrapped, but very little inside.",1101513600,,1078,5.011299435028248
777480,5,6304078110,"When Anthony Hopkins was cast as Richard Nixon in Oliver Stone's bio of the 37th President, many were leery of the casting choice. I myself pictured Hopkins doing a combination of Nixon and Hannibal Lecter: ""I'm not a crook -- and if anyone thinks so, I'll eat their liver with some fava beans and a nice chianti .... SLURP!!"" However, Hopkins does do a marvelous job and disappears into the role without becoming a standup comedian's caricature. Even though Nixon does and says vile things throughout the film, the audience still has sympathy for the character -- even those like me who found the real Richard Nixon dispicable.

Stone portrays Nixon as a tragic figure who had the intelligence and the electoral mandate to elevate himself and his administration to greatness, but let it all slip away by becoming bogged down in the quagmire of Watergate. Nixon complains incessantly about how the Kennedys are everything he is not. However, it becomes clear that his hatred of the Kennedys is based as much on his loathing of himself as on any real scorn shown him by the ""Eastern establishment.""

Stone, as in JFK, takes certain liberties with Nixon's story and acknowledges as much in a disclaimer before the story begins. Even those who believe President Kennedy was assassinated as the result of a conspiracy, for example, would find it hard to believe that Richard Nixon was involved, even tacitly, in the plot to kill JFK. Stone also takes liberties with his portrayal of Richard and Pat Nixon's marital relationship. Even though some incidents are no doubt true, it's pretty clear that some scenes between the two are conjecture on Stone's part.

However, these are minor quibbles. Nixon is a penetrating, engrossing biography that both portrays him as a ruthless, vicous, paranoic lunatic and a character who elicits sympathy from the audience. The supporting cast is amazing and includes James Woods, Mary Steenburgen, Ed Harris, David Hyde Pierce, Annabeth Gish, Kevin Dunn, J.T. Walsh, Powers Booth, Paul Sorvino, Edward Herrmann, Larry Hagman, Dan Hedeya, Tony LoBianco, Bob Hoskins, E.G. Marshall, David Paymer, Tony Goldwyn, Fuyvush Finkel and Saul Rubinek. However, the standout supporting player is Joan Allen as Pat Nixon who is a dead ringer for the former First Lady. Allen's portrayal shows the emotional pain Mrs. Nixon endured behind the seemingly placid facade she presented to the American public. Coupled with Hopkins' Nixon, it's an acting tour de force that carries the film.

After all the vile things he does during the course of the film, Nixon, the night before his resignation, is reduced to staring at a portrait of his idolized archenemy John F. Kennedy and proclaiming that ""... when they look at you, they see what they want to be. When they look at me, they see what they are."" Even the most die-hard member of Nixon's enemies' list can't help but feel pity for Richard Nixon during this scene. It's a great achievement by Oliver Stone to make this bitter, corrupt and wretched man worthy of the audience's sympathy at the same time we disdain him.",1099872000,89,3086,4.9517374517374515
777481,5,6304078110,Outstanding performance by Hopkins.  He is what made this picture.  Stone's conspiracy theory begins to wear a bit thin.,1093564800,2,120,5.2631578947368425
777482,5,6304078110,"He infers that the beast is embodied in the Central Intelligence Agency, which in turn controls the U.S. A sequence showing Nixon visiting CIA Director Richard Helms (Sam Waterston) was mostly cut out of the original film, but the video shows it in its entirety at the end of the movie. Helms and his agency are virtually said to be the devil. Flowers in Helms' office are shown to bloom and wilt in supernatural ways, presumably depending on Helms' evil whim. Waterston's eyes are shown to be coal black. He is Satan!
Nixon asks himself the rhetorical question, ""Whose helping us?"" while staring into a fireplace flame under a portrait of Kennedy. The theme is first brought forth in Nixon's college years, when his older brother dies, and apparently this frees up money through an unexplained source (an insurance policy?) that allows Nixon to go to law school. In light of two Kennedy assassinations, the answer to Nixon's question seems to be the same one that Mick Jagger gives in ""Sympathy for the Devil"".
""After all, it was you and me,"" Jagger sings, and Stone would have you believe it was the devil in silent concert with Nixon and his brand of...something. Jingoism, patriotism, xenophobia, bloodthirstiness? Nixon is seen on a couple of occasions shadowed by a devil-like winged creature (the beast), and his conversation with a female college student at the Lincoln Memorial ends with her identification of the beast as the controlling force in American politics. Presumably the girl is able to see this clearly because her heart is pure.
Stone invents secret cabals that never happened between Nixon and John Birch Texas businessmen, racist to the core, who along with a smirking Cuban are there to tell us that because Nixon was in Texas on November 22, 1963 he was somehow plotting JFK's murder.
The conspiracy link between ""JFK"" and ""Nixon"" exists in this reference, and the CIA ""tracks"" like the one Agent X talks about in ""JFK"", apparently tie Guatemala, Iran and the Bay of Pigs to subsequent events. The Bay of Pigs tie-in, led by E. Howard Hunt and his Cubans, Bernard Barker, Eugenio Martinez, et al, is real enough, but the assassination is one Stone insists is part of the same ""track."" Something on the list of ""horribles,"" which Nixon discusses with H.R. Haldeman (James Woods), who then talks about ""bodies,"" references to something I still have never figured out after watching the film 15 times. The Kennedy's bodies? Vietnam dead bodies?
Stone gives Watergate its due, but lets the actual events speak for themselves without embellishing it with more hate towards Nixon than that era produced of its own accord. He actually does a solid job of demonstrating the semi-legitimate reasons for creating the Plumbers in the first place, which was to plug leaks in light of Daniel Ellsberg's treacherous ""Pentagon Papers"" revelation, in concert with the bunker mentality caused by anti-war protesters threatening, in their mind at the time, a civil war like the one that forced Lincoln to declare martial law.
Stone also makes it clear that Nixon and his people were convinced that Kennedy stole the 1960 election, and he does not try to deny it (without advocating it, either). Murray Chotiner represents the realpolitik Republicans who, Stone wants us to know, pulled the same fraudulent tricks, when he says, ""They stole it fair and square.""
Nixon is depicted as foul-mouthed and quite the drinker. His salty language apparently was learned well into adulthood, and he did occasionally imbibe after years as a teetotaler, but his associates insist it was by no means a regular thing. Woods' Haldeman is no friend of the Hebrews, and Paul Sorvino, doing a big league Henry Kissinger, finds himself constantly at war with the inside Nixon team, put down for his Jewishness. Powers Boothe is a cold-blooded Alexander Haig, representing the reality of Watergate's final conclusion.
It never would have happened under J. Edgar Hoover, Nixon says, and Haig agrees that Hoover, who died just before Watergate, was a ""realist"" who would have kept it locked up. Nixon discusses suicide with Haig, who eases him out of that but never really tells him not to. When Nixon asks for any final suggestion, Haig says something the real man probably never said:
""You have the Army. Lincoln used it.""
Sure.
Nixon breaks down, incredulous that for all his accomplishments, he can be brought down by such a nothing event. Stone allows Hopkins to infuse this scene with Shakespearean irony. Stone gives Nixon his due in many ways. He demonstrates that he was utterly faithful to his wife, Pat, turning down a right wing lovely served up by the Birchers, while telling the girl that he entered politics to help people. His hardscrabble youth is nicely portrayed, with Mary Steenburgen playing his long-suffering Quaker mother. Young Nixon is utterly faithful to her and the honest, religious ethic of the family. But in a later scene, Steenburgen looks questioningly at his Presidential aspirations, saying he is destined to lead, but only if God is on his side. It is a telling statement playing to his theme that dark forces are the wind at Nixon's sails. He enters politics as an idealist, and becomes something else because he discovers he has the talent for it. He is industrious, in contrast to the Kennedys, and will earn everything he has simply by out-working everybody.
An entirely loving portrait of Dick Nixon would have no credibility. Stone does a great job with the movie, which is as balanced as it could be with a side of liberal righteousness.(...)",1086480000,7,5571,4.940298507462686

777484,5,6304078110,"Nixon was initially available only in a DVD with minimal extras. In recent years, Oliver Stone has revisited his entire canon with special edition treatments. Nixon was the last hold-out and has finally received a proper two-disc Collector's Edition complete with audio commentaries and other excellent supplemental material.
On the first disc are two audio commentaries by Oliver Stone. The menu simply calls them Commentary A and B with no other distinction than that. The commentaries have their share of dead air but considering that this is a three and half hour film, I'm willing to forgive Stone for the occasional lull.
Commentary A covers the performances, style and script of the movie, while Commentary B delves into the politics and history of the period. Commentary A is the more entertaining of the two as Stone offers his personal observations on the film. Commentary B is good in its own right as Stone discusses a lot of information that the film assumes the audience already knows and identifies who is who and their function in the narrative.
The second disc features ten deleted or extended scenes, some of which, like the meeting between Nixon and Helms, have also been edited back into the movie. Stone provides an introduction for each scene that puts the footage into the proper context within the film.
From the original DVD is also included the five-minute electronic press kit fluff piece that feels more like an extended movie trailer and the theatrical trailer.
To balance out the superficial EPK is an excellent 55-minute interview Stone did with Charlie Rose.
Nixon is a powerful historical biopic - arguably the last great one to come out of Hollywood. This two-disc set is a fantastic improvement over the original DVD. Perhaps the inclusion of a documentary on the real-life Nixon would've been nice for a different perspective on the man but this is a minor quibble. Nixon is well worth picking up for fans of Stone's films and students of United States history.",1084320000,4,1997,4.964179104477612

Did Richard Nixon really know what he signed onto?  Maybe.  Maybe not.  Let's not forget Bob Hoskins' portrayal of FBI Founder and Director J Edgar Hoover.  Conspiracy theories on how MLK and Bobby Kennedy could be drawn from Hoover and Clyde Tolson venting rage at a horse track.  The film's start was OK, and obviously showed Watergate as a part in a series of dirty tricks and internal spying.  The film was good.  I wonder what a movie on George W Bush would be like?

777527,3,6304078110,"Any effort to explore the complex psychology of our esteemed thirty-seventh president, Richard Milhous Nixon, in a single motion picture is sure to run into some difficulties. Scholars, commentators, and all around miscreants have spent years and used up entire forests of paper in an effort to understand Richard Nixon. Born into a poor family from California, Nixon possessed the sorts of gifts that virtually assured he would make a mark on the world, but he also had character traits that seemed to contradict his talents. A brilliant man with a gift for reinventing himself, but an awkward soul when it came to dealing with people, Nixon graduated from law school at the top of his class. By the time he went into politics in the late 1940s and early 1950s, the post-World War II Red Scare was well underway. Nixon took full advantage of McCarthyite tactics, first by smearing a political opponent with charges of pro-communist sympathies and later involving himself in the HUAC committee's work on the Alger Hiss/Whittaker Chambers case. Chosen to serve as Dwight Eisenhower's vice-president, he lost the 1960 presidential election to John F. Kennedy. After another defeat in a bid for the governorship of California, Nixon promised to drop out of politics forever. And he did, for a time, before coming back strong to win the presidency in 1968. Everyone with a pulse knows what happened next.
Oliver Stone, that joyful purveyor of offbeat cinematic adaptations of such touchy subjects as the Vietnam War (Platoon), the Kennedy assassination (JFK), and media violence (Natural Born Killers) constructs a lengthy treatise on a man who has become synonymous with political corruption. Here is ""Nixon,"" a Stone production replete with all of his usual cinematographic stunts, a long list of well-known celebrities in roles both major and minor, and his now familiar breezy style of reworking historical fact to suit his personal vision. One suspects Ollie doesn't care much for Nixon based on themes found in his other films and the slurs heaped upon the subject of this one. As a former Vietnam veteran Stone certainly didn't appreciate Nixon's escalation of the war into Cambodian territory although he does give the man some credit for opening up China (I think). The film is difficult to discuss conventionally due to Stone's insistence on using the same convoluted, non-linear style found in ""Natural Born Killers."" There's Nixon arguing with his wife Pat about running for office. Here's Nixon convincing Pat to support him for one more go. Look, a sweaty Nixon debates Kennedy and complains about having the election stolen from him! Leave it to Stone to insert a significant thread about the Kennedy assassination, which, if not implicating Richard Nixon directly, opens the man up to charges that he knew who orchestrated the events in Dallas on November 22, 1963.
""Nixon"" lurches on and on for over three hours. Most of the film deals with the scandals that ultimately brought him down in August 1974. As the nightmare of Watergate increasingly assumes corporeal form, a besieged Nixon hunkers down in the White House with his diminishing number of confidants railing about Jews, the press, the East Coast elites, and anyone else real or imagined who has it in for the president. The denouement takes place upstairs in the private quarters as the president slouches over a desk as Kissinger and Haig implore him to resign. When asked what options he has to fight with, one of the men replies, ""The army."" Yeah, right. Still, the movie does have its charms despite Stone's hallucinatory cinematography and editing. A great scene takes place right at the end, with Nixon musing aloud in front of a portrait of John F. Kennedy, ""When they look at you, they see what they want to be. When they look at me, they see who they really are."" A highly dramatic scene that works well in the context of the film's depiction of Richard Nixon as a deeply insecure man afraid of the American public.
Although I found the movie wishy-washy in its motivations and execution, I cannot cast aspersions on the cast performances. Top notch stuff all around, from Bob Hoskins as J. Edgar Hoover, James Woods as H.R. Haldeman, J.T. Walsh as John Erlichman, Powers Boothe as Alexander Haig, Mary Steenburgen as Nixon's Mom, Joan Allen as Pat Nixon, David Hyde Pierce as John Dean, E.G. Marshall as John Mitchell, and Sam Waterston as CIA director Richard Helms (and according to Stone, some sort of soulless demon with pitch black eyes and a weird fetish for plants). There are dozens of well known actors in this film. The two greatest performances come from Paul Sorvino as Henry Kissinger and Anthony Hopkins as Richard Nixon. Sorvino completely disappears into his role; he has the accent and mannerisms of the former Secretary of State down cold. Hopkins eerily recreates the late president, or at least the public persona of the man. There's a great scene where a young blonde woman hits on Nixon before he becomes president, and the reactions from Hopkins's Nixon are simply hilarious. Is it true? Who knows? Probably no truer than Stone's constant harping on some sort of shadow force running the government, first seen in ""JFK"" and tediously elaborated upon in ""Nixon.""
The DVD edition of Oliver Stone's ""Nixon"" abounds with extras. There's a commentary from Stone, a trailer, deleted scenes, an interview with the director conducted by Charlie Rose, and a widescreen picture transfer. Give ""Nixon"" a shot if you like Oliver Stone films, but don't expect to come away with an accurate picture of the late president. Those viewers looking for a fast paced film full of action should probably look elsewhere, perhaps Oliver Stone's ""Platoon"" if nothing else.",1077062400,12,5755,4.989594172736733
777528,3,6304078110,"Oliver Stone's film NIXON is an interesting example of what Aristotle calls ""forensic rhetoric""--it is structured to provide extenuating circumstances that will lead audiences to view this president as ""meaning well"" when he violated his oath of office and broke his country's laws. According to this film, Richard M. Nixon, the paranoid potty-mouth who obstructed justice, was motivated by a kind of ""Lincoln complex"" and was just trying to preserve the Union at a time when (supposedly) it was in terrible danger of being split apart by protests against the Vietnam War. Nixon, the reasoning goes, was willing to break the law in order to save the nation. Of course, most of us, including millions of Republicans who have both brains and a sense of honor, know that this ""defense"" is hogwash, and the recent release of additional White House tapes further implicates Nixon in the early planning of the Watergate break-in, not just the cover-up. As an actor, Anthony Hopkins, as usual, is excellent, but only rarely and briefly can we suspend disbelief and imagine we are seeing Nixon. Other members of the cast also shine, and the script concerning their parts in this sordid chapter of our history is generally much more plausible.

777529,5,6304078110,"1968 was a devilish year in the world. Everything everywhere was exploding into chaos. Nixon got elected because of that chaos that led Johnson to step down and because of Vietnam that had sunk into a quagmire and an unavoidable defeat. All that was the sign of a changing world, a world that was changing faster than anyone could foresee and follow. Changing in the West and changing in the East. The East froze down for twenty more years : no change possible. Defeat in the end. The West had started moving with Kennedy, but in the US private and shadowy interests led to the assassinations of John Kennedy himself, Malcolm X, Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy, and in the world the same interests pushed the US ever deeper into the war in Vietnam. Nixon was elected on some kind of quiproquo. He answered that great call for change with old recipes : politics and no ideal, just plain maneuvering. He tried to save the face in Vietnam by forcing the Vietnamese to the negociation table by crushing them and Cambodia and Laos under millions of tons of bombs, by negociating with Mao and recognizing continental China, even though it was communist, and by negociating with Breshnev to buy some kind of peace. Vietnam came to an end after hard negociations that could not in any way guarantee self-determination to the South. There was peace at last, but honor was just a temporary illusion, a political disguise, because everyone knew what was to happen and what did happen. He was never loved by anyone because he refused to compromise with anyone, he imposed his vision and his decisions, even to Kissinger, though Kissinger outmaneuvered him in the long run. Mao was more visionary than Nixon because Mao probably knew what he was doing : opening China on the world and putting China on the road towards becoming a superpower, the superpower it is today in the process of becoming. Breshnev was just saving time for his USSR by cutting his military budget and satisfying some of his people by bringing some measure of peace. But this time-saving policy was doomed anyway. In the US, Nixon's policy was also doomed and Nixon was condemned from the very start : he did not take a democratic road, he did not provide the US with a government from the people, by the people, for the people : he imposed his governement mostly characterised by the abuse of his powers and by the misuse of his office. The big change was still to come when he finally resigned. But has that change come ? I will not answer the question : everyone may have his own opinion. The film though questions the personal level of Nixon's career. He failed in his presidency because he was not loved, so does Oliver Stone say. Maybe he was not loved because he was a bully with everyone, a leader as his mother said later, a man and even a boy who imposed his will, his decisions, his power, his leadership. But why was he like that ? He imitated his father as the film hints. Maybe. Or was he psychotic from the very start and developing some severe case of paranoia ? Maybe. The film leads to these ideas that I do not want to call conclusions. Hypotheses at the best. Nixon was/is a mystery and will remain a mystery, maybe forever.

He doesn't look anything like Nixon, but its amazing how much he starts to look like Nixon once you actually watch the film! Not just his mannerisms and voice (which are spot on) but even his look.
I thought this movie was surprisingly fair to Nixon. It matches much of what I've read about him, especially Chris Matthews book about Nixon and Kennedy. (Although I admit that book is more entertainment than historical document as well)
Some of the cinematography and editing was a little too extreme. It only detracted from a well directed and well acted film.
edited: As I learn more about Nixon, I am discovering that probably more and more of the details illustrated in this film were factual, or commonly accepted as having occured. I didn't believe that Nixon's encounter with Vietnam protesters on the Lincoln Memorial steps actually occured, but it is reported that it did.",1067472000,,971,4.820359281437126

777533,3,6304078110,"Very simply put, ""Nixon"" was for me the best film of the '90s.  Robert Richardson's post-modern, cut-and-paste cinematographic style reached its pinnacle in this work, and Oliver Stone suspended his fullest didacticism by giving us an unmonitored portrait of the ex-President.  You could call the filmmaking style nearly avant-garde, with rapid-fire jump cuts that are not even close to MTV-style flash, but rather in tune with psychological action.  There hasn't been a movie since ""Nixon"" that looked and behaved so virtuosically, nor that conveyed emotions so reservedly unto climax.
However, on to the big looming problem with this release:  like its non-collector's edition predecessor, it is a non-anamorphic, matted widescreen DVD.  What this means, pain and simple, is that it will NEVER play correctly on a widescreen television.  For those of us who have widescreen televisions, the DVD is totally useless (unless we should prefer either of:  (a) distorted, horizontally-challenged (e.g., fat) images; or (b) a tiny matted windowpane inside a matted box).  For those who do not have widescreen televisions, they eventually will, and the investment in this DVD will become worthless.
To get this wrong on the second try is scandalous.  We should pray for a proper DVD release of this '90s masterpiece.",1044921600,6,1310,5.351219512195122
777534,3,6304078110,"I wanted to see this 1995 Oliver Stone film because I'm interested in politics.  However, there's a disclaimer at the beginning which informs the viewer that the film is not not historically accurate.  That ruined it for me right from the beginning.
There's a great cast of actors and all of them are excellent.  There's Joan Allen, Ed Harris, Bob Hoskins, E.G. Marshall, Mary Steenburgen, Paul Sovino  and James Woods.  Anthony Hopkins is cast as Nixon.  But he doesn't look like Nixon at all.  And I still have memories of what the real person looked like.
The screenplay is good too, and resembles a Greek drama as a fatal flaw destroys the ruler. There's good use of newsreel footage, flashbacks and montage too. It could have been a fine film.
At 190 minutes it's much too long though.  And there are too many characters that were part of the Nixon White House and the writer assumed I was supposed to have instant recognition of.  This just made me confused.  There were no surprises in the story either.  I knew that Nixon eventually resigned rather than face impeachment.  There was nothing to anchor my attention.  I actually fell asleep.
Some day there might be a book or a film that is based on historical fact that I can sink my teeth into.  But as for this version of Nixon, I just didn't like it.",1044748800,,1310,4.5665236051502145
777535,4,6304078110,"Film director Oliver Stone deftly redeems himself from the debacle of ""JFK"" a couple of years previous and serves up an intellectual and complicated portrait of the man that was Richard Nixon, the enigmatic professional politician who clawed his way from Congressional anti-Communist to the 37th president of the United States. The disclaimer at the start of the film posits an ""incomplete record"" to account for the still-unfilled gaps in the whole Nixon story. But the ""historical record"" also referenced is faithful to other published materials, making this film an important study piece in trying to understand the dynamics (functional and dysfunctional) that collided to carry the ex-President to the abyss of self-destruction. Anthony Hopkins convincingly plays Nixon as both a pillage-and-burn politician and sympathetic loner who sees but cannot escape his own pathos. The film opens the fateful morning of June 17, 1972, in a meeting room of the Watergate hotel where Nixon operatives are about to embark on the break-in of the National Democratic Committee and set in motion the dynamics that would lead, 26 months later, to Nixon's resignation of the presidency. Refreshingly, Watergate is retold as but one part of the entire Nixon saga and does not define the man in whole. From the film's opening scene, we are flash-forwarded to a December night in 1973 at the White House, where an isolated Nixon labors over the taped conversations that, by then, had brought the Watergate fiasco to its crisis point. And, from there, we are jolted back to 1960, to the night of Nixon's presidential race loss to John Kennedy. From there and to the film's closing scene of Nixon's disgraceful departure from the White House Aug. 9, 1974, Stone takes us from Nixon's impoverished childhood in Whittier, Calif., to Nixon's role in the Congressional witch hunt against alleged Communist spy Alger Hiss and on to his fairly rapid ascension to vice president and, later, to president. As magnificant (and sometimes ruthlessly and mercilessly sinister) Hopkins is as the title character, Joan Allen's portrayal of Pat Nixon and Paul Sorvino's as Nixon's national security adviser, Henry Kissinger, are both must-see's in a film that boasts a A-list cast of supporting players. Despite the criticism of the pro-Nixonites when the film was first released, it is a valuable historical source and, when compared to the public record, is pretty much a faithful and accurate recounting of the complicated life that was Richard Nixon.",1031097600,2,2521,5.196560196560196
777582,3,6304078110,"I found ""Nixon"" to be hugely entertaining, though not the way it was meant to be. Personally I think this is a brilliant comedy. Anthony Hopkins is a fine actor, but he knows he can't quite get inside Nixon - I doubt anyone can - so he spends a lot of time hamming it up and having a great time playing Nixon as a sweaty, awkward, boozing weirdo. (Maybe he was some of these things, but the film never makes it clear why anyone elected him in the first place.) The gothic thunder and lightning that hang over the white house in the opening shots set the melodramatic tone for his fun performance. Meanwhile, the movie is cutting all over the place (featuring flashbacks within flashbacks within flashbacks, I kid you not) in Nixon's life, from his apparently tormented black-and-white childhood to his apparently tormented adulthood (which cuts mysteriously between black and white and color for no apparent reason) to his tormented final days listening to his Watergate tapes in his office while having yet another scotch with ice. Director Oliver Stone has taken on an ambitious task for himself; in the process he ends up throwing in newsreel footage of nearly every historical event of the period, then flailing over to jerky shots of clouds and traffic moving at lightning speed over Washington, then odd scenes of Nixon trading Cuba conspiracy theories with good actors like E.G. Marshall and Larry Hagman. In short, this long, strange film left me in guffaws of laughter at times (""do ya want some pansy like George McGovern?"") and for that I give it an extra star. It is nothing if not entertaining.",1028851200,2,1607,4.763440860215054
777583,2,6304078110,"BEWARE this is not a biographical film. It is a fiction based on a real person. This movie actually portrays Nixon as being involved in the deaths of JFK and Robert Kennedy,

777584,5,6304078110,"This is the ""sequel"" to Stone's other masterpiece, ""JFK,"" a brilliant and unrelenting deconstruction of not only the Warren Report but also of the Cold War myth of heroic American altruism versus those who, supposedly, ""hate us because we are free.""
In ""JFK,"" Stone explains how the Vietnam War began; in ""Nixon,"" he shows the results of its crude brutalities. ""JFK"" posits a John F. Kennedy who started his presidency as a conventional anti-communist, but who, after the double traumas of the Bay of Pigs and the Cuban Missile Crisis (the latter, literally, the closest humankind has ever come to ""ending the world""), became a convert to a humane rationality: he saw that the Cold War had become an ""endless war,"" the victims of which were, primarily, the poor, the ignorant, and the wretched of the earth. Kennedy died for his change of heart and mind, a death which overlays ""Nixon"" like a pall.
Stone's Nixon (Anthony Hopkins is even more physically unattractive in the part than the real-life version) is an opportunist twisted by his mother's cold and exacting religiosity, his father's harsh fatalism, the deaths of two of his beloved brothers, and his intense ambition to prove himself worthy of his mother's demands and his brothers' deaths. His poisonous resentment of his defeat by Kennedy in the 1960 presidential election and his ruthless determination to vindicate himself by finally winning the presidency, lead Nixon into a devil's alliance with FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover (played with an icy puckishness by Bob Hoskins), sinister corporate rightists (aptly represented by Larry Hagman as a fictional oil man who is a yet ghastlier version of J. R. Ewing), and a mysterious, dark, ""shadow government"" of CIA, FBI, the Mafia and military ""special operatives"" who run an ultra-secret ""assassination bureau"" under the bland title, ""Track II.""
Nixon's faustian bargain for the presidency has two aspects: first, his betrayal of Kennedy, as he comes to understand that JFK -- a man he loved as a ""brother"" when they served together in Congress -- was indeed murdered in a Track II operation because of that opposition to continuing the Vietnam War; second, his own support for that war (while realizing that he must, somehow, end it at last, or see U. S. society ""come apart"") and his concurrent (and unconstitutional) persecution of the youth ""counterculture,"" the New Left, and the ""Black Power"" movement, which lead the fight against the war and for a humane, generous-hearted America.
The confrontation with youthful demonstrators (against Nixon's brutal expansion of the war into Cambodia) in the early morning at the Lincoln Memorial is a chilling yet moving representation of Nixon's dilemma -- as is the cynical colloquy between Nixon and Mao Zedong (Ric Young in a remarkably creepy performance), in which Mao chortles that ""the real war is in us,"" i.e., in ambitious men who have killed their consciences.
I recommend the ""Director's Cut"" of ""Nixon,"" by the way, for its inclusion (after the credits roll at the end) of the scene between Nixon and CIA Director Richard Helms, played with a precise and coolly insouciant sophistication by Sam Waterston. In this dark film (both thematically and visually), this particular sequence is set in Helm's brightly lit office, which is also filled with ominously large exotic orchids. In one slinky motion, Waterson's eyes suddenly appear pitch-black among the shelves filled with plants and along which Waterson's Helms seems to slide like a snake. Like the sudden appearance of the Track II ""horrible"" (Nixon's characterization), E. Howard Hunt (portrayed with appropriate menace by the great Ed Harris) on a remote Washington bridge before a waiting John Dean notices him, this is a goose-pimply scene absolutely worthy of Alfred Hitchcock.
Oliver Stone is a great director of disturbing, complex political thrillers for perceptive critics of American government policies. If he does not seem to be doing anything of note lately, it is because he needs to be working on a film about the ugly and corrupt Clinton administration, or about the duplicitous Bush administration conspiracy behind ""9-11."" Let him do those films and he may well equal the unrivalled genius shown in both ""JFK"" and ""Nixon,"" the two best political movies of the last twenty years.",1021680000,9,4321,5.121813031161473
777585,5,6304078110,"While others have questioned the historical accuracy of Oliver Stone in this film, it is really the super acting job done by film greats such as Anthony Hopkins and Joan Allen that allow me to give this film five stars.  The Collectors Edition has some nice extras but I would have expected more.
The film is more relevant to someone like me who lived through the Nixon years and saw how his actions divided America.  I think this film really portrays that period in our history when we were divided.  Nixon could have done a lot to heal the wounds but did not.

777587,2,6304078110,"First of all, I will say that I am a fan of Richard Nixon's.  As a matter of fact, I believe that he was one of the greatest Presidents this country ever produced.  Having said that I had hoped that this movie would be of some interest to me.  I had also hoped that Oliver Stone would stay away from the ""brooding, hunched-over, dark character"" occupying the White House.  After all that very incorrect portrait has been put forth by Richard Nixon's enemies and detractors for better than fifty years.
Those who worked with President Nixon all say that was not the case and attempts to portray him as such are but one more attempt to prove the old adage:  repeat a lie often enough and it becomes truth.
Unfortunately, Oliver Stone buys into the lie.  We see the brilliant Anthony Hopkins as Nixon acting paranoid and brooding as he goes through his life.  He even suggests that Nixon had some sort of ""survivor"" guilt because he lost two brothers.  All this while Nixon is supposedly drinking heavily and popping pills.  What fascinates me is not that Stone would make such a movie, (that's obvious) but why he had to rely on all the old stereotypes to make a movie.  It proved that he didn't do much more historical research than Saturday Night Live would do for a skit.  Oliver Stone proved in living technicolor that what President Nixon stood for scares him and those of his political bent.  It proves that when you don't have much in the way of facts, you can always fall back on that old chestnut, ""artistic license"".  This is borne out by the fact that Stone gives all of five (literally) minutes to Nixon's trips to China and Russia, and about one minute to his ending the Vietnam war.  The rest is a conglomeration of film snippets that look like a five year old child took a pair of scissors to the film.  Nothing flows or is smooth.
The sad thing is that this could have been such a fine movie if there was anything nearing adherence to the facts.  Richard Nixon is fascinating and this could have been shown in a balanced and fair way. Instead Oliver Stone took a hackneyed cliche, added some of his own historical revisionism and voila, the great director said ""I have a movie!""
This movie could have been great-it could have been a contender, but it ended up a victim of its creator's fears, prejudices, and hatreds.",1011312000,16,2331,4.514285714285714
777588,5,6304078110,"While Oliver Stone has many times given into historic speculation and wild theorizing, his unflinching love for controversy has always had my respect. With ""Nixon"", however, Stone largely sticks to the certifiable historical record, perhaps in response to the Kafka-esque damnation of ""JFK."" Nixon comes through in this film as I'm sure he was in actuality: a manipulative, conniving political genius, albeit a seriously disturbed one. Nixon as a pill-popping alcoholic? Such a stretch you say? Read the recollections of Haldeman  and Erlichman, not to menton Kissinger, who constantly make reference to Nixon's chemical dependancy and mental instability. Actcally as history, ""Nixon"" works quite well. Sure there are embelishments for the sake of time: the ""Jack Jones"" character, for instance. But we would be foolhardy, not to mention dead wrong, to ignore the role of big money in the election of Nixon in '68 and '72. The supposedly ""wild"" ssumptions Stone makes about Nixon and his paranoia about the JFK killing? Once again, read Haldeman's own account, in which he speculates that Nixon's constant references to the ""Bay of Pigs"" was a ""code"" for JFK. (The Bay of Pigs operation was inherited by Kennedy from the Eisenhower White House, and who had been its handler then? Nixon.) I don't want to turn this into a rant, but I sincerely challenge Nixon defenders to actually go back and READ the history, which has become even more starkly clear since Nixon's death and the release of de-classified Watergate tapes. Like Welles and Kubrick, Stone is a man ahead of his time, and doomed to suffer condemnation by phillistines on both sides of the aisle. But his films only gain relevance, and furthemore, truth, as years pass.",1010534400,10,1731,5.095070422535211
777589,2,6304078110,"Essentially a hate letter masquerading as a mass-market film, Oliver Stone's supposed historical-drama of the life of Richard Nixon fails on both counts. The understated vengeance with which Stone attacks Nixon, both personally and professionally, is only outdone by Stone's utter neglect in this film's depiction of those whose confidence in Nixon during a period wherein mainstream America's distaste for 60's-era social meltdown, crime, drug use, and foreign-fomented anti-Vietnam rabble-rousing, for better or worse, largely led to Nixon's election to two consecutive terms as President.
This film is particularly problematic in that it makes a special point of not only reducing Nixon to the level of a psychotic stooge, but also of attempting to destroy the reputations of literally every significant figure associated with Nixon throughout his entire life, save, perhaps, Henry Kissinger; Kissinger is only sideswiped, presumably because Stone found it politically-incorrect to direct hate speech against a Jew. No one else, however, is spared Stone's wrath.
The tragic downfall in an otherwise successful political career, namely Nixon's almost certain criminal culpability in the Watergate Scandal, is dealt with ala the Woodward-Bernstein dumbed-down white-wash without further visible research or exposition. The fact that Stone supposedly scoured the ends of the earth to get to the 'truth' for ""JFK"", but simply rubber-stamped the Washington Post's take on John Dean's self-exculpatory version of Watergate for ""Nixon"", speaks volumes.
Again, a brain-dead Watergate view-bias is superficially regurgitated and treated as 'accepted fact', mainly in deference to Stone's larger attempts to roast Nixon over Vietnam, a conflict which democrat Lyndon Johnson fully embraced and escalated, and then abandoned by quitting the 1968 race, and which Nixon subsequently inherited and ended, anything to the contrary that Stone subtlety asserts in this film notwithstanding.
Stone devotes miles of film to Nixon's ostensibly-horrific prosecution of that miserable war, yet opportunist-communist Pol Pot's murder of millions of Cambodians in the vacuous aftermath of the U.S. withdrawal, same withdrawal which was the goal of the anti-war ""peace"" movement, receives only a few scant words in the epilogue. Shame. This film's body refuses to considerately acknowledge Nixon's objective of preventing the domino-effect potential for genocide which was, in fact, played out to the letter after the war, one would hope to the chagrin of the anti-war neophytes.
Stone attempts to make up for the lack of historical integrity in this film by putting endless incredible, undocumented words into Nixon's mouth through use of dramatic license. It would not matter if it were not so obvious that Stone's intention was to tar and feather Nixon, and attempt to re-write history in the process.
Even an immensely strong cast in choice, direction, and performance nevertheless don't make this dog bark. In fact, Anthony Hopkins' valiant, finely-directed effort in the title role evokes less empathy for Nixon than did Alec Guinness' portrayal of Hitler in ""The Last Ten Days"". That should tell someone something.
Most true students of Nixon agree that while the President was certainly neurotic and plagued with other personality problems, he was, at the core, the pivotal political figure of the second half of the 20th Century. The filmmakers attempted to skew and/or rewrite that fact from their own perspective. In this outing, at least, they have utterly failed.
Stone's on-the-sleeve politics aside, this is a totally professionally executed film that will almost certainly engage the ill-informed, at least from a stylistic standpoint. It is quite close to perfection in its cinematic execution. Perhaps that was the film's primary intent, and perhaps it's also unfortunate that Stone chose this subject matter for what could be his 'Tour De Force'. The production qualities are very high, although at times the occasionally tedious outing takes on a bit of an (albeit-forgivable) low-budget appearance. Necessarily disjointed in spots, the film does succeed in covering Nixon's entire life, an epic endeavor in any event. Stone's modeled approach to the production itself is excellent. Stone deserved credit to that end. 'Nixon' is further proof of Stone as an outstanding producer.
Everyone knows that Nixon was a jerk. Stone did not need 3-plus hours to elucidate that fact. Stone's error here is that of era-context. Unfortunately for this film and Stone, all the spin in the world cannot overcome the fact that a majority of Americans did not buy into a so-called stateside 'peace' movement whilst clearly corrupt communists in the USSR and Red China were attempting to expand their sick reach into the Free World. Unfortunately for America, Nixon was the best, and perhaps only, choice which mainstream America had at its disposal during the American Nation's most trying recent times. This fact was mostly overlooked, or side-stepped outright,  in the film.
Again, Stone failed to fully capture the larger social dynamic that brought Nixon to power in the first place: large numbers of practical people that had no use for people of Stone's laudable, but demonstrably nave, world-view.
To Stone's credit, the film is mostly devoid of conspiracy-type theories, even though evidence to such ends may exist with respect to Nixon and American History. But Stone does try.
The film's fatal downfall is its failure to present a fully-rounded image of Nixon himself, a man whom most scholars concede to be of an exceptionally complex, if flawed, composition. Instead, ""Nixon"" only succeeds for those whose opinions of Nixon are already cast in stone, no pun intended.
Considering Stone's well-known predispositions, some might claim he showed at least a modicum of balance and restraint. Stone's weak explanation of equally-guilty vipers on the opposite side of the aisle, same being critical to the accurate painting of Nixon as a complete political entity, tends to suggest otherwise. You be the judge.
As movie making: an A-. As History,  a D, and that's generous.

777590,5,6304078110,"After having read many of the illuminative posts on this film I feel compelled to keep my comments here short as many of my positive thoughts on this film have already been touched upon.
I simply want to state that ""Nixon"" is a superb film, an intriguing, contentious interpretation of American history which, in my humble opinion, will eventually be understood as a classic.
What can be said that has not been said except that Stone's analysis of his title character is potent, touching, and altogether surprising.  Stone does not vilify Nixon, but characterizes Nixon as a fundamentally good individual who is eventually corrupted by the trappings of power and that when Nixon falls it is tragic for all the positive that has gone unfulfilled.  Nixon is presented as a three dimensional character and the film challenges us to weigh the evils committed against the expanse of Nixon's life.  What emerges is an intriguing problematic:  judgement is problematized.
Stone has done a fascinating thing, for every potently evil Nixon moment we are given moments of pain, humility, and moral strength and an impression (the Jack Jones scene) that Nixon had the potential, as a Republican, to stand up and confront the extreme right wing elements of the American political landscape.  Stone implies that some sort of radical moment was at hand in American history, a moment that Nixon undermined by his own actions.
Nixon is a complex, long, and ultimately confrontational film.  Stone has made the best sort of cinematic biography, one that challenges your views regardless of what they are politically.",1007337600,9,1599,5.083969465648855

People who live in constant indignation might be able to understand why movies are expected to last only so long, and this is one of those two videotape movies that might count as two selections in more ways than one, without having a special movie category for psychotic multiplicity for people who have actually been involved in something that was motivated by the idea, ""Let's get some real killers,"" a line which might not appear in the movie, but the book has some essays in Part 1, from pages 1 to 79, including one by a screenwriter on this project called, ""The Year of the Beast"" on pages 56-60 about the process of making a movie out of this kind of thing.  Movies are one of our most popular artforms, and as blockbusters go, often form the ultimate comparison with reality which help people like Ronald Reagan form some idea of what is going on in the world, moral and all.  A lot of reality was behind the chilling aspects of this movie, and my key to what makes this movie tick is the bomshell on page 290 of the screenplay, where a ""Nixon (V.O. on Tape)"" imaginatively constructs what might have been on ""an eighteen-and-a-half-minute gap in a critical Watergate tape.""  If the government actually has any secrets, Oliver Stone and United Stoners of America everywhere must believe ""Whoever killed Kennedy came from this . . . this thing we created.  This Beast . . . That's why we can't let this thing go any farther.""
As for actually watching the movie, I liked the line ""Nixon can't say that,"" which was a gentle joke about whatever the truth might be, whenever the movie tried to approach how Nixon might react to the truth about anything.  This movie should be good for people who think the United Stoners of America could learn a lot by using their imaginations to fill in a lot of gaps in our knowledge of Nixon as a character, and especially of our government as a monstrosity.  I loved Martha Mitchell in this movie as I never had before, and I think it was because she added a human element which is quite common in movies, but quite sadly lacking in most of this show, and there are even footnotes on page 290 of the script to show how much study the people who made this movie went through to be able to suck the life out of this film so effectively.",1005177600,,2703,4.448484848484848
777612,4,6304078110,"I was really surprised by the excellence of this movie. Anthony Hopkins really pulled it off. He had to walk a fine line of impersonating Nixon without overdoing it into ham. Joan Allen was absolutely amazing with her presentation of Pat Nixon. Paul Sorvino is excellent as Kissinger, although he is way too tall. A stellar cast and refined sets are NIXON's cinematic strengths.
Although Stone throws in regurgitations of his JFK conspiracy theories, the dramatic exploration of Nixon's character sweeps away most of the more ""hypothetical"" moments. The linkages between Nixon-the-politician and Nixon-the-kid are some of the movie's most glossy and speculative moments, going on for far too long. Also Stone couldn't resist throwing in weird little backdrop footage of war and protest during speeches and whatnot, only emphasizing the obvious.
All in all, the movie is more than just a political position. It really presents Nixon's strengths and frailties as both a politician and a man. His political victories domestically and abroad are presented as well as his shady Watergate dealings and ego-extension via bombing Cambodia. His love for his family and his good intentions for the country are presented along with his paranoia, insecurities, and mental implosion towards the end of his presidency.",997142400,4,1304,5.334951456310679
777613,4,6304078110,"What infuriates all those apologists and fanatical supporters of Richard Nixon out there is that Oliver Stone supposedly has an axe to grind about their man by making a film like NIXON.  They assumed a lot, but didn't even bother to see the film.
The truth is that NIXON is much more even-handed in its portrayal of the 37th President of the United States than I thought it could be.  Anthony Hopkins gives a reasonably fair portrayal of Nixon, and Joan Allen is tremendous as his wife Pat.  Although Stone's penchant for conspiracy does get the better of him at times, he sees Nixon as more a tragic victim than as an evil power-monger, a vision that is closer to the truth than what Nixon's enemies made him out to be in reality.
Stone wisely does not gloss over the simple facts about the man.  Nixon was indisputably a great and cagey anticommunist politician who managed to split the Sino-Soviet communist alliance in two and thus promote stability in the Cold War world for years to come.  But he left a lot to be desired as a human being, being paranoid, distrustful, deceitful, and, in the end, blatantly dishonest.  In that sense, the saga of Richard Nixon ranks as the American equivalent of a Greek tragedy: so much explosive potential destroyed by scandal.
As in JFK, Stone has assembled a massive cast of people: Ed Harris, Bob Hoskins, J.T. Walsh, and James Woods, just to name a few.

However, at 15, I thoroughly enjoyed and had a complete grasp of the events portrayed in this great film. Oliver Stone has a grand combination of things I love: Anthony Hopkins, politics, and history. This was my reason for loving this film. Many of you may not be as enthused by politics and history as I. Even so, you owe it to the memory of this highly misunderstood leader to see the truth of what actually happened during Watergate and during his tenure as president.
  NIXON has an all star cast which makes it even better to make the three hours go by more interestingly. It includes Anthony Hopkins (of Hannibal Lecter fame), Joan Allen, E.G. Marshall, and Paul Sorvino as a surprisingly convincing Henry Kissinger. Stone also masterfully uses archive footage to make real people like JFK, LBJ, Truman, Spiro Agnew, and Gerry Ford appear in the film. The film jumps around a bit, but it chronicles Nixon's childhood, his bids for the presidency, the Watergate scandal, and his life after the presidency. This truly is a masterful film, and these things only make it better.
  NIXON is not a film for everyone. It is a great film, but the subject matter may not be to everyone's liking. My suggestion is that one rent NIXON first, see if you enjoy it, then if you do: purchase it. Whatever your decision, see this great film called NIXON.",995760000,11,1429,4.6141732283464565
777615,5,6304078110,"Oliver Stone's telling of the Nixon years is, at the very least, stupendous.  Mr. Stone has a wonderful way of directing a film that brings the characters to life.
In ""Nixon"", Anthony Hopkins brings the reality of the Nixon administration to the screen with a powerful resonance of character.  Everyone has heard the stories of how paranoid Nixon was, but Hopkins brings this paranoia to life in exquisite detail.  At times you can even see the madness of Hannibal Lecter in Nixon, which from many accounts accurately describes the true character of the man.
While the film is long, it does grind its way into every detail of the man and the period.  From a fireside chat with financiers (Larry Hagman is wonderful and makes you feel as if J.R. had a hand in the downfall), to a meeting on Air Force One between advisors, ""Nixon"" tells everything that no movie before had ever told, and will most likely never tell again.",995673600,,921,4.666666666666667

I must say immediately that I am a huge Oliver Stone fan, mainly impressed with the range of direction appearing in his films and his tendency to take filmmaking to an extreme.

Nixon, for whatever else it may represent, is a tale of a president who felt he was never beloved by the people, and who always feared the long-looming shadow of his predecessor JFK. It describes the trials and tribulations of a man disjointed with the public, yet still pure at heart.
The main focus of the film is on the notoriety of the Watergate Scandal, with the rest of the movie setting up the motive and the circumstances under which it took place. Nixon (played brilliantly by Academy Award winner Anthony Hopkins) spends most of the movie sheltered by his cabinet and chiefs of staff in discussing various conspiracy issues that occurred in the 60s and 70s.
Where this film truly blossoms, and where it earned a rare 5-star rating from me, was in its dynamics. Sure, 191min is a long movie (with the director's cut tallying an even greater 212min), but the film is brilliantly filled with ""Oliver Stone-esque"" flashbacks to old newsreel footage and supposed earlier points in the character's lives.

777618,5,6304078110,"Oliver Stone's ""Nixon"" is quite simply a great American film, one that has been shamefully overlooked in comparison with the seriously flawed ""JFK.""  Stone obviously took notice of the criticisms of that earlier film, and while some of his conspiracy-mania appears in ""Nixon"", overall the later film is a much more balanced and human effort.  Stone can direct like a lunatic (has anybody but the seriously disturbed sat through ""Natural Born Killers"" more than once?)  but he is an undeniably intelligent and talented filmmaker who can rise to the occasion when challenged.  And he was obviously challenged by the task of coming to terms with Richard Nixon, the dominant political figure of his youth.  Stone dedicated the movie to his late father, and it is obviously an attempt by a son to understand patriarchal authority--and its abuses.
Stone's aggressive style is much on display here, but it helps draw you into the drama, rather than distracting as it has in other films.  Ther's some truly inspired casting, from David Hyde Pierce as John Dean to James Woods and J.T. Walsh as Haldeman and Ehrlichman, to the splendid Joan Allen as Pat Nixon.  But the centerpiece is Anthony Hopkins as Nixon who gives another remarkable performance in his patented manner of ""clenched flamboyance"" (as one critic described his acting.)  He makes you feel every hurt, every slight that the man ever felt, as well as letting us see the undeniable brilliance as well as the pathetic flaws.  By the time the Mormon Tabernacle Choir sings ""Shanendoah"" over footage of Nixon's funeral and the closing credits (a masterful, unironic touch) you may find yourself genuinely grieving over the wasted genius.

It is not the fault of ANTHONY HOPKINS who gives it a valiant try. One of the most annoying STONE trick is the use of montage to fill the screen with images often unnecessary.

This is a brilliant, powerful and important work. Stone does not justify what Richard Nixon did, he instead, presents a portrait of a flawed man haunted by memories and events. There is a Shakespearean feel to the screenplay. The film is a look at how politics really works, how it's a jungle in that field where issues are forgotten and the object is to win. ""Nixon"" is a study of power, and how power really works in our system of government. Stone is one of the most brilliant filmmakers of our time, his film here is filled with powerful moments, intense, rich cinematography by Robert Richardson and an editing style that adds texture, realism and energy to the movie. As for re-writing history, the pundits who attack this movie are living in Disneyland and even John Dean claimed that there wasn't anything ""unfair"" in the dramatic license found in the script. Besides, who the hell goes to the movies to get the facts? For that watch a documentary (and those use a large degree of dramatic license too) or read a book! ""Nixon,"" in it's depiction of how politics and the world works is completely accurate. If you don't believe it, do your own research and especially read Anthony Summers' ""Official And Confidential: The Secret Life Of J.Edgar Hoover."" Oliver Stone is one of the true film directors who dares to show the truth, who takes a mirror and forces us to look at ourselves.

Secondly, there is about a half-hour worth of deleted scenes that were tagged on to the end of the Video edition of this movie. They are not on the DVD edition. How crucial are those scenes? More than those edited and then added to the Natural Born Killers release on Video & DVD. Another scene with Hoskins as ""Hoover"" explains Nixon's tapes and Hoovers apparent philosophy on personal record keeping. There is an interesting scene where we get a conversation between Nixon and his aide's where they discuss the hippy movement and their opinions shed a little light on the attitude of people surrounding the president. Call the scene ""the Fig Leaf Topic"". One scene cut has Nixon confronting his cabinet regarding press leaks. It seems to indicate his slipping into paranoia regarding alliegence and certainly another powerful moment where we see the president seperating himself from everyone and screaming through the looking-glass. Finally, the one real reason to have this feature (only available on Video) is the leangthy scene where Nixon meets with Richard Helms, Director of the CIA. Want to understand the difference between death and evil? Want to understand the dark conservative philosophy behind the cold war? The discussion is an explanation of the ""Wild Beast"" mentioned on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, as Helms explains the ""organic appetites"" of many of our nations mysterious ad-hoc institutions. Helms is perfectly Satanic. His place in history and its disclosure in this movie is as close we will ever come to personifying the evil of absolute power.

The  important thing in a film is its message, and Oliver Stone despite not  liking Nixon explains why he is actually a hero. Stone told in an interview  that he saw Nixon like he was his father.
Nixon grows up and wants to  be loved, he wants to succeed, and every time he is kicked down he comes  back again. He does care about people---as his impromptu midnight visit to  the Vietnam war protestors shows. He marries an extraordinarily loving  woman in Pat Nixon, who stands by him through the years. Both are exhausted  over the years campaigning, trying to become President, yet they try one  more time and win. Where do we get such people? Do we deserve such people?  Nixon ponders as he re-enters his limo from visiting the protestotrs---was  he a part of the dragon or was the dragon using him? Certainly the latter.
Stone has it right, the bottom line is that someone had to be crucified  for Vietnam.
Someone had to pay. Yet, during this dark time, Nixon was  THE right man to hold our country together and masterfully pull out from  Vietnam and outflank the Soviets with opening talks with the Red Chinese.  Only Cold Warrior Nixon could have pulled it off. And Stone definately  anti-Nixon has to show this, because Stone has integrity. And this is  really what happened to Nixon, he took ""the fall"" for Vietnam,  and its the American people who are to blame for this. Just as they let  their President get killed (JFK) and the guilty getting away, they let the  mob mentality ruin Nixon.
The scene where Nixon asks Kissinger to come  and pray with him is phenomenal and shows the humanity of Nixon who I think  God rewarded for this.
As the film is ending, I wish Stone would let  Nixon finish his farewell speech where he admits that if you hate you only  destroy yourself and that he has seen many deep valleys but you never know  the true value of the highpoints without the humility of the low points;  beautiful stuff, should be left as is.
Anyway---the Nixon story does NOT  end! Nixon recovers, writes books, helps craft foreign policy ideas for  making Russia democratic---did America deserve such a great leader like  Nixon? He gave his all, warts and all for us, and our ""thank-you""  is to make him the fall guy for our war. I'm not sure if Nixon fessed up to  Watergate up front that the American people would have forgiven him, as  Stone alludes with the character played by James Woods because they wanted  someone to pay publicly for Vietnam. Interesting idea, though.

Number  one--Anthony Hopkins.  His being cast makes as much sense as bacon-flavored  ice cream.  Okay, okay, some of you will say, ""But he's doing an  INTERPRETATION of Nixon.""  But Stone's meticulousness at historic  visual accuracy (don't some of the shots look exactly as if they were  filmed in the '60s?) makes Hopkins' presence all the more jarring.  People  like me may be called crybabies for wanting an actor to look exactly like  the man he portrays, but fer goodness  sakes--Nixon's face--that scowl,  those jowls--is so iconic; how could anyone think he could pull this  casting decision off?  At any rate, Anthony Hopkins' lack of resemblance to  Nixon creates a vacuum that another actor with lesser ability but more  resemblance would have filled.

Hot Toasty Rag, October 22, 2017

I know its not very popular to criticize Oliver Stone, since hes created such revered masterpieces as Platoon and JFK, I have to say his judgement was seriously impaired when he cast Nixon. Anthony Hopkins? If I thought long and hard, I could probably come up with a worse choice, but right now Im drawing a blank. Not only do Richard Nixon and Anthony Hopkins not share one molecule of a similar appearance, but everyone knows Anthony Hopkins cant do accents! If you're not going to look like Nixon, youve got to at least sound like him! Anthony Hopkins is a disaster. He was so terrible, I turned the film off. I couldn't listen to him utter Bunny one more time.

To be fair, because I have no desire to be mean for no reason, Anthony Hopkins wasn't Oliver Stones first choice. Reportedly, Tom Hanks, Jack Nicholson, Warren Beatty, and John Malkovich were offered the part first. Stone also considered Gary Oldman, Robin Williams, Tommy Lee Jones, and Gene Hackman before offering it to Anthony Hopkins. Id like to think Stone wasn't really happy with Hopkinss performance, and Id like to think it was his terrible imitation that made the movie a box-office flop, but theres no way to know for sure.

Im sure you don't need a warning, but card-carrying Republicans are going to want to avoid this movie. Oliver Stone is not conservative-friendly, and he doesnt even try to paint President Nixon in a positive light. In this three-hour-fifteen-minute biopic, he includes memories from Nixons childhood up through and past the Watergate scandal. All the famous names that one would expect to be in a Watergate movie are included: Joan Allen as Pat Nixon, David Hyde Pierce as John Dean, Bob Hoskins as J. Edgar Hoover, Paul Sorvino as Henry Kissinger, J.T. Walsh as John Ehrlichman, James Woods as H.R. Haldeman, and Sam Waterston as Richard Helms.

In the greatest of ironies, Dan Hedaya, the man who played the ultimate Nixon in Dick, has a small role in the film, as does Saul Rubinek, who played a fantastic Henry Kissinger. Apparently, everybody wanted to be in this movie, for reasons I cant fathom. Its an atrocity, and anyone who watches it as a history lesson on President Nixon will be very poorly educated. But, Ed Harris, Powers Boothe, Mary Steenburgen, E.G. Marshall, David Paymer, Annabeth Gish, Tony Goldwyn, Larry Hagman, Edward Herrmann, Madeline Kahn, Robert Beltran, John C. McGinley, Michael Chiklis, and Marley Shelton didn't think it was a mistake to act in the film. While it was nominated for four Academy Awards in 1996, I cant recommend watching it even to see how atrocious it was. Take my word for it, please.",1508630400,,2689,4.788793103448276
