8534088,5,B0091G3NIK,"I started triathlons a few years ago in my mid 40's, having never swam over 100 yards at one time.  Now as a 50 year old wanting to improve my stroke efficiency to save energy for the bike and run, I picked up Kevin's DVD, and I have noticed a difference in my stroke after just 1 workout.  I saw a video of the Kevin's long, efficient stroke on the internet and tried to mimic it, with limited success.  Then after doing the beginning drills #1 through #6 which felt like ""wax on, wax off"" I tried it again and the light went on and I made it to the wall in 6 fewer strokes than normal.  I felt a bit gassed, but with practice and conditioning I'm betting the increased efficiency will translate to better overall speed and strength.  Some lower star reviews have criticized the brevity of the content, but I think that's a plus. Thanks Kevin for your easygoing, direct, and concise approach.",1375315200,2,893,4.355421686746988
8534089,4,B0091G3NIK,"I like the way Kevin explains and demonstrated the drills. I found the DVD helpful in understanding what I was suppose to be doing. However, I found the modules he has with his TRI Swim Pro memebership much more helpful. There he has both a written explination and short videos, followed by 3 days of workouts.

I started out using a DVD from total immersion swimming. The problem I had with TI was understanding how to apply the drills to freestyle swimming. Kevin does a great job filling in this gap. He shows the drills, and explains how the drills apply to freestyle swimming.

I'd also reccomend listinging to his podcasts.",1366761600,,629,4.657657657657658
8534090,5,B0091G3NIK,"I wanted to finish a triathlon.
I could not swim.

At the advanced age of over 40 I had never learned to swim growing up in Philadelphia and now living in South Florida I was surrounded by water.
I often did not take part in lots of water related activities for fear of drowning or feeling foolish doing the doggy paddle.

I finally got a coach to work with me but once a week was not enough and him telling me to swim on my own had no structure.
I found out about this DVD from a podcast that the author had a mutual friend on as a guest, Sandy Shepard, who is an Ironman finisher.

 This DVD was the structure I needed to fill in the gaps and work on my own. My swim coach noticed immediately that something was different after only working on 2 of the basic drills presented in the DVD. Kevin has an easy style that make you think you are at the pool with him helping and showing you like a buddy not a drill sergeant !

I can honestly say on technique I learned in the DVD helped me save a women from drowning with me not being the best swimmer at all ( the one arm drill )

I have now finished several sprint distance triathlon, swum in Hawaii where the Ironman championship is held and I am set to take on a 1500 meter swim as part of the Abu Dhabi International Triathlon in the open water I feel totally confident.

I may had that I am emailed the author several times in a year about the DVD's exercises and drills and always got a response.

This is must have for a  "" scaredy cat "" newbie to supplement any other training you are doing.",1360540800,3,1547,4.0625
8534091,5,B0091G3NIK,"You follow this DVD and you'll just begin to swim better & effortlessly.  Then take on his training session suggestions, workouts, etc. for even more excelling.",1357689600,2,160,5.153846153846154
8534092,5,B0091G3NIK,"I bought this video along with Kevin's drill cards because I had no competitive swim experience whatsoever and I needed some help to learn how to swim properly and efficiently. I used his drills on this video religiously and saw my triathlon swim times falling. I ended my season this year with a half ironman and I smoked the swim in 25 minutes, I was 25 th in my Age group out of nearly 750. I have no doubt that the triswimcoach series helped me tremendously and u would recommend this to anyone wanting to improve their swim!!!",1357603200,,531,4.428571428571429
