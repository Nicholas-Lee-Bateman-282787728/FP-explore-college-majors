8581067,5,B00CEU44UG,"The DVD arrived quickly and I have enjoyed watching it.  It was a great show, but unfortunately one of Brent's last. I wish I could have been there, but the timing didn't allow.  The sound and video quality is good, though I don't really like the effects they frequently use distorting the band with ""trippy images. I would much rather see the band as they were or images of the crowd.",1511308800,,385,4.408450704225352
8581068,3,B00CEU44UG,"Not the best View from the Vault, but it had it's moments. Phil in shorts is disturbing.",1482710400,,88,4.235294117647059
8581069,4,B00CEU44UG,"Another video of the Grateful Dead in concert nearly ruined by some overly-enthusiastic video editor's version of psychedelic special effects during all the best parts of the songs. If there is a version of this video without the added ""special effects"" I would like to buy it. Very, very frustrating that this rare footage could be ruined like this.",1459728000,5,350,4.9491525423728815

8581071,5,B00CEU44UG,I attended both of these shows. Both were great and the DVD captures them perfectly. Good memories. I wish the Dead would release more of this era via the Vault series.,1456876800,,168,4.451612903225806
