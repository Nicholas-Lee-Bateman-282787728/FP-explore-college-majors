If fact Amazon needs to change all the other foreign films thay say are in English and are not. Customer beware.",1187568000,10,252,4.270833333333333

8153408,5,B000JVT23G,"This is one of the best films ever made of an opera. It is sung in the xshosa (?) language and it works magnificently well. I wanted to buy a dvd and looked everywhere even while i was in south africa to no avail. I finally found a new sealed copy on ebay and guess from where it is being shipped? GREECE OF ALL PLACES AND THE TITLE ON THE DVD COvER IS IN GREEK AND FROM what is explained is that it has greek subtitles that i will be able to turn on and off. At least i will be able to view it as it says it is compatible all over the world. I cant wait to receive it and enjoy it as i did when i saw it at the movies. the voices are spectacular, the setting for carmen really works, the cast is fabulous and did i say what spectacular voices you will hear?. and beleive it or not even sung with all the click sounds famous in this south african language, nothing of the musical quality nor plot is lost. this  really is a miraculous piece of work. I cant wait to receive it and play it again.",1383091200,,994,3.896551724137931
8153409,5,B000JVT23G,"This brilliant adaptation weaves Xhosa, a South African language, together with the musical score in ingenious ways. South African dance and culture becomes a part of the story in a clever, careful adaptation that is a pleasure to watch. If you are totally unfamiliar with Carmen, you will still enjoy this film and the stellar performances. If you know Carmen, this film will put a fresh spin on the classic.

Operas have been translated, adapted, and updated in many ways, but it is rare for an opera to be recorded in an African language and set in an African culture. This adaptation gently leads viewers to re-examine their assumptions about opera, language, and art while it pays high respect to South Africa, Khayelitsha township specifically, and Bizet's original.  It is well worth buying because you will want to watch it more than once!",1376956800,,847,4.916083916083916
8153410,5,B000JVT23G,"A rich, focused production of a woman's story as written by Bizet, set in modern day S.A., the Townships.  The music and voices are superb and deserve more exposure; the acting is intense and gripping.  Power relationships between men and women are explored and inequalities are revealed.  Given S.A.'s difficult and violent culture regarding its women, Bizet's observations at his time still hold today.  A wonderful production of an eternal story this side of heaven.",1363132800,,469,5.213333333333333
8153411,5,B000JVT23G,"I took a real chance on buying this dvd, but my gambling had a great payoff. This is a much better retelling of the opera Carmen than the more famous Carmen Jones.  It combines the classic Bizet story and music with South African locale and customs. Carmen herself is quite a big woman, but she exudes sexual appeal and charm. It is one of the best opera dvds around and for such a bargain price!! I plan to order multiple copies in the future to give out as gifts. Delightful in every respect!",1267315200,,494,4.311827956989247

8153413,4,B000JVT23G,This movie was well done!! The cast was very talented and the story which had a contemporary theme made it enjoyable to view. I wish there were more movies as this. U-Carmen may well establish a precedent for more movies like it. Good work!!,1223251200,3,241,4.5
8153414,4,B000JVT23G,"Drug smuggler Carmen cannot choose between her beaus-policemen and pays with her life for such a deed at a landscape of post-apartheid South Africa, under tunes of immortal ""Carmen"" by Georges Bizet.

It is a funny educative entertaining movie of modern independent post-""England-developed"" Africa.",1216512000,3,298,5.7727272727272725
8153415,5,B000JVT23G,I saw this when it was released at IFF and it was fantastic- I've been waiting for it to come out on DVD- it's subtitled in English- but it's so good - that just like live Opera - you forget about that after a few minutes- it's a well done production- nothing amature about it - Paula has an amazing voice,1211932800,2,305,4.016393442622951
