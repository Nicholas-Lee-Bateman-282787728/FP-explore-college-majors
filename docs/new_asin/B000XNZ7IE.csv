8228778,4,B000XNZ7IE,"Strong Frontline documentary about kids under 18 who are given life sentences without parole.

Its shocking to see the story of these kids, for whom the punishment is clearly out of line  one is an accessory to a murder, not the killer himself.  Another murdered his parents  horrible of course - but was being physically beaten and sexually abused.  Many clearly had inadequate council.

And it turns out the U.S. is party to an international treaty on human rights that specifically outlaws the use of life without parole on minors, but has begged off, saying its only used on cases of the worst of the worst; kids beyond any hope of rehabilitation who will always be a danger to society.  But as the kids profiled in the show demonstrate, that is clearly far from the case at least some of the time.

The show also points out that the U.S. has over 2200 kids serving a life without parole sentence.  The rest of the world combined? 12.

The filmmaking isn't anything that special, and I wish there had been more detail about some of the cases, even if fewer were reviewed, but theres no questioning that there is something terribly wrong in the sentencing part of our legal system, and this film will open your eyes to it.",1416441600,,1225,4.577981651376147
8228779,1,B000XNZ7IE,"Ms. Bikel makes absolutely no effort to present the facts of the cases she examines in a balanced, accurate, and truthful manner.  She deliberately suffuses her work with falsehoods and questionable statements recited as fact, and presents every contention made by her convicted subjects as the gospel (or better, perhaps, ""her gospel,"" from which she preaches quite broadly).  The fact that police reports, investigative proceeds, eyewitness accounts, collateral witness statements, and court transcripts contradict these contentions seems to be of no issue to her.  While it may be legitimate to debate the appropriateness of life sentences without the possibility of parole being given to young murderers, this documentary contributes nothing of value to that debate.  A pronounced and self-proclaimed ideologue, Ms. Bikel brings her brand of blind, fact-averse advocacy to a topic that is actually much better treated without it.",1312761600,,933,5.642857142857143
8228780,5,B000XNZ7IE,"I teach Law & Society and Sociology to high school students.  One reviewer didn't like the talking heads in the video, but I did.  They had substantive, meaningful things to say and among them offered the perspectives of parents, child perpetrators, victim's family, and attorneys/legislators.  What I believe my students will find particularly interesting is the strongly represented interviews of the youths who committed the crimes.  My students will listen to them tell about their experiences and perspectives on being caught in a bad situation with no way out.  In addition, the documentary provides a subtle confirmation that children really do not comprehend the nature of the crime they are committing -- one of the reasons we originally separated juveniles from adult criminal justice systems in this country: teenagers are not mentally mature enough to comprehend what they're doing in a way that should make them responsible in the same way that we hold adults responsible.  Furthermore, some of the youths profiled in the video illustrate the trap in which they are caught by abusive parents and social services unwilling or unable to help, leaving the youths no way to avoid the sexual and physical abuse they are required to suffer.  Why should youths who fight back against such abuse be punished by spending their whole lives in prison when we as a society fail our responsibility to protect them?  The video does not address what I see as a separate category of juvenile crime, that encouraged by the problem of gangs' criminalization of children.",1256256000,5,1565,5.109803921568627
8228781,3,B000XNZ7IE,"The whole thing is sad.  Instead of lasting the typical 60 minutes, this program was 1.5 times longer.  It showed 5 cases of Colorado males serving life in prison for crimes they committed before reaching their majority.  These convicts are no angels, but the point is that serving time forever seems harsh for ""dumb acts done by dumb kids.""  A lot of the inmates faced sexual abuse at home and sensitive viewers may want to be careful watching this.
The work tries to address both sides.  It interviews a mother of a victim who said her son's killer should serve life.  I can respect her stance.  However, she repeats ""My son was such a good kid!""  Well, then why was he buying a gun!?
The work condemns the felony murder rule.  This rule says you can be punished for murder when you commit one of about seven crimes where you can guess that murder might happen.  A prosecutor said although she enforces it, she doesn't think it should exist.  At the moment I disagree.  Too many criminals say, ""I didn't mean to kill anyone when I robbed that bank!"" or ""I just want to hurt someone with a long knife, not kill them.""  or ""I just wanted to violate her, not kill her!""  The crime is designed to discourage people from committing stupid crimes that can lead to death.  It doesn't seem like a useless law if you ask me.
The work speaks of how current events can affect individual cases.  One inmate is named Eric like one of the murderers at Columbine high school.  He asserts that similarity hurt his chances in court.
I'm not sure how much of this show is Colorado-specific or moot as tough-on-crime laws have been relaxed.",1245974400,4,1623,4.5034246575342465
8228782,3,B000XNZ7IE,"While I found this DVD documentary to be interesting, I am not sure it will work for what I intended.
I am a high school teacher at a continuation high school. I will be doing a unit with my classes on juvenile justice. I thought this PBS video would fit right into my lesson plans. However, after reviewing it, I found it to be too long on ""talking heads"", and too short on action. I fear that if I played it in class, my students would quickly get bored with it, and lose interest. So, sadly, I am stuck with it. I might give it to another teacher, at a different, more advanced, school.",1239840000,,589,4.175438596491228
