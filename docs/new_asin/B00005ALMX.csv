1413760,4,B00005ALMX,"Well, just try to not be so lame ^_^ Hakaider (aka hakaida) is the evil guy from the early '70s kikaider (kikaida) live shows...so find a coment about terminator,mad max even alien (1979 If I remember it well) is a bit absurd :) Also note that power rangers are a poor (american)version of other oldie japanese ""tokusatsu"" heroes.
Japanese old character concepts are very imaginative. This is a '90s point of view of an old badass turned into anti-hero. It's big, It's bad, and it's gonna blow away anyone who cross it's path. Also the movie is spiced with some goth,ciberpunk and religion concepts,making goodie-scouts look as not too good boys (same to evil ones in this film)Film plays with black and white concepts. Amusing future action movie that is not a matrixspawn being :)",1025740800,6,782,4.8
1413761,3,B00005ALMX,"Hakaider is one strange film, but it also appears to be gleemed from several sources. I identified things from ""Spawn"", ""The Road Warrior"", ""Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome"", ""Terminator 2"", ""Alien"" (1 and 2); the list continues ad infinitum. The odd thing is that after a point, all these elements fuse together to be owned by this film in it's own right.
The sets are fantastic, some of the most engaging I've seen (even better than some movies with much larger budgets).
However, the one thing I had a problem getting around were the robot costumes. I kept getting the feeling I was watching the Sex Pistols version of ""The Mighty Morphin Power Rangers"".
This film is large on action and short on believability, not to mention the very bad job on the English subtitles. There were points where the translations made no sense what so ever, sentences were left unfinished and even a very few times when there weren't any.
I spent about [price] retail on this, which is a fair price for this film. Any more than that and I would have been pretty PO'd.
This more of a kids movie, but with some of the graphic violence, consider first what you want the kid exposed to. I won't let mine watch this till she turns 14 atleast.",1014336000,2,1216,4.557077625570776
1413762,4,B00005ALMX,"Okay, I am a little biased because i'm a huge Kikaider and Hakaider fan, but i have to say this movie was actually pretty good for an early work.  They revamped the suit to make it a little more sleek and well, more menacing. The atmosphere prett dark, which was actually a pleasant change for me.  Hakaider, who gets awakened by robbers, sets out to jesus town where he fights police androids and meets up with a resistance group.  Hakaider takes to a woman in the resistance group; when they are found and almost everyone is killed (except for the girl of course), Hakaider decides to take vengence and heads to the head quarters to fight Michael (or Mikhail or something) to the death.
I really don't call this a feature because it's surprisingly short, but the action is there and will have you slightly giggling through some parts of the movie because of it's wacky violence.  There was really no character development in this movie, maybe due to the fact this movie was shorter than trip to the toilet.  What was kind of funny was that they really didn't explain exactly who or what he is, except for that sketchy little story at the end.  I still have no idea if that is Professor Gill's brain or not, since they revamped the whole origin, i guess not.  Also, for those who have seen the series, you can see Kikaiders head in the final confrontation between the two machines, it was an incredible laugh, which makes me wonder, when is there going to be a cool Kikaider movie?",1011744000,5,1482,4.507462686567164
1413763,4,B00005ALMX,"The Hakaider (Mecanical Violator Hakaider) is a strange film, a huge success in Japan, this one will not satisfy every expectation. The main charcter of the film itself the cyberwarrior Hakaider is somehow cool and disturbing. Other characters are flat and badly played. Not that rhis wouldn't be fun. Story focusses on a fictional future where a godlike government rules a desolate city with an iron fist. The leader is an enigmatic angellike megalomaniac without any mercy. The hakaider wants his head. So the battle begins. Always on his motorbike he drives around and kills the angel's soldiers, often in a cruel way. High Speed action and some nice effects for a japanese budgeted movie. From the director who brought you Zeiram 1 and 2 and Future Ninja. See one and you kno'w &eacute;m all. It's a sure hit for SF-Action fans who won't expect Armageddon.like proportions,",994896000,2,877,4.9727891156462585

7935387,5,B00005ALMX,"From the same director of the short Kamen Rider ZO movie, this movie takes the anti hero of the Kikaider series and throws him into an Dystopian future found in a good number of 80's movies.
While the movie itself isn't without its flaws, it's an overall enjoyable movie with decent action and nice suit design. (Also do not watch the dubbed track, unless you want a laugh or too)",1426896000,,380,4.442857142857143
7935388,5,B00005ALMX,"Best Anime I seen lately.  I'm an old kikaider series fan and a collector too.  I recall Hakaider being so bad in the original Kikaider show: gave kikaider a hard time and the occasional beat down.  If the battles actually were scored by points, the hero would always lose.  This movie is post apocalypse and they uncover him and set him free on the world( forgive them they know not what they've done) Not a bad thing, when you see the movie you'll understand.",1406419200,,461,4.4523809523809526
7935389,3,B00005ALMX,"It was recommended as I really like Zeiram, but Hakaier is a Churchy Cult Hater and a Hero Type that is virtually unstoppable, but the characters were nothing to write home about and the level of CGI was Low and Budget Low.  I just got finished watching GodZilla 2014.... OMG, Great Sci Fi and Special Effects with 100s of Engineers, Stunt Men and CGI Graphics.... in 3D no less.
Surprisingly takes place more so on the Left Coast of the USA.  Hakaider is OK, but I won't be running back to my HD Sony CD Player too soon to replay it.",1401753600,,534,4.2772277227722775
7935390,5,B00005ALMX,"like that kikaider's rival gets his own movie dub is pretty good, but the sub is better closer to what they wanted excellent dvd",1382227200,,128,4.375
7935391,4,B00005ALMX,"If you think it would be a good movie to see the Japanese terminator fighting awkward storm troopers with some of the most amazing yet confusing visual effects there have ever been in a movie, then this is the movie for you.  Hakaider has many impressive visuals, entertaining action choreography, and if you're into it; unintentionally hilarious dubbing. This film, written and directed by Keita Amameiya, was written for a Japanese super-hero movie show, where he also displayed two Kamen Rider movies, J and ZO.  Keita Amameiya took his love of tokusatsu super-heroes and made what can only be described as an anti-hero art film about an android who destroys whatever's in his way.  Hakaider himself is based off a villain from an older 80's live-action series, Kikaider, which itself was re-made into an anime and broadcast on the popular cartoon network program, ""Adult Swim.""  The theatrical cut of the film is a much shorter, more compact version that is actually a more entertaining film, despite the fact that the director's cut adds more action scenes, because they add absolutely nothing to the story being told.  That being said, this movie has a very shallow story in general. It seems like you can count the number of spoken lines in this movie between your fingers and toes.  If you're into sci-fi movies with lots of action and entertaining visuals, this is right up your ally. It's not the most intelligently written film, but it's a for-sure entertainer for action and sci-fi fans alike.",1306886400,2,1505,4.928853754940712
7935392,4,B00005ALMX,"One of the first lines in this movie was ""Blow the Gate!"" Only they weren't blowing a gate...It was a giant metal door. English voice dubbers are Idiots! Other than the lame voice job, this movie was very entertaining. If you are into robots and fantasy & such. The Michael robot was one of the most beautiful robot suits I've ever seen in a movie. The dream sequence of the main girl character(never caught her name) was also beautiful. Her fairy wings, and that gnarly old tree, then the ghoul that rises from the ground. Wow. They could make a movie just based on that dream sequence! The rest of the movie is your usual gun fights, Cycle chases, then at the end we get some cool stop motion animation. It's not Harryhausen, but any stop motion is Okay in my book! I love stumbeling upon movies like this. I just wish Hollywood would try something different and unique like this. What happened to all the American dreamers?",1254441600,,926,4.517857142857143
7935393,3,B00005ALMX,"I dug this flick.

For the uninitiated, this movie falls into the Japanese tokusatsu genre, which in this case means it's a sci-fi/fantasy special effects film.

As for the content, it's cliche, the acting is bad and half of the effects are downright laughable.

That said, I did enjoy the movie, mainly for these two reasons:

1) I totally dug the character designs.  They rocked.  Watching two bad-arse looking robots duke it out made the movie worthwhile.  Fans of Japanese sci-fi and toku character design will dig these guys.  (As has been said before, watch for the Kakaida ""cameo"" at the end.

2) Length.  This movie is the perfect length.  It clocks in at 77 minutes and that's all it needs. Quick and to the point!

You probably already know if you are interested in this flick or not, but if you can swing the steep price tag, are looking for some cheesy fun, and aren't turned off by the length, I dare say you'll enjoy this.

Recommended for genre fans, all others need not apply.",1178928000,,992,4.568181818181818
7935394,3,B00005ALMX,"Japanese use the term tokusatsu films for what we might call 'special effects' films.  Our closest equivalent would be the unending Startrek series (with the addition of some robots in latex suits.  The term covers a wide range of sins, from the complex ongoing Super Sentai series to pleasantly simplistic (and violent) films like the one under discussion here - Hakaider.  Jinzo Nigen Hakaider (Mechanical Man Hakaider) is loosely based on a previous tokusatsu series about Kikaider - an android superhero.  He was one of the villains in that series, but in this film his body is discovered by treasure hunters and is reanimated.
At the start of the film we find the camera following a dark figure wearing a menacing samurai mask as he rides a modernistic motorcycle into Jesus Town.  In this post-apocalyptic world, the android finds itself siding with rebels.  His opponents are Gurjev, a mad ruler and his android associate, Michael.  This is one of those films where the good guy looks like a bad guy and the bad guys are all wearing white suits.  The simple plot follows Kikaider as he enters Jesus town and comes in contact with the rebels.  When Kaoru, a beautiful young raider, falls afoul of the regime, Hakaider builds a full head of steam and takes on the entire establishment in a series of ever more dramatic confrontations.
This is the second of Keita Amemiya's films, and while it is better made (and less silly) than Zeiram 2, this is the Amemiya film with the least amount of plot and character.  Instead it's capital is special effects, costumes, and violence.  All of which it does quite well for a low budget thriller.  Once again Amemiya demonstrates a flair for scene setting and character design.  The downside is his penchant for vacuous dialog but, in the light science fiction of its time, perfection was not an option.
There is a great deal of strong Christian symbolism in the film, which an American viewer may find misleading.  As in Evangelion, one has to remember that the Christian framework is as mysterious as the Japanese mystical framework is to us.  Amemiya uses Christianity to add mystery and a sense of the occult, not to advocate and religious position.  The film is meant to be enjoyed, particularly with a good supply of popcorn, not to make an indelible mark on cinematic history.",1089849600,12,2327,4.809045226130653
