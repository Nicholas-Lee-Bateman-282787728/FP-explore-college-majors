2289311,5,B0009G56LS,"I remember this film from when I was a child, it is absolutely brilliant and I have to make a third purchase now because the last time I bought one copy for my friend and one for me.  I have since had to give away my copy to another friend and her children because it is so loved - and I don't begrudge buying it again!!!!  This film stayed in my mind from my childhood in the 70's and I still love it, 30 years on.  It is charming, atmospheric, melancholy and funny - Diana Dors is wonderful in it, and you cannot help feeling sorry for poor Mr Blunden. Not just for a rainy day (but particularly good on a rainy day!), this is one of the best films you will ever see!  (I get a shiver down my spine just thinking about it!)",1186272000,10,725,3.9793103448275864

2289316,4,B0009G56LS,"British actor-director Lionel Jeffries who helmed the far better and more successful ""The Railway Children"" (adapted from E. Nesbit's novel) in 1970 next tackled this film for children and their parents, in 1972. The film works most of the way but gets bogged down from time to time with too many empty scenes between the children (not as appealing as Jenny Agutter, Gary Warren and Sally Thomsett in ""TRC"") and their dull mother. The magic and the ghostliness which are the raison d'etre for the film are underused and used too late to eradicate the yawning moments. Nevertheless this is a sweet and good natured film which should have been better. Laurence Naismith is more sinister than likeable as Mr Blunden, but look for an underused Diana Dors. Still worth watching.",1380412800,,773,4.908396946564886
2289317,5,B0009G56LS,"I have been searching for this film and finally found it and purchased it immediately. I can't wait to see it again,it's been years since I first saw it. I saw it only once years ago and it has stayed with me all this time. A worthwhile purchase and an enjoyable movie.",1378512000,,269,4.1923076923076925
2289318,5,B0009G56LS,Great film brought back lots of Memories. Had to sort the language to English. Diana dors does not sound right in German,1351814400,,120,4.5
2289319,5,B0009G56LS,"There are things you remember from your childhood as clearly as the day it happened; watching this movie is one of those for me.  Finding it on DVD made not just my day but my week.  I was so impatient to see it that I took two hours more than my usual hour lunch break to watch it.  The first time I saw ""The Amazing Mr. Blunden"" I was home sick from school; I absolutely loved it, to the point I just wanted to see it over and over.  Of course this was long before VCRs so the only way to watch something was when it was scheduled.  For months I went through the programming guide to find if it was showing that month (drove my mom crazy because I circled every time I found with Crayons), often sneaking downstairs at 2:00a to watch it.  I bet I watched it a dozen times that first month alone; in fact, I saw it so many times that I could (and did) recite a scene before the characters said them.  Which probably explains why I tended to get caught watching it at 2:00a!  I was limited to watching it when I came across it on TV, finally ordering it on VHS from a shop in London in the mid-80s (not an easy thing to do back then!) and have missed seeing it since the tape wore out in the early 90s.  In my family we watched this the night ""The Wizard of Oz"" ran on TV (instead of Dorothy and the Munchkins) and on major holidays when the family was all together like Easter, Thanksgiving and Christmas, as well as on birthdays (birthday slumber parties were weeked-long movie fests at my house) and any time there was nothing good on the few stations we got without cable.  That's how much we liked it and we went through at least seven copies, each one breaking from over use!  My dad was smart enough to make copies for us to watch instead of the original, otherwise it wouldn't have lasted ten months, let alone the almost ten years we had it; I bet we'd still have it if the machine hadn't broken the last time he went to make a copy and shredded the original tape.

There have been a lot of movies that have a very similar plot: finding redemption by changing the past.  But ""The Amazing Mr. Blunden"" has always stood out to me because it's a one-shot deal, not ad infinitum a la ""Groundhog Day.""  And there's no ""Back to the Future"" time travel gimmicks: no delorean with a flux capacitor, no photograph to show the consequences of mucking about in the past, Mr. Blunden does't go back with the kids to be their guide nor does he tell them what they need to fix.  The kids have to figure out where and when they are, then what they're supposed to do there and how to do t when they can't be seen.  They're ""Nancy Drew"" and the ""Hardy Boys"" meet HG Well and Charles Dickens, including the morality tale frequently written by both men.  So many movies from the 70s haven't held up well because of a weak story or ridiculous effects and some have been so horribly remade or ""updated"" that the original is long forgotten.  I am so grateful that neither applies to this movie, especially being remade!  (Naturally having said that there will be remade and updated versions on Syfy, ABC Family, two different versions - probably premiering the same night - on Lifetime and Lifetime Movies, a mini-series ""event"" on A&E, a very adult ""based on..."" series produced for one of the premium channels and three different theter releases this year and a Broadway musical adaptation next year, just because I've said that!)  What a way to ruin a childhood memory, but at least it's in color and not black and white; I can't stand to watch a Shirley Temple movie because no matter what format it's in all I can see is the beyond awful (47 on a scale of 1 to 10 for bad) colorized versions my mom used to make us sit through.  Part of the charm of this movie is the slightly ""worn"" feel of it, the colors that appear to be fading in some spots and the audio that sounds a little tinny now and again.  It makes me feel like I'm in my childhood bedroom.

Could the quality be better?  Absolutely!  I don't think this has the quality of a movie digitally remastered from an original copy, but that's just my opinion.  There's a real race going on to save old movies like this before the celluloid disintigrates because of how and where they were stored; it could be that there isn't a good, clean master to make a DVD from for this movie if one wasn't stored in optimal conditions.  Still, I love this movie enough to say: ""Even a bad copy is better than never seeing this movie again!",1330300800,4,4476,4.291319857312723
2289320,5,B0009G56LS,"Our family really likes this movie and have watched it over and over for years (my boys are college age and we still watch it sometimes).  Not sure what it is that makes it special--the timey-wimey stuff or the British accents or the sometimes tongue-in-cheek comedy, but we like it.  It has an old-fashioned feel to it and a delightful ending.",1295481600,,344,4.622950819672131
2289321,5,B0009G56LS,I couldn't believe someone actually had this item! Thank you for being so specific I had no clue on the different formats and with out your clear desciptions I would have purchased something I couldn't even view.  Quick service too!,1278374400,,232,4.8
2289322,5,B0009G56LS,"The English edition is called ""The Amazing Mr Blunden"".  I've seen some complaints about the print quality of the English edition, so I bought the German edition.  The sound quality and contrast on this edition are pretty good.  There are no interviews.

The story is really sweet and I've been watching it over and over for years, since the 1980's.  It's a
Christmas ghost story, set in 1918.  Dickensish but not preachy like Charles Dickens.  Lots of fun
characters!

You'll need a region-free DVD player.  Philips sells a portable unit that has a code you can use to make it region-free.  The best DVD software I've used on a computer is called ""Power DVD"", I've played French movies on it and gotten to subtitles that the Philips unit didn't find.",1261699200,3,751,4.707692307692308

8060245,4,B0009G56LS,"First saw this on local Pay cable station Prism almost 40 years ago. Starring Hammer Film babes Lynne Frederick, Madeline Smith, and(then too young) Rosalyn Landor. But the jump cut just before the end credits cuts out the cast either alone or in pairs saying ""Goodbye"" to the camera(including characters that were just horribly burnt to death, with Diana Dors flirting it up.)
 So terrible this was cut. It's my favorite memory of the movie. Think I have full version taped off cable.",1509840000,,485,4.843373493975903
