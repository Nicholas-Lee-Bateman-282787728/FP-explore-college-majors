Thundering hooves and a flashing  sword herald his presence  ... a slashing ""Z"" marks the triumphs! Guy Williams stars as the legendary  masked hero in this classic action-packed adventure from the  original Disney television series!

The stern and imposing Andres Basilio (Everett Sloane), the king's emissary from Spain, announces the reason for his visit: an elaborate money-raising program utilizing so-called Royal Bonds. And a tough-looking enforcer is present to ensure that the dons and businessmen comply with Basilio's demands. Don Diego, sensing an alternate destination for the money, decides that Zorro  is desperately needed to investigate the legitimacy of the financial program.",1102896000,6,757,5.530434782608696
7962209,4,B0000665SK,"Of all the Zorros who have slashed through the screen, the one everyone in our generation refers to (including Bandaras) is Guy Williams, who captured a nation from 1957-1959 in Walt Disney's Zorro TV series.

The few commercially available videos from this series are mostly from the less interesting second season, but of that season, the ""Man from Spain"" episodes are one of the better arcs in that once again, some nasty public figure is oppressing the people and trying to outwit Zorro - and this one nearly does.

Guy Williams, perhaps the most handsome man ever to grace television, provides a seamless, roguish interpretation of this masked hero, always with a brilliant grin and a twinkle in his eye.

Other commercially available episodes feature the popular child actress Annette and a version of the early episodes in the first season, but alas, drained of much of the series' humor and charm.",1102550400,8,905,4.940789473684211
