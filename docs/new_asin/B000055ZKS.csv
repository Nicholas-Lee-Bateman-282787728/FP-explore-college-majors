7931507,5,B000055ZKS,"I have used these videos for several years with kids from elementary to high school in my comedy/improv classes.  The clips are classics and feature some of the best comedians to ever grace a stage, screen, or radio studio.  None of it is vulgar--these people were funny without it!  My students and I have especially appreciated the ""Slapstick"" video, with clips featuring Jack Benny and Rochester, Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis, Abbott and Costello, Sid Caesar, even Orson Welles in a send-up of radio comedy.  My own kids have seen these a dozen times, but my son still couldn't wait to open it when it arrived! I would advise anyone who enjoys comedy to get this set while you can still find it.  I wish it would come out in DVD!",1261008000,2,731,4.549618320610687
7931508,5,B000055ZKS,"When I moved into a new apartment in 1997, I found this box set sitting in the closet, unopened.  Why the previous person left this box set of 3 VHS tapes behind, I have no idea.  (Keep in mind that this was September 1997: DVD players had only been available in the US for 6 months, and while streaming video certainly existed people normally had 56k modems.  So VHS was still in overwhelming use.)  Oh well.  It was my gain!

This 3-tape set was put out by Readers' Digest.  It's pretty much all ""G"" rated material, but lots of funny stuff none the less.  Obviously there's no way to include every single person's favorite comedy source, but they sure do a good job cramming a lot into these three 1-hour tapes.  The three tapes are ""Slapstick"", ""The Unexpected"", and ""Favorite Moments of the Stars"".

You'll find live performances from comedians like Mel Brooks, Dick Van Dyke, Red Skelton, Burns & Allen, Spike Jones, Bob Hope, Abbott & Costello and Jack Benny.  There are movie clips ranging from Charlie Chaplin all the way to The Naked Gun.  There are also a ton of selected TV clips from Martin & Lewis, Happy Days, I Love Lucy, All in the Family, Saturday Night Live, The Carol Burnett Show, Family Ties, etc.  ""The Unexpected"" includes a number of bloopers from live TV, actors flubbing their lines, etc.

For folks who might not have even recognized half of the names in the last paragraph, this is a great introduction to these great comedians and what made them great.",1234742400,2,1481,4.581749049429658
