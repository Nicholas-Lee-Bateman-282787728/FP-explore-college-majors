8280997,5,B001B1875C,One of the greatest movies ever made.  This is the single yakuza film that everyone must see.  Gosha at his finest.,1434067200,,115,4.428571428571429
8280998,4,B001B1875C,"The Wolves is a gripping tale of Seji Iwahashi (played brilliantly by Nakadai) a yakuza freshly released from jail who returns to his old gang which has allied itself with another main gang. Seiji was put in jail for murdering a yakuza boss (the boss of the gang that has allied itself with his gang) therefore there is some tension between him and their men. Yet Seiji does everything he can to hold the fragile truce together: in one scene a vengeful gang member attempts to kill him yet he disarms him and tries to end the conflict without death even asking forgiveness afterwards. Seiji is an old school yakuza upholding the yakuza codes and finds himself out of place from the new yakuza around him. real life yakuza boss Noboru Ando gets a main role as a retired yakuza boss and two women killers add a real menacing and expectant edge to film. Admittedly after the opening the plot meanders slightly before finding it's grip and hurtling straight into a gripping finale. Hideo Gosha's direction is brilliant throughout but the film boasts some very memorable scenes: the opening, the festival at the end and finale. Well worth watching this yakuza-period piece is well worth getting hold of in Animego's brilliant transfer. (Review from <...>)",1346630400,,1250,4.818604651162791
8280999,5,B001B1875C,"Wonderful movie, memorable dialogue, very powerful characters, impeccably shot. Tatsuya Nakadai is in great form, and even though he does not manage to save the day in the movie, he manages to give us a hint of what a ""Japanese Al Pacino in Godfather I"" is like. Not to be missed.",1329177600,,280,4.509803921568627
8281000,3,B001B1875C,This movies is Ok but not up to the level that you would expect from the other reviews,1280275200,,86,3.8333333333333335
8281001,2,B001B1875C,"Beware the rave reviews found here and on the packaging of this movie because they simply are not accurate.  This is not a good yakuza movie and here is why:  It's long, it drags, its melodrama is tawdry and it's contextually confusing.
Part of the reason for this mediocrity is doubtless because the movies was made in the early 1970's when French cinema was still taken seriously.  Interestingly, rather than have the actors engage in extended dialogue as many French films of the time and indeed today do, the director chose to go the other route of filling the movie up with extended shots of actors mooning lugubriously when they are not acting painfully overwrought.  Unfortunately saccharine sentimentality and cartoon violence (most notoriously by two particularly incompetent kimono-clad females who attack their intended victims with umbrella-swords) overwhelm this underwhelming movie and make it hard to watch, impossible to enjoy.
The story evolves around the treacherous attempts of one yakuza clan to take over another and, when the treachery is exposed, how the victims react to the knowledge.  While the story-line itself has great potential, this project fails miserably to entertain.
To reiterate, the problem with this movie is that it has a fractured/disjointed story that reveals itself in pieces, but at such an excrutiating pace that one ceases to care after a while; when the actors aren't staring morosely off into space whilst mooning for one another, or engaged in fending off the attacks of the knife-wielding geisha girls, they aren't up to much of anything else (apart, of course, from the obligatory finger amputation and brotherhood ceremony).
The lesson one takes away from this is that gangster movies aren't fertile ground for art films, and perhaps that 1970's art films don't make for good art films anyway.
In any event, this is not a movie one should like to watch; if begun it isn't likely to get finished.",1250380800,5,1947,5.090909090909091
8281002,5,B001B1875C,"Having gone thru most of the available samurai movies, investigating the historically more recent yakuza genre has been surprisingly satisfying. Similar Nihonjin values of manhood demonstrated by proficiency with violent skills and fighting spirit. Tatsuya Nakadai is of course one of the masters of displaying this and the supporting cast is excellent and noteworthy. The plot includes rival gangs(of course), released cons going straight(yeah,sure), creepy female assassins, extreme man on man combat, and a seaside country town setting. I prefer Gosha's character developed treatment of yakuza to Fukusaku's inner city shooting assassination merry-go-rounds. This is one of Gosha's best IMO.",1235433600,4,694,5.95
8281003,4,B001B1875C,"Not going to go into the synopsis of the movie, as the other reviewers have covered that quite well, but I must say I was rather pleased with this movie despite the lack of reviews all over the internet. Nothing new in terms of making cinematic history but Gosha does a fantastic job in illustrating the cause and effect of the yakuza code of honor, respect, & loyalty. Shot on the Shimokita peninsula, Gosha captures some beautiful scenery while at the same time illustrating a rather dark tone to the film. You hardly get a sense of a potential ""happy ending"" despite some promising moments. The characters are defined well enough in that you know which ones will clearly fall due to either their greed, stubbornness,pride, thirst for revenge, or trying to maintain the yakuza code. The fighting is simple but to the point. There is a good sense of realism to them which I can appreciate versus those horrible HK type frame cuts(I know, not a fair comparison but you what I mean). For those that may feel the pacing is slow in some parts, I think the final scene(s) make up for it.

Spoilers/questions ahead:

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Can anybody explain why the 2 female assasins killed a woman referred to as Aki? Also, why didn't Iwahashi kill the character played by Tetsuro Tanba?

Fans of the Yakuza genre should pick this up. I think you will be pleased with it overall. Great presentation by Animeigo.",1231113600,3,1528,5.128514056224899
8281004,5,B001B1875C,"This is an intensely cool movie.  A dark and brutal power struggle between two rival gangsters, this is no slick action fest but more of a Shakespearean slow decimation of power. It is, quite simply, one of the best yakuza flicks I have every seen.

Directed by Gosha Hideo (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sword-of-the-Beast/dp/B000AQKUGI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sword of the Beast</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Three-Outlaw-Samurai/dp/B0006Z8FWE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Three Outlaw Samurai</a>), the movie trudges through the underworld of Japan's gangster society, the yakuza.  Unlike many Japanese genre films, this one starts with a quick bang and then switches gears to a more personal battle.  Filmed two years before the seminal yakuza epic&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Battles-Without-Honor-Humanity/dp/B0002V7O1A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Battles Without Honor & Humanity</a>, you can see some of the groundwork being laid here for the film that would transform the genre forever.  Although ""The Wolves"" is not nearly as groundbreaking as some that would follow it, it is genre done to absolute perfection.

""The Wolves"" (""Shussho Iwai"" or ""Prison Release Celebration"") is set at the dawn of the Showa Era, when the new Emperor granted amnesty to over 400 prisoners in celebration of his ascension.  One of these men is Iwahashi Seji, played by master actor Nakadai Tatsuya (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Harakiri/dp/B0009WIE2A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Harakiri</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ran/dp/B000BB14YY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ran</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Yojimbo/dp/B000K0YLZ0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Yojimbo</a>).  Iwahashi must deal with the fact that his former master is now dead, and the power structure has swung in balance to a rival ganglord.  Moreover, Iwahashi's best friend, Tsutomu, has disappeared following the pardon and Tsutomu's girl Aya is about to marry the rival ganglord.  All his time in prison has been for nothing, and now he must determine his course as one of absorption or revenge, of accepting things the new status quo or striking out like a wolf.

Much of the power of this film is visual.  Gosha has taken some interesting risks, going away from the splashy and fantastic and into the gritty and realistic.  A fight scene is not one man leaping and slashing with a blazing sword against countless foes, but two guys struggling desperately for one knife, rolling in the dirt and putting everything they have into it knowing only one will walk away.  The colors are muted, and there is something about the entire film that seems like it has been soaked in mud.  But in a good way.

The use of music is also outstanding.  Decades before the release of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hero/dp/B00030590I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hero</a>, we have two men battling in intense action with no sound other than the mournful twang of a shamisen.  ""The Wolves"" features a powerful score, with contrast of ""speed of music"" and ""speed of scene"" being a prominent theme.

The Animeigo DVD release did a fantastic job restoring this beautiful and important film.  The picture and sound are great, and the subtitled track is done in the unique Animeigo style, where cultural ""footnotes"" and projected as well, providing a basis for some aspects that may be confusing to Western viewers.  I have seen this format before in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wakeful-Nights/dp/B00124SNFC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wakeful Nights</a>, and it really adds to the enjoyment of the film as well as being a study guide to the Japanese language and culture.",1220400000,15,3945,6.548076923076923
8281005,5,B001B1875C,"Have not seen this new DVD release, so cannot comment on this version.  I acquired the VHS widescreen version of this movie over 15 years ago.  Personally, Gosha and Nakadai are the most powerful Japanese director/actor duo in film history (Kurowsawa/Mifune fans I beg forgiveness.)  The Wolves is terse, detailed, stylish and entertaining.  I cannot wait to see what quality this transfer is.",1218585600,5,393,5.190476190476191
