8237724,1,B0010E6J6O,"This movie is so BAD as to defy description...BAD acting, BAD script, and VERY BAD direction...This is NOT how the Korean War was fought. You can tell this is a very low budget picture with unknown actors...it really shows.
This is the story of a soldier who leaves his wife to work the family farm and goes off to Korea. Two tanks and their crews get separated from the main body of tanks during the retreat down the peninsula. They get attacked by the enemy (you don't actually SEE them but are supposed to imagine they are there because guys get killed). One of the crew commits suicide because they are lost and he doesn't want to try to survive, another kills another member of the crew, they find an enemy alive and take him prisoner (turns out it's a woman in disguise), more enemy attacks, they run around lost some more, and at the end all are killed except the woman prisoner who after the war goes to visit the wife of the crewman who rescued her and gives her the man's diary.....what a bunch of baloney..!!!........for a real idea of Korea see the movies...""Pork Chop Hill"", ""Fixed Bayonets"", ""Men In War"", and ""All The Young Men"".....but avoid this one at all costs..!!",1206316800,4,1183,4.5327102803738315
8237725,4,B0010E6J6O,"One of the best and well-crafted low-budget films of the past ten years. Vincente Stasolla's ""The Forgotten"" belongs in the same category as Darren Aronofsky's ""Pi"" and David Gordon Green's ""George Washington""--small films with big ideas. As far as war movies go, this is a film that can hold its own with the likes of ""Tigerland,"" and may even warrant comparison with ""Paths of GLory.""
""The Forgotten"" follows a group of American soldiers trapped behind enemy lines as they try to survive, while their new leader, Cpt. William Byrne, tries to maintain the morale of his platoon; he tries to keep own faith and sanity by remembering what's back home. Beautiful cinematography (from Learan Kahanov) helps to generate claustrophobia; the reported budget was $20,000 (plus, in what has to be the find of the decade, two free tanks), but several observers have commented that it feels like much larger-budget movie. The film won several awards at film festivals; the only reason I can think of that it didn't get more attention is the lack of big-name stars. Well worth your time, and will probably generate repeat viewings.",1204416000,3,1120,4.994652406417113
