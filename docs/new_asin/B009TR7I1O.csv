8544267,3,B009TR7I1O,"While this film has some value for its humorous portrayal of a man's life, for me it did not live up to the high ratings I had read.  Definitely not in sync with the modern era, outdated.  In choosing to view this film I was influenced mainly by the director Lubitsch.  In this case I felt let down.  Ameche's performance, however,  was very professional and worthy of praise.",1467158400,,376,4.470588235294118
