8426277,5,B004DXZHX0,"I just saw this two-part series on BBC TV, in Washington State. It was great,as usual - featuring the wonderful Martin Clunes and his own dogs,too. I previously read the companion book he wrote, which is just as entertaining and informative,and does have some photos.
  Clunes circles the globe in search of various breeds of dogs and their relatives,delighting in his encounters with wolves,dingoes,wild dogs of Africa,sled dogs and the ever-delightful menagerie he shares his home with! More on his own pets in his book, but watching Arthur, his black Lab, at Obedience Class and shows is hysterical! The photography is lovely and the encounters with the wolves are breathtaking.

*I am sorry to tell you that at this time, the DVD is only available for Region 2 DVD players. One can purchase a multi-regional player for a modest price,but I really wish they would make some for our Region 1 - US viewers.",1362182400,5,907,4.876623376623376
