Even the scenes in the car looked like somebody was shaking the car and it looked so fake.  I wish I had never purchased it.  It was an absolute waste of my time. Stupid plot as well.",1331942400,3,288,4.0
8499215,3,B006J75ZWG,"Filth to Ashes Flesh to Dust begins by showing three people trapped in a room while the killer sharpens his blade.  It looks like two of the people are dead whereas only one is alive and roped around a pole.  The lone survivor speaks!  She mentions something about being a princess.  You can be my princess hun!  Oh look at that.  There's another survivor.  A girl named Katelyn.  The roped woman tells Katelyn to close her eyes even though it's gross.  She says she can't because the sight of a deceased woman lying beside her just looks too amazing.  Nah she doesn't say that.  The woman tells Katelyn there's a guy in town she'd like to introduce her to but at first, we have to get out of here!

Katelyn frees the roped girl but the killer comes back so she pretends she's still tied up.  The killer drags the dead girl out of the room.  We now see a man driving his girlfriend somewhere as they talk about geography.  She thinks one country does't exist called Turkestan.  It's real!  Back to the two surviving girls in the room.  The killer steps on the face of the one girl who tries to run.  The same girl who was tied up earlier.  He smears his foot across her face like she's a bug.  She's gone.  If you think about it, this is possibly the most ruthless yet easiest way to kill someone.

Back to the two geography loving teens.  When they pull over to use the bathroom the boyfriend thinks about ways to propose to her.  Suddenly we see a woman scream in the car.  Just then his girlfriend appears... and a man with a knife is holding her hostage!  The boyfriend says ""If you want to kill someone just take me"" but... the killer's obviously not interested because he instantly kills the guy's girlfriend.  He then wrestles the boyfriend but not before a woman with a huge club swings at the killer.  I think he goes over the cliff.  Is the boyfriend actually naming countries while his girlfriend's dying?  This is NO time for a geography test!  She's too busy trying to survive for any of that silliness!

One year later.  We see teens partying in a swimming pool.  The one girl takes her top off and cooks on the grill.  I'll take my meat well done!  Actually no, she's not cooking on the grill.  She thanks her friend's father for allowing this graduation party.  The girls talk about this life they're currently living being a distant memory in 6 weeks while the guys reflect on the past and the one guy's current girlfriend.  The boyfriend insists he loves his girlfriend and can find a way to make it work.

The teens have car troubles and can't leave their fancy homes and swimming pool, but they manage to find rides with other teens.  In the killer's room we see a teen girl wake up with newspaper all over the floor.  A man comes into her room, hangs her upside down and rips the paper off her body as she screams in pain. What the?  That's not painful!  Well wait, there's red swollen marks on her back afterwards.  Maybe it is painful.

They go to the home of the troubled guy who needed a ride earlier.  He reveals his parents are dead.  Meanwhile a black girl tells a guy she needs her grades to improve and she fears she won't be able to pass the course.  The blonde girl walks into the troubled guys brother's bedroom and the other friends follow.  The brother say ""These people aren't your friends"" when his troubled brother says he's just inviting some friends over.  They look at a picture frame of a murdered woman.  She was a victim of a schizophrenic psychopath.  The killer thought it was his duty to build a perfect society and cut out the cancer such as drug addicts and the weaklings.  The killer died.

The one teen comes up with an idea.  He thinks the black girl struggling with her college class should write a report on the killer to help her pass the course.  He wants his group of friends to visit the site where the killer did his killings.  The group calls it one final adventure before they separate and go to college.  The troubled guy who lost his parents sits around in his garage depressed.  When he hears something he grabs a wrench and walks around.  There's someone here alright- a hot girl who pops up behind a car!  She wants to know if he remembers her.  She says she's clean and asks if he works here.  Uh, he lives here!  This is his home!  The troubled guy yells at the girl and says she deserves to die.  A man walks in and wants to know what happened to his car because he can't find the keys.

The teens all head to the desert.  They exit their cars and run up the hill.  The troubled guy who lost his parents runs into his brother's bedroom but can't find him.  The girl from the garage shows up to the front door with a shotgun and when the troubled guy gives her a weird look she says ""I uh, live in a rough neighborhood!""  Back to the group of teens.  The one girl criticizes her male friend for not driving.  She says he'll never be able to hook up with her friend because he doesn't drive.  How mature!  They arrive to an abandoned building and head inside.  The one girl describes the killer as someone who writes his victim's names in blood.

These teens say the dumbest things while exploring this dark place such as ""You're insecure"", ""You're academically challenged"" and ""You're a nice girl Kimmy- the kind that would just be fun!"" when they should be fearing what lies ahead.  Just then the killer appears and beats on one teen from behind.  He picks him up and tosses the teen to the ground hard boy!  The way the black girl screams is the only believable moment of the movie, and when she gets something tossed in her eyes her scream sounds just as tragic.  The remaining teens manage to crawl away through a hole.

The guy who get slammed down hard survives, but he's weak.  His girlfriend encourages him to get up and go.  One boy stumbles right into the killer's hand and says ""I love you Kimmy!"" before the killer slices his head off.  A teen has a dream he's approaching a woman in a field.  She says ""Why didn't you save me?"" before jumping awake.  The woman with the shotgun and the troubled guy who lost his parents arrive to this building at night.  Cheesy line alert- when the guy says ""I hope you're wrong"" the girl pumps the shotgun and says ""I hope you're right!""  You have to see this scene to grasp how silly it is.

Instead two teenage girls get emotional.  The black girl says to her snobby friend there is no help around and says ""You've been insulting me behind my back since I was 5 years old"".  She then cries that the killer blew something in her eyes and she can't see.  The snobby girl sees something approaching as the black girl screams that she can't see.  She demands to know what the snobby girl's seeing.  A moment later the killer shows up and strangles the black girl, then punches her around.  I mean punches a  LOT!  Eventually the snobby girl comes to her rescue by smacking the guy with a metal pole.  They run away.

They run up to their male friend.  Suddenly the male friend smacks the black girl with a pole and says she's a wounded duck.  By this point whatever was blown into her eyes is deteriorating her face.  The male friend says he brought the teens to this building on purpose.  He says we're taught everyone's equal in high school, but we're better.  He says the big battle is coming- the strong vs. the weak.  Just then the killer appears from behind.  The male friend says ""I'm ready to walk with you"". The killer grabs his throat and twists his neck, allowing blood to drip out of his mouth.

The other male teen has another dream he's making out with that woman he apparently couldn't save.  He wakes up and a girl speaks to him about her being a rich girl with too much privilege.  She hit Hollywood when she was 12.  The male teen says he was a mother's boy right until she died, and his father died a year later.  So he had to raise his brother.  The girl reveals a horrible story.  She was at a party in a big house with people dancing when her uncle took her to a room with several men.  Her uncle said it was a special day.  He locked the door and let's just say, the term ""pass around"" took on a whole new meaning.

The snobby and black girl look for a way out of the building.  The black girl notices her face is getting worse and screams there's no way out.  She says that kid who smacked her was right- she's not strong.  The snobby girl says ""Because they called you names when you were a little girl?""  When the snobby girl asks the black girl to help find a way out the killer appears and grabs the black girl.  The snobby girl smacks him hard with a board but he grabs her by the throat.  As the black girl runs away he tosses a knife into her back and she dies.  The snobby girl gets away.  She discovers the room where the teens we see in the beginning of the movie were kept with newspaper everywhere.

The troubled guy who lost his parents and the woman with the shotgun walk around outside.  Come to think of it these two never entered the building until now.  They were sitting in the car or walking around talking the whole time.  The one quiet guy from the group becomes a victim of the killer as the killer smears his knee into his throat when suddenly the teen's blonde girlfriend appears.  She says ""Look at him moving like an animal.  He doesn't belong.  You have to make things right!"" she adds.  She pretends to be on the killers good side but you can sense the nervousness in her voice.  The quiet guy uses this opportunity to smack him in the back with a shovel.  Just then the shotgun woman appears and smacks the killer in the back of the head.  The killer grabs the gun and points it at the troubled guy who lost his parents.  The woman with the shotgun gets her throat cut and dies.  The killer then throws her face into the curtains as he pushes his foot down on the troubled guys chest.

Outside the blonde haired girl and the snobby girl hold each other and get emotional.  The snobby girl says she used to call her ""Little Kimmy Bear"" as a kid.  She says we'll have more parties.  Unless the killer walks outside that is, and he might!  From this angle it looks like the killer can easily grab the two girls by the hair from behind and yank them up.  The two brothers walk outside the building.  The one brother decides to head back inside to see if anyone's still surviving.  The other brother says he knows when their parents died a part of him (his brother) died as well.  That's why he's able to run back inside and look for survivors.

Speaking of the killer, he's outside!  He grabs the blonde girls leg and tries to pull her in.  Just then he sticks his fist through her stomach.  She dies with blood dripping from her mouth facing the direction of the snobby girl.  The snobby girl is so traumatized by this point you can't help but want to see her make it out of here.  For some odd reason the killer doesn't kill the snobby girl despite having the chance- he heads back inside the abandoned building.

The killer walks outside looking for the remaining teens.  If he finds them he'll sure have plenty of meat!  The teens make the mistake of hiding behind the car because the killer is able to sneak up behind them.  He flips the one guy over and slices his throat with a knife but he's able to retaliate and stab the killer in the leg.  The three remaining teens take their turns beating on the guy but he's so strong!  He just tosses them to the side.  He grabs one teens arm and throws him into the car, then kicks him a few times.  The other teens disburse.

The killer stabs the teen in the stomach and kills him.  The snobby girl and other brother then beat the killer down.  The teen who was just stabbed (the other brother) gets up and punches the killer to the ground as the snobby girl stabs his forehead for the final blow.  The brother who was stabbed dies and we see his ghost stand up and walk to the girl he was dreaming about.  They hold hands for a second then she lets him go.  The end.  Wait wasn't it the other brother who was dreaming about this girl?  And why did she let him go and walk away?  Is it because he's still alive and had to go back to human form?  The movie just ends without these answers!  Bad ending!

The characters aren't too memorable and the abandoned place the teens are trapped in isn't that special, but the biggest problem with this movie is that it has really good suspense and killings, but a bad story.  Early on when the story switches to teens partying in a swimming pool the story took a huge nosedive in my opinion, and never really recovered.  Meanwhile the killer is tremendously vicious.  I would still recommend this movie though but barely.",1501977600,,12675,4.313775510204081
8499216,1,B006J75ZWG,"A group of friends go to a place where a serial killer killed his victims but find that the location is not empty. The story however, is. I know a lot of slashers don't have much of a plot but still manage to persevere. Typically through creative kills, loads of gore and lots of nudity. This movie doesnt have any of that. So what are you left with? Really poor acting (sometimes grating), incredibly slow direction and just total boredom for an hour and half. After watching so much horror, I have to wonder why some people even bother. The thought at a quick buck before the internet reveals that the movie is nothing but trash? Theres no respect for the genre here, this movie has next to nothing going for it. I cant even recommend this to the most hardcore slasher fan. Aside from some decent, and wasted, production value, this movie is a complete waste of time.",1436745600,2,869,4.471698113207547

8499218,4,B006J75ZWG,"Filth To Ashes is one of those modern mythos that comes along that manages to create a pretty cool, new, horror legend. The story plays on actual social issues without over thinking the power points or falling apart completely during execution of the plot. It creates an emotional and heartfelt atmosphere that allowed me to connect with the characters save one- I really didn't get kick ass-cracked head girl. I got her story and why she was f*cked up, I just didn't get the portrayal of her that way right up till the end. I would have bought her obsession with Purge more if she would have been a bit sober and more realistic. Aside from that aspect the rest was acceptable enough to be convincing personalities in the film.

Now the real thrills. The special effects and action/kill scenes in Filth To Ashes hold there own to any contemporary indie horror and had enough chilling intensity to make me feel sad about the characters dead while being thrilled to see the carnage unfold. I am a conflicted horror fan- I want to fear for my characters on screen and yet I want to be thrilled by their death at the same time. The killer in this film is one I would either run from screaming or sh*t myself and die instantly-he was brutal, intense and almost unstoppable. (Sequel news pending). This was a real good horror flick that I thoroughly enjoyed and would recommend for any horror fan who likes a slasher flick with just enough story to get us through the kill scenes without falling apart. I compare it to Laid To Rest but without a mask.",1432598400,,1545,4.537634408602151

8499223,1,B006J75ZWG,"I know... just because a movie gets a bad review doesn't mean that *you* aren't going to like. I think the same way. Let me just stop you right there. I'm going to tell you just how bad this movie really is - I have NEVER written a review on a movie before. An exception had to be made for this... ""movie.""

This is by far, THE stupidest waste of film I have ever had the displeasure of sitting through - and I am a fan of low-budget B-movies. The ""stars"" couldn't act their way out of a wet paper bag if a gun was held to their head. Not that that would matter in this movie [SPOILER ALERT] because the one time that the good guys actually do have a gun, all of the idiots use it - not as a gun - but as a freaking HAMMER. Not one character has the intelligence to pull the freaking trigger - they just hit the bad guy with it!

By the end of the movie, I was hoping that the bad guy would come out of the screen and put ME out of my misery! If you are looking to kill a few brain cells, you've got three options - drink a beer; get stoned; or watch this garbage...",1357862400,4,1066,3.863013698630137
