The show depicts fictional characters in Dublin's criminal underworld, John Boy Power played by Aidan Gillen (USA's - The Wire) and Darren Treacy played by Robert Sheehan (BBC's - Misfits).  Nidge played by Tom Vaughan-Lawlor, reminds me of Robert Carlyle circa Trainspotting.

There is a decent enough synopsis on Amazon.

There has been critique that the script was too ""slick"" and that the actors to ""clean-cut"" to be true Dublin gangsters.  Having never had contact with Irish gangsters (outside of the IRA gun sellers on The Sons of Anarchy), I can't offer comment.  However, I found both the script compelling and the acting spot on.  In the real world organized crime is generally anything but.  In support, there is a scene in the first episode where Nidge is learning firearm use and maintenance via a YouTube video!

While Gillen has already made his bones on American TV, I would predict that Sheehan is soon to follow.

I challenge anyone to not watch the entire first season in 1-sitting!
