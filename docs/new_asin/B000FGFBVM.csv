2564564,5,B000FGFBVM,"This Holiday movie is excellent.  Gerald McRaney, Andy Griffith and Naomi Judd make this a very homey Christmas movie for people of all ages!  I truly enjoyed watching it again this past month!  I recommend it to all who love the Christmas Holidays and viewing Christmas movies.  It is fun to watch even when it isn't Christmas!",1167955200,47,328,4.701754385964913
2564565,5,B000FGFBVM,This is a good family movie or one to make you get in the Christmas Spirit. When you need an uplift watch it any time of the year. Very rememberable and enjoyable to watch.,1167955200,6,172,4.088235294117647
2564566,5,B000FGFBVM,"UPDATE:  This is now also available as one of eight films in a Holiday collection set being sold at a very reasonable price:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/8-Film-Holiday-Collector-s-Set-V-1-with-Bonus-Holiday-Songs/dp/B00JZSJJL4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">8 Film Holiday Collector's Set V.1 with Bonus Holiday Songs</a>&nbsp;REVIEW: Whether it is sold under the title ""A Song for the Season""  or ""A Holiday Romance"", this is a cozy, stress-buster Christmas season movie.
It has held up over several viewings for me.  All of the actors are very good, as is the story.  Naomi Judd's Lily Waite is just the kind of teacher you would have wished to have, or would want for your child.  The
often under-rated Gerald McRaney is perfect, as is the entire cast.  The small town setting of Bethleheim will make you dream of moving from the suburbs, or city.  A perfect, ""let's relax with a cup of cocoa"" holiday movie for the whole family.  Also, if you are a teacher, this one will inspire you to give it even more.",1165795200,90,1052,5.490683229813665
2564567,5,B000FGFBVM,"I received the DVD very quickly--very good turn-around.  It was in excellent condition, as the seller advertised.  Trust Amazon to supply a product we could not find in the retail market locally.  The video tape we made from the original TV airing no longer works, and we are glad to be able to enjoy one of our favorite holiday movies again! The DVD is even a slightly extended version!",1292889600,,387,4.579710144927536
2564568,4,B000FGFBVM,"This movie has been watched yearly by our family for several years off of a VHS tape that was recorded when the movie was shown on TV.  It's such a great movie with the multiple themes: father/son relationship, teenager dealing with the loss of her mother, a teacher wondering what would have happened had she stayed with a band, and the issue that always upsets me because it is so true in real life -- school budget cuts and the first to go is music (choir and or band) and drama (Mr. Holland's Opus ring a bell?) but athletics will only be cut when the school closes.

Decided to look last year for a DVD copy on Amazon and was directed to alternate sellers.  Family_Films was the only one listing a NEW copy.  It was high at $21 dollars (compared to other Christmas movies) but I ordered it.  I started watching the movie as soon as it arrived in the mail.  Was surprised and upset that the movie was edited at one spot.  There was nothing wrong with the scene. It's actually cute.  It's where the Principal gets so excited that Gerald Mc's character has come to save the school that she hugs him. That's the only cut-out that I noted, but it spoiled watching the rest of the movie.

This year I noted that there are other sellers for the same movie using a different title (A Song for the Season) which is the title of the movie I have on VHS, and they have it for about half the price.  I'm tempted to order one of these, just to see if I get the whole movie.

Finally, others have commented on the teenagers voice quality.  While it may not be the best, the final song always brings tears to my eyes.  I'll back the DVD up to listen to the song several times, but you have to listen to the message, not the delivery.",1284681600,4,1723,4.248466257668712
2564569,5,B000FGFBVM,"Such as wonderful holiday movie some exceptional acting by Naomi Judd,Gerald McRaney and Andy Griffith and by the young girl in the movie as well. I do not know who she is I never looked for her name but she can sing as well as act. If you are a fan of any of these actores or singer or a fan of wholesome family Christmas movies I highly recommend this one!!",1257724800,,359,4.070422535211268
2564570,4,B000FGFBVM,"I purchased this as a gift for my sister-in-law who is pretty picky on what she watches. The seller stated it also went under the title ""A Song for the Season"" which meant nothing to me since I thought I was purchasing the ""A Holiday Season"" pictured in the listing. It came as a surprise when I received ""A Song for the Season"" with a different box cover than the one shown. I shipped it off anyway as a gift and it took 3 viewings before my S-I-L agreed it was the same movie and stopped complaining that I sent her the wrong one. If you think you're getting what's pictured you may be wrong and I wasn't about to pay to return yet another item listed incorrectly or even go through the return process. There should be some way for a seller to advise you if you're not going to get what's pictured... even though the contents may be the same movie. It could go under 12 different titles but when you see the pic on Amazon that's the cover you expect to receive.

I also didn't realize the seller would start spamming me with their movie listings nor that there would be religious messages on the back of the cover. Some sellers offer a ""sanitized"" version of movies to meet their standard of acceptance but I really didn't appreciate that not being noted in the seller's comments either. I gave the seller a poor rating but the movie would have been 5 stars had it arrived with the box cover shown and absent the religious messages.",1257638400,,1434,4.350746268656716
2564571,5,B000FGFBVM,"A lovely heart warming holiday movie for the whole family. I purchased it because I enjoy all the star characters, & was pleasantly entertained.",1239062400,,144,5.041666666666667
2564572,5,B000FGFBVM,"Having been a musician in my 'days', this movie reminds me of my own wonderful High School choir director.  I never fail to shed some tears each time I watch it.  I've bought several copies to give to friends and family and I highly recommend it.",1229126400,,246,4.326086956521739
2564573,5,B000FGFBVM,"This was more than I expected it to be.  It is a story about a small town and of friendship,  family,  love, and the true meaning of what Christmas is all about.  Be sure to have a box of tissues near by when you watch this.  The acting is wonderful.  The music is  wonderful.  The sparks that come from Naomi Judd and Gerald McRaney is so great and of course the wonderful Andy Griffith. This is a movie that the whole family should sit down and watch together.",1226188800,3,462,4.170454545454546
2564574,5,B000FGFBVM,This is wonderful.  It is a start of a romance along with putting a family back together and teaching about understanding in a family and of course it is a Christmas movie.  I have enjoyed it over and over and you will to.,1224633600,,222,4.1395348837209305
2564575,5,B000FGFBVM,"We saw this movie on T.V. and loved it and searched and searched to find it on DVD, and were so glad to finally find it, now we can watch it all the time.. The song that Naomi Judd sings with Alison Pill is absolutely beautiful!!!!!!! We love it!!! Play it over and over.....Wish it was available on CD...This movie is definitely worth watching.....",1218844800,2,349,4.46875
2564576,5,B000FGFBVM,ONE OF MY FAVORITE CHRISTMAS MOVIES. SOMETIMES I WATCH THIS OTHER TIMES OF THE YEAR. WISH THERE WERE MORE  NAOME JUDD MOVIES.,1212451200,,125,4.681818181818182
2564577,5,B000FGFBVM,This was one of my favorite movies when it was on TV and my taped copy was not that great.  Loved the fact that I could get it now on DVD.  Any one who loves the Judds has to get this.  Niaomi does a wonderful job.,1202428800,,214,3.608695652173913
2564578,5,B000FGFBVM,"Great Christmas movie, Great romance and story, Acting was not the greatest but will watch over many times again.",1202428800,,113,5.0
2564579,5,B000FGFBVM,"This Christmas movie is a great family show. A teen who has moved from town to town, just like her uncle did as he was growing up... He is a hatch-man for the school board, and like most needs to cut the Music Program to make ends meet. Schools should go a long way to keep Music Programs in place. The reunion of the B-17 crew was predictable, but heart-warming. Andy Griffith, Naomi Judd, Gerald Rainey... What a great cast!",1201651200,5,426,4.3375
2564580,5,B000FGFBVM,"A cute, clean Christmas film that ends on a positive note.  If you're looking for a WOW movie, this one will not offer that as it is more of a light-hearted, everyday, feel-good film--doesn't have a lot of deep, emotional drama which makes it nice to watch if you're just looking for a way to spend an hour when the weather keeps you inside.  It's nice to still have a few movies to watch where one doesn't feel like they need to take a shower afterwards!",1196294400,4,455,4.27906976744186
2564581,5,B000FGFBVM,"A good story, although I wish it were a bit deeper, and a sweet romance in the making. Family friendly and safe.",1181347200,2,112,4.136363636363637
2564582,3,B000FGFBVM,hard to review something that hasn't been delivered.  Ordered on 2/5/07 and asked to review.  Go figure,1173312000,,103,5.0
2564583,4,B000FGFBVM,"Yes, if you're looking for a feel-good movie, you should definitely get this one.  Darrah Cloud knows how to put together a story with bang-up endings, and this movie with its two story threads has two great endings, back-to-back.

But there is some bad news.  Naomi Judd (unless of course you're a fan of hers) is not much of an actress here.  Her scenes look more like a personal appearance, with lines.

The daughter is cute and believable.  The uncle is also credible.

The love story is totally botched.  The pacing is disjointed.  And there is a lack of motivation.  It is simply not credible, so don't expect to be touched by it.

Andy is Andy, and he adds a touch a quality that makes the others look more amateurish than they otherwise would.

The rock music (and the absence of Christmas music) was a bit grating.  It was sad that the school kids couldn't relate to any Christmas carols.  They had to have rock.  The raw, harsh tone of the girl singing what were supposed to be Christmas songs was a dischordant note for me.  Others might not be bothered.

Still, I say don't miss it.  There aren't that many that you can afford to pass it up.  Darrah Cloud's ""A Holiday for Love"" is a much better movie, so if you're only getting one, get that one instead.",1171497600,34,1267,4.430434782608696
2564584,4,B000FGFBVM,"I really liked this Christmas movie, but I don't understand why the identical movie has two different names.  The new principal (hatchet-man) has come to Bethlehem to revamp the high school and falls for the music teacher who is helping his niece.",1169683200,5,247,4.880952380952381
2564585,5,B000FGFBVM,"These days it's hard to find a good, family movie that tells a great story without being too sentimental at the same time.  I really enjoyed the way Naomi Judd brought out the best in Gerald McRaney and his niece.  This was a heart-warming movie of many triumphs.",1169078400,9,263,4.458333333333333
2564586,5,B000FGFBVM,"The acting in this is supurb, as is the story. I was greatly surprised at how good it was. It's a great Christmas story, adorable love story, and just a great movie to watch all year, not just at Christmas.  I have definitely added this to my annual Christmas movies to watch.  I have to admit, I've watched it several times since Christmas has been over!!  You'll love it!!",1168214400,28,374,4.391304347826087
