8186538,5,B000OT6V1Y,"Read the reviews before I bought this Gem, and could not believe that people not knowing seeing Denis Leary's stand up is not going to church and if you cant handle great comedy then this is not for you, don't think i stopped laughing though all of it and the extra behind the seen is priceless. If you have a sense of humor this is a must have. He is what comedy is all about. From his classic A**Hole song to the early years left me wanting more.",1357257600,,448,4.1022727272727275
8186539,5,B000OT6V1Y,"Like the title says, it's Denis Leary on DVD. It's hilarious, and includes some great behind the scenes stuff. A bit more expensive than I paid for it a while back, but still worth the money if you're a Leary fan.

Oh, and he likes to curse. A lot. If you're easily offended, you should probably just avoid this and browse the My Little Pony DVDs instead.",1347408000,,355,4.298507462686567
