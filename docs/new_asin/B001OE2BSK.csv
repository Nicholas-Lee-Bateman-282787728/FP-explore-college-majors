8506607,4,B001OE2BSK,"Nicely done. For those who like Arnaldur Indridason's detective Erlendur serie, I think you'll find yourself well  immerse in his Icelandic universe. The four stars only reflect the limited choice in language as it only offers subtitles. I prefer dubbed versions.",1470268800,,263,5.414634146341464
8506608,3,B001OE2BSK,"Excellent adaption of the book.  This edition advertised is in Icelandic with French subtitles only, so you better brush up on your French before buying this edition. No English sub titles.",1413331200,5,189,5.096774193548387
8506609,4,B001OE2BSK,"""Jar City"" is an Icelandic-made dramatisation of the original Icelandic crime novel, ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jar-City-Mrin-The-Mire/dp/0099541831/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jar City/Mrin (The Mire)</a>"", by Arnaldur Indriason, in a production screen-written and directed by Baltasar Korm&aacute;kur. It dates from 2006 and features an all-Icelandic cast, with Ingvar Eggert Sigursson in the lead role as police inspector Erlendur, Bj&ouml;rn Hlynur Haraldsson and &Oacute;laf&iacute;a Hr&ouml;nn J&oacute;nsd&oacute;ttir as his junior colleagues, Sigurur &Oacute;li and El&iacute;nborg, with &Aacute;g&uacute;sta Eva Erlendsd&oacute;ttir as Erlendur's wayward daughter, Eva Lind. This production is in Icelandic only, with English sub-titles.

The adaptation is reasonably faithful to the original novel, especially with regard to maintaining the individual characters of the principals, although some aspects of Erlendur's life style (and most decidedly his car) have been spruced up somewhat, and Eva Lind is also considerably less wild than she comes across in the books. The main casualty in the screen adaptation is the plot itself, which in the book has a clean simplicity, which just takes time to unfold. Time, of course, is exactly what films don't have; in condensing the story for a 90 minute running time, it has, ironically, been made more convoluted and involved (and thus less than believable) with two key events from the book having been preserved for the film but now actually making little or no sense. It has also had a dramatic addition which adds nothing but a bit of excitement to an other rather pedestrian story.

By and large, however, the production makes for atmospheric viewing, with just enough lightening of the mood from the performances of Bj&ouml;rn Hlynur and &Oacute;laf&iacute;a Hr&ouml;nn (perfectly judged never to descend into comedic acting but often funny nevertheless) to counter Ingvar Eggert's dour and brooding Erlendur. Filmed entirely on location in Reykjavik and its surrounding areas, the film carries a gritty authenticity, for all that it features far more of recognisably tourist Reykjavik than does the book.  The film also differs from the book with the addition of a dark vein of black humour running through it, mostly centred around a running joke either about Icelanders' eating habits or else at the squeamishness of foreigners over those habits (it's had to tell which!) It is surely no accident that in a film which features a man who has been battered to death with an ashtray, the exhumation of a 20-year old grave and a secret collection of preserved body organs, and various other seedy goings-on, the most grisly scene is actually of Erlendur consuming his take-away boiled sheep's head?

All in all, then, lovers of Nordic noir should find this film right up their street and every bit as dark and gloomy as the book, with the added advantage of Icelandic scenery to look (and shiver) at every now and then. Lovers of the Erlendur books need not shy away for fear of having their impressions spoiled by any clumsy adaptation here. It also is well worth a look if you're hungry for something a little different from off the beaten track.",1390176000,2,3251,5.496
8506610,5,B001OE2BSK,"The film runs quite true to the book and the actors are wonderful. Sigurdur Oli is hysterical!  It gives a bleak picture of life, but one that provokes thought. I also liked seeing Erlander eat the sheep's head.  I wish they made more films of this mystery series. It doesn't disappoint like most American films do.",1370995200,2,315,4.607142857142857
8506611,5,B001OE2BSK,This is a very intelligently written and directed film.  It has stories that weave around each other that all come to a climax at the end of the film. Great character study of people in a small cultural situation.  Moving and very thought provoking.,1276732800,,249,4.636363636363637
8506612,5,B001OE2BSK,"I've become interested in these North country mysteries.  I loved the Millenium Trilogy by Larsson, both books and films, so thought I might enjoy this Icelandic one as well.  I did.  This was as much a fascinating look at Iceland as it was an Iceland mystery.  We start out with a young man who is a geneticist.  He researches genetic diseases and is enmeshed deeply in one while his daughter lies dying of a genetic disease. This seems unrelated at first to a middle aged police detective who is trying to solve the murder of an older man who was killed in his home by way of blunt force trauma.  Turns out he also had a brain tumor and lo and behold, so did his daughter who died of 4 of it.  Jar City refers to where the brains go after autopsy from this kind of case.  The bodies are buried with the organ missing.  These various threads start to come together as the investigator puts the pieces together.  The Iceland country is rugged, gorgeous yet often stark.  There is a modern, spare design to everything which fits this terrain.  If you've been watching Kenneth Brannagh as Wallander, this film and the films of the Larsson books are much, much better, perhaps because they are totally authentic.",1265068800,5,1209,4.52073732718894
