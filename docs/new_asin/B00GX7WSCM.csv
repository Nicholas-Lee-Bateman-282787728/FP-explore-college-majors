6123264,5,B00GX7WSCM,"""You Will Be My Son"" is a remarkable film. The French have a knack for plots and this one delivers. The self centered  Vinyard owner thinks to entice another man's son to take over instead of his own son who he sees as weak as watered down wine. The film is well acted and the presumptious Vinyard owner underestimates those around him.",1401408000,,336,4.419354838709677
6123265,5,B00GX7WSCM,"Most interesting twist to the plot line adds new meaning to the title of this well-filmed movie.  The scenes look like postcards, and it is difficult to realize that they are real places.",1398384000,,187,4.666666666666667
6123266,5,B00GX7WSCM,"Niels Aerstrup plays the vineyard owner  Paul de Marseul; his son has been off the University to study wine making and has returned with an eye to taking over. Meanwhile the head grounds man, Francois, and to be honest the guy with the real know how is dying. The harvest is due in and Paul does not think his son, Martin, is man enough for the job.

Then due to a fortuitous happening for Paul, the son of Francois returns home  hot from the vineyards of the Nappa Valley  this is Philippe. Paul wastes no time in getting him to be a bit more hands on. He soon reveals his full intentions and makes Philippe an offer to come and take his fathers place. Once that does not move him he offers him instead an offer he will find more tempting than a Chteau Mouton Rothschild 45.

This is heavy stuff and no one comes off looking too good. As greed and self interest are laid bare, like temptations in a Biblical tale, so do people start finding that they are not as egalitarian as they may have thought they once were. Once the tenuous truce between father son, wife and friend is broken then there can not be any going back.

I really enjoyed this film it oozes tension and smouldering resentment in a way that a full on thriller would keep you hooked. Arestrup is just excellent and can be both horribly unlikable and yet totally understandable all at the same time. His over looked son never seems to grow a pair and yet you cant help but root for him and his wife is as ineffectual as she is beautiful. There is so much going on here, like a great glass of red that I simply can not recommend highly enough  Im off to find a cork screw.",1396483200,2,1637,4.244372990353698
6123267,5,B00GX7WSCM,A patriarch manipulates his family in this sinister generational saga set in the French vineyards.  Very well acted by Lorant Deutsche and Niels Arestrup.,1392595200,2,154,5.416666666666667
6123268,5,B00GX7WSCM,"I waited so long for ""You Will Be My Son"" to come to the U.S. and I was NOT disappointed!!!!
Summary: A father continues a successful international wine business when his grown son believes he is under-appreciated and under-utilized. The son is ready for more responsibility--in hopes for taking over the business one day--but the father sees only shortcomings and disaster. A neighbor down the road (who works for the father) contracts cancer, which fetches his son from America. In an odd twist, the neighbor's son excels in the wine industry (although he is not yet established), which the wealthy father notices. I won't mention anything else since the developments are fascinating!
Reflection: I've never seen a movie broach the balance between family and business before, and it does a wonderful job showing the perversity of rejecting family for business. The Gilles Legrand's fictional lesson is well-timed in this modern era where one might find posthumous renown/success in industry more alluring than success in the family unit. Of course (like in a lot of French cinema), the acting is phenomenal, and Lorant Deutsch (the wealthy father's son) powerfully portrays the passion and confusion boiling in a neglected son. The themes require honest reflection and digestion. Well worth watching. And buying :)",1386892800,7,1316,5.241706161137441

8628280,5,B00GX7WSCM,Poignant and realistic. Addresses a very real problem when it comes to passing down the family farm. Is the quality of how the farm is managed more important than family and character? Karma is a force that overtakes the best laid plans and human motivation is very complex.,1473379200,,274,4.729166666666667
8628281,3,B00GX7WSCM,"I think this film wanted to be better than it is. The unrelenting contempt that the tyrannical father heaps on his son is the main thrust, and becomes wearying to the audience even as it becomes unbearable for the son. He never misses an opportunity to demean the young man. The setting is a French estate winery that has been in the family for eleven generations--or has it? The complications involve the winery's operations manager, who is battling cancer, and his son, who has moved to California to work in Napa valley wineries, with great success. The father's illness brings that son back to France, and that's when the complications begin to build. Most of the story unfolds in a flashback after the opening sequence,a cremation.",1464652800,,736,4.849206349206349
8628282,3,B00GX7WSCM,It's was a good movie but I wasn't as wowed by anything really. I guess I expected it to be more intense and dramatic! I really wanted to get caught up in the movie! Check it out and see if you like it!,1458086400,,202,3.7209302325581395

8628285,4,B00GX7WSCM,"A fascinating drama that just gets more interesting with multiple viewings.  The characters have contradictory traits and are hard to either fully love or fully hate, to fully identify with or fully despise. Then there is all the talk about wine, wine making and wine tasting.  A fine French movie!",1437782400,,298,4.94
