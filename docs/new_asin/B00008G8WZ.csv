1845687,4,B00008G8WZ,"King of the Cowboys, 1943 film

The film begins with a parade. Roy and his band sing. They are part of a rodeo. The governor summons Roy and his friend to explain their actions in an adjoining state. The explanation is a dramatic story about following the law. The governor has an undercover job for Roy. [Is there a clue in that Private Secretary? Yes.] There is a song, then two women order the expensive 35 cent meal, and tell about their travels. Roy picks up a tip. We see nine dancing girls. There is a mind-reading act, part of ""The Merry Makers"". The Singing Cowboy entertains the audience, and is hired for a week. Businessmen are concerned about the sabotage of shipments. Its time for Roy to sing another song. Smiley learned the mind-reading trick. Roy sees how the questions from the audience can contain a coded message!

The gang of saboteurs take Roy along for a ride. There is a fight in the car! Roy is captured, can he escape? They show how to raise the writing from an impression on paper. Can Roy and his band capture the gang of saboteurs? Will the gang stop the governor with a clever trick? Roy's band sings ""The Red River Valley"". There is comedy in the mind-reading act. Will Roy be framed for murder? Roy tells where the code book is hidden. Can they get Roy out of jail with a magic trick? Will the head of the gang appear with a coded message? Can he be caught before he gets away? Will Maurice tell about the sabotage plot? Will Roy and his band save the train? Roy climbs the bridge to disable the bomb. The steam engine hauls the freight train. The saboteurs shoot at Roy (and generally miss). Roy's band arrives to capture the gang of saboteurs. The governor presents an award to Roy Rogers for his service in uncovering and capturing the gang.

There is no mention of the war here. Most of the Roy Rogers movies were set in modern times, which made them more realistic to the audience. This also showed popular culture as reflected by Hollywood. Roy sometimes played fast and loose with the law; what other cowboys saw the inside of a jail cell from the wrong side? The plots were more complex than some other shows. Most of these old westerns were banned by the 1950s, due to policy changes by corporations.",1275955200,,2242,4.463414634146342

1845689,5,B00008G8WZ,"This was as advertised.  Another reviewer claimed this was Mr Rogers' biography, but it was the movie I expected.  The movie did have a brief biography and filmography for Mr Rogers, Mr Burdette and Trigger.  I believe it also contained a trailer for the film.

Good movie and I was wondering where to find the biography the previous reviewer claimed to have instead of this movie.",1135555200,10,381,4.7272727272727275
1845690,4,B00008G8WZ,"Don`t get me wrong. This is a very fine video - Roy`s biography. the only problem is that it is advertised as the 1943 movie King of the Cowboys, which it isn`t. The back cover shows photos and a synopsis of the movie, but what you actually get is Roy`s biography. Roy[s biography is worth five stars, but if you are looking for the movie King of the Cowboys, look somewhere elsse.",1117152000,4,381,4.305555555555555

This has Roy as the captain of the NV state police, guarding the Boulder Dam, and participating in the annual Las Vegas Heldorado Rodeo, while investigating gangsters (in Las Vegas? Oh my!) involved in Racketeering!

Fun all the way around. This film features Dale Evans and has the usual suspects (Gabby Hayes, Bob Nolan and the Sons of the Pioneers) as supporting cast.

A family safe flick with some mild violence.",1441411200,,442,4.945945945945946
