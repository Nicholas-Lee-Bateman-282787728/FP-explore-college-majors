8120813,4,B000FCGP7A,"This video soundtrack is only in Russian without subtitles. It seems to be a TV production of the popular operetta, Silva with music by Kalman. If you know the operetta, and understand Russian, this is a rare find. Have been looking for this video for years, so I was very happy to find it; It is a DVD for a specialized audience.. That's why I gave it a 4 star.",1377648000,,362,4.185714285714286
