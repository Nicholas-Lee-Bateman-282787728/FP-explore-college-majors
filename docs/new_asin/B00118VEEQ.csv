I bought it specifically for that reason.  He loves watching shows over & over and this a way for him to watch whenever he wants!  These shows are wonderful and we love the addition of Darby, Buster & Lumpy!!",1239667200,,382,4.4
3063347,5,B00118VEEQ,"This is perfect for long car rides or a rainy afternoon. It is kid friendly and absolutely G rated, so you do not have to check on your kids. I like that it is great for a range of ages my daughter is 2 and my son is 7 and they can both watch it. Also check out the Hundred Acre Haunt.",1229126400,,285,3.6129032258064515

3063349,4,B00118VEEQ,"This is a good addition to my 4 year old's DVD libray.  It's sweet and age appropriate, and it held his interest.  Like all Disney DVDs, you have to get through all the Disney promotions to get to the movie, and this is annoying.  Still, the target audience of very young children will enjoy it.",1222387200,,295,4.327272727272727
3063350,2,B00118VEEQ,I was very disappointed when I watched this DVD with my son.  There were 3 episodes and one new one that was very short.  The other two I had seen many times on the Disney Channel.,1207180800,5,180,3.9722222222222223
3063351,3,B00118VEEQ,"My daughter really enjoys the series, but lately has gotten bored of watching the same episodes.

3063352,5,B00118VEEQ,"This and Mickey Mouse Clubhouse are my daughter's two favorite shows on Disney Channel.  Mickey is obviously orientated for the very young while My Friends Tigger & Pooh is better for 5-7 or so, not that younger won't enjoy it as well.  It is not as interactive as some of the other young Disney Channel shows but I like that it repeats the problems solved at the end.  Repetition is so important in teaching!  It is a very cute show and does not bore the rest of the family when my daughter gets to watch it!",1206316800,4,509,4.270833333333333
3063353,3,B00118VEEQ,"My wife and I decided to get this for our daughter. The Pros: it holds her attention as it is her favorite show. The Cons: it repeats many of the same episodes that Disney already airs on TV. The Tigger delivery service, the Darby tail episode as well as a few other we had already seen are part of the DVD. The actual exclusive episode is standard length and it has about an hours worth of preview and Disney commercials....also it loops the menu only stay on for about 2 minutes and then the whole thing previews and all begin again....it works for when she wants to watch Tigger and Disney's not airing it.",1204848000,11,609,4.350877192982456

3063355,1,B00118VEEQ,"Really Disney?  You had to do this? Take a story that is all about the whimsy of childhood and destroy it? This completely ignores the point of the Winnie the Pooh stories. Did the producers even read them? Change the names of the characters to Bob and Joe Super Sleuths and you'd lose nothing.

The accents? Awful. The stories? Terrible. The songs? Don't get me started. The Disneyfication of a childhood classic? When I find Walt Disney in the afterlife, I am going to drag him down to the 9th circle of hell.",1405123200,,511,4.483870967741935
3063356,5,B00118VEEQ,Every child should at least be exposed to a little bit of Winnie the Pooh.  This was good with fun mysteries to solve.,1401667200,,118,4.130434782608695

3063359,5,B00118VEEQ,It has one episode of the super sleuths and two more!!! with a small video and song. Definitely it is a good option but expensive for a kids movie.,1382918400,,147,4.103448275862069

3063370,4,B00118VEEQ,"I will never quite understand why Walt Disney Productions decided to ""breathe some fresh air"" into the Pooh Franchise by replacing Christopher Robin with Darby, as they did in MY FRIENDS TIGGER AND POOH. I understand it even less now having seen the upcoming trailer for the new theatrical movie, in which Christopher Robin seems finally to be given his due. If you already hate Disney Pooh, then shy away from this DVD, as you probably have already from the TV show it's based on.

But... if you're willing to take the TV show on its own dramatic merits, as I found myself doing despite myself when I reviewed this DVD, then you should really like this DVD. Darby and Christopher Robin would be ""best buds"" if only they were allowed to be together. Darby is a sweet, curious, thoughtful girl with a lot of ethics and an enviable ability to wear bright colors. She's also more physically active than Christopher Robin has usually been (this student of Jungian/Myers-Briggs personality types suspects she's an ENFP to Christopher Robin's INFP), and so can deal with Tigger's energy and exploit it in her ""detective work"" more readily. The animation is computer-generated, the action well-paced, and the stories less whimsical than the traditionally animated series starring Christopher Robin and Pooh which came out some years prior to this.

The one real drawback to this collection? In the UK there were two episodes in the series where Christopher Robin was featured, but they have never been shown in the US to my knowledge and you won't find them on this DVD. Too. Bad. Indeed.",1297296000,,1581,4.851851851851852

8241043,3,B00118VEEQ,"Cute movie but the disc had major damage upon receiving. Which I didn't know about because I got this as a gift for my daughter's 3rd birthday party and we didn't watch it till some time after her opening it. Was told we'd have to send it back before they could issue us another copy - completely blaming the delivery for the damage and taking no ownership. Disappointed in customer service. Despite the movie skipping in a couple places, my daughter does in fact love the movie.",1424304000,,479,4.517241379310345
