8139559,3,B000HEYTH4,"The DVD containst interesting footage of the battles of Iwo Jima and Okinawa.  However it is just standard government film shorts and or training films.  Not much was done in the way of post processing of the footage.  They look like they were burned directly from the old 16 mm films with no attempt to enhance them which is a shame since the technology is readily available and inexpensive.
One clip was colorized, and was pretty poorly done. Colors were bleeding all over the place on the images.

There was one clip that was pretty interesting.  It was raw footage, almost like home movies of some GIs relaxing behind the lines.

All in all, I would not purchase this if I had to do it over again.  It was not worth the money.

If you are a war footage junkie, set your recorder to the History Channel and record it from there.",1203465600,3,831,4.421052631578948
8139560,5,B000HEYTH4,"If you've seen ""Flags of Our Fathers"", you've seen Hollywood's take on the epic battle at Iwo Jima.  Now, with this DVD, you can see how it really was...  On this DVD are several amazing movies shot during combat on Okinawa and Iwo in the closing months of World War II.  They are simply jaw-dropping!  Included as a bonus on the DVD is silent footage that I'd never seen before, showing the preparations towards raising the flag on Mt. Suribachi, and immediately afterwards as the troops pose for a group photo.  Incredible.  What's even more thrilling is that this is all in color, and it's not some lame tinted job but real Kodachrome footage.  That alone is worth the price of admission.  But there's other films on here of note, including a film about the epic struggle to take Iwo Jima that has got to be one of the most sobering documentaries to come out of the war.  When you see how brave our troops were, and how difficult and fierce the struggle, it just makes you weep with gratitude for these people.  Our country owes them everything we have today.",1161475200,7,1062,4.513089005235602
