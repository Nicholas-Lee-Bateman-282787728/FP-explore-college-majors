8392778,5,B003A1EM00,"My very first Korean drama watched in 2006 and was my number one favorite for a decade until I watched Nine: Nine Time Travels and then Chuno, two other exceptionally produced K-dramas. So now it's number 3 out of 375 Korean dramas watched since then. High honor. This KBS 7 disc version is the one to get for the best visuals and subtitles. I have several versions culled from other sources and this one remains the best. Splurge, rip backup copies for yourself. Don't ever lose I'm Sorry, I Love You. :)  So Jisub and Su Jeong Im are AMAZING!",1520899200,,544,4.44
8392779,5,B003A1EM00,usually do not enjoy this type of melodrama but the acting was amazing and while the story was definitely a tear-jerker still left me feeling glad that I watched it to the end!,1392681600,,176,4.363636363636363
