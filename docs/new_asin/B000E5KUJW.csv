2491273,1,B000E5KUJW,"UGH! 'G' is a 'rapper' who's well-spoken, educated and tries to act deep(it's actually laughable). Blair Underwood is a turd but gives Sky everything she wants, so, of course, she's unhappy. Instead of Sky divorcing Blair, she turns back into a cheap ho. You can take the pig out of the pen... 'Oh why didn't I stay with broke 'G' in college! Why did I marry millionaire Blair??' Yeah, right. Not one character in this film has an ounce of integrity; the only ones were the individuals I saw leave the theater early. This will probably appeal to young girls and low-income individuals who dream of living in the Hamptons. A total waste of time.",1140566400,5,644,4.608695652173913
2491274,4,B000E5KUJW,"This drama filled movie involves a love triangle.  Summer G, who is played by actor Richard Jones, the handsome Blair Underwood as Chip Hightower, and Chenoa Maxwell as Sky Hightower are the main characters in this film. G is a famous rapper who settles in the Hamptons to be near his former college sweetheart Sky.  Sky, who also lives in the Hamptons is married to Chip, a uncle Tom, conniving, philandering, stock broker.  When Sky and G run into one another at one of his parties, memories of their past love resurface.

Soon afterwards, things began to heat up between G and Sky and  Chip doesn't like any of it.  While G is willing to give up everything he's worked hard for to regain the love he's lost, Chip will do anything to keep her.  A must have in the collection!",1139443200,18,777,4.468085106382978

2491453,5,B000E5KUJW,"Richard T. Jones was a total surprise to me in this move!  I don't see him a lot but in this he was charming and debonair. Charming in a devil-ish sort of way.  But the best scene was when he went ""gangster"" and grab a baseball bat to do a beat down!  That was hilarious!  He just switches from this charming lover-type to gangster instantly! Whoa!

Then there's Blair Underwood! What can you say about Blair except ump...ump...ump! He's the Blair we have come to know and love!",1390521600,,478,4.386363636363637

2491480,4,B000E5KUJW,"Although it doesn't specifically say it anywhere in the movie, this was inspired by The Great Gatsby. It's not a black version of a film adaptation of the book, instead, it's a modern film that has the same theme and elements of that story. The movie is VERY well written, and it has a lot of really good scenes and dialogue. I will admit though that some of the costumes were ridiculous, and a few characters were played by actors who weren't that great, but still, it was fantastic.",1368144000,2,484,4.449438202247191

2491495,5,B000E5KUJW,"This is a movie to watch when you want to see a bunch of beautiful actors, in an even more beautiful setting, entertaining the audience with a very engaging love story. It is sexy, it is hip, and it is addicting.

My only and biggest complaint is that there is no place to find the music soundtrack.  In fact, it is the main reason why I bought this DVD.  Haunting and gorgous, I just wish it was available somewhere.",1342742400,,417,4.253164556962025
2491496,5,B000E5KUJW,"Truly enjoyed this movie,lots of real emotion,very funny also very sad ending though,i watch it often,i love the scenery,would love to visit the Hamptons.

I have never heard of the director, but I am aware of the actors...love Blair Underwood.

Jones is suave, sexy, manly and just frickin chocolaty Gorgeous in this flick...Chenoa is gorgeous, wish we can see her in more films and Blair as usual can Act is A$$ off!  A must have for your collection.",1245715200,,375,4.180555555555555
2491525,4,B000E5KUJW,This movie was better than I anticipated it to be. The acting by Blair Underwood and Richard T. Jones was awesome. I thought the story line could have been much better but well worth seeing.,1229385600,,190,4.457142857142857
2491526,3,B000E5KUJW,"The movie has beautiful people, styling, and scenery. OK acting, a very unrealistic story line, and the over all movie definitely could have been better. I'm not to familiar with the Great Gatsby so that may be why I just didn't get the movie... however it was captivating and kept my attention.",1221177600,,295,4.6923076923076925
2491527,3,B000E5KUJW,"Without negating what other reviewers already have said about the movie itself, let me add that this is a great counterpoint to the Robert Redford version of Gatsby. If you can get past the language (it's pretty rough, especially with several actors' overabundant use of the ""f"" word) and a pretty graphic love scene between Summer G and Skye (though we only see their backs) -- hey, this is a PG, after all -- it's a nice update of the original movie. I show parts of G to my inner-city high school students after we watch the Redford version. They immediately see the similarities and point out the differences, and actually get enthusiastic about the story. G has never failed to help me help my students connect to the original Gatsby. Be careful and judicious in your use of G, but think about using parts of it to help students connect to the original source material.",1207526400,8,874,4.608974358974359
2491528,4,B000E5KUJW,"THIS MOVIE WAS BEAUTIFUL,ROMANTICE, HEARTFILLED,AND SIMPLY VERY ENTERTAINING. BLAIR UNDERWOOD IS A PHENONMENAL ACTOR, HE HAS ALL OF THE REVIEWER HATING ON HIM.

RICHARD T, U ARE ONE FIIINNE CHOCOLATE BROTHER, SIMPLY BEAUTIFUL, WHICH ONLY ENHANCES UR ACTING ABILITIES,WHICH TO ME U R EQUALLY AS PHENOMENAL , VERY TALENTED,GIFTED ACTOR!!!!

2491530,3,B000E5KUJW,It was a nice try. It's a great looking movie but the story lacks depth and orginality. Kind of a soapy ebony romance but it was still nice to see black folks transition out of the inner city. I would recommend the movie but don't go into it expecting too much.,1199923200,3,261,4.137254901960785
2491531,4,B000E5KUJW,"'G"" was a pretty entertaining movie. Beauifully filmed and casted with some gorgeouse black actors and actresses. The story line was current and plausible and reflective of the present Hip Hop times.",1178928000,,199,5.25
2491532,5,B000E5KUJW,I have to say that I just love Richard T. Jones so I may be judging it on him.  But I do like this movie a lot and could watch it everyday.  I have bought it like 3 times already.  Can't loan this one out cuz it's costing me to replace it.,1176681600,,239,3.5576923076923075
2491533,4,B000E5KUJW,"But the ending left me hanging. For the most part the movie was visually stimulating with beautiful actors. I'd like see Chenoa in more movies. I think she's a great actress as well.

Not much else to say, but it was good to watch and I love scandal so it fulfilled that part of my guilty pleasure.",1175817600,,298,4.228070175438597
2491534,4,B000E5KUJW,"I truly enjoyed this movie.  I loved Richard T. Jones as Summer G.  He made me feel his love for Sky (Maxwell).  Not to mention the tension between him and Chip (Underwood) was believable.  I dind't care much for Chip...he's a violent, cheating, manipulative and mean spirited person.  But I guess he represents a large percentage of people.

Sky was conflicted and torn, but it was of her own doing...her own greed is what placed her in the position she found herself in.

Overall, it was a great movie (but are people really as guilable as Tre and Craig?).  Although it isn't quite up there with the best for me, it was engaging and romantic...in a twisted sort or fashion and I recommend others watch for themselves...",1173916800,,721,4.622047244094488
2491565,1,B000E5KUJW,"Not since ""Solo"" have I seen a movie this bad!  Based on the previous reviews that I've read it appears as though everyone else saw a different movie.  My curiosity certainly got the best of me with this one.  The trailer caught my attention, but in the end I was left disappointed by the writing and the acting of several creditable actors.  The bad part is I lost two hours of my life that I can't get back, and that irritates me.  My suggesstion....keep it moving when it comes to G!",1155772800,2,486,4.2967032967032965
2491566,4,B000E5KUJW,"All I can say is wow!!! I just rented this movie from Blockbuster in mid June 2006. I really liked this movie! If anyone has read ""The Great Gatsby"" and liked it, you could really find bits and pieces of that book in this movie. What was very interesting about the movie is the fact that Sky left Summer G during their college years. She didn't believe in his dream of being successful in the music industry, so she went on about her business with some other dude that already had some loot and his career was already in place. No, she didn't love Chip, but the fact that he romanced her and listened to her, this is what lured her in, it was a true player move. Sky comes to find out that Chip was nothing, but a rich player or Casanova. Yes, he had the beautiful wife, Sky, but it wasn't enough. Some men like trophy wives in order to look good. I am saying that with no disrespect, but not all men want that, they want someone to love them and believe in them. Men want to be listened to as well. Chip managed to steal her from another man, Summer G. Sky cheated, bottom line, but ends up being cheated on by the man she had left Summer G for, Chip. Chip is an abusive, cheating, manipulating man. Did you see how he slapped that woman that he was creeping with? How cold was that and did it in front of Sky's cousin. I am so glad that Sky's cousin arranged that meeting with Summer G. He opened up a whole different game of creeping. He figured if Chip was creeping around on his beautiful cousin, Sky, then why can't Sky do the same and have her cake and eat it too? That was one of the twist in the movie. It was beautifully portrayed and you could feel the passion with Sky and Summer G. What was funny is the sketch book found up under Sky and Chip's bed with Summer G all up in it. I was laughing my behind off because all the while he was cheating, but she was still in love with G. The wanna-be female that wanted a singing contract was trying to bust G and Sky out because she had the hots for G. I can go on and on about this movie, but it was a very sad ending, but someone had to leave. I think that this was a very nice movie and it had a nice story line with a mixture of wealth in the Hamptons to ghetto fabulous. Hey you can't go wrong if you make it right!! It is a must have because it gives a different feel for an African-American movie. It is a movie to put in your DVD collection.",1150588800,5,2405,4.03347280334728

2491573,5,B000E5KUJW,"I was really surprised at how sexy G turned out to be.  I was expecting another dumb Hip Hop movie and discovered a thought provoking, hot love triangle.  It had a great combination of laughs, hotness and scares.  Chenoa Maxwell is beautiful. And Blaire Underwood and Richard T. are such great actors.  I highly recommend.",1143331200,8,322,4.8
2491574,5,B000E5KUJW,This movie have so many messages and it is a good movie. The director Cherot has once again proven himself.  Blair Underwood is a great actor.  In this movie it shows him once again to have versatility.  He is showing his growth.  The movie shines with passion and a message of not living in the moment and letting go of the past.  The plot is shocking based on how the movie starts which when I watched it for the first time I had to watch it again due to shocks and turn of events.  I can't stop thinking about the climax and the note that set everything off.  This movie goes down on the list of another great cross over movie for all races.,1142380800,3,644,4.145161290322581

8105877,5,B000E5KUJW,"Although it doesn't specifically say it anywhere in the movie, this was inspired by The Great Gatsby. It's not a black version of a film adaptation of the book, instead, it's a modern film that has the same theme and elements of that story. The movie is VERY well written, and it has a lot of really good scenes and dialogue. I will admit though that some of the costumes were ridiculous, and a few characters were played by actors who weren't that great, but still, it was fantastic.",1510617600,,484,4.449438202247191
