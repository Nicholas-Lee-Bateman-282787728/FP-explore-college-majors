3546987,5,B001E8YGRK,"Not being a native of Richmond, VA, I remembered the show when it first aired on A&E years ago. Now that I live in Richmond, I purchased the show to mainly take a walk through the city and see if any of the areas featured are familiar to me.

With that being said, I almost prefer ""Crime 360"" over her sister shows ""The First 48"" and ""Forensic Files."" ""Crime 360"" is basically a combination of both ""The First 48"" and ""Forensic Files,"" with the investigation narrative that makes ""The First 48"" so intriguing and the look at the forensics aspect of the crimes that is the staple of ""Forensic Files.""

Graphically appealing with the 3D-images of the CSI scanners and with detectives that, although you don't get as familiar with them as you do on ""The First 48,"" are just as passionate about their jobs, ""Crime 360"" is a great show that shows the inner workings of solving crimes.",1344556800,5,879,4.522012578616352
3546988,5,B001E8YGRK,"I am just watching season one and after 5 episodes, I can garantee this is serious stuff in America. It intriges me how life can be taken away that easily in America. Besides that, this is a great show and I got hooked on it.",1306454400,,225,4.022222222222222
3546989,4,B001E8YGRK,"Crime 360 is not for everyone. It features some pretty grisly sights. But, thankfully, they are done tastefully and the bodies are usually presented in a way that will keep you from being sick.

The show takes through real murder mysteries and follows the detectives working the case. You'll see how lucky 911 calls, digging through garbage and needle-in-a-haystack-looking can pay off to big rewards when trying to find that ellusive thing called justice.

If you are at all interested in how police do their work, I'd take a look at this. You don't have to love CSI or anything to appreciate the real work done by these brave, thoughful and persistant detectives of the law.

The first two episodes feature detectives taking the lead for the first time. You'll see mistakes and blunders. And you'll also see veterans of the force doing great work to get the job done. Sometimes they catch they bad guy, sometimes the case stays open.

I enjoyed every minute of the show. It gave me a great insider's view of how a homicide investigation is done.",1300233600,4,1047,4.736263736263736
3546990,5,B001E8YGRK,"I love forenics and these guys are great the way they solve their crimes. They have the most amazing machines, and they tell you in detail how they  do everything. They set out to get their man and they don't quit. I used to watch this show on TV but I can't get it anymore so I decide I'd buy from Amazon because they have everything you could possibly want, thank goodness I want all of these dvd's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Crime-360-The-Complete-Season-One/dp/B001E8YGRK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Crime 360: The Complete Season One</a>",1298246400,2,589,5.848837209302325
3546991,5,B001E8YGRK,another fine crime show from the tv people at A&E  great for any lovers of this type of reality crime drama.,1281744000,,108,4.142857142857143
3546992,5,B001E8YGRK,"As a ex police officer I found the series one of the best. From start to finish all was explained in full account of the crime, autopsy and incararation of the criminal. I would highly recommend this series to anyone interested in true crime at it's best.",1267660800,7,255,4.446808510638298
3546993,5,B001E8YGRK,"This is by far one of the best reality crime dramas I have ever seen produced, the crime scene reenactment are amazing w/today's modern day technology.

Thanks,
Alex",1266364800,,165,4.892857142857143
3546994,5,B001E8YGRK,I really enjoyed the balanced blend of all the crime shows that are on now. Also the introduction to new forensic technology was awesome. I can hardly wait until next season's release.,1257292800,,184,4.78125
3546995,5,B001E8YGRK,"Because this programme starts with the 911 call then follows the police on their investigations, there is no need for the  ""some of the events have been reenacted"" situations, with naff actors in '80's gear running about.
 I look forward to Season 2. With the 3d graphics and high quality photography this is the Rolls-Royce of crime dvds.",1247788800,,339,4.827586206896552
3546996,5,B001E8YGRK,"This real life documentation of Homicide detective cases is a fascinating and detailed study in modern police science that will captivate any true crime buff.

It is like ""Cops"" with a microscope.

Over ten murder cases are explored in this three DVD set from the original series that appeared on A&E Television.  From the initial 911 call reports, the CSI investigations, the insider look at the Homicide bureau internal discussions, the followup forensics chemical, weapon, and cell phone usage evaluations; the coroner's report, the crime scene neighborhood canvassing, and the actual police interviews of witnesses and suspects the series is one of the best compilations of actual Homicide bureau police science we have ever seen on television.

The detectives range from rookie first-year officers to seasoned veterans that serve the Richmond, Virginia and Cleveland, Ohio Police Departments.  The production values of each show are outstanding, and utilize the latest in 3D and graphic reproductions of both the crime scene analysis, as well as the forensic lab work performed to solve these difficult cases.  The series even includes a yet unsolved random and tragic killing of a Cleveland resident by a perpetrator using an AK-47 high powered rifle......exposing the frustration of these officer's everyday experiences in their job as Homicide Investigators.

The only disappointing aspect of this show that bothered me was that ALL the case studies featured murders involving inner city minority victims and suspects.  I would have preferred seeing a wider perspective of homicide cases instead of taking the easy path of covering lower income demographic examples that sadly occur here in America today.  The impression left to the viewer is that no one in the more affluent suburbs has ever killed their spouse, their neighbor, or an innocent victim of a robbery or home invasion in an upscale community.

That aside, however, ""Crime 360"" is like a great book you just can't put down, and I defy any viewer to stop watching until they have seen all the episodes in one sitting.  I highly recommend you first watch this complete series on a rainy Saturday afternoon, and be prepared to have your dinner watching disc three at the end of your day.",1235865600,17,2256,5.170329670329671
8297136,5,B001E8YGRK,Came with three DVDs! Was very excited to see this show again! Love the way they actually show scans and put together the actual incident! Thank you!,1497830400,,149,4.555555555555555
8297137,5,B001E8YGRK,"My daughter is in this video, so of course I love it.",1486771200,,53,3.5
8297138,5,B001E8YGRK,Great series. Real. Not staged.,1468195200,,31,5.4
8297139,5,B001E8YGRK,Just like watching these great crime shows.,1455667200,,43,5.285714285714286
8297140,5,B001E8YGRK,"If you love CSI, you'll love this show!",1446508800,,39,4.0
8297141,2,B001E8YGRK,"I love true crime series, but to base one on a technology that gives you a 360 degree photographic preservation of the crime scene is a pretty bizarre premise.  You don't really get to know everything that goes into investigating the crime, or the roles played by the medical examiner (HUGE, as the detectives here like to say), the forensic teams who actually take the crime scene to the bare bones to find clues, etc...

I don't like this series because it just bored me.  As a former victim advocate, I find I would be constantly apologizing to the victims of the crime, real people, for the lack of in depth investigation.

The 2 stars are simply for the effort of the producers to show this new tool's possible breakthrough in crime scene preservation.",1413072000,,757,4.626865671641791
8297142,2,B001E8YGRK,for my skill level. Good for forensic beginners though.  Moves slow and gives very basic information. Novists only. xxxx xxx,1398297600,,124,5.2
8297143,5,B001E8YGRK,"This DVD set was produced in 2008, but the technology it introduces, 360 degree digital photography is amazing. You are invited to join real law officers on real cases. In all criminal investigations it is important that every spec of evidence be found, collected and identified. This new and growing process helps investigating officers ""look"" at the crime scene again with highly sensitive photographic equipment that rotates 360 degrees and scans the crime scene for previously unseen or hidden evidence. The cases are intriguing, the technology amazing. I purchased this DVD set for my criminal investigation class and we still use it. I know a great deal has changed since the making of this series, but the value in its elaboration on investigation techniques and the use of technical equipment is still very valuable.",1390003200,,824,5.156716417910448
8297144,5,B001E8YGRK,Just the thing I wanted. I had great customer service. Fast delivery really helped and I highly recommended them to anyone.,1386892800,,123,4.904761904761905
8297145,3,B001E8YGRK,"Maybe I'll get used to the 360 style this DVD is set in but so far its ok, haven't watched it all but will when I have time and if I like I will revise my statement on this DVD",1362355200,,176,3.425
