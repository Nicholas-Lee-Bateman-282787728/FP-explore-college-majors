7992076,3,B00009NJDE,"Despite the list of ""titles"", there are 2 sections.

First is Quito (30 minutes)which spends about 10 minutes on the artist Guayasimin (unless you like Modern Art, a waste), and wastes almost as much time going thru the art inside some of the churches.  But there are some great shots of El Trole (the trolley bus), the Old City, Zona del Sur, and even the area of the new city around Amazonas; a brief look at the Otavalo market (which is at least two hours north, even tho it is presented as being ""part of Quito""), and a good look at (and I think from ) El Virgin del Quito.

Second is Los Galapagos (20 minutes) with shots of the critters and background narration of the history - often the history has nothing to do with the video, so consdier spending separate sessions watching and listening.

Narration in Spanish; subtitles in Spanish, English, French, Italian.  On the computer, Japanese subtitles are listed, altho don't seem to work.  Good for learning Spanish.

Suggest considering the ""enhanced CD"", which is actually two separate discs - this DVD plus a reasonably good Andean music CD by Mallku de los Andes (which was also releasted separately).

Note: remember, the time it takes arriving at the airport, going thru customs, doing any monetary exchange, collecting luggage, getting a taxi and arriving at the hotel is probably about the same as the section on Quito takes.  To try to cover the Jungle, Cuenca, Guyaquil, etc, in the same DVD with Quito and the Galapagos is to have very little of anything",1135641600,2,1522,4.713207547169811
