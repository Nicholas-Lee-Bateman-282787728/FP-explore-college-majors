8760375,5,B01F71L3SO,"I returned this set of DVDs because I couldn't play it on my U.S. DVD player.  I was extremely disappointed!!!!  Eventually, I was able to purchase elsewhere Series 1 & 2 DVDs that could play on my U.S. machine; however, I'm a huge fan of the show but have not been able to find Series 3 & 4 that will play on my DVD.
Please urge whoever to sell these in a format for DVDs sold in the U.S.
I love the story and the actors.  It's so good and I'm heartbroken that I can't see Series 3 & 4 yet.
I'm sure I'm not alone.",1518652800,,515,3.839622641509434

8760381,1,B01F71L3SO,"I also had to return the DVD.  It is advertised as plays in ""all regions"" but it would not work on the new Blu-ray player.  Finally took it to Best Buy and it would not work on any blu-ray player there.  So this is either a defective DVD or advertised falsely.  And Amazon is charging me a restocking fee when this was totally out of my control.  Shouldn't have to pay restocking fee for defective merchandise.  What gives Amazon?  And I am a Prime customer as well - so much for taking care of Prime members.  Very disappointed.",1485734400,11,529,4.326530612244898
