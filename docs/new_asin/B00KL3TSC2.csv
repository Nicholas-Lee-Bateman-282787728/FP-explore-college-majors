6433279,4,B00KL3TSC2,"Just finished watching Series One, three episodes. I agree with most of the first & longest review of these shows stated in July 2014, but have a few cavils. The first is that I can do without the crime/s involving the family of the detective, yet in each episode his family was directly affected by the crime/s committed. I view it as a cheap emotional trick which is as unconvincing as it is manipulative. The second problem is that these detectives aren't very bright. You might say that, well, detectives in general aren't all that smart. Maybe, maybe not. If I wanted to know about police procedure I'd read a nonfiction book. On TV I expect something more, and this lot seem especially plodding. Having said that, overall I'd say that this is in the second tier of Nordic police dramas.",1421020800,9,792,4.624113475177305
6433280,2,B00KL3TSC2,"Usu am a big fan of nordic detectives,  but this fell short. Just not interesting, didn't care about the characters. As an aside, why do the men in nordic/irish detective show looks so scruffy, shop worn, as though they need a shave and a bath?",1418515200,,244,4.4222222222222225

6433283,4,B00KL3TSC2,"The stories were generally very good and the acting was excellent.  Subscripts seemed to be very accurately and fluidly following the dialogue, which is in  Norwegian. I think that the plot could have used a little better directing and editing.  At times I had some difficulty in determining what had happened.",1410998400,3,310,5.03921568627451

6433287,5,B00KL3TSC2,Excellent in every respect.  Consistently engrossing and thoroughly enjoyable.  Perfection of the genre.  (This applies to Set 1 and Set 2.),1406332800,14,140,5.571428571428571
6433288,5,B00KL3TSC2,"Why ""surprisingly""? Well, I've seen so many Scandanavian mystery series and though I very much enjoy the genre, the idea of a first-rate, ""battle-weary"" detective who has a dysfunctional family life seemed, at first, to be just another example of a worn-down cliche. There's also a moodiness to the Scandanavian genre that, if not handled well, can weigh down the story in brooding self-reflection. For me, that can get wearisome. Thus, I wasn't expecting too much that was fresh or exciting from this series, but I was wrong. Reidar Sorensen plays his character Cato Isaksen with a deft subtlety that makes him seem real, nuanced, and quite believable.  Cato is not a two-dimensional caricature.  Though he has left his wife and family for his mistress and their new baby, he's trying to fulfill his obligations to them all. He loves them all and he walks a very taut emotional tightrope. The ensemble cast is very good, as well, and the character development of the major players is well-done. Between the acting and the writing,  the viewer comes to accept these characters in their flawed and gifted complexity and feels for them in their individual (and conflicting) struggles. In the first episode, The Snakebearer, this is especially true. There are no absolutes -- the heroes aren't perfect and the villains, while their deeds are indeed terrible, are not entirely bad people, either.  It's all muddled.  Against the charged backdrop of Cato's personal life, and in this shaded, complicated world, the mystery takes place.  The plot lines are tightly drawn and the personal life of Cato is entwined with the disturbing and connected murder cases he's investigating.  There's a great deal of tension as the tangled threads get tighter and tighter. As I say, it's compelling drama.  Highly recommended, especially if you've enjoyed such series as Varg Veum, Maria Wern, Wallender, etc. A final point -- it is in Norwegian with subtitles. I've found the subtitles to be well done -- they do not distract from the viewing experience.",1405987200,36,2037,5.023738872403561
8659641,5,B00KL3TSC2,"The Cato Isaksen Mysteries is a superb television series from Nordisk Film, which was adapted from the detective novels of the international best-selling Norwegian crime author Unni Lindell. This series is essentially a combination of a detective procedural and a family drama, and it is presented in its original Norwegian language format, with English subtitles. The story line centers around around Cato Isaksen, who is depicted as a tired and troubled veteran Norwegian homicide detective, whose personal life is completely dysfunctional, and who seems to be suffering from elements of both severe job stress and generalized burnout. Cato Isaksen has recently separated from his wife, and he has two sons with her. He is currently living with his much younger girlfriend and their infant son, and he has a very strained relationship with his oldest son from his original marriage, who is a conflicted and rebellious teenager, who harbors unrelenting resentment toward his father, for having left him, his mother, and his younger brother. Although Cato Isaksen usually looks scruffy and disheveled, and often displays an extremely volatile demeanor, his unkempt appearance and his obvious emotional distress belie his exceptional investigative skills and acumen. When he is not distracted by his chaotic personal life, and is able to focus, Cato Isaksen is a masterful detective, who is extremely intuitive, methodical, and persistent, with an uncanny ability to solve complicated homicide cases. The Cato Isaksen Mysteries is a superb detective procedural, that is characterized by excellent writing and plot development, with murder mysteries that are intriguing, gripping, and suspenseful, replete with many interesting twists. Reidar Sorensen delivers an outstanding performance with his brilliant portrayal of Detective Cato Isaksen, and the acting performances of the supporting cast are also stellar. The Cato Isaksen Mysteries is a decidedly intelligent, engaging, and entertaining Norwegian detective series from Nordisk Film, which merits a five-star rating, along with an enthusiastic recommendation.",1507334400,,2114,5.714285714285714
