8607298,5,B00EO2YOB6,"I loved this documentary. It shows the harshness of North Korea, but at the same time points out the imperfection of the so called free world. It's amazing to me that the star actually wanted to go back to the camp. It is very cerabral, maybe we are used to the so called free world and the constant goal of power and making money. Communism, is a relief for some people. But, the world is not ready for it. Freedom is not free we have to slave for things everyday and that makes a lot of people unhappy",1512086400,,503,4.142857142857143
8607299,5,B00EO2YOB6,"I saw Camp 14:Total Control Zone on Netflix it is very depressing but that is what it is,it is about the Brutal truth of a COMMUNIST Dictatorship in North Korea. What Communism does to Families,to feelings and Morals. People tattling on their own families,not eating and in N.Korea's case no contact with the outside world. The only thing that bothered me was the coolness and utter coldness(both at the same time,not as in cool that's cool but as in saying something as if it were not a big deal)of the escapee in regards to his loved one's death and not feeling anything and one former torturer from the Concentration Camps(Why no one has ever done a Documentary on THE UMAP concentration camps in Cuba for Religious,Homosexuals and other undesirables to Castro is beyond me.)Also the ""Nostalgia"" felt for the escapee to want to go back to where he was born is utterly disgusting to me after all he went through,those are my major gripes with this film.",1450137600,2,955,4.724550898203593
