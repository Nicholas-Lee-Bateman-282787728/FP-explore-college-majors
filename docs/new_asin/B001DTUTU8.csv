3539304,3,B001DTUTU8,I. like every other kid growing up loved Dr. Seuss.  As an adult I look back with great memories of reading his books.  But the movies that they have done don't work.  Horton Hears A Who is the kind of movie that I have to be in the right kind of mood for to sit down and watch.  It's a good story with good morals.  But the movie slow and seems like about half way through I'm ready for it to be over.,1494720000,,402,3.7951807228915664

3539364,5,B001DTUTU8,"Dr. Seusss stories are simple, and their length is not long. His stories are short, yet their message is strong. Theyre also spectacularly unsuited for any Hollywood adaptation, as unsuited as I am for Dr. Seuss rhyming and alliteration. Theyve tried it before with live action, and with Horton at least theyve finally learned that lesson and left the prosthetics abandoned. To make a Seuss story work as a film youve got to stuff it with filler, and theres plenty of that to be found in this new animated attempt at filming his masterful work. Its a success as a movie, but it still isn't quite perfect as a Seuss adaptation.

The fact that the movie is freed from the bounds of human actors and props helps though, and Horton Hears a Who! is nearly as visually creative and fun as the Seuss drawings its based on. Its the story that occasionally misses, since they're building a 90 minute film out of a book thats really only a few pages. The core of Seusss world is there though. This is still the story of an elephant named Horton who discovers a spec. On the spec is a town called Whoville, and its mayor can hear Horton when he talks. Horton vows to protect the tiny spec and its inhabitants, and finds himself harangued and ostracized by the other animals of his jungle who cant hear the Whos voices and so insist hes a dangerous kook.

Jim Carrey, who achieved dubious success doing a live action version of The Grinch a few years ago, voices Horton. Its a strange choice really, I thought the reason we liked Jim was for his facial contortions, not his vocal veracity. But hes capable as Horton, sort of sappy and silly, which plays into the films mostly cartoony vibe. Funny is the name of the game here, and Horton Hears a Who! sometimes pushes the moral center of Seusss story to the background in favor of being wacky. At least though, it really is funny. The visual gags are entertaining and Steve Carell, as the voice of The Mayor of Whoville is both touching and hilarious. That balances out a lot of the unnecessary pop culture references, MySpace jokes, and Jim Carrey riffing which in a lesser film, might have sent the whole thing straight to the bottom.

In the end, they hang on to enough of Seusss smart, sweet message about the importance of life, tolerance, and standing up for what you believe in to leave the movie something substantive to wrap all that silliness around. Horton Hears a Who is fun and enthusiastic, but also sweet and affecting in all the right moments. If you can forgive it for a momentary lapse in the last thirty seconds which turns the whole thing into a bizarre, rock opera musical number, youll find a lot to like in Horton Hears a Who!. Dr. Seuss will always be better in book form, but Hollywood has found a way to turn his work into a movie without falling flat.",1466035200,,2816,4.49609375

3539454,5,B001DTUTU8,"For movies that have a dual meaning, you usually see quite a few efforts to have double entendres as jokes for the adults in the middle of something for kids.  Horton Hears a Who goes in a different direction with this by addressing some pretty big questions:

* If you can't see, hear, or see something, how do you know it exists?
* How do we react to authority when it contradicts our own sense of right and wrong?
* What do you do if everyone around you thinks your behavior is anti-social?

It's not all right or left concepts here.  There's some ideas around faith, morality, environmentalism, and government.  All this heavy stuff cleverly stashed inside a movie with lots of sight gags, cute characters, and great voice acting.  Win.",1443225600,,740,4.6106870229007635

I bought this Blueray looking to save a few bucks on a digital copy for my kid.  This is the worst digital copy I've ever seen.  It is a DRM wmv file on a 2nd dvd-rom.  It is impossible to view or get the file off the disk.  I'm not positive because I don't have the latest Windows Media player with DRM.  I upgraded my media player only to find out the provided ""serial number"" doesn't work and won't unlock the movie.  Waste of time and money.

3539630,5,B001DTUTU8,"Horton Hears a Who

 Millions of us have either read Dr. Seuss to our children or had Dr. Seuss stories read to us as children.  Either way, Horton the Elephant is a familiar and beloved character.  This animated homage to Horton does justice to the original.  The stylized drawings are as warm and familiar as hot coca.
 Funny men Jim Carrey (Horton) and Steve Carell (the Mayor) provide the male voice talent.  Carrey particularly gives life to Horton in an uncharacteristic, low key almost anonymous portrayal.  I had to really pay attention to the voice to get any hint of Jim Carreys well known modulations.  We get to watch Horton on the screen, not Carrey playing Horton.  Bravo Mr. Carrey.  It must have been a temptation for him to give one of his patented over the top performances.
 Carol Burnett was similarly anonymous as the villain, the snooty and overbearing Kangaroo.
The story involves the eternal question, What if we are just atoms in the fingernail of a giant? beloved of philosophers and pot smokers through out the ages.  In Hortons case, he can actually hear a voice from another world, the teeny tiny town of Whoville.  He is naturally enough thought to be out of his mind by the other animals in the forest.
In a parallel story, the Mayor of Whoville can hear Horton.  The good people of Whoville similarly doubt the sanity of the Mayor.
In good Dr. Seuss fashion, all comes right in the end.  The inspiring message for the tiny ones is put in the mouth of Horton.  A person is a person, no matter how small.  This slogan for acceptance and tolerance is supplemented by An elephant is faithful one hundred per cent.  This gives us the children the idea of perseverance in the right even in the face of opposition.  Good messages both.
This is not quite the classic animated film that I had hoped for, but it is quite good.  I give it three and a half saw blades.  It is G rated for the family trade.  It runs one hour and 28 minutes.  This movie will be a huge success, granting the Midas blessing to all involved.  It took in $45 million in the first three days.  This movie is well worth seeing.  If you don't have a kid, borrow one from the neighbor and go anyway.",1414972800,,2193,4.472222222222222

3539697,5,B001DTUTU8,I've tried the newer version but guess I'm too old so I much prefer this version. I also prefer the older version of How The Grinch Stole Christmas. The newer versions just don't do it for me.,1404000000,,192,4.216216216216216

3539699,3,B001DTUTU8,"The computer-based effects, side comments and updating made this a bore to me, but my kids watch it over and over. Jim Carrey is undoubtedly a great actor but the same goofiness that may have brought him fame is, in my opinion, getting overworked. Nice job, in general, but as for myself, I miss Edward Everett Horton's narration.  (OK - I'm a dinosaur!)

As for kids, FIVE stars.  As for me, THREE.",1402790400,,399,4.513888888888889

We read the book first and then watched the movie.  There are differences and more details in movie than the book, as you would expect.  It stays pretty true to the original story.",1399334400,,426,4.410256410256411
3539709,2,B001DTUTU8,"We love Dr. Seuss books and I was impressed by some of the reviews and ratings of this movie.  I should have read more of the reviews!  I'm disappointed in some of the words used (many are repeated); ""idiots"", ""boob"", and ""shut up"", among others.  I can't shield my child from things forever but I'd like to as long as possible and at only three, I'm not comfortable with her repeating those.

3539713,3,B001DTUTU8,"The movie uses the term ""idiot"" a lot and has a few instances of rude humor.  At one point, they also yell ""Shut up!""  I wouldn't classify it as ""G"", but that's me.  It's got some cute parts.",1397088000,,191,3.973684210526316

The idea that there are universes within universes is an absorbing notion and standing up for what you believe even if you're a whimsical elephant carrying a weed . . . not a bad moral lesson.  Even a ""goth"" son has a place in this battle against petty-minded convention.  Who knows if later your child may recognize a bit of the Galileo story from this animation?  Dr. Seuss is sly.",1361664000,,514,4.4361702127659575

3540033,3,B001DTUTU8,"In the 1970 TV adaptation of Dr. Seuss' Horton Hears a Who, the Wickersham Brothers sang, ""Rot! Rot! Rot! Rot! It's a plot! Plot! Plot! Plot!"" A plot indeed. The directors of the 2008 ""re-do"" (not ""re-make""; but I'll get to that in a minute) decided to remove most of the TV series' original music (and accompanying political undertones). Those dastardly, ghastardly, schnastardly schnooks!

I mean, some of the most impressionable moments from the TV series were created by or during the music. But alas, freshmen Directors Steve Martino and Jimmy Hayward went with a more...what would one call it?...""a safe""...version of the 2008 re-do.

The main story from the book (and TV series) is still fully intact in the 2008 movie. The story that has Horton the Elephant hearing voices from a dust-speck. Horton's point of view is that ""a person's a person...no matter how small"". But nay-sayers won't have their beliefs poisoned by the notion that there could be another society other than their own. So Horton finds himself an outcast.

The new film seems to completely avoid the original book's 1954 political message, which was a mockery of McCarthyism and communist witch hunts of the time period. But in doing so, some of the enchantment of the TV movie was lost. Not enough so that viewers unfamiliar with the TV show--especially kids--won't enjoy the 2008 movie, but enough so that the 2008 re-do was pointless because it added nothing new to what was already solidly in place.

Yes...I said ""re-do"" as opposed to ""re-make"". A re-make is when a director takes an old film, sometimes even a classic, and makes it *better*. A re-do is when a director takes a film and adds nothing to the original. The 2008 version of Horton is a re-do. Look, I'm not a big preservationist that thinks remaking good original movies should be taboo. I just think that a re-make should indeed be that...a re-make...not a re-do.

People will remember the 2008 version of Horton for its rendition of REO Speedwagon's Can't Fight This Feeling. The essence of the movie was better surmised in 1970 when Thurl Ravenscroft sang ""The Wickersham Brothers Song"" (you might know Ravenscroft's voice better as the one that sang ""You're A Mean One, Mr. Grinch"" in 1966's How The Grinch Stole Christmas).

So clearly, my recommendation is to stick with the original TV Horton. In fact, Amazon has a DVD package that not only gives you the original Horton, but also How The Grinch Stole Christmas (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/How-the-Grinch-Stole-Christmas-Horton-Hears-a-Who/dp/B00004VVP9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">How the Grinch Stole Christmas!/Horton Hears a Who</a>).

3540036,4,B001DTUTU8,"I love Dr. Seuss, and always will. But not having any children, I don't always come into contact with his stories until well after everyone knows everything about them. I remember Horton from when he hatched an egg, but this is the first I've gone to Whoville. (Or is it? Wasn't that also the name of the people from whom the Grinch stole Christmas?)

Jim Carrey does a great job as the voice of Horton, but the real personality is more in the animation than the voice. He's absolutely lovable! He's funny and just a little crazy, but not nearly as crazy as the know-it-all kangaroo who is convinced he is crazy. She believes Horton is a bad influence on the children of the jungle because he's encouraging them to use their imagination. That's why she's pouch-schooling her son.

Whoville is on a tiny speck on a clover and nobody but Horton can hear the Whos. So there's some obvious back and forth about is Horton crazy for believing in the Whos, or is the Mayor of Whoville crazy for believing in Horton? Some funny digs get in there about religion, philosophy, maybe even molecular physics. Also about politics (the way Whoville runs, and also the way the jungle community runs), and all sorts of things. Some are no doubt part of Dr. Seuss' book, but I'm betting that a good bit of it comes from the animators. Especially the brilliant physical jokes. Never simply slapstick, they are nonetheless the sort that would hurt plenty if you weren't a cartoon.

If you have kids, you probably already know the book. Maybe you already know and love this movie. If not, take your earliest opportunity to see it, but be prepared to laugh until you get hiccups.",1336867200,,1657,4.591216216216216

Heh.

I don't know if the filmmakers intended it, but this movie has a strong pro-life message, albeit somewhat hidden: Just because you can't see him or her yet, it doesn't mean the fetus is not a person.

Otherwise we eventually arrive at the position that some ""experts"" have: ""Parents should be allowed to have their newborn babies killed because they are ""morally irrelevant"" and ending their lives is no different to abortion, a group of medical ethicists linked to Oxford University has argued."" And they're right - if abortion is OK, then killing newborns is also OK. There's no rational stopping point, as they argue.

""The authors therefore concluded that ""what we call `after-birth abortion' (killing a newborn) should be permissible in all the cases where abortion is, including cases where the newborn is not disabled""."" Some ""bioethicists"" like Peter Singer think we should be able to kill a child up to two years old.

This movie's subliminal message - he who has ears, let him hear - is that this view is hideously wrong.

The plot has been nicely updated, with great animation and humor, all in Seuss's well-known style. And understanding the central message only serves to increase your enjoyment of this movie.",1330646400,,1274,4.929906542056075
3540044,4,B001DTUTU8,"Let's start with the easy part. Whoville is as Seussian as one could hope, right down to the last leggy contraption and skewed piece of architecture. The Jungle of Nool comes across just as well - you can't tell the plants from the animals until one smiles at you, and maybe not then. The animators had the good sense to leave most of their fancier effects at home, and use those other few with generally good taste. The animators' restraint let the good doctor's story come through about as well as one could hope. Unlike other recent movies, this at least lets me enjoy my childhood memories of the original.

It's not the original, though, not by any means. That was short enough to read end to end when putting a kid to bed, without tiring your vocal cords. An awful lot happened on the way to making it a feature-length movie. The good news is that most of that lot wasn't too awful. Oh, the pasted-on bad guy, that was very un-Seussily done, but most of the rest fit the spirit well enough. At least, it seemed to. Now I have to go back and check again, but that's not such a bad thing either.

It's a good kids' movie. It's pretty much just a kids' movie, though. The best kids' movies have plenty to keep the ticket-buying grownups entertained, too, and I'm afraid this doesn't rise to their needs. But it keeps the kids happy, judging by the little voices I heard laughing throughout - when I could hear them over my own laughter.

3540063,3,B001DTUTU8,"I've always enjoyed the older animated version, and so I was rather interested to see this CGI effort when it eventually came out on home video.  The voice cast is excellent and the animation is serviceably good as with most animated movies these days.  Most of the jokes produced smiles if not fully audible laughter (although there were a few hilarious moments).  So, basically, it's yet another good CGI movie for the family but with one major exception:

The message that the movie conveys is very troubling to me, although I'm sure most people wouldn't consider it offensive.  Through the antagonist of the movie, the archly controlling kangaroo mother, the movie suggests that people who require firm evidence for their beliefs are belligerent and intolerant.  The more Horton declares his belief in the seemingly invisible and silent people living on the dust speck, the more hostile the kangaroo mother becomes until she resorts to hiring an assassin vulture to get rid of the object of Horton's faith.  The kangaroo mother clearly represents an exaggerated form of an atheist or an agnostic person.  While most families--especially in the Bible belt--won't find the message agitating, as an atheist I felt a bit alienated by that aspect of the movie.  Such a polarizing moral in a mainstream family movie is surprising to me, when it seems like most of the time these movies go out of their way not to ideologically step on anyone's toes.  They usually stick to universal themes, not anything overtly religious, which is what I find this version of Horton Hears a Who to be.

In closing, the movie is very fun and humorous but seems largely aimed at religious families.",1294963200,,1678,4.914893617021277
3540064,5,B001DTUTU8,"Dr. Seuss is like a childhood staple, and it is so wonderful to see the everlasting presence he has on literature, even today.  With my unending love for the writer, I'm actually shocked it took me this long to actually see `Horton Hears a Who' but I finally did and I must say that I absolutely loved it.

The film follows the tale of an Elephant named Horton who is a beloved teacher in his jungle town.  When he hears a high pitched cry for help on a tiny speck floating in mid-air, he risks his life and reputation to save it.  His former friends and neighbors, spurred on by Kangaroo, turn on him and label him a risk to the values of their community.  If you can't see it or hear it then it must not be real.  Alas, Horton is an elephant, and elephants are faithful 100%, so he presses on in his determination to find that speck a safe home.  It's a good thing too, since on that tiny little speck there is an entire world of Who's, tiny people living in a world where nothing bad ever happens.  The Mayor of Whoville joins forces with Horton to save his people from destruction at the hands of the mean spirited Kangaroo.

Speaking volumes about acceptance, perseverance and the power of kindness, this wonderful film captures the heart and soul of Seuss and makes it perfectly accessible to your little ones.  The films themes can be taken a few different ways (depending on your personal stance), which is quite possibly the point, but the obvious moral here is one that is universally understood.

I loved the animation choices; with rich, lush backdrops elaborating the worlds created here, and I really loved the inserts of Anime inspired segments and even classic Disney'ish moments that add splashes of color and excitement.

The narration is also splendid and adds a poetic essence to the film.

I really commend this film for `going there' without forgetting their key audience.  This is an animated film FOR CHILDREN and it remembers that while crafting the sequences of peril.  While there are moments of tension, nothing is so extreme that children will lose themselves in fear.  As much as I love and adore `Toy Story 3' and many other animated films as of late, it seems all too common to forget that young kids are easily shaken.  `Horton Hears a Who' understands the importance of maintaining a certain level of innocence; so when Kangaroo bows her head in shame and then, when prompted, returns a kind deed with another, you can sit back and feel content that this film not only entertained your kids, but it taught them a valuable lesson as well (without giving them nightmares).",1293408000,,2604,4.6017316017316015

I was just a tot. So,
I decided to see the movie -
And I liked it quite a lot!

I'll try to keep this short,
but I can't make promises here.
The movie is too great,
your children should not fear.

I know this book;
I can tell you the tale,
and here is that story,
in some minor detail:

The mayor gathers everyone
in town square
But Horton can't tell them -
he's really there.
All of the Who's and Who-ville
are unlike you and me,
They are people whom
we cannot see.

Of course, no one believes Horton,
which is sad -
the Kangaroo is making sure
that it will all go bad,
the animals rally around the kangaroo,
and they would say,
""We don't want Horton in the forest,
at all, to stay.""

Horton's an elephant,
living in what we call ""our world"".
In the jungle of Nool there are animals,
young and old.
Who-Ville is on a flower,
and in it are all the Who.
No one can hear them but Horton,
but still, could you?

A great story, of course,
and as bad it is to say,
such examples of Kangaroos
can be found today.

I love this quote,
when Horton is about to fall,
He shouts, ""A person's a person,
no matter how small!"".

You should go see this movie,
I'm not afraid to tell,
the acting is great, the animation
is flawless, as well.
I won't ruin the movie,
but let me quote you this now,
although it's not in the book,
it sums up my review; how?

""I meant what I said,
and I said what I meant.
An elephant's faithful,
one hundred percent!""

Update 9/11/2012: I wrote this back in high school after we were required to imagine a Dr. Seuss book as a movie and write a review on it. The quote ""I meant what I said and I said what I meant,"" is actually from the book ""Horton Hatches an Egg"" by Dr. Seuss.  I wrote this.  Sorry it doesn't rhyme sometimes!

3540076,3,B001DTUTU8,"In Horton Hears a Who, the designy world of Dr. Seuss is translated brilliantly into a 3D animated movie. Whoville is abundantly filled with delightful sight gags and a rich color palette. There's quite a lot of amazing stuff in here. The ""backgrounds"" and environments are exceptionally rich in detail.

The biggest flaw in this film is it's a mistake to voice-cast a skinny, hyperactive guy like Jim Carrey as a fat, lumbering elephant. The conception of Horton in the original Seuss book is a deep-voiced, slightly dumb and dorky animal with a very big heart, who succeeds in spite of himself. Jim Carrey inevitably turns any character he plays into a smart aleck. Consequently, Horton as depicted here possesses both massive, jungle-rumbling size and apparently, lighting speed and hyperactive reflexes too. Every character in this movie either has ADD or is on speed.

I'm not too thrilled with the casting of Charles Osgood as the voice of the narrator, either, as I half expect to a see a CBS reporter show up in Who-ville at any moment. Still, his voice is inevitably reassuring. But again, Osgood is not a very imaginative casting choice. I'm sure there are any number of unknown voice artists who could have put some fresh wrinkles into this part.

I take this as proof that the ""star system"" is a time-honored practice designed to pander to the audience. This system really gets in the way of new talent rising to prominence.

Still, this is a delightful movie that takes every opportunity to thrill us with the endless variety of camera moves and perspectives possible in 3D animation. It's middle-of-the-road commercial entertainment designed to attract a mass audience. The art direction and design work make this a movie well worth seeing, especially in Blu-Ray.",1263686400,,1777,4.953020134228188

Well of course she talks along with the movie a little, but no crying from her whatsoever. She is less thrilled with other children's movies and even other Dr. Seuss movies.

3540088,5,B001DTUTU8,"Pretty much every knows the story of Horton's Hears a Who.  The friendly elephant who hears the little creatures that live in their own little world and befriends them. This movie was alot more enjoyable to me than the Grinch in terms of drawing you into the world of Horton, and hopefully any other adaptations for film of his other works follow the lead.  Wonderful movie that is visually great, and the all star cast are also steller in their voice overs.

Bit of Spoiler/More Caution:  Just one bit of caution for young ones who may be sensitive, with a bit of spolier for a scene, there was one scene in particular where there was a threat to the Whos (boiling oil), which my younger nephew found a bit upsetting, though he always loved the books.  So you may want to take a quick glance through and see if is something to skip.  It is probably not a huge problem, but though I should point it out.",1246406400,,903,4.377245508982036
3540089,5,B001DTUTU8,"Well, I for one LOVED this movie.  While it starts out quite unusual and quite difficult to grasp what's going on, give the story a few more minutes to develop and you'll begin to see what it's about.  It's an animated film about an elephant who discovers an extremely tiny world inside a flower (you'll understand when you watch it).

The people living inside the tiny world (inside the flower) are very happy and honest folks that don't have a problem with each other in the slightest.  In fact, it's amazing how cheerful and upbeat they are!

Anyway, the point of the story is actually more about the elephant who discovers the world- all his animal friends think he's crazy when he tries telling them what he discovered, and the storyline for most of the film is about the elephant running away from his animal friends so they don't hurt the tiny world the elephant discovered.  Make sense?  No?  You're all set then!

But the story is honestly REALLY good.  The writers that focused on the story did an extremely good job and I couldn't believe that I, an adult, was watching the movie with the same kind of excitement that a child would.  The storytelling was just amazingly creative and the animations from the elephant and his friends was quite funny as well.  Good stuff.",1246060800,,1280,4.615044247787611
3540090,4,B001DTUTU8,"I have put off watching this film for many months because I didn't know if it's story could sustain a full length film. It turned out to be an amazing looking film with a lot of heart! The animation is stunning and the characters are funny with great voice work by the cast. I would love to see 'How The Grinch Stole Christmas' done with CGI animation.

I have to deduct one star for the DVD as the two disc special edition is really a one disc edition with a digital copy being the only feature on the second disc. For the purchase price, this is ridiulous! I had problems with the movie disc playing in my DVD player, I had the same problem with the WALL E three disc edition and had to buy three copies before finding one that would work properly.",1245024000,,750,4.208333333333333
3540091,5,B001DTUTU8,"This is by far one of the best animations ever made. The colors vibrantly ""jump out at you"" and the cartoon is very entertaining. Horton the playful good-natured elephant protects the microsopic city of Who-ville in the jungle with amusing results. It teaches you that ""a person is a person no matter how small.""

3540093,5,B001DTUTU8,"What can I say except this is thoroughly enjoyable.  One of the best animated movies I've seen.  First, Dr. Seuss is always entertaining anyway with his weird humor and creations and this is one of his best.  Second, you get some of his best work at teaching truths and virtues with the two most noted:  Just because you don't see something or you perceive it in a certain way does not take away what the truth could be (misperception, misjudgement) and prejudice (crazy elephants, small people).  Third, you have a collection of comedy's finest talents (Jim Carrey, Steve Carell and Carol Burnett among others) doing their thing.  This is more than just a kids movie.  This is a classic.  I thought the original was decent but this version had me laughing so hard I missed parts so I'll be watching this many times before I get tired of it if I even get tired of it.  I don't think I will.  An elephant may never forget but I do so let's watch it again.",1241913600,,954,4.431034482758621

When are they going to learn that good stories can be serious, or at least have a serious scene or two without the one-liners cluttering the writing. Children can be drawn in for other reasons. One of my favorite films as a kid was Alice in Wonderland. You'd have to stretch to find a one-liner anywhere in that film, yet kids even today still love it. Life isn't always about a laugh. I'm getting sick of the recycled fart type jokes cluttering kids movies these days. With all of that said, this Movie was better than I expected (it did retain a lot of the magic from the book and the cartoon while only bringing in bad humor once and awhile), but much worse than it could have been.",1239753600,,792,4.394557823129252

I just couldn't keep my eyes open -- the first time the kiddies watched it, they lost interest a third of the way through and made my little nap break a nightmare -- but ya know, we stuck with Horton and the Whos'-- and I have to say this movie has grown on all of us and I rather like it... Now, the babies are glued to the TV and on every viewing I like this movie more and more ... my favorite part being when Vlad(not the bunny, with the cookies:) takes the clover and we see Horton in an old spaghetti western influenced type scene... wow, that's great stuff, with the screaming trumpet and stuff!  As well as... the end, when the Who's work together to save their world.

This one definitely ranks high on my list... great for kids and adults... there isn't much if any of that adult humor crud(i.e. Madagascar), which I mostly find inappropriate for young audiences even if they don't 'get it' yet... and though it isn't to the level of Pixar, I think they did a great job with this one...",1238889600,,1170,4.149779735682819

3540112,2,B001DTUTU8,"I am not a big fan of Jim Carrey, but I read the positive reviews and purchased this movie. What a waste of money. While the animation is very good and the Seuss atmosphere, when present, comes through nicely, most of the story and dialogue isn't anything that I want my kids watching. The story rambles on like a bad SNL skit and the name calling and ""crotch"" humor don't have a place in our house. There are some nice scenes that stick to the original story and Jim Carrey does a good job as Horton, but much of the show is filled with inappropriate humor and gratuitous pop culture references. And, the other reviewer is right, the shot at homeschoolers is unnecessary as well.

My wife grew up on Seuss books and she was ready to shut the movie off early in the show. She soldiered on and watched it with me almost to the bitter end. We finally shut it off when the story degraded into an REO Speedwagon song.

If they would have stuck with their core Horton story and the excellent narration of Charles Osgood, then the movie would have been much better and about half as long. As it is, I don't think this movie is appropriate for younger viewers as it will demonstrate language and behaviors you probably don't want in your house. We'll stick with the original 1970 adaptation.",1235606400,,1284,4.436440677966102

A good movie to have on hand for a bit of light-hearted entertainment.

The story moved briskly, the dialogue was great, the animation was flawless, and every scene was full of eye candy.  The soundtrack was upbeat orchestral music, and mirrored the mood of each scene.  Probably the best was the comedy; neither ridiculous nor slapstick, it is original, zany and unforced.  This is Jim Carrey's 2nd adaptation of a Dr. Seuss movie, and I can't say which is better.  This movie is also another outing of Carrey and Steve Carrell together, and either could have carried the movie.

As an educator and parent, I am always concerned with the messages movies convey to children. Among the many messages in this movie: the evil kangaroo woman (a character who wants to save the jungle community from Horton's 'wierd ways') 'Pouch Schools' her little one.  This comes across as a cruel shot at homeschooling. Even global weather change messages are added to this story of a generation ago.  Nevertheless, the time honored original moral comes through: a person's a person no matter how small. Perhaps this salient line could be used as a pro-life slogan!

We endured nearly the entire movie - fast forwarding through the song at the end, etc.. While we loved some of the WhoVille scenes, it is not worth the money in our opinion.

3540139,5,B001DTUTU8,"This is a fun movie. Just every element of it ( Except one) is so very Seuss-ian, that it recalls memories of all those years ago for me, and yet the way the film has been done, it brings it right into the current period. Whilst the Adults may Love the Commentary, and some of the extras that explain the attention to detail, the kids may just get into the total fun of the Whimsy and awesome fun that is Dr. Seuss, and dare I say it, the time-less fun that is the tales of Dr. Seuss. And the look of the two worlds is totally appropriate, even the music is elemental, and very
much within the tone of the story.
My Big Gripe in the main film is the ""anime"" sequence, but since they kept that in because in test runs they had kids spurt soda out their nose, I guess that seems a suitably whimsical reason to keep it in, if somewhat anachronistic.

The Audio Stories ( In the Gift set only, although you can buy the longer set of these stories elsewhere) is excellent, as an adult who bought the items for myself, I still love them. And Horton as a Plush Toy is superb. The Packaging is just brilliant as well.

The DVD has been done well( the Double DVD), and the commentary is excellent and does not make you feel like you are in film school. The extras are pretty much mostly good, except for some of the preachy stuff, but I guess if the film has a point then the preachy extras have a point too, so thats the reason for them being there.",1232236800,,1441,4.142857142857143

I watched in on computer screen and the picture was extremely clear.  Animation has come a long way through the years and this is just about as good as it gets.  The soundtrack is nice, the choice of voices is excellent.  I got a real hoot out of Carol Burnett as the voice of the cranky kangaroo.  Of course it helps if you know her work. Jim Carey was outstanding as the voice of Horton.  Not a boring moment in the movie and something that an entire family can enjoy. Even the teens will probably like this one.

3540168,4,B001DTUTU8,"There is a stunning difference in watching this animated feature on regular DVD and viewing it on Blu-Ray.  The latter dramatically elevates my rating of this movie, because the story is just so-so.  It's a nice story, but nothing that will leave you laughing like in ""Cars,"" or ""Madagascar"" or a bunch of other recently-made animated features.  However, on Blu-Ray, this is so flat-out awesome to look at, that's is well worth seeing and adding to your movie collection. The brilliant colors and razor-sharp images are just amazing and totally stunning!

Jim Carrey does a nice job as ""Horton."" You might not even recognize his voice.  He plays a character who hears a voice nobody else hears; the voice of a little person on top of town which is on top of a little flower.  Hey, ""size matters,"" but far more important is the value of living beings regardless of their size.

The story is the typical frustrating one in which nobody believes the one who is telling the truth, until near the end, and then all of them do the right thing.  It's a good message, presented in a so-so story but a gorgeous one to watch on Blu-Ray.",1231459200,,1126,4.595

I don't dislike Suess, in fact I quite enjoy the books, however, I do not race to see or automatically purchase any and all Suess movies, etc.  Such was the case with this.  We just saw it this week as it was a Christmas gift for one of the kids.  Well, I wish I had raced to see it in the theater.  I thought it was so perfect!  What a great job was done combining obnoxious Suess rhyming and Jim Carrey with beautiful soft execution and amazing graphics!  Nothing was overwhelming in a typical Jim Carrey way, just enough of him was present to lend a little edginess.  The movie is beautiful!  I thought that it was a nice lenght of film, long enough to add some value and so you don't feel like you purcahsed a TV episode at a DVD price.  Although I can see very young kids getting tired out, as it is not so face paced an hectic like most movies for kids these days, but that is a pleasant change.  We just watched it in the evening before bedtime when our 3 year old was calm and I suggest perhaps watching it in 2 halves for younger or more active children.  This is one of those movies that you rent and then wished you had saved your money and just bought.  If you appreciate softer children's movies and are not a typical Suess fan, then this is for you.  Although I suspect that more traditional Suess fans will be pleased too!  What a cute lesson and the characters are wonderful.

However, the one thing I wish I'd known before receiving this is that the Single-Disc Edition is also a double-sided disc.  I'm not sure why it had to be a double-sided disc, since the movie's not that long.

3540184,5,B001DTUTU8,"As much as I enjoyed The Grinch live-action film, I have to say I am even more impressed with Horton Hears a Who.  This film really captures the look and feel of Dr. Seuss' charming children's books.  ""Horton Hears a Who"" is about an elephant named Horton who, one day, happens to hear a tiny voice on a tiny speck.  Within a short amount of time, he realizes that that tiny speck contains an entire world of the people called ""Whos"", who happen to be in dire need of protection.  Unfortunately, not everyone has the ears to hear a Who, and soon the least kind among them (an authoritative kangaroo voiced by Carol Burnett) stirs up the rabble and everyone turns against him.
Colorful and crazy, this animation brings Seuss' drawings to life.  Jim Carrey does a wonderful job of making Horton both silly and sincere, playful and touching as he goes against the grain of belief to hold onto a truth that only he knows.
Sounds pretty deep for a family film--in fact sometimes the friction provided by Carol Burnett's character can get rather heavy-handed.  But it all works out in the end, and it is Horton's compassion towards those who would harm him that brings the message home.  Simultaneously fighting this same battle is Steve Carell's character, the Mayor of Who-ville and the only one who knows about Horton.  The chemistry between these two comedic talents brings their shared situation into an enjoyable, wacky ride to the finish.
The two-disc edition of this DVD (this product) contains a disc of the movie, with many bonus features:  deleted scenes are organized into three categories of completion, and show you everything from rough storyboards to semi-finished products.  There is also a goofy short film set in the Ice Age world, with Sid the Sloth and Scrat the Squirrel.  Plus many behind-the-scenes extras about Horton Hears a Who:  an interview with Jim Carrey, shorts on how the film was made, and bits and pieces of Seussian background.
The second disc contains a digital copy of the film, which means a file that you can copy and unlock on a computer or any portable device that can play the movie back (provided the device can play Windows Media Player or iTunes files).
For anyone with children, this movie will appeal on all levels.  It does a nice job of avoiding crude humor and it portrays wacky, silly slapstick in a delightful way.  Very small children might be distressed near the end, but ultimately it all ends sweetly, and I suspect they'll be asking you, ""Can we watch it again?""",1230854400,,2514,4.723112128146453
3540185,5,B001DTUTU8,"HORTON HEARS A WHO! is a charming, fun-filled animated feature, adapted from the story by Dr. Seuss.

Horton is a playful elephant who becomes a reluctant hero when he discovers that Who-ville, a microscopic city, exists on a floating speck of dust.  Despite the efforts of the other animals in the mythical jungle to stop him, Horton undertakes a perilous and hilarious journey in order to bring that speck of dust and all its inhabitants to safety.

Jim Carrey is a delight as the voice of care-free Horton, as is Steve Carell, who supplies the voice of the mayor of Who-ville, considered to be a bumbling boob by the city council and the town's citizens.  In a ""Making of"" featurette on the 2-disc ""Special Edition"" DVD from 20th Century-Fox Home Entertainment, we see how the ad-libs from these two funnymen often caused the producers to adjust their story.

Carol Burnett voices an ultra-conservative kangaroo, who leads the other jungle creatures in an effort to stop Horton from saving Who-ville, and Will Arnett is her nefarious ""hitman,"" a vulture.  Amy Poehler, Seth Rogen and Isla Fisher voice other characters.

The animation in this feature, directed by Jimmy Hayward and Steve Martino, is marvelous.  They supply audio commentary, and the package also has a new animated  ICE AGE short, deleted footage, many ""Behind the Scenes"" featurettes and a digital copy.

The rest of this review is for the clueless producers of this Blu-ray disk. Obviously they have learned nothing from the costly lost sales of the war with HD-DVD. People like me are not going to buy an expensive new Receiver just to play a particular movie on Blu-ray. Especially with six audio formats to cover and perhaps more to come!

What a nice surprise.  My family of two young boys stayed away from the film in the theaters as most remakes of Dr. Suess' classic have been very disappointing.  When my son started asking for it and amazon had such a great price, I picked it up.  It's now in constant rotation and I must say, it's very good.

The Horton story is not very long and the filler used to stretch the film out works well.  The additional characters that were ""beefed up"" to add to the story are great.  The voice actors are some of our favorite (Seth Rogen)and Jim Carrey in no way takes away from Horton with his usual ""Carrey-ness"".

As a Home Theater show off Blu-ray disc, without spoiling any of the story, there is a scene with many pink flowers blowing in the wind.  It's pure 1080p eye candy!!!

This is not at the level of PIXAR, but right up there with the Dreamworks films (Kung Fu Panda, Madagascar) and worth a viewing.",1229904000,,1084,5.073446327683616

3540196,5,B001DTUTU8,"Last weekend we had family movie night featuring the new DVD Horton Hears a Who. My skeptical husband (who is not necessarily a fan of ""family movie night"") said, ""How can they make a 90 minute movie out of a 30 page book?""

The kids and I saw this movie in the theater, and I remembered thinking what a great job they did adapting Dr. Seuss' picture book to a feature-length film, so I quickly replied, ""Quite well, actually.""

Jim Carrey (Horton) and Steve Carell (the mayor of Whoville) keep parents and children laughing. Seriously, the kids were guffawing, and one time Amanda (age 10) looked over at my husband and said, ""Look -- Daddy's smiling. He likes it too!""

This movie adaptation perfectly captures the whimsical Seussian world without it seeming too grim, as it sometimes does. The colors are bright and the people are delightful. The story is told with narration straight from the book (and additional narration that sounds as if it's straight from the book), interspersed seamlessly with scenes of dialogue and action.

The kids laughed (and yes, we laughed too), but the bigger themes really come through loud and clear, without being at all preachy: responsibility, the value of each person -- and as a parent -- letting your kids be who they are, not who we want them to be.

And of course there's Horton, the responsible elephant, reminding us often, ""I meant what I said, and I said what I meant: an elephant's faithful 100%."" Oh, how can you not just love Horton?

Utterly delightful, charming and hilarious adaptation of Dr. Seuss's beloved novel! this animated comedy is one of the best non-pixar CGI animated movies in recent memory. The animation from Blue Sky is absolutely superb and there's plenty of good in-jokes and laughs for adults and teens as well as kids, Jim Carrey perfected the title hero quite well. The film co-stars Amy Poehler, Will Arnett, Jesse McCarthy, Jonah Hill and Dan Fogler also do some wonderful vocal performances and the colors with backgrounds are just incredible even some of the traditionally animated sequences done in 2D animation are superb. It's a fresh and creative adaptation of the book without bathroom humor or reused jokes but good timed humor, the film does offer a big moral that sends out like a message to the audience as this is a must see animated movie.

This Blu-Ray contains brilliant picture and awesome sound that makes you feel like you saw it at the theater! the extras are terrific like audio commentary, a sneek peek at ""Ice Age 3"", an ""Ice Age"" short, Picture-in-Picture bonus View where you watch the movie with a Who but only if you have a Bonus-View enabled player.

3540201,3,B001DTUTU8,"Faithful to the book, as well as the 70's TV movie, this new CGI presentation to me seems the best way to handle Geisel's work in this day and age. Made by the team that did Ice Age 1, 2, and soon 3, the scenery looks very well and retains the book's original drawings template through a modern 3D-like effect. Another bonus is when Horton daydreams of glory (twice), the animation takes a U-Turn towards the classic Dr Seuss cartoons to an 80's-ish Japanimation homage (and yes, it fits the movie). I only have two complaints: 1) the disc is barebones with just a commentary and a few trailers plus it's a one layer flipper with Wide and Full Frame. Doesn't Fox realize that kids' parents these days own 16:9 sets....be done with the Full Frame already and use that space for better things! And 2) even though the cast is all top-notch performers of today (how many movies does Seth Rogen need to be in in a row, huh?) everyone sounds so down-key it makes the movie less interesting. At times Horton needed a cup of Joe and why Carol Burnett was placed with a cast that half probably didn't know who she was seemed odd too. But it's a good movie that really brought the book to life without going too far into the real like ""The Grinch"" and ""The Cat In The Hat"" did. Worthy rental, but if your collection has those other two in it already, you better buy this one as well or your family's gonna hear about it too.

3540204,4,B001DTUTU8,"I'd hazzard a guess that few people in the United States and a lot of the English speaking world are unfamilar with the words and characters of Dr. Seuss.  Soon after his books were first published, Theodor Seuss Geisel who never quite earned the doctorate of his pen name, the wonderful world of Dr. Seuss, with all of it's whimsy and rhyme, became a favorite place for children and parents to visit on a regular basis.

One of the characters that made multiple appearances in the string of Seuss books was the gentle behemoth Horton the elephant.  Horton the elephant was introduced in the story Horton Hatches the Egg.  In that story, of course, Horton substitutes as the mother of an egg.  Several years later Horton makes a reapparance in the tale Horton Hears a Who.  Both tales show Horton the elephant to be a caring soul that feels responsiblity to care for those smaller than himself.  That becomes a mantra in the tale of the Who's as Horton tells his jungle mates that a ""person is a person, no matter how small.""

Because Dr. Seuss' tales included artwork and animation from the author the world of the Who's and the jungle where Horton lives are already clear and well established for most Seuss fans.  Like earlier films in the world of Seuss, the animators for Horton Hears a Who have stayed true to the images that fans grew up on and are familar with.  To my tastes, that's a good thing as it means fans aren't asked to accept someone else's interpretation of what the world of Seuss really should look like.

Now, I have to say, that even as the animators have stayed true to Seuss' work, they've also done a great job applying modern touches and using the latest animation techniques to achieve great results.  Some of the early jungle scenes on the Blu-ray disc version of the film are quite impressive and offer up detail and perspective that give the appearance that viewers are watching a 3D version of the film (minus the obligatory 3D plastic glasses).  The impact seems less noticable as the film progresses, and doesn't offer up the complete awe factor of say Kung Fu Panda or Disney's Ratatouille, but it's quite nice in it's own right.

The voice acting from everyone in the cast is well done with no one over-playing their roles or taking too much attention from the story.  That should be probably credited not just to the voice actors but also to the film's director and producers, all of whom shared a role in creating the finished product.  One cast member of note that I must thank the director and producers for pulling into the project is narrator Charles Osgood.  I doubt anyone else that could have taken on the role could do that job as smoothly and perfectly as Mr. Osgood did.

Horton is definitely worth the purchase for Seuss fans, and certainly worth at least a rental (Unbox, hint, hint!)  The Blu-ray version includes both Windows Media and iTunes compatible digital copies to add value to the product.",1229126400,,2950,4.627639155470249

Also featured is Steve Carell, who is quickly becoming a favorite of mine. He plays the voice of the Mayor of Whoville.  In animated films, I feel that success is truley acheived when the cartoon and the voice become one.  I was continually reminded of this concept during this feature.

Yes, Horton is right and the rest of the ""Big"" world is wrong, but in the original Seuss is kind to both sides. In this adaptation the bad guys are unrelentingly shrill and unpleasant, while Horton is annoyingly superior all the way through. Neither side is able to convincingly grow or learn. Among the ""Who,"" the characters are almost as thin, although there is a very slight story about a father and son learning to work together. I also found the animation unsatisfying. It is very good -- smooth and colorful -- but it is not Seussian.

You feel when watching the film that everyone's enthusiasm at Blue Sky was poured into each frame and of course it must have helped with the voice talents of Steve Carell and Jim Carrey leading the way, as their characters were superbly animated enhancing every line and word which effortlessly tripped off their tongues. The look of the film is true to Seuss, you can see it from start to finish and on the Limited edition DVD set and Blue - Ray release you have extensive footage showing how they created the Seuss look for the characters and their environments.

Blue Sky studios has been making films which try to present before children narratives which convey the big picture; in Ice Age the idea of forgiveness and of surviving together is central to the story and characters development, in Robots the idea of staying true to yourself motivates the lead character and inspires those around him to do only good in the world and in Horton, which is a Seussian story, we are presented with a character who must over come adversity in order to save a world. Horton sees that we are all responsible for the our environments well being and for the well being of those around us and that a better world is one where we support each other since we are all interdependent on each other for survival. Horton is a fine metaphor for mans place in the cosmos as custodians of our fragile planet. This film is rich in metaphorical layers.

Blue Sky studios has the ability to echo the zeitgeist of our time, this gives them the edge over Pixar and - Disney especially, who are too preoccupied by what it means to be Disney and not focusing enough on what it means to tell a story. I am probably being unfair to the Disney studios but when they pipe their mantra about what it means to be Disney it has the reverse affect on some people who really are only looking for well told animated stories and Walt himself would have stated such a view, Disney after all only reflected the spirit of his time and now Blue Sky does the same. I look forward to future films by this first rate animation company.

This Limited Edition is very different to the standard edition in that it has many extra features which take you behind the scenes of the film, an in-depth presentation at how they made the look of the film feel very Seussian and interviews with the cast and crew. If you are a budding animator or a fan of the film you won't be disappointed. There is an extra disc which is the digital copy the other reviewer was mentioning.",1224028800,,2886,4.5038167938931295
3540215,5,B001DTUTU8,"Let's be honest for a second, when you have three of the biggest comic actors come together in an animated feature, it was destined to be funny. For an animated Dr. Seuss adaptation, this is not just funny but damned hysterical and one of the best CG animated features to date. In recent years, the Dr. Seuss films haven't exactly delivered as expected so I think most people weren't expecting much, but honestly it's really great.

The story focuses around Horton the Elephant (Jim Carrey) who comes across a speck on a clover, on that speck is whoville and run by its Mayor (Steve Carell) who everybody in whoville thinks is crazy, he also struggles to get through to his only son JoJo. Horton promises the mayor that he will have the speck put in the safest place possible but something gets in his way, Kangaroo who's the snootiest of them all and enforces every rule. She thinks Horton is crazy and he's disrupting the children so she goes out of her way to stop Horton.

The CGI is really interesting as it's very cartoony in style to keep the Seuss feel, yet at the same time holds a level of authenticity that both blend together very well indeed. The whole concept of the film, although I'm sure it wasn't intentional is actually quite interesting. I'm not talking about our planet being in the trunk of an Elephant, but the whole possibility of there being something much much larger than our world operating in exactly the same way we do. Our planet is merely a speck in the vastness of our universe, what makes it so impossible that we are a world within a world? I know, I'm getting all philosophical so I'll leave it there, but you know what I mean.

The comedy is quite slapstick in style as Horton finds himself in quite awkward situations along his quest to get whoville to safety. Within whoville the mayor finds himself in unusual capers to convince whoville of Hortons existence and getting to know his son JoJo. One of the more comical scenes in the entire film is the bridge crossing scene. Horton is trying to cross a rickety bridge which is very unlikely to support him and it causes quakes in whoville. The mayor is in the dentists and a shake leads to the dentist poking him in the arm with a numbing needle which is actually really funny.

An overall awesome film which is something for all the family.",1221955200,,2329,4.524940617577197
3540216,5,B001DTUTU8,"AT LAST! A Dr. Seuss movie that is...Seuss!

Perhaps I should say, first of all, that Dr. Seuss was, at least the estimation of many, a literary genius--though, as goes without saying, of a special variety. There is good reason to suspect that his legacy will survive right along side of Mother Goose, the Brothers Grimm and Hans Christian Andersen; with the passing centuries, his stories may well only become more and more synonymous with classic, timeless fairy tales and children's fables. He was ahead of his time in more ways than one, and what his editor at Random House has recently said of him is almost a truism: ""What his books have to say about fairness, discrimination, peace, the environment, consumerism, and humanity in general is finding more advocates each year.""

Was Dr. Seuss politically correct? In his beginner books, Dr. Seuss helps children to read by showing what they already know; he mixes a few hundred words from a child's vocabulary with phonetic nonsense words--while at the same time coining new words. He remains true to the fact that alphabetic language is not just a matter of phonics, while at the same time not putting on dreary airs that phonics has nothing to do with alphabetic language. He also tells meaningful stories without talking down to his readers; he tells truths that children can understand but ones which adults need every bit as much to hear. In 'Green Eggs and Ham,' for example, he reminds us not to judge things we don't understand, and that persons can freely be who they are--'I am Sam'--while at the same time not pretending a sweeping presumption that 'good' is purely relative and that 'right and wrong' are simply a matter of the situation: While oblivious to being bombarded by Sam's arguments--'Would you like them here or there?...in a house...with a mouse?'--the character still concludes: 'Say!...I do! I like them, Sam-I-am!...I will eat them ANYWHERE!'  In 'The Sneetches,' he points out the absurdity of racism--but free of the hidden prejudice which offers equality as a concession--; 'that day, all the Sneetches forgot about stars, and whether they had one or not, upon thars.' Thars? And in 'Horton Hears a Who' (which invokes Seuss' all-important, whole language concept, 'who-ville'), he teaches that a person's a person, no matter how small--yet with the one still in the kangaroo pouch being that last to realize it: 'ME, TOO!' Political correctness may be defined as morality without any tie to truth. Dr. Seuss tongue-ties the most elaborate political correctness--in favor of the simplest of truths.

I've long been a fan of the cartoon versions of both 'How the Grinch Stole Christmas' and 'Horton Hears a Who,' and, that being said, I also do think this cinema, computer animated version of the latter is the best ""action"" adaptation of Seuss' yet made. Visually as well as otherwise, this film somehow or another is unsurpassed in capturing Seuss--and I think 'Horton Hears a Who' is Seuss' masterpiece. Refreshingly, unlike some other movie renditions of Seuss--which have sometimes even seemed intentionally ugly (something not very Seussian)--: who-ville is simply who-ville, as Seuss-like as can be. A delight--and perhaps even something before only beheld in the imagination--even given Seuss' unique and distinctive illustrations in his books; certainly the best use of pure CGI I've seen (not overcoming, of course, its intrinsic limitations).

Yet there is also a curious dimension of the film, one which, perhaps despite itself, only goes to show Seuss' genius. The movie takes several liberties with the book, as movies do, but two are especially worth mentioning: In the film, the mayor of who-ville is made out to be the father of a big, even 'absurdly big' family--though of many many girls and just the one boy the mayor wants as heir--; it is the defiance of the baby kangaroo, living in Horton's own Jungle of Nool (albeit still in its mother's pouch), that, in siding with Horton, changes the mind of its mother, who then also finally realizes too that there really are tiny people in the speck on the clover. In the book, by contrast, the mother kangaroo changes her mind on her own, after hearing what Horton could hear all along with his big elephant ears--telling Horton that 'I'm going to protect them with you'--with the baby kangaroo merely echoing her. Curious here too is that the film even throws a punch against home schooling, having the narrow minded, prejudiced, kangaroo mother, speak on its behalf. What was the point of these liberties? To poke fun at big families and home schoolers? Yet these very twists also come together in the end, when in a special way it is just these children of the who-ville mayor, joining forces with the baby in the kangaroo pouch, that finally succeed in conveying the message that Horton tried to convey in vain: 'We are here! We are here! We are here! We are here!' Hollywood underscores Seuss' pro-life message? Curious...

Was that dimension already in the book, or not? The standard response of Seuss' widow: no. Was giving a different response the intent of the makers of this movie? That might be strange. So do we have here, instead, a sort of blow-back from a fumbled attempt to man-handle Seuss--and make him speak politically-correct-ese? Was this an attempt automatically foiled, like trying to escape from Chinese finger-cuffs by force, or tampering with a child-resistant cap on a medicine bottle?

Some people say that the masterpieces of Mozart or Beethoven or Chopin cannot be truly appreciated or understood unless you know the biographies of the artists, because art, ultimately, is self-expression. Other people say that if art is nothing but self-expression, then the best artists would and should never be appreciated or understood by anyone but themselves. Yet other people say that an artwork itself tells us something about the artist, and in the great, timeless masterpieces, that is precisely because it shaped and influenced the artist as much as anyone else who will ever have contact with it and appreciate it.

If Dr. Seuss' 'Horton Hears a Who' does not have a pro-life message, then nor is about McCarthy and 1950s' paranoia, nor is it about celebrating diversity in opinions, values and lifestyles--nor even about the Japanese victims of the atomic blasts, to whom Seuss evidently, in some way, dedicated the story. Perhaps it rises above all of these themes in the same way that Chopin's etudes rise above his love life. Perhaps, in the end, its simply about how carefully we are willing to listen. Whatever the meaning of the story (it seems to me there are multiple levels, and multiple possible interpretations), what does not seem to be left to a matter of opinion is whether or not ""there are any whos in who-ville."" The truth is the truth no matter how small, and a lie is a lie, no matter how tall.

By whatever Seuss-like crooked lines it took to get there, this is a very good film, and faithful enough to Seuss to at least make people--young and old--think, laugh--and really care that all the whos in who-ville shout loud enough to be heard...",1219708800,,7140,4.938384679433805
3540217,5,B001DTUTU8,"First, a confession. I'm an adult, and I still absolutely love Dr. Seuss. In fact, I probably appreciate him more now that I'm old enough to more fully grasp the layers of social commentary beneath the whimsical tales. Like other works by Dr. Seuss, this one carries a message of kindness and social justice, and the movie entertains with (tasteful) slapstick humor kids will love and jokes for the adults, too.

Horton (voice acted by Jim Carrey) is a tender-hearted, if a bit goofy, elephant who hears a cry for help emanating from a tiny speck. Though he can't see the microscopically tiny people who issued the cry, he decides to save them, even though he is labeled crazy--even ""dangerous""--for helping the invisible ""Whos"" no one else can hear. Particularly threatened by Horton's behavior is the jungle busybody Kangaroo, who keeps her son sheltered in her pouch even though he is far too old (in fact, she ""pouch schools"" him to ensure that he is not corrupted by the outside world). Rallying the others against Horton, Kangaroo accuses him of ""teaching the children to use their imaginations,"" which could lead to ""anarchy."" Nonetheless, Horton is steadfast in his compassion for the invisible ""little guy""--which could be a metaphor for the poor, children, or any other marginalized group--insisting that ""a person's a person, no matter how small.""

Meanwhile, in tiny Whoville, the Mayor (Steve Carrell) struggles to make the people realize they are in peril because their speck lacks a safe home. Two major obstacles stand in his way: the city council cares only about keeping the citizens happily distracted with festivities like the upcoming Centennial, and the citizens refuse to believe that they are merely a tiny civilization floating precariously on a speck of dust. The Mayor knows that the little people of Whoville must raise their voices and make themselves heard...but the real hero is JoJo, the mayor's sullen, silent son and the smallest Who of all.

My only criticism is that a few of the characters were stereotypical: Vlad, the Russian vulture, whom Kangaroo hires to torment Horton, and Mayor's stereotypically ""sassy"" black secretary.

The animation is wonderful...a visual feast true to Dr. Seuss' trademark whimsical style. Particularly amazing is the intricate animation of the Whoville Observatory. One humorous sequence has Horton imagining himself the hero of a badly synchronized anime, which is sure to draw laughs from fans of the genre.

An endearing movie, true to the spirit of Seuss...great for all ages.",1213574400,,2548,5.115384615384615

There are fun historical references peppered throughout the film and endless levels of philosophical discourse.

Horton is dilly-dallying around when he suddenly hears a voice coming from a speck of dust drifting in the air.  He soon discovers that there is a village of Whos in the unrooted speck.

He shares his findings with his friends in the jungle of Nool.  His friends are hesitant to believe him since it's impossible to have inhabitants living in a dust speck.

Despite their disbelief, Horton continues to guard the speck and searches for a haven for the people of Whoville.  Kangaroo, bitter and adamant, seeks help from a vulture to destroy the speck since Horton must be losing his mind!

Meanwhile, Mayor Ned McDodd, of Whoville, must convince his people that their city is somewhat in danger.  No one believes him, not even his son and 96 daughters.

Horton and the mayor must find a way to send the message to their friends as well as finding a solution.

As it turns out, I'm glad I went. The film was a lot of fun, entertaining the whole way. Jim Carrey and Steve Carrell were excellent choices for the main cast.

What really impressed me though, is that the film stayed within it's G rating. Unlike many children's films of the time, 'Horton' does not contain anything that I would categorize as innapropriate, with one POSSIBLE exception. (*see below)

Overall, I found it very enjoyable and funny. Some of the better parts included the Japanese style anime sequence, a *certain hilarious line (""In my world there are only ponies, who eat rainbows and poop butterflies"") and my personal favorite, the musically stirring finale.

3540221,4,B001DTUTU8,"The classic Seuss tale makes it to the big screen and I was very happy with the results.  I usually find that children's books made into movies can be unnecessarily long and drawn out to make a decent movie time; therefore they tend to drag a bit for this big kid at the theater.  I thought this one was great, a perfect length and it held the interest of my two year old niece who made her debut at the theater that day.  When the movie was over she excitedly asked ""are we going to watch it again?""

This movie has all the quirky scenery that you expect from Dr. Seuss; from the funky trees and crazy houses, to the wonderfully imaginative Who's, nothing disappointed.  I was a little afraid to see this as Jim Carey usually grates on every nerve I have with his overacting and hyperactive persona, but he made a delightful Horton and I found myself enjoying him for the first time in years.

I recognized a lot of the voices and thought them extremely well cast; Carol Burnett as a villain was a surprise and a treat.  My sister and I laughed out loud a lot throughout this film, we enjoyed it as much if not more than our kids.  The lessons in Horton Hears a Who are simple and one can't help but think how the world would be a better place if everyone had a little more Horton in them.  I really found the whole movie fun and this is definitely a movie I will purchase when it makes it to DVD.

3540222,4,B001DTUTU8,"In 1953, a doctor named Seuss wrote a book,
It is really quite good, you should have a look.
There have been many films made, in the decades since,
Based on the doctor's other works, most would make you wince.
Turns out, all it needed was some fine work by comedic actors,
And a lot of great, colorful CGI animation to bring the doctors
Work to life.

Horton (voiced by Jim Carrey), an elephant who roams the jungle of Nool, is a mentor - teacher to the younger animals and a bit wacky in his own right. One morning, while bathing, he hears a tiny voice and realizes it is coming from a tiny speck floating by his ears. He saves the speck and allows it to land on a flower. But Horton is the only one who can hear the tiny voice and Kangaroo (voiced by Carol Burnett) wants to prove decisively Horton has made a mistake; as the leader of the jungle, she must be right and more importantly, prove to everyone else she is right, including her son, Rudy (Josh Flitter). But Horton heard something and soon begins to communicate with the Mayor of Whoville (Steve Carell) who has 96 daughters and a young son named JoJo with his wife, Sally (Amy Poehler). Things are always good in Whoville, so when the Mayor begins to communicate with the voice from the sky, he begins to realize they may have some trouble on their hands. But no one in Whoville will listen. Kangaroo asks Vlad (voiced by Will Arnett) to help her stop Horton and maintain the status quo. Horton decides the only answer is to take the small speck to a safe cave on the top of Mount Nool. But there are more than a few obstacles along the way.

Co-directed by Jimmy Hayward (who comes from Pixar and ""Robots"") and Steve Martino (who also worked on ""Robots""), the use of CGI seems to be the perfect medium to bring Seuss to life. Think about it. All of Seuss' drawings have roundness to them even though they are primarily pen and ink drawings, everything is always moving and bent, and CGI lends itself beautifully to this. The same film, done in traditional two-dimensional animation would be a very different beast. It might more faithfully capture the look of Seuss, but the ability of CGI to capture lifelike details helps to make these characters come to life.

Given the status of the original material, it is a classic of children's literature and many generations have and will continue to grow up reading the work of Dr. Seuss, it is important for the filmmakers to stay true to the spirit of the original. I was initially concerned about the lack of ""Seuss"" I heard in the trailer but was pleasantly surprised to find they retained most of this for the narration, which is voiced by Charles Osgood. Naturally, when you take an illustrated book which is probably forty pages long, it becomes necessary to extrapolate and add to the source. When the characters speak, they speak in more normal, human patterns, leaving the Seuss-isms for the narrator. Normally, this is exactly the type of thing that would set me off and begin pulling apart the story, the performances, and the animation. But in ""Horton Hears a Who"" it works. Carrey and Carell, and the rest of the voice cast play it pretty natural, allowing the dialogue to speak for itself.

This doesn't mean that Jim Carrey doesn't do a little bit of `ad lib'. Much like Robin William's Genie in ""Aladdin"", Horton is a `free spirit' and ends up talking to himself. As he walks through the jungle of Nool, it doesn't take a lot to set the large, kind elephant off on a tangent, playing different characters, talking to invisible animals. Carrey does a very nice job with the character, adding some of his trademark, fast-paced humor while retaining the innocence of a character created for a children's book. Carrey's Horton imagines friends and places that aren't there while playing and interacting with the creatures that actually exist. Horton is a fun loving guy and a joy to watch.

Steve Carell plays the Mayor of Whoville. With a huge family of 97 children, one of which is his son, he has a lot to look after. But Whoville is a magical place where nothing ever goes wrong, so he doesn't have a lot to worry about as Mayor of the strange little town. Carell brings his trademark energy to the role, making the Mayor a bit scattered, but in a playful, enjoyable way. He seems as though he would not have it any other way.

Because the people of Whoville live without problems, the Mayor finds it difficult to convince them when he begins to realize something is wrong. When the weather begins to change erratically and there seem to be intermittent earthquakes, the Mayor soon realizes something is wrong. Then, he begins to hear a voice. Horton is communicating with him and it takes a little bit of convincing for both of them to accept they are talking to others; the Mayor can't believe he is talking to someone outside of his world, Horton can't believe he is talking to a living being on a speck sitting on top of a flower. But they each come to believe the other and set out to work together.

""Horton Hears a Who"" seems designed to be a parable for the problems in the world, and since it was written in 1953, I can only imagine what Seuss might write today. The legend is he wrote ""Horton"" shortly after a visit to the recently bombed Japan and modeled Whoville after some of the cities he visited. Perhaps the most famous line, ""a persons a person no matter how small"", is retained in the film and used a couple of times. The message of this sentiment is pretty clear and resonates even louder when you consider the inspiration for this book.

""Horton Hears a Who"" is the first modern adaptation of a Dr. Seuss classic that gets it right. Forget the abysmal live action versions of ""The Grinch"" (which also starred Carrey, but under a lot of latex and make-up) and ""The Cat in the Hat"" starring Mike Meyers. This is the first film capturing the spirit, the tone, the look and the feel of the classic children's book. It is the first film to rightfully carry the moniker ""Dr. Seuss"".",1207267200,,6024,4.520183486238532
3540223,4,B001DTUTU8,"Let's start with the conclusion so you won't need to read my ramblings; this is a good family film.  Other than a few mildly scary moments, parents really have nothing to fear from this movie.  The animation is exactly what it should be and the voice actors are nearly perfect (I liked them all, rare for me).  I laughed out loud several times.  I recommend you take your family to see this.  If you are a fan of computer animation I would also recommend it, though it has nothing really new to offer technically speaking.

Concerning the title of this review.
First, let's address why Dr. Seuss has not been done right on the big screen... ...yet.

-""Cat in the Hat"" was a big budget piece of slurry.  Young kids enjoy it for its color and crazy antics.  Perhaps the worst thing Mike Myers has done.  Adults enjoy it because they are out of their minds (or does it just seem that way to me?).

-""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" was only slightly more tolerable than CITH.  Jim Carrey is at his most obnoxious.  This charming tale is dragged through the mud. It's becoming clear that Dr. Seuss does not translate to live-action very well.

-None of the TV cartoon efforts were really feature films, though I think they were nearly perfect translations of the books to Small Screen (other than music that often became dated).

This brings us to 2008s ""Horton Hears a Who"".  Starting with...

... what has us closer to enjoying a Dr. Seuss film done ""right"":

-Computer animation might be the perfect format for translating Dr. Seuss to the big screen.  Graphically, everything looked like a Dr. Seuss book in bright and wonderful 3D.  If the world of Horton were real, this is what it would/should look like in my mind.

-The voice actors all did, at least, good jobs.  Jim Carrey was under control and actually quite loveable and funny as the soft spoken Horton.  Steve Carell was equally suited to his role as the Mayor; a bit flighty yet noble.  Carol Burnett as the paranoid and parochial kangaroo was a pure professional.  I love Carol Burnett but hated this Kangaroo.  The narration by Charles Osgood was perfect.  I can't think of anyone better.  The rest of the voice cast of fairly famous people was at best enjoyable and at worst nondescript.

-This story needed to be stretched to make it a feature film.  The writers did a good job of adding to the story without actually changing it.  They basically took the scenes from the original and added detail and visual narration to them; very clever and faithful to the original.  There are plenty of funny moments added as well.

Why we still have not seen a Dr. Seuss film done ""right"".

-The original ""Horton Hears a Who"" responds to the paranoia of McCarthyism.  Though the theme of paranoia is still present in the 2008 version, it is watered down or translated to represent censorship in general.  Horton is ""accused"" of sparking the kid's imaginations with fabrications of people living on a speck.  Most people today believe all voices should have a chance to be heard, so it does not elicit the same emotional response the original did.  I'm not sure this could be fixed in the current environment, but it is a problem that weakened the films impact for me.

-The 2008 version almost completely ignores the silly, fabricated ""Dr. Seuss"" words.  Charles Osgood's narration is the only element taken word for word from the book.  I'm not sure this is a bad thing (it may have gotten tedious) but a little bit of ""Seussian"" jargon might have given the film a better Dr. Seuss feel.  Again, this is something that I debate in my own mind; would ""Seussian"" language enhance or hurt the feel of the film?

-The Small screen version had many songs.  The 2008 version has one; ""Can't Fight This Feeling Anymore"" by REO Speedwagon.  Beside the fact that I hate this song, it really smelled of Hollywood marketing.  I was surprised the Whos weren't all holding Coke cans in their hands.  Could they have not come up with a strong original song that would stand the test of time?  This one just bugged me.

-The anime sequence; a very humorous but wildly out of place sequence fresh out of Horton's imagination.  This really did great harm to the feel of the film being ""Dr. Seuss"" like.  I thought it was funny though.

I think that's enough.  In the final synopsis, this is a highly enjoyable film with great acting, great visuals and a few good laughs and still a good message.  I will definitely buy the DVD. My wife and I both enjoy animated ""kids"" films but came away not completely satisfied with this.  I'm still not sure if I captured why it felt somewhat incomplete or ""not right"".  The good news is this is much closer to being right than the prior Dr. Seuss big screen debacles.  I recommend this for families and animation fans; everyone else is on their own.",1207008000,,4825,4.590855803048066
3540224,4,B001DTUTU8,"In the middle of March, with the kids out of school
In the heat of the day, `cos the tropics aren't cool
We were watching ....enjoying the cinema's joys...
When Horton the elephant first heard the noise

When Horton stopped splashing we learned that the sound
Came not from the trees or the stones on the ground
A small shrieky voice was appealing for help
But all Horton heard was a faint little yelp.
He heard it because of the size of his ear
So big and so wide and he knew it was clear
That the scream was attached to a speck in the air

We know from the tales that the scientists tell
That no speck of dust should be able to yell
So Horton the elephant quickly worked out
That some tiny creature was shouting the shout
A creature too small to be seen with the eyes
With a voice that belied its diminutive size

So sweet gentle Horton he rescued that speck
He placed it in clover, a small golden fleck
He pledged his protection, because after all
A person's a person no matter how small

Perhaps Horton bit off MORE than he could chew
When he crossed with the likes of the sour kangaroo
Who rallied the animals to go get the clover
To end his delusional rant, and moreover
To stop him corrupting the minds of our young
(This kangaroo chick was just too highly strung)

If you've read the story you know how it ends
It's good to have faith in the strength of your friends
There's no need to touch, or to see or to hear
To believe that there just may be people out there
Who'll stand by your side no matter the weather
And prove that we CAN make things happen together

It varies a little from Seuss's long verse
But watching the film, well, they could have done worse
The anime bit was a little bit weird
And the moldy old vulture had some kiddies scared
Carrey and Carrel and Carol are fine
But I don't think this movie is top of the line
I'll give it a rating of 4 - pretty cool
For this Seussian tale from the jungle of Nool.

Horton agrees, but must deal with the Kangaroo (Burnett) who does not believe in anything she cannot see.

""Horton"" is the best motion picture adaptation of Dr. Seuss' work.  Better than ""Granch"" and far better than ""Cat in the Hat"".  The computer animation better suits the characters created in childrens' books many years ago.  Carrey and Carell do solid jobs as the two leads, and the rest of the voice talents are good as well.

There are marvelous Seuss-like characters animated on the screen, and their personalities match 100% those of the original two-dimensional Horton, Morton and friends who graced the pages of the good Dr.'s wonderful book.

My fondest memories of Horton include his egg-hatching episode. But that in no way diminishes the delight of seeing our old Elephant companion, dancing and prancing his way up a mountain side---through myriad obstacles---to a safe little cave where the Whos and their Whoville can safely reside.

3540227,5,B001DTUTU8,"Theodore Geisel as Dr. Seuss wrote and illustrated some great children's picture books which taught some real life lessons beyond the silly language and whimsical drawings. HORTON HEARS A WHO with its theme of ""a persons a person no matter how small"" is among the best.  However when I heard a film was being made out of it I couldn't get excited.  Hollywood's version of THE CAT IN THE HAT has to be one of the worst (as well as the most tasteless) ""family"" films ever made and the Jim Carrey live action version of GRINCH couldn't compare to the holiday animated TV classic from the 60's.

Yet this Blue Sky animated production of ""Horton"" is miraculously almost perfect.  Both Horton's native Jungle of Nool  and the Who's universe ( a speck on a clover flower) are brought brilliantly to surreal life with cutting edge CGI graphics.  The voice actors are great with Jim Carrey (not overacting this time or maybe his goofy style is just more suited to animation?) as the kind hearted pachyderm Horton.  Carol Burnett is fantastic as Horton's  kangaroo nemesis who wants to keep ""the children safe"" from their imaginations.  The eccentric but lovable  mayor of Who-ville is played by the consistently funny Steve Carrel.

The narrator was great as he read the Seuss rhymes during points of the story.  The voice acting was strong with Carell and Carrey really giving it there manic best.  Carol Burnette was also strong in her role as a kangaroo.  I thought the humor was solid with most of the jokes working well.  I still laugh at the Vlad joke when I think about it.

3540230,4,B001DTUTU8,"Let's start with the easy part. Whoville is as Seussian as one could hope, right down to the last leggy contraption and skewed piece of architecture. The Jungle of Nool comes across just as well - you can't tell the plants from the animals until one smiles at you, and maybe not then. The animators had the good sense to leave most of their fancier effects at home, and use those other few with generally good taste. The animators' restraint let the good doctor's story come through about as well as one could hope. Unlike other recent movies, this at least lets me enjoy my childhood memories of the original.

It's not the original, though, not by any means. That was short enough to read end to end when putting a kid to bed, without tiring your vocal cords. An awful lot happened on the way to making it a feature-length movie. The good news is that most of that lot wasn't too awful. Oh, the pasted-on bad guy, that was very un-Seussily done, but most of the rest fit the spirit well enough. At least, it seemed to. Now I have to go back and check again, but that's not such a bad thing either.

It's a good kids' movie. It's pretty much just a kids' movie, though. The best kids' movies have plenty to keep the ticket-buying grownups entertained, too, and I'm afraid this doesn't rise to their needs. But it keeps the kids happy, judging by the little voices I heard laughing throughout - when I could hear them over my own laughter.

Carol Burnett plays the local jungle busy-body kangaroo.  The mayor is played to perfection by Steve Carell and befriends Horton.  They set out to find a safe spot for the speck to survive.
It's filled with gorgeous characters and clever lines and it was so enjoyable.  The humor is great throughout and the animation is terrific.  I highly recommend you going to see this whether you've read the book or not, or have kids or not, or are a kid or not.  It is fun for everyone.",1205971200,,1053,4.241206030150754
3540232,4,B001DTUTU8,"Horton Hears a Who! is a lively film that will entertain the entire family.  One of the film's themes pertains to believing in one's convictions no matter how small or large it may be.  Horton the elephant (Jim Carrey) holds an entire community of Who-ville in the palm of his hand, or in his case, around his trunk.  His trouble begins when he hears sounds coming from a pink colored clover, Horton tells all the animals about his discovery.  And one of those in great disbelief is the kangaroo (Carol Burnett); she does not tolerate the nonsense and hires a vulture-like bird to get rid of Horton's clover.  However, on the flip side, the Mayor of Who-ville (Steve Carell) has a few skeptics of his own.

The film focuses on the various dilemmas that Horton and the mayor attempt to resolve.  First, Horton attempts to find a permanent place for Who-ville so that none of the creatures of the jungle may harm it.  Second, the mayor has to decide to hold the annual community fair.  Third, the mayor is also having problems with his goth-like son, JoJo (Jesse McCartney), who has not spoken a word in his life, is going through adolescence, and is somewhat resilient in following in the family business of becoming the next mayor of Who-ville; for those who watched Little Miss Sunshine, his character bears similarities to the boy in that film.

Overall, Horton Hears a Who! is filled with fun and excitement.  Directors Jimmy Hayward and Steve Martino and a cast of artists provide an exceptional adaptation and replication to Dr. Seuss's beloved animated tale along with a few other surprises.  Indeed, there are plenty of laughable moments for all to enjoy.",1205625600,,1662,4.7526132404181185
3540233,5,B001DTUTU8,"When Ron Howard's version of ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" was released in 2000, I was amazed at the artistry, with the world of Dr. Seuss being brought to life through whimsical sets, creative make up and costumes, and impressive special effects. But even then, it still didn't feel entirely Seussian; the limits of live action filmmaking were present from the start. Such a problem doesn't exist in the case of ""Horton Hears a Who!"" a computer animated cartoon that looks and feels exactly the way a Seuss story should look and feel. Of the three films made from his material, this is the first one that completely convinced me to believe what I was seeing. It's also the only one with compelling characters and deeper levels of story. This is wonderful because it tells me that the filmmakers had all audiences in mind, not just children.

""Grinch"" alumnus Jim Carrey voices the title character, a happy-go-lucky elephant living in the lush jungle of Nool. On the fifteenth of May, his big ears detect noises from a speck of dust floating in the air. It soon lands atop a fuzzy pink flower called a clover, and at that point, Horton realizes that the noises are actually voices. It turns out that the speck contains the microscopic city of Whoville, the home of the equally microscopic Whos. Theirs is a world fully realized, a world of misshapen buildings and swirling clouds and wacky gizmos, all of which are perfectly suited for such a bizarre-looking population. The limbs of the Whos are a little too thin and lanky. Their stomachs are a little too round. Their heads are a little too big. This is exactly the way they should look--when it comes to Dr. Seuss, odder is definitely better.

Horton soon makes contact with the Mayor of Whoville (voiced by Steve Carell), who not only has a city to run, but also has his hands full with a wife (voiced by Amy Poehler) and ninety-seven children (ninety-six of which are daughters). The upshot of this is negative for both main characters. No one in Horton's world believes that voices are emanating from a speck, least of all Kangaroo (voiced by Carol Burnett), an uptight woman who only believes in what she can see, hear, and touch. Likewise, not a single Who believes that their Mayor is communicating with an invisible elephant living in the sky. It all basically boils down to belief--just because you can't see something doesn't mean it isn't there.

As the Mayor struggles to maintain his city--recently plagued by tremors and immediate changes in climate--Horton remains determined to keep the Whos safe because, ""A person's a person, no matter how small."" Unfortunately, he has to deal with Kangaroo, who finds his line of thinking so threatening that she hires a ruthless vulture named Vlad (voiced by Will Arnett) to destroy the clover. Consider the fact that Horton's basic goal is to keep a flower safe from harm: In what way does this pose a threat to jungle life, seeing as Horton never once asked for anyone else's help? Obviously, there's no threat at all. Kangaroo is merely a control freak, demanding that others believe what she believes without stopping to question the status quo. The Mayor of Whoville has a similar problem with his elected officials, who overstep their bounds frequently and with no apology. Apparently, they would rather die than let the Mayor postpone the upcoming Who-centennial.

In case I haven't made it clear by now, yes, ""Horton Hears a Who!"" is in part a social commentary. But don't sell it short--it's above all a delightful family film, and probably one of the funniest of recent memory. There's a sequence in which Horton imagines he's in an episode of ""Pokmon,"" fighting off the bad guys with martial-art moves; the Japanese-style animation in traditional 2-D was absolutely hilarious. I also enjoyed the plethora of side characters, all of which add their own comedic touches to the story. Horton's best friend is a blue mouse named Morton (voiced by Seth Rogen), and his tail ends in an odd curlicue, as is appropriate for a Dr. Seuss character. There's also an odd but cute yellow puffball named Katie (voiced by Joey King), who tries to go along with Horton by holding a clover of her own: ""In my world, everyone's a pony, and they all eat rainbows and poop butterflies!""

The most prominent side character in Whoville is the Mayor's only son, JoJo. He's a brooding young man who refuses to speak to his father, not because he doesn't love him, but because he's afraid of being a disappointment. He's expected to become Mayor someday--like his father and his father's father and so on--and this is something he just doesn't want to do. Little does he realize just how important he is, not only to his family, but also to the entire city of Whoville.

As good as these characters are, there's no question that Horton is the best thing about the movie. He's a funny character, yet his personality isn't overshadowed by pure goofiness. He's loyal to those who are kind, yet he doesn't reject those who are not. He's loveable, yet he's not forced to take part in sappy subplots. Everything about the big fella is just right, and the same can be said for the movie as a whole. ""Horton Hears a Who!"" is the best Dr. Seuss adaptation yet, and it will probably be one of the year's best animated films; it's funny, smart, heartfelt, and engaging, a welcome combination for a film that easily could have been just another mindless cartoon. What we have here is rare: A family film that both children and adults will love. This elephant really is faithful one hundred percent.",1205452800,,5582,4.755417956656347
3540234,1,B001DTUTU8,"Very disappointing version of this story.  I was hoping to see the actual Horton, animation and all and this was a page turner with a voice attached.  Not what I was expecting at all.  Don't bother.",1140566400,,198,4.444444444444445

Instead, I suggest that for just a couple dollars more, you purchase the double feature of ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" which includes the original Horton and all ""Boil that dust speck"" excitement (which I still find exciting at 15.....scary) Plus you get to watch the Grinch!

3540237,1,B001DTUTU8,Very disappointing!  It was more like a still picture collection rather than a video.  I was looking forward to sharing the Video with my daughter the one I saw as a child. This was a different version with little to no  animation.,952905600,,231,4.4523809523809526
3540238,2,B001DTUTU8,"There was no tipoff in the Amazon description telling me that this video was only moderately animated.  I remember a fully animated version from when I was a kid and this was not it.  My little boy, who loves being read  the story, didn't care very much for this.
Hoffman's character accents  kept changing throughout his narration.  The audio quality was muffled and  sometimes hard to understand.
Personally, I don't understand why this  format of animation is even used.  Except that you can put your kid down  and walk away, there is no heightening of the experience over simply  reading the book.
I gave it a second star because it is a terrific book  and the video presentation of the book can't be all bad based purely on the  subject matter.
If the fully animated version is available, that would  be my preference.",939945600,,823,4.671328671328672
