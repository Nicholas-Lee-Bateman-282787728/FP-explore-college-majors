3425800,5,B001992O1E,"I stumbled across this intriguing series.  Not the usual werewolf story.
Quirky, sexy, entertaining, engaging, great visuals---just a wonderful supernatural show.
Not too much to be silly.  Just expand your imagination a little.
Actors you know and enjoyed, and occasional wolf actors that add a lot to the programs.
I hate I missed it when it was on TV, I wish they had more episodes.",1216166400,33,385,4.907692307692308
3425811,5,B001992O1E,"I love Grahm Green from the movie Thunderheart and many other movies and Lou Diamond Phillips, the episode where he gets sick and has visions is cool.  But it is a good series and NOT hokey, I like it very much and wish I knew where the filming was done.  The setting is beautiful in a heavily wooded lake area so it gives even more of a certain feel to it.  It also has some Native American Indian flair along with it mixed in the show.",1240876800,4,437,4.058139534883721
3425812,4,B001992O1E,"All nine episodes plus an unaired pilot are available at Ioffer.

Wolf Lake tried to overcome some of the problems that another quirky series based in rural Washington state suffered through ten years earlier (Twin Peaks). However, Lou Diamond Philips was miscast as the lead. Most episodes are rather talky with a disappointingly low ratio of action. Good series idea, only average execution, should have been on cable where it might have lasted.",1239667200,3,447,5.123287671232877
3425813,5,B001992O1E,"Today, I went over to my parent's house to spend time with them and my dad was watching an all day marathon of this series on Sci-Fi. I sat and watch with him and was hooked after one episode. I didn't even know it existed and I am sadden it was cancelled only after 9 episodes leaving it at a cliffhanger (and I hate cliffhangers). It is not your typical werewolf story. Lou Diamond Phillips stars in this series as a Seattle cop who proposes to his girlfriend, Ruby Cates, and she accepts only to be attacked and disappears. He goes to her hometown of Wolf Lake to answers about her disappearance. What you find out is Ruby is a werewolf and is the daughter of the Alpha dog. No werewolf can leave the town for fear of being exposed, but she fled not wanting to live to her obiligations as only being reserved only for the future alpha male. Brought back to wolf lake, Ruby is forced into marriage with another werewolf and held prisoner. Also, the town characters are not only trying to deal with typical problems like sneaking out to parties and dealing with boys but also going through a unstoppable change into becoming a werewolf and a member of this secret society.

I just don't understand how a show that had 2 emmy nominations just be cancelled like that.",1234656000,6,1266,4.4334763948497855
3425814,5,B001992O1E,"It definatley is a shame that this show did not last longer.
The acting was good, and the atmoshpere had a unique density to it. Wolf Lake was a wonderful show that I hope someone tries to make again someday; but even if that never happens (and it probably won't) at least these episodes are available (and hopefully soon!!!).",1230163200,,326,4.5423728813559325
3425815,5,B001992O1E,"Please do the DVD release soon!!! Love the series! It actually needs to be revived, maybe a newer generation of Wolf Lake teens and the older characters as parents!!!!! I want this series so bad!!!!",1222128000,,198,4.685714285714286
3425816,5,B001992O1E,"I too was disapointed that I didn't even know this was on television.  I agree with folks, this is a smart, funny, sad, lovely show!  As always, it seems, the smart and truly entertaining shows never seem to last so long.  I'm so glad DVD is available.  Eventually, I'll have all my favs available...comercial free, to watch when I want and save a few bucks on satellite!  Hope the wait isn't too long!",1219363200,3,402,4.4520547945205475
3425817,5,B001992O1E,"really enjoyed this series. rearranged my schedule so that i could be home when it came on.
while you knew it was fantasy, you really got involved with the characters.  not being able to see the last 2 episodes was very frustrating.
i really don't understand why they haven't put it out on DVD yet.  I know a lot of people who would buy it.
there was a lot of subtle humor that you had to watch close or miss.
I would really like to watch it again.",1217894400,4,448,4.079545454545454
3425818,5,B001992O1E,"This was a smart, witty show with lots of atmoshpere.  A shame it died so quickly.  Timing was bad too with 911 tragedy pre-empting a number of shows.  It would be great to have on DVD.  Thanks.",1216857600,7,194,4.162162162162162
3425819,4,B001992O1E,"I'd forgotten all about Wolf Lake until the sci-fi channel did a marathon last week and had it on TV the whole day. I was disappointed to find it hasn't been released even on VHS, what's up with that? I love the idea of people being able to change into such a beautiful animal, to run wild and free. I hope it will be released on DVD. I wish the series had run longer but I would like to own the ones that are done.",1216598400,19,415,3.8941176470588235
3425820,3,B001992O1E,"I'm waiting impatiently for this series to come out on DVD.  It was one of those shows that you both laugh at and enjoy sitting down to when you need easy entertainment.  The premise: a town where many of the inhabitants experience a ""change"" in their teens that is more than just the usual hormonal mayhem, and folks are divided into those who do and those who either don't or won't.  It's a bit thin on its face, but is nevertheless appealing to those of us who enjoy the idea of secret magical communities and transformation stories. The core conflicts are the mischief made by these powerful teen werewolves, who pay only as much attention to outside restrictions, such as school, as necesssary to keep up appearances; the ""will she or won't she"" anguish of the sherriff's pretty daughter, ripe for her transformation but torn between her father's values and the call of the wild (Dad married ""out"", declined to join the pack, and doesn't want the daughter to join, either); the search for Ruby Wilder, the missing fiancee of an outside law enforcement agent; and the fight for leadership of the next generation of the pack among the Cates family, who currently head it up.  The young people are, of course, deadly attractive (dig those white teeth!), and the adults go along with good humor and straight faces, notably Tim Matheson as Sheriff Donner, trying to keep his daughter from going over, and Lou Diamond Phillips as John Kanin, the cop who has traced his missing girlfriend, Ruby, as far as Wolf Lake.  Mary Elizabeth Winstead at an earlier point in her now slightly larger career, does a nice turn as Sheriff Donner's daughter, Sophia, trying to figure out whether or not to howl with the clan. Great fun, in this reviewer's opinion, rarely re-run on television, and would be a welcome addition to the TV library if only you all would get off your butts and release it!",1216252800,58,1883,4.693939393939394
8272659,5,B001992O1E,This was a good series cant figure out why it was cancelled. I see it is coming out on DVD in November. If this is a first time how come I bought it on Amazon about two years ago?,1346889600,,179,3.6153846153846154
8272660,5,B001992O1E,"Yes, another series that ended way too soon. Not given a chance to find its audience. Series like this that are a touch quirky take alittle longer to find its footing,& would of loved many more episodes of this unique series. I loved it & still do. Thankfully i've got it on dvd & have had it for quite a few yrs now & watch it atleast 3-5 times a yr. Would of loved to find out if Lou Diamond would of ended up turning & if he'd of found Ruby. I like the whole cast & the setting itself is another character, espically since humans have a hard time seeing into the deep dark woods at night & don't have a clue if anything is looking out at them... Excellant full moon,just love it.....",1334275200,2,686,4.088888888888889
8272661,5,B001992O1E,"Really liked Wolf Lake when first aired in the UK,in the early hours of the morning as I recall.
Some great character acting from the excellent Grahame Green among others,and a plotline that never gave away too much. Now we have several werewolf/vampire series which are in the same vein,but Wolf Lake stands the test of time in my opinion. Let's hope for a DVD release soon.",1329436800,,375,4.611940298507463
8272662,5,B001992O1E,ALL THOUGH I WAS A LITTLE DISAPONITED IN THE 1ST SEASON ENDING THE WAY IT DID. IT WASNT BAD  BOUGHT ON RARE FLICK THERE WAS ONLY 3 DISC AND ONLY 9 EPISODES BUT MORE DISAPONITED THAT IT WAS THE ONLY SEASON OUT ON DVD,1313625600,,215,3.8863636363636362
8272663,5,B001992O1E,"I discovered this series while recovering from foot surgery.  The Chiller Network ran a marathon, and I barged into the middle of the series.  I was hooked from my first episode, and have chased this series around on several other networks, always unable to experience it from beginning to end.  The story line is unique, and its cast of characters includes those to cheer for, those to laugh at, and the usual villians.  It is a shame it ran one season only, and ended in such a way as to leave viewers on a limb.  If there are no further plans to pick up where the series left off, there should be a full-length movie that ties everything together in order to give fans like me some closure.  Until such a time, I would expect a positive response to the series being made available on DVD.",1312070400,3,791,4.383561643835616
8272664,3,B001992O1E,Yet another series with so much potential canceled to soon. Wolf Lake was a nice escapism series and just when it started hitting its stride it was gone. But thanks to sci-fi and of course dvd/blu-ray it can be checked out again. Its also nice to see Paul Wesley as a wolf before he was a vampire. ;),1305590400,2,300,4.189655172413793
8272665,5,B001992O1E,I've manage to get Wolf Lake on DVD I bought from a website called iOffer for $9.00. All 9 episodes plus 1 unaired episode (10 episodes total). The problem with the DVD is that My DVD player can't play it but it can play on my P.C. Maybe it's because my DVD player is an old version.,1302307200,,283,3.982456140350877
8272666,5,B001992O1E,"I watched for the first time on Chiller Tv the series Wolf Lake and thought that it was great-acting, visuals, storyline, etc. Although I had many things to do, I couldn't stop watching it. Sadly thou, it was an all niter. I have just finished placing myself on notice when the series DVD becomes available.",1271116800,2,307,4.6
8272667,4,B001992O1E,"In ""Wolf Lake"" (2001 TV series) Lou Diamond Phillips as John Kanin, of ""The Dark Wind"" (1991) fame is once again is at the top of his form. He plays a police officer that mysteriously loses the love of his life. He searches for her at Wolf Lake. We all know what is happing but it is fun to learn of this mysterious place through the eyes of John Kanin. You will not get a blow by blow from me. However you will soon be wolfing down each episode.  I lucked out and saw it as a marathon.
