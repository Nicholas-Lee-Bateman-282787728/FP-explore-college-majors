Pick up this film quickly, UM administrators have already asked for the cover of the DVD to change as they do not want to be associated with this film.  Original cover has the UM logo on the helmet, new covers do not!!

4215970,5,B003X8CWBQ,"From Schnellenberger to Johnson to Erickson - the odyssey of ""The U"" is unfolded for the world to understand.

It should be required viewing for any player who thinks he has the muster to uphold the standards set in a time where America wasn't ready for talented, charismatic, focused and fun-loving football players from an untraditional football school. Playing with heart, desire and attitude are just the starters for the requisite Cane. This film embodies how ""swagger"" became part of the football lexicon.  How Dancing With The Stars was started (not really, but Warren Sapp even went pro in this area!). Everyone trash talked.  But the U did it out loud.  It isn't bragging when you can back it up. ""The U"" lays it out.

Billy Corbin's quest for the truth reaches into the past like you reach into box in the attic, looking for that photo of better days.
His craft is in letting the participants tell the story.  Don't expect to see University of Miami Administrators publicly trumpeting the accomplishments most schools would sell their souls to have and only dream to achieve. At the same time, those same bureaucrats cash the checks U trinkets, jerseys and outer wear bring in.  They denounce and some even try to hide the bad Uncle in the closet, hoping no one will notice he's part of the family.  Corbin did try to get many more angles on this story but was stone-walled at every turn.  Even without the President or Trustees, this film has merit and integrity.  What you see - happened - an no names were changed to protect the guilty!

You'll see and hear from Michael Irvin, Benny Blades, Alonzo Highsmith and Melvin Bratton, just to name a few.  They cherish their days at the U and are the founding fathers and the reason why when you see Ed Reed or Frank Gore or Jeremy Shockey or Santana Moss or Devin Hester introduce themselves on national television and their school is ""The U"".

If you're a college football fan, like or loathe The U, watch this film and you'll have a better understanding of the beast. It's not unlike the team you follow, these guys just didn't care what you thought about them. And frankly, even today, they don't care what you think about them.  They're older, grayer and a few pounds heavier, but their passion is the tradition they created, the rings they wear and the success they've obtained.

I dare you to watch this film with an open mind and not walk away with at the very least, an appreciation for where they came from and what they ultimately accomplished.

I was there and it DID HAPPEN.

4215999,5,B003X8CWBQ,"For a 10-year span, running from the 1983 season through the 1992 season, there were was simply no better team in college football than the Miami Hurricanes.  They were on a run of dominance that rivals all other dynasties in the long history of the college game.  In that 10-season span, Miami won 4 National Titles; they lost in the title game two other times; AND, in another two seasons were one, very narrow, regular season loss away from competing for the title again.  Oh, and they did this by being the most unapologetic, loud-mouth, obnoxious and absurdly talented team in the nation.

  ""The U"" is another episode in ESPN's great 30 for 30 series, and it covers a time when the Hurricanes were to college football what the Raiders of the 70's and 80's were to the NFL.  Trash talking, strutting and showing off seem common place to fans these days.  When the Hurricanes ascended to their first National Title under Howard Schnellenberger, and then soared to new heights under the brash Jimmy Johnson, no one had ever seen something like this.  These were players who didn't behave like 'good little children', which was expected by college administrators (including University of Miami 'stuffed shirt' President, Tad Foote, and behind the times Athletic Director, Sam Jankovich)

  As entertaining as it is to relive the grid-iron beat-downs that Miami leveled on its opponents (46-3 over Texas in the Cotton Bowl ring a bell??), ""The U"" goes beyond the hi-jinks.  Director Billy Corben (also responsible for the stunning expose ""Broke"") knows how to tell the story about how the Hurricanes, once a team that was so irrelevant that tickets were given away at the local McDonald's, became not only the best team in college football, but a symbol and an opportunity to a whole host of young athletes who grew up in the slums of Miami and Coral Gables.  They now had something to root for and something to try and strive to be a part of.  This is a because Schnellenberger (and later, Jimmy Johnson) knew how to reach out to these kids that the rest of the schools were ignoring as 'unsavory'.

  There are some great moments to this episode, such as the controversy surrounding Luther Campbell's (of 2 Live Crew) largesse towards the players and the 'walkout' against Penn State in the pre-game dinner before the 1986 Title Game.  The episode also gets a little sloppy in other areas.  It's laughable to hear from coach Dennis Erickson, and former player Mario Cristobal, gush about how impressive it was for Miami to have an undefeated season.  The treated it like it was a rare occurrence when, in fact, at least 2-4 teams each year go undefeated (meaning half can't even compete for the title).  The other sloppy area is the portrayal of the program going downhill when Butch Davis took over as coach.  In truth, the program was devastated by penalties and probation from the end of the Erickson era.  Davis rebuilt the Hurricanes to the point where they were competing in major bowls again by the end of the 90's, and he set the foundation for the National Title (Miami's 5th!) that the school won under Larry Coker in 2001.

  The awesome impact of the Hurricanes is witnessed by how many 1st-round draft picks there were in the NFL (many of whom continued to play great in the pros).  This is a throwback to a different time.  Even with Alabama's recent run of dominance (3 titles in 4 years), they still don't seem to be near the juggernaut that ""The U"" was in the 80's and 90's",1372636800,,3493,4.699013157894737

If you like the Hurricanes - it's a celebration and a justification of Miami's swagger. If you despise them - it shows many of the players preening around like a bunch of self worshiping idiots - particularly after the Cotton Bowl game against Texas. You - the viewer can judge for yourself. Enjoyed hearing the coaches speak  - particularly Schnellenberger, Jimmy Johnson and Dennis Erickson and one of the athletic directors  - Sam Jankoveich was sort of impressive.

But where the film fails is in its unapologetic look at the behavior of some of the players.  Robert Bailey's obvious glee at purposely knocking out another player is one example.  Randall Hill refusing to take responsibility for imbecilic post-TD idiocy at the Cotton Bowl is another.  While I applaud the work done by guys who came out of troubled neighborhoods, I also know basic sportsmanship and right and wrong.  To justify that behavior behind quasi-rascist screen of ""cultural differences"" is an insult to the audience.",1319760000,6,755,5.008

4216039,2,B003X8CWBQ,"While this film brought back plenty of memories of college football in the '80s, the story is told almost exclusively from the point of view of a University of Miami football booster. (Aside from its setting in a mostly white Florida suburb, the university itself appears hardly at all, except in the form of administrators who ""don't get it."") Indeed, the director, Billy Corben, is a University of Miami alumnus and a fan of the football program -- and it shows. Much of the tale is told through interviews, and the interviews are conducted almost entirely with former Hurricanes coaches and players. Among the few journalists included is a sports writer for a Miami newspaper who all but embodies the term ""homer."" The film does deal with the controversy the team's ""swagger"" sparked, but by the end an uninformed (and uncritical) viewer will conclude that America -- because it was too uptight? too racist? -- simply could not understand or appreciate such ""larger-than-life personalities."" That, apparently, is the only explanation for why television commentators at the time could watch a Miami team blow out an opponent and still call their play ""disgraceful"": the commentators also just ""didn't get it.""

Fans who found the Miami teams of the '80s unsportsmanlike, egotistical, needlessly provocative, and representative (as players and as coaches) of everything that was (and is) wrong in big time college sports are dismissed simply as out-of-touch fuddy-duddies -- as the university's president at the time explicitly is dismissed. That those teams were exciting and talented is beyond dispute: the U. of Miami won four national titles between 1983 and 1991. The players were far worse, however, both in their behavior and in the messages they sent as role models, than the fun-loving ""Bad Boys of Football"" the film tries to depict. But, as in the Faustian bargain the university made at the time, the film argues that the games and titles they won are the ends that justified their mean (and childish, crude, taunting,and sometimes illegal) behavior.

What's sad here is that the director missed a great chance to tell a story about race relations in the '80s (and still today) through clashing (and, in part, racially coded) ideas about sportsmanship, entertainment, self-expression, the relationship between competitors/rivals, etc., etc. It is not at all surprising that a number of students at and alumni of U. Miami have given this film five stars, because that seems to be the audience at which it is aimed. In the end, however, by telling only one side of the story, the director made a film only a little better than a slick promotional film from the Public Relations Department of ""the U."" It's a shame.",1305676800,6,2725,5.039911308203991

4216044,2,B003X8CWBQ,"The subject matter in this film was really interesting, but the director fails to present an even-handed look at The U.  Almost all the interviews are with former players who (understandably) defend The U.  When the documentary discusses the payments, the voice of reason in the picture is...Michael Irvin.  When Michael Irvin is the person giving the least biased interpretation, you know you are in trouble.  The documentary does not portray the players as altar boys, but it really glosses over some very serious indiscretions.

If you are a fan of The U, you will enjoy this documentary.  If you are really looking to learn about 1980s Miami or the racial tension of the era, I would recommend looking elsewhere.  Yes, the film mentions racial tension, but not in any way beyond what I knew from my very minimal knowledge at the outset (i.e. there were many poor black players on the team; Miami was a mostly white university in a good neighborhood; this was a shock to the players and the school).

This single disc version of The U does have the 4 Hurricane Football games in the special features section, under Condensed Games. This one may be the best of all of the 30 for 30 documentaries, along with ""From Elway to Marino : The 1983 NFL Draft.""",1473811200,,391,4.226666666666667
