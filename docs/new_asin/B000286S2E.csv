2066832,1,B000286S2E,"Who wants a cropped pan-and-scan edition? Who wants to see LESS of the original film frame?!!! Shame on you CTS for this poor, long-awaited release. The people who want to buy this film DO NOT CARE if there are black bars on the top and bottom. We like films released on DVD in their original aspect ratio!! Why the VHS mentality?

I will happily buy this set when they are released in widescreen, as they were intended to be seen.",1090972800,18,431,4.3875
2066833,1,B000286S2E,"GIDGET was shot and released in CinemaScope, and yet the DVD is an unwatchable panned and scanned copy, which crops out 50% of the frame. Unacceptable, especially since TCM airs the widescreen version on cable! The film is ruined; don't bother.

The sequels were not Scope; they do not suffer as much.

Avoid and boycott this DVD until they go back and do it right.",1090972800,196,365,4.6
2066834,1,B000286S2E,"I've been waiting for these films to be released on DVD so I could see the ENTIRE frame, not a cropped pan-and-scan portion of the frame.  Why did you decide to limit the image, Columbia?  It is so easy to just encode the entire original widescreen film and let the DVD viewer choose whether they want to crop it to fit their TV.  Send the originals to me and I'll encode them!  The more people that reject this release, the quicker we will see a proper widescreen release on the market.  Unfortunately Sandra Dee, I will be waiting longer to see thee.",1090886400,20,552,4.372549019607843
2066835,1,B000286S2E,"Gidget, a wonderful film for film buffs(it kicked off the beach movie genre), and 40 yrs later still a fine film in it's own right thanks to some sensitive writing a performances from Dee, Darren and Robertson, is unfortunately yet another victim of a bottom-of-the-barrel dvd issue by its studio Columbia/Tri-Star.

 For some reason, the execs there believe that this 45 yr old film will have more sales cachet to the fickle, superficial Wal-Mart crowd if it 2.35 scope ratio is hacked up to fill the screen of their  $45 Symphonic tv's .

 this leaves people who actually saw the film in the theaters way back when and would like to see it again, intact, for the first time in 45 years , as well as serious film fans who already understand and appreciate what letterboxing is- totally in the cold.

 Columbia, early on one of the finest of all the studios producing dvds, continues its slide into the gutter as the format finally starts to reach some maturity.

 my pre-order has been cancelled.

 if only more people who loved movies, and appreciated the art that went into them,  did the same, maybe the clowns in charge would eventually get the message.",1090627200,71,1158,4.678217821782178
2066836,4,B000286S2E,"The original Gidget is my favorite. I've seen it at least 50 times beginning when I was younger than she was when she made the movie. I have always loved Sandra Dee and with James Darren, it was the perfect teen romance movie. I think kids today should check it out to see how it used to be and maybe still can. It really was a time of innocence and there's nothing wrong with that. The other two Gidget movies just can't compare! But they are good for a rainy afternoon.",1090454400,,471,4.186813186813187
2066837,4,B000286S2E,"I've been waiting for the Gidget movies to come out on DVD for a long time, as I no longer have a VHS player.  I grew up on these movies, and was particularly obssessed with Gidget Goes Hawaiian.  I can't wait to get my pre-ordered copies of the DVD's as I had begun to despair that they would never make the conversion!",1090368000,2,320,4.145161290322581
2066838,1,B000286S2E,"I was all set to pre-order this DVD set of the first three Gidget films when I learned that they are pan & scan, not widescreen.  All three films were made in widescreen, and the original ""Gidget"" was filmed in Panavision--meaning that the pan & scan version will cut off 1/2 of the picture.  (I'm not sure if the other two Gidget films were Panavision (2.35) or 1.85 widescreen.)
If you're thinking about buying this as a permanent part of your DVD library, you may want to wait until Columbia does a proper job on the DVD.  Even if you don't have a widescreen televison now, you will before too much longer...",1089849600,63,611,4.4375
2066839,5,B000286S2E,"I grew up with these movies and in fact have two out of three of them on VHS already.  My daughters who are just entering their twenties enjoy them with me.  James Darren was my teen idol, and Sandra Dee was so sweet it was a joy to watch.  Now Gidget goes Hawaiian still gave me James Darren, but I also got to enjoy the dance and music of a variety of other stars, it takes me back to a softer time.  I can't say I enjoyed Gidget goes to Rome as much, but the scenery was worth it.",1088553600,,483,3.8484848484848486
2066840,2,B000286S2E,"The original ""Gidget"" movie is cute and definitely a '5-star' movie (the follow-ons, not so much).  But not this DVD.  Unbelievably, the movie on this DVD is formatted for television -- so it's lopped off on the sides. This is inexcusable, and disrespectful to the artists who created this film and to those of us who would like to own a copy.  You can stream it widescreen on Amazon, so why on earth could they not put a widescreen version of this film on DVD?  They make it a point to say it's been 'formatted for HD' -- but HD lopped off at the edges is pretty lame.  When you see the film in widescreen and then have to see this edited DVD version, it's painful.",1511481600,4,666,4.253968253968254

2066861,5,B000286S2E,"I'm adding a review to the other fine reviewers' voices here to recommend some another choice to Gidget fans. My wife and I got this film set, then watched our way through all three films over three nights. Each one has its strengths:

Sandra Dee is probably the best of the movie Gidgets, overall, because of her obvious fish-out-of-water innocence as she hits the beach. The joking label ""a girl and a midget is a Gidget"" seems to fit her perfectly. In the Hawaiian sequel, the new Gidget actually is more athletic and we see some real action on the water, plus some very professional dance moves. And, if you're along for the whole ride through Gidget's movie and TV career, the third film in Rome features some over-the-top comedy from that era that's fun to watch.

What made all of this more engaging was a documentary:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Accidental-Icon-The-Real-Gidget-Story/dp/B005966N06/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Accidental Icon: The Real Gidget Story</a>. We had not been aware that there was a real Gidget. We're old enough to have enjoyed Sally Fields on TV as Gidget, but not old enough to have experienced the late-'60s bestselling novel described by the real surfer known as Gidget and written by her father. This documentary tells that story with lots of great archival photosand it includes interviews with many women who now are professional surfers. Those women all credit the real Gidget with making the previously all-male sport something that they could consider.

We can tell you: Watching that documentary, either before or after you watch this trio of movies, will really add to your appreciation of this major trend in American culture back in the '50s and early '60s.",1496793600,2,1752,5.272401433691757

The first movie, ""Gidget,"" the original with Sandra Dee, and the third one, ""Gidget Goes to Rome,"" are the standouts - ""Gidget Goes Hawaiian,"" is somewhat mediocre.  James Darren is in all three, playing ""Jeff/Moondoggie,"" and he always does a great job of acting and singing.  The third movie has some hilarious, laugh-out-loud moments and creative ""daydream,"" sequences when Gidget is imagining her own scenes for a given moment.

This is called ""Pan & Scan"" because the transfer camera has to be programmed what part of the picture it will pan before it scans it to digital format.

Annette Funicello and Frankie Avalon which came out in the 60s
the Gidget movies are also surfer shows that came out in the
late 50s. All the Gidget shows are pretty good and are reminiscent
of a more innocent time in TV if you like the look and feel of
movies from the 50s and 60s you should check these out, if
your into computer generated special effects these are not
your type of shows.",1405123200,,451,4.317647058823529

I think there is a Gidget Gets Married movie and then there's one (that I think is called Gidget Grows Up) where she lives in New York City and goes to work at the United Nations building.  It starred Karen Valentine, if I remember correctly.  It's always seemed odd to me that they keep changing Gidgets, but they're still fun movies.  If you like the 60's type movies of teens, beaches, surfing and that sort of thing, you'll like it.  Gidget Goes Hawaiian has always been my favorite, but Sandra Dee is still great to watch, too.

2067202,5,B000286S2E,"I FIRST SAW PARTS OF ""GIDGET GOES HAWAIIAN"" WHEN I WAS ABOUT 14 YEARS OLD. MY BROTHER WOULDN'T LET ME SEE IT BECAUSE OF SOMETHING ELSE HE WANTED TO SEE. THEN IN ""1997"" I SAW IT AVAILABLE ON VHS. I WAS DELIRIOUSLY HAPPY. I BOUGHT IT RIGHT AWAY AND PLAYED IT ABOUT 15,000 TIMES. IN THE EARLIER ""90'S"" I HAD SEEN ""GIDGET"", BUT MY HEART WAS STILL WITH ""GIDGET GOES HAWAIIAN"". THEN I CAME ACROSS THE ENTIRE ""GIDGET"" SERIES ON DVD, BEING OFFERED AT THE TIME BY COLUMBIA HOUSE. NEEDLESS TO SAY, I IMMEDIATELY BOUGHT THE SERIES. AT THAT TIME I HAD NOT SEEN ""GIDGET GOES TO ROME"". I FOUND IT TO BE A DELIGHT TOO. ""GIDGET"" WAS BASICALLY ABOUT A TEEN-AGE GIRL WHO STARTS HANGING OUT AT THE BEACH BECAUSE SHE IS ATTRACTED TO A BOY KNOWN AS ""MOON-DOGGIE"". SHE DECIDES SHE WANTS TO LEARN HOW TO SURF, SO SHE BEGS HER PARENTS FOR THE MONEY TO BUY A SURFBOARD, PROMISING THAT SHE WOULDN'T ASK FOR ""ANOTHER SINGLE SOLITARY THING."" SHE THEN GETS INTO THE SURF SCENE AND EVENTUALLY INTO MOON-DOGGIE HEART WHICH LANDS HER HIS RING BEFORE HE IS TO RETURN TO COLLLEGE.

""GIDGET GOES HAWAIIAN"" LANDS GIDGET AND HER FAMILY INTO HAWAIIAN AFTER GIDGET'S FATHER SPRINGS HAWAII ON THEM AS A SURPRISE VACATION. GIDGET DID NOT WANT TO GO BECAUSE SHE AND ""JEFF/MOON-DOGGIE"" WERE HANGING OUT ON THE BEACH DURING HIS SUMMER VACATION FROM COLLEGE. WHEN SHE FINDS OUT ABOUT THE TRIP SHE GETS UPSET AND RUNS TO THE BEACH TO TELL ""MOON-DOGGIE"" ABOUT IT BUT HE DIDN'T SEEM TO MIND. SHE GETS UPSET, GIVES HIM BACK HIS RING, AND LEAVES HIM LOOKING DUMB-FOUNDED. WHILE SHE IS ON THE PLANE, HEADING TO HAWAII, SHE MEETS ""ABBEY STEWART"", WHOSE FAMILY IS ALSO ON THE PLANE, HEADING TO HAWAII. ""GIDGET"" AND ""ABBEY"" THEN MEET 3 OTHER FELLOWS WHO ARE ON THEIR WAY TO HAWAII TO HAVE FUN, BUT ""ABBEY'S"" GOT HER EYES ON A DIFFERENT FELLA, BY THE NAME OF ""EDDIE HORNER"" (MICHAEL CALLEN), THE DANCER. AFTER EVERYONE ARRIVES AND GETS SETTLED, ""GIDGET'S"" DAD NOTICES THAT ""GIDGET"" IS STILL MOPING ABOUT SO HE SENDS FOR ""JEFF"". WHEN ""JEFF"" ARRIVES IN HAWAII, HE FINDS ""GIDGET"" ON THE BEACH WITH ""EDDIE HORNER"", WHO HAD THE HOTS FOR GIDGET, THOUGH ""ABBEY"" HAD THE HOTS FOR HIM. AFTER HE CAUGHT ""EDDIE"" KISSING ""GIDGET"", HE GOES OFF IN A FURY AND WINDS UP WITH ""ABBEY"" WHOM HE DIDN'T KNOW HAD ALREADY MET ""GIDGET"". THEN PROCEEDS A COMEDY OF ERRORS. EVERYTIME THEY ARE ALL TOGETHER ""ABBEY"" GETS UPSTAGED BY GIDGET. ""ABBEY"" GETS JEALOUS AND DECIDES TO PUT AN END TO ""GIDGET'S"" CUTTING IN ONCE AND FOR ALL. SO SHE STARTS A RUMOR, MAKING IT SEEM AS IF ""GIDGET"" HAD BEEN MAKING OUT WITH BOYS. SHE TELLS THIS STORY TO HER MOTHER WHO THEN TELL IT ""GIDGET'S"" MOTHER. EVENTUALLY THE STORY GETS BACK AROUND TO ""JEFF/MOON-DOGGIE"" AND HE AND ""GIDGET"" PATCHES THINGS UP, LEAVING ""ABBEY"" WITH EGG ON HER FACE.

""GIDGET GOES TO ROME"" HAS GIDGET AND THE REST OF THE BEACH GANG HEADING TO ROME ITALY AFTER ""GIDGET"" CONVINCES HER PARENTS THAT SHE IS MATURE ENOUGH TO GO. ONCE AGAIN ""JEFF/MOONDOGGIE"" GETS HIMSELF INVOLVED WITH SOMEONE ELSE AND A SERIES OF COMEDY HAPPENS AFTERWARDS. GIDGET TOO GET HERSELF INVOLVED, WITH AN OLDER MAN, ACCEPT IT IS ONLY WISHFUL THINKING BECAUSE HE WAS ASKED BY HER FATHER TO KEEP AN EYE ON HER. GIDGET THEN KEEPS GETTING HERSELF INTO TROUBLE UNTIL EVENTUALLY SHE AND ""JEFF/MOONDOGGIE"" SOLVES THE PROBLEMS AND THEY RETURN HOME HAPPY.",1298851200,,3290,4.6030664395229985

2067208,4,B000286S2E,"This Gidget DVD set from Columbia-Tristar has taken a lot of criticism for being presented only in pan and scan. Yes, it's true. Also, the only extra feature is a few movie trailers for 2004 movies. Still, this DVD set has three Gidget movies and it's budget priced. This DVD set has:

Gidget(1959): This first Gidget movie stars Sandra Dee as Frances Lawrence/Gidget and it's based on the novel by Frederick Kohner. In this first film, surfer Jeff/Moondoggie(James Darren) and Gidget meet for the first time.

Gidget Goes Hawaiian(1961): Sandra Dee was busy acting in three movies in 1961 and the producers hired cute red-headed actress...the late Deborah Walley...to play Gidget. Walley had enough talent and charm to carry the role. James Darren returns as Jeff/Moondoggie. The first Gidget was a solid film, but Gidget Goes Hawaiian is my personal favorite film in the series. It's closer in spirit to the Sally Field Gidget TV show from 1966. While on vacation in Hawaii, a spiteful girl(Vicky Trickett) spreads rumors that Gidget is an ""easy girl"". There's a side-splitting scene where Gidget imagines that she's a ""fallen woman""! Carl Reiner plays Gidget's father in this film. Deborah Walley does some REAL surfing in this movie!

Gidget Goes to Rome(1963): This...is where the magic started to vanish! Cindy Carol was miscast as Gidget! There are dated jokes! There's only one surfing scene. Still, there are some redeeming factors. Jessie Royce Landis gives a good performance. John Williams(Star Wars, E.T., Raiders of the Lost Ark) wrote some quality music for this film. James Darren returns...and gives his final performance as Moondoggie. Don Porter plays Gidget's father in Gidget Goes to Rome and plays the same character in the Gidget TV show.

All three Gidget movies were directed by Paul Wendkos(Guns of the Magnificent Seven). Gidget movies are a reminder that kids have fun and they have to deal with angst as well!

This DVD set is a must for hard core Gidget fans!",1292544000,4,1989,5.015151515151516

Sandra Dee was the best, and in my opinion, the only Gidget. The second and third movies were just horrible! Yes they have James Darren back as Moondoggie, but why not bring back Sandra Dee if they were going to make sequels? Save your money, this set is not worth buying.

If you want to see Gidget in all its original beauty and not hacked to pieces like on this dvd set, tune into TCM they play it occasionally.",1235520000,9,637,4.264462809917355

2067242,4,B000286S2E,"Sandra Dee, Deborah Walley and Cindy Carol light up the screen as GIDGET in this box set of all three popular movies.  While the first movie (with Sandra Dee) is definitely the best, there's a lot to enjoy in the sequels.  James Darren is the only mainstay in all three movies, as Gidget's croonin' and swoonin' boyfriend Moondoggie.

GIDGET (1959).  Poor flat-chested bookworm Frances Lawrence (Sandra Dee) has the summer of her life when she joins a gang of surf-bums on Malibu Beach, led by Kahuna (Cliff Robertson).  Quickly earning the nickname Gidget (a mixture of girl and midget) she learns to surf and later gets ""pinned"" by handsome Moondoggie (James Darren).  Gidget's folks are played by Arthur O'Connell and Mary LaRoche.

GIDGET GOES HAWAIIAN (1961).  Gidget has transformed into a snub-nosed redhead (as played by Deborah Walley), yet Moondoggie and her parents hardly notice the difference!  This all-singing all-dancing sequel, filmed on location in Hawaii, features some lively musical numbers with Walley and Michael Callan; and a raven-haired ""ice princess"" for Gidget to battle with, played by Vicki Trickett.  Carl Reiner and Jeff Donnell step in to play Gidget's parents.

GIDGET GOES TO ROME (1963).  Another new ""look"" for Gidget (this time played by petite blonde Cindy Carol).  Gidget, Moondoggie and their friends traverse the sights of Europe with lots of romantic and comical misadventures.  Don Porter, who plays Gidget's father in this sequel, would later reprise the role for the 1965 sitcom starring Sally Field.  GIDGET GOES TO ROME also features 1960s cuties Noreen Corcoran, Trudi Ames and Danielle De Metz (not to mention Italian glamazon Lisa Gastoni).

Once again, Sony gives fans and collectors a raw deal with their treatment of the GIDGET movies.  Presented in fullscreen, the movies are riddled with print damage and other visual flaws (the first ""Gidget"" has ghastly blue stripes running through most of the second and third reels).  It would be safe to assume Sony has recycled the masters used for their old VHS releases.  At least the price is reasonable.

The 2-DVD set features GIDGET on it's own disc; GIDGET GOES HAWAIIAN and GIDGET GOES TO ROME are on a double-sided ""flipper"" disc.  There are no extras except for trailers of other Sony releases.",1198713600,34,2300,5.096256684491979

While I'm glad I found these great movies in a DVD collection, the formats are no different than the pan and scan VHS tapes that have been in circulation for so long.  The original film, in particular, suffers.  At least TCM airs it in widescreen, and then the color looks crisp, clear and glorious.  Columbia has done the same injustice to countless vintage gems, such as ""The Trouble With Angels"" and its sequel, ""Where Angels Go Trouble Follows"".  Viewers had to clamor for ""Tess"" to be released in widescreen format, a special edition, but much of the film's condition had not been cleaned up - lines across the screen, hissy sound.  Columbia also has an annoying habit for not including extras, except for some theatrical trailers; a few classic films (Gilda, The Lady From Shanghai, etc) are lucky to have a featurette or a commentary.

These movies and their stars deserve a much better reissuing and presentation on DVD than they have been given - film restoration is important in preserving film history.  I am holding out hope that Sony will rerelease the Gidget films and some of the aforementioned in better quality conditions someday, but my hair might be grey by then.  Here's a prayer that Sandra Dee's other great teen movie classic from 1959, ""A Summer Place"" (through Warner Brothers) due for a DVD release in a few days as of this writing, will be restored to widescreen, recapturing its theatrical glory that enchanted and captivated moviegoers way back when.",1170547200,5,1520,4.7272727272727275

2067264,4,B000286S2E,"This DVD contains all three Gidget theatrical releases.

Disc 1: **** GIDGET

Gidget confirmed Sandra Dee as a teen star but more importantly, it made James Darrin a star.  Arthur O'Connell and Mary La Roche plays the Lawrences.

Dee plays Francine Lawrence during the summer before her senior year of high school.  All her girlfriends want to land a guy but Francie doesn't really want to grow up.  They go down beach to find boys.  Of course, her friends completely strike out but Francie gets rescued by one of the surfers, Moondoggie (Darren).  But the surfers don't take her seriously and dub her Gidget (Girl Midget).

Gidget decides to fight fire with fire and becomes a surfer girl.  When Moondoggie comes to her rescue again, they both realize that their mad for each other.  But neither one wants to admit it.  So Gidget creates a scam to make Moondoggie jealous and it backfires.  Well, sort of backfires.  It ends in Francie being grounded by her father.

All summer long her father has been trying to set her up on a date with a friend's son Jeff.  It turns out that Jeff is Moondoggie!

Note: This is Full Screen from a Panavision 2.35 print.  There are only a couple of scenes where you lose some of the action.

Disc 2 Side 1: *** GIDGET GOES HAWAIIAN

It's two years later.  Gidget is now Deborah Walley in her feature film debut but James Darren is still Moondoggie.  Gidget's parents are now played by Carl Reiner and Jeff Donnell.

Jeff has pinned Francie.  Two days later Gidget's parents surprise her with a trip to Hawaii.  What a disaster.  Jeff sees this as a great opportunity for Gidget but Gidget only sees it as a separation from Moondoggie.

Gidget goes to Hawaii (look at the title) and meets another girl, Abby (Vicki Trickett) on the plane.  Also on the plane is dancer Eddie Horner (Michael Callan - who would become famous a for a short lived series Occasional Wife) and three boys going to the University of Hawaii, Wally, Larry and Judge (Joby Baker who played stinker in the first).  And Gidget's and Abby's parents (Peggy Cass and Eddie Foy, jr.)  meet on the plane.

When they arrive Gidget is determined not to have a good time but dad sends a telegram telling Jeff to get over.

Gidget finally gives in to Hawaii and decides to enjoy herself.  And as she is the star of the film, she gets Eddie.

Jeff arrives and Gidget is caught playing ""kiss in ocean"" with Eddie.  So you know that he winds up with Abby until Gidget and Moondoggie get back together.

This is definitely a sequel.  Nothing really happens during the film but it is fun.  Deborah Walley is good but she is no Sandra Dee.  She will find her fame on TV in The Mothers-in-Law.  James Darrin is great again.  He is the all American guy next door with massive sex appeal.

Disc 2 Side 2: GIDGET GOES TO ROME

Again two years have passed. This time Gidget is first timer Cindy Carol.  And James Darren is Moondoggie for the third time (My sister said ""Who cares who's Gidget as long as James Darren is Moondoggie).  Don Porter is Gidget's father this round and Jeff Donnell returns as Gidget's mother.  Also returning from Hawaii is Joby Baker as Judge.

The premise of this film is Gidget and her two best friends and Jeff and his two dorm mates, including Judge.  Cook up a scheme to go to Rome without their parents.

When they arrive the find out that Judge's Aunt Albertina forgot to make reservations.  Of course a few tips to the concierge fix everything.  This was filmed on location in Rome, so we get to see all the sights.

And we need the person to come between Francie and Jeff, the Italian guide.  But the girls are expecting a dishy boy when a voluptuous girl, Daniela, arrives.  Also, Gidget's father has asked an old Italian war buddy, Paulo Cellini (Cesare Danova), to watch over her.  He pretends to be a journalist doing a story on an American girl's first trip to Rome.

Jeff falls for Daniela and breaks-up with Francie.  Francie can't stand being around the two and goes off on her own at the museum and gets arrested for going into restricted areas.  Paulo comes to her rescue.  She falls for Paulo but doesn't know his secret.  In the end Jeff and Gidget get back together.

This is a piece of fluff and completes the movie collection.  The rest of the Gidget films were TV specials.

It's fun to see a time when young men wore suits and ties and young women wore dresses to go sight seeing!

This is definitely an innocent time.

This, as a whole, is a great innocent look at a 60's culture.  Pair these up with some Frankie and Annette films and you have complete look at a time.

It is a waste of money. But if you are buying it for a enjoyable movie, and don't know the real Gidget well, they are good. I really did enjoy them!",1101686400,2,852,4.467948717948718
2067270,3,B000286S2E,"These were 3 great movies that got horrible DVD release. I mean I bought the DVD set because it was better than nothing. But still Columbia House should have given these 3 glorious films the respect they rightfully deserved, I mean why couldn't they release it in Widescreen format. The first movie in the set gets a 1 disc release that isn't double sided. It is the best Gidget movie of them all. The 1959 Film Gidget which Sandra Dee, James Darren, and Arthur O'Connell. Which was the best ever. Than comes Gidget Goes Hawaiian. With Deborah Walley, Michael Callan, James Darren, and Carl Reiner. Then the last Gidget Film, Gidget Goes To Rome, which starred Cindy Carroll as Gidget, James Darren in his last role as Moondoggie, and Don Porter as Gidgets father, who played Gidgets father in the 60's TV Series Gidget which starred Sally Fields as Gidget. Which Gidget Goes To Rome, also stars the beautiful Jessie Royce Landis, as the funny guardian. The movies are great, but the set was ick.",1098316800,18,996,4.6971428571428575
2067271,2,B000286S2E,"I'm not used to seeing 'Gidget' in fullscreen.  Even when this movie plays on classic movie channels, it's played as intended - in Cinemascope widescreen - and rightfully so.  The first Gidget movie is beautifully shot.  Since these DVDs are all in fullscreen, we only get to see one-third of what is supposed to be onscreen.  Even though this gives the picture a grainy quality, the stretched-out one-third of the screen reveals scary details that I'd never seen in Cinemascope widescreen, like cellulite on various beach-goers (not naming names among Gidget's friends in the first beach scene of the first movie) and the heavy eyeliner on a certain leading man in the later two movies.  So I agree with other reviewers who believe that at the least, the first Gidget movie should be available in widescreen.  But the fullscreen format was not such a disappointment in the later two movies.  'Gidget Goes Hawaiian' has a B-quality plot.  It reminds me of those teen romance books I used to get at the book fair in middle school.  'Gidget Goes To Rome' was a small improvement, but still doesn't measure up to the first movie.  The worst thing about these two later movies is that Sandra Dee is in neither of them.  But it wouldn't have been believable when Jeff temporarily breaks up with Gidget in 'Gidget Goes To Rome.'  Breaking up with the bland Cindy Carol as Gidget is believable.  Breaking up with Sandra Dee as Gidget is not believable.",1092441600,14,1445,4.755020080321285
2067272,1,B000286S2E,"""Gidget"" (the original, the one I ordered the set for) should be in WideScreen, not FullScreen. It's a sad, sad day in a movie lover's world when my AMC taped copy is better than the DVD I shelled out $25+ for.

I was so excited when it came in, only to be disappointed after the opening credits rolled. Thanks God my Sandra Dee/Bobby Darin collection came in the mail the same time as ""Gidget"".

What a disappointment! Execs at Universal should be forced to write letters of apology (personal, not form letters) to us who rushed out and bought the collection. And then replace our DVDs with the WideScreen. Made an already bad Saturday that much worse...

If they all were only 1.66 it would not have been so bad.  I am certainly waiting till it comes out in wide screen, and hope it does, but will hang on to my video's in the meantime.

2067276,1,B000286S2E,"Hey, what's going on Columbia? The age of pan and scan VHS is over! The first ""Gidget"" movie cries out for the original CinemaScope aspect ratio, and the two follow-ups should be in standard ""widescreen"" format. Releases like this one are a giant step in the wrong direction for the DVD industry. 99% of potential consumers for movies like these want to see them in correct versions on DVD. I doubt that teenagers today would find Gidget & Co. amusing or even worth ten seconds of their time. But for us who were teens around 1960, films like these are great time travels loaded with nostalgia. (And by the way - who says that today's kids are allergic to widescreen? I don't think they're as stupid as some video companies seem to think.) So why bother to pan & scan? I'm sure Columbia will lose many, many more customers this way than by doing a decent and correct job aimed at film buffs and smart people.

 These movies were made in the late 50's, early 60's....so there is NO EXCUSE for issuing them in this format. They were shot in 2.35:1 ratio....so almost HALF THE PICTURE IS MISSING!!!

 This is the second time Columbia Tristar has deeply disappointed me on films I wanted in DVD. The first was their butchering of ""Where Angels Go Trouble Follows"" and ""The Trouble With Angels"".

 Alas, they will remain missing from my film library until they are released in their proper ratio!!",1091577600,322,588,4.715686274509804

Shame on Columbia/Tristar for not doing this the right way. Shame on them!

This will never be bought by me unless they release a widesceen version like they should've in the first place.

You would think that the studios would learn thier lesson from the fullscreen only Willy Wonka fiasco.

If you must put Pan and Scan on DVD, make sure the widescreen version is also available (preferably on a seperate release).
