4395910,3,B004K8X12M,"I've got nothing against Yogi Bear, but it makes more sense for ""Here Comes Peter Cottontail"" to be in this set, as it would give the customer the complete Rankin/Bass set of Easter specials.  Maybe Warner Home Video doesn't have distribution rights to ""Here Comes Peter Cottontail"", Who knows?  Anyway, this most likely will only annoy die hard Rankin/Bass fans.",1365033600,7,363,5.033333333333333
4395911,5,B004K8X12M,"With the Easter season upon us, I was looking for the enjoyable Easter cartoons that I watched in my youth, I was fortunate to come upon this Great 3 DVD set of Easter Movies that was absolutely perfect for my God-son. His favorite was the Easter Bunny is coming to town and made me laugh when he said, "" The show was good, but they didn't sing, "" Here comes Peter cotton tail hoping down the Bunny trail, hippitity hoppity all the way home!"" I don't know if the words are right? But it was very cute! I think the 3 DVD's Packaged in this set are Great for Easter Family Fun. I recommend this for the young ones and I believe it's a Great deal for the 3 shows in one DVD Package.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Easter-3-Pack-Fun/dp/B004K8X12M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Easter 3-Pack Fun</a>",1303084800,6,829,4.971223021582734

4395916,5,B004K8X12M,"If you're wondering why Here Comes Peter Cottontail isn't in this already-amazing set, and Yogi the Easter Bear is in its place, the WB still doesn't own Peter Cottontail; rather ClassicMedia and DreamWorks do, along with its feature-length CGI sequel from 2006, which are now both on 1 DVD from ClassicMedia. You ever hear of the Vince Guaraldi Trio? Rankin/Bass has its own Easter Bunny Trio; Peter Cottontail of April Valley (played by Shaggy himself, Casey Kasem; and in the CGI sequel, SpongeBob himself, Tom Kenny), Stuffy/GB of Easter Valley at the North Pole (played by Robert Morse, who went on to play Scrooge's younger self in The Stingiest Man in Town, and Jack Frost in his own stop-motion special; and his older self by Sam the snowman himself, Burl Ives), and Sunny of Kidville AND Town (played by Skip Hinnant, a true one-of-a-kind classic movie lover). As they say, 2 out of 3 ain't bad, and all 3 Easter classics are made from the same company who made a total of 20 beloved Christmas classics, mostly in their legendary stop-motion Animagic style! In fact, The Easter Bunny is Comin' to Town is a semi-sequel to Santa Claus is Comin' to Town, right down to Fred Astaire playing the narrator, Special Delivery Kluger himself; as Burl Ives as GB did The First Easter Rabbit, Danny Kaye with Mr. Sassafras with Peter Cottontail, and the unseen narrator Gregg Berger from Yogi the Easter Bear. This set is a 3-in-1 reissue of the original 2005, '08 and 2010 DVDs of Yogi the Easter Bear, The Easter Bunny is Comin' to Town, and The First Easter Rabbit. Hanna-Barbera had only 3 Easter classics of its own, as far as I know; the Tom and Jerry short Happy Go Ducky from 1958, the final episode of The Greatest Adventure series, The Easter Story from 1989, and Yogi the Easter Bear from 1994, one of H-B legend Don Messick's last great achievements before his passing in 1997. Yogi The Easter Bear came from Hanna-Barbera's Wild and Crazy Days, as some folks agree upon calling it, where Yogi and Boo-Boo try to save Yogi from being in the Siberian Circus, after he ate virtually all the candy for the Jellystone Easter Jamboree, by saving the real Easter Bunny from a couple of plastic-crazy(-and-slow) goons named Pauley and Ernest, all in an effort to save the Jamboree from being a total bust, in front of the Supreme Commissioner's own eyes! If you enjoy Rankin/Bass AND Hanna-Barbera classics in general, in any decade, you won't be sorry with this one-of-a-kind Easter collection! Happy Easter, everybody!",1427846400,2,2524,4.778032036613272
