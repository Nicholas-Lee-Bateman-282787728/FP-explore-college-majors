3659049,1,B001JP6388,Ummm no....unless you buy into all this silliness... love Sedona.... just not a believer in metaphysics and such.,1419120000,,113,5.333333333333333
3659050,5,B001JP6388,"Well knit together storyline and script that included both a deep and broad, historic and current view into an all to near to my Heart Sedona, Arizona.  As for me I soon will be moving back to stay, for close approaches that Day!",1396137600,,229,4.325581395348837
3659051,4,B001JP6388,"If you like Sedona and want to learn more about it this is a good DVD.  Has spaces for commercials so was broadcast at some point.  There are no answers offered at the conclusion or opinions of the host, the DVD just ends.  Basically if you are in Sedona on a vacation, much of this same information is given during local tours you can take.",1308873600,,341,4.2153846153846155
8313303,1,B001JP6388,I was looking for a documentary but found ridiculous information.,1469664000,,65,5.6
8313304,4,B001JP6388,"I've been to Sedona so I know how great it is all the ""aura"" that's around it, and it a super place to take your woman (or significant other) and have a blast. Just make sure that you take a PINK JEEP tour so you can see everything up close like I (we) did! The only reason that I only gave 5 Stars is because this film SPOKE about many area attractions but didn't show them in pictures. The Church that's built into the rock is SUPER wonderful to see as is many local restaurants that face the Red Rocks around dinner time. Super special place to go and go and go...",1466726400,,567,4.071428571428571
8313305,4,B001JP6388,I liked it very much.  Beautiful photography of the area.  Some of the Native American ideas were spoken of.  I' m not sure about the New Age amd what they are thinking.,1465948800,,169,4.21875

8313310,3,B001JP6388,Great scenery!,1464393600,,14,6.5
8313311,3,B001JP6388,"I just visited this lovely place a few weeks ago.  While the film does capture the beauty of the place, it is just too abstract/metaphysical for my liking.  Since this film is my first Karma Trekker view, perhaps they are all this way.  I'm just not the hippie type enough to appreciate the way they presented it.  I will say though that Sedona is one of the most beautiful places I have ever visited.",1463443200,,401,4.378378378378378
