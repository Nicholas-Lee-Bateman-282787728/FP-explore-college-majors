8744376,4,B0197ZVUWU,"I watched this show after the superb ""Gran Hotel"". This is the second spanish language series I've watched and again I was impressed by the production quality, the setting and scenes are beautiful, the acting of the entire cast is excellent. Although the love story of Ana and Alberto was not entirely convincing for me in Season 1 the stages their relationship goes through is very very interesting. All the other actors have good storylines too. I loved the velvet girls scenes and Clara and Mateo's story was just as fun to watch and a good contrast to the intensity of Alberto's character. I did not really like the turn the story took in the latter episodes. Carlos turned out to be way worse than Christina's character who I think is not a bad person per se but turned negative due to the awful people around her. Her dad is definitely the one who ruined her life and he was not even cast in the show that much this season. I loved to see amaia as barbara...such a good actress and",1478044800,,987,4.458563535911602

8744379,5,B0197ZVUWU,This novela will transport you to a time which many of us were not alive to live. The scenes are so realistic that you'll feel that you are living in this decade. The love story will captivate your heart and not let you stop watching. The actors are superb and really live up to the character that they are portraying. You won't regret watching this classic which has won many awards for letting so many fall in love over and over.,1470614400,,431,4.333333333333333

8744381,5,B0197ZVUWU,"Best series of any show I have watched.  I also like the fact too that the setting revolves around a team of seamstresses in a department store.  Even though it is spoken all in spanish and you have to read the english subtitles, it doesn't change my ratings at all.  Plus the music is great, all in english.  I wish they had the soundtrack available to purchase from all 3 series.  This is a really good series so don't pass it up because of the subtitles.",1468454400,3,457,4.267441860465116
