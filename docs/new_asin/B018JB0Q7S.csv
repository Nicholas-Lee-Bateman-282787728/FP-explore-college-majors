7553476,5,B018JB0Q7S,"Ninja Busters is an almost universally entertaining experience with mostly intentional (and some unintentional) comedy as well as plenty of action to keep the pace moving.  Had it been released, it likely would have earned a PG rating as it is mostly family friendly, so you can watch it around the pre-teens and not fear embarrassment.  The story mostly centers around two guys who fail miserably in their attempts to impress women, even when they pretend to have taught Bruce Lee his moves.  Will they win the affections of their latest targets when they actually learn the martial arts?  That I won't spoil for you here, but as you'll see from the title, they do get to battle ninjas in the process.

A previously lost/unreleased film, this Blu-Ray was created from a pristine original 35mm print, and the presentation couldn't be much better. This limited release was also made with a lot of heart, featuring a great transfer, killer sound and informative extras.  Grab it while you can!",1450656000,4,991,4.869047619047619
8742532,5,B018JB0Q7S,"I was thinking the other day, with all these super big blockbuster movies like Star Wars or the James Bond series, what ever happened to good old campy fun movies? What ever happened to those movies that are funny where they are supposed to be and funny where they perhaps are not supposed to be but that is ok that they are. Where are those movies that have you smiling and shaking your head asking, ""Did they just... ?Yes, yes they did!""
Here is that movie. NINJA BUSTERS is that movie you really do need to see. Not just because it is a fun 'escape movie', you know where you can just sit back and escape and enjoy it without some big heavy plot twists and story lines but also because of its backstory, This film was almost lost to the world for good but through some miracle it was discovered in a old musty vault along side a bunch of other films that sadly did not survive time and the elements. NINJA BUSTERS did survive though. Lucky for us it did!",1483142400,,957,4.263736263736264
8742533,3,B018JB0Q7S,An ok cheesy 80s ninja movie but nothing spectacular. This is one of those Troll 2 style movies where you are in it for the laughs as it has a very hilarious dialogue and super cheesy fights. Nice that it was released but don't go in expecting Sho Kosugi style sequences this is strictly for the laughs.,1462320000,,303,4.333333333333333

8742537,5,B018JB0Q7S,"As much as I like the big hair and music of the 80's, I forgot what a rough world it was back then, what with ninjas sometimes showing up unexpectedly.

The story of this movie finally seeing the light of day is very interesting, and I'm glad Ninja Busters was recovered. This blu-ray looks and sounds great. This buddy film is a lot of fun, like when the karate instructor sends two new students out to run five miles. Instead they go for a pizza, come back with pizza sauce all around their mouths and are disciplined.

A lot of the scenes are long takes and are done very well. The fighting is well-choreographed and looks really good. Sid Campbell and Eric Lee are great as the guys who decide to take up karate so they can date the girls in the class. The dojo where this was filmed is actually Sid Campbell's karate school. It's great seeing Sid and Eric goofing around when you know they are actually accomplished martial artists.

This movie was directed by Paul Kyriazi, who directed several other movies worth checking out:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Omega-Cop-Slim-Case/dp/B001E5QMWU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Omega Cop [Slim Case</a>],&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Weapons-of-Death/dp/B00HEU1OAE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Weapons of Death</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Death-Machines-1976/dp/B000W928AO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Death Machines (1976)</a>.

8742538,5,B018JB0Q7S,"Garagehouse Pictures' first release is excellent.  Many labels brag about rescuing films from obscurity, but NINJA BUSTERS was literally rescued from oblivion - read the liner notes!
Cult movie fans should be grateful.  NINJA BUSTERS is a blast.  It's one of those rare films where the enthusiasm and fun that the cast and crew put into it really pops off the screen.  It's a winning film and its charms are infectious.
NINJA BUSTERS is sure to become a cult classic and this Garagehouse Pictures release a collector's item.  Cult movie fans take note.",1451260800,3,552,4.89247311827957
8742539,5,B018JB0Q7S,"I was fortunate enough to see NINJA BUSTERS at a movie marathon in 2015, and it quickly became one of my favorite cult films of all time. NINJA BUSTERS is goofy fun, but more importantly, it's a great example of outsider art: the stars of the film are mostly non-professional actors; a group of martial artists got together to write, produce, score, and star in their own movie, and somehow it all works. The movie is funny (sometimes accidentally, sometimes intentionally), entertaining, and totally bizarre. If you're a fan of kung fu wackiness in the vein of NO RETREAT, NO SURRENDER and MIAMI CONNECTION, then you should definitely give NINJA BUSTERS a chance!",1451174400,3,664,4.884955752212389

8742541,5,B018JB0Q7S,"One of our heroes avoids a ninja's attack by doing ""the worm."" This long lost movie is perfect for anybody into cult movies or 80s camp. There are lots of fights, lots of ninja's, lots of bikers, lots of different styles of martial arts, and lots of high jinks.

You can tell this release was made with a lot of love. There are a bunch of extras including commentary and even the director's first feature. The picture is unbelievably good for a film this old, let alone one that was rotting away in a warehouse somewhere.

My advice is buy it, invite some friends over, and have fun with this one.",1451088000,3,597,4.36936936936937
