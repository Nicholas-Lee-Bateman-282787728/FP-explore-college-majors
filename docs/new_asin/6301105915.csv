308779,5,6301105915,"The world John Lecarr describes is without mercy and forgiveness.  The films based on his books are not nearly as terrifying, though they are frightening enough.  THE SPY WHO CAME IN FROM THE COLD is an early adaptation of one of  Lecarr's books by the same name, and in it he introduces albeit briefly, the character George Smiley.
The three main characters in this production Alex (Richard Burton), Nan (Claire Bloom) and Monque (Oskar Werner) were all very fine actors in the 1950s and 1960s.  This film was one of the last Burton made (965) and in it he plays a ""burnt-out"" spy who has been the operations officer in Berlin for 15 years of the Cold War.  Alex was recruited by British Intelligence shortly after WWII just as the East Bloc began to descend behind the ""Iron Curtain"" according to Western leaders like Churchill. The CIA was also spun from military intelligence during this period, and there is a brief interaction between Alex and a CIA officer at the beginning of the movie as Alex awaits a defecting East German spy at the infamous ""Checkpoint Charlie"".
SPY is shot in Black and White which enhances the spooky subject.  Night time scenes with flashing lights and rainy London weather add to the atmosphere.  I first saw this film in the theater, and I was so young I could not figure out what was going on.  The plot is complex, but not as complex as that of later adaptations such as SOLDIER, SAILOR...,or SMILEY'S PEOPLE which were given ample air time for the unraveling. It is a frightening film, and some one my age might wonder why anyone would ever become a spy.",1090108800,20,1591,4.617021276595745

308781,5,6301105915,"Ritt's masterpiece is a movie about British agent Alec Leamas who gets called back from the field when too many of the double agents under his care are killed by the East Germans. Leamas is directed by British intelligence to appear as an agent who is slipping into alcoholic decadence. He assaults an innocent grocer and is sent to prison. After his release he is recruited by the Soviets.
Before going to prison Leamas meets an attractive girl who is a British communist. She becomes the only person he really cares for while his work as a spy forces him to become increasingly cynical.
As often pointed out the film lacks the gadgetry and magic of other spy movies from its era. Instead the emphasis is on reality and negative human emotions such as despair, self-loathing, greed and fear. The plot becomes quite intricate especially after Leamas returns to the field posing as a paid defector.
The cast is superb. Richard Burton stars as Alec Leamas. Clair Bloom is his girl friend Nan Perry and Oskar Werner excells as a crafty communist agent.
The film received Oscar nominations in 1965 for Best Actor (Richard Burton) and B&W Art Direction. Martin Ritt directed many other good movies in his career including THE MOLLY MAGUIRES.",1059523200,12,1236,4.807511737089202

308783,5,6301105915,"Richard Burton's brooding performance coupled with appropriately grim black and white photography from cameraman Oswald Morris provide just the proper mood as the masterpiece thriller from former British intelligence operative John Le Carre was brought to the screen in 1965 with capable fidelity.
While a British production, the film's director was American Martin Ritt, an accomplished master of providing films of compelling seriousness with a touch of the grim, as exemplified by ""No Down Payment"", ""Hud"" and ""The Front.""  Burton plays an intelligence operative gone to seed, hence the reference to ""coming out of the cold"" which, in spy talk, involves being taken out of the field of operation.  Burton goes to planned seed, becoming an alcoholic who ultimately is thrown into prison for pummeling a thoroughly decent London grocer who had extended him credit and ultimately had to draw the line, incurring Burton's well orchestrated rage in accordance with plans from MI5.
As soon as Burton leaves prison Michael Hordern is waiting for him.  They discuss ""doing articles,"" a cover for what is really expected, turning allegiance and going to work for the Soviets.  During this period Burton is provided with a job at a small library featuring psychic works.  It is here that he meets Claire Bloom, an ideologue who attends local Communist study groups as a way of making a difference in a troubled world.
Burton operates in a realm of barely contained rage.  He inveighs Hordern with scorn and is not about to disagree with Oskar Werner when the East Germany Communist ideologue refers to Burton and his ilk as ""the lowest currency of the Cold War.""
Burton's contempt for his role in a grimy affair is enhanced by the fact that he has been sent to East Germany to clear Peter Van Eyck of charges that he is a double agent working for Britain.  Werner has shrewdly pegged him, and British intelligence does all it can to help a ruthless individual it took charge of after he murdered a man on a trip to England during an East German traveling trade exhibit.  Eventually Bloom surfaces as a prop to assist the contemptible Van Eyck.
More twists and turns occur until ultimately Burton wonders just what the future holds for him, and whether Bloom, the only person he cares for in life, will be part of it.  Circumstances ultimately answer important questions for Burton as he is propelled through a swirl of events masterminded by wily intelligence operatives to his ultimate destiny.
This is a spectacularly moody giant of a film.  Guy Troper and Paul Rehn fashioned a brilliant script which meshes with Le Carre's chilling suspense masterpiece.  ""Spy"" was a deserving recipient of a Best Film British Academy Award.  It bristles with controlled rage and sizzling wit delivered with the proper measure of acid by Burton in one of his enduring roles.",1019433600,64,2854,4.960167714884696
308784,5,6301105915,"A superb and accurate representation of the Le Carre novel. A very sombre and clever story that embraces the darkness of the cold war years. Low-key, believebale performances from all - superb casting. A true classic! And don't worry that the film is in black and white. It adds to the atmosphere of the story. Be warned, this film needs to be watched closely but the atmosphere will get a hold on you.",986428800,5,402,4.52054794520548
308785,5,6301105915,"Inside a grim little room in the empty countryside somewhere east of the Berlin wall an East German agent is interrogating a defecting British spy.  The defector is anxious and weary. He wants his money now. Prompting the  Communist agent to say this : ""You are a traitor, the lowest currency  of the cold war. We buy you, we sell you, we lose you, we can even shoot  you. Not a bird in the trees would stir if we did just that.""
  Except that Alec Leamas(Richard Burton) is not really a defector, he is  only masquerading as one. On his last assignment for the British Secert  Service, he is to pretend to be burnt out and jobless. Never faraway from a  bottle he walks around the streets of London cynical and depressed, his  ""masterstroke"" in this act is an ugly fight with a shopkeeper who  refuses to give him credit. This ofcourse attracts the attention of the  East German agants who view him as a potential defector because of his dire  need for cash and his embitterment towards the British Agency for  abandoning him. It is a credit to Burton's brilliant and painfully  realistic performance that you are pretty sure  his embitterment in not  entirely an act. That he really is a drunk. That he wholeheartedly agrees  with the German when he calls him ""the lowest currency of the cold  war"", even if he is not a defector. To him, all spies, on both sides,  are scum.
  John Le Carre was an ex-British intelligence officer when he  wrote the celebrated novel on which this film was based. It was called  ""the finest spy story ever written"" by the writer of The Third  Man, Graham Greene. And in a sense, The Spy Who Came In From The Cold  starts where The Third Man left off. The lead character has already lost  any faith he had in humanity. I suspect that the only reason Leamas hadn't  really defected is because even money has lost its lure. Surprisingly the  most sympathetic characters in the book(and the film) are the communist spy  Fiedler(Oskar Werner) and naive communist librarian Liz Gold(renamed Nan  Perry in the film and played by Claire Bloom), and both pay dearly for it.  In the world of The Spy Who Came In From The Cold idealism is not merely  misguided, it is pathetic. When Fiedler sincerely asks Leamus ""How do  you sleep at night without a philosophy?"". Leamus's typically jaded  answer is ""I don't believe in God or Karl Marx. I don't believe in  anything that rocks the world. I reserve the right to remain  ignorant.""
  In adapting the novel, scripters Paul Dehn and Guy  Trosper retained the icy restraint of the novel. Director Martin Ritt(who  made the better known but inferior Norma Rae) shoots the film in a harsh  black and white. Accompanied by a sad violin score, The Spy Who Came In  From The Cold is finally a sentimental film about unsentimentality.  Ridiculously Burton lost out on the Oscar infavour of Lee Marvin in the  frankly ridiculous Cat Ballou. The film was nominated for just one other  Oscar which was for Art-Direction. A shame. With its moral and asthetic  complexity, this is as far away from Bond or Tom Clancy based thrillers as  you can get. Possibly the greatest film in its genre, and in its own quiet  way the equal of The Third Man. The final message being that people who are  driven enough to enter the world of espionage are not(and can't afford to  be) driven by ideals. In that world the only motive is expediency.",967248000,272,3390,4.575959933222037

I watched this film again after reading John Le Carre's latest book, 'Legacy of Spies'. This book tells the tale of the death of Alec Leamas and the British deception Operation of MI-6, and the group known as The Circus. I needed to review the events of that operation as told in this book,  'The Spy Who Came In From The Cold'. George Smiley plays a  large part in this book and film. Mention Smiley's name and ears perk up.

Richard Burton plays Alec Leamas in this film. One of his best roles in film. His expressions give us the entire truth. Claire Bloom at thirty four, plays a teenager,which never made sense to me. She is not naive enough, one of the greatest errors in this film. Other than that the scene where Munda hits Leamas is not violent enough. Mundt  beat Leamas senseless in the book, this was a hit to the head with a gun.  But, we quibble. The best and the brightest in this film.

The trial scene was unspeakably brilliant -- it was like watching a chess match between Karpov and Kasparov in terms that we mortals can understand.  I have to wonder, did Burton actually get drunk to play his 'bitter drunk' scenes?  Drunk or not, he was masterful.  Fiedler was so extremely cunning, I don't think any other actor than Burton could have convinced us that Alec could deceive him.  But how did Control know Alec and the simple-minded Communist girl would fall in love?

The black and white cinematography did not seem to me to reflect any drama or mystery or suspense, it seemed very flat.

308891,3,6301105915,"Review of The Spy Who Came in from the Cold
Hot Toasty Rag, July 21, 2017

The Spy Who Came in from the Cold has been heralded as the best Cold War spy movie. I often find those movies confusing, so forgive me if my plot teaser seems a little muddled. Then again, the movie is supposed to be a little confusing, so I don't feel that bad.

Richard Burton is a British agent during the Cold War whos sent to East Germany. Hes supposed to pretend hes been disgraced and is defecting, but thats just a ruse in order to infiltrate the bad guys and gain information. I was confused just by that, and that was only the beginning! The rest of the film has twists and turns, complications, characters you're not sure if you can trust, facts that might turn out to be lies, and above all, a depressingly bleak black-and-white ambiance.

This is definitely a mans movie, or for girls who don't confuse easily and actually like spy movies. This isn't like a James Bond movie; theres no cheesy humor and no bikini clad babes. This is an understated drama, and when Burton isn't talking, hes silently seething like a bomb liable to explode at any moment. Its pretty intense.",1500595200,,1160,4.436619718309859

The spy is at war with both himself and his Cold War antagonist.  He sees a world in which his actions and perhaps those of his chosen profession mean so very in the long drama called life.  He sees his loveless present as a very bleak reflection of his all too certain future and he despises it and himself.  He sees espionage as one big continuous chess game that constantly gets played over and over agin with there being only temporary victors and losers and with everyone involved in the spy profession as merely being chess pieces that are lost or victorious in this endless game.  The ending is sheer genuis and coldly true, the spy faces down both his life's values against the last chess move and in the end he choses the only real choice that he has left, the hopleless redemption of his morality and dignity.",1499644800,,975,4.394444444444445

It is in black and white, apparently to highlight the nature of the film, its acts being performed in a clandestine dark manner. Burton plays a man who seems to be fed up with being a spy during the Cold War in split Germany. The film shows that both the Russians and the CIA are not acting as some would think they should act. The leaders of both groups lie, and they hide essential information from their own spies, even significant information related to the operation in which they are involved.

308958,4,6301105915,"A flawed but watchable movie made from a flawed but readable novel.

Perhaps the most outrageous flaw is Leamas' claim to the tribunal that he was ""too drunk"" to remember where he went after his lunch with Ashe. No agent would be too drunk to remember every detail of what he has seen and done.

Another flaw is Leamas' sneering cynicism toward his captors, as though he was above them all. The fact is that with every moment he is being ensnared in their plans, and his own freedom is quickly ebbing away.

To someone who knows the book this movie seems drastically truncated, especially at the end. But the book itself is full of superfluous detail, especially in Leamas' early relation with Liz, so I think the screenplay by Paul  Dehn is about as good as you can get.

One nagging question for anyone who knows the story: could Mundt have so precise a knowledge of Leamas' movements after the lunch with Ashe without the connivance of the British? Leamas, a professional, would know how to lose a tail.  It doesn't ring true that Mundt's agents were able to keep up with Leamas.

But Le Carr's book is also full of flaws. The entire sequence of Leamas' illness and Liz taking care of him is very poorly written. Much of the ending is not well written.

What remains is a very interesting double-cross: Leamas is sent to destroy Mundt, and at every turn the British connive to sabotage his mission and save Mundt's skin. The cynicism of this structure is the strong point of both the book and the movie.",1470096000,,1506,4.531365313653136

309062,5,6301105915,"This is a superbly written spy story.  And although I'm definitely a James Bond fan, it's way more true to life than James Bond, and therefore in many ways more interesting.  I listened to this story on CD three times after I purchased it in a matter of a few weeks.  What I like so much about the way the story is written is the author's tactfulness -- the way he leaves a lot for the reader to think and figure out.  So the reader figures many things out just as the characters do -- over time, over the course of the story -- and in the meantime, the reader is likely, at least at certain points, to find he has been double-crossed just as those of the characters in the story have been.  At one minute you think one thing: later, you'll think another.  The prose is first class, too; the story and its style deserve more than five stars.  However, the movie really ought to be re-done.  The movie goes too fast, and in a few parts it doesn't follow the story line -- leaving this or that out, or including this or that which wasn't in the story.  As a result, the movie is almost impossible to follow and enjoy unless you've also read the book.  However, Richard Burton really does seem to be the right character to play this role -- it seems quite a nice choice.  Having listened to the book three times and watched the movie twice, I feel that this movie falls short of the book in more than just the usual way that movies fall short of the books that gave rise to them; in this respect, it's a disappointment.",1435363200,,1516,4.229166666666667

309088,5,6301105915,"If the character of James Bond were actually thrust into the fray of the true world of espionage, he would be dead inside of 5 minutes. As soon as he ordered his martini ""shaken, not stirred"" his existence would be eliminated completely from the record. The world of British intelligence headed by ""Control"" does not involve masculine leads skiing over snow-laden cliffs to evade faceless KGB agents by day and seducing beautiful princesses in lavish hotel-casinos by night. Spies are care-worn spent people whose lives are empty and hollow. They make friends with their enemies and ultimately betray them. And simultaneously, they are pawns of the political hierarchy who hire them to betray the friends they make. In short, they have no real friends on either side. And they are expendable.

This is the world of Alec Leamas which brims with loneliness, betrayal, lies, and deception. Leamas does not don a tuxedo and flirt with young women at bars. He does not sneak around millionaire mansions sporting an automatic weapon equipped with a silencer to take out incompetent henchmen. He does not commiserate with billionaire magnates at long dining tables. Leamas walks alone in alleyways, befriends strangers on park benches, and sits in cement prison cells. This is the life of the real spy--lonely, emotionless, and loveless--in short ""cold"".

Leamas, a hardened veteran in service to Control, requests yet another spy mission instead of being given a desk job. His task: to act as a disgruntled former operative who seeks to defect to communist East Germany in order to frame a rival operative on the other side. Leamas, played by Richard Burton in an absolutely stunning performance, is a man of few words. His expressions convey much of the loneliness yet steadfast resolve that is a must to be a convincing spy. In the course of his deceptions, Leamas is not too quick to give the communists the information they think they need. His withholding further whets their appetite for Leamas' counter-intelligence. Leamas is a seasoned spy and manipulator who knows how to persuade his enemies.

""The Spy Who Came in From the Cold"" may be the best theatrical film about espionage ever produced. As with typical Le Carr, the beginning setup is enigmatic with much that is unexplained. Not until the stunning ending do scenes from the beginning make sense. This is a tour de force production on every level. After seeing this movie, you may not only ponder the real price we pay to gather intelligence from the ""other side"" but you may also question who are ""the good guys"".

Burton plays a spy named Alec Leamas who finds his relationship with Nan Perry (Claire Bloom) a librarian who also happens to be a comminist putting his mission and life in jeopardy.

The Criterion Blu-ray (for which this review is written) features a marvelous looking high definition restoration. I'm not sure about whether this is a 2K or 4K transfer as the booklet enclosed doesn't indicate which but the mono soundtrack benefits from a 24 bit de clicked  presentation. Nevertheless, this is a step up from the previously released DVD and all the special features are imported over to this edition. The movie and special features are all on a single, dual layered Blu-ray Disc.

The special features include scene specific audio commentary by director of photography Oswald Morris. It might have been interesting to have the author involved Ina scene specific commentary. We do, however, get a documentary on the author from 2000 and an interview with le Carr (who's real name is David Cornwell).

Actor Richard a burton is represented by a 1967 episode of the TV  series ""Acting in the 60's"".

There's a vintage conversation featuring Martin Ritt conducted by film historian Patrick McGilligan.

It would have been nice to also have a featurette on writer Paul Dehn (who went on to write additional movies) and Guy Trosper.

The special features are rounded out by a gallery of set designs as well as a booklet with an essay by film critic Michael Sragow. A trailer is also included.

Superb cinematic story telling. The young Richard Burton expresses the depth and the human strain of having to act at the demands of patriotism against the demands of your own humanity. This is film noir in the service of international espionage. Being a field agent is not about the toys. A small tight cast tightly directed tells the story with great fidelity and respect for the novel. Expect exceptionally fine performances and difficult to answer questions.
??????????????????????????????

The reason why John Le Carre is not just a writer of pot boilers is that his plots are about the places where loyalty, love, patriotism and humanity come into collision. He routinely asks the reader to consider what the right decision should be when values come into conflict. His book, The Spy Who Came in from the Cold was written while he was inside of the British Intelligence service. The world was deeply involved with the Cold War and people were expected to take sides and make sacrifices. Sacrifices that might go against religious beliefs and destroy personal relationships.

The movie, The Spy Who Came in from the Cold is a worthy adaptation of the book. Against the common wisdom that the book is always better, I believe that both are better than good. What is missing from the book does not reduce the impact, emotional or intellectual of the movie.

Richard Burton is tired field agent Alec Leamas. Having little talent while in from the cold (field) he will be `volunteered' for a job that starts with him being dismissed in disgrace. This will begin a decline as cover for a job that will take him to the other side and not into open and welcoming arms. Along the way he will become involved with a near innocent; Claire Bloom as a polite British `pinko"", Nan Perry . Her role is as part of his cover and as his pipeline to ""Them"" is not accidental. She is mostly innocent in that she is not capable of grasping events as complex as those that bring her and Alec together. She is his tool but her betrayal is in keeping with national security needs.

What does decent guy Alec owe to the woman who is caught up by him and the needs of his mission? What/who can Secret Agent Alec sacrifice while protecting  national interests",1417651200,,2257,4.703797468354431

309245,5,6301105915,"Most films dealing with espionage are steeped in jingoism and rarely approach characterization with a natural style. The characters are mostly one dimensional super humans possessing abnormally well-developed strength or intelligence, depending on the film. Martin Ritts film is based on the John Le Carre novel by the same name. Le Carre was renowned for his brutally realistic look at the world of counter intelligence.

The Spy Who Came in from the Cold follows Alec Leamas (Richard Burton) a British counter intelligence officer who is sent to East Germany to frame a German spy. He is tasked with spreading false information about the German officer by appearing to confess during interrogation. The plot is fairly straight forward but this is not one that you can be distracted while watching. Put away your iPad and make sure the kid is in bed before you start this film.

For a film from 1965 I was surprised to see a communist and drunk atheist as our pseudo-sympathetic leads. While the characters may have felt like honest portraits in 1965 now they feel just a bit off. I never believed in the love story at the center of the film. What did she see in him? Why would she try to make out with him after he laughed at her political beliefs? Why would she show up to pick him up from jail after one date? Why did he go back to her after he knew she was being watched? If he cared about her safety why didn't he break up with her? Both actors give fine performances but the writing is just. weird. For a movie that attempts to be grounded in reality, the central romance of the picture is utterly false.

This film is at its best when dealing with the boys. Oddly enough the exposition scenes are some of the more interesting in the film. When the plot and characters are being propelled forward the filmmakers confidence is stepped up and the film begins to shine. The camera work on display here is nothing short of remarkable. Photographed in lush black and white with innovative transitions and fluid movement the camera is truly one of the stars of this film.

Parts of this film I really loved and other parts I really wanted to love but I was always on this films side. I never felt insulted or talked down to by the picture. The filmmakers never take the time to explain the Berlin wall or the Russian involvement in East Germany. The cold war is never distilled down to a digestible little speech for you.  A certain level of pre-existing knowledge is expected of the viewer. Its always nice to see a movie that was intended for adult audiences, something that is sadly lacking from the mulitiplexes these days.

Richard Burton was better as a theatre (stage) performer, although is much restrained here.  His voice is too powerful, and his movements are sudden and seem too artificial.  Oskar Werner is magnificent here and it is worth waiting until his appearance mid-way through the film.  Claire Bloom is fine, but gets upstaged by Burton in nearly every scene they share.  I hadn't watched this film for many years, and this time around it seemed very short.  This is probably because I compare the story to ""Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy"" series which is longer.",1410739200,,660,4.745614035087719
309247,4,6301105915,"The Spy Who Came In From the Cold, 1965 film

The sign warns about a change in the rule of a sector. A car leaves the Soviet Sector for the Allied Sector at night. They await a man. A man on a bicycle approaches, sirens sound, there is a cry of Halt then shots. Can they do anything about Mundt? Alec Leamas reports to Control. They lost another agent. Should Alec change jobs? He is told they do disagreeable things because they are on the defense. [A self-serving statement?] Alec is now unemployed and looks for work at a library. He files books and joins a co-worker for supper. Nan Perry tells him what she believes in. [Note the small business grocery store owner.] There is an argument over credit. Later Nan offers him a place to stay. Alec goes for a walk, a man talks to him about a job, and offers him Prisoner Aid. A writer wants to meet him.

Later Alec meets Mr. Smiley and reports. They are cooking up a plot to get Mundt and explain it. There is a meeting at a strip club; they talk, others look at the stage. Alec is offered a job to provide information, it can pay 15,000 (plus relocation). Alec is at an airport in Holland. He is driven to a house and begins to talk about his past as a banker for a government agency; he disbursed funds to unknown people. A newspaper reports him missing, he must leave at once. Alec meets Fiedler. [Note the status display.] Alec wants his money but he must tell more about what he knows. Alec ran all the agents in East Germany. Afterwards Alec will need friends. Nan Perry asks for a vacation and travels to Leipzig. Fiedler makes telephone calls from a pay phone for his investigation. Men from Berlin come to talk to Fiedler.

Alec meets Mundt and gets a new room. Take him upstairs. Alec is given whiskey. Who sent you? Did you go to Smileys house? Fiedler shows up with an arrest warrant for Mundt. There is a hearing, Fiedler begins with his facts. Alec testifies as to what he knows. Mundts lawyer speaks for him, it was a plot by the British. How did Alec pay for that taxi? I haven't got any friends says Alec. There is a surprise witness! She tells about her lease, an anonymous gift. Who was he? She answers. Then Alec speaks about the plan. Mundt is reinstated. The hearing is over! Alec is told of an escape route by a British agent! What bargain did you make with him? Alec tells Nancy. [Does she know too much?] They used us. Alec explains the operation. The boy tells them how to escape. Good Luck! Will the plan work? There are shots, and it ends.

There is a surprising and shocking ending! [I sort of expected it when one person was told too much about the operation.] Was this ending planned from the beginning? This may be why this movie is rarely shown on TV. [Did the shooting on 11/24/1963 inspire this ending?] We were warned about them doing disagreeable things. This movie is too slow moving at times, it is a thinking rather than an action movie, unlike those James Bond action movies that were more popular then. The actual story was the subject of the book Operation Splinter Factor. You can learn more about how British Intelligence operates in the book The Double Cross System by J. C. Masterman.

309269,5,6301105915,"This movie is so different from modern spy movies.  No one gets kicked in the face.  Buildings don't explode. No one hangs from wires. Any shooting that is done is chastely held to a few rifle shots at the beginning and end of the movie.

What we do get is a movie that was trying to deal with the issues of its age - what does it do to people who have to do bad things for the noble end of protecting their country or their ideology?

This is the 1966 Black and White classic starring Richard Burton as Alec Leemas, a spy who is past his prime but is asked to play one more role.  His mission is to undermine a particularly vicious former Nazi turned Communist East Germany spy master by judiciously feeding information to the man's True-Believer Communist lieutenant, played by Oskar Werner.

But this is John LeCarre's spy-world where there is no morality and trust means nothing in the face of the imperative of the moment.

As a student of history, I treasured seeing the Checkpoint Charlie and Berlin of 1965.  The black and white filming gave the movie a gritty, grim and morose quality. Burton hams it up a bit at the end when he preaches the gospel of Realpolitik to his Communist girlfriend.

To see those three movies in the order made is to see Burton's magnificent range using the signature characteristics of his oeuvre--despair filmed in black and white.  SPY's themes:  love is a casualty of war, and life without love is war.  Think Shakespeare's ROMEO AND JULIET and Orwell's 1984.  Burton and Claire Bloom share a tenderness in LOOK BACK and SPY that is the inverse of Burton and Taylor's combat in VIRGINIA WOOLF.  Callous and exploitive George Smiley in SPY becomes an admirable cynic when Alec Guinness portrays him later in TINKER TAILOR SOLDIER SPY and its spin-offs for the BBC.

More important than details, however, are the mood and tone of the film, which are perfect.  I watched this with my two sons, ages 19 and 21 (it wasn't the first time I had seen the film) and they both enjoyed it.  I think this was the first time I understood, or felt like I understood, absolutely everything.  Of course, it is disturbing seeing the man who later, in other books and films or TV shows, became the anti-hero's hero, George Smiley, explicitly involved in setting up an innocent.  Just a bit part, really, but I didn't know him before, when I first read this book and saw this film, the way I know him now.  Of course, it is supposed to be disturbing and senseless, yet logical within a certain warped reality.  The film shows how this warped logic can simultaneously break and rebuild the spirit of a recently principled and desperately tired, old cold warrior. This is a film that must be seen, as the book must be read.

His defection is staged but it goes sour as he is arrested and humiliated. He is actually used as a pawn to get  a double agent reinstated in Berlin. The camera work by Oswald Morris creates an impact on the film in black and white. The film is very well directed by Martin Ritt. Claire Bloom plays a British communist who loves Alec Leamus (Burton)during the undercover operation phase. The double crosses are so well plotted by Le Carre who also wrote the screenplay for the film.

I can only say that it had a well-crafted and literate script supported by an electrifying performance by Richard Burton as weary spy, Alec Leamas. The stark black and white photography and street scenes recalls for me such films as Melville's ""Bob le Flambeur"" adding a gritty feel and oppressive atmosphere.

Burton, playing spy Leamas, has perhaps never been better as he slumps his way from London to Berlin, seeming to carry the weight of the world on his shoulders, battered and beleagured by a life devoted to a cause he has long since stopped believing in, having any faith in.  The world he inhabits is pictured as tawdry and mean.  Leamas is one of the walking wounded, dispirited and disillusioned.  He has no use for capitalists or communists as ""It is the innocent who suffer"".  This portrait of the world of espionage is light years away from the flashy, gadget-ridden world of Bond.  The script, as the novel upon which it is based, is literate and absorbing, unflinching and uncompromising in its focus on the countless betrayals in the service of getting the upper hand in a game filled with losers who have lost their direction.

309435,5,6301105915,"In this taut, Oscar-nominated Cold War thriller from 1965, Richard Burton gives a superb performance as aging British spy Alex Leamas.  The lovely Claire Bloom plays Nan Perry, an innocent Communist idealist librarian who falls in love with Alex Leamas on his final assignment before retirement.

Martin Ritt directs this film with that film noir atmospherics.  He brings John le Carrs novel to life.  le Carr worked for British Intelligence and was stationed in Berlin where the film is set.

The story is complicated with twists and turns and a host of shadowy characters.  The spy business is not totally black and white. There are layers of complexities on both sides of the Iron Curtain.

With many subtle jabs the spy game is commented on.  It seems that the innocents, the pawns,  are the ones to pay the price.
In a tense conversation near the end of this brilliant film, Leamas says to Nan Perry, who is overwhelmed with what she had witnessed first-hand in East Germany and with her idealism shaken,

What the hell do you think spies are? Moral philosophers measuring everything they do against the word of God or Karl Marx? They're not! They're just a bunch of seedy, squalid bastards like me: little men, drunkards, , hen-pecked husbands, civil servants playing cowboys and Indians to brighten their rotten little lives. Do you think they sit like monks in a cell, balancing right against wrong?

The cast is outstanding, and Sol Kaplans music is craftily mastered. This 112-minute film would be worth your time if you are a fan of this genre.",1391299200,,1555,4.830188679245283

Director Martin Ritt holds court on how to properly unfold such a story whose plot is based on ""plans within plans"". This is a movie that needs to be payed attention to in order to be fully appreciated. But if you don't there are still rewards in taking in the dank, black & white, otherworldly images that weld themselves to your consciousness. This film works on several levels, with timeless themes that make the ride worthwhile. Tip: Watch Richard Burton closely. His manner. His facial expressions. He is a master actor whose every move informs. Don't assume he knows the whole story.

One thing that can be revealed without incurring spoilage is that we run into 'George Smiley' in this film. Wasn't Smiley a character animated by Alec Guinness in the popular spy film 'Tinker Taylor Soldier Spy' and the 'Smiley's People' series? Why yes... the novels all these teleplays were based on were written by John le Carr. George Smiley is the author's recurring MI6 spy.

309541,4,6301105915,"Plenty has been said in other places about the differences between le Carr's take on spy-craft and say, Ian Fleming's. That difference is clear here, with very little ""action"" taking place in the sense of car chases or gun fights. The main characters are not heroic, indeed as Alec Leamas (the title character) famously states: ""What the hell do you think spies are? Moral philosophers measuring everything they do against the word of God or Karl Marx? They're not! They're just a bunch of seedy, squalid bastards like me: little men, drunkards, queers, hen-pecked husbands, civil servants playing cowboys and Indians to brighten their rotten little lives."" Neither side seems to have the moral high ground, the aims are not always clear, and the only victory is a personal one. Pretty much the perspective you'd expect from a socialist fighting Communism in the Cold War.

The movie generally succeeds in telling a good story, one which will keep you guessing right to the end. However it isn't necessarily easy to follow, and requires close following to enjoy. If you get up to grab a beer and don't pause it, you'll be lost. So I can see why it was nominated but didn't win any Academy awards.

Since the Cold War has thawed, it now stands as an illustration of the era, as well as being a superbly crafted movie, with a bravura performance from Burton.

The film is driven by the story, and the finely drawn characters, rather than action- very different to popular spy dramas of the current era.

309549,5,6301105915,Le Carre's books are the ultimate look into the complexities of the human side of the spy game.  The Spy Who Came in from the Cold conveys that well.  Unfortunately today's spy movies are all about special effects and action packed shoot outs.,1381708800,,243,4.627906976744186
309600,5,6301105915,"How odd that this haunting movie so rarely shows up on ""best of"" lists. It is, first and foremost, a great spy yarn. Yet it's also more. Like few other films, it convincingly evokes the Cold War's deep undertones of suspicion and moral ambiguity. Oswald Morris' cinematography, which won multiple awards, paints the story in a dank, ominous Berlin. For decades the feared flashpoint for a World War III, the cold, rain-swept city becomes the film's visual center.

Above all, the acting is superb. Even in his ""serious"" films, Richard Burton was never more affecting than here, as alienated British agent Alec Leamus. Burton was deservedly nominated for an Oscar for this role; he should have won. Claire Bloom provides almost as gifted a performance in her parallel role as Nan Perry. Even the minor parts in the film are well-cast and well-performed, notably that of Fiedler, played by Oskar Werner.

Martin Ritt's confident direction immediately sets the dark tone, then maintains the movie's taut pace and suspense throughout. In sequences like an East German trial, he manages to impart both tension and a faintly humorous surrealistic undertow. Unexpected plot twists abound, all the way to the film's surprising finale. Surely this is one of the four or five greatest spy thrillers ever set to film.

Those who revel in the subtleties of film lighting and magnificent black and white photography, not to mention high-definition sound, should seek out the blu-ray edition of the film.

A final note. The Spy Who Came In From The Cold was not a cheerful novel, and this is not a cheerful movie. So don't expect a cheerful ending.

The nihilist culture of the cold war intelligence and espionage community is portrayed with sparklingly cold clarity. Of the multitude of cold war spy movies, and novels, this particular movie conveys the hopelessness (and hopefulness?) and desperation that was a part of that time.

309677,5,6301105915,"This movie would never ""fly"" in the 21th century.  There is no action and has a fadeout lovemaking preamble.  But the picture was revelatory and unthinkable in pre-Watergate days.  It must have been shocking in those days to hear somebody say they did not believe in God.  It must have been equally repulsive to hear Claire Bloom say she was a communist.  You have to be up on your post WW II history to get anything out of this film.  Then, there's the downward spiral you don't know you're in for until the last frame of the movie. The movie made me want to read the book in order to fill in the blanks. I also admire Richard Buron and love how he completely immerses himself in any role.  This is a very bleak film.  Yet, Mr. Burton delivers a simmering intensity.  Claire Bloom is  beautiful and touchingly compliments him.  I had to choose the, ""I love it"" category.  However, this picture doesn't fit that description.  It is a cerebral film.

*** I just read the book and just as I thought: Mundt beat the hell out of Leamus.  This was conveyed by the look on Burton's face after the frame showing his first ""meeting"" with Mundt.  That look also conveyed to me that Leamus had also been hogged tied--not nice and neat as Leamus was shown in the film with his hands hancuffed in front of him, his nice white shirt and tie still in place, without a speck of blood any place.  More gore should have been added to the next appearance of Fiedler, who also was ""interviewed"" by Mundt.  They needed Sam Peckinpah to direct this part of the movie.

I so loved the book that I was hesitant to see the movie once I found it.  The Bourne series butchered Ludlum's creation without needing to, and I just didn't want to see a Hollywood (or in this case, a British) hatchet job.

But, wow!  Burton is spot on as Leamus, and Oskar Werner delivers like he always does.  The Berlin Wall becomes totally real in this movie.  Anyone under 30 years old should see this just to get a grasp of the great divide that was east and west in the Cold War.

But best of all, this movie strips away the romanticism of the spy trade to yield a scary truth.  Even benevolent nations must resort to evil ways when faced with an evil opponent.  I'll leave the debate of that subject to viewers.

Richard Burton plays British agent Alec Leamas as a man inhabited by demons who keep him from giving up the whole spy enterprise, which seems more playing cynical mind games with an equally clever and demonic cold-war enemy than fighting any sort of good fight.  The harsh black and white camera work make Britain very nearly as cold and dismal a place as East Germany, inhabited by the implacably evil opposition.  Ironically, the only unquestionably ""good"" character is a lovely young British woman, an idealistic and dedicated Communist, who tries to salvage the wreck that is the Leamas she comes to love, though he seems to have hit rock bottom when she turns up. The man who is the British's ""friend"" in the East is played quite well by Oskar Werner, and the whole story pivots on his character, one of the few likable ones in the film.  When in the end the light of goodness breaks the spell under which Leamas's demons hold him, the way in from the cold is a sad but easy choice.",1368921600,,1196,4.579439252336448

309768,5,6301105915,"It's fascinating to put this film into its context - a black and white, grimy film peeling the lid off the unsavoury world of spycraft in the chill of the Cold War, with no gloss or even colour to leaven the mood.  And this at the same time that the world was on a high in the 60's on Connery's glossiest Bonds, as well as spy mania proliferating in tv and books, highlighting glamor, humor and color.  The highest rated TV series that year was Get Smart.  Here though, Le Carre's novel as put on film is more interested in damaged people and something more like the reality of spying.
Richard Burton gives an outstanding performance as Leamas, Burton playing the part of a man playing a part.  The spy who has just had a failure in Berlin, but who is not ready to come in from the cold.  His bosses ask him to stay in the field for one more undercover op, all in gritty but excellent black and white photography.  He does what he needs to do to seem `turnable', as part of a scheme his handler has explained will help get rid of one of the top German agents... his journey of false information dissemination becomes one of self discovery as he starts to question just who is being used.  His monologue near the end when he releases his true feelings about his profession makes you realize just how great an actor he could be, especially with this sort of deeply troubled and damaged character.  Oskar Werner is simply mesmerising as the contact whom Leamas intends to manipulate, and Claire Bloom has a pivotal role that is utterly believable thanks to a note perfect performance that speaks much more than her words do.
It's a simply told, unfussily shot gem full of nuances, with great performances and a compelling story.. not a moment is wasted, and each frame holds exactly what it needs to.  and then it has an ending that is sure to have you talking or thinking long after the credits fade.  It might not be uplifting, but it is nonetheless unmissable.

310023,5,6301105915,"I recently re-watched the brilliant film version of John Le Carr's The Spy Who Came in From the Cold. I hadn't seen this movie in many years, not since I was a kid watching it on broadcast T.V. (Yes, I am that old. Alas, I even remember test patterns). Although it had been decades, the movie's stark images and somber mood had always stayed with me, lurking just below the surface, ready to pop into my frontal lobes at any moment. The plot had long since faded from my memory - other than the vaguest recollections that it involved double agents, deceit and trickery - but its cinematic style had not. And I was pleased to now see that these powerful images were not just the result of viewing the film with a young, impressionable mind. They are real and they are that good, even to the mature eye.
The film is a striking contrast to the exciting and exotic world occupied by James Bond. In fact, their textures could not be more opposite. The movie was shot in black and white, even though by 1965 we were well into the age of color. That choice amplifies the harsh, dreary imagery: a London that is perpetually shrouded in driving rain; a Holland seascape that seems barren and desolate; and, of course, the scarred and dingy East Berlin and its infamous wall. Richard Burton's Alec Leamas is downbeat and bitter as only Richard Burton can be. It's as if his George from Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? were transported into the land of spies and along the way had most of the remaining life sucked out of him. There are no shaken martinis or bottles of Dom Perignon for him. Rather, his cover as a fallen agent requires him to pinch pennies that afford him only half bottles of whiskey. And his love interest, while pretty, is a quiet and misguided librarian. No glamorous Bond girls for you, Mr. Leamas.
One of the film's most satisfying aspects is the way both the plot and the imagery come full circle, beginning and ending at the Berlin wall. That bleak wall almost becomes character itself, coldly dispensing death at both ends of the story. Ultimately, this is a movie about small human lives, twisted and manipulated for cold war gains, bookended by death.
If you haven't seen The Spy Who Came in From the Cold, you should. It has earned its standing as a classic of the serious spy genre. You won't find any perfectly made martinis here, but you may find that you yourself are shaken and stirred.

Executed by Richard Burton, with help from Claire Bloom and Oskar Werner, this drama is set in the cold war era of the 1960s.

MI6 masterfully designs a plan to discredit a certain high ranking Soviet spy operative in a scheme of national betrayal.

310026,5,6301105915,"I bought the Criterion Collection DVD because I loved the movie and knew I would enjoy the 'behind the scenes' extras.  And it is worth buying this because the extras help make viewing the film again (and again) a new experience.

The cinematographer, Oswald Morris, gives a wonderful scene-by-scene commentary of the film.  After hearing how shots were set up and what the director had to put up with that day from a difficult (and usually drunk) Richard Burton, I was amazed this film got made.

But the performance Morris singled out in his commentary was that of the late-great, Oskar Werner as Fiedler, the East German agent.  This was the film that Werner chose to make after his romantic role as Dr. Schuman in Ship of Fools&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ship-of-Fools/dp/B003NVDUYG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ship of Fools</a>.  Werner specifically took this role as Fiedler so that he would not be become typecast as a romantic lead.  Next to his amazing performance as Jules in Jules and Jim&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jules-and-Jim-The-Criterion-Collection/dp/B0007989ZC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jules and Jim (The Criterion Collection)</a>, I think this is the best film acting Werner has done.  Where Burton over-acts in many scenes, Werner simply acts.  Every time Werner is onscreen, he steals the scene.

Another great actor, who is not mentioned in any review so far, is Cyril Cusack as Control.  Cusack was an Irish actor playing a pedantic British spymaster.  He, too, steals each scene away from Burton by simply acting and reacting.

Claire Bloom is excellent as the love interest, Nan.  Normally, Bloom plays cultured, privileged ladies (i.e., Anna Karenina) she manages to bring a credible note to the concept of a lonely, naive, working class idealist.

This is not to say that Burton isn't good in this role.  He is wonderful in the film.  However, his performance looks even better than it probably was because of the solidness of the actors supporting him.

The additional extras include a wonderful interview with John Le Carre about both the book and the making of the movie with wonderful tidbits about the various actors (for instance, he would have preferred to see the actress, Rita Tushingham play the part of Nan, but thought Claire Bloom was 'terribly good' and loved the fact that Cyril Connolly - 'a real Irishman who hated the British' really sunk his teeth into playing a pedantic)

These extras and the wonderful restored cinematography makes paying a bit extra for this movie well worth it.",1332720000,2,2627,5.441975308641975
310027,5,6301105915,"This is the best espionage film ever made.

Le Carre has been responsible for other excellent ones, but none of his, nor anyone else's, has the pithy power of this.

Soon after the construction of the Berlin Wall, Alec Leamas (Richard Burton) plays the part of a dissolute, jaded, ripe-for-turning spy, and is dutifully recruited by East German Intelligence.  He has been given information that will discredit Hans Dieter Mundt, the head of that organization.  What Leamas doesn't know is that the English woman with whom he has been intimate has unwittingly been involved in events that will discredit his brief.

He is debriefed by Fiedler (played brilliantly by Oskar Werner), who is Mundt's second in command, and is Jewish.  He is sophisticated, yet solicitous as to Leamas' comfort;  he is meticulous, yet allows Leamas latitude, and they form a bond.  Mundt, a sadistic former Nazi, breezes through the trial that could cost him his life.  Without giving away the whole story, suffice it to say that his sangfroid is well founded.

In the climactic scene, as the first screen incarnation of George Smiley waits on the Western side of the Berlin wall, Leamas finally does come in from the cold (the phrase, in actual usage, meant, 'to leave the field work of covert operations').  As they drove towards their departure from East Berlin, Leamas' lover, aghast, had asked a question, followed by, "" Fiedler was your friend! ""  Leamas replies with a great line in film history:  "" How big does a cause have to be until you kill your friends?  What about your party?  There's a few million souls down that road, too. ""

The theme of the state vs. the individual is central to most good films in this genre, and Le Carre expresses it best in Leamas' recollection:  driving, he had seen a station wagon full of kids bracketed by 'two great lorries (trucks)', with expected red consequence.

The book, which launched Le Carre's career, is quite short, and the film shares its forceful brevity.  The Cold War may be decades past, but this emotional examination of commitment and deceit remains resonant.

While Ian Fleming, too, was in the British Secret Service, this story has no car chases, no exploding potentates, no salacious pandering, no travelogue.  Unlike a Bond confection, this is a series of scenes in a series of dreary rooms and forbidding exteriors, piled one atop another, a Jenga Babel, until they, like one of Smiley's operations, are exquisitely unbearable.

The black and white medium seems especially appropriate for this mutual shading into greys.  If thought-provoking dialog and unblinking, spartan photography are your cup of tea, see this wonderful masterpiece that never seems to get cold.",1331424000,2,2715,4.957964601769912

Burton is full of smoldering looks that go on too long. Maybe that was the editing style of the day. This 1965 period piece seems much older than that, maybe mid-50s in tone and tempo.

There is a good chunk of the film that didn't deal with the story of Mundtz or the critical letters that told the motivation of the characters.

However, most of the critical pieces of the story was told in its entirety and I was pleased with the film I should of bought the Criterion Edition but just noticed it today while searching for it. I doubt I would of cared for the extras so this dvd was perfect.

A weary looking Richard Burton stars as the burned-out agent in this suspenseful and ultimately sad tale of an expendable life in a lost cause.

The film had a difficult history.  Burton resented director Martin Ritt who insisted Burton underplay his part.  Burton finally walked off the set and had to be cajoled out of his dressing room.

This excellent black and white adaptation of LeCarre's spy thriller, The Spy Who Came in from the Cold stands in sharp contrast to the glamorous portrayal of espionage presented in the James Bond universe by focusing on the drabness, uncertainty, and lack of honor that come with the territory; it drags a little bit in the first hour but if you're patient you'll find quite a film by the time 110 minutes are done.

310067,4,6301105915,"The Criterion Collection's latest release is the 1965 black and white spy classic, The Spy Who Came In From The Cold, directed by Martin Ritt, whose best known films include the Woody Allen Blacklist film, The Front, and the Sally Field union drama Norma Rae. Like those, this is a very well directed and taut film. And, like those later films, this one also misses out on greatness. For those expecting a James Bondian sort of thriller, forget it. This film is an espionage character study, loaded with monologues, dialogues, and philosophic introspection. As such, I can say that there really is not a single genuine action sequence in the film. A few people get shot and die- including the hero and heroine; but, by stating such, up front, I'm really not giving anything about the film away. Why? Because this is one of those films that depends upon the how of its action rather than the why.

It's an almost 2 hour long film (112 minutes), yet never drags. The cinematography is reminiscent, at times, of The Third Man, and other low budget, experimental Orson Welles films from the 1940s and 1950s; even though it was a high profile project based upon the bestselling novel of the same name by John Le Carre. The scoring is understated and precise, the acting by Richard Burton, as Alec Leamas, and Oskar Werner, as Fiedler, is superb, and the plot is twisted, but all makes sense in the end. I will not detail that, even though I have given away the deaths of two of the main characters, because the plot directly relates to a few of the superb exchange sin the film about the ethics of espionage.

And this is why the film is so good. It is the internal machinations, especially in the mind of Leamas, that make this film work. A lesser actor simply could not have sold the part as equivocally as Burton does: is he in the dark or not? Is he an agent on the way down (because of a failed operation) or merely playing one? The title of the film is usually thought to mean that Leamas has finally gained insight into the machinations of the Cold War, but it could also mean the man finally realizes his worth to his employers, the world, and himself. Or, more accurately, his lack of same. The cold that he hits is reality's nor'easter. And, despite his own reputation as a brilliant rou&eacute;, Burton proves he truly was a better actor. There are full scenes where the camera just resides its gaze on his mien, and the viewer is riveted. Then there are some bravura editing choices made by Ritt, where scenes end anywhere from a few seconds to a minute or more before they would in conventional Hollywood films. These elisions propel the film forward, narratively, because the audience knows what will occur, and also displays an unusual confidence in the intelligence of the film-goer.",1248825600,4,2794,4.608433734939759

Everybit of it from it's photography and overall feel of grayness and crushing unglamerous locations makes this movie a classic of the downbeat cynical spy genre.  It helps when you have Richard Burton in one of his all time best performances.  And every other cast member is at the top of their game and deliver such finely tuned performances that they meld into their characters. It brings back the cold war and the terrible sacrifices that were made to try to infiltrate the eastern block.  And no matter how rotten some of the things the west did they are pails  in comparison to the nightmare death states of the communist world.  But that doesn't make this story any less poignant. The criterian collection did a fantastic job on cleaning this movie it has removed the
lines and specs to leave a almost pristine picture. The movie is black and white and that's ok for it just adds to the whole depressing feeling of this movie.  And most people living in the eastern block of the 1960's were living in a oppressive and crushing society which matches the whole film as well.

I have seen this theme highlighted in subsequent films, including a recent one, ""The Good Shepherd"". I'm not saying that other films that have employed this theme are dominated by it, as with this film. Even the title of this film implies the theme. And when the lead character can no longer cope with his meaningless, reptilian existence, the system swallows him up for the sake of expedience as well.

My favorite spy thrillers that resemble this film are Day of the Jackal followed by Eye of the Needle. I easily can recommend this to Richard Burton fans as this probably will not disappoint. Fans of spy movies may or may not get into this one depending on taste. I was really disappointed because it was so blah to me.

First, there's a quite informative and candid interview with le Carre himself - in which he offers some revealing memories of the movie's casting, shooting, and on-set experiences as well as some criticisms of the final result. He is especially revealing about Martin Ritt, the director, an old lefty who was blacklisted during the '50s and who was perfect to handle this movie with its particularly curious selection of actors. There's also a good BBC interview with le Carre, from a few years back, which traces, with some depth, his boyhood, education, and career and shows how they have been captured and reflected in several of the movies made from his books. And there is a wonderful interview/voice-over by the cinematographer, explaining some of this film's best scenes and how they were conceived and shot. And more.

It shows the changes he goes thru and the how forces he can't see or control affect his life. I highly recommend this movie for someone who wants to experience the cold war instead of a lot of special effects and car crashes.",1194393600,,542,4.43
310133,5,6301105915,"As in all of LeCarre's works, there is a lot more shown than the machinations of Cold War espionage.  The human element is always there.  As much as the spies try to suppress their more human feelings in order to carry out their difficult missions, sooner or later they have to deal with them.  That's what I find fascinating, rather than the plot complications of the spy business.  Spy story fans will think differently.  Here you don't have to choose--you get both.

Richard Burton gives a superb performance as the burnt-out, cynical spy who has lost any reason to do anything but drink. He claims not to do what he did for idealistic reasons and has nothing but contempt for his trade.  He's offered a desk job in London after having been pulled in from active work in Berlin, but the safety of pushing papers doesn't appeal to him, either, so he takes it.  He needs money and really has nothing better to do.

In the process of building an identity as a disaffected British spy, ready to defect to the Communists, he stumbles into a job as an assistant clerk in a library.  There he meets an idealistic young woman (Claire Bloom) who believes that the Communist party is the answer to the world's problems--his polar opposite.  Even as he scorns her naivetee, he falls for her sweetness and caring and promises to return to her after this one last job.

Complications ensue, as they do in complex spy stories and the outcome is truly a memorable one.  The librarian's touching love for him has brought him out of his cynicism long enough to perform one truly heroic, human act.  She has brought him in from the cold.

Burton's presence is so commanding that he held my interest during the elaborate twists and turns of plot.  Bloom plays the idealistic young woman perfectly; it's a role one could easily over play but she carries it off with great subtlety.  Oskar Werner, no lightweight himself, brings addition spark when he enters the picture.  As impressive as Burton is, Werner hold his own with him in every scene; they are perfect sparring partners.

The black and white gritty photography, the bleakness of the scenes, the music, all add to the mood of the film, a reminder of a very grim and dangerous time in our history.  The emergence of human caring at the end bring  a spark of light to the darkness--that's the genius of LeCarre and that's what I'll carry with me from this film.",1191110400,3,2401,4.602352941176471
310134,5,6301105915,"I remember when this movie was first released, a friend saw it and afterward complained bitterly about how boring it was.  This was around 1965 and he was expecting something more along the lines of James Bond, Our Man Flint, Matt Helm or any of the other James Bond knockoffs going around back then.  But ""The Spy Who Came in from the Cold"" was totally different.  No flashy fantasy picture here; this is stark, cold reality showing cold war espionage the way it probably really was.

The movie is shot in black and white adding to the stark reality.  The musical score is very subtle and low-keyed and used sparingly as the tension builds, but still manages to set the desperate mood of the story.  The acting is superb; Richard Burton and Oskar Werner give outstanding performances.  The tribunal and escape scenes toward the end of the movie are some of the most powerful you'll ever see as the many facets of the mysterious Operation Rolling Stone finally come together.

I really appreciate understatement and compactness in film and this is a good example of that.  There are absolutely no wasted scenes or dialog, no throwaway gag lines and no laughs.  Every minute of this serious film is vital to the story line.  The audience must pay close attention.  It must have been quite a challenge for director Martin Ritt to film such a complicated story, but he and the screenwriters pulled it off

A blurb in my copy of the book by John LeCarre says this is one of the best spy stories ever written and I totally agree.  The screenplay is generally faithful to the book.  The dialog is taken almost verbatim from the book in many of the most powerful scenes, and the story itself is a masterpiece of convoluted intrigue.

Burton, in a masterful performance, portrays Leamas as a brooding, beleaguered soul who's thoroughly disgusted with his line of work, as well as the world's dueling ideologies. Excellent performances by Oskar Werner (as an East German spook) and Sam Wanamaker (as traitorous go-between Peters) add heft, while Claire Bloom brings pathos as Nan Perry, the leftie library assistant who sees beneath Leamus's alcoholic fog and world-weary veneer.

310187,5,6301105915,"John LeCarre debunks the James Bond glamour myth with it's bevy of beauties and clever gadgetry to give us the real portrait of espionage during the cold war years. Spies were nothing but underpaid civil servants and pawns in a chess match to see who wins the round--even if it is at the expense of the innocent. Much has already been written about this great movie adapted from an even greater novel, but little has been said about the machinations behind this movie.

Despite Burton's salary disputes, his jealous wife's presence on the set to keep her philandering hubby in tow (he had a brief affair some 20 years earlier with co-star Claire Bloom), wife Liz Taylor need not have worried. Burton was drunk so much of the time on the set, he had to rely on cue cards. Thanks to clever editing and careful shots by director Martin Ritt, Burton managed (under the circumstances) to pull of the almost incredible feat of being nominated for an Oscar in this gritty film, despite his condition. He plays a burnt out spy and looks it! Bloom (superb as always), plays Burton's lover who unwittingly becomes involved in this game and becomes an expendable pawn. Her performance is subtle and understated and highlights the film. Oskar Werner is also superior as the East German interrogator assigned to Burton who is pretending to defect to East Germany all for the sake of love and country that betrays him in the end.

The London scenes were shot in a dreary section of Dublin and adds to the bleak realism of the film.

This isn't always easy to watch, especially for those who love the clever 007 movies. Here is the reality. Get use to it.",1182211200,5,1640,4.628865979381444
310188,5,6301105915,"So much has already been said about this movie, so let me shed some light on this film which, for now 40 plus years on, so expertly defines the climate of the Cold War during the mid-60's. Interestingly, this is a film that improves upon multiple viewings.  And it is not hard to see why Burton was nominated for an Academy Award for this picture.

Depicting cold war espionage at its dirtiest and realistic best---first, note how Ritt uses black and white instead of color to personify the drab, ""grey"" existence of the protagonist, Alec Lemas, at time when color was the norm--and it is all the more better for it. Ritt captures the depressing environs of East and West Berlin, and the wet, dismal streets of downtown London.

It is of curious note that this was NOT a film where the director (Ritt) and star (Burton) got along famously--in fact, far from it. Ritt wanted to play Lemas as the anonymous and expendable cog caught up in the bureaucratic machine, but to do so would be a film without the strong presence, elequence and crisp delivery of Richard Burton--the actor's finest gifts. But alas, sometimes the tension between director and star can produce some of the finest examples of filmmaking, as we see here.  Ritt had repeatedly tired of Burton's drinking on the set and his tempest-tossed, on again-off again relationship with Ms. Taylor.

Moreover, in the physical sense Burton carries the role expertly as well. Bloated and looking physically and emotionally spent, LeCarre himself commented that Burton looked ""....as if he lived too well rather than having lived a lot..."" but it all seems to work effortlessly and Ritt directs a picture that engrosses the viewer until the very end.  It is noted that Lemas is supposedly 39 years old in the film, but Burton makes his protagonist look and feel as if 10-15 years older. That is, for lack of a better word, expert casting on the part of Ritt who went to bat for Burton with Paramount, put up with his issues, and met his salary demands.

Supporting cast is excellent with Oscar Werner as Fiedler, Cyril Cusack as Control, and Claire Bloom as Nan Perry all deserving top honors here. Even Bernard Lee, better known as ""M"" from the Bond films, is distinguished as a grocer who unfortunately demands ""cash"" rather than ""credit"" for Lemas' mock caviar, peaches, and scampi--a pivotal scene in the film--take my word for it.

Paired with this masterpiece, I don't think I have seen the dim world of espionage depicted as so brutally realistic than Yorkshire Television's ""The Sandbaggers"" (1978-80) featuring Roy Marsden and Ray Lonnen.",1181001600,3,2601,4.816143497757848

Alec Leamas, the haunted British spy for the U.S. has nothing to do with James Bond.  Richard Burton gives such a phenomenal performance as this rancid, cranky, solitary alcoholic (he wasn't entirely acting) that one can't help but wonder why he didn't get the Oscar for Best Performance that year.  Leamas is, in his own words, ""just a bloody man"", tired of all the ideologies on both sides of the fence which lead to all the horrors and betrayals he has witnessed and been a full participant in.  His paradox is a painful one; rejecting ""Karl Marx, God, and all the rest of it"", he is also a man beginning to realize that his career in espionage is one of sheer immorality.

Claire Bloom's Nan Perry is the catalyst for the tragic and unforgettable ending of the film.  A young woman Leamas meets while he works in a London library awaiting his next assignment from the charming and bone-chilling head of operations in Britan, George Smiley, she is also an avowed Communist.  When things come to a head and she is dragged into the brutal world Leamas inhabits, he tries desperately to communicate that she is only ""a frustrated little girl from a crackpot library"".

But the most heinous betrayal here is Leamas' skillful befriending and cold use of real Communist Oskar Werner.  Leamas pretends to defect from the British Agency and stages a brawl with a grocer to increase his appearance of discontent.  Werner is the to whom he discloses fictitious ""secrets"" about American espionage, all the while having cynical and hilarious dialogues with him about the whole situation.

At the end, with two victims of the dirty business he's involved himself in for some vague principle (protecting the ""moronic masses""), Leamas cannot go on.  He is very much on the fence so to speak and ends up on the wrong one quite intentionally. A haunting, beautiful movie.",1176508800,3,2161,4.70026525198939
310190,5,6301105915,"When it comes to the world of spy thrillers, both in the literary world and in the cinematic world, there is one effort that stands out as the definitive work of the genre: The Spy Who Came In From The Cold. The film version of the novel was released in 1965, at the height of the spy craze, and in many respects served as a counterpoint to that craze. Today, more then forty years later, the film stands out as the definitive work of the genre and features the best performance of one of the greatest actors of all time: Richard Burton.

Burton's performance as Alec Leamas is nothing short of stunning. Burton captures the essence of what a real-world spy must be like and is nothing like the character of 007 or his clones. Leamas is instead a quiet, non-trusting, cynical man who knows the ways of the world...perhaps too well. Leamas is a character that seems to have ""stayed out in the cold"" to the point that when he enters the normal world he feels out of place. Burton captures this very well during the film's first quarter in which he goes from Leamas the spy master to Leamas the ordinary man. But everything is not what it seems as the film progresses and the truth is gradually revealed (see the movie if you want to know the truth) and despite the fact that Leamas is back in his own world, he is still lost in it. Burton's performance perfectly suits this transformation that Leamas goes trough. Without a doubt, Burton's best moments are in the final ten minutes or so of this film as it draws towards and then reaches its tragic end. Burton's final moments in the film prove the point that sometimes a face can say more then words. Burton's nomination for an Oscar was well deserved and it is a shame that he didn't win for this film.

But Burton is just the tip of this films' remarkable cast. Claire Bloom is impressive as Nan Perry and holds her own against Burton in every scene. While too old to be the character from the novel she is still believable as the voice of reason in the film especially at the end. Peter van Eyck is silently menacing as Mundt and he cans end shivers up your spine at just the right moment. Cyril Cusack is quite and silently menacing as Control and one can't help but believe him at times even though we learn the truth in the end. Bernard Lee, famous as the boss of James Bond, makes a brief appearance as the grocer Patmore as if to prove how anti-Bond this film really is.

What makes this film stands out is the fact it is severely anti-Bond. Never does the script or director/ producer Martin Ritt ever venture outside the bleak, sunless, realistic world of the novel. If anything, the film enhances the novel's coldness. And it is the lack of action sequences that proves the realism. Is there death? Yes. Are people beaten? Yes. But never does it happen for thrills. Every death or act of violence seems an horrific act as it should. The film's end at the Berlin Wall is a classic moment to be sure for it encompasses the bleakness of the film by ending it on one of the saddest notes you could possibly end a movie on.

This film is a flawless classic. Burton was never better in a film and this is the one film of his everyone should see. The cast never fails in their abilities to add perfection. And the script, direction, music, and cinematography bring the dark world of the John le Carr classic to life. In short, this film is Engrossing, tense, emotional, and realistic. The Spy Who Came In From The Cold is the definitive spy film and there are no ifs, ands, or buts about it.",1175472000,4,3544,4.389649923896499
310191,5,6301105915,"Quite a few movies have been made about spies in cold war Berlin, the epicenter of the spy trade, some of them excellent.  Most of them based on the quite a few books written on the subject.  But the British movie ""The Spy Who Came in from the Cold,"" starring Richard Burton, stands at the top of the heap, as does the book of the same title, by the British John LeCarre, on which it is based.  They just don't get any better than this.

""Spy,"" directed by the American Martin Ritt, who elsewhere had a tendency to sentimentality, is diamond-hard -- not a scene is wasted, filmed in gritty black and white, an encyclopedic look at the wintry U.K.,and the freezing, divided Germany.  The divided Berlin, and its infamous wall, that's virtually the third star of the film. It concerns Alec Leamas (Burton), returned to London and MI5, the Secret Service, after failing in his last German mission.  Control (Cyril Cusack) offers him a desk job, but he prefers to go back into the field.  He must first seem to sink into alcoholism, violence and debauchery-- the genius of Burton's performance is such that it seems all too real-- and get himself in trouble with the law, the better to attract the attention of the opposite side. That he does.  He's then back in Germany; his mission, to protect an --unknown to him --British counterspy.  Along the way, he meets and hooks up with the beautiful Clair Bloom -- too old for her part, but it hardly mattered-- playing Nan Perry, a naive Communist party camp follower, assistant librarian.  She offered him, Burton says, in the movie's most famous line, ""free love,"" and ""that's all he could afford at the time."" It'll end up costing both of them, but Bloom undoubtedly the most.

Burton, as we used to say in Brooklyn, ""wuz robbed:"" that year the Oscar went to Lee Marvin for the lightweight ""Cat Ballou."" Burton and Bloom are backed by the usual assortment of excellent supporting players: Cusack, Oskar Werner as Fiedler, Sam Wanamaker as Peters, also George Voskovec, Rupert Davies, Peter von Eyck, Michael Hordern, Robert Hardy, and Bernard Lee, nowhere near ""M"" country.

The movie's an accurate snapshot of a particularly significant place at a particularly portentious time, and, though it's surely a downer, is likely to stand quite a while yet.  It's already outlived that hated, menacing Berlin Wall.",1172966400,3,2353,4.780246913580247
310192,5,6301105915,"I was never a Richard Burton fan until I discovered this movie. Richard Burton's acting in this movie is top notch to say the least. Burton is able to pull you into his character of British agent Alec Leamas and make it all seem believable. Thankfully the movie is presented in black and white, because it adds to the overall suspense and mood of the film. The DVD transfer and Dolby Digital 5.1 sound are excellent. It's hard to believe a movie from 1965 with no fancy gadgets or special computer effect's could be so entertaining, but it definitely is. The question is will Alec come in from the cold or does he have one more mission in him?

310230,5,6301105915,"Based on the novel by the acclaimed British author John Le Carre (who gave us the excellent SMILEY'S PEOPLE and the less steller CONSTANT GARDENER) this bleak look at Cold War espionage is actually compulsive viewing. I started watching the movie late one night fully expecting to stop about halfway through yet, there I was at 1 a.m. still transfixed at the unfolding drama.

Starring Richard Burton in perhaps one of his most impressive roles and co-starring Burton's one-time girlfriend the entrancing Claire Bloom, this movie is a complex, intricately woven movie that keeps one guessing. It starts in Germany and ends in Germany with stops in England and Holland inbetween. Burton plays Alec Leamas, a former head of British intelligence in Berlin who poses as a washed up agent as a means of implanting seeds of doubt about the loyalty of a communist spy in the minds of that spy's superiors. After beating up a grocer he is approached by East German intelligence and persuaded to ""defect"" to the East. Once there during the debriefing stage he begins to lay subtle clues in the hope that they will be picked up by the authorities, who will then p[iece together the clues and come to the conclusion that one of their star agents is a traitor. Sounds simple enough right?! Well, all is not as it seems and the real motive behind Leamas' ruse is one of those twists you don't see coming until it's too late.

Burton is ably supported by a brilliant supporting cast, from the aforementioned Bloom to Michael Horden as Ashe, a gay communist agent, Sam Wanamaker as Peters, Oskar Werner as the ambitious Fiedler and Robert Hardy as Dick Carlton to name just a few.

Released in 1965, this movie was made at a time when color was available for use, however the makers decided (wisely) to film it in black and white, a decision which really helps build atmosphere and drama.

I recommend this movie to everyone who likes complex plotting and espionage thrillers.",1141171200,13,1961,4.758823529411765
310231,4,6301105915,"John Le Carre is the best cold war novelist.  The Spy Who Came in From the Cold was one of his early novel and for those Le Carre fans an early appearance by George Smiley.

Alec Limas (Richard Burton) is the Berlin Section Chief recalled due to a failed mission.  Control wonders why Limas will not ""come in from the cold"" and take a desk job.  But this situation suits what Control needs.  He needs Limas to go undercover as a disillusioned agent and feed information to the East Germans that one of their operatives is a double agent for the British.

Alec is sent to work at a bookstore and make friends with a British communist Nancy Perry (Claire Bloom).  He stages a fight to get arrested.  When he is released he is approached by a man that represents the Link, an interest that helps recently released prisoners.  He is offered 15,000 to commit his memoirs to paper.  He is taken to an isolated house outside of Amsterdam where the interrogation begins.  He is eventually taken to East Germany.  All goes well, Munt is tried for treason with Limas as the star witness.

The defense brings in Nancy, to protect her Limas crumbles and tells all.  In typical Le Carre fashion, there are more twists and turns.

Director Martin Ritt is not known of atmospheric films but this film is high on atmosphere.  Ritt is known for his gritty dramas, high on social conscience.  This is a great style change.  This is a gritty drama with social conscience but it has great atmospheric pace.

Richard Burton gives a fine performance as the disillusioned Limas.  He gives many layers to the role.  This shows what a great actor he was.

This is a great film based on a great book, directed by a great actor and starring a superior cast.

He himself had something to do with that , of course .

In this film , you see what the life of a spy might really have been like . It is a job where the person's real feelings are always hidden and other people are looked at according to their uses . However , Burton has been a spy for too long and we are there to witness his downward slide .

The black and white picture helps to portray the slowness of his existence .

It seems sad to say it , but watch this for a realisation of the wonderful talent Richard Burton had . There were only a few more good roles for him after this .

310236,5,6301105915,"The dour and disillusioned Richard Burton is superb as British espionage agent Alec Leamus former station chief in Berlin.  The Martin Ritt directed adaptation of the John Le Carre novel is shot in black and white adding to the austere mood of the flick.

Burton is pulled back in by his controller the prim and proper Cyril Cusack for another assignment.  He is to play the role of an embittered, alcoholic agent willing to defect to the other side to discredit the East German station chief Mundt played by Peter Van Eyck.  By his revelations he will help germinate the seeds that have been planted against Mundt endeavoring to force second in command Oskar Werner to liquidate him.

Along the way, while creating his cover in England, Burton takes a job as a librarian.  There he meets Claire Bloom playing librarian Nan Perry, a naive Communist sympathizer.  They become involved and Burton now has a worthwhile relationship in the midst of all the dealings and double dealings. He tries to salvage some modicum of pride and decency as he tries to rise above his role in the dirty business that was representative of cold war espionage.

Director Ritt and the entire cast created an very bleak yet accurate portrayal of the role of the spy in these times.  ""The Spy Who Came in From the Cold"" was the antithesis of James Bond type movies that glorified the sexy exploits of government agents.  Ex-operative LeCarre with monochromatic black and white brushstrokes spawned a gritty tale of behind the scenes activities that typified the actions of both sides during this Cold War period.",1120521600,3,1589,4.830258302583026
310297,5,6301105915,"I needn't repeat all the fine reviews preceding mine. Just a few salient items round them out.

First, as Martin Ritt never made a bad film, this is among his finest, especially in his poetic understanding of LeCarre's masterpiece. How his colleague and competitor Sir Carol Reed must have smiled upon that moment when Burton, seeing his photo on the front page of The Times, listed as missing and sought by the police, looks westward from Holland's shores toward an invisible Britain, the Channel's mist symbolic of an England which he then knows he'll never see again. This must be among all of filmdom's finest moments.

Second, the wondrous collusion between Ritt and LeCarre is masterful. To belabor the point: As 20th century prosody shakes out, the author doubtless will be considered among the top of the heap. If ever a film faithfully transferred not just plot, not just characters, but as well the ethos of the writing, Ritt's film does it.

Third, the electricity between Burton and Bloom is ecstatic in the literal sense precisely because she is no sex-pot and he is, in fact, a burned-out sot. Her need of him is electrifying because of her need for realizing herself. This LeCarre struggled to portray in the book, and Ritt brought it out so beautifully in this splendid actress, Burton so masterfully assisting her. What a protege quality to their roles!

Fourth, for those of us devotees of George Smiley, Rupert Davies' Smiley role is perfectly cast, well fitting LeCarre's description of him. No one would ever fault the decades-later portrayal by Sir Alec Guinness, of course, because he gave the role in impression. But Davies, for his spare moments in the film, shows us what Smiley looks like in LeCarre's ink.

Fifth, the writing is superlative, LeCarre having had the major hand in the screenplay. The more philosophic conversations thankfully are easily summarized by Bloom, Burton, Cusack and Werner, quite to the point, sparing us any contrivances. Only the later Rohmer could have done more, but his type of talent would have destroyed this picture.

Sixth, what a good transfer this is, for sound as well as sight. Altogether, it is fine film-making. And that this movie in its generation is a faithful representation of an early LeCarre work makes it a joy to see, so tragic as it is.",1113523200,8,2315,4.877862595419847
310298,4,6301105915,"In another review here (a good one, too), I found out that Richard Burton lost the Best Actor Oscar to Lee Marvin in CAT BALLOU, thus solidifying my opinion that the Academy Awards operate at the level of a high school popularity contest.

(I believe Burton and fellow hellraiser Peter O'Toole share the record for most nominations without a win: 8 apiece).

Shot in a stark black and white, THE SPY WHO CAME IN FROM THE COLD is definitely closer to the down and dirty business of Cold War spying than James Bond.

There are no exotic locales or a parade of bikini-clad babes, but there is plenty of intrigue and double-crossing as a cynical, broken Richard Burton descends further into the spider's web of the Cold War.  More thought-provoking than thrilling, SPY remains as a cold reminder that the Cold War wasn't just fodder for the swingin' Sixties culture.

I never thought I'd live to see the Berlin War fall, such was the climate of fear that the, to quote Ronald Reagan, ""empire of evil"" maintained in my lifetime.  It fell in 1989.  This film is a reminder of what a powerful and scary symbol that wall used to be.",1111622400,5,1124,4.562189054726368
310299,4,6301105915,"The Spy who came in from the Cold is a superb counterpoint to the normal Cold War fare perpeuated in film. That is, James Bond and such like, though this is admittedly camp fun aimed at taking the sting out of the conflict. Out went the glitzy, gaudy world and in came one of grit and drizzle. Richard Burton was a magnificent film actor and he gave one of his greatest screen performances in this fascinating piece of work.

There is an absurd man in the reviews here who gave this film one star and called it anti-American and pro-soviet, highlighting his own wretched bufoonery. This is a British film, so could not have been made by 'American liberals' as this man seems to think. Such useful fools highlight the political nature of the film however, as the whole Spy who came in from the Cold story refers to the sense in which there were human beings - on both sides - who fought in the Cold War. They were each as flawed as one another; that is the essence of the story. Here in Britain we were allies of America during this period, but the Burton character illustrates the in-between sense of many Britons, who did not wish to participate in anti-leftwing hysteria as Cold Warriors (such as the moron mentioned above, who should really seek out a psyciatrist). We were not pro-Soviet, but we were not mentally unbalanced or racist either. This is a film of our own, and should be seen as such - a British film impenetrable from Russian or American propaganda.",1111017600,5,1467,4.515037593984962

made piece of anti-western propoganda.  But it is very
interesting for those studying the systematic propoganda
campaign of liberals against america in the 1960s.

This was only nominally a british film.  The director (Ritt)
was a proud American Communist.

This film targets the men on the front line of our struggle
for survival against the communists in the intelligence
services.  Destroying the American people's support for
their military and intelligence institutions was high on the
list of goals for the liberals at the time.

The film has Richard Burton playing a spy on a deep cover
mission into enemy territory.  He is to pretend to defect
to the enemy as part of the mission.

The director goes out of his way to make the communists look
like ultra-clean superhumans while Burton is made to look a
total mess through the entire length of the film.  A weak man,
much inferior to the communists around him and certainly not
able to match them in any way.  Even the gates of the free world
at the Berlin Wall are made by the director into something out
of a nightmare.

The film ends with Richard Burton giving a long, well-prepared
propoganda speech telling the free world to give up on defending

Working in a library, he forms a romance with Nan Perry (Claire Bloom), a  young English librarian, who finds meaning in her life, with doctrinaire Communist views, and her activities in the British Communist Party.
Leamas is later asked by the service to help cover for a East German spy, secretly working for the British, and is asked to make contact with East German agents in Holland, before being taken back to Berlin.
A rather ironic and slow moving film, with some brilliant dialogue and little action.
The end gives some more ironic evidence of how the Communists devour their own , how those who devote their lives to `The Party' often end up as it's victims.",1099353600,7,883,4.696774193548387
310303,4,6301105915,"In the wake of the success of James Bond, every other film in the 1960's seemed to be about spies in one way or another. This tight little espionage film is the complete opposite extreme to the world of 007 - it's shot in gritty black and white on mostly seedy locations and populated almost entirely by the sort of characters you would never invite home for dinner. Also much more realistic than The Ipcress File, this early story by John Le Carre shows the flair for convoluted plots and two-faced characters that would make later works such as Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy and Smiley's People so fascinating. The enigmatic George Smiley is even a minor player in this caper, but the central character is much more of a Sixties anti-hero.

Richard Burton plays Alec Leamas, a slightly over the hill, vaguely alcoholic, somewhat cynical operative who becomes the key player - or possibly pawn - in an elaborate plot to protect a high-ranking double agent in East Germany in the darkest days of the cold war. Burton gives one of his better and more restrained performances - not shouting so much and letting his expressive eyes do a lot of the acting for him. Not surprisingly, he makes quite a believeable drunk - and an almost equally believable possible defector. Only in the film's final scene does that credibility slip slightly, but by then he has done his job and can be forgiven a momentary lapse.

Even better in the acting department is Oskar Werner as the East German counter-intelligence officer who is feared by everyone because of his brilliance and disliked by his compatriots because he is Jewish. Werner masterfully displays the cool and calculating demeanor of his character - always thinking and underplaying wonderfully until he suddenly erupts with passion or anger. He is both dangerous and charming. Not necessarily a villain, but a man to be very very careful with. Werner does not appear until the second half of the film but, when he does, all the tension and electricity in the air shifts up a gear.

Burton's frequent co-star Claire Bloom provides a kind of love interest as a non-descript Englishwoman with decidedly left-wing views. Peter Van Eyck is cold steel as an East German intelligence chief. Michael Hordern takes a change of pace to play an effeminate British agent. Even James Bond's M - Bernard Lee - puts in an appearance. Not as someone in the secret service but as the rather dour owner of a corner shop.

The look of the film is one of grim reality. We can almost believe that this is the way real spies live, die and operate. Until we remember that this is just a movie and hope that what we are watching is no more an accurate representation of reality than the exploits of Ian Fleming's hero. It's a good film - a thought-provoking one. And a measure of its success is how much we believe in it.",1094169600,13,2840,4.6626746506986025
310304,5,6301105915,"I saw this movie when it came out, and was immediately struck by how raw and realistic it was. To this day, I have been impressed by every one of Richard Burton's B&W movies. For some reason he shines in them like a beacon, while he slums through the more glamorous, and ultimately less successful color movies he's been in. These movies include: ""Look Back In Anger"", ""Night of the Iguana"", ""Spy"", ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf"", ""My Cousin Rachel"" and ""The Bramble Bush"". ""Iguana"", ""Rachel"" and ""Bush"" weren't as impressive as the others, but for some reason, Burton still commands the camera better in them in monochrome than he would have in color. Go figure.

The man was VASTLY underrated as an actor...well, maybe not underrated, but under-CONGRATULATED, since he never won an Oscar for any of his incredible, intense performances! He and Peter O'Toole were the crown PRINCES of intense! O'Toole, also, never won an Oscar, except for the Life Achievement Award he won just recently.

""Spy"" was one of those landmark movies of the sixties that broke with type and showed the moviegoing public what life was REALLY like in a certain type of world. ""Blow-Up"" was another movie like this, showing how strange the world of fashion photographers could be. The psychiatric dramas ""David & Lisa"" and ""Lilith"" showed the world of adolescent and adult psychology in a true-to-life fashion, and ""Spy"" showed how dreary, deadly, grey and angst-ridden espionage could be, going against the glamourous, over-the-top image the Bond and Flint films and all their imitators had projected.

In the film, Burton plays a character named Alec Leames, an upper-middle-aged agent working for British Intelligence in the midst of the Cold War. The film opens with him, in fact, overseeing the defection of an East German at Checkpoint Charlie, perhaps THE major symbol of the Cold War. From there, it follows him in further dealings with East Germany trying to track down a double agent. He falls into a relationship with a pert but naive little communist played by Claire Bloom, gets approached by smarmy types trying to get him to defect to the OTHER side, with him masquerading AS a possible defector for BI, under the auspices of Cyril Cusack, an actor who has played some of the most condescending elitist types in movies. His characters are almost always in powerful middle management positions and always, ALWAYS have pedantic attitudes. His character, though he actually ISN'T the legendary George Smiley, was nonetheless the obvious prototype for Sir Alec Guinness' portrayal of Smiley in the BBC/PBS series based on Le Carre's novels. The Smiley character is actually a minor entity in this film, played by a rather nerdy actor.

Oskar Werner, who, along with Cusack, was very hot in ""important"" movies at the time, plays an East German investigator, prosecutor and negotiator. Cusack, in fact, starred with him in the Truffaut sci-fi classic ""Fahrenheit 451"" as well. Burton, Bloom, Cusack, Werner and Michael Holdern (Lillian Helman's long-lost twin brother)....This cast couldn't have gotten any classier if it had tried!

The B&W cinematography, the casting, Burton's performance, the relentlessly grey and doleful feel of the film, Martin Ritt's expert direction, (the man was a VERY reliable ""good movie"" director,) all add the dramatic touches that make this film the absolute BEST film about espionage in my experience! Claire Bloom's character, Nan, offsets and emphasizes the dreary feel of the movie with her own naivet and altruism.

Why this film didn't sweep the '66 Academy Awards, I'll never know, but rest assured, it was the best dramatic offering in theaters that year. A complex, disturbing, important and incredible film that should, in retrospect, be honored for the work of art it was.

Highly recommended!",1092355200,9,3824,5.089314194577352
310305,5,6301105915,"The first thing you must know about this film is that it is nothing like James Bond. Bond films are full of gadgets, sex, Martinis and flashy action sequences...

...While this film presents you a whole different vision (that one might think is a lot more closer to reality - if such could be achieved concerning the espionage theme).

It tells the story of an older british spy stationed in Berlin who refuses to come home and accept a job behind a desk. What he does instead is go on a very dangerous mission the ends up nothing like you may expect.

This film has many great things. First it looks closely at the sometimes wicked world of espionage, where good people sometimes do horrible things. In such world, spies

are nothing but pawns (unlike the hero imagem displayed on most espionage thrillers). Here, you will find a lot of broken down people and moral dilemas.

The second great thing about this film is the cast. Richard Burton is the perfect man for this role: his performance is a powerhouse. After seeing the film, I got the impression there are no more actors today with such a strong, commanding face. He really makes you believe such spies exist. The whole cast shines with Claire Bloom, Cyril Cusack and Oskar Werner.

Third great thing: the black and white cinematography by Oswald Morris is superb! It gives enhances the bleak, cold vision of a political world where truth and good are just a matter of point of view.

This is not a James Bond-like action thriller full of escapades and mad scientists. This is a film about people (who happen to work on the espionage business) and the way they can possibly be used.

Unforgettable!",1091059200,20,1657,4.631399317406143
310306,5,6301105915,"The less I say the better -- I wish they had a place where people who've seen this masterpiece can discuss it. In short, everybody is lying, and the main character doesn't even realize what's going on till the very end. When that end comes, if you believe the world to be the way the movie describes it ... oh, well. Your skin will crawl at the horrific nature of the human condition.
