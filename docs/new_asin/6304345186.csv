850461,5,6304345186,"If you and your child love Thomas the Tank Engine and all his friends, and you've seen the many videos, the songs on this collection will remind you of why kids love the popular train stories.  All songs will be familiar to you, and you'll be surprised when you realize how much more you like the song(s) after you know what the words are!  My 3 year old son is mesmerized whenever he watches this video. Most of the seven songs relate to Thomas but a few have some 'words of wisdom' that I think are useful and appropriate for kids and adults of all ages.  ""Gone Fishing"" reminds you to take a break and relax after working hard and ""Don't Judge a Book By Its Cover"" says it all. My only wish is that a 2nd version or ""volume 2"" is released soon as this compilation was done in 1995.",985824000,4,784,4.178807947019868

850567,1,6304345186,My grandson who is three knows all the songs from the TV program Thomas the Train.  Few if any of the songs that are found in the shows are on this cd.  My daughter said it was okay but not at all what they had hoped for.,1381363200,,221,3.6808510638297873
850568,5,6304345186,My 9 month old LOVES this sing along! He loves music and this always calms him down if he is upset. The music is very calming and not so obnoxious like other kid's videos are. There are also a couple of stories which is fun!,1362096000,2,224,4.0
850569,3,6304345186,I purchased this tape a long time ago and must assume that our grandchildren enjoyed it.  This requirement to add additional words does not apply in all cases.  It was likely well received!,1359936000,,189,4.696969696969697
850570,2,6304345186,The disc we received was VERY scratched and had crusty stuff on it. We had to clean the disc and use scratch repair before playing it. The DVD is ok. Not great. My four-year-old was not too interested even though he loves Thomas.,1319932800,,229,4.348837209302325
850571,5,6304345186,"..but beware! It's the exact same as the ""Hop on Board"" songs from the station with dvd and cd set I bought from Target a few weeks ago, just packaged differently! Soooo, now I have two, oh well, it's a good back up disc because my son loves it! Woohoo!",1250553600,2,253,4.08

850573,5,6304345186,"My son loves this so much. We had the VHS tape, played it so much it broke. Now I have to buy the DVD! He is learning all the songs, and he loves the stories, which he repeats while he is playing with his trains.",1229904000,4,212,3.7333333333333334
850574,3,6304345186,"My two sons love songs in the Thomas DVD, so I decided to get one with bunch of songs. We also bought ""Thomas & Friends - Songs From the Station"" together with this one. For some reason, they clearly like ""Thomas & Friends - Songs From the Station "" better than this one. I still think it's a great DVD but you gotta listen what your children tell you.",1224288000,,352,4.115942028985507

850616,5,6304345186,"This DVD is great my two toddler boys love all the sing alongs on it. I think more Thomas DVD's should be like this one. The stories are great, but what my kids look forward to is the music. Great DVD for all Thomas & Friends fans.",1191283200,8,231,3.9361702127659575
850617,5,6304345186,This is a must have for all Thomas fans.  My son couldn't get enough of this DVD.,1182988800,4,81,3.764705882352941

850620,5,6304345186,"I purchased this sing-a-long for my 2 year-old son. He loved it, and he and I would sing together. The lyrics are good and educational. As an adult, the lyrics reminds me of some of the basic lessons in life!

I recommend this DVD to anyone with kids!",1152230400,6,251,4.229166666666667
850621,5,6304345186,"My son loves Thomas but the stories seem sort of slow.  He loses interest in them so quickly.  However, this video keeps his attention.  He watches it again and again.  The songs are cute and catchy.  He sings them around the house!!!  I highly recommend this to any person who has a little Thomas lover in their home!!",1142467200,2,319,4.413793103448276
850674,5,6304345186,"Ever since they introduced the music videos to the Thomas videos, I've loved Thomas even more. They just add some musical fun and excitement to the videos and they're so catchy, you will sing them all the time, I know I sometimes find myself singing them. I'm sure little kids will want to watch this over and over and over again. Here are the music videos:

1)Thomas' Anthem 5/5

2)Let's Have A Race 5/5

3)Gone Fishin' 6/5

4)Toby 5/5

5)Don't Judge A Book By It's Cover 5/5

6)Island Song 6/5

7)Really Useful Engine 6/5

Now, besides all the musical fun featured on this video, there is also 2 ALL NEW stories on here, they are:

Peter Sam & The Refreshment Lady 5/5:

Peter Sam arrives at the station a bit late and Henry tells him that if he is late again, he will just leave the station without the passengers. The next day, Peter Sam is must take the Refreshment Lady along with some passengers. Determined not to be late, Peter Sam starts quickly, but ends up leaving the Refreshment Lady behind.

Bulldog 5/5:

One day, Duke and Falcon had to take some passengers through the old railway. Falcon didn't listen to Duke's advice about looking at the tracks and ends up coming off of the tracks and Duke must try his hardest to pull him back on track.

Overall, great Thomas video. Great for musical fans like me and for fans of the little engines. I hope my review has helped you.",1099612800,13,1388,4.438735177865612
850675,5,6304345186,This was Thomas's first musical tape and it was certainly better than the next musical one. The two episodes are Peter Sam and the Refreshment Lady and Bulldog. Peter Sam and the Refreshment Lady is about how Peter Sam rushes to make sure he gets to Henry in time but he leaves the refreshment lady behind. In Bulldog Duke saves Falcon and he shows no matter how old you are you can still be useful. The stories on this tape focus on the little engines which is great because I don't think they have enough stories. Little kids love to dance to the songs and it's a greatidea for Christmas and Birthday presents.,1076716800,2,612,4.424778761061947
850676,5,6304345186,"This is the first Thomas video that we have purchased, and my 2 year old just loves it. He is in that ""lets watch it again, and again"" mode. The songs are simple and catchy.  The only thing I can find wrong-it is a short video (about a 1/2 hour long).",1046217600,,251,3.9215686274509802
850677,5,6304345186,"This video is one of the best (if not the best) video that my son likes. When he was little (1 year) we had a problem with needing to skip through the stories as he was only interested in the songs, but now he likes the stories too.
The songs are excellent, the words are displayed on the bottom of the screen, and everyone is always singing them after a few times of seeing the video. If your kid likes cars and other vehicles (like my kid likes), it is a must.
