The series takes a little while to build up, but once it gets going, it'll have you marathonning them.",1210291200,5,278,4.6938775510204085
3157113,1,B0016K76XC,Shame on you Anime Works! You decide to get rid of your overstock by re-releasing all 5 volumes in one set at basically 1/5 the cost. For anyone who dosen't already own these I guess its great. Also its a lesson to people like myself.... DONT BUY DVDS THE FIRST TIME AROUND. just wait a couple years for the re-relase and get them dirt cheap. They just better release the rest of the series at the same price point.... Grrr...,1209081600,2,426,4.3375

8262736,3,B0016K76XC,"I Like the GaoGaiGar series it's a GREAT series to watch, right up there with the best of Japanese Animation, however This was not as advertised. The advertisement says it's a boxed set, this is however NOT the case. While it IS in a large box it only has ONE DVD in the box and a cardboard filler in place of where the other four DVD cases were supposed to be.",1423267200,,361,4.098591549295775
8262737,5,B0016K76XC,What an amazing ride. Gaogaigar riles you up to the max and satisfies every whim in your body. Absolutely watch this incredible show,1408320000,,132,4.782608695652174
8262738,5,B0016K76XC,One of my fav anime's. Looks and sounds nice!,1404086400,,45,4.111111111111111
8262739,5,B0016K76XC,"One of the most awesome Yuusha series out there. The English Dub is even pretty decent. Comes in a lovely case too. Bit more childish, but somehow it encourages you to be brave and at your best without shoving it in your face like now-a-days. A very uplifting show.",1364342400,,265,4.428571428571429
8262740,5,B0016K76XC,"If you don't have Gaogaigar you are TRULY missing out on an iconic anime!!! Transformations galore & epic fights are all in this series, you need to get this series!!",1363392000,,166,4.566666666666666
8262741,3,B0016K76XC,"I have been a fan of anime for a long time. I watched the Gaogaigar Final series first, which is eight episodes long, not having access to this series until this box set release, and found the Gaogaigar regular series a major disappointment. The plot was already known to me which is simply aliens are invading the Earth and a pack of robots with brave heroes seek to save it. What I didn't like about the series was the execution of a plodding plot line along with some episodes that are nearly exact clones of eachother. To make matters worse, there are a couple of episodes in the second box set, mainly disk 9, that robot transformation sequences fill half the episode. For viewers watching it for the first time, the box set ends with the introduction to the Gaogaigar Final series and that is not included in these sets. A new villain, Mamoru bails abruptly, and no explanations for it. For those who either are fans of this genre or curious about Japanese anime the Gaogaigar regular series is not the place to start.",1346198400,,1024,4.54054054054054
8262742,3,B0016K76XC,"This anime gives the felling of watching a cartoon. To better explain there are no adult situations or major story line to follow. Each episode is basically the same thing, using the same transforming sequence scene in each episode. The episodes are as follows. 1) person is turned into a Zonder 2)Guy's big robot plus two smaller robots use tools that look like a screw driver, pencil, and a eraser to defeat the Zonder 3)The kid transforms the Zonder back into a human. Each episode is not tied to the one before it. GaoGaiGar does offer heart warming friendship in extreme situations and fairly good dubbing. The ending of each episode provides the question of what will happen next. Basically this anime is for someone that is fairly young and is placed in what i call the cookie cutter section or styling for anime.",1341273600,,820,4.701388888888889
8262743,3,B0016K76XC,"The earlier episodes were kinda generic but fortunately I already knew about that having heard it starts out weak.

Actually as of now it seems the series is building toward something. I'd previous heard there's a second villain group, who I assume will appear shortly into the second half. The current villains aren't too interesting unfortunately; one of the Machine Kings appears to be developing a backstory but that's about it.

Actually Gaogaigar has a huge cast and while some characters are likable so far we haven't found out much about them with the exceptions of the most central characters. As the series progresses things get somewhat zanier. Generally speaking the quality of the episodes with little time spent on people hanging around the heroes' tends to be better than those focusing on characters discussing recent events in the base, which on occasion became repetitive.

It hasn't yet become anything special but I will wait until seeing Gaogaigar in its entirety since pretty interesting stuff seems to be coming up in the near future of the show.",1299542400,,1069,5.028248587570621
8262744,4,B0016K76XC,"I have been a big fan of Japanese animation for a long time, but this was always one of my favorites. I'm glad I got a chance to get the series before it was gone. I have missed a few in the past thinking ""ill wait for it to go down in price"" Bad idea. My advice, if you like it, buy it before it gets away.
The voice acting is good in this series, the only thing I wish they did was subtitle the names of locations when they are splashed on the screen, other than that it was great.
And one last thing

FINAL FUSION Complete!!!!!!",1251072000,2,531,3.9166666666666665
8262745,5,B0016K76XC,"What's there to say? It's a great show and a great example of the giant-robot vrs aliens genre.

Excellent soundtrack as well.",1218585600,2,126,4.7272727272727275
