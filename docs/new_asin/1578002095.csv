7799064,4,1578002095,"Slayers is one of those anime that could be turned into a video game, and not lose any of it's storyline. Those people who enjoy video games such as RPG's (Role Playing Games) are bound to love this show. The main character is Lina Inverse, a young girl who's temper is rivaled only by the spells she casts. Throughout the show companions join up with her, such as a dumber-then-dirt swordsman and an insane over-rightous girl.
The animation in this show is alright; I've seen better in such animes as Fushigi Yugi or Cowboy Bebop. My main complaint, though, is that in the earlier stages of the show it seems to be just one battle after another, and they all seem begin and end the same way with a buch of beasts surrounding he heros, and the heros beating them again and again and again.
Overall, the show is enjoyable and funny anime that all ages will find amusing.",1018224000,,869,4.471698113207547
7799065,5,1578002095,"when I first rented these from my local video store, I wasn't quite sure what to expect. As soon as I got home and watched the first video ,I realized that I had accidentaly stumbled onto the most incredible animation  series ever made. This boxed set is an exellent deal,it's definetly worth  your money. The stories in here go through the defeat of the dark lord,  Sharbranigdo. The stories are well written ,witty and extremely funny. The  animation is awesome the voice acting is great and this story arc in  particular is way cool. Do your self a big favor and order this set now,and  remeber slayers forever.",949881600,3,614,4.638888888888889
7799066,5,1578002095,"The fantasy genre is one that's far harder to do poorly than many creators seem to think. If this wasn't the case, there'd be a lot less abomniable fantasy books, movies, and cartoons out there. For those who want to see  how it's done right, I recommend this collection of ""Slayers"" TV  episodes.
""Slayers"" has everything that a good fantasy yarn  should have... interesting and likable heroes, interesting bad guys with  motivations that one can relate to, and a well-conceived, tightly plotted  storyline. Interesting character interplay, twists and turns and plot  reversals... ""Slayers"" provides all of these things in  spades.
To make things even better, ""Slayers"" is a fantasy  comedy that's actually funny... it has fun with the fantasy genre, but is  never contempteous of it, even when the characters are making comments  about how cliched the situation they are in is.
The quality of the  animation is also top-notch; it may not have the abundance of computer  effects that have become so common of late, but it is nonetheless heads and  shoulders above many other animated television series.
If you like  light-hearted fantasy, I think this boxed set is for you. Lina Inverse (the  short sorceress with the even shorter fuse) and Gourry (the numb-skulled  but noble warrior) are as entertaining a pair of fantasy archetypes as  you're likely to find in the animated medium.",947635200,4,1385,5.057522123893805
7799067,5,1578002095,"Okay, It's been three days since I saw my first episode of this series, and I'm addicted.  I cannot watch an episode without bursting out laughing.  These four episodes are a must see! I  must go, I need to beg my video  store to get the next four tapes.",947203200,,254,4.122448979591836
7799068,5,1578002095,"This is excellent dubbed anime. I can't get enough of Slayers!  I watch it practically every week... I can watch it over 100 times and I still get a kick out of it! Each time I watch it, it excites me more and more.  Genius! It's just plain genius!",942019200,2,248,4.040816326530612
7799069,4,1578002095,"This anime was a great one, with our greedy, little sorceress Lina and her ""bodyguard"", the thick-headed Gourry. The episodes are gret, but I give it a 4 cuz the voices weren't all that~ but I do recommend this  set...I guess you can overlook the fact that Amelia's voice is blah~!  (The  delivery is  good...I got the set about 2 or 3 weeks after I sent the  check.) I suggest that you should also see the other episodes of Slayers,  and Slayers NEXT~",935712000,,452,4.385542168674699
7799070,5,1578002095,"Lina and Goury have to be THE most hilarious pair in Japanese animation. In a medieval-type world, Lina, a hotheaded, money-seeking, loud-mouthed sorceress, meets Goury, the talented yet *ahem* dumb swordsman.  Together,  they get caught up in a lot of trouble.  This certainly is a great buy that  will bring tons of enjoyment.  You'll get caught up in the adventures,  laugh, and watch every video till your eyes fall out, but mostly laugh.",929232000,,442,4.986301369863014
