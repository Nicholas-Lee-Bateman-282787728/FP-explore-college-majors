7541109,5,B0186VAZY0,"Well look who is back. This smart black comedy goes further a simple entertainment. It's a surrealistic vision about the endless question. What if?

Adolph lands on October 2014, sixty nine years the downfall and he has to manage with the Germany of the new century. When a journalist finds him, you'll be carried out to a set of smart reflections arid points of view and several opened questions about a lot of unsolved challenges.

In terms of cinematography is terrific. Its dynamic plot captures you from the very beginning. Kudos for the screenwriters! No doubt it and give you a try with this original proposal.",1466121600,,617,4.811320754716981
7541110,2,B0186VAZY0,"As a stand-alone movie, I give it praise. But as a movie based on a book, no way. The movie is VERY different from the book. I wonder how the author felt about this treatment. Because I read the book first and enjoyed it very much, I did not enjoy the movie. It had its hilarious moments (but not nearly as many as in the book), but I did not appreciate the wide departure from the narrative of the book.",1465948800,2,404,4.0625
7541111,5,B0186VAZY0,This movie was hilarious and thought provoking. I am glad the Germans let their hair down and made this film. I haven't enjoyed a film that made me laugh and think in a very long  time. It was just so good.,1465344000,,206,4.024390243902439

7541113,5,B0186VAZY0,"A funny but serious film with an even more serious message. The film was very entertaining but knowing that books are generally better than films, I am now reading the book.",1464652800,2,173,4.612903225806452

7541115,5,B0186VAZY0,"This was amazing. Really funny, original, and thought provoking. Totally unexpected. I don't know what to write because it's a little indescribable and I wouldn't want to spoil it for anyone.",1462406400,,191,5.193548387096774
7541116,5,B0186VAZY0,"Er ist wieder da is the original title of this absolute gem of a film from Germany and it is a comedy  of sorts. The plot is that Adolf materialises in 2014 straight from 1945 and is totally befuddled as to what has happened to the rubble, the enemy aircraft and why the youth don't seem to recognise him or even worse they don't know how to do the Nazi salute.

We have the parallel story of Fabian Sawatzki who is a freelance film maker in need of a break and he sees Der Fuhrer as a handy meal ticket back into TV. So begins the odyssey and to say this is inspired is a massive understatement.

This is a comedy and it is the most I have laughed in ages. The idea of juxtaposing Hitlers views as comedy material is genius. Now there is a big however here and that is his views are still pretty offensive even in this context.

The actor playing him is Oliver Masucci and he is an absolute show stealer. Some of this has been adlibbed on actual German streets and other situations and some of the reactions of the public are remarkable for all the right and wrong reasons. This is though an incredibly refreshing and novel film that I am so glad I got to see  I saw it on Netflix and this justifies my monthly subscription for the next six months  this will not be for everyone but if you are open to a new twist on bad things then you will hopefully enjoy this as much as I did.",1462060800,15,1381,4.115241635687732
7541117,5,B0186VAZY0,"The story was so original and interesting it threw me off and went nothing like I expected a typical Hitler comedy to go like. When I was younger I used to be fascinated with WW2 and German history and read a lot and watched many documentaries on the subject. You could say at one point I even chose the completely wrong side. And with everything I thought I'd have known, this movie still managed to stimulate my mind and feel like I got a better picture of the personality of one of the most influential figures of the 20th century. It may sound stupid hearing that impression from a satire movie, but it's a refreshing different picture and in a new environment that widens your perspective more than all the repetitive ww2 documentaries/films can do.

One thing I found very refreshing was how the film doesn't really seem to be very biased or leaning towards one way or another. It doesn't ruin a movie by pushing some view upon you. You're being told a story and given many ways to interpret it. You can be supporting certain things said while still feeling like you learned some moral lessons so you can remain a good person and sleep at night (if you need that sort of thing lol).

The cinematography, sounds, and story couldn't have been better executed. I get chills every time I see one of the scenes at the end. The scene at the end when Hitler is riding in a convertible car and the happy music starts to slow down and distort as he passes more people who support him with salutes in this day and age, and then it shows his notorious face with that sharp nose overshadowed by his hat, the way the orange light hits it, and his quite accurately recreated voice says ""Everything has a deeper meaning"".

It's such a treat to run into such a mentally stimulating film.",1460851200,27,1777,4.461538461538462
7541118,5,B0186VAZY0,"I must admit first it's kinda slow. And a couple moment in the film you could feel the actors trying to hard or over acting. But this film is a master piece for what it became. I'm not sure what reactions they excpected to get with the public but I doubt they were think that everyone younger would be happy to see hitler walking down the street in Germany. It a shocking, funny and arguably disturbing film that shows what modern gerations truly feel about hilter. It's a controversial film and I have the highest of recomendations! 8 outta 10.",1499558400,,545,4.46
7541119,5,B0186VAZY0,Extremely clever and very timely considering our present political situation. A very useful message but it lets you down easily with great humor. Highly recommend this.,1498089600,,168,5.5
7541120,1,B0186VAZY0,This is beyond belief.  How insensitive can this age get.  There is little hope for our future.  How soon or out of touch can we get.  The topper is the Germans have the gaul to make Hitler a joke.,1496966400,,197,3.9743589743589745
7541121,5,B0186VAZY0,"I first saw this on Amazon Prime and really liked it, so much so I bought the DVD and the original book. The DVD adds some subplots not found in the book, while the book had much more of what was going on in Hitler's head in 2010. Incidentally, the Seller DaaVeeDee has this DVD on his website (of same name) for about $8.00 cheaper than found here and where I bought it.

As a side note, this DVD had a really nice 2 minute (shortened version) song near the end of the movie called ""Er Ist Wieder Da"" (""He's Back, But Not With Me"") sung by Katja Ebstein when Hitler is riding in an open car and people are reacting to him. The actual 1968 song is 3 minutes long. You can find it on You Tube, download the MP4 video from it and convert it to MP3 using VLC.",1491264000,,756,4.006622516556291

7541123,5,B0186VAZY0,"People get hung up on the false history of WWII and cannot understand this movie. It is said that in war the victor writes the history.
Hitler cannot return as he is dead. What returns is his movement for sovereignty that rebels against the World's Central bankers and those who own the media and infiltrate the sovereignty of governments.
He trashes Merkel, the media, the Jewish family is portrayed as Satanists which the Rothschild are, the Jew hosting the TV program is a non-Semetic European Khazar convert and colors his skin and changes his hair to look like an Arab Semite. The German people love the message and at the end because his character portrays and ideal not a person thus it cannot die.
There is a speech by Benjamin Freedman (a Jew) on YouTube that clarifies the history of WWI and WWII. Get an education and play it.",1490400000,,837,4.624161073825503
7541124,5,B0186VAZY0,"I laughed my kiester off watching this movie, just as I did when I read the book ... right up until the scene where Hitler serves up his new slogan, ""Make Germany Great Again.""  Then suddenly it wasn't so funny.  And this movie was made long before the American election of 2016.",1483488000,,279,4.346153846153846

7541130,1,B0186VAZY0,"First, I've read the book and listened to the audio book. They were both extremely entertaining and thought provoking about the nature of society, mainstream media, social media, and historical knowledge.

This movie, however, is an almost complete trainwreck because the filmmakers, rather than working with the actual story written by Timur Vermes, changed almost everything about it, except the basic premise and title. At first I thought the changes were, while not an improvement, at least an entertaining alternative. In fact, the movie is tolerable and enjoyable right up until the end when the Social Justice Warrior in the filmmaker came out. Essentially they tried to equate modern opposition to mass third-world immigration, particularly Islamic immigration to Europe with being a Nazi. While showing images of rallies by groups like UKIP, Pegida, or EDL the Hitler character chortles about ""this is something I can work with"". This reprehensible attitude serves only to diminish the real crimes of the Nazis by asserting them as responses to the very real social and political issues people have with mass immigration, especially that of a culture hostile to all we've accomplished in terms of social diversity and advancement.",1477267200,8,1239,5.3538461538461535

7541132,5,B0186VAZY0,"I am happy to have the DVD.  The movie is terrific.  It is both a look at Germany and a look at us.  As we see in our current campaign, and as Sinclair Lewis once wrote, it can happen here.  I saw it eight times on Netflix and finally bought the DVD.  Be careful though, it is Region 2.",1475625600,5,286,3.7796610169491527
7541133,4,B0186VAZY0,"Adolf Hitler, having time-travelled from 1945, wakes up in Berlin, 2014, and is given a chance to appear in a TV comedy show. Mistaken for a method-acting comedian, he quickly gains popularity among German people, while he aims for a comeback, learning the modern political climate in Europe, using the media and social network.

Storywise, not much happens in this German film. Like Borat, Look Whos Back mixes documentary and dramatic film in telling the story of the Fhrer, who travels around Germany and meet people (often real ones, not extras hired for the film), whose reaction to the man is obviously genuine.

Directed by David Wnendt, Look Whos Back (Er ist wieder da) is a political satire that is less about the protagonist himself (played by excellent Oliver Masucci); it is more about the people surrounding him, and the German society they live in. The end result is something disturbing and funny at the same time, with people giving their thoughts on immediate social issues very frankly before the Fhrer and some occasional jokes including one hilarious parody of Downfall (by Christoph Maria Herbst, who incidentally read the original audiobook).

Perhaps that is why I thought the final act was a bit weak. Those who have already read the original book by Timur Vermes (told in a first-person perspective) may not like the changed narrative structure, especially the way the film version wraps up.

Still, Look Whos Back is worth watching for the convincing portrayal of Hitler and the content that crosses the fine line between ridiculous jokes and dead serious subject matter.",1473552000,3,1598,5.041666666666667
7541134,5,B0186VAZY0,"I have watched this film on Netflix 3 times and will purchase a DVD copy as soon as it is available in NTSC.  I read all the reviews posted to Amazon and can understand most of the viewpoints but I believe that many people failed to really understand the point of it all.  As a student of WWII for 50 years with particular focus on the 1930-45 European arena, I found the film fascinating.  Setting aside the humour, the underlying plot is quite political.  The comparison of Germany today with its immigration anxiety and lots of other problems and the Germany of the 1930s is not exact, and the economic conditions are far from similar; but there are many outlook and emotional similarities and the ""who is to blame"" is not all that different.  To me, the whole film is summarized at the end, after the credits, when Hitler says, ""I can work with this.""  As much as I had been thinking about Germany in the 1930s and Germany today, those 5 words were startling.

Further, this film is not just about Hitler and Germany; it is about the universal situation that breeds strong man governments.  there is a lesson to be learned here for all citizens of all countries.",1470873600,8,1166,4.519047619047619
7541135,5,B0186VAZY0,"Dieser Film ist wundervoll, komisch und sehr interessant, weil der dem ffentlichkeit zeigt, wie schlecht die politische und soziale Situation in Deutschland ist.

This movie is great, funny and very interesting because it shows how bad the political and social situation in Germany is.

7541136,2,B0186VAZY0,"The movie started out following the book for the most part, then it began to diverge until it became a caricature of itself. The viewer/reader knows Hitler has returned by some quirk of fate. It's a first person narrative. Those dealing with him think he is an impersonator who takes his role way too seriously. This is part of the dark joke we are let in on. The book doesn't resolve the question in the context of the story. The movie has another character discover the 'truth'. This sidelines important aspects of the novel. The movie becomes a predictable morality tale. The book is a thoughtful consideration of what might happen if such a man were to return to the 21st century. The question of his identity is simply not a focus of the book. It is the focus of the movie, in which he is fetishized, and his evils are our evils, etc. The movie makes him real, then surreal. The book is elegantly done. The movie, not so much.",1469232000,5,931,4.450292397660819
7541137,4,B0186VAZY0,"Humorous and packed with subtle historical intimations and references.  I recognize something new each time I watch through it.  To me it is a hypothesis of AH's reaction to modern Germany and Europe, should he come back to life 69 years after his demise.  Superb acting by the Hitler character Oliver Manucci - as if he made a very careful study of all of AH's mannerisms.  I would give this 5 stars but the extras - interviews, deleted scenes, etc. will not play on my Blu-Ray.  (Playstation 3)",1468800000,,496,4.590909090909091

8741656,5,B0186VAZY0,"Hitler was a monster, a madman, but there is a genius to this premise, that the leader of the Third Reich wakes up 70 years later, on the ground of the former Reich Chancellery and discovers that the Fatherland is indeed kaput, if not physically, but spiritually. Hitler wanders through a wasteland of wimpy German men,  Germans frustrated with Muslims and a country that has seemingly lost its own identity and pride.

Having served in the US Army in Germany in the 1980's, I can clearly see how much Germany has declined in this video. If you think the American male is a feminized wimp, watch this video and you will understand how the Germans have allowed a former Stasi informant to decimate the country with Muslim immigrants.

8741657,5,B0186VAZY0,"Based on the 2014 book, it was written as a comedy and social commentary.  But it chillingly predicts the rise of Donald Trump with the line, ""Make Germany great again"" and using reality TV as a springboard.  The more outrageous his statements, the more press he gets, and the more popular he becomes.  This movie is subtitled in English once you navigate the German language menu to reach it (Einstellungen means subtitles).  A must-watch for people who care about democracy and how it can be hijacked by bigots and demagogues.

The pc on the other end is more of the same crap, cannot say that, this is offensive, etc and all they do is make statements, they do not give the film a chance, much like what they do to other things and it's almost degrading.
