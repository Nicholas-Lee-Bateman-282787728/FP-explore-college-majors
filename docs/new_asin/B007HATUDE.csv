8516540,5,B007HATUDE,"If this Archbishop of Dublin had been made Pope, the Catholic Church would be totally redeemed and not another child would be molested by a Priest, and the solution would cost the Church absolutely nothing.  This simple, dedicated man
was a genius among theves and pedifiles who preferred greed of wealth and ongoing criminal acts against children.
Watch the story of how this Archbishop created absolute safety for children in all of his Parishes...without spending funds or ""collecting"" money to achieve what all Catholic Parishes should have been mandated to do.  But, instead,
the quiet gentle Archbishop of Dublin was ignored.  I have wondered that since he made the wonderful changes
In his Parishes...has the new Pope demanded that he abandoned them?  I would like to know what has happened...
Perhaps ""60 Minutes"" should return ... If they would be allowed to do that !  Check out this DVD-it is outstanding .",1406678400,,917,5.006578947368421
