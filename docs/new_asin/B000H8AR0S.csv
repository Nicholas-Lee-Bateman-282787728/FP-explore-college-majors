8137585,1,B000H8AR0S,Jesus teaches us to forgive our enemies and yet according to the Bible Hell exists for the Trinity to torture unbelievers for all eternity. Makes perfect sense. (I'm an Ex-Christian),1360195200,,182,5.1
8137586,5,B000H8AR0S,"I just watched this story on EWTN this morning with my four-year-old.  We loved it.  I purchased the DVD because I know that she will like this even in the grade school years.  The story entails Simon Peter having difficulty forgiving when people treat him rudely, as well as Jesus.  To explain to Peter how to forgive, Jesus tells a parable, which becomes the story within a story.  Every day Jesus tells us to forgive others who hurt us with words and deeds, so that we also may be forgiven.  This film illustrated forgiveness so well, that I know I really benefited watching.  This is for all Christians.  I believe it will help new believers as well.",1276905600,4,654,4.52991452991453
