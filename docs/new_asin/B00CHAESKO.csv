8581719,4,B00CHAESKO,"Well, at least on two levels: an early film by the Priceline spokesman and a novelty for being in Esperanto. Everybody should know about the history of Esperanto. I knew a Belgian lady who spoke it. I must add that she was a linguist so she knew it but I don't recall her saying she ever spoke it with anyone.

And don't forget the title: check out Wiki.  Not a great film experience but if you want to stump a Trekkie at trivia, a must have.",1389830400,,442,4.127906976744186
8581720,1,B00CHAESKO,"The copy was in a poor dubbing from Esperanto (??) with an English subtitle banner that is pasted about a third of the way up the visual field screen. I do not normally mind subtitles, but the location of the banner is distracting, disruptive, and actually  ruins the whole thing. Had I known this, I would never have bought it!",1385164800,2,328,4.466666666666667
