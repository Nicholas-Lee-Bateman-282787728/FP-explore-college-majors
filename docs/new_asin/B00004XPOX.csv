Greenwood is a 6-episode OVA about a particularly crazy boy's dormitory. However, it is more along the shoujo (girl-aimed) line. It's hilarious and fun. Volume 2 covers the making of a movie for the school festival (Here is Devilwood!) and the arrival of a ghost of a teenage girl to haunt one of the boys. Definitely start with volume 1, but if you're looking for something better than the typical so-so anime that is all over, you won't find more of a refreshing change than Greenwood.",1006732800,2,639,4.714285714285714
