8002117,5,B0000E6FNP,"This dvd contains the AROUND THE BEATLES show, The Beatles' first American concert in Washington D.C. and their 1966 concert in Japan. All are in as good quality as you would expect from film of that era.
First is the complete AROUND THE BEATLES show, which contains the same Beatles concert marketed as THE BEATLES:READY,STEADY GO:SPECIAL EDITION. It also has the Beatles doing the Shakespeare skit, which is pretty entertaining. It's fun to see them in this mode, and they are obviously having much fun. The show also contains surprisingly entertaining performances by other artists, the best of which are Long John Baldry, Millie Small(My Boy Lollypop)and P.J. Proby, who performs several songs, including a great performance of ""I Believe"", which sounds almost like Elvis Presley. There are several other performers, including Cilla Black, who later became Cilla Starr.
Next is The Washington D.C. concert. I have an old VHS of this which was sold by a company called GOODTIMES VIDEO. The quality of this dvd is just as good. We see The Beatles as they come on stage and set up their instruments. Ringo even moves his drum set around. The Beatles perform for about 20 minutes. The audio and video is decent. A great look at Beatlemania at it's beginning, with a crowd of screaming fans.
Next is the Japan concert which is pretty good quality, although the color is faded, probably  from several generations of copying.
I am not at all disappointed with this dvd. It's not the greatest quality, but it is a historical record of the greatest rock band in history.
To those who say we are disrespecting the artists by buying ""bootleg"" videos, I'm not sure this is a bootleg, because I don't know who owns the copyrights. Even if they are bootlegs, they are not being sold officially, so buying them is not taking money from the artists. We original Beatles fans will most likely be dead before LET IT BE, these concerts, or the Beatles promo videos are officially released, if they ever are. I don't know what the powers that be are waiting on. After the Anthologies were released, I thought we would see a release of all of their video material. In my 60 years, I have spent hundreds, if not thousands of dollars, on official Beatles records, cds, videos, books, etc.  If these are ever officially released, I will buy them. Until then, I'm not waiting. I will buy what I can find.",1296259200,,2383,4.753623188405797
8002118,1,B0000E6FNP,"I got the wrong item, because the image of the DVD-cover shown here is not the right one and the seller was confused too.
It shows the DVD ""The Beatles - Around the world - Platinum collection (1995) (2005 DVD) ASIN: B000EONI88"", which is the awful one (Beatles only getting off planes ..)!!

If you want to be sure of ordering the ""right One"", then order the ""The Beatles - Around the world"" DVD with the red cover.",1192579200,5,416,4.333333333333333
8002119,1,B0000E6FNP,"The other reviewers were fortunate if they received something other than what the packaging indicates. What I received was a short (10-15 minutes) collection of newsreel footage of the Beatles embarking and disembarking various aircraft at various airports around the world (heavily weighted toward Australia).  This is tedious, even for a devout fan like myself. You've been warned: This DVD is a rip-off.",1164585600,3,406,5.444444444444445
8002120,4,B0000E6FNP,"This has, in my opinion, one of the absolute BEST performances the Beatles have EVER done in front of a live audience. It kicks off with a Beatles TV special from 1964. First, the Beatles do a hilarous parody of ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"". Paul isn't that bad of an actor!

Then, you see a bunch of other stars from the UK pop scene in 1964, and finally, the Beatles play. They do versions of Twist and Shout, Roll Over Beethoven, I Wanna Be Your Man, and Long Tall Sally. Everyone of them is live except for Ringo's (which is lip-synced for some reason). They're all excellent performances - some of the best ever. Then, they do an AWESOME medley of Love Me Do, Please Please Me, From Me To You, She Loves You, and I Want To Hold Your Hand, all strung together. Finally, they finish with a live version of ""Shout"", not the one on the Anthology, but one I'd never heard. The one that goes ""You know you make me wanna shout!"". It's freaking awesome. The whole DVD is worth it for this one taping.

Then, we've got the complete Washington DC concert. It's really good quality and it's not the overdubbed one - it's the actual footage of the Beatles singing live. It also has a funny little commercial from '64 advertising the concert.

The only letdown is the last section, the Budokan concert of the Beatles playing in white suits. The colors are really washed out, almost black and white at some points. I've seen much better quality videos of this performance, so I doubt this section of the DVD is taken from a master tape. Like others have said, I've seen versions of this performance in clear, crisp color.

Other than that, this DVD is 100% worth the purchase for the TV special taped on April 28th, 1964. Buy it!",1116633600,,1719,4.430379746835443
8002121,5,B0000E6FNP,"this dvd met and possibly exceeded my expectations!  other reviewers had said the amazon description for this item was incorrect, and i took the reviewers' word for it.  i'm glad i did, because they were right!  anyway, about the dvd...sure, the film isn't very clear and the sound isn't great, but i really didn't mind.  besides the beatles' first u.s. show (most of it) and the beatles show in tokyo (1966), i loved seeing millie (of ""my boy lollipop"" fame) sing a song or two.  the other singers/bands on the ""around the beatles"" section were at least somewhat fun to watch, too. i'd definitely recommend this dvd!  (oh, it does say something about ""PAL"" on the back, but it played fine in my non-PAL dvd player! i'm guessing it was just labeled wrong.)",1108512000,,756,4.646616541353383
8002122,3,B0000E6FNP,"As usual, the beatles can rescue any inferior product from oblivion just by being on it, and that's what they have done here. First up we had the British Beatle special which really seemed like a show that they put on to help their struggling friends, I mean, who are the Vernon sisters and it's very easy to see why Millie's run of hits stopped after ""My Boy Lollypop"". Mind you, the choreography was very well done for it's time and if there was ever a band that deserved success and recognition but never got it it was ""Sounds Incorporated"".

As for the concert footage, I'm sure that there was better quality stuff they could have used, or failing that they could have shelled out some bucks and restored it. But I did like the American TV ad for the Beatle cinema concert. All in all, I'd say buy this DVD but don't pay too much for it, because it's really not worth it.",1107561600,,875,4.335365853658536
8002123,5,B0000E6FNP,"It's great to see these shows finally being officially released on DVD.  I've owned the Beatles' Washington concert onb bootleg for quite some time, and here it is officially!  Also there is a Ready Steady Go appearance, and a Japan show.  Not great quality, but still nice to have these shows officially available.
Now the bad news:  the DVD is in PAL format, which means that unless you've got a multi-format DVD player, you won't be able to play this disc.  It will play in your computer if you've got a DVD player in your computer.",1085270400,4,535,4.53125
8002124,3,B0000E6FNP,"""Description
A film by Mark Devito and Geoffrey Giulian. Here at last is the ultimate visual and cultural history of the Beatles. Packed with dozens of never before seen film clips, ultra rare photographs and exclusive interviews, John, Paul, George and Ringo come alive in this intelligent, compelling, inside glimpse into the impenetrable inner-circle of the greatest group ever. Included in this all star, international production are not only the Beatle's themselves, but other well known insiders like Lennon Intimates; Frederic Seaman and Yoko Ono. Also lending their exclusive insights are former Beatle Pete Best, The Maharishi and Eric Clapton.""
That was the description Amazon had posted when I ordered this DVD (probably still does.) I don't know what DVD that was written about, but it's certainly not this one. That's part of the good news, because I had a guess to what it really was when I ordered it.
Beatles ""Around the World"" actually contains three sections. First is what seems to be a basically complete version of the ""Around the Beatles"" TV broadcast from England. The theater sketch along with the music segments from all the artists (Cilla Black, etc.) and The Beatles music segment in pretty good quality (like the medley and Shout among many others.) This is the best quality overall of the 3 sections.
Next is the promo ad for theater showings of the first  U.S. Washington D.C. concert program, and then the program straight through until the abrupt cut durring the next to last song. All the stage rotating and banter, along with the music is included. Watchable quality here, but not the newly found tape source that Apple used a part in Anthology.
Third segment is the 1966 Tokyo ""light suits"" concert. Big surprise is the very poor video quality on this. I have seen this show look almost pristeen, as does the ""dark suits"" show that was available on Laserdisc from Japan. The audio is acceptable, wish they would have tracked down a much better copy of this show to put out.
Tacked on the end of the disc is a throw away biography and photo gallery. Now some more good news and bad. The case says this is ""region 0"" not ""1"" so anyone can use it. The case also says in very small print ""PAL."" I know this release was originally from Australia, which uses the PAL system, but I figured if it was released as a domestic item here it would be done NTSC. I have two players I can put DVDs in. The first player I tried would not play this disc. I got a couple frozen images then the disc would just hang and do nothing. The menu was one of the images, but without the controls to navigate it. Weirder part is, this is my region-free all-code player that is also supposed to handle PAL discs. My Pioneer combo Laserdisc/DVD unit played this disc fine. As far as I know, it is not supposed to handle PAL discs. Is the case wrong and the disc is actually NTSC? Or is this disc PAL like the case says and I'm lucky one of my players can handle it? Be warned, it could go either way for you too.
Rare concert material here all in one place, could have used better source tapes. Moot points if you can't get it to play at all.",1074297600,22,3148,4.561837455830389
