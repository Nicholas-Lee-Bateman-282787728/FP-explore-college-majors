I don't know if there is something wrong with me but ever since the early '70's (when I saw these episodes in b/w) I always wanted to be Steed & sleep with Mrs. Peel ! Of course I was only a pre-teen at the time so...??... Any way, this product was well worth the price. Also, I am probably the only Avengers fan that does not totally hate the 1990's movie. It was not great-but also not awful.
These episodes are typical for the series as they combine charm, wit and excellent writing & acting.",1407888000,,521,4.22

7912641,5,B00000JMQP,"Especially the classic episode, (and P.MacNee fave), ""Too Many Christmas Trees"", and the ingeniously plotted 007-ish ""Dial A Deadly Number""! Capitol, old bean!",1200787200,2,159,5.956521739130435
7912642,5,B00000JMQP,"If you relish a series like ""77 Sunset Strip,"" ""T.H.E. Cat,"" or ""MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE"" you no doubt know about the content of what you are getting. You are more likely concerned about the quality of the product. Like John might say to Emma, ""You scratch my back and I'll scratch your back. Just watch the hat please."" John and Emma are back and are here to stay via DVD technology. Being on DVD, the aesthetics about the actual episodes are not in question here. More appropriately one may ask how they look. Thank Mother because they are much better than the Sean Connery film. They look good, very good.",972000000,2,604,4.5504587155963305
