8094986,1,B000C0MT66,"Perhaps one of the worst movies ever made.  Even Kevin McCarthy and Dana Wynter, so terrific in ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers,"" and the charismatic Raymond St. Jacques can't save this trash.  And let's not leave out the gorgeous Barbara McNair, a babe of the 1960s whose talent and looks are wasted here.  Absurd plot, silly dialogue, inept direction and most astounding of all bad acting from good actors.  If this movie were Humpty Dumpty, all the King's men and all the King's horses...well, you know the rest.

Save your money.  Just watch ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" again, where good actors have good material to work with, where there's excitement and suspense, where you know that the movie makers know what they're doing.  Don't sully your memories of Kevin McCarthy and Dana Wynter by watching ""If He Hollers, Let Him Go.""  And if you haven't yet seen ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" (the terrific B&W version), buy that instead.",1356393600,2,947,4.875
8094987,4,B000C0MT66,"An innocent black man (Raymond St. Jacques) wrongly convicted of the rape and murder of a white girl (Susan Seaforth) escapes from prison. He is picked up on a country road by a man (Kevin McCarthy) who recognizes him and offers him $10,000 to murder his wife (Dana Wynter). It has the same title as the Chester Himes (COTTON COMES TO HARLEM) novel but other than the title, they have nothing in common though some sources indicate that the film is ""based"" on the novel but there's no screen credit for the Himes source material. Written, produced and directed by Charles Martin, this was one of the first wave of ""blaxploitation"" films that would soon prove very popular in the early 1970s. This effort is a passable entertainment stuffed with the usual cliches of bigoted redneck Southerners more than happy to shoot a black man on sight even if the film's ultimate message, unlike most blaxploitation films, is ""we are all brothers under the skin"". St. Jacques was a handsome and talented actor who deserved a better career but back in the day, there was only room for one black star at a time and that was Sidney Poitier. It's amusing to see Wynter and McCarthy reunited 12 years after INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS in quite different roles. With the lovely Barbara McNair (who got a lot of publicity over her nude scenes here), Arthur O'Connell, James Craig, Royal Dano, John Russell and Ann Prentiss.

The Code Red DVD curiously lacks a menu but the anamorphic wide screen (1.85) transfer is quite good.",1351555200,8,1510,4.71969696969697
8094988,1,B000C0MT66,"I bought this because I remembered seeing it when I was in the Navy...I must have been toasted when I saw the film.  Dana Wynter is beautiful, but that's about it.",1292198400,5,163,4.258064516129032
8094989,1,B000C0MT66,"I had to re-read the book,the movie doesn't have any part of the book in the film. Anyone who has read the book will be very dissapointed with the
DVD.The only thing I can think is that maybe there were 2 version's of this film, one for The USA and one for foreign countries. If you are a fan
of Chester Himes I suggest you read his works",1194912000,6,338,3.985294117647059
