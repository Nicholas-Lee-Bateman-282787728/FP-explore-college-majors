4331091,3,B004CZZZIQ,Being a big fan of western's and liking Rory Calhoun I am giving this movie a 3....mainly because it is filmed on a TV set. I can recognize a set when a movie goes between a set and out in the open or country...it is watchable but not my favorite based on the setting...SET....,1430611200,,277,4.148148148148148

4331096,3,B004CZZZIQ,"I always liked this western film.  A group of civilians and soldiers are trapped by warring Apaches in a little cul-de-sac in a canyon.  The hero (Rory Calhoun) is competent and unafraid.  Everyone depends on him, even the inexperienced cavalry soldiers.  I especially liked the teenagers he rescues.  This Columbia Classics DVD-R release is not perfect but not bad.  I am glad they included the trailer.  The picture is not as sharp and clear as I remember TV showings of this film to be, but it is still very good.  I could be wrong but I think it is also edited by 2 to 3 minutes.  Otherwise I recommend this film and this release.  It may be the only release of this film ever available.",1378857600,,691,4.456
4331097,3,B004CZZZIQ,"This was an o.k. movie for me and I like most all westerns. The acting was fair. I liked the cast. I liked the story line but not the direction that it sometimes went. For starters,the movie portrayed the U.S. Calvary as a bunch of bumbleheads. I just believe they could have done better(more indians)(better shooting),especially with the acting power of Rory Calhoun. On a scale of 1-5 the transfer is maybe a 3.5 as the whole movie is a little grainy. With that said-if you can get for the right price,its worth a watch or two..........support your favorite artists..........",1360540800,,577,4.78
8424390,4,B004CZZZIQ,"Rory Calhoun starred in this film and produced it. It is based on a story by Louis Lamoure. He is a drifter in the film, with no plans and no goals; he likes to be alone, and this is why, although he and a woman loved one another, he left her and did not marry her. While drifting in a desert, he runs across a young woman who was the sole survivor of an Apache raid. He takes her with him. They go to an enclave to hide from Apaches and find a young man there who is attracted to the young woman and she to him. Soon he runs into the very woman who he had diched. She is with a man who she has decided to marry. They also enter the enclave for protection against Apaches. Then a squadron of soldiers enter the enclave saying they are being pursued by Apaches. Then an Indian who is not an Apache enters the enclave. The soldiers say that he is being chased by soldiers for having murdered a soldier. He claims it was self-defense. The soldier tried to steal his bag of gold.
The squadron is run by a sergeant with no experience. Rory takes control. A fierce battle with the Indians follows. One of the soldiers does not want to accept Rorys leadership. He is joined by Rorys former fiancs new fianc.",1524614400,2,1200,4.15450643776824
