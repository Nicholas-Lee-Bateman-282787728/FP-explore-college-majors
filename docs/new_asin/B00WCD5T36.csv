8712877,4,B00WCD5T36,"This British film (divided into two 45 minute segments) stars Claire Goose of Waking the Dead.  She plays a young woman who saw her mother bludgeoned to death by the side of a lake.  Approximately 7 at the time, the story begins 23 years later when CGs character, Jane, sees her mothers murderer in a hospital.  He is an oncologist with decades of service in the NHS, who has been honored by the Queen.

Jane, unfortunately, has been put on antidepressants and has had earlier episodes in her life when she thought that she had seen her mothers killer.  Thus, her father and her husband are skeptical and they are worried that Janes impending crusade against the alleged killer will be a fools errand in which Jane and her family will suffer when they should simply be getting on with their lives.

Jane (like her mother at the time of her death) is pregnant with her second child and has stopped taking her medication, lest she hurt the unborn child.  At the same time, going off of those meds can result in a series of side effects which can include mental confusion.  Perhaps the father and husband are right?

Simultaneously, the police officer who investigated the original case (played by Pippa Haywood) has been made redundant by the force and is being bullied by her commanding officer.  If she could reopen and then close this case she would not only help and support Jane; she would also achieve some personal redemption and perhaps even get her job back.

(Spoiler alert)  While the shows title suggests the outcome (Janes claim is now undeniable), there is a problem.  Blood found at the original crime scene (that was not Janes mothers) does not match the DNA of the suspects.  And yet his guilt is undeniable.  How so?

Hence we have a psychological thriller with some interesting points of forensic science.  The acting is quite good, the local atmospherics exceptional.  The problem is that one key aspect of the plot (motive) remains unresolved at the end.  We needed an additional scene or scenes in order to achieve the degree of satisfaction that any audience could be expected to desire.

Note that this disc will not play on standard American dvd players.  I recommend an all-regions player; we have two made by Pioneer and have been very happy with them.  Costing in the range of $100 they permit you to not only buy British material; they enable you to comparison-shop between Amazon.com and Amazon.co.uk when materials are released in both countries.  Sometimes the price differentials are significant.",1435190400,,2527,4.798611111111111
8712878,4,B00WCD5T36,"Two episode UK mini series is pretty decent viewing revolving around a little girl (Jane) finding a man standing in their spot at a remote lake, with a bloody rock in his hand, that he just used to bash in the skull of her pregnant mother.  Twenty five years later Jane has a daughter the same age she was, and is pregnant with her own second child.  Shes stopped taking her meds and during a visit to her local small town hospital, she freaks out upon seeing a doctor in the hall way.  Shortly after she goes to the police and tells them he is the man who killed her mother.  Factor after factor emerge to discredit her claims starting with the fact that this isn't the first time shes accused an innocent man of being her mothers killer.  Her obsession that he is the killer with the mounting evidence against this being the case puts huge pressure on her own family as well as the accuseds ones.  Who did kill her mother and why?

Thats the main problem, we find the answer to the first question but the second isn't even tackled.  We finish not knowing why the mother was murdered, why Jane wasn't killed at the time or any motive to do with the whole thing. Perhaps a third episode was needed.  As is combined the two episodes go for around an hour and a half.  Although Claire Goose does a good job playing the unlikeable Jane, she doesnt look like the little girl who played Jane 25 years before though.",1430611200,,1410,4.326996197718631
