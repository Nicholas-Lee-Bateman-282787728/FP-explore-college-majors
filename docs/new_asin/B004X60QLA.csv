8446094,4,B004X60QLA,"Three hillbillies (Monroe, Benny, and Ezra) live in an open hut and on the ground in the middle of nowhere in the forest. When they awake one day, they find a sign that says a park is going to built on their area. After hearing some construction work, they go to investigate and find that their land is being torn apart to build the park. In a funny scene, one of the hillbillies lets out a memorable funny scream as a guy is cutting down a tree. The hillbillies return later and attack a guy on a bulldozer. One of them takes over the machine which results in an accident that kills the construction worker. Now the once peaceful hillbillies become violent and begin attacking those who intrude on their territory.

This film has a great 70s look and feel; it's a trashy drive-in 70s flick for fans. Whether or not the directing is any good might depend on your taste for low-budget 70s exploitation drive-in type flicks. I really liked the woodland scenery that at times also provided some nice atmosphere, and I personally really liked the directing. However, this is only recommended for 70s trash fanatics; even some of those 70s trash fans might not like it. Those parts when they encounter those construction workers and when that guy gets killed with the bulldozer happens earlier on in the film, like within the first 20 minutes. After this, you'll have to wait a long time before the violence and sleaze starts. Over an hour into the film, there's a really dirty and sleazy rape scene when the woman begins struggling but then submits and enjoys the assault. She then gets herself together, shoots one of the hillbillies, and then has her throat cut in one of the most bloodless and unconvincing throat slashing FX scenes I've seen. After those hillbillies kill her and her husband, they go after another couple which results in some unconvincing violence that's very low on blood. The severe lack of gore in the film surprised me; I was expecting the film to be much gorier. There's not even a single decent gore scene in the entire film! As for the nudity, there's a little topless nudity during a flashback, a topless sex scene in the water, and that rape scene has some topless nudity. One of the main reasons I gave it four stars is because I really liked the films 70s style of filmmaking, but for many people that won't be enough. That gap between the construction worker being killed and that rape scene is long and some may be bored. This gap that may be considered really slow to some people has stuff like a guy being robbed, some flashbacks, some character development, and you get a look at the films scenery.

TOMCATS is the extra film on the DVD. There's a very violent rape scene in the beginning of the movie and this is followed a little later by another violent rape scene when another girl is killed. The brother of that girl then begins killing those thugs in boring and unimaginative ways where you don't see any good gore; the lack of gore in this film is also disappointing. The director did a good job at making you dislike those characters, but it falls apart once the revenge starts. This film has various nude scenes, but it has no interesting scenery or atmosphere. The quality on this movie is poor; it looks like they used an old VHS tape. I didn't like the film that much, but some people might like it. GOD'S BLOODY ACRE is from a worn film print with plenty of marks and scratches, but I thought this gave it a great drive-in 70s feel. The picture quality on this doesn't look fantastic, but I thought it looked good for a really cheap and obscure trash film from the 70s.",1376352000,,3616,4.527522935779817
8446095,5,B004X60QLA,I love Code Red DVDs because they release the film's most other companies wouldn't` touch. I love exploitation films from the 1970's and you can't go wrong with this one. Two rare film's on one disc. Who could ask for more? Get it before the price goes through the roof like most Code Red DVDs.,1364860800,,294,4.363636363636363
8446096,3,B004X60QLA,"This is a big overrated piece of crap. I have a high tolerance for bad movies (I am even a fan of b movies), but this....

The transfer is that of poor VHS quality, which I wouldn't mind if the movie was good. It is in widescreen format. Even Code Red included a disclaimer about the quality & the source material at the beginning of the film.

In one of the included interviews, Wayne Crawford (co-writer & one of the actors) said this movie stinks & is sorry that we bought it, AND hopes there is a return policy.

The bonus movie included on the disc ""Tomcats"" is a better movie, though the picture & sound are worse than God's Bloody Acre. This one is in fullscreen.

Even though Tomcats is a far better movie, it does not save this dvd release or justify the price. I would only recommend buying this if you are a fan of God's Bloody Acre.

The 3 stars is for the packaging & the bonus movie ""Tomcats"".",1312070400,8,907,4.219653179190751
