4081151,5,B0037BBKXU,"I saw this film with my husband at a film festival.  It was riveting from start to finish.  The actual footage of Robert Kennedy speaking on this day in history is not long, but those who tell the story have done an artful job of setting the stage, pulling out incredible interviews, and adding stills and video that expand and increase the important information and challenge that goes with what occurred in the actual moment of the speech.  I was inspired; the ripple has touched my life and I pray it will be far-reaching.",1272499200,10,525,4.5638297872340425
4081152,5,B0037BBKXU,"This documentary is insightful, well-directed, and filled with first hand interviews and film clips.  Its focus is the remarkable speech that RFK delivered in Indianapolis immediately following the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.  As one of the more extraordinary speeches in the history of American politics and political leaders, the directors shape its context by using interviews with individuals who heard the speech, advisors to RFK, reporters, and friends.  It becomes immediately clear how different and perhaps better a place American might be now, morally and ethically, had he not also been cut down by an assassin.  More important, however, is that his words are still very resonant and meaningful today.  The honesty, truth, respect, and dignity with which he addressed a crowd of agitated people on that night in Indianapolis and calmed every last one of them, is not only a testament to the message he delivered, but also demonstrates that every individual -- no matter how meager his or her circumstances or how little his or her education -- can be addressed in the most noble of terms and in the most noble manner.",1389744000,,1140,5.074866310160428
4081153,5,B0037BBKXU,"As a rabid fan of RFK, I was knowledgeable about the event this documentary portrays, and I remember when it happened. However, ""Ripple Of Hope"" presents this haunting story in a brand new light, not only explaining the history, and showing the actual video of that night RFK spoke in Indianapolis and let the crowd know for the first time that MLK had been assasinated, but bringing it all home in the end with the memorial in the city where it happened.
A great testimonial to Bobby Kennedy, Dr. King, and the night that will bind them together in immortality.",1386547200,,562,4.63
4081154,5,B0037BBKXU,"I was 20 years old when Martin Luther King and Robert F. Kennedy were assassinated.  I couldn't believe what was happening in our country and I hadn't known about Robert Kennedy's appearance in Indianapolis on April 4, 1968 until recently.  What a tragic day and a tragic time.  The documentary focuses on his campaign appearance in Indianapolis that day.  The interviews of people involved in his campaign were very interesting, the footage of his speech brought me to tears and my respect for Robert Kennedy grew immensely. Oh, what might have been.",1385769600,,551,4.956521739130435
4081155,5,B0037BBKXU,"""A Ripple of Hope"" is a class favorite. I use it in my American History II class at an Indianapolis community college and it always provokes a discussion from students.  I recommend it for teachers and I also recommend it for anyone interested in the Civil Rights, Indianapolis history, or RFK.",1374192000,,294,4.764705882352941
4081156,5,B0037BBKXU,I had seen this documentary on PBS a couple of times and wanted a copy for my personal history library.  Glad to finally have it and highly recommend it to anyone who admires these two giants of human equality and civil rights.,1370131200,3,227,4.404761904761905
4081157,5,B0037BBKXU,"My students were surprised to learn about this event in history, and RFK's speech is a highwater mark in rhetoric and politics.",1360972800,2,127,4.818181818181818
4081158,5,B0037BBKXU,"One of the best, if not the best, documentary about Senator Robert Kennedy's role in keeping Indianapolis riot-free on the night that Martin Luther King, Jr. was assassinated.  No other major inner- city with a large African American population was as peaceful.  Especially liked the job the production crew did in finding and interviewing citizens who were there rather than using second hand statements.
Should be seen by students from middle school through college.",1360540800,2,468,5.3108108108108105
4081159,5,B0037BBKXU,"We are so used to our politicians saying and doing things for their own advancement that it is incomprehensible these days that a speech like the one Robert Kennedy gave to a poor, black, inner city audience could even happen.  Whenever I forget that ""life is short and time is precious"", which can happen often in today's world, I will watch this again and realize that there really was someone who spoke healing words and had courage and toughness, but who lived by the Greek poetry he quoted here...""to tame the savageness of man and make gentle the life of this world"".",1358553600,2,573,4.617647058823529
4081160,5,B0037BBKXU,"I knew very little of Robert Kennedy's life, and this film really brought to the forefront Robert's humanity, and compassion.  Perhaps his words, his thoughts, and actions, have been over looked because of his brother's great shadow, but Robert Kennedy's compassion should linger behind no shadow.  He is a mighty oak as well.",1346112000,2,326,5.132075471698113
4081161,5,B0037BBKXU,Fast service on a quality dvd featuring RFK's image and inspiration for people in 1968. Well put together dvd. memorable.,1274832000,2,121,5.1
8390460,5,B0037BBKXU,Very moving account of how RFK presented the assassination of MLK by a white man to a black gathering in Indianapolis that had not heard the news. The people quietly dispersed. No agitation or rioting in that city. Tragically RFK was himself assassinated little over two months after the event.,1513123200,,294,4.9
8390461,5,B0037BBKXU,Excellent product and excellent service.,1508112000,,40,7.2

8390464,4,B0037BBKXU,"This is truly one of the most absolute documentaries I seen so far in my life. It's real strong, educative, informative, and real true from the heart. 1968 was truly a hard and tough year for the lives being taken from both men who were full of hope, courage and faith (e.g. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr and Senator Robert F. Kennedy)

Big thanks to the people who came forward and spoke their hearts out how it all went down and everything.

This is a don't miss if you want to know the truth. This will change your life plus have teared up and stuff.",1405296000,,550,4.228571428571429
8390465,5,B0037BBKXU,"This program is superb on several levels.  It is artfully and effectively crafted and the message is immensely important.
Thank you!",1392854400,,132,5.285714285714286
8390466,5,B0037BBKXU,This is very inspirational and uplifting. RFK was an amazing person and the world missed out on an opportunity of a lifetime by losing him so young.,1392336000,,148,4.518518518518518
8390467,3,B0037BBKXU,"If you want a white washed verison of the life of RFK, this will do it.
But if you want the real story, this is not for you.

Well done, but no, not credible as his life's story.  Just the typical cry and admire video.",1391558400,,218,3.8222222222222224
8390468,5,B0037BBKXU,"I used this documentary as a source for a Rhetoric piece in one of my classes at CSULA. I found it very useful as it described RFK very well including the content, the audience, and their reaction to this influential and powerful speech he did honoring Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.

Very well done, I absolutely recommend it!",1390953600,,323,4.568965517241379
8390469,5,B0037BBKXU,This is superb.  I would recommend to anyone who cares about our country.  It could also be used in high school courses as well as college courses.,1390435200,,147,4.407407407407407
