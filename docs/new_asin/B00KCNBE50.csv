8657631,5,B00KCNBE50,This was even more amazing than I expected it to be. All the other reviews are right. It's a beautiful tale about failing and surviving. I would recommend it to anyone. It's really nice...,1455235200,,188,4.5588235294117645
8657632,1,B00KCNBE50,"This is a documentary about Jelly Boy, a clown in a freak show circus. His body is 15% burned which happened while he was a sleep. And the fire appears to be the fault of the clowns themselves, but they don't go into a lot of detail there. Smoldering blanket stupidly tossed on old clothes.. We get to see glimpses of the circus, we hear from the boring family members, especially the aunt, oh BTW they had a car accident on their way to see him. We see other people we don't know talk about how they heard about the tragedy and much of the film shows Jelly Boy in a coma with tubes up his nose.

While I don't wish a 15% body burn on anyone, but I know people with far more than that without a documentary about their amazing recovery. Unless you are family or friends of the near famous Jelly Boy, I would avoid this film, unless you just like to watch circus freaks or a guy with a tube up his nose.",1444435200,,902,4.096045197740113
8657633,5,B00KCNBE50,"The documentary is a heart-felt, emotional look into Jelly Boy's tragedy and steady recovery. I was impressed with how much compassion and feeling emanated from the screen as I watched the story unfold through biopic, first person footage accompanied with narrative provided by the brother, Matthew. It is stark reality in the most vulnerable and personable manor. I reviewed a film that Jelly Boy was featured in awhile back, ""Freakshow Apocalypse"", a film I did not enjoy but noted the honest, love given to the side-show/circus performance arts community. Now after watching ""A Clown's Recovery"" and seeing how tight, and loving that community is and the effect Jelly Boy had on his comrades, I am even more appreciative of both his and all performing artists' work and lifestyle. It is a passion and art and won that fueled Jelly Boy's recovery in magnificent detail.

Along with the second person account of Jelly Boy's journey to wellness, ""A Clown's Recovery"" gives some nice first person accounts from family and friends of Jelly Boy that pulls at the heartstrings. I wasn't sure what to expect going into this documentary but I found myself touched by the story, the performance community, and the effect that Jelly Boy had on his ""people"". There is also some cool animation graphics mixed with photographs provided some visually compelling actuality to the events and ordeal of Jelly Boy which help make this one really well produced, directed and compelling documentaries.",1431907200,2,1483,5.102880658436214
8657634,5,B00KCNBE50,"Wonderful documentary about one man's passionate soul, spirit and will to live. He survives against the odds to finish the job he was meant to do while on this planet.

He leaves the hospital AMA, after nearly dying in a house fire.  AND, within a month is back on stage doing what he loves.  Truly remarkable come-back against all odds.

This is also a great ""must watch"" for anyone struggling with drug issues.  Jelly Boy has to kick a drug dependence, he didn't ask for, nor create of his own volition. The flesh wounds were insignificant in comparison to the major damage to his lungs and all the drugs which were streaming into his body to keep him in a catonic state so the healing process could begin.

I genuflect before you Jelly Boy (~%",1421452800,2,746,4.488888888888889
8657635,4,B00KCNBE50,This isn't a big budget documentary but it's an amazing story of survival and most of all its a story of love and hope.  Please don't be deterred from watching this film simply because you think you can't relate to the persons in this film. Everyone is different but the struggle is the same.,1411689600,5,292,4.407407407407407
8657636,4,B00KCNBE50,"clownsStars : Eric Broomfield.

A Matthew Broomfield documentary about his brother Jelly Boy.

So awhile back reviewed a horror movie called FREAKSHOW APOCALYPSE  and it had unique elements of a modern sideshow and a plot.

One of the performers was Eric aka Jellyboy,Think I referred to him as SKREECH (HOTC tv) the clown,Eric is geeky and scary with his fire and sword antics.

So,A few years after that film,Eric was caught in a apartment fire three stories up including the buildings fire escape,FDNY broke down his locked door and found him crouching down in his bathtub with 15 % of his body burned and severe damage to his lungs.

Eric makes a major and fantastic recovery,Going off his prescribed meds cold turkey and is back to swallowing swords and ,Yes,Eating Fire again.

There are very famous films about clowns  The Clown Who Cried w/Jerry Lewis, IT w/Tim Curry and Greatest Show On Earth w/Jimmy Stewart. A Clowns Recovery should be added to list.",1400112000,9,962,4.858895705521473
