1982638,4,B00019G4VE,"This truly taboo-breaking film is the first from one of the Arab world's leading film critics, Ferid Boughedir. Warm, sensual and witty, it chronicles a 12-year-old boy's sexual awakening in Muslim Tunisia. Small for his age, Noura has always accompanied his mother to the ladies' Turkish baths. But now, he's not so young that his eyes don't wander to the half-naked women who ignite his imagination. Too old to spend much time with the women who have pampered him for years, he's still too young for the company of men. When released, the talk was over the way it broke new ground in Arab cinema. But with its earthy sensuality, compassion and humor, Halfaouine also became one of the most exquisitely told coming-of-age tales in recent years.",973728000,24,745,4.874015748031496

1982675,3,B00019G4VE,"I viewed this on a Kindle Fire HD 7-inch via my Amazon Prime account.

I fully expected to love this film just from the box art. That's the problem with box art -- sometimes it's better than the film.

Even so, there are some moments in this film that remind you that there are some universal issues, stuff that transcend cultures when it comes to something as common as emerging from adolescence, father-son/mother-son/male-female relationships. There were some genuinely funny (not ha ha, but you know, wink wink) moments.

From a technical standpoint, the harsh and bright lighting in some scenes reminded me that it was a movie I was watching rather than pulling me in and making me live in the moments depicted in each of the scenes.",1397088000,,738,4.75
1982676,4,B00019G4VE,"Anytime I see a foreign film logline mention artistic nudity and ""sexual awakenings,"" I'm obliged to at least check it out.  If you read the synopsis or the reviews and expected to see a lot of erotic love scenes, think again.  There are several shots of beautiful young women bearing their perky breasts, but they are almost always in the context of a Turkish bath, and accompanied by some much less attractive women's nudity kind of spoiling the mood.  The exceptions are the brief nude scenes of Leila (H&eacute;l&egrave;ne Catzaras), an ravishing jailbait orphan sent to live with the boy's family when her own family is killed in a freak lightning strike.

The movie itself, nudity notwithstanding, is a rather interesting and anecdotal glimpse of Middle Eastern life in the late 80s (with a 1990 release date, the filim was most likely made in the previous year or two).  If you have even a passing interest in studies of these sorts of cultures, this film is definitely worth a look.  It is sobering to see the patriarchal and tyrannical way of life in societies like these; people are arrested and dragged off by fascist police, and then people go back to their business.  Fathers beat and berate their wives, children and other relatives with complete impunity.

The most bizarre sequence to me was the circumcision scene; I had no idea it was even practiced, much less celebrated, outside of Hebrew culture (and American, for some odd reason).  Not only is it a part of their lives, they treat it like a christening, baptism, confirmation, bar mitzvah, wedding, Christmas day, fourth of July picnic, or some other momentous occasion.  Relatives pour in from all over, everyone dresses in finery, they have a big feast, a concert (the women have to sit silently in a separate room, of course), then commence with the barbaric mutilation ritual.  Then the guests toss money onto the tortured toddler as he huddles, still in shock, in his mother's arms.  Freaky.

There is a plot around all the ""daily life"" stuff.  The protagonist, 12-year-old Noura, wants to keep going to the women's bath house to feed his burgeoning interest in bosoms, bums and bush; it's also an opportunity for him to fit in with his slightly older pervo pals by regaling them with descriptions of local girls' anatomies.  He drifts from situation to situation, hanging with a local drunk (think Muff Potter to Tom Sawyer), running errands and doing odd jobs for pocket money, and dealing with an assortment of oddballs in his home, including a crazy spinster aunt and a ""chippie"" divorcee aunt.

Overall, many of my perceptions of Middle Eastern life were shaken, if not shattered.  This film takes place in Tunisia, which lies on the Northern coast of Africa, closer to Mediterranean culture than Arabic.  It's kind of like a mix of several cultures -- makes me want to research the area more, actually.

Although it's not for everyone, and does sometimes drag a bit, and sometimes get downright confusing, I recommend this film for a unique show of day-to-day life in a otherworldly environment, shown more-or-less through the eyes of a boy in the transition to manhood.",1395878400,2,3154,4.872659176029963

In the beginning he is allowed into the women's part of the public bath but it slowly dawns on him that he is surrounded by naked women.  A sharp-eyed attendant ultimately discerns this awakening interest and he is expelled from the women's section.

In the meantime, we see life in the streets with a shoemaker who is a frustrated artist, confirmed bachelor and incorrigible roue.  A couple of older kid buddies who are also groping for adulthood.  And the women who form an integral part of the story.  We're also let in on some of the political goings-on prior to the Arab Spring.

1982689,5,B00019G4VE,"Startlingly sensual film about a young boys sexual awakening. The scenes shot in the bathhouse look so natural ,it seems almost documentary. Almost all the men in the film are brutish or unpleasant. I didn't entirely get the director's reason for setting the film against a background of political repression that apart from beatings and arrests gets no further explanation. Most of the women are natural beauties and sometimes reminded me of the photography of Lehnert and Landrock of the 1920's. The dvd also contains a 1987 documentary on emerging Arab cinema, which is very interesting especially in light of recent events in North Africa and the Middle East.

What I liked about this movie is that:
- easy to follow
- light hearted
- funny
- foreign

1982699,3,B00019G4VE,I watched the whole film.  The end of the film was unbeliveable.  Something must has been lost in the translation or maybe the film maker just didn't have the personnel and resources nesscessary.  It is a very different world he shows us and the film is interesting for that reason.,1360540800,,282,4.6
1982700,4,B00019G4VE,"It's a great foreign film to watch at home.  It suprised me with the subtle humor regarding sexual discoveries among the main character as he is going through puberty during his adolescent years.  The writing of the film (basing myself from the available subtitles) was simplistic, sometimes corny, but the expressions conveyed enough to carry the movie through...The movie is slow-paced and quite of bit of pensive, no-dialogue, moments that could have been filled with some dialogue, e.g. the movie could have a stream-of-conscious approach to know the thoughts of the character, or to compliment his vivid stares of curiosity into women's breasts and vaginas in the many bathhouse scenes.

It's a fun movie to watch on a rainy day...I liked it.",1360454400,3,747,5.10655737704918
1982701,4,B00019G4VE,"I liked this film but was somethwat confused by it. I don't speak Arabic and was unable to understand some of the action and probably quite a bit of the subtext. Some of the boy's experiences seemed almost universal- e.g., what 12 year old boy wouldn't enjoy oogling nekkid women under the guise of being ""still a baby himself"" ? He also shares many of the ""coming of age"" experiences of kids the world over (e.g. coming to the understanding that adults are often hypocrites with double and triple standards of morality). On the other hand, some of the action seemed culture bound (by western standards the mother infantilized the boy and behaved very seductively toward him (a pre-pubescent male needs his wet half-dressed mother to wash his hair and scrub him?? By American standards- NO but maybe that is more acceptable in Tunisia*). I suspect there is a lot more to this film and I wish someone would contact me to discuss it- that would make this film even more enjoyable for me. Overall- worth a look.

SPOILER BELOW

One thing I would like to discuss is  the young servant girl- there had to be more to her story. Why on earth would she let that little Tunisian Alfred E. Neuman  touch her and look at her body? Was that the real reason the immam brought her to the house- to initiate the boy sexually? Why did the father give the immam money? Where was he taking the girl? I felt very sorry for the girl.
* - the bathhouse owner and her employee seemed to think it was strange to bring a boy that age to the baths",1359331200,,1522,4.425
1982702,5,B00019G4VE,"This is an exquisite Tunisian-French production about a boy coming of age and discovering the (adult) world of women. It has a superb depiction of daily life in Tunis, perhaps set in the 1970s or 1980s, showing the different worlds of men and women in a North African city. The film also serves as a cultural tour of daily life in the Mediterranean-Arab world of North Africa. Most charming are the scenes where the women party together and make fun of their husbands and lovers, even while they show their zest for life. One must praise the film's delicate portrayal of the coming of age of the young twelve-year old boy. Walter Ong once wrote in a classic book that the introduction to learned Latin, in the Middle Ages, separated a boy from the world of women and the home and helped him to become a man. In this film, the rupture of the child's immersion in the world of women paradoxically catapults him into his coming of age and the encounter with women as a future adult. ""Halfaouine"" is a beautiful film, a rich praise of life.",1352505600,3,1036,4.51595744680851

1982704,5,B00019G4VE,"I highly recommend it for family viewing with boys who are curious or experiencing their own sexual awakening. It was fascinating to learn that teenage boys growing up in Islamic and Judeo-Christian society experience the same curiosity about their sexual awakening and the pranks they go through.
One could see that there are the same taboos between the two cultures when it comes to sex education for children, i.e. parents or close adult kin or friends do not discuss their teenagers interest openly.
I was rather surprised that this film survive the puritanical censors of the U.S. There was a scene of a woman stroking a boy's penis in the bath house. And they showed a circumcision ceremony with a scene of a child's foreskin being pulled out and about to be cut off.
This film also gives the viewer an insight into an Arabic community that most Westerners will never experience in person. I thoroughly enjoyed the film.",1206316800,19,926,4.830188679245283
1982705,5,B00019G4VE,"This moving story gives a believeable, touching account of a Tunisian boy's coming of age. Halfaouine is the name of a popular, working-class neighbourhood of Tunis, where Noura lives. He is first introduced to us as a 13-year-old-boy  who is still in his childhood, since he spends all his time with his mother and the women of the house and neighbourhood. We are shown this in an intimate scene in which Noura's mother is removing the hair from her legs in his company, or when he is with his mother and divorced aunt while they are talking of women's things.

Noura has never paid very much attention to such every day happenings, until, prompted by his adolescent friends, he learns two things: that men do not keep company with women, and that women are fascinating creatures. However, the very same discovery of these two elementary facts means that his childhood has finished for good. Noura's last visit of the hamman in the women's time is wonderfully hilarious. He just really SEES how women are for the first time, and is duly discovered by histerically screaming women who see a man's (and not a boy's) eyes examining their bodies (he had promised his buddies an exhaustive report of this visit).

But this awakening of Noura will not be restricted to the way of looking at women. The whole neighbourhood, where he has spent all his life, and the people who are around, are different now, too. He, and we through him, begins to see the importance of the reletions between people, and how what people think or say about you can affect your life in such a small place as Halfaouine, where everybody knows each other. He also discovers you can do things considered bad, provided nobody knows about it, and that anything you do in the open must be submitted to the judgement of your neighbours...or worse (as is the case with his divorced aunt or his politically rebellious neighbour), in short, he discovers that to be a grown-up you must sacrifice your innocence or suffer the consequences.

 But, all in all, being a grown-up seems promising from the vantage point of the ""terraces"" of Halfaouine, where Noura hangs out all day with his friends, and from which he studies and learns about life.

This film not only gives us an account of the coming-of-age theme, it also offers, through the extraordinary testimony of everyday life, among ordinary people in an Arab city, ample proof that the theme is universal and, as such, an apt way of uniting different cultures through something that we all share.",1099699200,56,2514,4.754587155963303
