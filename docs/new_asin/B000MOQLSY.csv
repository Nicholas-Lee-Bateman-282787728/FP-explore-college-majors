8170449,1,B000MOQLSY,I saw this tape at a friends house and was very disappointed!!  This is definitely NOT the Main Street Electrical Parade I distinctly remember.  What happened to the older original parade that opened with the Blue Fairy from Pinocchio?  This one is a fraud!  Walt himself would be appalled!!!!,1444176000,,293,4.918367346938775

8170451,4,B000MOQLSY,"I bought this as a replacement for an identical VHS tape that got broken by a curious kid.  I miss Disneyland's Main Street Electrical Parade and hope they will bring it back some day.  Until that day comes, we can still watch the video of it :).  ...and maybe we'll end up in Disney World to see the current rendition of it.

The video features a bit of behind-the-scenes shots (with all featured Disney characters and cast ""in character""), and is hosted by a live Cinderella (not the cartoon).

I wish there was a DVD quality version of this.

The only drawback (besides the general poor quality of VHS tapes) is that my kids want to go to Disneyland and see this parade!  I've tried to explain they discontinued it before they were born, but they just don't get it!",1373328000,,768,4.442857142857143
