8044815,5,B000765IJ0,"Nils takes his time to show you how to draw cartoons. He is a seasoned cartoonist, writer and teacher. Nothing is left out. He covers everything from heads to action figures. His laid back approach to drawing cartoon people, animals and everything in between, is refreshing. He even covers inking, cartooning supplies and more. He makes it look so easy, anyone can do it. His creations are done in his unique style. I highly recommend this rare, cartooning DVD. In fact I may have bought the last one available, maybe not. It was a great buy. I wish Nils had more cartooning/drawing DVDs available. There aren't that many cartooning DVDs out there. I have bought every one I could find from Blitz to Ostrom. I salute Amazon for carrying these DVDs and cartooning books as well.",1264550400,,777,4.720588235294118
