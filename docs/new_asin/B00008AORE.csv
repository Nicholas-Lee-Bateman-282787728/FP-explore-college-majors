1833313,5,B00008AORE,"This is my favorite version of Don Quixote on DVD/video. The featured dancers are from a classic era, and each gives a unique and charming performance. I don't enjoy the long, drawn out mime segments, however. Those do get silly.",1197417600,,229,4.75
1833314,5,B00008AORE,"This ballet is fun to watch! I've watched it many, many times, and I've never failed to be uplifted by this performance. It is showey, and full of life and joy. One rather unusual feature is the playing of some of the closing music during the final curtain calls. This adds much life to what is frequently a rather dull time, watching the dancers take their bows. The music adds a final sparkle that brings the whole performance to a close with verve and life. As some of the reviewers have pointed out, it may not be perfect, but it provides an evening of sheer enjoyment, and is a great way to introduce your non-ballet friends to something they may have a better than average chance of enjoying.",1156118400,18,698,4.4609375
1833315,5,B00008AORE,"The DVD version of Baryshnikov's 'Don Quixote' is a must-have for balletomanes, and even new ballet audiences. Not only does it involve the wonderful lyric side of the ballet, it also has sheer flair and virtuosity displayed in Baryshnikov & Harvey's dancing.
Cynthia Harvey is a wonderful Kitri, with her childish playfulness and flair for turns. Her characterisation is perfect and the execution of the choreography is mostly accurate. Important solos to note are: her entrance, her variation in Act One, and then her Dryad variation in Act Two. Her variation in the Grand Pas (Act Three) is a little bit tired and not always timed accurately. To a certain extent, it's the choreography to blame. The Ballerina benchmark of 32 fouettes is pulled off accurately in the finale (with Harvey rarely moving off the same point), however, Harvey does not gain much momentum and almost appears that she is dragging.
Baryshnikov, as always, is wonderful. He is a charismatic Basil, portrayed beautifully with his lyricism and virtuosity. His pirouettes and tour en'lairs are amazing, and he has added extra moves that are quasi-contemporary (which is good to see). His variations are always a delight to watch (particularly Act 3 Grand Pas). Baryshnikov set a benchmark for male dancers of his time, and although most male dancers can now pull off what he was able to do, it is all attributed back to him.
The choreography of the production is reasonably good, however, it is sometimes hyperactive and difficult to watch. The Corps are sometimes distracting with their facial expressions and constant talking. Baryshnikov's own virtuosity set the tempo for his choreography, and thus, some dancers might not have pulled it off as he had at first imagined. One disappointment was the Grand Pas de deux in Act Three. It was seldom stylish for the traditionalist, however, was still satisfying to watch.
Overall, it is a very nice ballet to have in the collection when all you want to watch is the athleticism of dancers. The choreography is good, the dancing is wonderful and the costumes/scenery is great! Buy it now!",1071964800,35,2109,5.011396011396012
1833316,5,B00008AORE,"This is my favorite ballet tape, and I look forward to having it on DVD.  I don't even know where to start in my praise, so I'll begin with the smaller parts.  Susan Jaffe and Cheryl Yeager as the dream Mercedes and Amor absolutely shine.  It is no wonder Jaffe has become a superstar.  Johan Renvall is adorable in the small part of the innkeeper's son and has a few incredible leaps.  Frank Smith has become an excellent character dancer as the innkeeper, who is Kitri's father. It was good to see Robert LaFosse in a small role as well, as he had subsequently left American Ballet Theatre for the New York City Ballet.  Unfortunately I do not remember the names of the soloists who dance Kitri's friends, but they are also quite lively.  On a sad note, the late Peter Fonseca, who died too young, sparkles in the corps and in the gypsy camp scene.  He would have been a major international star if he had lived, and I was fortunate to have seen him, Jaffe, Yeager, and Julie Kent with the Maryland Youth Ballet when they were in their teens.  Patrick Bissell, also, is a very attractive Espada.  He, too, died too young and is much missed.
In my opinion, Cynthia Harvey was a wonderful Kitri.  Not only was her dancing outstanding, but her personality shone through the role of the kittenish innkeeper's daughter who was determined to win the man she loved, even though he was merely a poor barber, and also to keep the upper hand in their marriage.  Baryshnikov exudes charm and demonstrates that he was, at that time, the world's greatest dancer.
However, for me the highlight of the ballet was Victor Barbee as the rejected suitor Gamache.  There is no better actor in all of ballet and, although he wasn't the strongest dancer in the corps, he carries the role with panache and aplomb. He receives the last curtain call, and rightly so.
Although Minkus is not the greatest ballet composer, the score is easy to listen to.  The costumes and settings are colorful and enjoyable.  There are some unanswered questions, including where Kitri changed her clothes between act 1, when she runs off with Basil, and act 2, when they arrive at the gypsy camp, as she took nothing with her!  And doesn't she notice that there is no blood on the knife Basil pretends to stab himself with?  But they can be easily overlooked.
This is a really enjoyable ballet.  I strongly advise buying it!",1052697600,69,2383,4.580188679245283

Having said that, I am deeply disappointed by the lack of program notes!!  In my opinion, there should have been a detailed listing of the many dancers that performed solos and duets and more importantly an overview of what the ballet is about.  Once I researched Don Quixote I had a greater understanding of the entire ballet.  It probably would have been time consuming to give more information about the ballet and the dancers but it would really enhance the understanding and appreciation of Don Quixote!

1833455,4,B00008AORE,"Before watching the ballet in the theater and knowing it pretty well from before I wanted to have a DVD of this beautiful ballet.
I bought this selection because it was one of the best according to the reviewers.
I found the main characters: Ketty and Basilio very good in particular the second one played by Mikhall Baryshnikov, one of the best ballet dancers of the XX Century, I enjoyed the parts that they danced very much. The rest of the cast were good but not at the same level as the couple mention before.
I found this version much shorter that the ones Ive seen before, some fragments were omitted and I noticed this because I had just seen this ballet two days before, another thing that I realized was that some duets danced by the other couple (Toreador and Micaela) were performed by the main characters in this DVD production.
The scenery and costumes are the same as the one I saw in the theater two days before I saw this DVD and I found it very beautiful.
The quality of the DVD was ok.
Even though I noticed some things that I didn't like I am glad I bought this DVD and enjoyed the great performance of Mikhall Baryshnikov of this beautiful ballet with its great music.",1403395200,5,1189,4.409090909090909

1833531,5,B00008AORE,"This thoroughly watchable contribution from the American Ballet Theatre (ABT), presented at the Metropolitan Opera House in New York City during June of 1983, not on the side, but with a good deal of ballyhoo, provides an updated production of an oft-performed standard work from the 18th century Imperial Russian dance repertoire, Don Quixote, a vibrant two act ballet enacted to the music of Ludwig Minkus, and to the established choreography of Marius Petipa and Alexander Gorsky.  The choreography here has been somewhat updated by Mikhail Baryshnikov, but yet becomes an amalgam of the traditional and the modern, with the latter having the edge to please, in front of a rather less than discriminative audience that fails to acknowledge a number of radical shifts made away from the original ballet, such as the scoring of Patrick Flynn, Australian composer.  Baryshnikov, director of the ABT and its temperamental artists, is ever impressive, and more so when one considers his dancing skills, on agreeable display during this fragmentarily recounted piece from the too often ignored Minkus.  Staging of the piece is satiny smooth, with the scenery and costumes designed by Santo Loquasto proving to be worthy in creativity for this too-seldom performed war horse that is moved effectively into contemporaneity by Baryshnikov and his troupe.  Dancing of the ensemble is a good deal more than adequate in developing synchronicity between Minkus and the various choreographic contributions from creative talents old and new.  There is substantially more to this ballet than the familiar final pas de deux chestnut, danced during the elaborate wedding festivities (the film's subtitle is ""Kitri's Wedding"").  Cynthia Harvey, one of the more mannerly members of the company, performs as Kitri, the female lead; unfortunately, her inexperience becomes a primary factor in the piece as it progresses.  Making the most of Baryshnikov's original notations is brilliant new soloist Susan Jaffe as Don Quixote's dream Mercedes.  She later became a ballet mistress for the ABT.  It is, however, Baryshnikov who determines that the Minkus Don Quixote as a ballet retains much of its original vigor.  The Latvian dancer's wondrous tours en l'air are completed with total control and, although a rather thin and uneventful storyline is not precisely stimulating through any rendition, this one of Baryshnikov is spectacularly pacy and if a viewer's interest wanes, the ABT will be shortly on board to restore audience focus from both the leader's dancing and choreography.",1349481600,2,2565,5.358208955223881
1833532,5,B00008AORE,"This is my wife and daughter's rating. I bought this as a gift for them both. My daughter is 22, and has danced classical ballet since age 3. They both love this DVD. Highly recommended.",1347408000,,186,4.3428571428571425
1833573,5,B00008AORE,"I'm somewhat disappointed by this ballet. Where is the pathos? The angst? The tragedy? This just isn't my cup of tea. But I am here to grade this performance of Don Quixote, not the ballet itself.

The dancing is superb. Cynthia Harvey is thrilling. She executes about 32 turns in
the final act with precision. Baryshnikov begins a series of turns at a fast pace and even accelerates partway through. The ensemble dancing is more synchronized then I usually see in other ballets.

The sets are magnificent. They capture the feel of Spain. The detail is amazing. The weathered colors and cracks in the wall heighten the realism.

The costumes are attractive, varied, and multicolored.

The audio and video are good on my mediocre TV.

This ballet is way too festive and lighthearted for me. The final act is a frenzy
of dancing and merrymaking. If you like that sort of thing you will love this DVD.",1336348800,3,898,4.694267515923567

1833578,5,B00008AORE,"This is the best.  If you don't have a Don Quixote (or even if you have a differenat one), this is the one to buy. It is much better than the Kirov's. Cynthia Harvery is a most delightful Kitri, Baryshnikov's acting is just as wonderful as his dancing, and they both look beautiful and believable.
 Baryshnikov's version is a lot better than some of the others. It has  humor and playfulness besides virtuosity.  And yes, I have no idea where Kitri and Basil change their clothes on the way to the second act, but I don't care because that pax de deux is the loveliest and most romantic of all. It's a lot more satisfying than all those gypsies jumping around in the Kirov's version.
I also liked the dream section, with Harvey,Yaeger and Jaffe, better than the Bolshoi's or the Kirov's

1833579,1,B00008AORE,"Call me Gullible. I read all the 5 star reviews of this DVD and bought it. I was unprepared for the result. Let me get to the chase. This one of the worst videos I have ever seen. Let's start with the best thing I can say, the sound is decent. 'Nuff said. Getting to the video is painful. First the colors are washed out. Second, this is a copy of a VHS tape, a bad VHS tape. I wouldn't doubt it if this was a multi-generation transfer. There are processing lines and halos around all the dancers. The resolution is abominable. Everything is obscured and blurred out of existence from  costume details to the dancers faces. The roses in a bouquet shown up close are smears of red in smears of green. In fact when the camera shot is pulled back to review the whole stage you won't be able to tell the dancers even have any faces or heads. Trying to enjoy or rate any performance through this gauze is virtually impossible. How anyone can review this DVD as anything above one star is beyond me. I'd rather watch the worst performance of this ballet in a clear transfer than this crap. And don't be fooled by the nice photo on the cover. The video is nothing like it. Needless to say I rate this AVOID AT ALL COSTS.",1266883200,52,1213,4.251082251082251
1833580,5,B00008AORE,"This particular ballet is what hooked me on ballet.  I had watched Swan Lake and was so bored that I fell asleep.  Swan Lake reminds me of the philosophy ""the Emperor has no clothes"".  I was ready to swear off ballet until I rented Don Quixote from my local library.  I fell in love with GOOD ballet as danced by Mikhail Baryshnikov and Cynthina Harvey.  They are magnificent.  Now it's true, I may have only felt this way because I had been renting some really lousy ballets like Swan Lake, Sleeping Beauty and Giselle danced by some not so terrific ballet dancers.

""Don Quixote""  allows for lots of solos and duos choreographed by the world's best ballet dancer at the time.  His version of Don Quixote is not one of a buffoon but a man who is mentally ill and he treats his character with great respect.  I cannot find anywhere in the ballet where Mikhail show him as a buffoon.  Sancho, yes, Don Quixote, no.  I am in fact, right now reading the original Don Quixote.  Cervantes shows Sancho as a buffoon and Don Quixote as mentally not all there.  Mikhail loves to read and it wouldn't surprise me to learn that he has read Cervantes and incorporated the personality of these two characters into his ""Don Quixote"" ballet.

If you want to see a serious ballet, then this ballet is not for you.  Mikhail makes you smile if not down right laugh at times.  This ballet IS Mikhail Baryshnikov.  He has surrounded himself with the very talented ABT ballet dancers and choreographs dances that make you go ""bravo!""  He graciously brings out the very best in them and definitely gives you the impression that he enjoys dancing with them.

Ludwig Minkus is one of my favorite composers as his music is light and humable not discordant and noisy.  I found myself wanting to dance to it instead of turning it off. I thought his music was wonderful but if you want serious, discordant music, then ""Don Quixote"" is not for you.  I recommend for you ""Cinderella"" with music by Sergei Prokofiev.  That was one horrible ballet for me.  My nerves were a mess by the time I finished listening to it.  It was very discordsnt.

To end this long review, if you like Mikhail Baryshnikov, you are going to thoroughly enjoy ""Don Quixote"".  It's Mikhail at his most talented.  It's not just his dancing which is terrific, but also his personality and artistic creation that shines.  Well worth having for your ballet collection.

Also please don't miss ""Baryshnikov Dances Sinatra"".  His apache type dance with Elaine Kudo is great.  It makes me laugh out loud every time I watch the DVD.  This DVD also contains ""Push comes to Shove"".  A ballet written for Mikhail that shows his feelings that dancing is suppose to be fun.
