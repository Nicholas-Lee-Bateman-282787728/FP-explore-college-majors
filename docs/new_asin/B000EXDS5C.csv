2542679,5,B000EXDS5C,"This 1997 HBO Stand-Up special by Damon Waynas is funny from start to finish. Damon discusses everything from O.J. Simpson, Hurricanes, the (mis)adventures of his children, sex, and even Ghandi! It's a terrific special full of laughs!",1222214400,,234,5.351351351351352
2542680,5,B000EXDS5C,"I was always aware of him throughout his career, but Damon Wayans wasn't someone who necessarily stood out with me as a comedian until I saw this special on HBO in the 90's.  It was a revelation, watching someone mastering their craft.  Wayans is in complete control the whole way through; it's amazing what he can do with just a mike + mike stand, bar stool, his physicality, and great material.  Some bits are hysterically funny, and having just seen this for the first time in many years I was pleased to see that it still holds up, I laughed as hard as I did before.  Really glad to see this finally get a DVD release, and replace my crappy VHS copy.  I always thought this belonged up there in the pantheon with Pryor, Murphy, and Rock's best comedy specials.",1204588800,,764,4.428571428571429
