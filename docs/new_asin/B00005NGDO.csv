1633898,1,B00005NGDO,Someone tell tai to go jump in a lake. Digimon is crap time 1000000000000000000000. Watch pokemon it's worth the money!,1082851200,,119,5.0
1633899,5,B00005NGDO,"The Ken saga is one of my favorite parts of all of digimon.  The emotional struggles alone are enough to pull on your heart strings.  This tape includes 4 episodes: An Old Enemy Returns, The Darkness Before Dawn, The Crest of Kindness, and (my personal favorite) Genesis of Evil.  80 minutes of must have digimon.  (No commercials.;) )",1065571200,,335,4.724137931034483
1633900,5,B00005NGDO,"People may say that being 13 and watching Digimon is 'stupid' and 'immature', I thought that as well before I had actually seen the show and lamly compared it to the over growing show, pokemon. But, of course I was wrong. It's a thick twist of a plot, Ken ABSOLUTLY AMAZING by the way; skitzophrenzic, and yet calm and cool at the same time. What's not to love of the blue haired 7th grader who's known as a genius? Eh, that's what I thought! Well if your thinking about getting this, I insist that you do! It's full of humoreous jokes, yet stays' to the strong plot of the digitestoned. >=D",1063411200,,591,4.333333333333333
1633901,5,B00005NGDO,"I started watching Digimon about the middle of season one, if only because my son watched it and we only have one television in the house.  I find it a lot more emotionally involved than Pokemon, with more emotional subtext.  Seson two was EXCELLENT, and these episodes prove it.  Watching Wormons sacrifice and Ken's transformation was a truly educational experience for my son.  Like an earlier reviewer I would love to see all the episodes involved in ""The Battle for Both Worlds"", possibly the best mini-series I have ever seen, on video or DVD.",1022284800,3,549,4.808510638297872
1633902,5,B00005NGDO,"Anybody who says Digimon Zero Two is anything but excellent deserves to be smacked.  The schizophrenic character of Ken Ichijougi is the perfect representation of misplaced identity.  These four episodes are possibly the most pivotal in that conflict, if not the entire series.  Now if Fox/Buena Vista would only release 'The Battle For Both Worlds' everything would be swell.  Or even better... how about the entire season on a collection of DVDs??? ;-)",1020211200,,454,5.178082191780822
1633903,5,B00005NGDO,"I have this video and I love it. It has one of my favorite episodes ""Genesis Of Evil"". Well it's probably my favorite because, Ken is my favorite character. ^_^ Anyway all the episodes are great. Some people hate 02 but, I think it's great and in my opinion these episodes are some of the best in the season.",1007769600,,308,4.237288135593221
1633904,5,B00005NGDO,"This video has 4 episodes on it which deal with the end of Ken, the Digimon Emperor.  In ""An Old Enemy Returns"", ""The Darkness Before Dawn"", and ""The Crest of Kindness"", the digidestined must stop Ken from destroying the Digital world.  ""Genesis of Evil"" gives the story of how Ken became the Digimon emperor.  These are great episodes and ""Genesis of Evil"" is one of the best episodes and is a very emotional one.",1003363200,2,414,4.5675675675675675

7947102,5,B00005NGDO,"This tape has my favorite episode from season 02 ''The Crest of Kindness'' where ken learns the digital monsters are not mere 1's and 0's, but they have feelings and are living beings and he has been cruel hurting them instead of being kind to them as he should have.

After learning that it isn't just a videogame world and losing Wormon(his most faithful trusty partner digimon that was always there for him), he gives up his evil ways and returns home depressed. But later returns to the digital world to find Wormon's egg, and starts to do good for all the digimon that now hate him though he already did quite some damage to the world and gave himself such a reputation for how bad he acted and how he hurt them and their friends while playing ''master of the world'' so to speak. And 3 other episodes from the 2nd season.

If your a hardcore digimon fan with a VCR you might like this, though you can't get all of 1-3 on VHS since they only released a couple videos for each. So if you just want to get one copy of each episode you may just want to look for a dvd set(unless your so hardcore you have to have both i know some people are that way).",1305417600,,1153,4.212669683257919
7947103,5,B00005NGDO,"This was my first Digimon VHS, and one of my first steps getting back into Digimon. This is Adventure 02 at its best. We find the Digidestined battling the Digimon Emperor and his new creation, Kimeramon. When all hope looks lost, a new Digi-Egg is found, and a member of the Royal Knights appears to battle this behemoth.",1197244800,,322,4.568965517241379
7947104,4,B00005NGDO,"I'm fifteen years old and have been ""into"" digimon for about six years now.

This has the best digimon tape avalible. I love the ""Digimon Emporer"" bit and I have to admit I got a bit emotional watching ""Genisis of Evil"". Parents, if you can look past the at times idiotic humor of the english dub please sit and watch it with your kids. My best friends mom did and she became rather hooked, watching it even when we weren't in the house.

If I had to pick a favorite episode it would be Genisis of Evil. Which, (as far as I'm conserned) The only digimon episode without much action. But that doesn't make it any less enjoyable. Its entire focus is on Ken (and abit on his parents dealing with having him dissapear after being gone for so long) and why he became the emporer in the first place. There is quite some depth into Ken's character making him one of Digimon's most complex (next to Kouichi and Kouji from Digimon Frontier)

However I shall warn you if you are just now buying the tape with no past knowldge of the anime, please watch some episodes on youtube or something as you will be completly lost. But if you have past knowldge of Digimon, sit back and enjoy.",1147564800,,1173,4.34703196347032
7947105,1,B00005NGDO,"Its hard to follow up from season one, before you were excited about every new episode, now it just drags on. You can predict each episode and I swear that veemon gets on my last nerve. I stopped being a pokemon fan when digimon came out, but now, I may go back to my favorite pocket monsters. Minus 4 stars if you think that digimon should just end already.",1088812800,2,358,4.202898550724638
7947106,5,B00005NGDO,"This is probaly the best out of the whole season. When season 2 came on I coulden't wait to watch every episode. It's pretty much my favorite. Anyways watch it this espically if your a really big ken fan...
Now. I just wanna say even If the name sounds like ""poke mon"" Theres a huge difference between digimon and pokemon! I used to think that too when I heard about the show but then I realized that it was for more than the name and cute little animals.
Well, I just wanted to make that point... but anyways I really liked this and it's worth the money.
Like most people say I really like the ken sage. It's very dreep and emotional. If your like 7 maybe It's just cool but when you get a bit older watch it and youll see the real meaning of the whole thing.",1088294400,4,760,4.10738255033557
7947107,5,B00005NGDO,"One of the most powerful arcs in all of Digimon and one of the many reasons I just love this show.  Ken was such a cool villain.  He managed to take any small defeat in stride and come back stronger, he was a guy you loved to hate.  Then it all came crumbling down around him - but his digimon partner loyal to the end saved him, sacrificing himself to destroy the Digimon Emperer.  I remember watching what happened in one of the episodes and I called up my best buddy and said, ""I know you don't care, but they just killed 'the character'!""
Genesis of Evil, is just beautiful.  If you're not misty when you see it the first time you'd best check your pulse.  It's good that so much of it takes place in Ken's mind, so the dubbers can get him to say anything they want.  It was treated very well.  I saw the Japanese counterpart, and I actually like the dub better.  In the dub, as young Ken approaches the Dark Ocean of evil, we hear echoes of the Digimon Emperer himself, veyr eerie, very cool.  This is not in the original Japanese.  This is a very powerful episode.  I used it to get my buddy hooked on Digimon.  ^_^  Ken being so cute helped too.",1086307200,2,1152,4.177272727272728
