5077663,5,B007CLZX3Y,"Eva Markvoort's strength of character reminds me of what great athletes possess - courage, perseverance, dedication, caring, openness. In this film I learned more than just what cystic fibrosis is, but also the importance of sharing and compassion. In parallel and on a larger stage, we as a country could do far more good; win over more worldwide hearts; be most proud, if we took some of our excessive military budget and put it into research to resolve illnesses such as CF, malaria, diarrhea that devastate populations world wide. By putting money into resolving health and medical issues; establishing health clinics; clean water sources; and so forth, then fewer such stories such as hers will need to be told in the future.",1345852800,,730,4.991803278688525
5077664,5,B007CLZX3Y,"I recently saw this documentary on TV and all I can say is that I was so touched by it that I cried.  If you haven't seen it, definitely watch it.  It is something you will never forget.",1339027200,2,186,3.8684210526315788
5077665,5,B007CLZX3Y,"65 Redroses is a must see!  It follows the life of a young woman, Eva, in her 20's, living with Cystic Fibrosis.  Faced with the challenges of this complex incurable disease, Eva lives life to the fullest.  Her mantra:  ""Love, love, love.""  Never have a seen such a honest, and touching film.  This film touched so many people's lives, giving them hope.  Eva's website, 65redroses.com, has a huge following.  Her supporters encouraged her, and her cause; organ donation.  A film you'll soon not forget.  Definately worth checking out!",1336694400,4,534,4.965909090909091
5077666,5,B007CLZX3Y,This is a very touching and inspiring movie.  Eva Markvoort was truly a brave and amazing person.  Her story inspired me to sign up to become an organ donor.,1428019200,,157,4.379310344827586
5077667,5,B007CLZX3Y,"Right up there with my two or three best (out of 100+ in my collection.) It's partly because Eva and I connected over the net (before she died five years ago this coming March 27, 4 days before her 26th birthday.) We connected through our shared love of theatre (she, acting; me, acting and lighting design) and love of teaching theatre to kids, we both did that. But what also completely enthralls me is that this film starts out as a university project for two students looking around for a documentary subject, and during filming one scene, real time, Eva suddenly gets a cell call approving her for a lung transplant operation. She loses it, is so blown away that she runs off cam to take the call, one of the codirectors runs after her with the cam and keeps rolling, Eva then zooms off the set (""set"" is really her private home) to go check in, the directors realize a miracle has just occurred, ""it's our film right there,"" they speed to the bank to lock the footage up overnight in a safe deposit box. Next, the chief cardiac surgeon wants to help them out, gets hospital permission for them to film real-time in the operating room as long as they agree to squeeze up into one corner. Result: Eva gets two years more of life, her blog goes viral, film wins three major awards at the 2009 Vancouver International Film Festival, opens nationally in Canada, she and friends watch from her hospital room.  Oprah picks it up for distribution in the USA.It will boggle you, it's better than any reality show because it IS real, no hosts, no flashing ambulance lights.  One of Eva's goals is to publicize awareness of cystic fibrosis (inherited and always fatal) and she certainly does that.  The directors open the story out beyond her, they point out the trap CF patients fall into: they are prevented from meeting each other in real life, it's too dangerous, they might infect each other with a fatal superbug and ge moret untreatable complications. And this happens at a time when each feels so alone and isolated, they need the immense healing which physical contact can bring, but they're forced to settle for cyberspace chatting. At one point, the doctors relent, Eva and one other CF sufferer are actually permitted to meet each other. And you are totally there, you don't have to have one bit of CF to be drawn into their story and be transformed by it.  One extra shows part of Eva's memorial service, seven of her actual (non-theatre) friends take the stage, yep, stage fright, but they get through reading their scene. This film presents its message that love transcends time and is much more powerful than any tragedy, and it's a message we all can open to and take comfort in.",1426204800,2,2691,4.61169102296451
5077668,5,B007CLZX3Y,"This is the single most emotional documentary that I have ever seen. Made everyone in the room cry. Some left early, as they couldn't take the sadness. But watch it for the strength of Eva. Her story is sad but her journey is remarkable and you can't help but learn from her. My son also has cystic fibrosis and it changed how I approach his disease. It is a part of who he is. He has the disease, it does NOT have him.

5077669,5,B007CLZX3Y,"This movie was absolutely amazing. I just lost a friend to CF in December, right after Christmas and seeing her battle this disease for 33 years really made this movie dear to my heart. She was a fighter just like Ava. Her name is Tia. She was told she would never had kids and she was the best mother to ever walk this planet. I pray for the people fighting CF and hope there is more work done to help these people. This was such a great movie!!!!",1420588800,3,448,4.1022727272727275
5077670,5,B007CLZX3Y,"Had a friend with a son with this...it was very true to his outcome as well, sadly. A horrid disease. But it was a lovely, intense documentary.",1415318400,,143,4.333333333333333
5077671,5,B007CLZX3Y,A true spirt from a patient of cystic fibrosis! This movie shows the true meaning of life with Cystic Fibrosis,1413763200,,110,4.55
5077672,5,B007CLZX3Y,"This is a beautifully made narrative of a very loving, emotionally strong young woman fighting Cystic Fibrosis. It tugs on the heartstrings as Eva (the young woman featured in the film) is both instantly likeable and immediately relatable for anyone who has, has had, or knows someone who has had a chronic illness. The film also does a great job of showing how different people deal with the disease by following two of her friends who also have the condition and deal with it in drastically different ways (one a bit closer to Eva, one quite a bit differently). It also illustrates why organ donation (a free gift and the ultimate level of giving of oneself) is so important and how much it means to recipient families. This is one of my favorite movies I have ever seen and I would highly recommend it if it sounds even the slightest bit interesting to you.",1413417600,,860,4.590909090909091
5077673,5,B007CLZX3Y,"Wonderfully done my Granddaughter is a CFer, this movie makes us count our blessings.  Every day is a gift and we are all in this fight together.  RIP Eva, Meg and Kana. Breathe Easy",1412294400,,182,4.323529411764706
5077674,5,B007CLZX3Y,My daughter has cystic fibrosis. Watching this have me more knowledge of what to expect. It's a horrible disease and I sympathize with everyone that has to deal with this in one way or another. We need more awareness for this disease.,1409356800,,234,4.595238095238095
5077675,5,B007CLZX3Y,"65_RedRoses is a true story of a brave, spirited, and compassionate young woman who wanted what most of us take for granted  good health in order to be able to pursue her dreams.  Eva Markvoort was such an inspiring young woman.  Evas life story and message about perseverance and the power of love will continue on to viewers of this film.  You can't help but be moved by Evas parents, sister, brother, and friends.  They went through so much, yet, demonstrated such positive resilience amidst heartbreaking setbacks.",1402790400,,518,4.908045977011494
5077676,5,B007CLZX3Y,"Eva's story is one of struggle, strength, courage, bravery and love. The emotional connection you feel between you and her during the film is unlike anything I've ever experienced watching the many documentaries I have on Netflix, which is why i had to have it. While at its core is about revealing and raising awareness of the horrible genetic disease known as Cystic Fibrosis you'll find on the way there, there is so much to life that you take for granted. This film reminds you what it is to love, to live, to breath, to be, to smile, to enjoy, to pursue your dreams and honestly changed the way i perceived life and treat others around me. The empowering woman known as Eva gives life back to yours in this documentary and may i just say it is a must watch and well worth a buy.",1400716800,2,783,4.36986301369863
5077677,5,B007CLZX3Y,"This is a very well-done documentary which took me on a roller coaster ride of emotions.  Honestly, I am amazed and inspired by Eva's love of life and determination to live it to the fullest with love and appreciation.  Puts my own problems into realistic perspective.  My heart also broke for her parents and siblings.  Honestly, I can't imagine living through an entire lifetime of this type of physical and emotional pain.  The doctor was simply amazing and it was powerful to see him down on his knees in prayer before the operation.

I'm writing this blog right after seeing the film and I'm at a loss for words.  Overwhelmed.",1400198400,,631,4.681818181818182
5077678,4,B007CLZX3Y,"This is certainly sad on the surface. People with CF pretty much live with the knowledge that they will die before middle age. This film is about one woman with CF who is in her early 20s.. and what her life is like for a couple years. Watching this definitely makes organ donation seem less abstract than just a check box on your driver's license. I'd say this is probably good for teenagers to watch, because I bet they will be able to relate to the young women in the film.... and think a little bit about how lucky some people are... and how unlucky others are.",1391299200,,565,4.289719626168225
5077679,5,B007CLZX3Y,This is a very well done documentary and it makes you fall in love with these women. I cry every time I have watched this because it is so moving. It is definitely something you should watch if you have problems with feeling bad for yourself because it makes you look at life in a completely different way.. Love is everything.,1377129600,,327,4.377049180327869
5077680,5,B007CLZX3Y,"I showed this film during the respiratory chapter in my class. I'm a nursing instructor and I am always looking for the in your face, real life look at diseases. This film was great. Eva was so courageous and helped my students see the real side of CF that no textbook can provide. They really learn what caring and compassion means.",1373760000,,333,4.475409836065574

5077682,5,B007CLZX3Y,"I rented this after reading about Eva and her story, I also have Cystic Fibrosis( the same genetic disease the girl in the movie suffers from) it really hit home and made me realize how important it is to stay on top of this illness. I normally do not like documentarys but this one is an amazing rent! it will make you laugh,cry,and see just how precious life is.",1361145600,4,364,4.2898550724637685
5077683,5,B007CLZX3Y,"I saw this documentary on OWN network and had it saved on my DVR for the longest time before I ordered it. Having a fatal lung disease myself and facing transplant at a young age, I can really relate to Eva in her journey. Despite the sad outcome, this short film educates and creates awareness of both organ donation and cystic fibrosis (CF) and is a must-watch for anyone. Get this, and maybe a few tissues as well. You won't regret it.",1356220800,,438,4.353658536585366
5077684,5,B007CLZX3Y,such an uplifting and sad story all at once.  It reminds us how short life is and the importance of being an organ donor.,1354492800,,121,4.041666666666667
5077685,5,B007CLZX3Y,"If I could put 20 stars, I would. I am a Pediatric Nurse and I have been working with a lot of Cystic Fibrosis patients. I had heard about this documentary for a while and was unable to get it until today... Let me assure you that I was not disappointed. It gave me another point of view of this horrible disease and I believe made me stronger as a nurse. Eva's story is incredibly inspiring and empowering. If you ever feel down on yourself, watch it because you will never complain again! This documentary is very well executed and shows us how courageous you have to be to battle such a condition. Thank you Eva!",1352592000,4,615,4.310344827586207

8514582,5,B007CLZX3Y,I found out I as a carrier for cystic fibrosis (my husband is not). Since then I have learned more and more about this condition. After watching this video it was an eye-opener. It is a painful condition that shortens someone's life drastically. I was sad to see that the three CF girls featured have since died from rejection of their lungs. It was an excellent and informing documentary.,1465084800,,389,4.6521739130434785
