2712385,5,B000LPS2TA,"I first saw Jim and Jamie Dutcher in action on tv and was instantly impressed by them, the risks they took, and the sacrifices they made to raise the Sawtooth pack from pups - feeding them by hand; learning to howl with them; teaching them to hunt... but, most of all, teaching them to survive on their own so they could leave them, knowing they taught them well. As an animal lover with a great soft spot for wolves, I never tire of watching this video - or anything about the Dutchers.

This world needs more people like Jim and Jamie Dutcher.",1181520000,,545,4.3431372549019605
2712386,4,B000LPS2TA,"The correct running time for this 2 documentary DVD is 183 minutes. If you get the DVD, on the back, it will say running time: 83 minutes. This is a printing error.

I bought the DVD and this is the correct time: Living with Wolves is 133 minutes or 2 hrs and 13 minutes (See ""Aspect Ratio"" - although this is given only for the first film, Living with Wolves).

Wolves at our door is 50 minutes, so this gives a total of 183 minutes. The people who printed the DVD cover made an honest error and put 83 minutes total. It should be 183 minutes total (for both documentaries).

This 2 part documentary was great, but the reason I rated it 4 stars is because the narriator made one statement that I didn't like and is not true. The remark was, ""The legs of wolves, fashioned by evolution...""  This is stupid and untrue.  Neither wolves, nor any other animal, nor human beings were brought about by evolution, but CREATED by GOD. Even Darwin who started that lie, stated on his death bed that he regretted doing so and he knew it wasn't true.",1179878400,11,1039,4.335051546391752

2712388,5,B000LPS2TA,"As a dog behavior enthusiast, I found this documentary to be one of THE best on wolf behavior.  It gives great observations on the role of the omega and enough footage for people to see and understand this role among the wolf pack.

Also suggest the book of photos from the same couple, it is a super coffee table size book of their still shots, of the beautiful animals they lived with. The dvd is super. They are a part of our heritage.",1178409600,,345,4.164179104477612
2712398,5,B000LPS2TA,This movie is great to show during your Ecology Unit. I often leave it for when I have to be out with a sub. It is interesting enough to hold the attention of 7th graders. I was sad when my copy disappeared and was happy to find it online here on Amazon.,1483228800,,254,3.9038461538461537

What the Dutchers did, taped & wrote about (Yes I have the book as well)..is inspiring!! Simply amazing, I was jealous to see the Dutchers up close & personal with the wolf pack. It is filmed beautifully & is a great addition to all my wolf books and movies.",1482278400,,369,4.0

As others have stated here, it will captivate your heart. I'm a grown man who has been smitten by these beautiful creatures and I shed tears both in happy and sad moments in the film. They carry many human traits. If you have a bond with a pet at home, you will understand. It is by far the best documentary I have ever seen. The Dutchers are extremely fortunate to have experienced all those years with those wolves. I envy them.",1457481600,,573,4.314814814814815

2712410,5,B000LPS2TA,"I would highly recommend these movies to anyone interested in the lives of Wolves. My family and I had the honor of staying in an VRBO in Gardiner, MT. In the VRBO were several Wove movies. We had the pleasure of watching these movies in the late evening. They were so wonderful that I had to order them for myself.
Living with Wolves (Discovery Channel) is a 2 DVD Set. Bonus DVD is Wolves at Our Door. What an experience Jim and Jamie Dutcher have. And I must say Thank you to them for sharing their experience's. What a brave and courageous couple they are. What an experience to raise a pack of gray wolves and document these beautiful creatures.
These movies are very educational and informative about the wolves.  I would also recommend National Geographic  Wolves A Legend Returns to Yellowstone.",1456704000,,803,4.647887323943662
2712411,3,B000LPS2TA,"I gave this three stars based on the quality of video and subject matter. To be honest, we have not had the opportunity to view the entire DVD. I am very disappointed that this DVD, produced by The Discovery Channel, lacks closed captioning. My husband is deaf; therefore, while the photography is gorgeous, this DVD is worthless to him. I usually look for the CC symbol in the product description, but I was so excited to find this title that I ordered immediately. Having recently read the book by the Dutchers (Secret Lives of Wolves), we were really looking forward to this. Disappointing, though, certainly not the fault of Amazon or the seller from whom we purchased. I have also sent an email to Discovery Channel's customer service. In this day and age, there is no excuse for the lack of captions.",1452124800,,806,4.683098591549296

The quality of the video's content in its study is commendable and captivating. The ability to educate the interested viewers, I found to be quite successful personally. This is one video that I will indulge my spirit repeatedly in viewing many times.",1437264000,,375,5.3559322033898304

2712420,5,B000LPS2TA,"Good filming of this hard to see and often misunderstood animal. I love learning what they are really all about.

2712421,5,B000LPS2TA,"It was excellent.  Shows the how they can be approached, learn to trust humans, how they too are family oriented, take care of their own and determine who is the predominant male of the whole pack.

2712425,5,B000LPS2TA,"There are two DVD's with this set. The first one is totally fabulous. The second one is shorter and while it contained some additional information, most of it duplicated some of what was on the 1st one. That being said, the cost was totally worth the price even if I only received the first DVD. I wholeheartedly recommend this for anyone who has a love and interest in wolves!",1427328000,,377,4.478260869565218
2712426,5,B000LPS2TA,"The Dutchers have contributed greatly to our modern understanding of wolves and wolf behavior, both these films bring important knowledge to the amateur naturalist.  The films are both artfully and thoughtfully produced.  We have wolves in SW Oregon now, and our interest in these magnificent beasts is now peaked...for good or for ill.  Oregon has one of the most progressive wolf plans in the country, and it is my hope that the wolf will become reestablished throughout the region in spite of the minority objections.  I'm sympathetic to struggles of the ranching and hunting communities, but I'm also a great believer in having wild places where wild creatures can thrive.  I believe it to be a measure of the health of our planet.  The Dutchers believe this too, and it is reflected in their films.",1427328000,2,803,4.911111111111111
2712427,5,B000LPS2TA,After reading the companion book by the Dutchers; I ordered this on another site and enjoyed very much.  I think I would have preferred to see the DVDs first and then the book  There was a lot of overlap material between the two DVDs but for the price it was fine.  Some have criticized them for setting up a controlled environment but it was the only way to obtain as much information as they did which in turn dispels many of the myths.  However haters won't even consider the information... getting rid of wolves is Congresses second task after passing Keystone.  At 56 enough said :(,1424822400,,587,4.5
2712428,5,B000LPS2TA,"Super video.  Gives many insights into the lives of Wolves and the social relationships within the pack, and the trust and bonds they can create with humans who are worthy of earning that trust.  Absolutely wonderful film and story.  5 Stars Plus.  One of very few films I can watch over and over and over.  Buy it.",1422835200,2,315,4.456140350877193
2712429,5,B000LPS2TA,"Excellent presentation of why wolves should stay on the Endangered Species List....I bought it to show a group of us who were meeting in protest to recent ""Derbies"" designed to shoot, trap, kill wolves and coyotes in our area. Thinking that education can cure ignorance (except in NW Montana) we appreciated the beauty and detail of the Dutchers' efforts to learn and teach about the Sawtooth Wolf Pack. This film demonstrates how to live WITH wolves in THEIR environment and OURS. It is not a ""tree hugger"", enviro-terrorist rant on the sanctity of the species, rather it is a rational approach to wildlife in our midst. Entertaining and heartfelt, beautifully shot and narrated, it is a must see for all of us concerned about the balance of nature.",1422316800,,750,4.8671875

2712433,5,B000LPS2TA,"Amazing documentaries! Both films really give a different perspective  of the world and characteristic of these  amazing animals. I  like wolves and I get really annoyed when I hear people say things based on the negative stereotype created by human  ignorance  throughout the centuries. I am glad there is scientific proof such as  these documentaries to
show that wolves are not the terrible creatures many want  people want to think of them. These DVDs actually show that they're very similar to human beings!  They are  not perfect: there are certain things in their behavior such as the way omegas are treated by the other members of the pack that if I could genetically change in them i would. Yet they also have  their good side, like  the way they take care of each other and their loyalty to each other which includes all members even the omega as well as the capability to build a strong bond with their  human caretakers based on mutual respect and trust. These documentaries show that Wolves  deserve to be protected and admired as noble creatures jus  like  any other animal in this country.
I highly recommend these two DVDs either as an addition to your collection of documentaries or to educate others  in regards  to wolves.",1420416000,,1241,4.778301886792453

2712440,5,B000LPS2TA,Loved this movie set. Very informative and interesting. A recommended purchase for education of an endangered species. Wolves are amazingly intelligent and fearful of man.,1397779200,,171,5.88
2712441,5,B000LPS2TA,THE DVD exceeded my expectations. It was avery interesting look into the pack life of wolves and the possibility of wolves and humans meeting a compromise of living arrangements rather then the existing arrangement.,1392163200,,215,5.352941176470588

2712443,5,B000LPS2TA,"I purchased these DVD's for my son for Christmas.  I am impressed with them as I own them both myself.  I watch them often, as it reveals the true life of wolves, from their being predators to having loving families and being loving parents.  Everyone needs to see these DVD's to understand the culture and life of the wolf.  Truly impressive!!  Always also impressed with the good service of Amazon.
I would recommend these DVD's to others to have it in their heart to want to protect wildlife and understand the trule life of wolves and their habitat.  Also an awesome DVD with beautiful scenery.",1387324800,,598,4.647619047619048

2712447,5,B000LPS2TA,"I had seen Wolves at Your Door years ago on Discovery and it was always
one of my favorite documentaries.

The story of the wolves being brought back to the Saw Tooth mountains,
the love story between Jim and Jamie Dutcher, the years spent living in
the Yurt just all combine to show this amazing adventure. I'm not sure why,
but I find myself tearing up a lot when I watch this show.

I shared it with my girlfriend of 2 years and it had the same affect on her.
I'm sure we'll watch this many more times through the years as it always
has a profound effect on us.

Add this to your collection, you won't be sorry. We love it!

2712450,5,B000LPS2TA,"Obviously the researchers who made this film are in favour of wolves being re-introduced to their natural territories - equally obvious is that wolves are not the crazed killers some people are making them out to be.

2712451,5,B000LPS2TA,Really an insight inrt the social structure of a wolf pack. They did not try to make pets of the wolves but let the wolves accept them on the wolves terms!!!

2712465,5,B000LPS2TA,"This is a wonderful movie and while i did not purchase it here i totally recomend it. I laughed, I cried, I saw a wolf that reminds me of a family member. It's beautiful take on wolves where they aren't the ""villians"" they're just being themselves as they should be. I understand that some people/ranchers have a problem with wolves(mainly because they are where the wolves are supposed to be)and it breaks my heart that they want to wipe out such a majestic animal with family ties much like our own. But this film removes it's self from the contriversy and studies THEM and shows us that they are more like we humans than you might think.

All in all,great show, Wolves at our door is a few snippets from Living with Wolves but still good!

2712468,4,B000LPS2TA,"I am a collector of wolf DVDs (Yeah, I'm a nerd. Some people choose drugs, I choose dogs.)and adding this to my collection was a great choice. Unlike most wolf documentaries this film is not taken from the point of view of a distant observer, instead it is taken from the perspective of the wolves' own family members. The film makers have literally raised these wolves as parents, and then once they mature the wolves are let to their own natural family life. In this film you get to see the wolves personalities and begin to understand a little bit of their psychology and highly sophisticated social structures.  The only downsides of this DVD are that the movie focuses a bit much on the lives and relationship between the film makers, and you don't see much of the wolves doing their most skillful behaviors, such as hunting, etc. Another plus of these discs is that I haven't yet watched the bonus feature, so after watching the main movie you can wait a little while and then you have a whole new movie to watch!",1317600000,23,1019,4.538043478260869

2712474,3,B000LPS2TA,"As I read these reviews, I have to wonder if the Dutchers don't have a lot of friends posting reviews here.  This is a good show, and fairly interesting, but in no way does it warrent 5 stars, especially as a documentary about wolves.  It is really more a documentary on Jim Dutcher and his experiment living with wolves in captivity.  It does contain some compelling footage of the filmaker interacting with the wolves, but there is nothing new here, save for a crazy guy ( I mean that in a good way) sharing a meal of raw meat with a pack of wolves.  This show is worth a watch, but not, in my opinion, worth owning.  If he could have acheived this living with the wolves in the wild, I'm sure I would have been supremely impressed. Unfortunately, this is a topic which is sorely lacking, as the best documentary I have ever seen on wolves (filmed in the Spanish Pyrenees) is not only not available on dvd, buy I can find no record of it.",1264204800,9,940,4.288135593220339

It was so awesome.
We had a hybred wolf many years ago and she was absolutely beautiful.",1257206400,,161,4.0625
2712476,5,B000LPS2TA,The work that Jim and Jami Dutcher did with these wolves is amazing. I think they learned more about them thatn has ever been known before. A real treasure and a joy to read.,1250035200,,174,4.147058823529412

2712478,5,B000LPS2TA,"This documentary is at once astounding and enjoyable. It provides very real, very true information about wolves. It also portrays wolves in many different ways. The film is fantastic and gripping. It is also mind opening and lovable. This is one of my favorite documentaries ever. I also highly recommend Jim and Jamie Dutcher's other works which include the following: The Sawtooth Pack (book), Wolves At Our Door (book) and a few others. :)",1242691200,,442,4.986486486486487

2712482,5,B000LPS2TA,"I caught this on television one late night when I was on vacation and loved it so much that it had to buy it and share it with my dog loving family and friends. If you aren't teary-eyed at the end you couldn't have been much interested in wolves or dogs to began with. It is intelligent, not ""reality tv"", and stunning visually. It is one of those life-changing type films for us, essentially a nature documentary with a heartwarming plot. Intelligence and heart. Lakota and Kumatz rule!",1226707200,2,487,4.545454545454546

2712484,5,B000LPS2TA,I've never seen a documentary on wolf behavior like this before.  It is truely amazing how these wolves came to trust Jim and Jamie.  The sawtooth pack was as beautiful as the mountains they were raised in.,1207785600,,206,4.54054054054054
2712485,5,B000LPS2TA,"I thought this was amazing... saw it on discovery channel and had to order it. One of the best documentaries I have seen. Jim and Jamie are awesome people. A real tear jerker for animal lovers or at least I thought, but then again it was hard for me to watch King Kong. So highly recomended.",1205539200,3,291,4.214285714285714
2712486,5,B000LPS2TA,"Breath taking documentary. I saw a lot of NG documentaries this is the first that made me feel ecstatic..
Maybe because we are so close to wolves (family ,pack etc ) or the nature of it was so good ,does not mater as a whole it is the best I have seen",1203984000,,251,3.8461538461538463

You get a great value of 2 DVD movies for a price of $10. I found the movies to be educational and enlightning about the magnificant wild wolves that were almost driven to extinction. The footage and scenery taken of the Sawtooth Ridge Mountain Range is breathtaking. It's a great movie that would be enjoyed by all ages.",1200960000,,513,6.656716417910448

2712492,5,B000LPS2TA,"I've always loved animals.  As a ""dog person"", wolves have always been close to my heart.  I've admired their intelligence, free spirit, family bonds and the fact that they mate for life.  I've read books about them and watched many documentaries.  This film has truly touched my soul.  It is an intimate portrait and allows you to peek into their daily life and witness the true nature of this amazing animal.  The second video (Wolves at our door) in this DVD set is basically a form of cliff notes, but I didn't mind watching both over and over again ;)

I wholeheartedly recommend this DVD.  It is the most beautiful documentary I've seen thus far.  It will steal your heart :)

2712493,5,B000LPS2TA,"This is one of my absolute favorites, it's a wonderful story of a couple that creates and lives with a pack of wolves.  They bring out their Yurt and set up shop in a desolate area of Idaho; the Sawtooth mountains on BLM land, and set out to do something that has never been done before.

It's a great story, it's unique and very interesting.  Normally I rate on features such as video and audio quality.  Having watched both of these two DVD's many times, I've never really paid that much attention to either of those two, the story is just that interesting.

I got this title from the local PX, it was only around $10.00, tax free.  For that price you just cannot go wrong.  But it's still a value here on Amazon at $14.00.

Highly recommended!",1187481600,3,746,4.355072463768116
