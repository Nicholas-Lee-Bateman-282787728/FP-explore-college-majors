5915258,5,B00EI3YG82,Each and every episode is absolutely charming. My 6 year old granddaughter and 3 year old grandson love all the Madeline dvds. Adults in our family enjoy watching as much as the children do. Gave this as a gift to a 4 year old who has now joined our fan club. Christopher Plummer's narration is fabulous.,1389139200,,304,4.446428571428571
5915259,5,B00EI3YG82,"This is a great collection of the original Madeline episodes for fans young and old. These episodes are based on the Madeline books, which inspired the television show. I was a fan of Madeline as a child, and still enjoy watching it today. These episodes are appropriate for viewers of all ages, and they teach important lessons for younger viewers.",1389052800,4,349,4.833333333333333
5915260,5,B00EI3YG82,"Now I don't have to worry about our dvr dying with all of our Madeline episodes, and even better we can take the stories on the road with us.  So glad that Madeline's Christmas took a diversion from the original book as the story of the magician with magic carpets did not make a lot of sense to my son, and he really likes Madame Marie.",1388448000,,337,4.106060606060606
5915261,5,B00EI3YG82,"I remember watching Madeline when I was a child and I absolutely adored it - every second of it. In fact as I grew up and the episodes on the TV became scarce I never forgot the theme song to the show and often found myself humming along to it in my head. When I discovered that these DVD's's had been released I was very quick in purchasing each one I could find - not a huge amount - 8 separate DVD's with a varying amount of episodes but hell, even having just a few is more excitement than I intended of ever being able to find. I know I am no longer a child but I love the fact that if I ever have my own child that I will now be able to share apart of my childhood that made my day every day it aired on the TV. Even so with that in mind, I am still quite content to sit down and watch these DVD's, while now they seem quite childish to me, it definitely is a childish amount of love I am happy to endure.

My 5 year old boy likes the stories too, they aren't frilly, Madeline is a brave little girl.  I love the old school values, no focus on looks, or snarky phrases.",1386028800,6,294,4.596153846153846

5915268,5,B00EI3YG82,"""In an old house in Paris
That was covered in vines
Lived twelve little girls in two straight lines.""  Madeline

My granddaughter is five, and she and I watched this film together. I remembered the book from reading it to my children. They loved the lilting rhymes, and were enchanted with Madeline. Whatever it is that makes a character attractive and endearing to children, Madeline and her author have it.

These films were wonderful. The little girl I remembered getting into some difficulties appeared. We both enjoyed the episodes, and we now have a convert with my granddaughter.  The peals of laughter from my granddaughter were so enjoyable, both of us were giggling. The characters were so appealing, and their voices so well done. We talked about the fact that Madeline lived in a boarding school in Paris, and I showed my granddaughter Paris on a map. She, of course, wants her daddy and mommy to take her to Paris.

All of the episodes had a good storyline, and we enjoyed everyone.

Recommended. prisrob 01-26-15",1422230400,2,1026,4.8342857142857145

8605587,5,B00EI3YG82,"This DVD contains original Madeline stories, each one based on one of the Madeline books by Ludwig Bemelmans.  They are:
Madeline
Madeline's Christmas
Madeline's Rescue
Madeline and the Bad Hat
Madeline and the Gypsies
Madeline in London
These are animated musicals that stick very closely to the plot of the original books.  They are narrated by Christopher Plummer.  Although I am a children's librarian for 26 years, I must have missed reading Madeline's Christmas, so I never realized that Madeline and the other girls have families.  I'd always assumed the big house was an orphanage.  These are sweet, old-fashioned stories.  However, I must admit, it's been a long time since any of my little library patrons has asked for the Madeline books.  We bought this DVD for the library, and I'm hoping it will lead some children to want to read the books.",1462233600,,855,4.937062937062937
8605588,5,B00EI3YG82,Tre bon! We really enjoy the adventures of Madeleine and her Catholic girls school. It is refreshing to see priests and nuns throughout the adventures bringing order to these young people's lives. The music is catchy and adventures very funny.
