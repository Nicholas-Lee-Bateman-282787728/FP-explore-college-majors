BUT...how else can you show a video for students to learn lab safety and keep their interest? Have a total bufoon act as a sub and the students help him stay alive for a class period...and it actually works. He lives, and your students learn! My kids remember it, and no matter how cheesy it is, they learned the lab safety rules because of Mr. Bunsen!",1507161600,,487,4.4222222222222225
8384699,2,B002LMSZQQ,Got this video to supplement of safety training program for college students. The material presented is a bit on the juvenile side. Also the presentation was not really professional. (More like a C grade movie production.) This safety video is inexpensive but did not impress. :{,1327276800,,279,5.086956521739131
