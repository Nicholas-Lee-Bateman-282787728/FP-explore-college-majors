632611,2,6303306519,"Interesting (albeit trite) concept, weak execution. Masquerades as some kind of parable about classism in the West, but ultimately offers no actual commentary. Would be much more enjoyable were it billed as a simple, fun gross-out film. The really excellent movie posters draw you in, but they ruin the twist, making the hour or so of set up pretty boring. The acting is weak but not cheesy enough to be fun. Could definitely do without the weird thread of bacchanalian incest stuff running through the story. Many plot points make absolutely no sense, and the most interesting aspects of the concept are never touched upon or explained.
Overall, a hard pass. If you want a good horror-comedy, watch Reanimator. If you want brilliant, fleshy special effects, watch John Carpenter's The Thing. If you want a horror flick with hard hitting social commentary about oppression, watch Get Out.",1513641600,2,888,5.0476190476190474

632674,2,6303306519,"SOCIETY (1989) is the tale of the Whitney family and their... lifestyle. Billy Whitney (Billy Warlock, channeling Michael J. Fox) is in therapy, feeling paranoid, suffering from apparent delusions and hallucinations. He lives in a humongous mansion in Beverly Hills w/ his seemingly perfect mom, dad, and sister. The trouble is, Billy doesn't believe his family is what they appear to be. They are certainly snobs, but Billy suspects something far worse, far darker than snobbery is going on. When he hears evidence that confirms his fears, Billy's paranoia skyrockets. Then, several events occur, causing him to believe there's a full-blown conspiracy of insanity, depravity, and murder taking place, involving more than just the members of his family! Either that, or he's simply losing his mind. The mystery deepens as the oddness increases. One night, Billy has his suspicions horribly, awfully, disgustingly fulfilled! Can anything / anyone save him from his nauseating fate? Calling this movie ""weird"" or ""bizarre"", is like calling the planet Jupiter ""big"" or ""gassy"". Director, Brian Yuzna (BRIDE OF RE-ANIMATOR, THE DENTIST 1 and 2, ) pulls out all the stoppers, letting the sickness flow freely! Is SOCIETY a social satire? Yes. Is it reprehensibly repugnant? Yes, in places. It's also absolutely absurd. The finale takes overkill to new depths, while managing to end pointlessly. Love it or loathe it, you'll never forget it. Even if you want to forget it!

632707,4,6303306519,"A minor, overlooked classic, this film should be of great interest to any fans of Brian Yuzna, Screaming Mad George, or the body horror genre in general.

The plot involves a privileged Beverly Hills teenager named Billy (Billy Warlock), who gradually realizes something is ""off"" with his family and social network at large. As Billy investigates, the body count mounts and gory surrealism creeps in. While at first the film's lackadaisical pacing begs patience, the tension - and mystery - does eventually build, and the climactic payoff is a grotesquely stunning tour de force.

As the title suggests, Society purveys some social class commentary that's about as low brow (yet enjoyable) as the political messaging in John Carpenter's They Live. And although it doesn't approach the slick intellectualism of a David Cronenberg production, the sticky-icky effects (which, let's be honest, is what we're here for) ultimately give any film from his heyday a run for it's money.

For the first hour or more, nothing happens whatsoever, and then when it finally does at the end, it is just disgusting to look at and predictable. The main character, a high school wiz kid is completely unlikeable and extraordinarily dumb, even by kitsch 80's movie standards (like when after he's assaulted and drugged by the society members at his house, he goes straight back there after his escape without having a plan, but still angrily grasping a kitchen knife - because they control the town and there are dozens of them - but you have a kitchen knife, so that will probably turn out well).

632755,5,6303306519,"I can't say I love it, but it deserves five stars. The special effects, especially in contrast with the ordinariness of the rest of the film were remarkable. When it came out, it did better in Europe than in the U.S. Bear in mind, that not so long ago, texts equated nationality and race, and there was a descending scale with blue blood at the top, ordained by god to rule. The current revival of racism and its propagation with nationalism makes this film relevant.

632795,3,6303306519,"I remember seeing the trailer for this when I was about 9 and being freaked out. Nothing is shown, only implied, but a shot of Billy Warlock biting into an apple that is filled with worms stayed with me.

Originally hacked to shreds by the BBFC on it's cinema release in the UK (a shame as it performed much better here than in the US) the full movie has now been remastered in 2k for this Blu-ray release...and you'll quickly wonder what all of the fuss is about. I know I'm somewhat desensitized in my adulthood (though cheap latex flesh wounds on Casuality still make me shudder and squirm) but you'll struggle to find anything in Society to justify the 18-rating. With barely a drop of blood to be had the film coasts as far as it can on themes and subtext. It doesn't get too far, maybe to the end of the street.

17-year-old Bill Whitney (played by 27-year-old Warlock) is a regular teenager in Beverly Hills who wants nothing more than a happy adolescence with his friends and to succeed at school. But his parents are weird, his sister is provoking unusual feelings from him, they appear to exclude him from their circle of privilege, and he begins to suspect that his well-to-do life is only surface deep and that something much, much sinister is lurking beneath the facade. His shrink suggests that he is merely feeling alienated and needlessly paranoid but when a nervous outcast reveals a secret recording he quickly realizes that it's not all in his head.

Nothing here really works. Brian Yuzna has great ideas but no clue of how to effectually execute them. The mystery is underdeveloped since there isn't much in the way of puzzle-solving or clue-hunting. The gore is almost non-existent, much to my immense dismay. I do realize that horror can be at its most effective when it is merely being suggestive or offensive but the big reveal at the end is so pedestrian and blunt that they might as well have just announced it right at the beginning of the movie (which kinda does happen thanks to the stupidly spoiler-iffic opening credits). Even during the ""shocking"" climax Yuzna shoots with that stupid pink lighting that Stuart Gordon used in abundance in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/From-Beyond/dp/B00AJXO4FA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">From Beyond</a>, which just makes the scene look dumb. Worst of all is the score, which honestly fits an episode of Chucklevision more than it does a hardcore 80s horror film with a reputation to uphold.

Crucify me if you want, but I say that Society really could do with a remake. If Cronenberg or Fincher were to redo this movie, contextually more timely and dynamic in our polarizing, and failing, society of 2017, then I have no doubt that the rotten core of Society can have more relevance now than it did in 1989. The ideas are intriguing, but Yuzna's amateurish direction and lack of focus spoil it.

The movie looks great in 1.78:1 1080p with LCPM 2.0 sound and loads of extras featuring interviews with Yuzna, Warlock (who still looks 20 years younger than his true age), other cast members, Screaming Mad George and other effects crew. A 40-minute Q&A with Yuzna is awkward to watch and listen as he repeatedly refuses to take the handheld mike from the interviewer so we have to make do with in-camera audio. The cover is reversible so you can flip to the original poster art if that disgusting new art doesn't appeal to you.",1497571200,,3437,4.8483816013628624

632931,5,6303306519,"So after a 2 year period of inactivity, choosing what film to review first was tough. So I went back to my first ever review for inspiration. At the time, I just decided to choose the last film I watched. Seems logical. So I did the same damn thing this time too. Since I watched Arrow's new release of the ooey gooey late 80's body horror classic Society last night, that one wins.

Society stars soap opera star/Baywatch stud Billy Warlock as Billy Whitney, the captain of his Beverly Hills high school's football team AND candidate for class president. Despite this, he still manages to be an outcast in both his school and home life. He even has to go see a shrink! But this isn't just a normal case of teenage blues. After Billy is warned that something is up with the towns people, those that warn him start turning up dead. But is it only in Billy's head or is the ""Society"" that surrounds him really not what they seem?

I had been looking for a decent copy of Society for a long time so when I found out that Arrow was putting it out, I was ecstatic. For those unfamiliar, Arrow Films is a long running UK DVD/Blu Ray label that FINALLY started releasing films in the US this year. And so far, their releases have been impeccable, both in quality and film selection. Society is no exception. The film itself is everything you would hope from a horror film - disgustingly gory FX (courtesy of ""surrealistic"" FX wizard Screaming Mad George) and a great, thought-provoking story. I'll admit the film has that gross late 80's big hair and bright clothes thing going on, but that just fits with the time and doesn't deter from the timeless plot of paranoia and alienation. Below is a list of details from Arrow's new Blu Ray/DVD combo out May 9th!

For me this is a 4 Star movie but the Packaging makes it a 5. Its insainly nice as the skin and eyes on the Boxset is De-bossed and Embossed.
This was a limited set and is sold out unless you want to spend a ton to buy from others. But  the Movie has released in a Standard release from Arrow Video so you still can Own this movie at a Decent price.

Society Is a Freaky, Weird, Flesh stretching of a good time. Fans of the Old Weird Horror films like Re-Animator and From Beyond will enjoy the freakyness that those films posses.

The Film Start a little slow with a Story of a family that slowly morphs into WTF. As the story rolls you began to think maybe all the visions this kid is seeing (Billy) us in his Own head, but when the end hits its not. The Ending is where we get a mass of people merging with each other with crazy looking makeup effects that you see in the 80s. The film has some gore and Nudity but I feel if they would have doubled those things the film would be better and add some more freaky things during the beginning and middle of the film.

Overall the film was a fun view with n interesting story that gets weird. The film I would say isn't for every one and Isnt as good as From the Beyond but it can hold its own. Lets not forget the Packaging. Wow is it great looking. The Box is Embossed with Skin Teeth and text that Make for a great limited edition collectors set that is a must have. Even if I thought the film was horrible (which its not) I would still buy this just for the Packaging. Great job Arrow.

Just like the Other Arrow Video Releases the Picture Quality and Sound Quality is top notch, great restoration from Arrow. Highly Recommended if you like older Horror Films like From the Beyond",1449100800,4,1957,4.609195402298851

632934,4,6303306519,"Here is another example of a classic horror film that I have always heard about, but for some reason or another had never seen!  I remember seeing the VHS for SOCIETY back when I worked at a movie rental store, and always told myself I was going to rent it and watch it, but for some reason I never did. I really wished  I would have watched this sooner, because I have been missing out on a perfect 80's horror gem for years now!

SOCIETY was directed by one of my favorite horror directors, Brian Yuzna. Mr. Yuzna directed some of my favorite horror sequels including BRIDE OF RE-ANIMATOR, BEYOND RE-ANIMATOR, and RETURN OF THE LIVING DEAD III.  SOCIETY was actually Mr. Yuzna's directorial debut.  One thing I love about movies from the 80's is their goofiness and their awesome practical effects.  This film has both of those things and is a perfect example if you wanted to show someone what horror movies from the 80's looked like.

  The movie is a little complicated and I'm still not sure I understand it completely, but that does not keep you from enjoying this film for sure.  The film is about a secret ""society"" of the rich that feeds on the poor, or at least on those they don't deem as good enough for their society.  When I say ""feed on the poor, I mean that literally in this case! What's strange is that in this film, the ""society"" is pretty much made up of every single person in the town, except for the main character Bill, his best friend Milo, and just a couple of other people.  All of Bill's family is in the ""society"" and try to get him to join, but he refuses.

  This film has an amazing climax where the secret society comes together in a huge orgy/party that must be seen to be believed.  Here is where the practical effects are really showcased with some excellent gore and body contortions.

  SOCIETY is a must see for horror fans.",1447200000,,1864,4.413489736070381

633004,4,6303306519,"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.

Believe it or not there was a time when the internet did not exist. I know, Im old. Back in those days to find out about movies coming out we actually had to watch the trailers, watch trailer tapes playing on monitors in video stores or read about new movies in various magazines. As a horror fan I was prone to reading Fangoria at that time, about the only magazine then dealing strictly with horror films. In one particular issue I read about this movie along with an accompanying picture of someone on hands and knees with a face where their posterior would normally be. My thoughts were what the heck is this and when can I see it? Sorry, I was a tad more adventurous in my viewing then and favored the unusual.

So now, after 26 years, I find myself watching SOCIETY once again as it gets the Arrow Video treatment. And with the exception of the truly outdated clothing and hair styles it holds up rather well. But then again most movies made at that time relied on leg covers, sport coats with sleeves rolled up and ever popular mullet when it came to style. You know, those things that make us cringe and yet recall fondly at the same time.

So on to SOCIETY. Billy Warlock stars as Bill Whitney, the son of a well to do family in Beverly Hills who is popular in school and running for class president. Bill is on the basketball team and dating the top cheerleader. So things must be great for him, right? Not quite. Bill feels that something weird is going on in his life and that he doesnt quite fit in with his family. This is not the usual teen angst were talking about here, this is seriously not quite the same. His psychiatrist tells him its what all teens go through and tries to befriend him to open up.

As the movie progresses we begin to wonder about Bill and if his feelings are actually true or is he delirious? One seen has him walk into his sisters bedroom to borrow some tanning lotion only to see her through the frosted glass of her shower. But she doesnt appear normal, rather her head seems on backwards and her arms are twisted around. When Bill opens the door shes normal and chastises him for opening the door.

A friend of Bills name Blanchard tries to tell him that something is amiss. Another paranoid teen? Blanchard goes so far as to break into Bills house but gets tossed out. He later contacts Bill and meets with him again, having him listen to a tape he recorded. He bugged Bills sister and the things they listen to on the tape have Bill as frightened as he is concerned. He gives the tape to his psychiatrist to listen to. Blanchard has a mishap and the doctor later plays the tape for Bill revealingnothing. What he heard is not there.

Through all of this Bill is also having girl problems. His girlfriend only sees their dating as a means of social status. Bill has also caught the eye of Clarissa (Devon DeVasquez), another high society type who eventually beds down young Bill. But even then odd things happen to make Bill wonder if hes losing his mind or not.

The movie plays with this back and forth between Bills wondering if something is actually going on or if hes merely dreaming all of these things. Characters frequently talk about the upper crust as society and Bill begins to wonder just what they mean. Is there something different about all of these high profile types or is it in his head? The theme takes on a whole new meaning before it all plays out and is entertaining, humorous and frightening all at the same time.

Most notable in the film is the special effects created by Screaming Mad George. What happens from early on with the effects he creates is something that will astound and most likely return to fill those nightmare corners of your mind late at night.

Thats not to say the movie is terrifying from start to finish. While the horror element is there the movie also includes tons of humor as well. Tie in the mystery that runs from start to finish and it makes for a fun movie, perhaps not for the faint of heart, but for die-hard horror fans youll not only want to see this but to add it to your collection.

In true Arrow Video fashion the movie comes with extras that are worth watching as well. Among the extras included are audio commentary by director Brian Yuzna, a featurette on the movie with some of the original stars back to talk about the film, a Q&A session with Yuzna at a 2014 screening of the film, an interview with Screaming Mad George, a Screaming Mad George music video and more. Theyve truly outdone themselves on the extras here.

So if you're looking for something a little different, something totally weird, something 80s, something that will aid in nightmare retention, then by all means give SOCIETY a look. Who knows, perhaps it explains why folks in Hollywood act like they do.",1438300800,3,4843,4.448703494926719

Full disclosure -- my adopted brother appears in this as Blanchard, and I first bonded with him listening to his wild behind-the-scenes stories, and how chagrined he was by the accidental plot spoiler -- oops! (Love you, Tim!) I'm not a big-time horror fan, but I got drawn into the movie too. If you like stories with a satirical or political edge (They Live, Total Recall, Candyman, The X-Files) you may enjoy this one. It's got old-school practical effects since it was made in the 1980s before CGI was really a thing -- the climactic end sequence has become legendary over the past few decades, deservedly so.

The fact that this box set includes the standard DVD and high definition Blu-Ray versions of the film, video and commentary extras and a physical copy of the comic book sequel all packaged beautifully makes this more than worth $26.

The package is absolutely spectacular. There is a lot of cool special features including a couple commentary tracks, a Q and A with Brian Yuzna, a cool interview with Mad George, and a pretty amazing music video. There is also a graphic novel that is a sequel to Society included.

This is the single piece that is the most disappointing. While the artwork isn't bad, the story is and the characters don't really match up with their personalities in the film. Even though development in the film is very shallow, it would have been nice if that carried over to the book. It also diminishes the end of the film, and probably since it's a comic book would have been better suited if it was set right after the events of the movie not at least 15 years after.",1436659200,,941,4.3107344632768365

This is a great set that bests the used DVD copies people have been trying to sell upwards of $100.

The movie itself was ahead of its time with a lot of themes and the imagery sticks with you for days. The Shunt remains one of the most gloriously revolting finales out there and the extras which feature Screaming Mad George and his practical creations are just groovy.

My only issue is that the graphic novel which comes with the movie (and is the literary sequel to Society) isn't that good due to a lot of grossly overlooked typos and poorly drawn/confusing imagery which makes reading it rather annoying. It's a decent idea for a sequel (mainly how it ends), but it also seems to try and shock with a late-game reveal for no other reason other than to try and compete with its cinematic brethren--which it really doesn't and is actually kind of unsatisfying.

Even still, this is a classic horror film and a wholly worthwhile set to invest in. I love what Arrow Video's done in reviving it and the limited edition box set is and should be an instant-buy for anyone even slightly interested.",1436227200,,1125,4.582089552238806

633143,3,6303306519,"How Society slipped past me all this time being that as a kid in the 80's I lived on Troma & Argento movies & gore classics such as Reanimator & Bad Taste is beyond me. I used to seek out movies with Screaming Mad George listed on the back of VHS tapes & I was no stranger to Brian Yuzna either. So I saw this special edition after looking it up & reading about it then bought it sight unseen. While I can't say that I still like or really seek out these types of movies anymore I do love strolling back down that viscera soaked road every now & again because unlike the later day gore movies dubbed torture porn those old movies by Stuart Gordan,Sam Raimi & Peter Jackson weren't hateful & cold they were filled with gallows humor & elaborate practical effects. Some of these movies might seem dated by comparison now but I was the right age & state of mind at the time when John Hughes & 80's aesthetics in all their synth neon glory exploded in an orgy of capitalism & I hated every inch of it then & now. Discovering these movies pre internet took work & even when I would find them at my local video store I was either too young to rent them or what I wanted was never in. I never had any friends who had any interest in these kind of movies so I was always alone in my quest to find them. I would go from store to store until someone relented & let me rent what I wanted & usually I would base my pick on the DVD box art & I would study the credits & remember names for future picks. It was a hell of a system but it was my hobby & I loved it. I know I've said zip about Society & it's because I think it's better discovered fresh & unspoiled. If any of the above sounds familiar to you & you haven't seen this then you're in for a treat. If not then you've stumbled into the wrong place & its best to just turn right back around & find something else. That's not meant to come off sounding elitist it's just that this pocket of horror is very niche in the best possible way much like polka music. Noones going to convince an average music listener that polka is really great & it's the same for Society & it's brand of horror. To me it's great but for most it's garbage & that's fine I like having this to myself without having to justify why.",1435708800,11,2250,4.047085201793722

633145,5,6303306519,"So, I had heard of this movie a long time ago but by then the original DVD of it had long since gone out of print and the only copies I could find of it were on video-tape-- and to top it off it was that weird point in history where we'd all accepted DVDs as our sole home video format and many of us, myself included, had let our VCRs fall into disrepair. That said, I didn't get to see this wonderful little film until it was delivered to my mailbox.

""Society,"" is a rare breed of two film genres: political and horror. Think along the lines of ""Bob Roberts"" meets ""Videodrome."" A strange combination, but this weird blend creates a unique vision from legendary horror producer Brian Yuzna taking the director's chair for this film. I'd give a synopsis of the plot, but if you're reading this review, chances are you already know what it's about, so I'm going to talk about the product itself and what it offers.

It comes in a very large digipak, which is nice to see-- it's wide-- and I mean WIDE for a Blu-Ray digipak. My ""Trilogy of Life"" Blu-Ray digipak from Criterion isn't as thick as this and it has some very deluxe three dimensional packaging. Inside is the digibook itself containing a Blu-Ray and identical DVD of the film and special features, there's also a miniature poster for the movie, a retrospective pamphlet and some advertisements for similar films, so that's nice to have. In addition to all of that is a small ""perfect bound"" comic book called ""Society 2: Party Animal,"" which acts as a sequel to the film (because let's face it, the ending of the movie does make you go: 'Wait, what?'), I haven't read it yet, but it seems to be pretty solid in terms of art direction, but I'm not a big graphic novel aficionado so I can't tell you too much about it.

The special features are plentiful, including a 15 minute retrospective with Brian Yuzna, a 20 minute look back with some of the actors,  a 20 minute interview with ""Mad George"" who did the makeup effects in the movie and a music video that he helped make using similar special effects to those seen in ""Society,"" and a Q&A with Brian Yuzna after a 2014 screening of the film. There's also a backstage interview with him (Yuzna) from the film's 1989 premiere and of course, what collector's edition would be complete without an audio commentary from the filmmaker himself? So that's all there.

Like I said, the movie is good. I really liked it. It's certainly not for everybody-- if you're wigged out by sex and violence this movie sort of combines them into a singular entity. I also want to add that the lead actor, Billy Warlock sounds exactly like Michael J. Fox in ""Back to the Future"" when he talks. I'm serious!

However, I do remember encountering the VHS cover at Movies & More plenty of times when I was a kid. For some reason, it just didn't appeal to me back then. Although, a lot of my current favorites were movies that I didn't think so highly of as a kid, or I bypassed altogether.

Surprisingly, the movie is very similar to the films of David Cronenberg. In some respects, I'm inclined to say it's a tad more twisted than any of his, just not as well-executed. I recommend SOCIETY. Moreover, I recommend a movie marathon that consists of SOCIETY, NAKED LUNCH, and VIDEODRME.

Speaking of NAKED LUNCH and VIDEODROME, I consider the picture quality of the Criterion Blu-ray editions to be among the best I've ever seen, and the SOCIETY transfer is in the same league.

While I appreciate special features, I rarely ever go through them. Sometimes it's best to watch a movie and wonder in amazement how an effect was achieved, instead of knowing. However, I will say that the special features are numerous and doubt anyone will complain.

633151,5,6303306519,"* I received a review copy of this film in exchange for an honest review

Ive been waiting for SOCIETY to hit Blu-ray for many years now.  I first saw the film on VHS way back in 1991, when I was a sophomore in high school, and I loved every gory minute of it.  But then it fell off the face of the Earth, and I couldn't find a copy of it anywhere.  I hoped it would not be lost to obscurity.  Thankfully, the fine folks at Arrow Video and MVD teamed up to give this classic its due, and the result is a superb Blu-ray set that should top every Must Have List for 2015.

If you have never seen this film, you are in for a visual treat.  It features practical effects that pushed the limits of technology for its day.  This is really saying something, and you will truly appreciate the effort the production team put in when you see them.  Some are just downright vomit-inducing.

SOCIETY is shot well and looks great onscreen.  This is due in part to the 2k digital transfer that director Brian Yuzna personally approved.  The HD is excellent, and the film looks like it could have been shot yesterday.  The sound is solid as well, giving us the original 2.0 uncompressed audio on the Blu-ray.  I was wondering how that would stack up to the 5.1 surround sound audiences are used to these days, but my doubts were unfounded; the sound is great and is a perfect companion to the HD picture.

The acting is top notch as well, with Billy Warlock giving a great performance as the lead.  He is supported by a slew of talent, including Patrice Jennings, who plays his sister, Jenny; Ben Slack, who portrays Dr. Cleveland; David Wiley, who shines as Judge Carter; and Ben Meyerson, who plays the jerk Ferguson.  The whole cast does a fine job of working together, and the results pay off onscreen.

The special effects in SOCIETY are superb.  Theres plenty of crazy gore to go around, too.  In fact, there are literally roomfuls of it.  Youll have to watch the film to understand what I mean, but lets just say you probably won't want to eat prior to watching the film.

SOCIETY is a major win for me, and I highly recommend it to anyone and everyone who is a fan of horror and/or gore.  This bizarre trek into the surreal will have you chuckling and cringing, and it is a good bet youll never look at the rich the same way again.",1433376000,3,2324,4.316397228637413
633242,4,6303306519,"For the record, Im penning this review specifically for Arrow Films 2015 release of Brian Yuznas SOCIETY.  If youve seen it, then you already know what a unique and inspired vision it is.  If you havent, then you do have a treat in store for you, although Ill offer this warning: be prepared to wait for it, as the real surprises don't get divulged until the flicks last reel.  And enjoy.  Always enjoy.

(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and/or characters.  If you're the type of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then Id encourage you to skip down to the last three paragraphs for my final assessment.  If, however, you're accepting of a few modest hints at things to come, then read on )

From the publicity materials: After producing Stuart Gordons hit Re-Animator, Brian Yuzna turned his hand to directing with 1989s SOCIETY, and gave birth to one of the ickiest, most original body horror shockers of all time.

SOCIETY is one of those films Ive often heard about but never seen (other than a few minutes toward the beginning that I watched online a few years back).  Its the kind of film that obviously came out of a zeitgeist for a certain time, a certain era, and I daresay that even today it probably retains more than a passing hint of the home video revolution.  That isn't an insult; rather its a compliment when a singular vision remains an uncharacteristically compelling vision still worthy of discover ten, twenty, if not thirty years later.  And  as is so often the case with what I watch these days  I may not agree with the flicks message or underlying metaphor, but that didn't stop me from enjoying the way this flick was inevitably assembled.

As for the story, SOCIETY basically takes the idea of teenage disillusionment and gives it a steroidal injection to the tenth degree.  Young Bill Whitney just doesnt seem to fit in anywhere.  Not at school.  Not at home.  Not with friends.  His parents have sent him to a psychiatrist, and even that counselor doesnt seem to understand what ails the poor boy.  Could it be that Bills paranoia is authentic?  That maybe he doesnt fit in because he isn't one of them?  Or is there an even darker secret lurking behind the shadows?

SOCIETY is one part standard teen flick, one part After School Special, and two parts of the Twilight Zone.  The script by Rick Fry and Woody Keith dabbles in all of the usual head-trip tropes, cleverly packaging the angst in good-looking lead Billy Warlock.  Granted, the narrative takes its sweet time to hash out all of one young mans existence (life at school, life at home, life at parties, and a sex life), and one could make a solid argument that not all of it makes perfect sense.  Id argue, however, that in some ways thats part of the films enduring reputation: you're allowed to make of it what you will certain elements, though once the curtain is pulled on the grand illusion youll have no doubt what to think of the greater society.

Also, SOCIETY boasts some of the slickest practical (in-camera) special effects of an era.  Its hard to heap even modest praise without spoiling some of where all of this heads, so Ill leave you with this: it tiptoes into territory not all that far from auteur David Cronenberg by way of John Hughes influence.  Those who know what that might mean may get a chuckle out of the comparison.  Those who dont?  Well, I cant think of any more apt description to pique your interest.

SOCIETY (1989) is produced by Society Productions, Inc. and Wild Street Pictures.  DVD distribution for Arrow Films rerelease is being handled by MVD Visual.  As for the technical specifications?  This is a newly remastered 2K digital transfer of the final film, and it looks and sounds pretty darn remarkable, if I don't say so myself.  Lastly, if you're looking for special features, then youll in for a real treat: the disc boasts interviews (old and new) with cast and crew along with a brand new commentary compliments of the director: seriously, theres plenty here to keep one busy for hours.  Bravo, Arrow!  Its a complete package.

RECOMMENDED.  Despite some high marks as well as some high praise, SOCIETY will not be a film for everyone.  It works for what it is  basically an extended Hollywood metaphor about how the rich feed on the poor  and theres nothing wrong with that.  Imagine what would happen if David Cronenberg and John Hughes got together with the intention of making the most bizarre After School Special one could imagine, and you get the idea.

In the interests of fairness, Im pleased to disclose that the fine folks at MVD Visual provided me with a screener copy of SOCIETY by request for the expressed purposes of completing this review; and their contribution to me in no way, shape, or form influenced my opinion of it.",1431907200,3,4859,4.683589138134593

633246,3,6303306519,"Society, a 1992 horror film actually completed in 1989, is a good example of a film that a relatively good and original idea but a delivery that unfortunately leaves much to be desired. Personally, I didn't hate this film, it actually has some genuinely creepy scenes and themes, but I feel that it was played a bit too campy, and because of this it suffered from this fate, which befell many other 1980's B-Movie horror films. That's not to say that it was all bad, as the film successfully combines social satire, mystery, and body horror all into one interesting, and dare I say it, thought provoking film. If you can look past the sub-par acting, stilted dialogue, and rather idiotic protagonist, there are actually a lot of truthful statements about class and high ""society"", and how the rich tend to feed on the poor. Well this film is essentially that statement personified. It follows a wealthy, all-american teen who was born and raised in a splendid mansion in Beverly Hills and has a seemingly good family who genuinely love and care for each other, however, at the same time, something is clearly wrong, as Billy feels as though he is different than the other members of his family, as they don't look much like him (they all have blonde and red hair and he has dark), and seem to be hiding something from him.

The first scene in the film focuses on Billy wandering around his house in the dark of night hearing whispering voices and strange movements in the seemingly empty halls and rooms, and it only gets weirder from there. Through out the whole film there's a sense of mystery and deception as Billy, along with his friend Milo, seek to uncover the truth behind ""Society"". The real terror begins when Billy's sister's weird obsessed ex-boyfriend Blanchard shows him a recording of something odd and frightening that transpired during her ""coming out party"". Suffice to say it's the complete opposite of what you would expect from the polite and dignified members of the aristocracy, so to speak. I don't know where Yuzna got his idea for this film, but I suspect it has something to do with the fact that throughout history, many members of so-called ""society"" have turned out to be cruel, monstrous human beings who engaged in much of what goes on behind closed doors in this film. Individuals like Elizabeth Bathory, the blood countess of Hungary, Gilles de Rais, notorious serial killer and member of Breton nobility, and the infamous ruler of Transylvania who inspired the fiendish Dracula himself, Vlad Dracul, or Vlad the Impaler.

It really gets you thinking. Anyway, the film itself is quite disturbing and genuinely gross and revolting at times, especially in a certain scene towards the end when the truth is finally unraveled. I gotta say, I was not expecting the big reveal that this film provided, it definitely caught me off guard, and for that, I can't help but admire Brian Yuzna and this film, even if he went a bit overboard on the gross-out scenes. Truth be told, I'm not a huge fan of Body Horror to begin with, so maybe it's because of that. Anyway, if you enjoyed films like Jacob's Ladder, Eraserhead, From Beyond, Tetsuo the Iron Man, and Parents, a similar film also completed (and released) in 1989, you should definitely check out this underrated horror classic.",1384128000,,3308,4.771378708551484

Lastly, are people really serious about the prices for this movie? $299.99?!! Are you out of your damn minds?! It's a MOVIE!

633333,4,6303306519,"Poor Bill Whitney!  He's a high school kid who lives in a marble mansion in Beverly Hills.  His family is filthy rich and super connected. When they're not buzzing around LA in the Maserati they're having the chauffeur warm up the Bentley.

Whitney is all-American, captain of the football team, soon to be President of the Student Body. With a Washington DC internship in the works and a Harvard acceptance letter in the hopper, what could be better for a teenager in love?

Everything.  Bill Whitney is going through an awkward stage: he's got to contribute to Society, after all, but he doesn't fit in.  He doesn't feel he belongs.

Worse, Whitney is convinced something is deeply, frighteningly wrong: how to explain the night terrors he has of walking through his own house, a house dark but hardly empty, the halls and rooms filled with whispers and shuffling?  How to explain his sleepwalking, only to wake huddled at the base of the stairs clutching a butcher knife?  How to fathom his surprise and revulsion when something---only for a fleeting instant---shifts beneath the ridge of his sister's shoulder blade, too sluggish for doubt, too quick for certainty?

How to dismiss his conviction that there are secrets being passed behind closed doors, deals being struck, sacraments carried out?

The rabid Brian Yuzna made his film debut with ""Society"", which takes teen angst anxiety, loads it up with cordite, and lights the fuse with a charming little message that will appeal identity-wrestling teens the world over: if you feel you're always on the outside looking in, then you could always turn yourself inside out. Literally.

Things take a turn for the worse when Whitney's schoolmate Blanchard produces a tape suggesting Whitney's sister Jenny is demonstrating considerably more than filial piety towards the folks.  Blanchard's subsequent ""death"", increasingly bizarre behavior on the part of his friends and family, and the violent death---and subsequent rosy reappearance---of a school rival suggest that something is seriously wrong with the Upper Crust of Beverly Hills, and it's not just because the rich are getting richer.

It could, however, have something to do with the rich getting hungrier.  And the more Whitney (played like a champ by eighties character actor Billy Warlock) finds out, the more it occurs to him he might end up making a far greater---and more lasting---contribution than he ever dreamed possible.

F. Scott Fitzgerald once remarked that ""the rich are different from us: they have more money"".  In less talented hands, ""Society"" might have languished as nothing more than a tedious feature-long riff on an old theme.  Not so with Yuzna, who invests it with every atom of the bloodthirsty, ferocious, and downright scary creativity that flows through his other directorial work: ""Return of the Living Dead 3"", ""The Dentist"" films, and the ""Herbert West: Re-Animator"" trilogy.

The glory of ""Society"" is that for all its perversity, the movie functions very much in the realm of quirky eighties psychological thriller, and for the bulk of its running time, there's hardly a drop of blood or a gobbet of gore.  Certainly Bill Whitney has a strained and awkward relationship with his glossy, preening, patrician parents, but at his age who doesn't?

Sure, Blanchard's tape makes it sound like something incestuous might be brewing at Chez Whitney, but it's easy to take a conversation out of context---heck, this is the eighties, the entire situation comedy lineup of the day---Three's Company, Cheers, Diff'rent Strokes---was founded on that routine!

In the meantime, ""Society"" is a stylish, severely debauched, possibly mentally insane little romp that entertains in spades.  Chiefly due to Yuzna's skill with the camera, sense of pacing, spooky use of lighting and color, and lavish set-pieces (the mansion, the car wreck), ""Society"" entertains on its own terms as a stylishly creepy horror film.

Cinematographer Rick Fichter wields one mean camera!  On its own terms, this is a lush and frankly gorgeous film, and the remastered DVD treatment makes it look like it was shot yesterday.  Fichter captures the high society ghoulishness with high style, using colored lighting in a fashion reminiscent of Dario Argento.  The acting is competent, the casting inspired: all the principals (Warlock, Patrice Jennings as Sis, the parents) work like troopers, while Ben Slack as the silver-tongued society shrink and David Wiley as the cigar-chomping Judge Carter (who has a talent for getting to the `bottom' of any problem, quite literally) steal every scene they're in.

And then, of course, Society has something of a special effects nuke up its Armani sleeve, trotted out in the final, convulsive Big Reveal: effects served up the old-fashioned way (no CGI---everything done with latex and gallons of fake blood and goop and slime), which show how Screamin' Mad George got his nickname, and which---frankly---are nothing short of jaw-dropping, sincerely repulsive, and genuinely disturbing.  Think what you'd get if you moved the hankey-pankey in the husky pens of ""The Thing"" into a Beverly Hills boudoir, then ratchet up the goop and messiness factor by a power of 100.

Jaded creature that I am, I was completely floored by the finale, where it would appear that social mobility in Beverly Hills is less about shinnying up the greasy pole than having the greasy pole do some shinnying of its own---and revealing some latex-inspired sexual positions that would have baffled (or inspired) the authors of the Kama Sutra.

Class warfare?  Not really.  In the end, as Judge Carter might say, it's all about finding your niche.

633335,5,6303306519,"I managed to stumble across this film when I went around searching for an ""intelligent film with gross-out gore"". And that's what I got when I ordered this cheap DVD. The film starts out following this 17 year old that feels alienated in his upper class home. Everything seems perfect but nothing is what it seems. There are a series of revelations the protagonist (Billy) discovers as his curiosity grows. Unraveling the truth was no easy task because of ""Society's"" many conspiracies and cover-ups.
The movies political voice lambasted against shallow people only worrying about social status and popularity (as illustrated with Billy's ex-girlfriend in the beginning). It also shows how the rich, literally, feed off the poor. This reminds me of how back in the Roman Empire, the peasants were heavily taxed, which was one factor of the Fall of Rome, where the poor revolted. There were clever puns thrown in that some people might have missed. The rich would eat and tear a person (well just one person) in an erotic orgy zombie-like attack, ""rich feeding off the poor"" - get it? There lots of references about how everyone would be ""contributing to society"" too.
Society has the oddness of ""Jacob's Ladder"" and ""Nick of Time"", the social satire of ""American Psycho"", and the gross effects of ""Bad Taste"" and ""Re-Animator"", only more emphasis on slimy repulsive sludge. Some people got dismembered in ways beyond my imagination. It wasn't bloody but it was gooey, I felt like some of the goop splattered on my face, as I stayed glued to the screen. This bizarre part makes up about the last 20 minutes of the film. Searching for answers made up most of the movie.
Other stuff I should mention: There's a little love story on the side mixed in. Film might feel like it ended a bit prematurely. Some nudity and sex scenes. A fat lady is thrown in for comic relief. You will see someone have an actual butthead. The music is pretty good and fits the movie's tone. The box says it's unrated, not rated R.
So if you want gross splattastic effects used in a film that mocks greedy shallow rich people that think they're better than us humans (the rich weren't human?!) in a cynical imaginative manner, ""Society"" is good choice.",1084233600,43,2225,4.751937984496124

The movie is sort of ""normal"" at first, your typical bad horror movie cliche with poor acting and no plot, but then the main character discovers incest within his family which escalates somehow to a town-wide conspiracy/cult/group (which only he and a friend have managed to avoid) who all get together to...

The story focuses on a young man discovering a horrible secret about his family when they host a party of flesh melding, limb swapping madness for a bunch of mutants (or something like that) and then discovers his true purpose there.
The story is weak, the acting is third-rate, but the effects of joined bodies and malleable flesh are not bad.  I've seen worse excuses for a horror movie, but then I've also seen many better.

633338,2,6303306519,"This is one of those movie's that can't really decide what it wants to be.  On the one hand it could be seen as a satire on the capitalist, greedy society.  On the other it is a silly teen movie with big ideas that it doesn't pull off.  The plot has a teenage jock listening to a tape of his sister talking to their parents in a way that suggests incest.  The next thing you know, the guy that played the tape is killed in a tragic road accident.  Is he imagining it or is something really happening right under his nose?
This plays out as a typical teen movie, with a gorgeous cast that the camera ogles at every opportunity.  Given what is to happen later the almost constant sexual references are perhaps relevant.  However, given the fact that there isn't a solid ending in sight and the sheer gratuity of much of what's here, it's hard to concentrate on any message that Yuzna may have been trying to get across.  Indeed, even if its basic message of 'society will devour itself' is a fine central idea but if a movie is going to serve up incest then it should at least explore it.
The acting isn't important, with a lot of bland yet beautiful faces on display.  There are some truly eye-popping special effectsn though and nobody will forget the gross-out finale due to how distasteful it is.

Billy's parents are acting weird. His sister, friends and girlfriend are acting weird. His therapist, the cops, the paramedics and the judge are acting weird.

In fact, almost EVERYBODY is acting weird except Billy. He even starts doubting his own sanity...until, that is, one of his only ""normal"" friends provides hard evidence that something mighty weird and cultish is indeed afoot.

Yes, it's a clichd storyline that has been done to death for decades (see ""The Faculty"" for another example). What's worse is that this film prolongs the mystery about twice as long as necessary before the big reveal.

So, thirty minutes into the movie, you start muttering, ""Yes, I get it. Something strange is going on. Can we please move it along?"" An hour into the movie, you're yelling, ""I GET IT, I GET IT! SOMETHING STRANGE IS GOING ON!! FFS, GET TO THE REVEAL, ALREADY!!""

When it finally arives, a solid hour and twenty minutes into the film, the reveal isn't that great. Practically the whole community is comprised of morphing mutants who engage in oil-soaked orgies as they assimilate human flesh. Yawn.

What's really bad is that the makeup and monster effects aren't anywhere NEAR the quality that you expect from Screaming Mad George (whose name alone is the main attraction for most weird monster lovers). I don't know why this movie won awards and praise for makeup effects, because all we get in this film are fifteen minutes of stretchy latex and baby oil.

That's it, THAT'S the big reveal. Then, boom, roll credits.

Are fifteen minutes of half-hearted practical effects worth an hour and twenty minutes of a boring, formulaic build-up? I'm voting NO.",1525305600,,1737,4.924657534246576

7844739,4,6303306519,"I had no expectations for this movie, as I'm a bit of a junk food cinephile, and I hadn't even heard of ""Society"".  Rather than recount its plot in great detail, I advise you, if you're curious about this flick, it's best to go in cold.  It's pretty clear that the movie is building toward something unsavory, but it's best letting it all wash over you rather than trying to pick it apart from a safe distance.
Anyway, in short, our hero begins by trying to live up to the high expectations put upon him by his affluent parents- we meet him as he's running for class president against a cartoonishly sneering posh kid.  But our hero often seems in over his head, and reality turns out to be a subjective thing.  If you wonder why I haven't used his name yet, it's because I can't be assed to remember what it is.  The characters in this movie aren't especially compelling, and the performance of our main protag plays a little amateur.  What stays with you are the visuals- all appear to be in-camera effects, as CGI wasn't much of an option for small indies in 1992, which may be worth your time by itself, if you like that sort of thing.
The film does a good enough job of playing with our expectations of whether our hero is delusional up until its conclusion.  While not every plot point lands, the ending all but wipes out the events that led up to it, kind of like how a stick of dynamite eventually overshadows its own sizzling fuse.  ""Society"" is not a great movie.  But it is certainly different.  And on the level of fine schlock movies, it is definitely one of the more ambitious: it is fiercely indie, and also deserves to be.",1523750400,,1638,4.376237623762377
