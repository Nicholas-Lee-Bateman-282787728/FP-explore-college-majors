480385,4,6302574072,"Years before Sideways made and adventure out of wine-tasting, the Year of the Comet was a little comedy, not very popular in the mainstream, that had its own charm.  Tim Daly and Penelope Ann Miller embark on an adventure through Europe to search for Napolean's largest and most famous bottle, the Year of the Comet, in which supposedly contains the secrets of eternal youth. They find out they;r enot the only ones looking for it.

This movie came out in a time when there was still leeway to make non-mainstream independent films that still had charm.  It's not surpring that you cannot find it on DVD.",1146096000,,604,4.679245283018868
480386,4,6302574072,Tim Daly sports a very Magnum PI mustache and Penelope Ann Miller is an adorable frumpy ragamuffin in this romantic comedy adventure tale. I love Louis Jordan as the youth obsessed scientist determined to get his youth formula at any cost. Has some elements found in the Cary Grant Ginger Rogers classic Moneky Business- this is one of my personal favorite comedies from the 90s. Seldom seen on TV and hard to find on VHS I bought a copy several years back- this is one I want to upgrade to DVD- come on studio!,1103241600,21,511,4.446808510638298
480387,5,6302574072,"This is one of the best movies out there that has been overlooked by many people. It is a story of an apprentice wine-merchant,(Penelope Ann Miller), who discovers a bottle of wine that belonged to Napoleon called ""The Year Of The Comet"". The adventure starts when the bottle gets stollen and they have to chase after it.
This movie has been compared to Romancing the stone, and I think that is a fare comparison. If you buy this movie, you will love it.",1028419200,23,454,4.481927710843373
480388,5,6302574072,"I love this film - pure escapist comedy with romance and love of wine starting with mad dash across Scotland (beautiful scenery) - a perhaps unlikely pairing of Penelope Ann Miller and Tim Daly (of TV's Wings fame) works surprisingly well and Louis Jordan as the villain is a charming addition (he never could sing). Not well received by the critics, but a great time and a must see for wine lovers everywhere!",985478400,8,410,4.63013698630137
480462,4,6302574072,"A light hearted, romantic adventure in the spirit of 'Romancing the Stone' and 'High Road to China, with a great cast.  I enjoyed it when it was first released, and now found it was well worth watching again.  I just felt sorry for that poor bottle of wine - it suffered more than the protagonists!",1507334400,,298,4.4

480528,5,6302574072,This is one of my all time favorite movies.  Tim Daly and Penelope Ann Miller were fantastic in it.  I don't know why their names were not listed on the movie at Amazon.  I am so glad to finally be able to get a decent copy of the movie as it never went to dvd and my own copy was a transfer I did from vhs to dvd.  A not very good copy at that.

480582,5,6302574072,Penelope Ann Miller is an incredible actress.  I have never seen her give a bad or mediocre performance.  Tim Daly did a great job.  I never could understand how Hollywood can be successful to actors and actresses with minimal talent and yet really good performers rarely make it to the top.  This was a delightful movie with great acting.  Good dialogue and photography.  Well worth watching by young and old.,1472342400,4,410,4.785714285714286

It's everything you hope for in an adventure, with gorgeous locations in Scotland and Louis Jourdan as a marvelous villain. A 'must have' movie for anyone who wants to escape from the bad guys while chasing after the prize. William Goldman wrote this; his witty characters and unpredictable story line make this movie irresistible. You can't sit back, you must lean forward and dive into the fun.",1469577600,,459,4.7375

The plot is well done & kept me interested till the end. This is a peasant way to spend an evening & a nice date movie. I like it so well that I have watched it 4  times over the years. The speedy flight in the helicopter with Tim flying was especially funny. Also, the locations are really lovely(castles too). Don't be surprised if you find you want wine with your popcorn, since the plot involves plenty of discussion about the most valuable/best tasting wines in the world!",1467676800,,613,4.572727272727272

While postured as in the same genre as Princess Bride - R-rated language and brief adult scenes (which added nothing to the plot or storyline) give what could have been a 4.5/5.0 to 3/5.",1464652800,,261,4.24

480699,5,6302574072,"Yeah, it's one of the movies from the 80's that was cheesy even when it was made, but I love Penelope in the movie.  She's upbeat and interesting the whole of the movie as a protagonist.  Tim Daly is great,and it wouldn't be the same movie without him, but it's between Penelope and Louis Jourdan, the antagonist, for the movie's character.  Most movies are made, for me, within the first few seconds with this movie it's when Penelope goes to Scotland, this is where the upbeat character of the movie is cemented.

The plot line is thin, although not implausible; it's the scenery and upbeat story line, with little funny one offs strewn throughout the movie, that makes the movie fun to watch.  This to me is another, 'Better Off Dead' or 'Grosse Point Blank'",1440892800,2,761,4.607407407407408

480800,5,6302574072,"1811 was an auspicious year for the grape, and the few remaining bottles from various vineyards across Europe command prices today that can easily purchase a multi-bedroom home and large tract property in most US real estate markets. To say that it's special would be an understatement of monumental proportions. Oenophiles don't dream of women - they dream of bottles. And The Year Of The Comet is 'The Year' to own.

As 2013 will host a pair of so-called notable comets, perhaps providing the best views since The Year Of The Comet and likely the last chance this century for such a viewing, I decided to put time in and give praise to one of my favorite films of the same name. One of the best romantic comedies of the 90s; arguably equal to many of its better known contemporaries like 'Pretty Woman' and 'Jerry Maguire'.

Tells the story of Margaret 'Maggie' Harwood, the younger child to Sir Mason Harwood, managing partner of Harwood House, a premiere wine brokerage. Her upbringing in America due to a divorce during which her mother won custody. Returning to the family business, she finds herself as a second rate menial, a peon. Her older half-brother the long presumptive successor - Margaret is therefore delegated to  setting, washing and cleaning up after the tastings. Her dream of brokering a wine cellar growing more distant with each passing year. Frustrated that her incompetent and emotionally twisted older sibling gets all the plum assignments - she makes one last final appeal to her father: Give her a client or she's gone. It's not an idle threat. Despite her love of both father and the business, she's no longer doing the slave bit.

Stunned that his little obedient automaton has a voice of her own, he relents.

There's a small cellar they've been asked to disperse. An absentee Scottish laird - a lord of a castle and estate - passed away with no designated heir for the wine and spirits collection. Her job: Inventory, evaluate, and prep for shipment to their London firm.

Unbeknownst to all - the unoccupied manor is already occupied. Some very unsavory characters have made it their base of operations. One of whom is being tortured for information that has absolutely nothing to with crushed grapes. And he's about to die - in the wine cellar.

Refusing to be brushed away in her very first, and if unsuccessful, only assignment - she demands to see the cellar. Threatening to call the police if she cannot verify the contents of the collection, the villains decide that discretion is the better part of confrontation, they allow her access to the cache. Not realizing until it's too late that the information that they so desperately seek was scribbled onto a wine bottle. A rather large and dusty wine bottle. The same bottle that Maggie is about to rediscover.

Uncovering one of the most important treasures of the 20th century, and perhaps the greatest wine discovery in nearly two hundred years, she's located a magnum from the personal store of Napoleon I, Emperor of France and conqueror of Europe. It's estimated value: USD$1,000,000.00. The single most expensive bottle of wine in the world, and Maggie found it hidden away by a throwaway client.

The problem is that such a find can't and won't be quiet for long. Soon slimy agents of the ultra wealthy and various nogoodniks are making their way to Scotland. By hook or crook, they want that bottle. They'll kill if they have to in order to obtain it.

Making the situation even more volatile (fun) is Maggie's airborne chauffeur. Devilishly handsome, overwhelmingly smarmy, and apparently multitalented in all manner of maneuvers - besides behind the stick of a chopper. Her exuberance at locating the magnum bubbles over to her personal life as she and one Oliver Plexico fall into bed. Very unlike her, but the passion she's held back for so long suddenly makes its way out of her corked social life.

As the various factions battle for the wine - Maggie and Oliver find themselves pitted against the villains, the elements, and even each other.

A tightly woven and superbly acted romantic comedy in the best tradition of '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/It-Happened-One-Night/dp/B001GUYAZY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">It Happened One Night</a>' and '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Libeled-Lady/dp/B0006Z2KY8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Libeled Lady</a>'.

- Strangely, and perhaps as a form of self-flagellate punishment, Tim Daly has never taken pride of performance in this wonderful movie.

I'd never heard of this film in all these years and though it was decent to watch I can see why it never made a big impact.

For a romance it was disappointing. The characters are thrown together and fall in love in a day. I guess it's supposed to be spontaneous but it just seemed ridiculous to me. The so-called villains act like they jumped out of a Pink Panther cartoon.

This was definitely a mixed bag for me. It starts off intriguing but becomes less and less interesting as it goes on.

I wouldn't have kept watching it if Tim Daly hadn't looked so hot in it. He looks good with a mustache!

The result is something that makes a Tom and Jerry cartoon look like ""Gone with the Wind.""

Probably the worst and most far-fetched aspect of the movie comes at the end when the Tim Daly character bids on a bottle of wine from 1811.  He has spent the preceding 90 minutes playing a stunt double with a bad back and now he's a bio-chemical genius from MIT.  Not only that but he can afford to spend $5 million on a single bottle of wine.  Hard to believe that anything could be sillier than that.

480861,5,6302574072,"Tim Daly seems to be known more for his moments on television than for his ventures into motion picture. He really just doesn't have a lot of defining roles in cinema. In the small screen, he starred memorably in WINGS and then, more recently, in the very short lived THE FUGITIVE and THE NINE. And, lest the fanboys forget, he was the voice of the WB's animated Superman in the mid to late '90s. But he did have that one movie, even if it's not that well known. One of the very few of his cinematic efforts which does stand out in my mind - even to this day - is 1992's YEAR OF THE COMET, which is a modest and lighthearted foray into a world where wine, skullduggery, and the quest for eternal youth bump heads. Tim Daly is outstanding as Oliver Plexico, the boorish, semi-dashing hero with the lower back affliction. This is also the film in which I developed a huge crush on Penelope Ann Miller.

Here's the plot: Miller plays the prim and proper (but very pretty) Margaret Harwood, the daughter of a London wine merchant. Margaret is steeped in wine lore, certainly knowing much more about the trade than her snooty, British half-brother. But, because she's a woman, she's relegated to handling the menial, every day tasks of the business. She dearly wants to travel and be an appraiser of wine. She finally gives her father an ultimatum: assign her a legitimate project or she walks. Her father, knowing her worth, reluctantly caves, and Margaret is off to Scotland to catalogue a castle's wine cellar.

There, she stumbles into intrigue and great peril as she unearths a giant, dusty bottle of rare vintage, labeled as an 1811 Lafite and possibly once belonging to Napoleon Bonaparte. Incidentally, 1811 is referred to as the Year of the Comet, the ""most legendary year in the history of wine."" The very next morning, she meets up with crass, beer swilling Oliver Plexico (Daly), the errand boy of a Texas wine connoisseur who'd already agreed to purchase the Lafite. But, shortly after, Margaret and Plexico find themselves in mortal danger as various strange and intimidating men begin to pursue them.

All this hoopla for a bottle of wine, or as Oliver Plexico bemusedly wonders, ""I can't believe we're doing all this for a beverage."" But the movie works, and works wonderfully. The very capable William Goldman scribes the screenplay and turns what could've been a dull, mediocre story into something that's still fairly predictable but, in his hands, also becomes frothy, engagingly tongue-in-cheek, and very romantic. And let's not forget funny. The film also benefits from the delightful backdrops of the French Riviera and Scotland (although Oliver's statement of ""All I know is, I just...hate Scotland."" can be forgiven, given what he's been thru).

And then there's the acting and rapport of the two leads. By no means are these two stars A-listers, but, in this film, they give their best performances, or, at least, my favorite performances. Penelope Ann Miller gets the film's top billing and she's fetching as the cultured, uptight girl with surprising reserves of gumption. She instills Maggie with a certain innocent, almost waiflike quality, which, by the way, only serves to make her even sexier in that one bathtub shot (sorry, rated PG-13). These two actors emit a certain heat between them as, decidedly, their thorny but playful give and take chemistry becomes the film's single, greatest asset. From the moment they began to insult each other, you had a feelin' about these two...

Tim Daly - fit, poofy-haired, and mustached - shows here that he can play the rugged, wrily charming hero with the best of 'em. I like that he isn't portrayed as a James Bondian type who casually routs the bad guys. In fact, if memory serves me, Oliver Plexico gets beat up more times than he gets to deliver a smackdown on people. French actor Louis Jordan plays his villainous part with fervor; even when he tortures his victims, he displays a debonair French flair. The other noteworthy role here is that old woman who plays the eavesdropping Scottish landlady. She's a treat.

Someday, some happy day, the powers that be will produce a Region 1 dvd of YEAR OF THE COMET (and, hopefully, it'll be in widescreen, with extra features, but that might be asking for too much). Until then, I'll settle for my Region 2 dvd and my VHS tape copy, which are the only ways for me to reliably catch up again with Oliver Plexico - who's more than he seems - and his ""funny, overworked ragamuffin.""",1182729600,5,4500,4.7702182284980745
