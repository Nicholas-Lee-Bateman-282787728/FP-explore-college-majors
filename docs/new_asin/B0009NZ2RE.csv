2303130,3,B0009NZ2RE,"Let me first say these episodes deserve 5 stars.  They essentially encompass the climax of the series' mythology (its most fascinating element) and are incredible in all terms:  acting, story, cinematography, the fabulous background music of Mark Snow, which I'd hoped Fox would allow him to release on CD (only his earlier, inferior music is available).
The stories are simply better told with dialogue more interestingly done than before in the series;  up to this point, stories and dialogue sometimes seemed a bit slow-paced and dull, in addition to seriously lacking in the special effects department due to insufficient funding.  Starting with these episodes, the show seemed to evolve into a whole new entity -- its dramatic effects twice as powerful as what they were before.  These episodes required repeated viewing to fully comprehend the increasingly complex plot, but this was hardly a chore since they were so beautifully done and had so much dramatic depth to explore as well.  They made me an unapologetic fan (yes, my friend nicknamed me after two characters I was imitating at the time:  Seinfeld and Mulder), and made this my still-favorite show of all time.
My reasons for 3 stars have to do with the few commentary tracks available, which are done only by directors.  No offense to Rob Bowman, Kim Manners, and R.W. Goodwin, but director commentaries are never as interesting as those done by the writers.  These episodes are available on full-season sets, which I already own, and which have great non-mythology episodes to attract those who haven't bought either, despite their exhorbitant price.  While I would like to see Chris Carter's documentary on this part of the mythology, it still isn't really worth it to me.  The whole reason I bought the first mythology set was to hear writers' commentaries on the mythology episodes they largely avoided in the show's season long DVD sets.  With such paucity of writer involvement this time, there's no need for me to buy this set.",1117584000,6,2002,5.015105740181269
2303131,5,B0009NZ2RE,"We know Fox Mulder and the quest he is on. We also know his companions and the people who chase him mercilessly, and we know what would happen if he gave up. That said, there is more to it all than meets the eye. There are abductions that happen, muddy little pools of the past lying in wait for the next foolhardy onlookers to come, colonization plans hatching, and soliders that are super - thanks for asking! I like that a lot and I have to give the writers a lot of credit. Even shows that model themselves after the X's cannot seem to place the right amount of boom in that sphere of intrigue.

After noting exactly what happened in the years (3 seasons) that added up to the event that encapsulated ""Abductions,"" the X-Files turned to another story arch. This time it dealt with a mysterious fluid call the Black Oil which, by the show's accounts, began tormenting humans in the wayyy wayyy back. In fact, the one thing that this is missing is the movie ""Fight the Future,"" where you see the aliens attacking some really acient wayfarers. True, these are collections of the series and, true, the timeline you get with this includes these run-ins. Still, some of the pieces here are missing a little.

One thing that runs a little off-base is the fact that not all of this is turly about Black Oil. While many episodes are, some are simply furthering the aliens and what they do AND this is what is called Black Oil. Even some of Colonization could actually be considered Black Oil if someone wanted to argue it, but the point of the matter is that there is a story inside of a story. If you can put this aside and watch what is happening, there is some nice stuff showcased here. When you combine that with the timeline that comes with the series - it is supposed to have that and if it does not then you shoudl not get it - you get explanations about the new players in the macabre planetary combine that chews on human will. These include ""X,"" Marita Covarrubias,"" ""Alex Krychek,"" ""Jeremiah Smith,"" ""Alien Bounty Hunter,"" Micheal Kritschgau,"" and ""Max Fenig."" They ar enot limited to these, but these are the ones mentioned.

Of all the things contained within this series, I like these pieces the best. The headlines are easily missed sometimes and you could possibly debate the inclusion of some pieces here. I personally love that part of it all, asking and hearing ideas, seeing what people have included in their ""truths."" Also, there are some extras BUT NOT much, with a few optonal interviews and a deleted scene sometimes. The interviews seem to average 1 - 3 or 1 - 4, so they are not a biggie. Stil, it is well worth taking out and looking over.",1299196800,,2663,4.48659793814433
2303132,4,B0009NZ2RE,"This is a great continuation of the mythology/conspiracy stories that are at the forefront of the X-Files. The marketing concept behind this collection is acutally quite good, though understandibly frustrating, because several different types of fans will likely consider purchasing it, even if you already own the full seasons, due to the extras. There are certainly several great episodes in this collection, some of the best in the series IMO, and the only criticisms I have of it are relatively minor: giving titles/themes to the volumes of this 'Mythology Collection' when there's little consistency within those titles/themes and, as other reviewers have mentioned, some episodes crucial to the overall story, though not necessarily involved directly per se, were omitted for some strange reason.

Despite those two minor occurances this is an entertaining show and a well put-together collection. I own three of the four volumes and would recommend any of them to even the most casual fan of the show, especially if he/she prefers not to buy the full seasons as these are notably less expensive.",1278806400,,1102,5.261363636363637
2303133,4,B0009NZ2RE,It's been interesting reading the reviews of the X-Files Mythology series.  The die hard fans love it all.  THe purists find fault in episodes not included.  I was out of the country during the X-years and appreciate this whole set of 4 topic driven collections.  I can watch the sets one at a time and get a good overview of the threads of the series.  I think it's a good idea and will use this same review for each.  bg,1247616000,,422,4.2125
2303134,5,B0009NZ2RE,Very good!! Much more professionnal than volume 1 ! And we start to see the picture pretty clearly! Great info! :),1203638400,,114,4.476190476190476
2303135,2,B0009NZ2RE,"As any devoted X-Phile will tell you, the idea of a collection devoted exclusively to the ""mythology"" episodes alone is a somewhat dodgy idea, with many attendant problems.  First of all, much of the show's ineffable charm was found in the balance of standalone/comedic/MOTW (""monster-of-the-week"") episodes vs. the heavier mythology episodes - watching all of these tangled, knotty mytharc episodes can be a suffocating experience.  Secondly, the overarching character development of both Mulder and Scully (as well as the secondary characters) was rarely restricted to the mythology episodes; someone who only knows the X-Files through these four mythology-only boxed sets will miss the introduction of Skinner and Cigarette Smoking Man's first speaking role (""Tooms""), the introduction of Alex Krycek and Mr. X (""Sleepless""), and the revelation that Scully has cancer (""Leonard Betts""), among other things.

Finally, there is some dispute as to what constitutes a ""mythology"" episode in the first place.  For example, Volume 1 (""Abduction"") of this four volume set has drawn a lot of justifiable criticism for excluding a pivotal early first season episode called ""Conduit,"" where the depths of Mulder's obsession about his abducted sister Samantha are first explored.  (The fact that ""Conduit"" is arguably one of the ten finest episodes in the history of the series, both eerie and poignant, only makes its omission that much more painful.)  ""Musings Of A Cigarette Smoking Man,"" concerning the secret history of Mulder's nemesis, is also a mythology episode, as is the excellent late Season Four installment ""Demons.""  Some of the decisions made in what to include or exclude seem arbitrary.

This last point is important because it DOESN'T address the inexcusable omission of a major mythology two-parter from this set: ""Christmas Carol"" and ""Emily.""  Their omission can't be explained by an arbitrary ""is it mythology or isn't it?"" judgment call: these two episodes are directly on-point with the larger mytharc, complete with questions about Scully's abduction, the harvesting of her ova, alien-human hybrids, green-blooded shape-changing bounty hunters, and government conspiracies.  What's more, they're very good episodes, ones which I would place in the upper echelon of X-Files mythology installments.

The most surprising question, then, is: why hasn't anyone noticed they're missing?  My theory: these episodes came chronologically after ""Redux"" and ""Redux II,"" which conclude this set, and before  ""Patient X"" and ""The Red And The Black,"" which open Volume 3. The compilers must have thought nobody would notice their absence, I guess (a suspicion furthered by the fact that the ""Mythology Timelines"" included with these sets conveniently omit any reference to these episodes, even as they namecheck other episodes which aren't included in these packages).  The reason I'm TRULY steamed, however, is because there's absolutely no reason why they couldn't have been included here.  Each DVD can hold, at the very least, five full episodes (see disc 6 of the Complete Season Two boxed set), and the final disc of this set only holds three.  This wasn't an issue of limited space and painful decisions needing to be made, it was simple laziness.

There have been a number of X-Files mythology episodes that were either badly written or irrelevant to the larger conspiracy.  (For an example of the former, see the atrocious ""Per Manum"" or the Season Nine two-parter ""Nothing Important Happened Today."" For an example of the latter, see ""Fallen Angel"" and ""Tempus Fugit""/""Max"": all three of these are excellent, and in fact the latter - included on this set - may be my favorite two-parter in series history, but none of them have anything to do with the greater conspiracy.) ""Christmas Carol"" and ""Emily"" are neither of these, and their unexplained disappearance in these sets is therefore inexcusable.  It comes close to invalidating the entire raison d'etre of this package in the first place.

This may seem like a bit of a rant, but the mistake/intentional oversight in this case is so inexcusable, and the loss so great, that it seriously damages the value of the ""Black Oil"" set.  Unless you buy/rent/have already seen these missing Season Five episodes, you're missing a huge part of the story.  Additionally, the Black Oil set is light on useful extras: there are only three commentaries (and R.W. Goodwin is soporific as always on ""Talitha Cumi""), and the documentary is skimpy and inessential.

Ultimately, these mythology boxed sets are most useful for fans who want to follow the continuing storyline through the last few dodgy seasons without buying the complete seasons.  In that sense Volumes 3 and 4 are the ones to get, while Volumes 1 and 2 are less so since you're much better off purchasing the new reduced-price editions of the first five or six seasons.  (Also, there's far less confusion in Seasons 7-9 over what does or does not constitute a ""mythology"" episode - you won't be missing anything crucial with the later boxed sets like you are with the first two.)

I'm giving ""Black Oil"" two starts as opposed to only one because there's no denying the objective quality of most of the installments found here. ""Nisei""/""731"" (""Scully, let me tell you, you haven't seen America until you've seen it from a train""), ""Piper Maru""/""Apocrypha,"" ""Memento Mori,"" ""Tempus Fugit""/""Max"" - these are series highlights. But for reasons explained above this set was already a questionable investment; the omission of a major (and high-quality) mythology two-parter merely ices it.",1148515200,16,5601,5.251121076233184
2303136,5,B0009NZ2RE,"The X-Files is my favorite all-time TV series (though, I must admit, it is tied with Seinfeld and the Simpsons). I would always look forward to seeing it, whether a rerun or a new show. Though I missed many, many, many episodes during its 9 year life (I was never really one to be glued to the TV for any show), I have been frustrated in my efforts to watch episodes I have missed, mostly due to the expense of the Complete Season DVD sets. It is once in a blue moon that I can afford to put down as much as $120 for a TV show, so I've done without for a long time, barring my ownership of Season 3. Also, I've found that the episodes I care the most about catching up on are the ones that push the main story line along-- the ones dealing with the government-conspiracy-alien-takeover story line; something I've since learned is referred to as ""the Mythology arc."" This will sound lame (even to this writer) but the Bare Naked Ladies song ""One Week"" summarized my hopes when sitting down to watch the X-Files. ""I hope the Smoking Man is in this one."" The smoking man's involvement in an episode usually indicated a furthering of the overall plot, the mythology arc. In short, these are the Smoking Man episodes.

Vol 2 of the most current repackaging (though I found ""slimmer"" versions of complete Seasons 1, 2, and 3 which are cheaper than the originals), takes us further down the rabbit hole, with the mythology episodes from Seasons 3 - 6.  Early acting jitters from Gillian Anderson and David Duchovany (seen in seasons one an two) are all but gone.  And with the monster of the week episodes gone, what remains is arguably the best material in the X-Files history, particularly in the first two discs.  Sure, certain helpful episodes are noticably absent (especially to X-heads), but few can argue with what's here; all killer no filler.  Though typical fans rate Seasons one through five as *****, then taper off the scores of the last half of the show's life, don't let that scare away the curious.  The last two Volumes of this repackaging are stellar, not to mention a great value @ $30.

I can't say any of the episodes or seasons or Volumes are my favorite, but ""Black Oil"" comes close.  I mean, body jumping alien liquid trying to get back to its ship in a forgotten silo in the middle of nowhere?  C'mon!  Forget about it; it's solid, television gold.

2303138,4,B0009NZ2RE,"The second volume in the X-Files Mythology series focuses on the Black Oil aspect of the series.

The episodes included here: Nisei, 731, Piper Maru, Apocrypha, Talitha Cumi, Herrenvolk, Tunguska, Terma, Memento Mori, Tempus Fugit, Max, Zero-Sum, Gethsemane, Redux, and Redux II, are all excellent and just about classic X-Files episodes that are compiled here for a cheap price, which is what makes the X-Files Mythology series worth owning for casual X-Files fans who don't want to shell out the money for complete season sets.  If you are a die hard X-phille, you're better off with the season sets which include all the great stand alone episodes (where as the Mythology sets revolve around the series' single storyarc), but other than that, this is a solid deal for casual X-fans.",1124409600,14,953,5.057324840764331
2303139,4,B0009NZ2RE,"The whole ""black oil"" storyline was one of the best storylines in the entire show of X-Files.

2303140,4,B0009NZ2RE,"I'm still not convinced that this series of inexpensive boxed with minimal new special features that present the mythology episodes of THE X-FILES is all that desirable or that it should take priority over a complete reissue of the individual seasons in more reasonably priced editions. Nonetheless, it is a great way of calling attention to the extraordinary importance of THE X-FILES in taking long-story-arc television to the next level.

THE X-FILES always functioned on two level: first, it consisted of a host of standalone episodes that are probably the finest set of supernatural stories on TV since the glory days of THE TWILIGHT ZONE. Because the box here is focused on the mythology episodes, I won't say more about these here. The second level of THE X-FILES was the mythology episodes, a series of individual shows that taken together over nine seasons told the story of an international government conspiracy to hide the truth about human-alien encounters, as well as the reason for that conspiracy. It is almost impossible to stress the importance of these episodes, because they helped recreate what was possible on commercial television, and has helped provide a template for the future of television. I earnestly believe that THE X-FILES was one of three television shows that jointly reinvented what was possible on television. Briefly, here is a short account of what these shows accomplished:

The first of the three shows was TWIN PEAKS (which, by the way, dealt in its second half with alien abduction-one of the abductees being the actor who would play Scully's father later on--featured as a minor character a transvestite FBI agent played by David Duchovny). Many will remember what a bombshell TWIN PEAKS was when it first appeared on TV. It was the first series on TV to show that the medium could provide entertainment as absorbing and as artistically complex as movies. But most importantly, it told a story that took a couple of dozen episodes to tell, and completely shattered the convention that a story had to fit in a single episode. On the other hand, it was completely different from soap operas or shows like HILL STREET BLUES in that it was attempting to tell a story with a beginning, a middle, and an end. These other shows had continuity from week to week, and things happened to the characters over a long series of episodes, but there really wasn't a story as such that they were trying to tell. But TWIN PEAKS did. Unfortunately, after one of the greatest-perhaps the greatest-first seasons in the history of TV, TWIN PEAKS faltered badly in the second season, starting yet one mystery after another without resolving any, piling oddness on top of mystery. The lesson to be learned: the narrative must be consistent and it must go somewhere.

THE X-FILES was one of the first shows to benefit by the new creative space created by TWIN PEAKS. Chris Carter and his cohorts didn't repeat the mistake of resolving no mysteries or not allowing the narrative to proceed to definite places. And because the show did not fall apart in its second season like TWIN PEAKS did, it was able to do something that had never been done on TV before: expand its ongoing story over a stretch of several years. It was an astonishing achievement and as a result is not merely a great show because of the enjoyment it provides, but because of the influence it has exerted on the development of TV. Nonetheless, the mythology arc of THE X-FILES had at least two problems. First, as Chris Carter and others have admitted, the story arc was more or less made up as they went along, and it sometimes shows. At several points the arc is shifted in a way that seems intended to surprise the viewers. For instance, until in Season Seven we get an authoritative account of what happened to Mulder's sister Samantha, several versions of what happened to her were trotted out. And who was Mulder's biological father? If you watch all of the commentaries on the DVD sets, you will discover that even well into the series the primary producers of the show weren't sure who Mulder's father was. In the final episode, ""The Truth,"" they finally clear this up by baldly stating that it was the Cigarette Smoking Man, but they could easily have stated the opposite. So, there was an inconsistency in tone and in fact caused by a lack of long-term planning. Second, the show erred by focusing primarily on either that week's mystery or the great conspiracy that was the subject of the mythology, whereas any fan of the show could tell what really fascinated us about the show: Mulder and Scully. Eventually, the show became more about Mulder and Scully than the conspiracy, but it took a while. The lesson to be learned? You must plan your story arc ahead of time and the focus must be on the characters and not the mystery.

THE X-FILES made possible the third crucial show in the recreation of the possibilities for TV: BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER. What did BUFFY add to the mix? Two things. First, BUFFY had long story arcs that extended over the course of not merely several episodes but over seasons, much like THE X-FILES. But unlike THE X-FILES there was far more long-term planning. For instance, in a late Season Three episode one character says something to another than in retrospect was a clear reference to something that happened two years later. This enabled far more internal consistency in the story arc than we saw in THE X-FILES. The second, and perhaps more important, addition was the focus from the beginning of the show to its end on character rather than situation. If in THE X-FILES the emotional life of Mulder and Scully was somewhat in the background and the conspiracy in the foreground, on BUFFY the emotional lives and relationships of Buffy, Willow, Angel, Spike, and Xander were the focus, while the villains and monsters were background. But it must be noted that without the exceptional success of THE X-FILES in ratings, BUFFY would never have been allowed to take the long-story-arc to the next level.

Where has all of this gotten us? The heirs of TWIN PEAKS/THE X-FILES/BUFFY THE VAMPURE SLAYER include: DARK ANGEL, ALIAS, FARSCAPE, WONDERFALLS, ANGEL, FIREFLY, DEAD LIKE ME, CARNIVALE, SIX FEET UNDER, SMALLVILLE, 24, THE WIRE, and LOST. If one reads LOST's co-creator Damon Lindelhof's comments in an April issue of ENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY, it is obvious that many producers are acutely aware of the changes that the three shows I noted above had wrought. He mentions explicitly LOST's debt to TWIN PEAKS and THE X-FILES (as well as the lessons to learn from the mistakes of the two shows) as well as the success of BUFFY in shifting the focus to character, and the intent of producers and writers to continue in that tradition.

So, while I'm not sure that these four DVD boxed sets address any real need, and while I'm absolutely convinced we would have been better served by new, far less expensive versions of the individual season boxed sets, these sets do serve to call attention to the long story arc of the show that along with TWIN PEAKS and BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER did more than anyother to establish the long story arc as the highest form of television art. My conviction is that we are at the beginning of what could be a permanent trend in television, as the medium moves more and more away from the standalone episode, and more and more towards long story arcs.",1118361600,35,7416,4.785323965651835

8063686,5,B0009NZ2RE,"Nisei resumes the mythology story arc begun in Season 1&2 and takes off where Anasazi, The Blessing Way and Paper Clip left off, with Mulder uncovering a video documentary documenting an alien autopsy, that ends with the brutal disruption by military personnel, and Scully being led to an alien abductee support group who exhibit personal insights into Scully's abduction experience derived from their own abduction experiences, only to encounter skepticism on the part of Scully until they present to her incontrovertible proof exhibited by the alien implants that have been surgical removed that severely shakes the scientific base that constitutes her basis for the rejection of ufology and the alien abduction phenomena - the episode of which is so closely based on true life accounts recounted by alien abductees pertaining to missing time, the feelings of helplessness, their awakening on board an extraterrestrial craft on a surgical table in a state of abject paralysis, the apprehension of vague forms who perform mind scans to extract their deepest memories and fears, the ability of the grays to probe their minds and to communicate with them telepathically, the extensive and intrusive experimentations performed by the grays, tracking devices being implanted in their nostrils (some of which have been surgically removed by medical specialists) - which invariably leads to nose bleeds, the artificial insemination that impregnates the women with alien human hybrids which are then removed by the aliens leaving no signs of pregnancy (confounding medical experts), and the support groups these women form to provide emotional support in the face of post-traumatic stress disorder, that it could bloody well pass for a true life story - the story arc of which will reach a climax in the greatest cliff hanger in the history of American television series since the shooting of J.R. Ewing (in the soap opera, Dallas), in Gethsemane and conclude with Mulder exposing the culprit in the second episode of Redux.

Gethsemane opens with Scully testifying before an FBI inquiry panel regarding the illegitimacy of Mulder's work on The X-Files and informing the panel that Mulder had committed suicide resultant of his discovery that he had been duped by the DOD into believing the biggest of all lies, and, through a series of flashbacks interspersed with footage of her testimony before the panel, that takes us back to the events leading to his suicide - beginning with Mulder being contacted by a group of archeologists who had discovered an extra biological entity embedded within ice core samples that, resultant of the freezing temperature, had been preserved with what constitutes perfect condition despite carbon dating tests that prove that the EBE had graced our planet thousands of years prior to its discovery, leaving Mulder elated at finally finding incontrovertible evidence of the existence of extraterrestrials, only to find that the people who had been entrusted with the EBE being shot to death and the EBE vanishing, after tissue samples had been extracted from the EBE, with the tissue samples proving to be hybrid cells of a chimera, with strands of the DNA corresponding to the DNA of a tissue sample taken from Scully - which is indicative of the fact that the people responsible for the chimera had also being responsible for giving Scully the cancer that had resulted from the neck implant; and testimony from an employee of the DOD who testifies of a government conspiracy to obtain tissue samples from every citizen of the United States and human biological experiments that had been executed with impunity on unsuspecting American citizens - in effect, producing the chimera that was meant to be discovered by Mulder but never meant to be scientifically verified but the evidence of which would disappear after the discovery had convinced Mulder of the existence of extraterrestrials, and concludes with Mulder immersing himself in televised interviews with prominent scientists testifying with the assertion that extraterrestrial life is bound to exist somewhere in the universe and tears streaming down from Mulder's eyes due to his ardent desire to belief fundamentally shaken.

Redux, resumes the story arc with Mulder discovering that he is being keep under surveillance and confronting the intelligence agent monitoring his every move and both drawing their service weapons and opening fire, cutting to Scully's testimony that Mulder had committed suicide by firing his service weapon to his face and that she had recognized his corpse from the attire he had adorned prior to his demise, only for us to discover that Mulder had shot the DOD operative in the face to eradicate his identity, while absconding with his security card which, then, provides level four security clearance to the Top Security DOD installation which leads him to a room literally littered with row upon row of dead grays and a vault in which he discovers a small vail which he is told by Cigarette Smoking Man contains the cure for Scully's cancer - which had by now metathesized, leading to Scully's hospitalization, even as DNA evidence proves that the corpse that had been discovered does not comprise that of Mulder, a fact that Skinner conceals to shelter Scully from disciplinary action, even as Mulder returns from the dead to convince Scully to reimplant the neck implant which had been removed in order to restore Scully to health, under the notion that the removal of the implant had resulted in the contraction of cancer and that its reintroduction to Scully's neck would result in a remission of the disease, a fact which is, gradually, validated by Scully's progressive return to health.

The climax of the story arc can be witnessed in part two of Redux with Fox Mulder being taken to task for killing the DOD agent with the promise that he will be exonerated if he should testify that Skinner had been working within the FBI with his own secret agenda - with the Section Chief of FBI claiming to possess incriminating evidence against Skinner, something that Mulder refrains from doing, only to testify before the board of inquiry, asserting that he will identify the culprit covertly working within the FBI, leading to one of the most intense moments ever capture on television, the tension of which is excruciating, with all implications implying that Mulder is about to incriminate Skinner, only to climax with the revelation that the Section Chief is the culprit harboring a secret agenda within the FBI, inducing the Section Chief to bolt for his office in a feat of panic, where he is assassinated by one of the Men in Black working for MJ12.

Mulder is, then, approached by Cigarette Smoking Man who reveals that Mulder's DOD informant had fed him with lies that have misled him into believing that extraterrestrial life does not exist, something which he implies is the furthest from the truth, and implying that he will be presented with the revelation of the truth providing he joins MJ12 and inducts himself into the fold of this infamous group to further their unconscionable agenda - something that Mulder's conscience will not permit him to do, the story arc of which will resume in Patient X and The Red and the Black

From episode 1, you are immersed in a world of charming and enduring characters, edge-of-your-seat suspenseful mysteries, mind-challenging guess-who/never-saw-that-coming conspiracies, perfectly timed relatable humor, and utterly addictive drama that grabs hold and does not let go until the final triumphant and fan-pleasing episode. The plot-lines are fantastic and leave you begging for more, unable to wait to begin the next episode. This show ran for ""9"" years! That alone tells you that something is definitely right about this show. If you enjoy science fiction and great story-telling, then don't wait another second to watch this series. I guarantee you will love it!",1383264000,,962,5.4630872483221475
8063691,4,B0009NZ2RE,"The X-Files, which set a new standard for science fiction during its nine year run, alternated between two types of scripts, stand-alone episodes and long story arcs.  The four mythology sets contain most of the story arc scripts.  This, the second set, contained some of the best ideas.  By the third season, the premise had been established.  There were hints of contacts with extraterrestrials, evidence of genetic manipulation, unexplained abductions, and alien viruses to which doctors in rival countries were trying to develop immunity.  There was more action in several episodes - a frenetic search for a virus transported by train, and a grim stay in a Soviet prison camp.  The scripts kept the audience guessing by never entirely resolving the mysteries.  The unresolved quality of the plots enhanced the often paranoid and enigmatic atmosphere of the series.",1361923200,2,868,5.246376811594203
