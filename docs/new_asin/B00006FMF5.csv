7967894,5,B00006FMF5,"This movie is a guilty pleasure period. Its a movie with a cult following that is nothing but a Italian Jaws rip-off that stars the great Michael Sopkiw. The Italians answer to Kurt Russell. I really enjoy the locations because it reminds me of when I was in the Florida Keys. The story moves fast. The soundtrack has some cool parts. The funny dubbing rules! In a nutshell,you either really love or really hate these Italian cult movies. I happen to love them. Of course this movie will never see the light of day for an American release so you must hunt down a dv-r or find a true European release if you must have the real deal.",1407110400,,631,4.3559322033898304
