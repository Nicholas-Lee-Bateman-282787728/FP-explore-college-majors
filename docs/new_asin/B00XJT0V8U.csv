The study guide workbook is really not necessary for the small group. I found the questions to be overly personal and not conducive to small group discussion. It would work ok as a personal journal, but it wasn't helpful for discussions. I know Francis was trying to challenge people to be more open to the Holy Spirit, but in some of his questions in the workbook, it came off as very negative and dismissive of conservative churches-- I found it slightly offensive even though I attend a Pentecostal church. Very early on, I decided that we were not going to use the workbook at all, and only use the book and DVD. I would write up my own questions based on the chapter and use that for discussion instead. Some of the group members found this book to be not intense enough, and that the author spent too much time defining the Holy Spirit rather than how to hear his voice. Other members found this book too intense. For future small groups, I would not recommend that my leaders use this particular book, but rather use his other books, like Crazy Love.",1500336000,,1182,4.476851851851852
