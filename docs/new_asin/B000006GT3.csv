Cruelly neglected when released, this screwball wonderment extends its laugh-a-minute roots to Preston Sturges at his madcap peak. Richard Lester's last great film, it's so packed with indelible characters and characterizations -- topped by David Wayne's motormouth train conductor -- that only when I watched it a second time years later did I realize Jim Carrey, unknown back in '85, played AWOL GI Norman Biddlecoff.

My favorite dialogue from this endearing flick: Con artist Beverly D'Angelo -- pretending to be the wife (mother?) of allegedly dead Norman, begins a eulogy  over his (bodiless) coffin and calls him ""Biddlehoff."" Whispering in her ear, Con partner Louis Gossett corrects her: ""Coff, Coff."" Dutifully, Beverly coughs twice. I'm laughing even as I write this.

And also sighing. What should have remained one of the classic verbal exchanges in all comedy is instead totally forgotten. Thank heaven it glows in the hearts and minds of we few enlightened souls who recognized ""Finders Keepers"" for the kracked masterpiece it remains. But now only in memory: I accidentally threw out my video copy, an action for which I will assuredly never forgive myself. I guess I'll eventually have to cough up the requisite 50 bucks or more for a replacement, which seems an eminently just price for a movie so ferociously funny -- a movie forever denied its pantheon site. NEVER CEASE SPREADING THE WORD, FELLOW FLAME KEEPERS! (COFF! COFF!)",1436140800,,1526,5.17004048582996

7904266,4,B000006GT3,"Richard Lester was a wonderful director and this film is a great deal of fun. It takes its time setting up the situation, and then the ball starts rolling with a wonderful cast of comic characters, including the great David Wayne, as the oldest living train conductor, Jim Carrey, and Beverly d'Angelo. It's a shame such a wonderful film has been overlooked for a DVD transfer.  It's too good to miss.",1374192000,,401,4.647887323943662

I went to Amazon, easily located a copy, and surprised him with it for his birthday. He was tickled pink!",1241222400,,256,4.244897959183674
7904268,5,B000006GT3,"This is a terrific screwball comedy that barrels along like a non-stop runaway train - which happens to be the setting throughout much of the movie. Michael O'Keefe inadvertently gets involved in a robbery when he himself is trying to escape from the feminine clutches of a roller derby team he owns; the money from the robbery is hidden in a coffin that's being transported across country by train. One complication leads to another, too many to describe here. But what makes the movie so much better than many of its type is that all the crazy parts (and there are many) fit perfectly together. There's some poking fun at Hollywood, Richard Nixon, small-town politics, etc., but it's not at all heavy-handed. It's a well done, well thought out and executed light comedy. Perhaps the best character in the movie is David Wayne as the oldest train conductor in the world. Hilarious!",1145577600,2,882,4.809210526315789
7904269,4,B000006GT3,"This movie should be on a ""must have"" list for anyone who loves movies like Hollywood Knights, Blazing Saddles (or most of Mel Brooks stuff), etc.
While it is very dated it has great perfomances by Beverly D'Angello and Jim Carey.
What crazy goings-on!",972777600,,252,4.75
