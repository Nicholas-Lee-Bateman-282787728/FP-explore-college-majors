1270200,5,B00003CXQ6,"I rented the first 101 Dalmatians, and I didn't think the second one would be as good. BUT I WAS WRONG. The sequel was even funnier than the first movie. The funniest character would have to be the bird. He was raised with other experimental stray dogs and thought he was a Rottweiler. He refused to fly because he said that dogs couldn't fly.
Cruella De Ville (Glen Close) was even funnier in this film. She tried her best to be nice and rehabilitated but lurking under all that black and white outrageous wardrobe and funky hair is the evil woman who's obsessed with making herself a Dalmatian coat. Of course this time, she needs an extra Dalmatian (102) for the making of the head wrapping connected to the coat.
Odd-Ball seems to be the outcast of the new clan of Dalmatians because she did not have her (as they say in the movie as not to make her feel left out) S-P-O-T-S. She recognizes there is a difference between her and her other siblings as well as her parents. She becomes obsessed with S-P-O-T-S. However, Odd-Ball becomes the heroin that saves the day. When Cruella's evil intentions are spotted, Odd-Ball has to rescue the 102 dalmatians before they become another memorabilia stashed in Cruella's closet.
This was one funny movie that even adults will find themselves laughing too!",989280000,,1300,4.681222707423581
1270201,4,B00003CXQ6,"This is as wonderful as its predecessor, 101 dalmatians. Cruella de vil is at last released from prison, after some experiments have been tried on her & proved that her dog-hating days are over. She is now totally changed & orders all her furs to be thrown into the fire. She goes about helping dogs & protests agains killing animals for their fur. (unbelievable, huh??) Though many of them believe in giving her a second chance, Chloe firmly believes that Cruella hasn't changed and boy, is she right! When she hears the gong of Big Ben, somethging happens & the process is reversed. From a dog,-lover, she goes back to a dog-hater. Then the adventure starts. This movie has parts of comedy too, which I'm sure kids will enjoy.",989107200,,728,4.651162790697675
1270202,5,B00003CXQ6,"The sequel to the wildly successful ""101 Dalmatians"" does not disappoint!  The story line is quirky, clever, and features once again, the most talented actress in Hollywood as the demonic Cruella DeVil (Glenn Close).  I usually don't enjoy sequels, but this one is different!  I enjoyed every moment.  Perfect for a family viewing, but enjoyable by adults as well!!",987206400,,365,5.135593220338983
1270203,1,B00003CXQ6,2 thumbs down! even my kid's (6 yr old twins) wanted to leave after an hour. the movie should be called cruella devil returns. the minor part that the puppies did play was cute when of course they showed real puppies and not computer animated. i have all the disney videos( i mean all) but this one will not be added!,986515200,,317,4.213114754098361
1270204,5,B00003CXQ6,"This movie was wonderful. Kid's will love it! Cruella Devil is finally being released from prison. They have experimented on her and assume that she is cured from her dog hatting days. In fact, they have turned her into a dog lover. She even goes out and buys an abandoned dog shelter. Her peroll officer, whos dog's have just had a litter of dalmation puppies including oddball who has no spots, Meets the owner of the shelter and falls in love with him. But when Cruella hears the bells of Big Ben, something goes wrong inside her head and she goes out to get revenge. This time she wants a hooded spotted dalmation puppy coat, hence it will take 102 dalmations to complete it. The only dalmation that isn't captured is Oddball because she has no spots. It's up to her and her parrot friend who thinks he's a dog to follow the kidnappers to France and save the day! Your whole family will love it! Buy it today!",984700800,9,913,4.408284023668639
1270205,4,B00003CXQ6,"This movie is a typically funny Disney romp, and it's a sure thing that your children will love it. Glenn Close once again does a terrific job of portraying the diabolical Cruella.  The addition of the spotless puppy is a cute touch.  I couldn't stop my son from saying ""look at the puppy he lost his spots!"" This movie did not so good at the box office, because of competition(ie: The Grinch & Rugrats),  but don't let that stop you from seeing it now.  102 Dalmations is a must buy for any Disney Fan! A Solid 4 Stars",980899200,3,519,4.26530612244898
1270266,4,B00003CXQ6,I thought it was boring. I didn't hate it I liked Glen close but other than that it was very uninteresting. My kid liked it but it's definitely not a stand out kids movie to me. I haven't seen the first one. The cartoon has always been one of my favorites. This was made before the Disney cartoon remakes got ridiculous. I must say that it has better acting than the Alice in wonderland movie of nothing else.,1501459200,,409,4.256410256410256

The first movie was really good (hilarious) and I felt that this was a great sequel. Oddball's struggles are touching and the Macaw's identity issues are funny. Dogs rule!

I will provide a word of warning though for those looking to purchase this DVD: It is a Region 2 DVD, as stated above in the note just below the buying options.

This time featuring Dip Stick (one of the pups in the first movie) as the father of the new batch of pups they have an adventure through Paris trying to escape the clutches of the evil Cruella De Vil.

1271047,2,B00003CXQ6,"They jettisoned most of the cast from the first remake, giving Glenn Close the staring role as Cruella de Vil.  It's too bad they didn't give her a better role to play.  In this offering, she goes from a supposedly cured, remorseful killer of animals for fur coats to the unreformed wacko who screeches continuously about making a fur coat.  As before, an abundance of slapstick and pratfalls are employed.  Alice Evans (as Chloe Simon) and Ioan Cruffudd (as Kevin Shepherd) are stuck in the thankless roles of a pair of dimwitted lovebirds with a fondness for dogs.  Their only connection to Cruella is through the dog Dipstick, that Chloe the probation officer owns.  And as she is Cruella's probation officer............  Not helping matters is a crazed furrier Jean-Pierre LePelt played with an excruciating lack of comic ability by Gerard Depardieu (I lost track of the number of times his eyes went wild as he mispronounced puppies as ""poopies"").  An air of desperation plagued this entire production.  I literally cringed my way through it (too long at 100 minutes).",1417651200,,1073,4.949720670391062

1271178,3,B00003CXQ6,"I don't really dislike this film.  I could have just as well done without.  It's largely a rehash of the first film, bringing along many of the qualities but less of the original cast.
  Glenn Close was still as menacing as ever.  The scene of her subconsciously reverting to her old ways when hearing the chime of Big Ben was classic for Cruella de Vil.  The Dalmatian spots everywhere might have been overdoing it, but Close saves the scene with her performance.
  Unfortunately, the rest of the cast is again decent but largely forgettable...I'm looking up everyone's names as I'm writing this.  The butler Alonzo, played again by Tim McInnerny, the only other returning cast member, gets a bigger role and he's somewhat amusing in it, though he doesn't quite fill the shoes of the two thugs from the last film.  The fur designer, Jean Pierre Le Pelt, played by Grard Depardieu, was supposed to be eccentric, but that largely fell flat.  An exception would have to be the driving scene in Paris.  I loved how he and Cruella complained about the driving skills of everyone around them, including Alonzo.
  I think I might have liked this film more if there had been more of a connection among the protagonists to the first film...the antagonists are fine on that front.  Our new female lead, Chloe Simon, played by Alice Evans, has adopted one of the original fifteen puppies from the first film, Dipstick, and a previously unknown mate named Dotty, who have bred a litter of their own.  Okay, I got no impression that Rodger and Anita planned to give up any of their many dogs in the first film?  How did Chloe find them and convince them otherwise?  And why would it be one of the puppies that their original dogs actually brought into this world?  All these questions and more will not be answered and therein lies my problem.  I cannot make a connection with Chloe or this guy named Kevin Shepherd, played by Ioan Gruffudd, who has become the film's male lead as he runs an animal shelter.  His parrot is kind of funny, but that does not save this group.
  If you liked the first film, you'll probably have luke-warm feelings about this one.  I was under whelmed and my DVD's currently in a box somewhere.  I'll leave the purchasing decision up to you.  Enjoy.",1405036800,2,2266,4.616541353383458

1271648,5,B00003CXQ6,"""102 Dalmatians"" offers audiences more of one of the most wicked creatures in motion pictures, the outrageous and evil Cruella DeVille. Like the original movie, Glenn Close who plays Cruella, steals the film and this is not an easy task, what with the beautiful dogs, wonderful special effects, and great story. The film producers knew that to harbor Cruella in one film wasn't enough so a sequel was evident. In this outing Cruella is released from prison after being cured of her addiction to killing dogs to fulfill her fantasy of making a coat. However, it is only a matter of time before Cruella's evil ways start to emerge and she eventually resorts back to her old ways, but this time not only does she want a coat made out of dalmatian fur, but she also wants a hood. The movie is hilarious, funny, sad, and over the top, but most of all entertaining. ""102 Dalmatinas"" wasn't as successful as the original, but it became an even bigger hit thanks to the home video market. This DVD has many bonuses, among them a deleted scene called ""Cruella's Release"", a Behind-The-Scenes Featurette, and audio commentary by director Kevin Lima. The movie also has some beautiful costumes that Glenn Close wears.",1255651200,2,1206,4.77511961722488

It's nice to find a movie that isn't violent and this is hard now.  It seems that there aren't many movies that kids can watch now.  Even a few of the Disney movies aren't that good.

I thought the actors Glen Close, Ioan Gruffudd and Alice Evans were terrific in this movie.  I liked it as much as the original 101 Dalmations.  I thought little Oddball was adorable!! I'd like to find a puppy just like her.  My son has been asking for one.

1271651,5,B00003CXQ6,It was a Christmas present. I had 101 Dalmations and they wanted to see 102. It was a good story and showed that people care about dogs and were willing to give them homes and not death.,1232323200,,186,4.054054054054054
1271652,3,B00003CXQ6,"Sequels and remakes are for the most part unnecessary uses of celluloid and so it is no surprise that ""102 Dalmatians"", the sequel to the 1996 remake of ""101 Dalmatians"", is no exception. Cruella De Vil (Glenn Close) is back, but this time around the script has left her stuck in the middle somewhere between heavy villainess and slapstick antagonist. The end result is borderline pathetic.

The story begins with Cruella De Vil being brainwashed by scientists to feel love and affection when she sees a dog much like Dr. Pavlov conditioned his canine subjects to salivate at the sound of a ringing bell. She is released on probation under the skeptical eye of her parole officer Chloe (Alice Evans), who incidentally loves Dalmatians. When Cruella becomes involved with a local animal shelter run by Kevin (Ioan Gruffudd), it seems that she has become completely reformed, but upon the ringing of Big Ben (the biggest Pavlovian bell of them all) she inevitably reverts to her old ways and is soon scheming and screaming for the Dalmatian coat she has wanted for so long and the main frame of the original plot comes back into focus.

I will never know why movies like this use this method of storytelling. Of course money plays a big role, but if film sequels and remakes broke free of the originals they are based, who knows what the story possibilities could hold for the industry. Instead of using the original as a crutch, the film-makers could have turned ""102 Dalmatians"" into a character study of Cruella De Vil, or taken the story to new heights instead of reusing old plot devices. They could have even went back to the hand-drawn animation format, which is better suited for the material in the first place.

Another crucial flaw has been carried over from the previous film. Instead of getting top billing, the animal characters are turned into secondary characters and used either as MacGuffins or slapstick. Even Oddball, a Dalmatian puppy who grows insecure due to a lack of spots, does not generate the same wattage as the original cartoon puppies did back in 1961. This affects not only the suspense, but also the overall participation of the audience. If nobody cares for the animals, the entire story is derailed.

""102 Dalmatians"" is not a bad film. Like all Disney productions, there is an inherent charm throughout and fun is never lacking. Gerard Depardieu as Monsieur Le Pelt, whose outlandish costumes give Cruella's a run for her money, is a brilliant addition to the saga. The productionis also worthy of praise particularly the scenes in Cruella's gothic home, which is unfortunately underused.

Glenn Close once again gives a tour de force performance, but Ms. De Vil is a star in her own right and cannot be embodied by an actress of flesh and blood. She belongs in a world without boundaries or conventions. She belongs in the animated world.",1226966400,2,2873,4.83130081300813
1271653,2,B00003CXQ6,"I really had high hopes for this one; Glenn Close reprising her role as Cruella and Grard Depardieu as her costar. However, it really is just more of the same, and sadly even sillier than the first. This time, Close is just too over-the-top to really be as delicious as she was in the first outing. Even the slapstick at the end as she gets her comeuppance from the animals (again) is not as funny. The romantic leads are duller than dishwater as well, and there is no Joan Plowright to add an extra dollop of much needed class and humor. Still, from reading the other reviews on Amazon, there must be a place in people's hearts for this film...I would guess that children (very young children) might find it amusing, although some of the plot material is a little unsettling: plenty of talk about killing animals and taxidermy, red paint thrown at a fur coat to simulate blood during an animal protest, as well as some of the prison/makeshift psychiatric hospital scenes thatare also disturbing.

On to the plot: years after the first movie, Cruella has spent time in a prison facility where she has been undergoing psychiatric treatment (including electro-shock therapy) to make her have an aversion to fur coats. Her successful treatment allows her to be paroled, and she is back on the streets. Coincidentally, her parole officer Chloe owns Dipstick, one of the Dalmatians that Cruella terrorized in the first movie. During her first appointment with Chloe, Cruella coincidentally notices a photo of an animal shelter on Chloe's desk and decides to be its benefactor. Dipstick & Dottie (Chloe's other dalmatian) also (coincidentally) are about to have a litter of pups...just in time for Cruella's treatment to wear off during visit #2 to Chloe, when the sounding of Big Ben's clock chimes (which coincidentally happens just as she is sitting in Chloe's office where her dalmatians just coincidentally happen to be roosting at the moment). Who wrote this crap?!?

Now that she is back into fur coats again, Cruella drags out Anita's sketch of the infamous dalmatian fur coat from movie #1 and decides she wants 102 dalmatians this time...enough to make a hood, too. She teams up with furrier Jean-Pierre LePelt (Depardieu). Jean-Pierre is a cross between a punk-rocker and Liberace...not really sure where the writers were going with this character.

Naturally, there is chemistry between Chloe and the owner of the animal shelter (at least on script there is), and they team up to keep Cruella from killing the dalmatians for her new coat.

Although the story is lacking, the special effects are wonderful. The costume, hair, and set designers did a spectacular job as well...if only the story had been as carefully planned. Sigh...

On a bright note, this DVD really has some amazing extras, which is surprising since the new release of the live action&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/101-Dalmatians/dp/B001B1T7BU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">101 Dalmatians</a>&nbsp;is totally devoid of extras. Here's what you get:

*Deleted scene: ""Cruella's Release,"" which shows more details about what happens as she is getting out of prison...amusing, but not really missed from the movie.

1271654,5,B00003CXQ6,"I am SO EXCITED that this movie has finally been released on DVD. I think it was released on DVD, maybe 8 years ago, but it has been GONE since, and trying to find it online has resulted in serious sticker shock. (The cheapest I had seen it was in the neighborhood of fifty dollars!) and I have been looking for this movie since my daughter was born 6 years ago because I love this movie. This movie is incredibly cute, and though I love the first movie (the live action 101 Dalmations), I actually like this one more. Glenn Close is brilliantly evil, the animal talent is adorable, and Gerard Depardieu is hilarious as a fur favoring fashion designer. This movie is full of pratfalls and physical comedy, but never ""mean"" or inappropriate or tasteless. This is a perfect family film that everyone can laugh at, and the comedy shines through to every age group.",1220918400,9,861,4.5256410256410255
1271655,5,B00003CXQ6,"I have to start this by saying that I am usually not a fan of sequals, but 102 Dalmatians is definitely an exception.  I am happy that it is being released again as it is one of my favorite movies.  Most reviews tend to have no-name actors who you might seeing doing a TV commercial, but this has a great cast including Glenn Close, Ioan Gruffudd, Tom McInnerney, Ian Richardson, Eric Idle (as a talking parrot who thinks it is a dog) and Gerard Depardieu.  I would highly recommend this movie to any who has small children and loves a cute transformation story gone wrong.",1216771200,,573,4.438095238095238
1271656,3,B00003CXQ6,"I didn't expect to like this movie, but it turned out to be entertaining and kind of cute, a solid 3 star offering - and it's definitely just right for the kids. Adults will find the plot transparently obvious and standardly Disney-predictable, but then it *is* supposed to be a kids' movie! If nothing else, grownups, get it to watch the usually serious Ioan Gruffudd (Horatio Hornblower and Fantastic Four) play tug-of-war with his dogs and get made fun of by his parrot, who was voiced by the incomparable Eric Idle.",1123113600,3,519,4.714285714285714
1271687,5,B00003CXQ6,My Grandma gave this movie to me and I really wanted to see it. I watched it and it was great. Cruella just gets released from jail and she tries to be nice because she dosen't want to go to jail again. Eventually she becomes mean and tries to kills the puppies once again. They end up at a cake factory and they cook Cruella. I enjoyed watching this movie. I think anyone should get it. A great film!,1118361600,15,401,4.0886075949367084
1271688,3,B00003CXQ6,"101 DALMATIANS, the original animated film, is one of my favorites from childhood that I still relish as an adult now.  It had charm, wit, marvelous voicing and the indomitable Cruella DeVil.  The live action feature which preceded this sequel was okay, thanks mainly to the dynamically overblown and convincing Glenn Close in the role of Cruella.  This sequel to that live action version is mindless entertainment, with a few clever and cute scenes, but it is basically a rehash of the original plot, with again Ms. Close obviously having a jolly good time going bonkers on screen.  Gerard Depardieu was embarrassing to watch as Le Pelt, and the human leads (Alice Evans, Ioan Grufford) are too cardboard to care about.  Tim McInnerny as Cruella's manservant was very enjoyable in his role, and even though the macaw finally got too cutesy, he was fun for a while.  Close's costumes and hairdos were splendid fun, and it is to her credit that this movie is as fun as it is, it should've been a bomb, but Close keeps it afloat.",1111708800,2,1027,4.709497206703911

1271690,1,B00003CXQ6,I thought it would be a delightful flick with cute pupies running away from a nasty lady but it's not that way. old tired jokes get used agan agan and agan. BOTTOM LINE: it stinks,1076544000,,179,4.142857142857143
1271691,1,B00003CXQ6,"This movie was terrible. The plot is very thin, even for kids, and Grard Depardieu is a real flop. (Why isn't his PR photo from this movie at the mulletsgalore.com website?) The leading couple is cuter and more believable than the current issue 101 movie, but their love story is poorly written and very superficial.
The maccaw should have been named Jar Jar instead of Waddlesworth -- it was pointless, annoying, and dropped my raiting from two stars down to one.
Go to some garage sales and find the original children's books. Read to your children; don't buy this movie.",1041638400,4,573,4.74

Cruella joins the 2nd chance animal shelter where the owner (Ioan Grudd) is fooled by Cruella's new ways. Now, you would have to be dumb to fall for that Cruella is crued. Roger, Anita, Horace and Jasper are not in this film. And if you didn't like one or more of those characters you may like this movie.

1271693,4,B00003CXQ6,"Upfront, it should be noted that ""102 Dalmatians"" is far darker and more violent than the original - either the live action or animated versions.  That said, this is one of those rare sequels that actually surpasses the first film in a number of ways.  First, the story is less ingrained in our heads, so its fresher and unexpectedly more effective.  Second, there are plot twists to rival a gangster flick, with Cruella DeVil first framed as a puppy lover, and then as the nasty character we all love to hate.  Third - and most impressive - is Glenn Close, who chews up every scene here in a Golden Globe nominated performance that makes her far scarier and more effective as a villain.  She's almost channeling the spirit of Alex in ""Fatal Attraction"" with her vile manner and spitted dialogue.  This is an actress at the top of her form - part Alex and part Norma Desmond (who she played to raves, and a Tony Award, in ""Sunset Boulvard.)  Bluntly said, Close gives a tremendous performance as the puppy-coat wearing diva - it's high camp at its best, and she makes the film soar in unexpected, hystrionic ways.  This Ella-Cruella is one of a kind.",1018396800,,1150,4.575609756097561
1271694,2,B00003CXQ6,"The idea of movie sequels took off thirty years ago and has been going nonstop ever since. As an idea, it makes sense. TV series have conditioned several generations of viewers to want to see the same characters and often essentially the same story over and over again. A movie sequel is usually a fairly safe financial bet, as it can be expected, on average, to take in about seventy percent of the original's gross. So, it was only natural that Disney wanted to cash in on the success of the live action version of 101 Dalmatians. The result, 102 Dalmatians, failed. There were several reasons for this, but the main one may be that the original story is self-contained. Despite the sequel's attempts to be different, in the end it all boils down to the same thing: Cruella DeVille will go to any lengths to obtain the puppies from which she plans to make a Dalmatian fur coat.
This time Cruella has been rehabilitated by a doctor aptly named Pavlov. Chloe [Alice Evans], her probabtion officer, doesn't buy the change, but Cruella [""Call me Ella, not Cruella!""]really does act like a changed woman. She has Alonso [Tim McInnerny], her manservant, lock away her fur coats, since the sight of them now makes her sick. She buys a failing animal shelter and transforms it into a showplace. She even has her own dog, a dreadful thing that looks like a rat. [Why on earth they decided to make this particular dog her pet is beyond me.] The world adores Cruella. One day something happens that reverses the effects of her rehab. Cruella is back with a vengeance, and some of the finest Dalmatian puppies happen to belong to Chloe. As in the original, every character but Cruella fumbles everything, and, for the most part, it's up to the dogs to save themselves.
Glenn Close again plays Cruella. Again she is delightful. But a great star turn does not a great movie make. 102 Dalmatians is predictable and overblown. Many of the jokes are best understood by adults, but this is the kind of movie grownups use to baby-sit their children, who won't get much of the humor. There are a lot of cute dogs and other animals, but they lack the charm of the ones in other kids movies such as Babe. With the exception of a truly obnoxious parrot, none of them can talk, yet all of them are shown to have the fully developed emotions of human beings. Personally, I find this makes them a bit creepy. There is also something odd about the movie. There is not a single human character younger than thirty. What kind of children's movie has no children in it? The original didn't, but it was itself a clever remake of what was essentially a long cartoon. Perhaps this sequel would have been more successful if it had had kids in it for kids to relate to.
102 Dalmatians will divert the young ones, but it is not something they will wish to see over and over again. It is one of Disney's weaker efforts. And, yes, I do like dogs.",1016236800,13,2910,4.513257575757576

I'm a kid in an adult body-I will admit it- but I think both kids and adults will enjoy this film. And I enjoyed it better than the first 'live' 101 Dalmatian movie. My favorite character in the movie is Waddlesworth who acts like a rott but is really a parrot but don't tell him that!!
This movie has more laughs and giggles than it does sneers. After all, it is a Disney movie, made for kids and BIG kids. The Dalmatians mission, as with the other movie-is to stop Cruella and her evil ways. Yes, everyone knows how it ends (as it does with all Disney movies) but you'll find enjoyment in between!!

It had it's very high and very low points.  There is this parrot in the movie that almost makes it a must see.  He is so funny, but the plot is so rambling disconnected that it is almost no fun to watch between the parrot scenes.  Some points in the plot I would say is just total cheap duplication, but some points are drastically different and really boarding on good, but it always seemed that as soon as they got close to good they'd jump away.  The characters didn't feel intense to me anymore.  It seemed like a cheap shadow of the first.",1008201600,,701,4.265151515151516

1271790,2,B00003CXQ6,"Someone please tell me what the point of this film was? The 1996 film 101 Dalmatians was a remake and now they're doing a sequel to a remake? That is seriously quite odd. Even though this movie is much better than 101 Dalmatians from 1996, I still don't really see a reason to sequelize the movie. Anyway I really didn't see much values in this family film, apart from good ol' Glenn Close and the dogs. Yes, the dogs are still very cute and make the movie bearable enough. However, the story is absurd, the typical predictability deal is here in this movie and I didn't laugh very much. Apart from the ending where Cruella literally gets baked, this film is pretty much comedy-free. Kids will find it hard to laugh at this flick and to generally enjoy this film too. Even they're little minds will not be tricked by the movies dotty silliness. Adults will be dragged along by kids to see this sequel, but I'm sure none of them will think too much of it. Sure, 102 Dalmatians has some good points - the groovy opening song, Glenn Close's excellent performance, the funny ending and the cuteness of the dogs - but ultimately it doesn't succeed. This is a sequel that you will only be bothered watching while you're one a plane or a boat or something just to pass the time. I'll ask again, someone please tell me the point of this movie?

Where is ""especially the other stars of the movie"" Pongo and Perita aka the proud parents of the original dalmations? I felt so sorry for Glenn Close and all of the garbage and disgusting acts she had to do. The new characters are much worst and they had too many of them. Oh God please save me from that Auston Powers wanna be parrot. He was so annoying and he tried to steal the movie from everyone but Cruelella and the puppies still hung in there of course. I think Le Pelt has a real wardrobe problem. The butler is the average stero type which he sides with the bad guys but later on he realizes it is wrong and joins up with the good guys. I think Glen Close is more of a comedian than a very evil vilaness but however she makes a great match up Cruella DeVil like the animation movie. A lot of dogs in the movie was bearly used or not used at all. The previews ruined the entire movie by showing way too many clips of the climax: Cruelella disgustingly getting turned into a giant cake. Anyway the real winner in the entire movie was actually Glenn Close. In fact I heard from a certain source that Glenn took home a giant fortune of money for playing the part as Cruellella. Even though the sequel was not good, I hope that they will make another movie with the Dalmatians and Glen Close.
