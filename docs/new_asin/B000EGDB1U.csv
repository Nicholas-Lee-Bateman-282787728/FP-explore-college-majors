8109058,4,B000EGDB1U,"What i liked  about this movie was that the actors(characters) seem liked real people that I've seen and known.  Often you don't see that in an action film such as this.  There was plenty of action for sure (every other second almost),  but you  could relate to the characters, ( especially the main character) whose dream was so true to life.  As a released criminal, he was  trying to do what is almost impossible for most released from prison today , that is, he was trying to rejoin society.",1152921600,10,495,4.49438202247191
