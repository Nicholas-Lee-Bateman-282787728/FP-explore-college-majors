8573307,3,B00BSGTVPU,"The cruelty of the Nazis and the cleverness of the Czech resistance is portrayed in this film. The Nazis search for an assassin while the Czechs scheme to hide his identity. A propaganda movie filmed during WWII, there is generally good acting with cruelty and torture on the part of the Nazis, and courageous collaboration on the part of the resistance movement among the Czechs. A mildly interesting film which shows its age, but it is watchable.",1469750400,,448,4.8311688311688314
