6757049,3,B00OMCLJXY,"Certainly not a candidate for a box office hit and, in fact, a rather depressing story of life in a nursing home. It may appeal to some pessimistic elderly viewers but doesn't present a very optimist picture of old age. Good acting. Bearable.",1482883200,4,242,4.651162790697675
6757050,5,B00OMCLJXY,"A somewhat depressing movie, especially for us old folks, but true to life.  It was worth watching.",1482537600,,99,4.823529411764706

6757052,5,B00OMCLJXY,An interesting movie. Good acting. About some characters in a retirement home and there interactions with one another. Sort of a tear jerker ending.,1481932800,,148,5.208333333333333
6757053,4,B00OMCLJXY,Good portrayal of the realities of aging.  Excellent acting.,1481846400,,60,5.666666666666667
6757054,3,B00OMCLJXY,I'm a big fan of the actors in this movie. It's a story of aging and the descent into the end of life. Sadly the story has no point to make. It is interesting to watch just for the characters in it. There is no elder abuse here just the sadness of the aging process. Worth watching for the actors but the story was a bit flat for me.,1479600000,4,333,3.8405797101449277

6757090,3,B00OMCLJXY,"I cant really write an honest review as it seems this video was withdrawn by Amazon before I finished watching.  Also, what little at the beginning I did watch I had trouble understanding the dialogue as my hearing is not as good as it once was so I may not have finished watching it anyway.",1435363200,,291,4.290909090909091
8684249,1,B00OMCLJXY,"Too long and depressing  I couldn't finish.
The movie probably has a good point, but unfortunately,  I couldn't watch the last 20 minutes to ""get it"".
I did like ""Alice"" and wondered what would happen to her.",1533945600,,208,4.594594594594595
8684250,1,B00OMCLJXY,Why do Hollywood made movies have to be so harsh and ill mannered? The story may be good but the way it is portrayed by the actors is jarring to my ears and that is why I prefer British movies at least the older ones; the newer British movies are becoming too much like the American ones.,1530921600,,288,4.0701754385964914
8684251,4,B00OMCLJXY,"I wasn't sure if I wanted to watch this one or not. There was no ""preview"" so thought I'd just take a chance and if I didn't like it I'd just turn it off and look for something else. Am I glad I did check it out! Such a very good movie, depicting real life aging. Maybe younger audience might not like it but us old timers sure will. We're wise after all. :)  Anyway....very good acting, great story. Give it a try. It's a sweet movie.",1512259200,2,435,4.0
