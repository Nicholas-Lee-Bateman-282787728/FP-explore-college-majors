2123165,2,B0002V7U28,"Every Celtics fan I've ever met lives hopelessly in the past.  To them, the clock stopped when Larry Bird retired.  Their hoops knowledge from 1956 to 1992 is impeccable.  After that, they don't know squat.  Ergo, the notion that this DVD set is the ""complete history"" of the Boston Celtics is a total fallacy.

The C's had an unbelievable run (16 titles in 30 years, including 8 straight from 1959 to 1966), but that run is LONG since over.  Boston was once the New York Yankees of basketball, now they're lucky just to make it to the playoffs in the depleted Eastern Conference.

I once saw a C's game at the FleetCenter during the last days of the Rick Pitino era.  The arena was half-empty (the city of Boston had long since abandoned the team) and I could barely hear myself think over the sound of 138-year-old Red Auerbach's knocking on death's door.  It's sad how the mighty have fallen!

Further illustrating how things have changed in Boston, I attended a Lakers-Celtics game at the FleetCenter in the spring of 2001 (the Shaq-Kobe era) and discovered--to my surprise--that one-third of those in attendance were wearing Laker gear.

So, it's understandable that C's fans would rather focus on Bird & McHale (even if Bill Russell was the greatest-ever Celtic) rather than Paul Pierce's selfish ballhogging and declining basketball skills.  There really are some terrific games to be watched on this DVD set; games that are justifiably famous.

So, Celtics fan, keep living in the past if you so desire.  The Boston Garden--and the Celtic mystique--are dead.  Long live the FleetCenter!...or Bank of America Arena or whatever it's called.",1105833600,5,1646,4.891696750902527
2123166,5,B0002V7U28,"I own Larry Bird: Living Legend on DVD and bought this one for my uncle, who is also an avid Celtics fan. Im only 18 so I cant really appreciate as much the Celtics of old...Russel, Cousy, Heinson, Jonses, Cowens, Havlicek, etc., and Im probably too old to give a crap anymore about the ""Pierce era,"" mostly b/c theyve sucked for so long, but it was the Larry era that really did it for me.  I don't care who says what, Larry and Magic defined basketball.  The 80's and perhaps early 90's was the greatest I've ever seen basketball get.  And the '86 Celtics was the best team in NBA history. I personally haven't seen the Celtics Dynasty DVDs but being that they include 7 past games, 5 of which are during the 80's, I'd buy it in a heartbeat.  Like Red said, ""I've been blessed to coach some of the greatest that ever played the game. But if I had to start a team today...the greatest player, and the one I'd take would be Larry Bird.""",1104105600,6,936,4.271186440677966
2123167,5,B0002V7U28,"The Celtics and the Lakers are the two leading teams in the NBA in that era. The championship series between them in 1984 & 1985 are classics. The competitive spirit among the players brought about the best showtime in NBA history.

The Celtics in the 80s is really a team to behold. Bird, McHale, Parish, Johnson and Ainge are simply legendary in their exploits of the game. With the addition of Bill Walton, the 1986 Boston Celtics ranked as my favourite basketball team in NBA.

It is so unfortunate to see the NBA declining since then. How I wish that there could be more players like Bird, Magic, Kareem and McHale in the current NBA.",1103587200,5,639,4.547826086956522

5 Greatest Games in Celtics History, in their entirety

Celtics unprecedented 16 championships will be covered in this DVD

Over 21 hours of content

Over the past 50 years the Celtics have won an unprecedented 16 World Championships including 8 in a row from 1959-1966, making them the the most storied franchise in NBA history. This 5-disc special edition collector's set features the complete Boston Celtics history including year-end compilation programs highlighting the Championship seasons.

2123207,1,B0002V7U28,"I was psyched to watch a classic game, it even included pre game stuff,but 30 minutes in the dvd started to crap out.  It happened again with the second dvd I tried. I am too frustrated to try to watch the other DVD's.  It's sad that there is no quality control on a the dvd's",1335484800,,276,4.0
2123208,5,B0002V7U28,"basketball as it used to be--Cousy leading a fast break with Russell or Heinsohn trailing.  Cousy may throw a pass over his head or behind his back to the trailing player because it is the best way to get the ball there.  NOT for style points.  A dunk was used as needed--up, in the hoop and back down.  NOT for style.  It still counted for two points.  On offense, the ball moves quickly around to the open shooter, the shot goes up and it usually 10-12 seconds instead of the point guard dribbling, dribbling and dribbling then makes one pass and then a shot.  THree other players stand around and watch.  Now a team scoring 100 points is having a good offensive night even with the three point shot.  In the time of the Celtics reign, 100 points might be an off night.  A blocked shot by Russell would go to another Celtic, not smacked into the third row of seats and followed by chest pounding.  These discs will show you how basketball should be played--five players working together, not the showtime, fundamentally poor, one-on-one nonsense call pro basketball today.  They were really the good, old days--teamwork and fundamentals were a given.  Get this five disk set",1329523200,2,1176,4.6231884057971016
2123209,5,B0002V7U28,"Here's the deal with box sets, they are overwhelming to watch let alone review. So, first off, Discs 1 and 2 are basically the former NBA championship videos converted to DVD. Great stuff, especially to see a bunch of the other teams (enjoyed brief glimpses of the KC-Omaha Kings or the Cavs with some serious yellow going on back then) and also to see those classic interview clips. One moot point is the music on the ""Home of the Brave: 86/7 season"" is so beyond Miami Vice cheesy, but it's about the only thing flawed in the whole setup. Seeing Kevin McHale hanging with Nils Lofgren in his hotel room is beyond bizarro, too. Don't ask...just watch the clip when it shows up.

You also have to see John Havlicek and Don Nelson dribbling through a Boston sporting goods store in a TV ad for the same in one of the '70s sections. The old clips of the '50s thru '70s were the best, and the quality is not bad given the technology of the time.

Discs 3 thru 5 are full games bar the 1969 Finals Game 7 which is just the 4th quarter of Celtics-Lakers, but who cares? Just to see Bill Russell vs. Wilt Chamberlain (and Jerry West and Elgin Baylor!) for even a 12-minute quarter was enough to satisfy. The choice of games is almost spot on. They don't just pick games from the Finals nor always the deciding game so you had someone who knows the right games to pick.

Having said that, the Rockets-Celtics Game 4 from the 1986 Finals was a kind of nothing game. They really needed to replace that with the famous Dominique Wilkins vs. Larry Bird mano a mano in the 1988 East SF, game 7 as after all there is never going to be an Atlanta Hawks box set...then again, who knew the Spurs would become a dynasty?

Anyway, for any basketball fan (bar maybe Lakers fans), this has plenty to keep you occupied for hours on end.",1321056000,,1815,4.345132743362832
2123210,5,B0002V7U28,"I personally think that this Dynasty set is probably the best.  I mean from a basketball fanatics standpoint the team in the 80's (The Cheif, Mchale, Bird, Ainge, Johnson) was one of the most selfless team minded basketball teams ever.  Granted the Lakers at this same time had the same mentality it was just mesmerizing to see these guys battle it out.  Not the fact that it has some old school footage as well.  I do wish they put a bit of the Hawks/Celtics playoff games but i understand why they couldnt, it would have been quite alot of footage for one set.  But the highlight is truly getting to see the 80's brawls between two of the greatest basketball teams ever assembled.  I put this one in front of the Lakers Dynasty set only because it has a bit more valuable footage.  A must buy for not only Celtics fans....but mostly for any basketball fan of any kind.",1314748800,2,870,4.433962264150943
2123211,5,B0002V7U28,I bought this DVD set for my husband's January birthday.  I ordered it 3 days before Christmas - it came so quickly I gave it to him for a late Christmas present instead!!  All of the DVDs we have watched so far have been very enjoyable!  I appreciate the service and the quality of things ordered from Amazon.  Thank you!,1295740800,,322,4.316666666666666
2123212,5,B0002V7U28,purchased this as a christmas gift for my husband who is very difficult to shop for; he hasn't had time yet to watch the dvd's but i'm sure it will bring him great pleasure to relive those great celtic moments...,1295308800,,212,4.325
2123213,3,B0002V7U28,"Okay, I have been a Celtics fan for many years, and was really excited to get this. I was disappointed. It begins with a team history, which is interesting enough. It just neglects to mention the time when the team was formed and almost folded. Then you have a few segments about their 70's playoff runs. Again, these are fun to watch. It is interesting to see the difference in the television coverage back then.
  Then the problems begin. The golden years of the 80's when the Big Three played should be a highlight, but at the time, NBA films made their videos with this dopey background music. So you are watching this great footage of Celtics games, and instead of the raucous Boston Garden crowd, Johnny Most making the calls, sounds of the game, you get this lousy music playing while the voiceover speaks. The best part of these segements are the few moments when you hear Johnny Most and Garden crowd. It is fun to watch the players and coaches of the day, and to see the short shorts that were in style at the time. Curiously, the trade that brought DJ to the team is never mentioned.
  Then you have some of the best Celtic games presented in their entirety, and for me that is the problem. Who wants to sit through an entire basketball game that was played 25 or 40 years ago, when you know what the result will be? Why do I want to watch free throws that were attempted in 1986? That is a waste of my time. Give me the highlights and the game action. What they should have done was edit together highlights of the games with a voiceover describing the dramatic moments, crowd noise in the background, the sounds of the game. If they had done that, this would be a terrific collection.
  As it is, this is a decent set that does have some good points, but overall, it could have been much better.",1294876800,3,1808,4.382089552238806
2123214,5,B0002V7U28,"The videos were outstanding quality given the games were over 25 years ago.  Very hard to believe, but yes it's been that long !  The history of the team was interesting, as the celebratory videos from 81 and 86.  The games they chose were pretty good, but I would've liked to have seen one or two more of the Pistons Eastern Conference championship, instead of two Finals games vs the Rockets.  Those were good in that they won championships as a result, but we all know the Lakers games are classic, but those Celts-Pistons battles from the late 80's are sort of a forgotten gem.  The one in the set is Game 7 from the 87 eastern finals...The one where Robert Parrish clocks Bill Laimbeer blatantly, and doesn't get called for it...Anyway, if you're a Celtics fan, this is a must have...",1264032000,,789,4.528169014084507
2123215,5,B0002V7U28,"As the sports DVD boom continues, the NBA shows it is head and shoulders above all the major professional sports in this field. While MLB and NHL DVD's give you the full games but lack bonus features; the NFL has also done this with the NFL teams and they started strong with the elite teams (Steelers, Packers, Cowboys, etc) they have watered it down and given less bang with your buck.

The NBA through NBA TV created ""The Dynasty Series"" and its continued excellence wins again with ""The Boston Celtics""

When your purchase this set you get 5 dual discs (discs that have material on both sides) which allows you to have close to 22 hours of material.

If you purchase at Wal-Mart or hear at Amazon you will spend no more than $25-$30 for this set. That is a beyond a great deal. Unlike the competitor leagues this NBA series not only gives you documentaries but full games.

This set gives you the ""Celtic Dynasty"" which is an hour documentary on the Celtics rise to basketball supermacy. You get a bunch of other featurettes that concern Celtic playoff runs in the 1970's and 1980's.

What is the meat and potatos of this set is the games you receive the:

*1969 NBA Finals Game 7 Celtics-Lakers - 4th quarter only

*1976 NBA Finals Game 5 Celtics-Suns - the legendary game that went multiple OTs

*1981 NBA Eastern Conference Finals Game 7 Celtics-Sixers - Larry Bird matures and guides the Celtics to an Game 7 victory over Dr. J

*1984 NBA Finals Games 4 and 7 Celtics-Lakers - Bird and Magic's first meeting in the NBA Finals and you get 2 great games

*1986 NBA Finals Game 4 Celtics-Rockets - The Celtics steamroll the Twin Towers

*1987 NBA Eastern Conference Finals Game 5 Celtics-Pistons - Larry Bird steals the ball

If you are a new Celtics fan looking for material from their recent championship run with ""The Boston 3-Party"" you will be disappointed this is an older set, but if you love Celtics and know someone who enjoys great baseketball this is a must buy.",1248739200,4,1978,4.556497175141243
2123216,5,B0002V7U28,Brillant dvd pack with all the best plays of Celtic basketball and the added bonus of Bird vs Magic. This is the way basketball should be played -entertaining TEAM basketball. Great viewing for all Celtic & basketball fans.,1234396800,,223,4.894736842105263

My favorite segment of the entire series had to have been Game #7, as won by the Celts over the Lakers, in 1969, as Bill Russell and Sam Jones were retiring.  You get 4th Quater and post-game only.  As a grade-schooler, I was not allowed to stay up late enough, on a Monday night, to watch this game live from Los Angeles.  In those days the networks lacked the ""juice,"" to get weekday games from out west slotted into ""prime time.""  That game may have tipped off at 10:30 p.m. EST -- way too late for me, then !!  So I love seeing it now.

Pass the word ... the Celts are back !!",1215907200,7,1686,4.422077922077922
2123218,5,B0002V7U28,"This five-disc set chronicles the history of the Boston Celtics, the National Basketball Association's most successful franchise.

The first two discs contain miscellaneous features highlighting the complete history of the team, from the early days of the NBA to today.  There is footage covering the Russell-led teams of the Fifties and Sixties, and coverage of the mid-1970s title teams.  Also included are the championship videos describing the titles that the team won in the 1980s.

The last three discs contain portions of games or complete games as they were originally broadcast from the 1969, 1976, 1981, 1984, and 1986 title drives, as well as Game 5 of the 1987 Eastern Conference Finals when Larry Bird stole the Isiah Thomas pass to preserve what ultimately led to another trip to the NBA Finals.

This set contains some of the greatest basketball ever played.  Owners of this set will be able to see, in the old Celtic clubs and the squads that they faced in these games, some of the greatest teams in NBA history.  And what Celtics fan wouldn't love to have Game 7 of the 1984 NBA Finals in all its glory on DVD?",1207267200,,1127,4.778350515463917
2123219,5,B0002V7U28,"This collection is a must for celtic fans. Unfortunately 5 DVDs can not cover the entire history of a team that has won 16 NBA titles. The games presented in their entirety are mostly from the 80s (Bird, Parish, McHale era) with the addition of the triple overtime classic of 1976 against the Suns. One could argue that one game against the Milwalky Bucks during the 79s could have made it to the collection. It is also a pity that no whole game from the Russell era made it to the set in it' s entirety, but probably the 60's footage wasn' t that good to be included in the DVD, and the documentaries included make up for that omission.

On the technical side, there are very few technical hitches and the games are presented in their original broadcast (not as shown in the NBA's greatest games show, as for example in the Lakers box set)",1178668800,,840,4.384615384615385

2123221,5,B0002V7U28,"Or if you are a fan of selfless play, super passing and true teamwork; I started becoming a fan of NBA basketball in the early 80's and so I was spoiled by the Lakers-Celtics rivalry and their unique brands of basketball.  I still think the '86 Celtics are the best team ever and would have beaten the Lakers handily even if they had managed to get past the Rockets that year.  They were a true team and were almost machine-like in the way they got the job done, methodically dissecting their opponents.

And so, while us long-suffering Celtic fans wait for the next Larry Bird, we have this dvd set to keep us company and to remember where and how this team came about on 5 discs.  As the game footage come from deteriorated master tapes, the visual quality isn't perfect but is still good enough to enjoy.

Recommended.",1153872000,4,821,4.483221476510067
2123222,4,B0002V7U28,"...especially when it is as full of pride and tradition embodied by the Boston Celtics.  This DVD set preserves so many priceless moments in the history of the franchise, highlighting nearly all of Celtics' great eras.

The documentaries are a little light on actual Celtics footage and history...

For example, the chapter on the 1984 season covers the All-Star game and the number of Johnson's playing in the NBA that year, and glosses over non-Celtics playoff series up until the historic NBA Finals between the Larry-led Celtics and Magic-led Lakers... although the footage and commentary of the Finals is superb.

Likewise, the 1986 chapter has a whole segment on Hakeen Olajuwon's bio and doesn't really put the spotlight on the Celtics until the playoffs.

(By contrast, the Video Yearbook of the 1985-86 Celtics titled ""Season of the Shooting Stars"" covers that team and that season in astounding depth.  If you can find a copy of it on VHS, the Leprechaun is on your side!)

Nevertheless, any Celtics fan should have a copy of this DVD set.  The actual game footage, which consitutes 5 of the 7 discs, makes it worth the price.  I've watched the 2 games from the 1984 Finals - possibly the best Finals in NBA history - several times and the energy of those games is gripping.  Seeing Kevin McHale clothesline Kurt Rambis in Game 4 to turn the series around, Larry Bird nailing clutch jumpers and foul shots, and then-captain Cedric Maxwell coming up big in the decisive 7th game, is reliving sports history at its best.

This DVD set preserves some if not all of the Celtics past and is worth owning because this is what true sports fans do: preserve the past, NOT live in it as some blatantly anti-Celtic reviewers here would like to think.  Remembering the past is so important for Celtics fans, or fans of any sports team with a long history of ups and downs, because it creates hope for the future.

Sure the Celtics have struggled since the end of Larry Legend's career, suffering from bad managment and lack of talent and unity, but they are rebuilding for a return to glory much like both their archrival Los Angeles Lakers and baseball equivalent New York Yankees did around the turn of the century.  Only time will tell if they fly or fall.

Meanwhile, this DVD serves as a reminder to all fans of what the Celtics have achieved in the past and keeps alive the memories, pride, and tradition of this unique sports franchise.",1140998400,,2442,4.712941176470588
2123223,5,B0002V7U28,"I recommend this dvd to those Celtics fans and basketball fans alike. You are going to see arguably the best team ever assembled play their greatest games. I am talking about the Bird Era of the eighties. This DVD takes you back to those years included in this DVD are actual games seven to be exact and it is pure gold.

Also included the history of the celticcs. I don't think anybody can find this rare footage anywhere else the quality is very good considering how old the games are these games happened 20-25 years ago.

I am a Boston Celtics fan and for the price that Amazon.com is charging is not too bad this is a collectors dream come true I happened to be a die hard Boston Celtics fan and this DVD is pure viewing pleasure.

This disc-set is a wonderful way to see more Lakers games, although a few games do not have the Lakers.  The Lakers always look fleet, sharp, and conditioned.  Next to the Celtics, they appear more so!  (If you use your slow mo, you can see that a couple 80's Celtic players have scars on their necks, from where they took the bolts out).  Celtics provide a wonderful contrast to the Lakers:  East vs. West, slow vs. fast, awkward vs. smooth, beer swilling Vinnies vs. good looking fans, don't ask vs. the Laker Girls.  If you want to see the Lakers at their best, and the Celtics near the top, there are some great games here!  I especially like the '84 series, when the Lakers' Twinkle Toes Jackson (white 6'3 off-guard from Niagara - master of the finger roll) took his finger roll attack right at the Celts!  He did a 180 roll on Bird, ""the tootsie roll"" on Parish, and ""rolling thunder"" on McHale!!  Then on a fast-break, he took off from the free-throw line for a finger roll!!!  (You may have seen the poster).  Awesome!!

Etc.  See if you agree -- The older the games, the better the network commentary:  The games from the 1970's have periods of silence (!); The 80's have matter-of-fact masters Musberger, Stockton, and Heinson (the best!)....  And by the nineties commentary was shrill non-stop yacking mixed with fault finding (Costas, Collins, Walton)....  Will we ever return to low-key *cool* commentary?  For me, the game is hype enough in itself!  We don't need shrill factoid geeks ranting non-stop!  Hasta I'm a Laker!",1112745600,2,1703,4.6632996632996635
2123226,5,B0002V7U28,"I was very impressed with this compliation of Celtics history.  I have been a fan since Bird's rookie year.  The best part is the complete classic game footage.  I can still hear the play by play voice of Dick Stockton calling those classic Celtic/Laker battles.  I have been looking for these games for years and now am glad I have them.  This is a must have for any basketball fan.  If you want to see real basketball, unlike todays players, watch this collection of Celtic great games.",1109462400,4,488,4.551724137931035
