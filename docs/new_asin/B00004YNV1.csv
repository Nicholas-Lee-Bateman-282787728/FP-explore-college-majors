I thought it would be a great gift for someone who is deaf and enjoys good comedy.  When it arrived, the actual product box did not mention CC so I played the DVD myself. . . no captions and it is in black and white (which was not a big deal).  Having no captions makes it unsuitable for my purpose.",1101168000,2,412,4.324675324675325
7927426,1,B00004YNV1,"You will enjoy the live skits as Red adlibs with his guests. Unfortunately, you better enjoy this on a small screen TV. The DVD is mastered from a second generation VHS tape recorded at EP speed. The faces are blurry and hard to see. It's bad quality DVD's like this that makes one worry about what DVD companies to  buy from.",994464000,6,326,4.344262295081967
