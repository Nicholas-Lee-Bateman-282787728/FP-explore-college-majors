8144143,1,B000I5XO82,LOL my brother ordered this under my account as a gag gift. I would never pay money for such trash,1414454400,,98,3.95
8144144,5,B000I5XO82,"Yeah I bought this looking for some inspiration to work out, and after watching the vid several times I did enjoy doing the exercise's on it, and it was inspiring.",1369526400,,163,4.466666666666667
8144145,1,B000I5XO82,"I bought this because I thought the naked men would be nice to look at while I worked out. So I guess they were ok to look at. But as far as the exercise content, the video is lacking terribly. Don't buy this if you actually want to work out! And if you are buying it for the nudity, then you are better off with porn.",1305072000,,318,3.8333333333333335
8144146,2,B000I5XO82,It is obvious that this was not meant to be a serious exercise video.  It looks like it was filmed in someone's garage.  The exercises are not very good and the models do not look like they are familiar or comfortable doing them.  Even as eye candy the models are questionable.  The concept if fun but the quality is poor.  The try to keep the models in a state of arousal for the viewer's enjoyment however only one of the two models is up to the task.,1294876800,,453,4.160919540229885
8144147,3,B000I5XO82,"The video was great, but the exercises are repeats. Both models do the same exercises as the first. Only two guys are shown naked throughout the video. Only one seems to get a good partial erection. There was several opportunities in the Behind the Scenes and Out Takes to show a guy with a full erection, but each time he covered himself and no effort was put forth to show it.

The videos were good entertaining and informative. One guy was much cuter than the other one. I feel insulted when they cut out the erection scenes so i would not recommend the video unless you have ot buy an exercise video anyway. It is good just don't look for anything special at all.",1215820800,3,667,4.379032258064516
8144148,4,B000I5XO82,"I was surprised how good this DVD was in terms of the genuine work out exercises.  The first guy to demonstrate is better looking in my opinion than the second guy, and it is a pity there vare only two guys in the DVD.
If you want to work out, as well as having fun in the nude with your partner, this is a very good DVD",1210550400,,320,3.7761194029850746
8144149,1,B000I5XO82,"Not that I expected a nude workout video to be a tool to get me ripped and muscular, but the exercises in this video, while self-rated as ""advanced"" are anything but.  If these are advanced exercises, the beginner version must be for people with zero muscle mass.  The voiceover is monotone, the models have zero personality or charisma.  And, the DVD comes with outtakes and behind the scenes that are just gratuitous.  The ""Penises on Parade"" segment was laughable and completely non-erotic.
I won't be wanked into another nude exercise DVD.",1199318400,7,543,4.934065934065934
8144150,5,B000I5XO82,"I have to admit, When I first bought this DVD, my intentions were to drool over the eye candy. But then I tried the workout.  Surprise Surprise, this actually works.  I needed to lose a few pound in my gut area and I swear to you, in two weeks, my abs went from jello to hard candy.  I never write reviews about my purchases, but I had to share this with the world.  Trust me, you won't regret purchasing this AMAZING DVD.  Good luck!",1160179200,26,434,4.119047619047619
