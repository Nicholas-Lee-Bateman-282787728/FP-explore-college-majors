8762209,5,B01G3JQQ8G,"Marc Minkowski conducts Les Musicians du Louvre in this January, 2015 performance at the Great Hall of the Salzburg Mozarteum Foundation during the Foundation's annual Mozart week.  The music is performed on period instruments and his a feeling of lightness and spontanaiety.  It is a joy to hear and see the period instruments, the enthusiasm of the conductor and performers, and the beauty of the Great Hall. Minkowski is a specialist in historical performance, and he has directed Salzburg's Mozart Week since 2013.

The Italian pianist Francesco Corti is the soloist in one of Mozart's best-known piano concertos, K. 488, in A major. Corti performs on a fortepiano owned by Mozart himself. The instrument has a soft, dry, detached sound different from that of the modern concert grand. It works beautifully in this performance with long runs in the opening movement, followed by Mozart's own cadenza, quiet reflectiveness in the adagio, and gaiety in the finale. There is a transparency to this reading that is difficult to achieve on modern instruments. This performance offers an outstanding way to hear a beloved Mozart piano concerto together with an excellent case for the value of period practice.

Thibault Noally, concertmaster of Les Musiciens du Louvre, joins the ensemble as the soloist in Mozart's violin concerto no. 5 in A major, K. 219.  Noally plays on a violin that Mozart himself had played, made by Pietro Antonio Della Costa. It is a pleasure to hear this rare instrument together with the performance by soloist and orchestra. Noally has a puckish demeanor and style which serves this music well. The performance includes a great deal of lyricism and fun in the outer movements and singing melancholy in the middle movement.  The finale of this work includes an unusual minor-key minuet as the middle section.

The DVD includes two bonus tracks.  The first consists of an expanded orchestra performing the finale of Schubert's ""Great"" C major symphony.  The reading is spirited and convincing. I would like to hear the recording of the entire Symphony rather than simply the finale.  (Minkowski has in fact recorded the complete Schubert symphonies.)  The second track consists of soloists Noally and Corti in a performance of the minuet from Mozart's sonata and violin in E minor, K. 304. This is a short movement of passion and depth.  Albert Einstein described the movement's middle-section trio as ""offering a brief glimpse of bliss.""

In sum, this thoroughly enjoyable DVD will appeal to lovers of Mozart and of historical performance practice and to both newcomers and those with a great prior love of music.  Sound and video quality are excellent.  The DVD is on Unitel Classics and distributed by Naxos.  Naxos kindly sent me a review copy.

Total Time: concertos -- 56 minutes; bonus tracks -- 16 minutes
