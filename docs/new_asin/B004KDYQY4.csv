4396540,4,B004KDYQY4,"Usually, when discussing Ayn Rand, I have seen two types of people:  those who love and those who hate her.  Often, those who are negative haven't actually read her works; their understanding is second-hand, predigested opinions of others.  Most of the time, criticism of her is personal (character assassination) and rarely are her actual ideas discussed.  This video is a quick way to get an introduction to the real Ayn Rand.

The DVD uses clips from the few existing video recordings and isn't structured by philosophical topics or ideas.  Therefore, don't expect this DVD to be comprehensive.

Hopefully, it will encourage those with pre-conceived, incorrect assumptions to further investigate the ideas of Ayn Rand.",1304553600,12,721,5.271929824561403
4396541,5,B004KDYQY4,"This was an all around good documentary.  It's basically autobiographical, as it was compiled from excerpts from interviews with Rand.  I've seen a lot of Rand's interviews on Youtube, and this documentary had pieces that I'd never heard before.

The people who made this movie worked with the Ayn Rand Archives and the Ayn Rand Institute.  Apparently some of the interviews within are ""never before seen/heard.""  Pretty neat.  I was fascinated and had some ""wow"" moments while watching.  Ayn Rand surely was a fascinating individual!

I should add that I watched this documentary with subtitles because sometimes it is hard to understand what's being said, whether it's because of Rand's accent or the music overpowering her voice (which happened once at the beginning).

4396542,5,B004KDYQY4,"Knowing a little about Ayn Rand,  'in her own words' is important.  When you experience someone first hand versus a biography, you really get a feel for the individual, undiluted by another's view points.  Her works are so amazing.  As you watch this DVD, you must then read ATLAS Shrugged, & see the movie.  Please keep in mind that it was written over 50 years ago. It's relevance to today's current politics is slightly 'scary'.  Her genius is evident.  What a gift she has left for us.  Atlas is the most important book I have read in my life, and I read it over 30 years ago.  Perhaps it will be yours as well.",1303603200,7,615,4.324561403508772
4396543,5,B004KDYQY4,"Ayn Rand's life story told, as the title suggests, in her own words. Here, many of Rand's interviews have been seamlessly pieced together to offer a detailed look at her life--where she came from, how she met her husband Frank O'Connor, the writing of her magnum opus Atlas Shrugged, etc. I highly recommend it to those who want to learn many details of this literary and philosophical genius' life.",1303603200,5,399,4.797101449275362
4396544,1,B004KDYQY4,"Not much about Rand's life to know really.  She was rich and thought that she was a genius.  She never developed past 13 and was probably a satanist.  And somehow, the religious right, and the fiscal conservatives come together to throw Jesus from the train in order to masticate Rand's magical journey through the wretched loathsomeness of wealthiness and atheism.  I'm sure there's a Southern Baptist preacher with all her books next to every version of the bible in their study and no clue to the massive hypocrisy of having two masters.  All in all, this was overrated.",1303430400,7,573,4.8061224489795915
4396545,5,B004KDYQY4,"This is an excellent audio-pictorial biography on the life, art and ideas of Ayn Rand.  Well produced, this is a visual photo album edited to a massive amount of rare interviews where Rand talks about her entire life, career and philosophy most of which I've never heard!  (There are also choice clips from Rand's Tom Snyder, Donahue and Mike Wallace appearances)  Oddly but appropriately enough, director/producer John Little has done a similar shorter project about Bruce Lee (as well as a series of excellent books).  I actually discovered Rand through years of studying Bruce Lee's fighting system and how it equally applied to all other disciplines, arts and concepts of living on earth (not the afterlife!).  Rand's basis for morality seems compatible with Lee's basic premises.  For instance. Rand's explanation of ""The virtue of selfishness"" is pretty much Lee's ""Express yourself honestly.""  Both stress rational, reasoned individual goal setting that must never infringe on another individual's rights.  Also Rand's idea that there is an objective morality based on reason and science fits nicely with Lee's statement (paraphrased) that there can never be different fighting styles and dogmas unless we acknowledge a sub or super species of man with additional limbs and physical/biological requirements.  They both equally expressed disdain for the mystical, Rand exorcised it from philosophy and Lee kicked it's ass out of martial arts!  This DVD provides a good foundation for Rand scholars and anyone interested in new ideas that break the mold of the dark, mystical past and present.",1302393600,24,1598,5.330677290836653
4396546,5,B004KDYQY4,"Wow! As a fan of both Ayn Rand and great documentaries I was keen to see In Her Own Words. I had heard a lot about the documentary coming out and with the Atlas Shrugged movie to be released in mid-April I was getting a little obsessed about seeing the doc before I saw the movie based on her novel. The great news is that I have seen the doc and I was not disappointed. What I saw in this comprehensive and fascinating piece was so powerful that I just had to watch it again and again. The directors have pulled out all of the stops to ensure that the viewer is guaranteed both pure enjoyment and stunning insight.

Without a doubt I can now say that I have gotten to know Ayn Rand in a way that I would never have thought possible. For all of her intellect, her philosophic passion and her fictional stories, to me it may be her own story, the true story of her life that is just as fascinating and amazing. Watching this documentary was as if I lived part of my life with Ayn Rand.

What Ayn Rand had to say back then, both from a philosophical and political perspective may be even truer now. Not only do I know so much more about Ayn Rand the person but even more importantly I am more committed than ever to her beliefs in individual rights, capitalism and minimum government.

An amazing woman. A compelling story. A superb documentary. Strongly suggest that you see the doc first if you are going to see Atlas Shrugged the movie.",1301270400,116,1437,4.275735294117647
4396547,5,B004KDYQY4,"I never knew much about Rand's personal life, or that there was so much footage of her. This film uses several filmed interviews she did at various points, and pulls together her whole life story and discussion of her philosophy, books, movies, etc. Really fascinating. I think the only voice you hear is Ayn Rand herself. Pretty much that's all anyway. You come away really understanding how she thought and why.",1299369600,41,413,4.830985915492958

4396572,5,B004KDYQY4,"I have seen some of these clips on YouTube but not all of them in one DVD. I still can't believe how accurate she was on what is happening now, and she said these things 40 years ago!",1417392000,,183,3.8421052631578947
4396573,5,B004KDYQY4,"Ayn Rand was ahead of her time, and she sure nailed our time.  I first read Atlas Shrugged back in the 1960's and loved it.  She is right on the mark.",1415404800,,150,3.806451612903226

4396577,2,B004KDYQY4,"Strange.....her voice and accent is so heavy you can barely understand her. In fact, it would be far better with sub titles. I was shocked to learn she is an Atheist. I own Atlas Shrugged 1 & 2, can't wait for the third one this fall. She certainly saw our future!
It's rather frightening, but oh so real and we're just about there now.",1407369600,,336,4.265625

4396589,2,B004KDYQY4,"Nice to hear and see Ayn interviews, but the film as such doesn't really have an arch to it.

4396590,1,B004KDYQY4,"She did her own narration on this documentary and with her accent it was extremely difficult to understand, I  was disappointed since I had read a few of her books and watched another documentary that was very well done.",1388966400,,220,4.641025641025641
4396591,5,B004KDYQY4,Listening and seeing Ms Rand discuss her philosophy and anwering Mike Wallace's questions was a sheer delight. Watching her large intelligent eyes light up when discussing ethical points made her books come alive. Highly recommended.,1388534400,,233,5.685714285714286

4396594,5,B004KDYQY4,I cant recommend this highly enough for Rand fans. It's well put together and very enjoyable. You should buy it.,1377129600,,112,4.65
4396595,4,B004KDYQY4,"You HAVE to be properly prepared for this in order to enjoy it.

You MUST keep in mind that you need to focus on Rand, and what she is saying (NOT the horrible production quality), or you might give up.

I enjoyed listening to Rand's own words rather than some liberal Rand hater OR some completely foolish kool-aid drinker from the Rand Institue.

In the unlikely event you don't already know, Rand is not the LEAST bit hesitant to tell you how brilliant she is. ""Humble"" is an adjective that would bounce off Rand and shatter into a million pieces. It is OBVIOUS that some ""critics"" are correct about her arrogance... and they focus on THAT rather than on the merits of her ideology, principles, and expression.

This is definitely worth a listen if you want to hear some insightful and profound commentary by the woman herself.

The production quality is HORRIBLE... be forwarned!",1372550400,,883,4.707792207792208
4396596,5,B004KDYQY4,I would say that this is more of a personal biography than an in depth view into her philosophy. That's really what I enjoyed. I rented this movie for that reason. She deserves so much more than an hour and a half biography. This woman was a revolutionary. A Thinker. And ultimately the ideal.,1369699200,,293,4.444444444444445
4396597,5,B004KDYQY4,"Good historical piece that puts Ayn's life experiences into perspective. The movie is a little dry on details of her philosophy,but is still a good film explaining how she came to her beliefs.",1369526400,,192,4.848484848484849
4396608,4,B004KDYQY4,"This was good.  Inever knew so much about Ayn Rand.  I thought this would be more on her politics and philosophy instead of her life.  It was slow, but interesting and it makes me want to read ""The Fountainhead"".  I only know of her because I bought the DVD ""Atlas Shrugged Part 1"".  I cannot wait until the conclusion and don't know whether to read the book or wait for Part III.  Her philosophy is inspring as I have gotten divorced and my exwife did not work and it showed me how the people in America who do not work and expect handouts are.  I want to enjoy the rewards I work for.  I give to charity, but that is my decision and I do not think the government should give to charities through taxes.  The government is a giant monster of a burocracy that is too big to hand and must be slayed.",1365897600,2,798,4.12987012987013

4396611,5,B004KDYQY4,This is one of the best if not the best presentation of Ayn Rand's life and philosophy.  And it's in her own words.  The video and images clearly present a seamless telling of Rand's biography followed by philosophy.  The only item I saw missing was Rand's study of philosophy at the University of Petrograd.,1356134400,,308,4.666666666666667
4396612,5,B004KDYQY4,Extremely interesting documentary about the legendary thinker's opinions and ideas over the last half-century. Her breadth of knowledge and love of the United States truly comes through. Her description of living in a dictatorship is chilling and a wake up call for all Americans. The Fountainhead is truly one of the great American novels. I highly recommend this film.,1355875200,,370,5.288135593220339
4396613,5,B004KDYQY4,"When I am feeling a little down I watch this.  It inspires, teaches and I always come away a little better than when I started.  Ayn Rand does that to me.",1355788800,2,154,3.935483870967742
4396614,5,B004KDYQY4,See my review of her other CD. She is not a Christian but I understand her not caring for people who are hippocrates. She is a deep thinker.,1352764800,,140,4.035714285714286
4396615,5,B004KDYQY4,"Ayn Rand is the bomb. I get the leftist take on her though. A coke headed speed freak that was endlessly self absorbed in thoughts of
everyone taking what was hers, extreme paranoia, very reminiscent
of ann coulter LOL LOL LOL. skinny wired selfish. Though in a perfect world her Libertarianism is the most effective form of government.
Why? because that which governs the least is best. period, I love my freedoms. So in a sense, Ayn was all about freedom to be an aho
bent on self interest.  And her idea that all ships rise in a rising sea is passe. we see now in modern america that most of us are being left behind in spite of socialism, in defiance of capitalism.",1352505600,,669,4.395161290322581
4396616,5,B004KDYQY4,"This video is a nicely put together compilation of Ayn Rand's television interviews (in black & White, before color TV).  I have seen various clips of Ayn Rand interviews on U-tube in the past, but this is much better than trying to hunt them down on the internet. It is quite revealing to see her going head to head with Mike Wallace and Phil Donahue.  My only complaint is the video is only 72 minutes long and I wish there were more.  It is not a History Channel type of in-depth expose, but it is still a revealing look into the mind of Ayn Rand. It was over much too soon.  It is a shame she is not around today to share her views.",1343692800,,636,4.104838709677419
4396617,4,B004KDYQY4,"The title says it all, Rand speaking about her life and works, albeit in not a very detailed manner and with some of the unpleasant episodes unmentioned, but a welcomed addition to her works. Several of her family photographs accompanied the narration.",1339200000,,252,5.023809523809524

4396639,5,B004KDYQY4,"Ayn Rand was born in 1905 Russia, prior to the start of WWI and the Russian Revolution - both of which she personally experienced. No new insights are presented, but hearing the life story of one of the world's most influential persons is enough by itself.

Citizens of Soviet Russia learned to live in a land with no rights; the underlying rationale of Communism, per Rand, is government-mandated altruism - doing things or acting in a manner that benefits others. Obviously this led to horrible results in Russia - eg. massive starvation, innumerable executions. )The Chinese people experienced the same outcomes, for the same reasons.) Unfortunately, Rand's observations of the outcome of government run amok while supposedly trying to help others led to her drawing conclusions based on those extreme behaviors being extrapolated to far, far less malevolent situations in America.

Regardless, she was an attractive young girl/woman, worked hard to better herself, came to America, and began work in Hollywood. Years of writing efforts, followed by inevitable rejection letters, were finally met by acceptance of her 'The Fountainhead' - she was paid $50,000 for the movie rights.

In 'The Fountainhead' (written after reading a Frank Lloyd Wright biography) she wanted to define (illustrate) what an ideal man would be like, and convince readers that reason, self-interest, and capitalism (without taxes or regulation) were ideal values. Rand did see some legitimate roles for government - maintaining law and order, defending against foreign attack, but did not explain how those services would be paid for.

Bottom-Line: 'Ayn Rand: In Her Own Words' was very useful in understanding her philosophy and where she drew those conclusions from.",1327536000,,1747,5.341818181818182
4396640,5,B004KDYQY4,"Almost as important as the meat of the information is the production style. Finally a documentary that travels chronologically along with one presenter. I cannot stand sound bite presentations where ten people talk about point one. Then the same ten people talk about point two.

The presentation is pieces of film and family photos. I lived in Los Angeles in the time of streetcars so it was really neat seeing them again. Much of the presentation has nothing to do with philosophy. However periodically philosophy raises its head. There are also clips of earlier reviews.

In the end you feel that Ayn is a real person (maybe a sort of snot) but not just an obscure or mysterious writer. And we get her insight as to what was presented before our own interpretation.

You might need to watch it again. At least take another look at her books.

4396641,5,B004KDYQY4,"Loved it! I would recommend this movie for anyone who wishes to understand what is and what has got our economy in such a mess; not to mention it is a great movie as well.

I have got to read the book now.",1326758400,,205,3.7674418604651163
4396642,5,B004KDYQY4,"This DVD was both interesting and inspirational.  It carefully details why Ayn Rand wrote what she did.  Individualism, self-motivation and striving for success in her characters reflects the struggle she had in her life to be completely free.  In her opposition to socialism and other forms of collectivism, she says that Russia tried to do this under the guise of Altruism.  She warns the United States could fall into the same trap.  Her message is that man must exist for its own sake, and not give his valuable talents to others under the guise of Altruism.  It is a trap to take away liberty and replace it with a dictatorial government.  Very excellent DVD.
Thanks to Amazon.com for their inventory of Ayn Rand materials.",1325808000,,728,4.82258064516129

4396644,5,B004KDYQY4,"I have just about every book and DVD regarding Ayn Rand and Objectivism. This video is unique in that her ideas are explained by her rather than by someone else second hand. When asked a question, Ayn had a unique ability to always hit the primary point right away, and with great clarity. That is why this DVD is a valuable addition. It is much drier than ""Ayn Rand: A Sense of Life"", which is an outstanding production, but this is uniquely clear as only she can be. Probably best suited for the die hard Objectivist. BTW: this video is marketed as 90 minutes, the video is actually only 72 minutes long plus a few bonus features, but worth the price - A must have for your philosophy collection!",1322611200,3,698,4.4186046511627906
4396645,3,B004KDYQY4,"The aplty titled ""Ayn Rand: In her Own Words"" lets Ayn Rand tell her own life's story and explain some of her ideas and how she wrote her novels. All of her narrative is taken from various TV interviews she gave during her life, incluing Mike Wallace and Phil Donahue. Besides Rand, there's no narrator here. The narration is accompanied by still photographs and film clips.

Rand fans won't find much new here, but may enjoy it anyway. For those unfamiliar with Rand, it might be a good introduction to learn who she was and what some of her ideas were.",1317254400,3,554,4.485148514851486
4396646,4,B004KDYQY4,"This video has info I hadn't seen in either of the two Ayn Rand biographies I've read. In many ways, it is more interesting than either book.

One of the highlights of the film is her recounting her first meeting with Louis B. Meyer. He didn't know her from Adam, though she had a letter of introduction from theater-owning relatives back in Russia. He  soon found himself giving her a lift.

Another highligh was her recounting her first big success. Finally she and Frank could order from the right side of the menu.

When she says she likes the phrase ""Thank God,"" because of what it means, a tribute to what is best and highest, you get an inkling of her real philosophy, one that is frequently misconstrued in the press.",1313539200,3,725,4.511450381679389

8432834,4,B004KDYQY4,"The movie is simply a collection of interviews she has made with television hosts such as Donahue and Mike Wallace, as well as still pictures from her early life, before she became a household name. Whatever you think of her or her philosophies, you at least hear her describe herself and how she adopted the attitudes she did.

And who was she? A girl born in Russia before the 1917 revolutions, how she felt as a child and how she got along-or didn't-with her various family members. She then talked about her education and university years, and why she wanted to come to the United States, and while there, how she supported herself and found a husband.

The movie does not cover the years after she found literary success with ""The Fountainhead"" or ""Atlas Shrugged"", but not every biopic has to be a Ken Burns mega production.",1490486400,,830,4.639455782312925

I was very involved in the Objectivist ""movement"" back in the early 60's and, with my then husband (now my ex), ran the Objectivist lectures in Los Angeles.  Having known Nathanial and Barbara Branden (not at all included in this video --- which is really wrong if one is to be truly objective) very well, I heard many stories about Ayn and Frank, and this video with all of its photos and more of a timeline of her life, was very interesting to me.  Someday, when all the foolishness of the 'break' between Ayn, Nathan and Barbara, has passed, perhaps a 'real' story can be told.

8432839,5,B004KDYQY4,"I found the time to watch this film of Ayn Rand at the weekend, and watched it again mid-week. It's a great film, and a great decision to let her tell her own story in her own words.

It's one of those creations I really like, in that the film doesn't seek to lecture or make a didactic point, but rather allows the viewer to hear from the author herself and absorb her perspectives, life story, and philosophy.

Rand herself in my view is a fascinating person, probably misunderstood by most who idolise or despise her, and she has had the courage in her life to actually think about it and to postulate ways of doing life differently. To do that risks criticism, abuse and ridicule.

We are all consciously or otherwise a product of our times, even if we strive not to be. Rand's views cannot be taken out of her early life experiences or the Russian Revolutions, what her family lost, and the personal struggles to make a living this forced on her. These aspects of her life were shown very clearly and powerfully in the film, in a concise non-ideological way.

Ultimately I think we now know so much more about the human mind, genetics, evolution and neuroscience than she had at her disposal, and we can see the actual workings of thoughts and emotions, cause and effect, and the complex interplay between the outer and inner worlds. I think great philosophers can still guide us in our thinking but for me at any rate it will be science, and not what we call reasoning (which neuroscience shows is rarely rational thinking at all), that propels philosophical and political direction in the 21st century. But that's a whole other story, and Rand, whether you like her or not, certainly made more of her life than most, and that may in the final analysis be the most important message she left us.",1443744000,,1801,4.549382716049383

From her family that sent her to the US, to the friends and family that put her up in New York, to the people who helped her get to California, and the people in California who helped her and even her brother in law who helped her get published at the company he worked for ,  and so on.  It all kind of goes against her whole concept of Objectivism , Rational Self Interest ,  and that people who take handouts are ""Moochers"" as Randites call them. Or as what Andy Rooney from 60 minutes so eloquently  said about Rand's concept ""  I've got mine, now pull up the rope ""  I found it very enlightening and exposing her for what she was..",1435363200,,727,4.084507042253521
