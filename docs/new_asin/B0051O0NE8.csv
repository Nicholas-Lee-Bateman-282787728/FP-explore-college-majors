4525467,5,B0051O0NE8,This series is full of human problems and needs.  It is set in the 2nd World War and very interesting.,1351900800,,102,4.1
4525468,3,B0051O0NE8,"We need SUBTITLES in this household!!  It has been a while since I watched the first series so it took a while for things to start making sense with regards to the cast.  There is too much ""canned crying"" from the baby! One scene requires crying to make a specific point, but why not have some pleasant ""baby talk"" when there is a need for baby noise. I look forward to 3, but disappointed that there are no ""extras"" or subtitles.",1337126400,,430,4.296296296296297
4525469,5,B0051O0NE8,This is a good series. If you like the thirties and forties. An interesting English series about women in England during world war two.,1332633600,,135,4.666666666666667
4525470,5,B0051O0NE8,"I love this series and only wish there were more episodes.  It has humor, romance, action, and history.  It shows many things that happened in England during the war to the everyday people who were doing their best to support the troops.  It portrays many of the hardships these people endured, especially the women who were left behind.  It grabbed my interest and held it for every episode.",1329004800,5,392,4.720588235294118
4525471,3,B0051O0NE8,"This might be a great series if you could understand what they're saying, since there's no closed captioning.  Series 1 was better than Series 2.  Very expensive for so few hours in the series.",1318118400,2,193,4.647058823529412
4525472,5,B0051O0NE8,"BBC honors farm service gals of WWII again, with more fictional drama, & winning awards. Remember, this is not documentary, and the same old ""wrong color"" uniforms that caused such a stir in Series 1 are used. But with nostalgic flair. Land gals sure can fill those bib overhauls. The aesthetic license taken to make this a beautiful scenic series within a war period adventure works well again. The writing is authentic enough to keep this war gals' story away from the column of `chick flic'. It's home front reality, scripted as fiction.

Awesome sets. The cast becomes characters you quickly believe in and consider family. Land girls Joyce's (Becci Gemmell) spouse is MIA, Bea (Jo Woodcock-`Dorian Gray') mom to a boy not her hubby's, are back. New LG Connie (Seline Hizli) sexy singing flirt, who taunts the pub pianist Henry (Liam Garrigan), also new, and also clergy. A great sub-plot.
Also returned from Series 1 is Esther (Susan Cookson), her son Martin (Mykola Allen), fat Finch (Mark Benton-`Murphy's Law' priest) as big as his illegal pig Chamberlin, Billy (Liam Boyle) son of Finch/spouse of Bea, Martin (Mykola Allen) son of Esther, and Tucker (Danny Webb) local accused of killing Lord Hoxley. All these appear in all 10 episodes from both series making this a familiar cast, a continued story from series one.

5 episodes all carryover and contain 5 main plots stretched through series two. Hoxley Hall now headed by Lady Hoxley (Sophie Ward) in all episodes yet provides war needs via Land Girls aid. An American, Gillespie (Clive Wood) spends all episodes seeking his grandson. Esther's desperate for money for her son's eye surgery. New Land Girl Connie flirts to the town's astonishment. A farm boy is called to war action. Then mixed among these major plots are ample small-plots that drive the suspense and fast pace of this Series 2.

SHAME on BBC. Again NO SUBTITLES, not even CC. Someone should inform the BBC that in America these are handicap standard, and needed even for accents. No bonus stuff; Wake up BBC, this is a 2011 release!

One reader objects to my routine episode synopsis. My pre-apologies, but for all those who like to know, here is limited activity for each of the 45 min episodes, plus they all carry the 5 main plots previously stated. No episode titles on DVD.
1 BACK TO THE LAND: Chamberlin is at risk. Lady Hoxley exasperates at her sister's return. Martin has an accident and finds an injured man in hiding.
2 DISPLACED LOYALTIES: Billy's called up while Italian POWs begin work at Hoxley causing a romantic stirring. MIA is a `widow' label assumption. A grandson is found and a death threat is given, but not to the baby.
3 FINAL RECKONING: Will a prize fight win $$ needed for surgery, and offer forgiveness to shunned Tucker? Joyce and Martin face deadly front-like action.
4 FIGHT THE GOOD FIGHT: There's small difference between killer heroism and shooter anguish for Joyce. Locally housed child evacuees are mistreated. ""Bubbles"" Connie to the rescue! Surgery funds found--belatedly for some concerned.
5 DARKEST HOURS: Kidnap, murder, and romance are linked to Land Girls in this climactic series-ending episode that's often emotional, sometimes funny, hectic, and fast-paced. Most issues are solved satisfactorily: ""All tickety-boo."" Some bare war scars.

Not documentary. Not a history book. It's highly entertaining romantic period drama with wartime suspense, action on the home front, and beautiful rural filming. My wife and I will watch it again, & soon.",1318118400,15,3519,4.9880749574105625

What both women and men did to survie and for their country.",1316476800,2,140,4.384615384615385
4525474,4,B0051O0NE8,"Like others who have watched this series, I was dissapointed that it was written more like an American soap opera than a drama with side stories.
WW11 in England must have been absolutly frightening, bombs dropping, children taken to the county to live as evacuees for safety. Even if this series takes place in the country, technically away from the war, I think it could have connected better with the main event.",1315180800,2,415,4.777777777777778

4525502,5,B0051O0NE8,"Any Anglophile will love this series.  It takes place during WW II, focusing on women who joined Great Britain's national service to work on farms to produce food for the war effort.  The characters are wonderful, as is the story line.  It is a very well done series.  I love history, especially that time period. The attention to detail is just great.",1389571200,,352,4.629032258064516
4525503,5,B0051O0NE8,"This is a super series, whether for the simple enjoyment factor or for history buffs interested in learning different aspect to WWII.  Land girls replaced men that had been called to war in England during WWII.  As the title suggest, they literally worked the land, replaced farm hands, factory workers etc.  Interesting, good stories, with many humorous events.",1388966400,,362,5.206896551724138

4525505,3,B0051O0NE8,"While I was happy to view this and would view it again, I thought the story line faltered from series 1.
Felt like a speed bump.

Lady Hoxley's sister and the American businessman were such exaggerated characters, I almost felt it was a Hollywood series instead of British.

None-the-less I enjoyed the story and production and happily move on to series 3.",1379721600,,356,4.725806451612903

4525509,3,B0051O0NE8,Seems kind of low budget and the writing or acting could be better.  What is with only 5 episodes per season?  This has the potentional to be very good but they don't want to spend the money on it or something...,1367366400,,212,4.146341463414634

8452965,3,B0051O0NE8,Corny British soap. 1st season was ok but as the series went on story line became too dramatic and desperate. Actors change and many cliff endings. Characters disappear without good explanation and unbelievable Far fetch story lines. Not accurate on history and WWII details. Pass on this series.,1508284800,,296,5.1875
