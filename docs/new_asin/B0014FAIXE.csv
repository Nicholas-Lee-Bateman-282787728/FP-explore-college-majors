3131406,5,B0014FAIXE,Very impressed with the quality. The episodes look as though they were just shot yeasterday when it comes to sound and clarity.  Hopefully all 12 seasons will be put out.  If you are a Hawaii 5O fan you won't be disappointed!,1215388800,4,225,4.463414634146342
3131407,5,B0014FAIXE,"Love the scenery of Hawaii - Jack Lord was great - all good looks and very professional and those great famous words - ""Book him Danno - Murder 1""  Also, the theme music is terrific - these shows were like a mini-trip to Hawaii - I watch them over and over and never tire of them - the slang, and dress is so typical of late 60's early 70's it is like a great trip down memory lane.  It is a terrific encapsulated review of life at that time!

3131408,5,B0014FAIXE,"I loved this show from the beginning. It was filmed in Hawaii which brought many tourists here - and Jack Lord was perfect for the part of Steve McGarrett. I don't know how many seasons it ran, but I hope to own all of them.",1214697600,3,224,4.0
3131409,5,B0014FAIXE,"McGarret and his crew are back and the bad guys in the Aloha State had better beware!
Season 4 roars right back with more great crime drama in the tropical paradise of Hawaii.
All the original cast is still here (Kono would leave after this season) and the stories are all great action-packed adventures.
Fans of Five-O won't be disappointed!
And yes, McGarret's arch-nemesis Wo Fat makes an appearance is an exciting two part episode.
There are some continuity flubs with McGarret's big Mercury - he's seen driving off in a 2 door hardtop and arriving on the scene in a 4 door hardtop! Ditto for the ambulance used in several episodes - it magically transforms from a Cadillac into a Pontiac!
Overall, this a well made set with terrific video/audio quality.
Book 'em, Danno!",1214524800,17,775,4.7481481481481485
3131410,5,B0014FAIXE,"Hawaii Five-O The Fourth Season rides the same wave of excellence that carried the series through seasons one, two and three. Season three in particular marked the onset of the show's glory years, and this season picks up where the last one left off. I admit, I might be a bit prejudiced when I say that the fourth season is probably my favorite, since it does feature my all-time favorite episode, Cloth of Gold, in which a group of wealthy and decadent real estate scammers are knocked off one by one via one of the most unusual murder weapons in television history, but, really, there are plenty of reasons to love and recommend this set. For one thing, it is more consistent than past seasons, with only one truly lame episode, Two Doves and Mr. Heron... even that provides the joy of watching John Ritter play a poetry-spouting vagrant-slash-hippie whose high-sounding morality suddenly disappears once he has a chance to abscond with fifty-thousand dollars. Five-O seems to have gotten a little edgier in season four, most notably in the increased level of violence. I don't know if it was just a matter of network standards relaxing, or the exposure to the Vietnam War on the news every night, but the violence in these episodes is generally more hard-hitting and disturbing, particularly in the classic episode ...And I Want Some Candy and a Gun That Shoots, which features a crazed Vietnam veteran who holes up in a roadside bunker with a rifle and takes pot shots at police officers. In fact, several of the culprits in these episodes are troubled vets just back from their tours of duty, which puts Five-O clearly ahead of its time in dealing with issues such as post-traumatic stress disorder. In addition to being more violent, the episodes are also more lurid. Which is fine, I always enjoyed a little bit of sleaze with my Five-O. Wednesday Ladies Free and the previously mentioned Cloth of Gold are classic episodes that imbue their nightmarish murder stories with elements of kink and sensationalism. But Skinhead ups the ante even further, brutally, and rather bluntly, dealing with the issues of racism and rape in a way that must have been pretty daring for its time. For example, an Asian woman assaulted by a white soldier is questioned on the witness stand about the irrelevant details of her sexual history, and is made to look like an instigator rather than a victim by the defendant's unctuous attorney. I wonder if any TV show prior to this dealt with as many peripheral issues involved in the difficult matter of rape as this episode does. It's a powerful show, and one of the season's best. So is Nine Ten, You're Dead, which uses one of Five-O's patented mainland syndicate storylines to comment on the damaging side effects of boxing.

But Five-O is just as notable for the fun and ingenious schemes it depicts as it is for its fearlessness in dealing with contemporary issues, and season four is no exception. 3.000 Crooked Miles to Honolulu, Didn't We Meet at a Murder, Odd Man In, Bait Once Bait Twice, While You're At It Bring In the Moon, Good Night Baby Time to Die, Rest in Peace Somebody and For a Million Why Not all have well-plotted stories that keep the viewer guessing, and completely enthralled. Wo Fat makes a welcome appearance. In one especially haunting episode, the usually staunch McGarrett falls in love with a painting. In addition, the camerawork is as gritty, the music as flashy, the perps as ruthless and clever(just not as clever as McGarrett), the scenery as lush, and McGarrett as hard-boiled and unflinching as ever.

Thanks to CBS, the early '70's live again, in all their gritty and entertaining glory, and with hardly any signs of rust. Be there. Aloha.",1214265600,9,3717,4.788161993769471
3131411,5,B0014FAIXE,"Five-O started before I was born and ended before I really watched much TV.  So I was relegated to watching the reruns with my grandfather and my dad.  Well, now that the DVDs are out, I can't get enough of this show.  It's amazing how good it is still today.  Sure some of the dialog is now dated and the stories are very straight forward but that's what is so good about Hawaii Five-O.  That and the fact that Steve McGarrett is the coolest cop IN THE WORLD.  This season, we start to see some repeating themes from the first 3 seasons and it give the show some continuity and character development.  Can't wait for 5 - 12 to be released!",1213920000,17,640,4.239669421487603
3131412,5,B0014FAIXE,"Hawaii Five-0: The Fourth Season delivers more of what we love most about the show in 24 exciting remastered episodes.
All of the episodes are once again digitally remastered, looking very pristine for shows from 1971 that are 37 years old. The only hint of grain is in the occasional piece of stock footage that appears in the episodes.
Despite the now ubiquitous disclaimer on the box, none of the episodes appear to have been cut based on run times and my extensive memory of the shows from VHS tapings.

There is one small change from previous seasons:  the discs themselves no longer feature artwork this time around, probably to save on costs.  Instead, they are the standard CBS DVD silver with the show logo.

As before, episode promos are included for some of the shows, although fewer than in previous seasons.

This season is one of the very best, with a number of excellent episodes and very few stinkers, if any, in the bunch.  In fact, a few of the episodes are downright edgier in terms of content than previous seasons, including one which features several ethnic slurs from a thug that Paramount's editing department left intact.
The best episode in my opinion is the season opener, ""Highest Castle, Deepest Grave"", in which a millionaire (Herbert Lom from the ""Pink Panther"" movies) is implicated in the 10-year-old murder of his wife.  Watching a great theatrical actor of Lom's stature clash with Jack Lord makes their many scenes together sizzle with dramatic tension.

Other stories from this season include a plot to kill the Governor, a traveler's check scam masterminded by a college professor, a serial killer who dresses up his victims, a soldier accused of rape, a man who is murdered at his own birthday party, an embezzler who gets rolled by hippies, a psychotic sniper, a great caper episode about a carefully-plotted armored car heist, and another two-parter featuring everyone's favorite Five-0 villain Wo Fat.

The season features loads of other great guest stars including John Ritter, Annette O' Toole, Buddy Ebsen, Vic Morrow, Marion Ross, Jackie Cooper, Loretta Swit, Tim O' Connor and Hume Cronyn returning as Lewis Avery Filer, the criminal mastermind he played in Season 3.

All in all, another outstanding effort on the part of CBS DVD and Paramount.  Now we get to wait for the much-anticipated Season Five, which features arguably the best storyline ever from the series.",1213660800,39,2415,4.938271604938271

3131414,5,B0014FAIXE,"Nothing lasts 12 years without having something going for it. In the case of Hawaii Five-O, it easy to dismiss it as a typically television crime drama that got lucky by finding its audience and keeping it. The same could be said for Law and Order. Except, in television years, luck usually runs out after two or three years. Gimmicks get old, the formula is figured out, and sharks are jumped so often they don't even complain.

But shows that last five years, much less 12, have to have something besides luck, gimmicks, and great scheduling. Hawaii Five-O had a number of things going for it. First of all, let's be honest. The setting was, and still is so lush and exotic that it is easily intoxicating. Hawaii is beautiful, and most people either live there or want to live there. Filming on location has always been a blessing when it's been done, and probably no more so than on this series.

Next, Jack Lord, playing Five-O chief Steve McGarrett, was one of a long line of no-nonsense law enforcement figures. The strength, integrity, and dedication of these kinds of characters cannot be overstated, and these characters will always have lots of fans rooting them on, not unlike Law and Order's Jack McCoy.

Finally, watching shows like this is always a treat because you see so many stars that were either big stars enjoying a working Hawaiian vacation, or lots of up and coming stars before they got their big break. Hawaii Five-O was a natural draw for both categories, and it's fun to watch them and remember when.

It's also fun to remember when you could look forward to hearing one of the best and most recognizable theme songs in television history. Not a small thing when you add it with the other factors. Hawaii Five-O had a lot going for it then, and it has a lot going for it now.",1204156800,36,1802,4.569659442724459

3131423,5,B0014FAIXE,"""Hawaii Five-O"" is one of the most entertaining and iconic detective shows in the history of television. Its fourth season continues to follow the exploits of Detective Captain Steve McGarrett, who serves as the head of the Hawaiian State Police Special Task Force known as Hawaii Five-O. Jack Lord delivers a perennially outstanding performance portraying the unflappable and intrepid Captain Steve McGarrett, in his mission to vanquish the criminal element in Hawaii. Although ""Hawaii Five-O"" now comes across as being somewhat comical, because its initial episodes are almost fifty-years-old, most viewers still find it to be enjoyable, especially because of the spectacular Hawaiian scenery. Therefore, I give ""Hawaii Five-O"" a five-star rating, along with my highest recommendation.",1485561600,,787,5.735042735042735

Jack Lord's Steven McGarrett was the heart and soul of the series. His character and the actor respected Hawaii as well. Upon his death and his widow's death in real life, Lord left an estate of forty million dollars to Hawaii.

After only seeing the first season on DVD, I was lucky to see the fourth season. I was disappointed that there are no extras like a documentary, extra footage, old interviews, etc. They do show episode promos which are like television trailers for the upcoming episode.

Every episode is unique, written and acted well. The show's creator and executive producer, Leonard Freeman, was still in charge of production He died in the fifth season but Hawaii Five-O was his baby too.

3131550,5,B0014FAIXE,"The original Hawaii Five O was one of the really great television shows.  It was beautifully produced and, for the most part, well acted.  The characters were realistic and believable, although some actresses overdid their histrionics and women were frequently portrayed as being dingy.

One of the great features of this series is the emphasis on the growing change in culture of the time; establishment vs. anti-establishment.  An example is clothing.  Five 0 personnel,  the Governor, and even a lot of the bad guys wear suits and ties, while the ""hip"" people wear sport jackets and Hawaiian shirts.  That's not campy, folks, that's the way it was in the late '60's and early '70's.

Many episodes presented a mystery to the viewers, and we tried to figure out what was going on before McGarrett did.  That added to the fun of watching the shows.  It was the quality of the production, acting, and visuals that made Hawaii Five 0 last for twelve seasons, and run in syndication to this day.  The Leonard Freeman/Jack Lord version is rightly called a classic, something by which similar productions are judged.

There are some really great moments here, especially in the first episode, which has Chief Inspector Dreyfus as a suspect in a ten year-old murder investigation. I half-expected Inspector Clouseau to come bursting into the ""Rheum"" and bungle everything that McGarrett was doing. Okay...wrong movie. The music during this episode is a welcome change from the same themes always used before, and it keeps on going that way throughout the rest of the season.

Minor note: there's a continuity error in the episode ""Bait Once, Bait Twice."" There's a shot of the woman's feet, and they're naked. But in the next shot of her feet, they're clothed. I'm just pointing that out.

And the fourth season of Hawaii Five-O is a treat. Includes an episode that deals with racism/rape, two issues which were just unleashing their heads in the '70's. And once again, another unconventional episode ala Season 3's ""Over 50, Steal."" And of course, another exciting episode with Wo Fat (this one a terrific two-parter).

3131626,5,B0014FAIXE,"The fourth season of Hawaii Five-0 marks the beginning of the era where Jack Lord looks very different than he did in the first three seasons.

There is much debate about this among Five-0 ""junkies"", of which I am one.  Most people I've talked to really don't seem to notice it.  But being naturally picky, and having worked in television myself and having married a man who worked in television for 34 years, I tend to notice things that others don't.

But whether anyone has a background in television or not, all one needs to do is place a closeup of Jack Lord in either Seasons One, Two, or Three next to a closeup of Jack Lord in Season Four.

There's been some changes made.

Personally, my belief is that he had cosmetic surgery at the end of Season Three.  I don't see that there's any problem with that, but lots of fans get angry when this idea is voiced.  But women do it all the time, and actors who star in a long-running series and are bandied about as some sort of sex symbol have pressures put on them [and put pressures on themselves] to maintain an image that the star is younger than their chronological age indicates.  And this certainly had to be the case with Jack; the series was so popular when it went into its 4th season -- and Jack by then was over 50 -- there had to be pressure to maintain his looks, and that only could be done cosmetically.

My response to all that is:  So what?

Female stars have been doing it for decades, and often when the choice was to have cosmetic surgery, shift to playing characters who were older women, or stop appearing in movies altogether.  And in many cases women DID stop acting.  Few female actresses permitted themselves to age on camera and do it gracefully -- Bette Davis and Joan Crawford come to mind.  Others, like Greta Garbo,simply vanished from public view for the rest of their lives.

The same decisions face male actors, and it seems naive for people to refuse to consider that it could be otherwise.

All that said -- Season Four contains many of my favorite Five-0 episodes.  ""Highest Castle, Deepest Grave"" is one of them, and for years I've been trying to find out who wrote the piece of music Mr. Mondrego was playing on the piano when McGarrett shows up early in the show.  It's definitely a classical piece, but not a piece with which I'm familiar.  It could be Liszt or Rachmaninoff, for example.  It's NOT Chopin, Beethoven, or Mendelssohn.  And it's certainly not Bach, who always uses a light touch.

If anyone knows the answer, please tell me!

Season Four was really a great year for Five-0.  There are no bad shows, period.  [To me, bad shows are those in which we barely see McGarrett.  I'm not a Danno fan, and all the Five-0 ""junkies"" out there who know me know I've never been a fan of James MacArthur -- and it's too bad; I keep looking for a show where he looses his persistently wooden manner, but it happens only rarely -- ""Beautiful Screamer"" is probably the only show where he delivers a really good performance [and lots of people disagree with me here].

But to me, a show without McGarrett, or with very little McGarrett, 9 times out of 10 will be a show I rarely watch.

But Season Four doesn't fall into this category -- it's Season Six when we begin the period, mercifully short, when there were too many shows with too little McGarrett.  It's perfectly understandable at the time -- Jack was tired, and Five-0 was an extremely physically demanding show -- and prior to that time he appeared in virtually EVERY scene within a single show.  Although Jack kept in very good physical shape, he was discovering that his body wouldn't take the pounding energy that the show had always demanded.  And the ""joys"" of growing older are NOT fun; our bodies simply will not do what they used to do with practically no effort.

Fortunately for fans, it was a temporary move because McGarrett fans objected wildly, and the show soon returned to lots and lots of McGarrett in almost every show.  I'm not sure how fortunate that was for Jack.

It is important to remember, too, that during the mid-1970s through the time the show ended in 1980, there was very powerful pressure on all TV series to cut down, or preferably cut out, violence.

One has to remember what it was like to live during those years.  Television was receiving LOTS of overwhelming congressional pressure -- and pressure from viewers who found themselves with young children -- to cut out violence.  In a crime series, this is a directive that is very hard to do.

But these are subjects for reviews of the pertinent seasons; I just want to comment here that the middle and later years of Five-0 were written with very powerful, very vocal pressure to curb TV violence. If one is not familiar with the culture of the 1970s, one cannot possibly understand the way Five-0, and many other shows, went through such a dramatic sea change during this period.

That pressure had yet to hit TV series shows.  And for me, when it comes to Season Four, my recommendation is:  If you're a fan of the show, GRAB SEASON FOUR QUICKLY!  It's a season full of real winners!",1247961600,,5122,4.515743756786102
3131627,5,B0014FAIXE,"While other seasons, preceding and subsequent, had standout episodes, season four, as a whole, was a standout, featuring outstanding performances from guest stars, well-written and executed scripts, and the last hurrah for the original foursome (Jack Lord, James MacArthur, Kam Fong, and Zulu who would depart at the end of this season).

The show really got into its groove in a grand way with the first installment, ""Highest Castle, Deepest Grave,"" reminiscent of the classic movie ""Laura"" with rare guest appearances from France Nuyen, movie veteran Herbert Lom, and respected acting coach Jeff Corey. Not only do they excel in their portrayals, star Jack Lord does well as he becomes enamored by the painting that hides a dark mystery.

Besides that particular episode, other noteworthy ones were:

""No Bottles, No Cans, No People"" - Henry Darrow (""The High Chaparral"") is featured as an unscrupulous crime boss intent on proving to other ""hoods"" on the mainland that he is a force to be reckoned with.

""3,000 Crooked Miles to Honolulu"" - Buddy Ebsen, late of ""The Beverly Hillbillies"" and before ""Barnaby Jones,"" guests as a criminal genius who thinks he has a flawless plan to make a fortune off of stolen travelers checks.

""Two Doves and Mr. Heron"" - noteworthy solely for the appearance of a young John Ritter and the late Vic Morrow in a part that is rather provocative for the era

""And I Want Some Candy, and a Gun That Shoots"" - featuring Jeanne Cooper before she became ""Mrs. Chancellor"" on ""The Young and the Restless"" and a young Annette O'Toole. The episode also allows Lord a chance to give commentary about the state of mental hospitals ""revolving door"" policies.

""The Burning Ice"" - Former child star Jackie Cooper gives a rare performance as a doctor whose wife is apparently randomly murdered for her jewels but things, as always, are not all as they appear to be. Lou Antonio is quite good as the sympathetic suspect.

Guest Norman Alden is mostly heard and not seen in ""Rest in Peace, Somebody,"" a taunt episode about a possible assassination plot on an unnamed victim.

""A Matter of Mutual Concern"" proves there is no honor among thieves.

""Nine, Ten, You're Dead"" showcases character actor Moses Gunn as a washed-up boxer who runs afoul of a shady promoter (Albert Paulsen). Guest Frank Webb, who would die tragically three years later, plays an unlikely hit man.

""Odd Man In"" - Hume Cronyn comes back one more time as wily con man Lewis Filer.

""Bait Once, Bait Twice"" features a pre-""M.A.S.H."" Loretta Swit (her third appearance as guest on the show)

""Skinhead"" - commentary on racism and also quite frank in its sexuality

""While you're at It, Bring Me the Moon"" - Barry Sullivan guests as an eccentric millionaire, a la Howard Hughes. Other guests include ""repeat performers"" Milton Seltzer and Ed Flanders.

""Good Night Baby, Time to Die"" - Beth Brickell and William Watson are antagonists in this well-crafted tale.

""Cloth of Gold"" - Ray Danton, Jason Evers, and Jay Robinson guest as the unlikely targets of an mystery murderer, using a most ingenious modus operandi.

""Didn't We Meet at a Murder"" offers three hit ""men,"" all unlikely candidates for the job.

The final episode, ""R & R & R"" delivers a frightening guest turn from Alan Vint and also comments on the tragedy of war.

Surprisingly, one of the weakest episodes in the whole compilation is the two-parter ""The 90-Second War"" with the return of McGarrett's main nemesis Wo Fat (Khigh Dhiegh). Though it also stars movie veterans Donald Pleasance and Dana Wynter, along with returning Roger C. Carmel as Col. Mischa Toptegan, the installment seems rather bloated and slightly confusing, devoid of the usual good storytelling involving Wo Fat.

But that one, along with a couple of other ""clunkers"" doesn't lessen what is arguably one of the best in the show's twelve-year run.

The re-mastered set has good sound, outstanding clarity of picture and color.

Great music scores, a staple of the series, are supplied by Morton Stevens and Don B. Ray, among others.",1245196800,6,4059,4.912152269399707

Every other show played correctly. Besides that problem the story lines in season 4 some were okay some were just boring to watch. But still the music and sound effects and Jack Lord made up for those. I'll always enjoy watching Hawaii Five-O and will continue to get the rest of the seasons as soon as they're available.

Season 4 one of the staff won't be in Season 5 I'll just mention that here but won't give out names not to give the story away. Seasons 1, 2, and 3 were great to watch!

I watch this with my little brothers all the time, Five-O is responsible for my 7 year old brother going around saying things like ""groovy"", ""dig"", and ""chickie baby.""  Oh well.  He missed out on the 70's, I guess one little part of it in his vocabulary isn't going to hurt anything.

3131635,1,B0014FAIXE,"This is not a review of the series, which in my opinion is the greatest Crime Drama ever made.  As for the VERY long-awaited DVD release, I've been Very disappointed.  Stated in the fine print on the boxes, unfortunately Paramount/CBS decided to offer us an INCOMPLETE (missing episode(s)) and EDITED collection.  In addition, it's NOT-SO-SHARPLY ""remastered"".  Compared to broadcast recordings, it doesn't appear to be remastered at all to me.  I'm sure that Jack Lord, being the perfectionist he was about this show, would NOT approve.

If I like a show enough to want to collect it and to pay hundreds of $$$ for it, I expect a few minimum basic qualities.  Those are:  EVERY EPISODE, UNEDITED, and digitally remastered at least to the resolution at which it is noticeably clearer than my own recordings.  This collection is missing all of those essential qualities.  So it seems VERY expensive to shell-out ($36 x 12 Seasons == $432) for it when I can record the same thing free.  It's kind-of insulting for Paramount to offer an INCOMPLETE collection at that price.

Unless you don't get re-runs (you'd have to live in Mongolia) and you just can't wait to see the edited episodes they chose to include, it may be well worth just waiting another 2 years or so for the inevitable boxed set.  Of course, a series this popular, will be offered in a boxed set (and for Half that price) after they've exhausted all the individual season sales, as we've seen every Christmas with even less popular series.  Those always include ""Previously Unreleased Episodes"", ""(Complete) Director's Cuts"", and ""High Resolution Digital Remastering"", etc. to compel even those who paid $432 for these first cuts, to buy it too - Exactly what they're withholding from this collection.  And they always come packaged in some collectible tin or box.  Maybe a die-cast Mercury in this case.

Paramount has told us they've further edited these.  So it hasn't been a surprise that I've noticed quite a bit throughout.  Just for examples I'll point out a few I noticed recently while watching 6 sequential episodes.  This is not intended to be a complete list or recount of details.

1) Ep: ""Forty Feet High and it Kills!"" Scene: A humorous back & forth between Wo Fat and the Quirky Professor in which Wo Fat confronts the professor regarding his deliberate attempts to foil ""Mr. Fat's"" machination in the on-going game of mental chess between the two.

2) Ep: ""A Bullet for McGarrett"" Scene: A police psychiatrist goes into further detail/demonstration in order to convince McGarrett that hypnosis certainly could be the weapon he faces.

3) Ep: ""The Singapore File"" Scene: McGarrett outruns Victor in a car chase, then tensely negotiates, without his ID/papers, for passage on a ship from Singapore.",1221177600,7,2951,5.11482254697286

The plots and execution of most of the episodes in the set compare favorably with the best of contemporary police dramas and the characters interact with ease and familiarity. The only caveat I would offer is a technical one: The fourth episode on disk five seems to have been mastered incorrectly. When I began playing it, I noticed interlacing artifacts whenever there was movement within a frame. I thought it might have been a problem with my equipment, but the other episodes played fine. The nearest I can tell is that the episode was encoded with reversed field dominance that could be corrected by ripping the episode and re-encoding it with an application like Apple's Final Cut.",1218067200,,864,4.9655172413793105

-It's the best looking picture quality yet for this series on DVD
-The actors are incredibly set in their roles and it perfectly gells in season 4
-The return of McGarrett's comic, man-of-a-thousand-faces foil, Louis Avery Filer! It's always a treat to see an episode featuring him.

3131653,5,B0014FAIXE,"The show just keeps getting better and better. The video and sound quality is excellent.  The discs do not feature images of the Five-0 boys as they did for Seasons 1-3, and I hope they put them back on for the remaining seasons. The more I see this show the more I respect Leonard Freeman and all of the incredible talents he brought together to make this series, - the time was right, the people were right, Hawaii and travel was still exotic and glamorous.  And yet the themes in the episodes resonate today.  Buy it, be there, Aloha!
The stories are getting very gritty and edgy - more of the seamy underbelly of paradise. My favorite is Skinhead, featuring an extremely creepy and frightening monster; the way the boys handle learning a certain secret shows them as very professional. The cross-exam of the rape victim makes abundantly clear how far women have come in certain respects, something often taken for granted these days. Also love Cloth of Gold, with a profoundly moving sad twist and a streak of kinky sleaze. There's a wonderful caper story in For a Million-Why Not? Both of these are terrific Danny episodes. Another great caper in 3000 Crooked Miles to Honolulu, which also shows how the death of an innocent young woman affects those close to her and the Five-0 boys. Some grisly moments in A Matter of Mutual Concern and No Bottles etc, more kink in 2Doves & Mr Heron and I Want a Gun...

3365907,5,B0014FAIXE,"Hawaii Five-O The Fourth Season rides the same wave of excellence that carried the series through seasons one, two and three. Season three in particular marked the onset of the show's glory years, and this season picks up where the last one left off. I admit, I might be a bit prejudiced when I say that the fourth season is probably my favorite, since it does feature my all-time favorite episode, Cloth of Gold, in which a group of wealthy and decadent real estate scammers are knocked off one by one via one of the most unusual murder weapons in television history, but, really, there are plenty of reasons to love and recommend this set. For one thing, it is more consistent than past seasons, with only one truly lame episode, Two Doves and Mr. Heron... even that provides the joy of watching John Ritter play a poetry-spouting vagrant-slash-hippie whose high-sounding morality suddenly disappears once he has a chance to abscond with fifty-thousand dollars. Five-O seems to have gotten a little edgier in season four, most notably in the increased level of violence. I don't know if it was just a matter of network standards relaxing, or the exposure to the Vietnam War on the news every night, but the violence in these episodes is generally more hard-hitting and disturbing, particularly in the classic episode ...And I Want Some Candy and a Gun That Shoots, which features a crazed Vietnam veteran who holes up in a roadside bunker with a rifle and takes pot shots at police officers. In fact, several of the culprits in these episodes are troubled vets just back from their tours of duty, which puts Five-O clearly ahead of its time in dealing with issues such as post-traumatic stress disorder. In addition to being more violent, the episodes are also more lurid. Which is fine, I always enjoyed a little bit of sleaze with my Five-O. Wednesday Ladies Free and the previously mentioned Cloth of Gold are classic episodes that imbue their nightmarish murder stories with elements of kink and sensationalism. But Skinhead ups the ante even further, brutally, and rather bluntly, dealing with the issues of racism and rape in a way that must have been pretty daring for its time. For example, an Asian woman assaulted by a white soldier is questioned on the witness stand about the irrelevant details of her sexual history, and is made to look like an instigator rather than a victim by the defendant's unctuous attorney. I wonder if any TV show prior to this dealt with as many peripheral issues involved in the difficult matter of rape as this episode does. It's a powerful show, and one of the season's best. So is Nine Ten, You're Dead, which uses one of Five-O's patented mainland syndicate storylines to comment on the damaging side effects of boxing.

But Five-O is just as notable for the fun and ingenious schemes it depicts as it is for its fearlessness in dealing with contemporary issues, and season four is no exception. 3.000 Crooked Miles to Honolulu, Didn't We Meet at a Murder, Odd Man In, Bait Once Bait Twice, While You're At It Bring In the Moon, Good Night Baby Time to Die, Rest in Peace Somebody and For a Million Why Not all have well-plotted stories that keep the viewer guessing, and completely enthralled. Wo Fat makes a welcome appearance. In one especially haunting episode, the usually staunch McGarrett falls in love with a painting. In addition, the camerawork is as gritty, the music as flashy, the perps as ruthless and clever(just not as clever as McGarrett), the scenery as lush, and McGarrett as hard-boiled and unflinching as ever.

Thanks to CBS, the early '70's live again, in all their gritty and entertaining glory, and with hardly any signs of rust. Be there. Aloha.",1214265600,9,3717,4.788161993769471

Well, now that the DVDs are out, I can't get enough of this show.  It's amazing how good it is still today.  Sure some of the dialog is now dated and the stories are very straight forward but that's what is so good about Hawaii Five-O.  That and the fact that Steve McGarrett is the coolest cop IN THE WORLD.  This season, we start to see some repeating themes from the first 3 seasons and it give the show some continuity and character development.

3365909,5,B0014FAIXE,"Hawaii Five-0: The Fourth Season delivers more of what we love most about the show in 24 exciting remastered episodes.
All of the episodes are once again digitally remastered, looking very pristine for shows from 1971 that are 37 years old. The only hint of grain is in the occasional piece of stock footage that appears in the episodes.
Despite the now ubiquitous disclaimer on the box, none of the episodes appear to have been cut based on run times and my extensive memory of the shows from VHS tapings.

There is one small change from previous seasons:  the discs themselves no longer feature artwork this time around, probably to save on costs.  Instead, they are the standard CBS DVD silver with the show logo.

As before, episode promos are included for some of the shows, although fewer than in previous seasons.

This season is one of the very best, with a number of excellent episodes and very few stinkers, if any, in the bunch.  In fact, a few of the episodes are downright edgier in terms of content than previous seasons, including one which features several ethnic slurs from a thug that Paramount's editing department left intact.
The best episode in my opinion is the season opener, ""Highest Castle, Deepest Grave"", in which a millionaire (Herbert Lom from the ""Pink Panther"" movies) is implicated in the 10-year-old murder of his wife.  Watching a great theatrical actor of Lom's stature clash with Jack Lord makes their many scenes together sizzle with dramatic tension.

Other stories from this season include a plot to kill the Governor, a traveler's check scam masterminded by a college professor, a serial killer who dresses up his victims, a soldier accused of rape, a man who is murdered at his own birthday party, an embezzler who gets rolled by hippies, a psychotic sniper, a great caper episode about a carefully-plotted armored car heist, and another two-parter featuring everyone's favorite Five-0 villain Wo Fat.

The season features loads of other great guest stars including John Ritter, Annette O' Toole, Buddy Ebsen, Vic Morrow, Marion Ross, Jackie Cooper, Loretta Swit, Tim O' Connor and Hume Cronyn returning as Lewis Avery Filer, the criminal mastermind he played in Season 3.

All in all, another outstanding effort on the part of CBS DVD and Paramount.  Now we get to wait for the much-anticipated Season Five, which features arguably the best storyline ever from the series.",1213660800,39,2415,4.938271604938271

3365911,5,B0014FAIXE,"Nothing lasts 12 years without having something going for it. In the case of Hawaii Five-O, it easy to dismiss it as a typically television crime drama that got lucky by finding its audience and keeping it. The same could be said for Law and Order. Except, in television years, luck usually runs out after two or three years. Gimmicks get old, the formula is figured out, and sharks are jumped so often they don't even complain.

But shows that last five years, much less 12, have to have something besides luck, gimmicks, and great scheduling. Hawaii Five-O had a number of things going for it. First of all, let's be honest. The setting was, and still is so lush and exotic that it is easily intoxicating. Hawaii is beautiful, and most people either live there or want to live there. Filming on location has always been a blessing when it's been done, and probably no more so than on this series.

Next, Jack Lord, playing Five-O chief Steve McGarrett, was one of a long line of no-nonsense law enforcement figures. The strength, integrity, and dedication of these kinds of characters cannot be overstated, and these characters will always have lots of fans rooting them on, not unlike Law and Order's Jack McCoy.

Finally, watching shows like this is always a treat because you see so many stars that were either big stars enjoying a working Hawaiian vacation, or lots of up and coming stars before they got their big break. Hawaii Five-O was a natural draw for both categories, and it's fun to watch them and remember when.

It's also fun to remember when you could look forward to hearing one of the best and most recognizable theme songs in television history. Not a small thing when you add it with the other factors.

Jack Lord's Steven McGarrett was the heart and soul of the series. His character and the actor respected Hawaii as well. Upon his death and his widow's death in real life, Lord left an estate of forty million dollars to Hawaii.

After only seeing the first season on DVD, I was lucky to see the fourth season. I was disappointed that there are no extras like a documentary, extra footage, old interviews, etc. They do show episode promos which are like television trailers for the upcoming episode.

Every episode is unique, written and acted well. The show's creator and executive producer, Leonard Freeman, was still in charge of production He died in the fifth season but Hawaii Five-O was his baby too.

The story lines were good and always kept up with the events of that time.  The locations were beautiful and I was ready to pack my bags and move to the islands.  The guest stars were A-1 stars, and the use of the local citizens and actors made the show so much more real.

3366047,5,B0014FAIXE,"The original Hawaii Five O was one of the really great television shows.  It was beautifully produced and, for the most part, well acted.  The characters were realistic and believable, although some actresses overdid their histrionics and women were frequently portrayed as being dingy.

One of the great features of this series is the emphasis on the growing change in culture of the time; establishment vs. anti-establishment.  An example is clothing.  Five 0 personnel,  the Governor, and even a lot of the bad guys wear suits and ties, while the ""hip"" people wear sport jackets and Hawaiian shirts.  That's not campy, folks, that's the way it was in the late '60's and early '70's.

Many episodes presented a mystery to the viewers, and we tried to figure out what was going on before McGarrett did.  That added to the fun of watching the shows.  It was the quality of the production, acting, and visuals that made Hawaii Five 0 last for twelve seasons, and run in syndication to this day.  The Leonard Freeman/Jack Lord version is rightly called a classic, something by which similar productions are judged.

The DVD's are excellent, sharp clean images wonderful color and great sound.  This series is a real bargain.  I hope to get all twelve seasons.",1376092800,,1257,4.867924528301887

3366098,5,B0014FAIXE,"Aloha. The fourth season of Hawaii Five-O opens with a bang...not literally, but music-wise. There are some really great moments here, especially in the first episode, which has Chief Inspector Dreyfus as a suspect in a ten year-old murder investigation. I half-expected Inspector Clouseau to come bursting into the ""Rheum"" and bungle everything that McGarrett was doing. Okay...wrong movie. The music during this episode is a welcome change from the same themes always used before, and it keeps on going that way throughout the rest of the season.

Minor note: there's a continuity error in the episode ""Bait Once, Bait Twice."" There's a shot of the woman's feet, and they're naked. But in the next shot of her feet, they're clothed. I'm just pointing that out.

And the fourth season of Hawaii Five-O is a treat. Includes an episode that deals with racism/rape, two issues which were just unleashing their heads in the '70's. And once again, another unconventional episode ala Season 3's ""Over 50, Steal."" And of course, another exciting episode with Wo Fat (this one a terrific two-parter). The fun in the sun continues with the fourth season of Hawaii Five-O. Be Here. Aloha.",1332720000,,1179,5.010204081632653

McGarrit's character was always pursuing the truth in the episodes instead of trying to simply uphold the laws of the land.  I think it is pointless to compare this show to the cop shows of today because this show was more than a cop show.  It had drama, action, and mixed cynicism on society at that time.  McGarrit's character was a no nonsense cop in a world that was becoming grey.

3366123,5,B0014FAIXE,"The fourth season of Hawaii Five-0 marks the beginning of the era where Jack Lord looks very different than he did in the first three seasons.

There is much debate about this among Five-0 ""junkies"", of which I am one.  Most people I've talked to really don't seem to notice it.  But being naturally picky, and having worked in television myself and having married a man who worked in television for 34 years, I tend to notice things that others don't.

But whether anyone has a background in television or not, all one needs to do is place a closeup of Jack Lord in either Seasons One, Two, or Three next to a closeup of Jack Lord in Season Four.

There's been some changes made.

Personally, my belief is that he had cosmetic surgery at the end of Season Three.  I don't see that there's any problem with that, but lots of fans get angry when this idea is voiced.  But women do it all the time, and actors who star in a long-running series and are bandied about as some sort of sex symbol have pressures put on them [and put pressures on themselves] to maintain an image that the star is younger than their chronological age indicates.  And this certainly had to be the case with Jack; the series was so popular when it went into its 4th season -- and Jack by then was over 50 -- there had to be pressure to maintain his looks, and that only could be done cosmetically.

My response to all that is:  So what?

Female stars have been doing it for decades, and often when the choice was to have cosmetic surgery, shift to playing characters who were older women, or stop appearing in movies altogether.  And in many cases women DID stop acting.  Few female actresses permitted themselves to age on camera and do it gracefully -- Bette Davis and Joan Crawford come to mind.  Others, like Greta Garbo,simply vanished from public view for the rest of their lives.

The same decisions face male actors, and it seems naive for people to refuse to consider that it could be otherwise.

All that said -- Season Four contains many of my favorite Five-0 episodes.  ""Highest Castle, Deepest Grave"" is one of them, and for years I've been trying to find out who wrote the piece of music Mr. Mondrego was playing on the piano when McGarrett shows up early in the show.  It's definitely a classical piece, but not a piece with which I'm familiar.  It could be Liszt or Rachmaninoff, for example.  It's NOT Chopin, Beethoven, or Mendelssohn.  And it's certainly not Bach, who always uses a light touch.

If anyone knows the answer, please tell me!

Season Four was really a great year for Five-0.  There are no bad shows, period.  [To me, bad shows are those in which we barely see McGarrett.  I'm not a Danno fan, and all the Five-0 ""junkies"" out there who know me know I've never been a fan of James MacArthur -- and it's too bad; I keep looking for a show where he looses his persistently wooden manner, but it happens only rarely -- ""Beautiful Screamer"" is probably the only show where he delivers a really good performance [and lots of people disagree with me here].

But to me, a show without McGarrett, or with very little McGarrett, 9 times out of 10 will be a show I rarely watch.

But Season Four doesn't fall into this category -- it's Season Six when we begin the period, mercifully short, when there were too many shows with too little McGarrett.  It's perfectly understandable at the time -- Jack was tired, and Five-0 was an extremely physically demanding show -- and prior to that time he appeared in virtually EVERY scene within a single show.  Although Jack kept in very good physical shape, he was discovering that his body wouldn't take the pounding energy that the show had always demanded.  And the ""joys"" of growing older are NOT fun; our bodies simply will not do what they used to do with practically no effort.

Fortunately for fans, it was a temporary move because McGarrett fans objected wildly, and the show soon returned to lots and lots of McGarrett in almost every show.  I'm not sure how fortunate that was for Jack.

It is important to remember, too, that during the mid-1970s through the time the show ended in 1980, there was very powerful pressure on all TV series to cut down, or preferably cut out, violence.

One has to remember what it was like to live during those years.  Television was receiving LOTS of overwhelming congressional pressure -- and pressure from viewers who found themselves with young children -- to cut out violence.  In a crime series, this is a directive that is very hard to do.

But these are subjects for reviews of the pertinent seasons; I just want to comment here that the middle and later years of Five-0 were written with very powerful, very vocal pressure to curb TV violence. If one is not familiar with the culture of the 1970s, one cannot possibly understand the way Five-0, and many other shows, went through such a dramatic sea change during this period.

That pressure had yet to hit TV series shows.  And for me, when it comes to Season Four, my recommendation is:  If you're a fan of the show, GRAB SEASON FOUR QUICKLY!  It's a season full of real winners!",1247961600,,5122,4.515743756786102
3366124,5,B0014FAIXE,"While other seasons, preceding and subsequent, had standout episodes, season four, as a whole, was a standout, featuring outstanding performances from guest stars, well-written and executed scripts, and the last hurrah for the original foursome (Jack Lord, James MacArthur, Kam Fong, and Zulu who would depart at the end of this season).

The show really got into its groove in a grand way with the first installment, ""Highest Castle, Deepest Grave,"" reminiscent of the classic movie ""Laura"" with rare guest appearances from France Nuyen, movie veteran Herbert Lom, and respected acting coach Jeff Corey. Not only do they excel in their portrayals, star Jack Lord does well as he becomes enamored by the painting that hides a dark mystery.

Besides that particular episode, other noteworthy ones were:

""No Bottles, No Cans, No People"" - Henry Darrow (""The High Chaparral"") is featured as an unscrupulous crime boss intent on proving to other ""hoods"" on the mainland that he is a force to be reckoned with.

""3,000 Crooked Miles to Honolulu"" - Buddy Ebsen, late of ""The Beverly Hillbillies"" and before ""Barnaby Jones,"" guests as a criminal genius who thinks he has a flawless plan to make a fortune off of stolen travelers checks.

""Two Doves and Mr. Heron"" - noteworthy solely for the appearance of a young John Ritter and the late Vic Morrow in a part that is rather provocative for the era

""And I Want Some Candy, and a Gun That Shoots"" - featuring Jeanne Cooper before she became ""Mrs. Chancellor"" on ""The Young and the Restless"" and a young Annette O'Toole. The episode also allows Lord a chance to give commentary about the state of mental hospitals ""revolving door"" policies.

""The Burning Ice"" - Former child star Jackie Cooper gives a rare performance as a doctor whose wife is apparently randomly murdered for her jewels but things, as always, are not all as they appear to be. Lou Antonio is quite good as the sympathetic suspect.

Guest Norman Alden is mostly heard and not seen in ""Rest in Peace, Somebody,"" a taunt episode about a possible assassination plot on an unnamed victim.

""A Matter of Mutual Concern"" proves there is no honor among thieves.

""Nine, Ten, You're Dead"" showcases character actor Moses Gunn as a washed-up boxer who runs afoul of a shady promoter (Albert Paulsen). Guest Frank Webb, who would die tragically three years later, plays an unlikely hit man.

""Odd Man In"" - Hume Cronyn comes back one more time as wily con man Lewis Filer.

""Bait Once, Bait Twice"" features a pre-""M.A.S.H."" Loretta Swit (her third appearance as guest on the show)

""Skinhead"" - commentary on racism and also quite frank in its sexuality

""While you're at It, Bring Me the Moon"" - Barry Sullivan guests as an eccentric millionaire, a la Howard Hughes. Other guests include ""repeat performers"" Milton Seltzer and Ed Flanders.

""Good Night Baby, Time to Die"" - Beth Brickell and William Watson are antagonists in this well-crafted tale.

""Cloth of Gold"" - Ray Danton, Jason Evers, and Jay Robinson guest as the unlikely targets of an mystery murderer, using a most ingenious modus operandi.

""Didn't We Meet at a Murder"" offers three hit ""men,"" all unlikely candidates for the job.

The final episode, ""R & R & R"" delivers a frightening guest turn from Alan Vint and also comments on the tragedy of war.

Surprisingly, one of the weakest episodes in the whole compilation is the two-parter ""The 90-Second War"" with the return of McGarrett's main nemesis Wo Fat (Khigh Dhiegh). Though it also stars movie veterans Donald Pleasance and Dana Wynter, along with returning Roger C. Carmel as Col. Mischa Toptegan, the installment seems rather bloated and slightly confusing, devoid of the usual good storytelling involving Wo Fat.

But that one, along with a couple of other ""clunkers"" doesn't lessen what is arguably one of the best in the show's twelve-year run.

The re-mastered set has good sound, outstanding clarity of picture and color.

I watch this with my little brothers all the time, Five-O is responsible for my 7 year old brother going around saying things like ""groovy"", ""dig"", and ""chickie baby.""  Oh well.  He missed out on the 70's, I guess one little part of it in his vocabulary isn't going to hurt anything.

3366132,1,B0014FAIXE,"This is not a review of the series, which in my opinion is the greatest Crime Drama ever made.  As for the VERY long-awaited DVD release, I've been Very disappointed.  Stated in the fine print on the boxes, unfortunately Paramount/CBS decided to offer us an INCOMPLETE (missing episode(s)) and EDITED collection.  In addition, it's NOT-SO-SHARPLY ""remastered"".  Compared to broadcast recordings, it doesn't appear to be remastered at all to me.  I'm sure that Jack Lord, being the perfectionist he was about this show, would NOT approve.

If I like a show enough to want to collect it and to pay hundreds of $$$ for it, I expect a few minimum basic qualities.  Those are:  EVERY EPISODE, UNEDITED, and digitally remastered at least to the resolution at which it is noticeably clearer than my own recordings.  This collection is missing all of those essential qualities.  So it seems VERY expensive to shell-out ($36 x 12 Seasons == $432) for it when I can record the same thing free.  It's kind-of insulting for Paramount to offer an INCOMPLETE collection at that price.

Unless you don't get re-runs (you'd have to live in Mongolia) and you just can't wait to see the edited episodes they chose to include, it may be well worth just waiting another 2 years or so for the inevitable boxed set.  Of course, a series this popular, will be offered in a boxed set (and for Half that price) after they've exhausted all the individual season sales, as we've seen every Christmas with even less popular series.  Those always include ""Previously Unreleased Episodes"", ""(Complete) Director's Cuts"", and ""High Resolution Digital Remastering"", etc. to compel even those who paid $432 for these first cuts, to buy it too - Exactly what they're withholding from this collection.  And they always come packaged in some collectible tin or box.  Maybe a die-cast Mercury in this case.

2) Ep: ""A Bullet for McGarrett"" Scene: A police psychiatrist goes into further detail/demonstration in order to convince McGarrett that hypnosis certainly could be the weapon he faces.

When I began playing it, I noticed interlacing artifacts whenever there was movement within a frame. I thought it might have been a problem with my equipment, but the other episodes played fine.

The discs do not feature images of the Five-0 boys as they did for Seasons 1-3, and I hope they put them back on for the remaining seasons.

And yet the themes in the episodes resonate today.  Buy it, be there, Aloha!
The stories are getting very gritty and edgy - more of the seamy underbelly of paradise. My favorite is Skinhead, featuring an extremely creepy and frightening monster; the way the boys handle learning a certain secret shows them as very professional. The cross-exam of the rape victim makes abundantly clear how far women have come in certain respects, something often taken for granted these days. Also love Cloth of Gold, with a profoundly moving sad twist and a streak of kinky sleaze. There's a wonderful caper story in For a Million-Why Not? Both of these are terrific Danny episodes. Another great caper in 3000 Crooked Miles to Honolulu, which also shows how the death of an innocent young woman affects those close to her and the Five-0 boys.
