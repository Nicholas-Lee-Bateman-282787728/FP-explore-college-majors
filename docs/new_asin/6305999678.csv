1103192,1,6305999678,I nearly bought this thing on DVD looking at the reviews given. I rented the video and believe this mess is  way below 'Street Trash'. The recommendation for its 'black humor' is not true. There is no 'black  humor'.There is only 'sick' exploitation. If you have to see this thing rent  it. Don't waste your money on a purchase.,942192000,2,328,4.52542372881356
1103262,3,6305999678,"Low budget movies are a dime a dozen, but once in a while we find

a gem.  Found one in this movie,  yes its a strange one, but

the director took a stange direction with this one and it works.

Makes a low budget movie feel like a almost regular weird movie.

Just a bit too much of one character (the warden) but the movie

flows pretty good...  hey, now that's quite a tongue on that lady.

The movie falls into the: Must be seen once Category.",1136246400,4,447,4.045977011494253
1103263,1,6305999678,"""Attack of the Killer Tomatoes"" is givin credit the credit for being the worst film ever made, and rightly so. This movie may very well be a very close runner up. This film very much has the same feel as Killer Tomatoes, but if you liked that you can probably watch this.  But for the rest of you there's absolutely nothing enjoyable at all about this on any level. Calling it schlock would be insulting to schlock movies. The story is so completely aimless; ridiculous and incoherent I could barely sit through it. I doubt that anyone who was in the film even puts it on their resume' it's so indescribably awful and embarrassing. I got to wonder how desperate Melinda Clarke and Robert Englund was to do such a movie? Did the director have some sort of dirt on them or something? I just cannot fathom what came over them. I honestly wish the rating systems had integers, because even zero stars is too good for this drek. Even on the cheese whiz scale I'd give it negative three stars. Plus, it has got to be one of the worst transfers to full screen I've ever seen. Often, the people speaking are only a sliver on the edge of the screen, if on screen at all. I don't think they panned at all; they just stuck it in the middle and scanned away.",1121644800,4,1246,4.3247863247863245
1103264,3,6305999678,"Although all the other reviews of this title are fair and honest, nothing anyone can say will prepare you for the bizarre-o fest that is ""Killer Tongue.""  A worthy companion to ""Brain Damage"" and ""Basket Case.""

Fair warning to those who care about such things...the video transfer on this DVD is simply awful.  It's clearly an old recycled VHS transfer with nothing done to clean it up.  Scene composition is severely compromised and the image is fuzzy and soft throughout.  Sound is OK, but no better than VHS Hi-Fi.  There are absolutely NO extras beyond a handful of trailers for other films also available from Ardustry.  In short, this DVD issue is sadly lacking, but if you're a fan of the flick it will probably do just fine until something better comes along (if ever).",1105920000,9,778,4.718518518518518
1103265,4,6305999678,LOL The killer tongue I liked the movie especially the tongue he was funny and I a into these freaky like movies and the title really says it all Killer tongue and its a really good movie the killer tongue is a nice freaky flick the story could've have been better but what can you expect with a title like that,1095724800,,311,4.114754098360656
1103266,5,6305999678,"Looking at the video box, you might think this is going to be another spoof of those silly 1950's horror films involving radiation poisoned giant animals. You are so wrong.
In a nutshell, a meteor crashes to earth and a chunk is ingested by a former nun waiting for her boyfriend to be released from prison. Her tongue grows to about ten feet long, and eventually talks to her. Hijinks of the most offensive order ensue.
This is such an off the wall surreal nightmare that you must see it to believe it. So many scenes can only be mentioned by their generic names but watch out for the port-a-potty scene, the bathtub scene, the confessional scene, and the super glue scene.
This somehow escaped with an (R) rating. It has a lot of material that kids should not see, but this is also one of the funniest films out there. My one small complaint is that I could not get this in letterbox version, on the TV screen it really suffers. Robert Englund, as the prison director, gives a better performance here than in all the ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" films combined. He shows that his acting genius does not have to include fright makeup, and he should be allowed to do more of these over the top horror comedies. The entire cast looks like they were having a lot of fun here, and it rubs off on the viewer in the right mood. Rent it now!
This is (R) for strong physical violence, gun violence, sexual violence, strong gore, strong profanity, some male nudity, sexual content, strong sexual references, and strong adult situations.",1022630400,9,1527,4.536231884057971
1103267,4,6305999678,"This movie is absolutely crazy! I loved it!

1103268,5,6305999678,"If you would like to watch a very strange horror movie,this one is then a nice choice. When it comes to the plot,the movie is something like this : A couple ( Melinda Clarke & her beau) and two other guys pull off a  robbery. In the middle of the desert,on a  dusty unpaved road,the mastermind  of the crime (Melinda's boyfriend) decides to betray the two cohorts with  the aid of his beloved. Bad for them. They got two deadly enemies,who later  on will do everything to get even with the couple. The police discover who  planned the robbery and arrest him. Melinda,then,not to be caught,hides in a  convent for four years,which is the amount of time the love of her life  stays in jail whose warden is fruity nutty but somehow funny and mean  (Robert ""Freddy Krueger"" Englund).When Melinda is about to meet  her boyfriend who is going to be released from prison in 4 days,a series of  unbelievable incidents,accidents and events happen to them,as well as to  the other characters. An outer space creature possesses Melinda's  beautiful  body,mind,face,hair(!) and tongue. Her four poodles also change and become  her and the creature's bodyguards : THEY TURN INTO A HOMO,2 DRAG QUEENS and  a TRANSVESTITE ! The effects are nice (produced by BOB ""HELLRAISER  PTs. 1,2,3 & 4"" KEEN),the producer is Christopher Figg (HELLRAISER  PTs 1,2,3 & 4) and DOUG ""PINHEAD-HELLRAISER"" BRADLEY takes  part in it. It's a very weird but original flick. I recommend you watch it if  you a real horror movie lover. If not do not dare to watch it. You may not  enjoy it or have the guts to get a kick out of it.",964742400,6,1593,4.637992831541219
1103269,5,6305999678,"I love this video!  I have been recommending it to everyone I know that has an appreciation for the bizarre, sci-fi, poodles, and of course, tongues.  Somewhat reminds me of Little Shop of Horrors, a Divine movie,  and any 1950s B movie.",947203200,2,237,4.595238095238095
1103270,1,6305999678,"I once got a free Laserdisc of that film and I'll have to advise you not to buy this pile of rubbish. If you think this might be interesting because of Englund or Mindy Clark, forget it! This so called ""movie""  tries to be a prison drama, monster film and ""Priscilla, Queen of The  Desert"" all rolled into one.

7898872,2,6305999678,"Released in 1996, Killer Tongue stars Melinda Clarke as a woman hiding out with her four poodles in the desert of the Southwest USA with the cash from a bank robbery while her boyfriend (Jason Durr) is released from a nearby prison. When a meteorite crashes, her pastel-colored poodles morph into four drag queens while her tongue becomes an elongated separate entity that she must learn to control or somehow kill. A mute Nun (Mapi Gal&aacute;n) is also exposed to the meteorite and is converted into a racy majorette. Robert Englund is on hand as a gay prison guard.

The movie plays like a mish-mash of The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, Rocky Horror, Faster Pussycat! Kill! Kill! and Pulp Fiction, but with a micro-budget. If that sounds like itd be good; think again. The plots creative, to say the least, but the writing is more tedious than amusing and the filmmaking is all-around subpar. By the hour-mark I was seriously tempted to stop (or, at least, fast-forward through the rest), but I forced myself to finish it. Thankfully, the last act perks up a bit.

On the positive side, there are about four genuinely funny moments. Both Clarke and Gal&aacute;n are easy-on-the-eyes; the former ultra-sharp with her amazing eyes running around in a skintight PVC suit and the latter donning an alluring outfit &agrave; la Marvels White Queen. There are 2-3 quality songs on the soundtrack/score and the tongue F/X were excellent for 1996 and hold up quite well.

But its all for naught because the movies generally incoherent and tries too hard to be a bizarre cult flick with an overabundance of fruity twaddle.

The film runs 94 minutes was shot in Almer&iacute;a, Andaluc&iacute;a, Spain, with studio stuff done in Madrid.

7898878,3,6305999678,"Director Alberto Sciamma's otherworldly ""Killer Tongue"" is a comedic horror movie like no other, and is worth three stars for concept alone. Made in Spain (though set in the desert southwest of the United States) as ""La Lengua Asesina,"" this freakshow is genuinely novel, and rarely fails to startle. The film opens with a ridiculous revelation (""It all started four years ago with a heist and a kiss..."") to explain the motivations of the star, Candy (Melinda Clarke.) Candy is a bad girl, who with boyfriend Johnny (Jason Durr) commits a robbery. While he does the time for it and is taunted by no other than Elm Street's favorite spawn Robert Englund, Candy hides out in a convent. After a meteorite possesses a bowl of soup, Candy grows a ten foot long, murderous, talking tongue (with fingers!) that makes everyone's lives extremely difficult. Along the way fluorescent poodles are transmogrified in the most outlandish way imaginable, a most unexpected dance number materializes out of nowhere, we learn why it's a bad idea to iron your tongue, there's a gratuitous lesson in diaper folding, and there is lingual surgery performed by a sabre (""Hasta maana, baby!"") To reveal more would take away from the truly surreal onscreen vision: let's just say there's nothing else like it.

The film is by no means perfect; several of the performances are stilted, the image transfer itself is quite subpar, and the script is uneven. The special effects are technically not that amazing, but they work adequately for Sciamma's needs. For a comedy this is a bit gruesome; for a horror film it's a bit heavy-handed on the comedic scale. Overall it is very interesting and definitely worth a viewing for horror fans or fans of B-movies in general, though be prepared for occasionally unexpected sleaze and a plethora of grotesqueness along the way.",1333843200,,1842,4.961165048543689
7898879,3,6305999678,"This is a comedy-cult horror that misses on all cylinders. A space meteor/alien lands in soup as ""boring as nuns"" that is ingested by a woman (Melinda Clarke). She is taken over by an alien tongue and her 4 pet poodles are turned into flaming homosexuals (I didn't write this.). She is awaiting her boyfriend to get out of a Mexican prison, where Robert Englund appears to be the only guard. The movie lacks in horror. The dialouge is bad and lacks the humor and style needed to create a cult plot.
