8171452,1,B0000APVDT,"I got this DVD for Rickshaw Man Directed by Joseph Kuo and it was supposed to be English Dubbed.  Unfortunately, there was no menu option for this film when I put the DVD in my DVD player.  I haven't watched Shaolin Posse yet, but it says that it is in Chinese with English subtitles.  If anyone knows how to access Rickshaw Man please right back.  So far I am not very satisfied with this product.",1228608000,,398,4.266666666666667
