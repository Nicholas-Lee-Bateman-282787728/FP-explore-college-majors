Parallel Trouble Adventure</a>&nbsp;raised my attention about the Tenchi Muyo anime universe, which until then I had avoided like the plague, but then I started hearing rumors about something even more unusual than a well thought out answer to Neon Genesis Evangelion: would I believe, not an ecchi, but a hentai Tenchi Muyo series?...  Okay....  Turns out, such a thing actually exists: Spaceship Agga Ruter, by the Tenchi Muyo creator, Masaki Kajishima, and it, too, fits into the all encompassing Tenchi Muyo universe,... sort of.

Taiyo is an orphan, raised alone to manhood by Kei, the avatar of an intelligent starship, the Agga Ruter, who has taught him everything she knows about how to communicate with people.  Meaning have lots of sex.  With her.  However, now he has become a man and must now actually communicate with people.  Meaning have lots of sex.  With them.  Do you get the picture yet?  Clearly SOMETHING is a bit wrong with Kei, and it turns out there may be a reason: part of the Agga Ruters central circuit is missing, which our heroes now go in search of.

Fortunately (?), other people start showing up, especially beautiful young ladies: a space pirate who transforms into a beast, a spaceship captain who has lost her dream, a military officer with an enormous family debt, and an aristocrat with a Secret, all of whom are playing dating sims to show you the kind of love lives they are having.  But now a strangely behaving (unusually calm and super strong) Taiyo, still guided by a relentlessly teaching Kei, proceeds to help them with their problems.  As a result, his harem keeps growing.

What this doesnt truly tell is just how fascinating this series is, outside of the wacky humor and the sex scenes which because this is a softcore hentai series from 1998-1999, have less to show than an average episode of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/New-Cutey-Honey/dp/B003ZKC2JY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">New Cutey Honey</a>, although the characters are clearly having sex.  Strange mysteries surround the Agga Ruter, and dangerous thugs are committing serious crimes, including the 15-year-old murder of Taiyos parents and everyone else but Taiyo aboard their spaceship.  Unfortunately, this OVA series apparently ended several episodes prematurely, leaving the mysteries unsolved and Taiyos harem only partially filled.  The story in fact was so interesting that the sex scenes were actually somewhat of a distraction.  (Something is clearly wrong with that.)",1518825600,,2682,5.643391521197008

8484070,3,B005R2OUKM,"If you've seen certain sci-fi space themed anime series this with be an amusing romp.  For others the humor may fall flat. The adult content is of mixed quality, the females are nicely drawn but graphic nudity and sexual activity is rather tame.  Those looking for a sexy anime satire might enjoy this.  Those looking for hardcore hentai action might look elsewhere.",1401667200,2,366,4.870967741935484
