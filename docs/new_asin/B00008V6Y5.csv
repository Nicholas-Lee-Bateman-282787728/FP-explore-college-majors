1862776,3,B00008V6Y5,"Caveat 1: I'm not Indian. Caveat 2: I've only been watching movies from India for about 2 years, and I've focused mainly on Bollywood.  Caveat 3: I agree with one reviewer that Hrithik Roshan may be one of the hottest humans alive.

Ahhh. Now to serious business.  Aap, etc., or, ""I Started Liking You,"" is one of my least favorite of Hrithik Roshan's films, and I've seen them all, with the exception of the ones he might have appeared in as a young child and the new one, Guzaarish.  It may even be THE least favorite.  I'm not fond of Amisha Patel, and the story line of this one, even for a 1990s Bollywood flick, was bizarre.  I know, I know--you say ""but it was released in 2002, you idiot!""  It was still made in the style of the previous decade, with the hokey dances and ultra-conservative dress.  Don't get me wrong--I like those, too!  This one just wasn't very well done.

That said, if you are a Hrithik Roshan fan, you have to watch it for completeness.  Ditto if you are an Amisha Patel fan or Saif Ali Khan (he has a small part).  I'm definitely not a music expert, but I like ""Ore Gore"", and there's one Hrithik dance number you have to watch, just because it is so bad (no, he doesn't dance badly--the choreography is just...well, you have to see it to believe it. I think there may be red leather fringed pants involved).

This is Hrithik Roshan and Amisha Patel's second appearance together.  The first was in ""Kaho Naa...Pyaar Hai"".  If you have to choose between buying that film and this one (Aap Mujhe Achhe Lagne Lage), buy Kaho Naa...Pyaar Hai, definitely. Can you say ""Ek Pal Ka Jeena""!

You can get movie summaries elsewhere, and this is just my opinion. If you do watch it, just disengage and enjoy!",1293753600,2,1728,4.438095238095238
1862777,2,B00008V6Y5,"The young lovers in this film are exceptional, to look at... and enjoy.  Their love story is intense,
emotional, and hung on the ""incredible"" (not to be believed in modern day life.)  For all of it's good
points, it was an excruciating film to get through -- almost unbearably slow, with dance numbers that were
more extraneous and time-consuming, than truly enjoyable.  Sorry folks, but I have seen a bit of Bollywood.
For this film, it was only the two lovers and their intensity that kept me hanging in there.  Much of the other things were just simply very immature to be acceptable (like the whole boys' school thing).  Otherwise,
I would have called it a huge waste.  Also, the ending was so unbelievable, you'd have thought we were watching
a Terminator resurrection: nothing was logical, nor made much real sense.  Know what I'd really like to see?
A Hindi version of ""Shadow of the Moon"" and ""The Far Pavilions.""  (Surprised they haven't latched onto that, yet.
But most assuredly, PLEASE, without the ensemble cast dancing!!)  Definitely not worth a second viewing. Yet
I really love both of these young stars: Hrithik and Amisha.",1279497600,,1140,4.835051546391752
1862778,4,B00008V6Y5,"Firstly Hrithik is great and very watchable. In fact all the actors are good. The plot is good. The romance is good and there are some catchy songs and fine dances.
The 'but.."" is that the focus of Hrithik's affections is the daughter of a Don and there is some violence around that. In particular there is one extended graphic (and highly unlikely and operatic) scene near the end where there is a fair bit of violence.
So it is one of those Bollywoods that has a different comment for the pre- and post- intermission. The first half has decent romance and the second focuses more on action (and violence which you may want to avoid if this troubles you).",1229990400,11,656,4.475

Sometimes the style may be a bit hard for Americans to take....because they are often not ""realistic"".  But I LOVE the way they highlight love and family.  So many of the joys of life and the virtues that make life worth living...these are in these movies!

Bollywood people really know how to make movies.  Hollywood movies could only dream of coming EVEN close!  The actors are handsome and absolutely entrancing...and the actresses are the most beautiful in the world!

And here is the most handsome man in the whole world...in this movie!

He is an amazing actor, has an amazing sculptured body, and is the BEST dancer in movies these days.  His costar is so beautiful and sweet.  This is not their best movie though..Kaho Nah Pyaar Hai is the one to see them in...(it was their first).

This one is a bit disappointing...even the amazing STARS can't quite make it all that good...too bad.  But worth the watch, all the same.",1170460800,2,1192,4.741463414634146

Am not india and I have been watching Bollywood movies for the last 3 months. I have seen most of Hrithik's movie and loved all of them. This one although the story line was good if left many questions unanswered, wish the writer was more creative with Rohit and Sepna's story.

""Aap Mujhe Achche Lagne Lage"" is one of the first few Bollywood movies I saw as an adult, because, even though my parents are from India, my brother and I didn't watch many Hindi/Bollywood movies growing up. At home, my family either spoke English or Konkani (a language spoken on the western coast of India as well as the official language of the state of Goa, and a minority language in the state of Karnataka and northern Kerala) so with the exception of the sporadic Hindi classes we took as children, we did not have much experience with Hindi. Because we understand very little (just a few random words, phrases, etc.) of Hindi, and subtitles were not available on the VHS tapes, we had to rely on our mom for translation of the dialogue. Though I'm sure she tried her best, what would inevitably happen is that while she was translating one segment of conversation, she would miss the next one, so there would be huge gaps in the translation, and often essential dialogue would deliberately (if she didn't want to translate something, thinking we weren't old enough to hear it) or accidently left out. So we had to figure out the story from the pictures and inconsistent & incomplete translations. As a result, we didn't watch many Bollywood movies growing up (the only Hindi movies I saw in childhood & adolescence were&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gopal-Krishna/dp/B006UXFUME/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gopal Krishna</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Masoom/dp/B0016GOKD0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Masoom</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ramayana/dp/B0002AAMVU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ramayana</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mahabharat/dp/B00023JH72/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mahabharat</a>, and maybe a couple/few others) I can count on one hand (with a couple of extra fingers!) or maybe two hands at the most, the number of Hindi movies I saw as a child and teenager.

But since the advent of DVDs with English subtitles (as well as Youtube, and online movie streaming), I've started watching a lot more Bollywood (and other genre) movies and I've been REALLY enjoying it!! I  Bollywood!

Unfortunately, although I love Amisha Patel and I especially LOVE Hrithik Roshan, ""Aap Mujhe Achche Lagne Lage"" not only was ""a flop"" at the box office, but in my opinion this movie was mediocre at best!! :(

*POTENTIAL SPOILERS AHEAD!!!!**

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Aap-Mujhe-Achche-Lagne-Lage/dp/B000OKZHDQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Aap Mujhe Achche Lagne Lage</a>&nbsp;(translated to ""I Started Liking You"" in English) is about the romance between Rohit (Hrithik Roshan) a young college student studying engineering and Sapna (Amisha Patel) the pampered & sheltered (albeit in a ""gilded cage""!) daughter of a big-time ""underworld Don"" mob leader, Pratap Dholakia (Kiran Kumar). Because of their gangster life, both Pratap and his thug son, Raman (Mukesh Tiwari) have been keeping Sapna under lock & key, for pretty much all her life, never (or barely ever!) allowing her to leave the house, even for school (instead she was taught at home by a tutor) or to make & see any friends.

However, after seeing Sapna in a car, and then subsequently rescuing her from a kidnapping (and potential rape/assault/murder) by some violent criminal rivals of her father, Rohit goes out of his way to see her again, eventually coming to her house during the huge (and essentially public) ""Navratri"" holiday celebrations being held there. Although in the beginning, Raman especially, objects to Rohit's presence, after learning that it was Rohit who saved Sapna from the rival mobsters, he is permitted to continue attending the festivities. During the nine nights of the Navratri (""Nav"" meaning ""nine"" and ""ratri"" meaning ""night"") festival, Rohit and Sapna become very close and fall in love.

Meanwhile, as the mobster wars that Pratap & Raman are involved in, are escalating, they put Sapna under virtual house arrest (even more so than before -- which was already pretty extreme as it is!) and simultaneously make plans to marry her off to an acquaintance in London, in order to send her abroad and get her out of the potential crossfire. So, Sapna is like a bird in a gilded cage, and for the most part,  has absolutely nothing to do but just wait for the day she is sent away to London to be married, and all along still secretly pining for Rohit. In the meantime, he once again goes out of his way help Sapna & manages to spirit her away from the house for some time alone. Yet, terrified for Rohit's safety, both due to fear of her family's reaction, as well as the violence & brutality that surrounds their lives in general, Sapna keeps her relationship with Rohit a secret from her mobster father, and her violent thug brother, Raman. In fact, Pratap & Raman don't even find out about Sapna & Rohit's covert romance, until somewhere around (if not OVER!) half-way into the movie, and there are quite a few long dance/song sequences in the interim, so that should show how drawn-out, and to some degree, boring, that the storyline of this movie really is.

Eventually, Sapna escapes from her house, and hides out at Rohit's college. Pratap, and especially Raman are furious when they discover that Sapna has run away -- and even more so when they discover that she is hiding with Rohit at his college. So just like any other big-time mobster, they handle it like the violent thugs they are..............they converge on Rohit's college in force, and kidnap both Rohit, and Sapna. While Sapna is taken home under protest with plans to immediately send her to London, Raman and his thugs beat Rohit to within an inch of his life and leave him to die in some junkyard. In the meantime, Sapna who has been confined to her home, overhears her father on the phone with Raman talking about the best way to cover-up the murder of Rohit. Overcome with grief and guilt for bringing Rohit into her world of violence, Sapna swallows handfuls of pills just before leaving to be taken to the airport for the flight to London, and she leaves behind a suicide note which her sister-in-law (Raman's wife) Nisha (Nishigandha Deolkar) finds after her departure -- and which she confronts Pratap with, condemning her father-in-law for keeping Sapna trapped like a bird in a gilded cage, and subjecting her to such a violent and repressive life that it has driven her away and driven her to suicide.

Its no wonder that this movie was a failure, lambasted by critics and the public alike, when the viewer is expected to believe ludicrous storylines & plot twists that literally stretch the bounds of credulity. Like, for example, the ridiculous idea that a man targeted by mobsters is savagely beaten and left for dead (one would think that if the intention was to kill Rohit, that they would have used a gun & shot him at least at some point during the attack, to ensure that he was truly dead) -- by professional thugs that one would expect that they'd be able to tell the difference between dead and alive, and then somehow not only gets revived, but awakens with some kind of superhuman, professional wrestler powers (complete with detailed exposure of Hrithik's sudden & miraculously grown body-builder muscles) giving him the strength to be able to send his mob attackers flying over a dozen feet with just one punch!

As for Sapna's suicide attempt, although I  Amisha Patel, and in general, think that she's a great actress (I LOVED her in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tathastu/dp/B000I0RVRM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tathastu</a>) in this movie, and especially the scenes where she's called upon to display deep suicidal distress, her hysterical overacting complete with hyperventilating, wheezing and gasping for air like someone in the throes of such a severe asthma attack that the you want nothing more than to give her an inhaler or a nebulizer full of Albuterol!

This could have been a good movie, but unfortunately it wasn't. The only redeeming qualities were the valiant (but largely unsuccessful) efforts by the actors & actresses, especially Hrithik Roshan, Amisha Patel, and Mukesh Tiwari to make the film a success. Unfortunately, the poor dialogue, poor choreography & poor action to deliver was too much to overcome. Both Hrithik Roshan & Amisha Patel are gorgeous and are a great leading actor & actress, but just like every single role in this movie, there is NO decent character development to speak of. The whole movie is very clichd, going all the way back to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/West-Side-Story/dp/B00EUJ8FCM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">West Side Story</a>&nbsp;and Shakespeare's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Romeo-and-Juliet/dp/B00JSZ2A9W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Romeo and Juliet</a>!!

I feel so sorry for both Hrithik Roshan & Amisha Patel (as well as any & all of the other actors/actresses involved or associated with this movie) because neither their beauty, their great acting, nor their genuine efforts were enough to save this movie from being the disappointing flop it turned out to be! :(",1399507200,3,9908,5.622489959839357
