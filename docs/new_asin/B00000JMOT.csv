7912850,3,B00000JMOT,"I ordered ""The Best Of British Cinema ~ 5 decade of classic British films hoping to see many great films. What you do get is a narrative of over 40 excerpts of truly great films. This is my fault for not reading the item description more carefully. Oops.
Most films are at least 3 star films with many 4 and.some 5 star productions  but as excerpts .I was disappointed to say the least.
 For some this package will be perfect . You are introduced to wonderful films that you will want to see in their full length version.
There is footage of the never seen I, Claudius (Josef von Sternbethg ,director).Its always a pleasure to ""stare at Vivian Lee"".That was a plus .Many important directors films are screened such as Korda and his magical touch. In fact there are dozens of wonderful actors and directors. Its a nice intro to a few films you may have missed because of limited circulation .
 As long as you are aware this is filled with excerpts  and not feature length films,I say go for it.",1370390400,,993,4.43956043956044
7912851,2,B00000JMOT,"I thought I was a British-movie fanatic but apparently not if it means liking this ponderous and boring waste of time.  Almost everything mentioned is a 1930's epic of some kind, mostly by Alexander Korda.  I'm in my mid-seventies and even for me the 1930's were much too long ago.  Forget this one.",1332720000,,299,4.60377358490566
7912852,3,B00000JMOT,"I purchased this dvd thinking it was going to be about ALL the best British Films however I found it only foccused on the Alexander Korda years. I'm not saying those were not great years and there was some interesting visuals in this, however the dvd itself is totally misleading in what it contains. Rather expense for what it contained and the very poor image quality.",1308182400,,370,4.621212121212121
7912853,1,B00000JMOT,"The title and packaging of this Image Entertainment DVD are extremely misleading. This documentary, which claims to cover five decades of ""the best of British cinema,"" does not include segments about David Lean, Ealing Studios, or Powell and Pressburger. What you get instead are five episodes titled ""Private Lives,"" ""The Gentle Touch,"" World of Adventure,"" ""The Romantics,"" and ""A Class of Their Own."" And the content of each episode is limited to clips and narration which reveal the stunning information that ""In this movie there is this scene depicting private lives,"" ""In this movie there is this scene depicting the gentle touch,"" ""In this movie there is this scene depicting the world of adventure,"" etc. Honestly - the episodes never get any more informative or entertaining than that.",1069113600,27,794,5.2109375
7912854,3,B00000JMOT,"Billed as ""The Best Of British Cinema"" it might better be titled ""The Best Of Alexander Korda"" since most of the films depicted were produced by him and London Films.  They are from the 30's and 40's -- 2 decades rather than 5.  It's nice to see clips from the films included but not nearly as comprehensive as one was led to believe.",1050364800,17,334,4.285714285714286
