8092991,5,B000BV5RZQ,"Before I go into how great the workout is, Im going to warn any potential buyers about the format. The DVD comes in the PAL format. The DVD players from America can only accept DVDs in the NTSC format! DO NOT PURCHASE THIS IF YOU ARE NOT WILLING TO USE THIS IN AN UP TO DATE COMPUTER OR ARE WILLING TO PURCHASE A PAL PLAYER!!

Okay, the DVD is loaded with a ton of features. You have the opportunity to do the workout in segments, all at once, with commentary, and without commentary (music only). The DVD also offers a behind-the-scenes feature that shows the auditioning process prior to filming as well as interviews for the cast. There are some music videos, and previews for other workouts. Its the equivalent to purchasing a collectors edition of a classic film in cinema.

In the holding case, the consumer also receives a list of free ringtones to choose from (these may not be accessible for every phone).

The workout is for people who have a firm grasp of aerobic exercise. This is not for beginners. The setting is an exciting dance stage filled with sexy, fit people, and it made me feel like I was part of an interactive concert. Youre going to need a lot of room to safely do the routines, and the music is similar to those Dance Dance Revolution games in the arcade; its energetic, poppy, and loud. If you're an intermediate aerobic participant that loves a fun filled workout, and if you have the software to play this disc in the States, give this a try. Youll be sweating and getting fit all at the same time.",1519948800,,1528,4.45
8092992,4,B000BV5RZQ,"Great workout DVD. Unfortunately, the instructor gives very few previews for the upcoming move, so you would have to watch it several times before you're comfortable and feel as if you can keep up.  The dance section has more previews, but there are several choreographed moves to learn at one time. I enjoy it now, but it was frustrating in the beginning.",1454457600,,356,4.741935483870968
8092993,2,B000BV5RZQ,"This dance routine is fun and definitely lives up to its name, however for a girl who is looking to build more of a ballet dancer physique, it wasn't the fit for me. If you are already thin, this probably won't make you bulk up much, however if you are a little thicker and are looking to get long, lean legs, this is probably not the workout for you.",1365379200,,351,4.101449275362318
8092994,3,B000BV5RZQ,"Choreography is kinda hard, different from the other more current Pump it Ups. Music is not as fun either. Not the best video out of the others.",1361059200,,144,4.37037037037037
8092995,4,B000BV5RZQ,"Fun dance combo! Not as challenging as Deanne Berry, but I like this one a lot because it is great for those days when you don't want to work as hard you normally do. On days when I just need to get some movement in, and break a good sweat, rather than work my butt off, I put this on. It's a great, low impact dance combos, BUT it's also got more challenging dance combinations, then other dance/workout vids.

The advantage of low intensity with higher challenging dance combinations is you don't get bored! You still get the fun and appeal that your looking for... Plus you can concentrate on looking good, when doing your moves, rather than just trying to get sweaty. Discipline is just as important as breaking a sweat.

Also, there appears to be either dance glitches or editing glitches. There are some real confusing parts in this vid. Hopefully, they came out with a new edition of this. Also, sometimes the woman has an annoying voice, the way she screams.",1328054400,,966,4.545977011494253
8092996,2,B000BV5RZQ,"I love ministry of sound, and I have the first two in the Pump it up series. I really enjoy the beach body workout best. The problem I have with this workout is that the safety instructions that should be given durng the routine are given seperately in an ""introduction"" part on the menu. I was in a hurry to get started and clicked the ""Play all' option. the first burn it up routine was a really good workout with no problems. it then goes to the ""dance"" routine. I strongly suggest skipping this routine. I did it, and there was parts of flinging their heads around.  now my neck is all sore. I later watched the introduction that says don't do the head rolls unles your trained or you could injure your neck. this info would have been better given at the time. Also the dance routine is nearly impossible to follow and My heart rate went way down as i couldn't keep up and follow the complicated moves.  That being said the first 20 minute routine was really good for intermediate advanced exercisers. my heart rate was through the roof. I will reserve this dvd to just use that portion when I'm doing one of my ""short"" days. ti would have been better if the entire thing could have been the workout (the whole 40 minutes) and not had the dance section at all. I usually like to workout at least 40 minutes. The 20 minute part was good, but it sort of ruins it for me that its only 20 and the second half is worthless as a workout routine for me.  Just be careful and watch the ""introduction/tips' portion first as you won't find safety advice during the routine....",1293926400,6,1570,4.351535836177474
8092997,5,B000BV5RZQ,"This is one of my new favorite dance workout videos.  It is a high-energy/low-impact routine that has a great soundtrack and very nice cues and explanations of the moves.  As long as you keep moving and get into it, it's a great total body workout!",1269820800,2,248,4.488888888888889
