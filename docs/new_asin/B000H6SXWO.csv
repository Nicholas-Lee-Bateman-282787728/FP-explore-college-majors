2629186,4,B000H6SXWO,"Good. Could've been better IMO.

1. Team Legends vs Team Spirit Squad 5/10

This match wasn't gonna be a classic, it was good for what it was worth. Great to see all the legends compete in the ring but other that that, a DUD.

2. US Championship Chris Benoit vs Chavo Guerrero 6.5/10

The fued was good and bad. I didn't like the fact Vicki was involved though. The match was a nice brawl, but brawls get repetitive which exactly what the match was. Not bad though.

3. Womens Championship Lita vs Mickie James 4/10

Kind of sloppy, plus we saw this at CS, and Raw two weeks in a row back in the summertime so no anticipation. Sort of boring as well but I enjoyed the false finishes.

4. Team DX vs Team Rated RKO 8.5/10 MOTN

A very fun match which makes me remember why i'm really entertained by WWE. Could've went on longer though.

5. First Blood Match Mr. Kennedy vs Taker 7.5/10

Could've told a better story but not bad either. The finish was cool though.

6. Team Cena vs Team Show 7/10

Finlay carried this match all the way, yes he had to carry nine men. Pretty good.

7. World Championship King Bookah vs Batista 7/10

Their best encounter. Sad to see the King lose though.

Overall 40.5/10 Pretty good PPV. Reccommended. Extras is a McMahon Cartoon and the First ever Classic SS Match Team Hogan vs Team Andre the Giant. Good match with JBL and Cole on commentary which made it better.",1171756800,2,1397,4.3604651162790695
2629187,4,B000H6SXWO,"Last year, it was a RAW vs. SmackDown elimination match & years before that, it was RAW only & SmackDown only elimination tag matches.  This year they did something that was very unique when you put it on paper...they took feuds from all 3 brands and mixed them together to give us (for the first time I can remember) teams featuring stars from each brand mixed together in the most unique Survivor Series in years.  Unfortunately, only 1 of these interbrand matches actually lived up to the hype while the SmackDown matches (minus the main event) were the ones that stole the show in the end.

Survivor Series Elimination Match

Ric Flair, Dusty Rhodes, Sgt. Slaughter, Ron Simmons w/Arn Anderson vs. Kenny, Johnny, Nicky, Mikey w/Mitch - With the exception of one Squad member (don't remember which one), the Squad swept Flair's entire team until the end when Flair got the victory only to be beaten down afterwards.  The Squad would be gone from WWE the next night.

United States Championship Match

Chris Benoit vs. Chavo Guerrero w/Vickie Guerrero - Good wrestling match between these two and unlike the Mysterio matches, you don't have to worry about all the ""Eddie"" references throughout the whole match.

Women's Championship Match

Lita vs. Mickie James - This was Lita's last match & it was actually pretty good between these two and was tons better than their Cyber Sunday match.  After the match, they had Cryme Tyme come out & completely humiliated Lita (with the help of J.B.L.).

As a personal note, it's just a damn shame that Lita's entire WWE career ended the way it did.  The fact is that she was the one who started to turn the womens division around with her lucha libre style that you didn't see from women.  She was the won who put the Womens division back on the map when the division was reduced to champions like Stephanie McMahon, Harvey Wippleman, & The Kat and was the one who carried Trish Stratus in matches when she was nothing more than a girl hired for just her looks like most of the WWE divas are today.  She came back from a neck injury WORSE than Austin's or Benoit's were & because of a situation that happened her in personal life outside of the wrestling ring & outside the business...it overshadowed her entire career.  It's a damn shame.

Survivor Series Elimination Match

Triple H & Shawn Michaels, Jeff Hardy, Matt Hardy & CM Punk and vs. Edge, Randy Orton, Johnny Nitro, Mike Knox & Gregory Helms - Bottom line, this match was just like every other match DX has been involved in since reuniting...they completely squashed the other team.  The match had it's humorous moments like Mike Knox elimination, Team DX's reaction to it, and HBK's photo pose with Melina but again, it was just a completely squash.  Randy Orton's Survivor Series undefeated streak of 3-0 comes to an end.  The personal highlight for me was seeing the crowd chant for C.M. Punk while Triple H was tryin' to do his usual DX mic work.

First Blood Match: Undertaker vs. Mr. Kennedy - Just like their match at No Mercy, this delivered.  Kennedy kept up with Taker & held his own.  The ending was a little cheap with M.V.P. but it kept the door open for more of this feud which I have no problem with.  This was the match of the night for me.

Survivor Series Elimination Match

John Cena, Kane, Lashley, Sabu & RVD vs. Big Show, Test, MVP, Finlay & Umaga - This was the elimination match I talked about earlier that actually lived up the hype it was given.  This was given enough time to make it something worth watching again and the booking was done real well to set up future feuds (ala Lashley/Big Show & Cena/Umaga).  Again, the best elimination match of the night.

World Heavyweight Championship Match

King Booker vs. Batista - This match was about one thing, Batista winning the belt back in the arena he lost it in.  This was better than their SummerSlam match but that's not saying much.  This was another performance that Batista ""walked through"" to the point to where the people started to leave & you could hear small ""boring"" chants.  Again, it wasn't a horrible match but it was just dry & boring.  If you want the best exchange between these two, check out the No Mercy match involving them, Lashley, and Finlay.

Bonus Match: Hulk Hogan, Bam Bam Bigelow, Don Muraco, Ken Patera, and Paul Orndorff vs. Andre the Giant, One Man Gang, King Kong Bundy, Rick Rude, Butch Reed - Just like the Great American Bash 2005, the best match on the DVD...was a match that didn't even happen on the card.  This was the main event of the first Survivor Series with Michael Cole & J.B.L. doing the commentary on this one and as a side note, despite what Michael Cole says...One Man Gang IS NOT DEAD!  The match was teased as the first Hogan/Andre confrontation since WrestleMania III and it did a good job of leaving the people wanting more but not feeling ripped off.  This was classic WWF (not WWE, but World Wrestling FEDERATION) and really showcased how Bam Bam Bigelow was one of the best ""big men"" wrestlers in the history of the business.  Rest In Peace ""Beast From The East.""

DVD extras include a Mr. McMahon cartoon & Lita's farewell interview.

Overall, this was a good PPV to watch & the match in the bonus section is just a classic match that will make up for the earlier elimination matches.  I recommend.",1170892800,11,5338,4.605291005291005
2629188,4,B000H6SXWO,"To be honest, I haven't bought a Survivor Series since 2002 but I heard so many good things about this one, I plunked down $16 to see it and glad I did for the most part. Let's get to it:

""Nature Boy"" Ric Flair, ""The American Dream"" Dusty Rhodes, Ron Simmons & Sgt. Slaughter Vs. The Spirit Squad (Traditional Survivor Series Match) - Not much going on in this match as it actually doesn't pick up until near the end. Arn Anderson ended up getting thrown out of the match as well as one of the S.S. members. Flair, in the end, used his dirty bag of tricks as well as his figure four leglock to win the match for his team after facing 3 on 1 odds. He wins but takes a whoopin after the match from the S.S.

Chris Benoit Vs. Chavo Gurrerro (WWE U.S. Title Match) - Very good bout that ends when Vicki Gurrerro gets knocked off the apron by Benoit on accident as Chavo tried to escape the Sharpshooter. Didn't matter as Benoit took the match with his Crippler Crossface for the win.

Mickie James Vs. Lita (WWE Women's Title Match) - Much like Trish Vs. Lita back at WWE Unforgiven, this was a very good contest. Regardless of what I think of Lita personally, she's a hell of a talent and its kind of sad that her career (in the short run) will be tainted by a personal choice with that whole Matt Hardy/Edge affair. That should have nothing to do with the type of performer she is/was.

Anyway, both Lita and Mickie gave their all and it ends with Mickie using one of Lita's moves against her with a jumping DDT! Afterwards, Cryme Time comes out and sells Lita's personal belongings to the crowd including JBL from SmackDown!

Team DX (Matt & Jeff Hardy, C.M. Punk, Shawn Michaels & HHH) Vs. Team RKO (Edge, Randy Orton, Johnny Nitro, Gregory Helms & Mike Knox) - Before I talk about the match, I have to say Team DX easily got one of the loudest (if not THE loudest) crowd response of the night! The interaction with the crowd was amazing! WWE, if you ever decide to expand DX, please consider The Hardyz and C.M. Punk with DX! Heck, The Hardyz and C.M. Punk alone would make a pretty good unit!

Anyway, as for the match itself, it was a good blend of action and comedy! Knox gets eliminated about 15 seconds into the match while there was another funny moment when Melina (Johnny Nitro's girlfriend/manager) was cuddling up to Shawn (not realizing it was him)!

It ends up being a route as Team DX doesn't suffer one elimination! One ironic moment (for me) was watching Shawn Michaels and Jeff Hardy do a tandem risk move on Rated RKO! Its ironic to me considering how much Jeff used to be compared to HBK at one time.

Anyway, it ends when Edge and Orton realizes they are outnumbered and try to leave only to have Matt, Jeff and C.M. Punk bring them back for DX to finish off. Good match up. Would've been better if there would've been eliminations on both sides but still worth a look.

The Undertaker Vs. Mr. Kennedy (First Blood Match) - This match is mostly Undertaker. Ends when MVP (looking for payback on Mr. Kennedy) accidentally hits UT with a chair, causing him to bleed and lose the match. This royally p*sses off UT as he proceeds to beat Mr. Kennedy into oblivion with one of the best chair shots this year if not EVER in pro wrestling!

Team Cena (John Cena, Rob Van Damn, Sabu, Kane & Bobby Lashley) Vs. Team Big Show (The Big Show, Umaga, Test, Finley & MVP) - In the land where ECW was born, the fans are still unforgiving towards John Cena as he easily got the most boos of everyone in this match! Even TBS got more cheers (especially when he was beating on Cena)!

Anyway, it ends when Cena (for the umpteenth time) gets TBS in his F.U. slam (with help from Bobby Lashley). It was actually a good match overall.

Batista Vs. King Booker (World Heavyweight Title Match) - Probably the weakest match on the card but not bad! Got a surprise when Batista actually used top rope offense during this match with a shoulderblock off the ropes! Ends when ""The Animal"" clocks Booker with the World Title belt!

Overall, a good buy and has two good bonus features. The final interview with Lita AND a 1987 Survivor Series match with Hulk Hogan, Paul Orndorff, Bam Bam Bigelow, Don Muraco and Ken Patera Vs. Andre The Giant (R.I.P.), One Man Gang, King Kong Bundy, ""The Natural"" Butch Reed and ""Ravishing"" Rick Rude (R.I.P.). By the way, I want to thank one reviewer for telling me that One Man Gang is still living! On the DVD, Michael Cole says he's dead but that's not true at all! Can't believe they would leave that on there.

2629190,4,B000H6SXWO,"This is a very good ppv for both Smackdown and Raw. Although ECW had several superstars involved in some of the matches, it was Raw and Smackdown that provided all the matches. The DX/Rated RKO fued continued as DX was victorious in their match, Batista became a two time champ after finally beating Booker T's reign as champ, and Ken Kennedy nearly got his head literally caved in after Taker went crazy after their first blood match...

Team Legend vs. Team Spirit Squad

This was an okay match to start the show, but nothing to really care about. In the first five minutes Arn Anderson, Farooq, and two members of the S.S. were sent out after a mini brawl took place on the outside. The match continued but wound up with Flair facing the three remaining members of the squad. However Flair survived the match after forcing Johnny to tap to the Figure Four Leg Lock. 6/10 Sole Survivor - Ric Flair

USA Championship

Chris Benoit [Champion] vs. Chavo Guerrero:

This was a solid match between these two. Both men use a lot of great wrestling with all their signature moves. At several points Viki Guerrero tried to interfere, but at the end of the match Benoit knocks Viki off the arpon and applies the crossface to Chavo and Chavo taps. 8/10

Women's Championship

Lita [Champion] vs. Mickie James:

And yet another wwe diva that can actually WRESTLE has to leave the wwe again. This was a solid match between these two, as expected. Mickie really had the crowd in her corner as the entire audience chanted lines at Lita that probably shouldn't be repeated here. [Although if you have the ECW ONS DVDs, those are the same chants that are loud and clear!!1]In the end Lita tries to go for her moonsault, but Mickie kicks out and nails her big DDT to win her second women's championship. 8/10

First Blood Match

The Undertaker vs. Ken Kennedy:

In my opinion, this was okay, but not as great as it could have been. Maybe it was the rumors that Taker was injured, I don't know what, but this was mostly wrestling all over the ring, not much weapon use. Kennedy does get his face rammed into the announce table a couple of times, but for the most part they just punch each other around. At one point MVP comes in looking like he is going to help Kennedy, but instead tries to help Taker get the win. However that backfires after MVP hits Taker with a chair by accident and Taker starts to bleed and losses the match. 7.5/10

[After the match the UT levels Kennedy with the most violent chairshot of the year, it's that brutal!!!!]

5 on 5 Classic Survivor Series Match

Team DX vs. Team Rated RKO:

Team DX consisted of HHH, Shawn Michales, CM Punk, and The Hardy Boyz. Team Rated RKO consisted of Randy Orton, Edge, Johnny Nitro, Gregory Helms, and Mike Knox. In the first minute of action Mike Knox is eliminated after some sweet chin music. Next to go was Johnny Nitro after being pinned by Matt Hardy. Gregory Helms was the next to go, which left Randy Orton and Edge alone against five men. They tried to run but are brought back to the ring and both get eliminated. 8.5/10 [This was okay, but would have been more of a match had Rated RKO's team been able to wrestle more.]Survivors- DX,CM Punk, and The Hardy Boyz.

5 on 5 Classic Survivor Series Match

Team Cena vs. Team Big Show:

Team Cena included John Cena, Sabu, Rob Van Dam, Kane, and Bobby Lashley. Team Big Show included Big Show, Umaga, Test, Finaly, and MVP. Umaga goes crazy again and takes out everyone with a tv monitor and gets disqualified. This was more of a wrestling match and members of both teams started to get eliminated. Finally it came down to Bobby Lashley and Cena against the Big Show. Cena gets the Big Show up on his shoulders and gives him the Fu for the win. 8.5/10 Survivors - Cena, Lashley

World Heavyweight Championship

Booker T[Champion] vs. Batista:

This was a Smackdown main event level of a match on a ppv, not very good to close the show. Some back and forth action, but the crowd becomes disappointed with the match and starts a boring chant. At one point Batista does a flying shoulder tackle off the top rope, which was a rare move for the big man. Booker T tried to hit Batista with the title near the end but Batista got a spinebuster on Booker T and wins the title for a second time. 7.5/10

Survivor Series is recommended for the DX/Rated RKO team match, the Cena/Show team match, the women's championship, USA Championship, and the chairshot on Ken Kennedy. A good Survivor Series, but not the best or most memorable one.",1165449600,2,4530,4.5054945054945055
2629191,5,B000H6SXWO,"Match 1 Legends (Ric Flair, Ron Simmons(Farrooq from APA), Dusty Rhodes, Sgt. Slaughter, and Arn Anderson vs Spirit Squad

WINNER - Legends

I don't know how Ric Flair can keep doing this at his age, but he fails to dissapoint. He still has some gas left in the tank and it showed in this match. Flair was the only survivor left on his team and locked in his signature Figure-Four to win the match. Afterwards took a beating by the spirit squad.

Match 2 U.S Champion Chris Benoit vs Chavo Guerrero

WINNER - Chris Benoit

Benoit is one of my favorites and one of the tuffest in the business. He continues to do his flying headbutt move even after he got injured by it a couple years ago. Its an ok match topped off with the rabid wolverine locking in his Crippler Crossface to make Chavo tap out.

Match 3 Women's Champion Lita vs Mickie James

WINNER - and New Women's Champion Mickie James

Lita announced a week earlier that she would retire after this match like Trish Stratus, except she got the going away present she probably didn't expect. This was a great diva match filled with lots of action. At the end Mickie James kicks out of the moonsault and wins with a Tornando DDT. Funny ending with Cryme Tyme coming out and selling all of Lita's things. They even get JBL to buy something.

Match 4 Team DX( Triple H, Shawn Michaels, Jeff and Matt Hardy, and CM Punk) vs Team Rated RKO ( Edge, Randy Orton, Gregory Helms, Mike Knox, and Johnny Nitro)

WINNER - Team D-Xtreme (Flawless Victory)

This was the second time in 4 years the The Hardy Boyz faught as a tag team. If you like DX and Team Xtreme(The Hardy Boyz), then you will love this match. Started off hilarious with HBK giving the Sweet Chin Music to Mike Knox before the match really gets started and looks around all confused, and covers up for the pin. Then he has a funny moment with Melina who thought he was Johnny Nitro. CM Punk puts on awesome submission move on Nitro to defeat him and soon after team xtreme takes care of Gregory Helms via Twist of Fate + Swanton Bomb. Edge and Orton try to leave through the crowd but are brought back by the Hardyz only to get Pedigreed, and HBK delivers another Sweet Chin Music. Team DX wins by a landslide. Tha Hardy Boyz are Back!!!

Match 5 Mr. Kennedy vs. The Undertaker (First Blood Match)

WINNER - Mr. Kennedy

Taker dominates most of this match until MVP comes out and inadveritly hits Taker with a chair to bust him open. Taker losses, but nearly kills Mr. Kennedy. He nails him with a chair and of course gives him a Tombstone.

Match 6 Team Cena (John Cena, Bobby Lashley, Kane, Rob Van Dam, and Sabu) vs Team Big Show (Big Show, Umaga, MVP, Test, and Finlay)

WINNER - Team Cena

Umaga kicks off the match by getting disqualified for trying to hit everyone with a computer moniter. Little Bastard makes an appearence when Big Show and Kane are trying to choke slam each other. The big part of this match was Cena giving an FU to the Big Show. Wow. Cena and Lashley survive.

Match 7 World Heavyweight Champion and Ruler of the Smackdown Kingdom King Booker vs the Animal Batista

WINNER - and New World Heavyweight Champion Batista

This was a great match with plenty of action. Match ends with Queen Sharmell giving the belt to King Booker and distracting the ref to let Booker hit Batista with it. Batista had other plans though. He ducked out of the way and took the belt and nailed Booker with it to get the 1-2-3. Batista finally gets the belt back.

Well that wraps up another WWE Pay Per View. This was my first review, I hope this helped you. I give this pay per view a 10/10. Every match was fun to watch.",1164844800,,3642,4.381872213967311
2629192,4,B000H6SXWO,"Team Flair vs The Spirit Squard: Farooq and a spirit squard member get a double count out. Dusty eliminates another Spirit Squard member and gets rolled up by another one. Then Flair eliminates Kenny ""A member name I actually know"". Flair then wins by eliminating the last member with the figure four leg lock. 5 out of 10

  Chavo vs Beniot: Batista gets shot after shot at the title when Beniot is United States champion for the what, 8th time ? At least he wins this one though. He beats Chavo after kicking out of a weak frog splash and then snaps on the crossface after Chavo accidently collides with Vicky Guerrero. 7 out of 10

  Lita vs Mickie James: Lita expects a Trish Stratus goodbye here but doesn't get it at all. Mickie wins after a ddt. Lita asks the fans to cheer for her and they don't of course. Then Cryme Time comes out with her personal items and sells them to the fans. 6 out of 10

  The Hardys, C.M Punk and DX vs Edge, Orton, Gregory Helms, Mike Knox and Johny Nitro: This match makes all the faces look good and all the heels look totally weak. HBK hits Mike Knox with Sweet Chin Music pretty much as soon as the bell rings. HHH and HBK then ask each other, ""who's Mike Knox"". Well a nobody I guess because you guys won't even let younger guys look good next to you. C.M Punk makes Nitro submit, Matt pins Helms after both Hardys hit their moves. Orton and Edge then go to run away but get brought back to the ring. HBK pins Edge after Sweet Chin Music, then HHH pins Orton with the Pedigree. At least C.M Punk and the Hardys weren't made to look weak and then DX win by themselves like I expected to happen. But still nothing that special here. 7 out of 10

  Ken Kennedy vs Undertaker (First Blood): At least Taker actually puts over Kennedy here...but barely. I mean first off MVP goes to hit Kennedy with the chair but hits Taker on accident gets him to bleed. So it's basically MVP that does all the work. Then after the match Taker of course has one of his baby fits and has to beat up Kennedy and make bleed before leaving. 7 out of 10

  Team Cena vs Team Show: Cena on a Survivor Series is always predictable. I figured he'd only lose if the unstopple Kevin F. came out to cause him to get pinned. I mean Cena vs Britneys Ex is the dream match of the year. It's gonna be a true classic. I'm being sarcastic of course. Anyway nope he doesn't cause Cena to lose. Umaga gets DQed by hitting everyone with the tv monitor. He lays out Cena with it but of course Cena is up and ready to go like nothing happened only like a minute later. RVD then takes out MVP with the Frog Splash. Test takes out RVD with a quick big boot. Sabu then takes out Test. Big Show then hits the choke slam on Sabu. This leaves Finlay and Show against Lashley and Cena. Lashley pins Finlay after the spear. Cena then pins Show after the FU after he already showed he can FU Show how many times already ? Infact he already pinned him with it like 2 Survivor Series ago. So nothing surprising here. It would've been more surprising if Cena actually got pinned and let better wrestlers like RVD and Sabu shine. 7 out of 10

  Batista vs King Booker: Batista already had too many shots against Booker and none of their matches were special. Not because Booker can't go though.... Batista gets his last shot here so gee...is he gonna win. He at least shows here that he can do a shoulder block off the top rope. Booker goes to nail Batista with the belt but Batista gets a hold of it and hits Booker with it for the win. He gets his second reighn while Beniot who has more talent in his pinky still hasn't gotten one. He sadly probably won't ever get it again. 7 out of 10",1164499200,5,3675,4.210826210826211

Too bad the Spirit Squad were being just jerks & sore losers by beating up Ric Flair after the match was over. It's a shame that Chris Benoit had to deal with Chavo Guerrero who is being a total jerk but Benoit manage to retain the United States Championship. I like it when Mickie James defeated Lita in Lita's retirement match for the Women's Championship and make her look like a fool. The funny part was after the match when Cryme Time came out and sell all of Lita's belongings. DX, The Hardy Boys & CM Punk were victorious against Rated RKO, Gregory Helms, Johnny Nitro & Mike Knox in the second Traditional Survivor Series match and they did it in a clean sweep. It's a shame that Mr. Kennedy beat the Undertaker in a First Blood match after MVP interfere in the match and accidently hit the Undertaker with a steel chair. But that's okay because the Undertaker cleans Mr. Kennedy's clock after the match was over.

8137020,3,B000H6SXWO,"Survivor Series Elimination Match
Ric Flair, Dusty Rhodes, Sgt. Slaughter, & Ron Simmons Vs. The Spirit Squad - Nothing really going on in this match. Ron Simmons has a good showing for the brief amount of time he was in the match until his elimination. From there the match just drifted along until Flair came in with a disadavantage of 3 to 1. In the end, after using his dirty bag of tricks and the figure four leg lock, Flair overcame the 3 on 1 odds. Flair takes a beating after the match from the Spirit Squad, however, the Spirit Squad would only vanish the next night. 3/5

United States Championship
Chris Benoit Vs. Chavo Guererro - This was a very good title match and unlike Chavo's feud with Rey Mysterio, this match wasn't centered around the whole ""Eddie"" storyline. Benoit and Chavo both wrestled an aggressive type of bout and they delivered a very solid wrestling match. In the end after missing the flying headbutt and not able to lock in the Sharpshooter, Benoit made Chavo tap out to the Crippler Crossface to retain the U.S. Title. 4/5

WWE Women's Championship
Lita Vs. Mickie James - Lita was wrestling her last match here and just like her match with Trish from Unforgiven, this was a very good contest. Regardless of what the crowd were chanting and dispite what Jerry Lawler was saying on commentary, Lita wrestled one of her best matches. Too bad Lita's career was overshadowed or tainted by the whole Edge/Matt Hardy deal. Lita was one heck of a performer in the women's division and if it wasn't for Lita, Trish Startus most likely wouldn't have had the same career as she did.

Mickie and Lita put on a great performance and this was a great Women's Title match. Mickie gets the win over Lita with a hard DDT. After the match, Cryme Tyme comes out with a box of Lita's stuff and performs an auction with J.B.L. from Smackdown getting involved. 3.75/5

Survivor Series Elimination Match
Team DX (Triple H, Shawn Michaels, C.M. Punk, Matt & Jeff Hardy) Vs. Team Rated RKO (Edge, Randy Orton, Gregory Helms, Johnny Nitro, & Mike Knox) - Before the match got underway, DX had one of the most loudest pops throughout the entire night. One interesting part to notice is the pop C.M. Punk gets when DX is doing their thing. As for the match, this was much like all of DX's previous matches since their return. DX's team totally squashed Rated RKO's team with some comedy value that includes Mike Knox's 15 seconds in the match and HBK's pose with Melina. When it gets to 5 on 2, Edge and Orton tries to make a run for it but only to be captured by the Hardys and C.M. Punk to have DX finish them off. Quite frankly, I felt this was a lousy way for WWE to end Randy Orton's 3 - 0 Survivor Series streak. The match was okay but certainly could have been way better. 3.5/5

First Blood Match
Undertaker Vs. Mr. Kennedy - Like their match from No Mercy, the Undertaker and Kennedy delivered. Undertaker was dominating Kennedy for most of the match with Undertaker in the early stages of the match just destroying Mr. Kennedy all over the announce table. In the end, MVP comes out (payback on Mr. Kennedy) accidentally hits Undertaker with a steel chair causing Undertaker to bleed. After the match, Undertaker shows his animalistic side by destroying Mr. Kennedy even more and delivering one of the most hard hitting steel chair shots ever to Mr. Kennedy in Pro Wrestling history! Undertaker also delivers one destructive Tombstone Piledriver to Mr. Kennedy as well. Match of the night. 4.5/5

Survivor Series Elimination Match
Team Cena (John Cena, Bobby Lashley, Kane, Rob Van Dam, & Sabu) Vs. Team Big Show (Big Show, Test, Finlay, Umaga, & M.V.P.) - The best Survivor Series Elimination Match of the night. Umaga gets the early elimination after taking out Cena with a TV monitor and leaving Cena in a broken heap. Some of the eliminations were a little weak (Test & Kane). Lashley has a good showing and at one point hitting Test with a spear on the outside. Cena in the end hits the Big Show with a FU to become the sole survior along with Bobby Lashley. Overall, a fairly good match. 4/5

World Heavyweight Championship
Batista Vs. King Booker - This match only had one purpose to it, Batista winning back the World Heavyweight Title in the same place he surrendered it earlier in the year. I will say this match is better then their SummerSlam bout but basically Batista walked all over King Booker to the point where you hear some ""BOO'S"" from the crowd in the match. Batista becomes the new World Champion after hitting King Booker with the World Title belt. 3/5

Overall this will not be a bad purchase to add to your collection. The DVD also consists of Lita's farewell interview and the main event from Survivor Series 1987 as Hulk Hogan, Bam Bam Bigelow, Paul Orndorff, Ken Patera, & Don Muraco Vs.

WARNING - I will reveal spoilers, because I don't wish for anybody to endure this dump!

1) Survivor Series Elimination Match
The Spirit Squad v.
Dusty Rhodes, Arn Anderson, Sgt. Slaughter, Ron Simmons, & Ric Flair
---Can we be honest with ourselves for a moment?  How many of these 10 men could deliver quality matches back in November 2006?  I'd say three at most, and neither of them did anything good tonight.  Can't figure out which ""three"" I'm talking about?  Guess what, after this dreadful opener, I can't either.  The eliminations were as quick and weak as I've ever seen, including one where I don't know if Arn Anderson was counted out, disqualified, or just ejected from ringside.  This crowd-killing opener was an awful way to kick off the show!
""3.0 / 10""
_______________________________________________

2) United States Championship
Chavo Guerrero v. Chris Benoit (champion)
---Easily the best match on the card, but sadly not as great as it deserved to be.  Chavo and Benoit were doing excellent ringwork, and on the verge of creating a strong contest.  But they were cut short because of an 8-minute length.  If given more time, we could've witnessed a classic.  But the final product will disappoint fans of long technical displays.
""6.5 / 10""
_______________________________________________

3) Women's Championship
Lita (champion) v. Mickie James
---Fans hoping for an emotional ride that Trish Stratus' retirement delivered will be disappointed.  The Philadelphia fans are tough on Lita, right or wrong.  The chemistry between the two Divas is off, thus creating a poor contest.  And then Cryme Time comes out afterwards to auction off Lita's personal belongings, with some sexual jokes thrown in.  Could Amy Dumas (""Lita"") have picked a worse presentation to leave WWE on?  The PPV was on the brink of a boring meltdown, the match was a lackluster performance from both ladies, the aftermath was embarassing and painfully unfunny, and Lita's legacy is sadly tarnished by the Adam Copeland & Matt Hardy love triangle.
""4.5 / 10""

4) Survivor Series Elimination Match
Jeff Hardy (Intercontinental champion), Matt Hardy, CM Punk, Shawn Michaels, & Triple H v.
Johnny Nitro, Gregory Helms (Cruiserweight champion), Mike Knox,
Randy Orton (World Tag Team champion), & Edge (World Tag Team champion)
---Let's pause for a moment.  Look at all of that talent involved!  I've even taken the time to list which superstars were champions, and have typed in each wrestler's name (rather than just typing Tag Team combinations).  Doesn't this look like a masterpiece waiting to happen?  Before I trash this match, let me say that it's never boring, and the crowd was absolutely wild for it!  But can somebody tell me why Orton's team got squashed!?  Why would I want to see a marquee match develop into an 11-minute shutout!?  This makes no sense at all, and leaves a horrid taste in my mouth!  I'll be generous with the score, because I was entertained from start to finish, but my memory's starting to get its revenge!
""6.0 / 10""
_______________________________________________

5) First Blood Match
Mr. Kennedy v. The Undertaker
---As if their NO MERCY encounter wasn't bad enough, these two did even worse this time around.  I don't think I'm unreasonable when I expect Taker to be involved in something stellar when SURVIVOR SERIES rolls around, because it was his TV debut back in 1990.  Things actually started off okay, as Kennedy used his wits and cunning to survive the ordeal.  He quickly used sensible strategy and creative cheating to avoid losing.  But the grudge match was way too short, and the finish yet another anticlimax (quite the norm for the evening).  This First Blood Match was so poor that even Taker's postmatch beatdown was botched.
""5.0 / 10""
_______________________________________________

6) Survivor Series Elimination Match
Big Show (ECW World champion), Finlay, M.V.P., Test, & Umaga v.
Kane, Rob Van Dam, Sabu, Bobby Lashley, & John Cena (WWE champion)
---Well, what can I say?  This was another rushed Elimination-style match, with pinfalls coming so quick that WWE must've been daring fans not to blink their eyelids.  There were honestly 5 superstars gone in less than 3 minutes.  Friends, I'm not creative enough to make that factoid up!  I'll close by saying that this ""marquee match"" was a pointless mish-mash of tri-brand talent, in which every participant came out a loser in my eyes.
""4.5 / 10""
_______________________________________________

7) World Heavyweight Championship
King Booker (champion - Loses Title If Disqualified)
v. Batista (Last Chance At The Title)
---Just look at the descriptions of the wrestlers; now take a guess at who wins.  We fans are strong enough to swallow some predictable outcomes from time to time, but can any of these 5-star voters tell me how they were strong enough to endure this ungodly borefest of a main event?  I love Booker, and Batista's has become a wresler I enjoy watching.  When I watch these two work together, I feel like an idiot.  The main event is a slow, plodding affair.  The crowd barely made any reaction prior to the pinfall, and seemed unenthused by the victor's postmatch celebration.  You know what, never mind my criticisms...just listen to the Wachovia Centre's deafening silence!
""3.0 / 10""
_______________________________________________

This was 2006's absolute worst PPV!  That's right, I would rather watch the 2006 GREAT AMERICAN BASH, or ECW's DECEMBER TO DISMEMBER.  This was that bad.  Every single match was a weak display.  Let's recap, shall we?:

* We have an opener with old legends and teenage cheerleaaders.
* The best match of the night got reduced to 10 minutes, tops.
* Lita's last match was a failure on every level of creative composition.
* A star-studded 10-Man Elimination Match was a shocking wipeout.
* The ""bloodiest"" match of the night was predictable and not very bloody.
* Another 10-Man Match, led by two brands' champions, was empty physicality.
* The crowning of a new champion was only less impressive than David Arquette's WCW Title victory.

The bonus features include a Survivor Series Match from 1987 (which isn't too bad), Lita's bitter postmatch interview (which might've been in character), and the premiere episode of the ""Mr. [...]-Mahon"" online cartoon.  All in all, nothing special, which has been the WWE PPV DVD norm for the past few years.

I'd rather get kicked in my man-region than endure this crap again!  There is not one single redeeming quality on this PPV.  If you enjoy this PPV, then I'm happy for you.  But I don't give out 1-star reviews for the WWE often, and I hope I just saved somebody some money.",1214524800,2,7044,5.063368055555555
8137023,4,B000H6SXWO,"Ric Flair, Dusty Rhodes, Ron Simmons & Sgt. Slaugther VS Spirit Squad: I like nostalgia. Does WWE have any other legends besides Slaughter or Rhodes? IRS looked pretty good in a few apperances. Skip.

Chris Benoit VS Chavo Guerrero: Liked the storyline. Its weird to hear JBL and Cole appraise Benoit and say he took a few months off to heal injuries. Loved the ending, although it was a quick match. JBL going off the deep end after Chris knocked Vickie off the apron was stupid. RIP Benoit.

Lita VS Mickie James: Lita's last WWE match, thats all I have to say about that.

DX, Hardyz, & CM Punk VS Rated RKO, Gregory Helms, Nitro, & Mike Knox: Like the start of the match, very funny stuff. The match was short and I didn't really enjoy it. Entrances took way to long.

Undertaker VS Mr. Kennedy: Liked the feud but The Last Ride match was better. I love Kennedy's prematch promos. KENNEDY!!!!!!!! Hated the ending but I like the aftermath.

John Cena, Sabu, RVD, Lashley, & Kane VS Big Show, Finlay, MVP, Test, & Umaga: 14 minutes? Come on. Thats plain stupid. Umaga gets DQ'ed right away. A good match but way too short.

Booker VS Batista: I hate Booker, never really cared for this guy. These two had a real life fight backstage and they hate each other. Im glad Booker is in TNA; The match was decent, good to see Batista as world champion.

Hogan, Paul Orndorff, Bam Bam Bigelow, Don Muraco and Ken Patera VS Andre The Giant, One Man Gang, King Kong Bundy, Butch Reed, and Rick Rude: The first main event from the first Survivor Series. Excellent match but Cole and JBL suck at commentary on this match. They get off track way too much and really annoying at points.

The only reason to buy this dvd was for the first main event of Survivor Series. The rest of the dvd and its matches sucked. I cant wait till they release all the Survivor Series on dvd like Royal Rumble, WrestleMania, and Summerslam. The Survivor Series has not been worth watching since 1997.

8137025,2,B000H6SXWO,"Definitely not up to par with the great Survivor Series events of the past [Check Survivor Series 94, 2001, 2002, and 2003]. While i was very relieved to see that this Survivor Series had more Survivor Series matches on the card than any Survivor Series since 1999, These were some of the worst Survivor Series matches i've seen. Many of the matches were too short and had that rushed feel to them. Here's my opinion on the matches to this show:

1. Ric Flair, Dusty Rhodes, Ron Simmons, and Sgt. Slaughter Vs. The Spirit Squad
With already low expectations for this match, I watched this match and saw that my low expectations were rightly justified. The match was rather short, But Flair pretty much made this match watchable as everyone else turned in mediocre performances in this match. Flair's team won. **

2. For the WWE U.S. championship
Champion Chris Benoit [R.I.P.] Vs. Chavo Guerrero
In the wake of the now infamous events that involved Benoit and his family and destroyed all of Benoit's legacy, I now tend to look at his matches a whole lot differently today than what i used to view them. Just like many others, I was and still am very appalled to see that Benoit killed his wife [Who was known as Woman in WCW] and his little boy and then killed himself in their home. It goes to show that you can never guess what evil thoughts may be going on in a person's mind. But, now we have to seperate entertainment from life. Unlike many others, I will not allow the final 3 days of Benoit's life to make me overlook the 20-plus years of quality wrestling that he provided me and many other wrestling fans. This was not one of his memorable matches. Benoit and Chavo put in surprisingly unmemorable performances in this match and the match is mediocre just like the match before it. Benoit retains the title. **

3. For the WWE Women's title
Champion Lita Vs. Mickie James
In what appears to be Lita's final match, She defends the Women's title against Mickie James. Both of these girls actually know how to wrestle unlike almost all the other women in the WWE, But this match was a sheer dissapointment. The action was not very entertaining and by the time Mickie James won the match, I don't think many people cared. This forgettable match is partially redeemed by the hillarious antics that were pulled on Lita by Cryme Tyme after the match was over. Mickie James becomes the new Women's champion. **

4. First Blood Match
The Undertaker Vs. Mr. Kennedy
The best match of the entire night is right here! Although not as violent as one would think, This is actually not a bad match compared to a lot of the other matches on this show. Both men do pretty well in the ring and outside of the ring in this match and the weapons use is great too. The ending was very surprising. Mr. Kennedy won. ***1/2

5. Triple H, Shawn Michaels, The Hardy Boyz, and CM Punk Vs. Edge, Randy Orton, Gregory Helms, Mike Knox, and Johnny Nitro
Like the Survivor Series match earlier in the evening, This is not by any means a great Survivor Series match, But it is better than the first one of the night. Some good action throughout and it is nice to see Jeff Hardy back in the WWE reunited with his brother after his little TNA stint soured. This was a decent match. Team DX won. ***

6. John Cena, Rob Van Dam, Sabu, Bobby Lashley, and Kane Vs. The Big Show, Umaga, MVP, Finlay, And Test
This match was watchable to say the least. The match was surprisingly short [As was a couple of the Survivor Series matches on this show]. But, The match did feature some great action near the end. Cena's team won. **1/2

7. For the World Heavyweight Championship
Champion King Booker Vs. Batista
This was a very lackluster main event and is a sorry excuse for a way to end this show. Booker is a great wrestler, But Batista obviously still has a lot to learn when it comes to knowing how to wrestle. The 2 guys obviously don't click seeing how this particular series of matches these guys had against each other were all bad matches, Including this one. They both try their hardest to make this match worth watching, But they inevitably fail once again to have a good match against each other. This match simply sucked. Batista becomes the new World Champion. *1/2

Overall, This is one of the worst Survivor Series events in history. Boasting a dissapointing card and not having much of anything going on in the night really ruined this Survivor Series. All i can say is, I hope this year's Survivor Series is much better. The only thing on this dvd that was worth watching more than once is the classic Survivor Series main event from the very first Survivor Series back in 1987 which appears in its entirety as a special feature on this dvd. Skip this event and try to order Survivor Series 2003 instead.",1188172800,,4789,4.502876869965478
8137026,3,B000H6SXWO,"If only the main event wasn't a mash up of fairly good wrestlers putting on a fairly rotten match then this PPV could have been saved. As it was though King Booker and Batista filled the ring with missed spots and a general lack of enthusiasm that left me feeling as though I was watching Batista regress right before my very eyes. And this on top of the fact that Vince found it necessary to give away the ending by having it be Batista's ""Final Title Shot"" if he were to lose. The WWE would be well advised to drop bird brained stipulations like this that only fool the audience members who have never seen a wrestling show before. You have to admit though, poor Booker T, saddled with the apparently timeless king gimmick has run with it further and better than most people thought possible.

The rest of the show was decent, but Survivor Series is supposed to be one of their four major events of the year and coming off the spine-tingling SummerSlam this just felt disappointing. I also can't say I approve of filling the card with these ""traditional"" Survivor Series tag matches because all that represents to me is the land of easy pin falls. I mean we even get former WWE champion Sgt. Slaughter getting pinned with a dropkick. Geez, talk about how the mighty have fallen, it used to take a leg drop to keep this guy down. Watching WWE dust off a bunch of relics, stick them together, and call them a team of faces is a nifty shot of nostalgia, but it is also kind of lame. The Mr. Kennedy vs. Undertaker match was stinky mainly because they make a bad match for one another. Separately they just put on the two best matches at WrestleMania 23, but together they only work to accentuate their slowness. I did, admittedly, enjoy the nasty chair shot Kennedy took at the end of the match which served as a reminder that his main selling point is that he is one tough cookie.

So with a show that provided no show stealing matches and a main event that under whelmed I'm stuck telling you to avoid this show. The entire production just felt too whimsical and too stuck in the past. Ideas like the 5 on 5 matches should have been weeded out long ago since they appeal to a dumbed down wrestling fan who was much more prevalent 15 years ago before the internet. Then there is the issue of the announcers who I usually like but who just annoyed me to no end on this show. We have Jerry Lawler flat out lying to us by saying that this show included the first time a team was shut out in a Survivor Series match. But he prefaces his dishonesty with ""I think. . ."" which I guess means you should believe him if you don't know any better and forgive him if you do. Plus you have Jim Ross' endless fawning over Bobby Lashley which just seems silly now that he has become such a bust. The Cryme Tyme/Lita segment may have been my favorite part and it was certainly not the experimental part of the evening. Some rappers selling Lita's underwear to Republican extraordinaire JBL, what a gas. . .only it sort of was. Only the show itself sort of wasn't. It was sort of boring and sort of uneventful and sort of not worth your time. But only sort of. ***",1175904000,,3147,4.341256366723259

Ric Flair, Dusty Rhodes, Sgt. Slaughter, Ron Simmons w/Arn Anderson vs. Kenny, Johnny, Nicky, Mikey w/Mitch - This was what I think everyone thought it would be. Flair does a nice little baby face in peril thing and as par for the course with Flair, he pulls something semi-watchable even out of the worst of crap. Nothing really worth mentioning here other than the crowd popping for the old-timers a little bit. Cute. *1/2

United States Championship Match

Chris Benoit vs. Chavo Guerrero w/Vickie Guerrero - Incredibly flat performance for both, but especially Benoit. I've never understood the infatuation with Chavo, but he was pretty much there for a very average match from both of these guys. They really had an opportunity to push Chavo if that's what they wanted to do, but more or less had him come off looking out classed in an uncharacteristically flat performance from Benoit. **1/4

Women's Championship Match

Lita vs. Mickie James - Oh jeez, I don't know where to start. As good as Mickie can be at times, Lita is never a sure bet either way. She either blows your doors off or just works a terrible match. This was pretty awful. Lita again, is more or less squashed out in her last match. The thing afterwards was a bit sad in some ways but WWE being WWE, what else would you expect? *1/2

Survivor Series Elimination Match

Triple H & Shawn Michaels, Jeff Hardy, Matt Hardy & CM Punk and vs. Edge, Randy Orton, Johnny Nitro, Mike Knox & Gregory Helms - I saw this on paper and was really looking forward to seeing it. This was incredibly dissapointing. Like we saw for almost the entire five month run of DX, this was pretty much a squishy squash. There are some cute comedy moments here, but this really was nothing special on any level. **1/4

First Blood Match: Undertaker vs. Mr. Kennedy - Even though this was probably the weakest of their three pay per view encounters, it was still pretty solid stuff from both. Kennedy looking entirely unintimidated by the Dead Man and not being afraid to take it to him. Enjoyable match with a kind of screwy finish. Other than that though, an entirely fun match. **3/4

Survivor Series Elimination Match

John Cena, Kane, Lashley, Sabu & RVD vs. Big Show, Test, MVP, Finlay & Umaga - MUCH better than I expected it to be. Finlay & Umaga of course are just so much fun in this match. This isn't 'good' per sae, but man is it a lot of fun and was everything the last elimination match should have been and wasn't. Again, nothing great, but fun for what it was. **1/2

World Heavyweight Championship Match

King Booker vs. Batista - This was brutally bad. Booker either mixes well with guys or he doesn't. Booker and Batista don't mix. I was there live for their utterly putrid Summerslam match and this one was just as bad if not worse, just longer. Batista's chase for the gold finally ends and it's a shame. Had I been booking, i'd have considered keeping the belt on Booker. Batista's been somewhat of a heat vaccum lately. Regardless, neither of these guys really do anything worth noting until Batista, the baby face, cheats to win the match. Ay Jeez. Terrible stuff. *1/4

Overall-- I'm utterly shocked people liked this pay per view as much as they said they did. Everything for the most part was at least dissapointing save for the Team Cena-Team Big Show match, which although fun, wasn't very good. Even Benoit was pretty bad by his standards. This is a definite skipper and IMO, one of the worst shows of 2006.",1174003200,2,3518,4.618589743589744
