4587977,4,B0056EBHEI,"Clark Douglas, DVD Verdict --If you dug Aqua Teen Hunger Force, you'll be just as satisfied by Aqua Unit Patrol Squad 1.

As for the actual episodes included here: First up, you have the seven remaining unreleased episodes of Aqua Teen Hunger Force, though they are included on the disc labeled ""AUPS1 S1."" Meanwhile, the sparkly, brand-new Aqua Unit Patrol Squad 1 episodes are included on the disc labeled ""ATHF FV"" (the ""FV"" standing for Final Volume). I suppose this is meant to be a little joke about the fact that the two shows are basically indistinguishable. Or a printing error. Either way, insert Nelson-style ""haw-haw!"" here.

The actual tales included are the usual mix of brilliant absurdist comedy (I particularly love the story about the slovenly Carl actually being a spy who has been doing surveillance work on the gang for nine years), random oddities (Frylock attempting to bring Carl to Jesus by introducing Carl to Jesus' gay hairdresser?), and undercooked half-ideas (the silly, violent business with the triangles). The show isn't running on fumes or anything at this point, but even with its punchy new main title sequence, Aqua Teen H...uh, I mean Aqua Unit Patrol Squad 1 has fallen into a series of familiar rhythms. Its random violence feels less random, its absurdities more familiar and its unpredictable wildness more predictable. Still, hanging out with these characters (particularly when you're half-awake and have nothing better to do) remains a pleasure. My only complaint is that the fiercely intelligent Frylock is a bit too marginalized in this volume, as the show seems more interested in the louder antics of the impossible horrible Master Shake and the (admittedly hilarious) misadventures of the impossibly adorable Meatwad (seriously, never has a gunk-filled blob of bloody meat been so undeniably cute). Carl fans (of which there are many) will be pleased to note that the world's worst neighbor gets his fair share of appearances, too.

The show looks quite strong on DVD, offering bright colors, sharp detail (not that this incredibly cheap series needs it) and deep blacks. Audio is also sturdy, with the typically hip/strange blend of rock tunes and funky underscore making the biggest impression. Fans of the series will be disappointed to note that a new ""Terror Phone"" installment (the elegantly-titled ""Terror Phone 3"") is the only supplement included.

Aqua Unit Patrol Sqaud 1: Season One is another fun batch of weirdness with some of Adult Swim's best characters. The name change is little more than an amusing gag.

4587978,5,B0056EBHEI,"The name change and opening title change and minor changes in-show are almost entirely superficial; this is basically the same show as the last few years of Aqua Teen Hunger Force.  The format is definitely much different from early ATHF, but that's just how the show creators have gone with the stories.  And I still find it hilarious and love it.",1316044800,17,348,4.688524590163935
4587979,5,B0056EBHEI,"A lot was made of the Change in the name of the show, and many Die-Hard fans of the original series were not looking forward to the many changes planned (in theory) to one of their Pop-Icon shows.  The first change dealt with the Aqua Teen Hunger Force moving to Seattle, which was as far away from New Jersey, where they resided for the past 10 years.  Such a dramatic change in location left a bad taste in a lot of peoples mouths'.  Then the name change came about, and we started to see a pattern in the commercialization of Adult Swim.  If you count the number of ""new"" shows with Acronyms in the name, it is evident that originality and creator content is all but gone from Adult Swim.  Even their website has added ""Gold"" episodes which are only accessible if you are subscribed to certain cable or Internet providers, proving the best has come and gone.  As for the AUPS, season 1, it may have tried to change, but maybe we were heard, and ideas were scrapped before they completely ruined the show.  I don't see too much change from the original series, after a terrible beginning with the 2-part opener.  Things got progressively better, and with one of the best shows of the series coming at the end with the espionage-type chase scenes and vehicle changes, it is hard to tell what is going to happen if there is a Season 2.  I still prefer the Hunger Force, but I guess I would purchase this simply becuase the voice acting is good, and Carl is still involved.",1316044800,12,1472,4.4222222222222225

I took UNRELEASED to mean UNAIRED- as in 7 never before seen anywhere episodes.  Turns out it meant, unreleased on DVD.  But enjoyable for all that.  I loved the ending theme to terror phone.

4587988,5,B0056EBHEI,"The one thing I have come to loathe in Williams Street is the way they market their DVDs.  I have been buying from these people since SUNCOAST was still in business.  Do any of you remember SUNCOAST??  It used to be the only place in America to go to get Anime without being laughed at constantly.

Aqua Teen. . .Whatever the Heck they are now. . .was the primetime show about seemingly nothing.  As they rounded home base toward their 100th episode and longest running show on Adult Swim, I think that Dave and Matt really just didn't care anymore. They have so many projects, it was like they just wanted to see how far Adult Swim would let them take Aqua Teens until they got cancelled.

Praise be to Mike Lazzo, then, because these boys are bumpin' them out and they are still on the air.

The show definitely pushes the boundaries in many ways, and the fact that you can ONLY get the LAST volume of ATHF in this DVD set with the first season of ATUPS is one of them.  I begrudgingly forgave them for the incident with DVD SEASON 4 when you selected PLAY ALL and simultaneously 10 episodes began on your screen.  Real funny, guys. This DVD comes with, like, SEVEN episodes each. . .and hardly any special features.

Seasons TWO and THREE were excellent Williams Street. WHAT HAPPENED?",1426723200,,1288,4.465811965811966

4587993,5,B0056EBHEI,"This is a flagship adult swim show (whether it be called Aqua Teen Hunger Force, AT Unit Patrol Squad 1, or Aqua something whatever, etc). It is very funny. For those familiar with adult swim (on Cartoon Network) congratulations on your good taste. To the uninitiated prepare for non-sequitur irreverence and some adult humor. It is best not to over-think these things, just enjoy it.

For parents, I suggest watching it before you show your kids to gauge for yourselves its appropriateness. The earlier seasons (called Aqua Teen Hunger Force) you will likely find more young child friendly. But again, the impetus is on you, the gatekeeper.",1381622400,,641,4.990654205607477

4588002,5,B0056EBHEI,I really liked this show. I will admit at times this show has weird moments but it is so funny. I am kind of sad they decided to stop after 100 episodes. The writers ran out ideas probably.,1366070400,,189,4.0
4588003,5,B0056EBHEI,"I originally got into this series way back in the day after seeing a crunchy fat chick in a bar with the three main characters tattooed on the upper portion of her arm in full color.  I recognized the characters on her arm (had dabbled in the series before), but never really paid much attention to the TV series.  Once I saw that chick's arm though, I said to myself, if someone is willing to permanently stencil the three main characters on their arm, then this is a series worth checking out.  So, I investigated the series in more depth thereafter and found myself being hooked.

That being said, Aqua Teens and South Park have proven to be the benchmarks for long term standards for adult animated entertainment that still legitimately stand the test of time (I have seen every episode of both series).  Both series have proven that they can always still not just survive, but thrive.

With Aqua Teens, the creators continue to successfully invent new hilarious and creative story lines that do not deviate persona wise from who the characters really are.  The only real difference in the main characters is that Shake has become more hornier over the years which makes his character even more funny.  The only downside to the series in my opinion has been the virtual disappearance of the sidebar voyeur characters ""Emory and Oglethorpe"" from active roles (the absurdly idiotic Arnold like sounding character and the one that sort of seems to try and keep him in check were one of the funniest odd couple type relationships in modern TV series (animated or not).  Fortunately, Ignignort and Err, the Mooninites, are still around).

I do not know why Emory and Oglethorpe have been absent for many years now (can't recall who does their voices), but for whatever reason, they need to be re-integrated back into the series because their roles have been gut buster comedy for the fans of the series.

Here's a vote for bringing back Emory and Oglethorpe back to active roles in the series!!!",1365206400,,1994,4.750724637681159
4588004,3,B0056EBHEI,"Wasn't what I expected it to be. The team at [adult swim] simply compiled what was supposed to be the last season with what I thought was going to be the ""new"" season. As it turned out, it wasn't the new season at all.

4588005,3,B0056EBHEI,It's not ATHF but close. Still pretty funny but I didn't think as funny as the original. I don't think I'm going to purchase  anymore but is watch them if they were in prime,1358899200,,173,4.088235294117647
4588006,2,B0056EBHEI,"Look - I f***ing love this show. I have been watching it since it first aired. But I have to be honest - this was not a good season (ok, there were a FEW scenes). It was very dry in humor...too dry. Sometimes to the point where you are actually bored watching it. That made me sad, because as I said - I love the show. It was a present for my friend, and we watched it together. He is a huge fan too. We were both disappointed. If you are a collector, then go ahead and buy it.

4588009,4,B0056EBHEI,"The only reason this gets 4 stars instead of 5 is the lack of extra features besides terror phone 3. If you're a fan you'll like it. Lasagna, Intervention, jumpy george and vampirus are my favorite episodes. I'd like to see more of the mooninites in the future as well as mc pee pants and some of the older characters make it back to the show again.",1353888000,,349,4.223880597014926

4588011,5,B0056EBHEI,"So by now, season 8, the show has completely jumped the shark, but who cares!? Nobody watches Aqua Teens for the realism.  This show is the ultimate take on surrealism, so why not go completely over the top with the absurdity? They did just that, and I'm glad they did! Name change or not, I will always watch this show. I hope it stays on another 12 years!",1347148800,,357,4.25

4588013,3,B0056EBHEI,"Aqua Unit Patrol Squad 1 is season 8 of Aqua Teen Hunger Force. Not a new show, just a new name. Yeah, it's set in Seattle, but the setting is exactly the same. Hilarious! I've been a huge fan of this show since about 2003, and have followed it heavily throughout its run, and sure, this new season isn't going to gain any fans, in fact, it has already lost some longtime ones, but only because of the daring title change. Also, don't let the ""SEASON 1"" fool you on here, it's going to be Aqua Something You Know Whatever next season! Disc one has all of the AUPS1 episodes, and disc two rounds out the remainding ATHF episodes not yet released on DVD. No, Amazon didn't screw up, this is disc two. Since no one has done so yet, I will post the episodes and special features.

SUPPLEMENTS:
T3rror Phone: Redialed

Now, the batch of episodes range from superb to okay. Best being ""Intervention"", worst being ""Larry Miller Hair System"". There are seventeen episodes overall, and I do believe it is the most an ATHF/AUPS1 DVD has ever gotten. Much better than that one disc volume seven we got last time, though it did have more special features. Sadly, this is the first ATHF/AUPS1 DVD that has...virtually no special features. There is one, T3rror Phone, but it has nothing to do with ATHF/AUPS1, other than being on two other past DVD's. So, overall, it is a good watch. The episodes can get stale on repeat viewings, and there is only one, boring special feature. A solid 3/5.",1337990400,13,1894,4.402857142857143

I love this show even more because now it's based in Seattle (my hometown) and it adds a nice element to the show. They find great ways to randomly work it into the plot (like Master Shake trying to pick up babes at the local park...in the rain. Welcome to Seattle).

Simply put, if you like ATHF, get this season to add to your collection.",1329177600,,466,4.284090909090909

4588017,4,B0056EBHEI,"First, for anyone confused, this is just Aqua Teen Hunger Force with a new title and opening credits.
Why change the title and opening after 8 years on the air? (And occasionally claim the show is
now set in Seattle?)  In the anarchic spirit of the show, why not?

While not up to the best of the early seasons, with only a couple of 'classic' episodes among of the 17
on the two discs, this still has plenty of surreally, sometimes stupidly funny moments.

Sophomoric, gross at times, sure.  But that doesn't mean it can't also be very funny, and inventively weird.

Glad to see they returned to a two disc format, after the skimpy single disc 'best of' that was the last
collection.  However, there's still only 1 extra, compared to the usually copious extras
in the early years of the series.",1327536000,4,795,4.524475524475524
4588018,4,B0056EBHEI,"I have been a die hard Aqua Teen fan since the day I picked up the Volume 2 DVD back in July 2004. That being said, I thoroughly enjoyed these latest episodes, included in this volume, and think that anyone who has seen the show will enjoy them too.

As far as the extremely arbitrary format-change goes, do not fear, as it makes no significant change to the content of the show. The change itself is only briefly mentioned in the beginning of the first AUPS episode and then never addressed again, and the show is back to its old self before you know it. I can not fathom why the creators would have even pulled such a move, aside from it being a pure word-of-mouth marketing move. But based on the attitudes of Dave Willis and Matt Maiellaro, as glimpsed in the many previous behind the scenes extras and when I met Dave during their live event in NYC, I can guess it was done simply ""for the lulz"".

The one downside to this DVD product is the lack of special features. The special features section itself is misleading in that there is only ONE special feature. This one feature, the third installment in the Terror Phone short series, is absolutely hilarious and solid, but it is severely disappointing that it is the only included feature. Since volume 2, the Aqua teen DVDs have always had loads of enjoyable extra and hidden features, but this volume sadly breaks the pattern.

One more small note of praise to this DVD is that the various menu screen music is hilarious and enjoyable, as one would come to expect from an Aqua Teen DVD.",1325721600,,1544,4.468085106382978
