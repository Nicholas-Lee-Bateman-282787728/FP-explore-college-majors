The story examines good vs evil while developing moral awareness in young Tetsuro, the hero of the story.  Many moral ideas are explored in the midst of a fast paced story.
Many  Japanese movies have a focus which is somewhat disturbing to Western  Audiences. This story is a fun movie for western and eastern audiences  alike.",914716800,,444,4.653846153846154

It is the story of a boy trying to find his mothers killers in a world filled with people giving up their humanity to become robots.  He is found by Maytel a mysterious woman, and together they board the Galaxy Express 999 to find the killers. The 999 is a starship in the form of a classic train, it stops at different planets, onto its ultimate destination, the Mecha homeworld.  Each stop is filled with adventure as the boy befriends many different people.  I highly recommend this old Anime classic to anyone.  Fun and enjoyable!  END",901929600,,608,4.532110091743119

There has been some debate as to the image quality on this release but for me the quality was more than acceptable as was the sound.  While the concept here is not really original, the story development is very satisfactory.  Some of the visuals of 999 moving through the galaxies are  stunning.

802809,5,630418431X,"This movie (along with the follow-up Adieu Galaxy Express 999) is the most awesome project to happen to the anime genre since its release in 1979. Tetsuro Hoshino, an orphan in the streets of Megalopolis since his mother's murder, wants to obtain a machine body for the purpose of revenge, namely to kill Count Mecha, the sadistic assassin responsible. He and his friends rise up from the lower part of the city, which the elitist society has contempt for, to steal a pass for The Galaxy Express 999, a train which travels through the depths of time and space itself, to reach the planet Andromeda, where he hopes to get what he needs for his mission. The plan goes askew with the police pursuing him, until a mysterious woman named Maetel intervenes and rescues him. They board the train later to start the perilous journey. However, Tetsuro slowly realizes that nothing is as simple as it seems. Maetel is keeping several deadly secrets from him, which could kill him. He unwittingly gets some help from outlaw Captain Harlock and his crew to wage war on Andromeda after Tetsuro finds out the truth and takes it out on Maetel. The first part of his mission ends when he kills Count Mecha, but now faces a bigger battle with human lives at stake! Maetel uses her secret against her own mother, who started Andromeda and The Machine Empire, which is brought to collapse. Tetsuro does fall in love with Maetel and saves her life. Her other secret involving her physical appearance is also revealed as they flee the destruction. In my own words, this movie is awesome and will keep you riveted. Even the best anime fan(s) will tell you! If you think this movie is awesome, try the soundtrack CD. It is unlike any soundtrack you have ever heard before (also available from Nippon/Columbia music)! (Toei Animation/Discotek)",1403654400,4,1819,4.7594936708860756
802810,5,630418431X,"I first saw this series as a kid and could never forget it due to the beautiful art and thought provoking story.  Even though I was young, the thought that eternal life made humans lose their humanity and having a limited life meant great sadness but also gave great value to every moment was a revelation.  I still consider the story original and groundbreaking even after so many years of reading SciFi and Fantasy books.
The train journey moving the characters and the story through gritty but glowing imagery was great then, and is still great, even now.
Many years later, after I had a chance to read and watch other Galaxy Express series, I found that unlike this Tetsuo as a handsome boy, the character is often drawn, basically, as a hideous blob with teeth.  So enjoy this rare treat.
Highly recommended.",1401235200,,813,4.671328671328672
802811,5,630418431X,"I remember when this was played on HBO when I was in high school and it stuck with me. The music was moving,the story mature and the characters stood out. The moral tale about when life is limited we cherish values and love should rear its head. Although it is a Japanese movie,it is in English or subtitles if desired. I really enjoy this movie and the ending when they destroy the planet Maytell,he says goodbye to Captain Harlock (Warlock in American version I saw as teen) and Emeraldas, touches me always. It is not a kddie cartoon for Joey the hero ,gets the crap beat out of him by adults, a machine woman reveals her womanly assets to Joey.

802952,3,630418431X,"I remember when I was a kid and just so happened to see this movie on the Sci-Fi Channel late one summer night.  I had loved the story and some of the truly interesting sci-fi elements that were introduced, so when I saw that it was on dvd, I was eager to buy it and relive that initial viewing experience.  Sadly, while the film is still brilliant at times, it ultimately doesn't live up to the caliber that I remembered it being 10-12 years ago.  Most notably, I feel that the quick pacing of the film ultimately hinders the development of the main characters and results in scenes ending right after they start getting really good.  Overall, Galaxy Express 999 is still a solid pick if you're looking to see an interesting anime, but just don't expect greatness throughout.",1385424000,2,776,4.561151079136691

802954,5,630418431X,"I've always loved Galaxy Express 999 since I first saw it on the Sci-fi Channel over a decade ago. It, more than any other science fiction I've experienced, so completely captured the wonder of space travel. This is due in part to the whimsical, exaggerated character designs of creator Leiji Matsumoto. Characters run the gamut from beautiful, sorrowful women (such as Shadow and Claire) to comically deformed men (like Tochiro). The most compelling of 999's cast (namely Maetel, along with space pirates Harlock and Emereldas) were so popular they got their own prequels and spin-offs. Furthermore, the haunting musical score and somber narrator give emotional and nostalgic weight to one boy's journey to become a man. And along the way, we must ask ourselves if it's truly worth becoming an android to live forever, or if, perhaps, human life has more meaning than we think.",1369353600,,878,5.062068965517241
802955,5,630418431X,"This isn't the type of film I would watch with friends, because it's not flashy nor 'cool'. This is the kind that's the best watched alone in the dark, something that you still think of occasionally. It's the kind that takes you to a different world and makes you think, especially if you're an impressionable kid.
GE 999 has a retro type of beauty n soul that modern films have left behind. The music in all Matsumoto films are godsend. It has a mature theme (like death) but good for kids. Don't under estimate kids. I remembered watching this as a 3 year old and kept searching for it for over a decade. If a 3 year old can remember this and kept searching forever for it then doesn't it say a lot about this movie. I am glad I found it again.",1367712000,2,746,4.223776223776224
802956,5,630418431X,"Galaxy Express 999 is a must have for fans of the series and even for newcomers. This is my favorite of the 3 GE999 movies.

The movie itself is great. It manages to get the basic gist of the 113 episode TV show, but it doesn't feel rushed. I like that they made Tetsuro's revenge of Count Mecha a more relevant part of the overall story. I really like how Tetsuro was able to have a confrontation with Count Mecha in which he kills him, but realizes that he values limited human life more than getting a mechanical body. This gives Tetsuro great character development because around this time he also admits to falling in love with Maetel. He is now a strong willed but also hopeful young man, which fits his name, Tetsuro Hoshino. This isn't even the climax though because Tetsuro and Maetel then go to the home world of the mechanized empire to destroy the planet. As with most of Matsumoto's works, this film has a moral message and also romance between Tetsuro and Maetel.

One of the best aspect about this DVD is the English dub. It is one of the best English dubs that I have seen. The voice cast is chosen well because the voice actors suit their characters well and do a good job. I actually like the English voices for Count Mecha and Promethium better than the Japanese voices because they really sound intimidating and powerful, which is appropriate because they are the 2 main villains. This dub also does a good job at pronouncing the Japanese names, which is something that I am picky about because I am half Japanese. The only complaint about the dub that I have is that the main characters and narrator pronounce the 999 as three-nine, which is correct, but Emeraldas and a background voice or two says nine-nine-nine, which is incorrect. Overall, even though I usually prefer to watch animes in Japanese with subs, the English version is very well done and faithful to the original, so watching it does not take away anything from the Japanese version.

As for the DVD, it is basic, but well done. The audio and video are good, but there isn't much in terms of special features. This isn't really a problem though. In conclusion, this DVD will treat you to an excellent, classic anime, which you will certainly love if you are familiar with other works by Leiji Matsumoto. You have the option to watch it in the original Japanese version with subtitles, or a very faithful and well done English dub. This is a must have for GE999 fans or a great stepping stone for people who are just starting to discover the wonderful world of anime.",1362873600,4,2554,4.547826086956522
802957,5,630418431X,"This is a great example of speculative science fiction with interesting characters and a compelling story.  I watched this on HBO when I was a kid and I think it is why I became a fan of anime.  It is just as good 30 years later, however the soundtrack did not hold up as well.  The movie would be slightly better if they had used a more traditional classical based score instead of all the funky 1970's music.  I wanted to edit the movie's audio and add better music.  Even though it is a train in space which seems silly at first,  they have a great explanation that makes it believable.  This movie is a condensed version of the TV series in which the train makes many more stops.  I have not seen the whole series,  although it was available online.  There is a second movie the continues the story but I have not seen it yet.",1357430400,,830,4.229299363057325
802958,5,630418431X,"This one of the first animes I ever got to see back when the SyFy channel was still SciFi.  I loved it back and I still love it now.  It kills me that they didn't remaster this and clean it up a little but it's still a great flick.  I got nothing really bad to say about the dub and the film itself is just an all around great story.  I'm glad this finally made it to amazon and I'm so happy to finally own this movie.  It's one of Leiji Matsumoto's best (in my opinion) films.

Inspiring story.  Great dialogue.  Nice amounts of action and lazer blasting.  The whole film is just fun to watch.  If you're an anime fan then it's my firm belief you'll enjoy this.  Con: I have only one issue...there is a little bit of an Oedipus complex present in the movie and it weirds me out just a little.  It's still a great film though.  Thank you Eastern Star for releasing this and the sequel to DVD.

Check out the description because it's pretty thorough as far as what the DVD contains.  BUY IT! You'll enjoy it and if you don't than you can kick in the balls.",1345766400,,1055,4.102941176470588

802960,5,630418431X,"I absolutely love this movie. I recorded it off television on a Scifi channel anime weekend (When they used to do that). Its a great movie and I am glad to have the dvd now. I was overjoyed to see the stuff that the television cut out (Harlock's speech, and the musical parts). The movie came faster then expected in the mail and I was overjoyed.",1332374400,2,346,4.257575757575758
803044,5,630418431X,"It's nice to see that some production companies out there are still releasing older titles (such as this one) on DVD. There are so many older anime titles that I personally think are great either due to a phenomenal storyline or a really interesting animation style that have just become kind of lost to time. So it was a great relief to finally see Galaxy Express 999 released on DVD.

Now while I will admit that most of Leiji Matsumoto's stuff all looks alike (it does), sometimes you just have to go with what works for you and his stylization definitely works for him.

Galaxy Express 999 is the story of a young man looking for revenge against a certain individual responsible for killing his mother. Believing that a machine body will help him attain his goal, he ends up boarding the intergalactic train called the Galaxy Express and encounters the conductor (a really quirky, but likeable fellow) and a mysterious, yet sad looking woman. As they travel through space on their respective destinations together, the young man learns more about the mysterious woman as well as about himself. He encounters many different people/machine people and listens to their stories and as the film progresses, his character grows.

Now while the film might be a little outdated by most modern standards, it is still a worthwhile piece of film and any anime fan should really sit down and watch it. Eastern Star (the company who released the film on DVD) did a great job keeping the original film in tact and updating it a bit (through editing and colorization) for modern televisions. It should also be noted that this is another anime in which the English really isn't that grating. You might benefit more from watching it in its original Japanese as some things get lost in translation, but honestly, the dub is not that bad.

In any event, this is definitely one of the 'old-school' titles that I think modern anime fans should really invest the time in watching.",1330905600,2,1962,4.761764705882353
803045,5,630418431X,A must not only for Japanese anime fans but fans of feature animation generally.

803046,5,630418431X,"I have owned a VHS version of this classic anime for quite awhile, hoping that one day it would appear on DVD. But as the years stretched on and on and on, my hope slowly faded.

Now, that hope has been rekindled and fulfilled with this classic being released on DVD.

I first caught wind of it from the Previews catalog that I get from my local comic shop and thought that was the only source for it. But I decided to give Amazon.com a go and lo & behold there it was. Along with Adieu Galaxy Express 999, so I bought them both.

I won't get into the story as other reviewers already have, but it is a good one and works well with the characters and the art.

Since the first time I saw this great film, I had hoped to see it one day in a clear, vibrant, crisp format and here it is! The images are sharp and high quality and the color is rich and jumps off the screen. What a great release I can't recommend this enough to any fan of this film. They have the option of Japanese with English sub but (I know I'm not supposed to say this) I prefer the English dub, Tetsuro's English speaking voice fits him perfectly and Maetel, well to me her voice will always be the English dub version. There are not a ton of extras, all the standard stuff: language options, chapter selection, some stills but the quality of this re-mastered film overshadows any of that; it truly blew me away, in fact I felt like I was actually watching it for the first time - the way it was meant to look. You will not be disappointed, it is a classic, buy it!",1310688000,2,961,4.228260869565218
803049,5,630418431X,"True imagination in film is rare, and especially so in science fiction film.  Sometimes this is due to the limitations of the movie makers - it can be difficult to show strange creatures or alien planets on a shoestring budget.  Animated sci-fi fares a little better, because animation has no such excuse - oh sure a lower budget can mean a lower framerate, but anything an artist can visualize in their head should be able to make its way onto a film cel.  The Japanese are the masters of animated science fiction, but all too often animated SF in Japan means nothing but fanservice and/or giant robots (not that there is anything wrong in principle with either of these - see ""Gunbuster."")  Rarely is there something truly different that can amaze you with its sheer creativity.  ""Galaxy Express 999"" is one of those things.  Not only is it one of the greatest animated science fiction movies from Japan, it is one of the greatest sci-fi movies of the 1970s period.

It's about Tetsuro Hoshino, a boy who desperately wants a ticket for the eponymous train (well, a space ship that's shaped like a train, anyway) so that he can go to the planet at the end of the line in a distant galaxy and obtain a machine body.  He wants this so he can exact revenge on the evil Count Mecha (a machine-man himself) who killed his mother in cold blood some years prior.  A ticket onboard and a traveling companion both come in the form of Maetel, a mysterious blonde traveler who secures Tetsuro a place on the 999 in exchange for his company.  Together the two will journey the galaxy, see many wonders and learn the significance of being human.

This movie is something very special, and can be viewed on many levels.  I won't go into too much academic-level analysis here (not really the place for it) but I will say that this gem has just about everything:  love, hate, vengeance, friendship, sublime beauty and the limitless wonder of the universe.  You really do feel that you are traveling through the cosmos with Tetsuro and Maetel, and can also feel the progression of Tetsuro from a single-minded child to a more rounded adult.  ""Galaxy Express 999"" does get sentimental (hey, it's a Leiji Matsumoto story) but never gooey and the emotions are genuine.  In addition this is a film has something for both youngsters and adults and can be enjoyed by both as a genuine family film (i.e. not just a kiddie movie with adult references thrown in) - although young children may not want to watch it based on the level of violence and some disturbing scenes (the scene where Tetsuro finds out just exactly *what* Count Mecha has done to his mother's body, for example).  The film is well-directed (by Rintaro of ""Metropolis"" fame) and well animated, and even though it was made in the 1970s it manages to not date itself that badly... this film is truly timeless.  And of course GE999 is filled to the brim with truly imaginative imagery, not the least of which is the main image of a railroad train making its way through space.  Other wondrous and awesome sights and moments await you should you decide to see this fantastic film, but I won't spoil them...  although I will say that Captain Harlock makes an appearance (along with Queen Emereldas to boot).  Yes, the biggest badass in all of anime turns up, and he commands every scene he is in.  Naturally.

This animated marvel is finally available on DVD in North America after years of fans watching fansubs, bad bootlegs and unsubtitled Japanese Region 2 discs.  Thank you, thank you Discotek for releasing this - it has been too long.

The video on this disc is very, very good, especially for an anime film from 1979.  Colors are bright but not lurid and really serve the fantastic imagery very well.  The image is bright but not too much so, and black levels are good.  The film is presented in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1:66:1. This was the standard aspect ratio for a Toei anime movie in the seventies.  Toei was - and is - sort of the Disney studio of Japan and could afford to make movies in widescreen.  Studios with smaller budgets usually did their movies at the standard 4:3 ratio, an exception being Hayao Miyazaki, (who made his first movie ""Castle of Cagliostro"" in widescreen the same year as GE999) who used to work for Toei.

Audio is good and clear.  Discotek provides both the original Japanese dub and the 1990s Viz English dub.  The English dub is okay... the casting is alright although the dialogue can be a little stilted, and some of the lines are very different from the subbed Japanese version.  Still, a decent alternative for those who don't want to read subtitles.  And you get to hear the two GODIEGO songs in full English (seeing as how some of the band members are American)!  So that's pretty cool.

There aren't too many extras, but then again there don't have to be - the movie is enough for me.  There are two original theatrical trailers, one each for both Galaxy Express films released by Discotek (this one and ""Adieu Galaxy Express 999"").  There is also an image gallery, which consists of stills from the movie as well as a nice cast shot (which also shows up on the back cover).  The packaging is decent and is NOT a cheap, flimsy ""eco-friendly"" DVD case - this one is actually somewhat sturdy.  Thanks, Discotek!

Summation:

+ Just about everything: the story, the characters, the music, the imagery....

- Some very minor plot holes, the animation though very nice *is* from the 1970s which may deter some (but not me).

Conclusion:  This is a science fiction classic.  If you like sci-fi, get this.  If you like Japanese animation, get this.  If you like animation in general, get this.  Even if you just like a good story or seeing fantastic things put on your screen, get this.  This is a classic film, and if you like classic films, get this.",1309392000,19,5852,4.611218568665377
803050,5,630418431X,"I never heard about Galaxy Express 999 until the VIZ Video release on VHS in 1996 (I missed the Roger Corman & Harmony Gold releases in the early 1980s, thankfully). The DVD format came out a few years later, and I was hoping this title would be re-released on DVD sooner or later... Well later happens to be 2011.

Unlike the Space Battleship Yamato film, this is not a compilation of the TV series that preceded it. This film was made of entirely new footage with a slightly different storyline. It was the highest-quality animated film produced in Japan at the time (1979). The story and animation quality still stand up well, even today.

What you get with this DVD:
* The film, in a much better quality than the old VHS tapes. The colors are quite sharp
* The old 1996 dub from VIZ is used
* The Japanese audio with sub-titles
* Theatrical trailers for Galaxy Express 999 and Adieu Galaxy Express 999
* An image gallery with several still images from the film.

It doesn't have the interviews and making-of features that you would expect from a recent Hollywood release. The film was made in 1979 ya know! I'm just glad to have a clean DVD release with a dub and subtitles.",1309046400,18,1178,4.469767441860465

Boy was I wrong! Galaxy Express was exhilarating. It was exciting, sad, shocking. It was very emotionally moving. How brave that little boy was.

This movie is no different, though I felt this movie was a bit rushed, and the plotline isn't too original. It is an original story, but with many of the elements of the original movie remixed to create a second voyage for Tetsuro, Maetal, and the 999. Very few surprises here.",1135641600,,482,4.682352941176471
803207,5,630418431X,"When I watch an anime, I usually expect to be entertained, nothing more.  What I found in Galaxy Express 999 was a good anime that remained with me after I saw it.  It had a captivating story, characters I could connect with, and some serious ideas that made me think.  But, it did have some flaws.

Galaxy Express 999 has a captivating story because I wanted Tetsuro, the main character, to find his mother's murderer and avenge her.  I was also wondering where Maetel came from and why she was helping Tetsuro.  Both of these issues kept me wanting to continue watching the film to see how they were resolved.

Secondly, Galaxy Express 999 also has characters who I could empathise with.  For example, at the beginning of the film, Tetsuro is introduced as a young boy who is by himself in an apathetic and materialistic Earth.  Mechanized people seem to regard pure humans as low-class and expendable.  Tetsuro, a fully human orphan, struggles to survive in this Sinclair-esque ""jungle"".  From experience living in a large city in the U.S., I drew a parallel between Tetsuro and the many unskilled immigrants who come each year to the U.S. to make a living.

Thirdly Galaxy Express 999 slipped in a serious message.  Even in a world full of materialism and prejudice where it's ""survival of the fittest"", it is still possible for humans/robots to show compassion for other humans/robots.  Maetel, who is a tall attractive blonde from an aristocratic mechanoid family, nevertheless transcends class difference when she shows Tetsuro warmth and affection.  In another instance, Claire, the robot waitress aboard 999, also transcends ""racial"" difference when she too shows affection for Tetsuro, a human boy.

Fourthly, there were flaws in this story and I'll just mention some.  There are events which don't flow well with the story.  For example, how does Antares manage to show up at the Time Castle right at the moment when Tetsuro is about to be shot by Count Mecha?  How did Antares find out about where the Time Castle was?  Another flaw was scientific.  When Tetsuro fires his pistol at Queen Emeralda's ship from the 999, the laser makes a hole in the window.  Wouldn't the vacuum of space suck all the air out of the train?

In conclusion, although this story has numerous shortcomings, those flaws were more than compensated for by the story's dynamic, the well-developed principal characters and the subtle messages about our human condition.",1101686400,3,2454,4.902912621359223

This one is one of the best anime that you can find out there,buy it or rent it.question,does the 999 has something to do with the demonic sign 666???",992217600,,360,4.231884057971015
803349,2,630418431X,"This is one of the most difficult series to review -- mainly since you  really need to have some background into Matsumoto's vast universe to fully  appreciate the specific segment this movie portrays. The first-time viewer  will immediately recognise the fact that several key pieces of information  seem to be missing -- as if someone delivers a punchline without actually  telling the joke. Those of you who have read Matsumoto's manga, or are  familiar with his universe will find that GE 999 fills in a lot of  details...
But even the most ardent Harlock fan will have a very tough  time trying to resolve certain aspects of this story -- for starters, just  how many co-incidences does it take to make a story completely  unbelievable? As with many anime programs from this era, Galaxy Express  suffers from some lousy action choreography. Once again, we see chase  scenes involving our hero, in which police officers inexplicably stand  around long enough for him to run away. And once again, these same police  officers couldn't hit the proverbial 'broad side of a barn' with their  guns. So when you add to this the incredible string of luck which sets  Tetsuro with Tochiro's mother, who provides our young warrior with a gun,  cape and hat so that *gasp* Emeraldas recognises his garb while travelling  on a train through the middle of nowhere, only to *gasp* find the very  planet on which Tetsuro is residing, arriving just in time as Tetsuro dies,  which *gasp* miraculously brings Harlock onto the scene, which then...  well, you get the idea. Not enough coincidences? Not to worry -- there's  plenty more where they came from.
It's really quite shame, since there's  a fairly decent story which goes along with all this -- as Tetsuro  progresses along his journey, he also grows up to become a young man. The  Galaxy Express is not only a means of physical transportation, but it's a  metaphor about for life -- that life itself is a journey, punctuated by  various stops along the way, people embarking and disembarking. Some  interesting themes are thrown in as well -- most prominant is that of how  human mortality is part of what makes life itself meaningful. Not very  enlightening for today's more sophisticated audience, but remember that  this film was made almost twenty years ago. The fact that this film is so  old is quite obvious -- scratches on the original stock survived the video  transfer process quite well.
Age does have its advantages, though. This  movie was made at a time where real orchestras were used (in this case, the  Columbia Symphony Orchestra) to provide the soundtrack, a luxury reserved  for all but the most extravagant productions today. Even though the frame  rates are very low, the animators still spent the time to do perspective  motion frames, something that's pretty much left to the computers these  days. The English voice-overs were pretty much a mixed bag. Both Maetel and  Tetsuro's mother were acted in similar fashion -- not surprising, since  both were played by the same actress. Fortunately, the low-key intonations  suited both characters very well. We didn't fare so well with Tetsuro  himself -- the voice is very, very annoying. The one high-point: the  conductor was wonderfully played with just the right touch of  humour.
Galaxy Express 999 provides some interesting ideas, but drowns  under its own weight. The heavy-handedly directing and occasionally corny  scripting makes it unwatchable at times. A 'classic?' About as classic as a  Studebaker.",965779200,5,3527,4.969125214408233
803350,5,630418431X,"Galaxy Express was my first exposure to anime.  I was about 9 when I saw it in 1981 in a double feature with Popeye. I was amazed by this ""cartoon,"" and it started a life-long love affair with anime. The story is very powerful with very stirring visual images.  I was always very  taken by the young boy trying so hard to be a man, and the beautiful  android who misses her human body.  The moment that stuck with me the  longest is the stop on Pluto, where all the frozen bodies are kept in a  massive grave.  Very haunting imagery.
By the by, I am so happy that they  released the signature edition.  As a 9 year old, I didn't mind that  Captain Harlock spoke with a bad John Wayne impersonation, but it sure  distracted from the film when I saw it years later.  Yay for subtitled!
