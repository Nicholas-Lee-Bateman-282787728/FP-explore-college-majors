8231465,5,B000YA532G,My 3 year old LOVES this DVD.  It's great becuase he gets to see the actual construction vehicles in action!  We've watched it about 15 times in 3 days!,1244332800,2,152,4.206896551724138
8231466,5,B000YA532G,"I ordered several truck/construction DVDs at the same time and although this one was the most expensive, it was definitely worth the money. The soundtrack is done very well and the narrator, Charlie, speaks slowly and clearly so he's easy for my son to understand. The soundtrack switches between sounds of the construction trucks working, and very tolerable instrumental music, not like some other DVDs with relentlessly-repeated annoying jingles and nonsensical songs. There are lots of great, long shots of construction trucks working, so kids can really sit and watch the action. Other DVDs we got had such fast shots that they were hard for my son to follow. The machines featured in this DVD are the typical ones you see all the time - excavator, front-end loader, bulldozer, etc. whereas some other DVDs we got featured weird machines like mechanical bridges, that my son will never see. I REALLY recommend this! Entertaining for kids and not so annoying that you can't watch it too, even after 15 viewings in as many days :)",1225929600,12,1032,4.936781609195402
8231467,5,B000YA532G,"My son loves this DVD, received it as a gift and has never left his seat when it is on!  It is really accurate and will give your child great knowledge of what all the machines are doing at every site you drive by!  I park by construction sites when I can so my 3 year old can watch, too.  My husband is an iron worker and I operate loaders so this stuff is relevant at my house.  Charlie and the music are entertaining, you will not regret buying this one.",1207785600,4,457,3.989010989010989
8231468,5,B000YA532G,"Finally a DVD that can hold my truck obsessed son's attention! He loves all the different types of vehicles, and now shouts out the names of them when he sees them.

I received this DVD as a gift from a friend, and I am getting it for all of my son's friends for Christmas.

A great find!",1198022400,5,288,4.035087719298246
8231469,5,B000YA532G,"My 6 year old son has an obsession with construction sites so everytime we drive past one I have to stop so he can watch. UNDER CONSTRUCTION is the 3rd dvd of it's kind that I have purchased, and I must say it's been the only one worth the $15.00 price tag. The production value is high, the song is catchy, and most importantly, there is so much visual and audio information that I don't find myself having to stop the car to check out every construction site we see. If your kid likes this kind of thing (and you like to keep your day moving along) UNDER CONSTRUCTION is the affordable ideal.",1196640000,9,594,4.265486725663717
