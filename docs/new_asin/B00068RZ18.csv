2175712,5,B00068RZ18,"I love this DVD. I just finished my first time and see myself doing it for a long time. I work out 6 times a week, varying from Yoga to Steps, I get bored easily so I need to vary my workouts from time to time. However, I can see myself doing this one for a long run. I don't understand other reviews that said this workout is complicated ??? There is a whole section about poses, explaining everything. Anyway, I love it and hope we can get more DVDs like this one. This one is a winner.",1132185600,8,488,3.989795918367347
2175713,1,B00068RZ18,"I felt the demonstration was way too complicated, by the time I got it figured out I didn't even want to do it.",1129075200,6,111,3.869565217391304
2175714,5,B00068RZ18,This might be a bit difficult for people who have never done yoga before and they might give up easily. As with any workout it takes dedication and sticking to it. Otherwise the instructions are great.,1128816000,5,201,4.611111111111111
2175715,5,B00068RZ18,"I read about this DVD in a gossip mag and saw that many celebrities used Cameron's teachings. I thought, why not try it and see if I can get a celebrity body. I had experience in yoga before doing this tape, but even if I did not, the poses were easy enough to follow along. I like the layout of exercises. We started with yoga, then martial arts and end with meditation. It is the perfect warm up, work out and cool down. I love the way Cameron takes time in between each exercises to ""find your breath"" rather than rush through things like most workout programs. I found it to be moderately challenging and I broke out in a good sweat. I think this is a great program and it is nice to do something different to make exercising more fun. Highly recommend!",1116892800,29,757,4.263888888888889
2175716,3,B00068RZ18,"I practiced martial arts for a short period when I was younger and enjoy yoga more and more the older I get. Mr. Shayne's fusion of these two practices is intriguing but the video short changes the benefits of both. I agree with other critics that the martial arts section could be a couple minutes longer. What I found most disappointing was the hurried pace with which Mr. Shayne moved from pose to pose in the yoga section. The only pose held for any length of time is the perpetual downward-facing dog. None of the other poses are held long enough to warm up the muscles for the fast-paced kicks and jabs in the martial arts section. It seems like Mr. Shayne is determined to compress the entire ashtanga/power yoga cycle into the allotted 20 minutes. I recommend to the next instructor out there contemplating a similar workout video that they do fewer yoga poses, hold them longer and add a couple more minutes of martial arts. Also don't count the meditation finale into the workout time -I bet a lot of people are like me and heading to shower after one minute of searching for their center.  Good points of this video, beyond the concept, are the pose guide and Mr. Shayne has a nice presence and good demeanor - unlike my old martial arts instructor.",1114732800,25,1260,4.5506607929515415
2175717,5,B00068RZ18,"I've been looking for a martial arts based workout on DVD for my home fitness routine.  But besides the various kickboxing titles like Tae Bo, ""Budokon for Beginners"" was the only one I found.  The good reviews prompted me to take a chance on it.  I was delighted with ""Budokon for Beginners,"" and ended up getting more than I bargained for.

The workout begins with yoga, goes into martial arts, and ends with a Qigong meditation.  The overall workout is good, and I wish it were longer.  But it's quite effective on its own if you're pressed for time, or even better if you combine it with another activity (like 20 minutes on a stationary bike, for example).  Cameron Shayne's instruction is great - he cues well and is easy to follow.  As both a yoga newbie and black-belt level martial arts practitioner, I felt comfortable with his teaching.

In the martial arts portion, he uses real techniques and stances such as the front kick and Cat stance.  It's the closest I've seen to the real deal on a mainstream video workout.  That's not surprising, given Mr. Shayne's background as a high-ranking black belt instructor.  Indeed, it was almost like being in an actual Karate class.  The bulk of the martial arts section consists of straight punches and front kicks from stances, which are among the first techniques we teach to new students at our dojo.  With that in mind, as a Karate Sensei I would recommend this DVD for folks planning to begin a martial arts class, or even for current practitioners.  The yoga will help build core strength and flexibility, also important for martial artists.

Speaking of yoga, ""Budokon for Beginners"" turned out to be a good investment in more ways than one.  Besides its faithfulness to martial arts technique, it was my first exposure to yoga.  I never thought I'd get into it, but this DVD led me to investigate yoga and add it to my workout regimen.  As a result, I've enjoyed a number of yoga workouts by Rodney Yee, Baron Baptiste, and others.  It's always nice to get turned on to a new thing that's good for you.  Along those lines, I've also purchased Gaiam's ""T'ai Chi Beginning Practice"" and ""Qigong Beginning Practice.""  So far I've been happy with the Gaiam line of workout DVDs and yoga equipment.

NOTE: The Gaiam website indicates that Cameron Shayne has a Budokon weight loss system nearing release that includes three workouts.  From what I've seen in ""Budokon for Beginners"", I'll be purchasing it as soon as it's available.  UPDATE 10/11/05: If you have this DVD, you don't need ""Budokon for Weight Loss.""  The workout portions are very similar.  See my review of it for more details.",1113868800,188,2647,4.722707423580786
2175718,4,B00068RZ18,"Budokon for beginners is definitely a beginners routine. It has a pose guide for both the martial arts and the yoga so that there is no problem ever following the video. It could not be easier to follow and can be done by just about any fitness level. I am a blue belt martial artist and have been working in yoga for about four years. I am concerned that I may get bored with this routine fairly quickly. Combining martial arts and yoga was a great idea, however, it is imperative that an intermediate and advanced routine is developed. No matter what level you are at, this is a good and rounded workout.",1113004800,11,606,4.371681415929204
2175719,3,B00068RZ18,"On the plus side, the DVD is filmed very well; he has an inspiring physique and the concept is a great one. I just don't think it adds up to the sum of it's parts. The yoga sequence is nothing like what he shows off with at the beginning and is pretty basic. The martial arts section is entirely too short for any kind of cardio benefit and isn't enough time for a beginner to really drill anything. I suppose I could rewind the section three times through, but I think it could just have been a longer section. While closing with meditation is a good idea, stretching would be safer. Having a Pose guide is nice, but I was also disappointed that there weren't other DVD extras, for the price.

I wanted to like this DVD as a good cross-training addition to my collection but it's just not enough.

Perhaps Cameron Shayne will really let loose with the follow-ups to this DVD",1111363200,13,875,4.361963190184049
2175720,4,B00068RZ18,"I have a bunch of other dvd's that I use for cardio, yoga and pilates. Budokon is good for strength, flexability and mental focus. I've been taking Karate at a studio for about 4 months and the techniques used in the martial arts segment of this DVD are very accurate and easy to follow. It's a great suppliment to my Karate training and to the other workout DVD's that I use. This Budokon DVD is also a great workout for those who are new to fitness and/or Martial Arts.  If you're at an advanced fitness level, this DVD would still be a great mind/body workout to add to your routine.

2175721,5,B00068RZ18,I think this is the first in the series and I can't wait for the next one....it's a great mix of Power Yoga (vinyasa style) and Martial Arts. Cameron Shayne is a great instructor...he gives great form pointers. I want to mention that the setting is indoor (brick room) and the workout is straight forwards...nothing fancy but I like how you warm up your body with power yoga and add cardio-kick and ended the routine with a short meditation.,1104364800,12,441,4.594936708860759

I gained a lot of weight so it's back to the drawing board and I'm starting with this. Hope I can come back next month with a weight loss to brag about!! I HOPE!!  I couldn't do the whole thing today. So many interruptions from everywhere. Plus it's not soo easy. Which is good. If I want easy I'll walk or bike ride,1412121600,,459,4.146067415730337

2175735,4,B00068RZ18,While this is not perfect. I'm not going to pick it apart. Cameron is a capable and competent instructor. I found the martial arts part of this workout is very useful and combine it with other workouts. Its a great short workout for midday. In 10-12 mins it energizes. Gets the blood moving and feels great. Especially if you do the breathing right. Really good for kapha types.,1396396800,,378,4.573529411764706
2175736,3,B00068RZ18,"Honestly, I don't understand why this item took so long to get to me.  It nearly took a week n a half to two weeks.  I order from Amazon regularly and other items I purchased after this and before it, came first before this did.  Maybe it was the weather, I don't know.  But, I wasn't satisfied with the shipping aspect of it.

Otherwise, the DVDs were in great shape, came in its original packing, brand spanking for the low price, I mean you can't beat that.  Love, love... The martial arts, yoga and meditation together.  The meditation especially, helps calm me down and reduce my anxiety.  The yoga was a little hard for me, I'm a beginner to yoga but I love a challenge, but the martial arts whipped my butt....  I love every minute!

2175739,4,B00068RZ18,"First of all to the negative reviews I would say please notice the name of this video is ""Budokon for BEGINNERS"".
The only reason for the 4 stars is that even for a beginner I would have considered the 2 workouts together without the meditations to be the short workout and would have loved to have seen a 30 minute yoga workout and at least 45 minutes of the Budokon as a full length workout.  All in all I found this to be excellent. Cameron is a fabulous teacher.  I am able to follow the yoga by following his clear detailed instruction and for beginners the poses are held about right. Granted you will eventually memorize the movements, but never the less, an excellent teacher guides you with clear instruction so that you don't have to be looking up to see what leg your supposed to be on etc.  Also the fact that he offers a pose guide to the movements is excellent.  The guy is a pro.  His explanations along with visuals are very clear and concise.  I had borrowed his ""Flow and Flexibility"" vid from the library and I fell in love, but even though he does a fabulous job of articulating the movements slowly enough to follow, if you are not in shape, you will not be able to execute.  The movements require strength, flexibility and agility.  I will be using this beginner version to work towards his more advanced workouts.  So happy the Universe conspired to lead me to this video.  Thank you Cameron Shayne for a wonderful method that is exactly what I was looking for even though I did not know it.  Namast",1383782400,,1522,4.419354838709677
2175740,3,B00068RZ18,"The DVD is in great shape (bought it used). I paid more in shipping than I did for the item. My disappointment was in the content of the DVD. The 2 workouts on here are almost identical, it is very basic beginner content. I guess I needed the intermediate Budakon, if they have one. I use it occasionally to mix up my workouts.",1380499200,,327,4.2063492063492065

I work up more of a sweat doing this than I did doing two workouts put together! AWESOME!!

I love the yoga - it gets you warmed up and stretched; The martial arts is intense and fun; the Meditation is great - it cools you down, you come out of it feeling refreshed and focused.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!",1373760000,,554,4.359223300970874

2175747,5,B00068RZ18,"I bought this dvd while wandering around CVS with my sister because I really wanted to get in shape. At 25 years old I can honestly say I have probably worked out only a handful of times my entire life. I could never commit to working out because everytime I would start exercising my mind would keep wanting to give up and sooner or later I would. Whether or not I'd like to admit it, I am a lazy person. I'd rather go on a 2 week fast to loose weight than exercise. Even so, I am smart enough to know that exercise is essential to both our physical and mental health so I really wanted to find a workout routine that was doable for me. I finally found one with this dvd. It's long enough for you to sweat and get your heart rate up, yet short enough to get through without quiting. I was literally dripping sweat after I finished this video! It was a lot of fun and I felt amazing afterwards. I do not know how effective it will be towards weight loss or toning, but it was fun enough for me to want to continue doing it. I will give an update after a few weeks of doing this regularly (3-4 times a week?) to let you know if it is truly an effective workout video :)",1299715200,,1168,4.038793103448276
2175748,3,B00068RZ18,"This workout is good for someone who is new to martial arts or Yoga.  It has some basic moves and poses for those disciplines.

Yoga:  The yoga poses are mostly strength and flexibility poses, relating to martial arts muscle groups (thighs, shoulders, and core).  Once done a few times, it is not very challenging.

Martial Arts:  This is a tae bo type of exercise routine.  It is very basic, and will not make your even break a sweat.

Meditation:  I am sure some people will think critically about this, but I skipped over this part most of the time.  I was looking for an endurance workout, and I found that a meditation was a huge break.  It was meant to be a cooldown in addition to being spiritual, but I found it to do neither effectively.  I didn't really give the spirituality a chance, in all fairness, but the cooldown was not effective since it was essentially an abrupt stop to the exercise.  To effectively cool down, you need moderate exercise.  It beings down your heart rate, allows your body to drain away excess lactic acid from a long workout.  Granted, since the workout does not really do much for you, a cooldown is not as needed.

For a while, I used this workout as a warmup for another MMA workout video.  It did its job well for a while, but the video is now shelved since I cross train with biking/running.

I have not tried the more advanced Budokon workout videos, as they are so expensive and I was a little shy about buying another in this series.  As an avid runner, Yoga should be a beneficial workout for my flexibility and leg strength so I may eventually give them a try.",1283644800,,1608,4.426621160409557

Cameron Shayne's instruction is spot on and I was able to do all of the moves which surprised me a little because I am new to yoga and the closest I've ever come to a martial art is Tae Bo.  I love his voice too - very soothing.  I think this would be a good choice for anyone who is interested in yoga and martial arts....or just a really great workout!,1278547200,,481,4.031578947368421
2175750,4,B00068RZ18,Good DVD but need to be a little more limber to do some of the stretches. The martial arts part I was able to pick up fairly quickly with practice. But you need to be limber and considerably thin to do the yoga moves.,1271203200,,217,3.9545454545454546

2175754,2,B00068RZ18,"Let me start off by saying that this workout is refreshing since it aims to combine martial arts and yoga.  There is an instructional section on the DVD that breaks down every move and allows you to learn proper form and do the moves several times.  Then why does the instructor do this again during the actual workout for every move?!  V. frustrating to try to keep your heart rate up as he re-explains foot and arm positioning for every movement.
The express segment is the best part of the tape since there is very little talking.  Also, I thought it would be more of a fusion of yoga and martial arts but the DVD is split into a martial arts and yoga section with no cool down or stretch--(each workout ends with meditation.",1250121600,,728,4.41044776119403

I was expecting a program that combined the two into some new form of exercise but that's not really what it is.  There's a yoga section, a martial arts section and then a qigong section.  It's made me want to get back into yoga and learn more about qigong.  My flexibility needs some work before I can get the full benefit from this yoga section.  Overall, I like the idea of this program.",1226188800,,501,4.4021739130434785

2175758,4,B00068RZ18,"This DVD presents an accessible version of Budokon, a truly exhilarating practice. For those new to both martial arts and yoga, this will probably be challenging. For those new to just one of the two arts, it's a pleasurable and ""doable"" challenge. If you are experienced in both, you might find this DVD boring or easy; I suggest one of his non-beginner tapes (in which the yoga and martial arts are actually fused.)

As someone in the second category (early intermediate yogi with no martial arts experience), I found the workout intense, fun, and addictive. The yoga sequence was pleasing, creating some heat but no pain. The martial arts segment unleashed explosive power I never knew I had. Together, they created a workout rush like I haven't felt in ages, and certainly not after just 40 minutes. I was on top of the world after finishing this DVD.

There are some problems, though. It isn't smart to go straight from full-on punch-and-kick sweat into meditation; you need a cooldown of slower-paced movement in between. This is an egregious omission from someone who seems to know a lot about exercise. If you do this DVD, I *highly* recommend inserting your own cooldown. It almost hurt to enter meditation with my heart pounding so hard, and because of it I had chest pains the next day. That shouldn't happen.

Also, the chaptering of this DVD is crummy. What is worse, every time you have to restart the DVD due to screensaver interventions, etc., it takes you back to the beginning and Gaiam's horrible introductory advertisement.

To those who say this isn't really fusion, you're right when it comes to this DVD but wrong when it comes to Budokon. I did a 3-hour Budokon workshop with live senseis, and they taught advanced techniques that were indeed karate/yoga fusion. The content of this DVD is more like pre-Budokon. It builds a good yoga/martial arts foundation for real Budokon, but it doesn't include any of real Budokon's highly original poses and combinations.

Still, it's powerful, compelling exercise that makes you feel strong and energized, and could spark what might later become an authentic Budokon practice.",1219276800,7,2141,4.936111111111111

I am looking forward to doing the short workout with less instruction!",1200528000,,329,4.32258064516129
2175761,5,B00068RZ18,"Combine a slow version of power yoga with some mixed martial arts (mostly kicking and punching) and a dash of meditation at the end, and you have Budokon for Beginners.  While this routine may be for beginners of Budokon, the very out of shape might find it too difficult.  Budokon assumes some level of flexibility, and if you are overly stiff, you may benefit from a yoga routine, especially one that focuses on strength and flexibility in the legs and core.  You'll need a solid core and strong legs for Budokon.

I have a number of exercise DVDs and VHS tapes, and I can easily say that Budokon for Beginners has the best presentation and production I have seen in an exercise video.  Specifically, Cameron Shayne's pose guide is among the best out there.  Even experienced yoga practitioners can learn something from him.  The language he uses to describe poses and forms is both familiar and unique--most often for the better, sometimes not.  Even if you know how to do all of the poses, use the pose guide.  It's a work out in itself, and you might find some tips on how to perfect your forms.

Budokon for Beginners is nothing new per se - yoga, martial arts, and meditation have been around for many years - but it's the combination that is effective in this routine.  Yoga, of course, gives you flexibility, strength, and a sense of oneness with your body; martial arts gives you flexibility, strength, cardio, all of which produce a feeling of power; and the meditation section, while very brief, lowers your heart rate after nearly half and hour of continuous movement.

The short and long versions of the main routine are helpful once you get past the need for introductions to the poses and movements.  The shorter version doesn't allow for as much rest, and so the intensity is higher than that of the longer version.

During this routine, you will spend most of your time on your legs and core since that is where most of your muscles are located and where most of your physical power originates (for both yoga and martial arts).  I use the routine on days when I don't go to the gym to lift weights and feel like moving around more than doing only yoga.  I'm positive you'll find a place for this routine in your exercise schedule.",1192752000,4,2248,4.5964912280701755
2175762,2,B00068RZ18,"The Good: The martial arts segments will get you sweating. The yoga poses are held for respectable durations.

The Bad: Not the fusion of martial arts and yoga that it promises to be, but actually two separate practices. Both yoga and martial arts routines will challenge only newcomers.

The Verdict: Borrow it from a friend, borrow it from the library, but try it before you buy it! Take a basic yoga routine and follow it with a basic karate routine. This is neither fusion-nor inventive.

Full Review: I received this DVD as a gift from someone who knew I enjoyed both martial arts and yoga. I found the concept of fusing martial arts and yoga to be very intriguing. Unfortunately-the concept was never realized, as this is but a basic yoga session followed by a basic karate session. I find the claim that the two practices are ""fused together"" to be very misleading, and quite frankly-disappointing.

One thing that Cameron Shayne totally missed out on was taking advantage of the flowing, vinyasa nature of yoga while integrating karate. In yoga where one pose flows into the next, and you finally make your way to targeting the other side of the body-Cameron's karate session is basically: X number kicks on the left. X number of kicks on the right. X number of punches on the left. X number of punches on the right.

Does that sound boring? It is.

I wouldn't recommend this DVD as it offers absolutely nothing new-and doesn't realize the claim of ""fusing"" martial arts with yoga any more than a triathlon fuses running, biking, and swimming together.

If you want a great flowing yoga dvd, I'd recommend Rodney Yee, Power Yoga-Full Body. If you want to get a glimpse of how martial arts and yoga might be fused together, I'd recommend Duncan Wong Yogic Arts - Source Power. Its a much closer representation of the fusion that martial arts and yoga could become.",1189987200,11,1871,4.720858895705521
2175763,4,B00068RZ18,"The concept is very good.  I like variety.  I found the yoga portion very difficult as I have NOT been exercising.  The martial arts section was easier for me.  Overall, I think this DVD would be challenging for someone who has NOT been exercising, but it is a good workout and you need to do the moves as best as you can.",1178064000,,322,4.145161290322581
2175764,3,B00068RZ18,"When Cameron Shayne says ""beginner"" he means it.  Not that this DVD isn't presented well.  Mr. Shayne is obviously adept at both martial arts and yoga, but this tape does not ""combine"" the arts as advertised.  You do a little yoga, stop, then you do a little karate. The finish is a standing meditation.  Having practiced karate sporadically over a twenty year period with advancement through the ranks and some proficiency and yoga steadily over three decades, I was excited that someone had purportedly blended the arts.  Truly excited. But when I did the workout the first time, I found that my basic training in both arts was enough to get through the workout without breaking a sweat.  I don't claim to be adept at either, but once you have learned to punch and kick and practiced karate for some time, and worked your yoga practice somewhat, you're already way past this tape.  Not past Mr. Shayne, however.  The flashes of brilliance he shows in both are impressive.  I just wish he was teaching a little more of it here. If you have a background in these arts, use your imagination and create your workout as Mr. Shayne did.  Save the fifteen bucks.",1177372800,6,1157,4.655172413793103
2175765,3,B00068RZ18,I like Cameron Shayne as an instructor and the way he teaches but the dvd is for a beginner only because if you want a good workout forget it.

The transition into the martial parts portion come just in time, and that routine is gradual and manageable for someone trying to build their stamina. As I mentioned, I have little to none, but this was the perfect way to start gaining some. Ending with meditation lets you relax your mind and body and thank yourself for doing such a great workout.

Shayne's instruction is excellent, not overly preachy, corny, or chipper. Easy to understand, and in the longer version he gives you chances to catch your breath and balance. He challenges, but he doesn't push. I'm taking 18 credits at college right now, and this is going to be a great tool to teach myself focus and endurance.

I appreciate that there is a long, instructional version, and a short version which has minimal instructions. This avoids tedious going over important details if you already have it down.

Cameron Shayne imparts a great attitude throughout the video...positive without chirpiness, gentleness without wimpiness, and brings in some of the more ""spiritual"" aspects of martial arts and yoga without being dogmatic or off-putting. I really like how he gives time enough to recenter and refocus and breathe throughout the workout. Definitely a great teacher.

I think is really a better workout for the intermediate exerciser. If you're just starting out in yoga or ""kickboxing"" workouts it may be too exhausting or difficult.

Oh, and even though the DVD states this is one whole workout, you actually CAN do just the yoga or just the martial arts if you're short on time. Just be sure to stretch before the martial arts.",1133481600,22,1088,5.095505617977528
