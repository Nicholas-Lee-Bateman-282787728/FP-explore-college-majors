8244759,3,B001296XS6,"A great deal of this dvd deals in choosing a driving horse and the different disciplines of miniature horse driving. While interesting enough, I purchased this to learn how to train my mini to drive and so it was not that helpful. It has some good information and does show how to harness your horse, but not much to get you started training. I was disappointed, since I felt for the large price tag, I should have received much more content and length of video. The content is only about 20 minutes. This is first in a series and gives you very little information on how to acutally train your horse. You will need to purchase the next dvds in the series, which at $40 a pop, is way too expensive in relation to product received, in my opinion, and I will not be purchasing them. If you are planning on competing with your miniature horse and money is not a problem, then this series would be a good product to buy.",1257033600,11,916,4.3313953488372094
