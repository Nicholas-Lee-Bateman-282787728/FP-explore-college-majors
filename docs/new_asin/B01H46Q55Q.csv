7776451,5,B01H46Q55Q,"I have all the other Ballet Beautiful workouts and just tried this latest one yesterday. I loved it! I always find the Ballet Beautiful workouts quite similar to one another despite different sequencing and emphases, but I found this one quite different from Mary Helen's usual. In particular, the arms segment is the first of hers I've done that does not have 'swan arms' at all. As mentioned by another reviewer, she does variations of tricep dips and ballerina push backs instead, which is a pleasant change (although I do love her swan arms series). The inner thighs segment is also different from the usual lifts, and I found the arabesque segment much more challenging than any of her other work. This workout still contains Mary Helen's signature sweet style while she leads you through intense burning, but I personally feel that the moves are fresher and newer this time around. Definitely a must have for Ballet Beautiful enthusiasts!",1470960000,21,944,4.943396226415095
7776452,3,B01H46Q55Q,"I gave it only 3 stars because I expected something very different from her usual DVD's.
It is not. The title seems somewhat misleading.
Otherwise it is o.k I enjoy her DVD's.",1470182400,6,175,4.5
7776453,4,B01H46Q55Q,"This is a mixed workout that you can do in sections or do all at once. Please note the tips, cues and modification recommendations. I am pretty advanced (though new to ballet) and I found this one a real challenge.  I like all parts of this because I can modify according to how I feel that day. It will make your muscles sizzle!  I found that it was often a challenge to walk if I skipped the stretch -- so don't skip it!
Mary Helen Bowers is a great teacher but her cueing on this video is not as slow and helpful as it has been on other videos (I have 3 other videos of hers). I bought this one to mix it up a bit since I found one video previously purchased was too fast a pace for me.
You WILL see results if you do this 2-3 times a week. Do the workout on the custom feature so that you can work different body parts on different days!",1469318400,19,841,3.9411764705882355
7776454,5,B01H46Q55Q,This is an excellent workout DVD if you are a fan of Mary Helen's workouts!  I have all but her prenatal DVDs and this one is in my top 3 with the Original Total Body and BB Body Blast. I don't mind that the workout portion is only 40 minutes because the leg segments hit you at 'every' angle I'd hope to hit with this type of workout and I'm more than ready to stretch it out at the end!  I want to add that this is NOT a beginner DVD. I do yoga/crossfit/Pilates regularly and I still had to do the 'beginner' modifications frequently to make it through this DVD but that is what will make me keep working on it!  Be patient with yourself when you do this routine.,1468540800,17,665,4.061068702290076
7776455,5,B01H46Q55Q,"The Backstage Workout is a must-have if you love her Classic/Total Body DVD! I have all ten of the BB DVDs, and this one reminds me the most of the Classic ones in terms of how its structured.  I bought this back in January directly from the BB website, and have done this one many times since then. It's quickly become one of my favorites!

There is a Play All option on the main menu, or you can choose individual segments to play, one at a time. (You cant select more than one to string them together.)

There are also three audio options: play the workout with music and Mary Helens voice, play just with Mary Helens voice, and play just with music.

It is an all-mat workout, so all you need is a mat to do this and perhaps a small towel, which Mary Helen uses in a few places under her knees when shes on all fours.

Most of the exercises are done in four sets of eight reps, as Mary Helen usually does in her workouts, but there are some exercises where you do more or less than the four sets.

Mary Helen is in a beautiful purple leotard against a white backdrop with some palm plants as color. The music is her standard piano classical music, which I find so soothing.

The audio on this echoes a bit, as it has in some of her other more-recent workouts. Truth be told, though, I stopped noticing it since I was working so hard in the first section!

The segments are:

 Arabesque Extensions  For this segment, youll be on all fours, but will be balancing on one side since youll be using one arm and leg to do various leg extensions. This is one of the hardest for me since it requires a lot of balance!

 Ballerina Arms  Youll start by doing triceps dips. From there, she has you lay on your stomach and do a variation of what she usually calls her Ballerina Push-Backs. I really felt my arms in new ways!

 Abs with Core Twist  Starts with two sets of 12 reps of a crunch-type move, using your arms. Then youll go into oblique twists.

 Ballerina Legs: Inner Thighs  These are done on your stomach, and she has you moving your legs outwards. This was such a different variation on her inner thigh lifts, and they really burned in a good way!

 Staggered Bridge: Legs, Butt, and Core  Youll be doing bridge exercises, but with your legs staggered, one in front of the other.

 Elongating Stretch  Up until this point, the other sections take up the first 40 minutes of this workout. The Elogating Stretch is 20 minutes long.

Throughout the workout, Mary Helen takes her usual stretch breaks, but she mentions a few times that they are quicker than they usually are since well do the longer stretch at the end of the workout.

Speaking of the stretch segment, I'm still a bit disappointed that it wasn't an add-on as it was on the Ballet Baby DVDs. I would rather have a full 60 minutes of toning exercises, followed by a bonus 20-minute stretch. That being said, the 20 minutes of stretch goes by quickly. I usually hate stretching on its own, which is part of why I love Ballet Beautiful (because it incorporates stretching between sets), but this segment is really pleasant, and I actually enjoy doing it.

The core segment is also especially tough. This is the first BB workout Ive done that has left me sore deep in my core muscles the day after I do it.

Overall, I really love the Backstage Workout! If you love her Classic/Total Body DVD, you'll love this one, too!",1468022400,56,3384,4.376602564102564
8764613,3,B01H46Q55Q,"I have a few Ballet Beautiful DVDs, and this is good, solid intermediate workout. The problem I have with this DVD, and the others, is that Mary Helen doesn't offer much, if any, form pointers for the exercises. For example, when you're extending your leg, should the top of your foot be facing the wall, the floor, the ceiling? Should your elbows be back or lifted? What muscles should you feel for each exercise? I find it easier to do the DVDs without watching her, and just by listening and trying to ""feel"" what is right. This workout is as hard as you make it, I guess...",1523923200,2,577,4.401869158878505
8764614,5,B01H46Q55Q,"This DVD is the holy grail of Ballet Beautiful exercises. I highly recommend it for anyone who has been doing Ballet Beautiful exercises for awhile and need a fresh set of exercises. I found the workouts in this DVD to be the hardest of all Ballet Beautiful workouts. The results are incredible, of course. The bridge and arabesque extension workouts are so good for toning the back of the legs and butt.

The inner thigh workout is quite different from the other Ballet Beautiful inner thigh workouts I've seen. My hip turnout is almost non-existent, therefore I felt I was working more of my butt and back of my legs rather than the inner thighs. Nevertheless, it is still a great workout and I was shaking throughout.

The triceps exercise is so effective for combating problematic back-of-the-arm flabs. I can't praise it enough.

This DVD is your ticket to Victoria's Secret model legs and arms. Unlike the other Ballet Beautiful DVDs, the content of this DVD is available as part of the custom workout subscription. So if you're planning on subscribing to the custom workout, you can skip buying this DVD.",1514592000,7,1111,4.806282722513089
8764615,5,B01H46Q55Q,Not as good video quality as others but 5 stars for different moves and equal difficulty to get your muscles burning fast. Love her videos always challenging. Start with 2-3 sets then go for the whole 4.,1510272000,2,203,4.513513513513513
8764616,5,B01H46Q55Q,Amazing  workout! This DVD is definitely  different than her other dvds.  It is a nice workout to add to my collection!,1506816000,,119,4.571428571428571
8764617,5,B01H46Q55Q,"I have all the ballet beautiful workouts. I do this along with some Tracy Anderson DVDs and have gotten noticeable results. I think the workouts compliment each other and have many similar aspects. This is a more difficult workout, I especially like the arabesque lift portion, you can feel it work the whole side of your body. The stretching segment is fantastic, I now use it after doing all her other DVDs. Everything is new and very challenging. I would say if you are already a fan this would be a nice addition and if you are new I would begin with the Total Body workout.",1489622400,6,578,4.462264150943396
8764618,4,B01H46Q55Q,"I love all Mary Helen Bowers workouts/DVDs - I own all by the Ballet Baby ones (which one day I will purchase anyway despite not being pregnant!) This one is definitely a challenge and I consider myself an intermediate exerciser. I have done multiple rounds of Insanity and Jillian Micheals and many Beachbody workouts and yet MHB kicks my butt! It's a pretty tough workout, especially the first segment which basically has you balancing on one arm and one leg! I will have to work up to that because my one arm was shaking so bad I couldn't keep my balance! But I look forward to working up to that! It's got some new moves that made this a fun and challenging workouts. For any Ballet Beautiful fan, this is definitely a great workout to add to your collection.",1486080000,3,763,4.496402877697841
