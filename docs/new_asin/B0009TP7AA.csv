8066488,1,B0009TP7AA,"think you are going to relax, share a few laughs with your past and see some lucy movies? think again!  this is a butchered retake on SOME I Love Lucy t.v. reruns, slashed and cut snipets with voice overs from commentators we don't care about nor purchased this dvd to hear from. sort of funny, but the ford co. comercials were often the best part. Know why? they weren't interrupted. i like ford, i presently own a ranger, explorer and town car. i note some of the used dvd's are selling for 2 cents, i'd say if they paid for shipping, that's what this dvd is worth. i got screwed in buying this. don't follow me. if you pay for postage, you can have mine for free.",1228262400,,666,4.244094488188976
