8689532,5,B00PWET12W,"This DVD is a full length animated feature, very fun for kids, suitable for age 6 and up. Unlike alot of what is out there, this one is very good. It has been shown on Nickelodeon and you may have seen it there. It was first released on DVD in 2002. The story is based on the classic Robert Luis Stevenson tale of the same name. A young man meets Captain Long John Silver, and the adventure of a lifetime begins. Sailing ships, pirates, swordplay, buried treasure, it's all here.  I thought it was an enjoyable afternoon of viewing with my son.
 The Video from DIC Entertainment is of a movie produced in 2002, with very modern animation, it was animated by the Hong Ying Universe Company for DIC.
This movie is one of those that parents or babysitting teens will not mind watching too. It is 74 minutes long. The animation is fluid, the voice actors are good. Nice animated effects. Extras include bloopers, a behind the scenes show, and fun facts with Inspector Gadget. The same animation studio, ""DIC"", has released several titles to video and TV, such as animated versions of 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, Treasure Island, Time Kid, Sabrina, Globehunters, Zorro, and Dinosaur Island. The last 2 titles are really good. They also made the Archie's In Jugman movie, and Madeline, Dennis the Menace, and Inspector Gadget. Extras on the disc are Inspector Gadget info and fun facts. DVD quality is good, picture and sound clean, no issues with freezing up or anything.

By the way, until they fix it, Amazon.com is listing this review on both the DIC Entertainment movie, and the same review is appearing on another animated version by Golden Hill Media. They are two completely different movies despite both being animated tales with the same name. My review is for the 2002 production by DIC Entertainment (released to DVD in 2008 for the second time), the much better version of the two.",1262649600,,1890,4.7039274924471295
8689533,4,B00PWET12W,"This animated version of the classic boys' adventure story written by Robert Louis Stevenson is actually a re-release of a 1971 Australian production. While the animation itself is subpar compared to today's standards, it's average for the day. The voice work, which to my surprise included Hugh Keays-Byrne (Mad Max, Moby Dick), is pretty good. Pretty faithful to the original text, though a bit fast paced, this cartoon is suited for audiences of all ages (though primarily young children).",1055635200,,492,5.2405063291139244
