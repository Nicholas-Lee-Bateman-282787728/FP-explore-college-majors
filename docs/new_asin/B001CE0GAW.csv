3511118,4,B001CE0GAW,I missed this series when it was on HBO. When I saw it on Amazon I decided to pick it up as a Christmas gift for my sister. She loves Jill Scot. She was very happy to get she hadn't seen the series either. We'll have a movie night and I will update after I watch an episode or twe.,1388620800,,281,3.7
3511119,5,B001CE0GAW,"This series is so delightful with great characters.  Getting an insight into another culture is a real benefit.  So nice to have it so I can enjoy it over and over again.  Quiet, thoughtful manner is a real plus.  Beautifully done, visually as well as story wise.",1383004800,,263,4.531914893617022
3511120,5,B001CE0GAW,"This is one of the most original television shows to come out in recent years.  Jill Scott puts in a masterful performance as Precious Ramotswe.  Her acting is exceptional, especially when you consider that her formal training is minimal, and she started late in life.  I've met people from that part of the world (the story is set in Botswana), and her accent is dead-on.

Precious' wealthy father dies, and rather than raise his large herd of cattle, she sells them and starts a detective agency, since all her life people have told her that she would make a good detective.  Rather than moving to the city to start a ""proper"" business, Precious rents the vacant half of a building in her township, becoming neighbors with an iffeminate homosexual hairdresser whose clients are all the snotty, skinny, rich girls in town.  Precious, who is anything but skinny, often receives derisive looks.

When she decides she needs a secretary, Precious hires Grace Makutsi, a nerdy waif who finished first in her class at secretarial school but can't get a job because businessmen only hire sexy secretaries, regardless of their skills.  Grace eventually becomes a partner in the agency.

As opposed to most modern-day detective shows, No. 1 Ladies takes a more basic, non-technological approach to crime-solving, somewhere between Encyclopedia Brown and Columbo.  Solving cases involving a cheating wife, a missing husband, a mysterious shoe thief, and a cursed hospital bed, Precious and Grace become inseparable friends.  As the show progresses, the two find real danger, however, including a criminal organization, a rival big-city detective, and Precious' violent ex-husband.

With unrivaled charm, the No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency brings back old-school criminal investigation in an era of high-tech forensics.  It's a real shame this program wasn't allowed to continue.",1364774400,,1868,5.249158249158249
3511121,2,B001CE0GAW,"I am a big fan of the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency books. They are gentle, full of commentary on morals and ethics, and there are more than a few lessons to be learned. I was hoping to see that translated to the screen; I was sorely disappointed. The stories are only VERY loosely based on the original plots, and there are gratuitous characters and events that add nothing to the mix. Note Mokoti plays trumpet at Mma Ramotswe's father's funeral? Seriously? And the story of the ""Government Man"" was completely butchered. Mma Ramotswe and Mma Makutsi are both made out to be blundering idiots (the ""break-in"" at the curio shop, for example) in several spots. Finally, in what can only be interpreted as capitulation to political correctness, Michael Curtin and his mother are no longer white people in the screen adaptation. With the wealth of material in the books, this TV series promised so much and, in my opinion, delivered so little. I'm not surprised it was canceled after one season.",1406160000,2,994,4.784883720930233
3511122,5,B001CE0GAW,"loved it.  what a wonderful series!  Botswana is a terrific setting for some quirky, interesting and admirable characters  A detective series that is gentle and fun.",1394150400,,165,5.269230769230769
3511123,5,B001CE0GAW,"Love these books, and the characters are well done.  Haven't actually finished watching, so can't go into a lot of detail, but so far it's just plain fun.  Definitely recommend for anyone who likes the books.",1392595200,,208,4.75
3511124,5,B001CE0GAW,"Ma Ramotswe has chutzpah!  Having hung out her shingle as a detective, she finds that all sorts of odd cases come her way.  The cast is delightful, as is the dusty African town.",1392336000,,177,4.333333333333333
3511125,5,B001CE0GAW,Still a favorite and wishing there was more. The characters are true to the book -- colorful. Jill Scott is great in her role of Ma Ramotswe and Anika Noni Rose is truly a gem as Grace Makutsi.,1391817600,,193,4.105263157894737

3511128,5,B001CE0GAW,This series does an excellent job of following the plots and characters from the books - as fun to watch as they are to read!,1389139200,,125,4.04
3511129,4,B001CE0GAW,"This was a very fun series. I was lent it originally by a friend who had lived for some years in Africa and read all the books by the author whose work this series is based on. It was so much fun that I bought the series as a Christmas gift for my parents. This is a fun, light way to be exposed to the different rhythm of life in Botswana.",1388880000,,340,3.8028169014084505
3511130,5,B001CE0GAW,"I'm a huge fan of the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency book series, so I bought the video a year ago.  My daughter saw some of the video when she was visiting, and she has become a fan of the book series, so I bought her the DVD set for Christmas this year.  Made her very happy!",1388793600,,277,3.8421052631578947

8287223,1,B001CE0GAW,"I was not able to view this video.  I found out that it did not play on a regular DVD recorder.  We also tried our Blu-ray DVD recorder and it did not play on that one either.  It must be designed to play on a recorder from the UK I guess.  So it was of no use to us.

I had viewed this video a few years ago on either Netflix or Amazon and it is a great video.  I just wish I could find one that plays on my recorder.",1517097600,,418,3.5384615384615383

8287226,5,B001CE0GAW,"We just love this 3 DVD set, and don't understand why this was not a HUGE hit with people. I suppose since we lived in Africa for years has something to do with our enjoyment of this series. The character development was very well done, and there are many touching scenes as well as many funny moments. Mixes humor with danger and serious subjects, along with a love story, to boot. Also many great scenes from Africa. We loaned out our copy and didn't get it back, and we missed it so much that we sprung for another set of Season One.",1479513600,4,536,4.264705882352941
8287227,5,B001CE0GAW,"I love this series, the rhythm of the soundtrack, the cadence of the actors' speech, the locale, the rich variety of characters, everything is just as it should be. Not every case is solved perfectly, but each ending leaves you feeling that it ended just as it should.",1410307200,,268,4.604166666666667
