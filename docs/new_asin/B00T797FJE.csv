7002786,1,B00T797FJE,"Very bad transfer.  I would suggest buying the DVD version that was released in the late 1990s which was not a DVD-R.  That one was an official release with crystal-clear picture and sound, unlike this cheap release. I can't believe Amazon and studios are now partnering and selling customers DVD-Rs at new prices.  Unbelievable.  Buy the prior release, until there is a Blu-ray, if that ever happens.",1436832000,,401,4.940298507462686
7002787,4,B00T797FJE,"This was Bob Fosse's last film, finished a very short time before his death. His obsession with his own mortality, which manifested much of his later work, was poured into this remarkably constructed film. Fosse dedicated the movie to one of his few truly dear friends, Paddy Chayefsky, who had died only a few months before filming began. Chayefsky's passing shook Fosse deeply and it is clear from this film that he knew he himself was living on borrowed time. Death overshadows every frame of this film.

The performances, the scene construction, the editing and well...just everything, clearly shout Bob Fosse with far more intimacy than any other of his films. Without the normal razzle-dazzle of his remarkable dance numbers to fall back on, Fosse instead choreographed his take on the life of Dorothy Stratten with the same kind of minute detail as her deranged husband choreographed her death.

The acting is superb, especially from Eric Roberts, whose performance as Stratten's husband, Paul Snider, is one of the creepiest ever put on film. Since the audience (most of them, anyway) know the eventual outcome of the movie, the build-up to the horrific ending is almost unbearable. The film has a ""mockumentary"" style with actors being interviewed by the camera as if they were the real people. This style was unique (but not unheard of) when the film was made, but completely common today.

As of this writing, the film is from the Warner Archive vaults and is only available on DVD. There is no additional material, just the film. I hope someday there is another, more comprehensive release because it would be interesting to hear from Fosse himself and those who worked with him about what was happening to him and the production crew as they worked through this very dark story.

Save this film for a good day, because as brilliant as it is, it is a complete downer.",1435622400,7,1879,4.8625

7002789,5,B00T797FJE,"I agree with a previous reviewer that this movie needs a BluRay treatment. My 4x3 disc had some supplemental stuff, which included footage from a Playboy party featuring the real ""actors"" in this riveting thriller-drama.

Eric Roberts' portrayal of Paul Snider ranks with the greatest overlooked performances of cinema.",1431475200,4,319,5.510204081632653

7002791,5,B00T797FJE,"STAR 80 is the true story of Playboy Playmate Dorothy Stratten who was killed in a murder/suicide by her estranged husband, Paul.

Fosse's final film is an unblinking look at how these events transpired. From her discovery at the Dairy Queen in her hometown to ""pampering at the Playboy mansion"", we are taken through Dorothy's world as she tries to make a name for herself.

Probably one of the most disturbing movies I have ever seen. The feeling of dread throughout makes it a very tough watch (and me thinks thats why Hemingway and Roberts were snubbred come awards time) but nonetheless fascinating and engrossing.

This copy of STAR 80 released by Warner Archives is in its original aspect ratio of 1.85:1 for the first time ever on home video. It really deserves a bluray release and in depth special features but at least the movie is finally in widescreen.

Highly recommended.",1425427200,9,886,4.809210526315789

7002798,4,B00T797FJE,"Star 80, 1983 film

This is a story of a Centerfold Model [what they won't teach you in school]. It tells how Flyboy searches for wholesome-looking women to pose and present their body as a fantasy attraction. Paul Snyder exercises and poses before a mirror. He organized a wet T-shirt contest for women who seek fame and fortune by displaying their body. [Is pride still the worst sin?] Dorothy was working in a Dairy Queen store while in high school when Snyder met her. Snyder takes her to dinner and gives her a jewel. Later they talk in private. She has a feeling that shes not good, and tells about a football player. Paul attacks him in a sneaky way! They took 20,000 pictures for her Flyboy layout over five months. Paul takes Polaroid pictures of her. I hope my mother never sees these says Dorothy. She lies to her mother. [Why was there no mention of her father?]

A professional photographer shoots her, tastefully nude. But he is cheated out of his $1,000 finders fee. Her mother must sign a release to allow this, Dorothy is only eighteen. Her mother refused to sign. Dorothy goes to the Flyboy mansion in Los Angeles and sees so many pretty girls. She may be the Centerfold for August. She meets Huey, who offers her a job as a waitress or Bunny. Theres no other magazine like Flyboy, he says. [Is competition restricted?] Dorothy will be paid $10,000 for her pictures. Paul wants to marry her. They show a party at the mansion. Huey doesnt want his models to be married. [For legal reasons?] They show a performance with young men. Dorothy acts in a movie, Wednesdays Child. Paul asks her for more money. They show a roller-skating rink. [Do they still do this today?] Dorothy has a new assignment in New York, Paul is angered. She misses Vancouver. [Familiar environment?]

Was Dorothys character really as emotionless as shown here? She is not allowed to chew gum, it has sugar in it. Paul wonders if Dorothy is being given drugs. He has an idea for a Health Spa in Los Angeles. His plans are frustrated. [Market saturation?] Dorothy gets too many calls from him. Paul gets a report on Dorothy from a private detective. Is there a written contract? Paul buys a used shotgun. Dorothy closed her bank account. Paul knows where Dorothy is living - with that director. Paul is wired to record conversations, but it doesnt work. They meet, Paul wants to get back together. He is angry. She wants it to be over. Paul loads his shotgun. Dorothy hugs him, but he is jealous of that director. Paul fires his shotgun once, then twice. Would Dorothy have had a happier life if she was just average looking? [Read Beautiful Bad Girl for another story.]

This movie shows a side of show business that is not publicized. Not all Centerfold Models suffer like this, but what happens to them after five or ten years? I guess this is not considered fit to print. Some of the novels of Erle Stanley Gardner warned about the local beauty contests whose winners would be used for commercial purposes, then given a one-way ticket to Hollywood. Without experience or contacts they did not have the future they hoped for (The Case of the Queenly Contestant). I think Flyboy began around 1955, its purpose was to outsell magazines like Argosy or True, the Mens Magazine and put them out of business. Local barber shops carried them like beauty shops carried the National Inquirer. People like to read them but wouldnt have them in their own homes. Or have things changed since then? [Do you know why Public Libraries do not carry Flyboy?]",1471824000,,3532,4.637380191693291

8700822,5,B00T797FJE,"***** 5 Stars ***** Shame on the reviewers who decided to watch a movie about the (infamous) murder of a Playboy model, and then dumped on the film because it had nudity and bad language. You can't be so dumb that this surprised you. FYI: This is the last film directed by Bob Fosse, the genius choreographer, writer and director who gave us ""Cabaret,"" ""Chicago,"" ""All That Jazz,"" and many more great plays and films. Ask yourself: Did his 1972 film, ""Cabaret"" offend you? It won 8 Academy Awards, and was much more sexual in its theme than ""Star 80,"" which is about the brutal murder of a young woman and is about as un-sexy as I can imagine. All I can say is R.I.P. Dorothy ...""First born Unicorn.""",1524355200,,700,4.434108527131783
