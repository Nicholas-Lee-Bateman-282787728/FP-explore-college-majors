7934056,3,B000059S0L,"Having the first eight Sorcerer Hunters' books I figured to try out the anime.  I was somewhat unimpressed with it.
The artwork is OK, the music was nice and some of the stories come right out of the manga, but the delivery was flawed.  The anime's rhythm was off, as it tried to be funny when it should be serious and it was serious when it should be funny.  The humor was light and not as kinky as I would have liked.
Even the voices seemed a tad off which really killed it for me.  Voice work is very important to the feel of any anime, just look at ""Cowboy Bebop"", ""Tenchi Muyo!"" or even ""Those Who Hunt Elves!""
The DVD had seven episodes and I barely remember ANY of them!
I don't think I'll be ordering the other DVDs (unless somebody tells me they get A LOT BETTER than this one).",1057795200,,787,4.157894736842105
7934057,5,B000059S0L,"No one else seems to mention it, but with a lead characters named after food, particularly the Carrot/Kakarrot(DBZ) bit, this show is very funny. I'm sure people think I'm insane as I sit laughing my head off in waiting rooms, fast food joints, wherever, reading the latest manga of this series. Watch it with an eye out for other shows & you'll see what I mean. Marron's my favorite--very cool in the manga, but not necessarily gay(maybe a bit too fond of his brother as we see in the anime with his wish being to see his brother happy)--a very devoted brother to Carrot. Mille Fleur has a larger role in the manga also, flirting with just about everyone in the cast & really enjoys being mistaken for a female. Zaha Torte is  one of the coolest & noble villains out there, believing so firmly Big Momma is wrong, he basically becomes the devil of the Spooner Continent to oppose her vision.
I strongly suggest reading the manga which fleshes out the anime, explaining some of the plot dumped in the name of time. (The girls are topless at least once per graphic novel it seems & we lost Gateau's sister & Zaha's other cohorts in the anime. We also find out about Dotta's winged boyfriend & the Glace parents, Onion & Apricot)",1026345600,5,1227,4.502242152466367
7934058,5,B000059S0L,"I thought this series was very cool when I first saw it.  This is my first review on on an anime and this dvd knocked me out.  The
humor and animation were great. Carrot Glace acts silly always chasing after girls and Tira and Chocolate are always beating him up. I think its because they want to spend the night with him that he avoids them. I never suspected that Marron and Gateau were gay. Tira and Chocolate look so sexy,hot and beautiful when
they transform. If you like magic,adventure and sexy humor, this
is the anime for you.",1017360000,,535,4.393939393939394
7934059,5,B000059S0L,"I saw this way back in its fansub days, and I can tell you this:  It's an excellent series, as long as you can sit through the first dozen episodes.  The first dozen are pretty much the same story each time, with a little bit of character development, and hints of a greater plot.  Around episode 13, it looks like they changed storywriters entirely, because the entire rest of the series focuses very heavily on one major plot point, which gets progressively better and more engaging.
It's definately one of my top ten anime series, and I recommend it.  You just might have to force yourself past the first few (though there are a few gems on this first disk, episode 5 for example is some of Carrot's best development in the series)",990144000,2,734,4.496240601503759
7934060,5,B000059S0L,"For those of you who remember the days of fan subs, Bakuretsu Hunters (Sorcerer Hunters) was one of the best titles out there. And it still is. Where else you can find a guy who turns into a beast of destruction that must be whipped back to human form by VERY scantily glad, gorgeous women as a central plot theme? Aside from that, the story is good and stands on its own merit, the animation is excellent for the time it was produced in, and the characters will leave you in hysterics. If you're looking to get into Anime, or have been in the know for a while and haven't checked out this title, you won't regret it.",989798400,3,617,4.237288135593221
7934061,3,B000059S0L,"Sorcerer Hunters is an odd beast.  For a show featuring a lecherous hero and two dominatrixes as heroines, it has basically no sexual content beyond some suggestive dialogue.  I don't recall any actual nudity, either (if there was any, it wasn't much, although some outfits are revealing).  These are good points--the show would be unwatchable if they had moved any further in that direction than they did.  The basic premise is simple enough: the group (which is made up of five people, but the other two get basically no screen time) hunts down sorcerers who oppress the innocent; they are given their commands by a quasi-divine entity known as Big Momma.  The show is a comedy, hence the outlandish nature of the two female leads.  There is some violence, but most is directed at the hero and meant to be funny.
The problem with this show is not that it's a bad comedy; rather, the seven episodes on this disc (which should make it a good value) are almost exactly alike.  Hero chases girls, heroines punish hero, and almost by happenstance, the villain is dispatched.  Repeat five times and the DVD is done (the odd episode out doesn't really have a villain, but otherwise...).  Any individual episode would be pretty good; together, you're wondering whether anyone working on this show had more than the one idea which became the premise.",986515200,3,1343,4.804347826086956
7934062,4,B000059S0L,"This series came highly recommended to me by several of my friends, and I have to admit, it is pretty good.  It is certainly more of a shounen (boy) anime, but it is still very funny.  The DVD includes seven episodes at the regular DVD price, seven instead of three or four episodes always being a major plus (especially for the ill-funded teenage world, ne? ^_^), and it has the typical ADV previous, some bios, Japanese and English dialogues, and the original trailer.  The story is pretty good, an extreme melodramatic comedy, focusing on the lives of the amazing and mysterious Sorcerer Hunters, who's duty is to punish/kill/'take care of' rogue sorcerers using forbidden magic.  The team includes the girl- obsessed Carrot Glace, his way too pretty brother Marron, muscle-man Gateau Mocha, and the voluptuous Tira and Chocolate Misu, both of who's job is to keep Carrot in line.  This anime is definitely not one I would suggest for anyone younger than thirteen (there is some rather perverted humor and foul language in the show, although nothing worse, at least not in this DVD, and the box rating suggests 15+ -- I haven't seen any farther though so I can't say), but the art is well done, and the Japanese voice cast includes the renowned Megumi Hayashibara (female Ranma, Lina from Slayers, etc) as Chocolate.  However, the English dub (most of which I usually avoid with fervor) really isn't all that bad, and some stuff is actually much funnier in the English version.  Oh yeah, and the beginnning and ending songs are great!  I love them!  SO, if you like buxom women, bishi (cute/pretty) guys, and go for extremely melodramatic comedies, try it!  Its a good deal, and a promising series!",984873600,6,1701,4.814432989690721
7934063,5,B000059S0L,"I would highly recommend this DVD to fans of Anime. Whether hardcore anime fans or casual ones. This series is hilarious and action packed. The characters have very detailed personalities and has a very exciting plot, too. Once again I recommended this to any anime fan.",984787200,,270,4.891304347826087
