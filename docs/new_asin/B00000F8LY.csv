7907373,4,B00000F8LY,"Cute movie from the early 90's. Being a Corey Haim fan I loved it. He's energetic and always watchable. Nicole Eggert is cute and fun in her role. These two had great chemistry. Nice LA backdrop.  Escapist fare.

The movie is in great condition, arrived quickly.",1519862400,,262,4.673913043478261

7907380,5,B00000F8LY,"I remember watching this movie when I was a kid. It was definately worth finding and re-watching again after all these years. This was not one of Corey Haim's most popular movies, but for a kid of the 90's, I loved it. As an adult, the movie is kind of silly, but it took me back to when I used to watch it as a kid and for that I really enjoy it. My kids enjoy it now.",1395446400,,369,3.7435897435897436
7907381,5,B00000F8LY,"I remembered one scene of this movie, and tried to track it down at least 5 times a year for maybe 15 years. Everyone I asked thought I was crazy, until a co-worker suggested I post the description on reddit. He said there was a sub-reddit where people would post obscure memories of movies, TV shows, and music, and people would tell them the names.

I posted it there and within 15 minutes I had my answer: The Double O Kid. I watched the trailer on youtube and was all but certain it was the movie. I then purchased it from Amazon hoping for the best: that was a mistake.

This is indeed the movie, but after so many years of glamorizing it in my head, I think I ruined it. It's not a bad movie, it just isn't a good one. It's perfect for when you want to watch something, but your not sure what, and you don't really want to have to pay too close attention. I think I paid less than $5 for it though, and just being able to get it on DVD feels like a win.",1358812800,3,959,4.015706806282722
7907382,5,B00000F8LY,Anything with Corey Haim in it I like. It's a very cute show. It's a movie a family could watch together and be entertained. It's very funny.,1201046400,2,141,4.2592592592592595
