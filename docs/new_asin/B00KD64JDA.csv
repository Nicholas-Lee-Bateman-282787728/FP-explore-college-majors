6415916,5,B00KD64JDA,"Great documentary. Enjoyed it very much. It was encouraging to see Israeli and Palestinian children getting past their fears and prejudices toward their ""enemy"" and learning to dance together and thus relate to each other on a personal level.",1409702400,8,242,5.230769230769231

6415934,5,B00KD64JDA,"Wonderful, frightening, beautiful, and hopeful movie. A ""must see"".",1413417600,3,67,6.555555555555555
6415935,1,B00KD64JDA,This film uses the story of the dance to spread the same old lies about Israel. Propaganda.,1410998400,,91,4.411764705882353
6415936,5,B00KD64JDA,"Moving, and wonderfully done. There were moments when I just couldn't imagine how the camera caught as much as it did. Could have been longer.",1410480000,5,142,4.72
8657757,5,B00KD64JDA,"ahh i want to hug all of these adorable kids. what a beautiful and heartwarming idea. pierre has such a lovely way of working with the children, its inspired me as a dance teacher.",1471564800,,180,4.323529411764706
8657758,3,B00KD64JDA,It is more about Pierre Dulaine's personal experiences being back in Jaffe (his family left when he was a child) and some of his efforts to convince the parents to allow their children to dance together than it is about the children as they learn to accept one another and collaborate in movement together.  For my pupose (using it to teach in a developmental psychology class) it doesn't have enough of the children.,1468022400,,417,4.712328767123288
8657759,5,B00KD64JDA,"This is a charming and very moving film about the dancer Pierre Dulaine's project to teach ballroom dancing to a mixed group of Jewish and Arab 5th grade students in Jaffa, Israel. Dulaine is an internationally awarded dancer and in his later years he went on to run the program ""Dancing Classrooms"" in the New York public schools and other cities. Teaching neighboring students in Jaffa to dance together was his biggest challenge. I cannot say enough about this film. It gives a clear-eyed version of a possible future in a heavily conflicted political environment. You will love this movie.",1464825600,,593,4.94
8657760,5,B00KD64JDA,Excellent movie! A must see,1456963200,,27,4.6
8657761,5,B00KD64JDA,"This film starts out slowly, but it truly is worth slogging through the first 30 minutes.  It pays off.  It shows some of the major issues facing Palestinians citizens in Israel and the divide between them and Jewish citizens.  It shows good hearted people on both sides of the conflict, and in the end, the message is one of hope.  A good film for adults and teens.",1455580800,,366,4.417910447761194
8657762,5,B00KD64JDA,Absolutely charming!,1454025600,,20,9.5
8657763,5,B00KD64JDA,"Heartwarming, hope-building documentary of how one man's dream to teach Arab and Jewish children to dance together played out.  It's definitely worth seeing.  The closing scene of the little blond Jewish girl and the dark skinned Arab boy rowing in the boat together is terrific.  Also, the unfolding of Noor, a chubby Arab girl whom no boys would ask to dance, to the confident smiling girl at the end, is wonderful to see.  Highly recommended for the personal and the political lessons.",1444953600,,488,4.914634146341464
8657764,4,B00KD64JDA,"I live in Jaffa, it's an awesome place where Arab and Jews live and coexist together and share good neighbors relationship. It's an living testimonial that Arab and Jews can get along just fine if you leave politic and propaganda aside. I started learning Arabic so I can practice with my neighbors.",1433721600,3,299,4.769230769230769
8657765,5,B00KD64JDA,"We used this in n interfaith potluck, with discussion following of what we can do to promote peace and understanding between those ""different"" from us.",1433289600,,151,5.08
8657766,5,B00KD64JDA,Extremely touching documentary on Arab-Jewish human engagement in historically critical Jaffa.,1420848000,,94,7.636363636363637
