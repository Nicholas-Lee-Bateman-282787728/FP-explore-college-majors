Wallace Beery could easily have been confined to minor character roles in hundreds of movies like so many other unusual-looking actors have been.  But he broke out and became the a leading man who was Hollywood's highest paid actor for a time.

I remember him from regular airings of his movies on a weekend ""Wallace Beery Theater"" during the '50's.  I learned to love the big lug then and my fondness for his broad acting has remained to this day.  Whether he was playing a western bandit, Long John Silver or Pancho Villa, he seemed to be playing the same person with the same mannerisms and vocal delivery.  I'm sure that rankled some movie fans, but for me it was like re-visiting a favorite uncle over and over - you know the one I mean - the one your mom always tried to steer you away from.

This made-on-demand ""Archive Collection"" DVD has a pretty clean picture with acceptable contrast.  The sound can be a little tinny, especially when the music wells up.

The film is presented here in the original theatrical aspect of 1.37:1 - a bit larger than the  standard TV ""Full Frame"" of 1.33:1.  It is nice to see that Warner has done this with many of their latest releases.  It may not seem like much, but where would you crop that much of your favorite work of art?",1471651200,,1357,4.38

7314342,4,B010N4GRKE,As Wallace Beery isn't to everyones taste this movie is dependant on liking him in the star role. Taking that into account I found this movie quite entertaining.,1440028800,,161,4.785714285714286
7314343,5,B010N4GRKE,"When I saw this movie on TV as a young boy I thought is was great film.  It is a great Western.  Wallace Berry is Bad Bascomb, the outlaw.  He and is gang rob a bank and things go sideways. J. Carrol Naish is badder than Bad Bascomb and kills a Mormon Missionary on his way to join a Mormon Wagon train headed to Utah. To escape the law, Berry and Naish join the Mormon Wagon train as recent converts to the faith.  There is no religious preaching in the movie and the Wagon train could have been any group of western Pioneers.  Margaret O'Sullivan is a young Mormon girl on the train and proves she was a great child actress, who still makes movies today. She becomes attached to Berry and he takes to her as the replacement for her dead grandfather, who was killed by Naish.  It turns out that the Mormons have some gold hidden on the train and the bad guys want it.  A young Marshall Thompson, a member of the gang also ends up on the wagon train, but he never wanted to be part of the gang and decides to join the pioneers, because he meets a young girl on the train.  The action is fun to watch and we get the typical settlers vs the Indians fight out with the Calvary coming to the rescue.  this is one of the few films made in that time period that does not have the stereotypical Mormon pioneers, who will not use guns and have many wives.  I still like this film.  If you like old westerns you should like this film.",1438992000,5,1425,4.1268115942028984

8722767,5,B010N4GRKE,"I enjoyed this movie a lot. I have a Margaret O'Brien collection and was glad to add this to it. The plot is rather standard and a bit predicable in places. It comes off as something of a vehicle for O'Brien and Beery. That's OK with me, though, since I love them both. After a bunch of rough bandit stuff at the beginning, Margaret's appearance hanging upside down from a covered wagon is quite stunning. What a talent she was!",1527638400,,428,4.3625
8722768,5,B010N4GRKE,I love Wallace Beery movies but little Margaret O Brien really steals the show.......,1516752000,,85,5.142857142857143

8722770,2,B010N4GRKE,I purchased this film for the wonderful cast of actors. Margaret O'Brien has got to be the greatest child actor of all time....maybe second only to Shirley Temple.,1500508800,,163,4.857142857142857
8722771,5,B010N4GRKE,I'd like to have many of Beery's films ( on disc ) but the prices are very prohibitive.,1499644800,,87,3.888888888888889

8722773,5,B010N4GRKE,"O'Brien is wonderful !  Great story.  Beery is something else, quite an actor in a delightful role.  Native Americans might object to having Mormons killing their guys surrounding the wagons, but an explanation is given for their error in attack.  Not many old movies do that.",1490572800,,276,4.934782608695652
