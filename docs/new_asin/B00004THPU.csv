As a fairly flexible 73-yr.-old woman, I find the stretching and the movements to be simple and no more of a challenge than I feel comfortable with. My body loves this Qigong, and I find its practice to be pleasant and satisfying.",1364947200,,381,4.787878787878788
8138358,5,B00004THPU,"If you have a busy schedule and you want a way to relax your mind and body either before your day begins or after your day ends, this is the tape for you.  If you want to learn about Qigong, definitely pick this one up.  With an excellent learning format, Garri and Daisy Lee do a superb job of teaching and demonstrating a sometimes difficult form of ""moving meditiation"" to learn.  If you've tried Yoga and wanted more, or if you're looking for a way to relax on a busy schedule, I strongly recommend you pick this one up - you won't regret it.",1025395200,17,546,4.230769230769231
