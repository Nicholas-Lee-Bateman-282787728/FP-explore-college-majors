4857546,4,B005PTYOTY,"Split Sessions is part of Kelly Coffey-Meyer's 30 Minutes to Fitness series.  It is the first DVD in the series since&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/30-Minutes-To-Fitness-Weights/dp/B00170C15O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">30 Minutes To Fitness: Weights</a>&nbsp;to offer split workouts for the upper and lower body.  In Split Sessions, Kelly adds use of additional equipment, including an incline bench for the upper body workout and a band for the lower body workout.  Sam and Lauren again join Kelly, with Lauren showing modifications for doing the exercises without the band or step.

The Main Menu of Split Sessions offers the following options:

Introduction
Warm-Up
Workout #1 (Upper Body)
Workout #2 (Lower Body)
Bonus Floorwork
Premixes
Credits
Music ON/OFF

Unlike with some of the other DVDs in the 30 Minutes to Fitness series, the warm-up does NOT need to be selected separately--i.e., it plays automatically when you select Workout #1, #2, or most of the premixes.  I have broken down each of the workout segments below.

WARM-UP (3.5 minutes)
Kelly begins the warm-up with some neck and shoulder rolls, then does a brief series of squats with a lunge back.  She adds in more traditional aerobic moves with a sequence of knee ups, front kicks, hamstring curls, and side-to-side steps.  She concludes with side-to-side lunges and a few deep breaths.

UPPER BODY (33.5 minutes)
Kelly performs this workout in rounds, and she is impressively using 15# dumbbells for most of the workout.  In each round, she completes two exercises, then returns and performs a second set of both.  The first round works the back/shoulders with rows and lying chest press:  for both, Kelly begins with single arm and then moves into double arm.  The next round continues to work the back/chest by alternating reverse flys (seated, leaning forward) and regular flys.  Continuing to work the back/chest, Kelly moves on to good mornings (holding a weight at the chest) and decline push-ups.  She then begins bicep tricep/work, first with a round of angled hammer curls/triceps kickbacks, then slow biceps curls/double arm overhead presses, and finally a seated side bicep curl/tricep dips.  The last section of the body worked is shoulders/waist.  Kelly starts with lateral raises and then performs standing side crunches.  Next she does one-armed shoulder presses followed by alternating standing crunches.  Finally, she finishes with upright rows and standing knee lift crunches.  The workout concludes with a quick 1-minute cool-down/stretch.

LOWER BODY (24 minutes)
Kelly opens this workout by performing standing moves with the band tied around the ankles.  Exercises include side-to-side steps, kicks to various angles, and knee lifts.  Kelly then takes off the band for weight work.  She beings with a tough one-legged leg press move.  Next comes a squat which adds a ""knee invert,"" or a twisting knee in, dropping toward the floor.  Another unique move follows, a side-to-side lunge which also involves moving the weights from side-to-side.  The final move in this series is a dead lift, adding a rock back on the heels.  Kelly then repeats the entire series, staring with the band work.  After the second round of deadlifts, she adds a few additional dynamic moves, including squats, lunge backs, plie squats, knee lifts, and back kicks.  A 1.5-minute cool-down/stretch concludes this workout.

BONUS FLOORWORK (16.5 minutes)
Kelly starts this segment on all 4s with the band around the ankles.  She continues with some seated band work designed to target the inner thighs, but these exercises felt awkward to me.  This section concludes with some crunches and a 1.5-minute cool-down/stretch.

This DVD also includes a number of premixes as listed below (I've included actual times in parentheses along with the times listed on the Premix menu).

Push (Triceps & Chest) Time 10:00 (9.5m)
Pull (Biceps & Back) Time 12:00 (11.5m)
Shoulders/Legs Time 16.00 (16m)
Upper Blitz (one set of all upper body) Time 22:00 (21m)
Lower Blast (one set of all lower body & floor bonus) Time 29:00 (29m)
Full Body Mix-In (alternating upper & lower body exercises) Time 50:00 (50m)
Full Body Time Saver (one set of alternating upper & lower body exercises) Time 35:00 (34m)

I purchased this DVD because I really enjoy Kelly's 30 Minutes to Fitness series in general and wanted to acquire another of her strength workouts in particular.  However, I have somewhat mixed feelings about this DVD.  As with all of Kelly's workouts, I think she does a great job overall, and I loved the addition of the band.  On the other hand, I didn't like how the lower body was split off into two separate workouts (e.g., Workout #2 and the bonus) rather than a single 30-minute lower body workout.  I was also disappointed that none of the band work was included in the Time Saver premix.  And finally, I would have preferred Kelly to skip use of the incline step, as she moves quite quickly between the upper body exercises, and having to use the step (or play around with an alternate) is a pain.  Still, there IS plenty to like about this DVD, and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it.",1333238400,19,5195,5.177458033573141
4857547,5,B005PTYOTY,"Here is another winner in Kelly Coffey-Meyer's 30 Minutes to Fitness series.  I have collected 10 of the 13 DVDs in the series and I just discovered them a year ago!

Peter has broken down this workout very well so I will just add my thoughts.  Both workouts are very good and thorough.  You work hard but there is no dread factor.  I really like the fact that I can get a great workout, whether it's upper or lower body in just a half hour.  I used to exercise more consistently but suffered from burn out and just stopped.  These workouts have helped me get back on track and I enjoy exercising again!

I really liked the bandwork in the lower body segment, I was feeling it and right away.  I normally don't work those muscles like that so they were really firing.  Thankfully by the time you have had your fill of the band work it's over, though it is repeated later on in the workout.  I do find myself modifying the lower body section a bit.  Kelly is known for adding unique variations to tried and true exercises.  They don't always work for me personally though.  So I just modify a little bit, for example I just do a static lunge in place of th leg press, a squat foot tap inward or squat heel lift in place of the squat/knee inversion, and instead of the deadlift/rock I just do a 4-4 count deadlift.  I do the other lower body exercises as presented.  I really like the side lunge exercise, I have never seen that in any other workout.

The upper body workout is very good also.  There are only a few exercises for each muscle group, but each are repeated and everything is hit well.  A lot is accomplished in 30 minutes.  I found myself doing the waist exercises without weights though, just a personal preference.  Kelly does use weights for these but I skipped it.

Once again, there are premix options for those to choose from, they have already been laid out nicely in the previous review.

Lauren is also back with modifications, she does a great job as always.  As does Kelly, I really enjoy exercising with her, she just my speed and motivates me to keep at it.  She has become one of my favorite instructors in a very short time.

Well done Kelly! 5 stars!",1326585600,13,2178,4.355721393034826
4857548,5,B005PTYOTY,"[Please note that Amazon lists this DVD as two separate products.  Both DVDs are the same and both display the same cover, with Kelly Coffey-Meyer wearing a top with a white towel draped around her neck.  In one DVD, the top is red and in the other DVD, the top is orange red.  Again, please keep in mind that both are the same.]

Ms. Coffey-Meyer presents two workouts which use medium (or slightly heavier) dumbbells.  These workouts are done gym-style, so Ms. Coffey-Meyer moves steadily from one dumbbell exercise to another for fairly intense workouts.  I especially enjoyed doing the excellent upper body workout.

In both workouts, Ms. Coffey-Meyer works with two other ladies.  Choose a pair of dumbbells appropriate for your exercise level.  A decline step and band are recommended as additional equipment, but I did not use them.

Warm-up (3:34) is the same for both workouts.

# 1 Upper Body Workout (33:30) Five stars.  This is excellent.  A decline step is optional.

# 2 Lower Body Workout (24:10) Four stars.  My knees hurt after this workout, but the next day, I felt fine.  A decline step and band are optional.

4857550,5,B005PTYOTY,"I have tons of fitness dvds and work out at home 5-6 days per week.  Kelly is one of my favorites - I love the 30 minute format.  She's second only to Cathe in my book, but I would actually put this particular one ahead of most Cathe dvds.  I have had trouble finding one that challenges my legs enough to get them to look more sculpted.  This lower body portion may be short, but don't let the length fool you - it does the trick better than any other dvd I have - even ones that are specifically for the legs.  It's very efficient and has no dread factor, and I was definitely sore for a couple of days, and I hardly ever get sore anymore.  Another great one by Kelly.",1438128000,10,670,4.037878787878788

4857552,5,B005PTYOTY,"This video is perfect for me.  I like Kelly Coffey Meyer's other weight videos, but I have bad knees that can't handle squats and lunges, and she tends to alternate upper body and lower body so I was always having to skip forward to avoid the leg exercises.  So, the upper body portion of this video worked great for me, and I love--really love--the bonus section with the resistance band because it works the hips and legs, so I'm still able to get some lower body workout.",1428278400,8,474,4.436781609195402

4857558,5,B005PTYOTY,"There is absolutely nothing negative about these workouts.  For 30 minutes (or more if you choose) you can feel the burn from these paced workouts for Kelly.  I bought 3 of her videos and love them all.  If you want a bang for your buck, you cannot go wrong here.  Kelly delivers!",1395100800,,280,4.326923076923077
4857559,2,B005PTYOTY,"I really do love Kelly's strength dvds but this just seemed so dull and had serious dread factor to do it again. I highly recommend her dvds-Muscle Definition,Circuit Burn,BodyShop,NYC and Plateau Buster. I just could not get into this workout",1393286400,,243,5.1
4857566,5,B005PTYOTY,"This workout focuses on using heavier dumbbells (Kelly uses 15's and 12's) with less reps. A resistance band is also used, but I don't care for those and just do alternate moves. I've only done it about 4 times now and have gone from struggling with 8 lbs to using 15 lbs on about half the workout... So I know it's working to grow some muscles! It's not a HIIT workout, which is fine with me. I am training for some distance running and the HIIT workouts don't really fit into that. This workout is building strength so far, and I've seen an improvement in my running.",1392768000,,569,4.327102803738318

4857569,5,B005PTYOTY,"I was looking for just a weight lifting video as I am a runner so I get plenty of cardio. I didn't want to do another grueling session of P90X, just something a bit less intense. This work out is perfect. It is challenging, the instructor is quite likeable, and I feel I am getting the results I desire in the time frame that fits into my lifestyle. I would highly recommend this video.",1379116800,3,386,4.22972972972973

4857572,4,B005PTYOTY,"I love this video; I just wish that I didn't need so much equipment to do some of the moves. The video shows you what you can do instead of using the equipment. I like the moves that go w/ the equipment, so It's kind of a tease to show me great moves and then not be able to do them correctly (unless I go on a shopping trip to the gym isle). But that's no reason to stray from this video, it's a good one whether you have all, some or none of the equipment. There are many work out combinations to choose from.",1363132800,2,511,3.876190476190476
4857573,5,B005PTYOTY,"The other reviews break down the actual workout pretty well, so I will just add some general thoughts.  I have been doing exercise videos for 20 years and Kelly Coffey Meyer has become one of my favorite instructors.  I love her laid back yet motivating style and her sense of humor.  It is great to be able to do both workouts or one depending on your schedule and workout rotation.  I run, so it is nice to be able to concentrate solely on the upper body on days when I am not running.  It is easy to adjust the workout (with variations or lighter/heavier weights) depending on your fitness level and I know that I will be able to use this video for a long time.  The exercises move quickly and the variety of moves keeps things interesting.  The cool-down/stretch section is quite short, so I often supplement with more stretching.",1357516800,6,834,4.483443708609271
4857574,5,B005PTYOTY,I found this video to be a great workout and I think Kelly is very motivating and inspirational. I think if you want a real workout this is a video for you.,1353283200,,156,3.90625
4857575,5,B005PTYOTY,"I was really enjoying this workout, as an intermediate exerciser it was challenging yet doable.  I had to modify the weights for some portions because of a shoulder injury, but not too much.  You move quickly from one exercise to the next so make sure you clear a space and have all your equipment close at hand.  Halfway though the waist portion the dvd froze... I took it out and looked at it.  What Amazon sold me as new was used and extremely scratched.  This was an absolute first from what I considered a very trusted site.  So sad I have to return and wait to get another one.  It was my Mother's day gift :(",1337904000,6,615,4.25
8482669,5,B005PTYOTY,This is great if you want to concentrate on either arms or legs.  Wonderful 30 minute workouts for those that don't have a lot of time.  Really like the mixes in the DVD for a more rounded quick workout.,1529712000,,203,4.17948717948718

I get bored easily so I have over 100 different workout DVD's (bought over time of course), some step, step boxing, cardio, weights, palates you name it I got it :-)  but I find myself coming back to this more often than others.  I have about 15 Kelly DVDs and this is her best workout in my opinion.  Just straight up weight lifting when that's what you want to do.  Some of her other weight videos have too many cardio segments in between and not enough weight lifting.  I really love this DVD I've had it for a few years and It's still my go to  DVD, when I  want to feel the burn!! And the music is good also.",1497571200,,650,4.0234375

I went heavy on the weights, and almost no workout leaves my legs sore, but my legs and entire body are pleasantly sore today. I have NEVER believed in any workout that includes ""standing ab"" work, as it always seems like a waste of time. Not in this dvd; my abs and obliques hurt today.

8482675,4,B005PTYOTY,"This is a great workout that I initially thought I wouldn't like.  What changed my mind was how my body felt after a workout that I initially thought was too easy.  I use a variety of home exercise tapes, Cathe, Jillian, Jackie, Amy Dixon, Jari Love etc.  and never felt my biceps, back, or inner thighs the way I did with this tape.  She does an excellent job getting at these muscles which I feel are often overlooked by other home trainers.  She is perhaps the only one I have used that doesn't overwork the triceps (which is one reason I like her so much).  I deducted a star only because some of her exercises require a dedicated attention to form.  If you are a beginner who has not worked with a personal trainer or been taught how to do the exercise correctly you could harm yourself.  Exercises of specific concern are the squat into a deadlift, into a lunge which she alternates, the leg press, and the squat with inversion.  She gives excellent warnings with these exercises but it is all to easy to lose form with some of the complex exercises if you are new to exercising at home.  Otherwise she is a fantastic no-nonsense trainer who lets you know that she expects you to lift heavy to get anything from her workouts.  If you do you won't be disappointed.",1458864000,3,1269,4.426724137931035
8482676,5,B005PTYOTY,"I like that this workout is separated into upper and lower.  You can do them together or separate.  I especially love the lower workout, it works out all the leg muscles.",1442275200,,170,4.451612903225806
8482677,4,B005PTYOTY,"30 Minutes to Fitness has become my ""go to"" workout choice. This is the second one I've purchased and I really like both of them--better than Jillian and Bob Harper. Between the standard work outs and the pre-mixes, there is a lot to choose from. I used to be a gym rat and thought I had to spend at least an hour on my workouts to make them count. I got sick of paying for memberships and got myself dumbbells and a chin bar. That's it, no bench or barbells. Going the video route will not make power lifters happy, or anyone else who desires machines that can handle hundreds of pounds. I think I have given up some overall strength this way, but I am still lean, toned, and I feel great. There is nothing fancy in her videos. They are easy to follow, move pretty quickly, and do not bore me. She does use an aerobic step in the upper body routine, but in an incline position. An incline/decline bench would work. I am going to experiment with a stability ball in place of a step or bench. All can be done with no equipment, but the bench or step adds difficulty.",1441497600,2,1065,4.2254901960784315
