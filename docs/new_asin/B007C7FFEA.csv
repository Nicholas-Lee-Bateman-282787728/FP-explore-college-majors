5076836,2,B007C7FFEA,"I use to by opera BD and DVDs from many countries, all region code free. I do not understand why this BD is restrict to region A. Opera lovers are usually international minded people and so the consumers.",1334793600,7,204,4.394736842105263
5076837,5,B007C7FFEA,"This is an easy review!  WOW says it all in a nut shell.  Opera Australia is on a roll: LAKME, TRAVIATA, RIGOLETTO and DON GIOVANNI. All creative, beautiful, colorful and vocally and musically excellent and most of the times more.  Not always flawless; but always fascinating and engaging.  Many times I'm almost fooled into believing ""this is the first time I've experienced this piece"" or WOW is that new!
1)  Emma Matthews-Lakme.  She is the real thing a lyric coloratura soprano who has it all: Stunning high E in the Bell Song, Runs, Staccatti, Beautiful Tone, Breath. Legato, Phrasing etc...  Did I mention she can act and looks good too!
2) Aldo Di Toro-Gerald has a lovely tenore di grazia; It's a shame he can't act. BUT, he can sing!
3) Great music direction by Emmanuel Joel-Hornak; and wonderful playing by the Australian Opera and Ballet Orchestra.
4) Fine directing by Roger Hodgman.  He treats it as a lovely lyric piece of oriental fluff and doesn't try to make it something it isn't.
5) Having now reviewed TRAVIATA, RIGOLETTO, DON GIOVANNI and the present LAKME I find some common threads of themes running throughout all of them:  COLOR is used creatively and boldly in both Sets and Costumes.  Audio is excellent.  Camera work is top tier.  The Video director doesn't seem to feel the need to change the angle every four or five seconds as in most of the current MET HD Broadcasts.  Close ups are not extreme and hyper in the artists face.  The long broad shot is not feared or rejected as being thought to be boring!  All is done artistically and with great care and taste.
6)Stephen Bennett as Nilakantha does not have easy high notes; but, he is dramatically involved.
7) I was not impressed with Luke Gabbedy as Frederic.  His voice lacks focus and he doesn't act but is always staring at the Conductor.
8) The English trio of ladies: Jane Parkin, Angela Brun and Roxane Hislop couldn't be better.
9) Dominica Matthews is also an asset as Malika; especially in the beautiful flower duet.
10) A drop dead georgeous score, orchestration and soaring melodies by an often time ignored French composer - Leo Delibes.
11) This excellent production is a true feast for eye and ear presented by a company who is making its artistic presence felt.  I wish them well because no matter how creative or innovative the production they steer clear of Reggie or Trash and manage to stay true to the Libretto, the Music and The Composer.
12) Emma Matthews a local talent trained and developed by Opera Australia HAS ARRIVED as Blu-Ray, DVD and a new recital album on DGG prove beyond a shadow of a doubt.  I look forward to seeing how her career progresses and develops.  I also look forward to more Colorful and Creative releases from OPERA AUSTRALIA.  BRAVI TUTTI!!!
13) Just a suggestion.  Maybe a creative and well directed LUCIA OR PURITANI next?",1351900800,5,2859,4.712273641851106
5076838,1,B007C7FFEA,"Realmente me llama mucho la atencion los comentarios de los usuarios con respecto a los aspectos tecnicos de este blu ray. La imagen es muy buena (4,5/5) pero el sonido al menos en mi copia es realmente muy malo (1/5)sonido plano,sin brillo ni armonicos,las voces un poco mejor pero en general muy lejos del promedio de cualquier blu ray,para dar un ej. se encuentra a aos luz de ""Adriana Lecouvrer"" (Decca) o Mahler 8(Accentus).En cuanto al elenco las cosas mejoran sobre todo por Emma Mathews,no se si en el futuro comprare titulos de la Opera de Australia por lo arriba mecionado.",1350259200,3,583,4.782178217821782
5076839,5,B007C7FFEA,"That Leo Delibes was an important and successful composer of ballet is well established. His 1870s ballets Sylvia and Coppelia are among the masterpieces of ballet music noted for charm, wit and brilliance of orchestration. They compare favorable with the master of that era, Tchaikovsky. Delibes place as an opera composer is less secure. He began as a church organist before he entered the world of the theater. In time he became chorus master at the Opera Paris, then wrote ballets and a series of successful operettas in the Jaques Offenbach style. There followed a few operas of which only one lasted but it was worldly very popular for about 50 years. Yet even in this long lasting opus the prelude, duets and even the discriptive oriental background music sounds like bits anf pieces of operetta. His melodies and orchestrations are its high points. The alternating slow melodic lines with fast paced more dramatic material keeps interest and attention going. And the solid choral work in this opera shows off the chorus master background.
The libretto by Gondinet and Gille is typical of French romanticism of the time. Philippe Gille had also contributtred to another popular French libretto of the 1880s for Massenet's Manon. In Lakme the story is taken fron a novel by Pierre Loti called ""The Mariage of Loti"". Interestingly that story was set in the South Pacific but the libretto team aware of the current vogue in France for ""Orientalia"" set it in present day (British) India. It allowed them a French pleasure of depicting the British as amusing button-down foolish Victorians and the soldiers are right out of comic operetta. The story line in Lakme is thin at best and is only saved by the quality of Delibes music.
The present production is about as authentic and fulfilling you could have today. The staging is vibrant, full of color, mood and people and a full realization of the score. The Lakme of Emma Mathews is magnificent. She even looks authentic Indian. Her voice is not the Lakme of Lily Pons but is on par with the only Joan Sutherland I've heard. Ms Pons I saw when young and her Bell Song still rings in my mind in spite of the dust, cobwebs and moths of the very old Met sets. Stephen Bennett brings gravity to the role of Nilakantha, the high priest and Lakme's father. In the hands of a greater composer and librettist this could have become a great tragic figure. But he does a very good job with what he has. Gerald should be handsome, yound and of soldier-like figure. Aldo di Toro could sing it but his pot-belly and short stature were detrimental. The rest of the cast were excellent in their roles; especially the Malika of Dominica Mathews and the Mistress Bentson of Roxanne Hislop. An excellent and enjoyable gem of late French romanticism in music; highly recommended. A final note: two heroines of that period died botanical deaths. Lakme in Lakme and Selika in Meyerbeer's L'Africain; despite it's title is about India Indians. Lakme's plant appears to be a type of Datura or Brugsmania it is toxic but not instantly. Selika's flowers have a deadly aroma and are called Mancanilla but their true identity remains unknown.",1347580800,11,3168,4.814678899082569
5076840,5,B007C7FFEA,I have enjoyed watching this opera. It was a good quality performance. I enjoyed seeing it on Blue Ray. It was worth of money.,1346976000,2,126,4.291666666666667
5076841,4,B007C7FFEA,"There aren't many versions of this beautiful opera on DVD and, as far as I know, this is the only one on BluRay.  Waiting for it was worthwhile although this production is not exceptional.  The big surprise is Emma Matthews, she acts and she signs beautifully. The famous duet of Lakme and Malika is a treat, as well as the Bell Song. The rest of the cast is OK but not thrilling. This is filmed in front of a live audience, so some of the scenes look not so great in terms of illumination. The settings correspond to the composer and librettist ideas and are a delight to watch. Overall, a very nice experience worth buying the BlueRay version. I just hope other Opera houses will stage and record Lakme in the near future.",1340755200,3,724,4.395522388059701
5076842,5,B007C7FFEA,"With reference to one of the reviews posted here, please be advised that Lakme plays in all regions A,B and C.",1339459200,4,110,4.285714285714286
5076843,4,B007C7FFEA,"I'm inclined to be generous having waited so long for a production of Lakme in full screen with high-resolution picture and sound.  For the most part, I'm not disappointed.  Emma Mattthews is petite and attractive, with a glorious, note-perfect coloratura.  The sets are quite nice combined with thoughtful touches of stage craft.  Much attention to authenticity in the costumes adds a sense of beauty and realism.

However, the ballet sequences, so appealing in the earlier Sutherland version, have been totally excised.  Also, the acting, casting on the part of the male lead, Gerald (Aldo di Toro) is dismal.  He has a lovely voice, but he acts as though he happened to pass by and was asked to come on stage to sing with no thought, preparation whatsoever.  He might be forgiven in the sense that the story of Lakme and Gerald falling in love with no prelude, no development is itself pretty thin.  But all the more need for thoughtful direction in making the most of this scene, which doesn't happen.

Frederic (Luke Gabeddy)was not much better, but his role was not as critical.  In contrast, all the woman look and act quite well.

So, highly recommended for all that is beautiful and right about this production, but be prepared for that which is missing.",1338508800,14,1263,4.823255813953488
5076844,5,B007C7FFEA,"Leo Delibes, a late nineteenth century French composer most well known today for two ballets, the effervescent Copplia and the bucolic Sylvia, and two numbers from his only opera still in the repertory.  One of these is a duet for two women, immortalized in film in Tony Scotts 1983 The Hunger, and it is without a doubt the most sensuous duet of it kind this side of Venus, for love and loyalty is what it is about.  In the opera it is sung by a princess and her slave; and it is thus in Tony Scott's movie, though in the film it is heard on the soundtrack while a vampire queen played by Catherine Deneuve seduces scientist Susan Sarandon.  The other number in the opera is Lakme's scintillating and impossibly difficult ""Bell Song"" (O va la jeune Hindoue?).  A coloratura showpiece, in the hands (!) of a Mado Robin or Lily Pons, it is a marvel.  I can't say why but I really didn't think Miss Matthews would pull it off.  But she's rather good, despite that she's older and more robust than I imagine the character.

The first thing we notice about this video after an initial concern that our projector bulb is on the way out - turns out things brighten soon after Lakme makes her entrance - is the remarkable restraint demonstrated by the video director, Cameron Kirkpatrick.  Right from the outset, he allows the camera to linger and pull back some to include a relevant supporting character in the shot. Remarkably, there are relatively few extreme close-ups.  It takes a moment to get one's bearings, so used we are to rapid cutting.  Reds and greens especially are deeply saturated, popping nicely when spotlit.  Backgrounds remain dark, almost to the point of crush.  Not a fault of the transfer, I'm guessing this is merely the result of stage lighting that works better for the theater audience than for the limited contrast range of the video sensor.

The orchestra is rich and dynamic, mostly directed forward than to the sides, even in the surround mix (as is my preference), so extra high marks here. The voices are liquid and unrestrained and unstrained with a little less of the usual projected-from-the-stage presence that we usually get in opera high-definition surround.  The soprano duet in the first act and the Bell Song are ripe and far from anemic.  The chorus never threatens to overwhelm; if anything, I could have enjoyed a little more presence from them.  As for the singers, I have already remarked on our heroine.  Aldo Di Toro's Gerald gets off to a tentative start, too thin and unsteady for a soldier, but soon gets his footing and remains in full voice for the rest of the opera - though tenors singing in French almost always sound reedier than in any other language to me.  I don't much care for Stephen Bennett's Nilakantha - he's the only weak member of the cast - not nearly authoritative or characterful enough. Luke Gabbedy's Frederic is in command of a warm bass that doesn't threaten Gerald as the dominant, if hopelessly misguided male.  Roxane Hislop's Mistress Benson is a comic delight.  And Dominica Matthews' warm mezzo blends beautifully with Emma Matthews in their loving duet.

The main bonus feature is a six or seven minute segment featuring stage director Roger Hodgman, who talks about how he approached his presentation of Lakm given its being based on an earlier production.  He adds some relevant comments about the opera and its history.  A Cast Gallery rounds off this rather anemic collection of bonus features.

Despite the light menu of bonus features, this Blu-ray from Australia gets very high marks: the singing cast, with only one exception, is very good; the sets and costumes are sumptuous and screen filling; the audio clear, well-balanced, and dynamic; the high bit rate helps realize all those bold colors; and the video direction is, for a change, relaxed.  Lakm is a curious piece.  It remains intimate despite its tableau-rich staging.  It looks big, but sounds small - something like Mozart's Abduction from the Seraglio.  It's easy on the ears and pleasant to look at.  Warmly recommended.",1336348800,32,4070,4.7908309455587395

Audiences in Europe have had few opportunities to see OA productions until now, so the realization that so much wonderful music-making takes place in Australia was a ""very, very pleasant surprise"" as one of our seasoned American opera-goers and regular Jury member says in our ""Video Crits"". Now that these productions are coming out on Blu-Ray we will at last be able to enjoy more of their performances. If they are all up to the standard of ""Lakm"" we have quite an operatic feast to look forward to!

The lavish sets and gorgeous costumes got a special mention from several people on the Jury. It was also a joy to see more long shots than we invariably do in most other operas on disc. The sharpness of the high definition image makes this possible and gives a greater impression of ""being there"" (no doubt why some 60% of the Jury felt that this HD experience was ""better than"" or ""significantly better than"" actually attending a live performance! The remainder judged it comparable with the real thing).

One of the French Jury members was a retired first violinist who has played in performances of Lakm at the Paris and Lyon operas. He too was amazed at the quality of the OA production, greatly admiring the staging and singling out the orchestral playing and Aldo Di Toro's clear tenor voice for special mention.
However, the greatest, unequivocal and most generous praise was of course for Emma Matthews. She was a discovery for everyone. And what a discovery! She is so believable as Lakm and sings with such purity, clarity and (apparently) effortless command of her amazing voice. She brought tears to the eyes of quite a few Jury members with the famous coloratura showpiece aria the ""Bell Song"" which, combined with her radiant smile and authentic Indian gestures, was a moment of sheer delight.

This was a very memorable evening for everyone, with 90% of the Jury saying they would like to see the production again in the cinema, nearly 80% saying they would add this disc to their own collections and 95% saying they would recommend it to their family and friends!

A few of the Jury members - including the three Australians we had with us that evening - regretted not being shown any shots of the iconic Sydney Opera House where this performance was filmed. It would have given an even greater sense of ""occasion"" they felt... And be a proud statement of where all this is coming from!

5076846,5,B007C7FFEA,"The DVD of Opera Australia's LAKME is just superb. The title role is sung by Emma Matthews...who not only sings the lyric portions beautifully...but knocks it out of the park with the ""Bell Song"". The aria is notoriously difficult...but Ms Matthews makes it sound so effortless...high E's and all. The rest of the cast is also wonderful and the production is beautiful.

8514242,5,B007C7FFEA,"This production goes a very long way to prove that there is a lot more to Lakm than the ever popular Flower Duet, rather it is a beautiful depiction of a story of love, honour and duty. The story is set in nineteenth century India and revolves around the love between Gerald, an English army officer, and the beautiful Lakm, the daughter of a Brahmin priest, and how he will eventually reject his love in order to fulfil his duty to his regiment and his English fianc.
This is a beautiful production by Roger Hodgman, sumptuous in its staging and its costumes, which has the intimacy of a theatrical production, which is not surprising given Hodgmans record in the theatre, it is highly colourful a decorative, this is a masterpiece of opera staging. Beautifully sung, Emma Matthews is well cast in the vocally demanding title role; her voice is well balanced with Aldo Di Toro, whos slightly nasally intonation is ideal in the role of Gerald as it has the feel of the great French operatic tenors of days gone by. Emma Matthewss voice is also in perfect balance with that of Dominica Matthews in the role of Malika, with whom she performs that famous bit of the opera. Indeed, the whole opera is well cast and well balanced, this production comes over as a real ensemble piece and one which the whole cast give strong performances. The chorus and orchestra are also on top form and give excellent support to the soloists.
It is interesting to watch the production in light of the interview with Roger Hodgman, when he talks of Delibes own, and indeed the French in general, animosity towards the English at the time of the operas composition, and how the scenes of which revolve solely around the English characters are given somewhat of a music hall feel. I cant help but feel however, that the Australian Hodgman continues this, and even goes further in the way that he portrays the stitched-up British blundering their way through the Empire! This in no way detracts from the opera however, rather it adds to the tensions portrayed between the locals and the ruling British.
My only slight reservation, and it is only slight, is that I seem to remember there being a section of ballet music in the opera, this is sadly missing, but it doesnt really add to the story anyway, so it can be missed out without determent to the story.
This is an excellent production of this opera, one which should win new converts to this fine work, highly recommended!",1400544000,,2453,4.654377880184332
8514243,5,B007C7FFEA,"Ill start by admitting that French-style opera is not my first choice and Lakm will never make my top 10 operas. French opera just never seems to develop those magnificent and soaring arias, which we typically find in Italian, even Wagnerian, opera.

 Nonetheless, given the limitations of the score, it was well sung, properly costumed and correctly staged. Emma Matthews and Aldo Di Toro are a bit old for the parts of Lakm and Gerald but, as Ive said, in other reviews, there aren't any late teen or early 20s sopranos or tenors around, to better fill those types of roles.

 Its a simple story of an ethnically-prohibited and religiously-forbidden love, between the late teen/early twenties daughter of an anti-British, Hindu high priest and a young, British, army officer. Of course, in the end, she commits suicide, knowing he is returning to his regiment, after which he marches off to war, against her people.

 Those familiar with the history of the era will already know that it was common practice, for British officers, to secretly maintain middle- or upper-caste, Indian mistresses and for enlisted men to marry lower-caste, Indian women.

 If you like French opera, this is the production of Lakm to get. Its the best Ive seen.",1391385600,2,1241,4.9326923076923075
8514244,5,B007C7FFEA,"Well done -- Emma Matthews and Aldo di Toro are super!
I love it so much I bought 2 copies!  The setting is India, and the costuming alone is worth seeing--incredible!",1378339200,2,167,4.387096774193548
8514245,5,B007C7FFEA,"The opera Lakme doesn't get staged very often. The score by Delibes is good but
lacks the drama, contrast and hard-hitting impact of Verdi, Puccini, and Wagner.
Nor do we hear the catchy tunes of Bizet. The plot is acceptable, we get some
 violence and the title character dies at the end. What sets this opera apart is
the exotic location (India).

The costumes of the Indians are simply gorgeous. These appear to be higher caste
Indians. We see many colors. The English costumes appear reasonably accurate for
that era. The English ladies where large floppy hats and the men are mostly in uniform.
The sets are very fine and capture the atmosphere of India. I find no
fault with the orchestra or conducting.

The cast is of a high standard. I could find no fault with the singing. Even the
 tricky coloratura passage sung by Lakme is clear. There is no excessive vibrato
from any of the singers. I'm not familiar with this opera and I have never seen
it before but I sense that the acting is quite good. Lakme and Mallika are both
physically attractive women. This makes the romantic aspect more convincing for
me. As another reviewer mentioned, the Gerald character is not the most dashing
young army officer. I was hoping Lakme would hookup with the taller, more slender
English officer Frederic. Nilakantha, the high priest comes off as deadly serious,
even somewhat creepy. If you like the Grand Inquisitor in Don Carlo you will like
this high priest.

Tecnical aspects of this release are excellent. Picture and sound quality are high.
The opera runs slightly over two hours and there is a short extra with the director.
This is a FIVE STAR performance of a 3 or 4 star opera. Opera Australia
has a winner here. Highly recommended.",1364774400,17,1738,4.703947368421052
