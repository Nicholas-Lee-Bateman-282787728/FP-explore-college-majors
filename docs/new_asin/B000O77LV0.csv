8183553,1,B000O77LV0,"It would be handy to know what's in this collection.  Randolph Scott is a fairly large category.  Are the films westerns - or comedies - or war films?
The buyers should be informed of this.",1215129600,5,189,4.371428571428571
8183554,5,B000O77LV0,"At first I didn't know there were four movies in tne pack, so I was pleasantly surprised I got so many movies for so little money. I've always been a fan of Randolph Scott and I specially like his western and war movies. Long time ago here in my country (Spain) TV stations used to broadcast this type of movies quite often, but now they're rarely shown. It is also difficult to find them on DVD; you mostly find low quality copies. But this pack gives very good image and sound quality despite the age of the movies.",1212192000,13,517,4.285714285714286
8183555,4,B000O77LV0,"Never will you find someone more poetically stylizing the american cowboy than Randoph Scott. Always carrying a smile which was as quick as his draw he would rather think than fight for resolving situations. Whether in black or white or in color when you pick up a Scott western you know you are delivered a fine ride filled with romping good adventure, shoot em-ups, laughter, down home lovin'and morality that isn't slap you in the face or hit you over the head! Yeeeehaw! Whatever happened to Randolph Scott indeed? He continues embodying what a true american and every man should strive for being...be assured ANY Randolph Scott movie is pure entertainment!",1197244800,12,661,4.963963963963964
