4112089,3,B003DUBAWG,"These are all wonderful romances....I have seen them all-- and own them-- on VHS, but wanted to get them on DVD to share with my teenage daughter. When I first received the movies and opened the box, I thought that they mistakenly only sent 1 movie. I was just ready to report it when my daughter took it out of the box, and discovered ALL 4 DISKS STACKED IN THE BOX! I've purchased multiple-movie box DVD's before, even some of the 4 Film Favorites collections. This is the only one I've received which has 4 separate disks in 1 disk holder case! Not even a 2 disk holder case!  I appreciate the fact that the movies are not double-sided, as most multi-film packs are-- although they are at least packaged in multi-disk boxes. However, I can't seem to figure the genius behind stuffing them all together in 1 spot!  Hello, scratches!  Luckily I had some extra cases and used the artwork from the vhs boxes but really--- had I purchased them used I may have been less annoyed.  But for brand-new in the box movies, I would at least expect 4 disks to be placed in 4 separate spots. Perhaps I'm being too picky. It was a good deal for 4 films, but still....",1315008000,33,1155,4.383177570093458

4112109,5,B003DUBAWG,"These 4 love stories have romantic sparks throughout, and entertain from start to finish. This is a great deal to add to a collection of love stories at a reasonable price. The intriguing stories keep your attention, and acting performance in all 4 films is good. My favorite is Message In A Bottle, but we enjoyed the other 3 as well. Romantic, entertaining, and highly recommended!",1427155200,2,383,4.818181818181818

4112118,2,B003DUBAWG,"False advertising.  If you get the three-disc set it does NOT include a widescreen version of Sommersby as listed on the package.

Reading other reviews, it sounds like this is a mix of different packaging - some got four discs, others got three with one double-sided (like mine).  Personally, I don't mind the stacked DVDs but what I DO mind VERY MUCH is that they are NOT all WIDESCREEN movies.  This really matters to me.  Both ""The Lake House"" and ""Message in a Bottle"" are 16x9 widescreen and these are on separate, labelled discs.  ""Forever Young"" and ""Sommersby"" are 4x3 standard on a single, double-sided disc.  The back of the DVD case CLEARLY states ""Sommersby"" is ""Widescreen [16x9 2.4:1]"" but that is NOT what the disc holds.  (It does state ""Forever Young"" is ""Full-screen"" and that is correct.)

I suspect that those which receive the four-disc set may actually get what the package states.",1411776000,7,904,4.818181818181818

4112123,5,B003DUBAWG,"Four great movies with great chemistry between the actors and actresses in the lead roles. Still, I think an opportunity was lost here. If I were choosing films to group, I'd have built a ""Timeless Romance Collection"" by substituting ""The Time Traveler's Wife"" and ""Somewhere In Time"" as companions to ""The Lake House"" and ""Forever Young"".

In another set I have, the movies all end with a death or deaths (tragedy is fine as long as one isn't subjected to a steady diet of it) -- I'm pleased to report this was only half-true of this set. After all, I'm a believer in the ""happily ever after"" aspect of a love story and tend to shy away from movies of the ""it's better to have loved and lost"" variety. That said, having the option to choose one or the other stands out as a plus for this set.",1368144000,,793,4.358108108108108
4112124,4,B003DUBAWG,"Four romantic movies on 3 DVDs is a good purchase.  I was happy to finally find Forever Young on DVD along with Message In A Bottle included.  Somersby is a great movie with Jodie foster and Richard Gere. I had never seen The Lake House but enjoyed seeing it.

PS: If you insert a sheet of DVD cloth in between the discs you will prevent scratches.",1366243200,2,348,4.242424242424242
4112125,4,B003DUBAWG,"There are a total of three DVD's.  Message in a Bottle and The Lake House are on separate DVD's, but Sommersby and Forever Young are on opposite sides of one DVD, and this one DVD is not labelled - you have to guess what you are watching.

8394961,1,B003DUBAWG,This packet was supposed to contain 4 movies.  Message in a Bottle and the Lake House came as expected labeled and looking as they should.  Forever Young was on side 1 of third disk with out the label looking like an illegal disk. Somersby was on side 2 of third disk without a label looking like a bootleg copy. Shame on you for letting this kind of low quality work go out.. Where is the pride you should be taking in your work.  I will be careful about buying multi disk packs from now on.,1516406400,,492,4.157894736842105
