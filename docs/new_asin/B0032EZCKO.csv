8387467,5,B0032EZCKO,"I was SO excited to be able to buy this for my dad last year!!! It was the perfect gift for a man who doesn't like presents! Haha  He was born and bred in Argentina and grew up with these cartoons (and, in turn, so did I). Was so happy to be able to purchase him our favorite ""Larguirucho"" movie in the States! The DVD itself is very simple, which was great for him because it's so easy to use. Just pop it in and watch your movie. Hope this comes back in stock as I would love to be able to repurchase for myself! Would also love to have a selection of other Argentine cartoons from the 60s. Thank you for helping my ""papi"" and I to relive HAPPY childhood memories!",1480896000,,666,4.045454545454546
