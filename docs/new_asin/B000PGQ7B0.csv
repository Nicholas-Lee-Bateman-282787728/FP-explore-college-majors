8655236,5,B000PGQ7B0,"It is very hard to find Duniya featuring Dev Anand and Vayjayathimala on online for sale. The DVD was of excellent quality
Of all the all time great movies of Dev Anand, wherein comes the name of HumDono,Guide,Jhonny Mera Nam, Jewel Thief, Duniya can also be added as an excellent story and acting from Dev Anand.
Otherwise DevAnand acts good in only those movies where his younger brother Vijay Anand( Goldie) is the director.
As Indians all know how an excellent actor Balraj Shani is and giving him a compitition is a great thing and Dev Anand did it here.
The music was excellently scored by Shankar Jaikishen as usual. Shankar-Jaikishen actually are the pioneer of making the Hindi Film music sounds great.
It was SJ who changed the dynamics of the music  of Hindi Cinema. Before SJ came, it was all sorrowful songs , like jab dil hi tott gaya , hum jike kya karenge by K L Saigal  or Mera Sundar Sapna Beet gaya....by Geeta Dutt. and many more ......it was a sorrowful joureny of Songs created by Music Dir. Like they never laughed at all in their life.
But SJ bring the change. Like Barasaat mein  Tak dhina dhin, Hawa mein udta jaye mera lal dupatta malmal ka........
They ruled the 50's and 60's .....untill Mera Nam Joker. There was one time, SJ were given more renumeration for giving music then the Picture Hero. The name of Music Dir , Shankar-Jaikishen was written in much bigger letters then the Hero name on the advertisement board.
Coming back to Duniya, I love that movie, The acting of Balraj Sahani, Dev Anand and ofcourse Vayjanthumala.
Worth a movie to be seen with excellent numbers from Rafisab like Phalsafa Pyar ka tum kya jano, Kishore Asha duet, Dooriya Nazakiyan ban gayi etc but my favourite is Phalsafa Pyar ka tum kya jano......",1389657600,,1760,4.634615384615385
