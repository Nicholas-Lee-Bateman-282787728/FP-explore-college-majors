8703609,4,B00TZL6Y1E,"I picked up this blu-ray recently while on vacation in Japan. From what I understand this documentary by NHK was shown on TV in Japan. The film focuses on John Lasseter and the making of the Disney film ""Big Hero 6"". While skimming through the film it seems they spend time on Pixar and John's relationship with Steve Jobs, Hayao Miyazaki and others.

English speaking individuals please note! This disc ONLY has 1 audio track and it is Japanese. This disc also contains no subtitles in Japanese or English. Only some Japanese subtitles are burned into the video layer during interviews and discussions. The only English audio present is hidden under the louder Japanese over-dub. For example, when John speaks, you can hear him faintly in English, but the louder (more intense) translation over-dub almost buries the audio completely.

Even without understanding much of what is being said, the look into the inside of the Pixar studio and the work-in-progress art and reels of Big Hero Six are fun to watch. It's sad that an English version of this film was not made available in the US, or added as an extra on the Big Hero 6 Blu-ray in the US. Even an English subtitle track would have been much appreciated. However, this is still a good disc for a hardcore animation, Disney, or Pixar fan... If you don't mind not understanding the audio that is. Hopefully a fan will make a subtitle track to this film. :)

Bonus Features: There is also a 15 minute bonus feature with John about how the story of Big Hero Six came to be. This is in 100% English! No Japanese over-dub. (with Japanese subtitles burned in).

In addition there are two Japanese Disney trailers on the discs. 1 for Big Hero Six, one for a Tinker Bell film.",1441756800,,1725,4.627450980392157
