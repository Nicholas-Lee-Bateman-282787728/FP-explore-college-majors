so bizarre it's like nothing else.  I really liked it.",1372204800,,139,4.52
7848661,5,6303467377,"this is a wonderful film with a different slant on victims of the stupidity of ignorance during WW II.
It has compassion, humor, shows the best of humanity, is brilliantly actied and above all it is a true story about innocent people thrown into an impossible situation in the back country of Australia and making the most of it.
It is a testament to the marvelous virtues of the Jewish culture.
I highly recommend it, It will make you smile and will give you a positive, unforgettable experience.",1364169600,,497,4.659090909090909

7848663,4,6303467377,"Thank God that film makers choose to still do movies on uncharted territory. As many Holocaust films have become famous in recent years,DUNERA BOYS is an extremely odd yet refreshing retelling of little known,yet still highly controversial events that occured between England and Australia during WW2. England felt the need to purge itself of people of questionable connections during this time. These poor souls were placed aboard the ship Dunera and not even told where they were going. After an arduous journey the Dunera lands with it's cargo of disenfranchised in the dumping grounds of The British Empire,Australia. What transpires over the next three years for those who were the prisoners and those who ""guarded"" them is almost too odd to be believable-yet this story is positively true!!!The film can be a little plodding,but the information is soooooo worth the time. What can one say about the acting of Bob Hoskins???-Always first rate!",1172275200,2,948,5.2026143790849675
7848664,4,6303467377,"This film made me aware of a forgotten chapter of Jewish history.

When the Jews from Central Europe had fled to England, they were

treated as enemies -e.g. German during the outbreak of the war.

A ship (HMS Dunera) shipped the Jews to a prison camp in Australia; over time it became clear that these men were improperly imprisoned, and the jailors became much more lenient.

Some, in fact, joined the British army to fight the Nazis. The story is well scripted and acted and provides a glimpse about

war time hysteria that serves as a reminder today about loss of common sense in the effort to achieve national security. Good film and well worth watching.",1139356800,4,659,4.646551724137931
