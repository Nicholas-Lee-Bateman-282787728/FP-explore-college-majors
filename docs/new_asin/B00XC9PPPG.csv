7167111,5,B00XC9PPPG,"This was a superb documentary presenting human evolution alongside technological evolution... Though it is entertaining in its own right, the program in fact echoes much of what the most astute and authoritative observers of the age of sustainable development are saying... Jeffrey Sachs' The Age of Sustainable Development comes to mind... Bravo!",1440633600,,347,5.6923076923076925

7167113,4,B00XC9PPPG,"This is a visually impressive show about human progress through the ages. Mixing video clips and short interviews, the show has a feel like the History Channel's ""America: The Story of Us."" The synopsis of past trends and events is inspiring and the producers believe the future will bring an even interconnected world. However, there is a hint of a belief that we live in ""the best of all possible worlds."" For example, there is a graph of world population rising to nine billion, along with incredible pressure for food and energy resources. The producers look at this challenge and believe that current trends in food and energy production, along with moderate innovation, will solve these challenges. Viewers can decide if the film's research is accurate, however, the facts provided by the Microsoft scientist Stephen Emmott in the new book ""Ten Billion"" are very different. This film's optimistic tone and ambitious scope calls for top-notch science. Stephen Emmott's book provides the facts and scenarios that are missing here.",1439510400,,1034,5.160714285714286
7167114,5,B00XC9PPPG,"I recently saw this on PBS and was impressed with the quality and information given. A great sequel of one of my favorites ""earth from space"". I definitely would recommend this film",1438560000,3,181,4.6875
7167115,1,B00XC9PPPG,"I just finished watching Humanity From Space on PBS, and my sisters response was this bad science film featured some nice photography with a heavily techno-centric view of the future and lots of over simplification. It missed the point on all counts. Shame on you PBS. That is a good summation of this presentation.  The film totally ignored the fact that the planet is a small one with limited resources. It didn't deal with the mass extinction that is going on, with the inter-connectedness of all life, and of the necessity to consider other species we are dependent on as well as our own. It didn't deal with shortages of various minerals, of topsoil loss, of deforestation, of degradation of the oceans, to name a few. And the position expressed by many individuals that it would require between 3 and 7 planets the size of earth to provide all those things for an increasing population was totally bypassed. It didn't even address what the outcome would be when the population goes beyond the 9 billion level.  Are people going to stop reproducing? While the peoples of the world are more connected by technology than ever, a point the film attempted to make, we are still barbarians in many ways. The film ignored the fact that people don't get along any better than they ever did, and everywhere nations are on the verge of blowing each other up. Despite all the communication tools we have, our ability to communicate is arguably at an all-time low. The doomsday clock is inching closer to the hour, sad facts not addressed in this film.
This film mentioned climate change, but failed to address how the multiple problems induced by rising sea levels, dwindling resources, and increasingly unstable weather, such as expansion and maintenance of the infrastructure could be managed in this rapidly changing environment. It  focused on only a few odd, high tech, expensive solutions, but didn't consider the necessity that all of us might need to live differently so that we can all live. It postulated that data and knowledge are those things that will save us, but gave no mention of wisdom, or humility, or creativity, or any of the many social, moral, spiritual aspects of humanity. In addition, the prospects for the future outlined in the film are so narrow, so dismal, and so dependent on the same technology that brought us to this crisis, that Im reminded of what Einstein once wrote: We cannot solve problems by using the same thinking we used in creating them. Relying on knowledge and data is insufficient. It will take wisdom, and humility as well as an ability to think in brand new ways based intrinsically in deep understandings of the earth and our relationship to it in order to come up with a future that is livable for all people on the planet.  Our technology with all its data is unlikely to do this.
 I cringe to think that teachers might use this film in schools to give kids a false sense of security about the futureand a false belief in the power of the human being. The equation of data and technology with ability to solve the many problems of the future is at odds with the majestic power of the vast, ever-changing universe of which we are only a small part.  Though the film ends by saying that we are all interconnected and inhabitants of one world, the film made no mention of the sad fact that people everywhere are not getting any better at communicating.  I feel that the future is in better hands with small groups of people everywhere who are working to solve local problems, focused on small communities. The answer lies with themnot with Big Brother. There are many solutions for dealing with the future, but this film sadly, did not explore the truly promising ones.",1437868800,15,3715,4.714946070878274
7167116,4,B00XC9PPPG,The person who gave this show only 1 star and was very racist and mean obviously just has an ax to grind with a certain world population. Don't pay any attention to that review it is nonsense. The show does give solutions about what we can do to prevent and deal with the future issues we face. A real eye opener to anyone interested in what the worlds future looks like and what we should all be concerned about.,1437782400,2,413,4.2405063291139244

7167118,5,B00XC9PPPG,"Two mind numbing hours of spectacular video images and jaw dropping facts and statistics.  It's a long sit, but really one of the more informative things I've seen on PBS.  More educational than entertaining, but I could hardly tear myself away.  It is a history of the connections connecting humanity and an overview of their present state and a glimpse into their futures. Hard to believe it could be done in just two hours.  No doubt some will think of where it is a bit incomplete, but it is none the less an amazing accomplishment.
Things like this are the reason I support PBS!",1437523200,12,583,4.576923076923077
7167119,5,B00XC9PPPG,Very scary !!!!  People should heed the facts but I'm afraid ignorance will win out!,1468972800,,84,4.6
7167120,1,B00XC9PPPG,"The 3D graphics in this documentary are truly beautiful and a technical triumph, but the content is so bad that it hurts. Every topic is handled completely uncritically (Coal - best thing ever, Oil - even better), and absolutely obvious facts are delivered by the narrator as if they were astonishing news. This is what a commercial for Earth would look like, if it was produced by Fox News or History Channel. Seriously, PBS, you don't have to stoop to their level.",1465257600,5,466,4.695121951219512
7167121,5,B00XC9PPPG,Very satisfactory,1463011200,,17,8.0
7167122,2,B00XC9PPPG,"The goods:

1. Makes use of reliable sources such as authors of books, scientists, professors, etc.
2. Very good visual effects and footages of events.
3. Contains provocative facts and forwards scientific advancements into perspective.

The bad:

1. Does not have one over-arching concept on which the whole documentary is rested on.
2. Scrambled facts and concepts all over the documentary. One moment, it's discussing trading; a minute later it's on mobile phones.
3. The incoherence pretty much makes the whole thing difficult to watch because as a viewer it felt like being fed with everything and anything all at once.",1461196800,2,624,5.158415841584159

7167125,1,B00XC9PPPG,"This seems to be a propoganda piece for corporate globalization and the oil industry. The perspective of the narration is 100% Libertarian and 0% Sanders. It should be called Capitalism, Consumerism and Overconsumption from Space. It is a history of the world devoid of bicycles, public transportation, insulation, home solar panels, deforestation, social inequity and revolution. In one sequence coal is shown to be used in China, Japan and Europe, but when the graphic is turned to show the United States it is not coal production that is shown but natural gas. World population growth and water scarcity are dealt with at some length as aspects of ""food security"" requiring (according to the narration) the use of genetically modified (GM) crops. It is stated that one day solar and wind power will have to be relied upon, but only as a consequence of the planet's oil and coal having been depleted - and even then no mention is made of home solar panels. Instead solar power is shown in the form of a massive power plant in the desert thus transforming  free solar energy into a product to be corporatized, commoditized and marketed to the masses. I sat through this two hour energy commercial so you wouldn't have to. And just when did Egypt become part of the Fertile Cresent?",1455062400,8,1282,4.827272727272727
7167126,5,B00XC9PPPG,"I just finished watching this excellent and thought provoking program,l. The person who gave it s single star and wrote the lengthy bad review could not have watched the same program.

This highly informative program shows the problems we face with population growth with the environment, food supplies, water and energy and commands us to consider ways to change the way we use the above to allow us to survive.",1455062400,,412,4.885714285714286

7167128,5,B00XC9PPPG,"Brilliantly done! It gave insights into the thinking and motives behind the globalization of everything that has, until viewing this, seemed to me simply motivated by corporate greed. I am looking forward to viewing it many more times.",1442275200,,235,5.2105263157894735
8715685,2,B00XC9PPPG,"Comes across as liberal global-village indoctrination, stressing how we've become an international urban civilization that is so dependent on global trade and technological infrastructure that we would be utterly helpless without global cooperation.  Which is, of course, utter nonsense.  Today, most of our bloated human population is physically and mentally weaker, dependent on the medical industry, undereducated, and unable to survive alone in Nature; and that's a sad, sad commentary that shouldn't be glorified, much less presented as educational material.  The deluge of ""Gee Whiz"" historical facts and figures and visual effects in this program loses its novelty in the first 15 or 20 minutes; after that, the onslaught of numbers and measurements and the same computer graphics repeated endlessly becomes a blurred, torturous lecture and an endurance test.  Can't recommend it.",1517616000,4,887,5.696969696969697
8715686,2,B00XC9PPPG,Good Perspective but very biased. Though it addressed climate change it seems to be portraying everything we did is just right and that we will always prevail no matter what.,1517097600,,174,4.833333333333333

8715688,2,B00XC9PPPG,"A truly mind blowing perspective on how fast humans have altered life on earth in so short a period of time, and how change will increase exponentially in the future. Unfortunately, it's narrated by some very short sighted over-educated and egocentric academics  who all worship at the alter of the Enlightenment. With an extremely biased view of technology, this film feels as though it was produced by Exon. While acknowledging that climate change and population will be a problem, these spiritually bankrupt academics assure us that man will prevail through  unbounded intellect. A propaganda piece. Not to be shown to our young people. Shame on you PBS, who also ran 1 1/2 years of commercials from British Petroleum, explaining why the earth and everything on it is better off for the gulf oil spill.",1503878400,3,805,5.0

8715693,5,B00XC9PPPG,It gives you a new perspective on where we are in History which makes you makes realize how much has happened in only the short timer while you have been alive. It makes you  more aware how much and how fast new developments may come.,1474070400,,234,4.2
8715694,3,B00XC9PPPG,"For the images and graphic content, I'd rate this a 5-star presentation.  Especially the immersive graphics.  For the content however, the show's content falls short in realistic attitudes.  One of the things mentioned in conjunction with how to feed the ever-increasing global population is a technique termed ""urban farming""; the use of highly compacted ""growing rooms"" lit by LEDs illuminating vertical rows of plants which take less water than ""open air"" agriculture.  While the idea is an interesting one in the light of increasing yield-per-area and decreasing (hopefully) water usage, nothing is said of where do we get the additional electricity to power the LEDs needed to replace the sunlight falling naturally on the Earth's surface?  You're replacing one or more evils (increased land usage/increased water usage) of outdoor farming with the need to supply power somehow generated for the running of the LEDs as a replacement for natural sunlight.

If you live in a cave somewhere and have absolutely no idea of how completely interconnected the world has become in just the past 20-30 years, it's a real eye-opener.  I guarantee that absolutely no one who walks into a grocery store has any idea as to how much energy it takes to produce the food offered for sale, let alone WHERE the food actually comes from and what it takes to put that food on their tables.",1470268800,,1374,5.0
