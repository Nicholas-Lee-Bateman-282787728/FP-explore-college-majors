8182043,5,B000NVHWJI,"I love this product , I have been looking for it for so long. The price was amazing. It was one of my birthday presents to myself. Iam excited about it, and on my way to a healthy lifestyle. Thank You Debra",1463184000,,206,3.9285714285714284
8182044,3,B000NVHWJI,I would have rather had the book as I have one her other books & its very explanatory the dvd I felt left a bit to be desired,1377129600,,125,3.5
8182045,5,B000NVHWJI,"Love this easy to follow video. The 18 minute workout is doable, I feel great afterward and I am slowly developing defined muscles. Well worth what I paid for it on Amazon.

Update: after doing Joyce's workout for eight weeks. I feel better and stronger. I am developing biceps, triceps, quads and shoulder muscles. I am 62 years young and am discovering that I need not waste away physically. I've added an additional set to the pyramid workout so that I'm doing 5 - 10 - 15 - 20 lbs at a rate of 15 reps, 12 reps, 10 reps, 8 reps. This works for me and only adds a few minutes to my workout. I also ride my recumbent bike around my Florida neighborhood 4 to 6 days a week, usually 6 miles a day plus walking 2.5 miles a day, 3 or 4 times a week. This routine is easy on the joints, keeps me fit and is fairly easy now that I'm in the habit. Once your fitness routine becomes a habit, it is easier to keep it going. Thanks Joyce for the easy to follow workout. It DOES work if you'll do it three times a week with weights fitting your size, strength and fitness level.",1354838400,4,1069,4.09047619047619
8182046,5,B000NVHWJI,"This is a basic, no frills, gym style workout. It utilizes the modified pyramid system and works your entire body very efficiently. It can be used as a 2 day split routine (Day 1- upper body/Day 2 -Back, lower body, and abs), or as a total body workout in under an hour. Overall, I find Top Shape to be an effective weight training workout, and it is a longtime staple in my exercise collection.",1298764800,4,395,4.351351351351352
8182047,5,B000NVHWJI,"I did this video consistantly with heavy weights and saw results after a month. Joyce moves at a slower pace in this workout, compared to the lifting speed she uses in most of her workouts, so you can lift heavier and get good results. The lower body workout has less floorwork, probably geared toward men, but I'm a woman and I like less floorwork myself sometimes. There is a good variety of shoulder work in this workout, too, plus abs. I recommend it if you like her Bone Building, and/or Dynamic Tension workout dvds, you'll probably like this one, too.",1201046400,7,558,4.59
8182048,1,B000NVHWJI,"In my opinion, this video does not live up to the description and all the ""hype"". It was not challenging nor was it well choreographed. Basically, it had a couple of less than athletic women lifting light weights in a poor excuse for a studio.",1200614400,,243,4.4222222222222225
