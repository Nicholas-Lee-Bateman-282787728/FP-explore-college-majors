8438744,2,B0000VM7OG,"I teach fourth grade. This was way too young for the age group.  Babyish, really.  Information and facts were appropriate, but couldn't get past the ""acting"".",1242864000,,158,5.038461538461538
8438745,1,B0000VM7OG,"This easily was the most useless video I have ever ordered.  I teach 3rd grade and thought it would be educational.  It has all the makings of a middle school home history project set to video tape.  I'm sure the kids, who actually made this, and their families think it's cute, but, believe me, it's totally boring and idiotic. To see a boy portray Paul Revere running around his backyard with a stick horse, is just a small indication of the rest of the quality of this video.",1109808000,11,478,4.409090909090909
