7978328,5,B00007M5JG,"""Die Me, Dichotomy"" is actually the last episode of this season but it is on the second to last disc behind ""A Clockwork Nebari"".  The 3-parter ""Liars, Guns and Money"" should be watched before ""Die Me, Dichotomy"".  I watched in the order they were on the DVD set and was massively spoiled for the outcome of ""Liars, Guns and Money"".  Extremely confusing for a new fan!

Farscape is an absolutely fabulous show, of course.  I just wanted to warn other new fans of this mistake.",1236211200,2,476,4.552941176470588
7978329,5,B00007M5JG,"Farscape is about ten lightyears beyond any other scifi series out there in terms of plot, depth of characters, tension, humor, creatures, production values, or anything else you can think of.  Start watching from the very beginning, but rest assured: The ""Liars, Guns and Money"" trilogy on this set is one of the highlights of the entire series.",1142380800,,346,4.9655172413793105
7978330,5,B00007M5JG,"I remember starting a thread on the farscape newsgroup about how I worried that the series would end up cancelled much as Babylon5 was. Alas, here is a dvd set that shows what a tragedy it is. If this is the first Farscape you have read reviews about-
My feelings toward this show are best summed up by the feeling that I actually care what happens to each of the characters. It is as though they are my friends. It is said that the Henson group planned a 5-season story arc, One can only hope they'll manage to do a movie or two to finish it.",1048464000,4,543,4.132075471698113
7978331,5,B00007M5JG,"I started watching Farscape into the fourth season....my son finally conviced me to watch it. A little ironic isn't it, since it has been cancelled!
So...I have been buying all the dvds and going back to the beginning. I have enjoyed every episode, even though I know about some of the future. Now to my warning...for people like me, trying to watch the show from the beginning, and for people like me who just purchase without always reading amazon comments, BE WARNED that the episodes are out of order on this dvd set. I watched the final episode of the set, which is on the first dvd, and boy was I confused. I went to a web site that lists all the episodes and of course, I figured out what had happened. So, buy these, enjoy them, but do it in order!!!",1046563200,21,758,4.345070422535211
7978332,5,B00007M5JG,"These episodes is among the best of a truly great show and I can't recommend them high enough!! Just imagine the Liars,Guns and Money trilogy in a theater and it'll put the Star Wars prequels to shame.....Great acting,suspense,humor,drama,writing;what else can be said about a show that hasn't been said before??? Get these for the unconverted and maybe they'll undertstand what the fuss is about!!! Shame on you Sci-Fi for cancelling this wonderful show....",1043280000,9,458,5.287671232876712
