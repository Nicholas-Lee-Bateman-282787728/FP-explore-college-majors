8200826,5,6300268276,"WOW! 12 full length music videos of Blondie! Eat to the Beat (which I think is by far the best Blondie album to date), is featured here with AWESOME visuals of the band; check out the video for ""Shayla"", where Debbie sings of a UFO sighting, and the spunky fun of ""Die young stay pretty"" will have you laughing! Also features such Blondie standards as ""Dreaming"", ""Atomic"", and one of my favorites ""Sound-A-Sleep""(which has Debbie singing this solo ballad of insomnia on a rotating circular bed, Very Sexy! This was shot in the band's home town filmed in one week. David Mallet directed the video and went on to direct video's with the likes of David Bowie. This was 1979 before Mtv Before VH1, very very experimental at the time of release. If you love Music Videos or more yet LOVE BLONDIE, then this video is for you. This is out of print and very hard to find. I hardly doubt EMI will release it on DVD but we can hope. This video is so cool. Why listen to Eat to the Beat, when you can See and Hear Blondie with Eat to the Beat, now.",1061856000,2,1038,4.301020408163265
8200827,4,6300268276,"Blondie made ""Eat to the Beat"" before M-TV and when the only VTRs were SONY Betamax (and those far from commonplaces.)  They were the future -- what M-TV and videomusic (""videos"") owe to ""A Hard Day's Night"" they also owe to ""Eat to the Beat.""  Imagine, a group releasing a videotape of all the material of their latest album, unusual even today.  It's Blondie at their peak.",1046304000,,375,4.567164179104478
