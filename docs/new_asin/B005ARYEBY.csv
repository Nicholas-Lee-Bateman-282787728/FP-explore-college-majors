4641342,5,B005ARYEBY,"I love the classic horror movies. Especially Friday the 13th!  I grew up watching these movies in the dark with a bowl of buttered popcorn. I put in part 1 as soon as I walked in the door from my mailbox.  If you are a fan at all, you HAVE to get this set. I've already ordered the rest.",1332115200,2,287,3.847457627118644
4641343,5,B005ARYEBY,"This four pack DVD collection includes the first four classic Friday the 13th films. All four films are the recently released deluxe editions which are amazing. The picture quality for all the movies is the best its ever been & there are tons of awesome special features. I loved watching the Friday the 13th reunion & seeing Betsy Palmer who played Mrs. Vorhees. I could listen to her tell stories about the film all day & she has some hilarious input. I also loved seeing Ari Lehman who played Jason as a little boy at the end of the film because he made an appearance opening night for the remake in Davenport, IA & he's an awesome guy. Part I, Part II & Part IV are the strongest films in this set but Part III is still a great film as well. This is a definite must have for any horror fan & this set comes at a great price for four classic slasher films. Friday the 13th was created basically to rip off Halloween but the series grew into its own. If you're like myself & are just recently thinking about purchasing these movies, start with this because nothing beats the deluxe editions & hopefully they will release another four pack of films V-VIII.",1324684800,17,1157,4.386046511627907
4641344,4,B005ARYEBY,"This is a collection of four movies also available in individual deluxe editions. If you're looking for comments on the quality of the movies or the DVD presentation, you can check out reviews on the separate pages; this review will focus on the set-up of this four-pack. All I really have to save about the movies is that they're what you might expect from low-budget 1980s horror. The plot, such as it is, is basically the same every time. The acting is uneven, but the writing is so flat and functional that the actors are only rarely asked to do something they can't manage. The only ambition at work is to offer audiences a collection of eight to ten teenagers who tell stupid jokes, flirt, show a little skin, and then die in mildly inventive ways. And sometimes, that's all you're looking for in a horror movie.

But about this package. All four discs are in one standard-size Amaray DVD case, with a slipcover that slides off at the top or bottom. The cover artwork visible with the Amazon listing is printed on both the slipcover and the DVD case liner. The four discs are on two double-sided ""flappers"" inside the case. Two sets of red-and-blue 3D glasses are in a plastic baggie inside the front of the case, so you can watch the third film in 3D, although the quality of the 3D image is so poor you might not want to bother. Generally the case is convenient, although after you've removed and used the 3D glasses, it can be a little difficult to get the case shut again with them inside.

Given how this four-pack and the individual deluxe editions are discounted at the moment, you'll save about $10 buying this instead of those. The four-pack currently works out to $4 a movie, which would be reasonable even for a bare-bones edition, let alone the solid if slight special features on these versions. If you really prefer separate cases for each film, that may not be enough savings, but for those who prefer a bargain or want to save storage space, this set is a great choice.",1323216000,61,1991,4.543175487465181
4641345,5,B005ARYEBY,My favorite of all. Watched this back in the 80's and at time I have to laugh because I was sacred to turn off the lights. Love the talks they have with the actors. That's cool ,1504569600,2,177,3.9166666666666665

4641351,1,B005ARYEBY,"I'm not reviewing the films here because, frankly, what more can be said about them?

No, what I'm writing about in today's short rant is the patently false marketing of this set by the hallow suits at Paramount, who are really just taking the piss out of customers at this point.  When you pick the set up and flip it over, the entry for part 3D includes a whopping big graphic that says, ""Includes a 3D version of the film with 2 pairs of 3D glasses"". It's big, it's flashy, it includes an image of two neat looking pairs of 3D glasses side-by-side.

So I ripped off the cellophane, opened the set, and low and behold: no glasses.

Bravo, Paramount. Just when I thought you couldn't get any cheaper regarding the method by which you handle Friday the 13th home releases, you fail to even include what's advertised right on the back of the set. That's pretty insulting on the part of the Paramount marketing department, and in the wake of botched release after botched release of this franchise, we should really be holding them to a higher standard of product.

If you're at all interested in seeing Part III in 3D, this set will not help you achieve that.",1493769600,4,1158,4.495238095238095

No. I don't go into horror movies and expect to wet my pants. I'm, in it for a good and thought-out story. So a bunch of teens go to camp and die. That's the plot. And some of the deaths aren't even convincing. But I understand that back then it was scary because there is no happy ending and the average American is incapable of defending him/herself. Back then a decapitation scene was traumatizing. Today I watch stuff like that for breakfast. And the 3-D is TOTAL GARBAGE. Yeah, that snake jumping at the screen is so out of focus the only way I knew it was a snake was because it hissed. I had a better 3-D experience watching Spy Kids. SO IN SHORT....

The 3D glasses are garbage though and don't work for part 3. For me these are mindless movies that fill a gap if your in the mood for slasher films from the era and a time when the horror genre was really taking off.

4641415,3,B005ARYEBY,"#1 -- I don't understand IMDb's ""X"" rating.  Jason doesn't appear until the very end when he emerges from underwater and grabs the lone survivor.  His continued existence doesn't make sense since he supposedly drowned 20 years earlier according to his mother and the locals.  Made me wonder if he was living in the lake the whole time.  Some decent gore, a few surprises, but not an ""X"" film.
#2 -- A sequel to the first film with a recap of what happened then.  Jason is the killer now, wearing a cloth head cover with only one eye hole -- there's no hockey mask.  He somehow survives multiple bodily assaults and takes revenge on everybody.  We do get to see his face when his cover is removed -- the right side is badly scarred (by fire?) but the left is pretty much normal.
#3 -- Watched in 2D mode.  Murder and mayhem as Jason, now with his characteristic hockey mask, kills off all but one.  The survivor, in a canoe on the lake (sound familiar?), is grabbed by Jason's mother who rises up from underwater.
#4 -- Everybody gets killed by Jason except the kid and his mom.  And the ending has us starting to wonder about the kid's future.  The film is basically gory killings separated by long, some overly so, suspense-building to the next one.  I'm amazed at the abilities of Jason: how quickly he cleans up after his kills; how he manages to be at the place beforehand where the next victim is unsolicitously heading; how he survives assault after assault, any of which being sufficient to do in a normal human.",1443830400,3,1519,4.483636363636363

4641434,5,B005ARYEBY,"When I was a little kid, a trailer for ""Friday the 13th: Part 2"" came on television as I lay there playing with some toy soldiers. It was broad daylight, a summer's day, and my older brother and friends were in the backyard. Alone in the house, I froze with terror as I saw brief, stuttering images of teenagers being stalked and killed by an unseen murderer, and heard the shrilling, shrieking soundtrack which accompanies this 30-second burst of mayhem. I ran down the stairs, out the front door, through the back gate and into the backyard, a process that probably took five or six seconds at the speed I was sprinting. But I vividly remember being certain, absolutely certain, that Jason Voorhees would be faster. He'd get me. Burst out of a closet or jump out of a tree or just be standing there, mouth-breathing through his burlap mask, when I rounded a corner.

If this doesn't sound like the beginning of a love letter to good ole Jason, it isn't -- exactly. The fact is I've always had a love-hate relationship with Crystal Lake's least popular citizen -- emphasis on the hate. During my tweenage years he deprived me of a lot of sleep, and until my early-mid-30s he routinely showed up in my dreams, dripping, rotted and scabrous; obviously dead, yet still brimming with homicidal determination and armed with something sharp. Perhaps this isn't strange. No less a horror personage than Robert Englund explained Jason-phobia as, ""Quite simply the fear of Death itself, coming for your ***."" That's about the size of it, right down to the skull-like hockey mask. And yet, damn it, I can't stop watching these movies. Especially the first four -- the ""real"" Friday films, which tell the story of the antihero's beginning, middle and (supposedly) final stop at the campgrounds. Hence my five-star review of this wonderful, inexpensive, extras-laden quadrilogy. It not only gives you maximum bang for your buck, it does it at a discount.

For our purposes we can consider this collection to be not four separate films but four episodes of one gigantic horror movie, so that's the way I'm going to approach it here.

""Part One"" begins at Camp Crystal Lake in the mid-late 1950s. Two frisky counselors slip off to experience carnal bliss in a barn, and instead are hacked to bits by an unseen attacker. Cut to the same location in 1980. A rather obsessive fellow named Steve Christie is determined to reopen ""Camp Blood"" despite persistent rumors that the place is cursed. Steve probably should have listened to the rumors, because no sooner do his employees begin to show up than they also fall prey to a cunning, patient murderer who knows the camp as well as they do, and seems to have very strong motivation indeed for making sure it never opens. This movie, which features both a young Kevin Bacon and a terrifying Betsy Palmer as Pamela Voorhees, is considered one of the very first slashers, and will feel formulaic to modern audiences, but still retains its brutal, unrelenting edge: the last 20 minutes set the standard for the series' exploitation of jump scares, fear of the woods, shrieking, nerve-shredding music, and ""horror in safe places.""

""Part Two"" starts with an almost unbearably effective stalking sequence which ties up a ""loose end"" left over from the first film (that's all I can say without spoiling). Cut to five years after the events of the first film. A new gang of counselors has descended on Crystal Lake to revive the camp, and a new killer is waiting to meet them in a cabin of his own. ""Two"" ups the ante on the first film in almost every way, featuring both a larger number of murders and more brutal violence, culminating in a grisly game of cat-and-mouse between the supposedly dead Jason Voorhees and his would-be final victims.

Quickening the pace of the mayhem still further, ""Part Three"" begins on the very same night as ""Part Two"" -- just a few hours after Jason ironically lost a fight with a machete. Undaunted, he pays an unwanted visit to some local merchants before taking refuge in a barn. When morning arrives a fresh gang of horny teens shows up at the rental farmhouse next door, looking to smoke weed, drink beer, engage in premarital sex and generally commit every horror-movie foul in the book. For which they are penalized. Horribly. ""Part Three"" is, for my money, the best movie not only of this collection but of the entire F13 series, mingling terror and violence with humor and surprisingly good acting; and not only bestows Jason with his trademark hockey mask (Thanks, Shelly!) but adds a 3D-angle to maximize the carnage.

""Part Four"" was known as ""The Final Chapter"" when it was released in 1984. Paramount Studios had grown embarrassed by the franchise and decided -- pun intended -- to kill it and bury it following one last orgy of senseless violence (a decision that lasted about as long as it took to total up the box office receipts and greenlight ""Part Five""). To that end: a few hours after the end of the previous film, Jason wakes up in the Crystal Lake morgue with an axe-induced headache and an even greater determination to exterminate every human being in his path. His path of murderous destruction leads him to a pair of lakeside homes: one occupied by the usual crowd of hapless, horny teens on summer vacation, the other by the Jarvis family. In an added twist, there is nearby camping a lone young man nursing a homicidal vendetta of his own -- against Jason himself. The Angry Goalie shows no favoritism but tries to exterminate them all, leading to frenzy of the most brutal killing yet, and an ending which is relentless as it is decisive and -- in terms of Jason's ultimate nemesis -- unexpected. This movie features a young Crispin Glover (in a terrific performance) and an even younger Corey Feldman.

Now, it doesn't take a great brain to see that these movies were intended as mindless popcorn entertainment and, perhaps unintentionally, hit some kind of collective nerve and entered into cinematic legend...which in no way implies they aren't mindless popcorn entertainment at heart. There is not much in the way of plot, nothing that could properly be described as character development and an ever-increasing use of brutal violence to distract the audience from the fact that the this is the same story told, with some variation, four times in a row. Some of the murders are extremely vicious and sadistic -- a guy in a wheelchair gets a meat cleaver through the head, a pregnant woman is run through with a red-hot poker, a man is run through the groin with a spear gun and lifted high in the air, a couple gets impaled with a spear while having sex, and so on -- and the entire series is a frank appeal to the need to both vicariously release fear and satisfy blood thirst. Yet I would argue that these first four F13 movies rise above their own ambitions and, certainly, above all the ""zombie Jason"" sequels and reboots that followed, and blunder somehow into the plane of art. Not only did they deliver us an iconic horror-movie bad guy -- maybe THE horror-movie bad-guy of all time -- and set the stage for endless imitators, they also weave together to tell a single grisly tale about revenge gone mad that still makes some of us extremely hesitant to go into the woods. Or a barn. Or a cabin. Or camping. Or leave the house after dark. Because you never know.

4641488,5,B005ARYEBY,"Friday the 13th, like Halloween, Psycho, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and A Nightmare On Elm Street, is a shining example of the horror genre. Released in 1980, this splatter flick helped to usher in the modern horror films of the late 1970's and 1980s. At the time of its release, it was both revered and feared for its realistic portrayal of murder. It was one of the first films in the history of movies to feature such graphic and gory violence. It also gave birth to Jason Voorhees, though the killer in this first installment is his mother, Pamela. Often imitated, the original Friday the 13th popularized a number of themes and techniques in the genre: the increasingly gory murders, the remote forest location, the anonymous and nubile cast, the murderer as cult hero, and, of course, the moral that if you have sex, you will die. This film is now extra special as it includes a few minutes of additional footage. The passage of time has turned this film and the franchise it spawned into a genre classic. Essential if you are a horror fan of horror!

The sequel, PART 2, is in my opinion an even better film. It builds on the first and introduces Jason as the killer. This one is actually my favorite in the series. It is a little faster and just a tad more suspenseful.

The 3rd in the series, PART 3, is in 3D which is fun. It introduces the long running staple of Jason's hockey mask and increases the creativity in the murders. Another good entry!

The 4th in the series, PART 4: The Final Chapter, is the supposed death of Jason at the hands of Tommy Jarvis (played masterfully by Corey Feldman), though he always seems to come back in the following sequels. The last fun entry in the series.

In my opinion there is no reason to explore this wonderful horror franchise past the first four films because, even though the story continues, there is really nothing important to further the story after PART 4. The first film sets up the story, the second introduces Jason. The 3rd introduces Jason as a mainstay in the horror genre and the fourth film kills the beast. After PART 4, the films begin to get stale. PART 5 doesn't even feature Jason, but a copycat killer. PART 6 takes away the credibility by reviving Jason and turning him into a zombie-like monster. PART 7 is forgettable and PART 8 takes Jason out of the camp setting that he works best in.",1355788800,5,2367,4.5233644859813085

All of the movies that I have watched are completely clean without any issues.  If you're buying this 4-pack, I'm guessing that you already have seen the movies and know the storyline, so I won't cover that.

Available at a very reasonable price, this collection is an excellent value, and comes in space saving packaging.  Except for Friday the 13th Part 3, each of the deluxe editions features a nice set of extras, including featurettes, retrospectives, deleted scenes, and commentary tracks.

The success of John Carpenter's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Halloween/dp/B000UR9QHQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Halloween</a>&nbsp;(1979) inspired a pack of imitators, launching the 80's slasher craze.  One of the most successful entries in the genre was Sean Cunningham's Friday The 13th, a deliciously nasty slasher that featured a female killer.  The second entry in the series introduced Jason Voorhees as a vicious killing machine, who would soon join Michael Myers, as an icon in the slasher genre.  The rest is history, as Jason's bloody killing sprees made Camp Crystal Lake, the place with a ""death curse"", one of the most infamous locations in horror.

The series features a plethora of memorable kills, as knives, axes, and the occasional arrow, seem to be Voorhees' favorite weapons.  Each of the films features the iconic music of composer Harry Manfredini, with his theme for Part 3 being particularly noteworthy.  Part 3 also sees, a hockey mask becoming part of Jason's legendary persona.  Makeup effects specialist Tom Savini, also contributes to several of the films.

The series was to have ended after The Final Chapter, but with an enduring appeal, the Friday the 13th series returned for more sequels, and remake.  Although originally regarded by some as just exploitive trash, the first four films have become classic slashers with an enduring legacy.  The image quality of the deluxe versions are quite good, although at times they exhibit some grain and grit.  Anyone looking to get into the fun happenings at Camp Crystal Lake, without expending a lot of cash, shouldn't hesitate to get this set, which provides hours of terror and dozens of brutal kills.  Hopefully parts V through VIII, will also be released in a similar fashion.",1348963200,2,3017,6.881889763779528
4641492,5,B005ARYEBY,"The quintessential set from the quintessential SLASHER franchise!! Four films that deserve their rightful spot in EVERY horror fan's DVD collection - these classic entries in the legendary and seemingly unstoppable ""killer-in-the-woods"" series are what ALL other 80's slasher films aspired to be. Parts 1 and 2 are gritty, solid horror films that take themselves quite seriously and provide great atmosphere with jumps, scares and shocks galore, even decades later. Parts 3 & 4 added some slightly cliched corny 80's shenanigans but feature the iconic Jason we've all come to know and love, with his hockey mask, massive build and relentless, brutal attacks. After Part Four, the series really plummeted into a self-parodying joke of itself interspersed with kills.

The casting for the most part is quite good with the actors coming off like ""real kids"" rather than Hollywood starlets. And the soundtrack, which (especially in the first two installments) creates an alternately creepy and frenetic environment, is one of the greatest and most memorable scores of any horror movie, ever! This is the only ""Friday The 13th"" collection you'll ever need, although you may find yourself wanting more.

Here's a quick rundown of the plots:

Part 1 - Long shuttered Camp Crystal Lake is being reopened. As the counselors arrive and begin setting up, someone is killing them off one-by-one.
Part 2 - Five years later a new camp is opening on the same doomed lake. Jason, sporting a burlap-bag over his head, kills anyone invading his territory.
Part 3 - Jason gets his hockey mask and kills vacationing campers (and a motorcycle gang) in 3D!!
Part 4 - Jason is at his baddest in this one -  slicing, dicing and crushing anyone in his path - however the annoying teens in this chapter will have you rooting for Jason.

There are plenty of extras included with these but unfortunately the ""cut"" scenes from Part 2 still have not surfaced and are believed to be ""lost"". Don't miss the classic trailers which seductively promised 13 horrible deaths as they counted from one to thirteen - and had people lined up at theaters across the country! Perfect viewing for Halloween, Summer or anytime a Friday happens to fall on the 13th!",1341187200,6,2219,4.9703504043126685
4641493,5,B005ARYEBY,"April 13th 2012 landed on a Friday.  I never watched this since I was a kid when it aired on T.V. So 20 something years later, I always wanted to see it.
 I got the flu since Tuesday and then came the weekend--- Friday April 13th 2012. When I got home from work, after dinner & medication, I was bored I turned on my cable t.v. and nothing good to watch, no friday the 13th movie.  Next morning I went to Walmart to buy it. I started watching this movie from part one to part 4.  The other reviewers reviews about this movie was right and it deserve 7/5 stars. I find this movie fun and the actors should of killed Jason completely not just the ax half way on his skull.  Since Jason is an extremely super tough guy, you must kill him the way he kills his victims, or simply chop his head off otherwise he is still alive.

8463588,5,B005ARYEBY,"Hello,

Before you buy this set here is some free info (Especially for those wondering about Part 3 in 3-D) - This specific Friday the 13th Deluxe Edition Four-Pack was originally released in 2013. I bought it when it first came out and it came with a nice slip case and two pair of 3-D Glasses (Blue & Red Anaglyph).

If you look in the 'product details' area of this page you will see that this release is from February 2017. Now I know that you can't see the back of the box but it clearly states in the description of Part 3 - 'PRESENTED IN 2-D & 3-D' but also states 'ANAGLYPH 3-D GLASSES NOT INCLUDED' and it also has a '2017 Paramount Pictures' date at the bottom of the cover sleeve.

My point is...when companies re-issue disc sets like these and sell them for $10 or so, they usually don't always include the frills and packaging of the original release to cut down on production cost and thus be able to sell you a four disc-set of movies for $10 or $12.

Yes...Amazon should show both the front and back views but customers should also pay attention to the product details and maybe do a little research just to be sure before you click the Add To Cart button.

For those who think they are getting screwed because it this set doesn't contain 3-D glasses...

...the 3-D version is nothing to write home about and the regular 2-D version looks just fine. I think that I originally paid about $25 or $30 when this first came out. Now for around ten bucks you're not being screwed. Any old pair of blue & red 3-D glasses will 'work' if you simply must watch it in all it's blurry blueish/red tinted glory. The original movie was presented in ""Real"" Polarized 3-D in theaters and looked great. The blue and red transfer is prone to double image/ghosting and more often then not just doesn't work well.

In contrast, My Bloody Valentine (3-D Remake) was released on Dvd & Bluray in 3-D using purple and green tinted glasses and it actually worked perfectly. I was surprised by how well.

Anyway, hope this helps somehow and don't blame the messenger. :)
