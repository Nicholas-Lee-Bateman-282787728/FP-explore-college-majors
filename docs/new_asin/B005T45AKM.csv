8485777,5,B005T45AKM,"This beautifully mesmerizing DVD is a must have for anyone curious to peak under Hawaiian waters. You are provided a choice to view the documentary with or without commentary. I find myself playing it without commentary just for the soundtrack. In fact, I have not found a better Hawaiian music compilation. An award winning video regarding Hawaiian reef etiquite is also included. Children who watch don't avert their eyes during the first viewing. My only wish is that it was available on Blu-Ray.",1358380800,2,499,5.024096385542169
