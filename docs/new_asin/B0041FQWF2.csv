4241936,5,B0041FQWF2,"This is a great set. The only part missing is the 40th anniversary. Maybe next time.
Let's hope in a future set called ""Frank Sinatra around the world"" with Egypt, Israel, Brazil etc. concerts.
Even the price is incredible.",1287964800,14,223,4.743589743589744
4241937,5,B0041FQWF2,"Yes, many of these concerts have been previously available, but they are currently ALL out of print (as of 10-2010). Much of the footage is NEW to DVD, and NEW to Sinatra fans. Over half of this box set features performances by Frank Sinatra in TOP FORM.  These performances are treasured by Sinatraphiles all over the world.  The greatest hour in this 7 disc set, and worth the price of admission alone, is the 1967 television special featuring Sinatra, Antonio Carlos Jobim, and Ella Fitzgerald.  Music does not get more special, nor more classier than that lineup!  Other high points are the saloon medleys from the 1966, '68 and '69 TV specials, all of the Man and His Music specials, the much sought after CONCERT FOR THE AMERICAS, and the excellent Ol' Blue Eyes is Back.  The 1971 Concert at Royal Festival Hall is brilliant from start to finish, and features one of the all-time great Sinatra performances of ""One For My Baby (One For the Road)"".  I could go on and on, but there are 7 discs here, folks, each with multiple shows on them!  The price is a bargain, and you are getting SINATRA.",1286928000,142,1100,4.581632653061225

Undoubtfully, it is an absolutely must have for all fans of ""The chairman of the board"". I don't know the bonuses featured in that new DVD box but surely there are also gems.
I am certain that the SINATRA family has still many treasures in their vaults, to reveal, carefully, one by one...",1285113600,34,608,4.333333333333333

4241966,5,B0041FQWF2,"This seven disc collection finally compiles all of Sinatra's television specials between 1965 and 1985, in newly remastered sound and picture. In recent years, it is probably the most impressive release the Sinatra enterprise has put out. This review is to give a brief look at each special, their high's and low's (of which there are rarely any).

Discs 1 and 2: A Man and His Music: The Collection
A Man and His Music (1965)  the inaugural edition of the M&HM series is a solid debut, but probably my least favorite of the original three specials. The set list is a very safe greatest hits affair, and at times this feels like were watching a rehearsal. Still, there are some high points, mainly the medley of ballads built around It Was a Very Good Year.

A Man and His Music Part II (1966)  A much looser show than the first special, with lots of great performances and a more interesting selection of songs. We get new arrangements of certain songs that would never be played elsewhere (a quirky, organ driven Youre Nobody Till Somebody Loves You, and a bluesy, laid back Thats Life, stripped of its backing vocals and brass fills), some rarely aired signposts from past albums (Moonlight in Vermont, Grenada), and the first of several saloon song medleys played against a proto-music video of Sinatra singing on an empty stage, either in a lonely apartment or bar set piece. These were always highlights of Sinatras specials.

A Man and His Music + Ella + Jobim (1967)  A legendary show and a nice diversion from the format of the first two specials. The opening Day-In Day-Out is a blast and one of the most unique arrangements Sinatra ever sang against, and both guests are excellent during their spotlight moments, especially the legendary finale with Ella and Frank going toe to toe on several big band era standards, culminating in a dazzling The Lady is a Tramp that will have you on your feet as if you were in the studio.

Sinatra: The Man and His Music (1981)  Sinatras last tv special captures him in the midst of his post-Retirement peak (1977-82), riding high on the success of New York, New York and about to release his last great record, She Shot Me Down. Formatted a bit differently than previous specials, Sinatra highlights specific albums throughout his career. Hes in fine voice and his commentaries before each song are engaging. Highlights are the She Shot Me Down tracks, Something, both performances with Basie, The Girl from Ipanema, and a smoky, stripped down I Get a Kick Out of You.

Discs 3 and 4: Around the World
Ol' Blue Eyes is Back (1973)  Sinatras 1971 retirement was a blow to the music world, but thankfully it didn't last long. This 1973 special shows that Frank hadnt really lost much in the layoff; his voice is in fine shape and the show does a good job of balancing nostalgia with newer material. The highlight here is the song-and-dance sequence with Gene Kelly, followed closely by the obligatory saloon song medley, probably the most stark of them all, both visually and musically, but also the most haunting.

Sinatra: The Main Event (1974)  The most overrated concert of Franks career, where the hype didn't live up to the actual performance. Yes, the boxing match style intro by Howard Cossell and the raucous Madison Square Garden crowd certainly add something, but Frank himself is out of shape and his voice is weak by his standards, dodging notes hed normally glide through with ease. Still, even sub-par Sinatra is better than most, and the show has its own share of highlights, including a haunting Angel Eyes, a moving The House I Live In, and one of the most exciting Ive Got You Under My Skins he ever performed, mostly thanks to the crowd interaction and the work of Woody Hermann and the Thundering Herd.

Sinatra In Concert at Royal Festival Hall (1970)  Another concert I was never really wowed by. This was done months before Frank did his Retirement Show, and he looks beat here; hes going through the motions on many songs and theres rarely any fire in his phrasing. Worth it, however, for the saloon song section, including a ponderous, lurching One for My Baby with a modified Gordon Jenkins arrangement that makes the song more haunting than ever.

Sinatra In Japan: Live at the Budokan Hall, Tokyo (1985)  A great twilight-era Sinatra concert, just a couple of years before the decline really began. His voice has a bit more rasp but is still impressive, and the backing orchestra of top Japanese players really adds some life to these songs. The highlights here are a swinging All or Nothing at All and a haunting One for My Baby unlike any other version.

Disc 5: Primetime
Francis Albert Sinatra Does His Thing (1968)  The first special not to bare the Man and His Music moniker, this special draws some ire from fans since it had Frank trying to pander to hippie crowd, and some moments here are pretty embarrassing: the swinging Hello Young Lovers means well but just doesn't work, and Frank in love beads crooning with the Fifth Dimension can't live up to Frank and Ella one-upping each other on the standards. However, theres some sublime moments as well: Lost in the Stars is a supremely moving performance, the ""Nice 'n' Easy"" / ""How Little We Know"" medley is great despite the visuals, and the gospel medley with Diahann Carroll is a great change of pace from Franks usual fare. And while the 'saloon medley' is a bit too melodramatic this time around (did we really need the 'thunder' sound effects?), it is anchored by a supremely moving version of ""Here's that Rainy Day"" that may be the best one he ever did.

Sinatra (1969)  The fifth and final of the original run of NBC specials, this is Frank back in his usual setting, with no guests, armed with a solid set of old favorites and new tracks, including My Way. The show is a bit more nostalgic than previous specials, including a medley of songs from Sinatras films set against a montage of his various roles over the years. The saloon medley is the most unique one he did here, made up entirely of new material from his 1969 album A Man Alone, including the stunning Forget to Remember. Other highlights include Please Be Kind, My Way, The Tender Trap, and a touching Loves Been Good to Me.

Sinatra and Friends (1977)  The weakest special of Sinatras career, mostly because it has way too little focus on the Man himself. Frank himself is in good voice, and the duet portions are fine, particularly My Kind of Town with Tony Bennett and September Song with John Denver, but the rest of the show is hit or miss, with only Natalie Cole, Bennett and Denver being compelling on their own. Watching Sinatra and Loretta Lynne warble through a disco version of All or Nothing At All borders a little too close to parody.

Disc 6: The Concert for the Americas (1982)  This may well be the best concert of Sinatras career; chalk it up to the remarkable shape of his voice, or the beautiful atmosphere of the venue, or the great set list that include some rarely aired signposts throughout his career (When Your Lover Has Gone, the Basie take on I Wont Dance), its just a fantastic show from start to finish, finally available in great sound and picture.",1429660800,7,7187,4.663241106719368

Mom has seen Sinatra in concert many times.  She met him in person several times.  He was, by far, her favorite artists.  This seemed like it was a slam dunk.

The look on her face, the sighs of contentment and little giggles were well worth the cost.  It was as though she was transported back in time.

As for me, I wasn't really a Sinatra fan.  I grew up with wonderful music, Big Bands, jazz and Sinatra.  I have a very eclectic taste in music.  I found myself watching and smiling, too.  Sinatra had an amazing voice.  Listening to him is like hot chocolate on a cold day.",1414886400,2,724,4.159420289855072

4242005,4,B0041FQWF2,"This is an excellent compilation of some of legendary Frank Sinatra's filmed concerts, TV shows and TV specials that go back to the mid 1950's.  After coming back from some personal issues, Sinatra reappeared on TV with a regular show in 1957.  The most recent show here is a 1985 concert he did for Japanese television.  The quality of the video ranges from poor to very good but always watchable.  The audio quality is very good except for some of the performances from the `50s.  Some is mono, some stereo and there is even one Dolby Digital 5.1 concert.  Rather than put these shows in chronological order, the producers linked them in unusual ways.  For example: ""Primetime,"" ""Around the World,"" ""A Man and His Music.""  ""Concert for the Americas"" is its own disc because of length.  Overall, this is a ""must have"" for Sinatra fans.  Here is a review of each disc:

Disc 1:  11-3-11 - 3.5 - ""Frank Sinatra:  A Man and His Music"" (1965) - This is part of the Sinatra collective DVD set, comprised of various filmed or taped shows that he did.  Most, like this one, were television specials.  This is his first.  Taped November 15-17, 1965 for NBC it aired November 24.  As expected these are production qualities of a spare nature as TV was still evolving.  Even the opening is a bit of a laugher with the boom mic clearly in the picture above Frank.  The sets are of a minimalist modern style.  The picture is grainy as you would expect.  The sound is a pretty decent Dolby Digital 2.0.  I also noticed Ed McMahon from the Johnny Carson ""Tonight Show"" is the MC.  The audience applause is canned as there is no one in sight outside musicians.  Between each song Frank briefly cracks a couple jokes and reminisces about his life and the next song.  Highlights are ""Nancy"" written for his daughter who was 2 at the time and a Medley where an ""It Was a Very Good Year"" verse begins another song about a reflection on youth.  I noticed that the last of these, ""Younger than Springtime"" is omitted from the accompanying booklet.  Frank looks great and sounds even better.

4-20-09 - 3.5 - ""Frank Sinatra:  A Man and His Music (1966) - Frank looks and sounds great. The setting unfortunately was way too bright and sterile even for the time. Daughter Nancy was the guest as she was just beginning her career and in fact, had a couple hits. ""Bang Bang"" is still terrific today, others not so much. Frank was competing with The Beatles, The Stones, Elvis and others during this changing period, but still managed to put out a hit or two, including ""That's Life"" included here. He really shines however on chapter 9, a medley of some great sultry songs beginning with ""Just One of Those Things"". Everything else is so so as Frank tried to remain relevant with humor and PC incorrect Amos and Andy dialect.

Disc 2:  11-4-11 - 4.0 - ""Frank Sinatra:  A Man and his Music + Ella + Jobim"" (1967) - This is the 3rd of what became an annual Sinatra special for NBC.  This was taped in early October and was shown November 13, 1967.  Frank opens with a couple upbeat numbers and says the theme of the night is rhythm, and then launches into ""Ol' Man River"".  While this is one of the best numbers of the night, there ain't much rhythm.  The sets retain their sparse nature as they have throughout this 3 year run.  A little more color adds a bit of zest.  And we finally see a small audience in the final segment, all behind the performers (Frank and Ella).  The men are decked out in their black tux uniforms and the wives in their fur stoles and jewelry.  I suspect everyone was gleaned from the NBC boardroom.  I've always been a fan of Ella Fitzgerald.  It's pretty evident she and Frank borrowed from the same singers.  Their phrasing and singing styles are very similar.  Ella seems a bit uneasy in her opening set, but settles in at the end of the show with Frank by her side.  I've always felt that Antonio Carlos Jobim was one of the best collaborators Sinatra ever had.  Their music blends beautifully and their 3 songs together, while familiar, are glorious.  Watch Frank light one up during this set.  Of the other numbers, check out Frank and Ella early on, cover Little Anthony and the Imperial's ""Goin' Out Of My Head"" at the end of their medley.

4-23-09 - 3.0 - ""Frank Sinatra:  The Man and His Music - With the Count Basie Orchestra""  (1981)- Filmed in 1981 for a TV special, it shows Frank has aged significantly since the 1966 special on the other side. Still,his voice is fine. Unfortunately, his memory must be fading as he pretty much sings the words to the songs off cue cards or prompters. The big Basie Orchestra backs him up, but the Count utters nary a word...he's looking old too. Another big surprise, no audience...a little weird. The big highlight for me was a straight on version of New York, New York. Unlike most musicians today, Frank gives plenty of credit to the muscians, the arrangers and most importantly the songwriters on nearly every track. Nice, but not great.

Disc 3:  11-19-11 - 4.0 - ""Frank Sinatra:  Ol' Blue Eyes Is Back"" (1973) - After a 2 year retirement, Sinatra returns to the music scene with a new album and this television special on NBC which aired November 18, 1973.  Backed by his usual musical directors Gordon Jenkins and Don Costa, Frank is in top form.  He eschews covering the pop tunes of the day for more traditional fare in which he excels.  The best songs are ""You Will Be My Music"", ""Last Night When We Were Young"" and ""Send In The Clowns"".  His guest star was Gene Kelly and they reminisce with clips from a couple films they made in the 1940's.  Frank at 58 and Gene at 61 do a pretty good job dancing, with Kelly taking it a bit further while Sinatra sings.  The 2.0 channel sound is very good but the picture is borderline terrible.  The colors come and go; there is evident tape streaking and a generally fuzzy picture.  Frank performs in front of a small formal audience.  I noticed the following in the crowd:  Sargent and Eunice Kennedy Shriver, actor Richard Conti, Lucille Ball, Sammy Davis, Jr., Dick VanDyke, Lady Bird Johnson, Milton Berle and Fred Astaire.  In spite of the video quality, this is one of Sinatra's better TV performances.

12-28-11 - 3.0 - ""Sinatra: The Main Event"" (1974) - Broadcasting legend Howard Cosell opens this ABC television special that aired live October 13, 1974.  Produced by Roone Arledge and Jerry Weintraub it had a heavyweight boxing flare.  Sinatra comes out just like the fighters do with sidemen clearing the way.  The stage is ring sized and sits in the middle of New York's Madison Square Garden with 20,000 in attendance.  Early on, the crowd even sounds like they are at a fight or perhaps even a Rolling Stones concert.  This event is a visual upgrade from some of the others in the ""The Concert Collection"" set.  It looks pretty good on disc and the sound is fine.  Playing to the audience, Sinatra spends most of his time performing his more famous songs (""My Way"", ""I Get a Kick Out of You"", ""The Lady is a Tramp"" or as Frank sings, the lady is replaced with ""chick"" or ""broad"").  Now pushing 60 Frank still sounds terrific and although a bit thicker in build, still looks strong.  Although commercial breaks are removed, we still get long applause after each song and a sometime lengthy introduction to the next.  Frank knocks it out of the park with ""Angel Eyes"" and actually gives an emotional rendition of ""My Way"" to close the show.  I found it a bit strange that in the second to last number, he chose ""My Kind of Town"" to sing in front of a NYC audience.  He's got some balls.

Disc 4:  1-8-12 - 4.0 - ""Sinatra in Concert at Royal Festival Hall"" (1970) - At age 55 Frank is still at his peak in this very good performance staged at London's Royal Festival Hall.  Hosted and introduced by Princess Grace of Monaco, his co-star in ""High Society"" (1956), Frank lights up the appreciative if quiet crowd of tuxedoed and bejeweled patrons.  Unfortunately the picture quality is pretty bad.  On a large screen, the picture is a bit fuzzy as was the original broadcast I suspect.  In close-ups you can see a blue halo around Frank's face.  The sound is fine in a Dolby Surround 2.0.  In addition to the usual suspects (""My Way"", ""My Kind of Town"", ""The Lady is a Tramp"") Frank sings 3 great songs he calls, ""Songs for Losers"" including ""I Get Along Without You Very Well"", ""Didn't We"" and ""One For My Baby"".  For the last one, he goes into full acting mode.  Frank challenges himself with a strong performance of ""I Have Dreamed"" from ""The King and I.""  It is very powerful.  This concert was a benefit and was televised by the BBC.  After this tour, Frank went into brief retirement.  It is one of the best of this package and has rarely been seen.

Disc 4:  2-6-12 - 4.5 - ""Sinatra in Japan: Live at the Budokan Hall, Tokyo"" (1985) - This is a rare video of a performance recorded only for Japanese television as near as I can determine.  While the video quality is again not very good, the audio this time is in 5.1 Dolby Digital as opposed to the usual 2.0.  The picture for television is in 1.33:1 aspect ratio and shows the usual halo effect around the images.  Frank places himself as usual on a stage centered in the large auditorium surrounded by the quiet and respectful Japanese audience.  The travelling musicians are but a few consisting of the key solo performers.  The orchestra is mostly composed of local Japanese and in total the band is terrific.  This may be Frank's best concert of this series.  Even at 69, he looks good and sounds great.  You can see he is pumped up for this show which consists almost entirely of songs performed hundreds of times before.  He butchers ""Mack the Knife"" with impromptu lyrics but soars on some of his classics.  The best are ""Something"", I Get a Kick out of You"", ""Someone to Watch Over Me"", and ""One for my Baby.""  This later song is the only time, Frank goes into saloon mode.  As he often does, Sinatra introduces each song including the songwriter and the arranger.  Classy guy and an artfully directed show.

Disc 5:  4-25-09 - 3.5 - ""Francis Albert Sinatra Does His Thing"" ((1968) - This a 1968 television special showing off Frank in good, if foolish form.  Again, a stark, mostly white and bright set.  Yes, an audience, but they are rarely seen and of course, the applause is canned.  This episode is heightened by the presence of Diahann Carroll who does a couple nice numbers.  I remember seeing this for the first time on TV way back when...she was barefoot.  Frank crosses the racial lines at the time by kissing her on the mouth and later plants kisses on Florence LaRue and yummy Marilyn McCoo.  Go get 'em Frank.  The bit with the now dated 5th D. is well, not so good.  Frank, as usual is best when he passes on the current songs of the time, and sticks with the classics (Chapter 7 medley) and ""Angel Eyes"" for example.

Disc 5:  5-29-12 - 4.5 - ""Sinatra"" (1969) - In the concluding chapter of the annual ""A Man and His Music"" TV special, a dapper ""young"" Frank opens right away with ""For Once In My Life"" in his cool double breasted suit.  This transfer like most in the collection is of television quality of the era.  The sound is basic analog but is always very good.  My biggest criticism is that once again the audience is invisible except for the canned applause and laughter that goes away on queue.  So lame.  What stands out here are the songs and Frank's delivery.  The best set is when he dons a sweater, sans audience reaction and beautifully performs ""A Man Alone"" (his just released album at the time), the great ""Didn't We"" and ""Forgot to Remember.""  Frank, in his usual self-deprecating way also shows some vintage movie clips of his earlier, bad films.  They're pretty funny.  I think this is my favorite of the ""Primetime"" disc.

Disc 5:  5-29-12 - 4.0 - ""Sinatra and Friends"" (1977) - This TV special is loaded with stars of the era and Frank runs the genre gamut.  From classical/opera there is Robert Merrill, from country there is Loretta Lynn, from folk/pop there is John Denver, from R & B was young Natalie Cole, from Broadway, Leslie Uggams, from jazz/traditional, Tony Bennett and then there was Frank's Rat Pack buddy, Dean Martin.  Each gets a chance to do their own thing as well as duet with Frank.  Biggest surprise?  Loretta Lynn, seem pretty comfortable singing ""All or Nothing At All.""  Uggams was great on ""I Honestly Love You.""  The video was a bit better with sharper color, but it is 1977 so that should be expected.  This was a very good show that could have been better with a bit more rehearsal time.

Disc 6:  1-29-11 - 4.0 - ""Concert for the Americas"" (1982) - In the dawn of pay television, Showtime produced this 90 minute concert from The Dominican Republic.  Sinatra was pushing 70 if my math is correct, but still had his wits, voice and eyesight as near as I can tell.  His songs include many of the standards that he clearly is famous for.  As a fan, I'd just as soon skip many of these and hear some new old stuff.  For my money Sinatra is at his best as the saloon singer that he clearly enjoys.  I could do without Frank's attempt at being cool, what with the ""Cu Cu's"" and ""Jack"" slang that he would throw in many songs.  Frank...you're cool without this crap!  There's plenty of bland stuff (Strangers in the Night, My Kind of Town...enough already), but I loved the two songs at the end he did with guitarist Tony Mattola (Send in the Clowns, Quiet Night of Quiet Stars).  Also Buddy Rich at the end of his life as it turns out, blisters his one song set.

Disc 7:  8-16-12 - 4.5 - ""Bonus Disc: Happy Holidays with Bing and Frank, Vintage Sinatra, TV Performances"" (1957 - 2003) - This bonus disc contains some of the worst video and audio in the entire collection, yet it may be my favorite.  The first feature is a 30 minute Christmas special with just Bing Crosby and Frank.  Frank also directed and insisted on Crosby getting top billing.  It aired on ABC on December 20, 1957 in living color no less, rare for the day.  Bing and Frank start out alone in Frank's ""house,"" then join some carollers in turn of the century garb.  The show ends with what else, ""White Christmas,"" with Frank joining end on the second verse.  Two great crooners in their prime.  The second feature is a PBS documentary shown on August 2, 2003.  Frank's children, Frank, Jr., Nancy and Tina are interviewed between clips from Frank's late 50's TV show.  The clips are in grainy black and white on various sparse sets with noisy audio.  Actually, Tina gave some of the best info and seemed most comfortable talking about her dad.  Loaded with great songs including the knockout ""The House I Live In.""  Have you ever heard anyone else sing this song?  Finally, not mentioned at all in the enclosed booklet are 10 songs that appear to be from Frank's TV show, tied together non-stop with just Frank and his cigarette...and an occasional cutie.  No chit-chat, no jokes.  Terrible quality both video and audio but some of my favorite stuff in this package.",1345075200,7,15082,4.511267085334318
4242006,5,B0041FQWF2,"This entire concert set is certainly a blast and maybe even a must for Sinatra fans and completists.  I include myself on both counts, but I would have some reservations about relying exclusively upon these discs to make the case, as more knowledgeable scholars than I have, that Frank Sinatra, more than any other single artist, was responsible for creating the ""Great American Songbook"" (the best material between 1920 and 1960 from the pens of Berlin, Gershwin, Arlen, Ellington, Porter, Rodgers, Van Heusen, etc.).

There was no better ticket than the one to a Sinatra concert from the mid-sixties to the mid-'80s.  The electricity in the air of each of the 6 concerts I attended was palpable, indescribable, unforgettable--but that special magic distinguishing a Sinatra performance did not always come across on the television screen or on the recorded video documents of his live performances.  It's stretching matters considerably, for example, to claim that the disc commemorating his ""comeback"" on a Sunday night ""live"" telecast from Madison Square Garden ""proves"" that ""Sinatra hadn't lost a thing.""  As witnessed on that Sunday night, it was more than a little apparent to many that, despite the crowd noise and gratuitous hype of announcer Howard Cosell, Ole Blue was not in the best  of voice.  Three of the concerts in this set are consummate if late Sinatra, the others considerably less so (though the television special with Bing Crosby is a little-known, underrated gem).  Fortunately, a final concert--with Sammy Davis, Jr. and Liza Minnelli (filling in for Dean Martin who, after 4 stops in the tour, had gone AWOL)--never made it from tape to DVD and is not included in this collection.

The description of this collection refers to Sinatra as the ""Chairman,"" an association which, along with the designation ""Rat Pack,"" Sinatra himself rejected by the late '80s.  Too many of his new fans had identified with his later ""Vegas persona"" at the expense of his '40s sobriquet as ""The Voice"" and his reputation, during the '50s collaborations with Nelson Riddle on Capitol, as the most sensitive interpreter of the very best American popular music by its greatest composers, as an artist who placed his personal stamp upon that body of work while elevating it from popular ephemera to timeless art.  He was the ""Master Storyteller,"" an artist, interpreter, actor, musician and entertainer unmatched in the history of 20th century American music.  No one confronted the most personal material (the pain of memory, aging, death) more courageously and unflinchingly than Sinatra; no one swung harder--he was the consummate jazz singer.  Yet he did more than perform ""for"" us; he invited each of us to share ""with"" him in a universal experience--like Shakespeare, he adhered to the highest artistic standards while allowing us to feel we were having a ball thanks to the infectious entertainment only he could offer.

Ideally, the concerts of this collection would come at the end of a course in the music of Frank Sinatra, the ""dessert"" following close study and concentrated listening, first, of his growth as a vocalist in the 1940s and, 2nd, the application of his skills and experience to music comprising the timeless Sinatra-Riddle collaborations of the 1950s.  But no doubt there will be others who, like me, discovered Sinatra during his last, least seminal, period--the Reprise years.  From there, it isn't such a laborious exercise to take on the albums of the '50s followed by ""serious"" listening to the music of America's first ""matinee idol""--a popular phenomenon who can only become all the more human and admirable to those of us not blinded by the mindless infatuation of a 1940s ""bobby soxer.""",1341878400,,3725,5.1019736842105265

He's been gone since 1998 and he's STILL the coolest cat in the room. So you pair the two together and you wind up with this DVD set, which you SHOULD NOT hesitate in buying.

Here you have a collection of the finest television specials from an era when television was special. They don't make them like this anymore and to actually find a collection like this on DVD. Well. It's truly remarkable.

So order this set .. today.. right now. When it arrives, turn down the lights. Stir up a martini.. or two and toss the first disc in the skimmer.

4242017,5,B0041FQWF2,"This set gave me so many hours of enjoyment I'm not sure where to start. Sure, most of this stuff was out previously, but new Frank-o-philes are born every day, and the single discs became cost prohibitive, so I was glad to get them.

While there are several concerts like the Main Event, the heart of the work is the TV specials, with guest stars galore. In Ol' Blue Eyes is Back with Gene Kelly (Frank's comeback, and Gene's return to work after his wife's death)the dancing grandpas still had it, even though their song claimed they didn't!

The gem special would have to be the third Man and His Music special with Ella and Carlos. The smooth bossa nova section is worth the price of admission, but just watching the look on Frank's face as Ella scatted is priceless. You'd think he was celebrating Christmas at Disneyland, he enjoyed it so much. But they were both upstaged by the breathtaking Ol' Man River. Frank was at his best when the material challenged him, and he conquered it like Everest.

Guest stars throughout all the sets like John Denver and Robert Merrill are fun (though the disco version of ""All Or Nothing At All"" with Loretta Lynn is just plain wierd.)  But it's just Frank singing the classics that give you chills, like ""Moonlight In Vermont"" ""Fly Me to the Moon"" (especially poignant on the 1969 special)and ""Witchcraft,"" and well, pick a favorite and it's probably here somewhere. There's also several discs of assorted TV performances starting in the 1950's. My only beef is I'd like a few more details about where these came from, and a little less randomness.

Being a Sinatra fan since the Pal Joey movie days of the late 1950s, I already had most of the concerts on VHS. And, I was in the audience at London's Royal Festival Hall gig, which was the first of twelve live concerts in which I saw Sinatra over the years.
I am glad to have the boxed set, but a little dissapointed that the tapes were not cleaned and re-mastered better. As it is they are the same as the original VHS tapes. Maybe one day they will be re-issued totally re-mastered.
However, not withstanding the quality, for anyone who did not see the original tapes or the TV shows, this boxed set is essential to have, an amazing record of Mr Sinatra's work both on television and in the concert hall.

The way the TV specials are organized doesn't always make sense (i.e., ""Ol Blue Eyes Is Back"" thrown onto a disc with 3 live concerts called ""Around the World""); and the picture quality isn't as much an improvement over the VHS tapes as I hoped.

The disc of features is of extra interest in that it includes a 26 minute Christmas show with Bing Crosby, and a review of Frank's life,""Vintage Sinatra"", with recent observations by Frank's 3 ""children"": Nancy, Tina an Frank Jr. Overall, a very good set.",1295481600,2,464,4.8125

One you start a disk it is hard to not finish. It is everything the reviews have said about it and more.  The book that comes with it is very helpful in identifing the songs and years they are from and the guests that also are on the disks.",1294963200,,431,4.047058823529412

4242035,5,B0041FQWF2,"All of the raves are right. Plenty of bang for your buck,especially if the box is discounted. But I have a quibble here. It is not something I want to put into the one star bin and drop the percentage of well-deserving raves. Nothing in this set is close captioned,nor SDH,an inferior(no black box) but industry controlled system. Now,as some critics after my comments about CC have said-why look at music being played if you can't hear it anyway? Well,I'm not the one with the hearing problem;it is my ever loving wife. And she is not deaf,just hearing impaired. And yes,much of the instrumental backing(e.g.-Tony Mottola's work on the Concert of the Americas)simply does not exist for her. But she knows the classic American Songbook,has loved Frank in the past(we played ""My Shining Hour"" from ""Trilogy"" at our wedding as my choice to her after first playing it for her and proposing). Nancy Sinatra has a fine online fan forum ,but to participate,you must use a real photo of self as avatar-that's not gonna happen. Frank Sinatra Enterprises is now a separate company(like Elvis) made up of the family,Charles Pignone and Warner Music Group but getting through to these people is tough. Maybe a simple review on Amazon will get some attention,especially one that doesn't knock what they have done but is saddened at what they haven't done. With this box,most of the crown jewels of Frank visually(movies &TV)are out there. These packages always have a built in selling spot for the elderly, many of whom have hearing issues;one would think this subject comes up in planning. Cost cannot be a factor,as they spend a bundle on many other parts of the package. A class act tarnished a bit by poor planning.",1293840000,,1707,4.8493150684931505

4242038,5,B0041FQWF2,"Frank was always in great voice for his TV specials in the 60s, a few of which are included here. The first one, in 1965, is memorable, because it was taped at night: Frank drove up in a convertible on a lighted street in L.A., got out wearing the famous hat and raincoat over his shoulder, walked down an alley through a door directly onto a soundstage, and began singing ""I've Got You Under my Skin"" next to Nelson Riddle and his Orchestra. Great entrance. Other highlights for me include the Ella-Jobim TV special in the late 60s and the 1981 TV special with Basie, where he does ""I Get a Kick Out of You"" as he did in the classic ""Young Lovers"" album of the early 50s--with verse and jazz combo backing. He ends the show with a tribute to the musicians who have played for him over the years--accompanied by Gordon Jenkins and a large string orchestra, who return the favor by tapping their instruments. I taped that show directly off TV at that time.

This is a nice collection, but there are more. What about Frank's 1962 world tour? The concert in Royal Albert Hall and the Tokyo concerts? Videotapes of those concerts exist. There are also concerts taped by Australian TV in the late 50s.",1293148800,,1196,4.461187214611872

4242040,5,B0041FQWF2,"There isn't really any more that I can add to what everyone else has already said other than the fact that I feel very privileged just to own this collection. Truth be told, I'd a paid much more than the asking price. In fact, I did pay on Ebay for only one Sinatra concert/show, what this entire set goes for on Amazon. This concert collection is a bargain with many hours of great and varied full length performances from Mr Sinatra. This is not the same thing over and over...If you or somebody you know is a fan, this purchase is a no-brainer Pally. My only negative is that some of the DVD's are so-so when it comes to video quality. As I have learned, this is just the way it is when it comes to older concerts, like Sinatras'. None of these are bad, just don't expect HD quality. Overall a strong 5 stars, athough a couple would be closer to 3 stars.

Update: IMO, I think it's a toss up between the America's concert DVD and the Vegas Box set's concert DVD(a different release) when it comes to the best video quality available of a Sinatra concert. Either of these should be acceptable to even the harshest critic, all things considered. They look good on my 82"" tv. Don't expect great. Frank and the music is what is great, the video is just ""good"".",1291593600,4,1259,4.334745762711864
4242041,2,B0041FQWF2,"Video quality on the older shows is quite fuzzy and poor looking. I've seen other material from this era that looked so much better. Performance and content are superb but marred by substandard picture quality. Not a HD selection!

4242044,5,B0041FQWF2,"I did not grow up a Sinatra fan...he was my mom's guy while I was a Beatles and Zeppelin era baby boomer. That said....I learned about the greats of songwriting by listening over and over to his music that my mom had in constant rotation in her home and learned that in most every case HIS was the definitive  version...from Cole Porter on.

The first brace of programs on this well constructed and lovely set (SHOUT Factory really seems to hit everything they do right on the button and right out of the park) were previously released on woefully short single DVDs by Warner Bros  and I'm very familiar with the programs  and they vary in quality from must have to alright. The revelation for me on this set begins with ""Concert For The Americas"" which is a brilliantly executed and performed 90 minute set from the Dominican Republic in 1982 which finds the Chairman of the Board in great voice and seemingly on top of his game...for this era. He is not  only in good voice he is clear headed  ...crediting the songwriters and arrangers and just  seemingly out to make  a statement. And speaking of statements...his band/orchestra is killer and the drum solo that Buddy Rich takes on the Jet Song from West Side Story smokes just about every drum solo I've sat through over the years from the hundreds of rock  concerts I've been to ...the guys tears it up!

 The next  big treat is  the bonus disc with over 3 hours of goodies stretching back into the big Capital Years era of the 50's (His peak in my opinion).

Why did I pick this up? Well..my mom passed away this summer and for some  crazy reason listening to Mr Sinatra doesn't  make me sad but seems to make me feel close to her. The best thing I  can say about this set is that SHE would have loved it..over and over...her favorite was with Ella and Jobim.

How can it be less than 5 stars?",1289088000,60,1850,4.407079646017699
4242045,5,B0041FQWF2,"Just received mine yesterday and have already watched the first 7 specials. Had to take a break to share my enthusiasm for this incredible collection!

The picture and sound quality are fantastic, a huge upgrade over the early 2000s releases. And the packaging is beautiful, with gorgeous photos and terrific liner notes by Bill Zehme. The notes say that Sinatra didn't much care for making these specials, but you'd never know it by the incredible performances contained on these DVDs.  Name a favorite Sinatra song of yours, and I can pretty much guarantee it's on here.

This is a must have for any real Sinatra fan, and a great gift for any Sinatra lover on your Christmas list.

4242047,2,B0041FQWF2,"I have the original DVDs of these performances. Those DVDs were taken from the VHS masters that came out in 1990. The original DVDs had just average picture quality, so I bought this new set expecting a visual upgrade, since the last transfer was done 20 years ago. I am so disappointed in this set...the picture, and sound, quality is exactly the same as it was on the original DVD set. It's in stereo, not 5.1 sound, and the picture still looks like a VHS tape.

The performances on the 1st DVD are terrific, don't get me wrong. The Royal Albert Hall show is great, as is the bonus disc. The rest of the discs are totally dispensable.

So if you've got the original DVDs, don't bother getting this set. I'll be returning mine.",1288915200,37,728,4.425373134328358
4242048,5,B0041FQWF2,"The collection arrived today, October 26th, and just skimming through the DVDs is a thrill. Firstly, the packaging is consistently stunning; goodbye to the easy-to-smash cardboard/plastic packaging when some of these DVDs were released in the 1990s. Oh, and goodbye to those hyper-expensive out-of-print DVDs! Those 50 minute-long DVDs have been replaced by discs that average 2 hours each (The bonus disc is roughly two and a half hours long). The menus are very stylish and the booklet that accompanies the collection is well done. Someone got the message and the collection is well laid out and impeccably presented. The image quality is not Hi-Def, of course, and there's only so much that can be done to spruce up video tape. Still, the colours are vivid.

About that bonus DVD: besides including assorted early televison clips and a terrific PBS documentary with commentary by his children, there's a half hour Christmas special with Sinatra and Bing Crosby. This was filmed on motion picture stock, directed by Sinatra (!), with musical arrangements by Nelson Riddle, and - although filmed in 1957 for television - is in something resembling Technicolour; it has a colour palette of green-red-blue that reminds me of ancient Kodacolor family slides and home movies done on Ektachrome stock. Considering how regular colour television broadcasting was about a decade away, someone was thinking ahead. Well, there's your Sinatra Holiday Special, Clyde, complete with Sinatra and Crosby: hitting the toddies and, briefly, in Dickensian dress. It's Ring-a-Ding-Ding traditional - like a Christmas party on the set of ""High Society,"" and so old fashioned I hope it winds up as a separate DVD, someday.

The other DVDs are great, too. Take your pick as to which YOU want to call his greatest. At $55.99 for 14 hours of footage covering 30 years of his life, this is a brilliant Sinatra release. You have hours of him in those television productions he never completely warmed up to as well as hours and hours of him absolutely live - the way he liked it.
