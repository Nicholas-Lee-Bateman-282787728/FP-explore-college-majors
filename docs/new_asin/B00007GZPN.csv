1810255,5,B00007GZPN,The product arrived in a timely fashion and I enjoyed watching the movies. I would purchase from seller again in the future.,1358899200,,124,4.681818181818182
1810256,5,B00007GZPN,"These three movies share a title, the names of the main characters, but little else.  Robert Kubiles directs both II and 3 but that's about it as far as creative continuity goes.  That these 3 DVDs are packaged together is more of a testament to the marketing ability of the production company than any kind of artistic vision.  I did not know that II and 3 even existed before stumbling across this in Amazon.

The original Embrace The Darkness was a late night staple of turn-of-the-century Skinemax.  Madison Clark made quite an impression in her brief late-90s acting career.  This was her only starring role and she manages to exude innocence, curiosity, and sensuality in portraying Jennifer, the beautiful dancer/performance artist who attracts the attention of tortured vampire Galen, played by Kevin Spirtas.

Having been previously unaware of II and 3, I was really only paying the $29.99 for the first film and I would say it is worth it since Madison Clark is so exceptionally beautiful (and otherwise unavailable on DVD in a leading role) and there really is no other way to acquire this DVD by itself.

By the way, the Product Description attached to this DVD set talks about ""four provocative shorts from France's most acclaimed young director"".  This seems to be cut and pasted from some other DVD as this has nothing to do with that.

So the package was a great purchase.  I got one movie that I enjoyed seeing again and two others that had lots of beautiful women (and passable vampire special effects).  Amazon.com delivery time was exceptional.  Four days to Hawaii.  Borders.com usually takes at least two weeks.",1309996800,2,1633,4.869565217391305

1810260,4,B00007GZPN,"This three pack is a good bargain. You get three softcore videos that follow the adventures of Jennifer from her humble beginnings as a really bad performance artist to being a really bad vampire. The first two videos are good, the third is great. Each one has boatloads of explicit sex and naked women.

7976529,5,B00007GZPN,"Bought this because someone I knew was one of the actor's in the film.  Some yrs. ago, I was attending a Media Convention in New York City.
One of the guest's was a young lady by the name of Tiffany Shepis, Ms Shepis was and is an extremely attractive and well put together young woman.  She has starred in a number of Horror films, and continues to act.  The series; ""Embrace the Darkness"" is primarily a vampiric soap opera.
Each episode is a story separated by an arc of horror and suspense.  The entire series is well written, the actors are very good to look at, the horror that is the main story line is well done.",1483747200,,620,4.273504273504273

7976532,5,B00007GZPN,"These are fun movies to watch with a friend or alone. The main characters are portrayed very well by the actors. Not cheesy actors off the park bench. The series caught my attention on Showtime a while back and I have had them on my wish list for a while.
The movies are not at all gory and the sex scenes are very tasteful and exciting.
The characters in each movie have similar traits, but I would not say each movie is the same. One does not have to watch them in order or all of them to enjoy the story and the rest of the movie as well. The second movie is by far the best Renee Rea is super hot in this movie and has been one of my favorites for sometime now.
The plots are not all that complicated and are geared toward fun and excitement not substance, even so they are NOT poorly done.",1403136000,,794,4.031645569620253

7976534,1,B00007GZPN,"""Embrace the Darkness: The Complete Collector's Set
This was made by Playboy. The acting was substandard as well as the stories. If I knew this was an adult themed show made by Playboy, I would NOT have purchased it. It was thrown in the trash. I couldn't even think of a guy to give it to that might appreciate the sex scenes, but they were awful as well. There was no sensuality whatsoever. As for ""the animal"" aspect to sex...a dead cat has more imagination. Don't waste your money or time!!",1386374400,2,494,4.43956043956044
