7981280,5,B00003L9AB,"I'm 19 years old and bored by most Barney episodes but this one has to be the exception.

In case you haven't figured out already, the words ""Once Upon a Time"" prompt a visit from Stella the Storyteller. Her suitcase of props explodes and Barney, Baby Bop, Carlos, Kristen, Shawn, and Tosha help her repack it. While doing this, the costumed children and dinos act out (in this order): Rumpelstiltskin, Rapunzel, and Goldielocks and the Three Bears.

Like all the Barney videos, this one has songs. My favorites are ""The Spinning Wheel"", ""John Jacob Jingleheimer Smith"", ""Castles So High,"" and ""Does Your Hair Hang Low"". (This is the order the songs are sung in.)

I have watched this video several times, and it holds my interest till the end.",1132704000,,744,4.751937984496124
