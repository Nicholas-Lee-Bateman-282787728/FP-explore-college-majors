8359553,5,B002AJWM5K,I found Single very interesting because it connects all the dots about being single in a humorous and non-judgemental way. I am married but my children are not and it showed me just how much the dating game has changed since I was dating. The film is relevant to everyone whether in a relationship or not. It is thought-provoking and generates a lot of conversation.,1253491200,4,366,4.6461538461538465
