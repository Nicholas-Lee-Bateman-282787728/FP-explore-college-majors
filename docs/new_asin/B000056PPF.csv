1399347,5,B000056PPF,"The smallness of the theater and set accentuate Rossini's delicate music.  The singers are all very good, committed and believable in this crazy story.  The conducting and orchestral sound are outstanding.  A delightful DVD.",1120435200,7,224,5.529411764705882
1399348,3,B000056PPF,"I suppose what the other reader reviews have said is true, BUT:
I was unimpressed by the small stage, scenery, and the acting.
If you turn off the video to just hear the music, you will be treated to an inordinate amount of foot shuffling and strange bangings from the chorus.
I've watched it three times and my opinion remains the same.",1020643200,16,337,4.451612903225806
1399349,5,B000056PPF,"L'Italiana in Algeri is Rossini at his very best. First performed in Venice in 1813 when Rossini was but 21 years old, this most enchanting opera buffa soon took Europe by storm. Arthaus offers a production conducted by Ralf Weikert that captures magnificently the hilarity and madness of Rossini's first comic masterpiece. The singers and orchestra are magnificent, as are the costumes, sets and props--the live monkey adds a most comical touch! Watching the act 1 finale alone is worth the price of this DVD. Without doubt this would be a terrific first opera for the opera curioius, especially for anyone thinking that opera is always tragic and deadly serious. This production is a real treat, and only gets better with repeated viewings. A bubbling performance all around!",998697600,30,777,5.078125
1399350,5,B000056PPF,"The series of operas from the Schwetzinger Festival being released on the ARTHAUS label is proving to be a series of pearls, and this production is no exception. From the opening bars of the overture the RSO Stuttgart and the conductor Ralf Weikert play with such energy and warmth they sound as though they have all just returned from a holiday in southern Italy.  The direction, as always with Michael Hampe, has the advantage of always keeping the action moving and has some truly inspired moments, especially the hilarious Finale of Act 1.  Each of the singers has been chosen not only for their singing, but also for their acting, suitability for their role and their ability to be a member of a true ensemble.  Doris Soffel truly shines as Isabella (this was 1987, pre Cecelia Bartoli), Robert Gambill is a Rossini tenor blessed with great beauty of tone and flexibility which is only slightly marred some pushing at the extreme top of his range, and Enric Serra is a baritone with the everything it takes to make Taddeo both humorous and yet strangely appealing.  Gunther von Kannen is truly fabulous as Mustafa in terms of tone colour and his inspired, yet not over the top, comic acting, it is therefore a great shame that his voice is just not flexible enough to cope with the coloratura demands of the role.  His uncredited side-kick is a hoot as well - but you'll have to buy this one to find out what I mean.  Do yourself a favour!  This DVD is a real winner that I dare you not to enjoy.",992390400,29,1501,4.537037037037037
1399351,3,B000056PPF,"This is a good video if you are expecting for a visual, scenic and theatrical show.  Colours, costumes and scens.  They do a really ""folie organise"" (organized madness) whose Stendhal spoke. Humor, just humor you can find in this, I repeat, coloured video. But, there is two exceptions: Nucia Focile and Doris Soffel, they do a great work, better than versions like Valentini- Terrani's.",978134400,15,387,5.03125
7932551,5,B000056PPF,"This is a lively wonderful production of the Italian Girl in Algeri done on a moderate sized stage. Doris Soffel and the cast are great, including the monkey. The best production I think is the MET with Horne. Yet, both version are great and have slightly different emphasis in the production. But, both are traditional. Both are riot to watch.",1514764800,,344,4.75

7932554,5,B000056PPF,"This production of L'Italiana in Algeri is my all time favorite opera.  It gets better with each subsequent viewing as the total combination of the music, acting, singing, costumes literally takes your breath away.  The Orchestra was outstanding and that adjective applies to every aspect of this wonderfully delightful production of this Comic Opera.  Kudos to the performers, designers, directors, and all who made this masterpiece that would make Rossini proud.  And as for the Grand Sultana's little helper, as far as I'm concerned, that was a stroke of genius as opposed to the distraction for some which certainly wasn't the case for my family.  I highly recommend this opera. You will not be disappointed.  Some of the best ensemble work duets, trios, quartets, quintets, sextets, and a chorus that I've ever seen in regard to a Rossini production anywhere, and I've seen just about all of them.  So enjoy!",1423612800,,913,5.046666666666667
7932555,4,B000056PPF,"I discovered this version of the opera in VHS format some years ago at my local library and fell in love with the performance. When I saw it in DVD format, I leaped at the chance to buy it.

I'd never heard of any of the singers when I bought it, though other Amazon reviews imply that I should. For my non-expert ears, the singing is wonderful (including Gnter von Kannen as the Bey, whose coloratura takes several hits in other reviews). What makes this production giddily delightful is the acting. The performers seem to be having fun, and also have a SENSE of fun. Particularly amusing is the male chorus of eunuchs (who, oddly, include bassos), clearly instructed to make astonished/horrified/delighted faces as they listen to a solo aria or duet.

The performers also look their parts, though I didn't care for Doris Soffel's odd hairdo. The costumes are gorgeous, and the set, with its rippling ""sea"" in the background looks lush. As a Rossini fan, I was happy with the tempi of conductor Ralf Weikert.

Alas, there's the monkey. Not a real monkey, an actress in a monkey suit (with fez!) who, for no apparent reason, is forever scampering around the stage and pawing at the performers. If you can get past the monkey, you may also fall in love with this production.",1359158400,,1273,4.648888888888889
7932556,4,B000056PPF,"This 1993 production of Rossini's lively comic opera from the Schwetzinger Festspiele features opulent costumes and beautiful sets, even though the stage is rather small.  I was especially taken by the shimmering blue sea that serves as the backdrop for all of the acts.

Doris Soffel, a German coloratura mezzo with an international career does a fine job of singing and acting the part of the wily Isabella.  She began her musical career as a violinist, and treats Rossini with wit and reverence, instead of trying to vamp her way through his score.  She is also quite beautiful (except for the frizzy red wig), and it is easy to understand why the Bey of Algiers immediately fell for her.

Those of us who listen to the Saturday afternoon Met broadcasts have been spoiled by Peruvian tenor Juan Diego Flrez, singing the role of Lindoro.  Nevertheless, Robert Gambill sings a credible, good-looking lover, who has to compete with a chain-rattling fake monkey during his buffa duet with Mustaf concerning the attributes of his future wife (I really wish this production had lost the monkey.)

Actually, the monkey might have been introduced in order to take our attention away from Mustaf's singing, which wasn't very good.  Let's just say that Gnther von Kannen looked the part of the Bey, and made an extremely funny Pappataci candidate.  He boomed out his part in the 'Clock' septet with appropriate gusto to end Act 1.  The only aria that is really hard on the ears is ""Gi d'insolito ardore,"" where Mustaf brags about his studly prowess.  What can I say, though?  Sam Ramey is the only Mustaf amongst my ten versions of 'The Italian Girl' who really sings this rather difficult coloratura aria, rather than trying to bluff his way through it.

Bass Enrique Serra performs the thankless role of Isabella's clueless suitor with some witty touches of his own, such as his employment of a snuff box in Act I.

The Bulgarian Male Chorus sings with strength and enthusiasm--definitely not this opera's standard eunuchs!  They march about on stage, clashing swords, waving flags, mugging at Isabella, and generally having a robust outing.  They are louder and darker than most choruses in 'The Italian Girl' but I enjoyed their singing (not so much their mugging).  They had a great time 'making horns' all the way through the 'Pappataci' chorus.

The English subtitles are wittier than those in my other versions of this superb comic opera.  I just wish someone had shot the monkey.",1330214400,2,2481,4.892344497607655
7932557,3,B000056PPF,"It's a real pity that the Met did not make a DVD for sale from the production with Juan Diego Florez and Olga Borodina in 2004. The two were super in all respects. It was surprising to find that Borodina with her heavy voluptuous voice could navigate the coloratura so well, but there it was. She was great. Better than Horne in her recording.",1326067200,2,343,4.375
7932558,5,B000056PPF,"This was my first exposure to this opera.  I was scheduled to see a live performance and I wanted a preview before I saw the live production.  As my son put it, ""Rossini put the slap in slap stick.""  I didn't hear any familiar Rossini arias, but the whole work was well worth the purchase.  None of the cast nor the conductor were known to me, but the work was well done and thoroughly enjoyable.  It should be known that Maria Callas made her US debut in this work for the first production of the Dallas Opera.",1252713600,4,511,4.22680412371134
7932559,4,B000056PPF,"This is a small, beautifully designed, lovingly executed production, helmed by two talented young singers.  No expense has been spared (particularly with the costumes) and director Michael Hampe obviously has a great affection for and understanding of the material.  His command of the stage action is perfectly matched by conductor Ralf Weikert's jaunty conducting.  Doris Soffel makes a spirited Isabella, and one can certainly understand why she's pining for Lindoro, as played by the boyish, slightly goofy Robert Gambill.  They both sing beautifully, although now and then I did worry that Gambill's delicate voice wouldn't make it through the performance.  (Watching young singers such as these struggle a bit really makes you appreciate the power and skills of true opera stars.)  Gunther von Kannen is amusing enough as Mustafa, although the voice, unfortunately, is all bellow.  You may want to wait to see if a starrier ""L'Italiana"" comes out in future, but for now this a charming, more than professional example of a small company at its very, very best.",1143504000,7,1066,5.235294117647059
7932560,4,B000056PPF,"This is a pretty nice video of this opera.  There is only one real disappointment:  The Mustafa has very little coloratura capabilities.  His voice is a pleasant deep bass.  The other singers all do fine with the coloratura requirements.  The Isabella has a strong edgy mezzo with nicely blended registers.  The Lindoro has a nice bright sound with easy high notes.  The Taddeo and Haly have pleasant voices.  The Elvira has a strong bright edgy soprano.  The sets are nice with realistic looking ocean in the background.  The costumes are nice.  My only qualm about the directing is the little guy dressed in a chimpanzee costume supposedly as a pet of the Mustafa - seemed a little distracting. All in all, this is a good representation of the opera, notwithstanding some of the Mustafa's singing.",1135468800,14,799,4.844444444444444
