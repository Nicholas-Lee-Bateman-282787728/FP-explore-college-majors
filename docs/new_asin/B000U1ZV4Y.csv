2915968,4,B000U1ZV4Y,"WARNER's EXTREME ACTION offers four examples of early to mid 1990s action films, including two by a couple of the genre's biggest stars: Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger.

SYNOPSES--

ERASER--  Witness Protection specialist with unorthodox ways is set up as the ""bad guy"" by corrupt co-workers. Arnold benefits from an excellent supporting cast.

THE LAST BOY SCOUT--  Ex-Secret Servicman turned detective buddies up with a former football QB whose girlfriend is murdered; a woman the private eye was hired to protect. Authored by ""Lethal Weapon"" scripter Shane Black, the film's last scene suggests a sequel-- perhaps the lack of on-screen chemistry between Willis and Wayans precluded that from happening.

PASSENGER 57--  Terrorist and his cohorts hijack a plane carrying an undercover security expert. (Originally intended as a Stallone vehicle.)

POINT OF NO RETURN--  A female drug addict condemed to die for a violent crime is recruited as a government assassin.

I could select from options...even though like the others (except Malone) I couldn't play on my DVD player without encountering 'check regional code' and with it continually ejecting, which makes it the last time I will ever buy a DVD off amazon, as seemingly, USA locks all its DVD plates, yet amazon sells them without unlocking them which is unfair and wrong",1432425600,,726,4.9105691056910565

I saw the Eraser and Passenger 57 when the films first came out, but I really enjoyed watching them again. The Last Boy Scout was  another outstanding Willis action film. Fonda's Point Of No Return the best female action film I have ever seen.

The only movie that's a part of this collection that I hadn't seen prior to this purchase was Passenger 57 and now that I see it twenty years after its release, it's still not that interesting.

I saw Eraser at the movies 17 years ago and I still love it.

The Last Boy Scout is my favorite Tony Scott movie and is written by Shane Black (Lethal Weapon, The Long Kiss Goodnight).

Point of No Return is a remake of Director Luc Besson's Nikita. I love the cast and John Badham does a great job at direction.",1367798400,3,629,4.216666666666667

Each movie is basically a fast action thriller that did reasonably well at the box office, the movies still don't dissapoint.

Be ready to sit through, or fast forward past way more trailers that are usual, a small price to pay for four high quality releases around $10.

Acting accross the board gets either 4 or 5 stars.
Set quality, hard to fault.
Storylines, believable for the most part. Entertaining? certainly.
Special effects, excellent, the only obviously ""not real"" I caught was one scene of ""'57""
Entertainment value, as an overall package, 5 stars.

I'm glad I bought them, not too much blood and guts, we'd call them all PG, meaning the youger ones can watch them.

Buy and enjoy, I did.",1323820800,2,804,4.633802816901408
2916162,4,B000U1ZV4Y,"Warners has released four films in a two DVD pack that are all in their original widescreen a/r and enhanced for 16X9 screens. Both are DDD's,Dreaded Double-sided Discs,so be warned and be on the look out for scratched or scuffed discs. On the bright side you get some quite decent action films all in one package and bound to delight most everyone into that genre.
First is the Ahhnold Schwarzenegger film Eraser(June/96),co starring Vanessa Williams,the former ""disgraced"" /84 Miss America who did a great job in her part in her very first acting role. Arnold works for the witness protection program and is responsible for seeing that his charges get their life""erased"",so to speak,enabling them to live a totally new and safe one. Williams has some important information and must be protected. Arnold takes charge of her,erasing her current life,but surprisingly there is a hit put out on her. His boss played menacingly by James Caan is as seemingly stunned at the turn of events as Arnold but we soon learn it is Caan who is the mole and Arnold and Vanessa must play a running game from him and his hired guns. Only when they have solid proof of Caan's involvement,do they finally seek out the help of the top man in the organization(the only one Arnold will truly trust)played by James Coburn. In the end the corruption is exposed and eliminated. Three and a half stars.
This movie is b/w The Last Boy Scout(Dec/91)and it finds Willis as a down and out private eye who hasn't had a decent case in quite some time. A""friend"" of Willis gives him a lead onto a job to look after a stripper played by a young Halle Berry in her 8th film;to be a kind of a bodyguard. Before Willis can get too far on the job he finds his ""friend"" has been having a ""time"" with his wife. As his friend leaves,his car gets blown up. Willis is questioned by the cops but let go. Willis assumes his job as bodyguard,attending the club Berry works at but her boyfriend misconstrues Willis' intentions(played by Daman Wayans).The two get into words and when Willis steps outside he is kidnapped. Meanwhile Berry and Wayans go home in separate cars and Berry gets shot to death along the way. It turns out Berry and Willis`kidnappers have something in common. Willis was kidnapped by the owner of a local football team who is trying to get gambling legalized and it is Berry who found out about this and was quieted. Now the owner is attempting to frame Willis for a set up to shoot the Governor. At a football game the Governor attends,Wayans and Willis work together and bring the bad guys to justice. 3 and a half stars.
The second DVD contains Passenger 57(Nov. 92).This film stars Wesley Snipes as the newly hired head of security for an airline. While on a flight,the plane is hijacked(watch for a very plain looking Elizabeth Hurley as one of the hijackers).Basically the rest of the plot revolves around Snipes trying to regain control of the aircraft and trying to subdue the hijackers,which he ultimately does. Three stars.
This film is backed with Point of No Return(Mar. 93),starring Bridget Fonda. As the film opens Bridget is part of a group of guys hopped up on drugs who break into a drug store. She ends up killing a cop and goes on trial. She is sentenced to death and we even see her funeral. However she has really been taken into a secret agency specializing in assassination. She is a diamond in the rough and with the help of agency personnel played by,among others,Anne Bancroft(lessons in manners) and her mentor played by Gabriel Byrne,she becomes a top notch assassin. Sent out into the real world to do her business she soon meets and falls in love with someone. Her job and her private collide continuously and in the end she is let go from the organization by a sympathetic Byrnes. Two and one half stars.
Eraser and the Last Boy Scout are the best movies in this pack,while Passenger 57 is about average with Point of no Return running in fourth place. The Last Boy Scout is the film I would say needs a remastering the most as it can get quite grainy at times. The others are much more acceptable,though not perfect.
All in all not a bad package of action films starring some top notch stars of today and yesterday. Get out the popcorn and enjoy.",1317427200,,4256,4.608695652173913

2916164,3,B000U1ZV4Y,"The reason I am giving this a 3 and not a 4, is because two movies come on the one DVD, so you have to flip it over to see the movies, and the writing is so fine, you have to search to ensure you are about the play the correct movie.

DVD's are cheap enough, they could have placed the movies on their own DVD",1307664000,,309,3.6818181818181817
2916165,5,B000U1ZV4Y,This is a must DVD to have if your an action movie fan. I think Last boyscout is one of Bruce Willis's best films. Point of no return is action packed. Passenger 57 and Eraser are also good movies.,1299369600,,197,4.076923076923077
2916166,4,B000U1ZV4Y,Point of No Return and The Last Boyscout are good enough reasons to grab this 4 pack and Eraser isn't too bad for an Arnold flick!  Passenger 57 is cheesy but 3 out of 4 aint bad.,1289088000,,179,3.8378378378378377
2916167,2,B000U1ZV4Y,"THE LAST BOY SCOUT, is in my opinion, one of the best straight-up action films ever made. Shane Black's script is hilarious, and Wayans actually can pull off the mismatched partner role. The film, directed by Tony Scott, is so over-the-top balls-out testosterone-fueled that it puts most of the films of this genre to shame. And Bruce Willis as Joe Hallenbeck is one of the coolest good guys ever. The set pieces are well-done, and the plot is so terrifically contrived that it's a super-duper cheesefest that harkens back to some of the great bad action films of the 80's. ""Hey, Milo... where ya callin' from, the bottom of the pool?""

However, the rest of these films are so awful that they defy belief that someone ever greenlighted them. ERASER is just so incredibly dull and uninteresting that not even Schwarzenegger's tough-guy charm can help ease the pain. PASSENGER 57 is the film that unfortunately rocketed Wesley Snipes to 'Name Above The Title' stardom, when he worked so much better in smaller roles in smaller films. Watch him in THE WATERDANCE or KING OF NEW YORK if you want to see Wesley in good films and good performances.

And then there's POINT OF NO RETURN, an almost shot-for-shot American remake of Luc Besson's brilliant spy-thriller LA FEMME NIKITA. Where NIKITA had the likes of Anne Parrilaud, Tcheky Karyo, Jean-Hughes Anglade and Jean Reno, POINT OF NO RETURN gets Bridget Fonda and Dermot Mulroney, two of the worst and most charmless actors to ever appear on screen, and Gabriel Byrne and Harvey Keitel totally phoning in their performances. POINT OF NO RETURN is not just a really awful Americanized remake, but it's a film that was so pathetic, it's one of the few films I've ever walked out on. For me, it ranks amongst the 5 worst films ever made.

Just buy THE LAST BOY SCOUT on its own and save your money and time on watching the rest of them.",1265500800,,1883,4.7
