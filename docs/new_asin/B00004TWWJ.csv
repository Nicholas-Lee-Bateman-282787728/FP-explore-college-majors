7923156,5,B00004TWWJ,"No wonder ""Kids & Animals"" won a Humanitarian Award. Tobias's Animal Planet film explores the nature of animals and healing. It is a marvel. Every member of Congress needs to see this film so as to ensure that insurance comnpanies pay for medical expenses associated with the embrace of animals as healers of children. This is a magical film, gorgeously, sensitively directed and written. A film for every school, for every student, for every teacher.",1322697600,,451,5.026666666666666
7923157,5,B00004TWWJ,"This video goes beyond the 'warm and fuzzy' approach of many programs about animal-assisted therapy. It provides an in-depth look at the ways animals can be incorporated into treatment programs for children. Providers featured in the video give important and enlightening insights into the ways the children and animals interact to form healthy, supportive relationships. I would recommend it for use in instructing human service providers in the critical role animals can play in helping children heal.",984873600,5,503,5.545454545454546
