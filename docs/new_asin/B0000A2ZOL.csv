1901543,5,B0000A2ZOL,"I really like these two workouts.  I do believe, however, that you need some background in yoga to really get the full benefit of the DVDs.  I, too, ordered both DVDs.  They were exactly the same.  They are not supposed to be the same, though.  It's a production mistake.  I sent back the Introductory Poses DVD and received the correct one from Amazon with a very sincere apology.",1075248000,5,381,4.529411764705882
1901544,2,B0000A2ZOL,"I teach Ashtanga yoga. Always looking for ideas, I bought this video intending to see how she explains and modifies some of the more difficult poses for beginners. I was both surprised and disappointed.
On the negative side, her voice is really annoying. While narrating the practice, she sounds exactly like the character ""Lilleth"" from Fraiser or Cheers: cold, serious, unapproachable, monotone. (In the interview section, when she is just talking, her voice is fine. I wish she had just been herself for the practice part of the video).
Then, the practice. Another negative. Ashtanga has a set series of poses. Always the same poses in the same order (the idea is the practice is the same so you can notice changes in yourself). She does not do the standard sun salutations but breaks them down into smaller components. OK, fine, beginner video. But I would like to see the option of just doing them AS THEY WOULD BE DONE IN ANY ASHTANGA CLASS IN THE WORLD, and that is not available.
Also, the flow. Breathing is an important part of Ashtanga. 5 breaths per pose. No fiddling around getting in and out of position or it will be over. She states up front (but not on the cover of the box) that each pose will be held longer for explanation time. Fine. But again, give us the regular Ashtanga flow as another option.
Modifications for beginners: I did not see a lot. This practice would totally discourage my beginning students who have tight hamstrings. She assumes everyone can put their palms flat on the floor but does not thoroughly explain what to do if you can't.
Included poses: Standing poses. What about the rest of primary series?
Hypocrisy: She tells the audience to relax (in that Lillith voice) but the sun is shining so brightly in her face that her eyebrows are pinched together. I can almost feel the tension coming through the screen!
Positives:
This is one of the few yoga DVDs that actually tries to make use of the medium's capabilities. When a special logo appears you can click and get more in depth information about the pose (this would have been a great place for modifications!)
The production values are high; The setting is beautiful and it seems professionally done.
Overall:
I would not recommend this DVD.  Someone new to yoga (unless they were already into ballet or something else that makes them exceptionally flexible) might be very discouraged.
Someone who has done other styles of yoga already and is curious about Ashtanga, this might be too watered down. The real practice goes faster and is more flowing. And half the primary series is missing: no seated poses.
If you have done yoga and want to learn the Ashtanga sequence and timing David Swenson's videos are much better. Swenson's production is not as professional the setting not as gorgeous, but his yoga is the real Ashtanga. And, he does give modifications for beginners!
I gave it a star because the setting (Hawaii) is nice to look at, and another because of the excellent production. The yoga...not the best.",1073779200,286,3012,4.7701149425287355
1901545,1,B0000A2ZOL,"I bought the first DVD in this series, Doane's Ashtanga Yoga: Introductory Poses.  I thought it gave a great introduction to the Ashtanga system, taking you through suryanamaskar A and B and several standing poses.  I bought the second DVD, Beginner's workout.  It is the EXACT same practice.  There is nothing new.  Doane goes through the same standing poses as on the first DVD.  I find that to be incredibly un-yogic of the people at Gaiam, just a way for them to get more money from unsuspecting customers who get no clue from the descriptions of the two DVDs that they are actually the same.
Do not buy this.  I plan to write to Gaiam as well to complain about this.",1072569600,44,671,4.4958677685950414
1901546,5,B0000A2ZOL,"I was curious how Yoga Journal would present Ashtanga vinyasa yoga.  Traditional this is a system of hatha yoga poses that are done in a specific order while continiously moving with the breath.  Originally, each individual pose was given to a student one by one when their teacher felt that they were ready. Now the Ashtanga Primary sequence is often taught in a class that goes through the first series in one session(which is 90 mins to 2 hours long and has some fairly intense poses).
There are a number of ceritified or authorized Ashtanga teachers (given this distinction by the co-founder of this system who is still alive) that have videos of the whole first series.  The three I know of are all quite good and are done by David Swenson, John Scott, and Richard Freedman.  So what could another video have to offer?  Well, as Nicki Doane herself states in the interview, she feels that a lot of these videos are overwhelming for a complete beginner.  What she does instead is focus on the Sun Salutations; the very beginning of the first Ashtanga Series and breaks them down.  She then continues on to a few standing poses.  I believe for someone who wants an introduction to Ashtanga and cannot get to a good teacher, this video is actually quite a nice alternative and would recommend it.  In fact, if you want to go futher in the series than she does; it is highly recommended that you study with a qualified teacher to cut down on the risk of injury.",1072310400,15,1462,4.57088122605364

The instructor goes through each of the basic moves until the end when you put them all together in a continous flow. But don't be fooled by the word ""beginners."" It's a hard workout and you may want to try Hatha Yoga first to get stronger. But this video is great if you want to learn more about Ashtanga Yoga while getting stronger and more flexible (especially your arms!). The extras include a step by step guide to the basic moves, an interview with the instructor, an advanced demonstration, and the full workout. I definantly recommend this for all you Yoga lovers out there and for those who want to try a new workout!",1065744000,26,744,4.518518518518518
1901548,5,B0000A2ZOL,"I have been searching for quite some time now for beginning Ashtanga videos that are of a slower pace so that I can focus on alignment, breath and the locks. This and the companion video ""Yoga Journal's Ashtanga Yoga Introductory Poses"" are perfect. I have been using David Swenson's Short Forms DVD and although it is excellent I find the pace too fast to adequately focus on alignment, breath and the locks due partly to the shape I am in. I have recently been doing ""Yoga Journal's Ashtanga Yoga Introductory Poses"" and on alternate days David Swenson's ""Yoga Short Forms"" 45 minute routine.
  The 1st video in the series ""Yoga Journal's Ashtanga Yoga Introductory Poses"" breaks down Surya Namaskara A & Surya Namaskara B in to shorter movements so each asana of the vinyasa can be focused on. The second video starts with the Sun Salutations and then moves through the Standing Asanas.
  Nicki Doane, the Yogini on both the Beginner's Practice and Introductory Poses, is an excellent instructor and I look forward to her future releases. If you do not already own these 2 videos and want to get into Ashtanga Yoga I highly recommend that you get both videos. You will not be disappointed. Even though the pace is slower if you are like me you will still find both videos very challenging.",1056240000,80,1292,4.728888888888889
1901559,5,B0000A2ZOL,"I bought a set of 3 DVDs with this one, AM yoga with Rodney Yee and another one not so great.
(I started first with AM yoga and love it, easy to follow, if you can't reach your foot use an elastic, Rodney Yee is great!)
I was a bit intimidated by Ashtanga Yoga for beginners. When you start yoga and are not so flexible, it's hard. But Nicki Doane groups and breaks down the vinyasas so it is easier to understand and to do properly! She's an awesome teacher. Yes, her voice is very slow, and deep, but personally i like it. It's the way a yoga teacher is supposed to talk: slowly, calmly, spiritually, soothingly ;) (Sometimes i make fun of her voice, and since i know the words by heart -i watch the DVD everyweek- i will talk along with her deep intonation. I even catched myself laughing in the street when i repeat in my head the invocation to Patanjali with her voice! LOL! Ok, i'm a yoga weirdo) Anywho, the DVD is great, high quality, wonderful images in Hawa, awesome teacher. I'm still a beginner and can't to the standing poses. But i mastered Suryanamaskar A and B!

1901562,4,B0000A2ZOL,I just got back into yoga recently after 10 years and this is the more challenging yoga video of my collection. I did the whole video recently and found it to be a vigorous workout that requires your patience because she has you do a lot of repetitive movements. The chanting is relaxing i find and the end of the workout is almost like meditation. Your body feels lifted and you can feel the affects. I'm gonna try to do this tape regularly along with my other workout videos and see if I can tone up this flab lol.,1367712000,,516,4.222222222222222

1901564,2,B0000A2ZOL,"I much prefer David Swenson's First Series practice to this. Nicki's pace is quite slow with extra and unnecessary guidance for someone who has any familiarity with Ashtanga. I realize this is a beginners practice DVD; however, even if I was new to the practice I think that I would prefer a more traditional and fast-paced approach (this is how I learned--and how David teaches--to do as much as the practice as you can knowing that you will build strength and endurance).

The pace alone wouldn't have been a deal breaker, but her voice was. She is very monotone and I found it depressing. It just wasn't conducive to a strong practice for me. Hopefully it is helpful for others.",1363046400,2,681,4.675

Seriously Sun Salutations A & B don't make it the practice.  Plus - this one and the Introductory DVD from this same person are almost identical.  Ugh.  Anyone looking for the full practice get the Freeman or Swenson DVD.  This is a waste of money - Ohm.",1287014400,4,425,4.3164556962025316
1901566,3,B0000A2ZOL,"I was looking for a good video to ease me into the Primary Series.  I have been practicing yoga for several years and have attended Ashtanga classes.  There are some poses which I find challenging and I was hoping for some instruction.  I was disappointed.  I loved the idea of her doing Ashtanga in Hawaii.  I own David Swenson's DVD's and while he is a master, the setting is a dark and dank studio.

I found this practice to be fairly easy.  She does hold the poses for longer than the standard 5 breaths which is nice.  While I got warm during the practice, I found myself wanting to generate more internal heat than I did.  I did not work up the sweat that I had wanted.

However, this is not the entire Primary Series.  Really Sun Salutations A & B and a few standing poses.  Anyone who has taken Ashtanga knows that the Primary Series entails more standing poses as well as poses on the floor, headstands, etc.

I did not find her instruction particularly in depth.  While she does give some cues, I wanted more of the subtle cues.  You have to have prior experience with Ashtanga to follow her without needing to look up at the screen.  For example, in warrior pose you spin the back foot flat.  She gives no instruction for this so you are stuck looking up at the screen to follow along.  Also, she refers to the poses by Sanskrit names, no ""downward dog"", ""chair pose"" ""plank"" or ""cobra"".  While this threw me a little, it is not uncommon for a typical Ashtanga class for the instructor to call out the Sanskrit names of the poses one after another.  It would have been nice if she used both so that the student could understand the instruction while integrating new knowledge.

Some of the reviewers were a bit critical of her mechanical like voice.  While this bothered me the first time I viewed it, it really did not bother while I was doing the practice as yoga is about focusing on your own breath, body, etc.  I have had Ashtanga classes where the instructor just called out poses like a robot counting breaths 1-5.  In other words, I believe her presentation to be more classic rather than what most people are used to in a Hatha yoga class where an instructor might add their own personal flair.  Also, in a traditional Ashtanga class (Mysore) mastering the poses is progressive.  That is, you do not get to progress within the Primary Series until the instructor thinks you are ready.  What this means, is that you could be doing Sun Salutations for the entire 90 minutes.  In that sense, I think this meets the criteria for a beginners practice to ""ease"" the yogi into the Primary Series.

Overall, I think this is a good tape for beginners to ease them into Ashtanga.  However, because of the classic Ashtanga presentation style, I would recommend some prior experience.  If you are looking for instruction of the the various poses, this may not be the DVD for you.  For better instruction of the advanced poses, I will be looking into some other DVD's.",1285632000,2,2975,4.51310861423221
1901567,4,B0000A2ZOL,"My roots in yoga began in the practice of Ashtanga yoga. I was preparing for my black belt in karate, when I decided to try a Richard Freeman yoga DVD. I later realized, how insane that was. Nevertheless, I was determined, with practice, to get it. For most beginners, Richard Freeman would have been too much to chew, but I was deep in Karate, so for me it was the best thing. I had the discipline, courage and beginner's strength to take on such a practice. I just needed the flexibility and time to learn and understand the sequences. I truly believe I would not be doing yoga if I did not start off in Ashtanga.

I eventually went on to practice other styles, like Kundalini, Iyengar and Anusara. Now, I love mixing up the styles, in a flow when I do studio classes.

However, things come back in circles and I am beginning to teach the primary series at the studio I am at. I don't claim to be an expert and I am not traditional, but I have the foundation, so I give what I know.

With that said, I recently tried a DVD from Gaiam called Ashtanga Yoga for Beginners with Nicki Doane.

This is a great introduction to the Asthanga beginning sequences of the Sun Salutations A & B. What is especially rewarding is how meticulously and deliberate she takes you through the series. She even walks you through the open ing chant, mudra and mediation with clarity and ease, set in a lovely Hawaiian back drop. Just keep in mind this is not the Primary Series. It is only the Sun Salutations, but if you are a beginner it is enough to start with.

1901568,2,B0000A2ZOL,"This is worth checking out if you're new to Ashtanga Yoga. She goes pretty slow and tries to explain what she's doing but I wouldn't recommend it for practice. Also, she only goes through half of the standing poses so you're kind of left wanting more when she decides to quit on you. I recommend Ashtanga Yoga: The Primary Series with Richard Freeman. The production value obviously isn't going to be as high as Gaiam but what it lacks in aesthetics it more than makes up with instruction. So all in all I say this is something good to rent but it will outlive its usefulness rather quickly.",1268611200,,591,4.481481481481482
1901579,5,B0000A2ZOL,"I really like this DVD.  It is perfect for what I want to do and it is exactly what I was looking for.  I first took a led Ashtanga Yoga class accidentally at a 24 Hour Fitness.  It was very hard but I expected yoga to be hard, at least some forms of it, so I took it in stride and practiced only as far as I could.

I did my research by reading the reviews here and testing out the DVD via Netflix.  Based on this, I decided that this is the DVD for me.  This DVD stops exactly where I stop in the class, after the wide-legged bends, and takes about 40-45 mins.  It is challenging but that is how you progress.

It is important to note, as others have, that Ashtanga Yoga is not for the faint of heart, even the warm up Sun Salutations can be very challenging depending on your fitness level and that's okay.  Also, the practice repeats itself on purpose, that is the point.  Always the same poses in the same order at the same speed to gauge your progress.  If you don't like repetition than don't get this DVD so that you don't  have to complain about it.  Get a DVD that promises several different routines.

This DVD is a beginner's practice that builds on the Introductory Poses DVD that precedes it.  She adds some standing poses but does not go into the more complex poses of the Primary Series.  She does break down Surya Namaskara A into two sections before you do it completely 5 times.  Then she breaks down the beginning of Surya Namaskara B before completing it the standard 5 times as well.  I like the preparation work because it gives you a chance to focus yourself before you get into the practice at full speed.  The salutations are done much quicker in this DVD than in Introductory Poses, so I like the extra time to warm myself up because I am a beginner to the practice.  Besides if you want to proceed further in the Primary Series you are going to need strength and stamina.

The practice on the DVD consists of the following (to the best of my memory).  Finding and reviewing a chart on the Primary Series will help you following along because this is just my lame attempt at describing the poses:

1.  Samasthitih (standing) thru Trini (flat back) and then back to standing, 4 times
2.  Samasthitih thru Trini then directly to Down Dog.  From Down Dog to Chatturanga, Up Dog, back to Down Dog, then you repeat just Chatturanga, Up Dog, Down Dog 3-4 times until you bring your feet forward and proceed back to standing.
3.  Suryanamaskara A is then completed 5 times in its entirety.
4.  Samasthitih to Chair thru to Trini and then back to standing, 3-4 times.
5.  Suryanamaskara B is then completed 5 times in its entirety.
6.  Then you proceed to the standing poses.  Forward bend holding your toes and then the forward bend with your hands under your feet.  Then Triangle, Revolved Triangle, Side Angle, and then she does all four (A-D) of the Wide Leg Forward Bends.  Finally, a Reverse Namaste Forward Bend and then relaxation in a seated cross-legged position and then lying Corpse.

A lot of people complain that this DVD does not contain the full Primary Series but if you READ the back of the box it is pretty clear that it doesn't promise the full series.  I do kind of wish that she provided more modifications but from what I understand that is not part of Ashtanga Yoga's philosophy.  I would recommend supplementing this DVD with a DVD or class that focuses on the poses.  I like Rodney Yee's new Yoga For Beginners.

Her voice is perfectly fine.  It is calm and she leads you without chattering on.  Try viewing the clip on the Gaiam website if you want a taste of it.  And please just ignore the chanting if you don't like it.  So what if she chants?

So, in conclusion, as long as you are a good researcher it is possible to find out exactly what is on this DVD and decide for yourself if it is for you or not.",1239062400,6,3853,4.352528089887641
1901580,2,B0000A2ZOL,"I was really put off by the chanting, I guess mostly because the cover of the box did not tell me this was a chanting yoga video.  I also found the instructor's approach to be distracting and annoying.  But mostly, it was the chanting.",1226361600,4,235,4.318181818181818
1901581,5,B0000A2ZOL,"The bad reviews are coming from yoga teachers, or non-beginner yogis. Yes, her voice is monotone. But she goes really slowly which is a very good thing for beginners. I'm also a yoga teacher and even I like to go back to this video once in a while for a very basic, slow series of poses that is still sweat-inducing. It's good to go back to basics sometimes and focus only on the breath and movement. While her voice is monotone, sometimes it's nice not to have the teacher's personality always there.

The difference between this DVD and ""Introductory Poses"" should be apparent. ""Introductory Poses"" is Suryanamaskara A and B. This DVD includes A and B as well, but goes on to add a few more poses from the series.

I don't think a beginners DVD should adhere strictly to the traditional Ashtanga series. It would scare too many people off.",1223424000,3,841,4.562913907284768

It's also slower paced for beginner's to get used to the correct form.  She explain's in her interview that she purposely leaves out the whole series because she's taught long enough to know what beginner's can handle.

I'm 45 and still `active' and just last year I fell off my mountain bike and fractured my clavicle and tore muscle and cartilage in both my shoulders.

1901585,4,B0000A2ZOL,"This is NOT a DVD for novices, so I think the title is misleading. But if you have learned some yoga and are a bit flexible, this is a good guided workout to surya namaskar and some other useful forward and side bends.

Nicky Doane's voice is very deadpan, rather horrible, the worst part of the DVD, she should take some voice lessons. Inflection is not a bad thing. I don't expect her to talk like Bob Barker, but the tone makes it sound as if the yoga has not impacted her interior life that much.

And the chanting with harmony, that seems a bit strange to me. I guess I'm a traditionalist in that I like the melodic chanting, but throwing in Western harmonies on top of it is ... ick.

But those are my only complaints about this DVD (both sound related!). The scenery behind the beautifully filmed and choreographed shots is exquisite and Ms. Doane's movement and form are near to perfect, and that's what we came for.

1901587,3,B0000A2ZOL,"I'm surprised people thought Nicki moves slowly during this dvd. When she executes the full Sun Salutations, she only holds the poses for 1 breath which is moderate to fast for my taste in achieving body awareness.

The DVD contains the workout w/ or w/o the highlighted visual to get more help during the workout. A performance of Nicki's ability which is pretty impressive though Rainbeau Mars is a bit better. There's also an interview with Nicki. Her voice is better here, but still stiff. She should get voice lessons before she over stresses her vocal chords to the point of injury.

The lush beautiful landscape of Hawaii is a great backdrop. The production value is very high quality professional. The music... is a single, slow almost forgetful drum player on a single drum. This adds to the harsh no-nonsense non-spiritual, medical anatomy term, more military style of Nicki's voice.

Nicki's teaching is limited to body placement & when to breathe in/out. There are no affirmations, just where to stick your body. I find Shiva Rea's, Rainbeau Mars, Rodney Yee & Sean Corne's ability much more fluid & deeper. I also enjoy their more spirit connection addition to their teaching. There is no teaching of modifications whatsoever.

Sun Salutations: After the 2 or so min intro, she teaches 1 pose at a time of the Sun Salutations & it is repeated 4-5x times before moving on to the next pose. Once you've learned the full Sun Salutation, she moves through it normal sped 4-5x. In this you also add in chair & warrior 1 poses in this first 30 min. The only pose she holds for a long time is downward dog.
Standing Postures: standing fwd bend w/fingers around big toe & then hands under feet, triangle w/fingers around big toe, extended right angle, standing wide angle fwd bend w/arms on ground by ankles & hands on hips, hands behind head on ground & hands grabbing big toes, reverse namaste hands behind back & fwd bend over single straight leg. She only goes back to mountain pose in between poses.
This ends with sitting cross legged meditation w/hands in mudra in total silence for a few minutes, then corpse pose w/soft male chanting music.

I only learned where to have my gaze during each pose over all the yoga dvds I've done. Couple of times it was the tip of my nose. I did fast fwd after a while because her voice was too careful & void of warmth & love of yoga that I need.

1901588,4,B0000A2ZOL,i am new to ashtanga and found this video extremely helpful - you can learn alot just by watching her form - the only reason i didn't give it five stars is because she doesnt offer advice on modifications which i think is essential to a beginner practice - i have taken a few ashtanga classes and have danced my whole life so i can figure out modifications for the most part on my own however if you were a true beginner with no movement experience you might feel frustrated by this lack of options - offering modifications is also important to remind students that the average person is not going to get anywhere near these poses for a long time - what do you do if you go to put your face to your knees and you only get into an L shape - how do you properly and safely hold yourself there? the video doesnt answer these very important questions - if you are serious about learning you will have to marry up your materials - david swenson has a good book called the practice manual that is a good complement to this video - get as much information as you can because you never know which teacher will illuminate something for you just with a subtle shift in explanation,1184198400,2,1170,4.274774774774775
1901599,5,B0000A2ZOL,"I've been using this DVD for my yoga practice for about 3 weeks daily now (Sundays off) and I really, really like it. Firstly, she's very precise and will fine-tune your movements and postures--what you never really get in a class setting. There are links to each pose and she explains exactly where you should be looking and how you should be positioning yourself. Secondly, yes, it's a bit slow-going, but that's also very relaxing and easy to follow (not to mention challenging for the postures you have to hold for a while!!). Thirdly, she gives you a great balance of beginner's moves plus lots of poses to strive for. I envision myself perfecting this routine for a while--there's a lot of room to grow. On top of it all, she's extremely graceful and elegant and inspires the same in you.

I didn't really realize how much I liked this DVD until I went to a power yoga class with one of my friends (after doing this routine for a few weeks) and felt like my level was way above those of the people in the class, even though I've only been doing power yoga for a year and this DVD for 3 weeks. I felt like my movements were much more fine-tuned and graceful and exact than others' and that I knew what I was doing, and, that I was way more strong (I could hold the postures longer than others) when I hadn't even realized it. For that I give it 5 stars.

I must say, I'm not too much into the chanting in nonsense syllables (obviously, a sanskrit prayer but meaningless syllables to me) at the beginning, so I just fast-forward that. If you do that, the routine is a very do-able 45-minute daily routine.",1183334400,,1609,4.395973154362416
1901600,1,B0000A2ZOL,"What a letdown. I have done a lot of astanga, but bought the ""beginners"" DVD because I am not terribly flexible and have had some injuries. According to the box, it's a 1 hour, 40 minute program, which would be a normal time to get through the entire astanga first series poses. But in reality, only 55 minutes of this DVD is poses, and she only gets through some of the standing poses -- at a glacial pace. I felt like I'd barely gotten warmed up, and she was laying down for sivasana. I do not recommend this DVD unless you have literally never done an astanga series.",1180915200,9,570,4.287037037037037
1901601,5,B0000A2ZOL,"I recomend this workout to sincere and fit practitioners with good flexability who aren't afraid of hard work. I studied With Guru Ji and he did prolong the salutations and each asana so that we could feel the pose and learn it well when we began.  The breathing is the same weather you ""fly"" through the poses or stay in them.  This workout will get you in the shape you need to be in for an Ashtanga practice.  The instructor stays true to the technique and breath and has made a beautiful presentation.",1154390400,5,505,4.408602150537634
1901602,5,B0000A2ZOL,"I have had this video for a while.  It used to be just about the hardest video I had, but I can now do it pretty easily.  Anyway, as others have said, it consists of Sun Saluations A and B, and then a long standing series.  Very few videos have a standing series that is this complete.

This video, because it is repetitive and she is quiet, allows me to focus on my practice.  Further, I do not think that you can build the strength necessary to move to higher levels without doing the Sun Salutations.

I do not think her voice is abrasive, just stripped down.  It always seems like she is hiding a smile.",1145145600,4,607,4.181034482758621
1901603,5,B0000A2ZOL,"I found this to be a great teaching video for Ashtanga.  The instructor is very deliberate, giving practitioners opportunity to focus carefully on breath and alignment.  Among the twenty or so yoga videos that I practice with, this is my favorite.  It's the one I reach for most often because I feel simply great afterwards.  Nicki helps us build a great foundation for further practice.",1142553600,4,387,4.907692307692308
1901604,4,B0000A2ZOL,"I recommend this DVD, with some caveats:

1. It is certainly NOT a true beginner's DVD. No poses are modified, and I found when I bought the DVD several months ago that I couldn't do it. I got involved with Seane Corn's Vinyasa Flow yoga DVD's instead, and highly recommend them as stepping stones to achieving this DVD. Seane breaks the poses down more completely, modifies them, and allows the user to build up the strength necessary to complete this DVD. However, once sufficient strength has been achieved, I find this DVD to be of a good pace and length to challenge people who want to continue to grow in their practice, and are frustrated with the perpetually simplistic and modified Yoga fare available for in-home use. Note that all sitting poses have been eliminated from this program, and the un-modified Sun Salutes A and B are performed repeatedly before going into the basic, but un-modified and therefor very challenging, standing poses.

2. There is a ""Pose Guide"" available, a sort of ""White Rabbit"" feature that allows you to receive additional instruction on poses by pressing a button during the regularly scheduled program. I have not used this feature - I don't care to disrupt the flow of practice with use of my remote control - so I don't know how useful the guide is. However, if you've already familiarized yourself with the poses on simpler DVDs, it's pleasant to go through the practice on this DVD without a lot of additional, wordy instruction.

3. The instructor has an absurd monotone, and my initial reaction upon hearing it was irritation, annoyance, and some laughter. However, after a few iterations of the DVD I started to get used to it, and now I positively enjoy listening to her. Watching her ""Bonus Interview"" helped too; hearing her talk outside the practice cues gave me a better idea of her cadence and mode of expression, and helped me put her voice in context.

Summary: If you're looking for a true beginner's DVD, I recommend investigating Seane Corn's Vinyasa Flow series. If you're interested in challenging yourself a bit more, this DVD is a logical stepping stone to the more advanced, un-modified practice, but not so advanced as to be unattainable, and the length, flow, and practice itself are excellent!",1139443200,7,2261,4.849740932642487
1901605,2,B0000A2ZOL,"Beginners is definitely a misnomer here, unless it's just referring to an introduction to ashtanga. I am an intermediate yoga practitioner and I wouldn't wish this video on a yoga newbie. While you can turn on a pose explaination track, no modifications are shown on the main track. The instructor honestly seemed bored; her voice was about as excitement filled as Ben Stein's in Ferris Bueller. You know... ""Bueller? Bueller?"" The pacing of this is so slow I wanted to start counting sheep, but it manages to not feel relaxing at all. The sequencing seemed uninspired, and I grew quickly bored.",1137196800,4,595,4.900990099009901
1901606,2,B0000A2ZOL,"I have done Ashtanga many times at the yoga center - but it would be nice to save the $15 per session and be able to do it at home. Especially, since Ashatanga is the same every time.

Well, this DVD didn't help me out much at all. It doesn't go through the whole routine. It doesn't follow the Ashtanga breathing. And her voice is annoying! I have turned the volume way down and it is still grating.

The workout itself is actually not too bad. It is strenous in parts because she goes through A and B many times and very slowly. However, as an Ashtanga workout - it really fails miserably.

For the workout it is - it could have been improved with a pose-only narration track.

Save your money, there are better DVDs out there.",1136851200,9,729,4.260869565217392
1901607,1,B0000A2ZOL,"This is the worst yoga video I have seen to date.  Nicki Doane's voice is awful to have to listen to.  Fifteen minutes into the workout, her voice just seemed to grate my nerves.  Her voice  also just seemed to have a tension behind it, which caused stress.  The workout wasn't terrible in itself, so I suggest memorizing the sequences and doing them without the video.

This supposedly is a beginner's video.  But there is no information on using yoga props, and no warning about not trying to reach the full pose right away, so as not to injure yourself.  There is the option of watching the video with extra pose hints, but they are not very helpful.  I would have expected more on how to make sure that you are properly aligned, or doing it properly.

I would strongly recommend a different video.  I wish I would have rented it before I bought it.",1125619200,11,852,4.432258064516129
1901608,5,B0000A2ZOL,"I love this video.  I have been curious about Ashtanga and have been reading the ashtanga manual, written by larry shultz owner of it's yoga and have been struggling with the concepts.  I got Niki's video because I was hoping to establish a foundation to move on to Swenson's video then go to Mysore classes.

I am extremely pleased.  I love her instruction, I never achieved such a focus in yoga before, not even in Bikram.  I definitely transcended and was able to bring my head to my knees in forward bend and I have never done that before.  I had to go into child's pose a lot during downward dog and that's OK - I had a breakthrough with that, too.  I love the final sitting posture.  I was extremely inspired by her demonstration.

Yesterday, because of the introduction I experienced I was able to devour the ashtanga manual and understand every bit of it.  I'm hooked :)",1125446400,4,878,4.465408805031447
1901619,5,B0000A2ZOL,"I guess it is valuable to critique this DVD of Ashtanga Yoga. I am unsure if one can honestly ""hate"" a monotone voice, but I guess if one is really attempting to be rude or hurtful anything is possible.

I purchased Nicki Doane's first CD before I ever got into Yoga. I found it challenging but doable. Perhaps this is due to my martial arts background but I can see how those not used to Yoga might find Nicki's form and pace threatening, I did but then I learned Suryanamaskar A and B and started taking classes at a local Yoga Studio. Nicki's tape prepared me for a real Ashtanga Yoga Class at a real Yoga Studio.

Ashtanga Yoga is not sexy. Ashtanga Yoga is not overly entertaining. It is a practice where you, your breath, your body and the mat meet. This meeting is not always enjoyable and often times you can be walk away broken. It has always been my understanding that this is the very idea of Yoga Practice to discipline the body and the senses to free the higher self from their yoke. Such notions as one's voice being pleasing or unpleasing are of little matter for those who are on this path.

It is my hope that those who practice Ashtanga Yoga reach deeper than this for criticism.

AUM!",1102896000,14,1203,4.357142857142857
1901620,2,B0000A2ZOL,"This is a very disappointing DVD. I was looking for a beginner tape - something easy. This is not it. It repeats each exercise endlessly and assumes that you can do all the poses without offering alternatives if you can't, for example, reach the floor with your hands while standing straight. Not a keeper.",1100908800,7,306,4.685185185185185
1901621,5,B0000A2ZOL,"I have several yoga tapes and have been to many different kinds of classes, and this is my favorite workout---the one I want to do every morning. If you're brand new to yoga, it'd probably be better to start with Nicki Doane's other tape (introductory poses) to really get a hang of the sun salutations, which are done at a speedy clip in this tape.

Other reviewers have complained about Nicki Doane's voice, and I also thought it was strangely harsh when I put in the DVD for the first time, but after going through the entire workout, I found her the best instructor I've had. She is completely neutral, but no-nonsense. Her affectless voice allows me to forget about her as a person (I have not been able to do this with other instructors) and simply focus on the poses, which has helped me to really find my focus and ""still"" my mind.

Other reviewers have also complained about the timings in this workout and the lack of the complete First Series of Ashtanga. All I can say to that is that the timings are perfect for me. The extra time gives me a little room to really work on getting into the poses, and there is plenty of exercise in this tape. Once this is easy, go ahead and move on to a tape with the entire sequence on it (when will Nicki make one?? Whenever she does, I will buy it!), but this workout is complete and balanced in itself. When I finish this workout, my body feels tired and evenly exercised, and I feel exhilirated.",1100131200,8,1446,4.371747211895911
1901622,4,B0000A2ZOL,"I have studied with Nicki Doane and ask potential viewers of the DVD to ignore the negative remarks about her voice; there is nothing wrong with the tone or pace of her instruction. This DVD is not an aerobics class or entertainment and that should not be a deciding factor when choosing to view this instruction. While the DVD is beautiful, it is an authentic and careful demonstration of Ashtanga yoga as taught to Nicki directly from Sri K. Patabhi Jois.

It is a true beginner's practice as she carefully explains each asana while offering reminders and other information about Ashtanga yoga. It is not, however, the full primary series. The entire primary series is too advanced for real beginners to learn on this DVD. It is slower than what one might encounter in a lead Ashtanga class. That is to fully instruct beginners as to the correct positioning of the body. It includes Sun Salutation A and B, most of the standing poses (no tree pose, for example) and very few seated poses. I was pleased to see the DVD includes the opening prayer, begins and ends with an ""Om"", and ends with Sivasana.

I can recommend this to anyone who wants to augment a beginner or primary series practice at home, while traveling, or any other time you aren't in class.

1901624,4,B0000A2ZOL,"...because of the repetition, this is a very valuable introduction to Ashtanga Yoga.  If you really want to learn yoga, it takes time, patience, and practice...all things necessary when viewing this DVD/video.

I've read and heard many criticize Nicki's voice as monotone and boring...and I almost didn't buy the DVD because of those reviews.

I'm glad I did buy this DVD.  Her monotone voice allows me to focus on the many elements of each pose and not become annoyed by a ""sing/song"", chirpy aerobics instructor voice. I've taken a few introductory classes in yoga - Iyengar and Ashtanga and stretch regularly - and I still found Nicki's explanations very helpful.  I especially enjoy being able to spend time in each pose and really explore it.

I also have a Power Yoga tape that does not provide any pauses, teaching, or other instructional aspects - but does zip through the entire Primary series at good clip. This DVD with Nicki will prepare me for that tape - while learning, I value the pace of this DVD.

This DVD is a beginner practice. It takes one through Sun Salutations A and B and several standing poses with time and patience and instruction. It does not go through the entire Primary Series. If you cannot complete this DVD - then you may not be ready to move on to a more advanced - faster - yoga tape IMHO.

If you're looking to be entertained by your instructor - this is not for you. If you want to learn Ashtanga Yoga - get this one.",1094256000,20,1457,4.555555555555555
1901625,5,B0000A2ZOL,"I love this DVD.  I have the introductory as well and I love that too.  The more negative reviews here have their points.  The biggest ones being:
A) Her voice is monotone or boring.  I think there is some truth to that, but because it is so monotone I have not gotten sick of it after doing this workout for months.  I actually have always liked it.  It seems to lull into a point of focus I feel helps me to concentrate better.  I don't know.  Not for everyone, I guess, but helpful to me.
B) The second DVD is the same as the first. This I don't really agree with.  In the first one you learn each pose one at a time and do that one pose (or one pose to the second pose) like 5 times.  That gets boring after you've done it a while.  The second DVD (this one) goes through Surynemaskar A and B much faster.  I was happy to move onto this DVD and not have to do samasthiti to ekam to samasthiti 6 times in a row.
If you are serious about ashtanga and want to work hard, you CAN do the whole DVD, with time.  It's not the easist yoga to do, but it's really fun and I like Nikki Doane's approach.",1086912000,9,1096,3.949771689497717

She does a demo of the advanced Ashtanga poses and is very impressive but seems to me unrealistic and ""out there"". I am not looking to be THAT flexible. As for strength, it works pretty well, but it tough to hold some positions. Helping flexability is a 10. I could barely (and I mean barely) touch my ankles but after 2 months, I can easily touch the underneaths of my feet. Also, her voice is insanely monotonous. Even in the interview she does not change tone in her voice. It makes it very hard to relax. She is impressive in what she can do, but if I were tell people (especially beginners), I would only recomend this for people who don't mind alittle bit of boredom and repatition to buy this.
