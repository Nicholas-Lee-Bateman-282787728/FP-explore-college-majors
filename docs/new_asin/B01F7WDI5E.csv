8760438,5,B01F7WDI5E,A very well made film that gives you a real insight into the workings of a small specialty store. I think comic book fans will love this and the uninitiated will learn a lot and be very entertained by the interviews from current and past employees of this great little store in Harvard Square!,1463270400,,293,4.444444444444445
8760439,5,B01F7WDI5E,"Ok, I happen to be IN this movie but that has nothing to do with the fact that I really like it. This is a story of a favorite store, something most people have, that has been toiling away for the last 40 years. These little bastions of culture seem to be there forever, a cornerstone in our lives until suddenly they're gone with no explanation. We're left to wonder and mourn. Luckily, the Picnic endures! With the release of this film, people can now know the history of one of the country's oldest comic book shops. Started in the early 1970s in Cambridge, Mass, The Million Year Picnic is an anchor for that state's comic book fans. The documentary shows interviews with some of the people that help build that store and make it what it is. The mom and pop stores of the world seem almost to be a dying breed these days and yet they hold such fond memories for us. This is the story of one of those stores. The film's maker, Vince Apruzzese, was a manager of the Picnic and so knows its inner workings well. If this store was a part of your past, or you loved one like it, this is the movie for you.",1462492800,,1104,4.212264150943396
