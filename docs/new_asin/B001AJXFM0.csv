Given Nik and Dave Anderson's history of releasing sub-par quality live material I must admit I was a bit skeptical about sinking cash into this disc.
I could have not been more wrong. The quality of both the camera work and the sound is more than acceptable. The quality of the performance is also above par.
Yes, these guys are old, most haven't been in Hawkwind proper since 1973 at latest, but these geezers can run circles around the group that Brock is touring under the Hawkwind banner. Seriously, play this back to back with Hawkwind's latest DVD Knights of Space and you'll see what I mean.
I admit to being more than a bit partial to the earlier Hawkwind material and this show's setlist delivers all delivered in the ramshackle space-thrash that defined the early years of Hawkwind (as opposed to the high-tech sheen that has defined Brock's band for the last couple of decades)
Don't get me wrong, I love Hawkwind, but for me, this disc delivers what I've been missing in the mainship's releases.
