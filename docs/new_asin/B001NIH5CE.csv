8327214,3,B001NIH5CE,"This is the season that had Napoleon Solo dancing with a gorilla and Illya Kuryakin riding a THRUSH skunk bomb ala DR STRANGELOVE.  The spinoff -- THE GIRL FROM U.N.C.L.E. -- took a toll on the series , along with the camp influence of BATMAN.  There were some entertaining episodes: THE CONCRETE OVERCOAT AFFAIR  But the quality had dropped like a rock so did the ratings.  It would try to regain its focus the next year but the damage was done.",1260057600,9,446,4.469135802469136
