8297226,5,B001E9QYQ0,"I was very pleased with this dvd.  The choreography is excellent,and the break down is very good.  It is so nice to see authentic egyptian styling-very strong, very proud and very much a part of the beautiful music.  The interview with Randa Kamel was a nice bonus and the footage of two of her performances was really a treat to watch.  For the price of this dvd one gets alot of valuable material-well worth it.",1345334400,,413,4.466666666666667
8297227,5,B001E9QYQ0,"This dvd is absolutely wonderful. Definitely worth it, if you are into Modern Egyptian style and Randa's style in particular. I consider her to be an earth bouncy powerful dancer. She does hop around a lot but it still looks very grounded. I learned a lot from this DVD. The choreography is very Randa style, if you have ever seen her dance that is exactly what you are getting in the choreography.

 The main menu is broken up into 4 sections: Technique, Choreography, Choreography performance and Bonus features. The Technique section is broken up into three parts. Exercises, Tabla technique, and tabla rythms demonstrated
Exercise one: step touch with and arm pattern
Exercise two: Shimmies with Hip circles and accents.
Exercise three: Hip bumps with a foot pattern . twist with footpattern.
Exercise four: Hip bumps again with another footpattern
Exercise five: Hip drop kicks, traveling
Exercise six: Hips bumps with half-turns.

 I love this section and she breaks the moves down wonderfully.  These moves are her signature moves. I see her use them in many performances. She also gives you performances tips scattered throughout the technique section e.g ."" Your whole boy should show expression even your face"" or ""never look down while you are dancing.""
In Tabla technique- Randa is dancing with a drummer and showing her favorite steps. She demonstrates each twice. But there is no breakdown. Some of the moves were in the first technique section others weren't. To be honest I like this part. Simply because I viewed it as a challenge I really did like the majority of the moves shown here so I tried to pick them up just by watching her demonstrate them and it's fun to try. Also helps for learning to pick up other movements that have no break down to them.

  In Tabla Rythms demonstrated-The Drummer plays the Karachi, Maksoum, Jerk, Samba, Rhumba, and Masmoudi. I am guessing that these are the rythms in the song piece because if not I `m not sure what the purpose of this quick demonstration was.

  The choreography is broken into eight sections. She performes the section then breaks it down. The beginning of each section incorporates the ones before it. If you are on section seven. She shows you the choreography up until 8 then breaks down section seven. Similar to what Sadie does in her drum solo dvd's. Before the choreography begins there is a written statement that tells you how she is going to teach the choreography. Then there is the choreography performances where she performs it in her practice attire. Follwed by another performance where she is in costume.

  The Bonus feature contains all kinds of goodies and is broken down into: Interview, Live Shows, Also available from Natasha, Eman Zaki designer of the stars, Charity organization and Credits.
The interview is actually a live interview. Where the person asks Randa questions like, what made her want to be a dancer? How long has she been dancing? How did she develop her dance style? Did she study under a teacher? What special something did she bring to the dance? Etc.
  The live Shows footage is awesome. It is clear you can see the movements no weird camera angles. There are two of them one at the Cairo Marriot, and the other at the Nile Maxim. The footage is long, It is not just one song danced too but it appears to actually be the whole show. Which makes the price of this dvd even more worth it. To actually get two live shows and interview and choreography is more than worth the asking price of this dvd.
  Also available from Natasha- is a page that shows other available dvd's. Like the other two in this set.
  Eman Zaki designer to the stars: Is a written section about Eman Zaki. I must say I have seen some Zaki  made costumes and they are gorgeous.
  Charity organization-this section actually has a film that is telling you about the organization and what they do to help others. It was impressive. The organization is called Women for women international. I liked it because they women that were talking were from diverse cultures and background that had suffered hardships. Very Well put together.

I see that the amazon price at the moment is 30 something dollars but I got mine at HOLLYWOODMUSICCENTER.COM for $24.99 plus shipping and handling. So if you want a cheaper price you can definitely take a look at that.
This DVD will be best for those who have prior belly dance instruction. The moves are demonstrated well but as far as being broken down precisely like a beginner would need it is not.

I give the DVD a five stars because it has a lot of variety. You get enough material to keep you focused and not to much that you feel overwhelmed or so much that it will take you forever to get. The teaching instruction is good. Breakdown of the material is good. She goes over posture for each movement, and I like the choreography. Whether I will use this exact choreography is unknown but I can definately incorporate a lot of the movements into my dance vocabulary.
Out of this DVD I got some very nice combos, juicier shimmies, and little tid bit technique advice on creating a more modern oriental style dance.",1316822400,,5142,4.712053571428571
