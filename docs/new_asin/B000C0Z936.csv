These horror flicks take a diffrent approach to most horror flicks, they arnt your typical madman slasher films. There about a bunch of people who cheat death. Each movie has a person who has a premonition about there death that involves a lot of other people, and they end avoiding it and seeing there premonition come true (without them in it)

But, death has a design, and when its your time, its your time. So each of the people who survived who where meant to die, start mysteriosly being killed when death comes back to finish the job.

The best thing about these flicks is not who dies next, it's HOW they die. The FX are great, and it's good to actualy see the death scenes instead of the camera cutting away. As the producer said, ""the studios tried to tell us that cutting away and not showing it is better, its better to use your imagination...mmmm...bulls***t"" and I couldn't agree more.

If you haven't seen these two great movies yet, then pick them both up together now in this double pack. And see if you two cant wait for the hopefull 3rd sequel they talk about!",1132704000,,1231,4.385964912280702

8094992,5,B000C0Z936,"I love the Final Destination series. In my opinion, the 2nd one is the best one. The best thing about these movies is how the people die. Blood and gore all the way! It's amazing to me how these movies made death seem like a predator preying upon its victims. If you see 1 then you have to see all 3. That's just the way it is.",1284940800,,327,3.8955223880597014
8094993,5,B000C0Z936,this is one of the best horror series that i like. i normally just stick with the old scream series (courtney cox) and i know what you did last summer (jennifer love hewitt) but i decided to try this out. plus it was on sale for ten dollars so i decided to buy it.  it turns out that i loved the movies im only mad because they can't keep with the same cast for each movie.  i can't wait till the third comes out on dvd.,1153353600,,420,3.872093023255814
