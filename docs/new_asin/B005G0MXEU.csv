4686816,2,B005G0MXEU,"Unfortunately for the rest there is no original Italian soundtrack and no subtitles. It's difficult to tell whether at least parts of any of the other films might have been quite good - by which I also mean quite erotic - if it were not for the off-putting dubbing, all done by the usual UK dubbing studio, with the usual voices, which has ruined scores of foreign films and TV series since the 60s and should have been put out of business long ago.

Certainly some of the films are just bad, but I think two or three might have been tolerable in Italian, but as far as I can see Brass has never produced a really satisfyingly edited erotic scene despite his many efforts to approach the same obsessions over and over again. But his images do often look good and I'm sure with a better editor something could have been made of them. Even when the editing is good for a short time he has a habit of 'alienating' the action by introducing an ironic soundtrack such as a 40s pop song or dance number.
Except for 'The Key' all the narratives are very repetitive from film to film, and all have a 'picaresque' linear structure that becomes boring.

See my review of 'The Key' as a separate release if you are interested in a really good and intelligent erotic film - it seems to be the single exception in Brass's output.
Unfortunately in this set 'The Key' is dubbed into English and not worth watching. But I also have a separate copy in Italian so I know what a difference it makes.
Paprika, one of the films in this collection with the original Italian, is a picaresque story of a young girl's career as a prostitute. It is a hymn of praise to the golden age of Italian brothels up to their being made illegal, and which is the subject of the film's rather sad ending.
The other film in the original Italian is 'Black Angel'.",1351468800,7,1824,4.377581120943953
4686817,1,B005G0MXEU,"- Awful sound/video-transfer quality (at least for 6 out of 8 dvd's on this box)

- Only partial and very bad done english dub as for sound-setting(forget about watching these dvd's in their original italian soundtrack), not to mention the dubbing is one of the lousiest ever.

- Only dutch subtitles available (go figure...)

- Bonus do not correspond with the movies. In fact the making-of ""Cheeky"" is the only available bonus material repeated in at least three discs (I didn't bother to check the entire collection. By this point I had already decided to ask for a refund)",1326153600,3,576,4.797979797979798
4686818,1,B005G0MXEU,"I was considering this DVD set but it's only 80 minutes long?  Eight movies?  No way!  What a ripoff for $70!!!  I think they must be ""previews"" of Tinto's films...not the actual productions.",1325116800,,191,4.696969696969697
4686819,5,B005G0MXEU,"I was kinda surprized when had read reviews which mention only one of his movies from a collection of 8 dvd. Some reviewers complained about plot, some complained about soft core  etc. As I am old fart I see clearly Tinto Brass understand life and he creates art where imagination equal real life and this is what matters nothing else. And being lived in US for too long where women judge men by the size of his bank account its really refreshing to see women the way they should be--exactly the way Tinto paint them--sexy and available  //  yes, to make his movies reality I have to fly half of the world but this is whats life is all about  //. Amen.",1278374400,7,652,4.319672131147541

8470899,1,B005G0MXEU,"The whole point about the Tinto Brass collection is to view them in their original sensual language Italian.
Sadly the Italian has been completely removed and replaced with a quickly dubbed English soundtrack.
Knowing that these DVDs are in PAL and, at the time of this writing, they are still being advertised as being in Italian, I was naturally expecting Italian movies.
Not a chance.
I advise to stay away from this set and look at other Tinto Brass offerings right here on amazon that are truly in Italian.",1495065600,,511,4.752808988764045

8470903,4,B005G0MXEU,"I'm a great fan of Tinto Brass, his films are some of the greatest soft core erotica ever made in my opinion, so I am thrilled to have these films in my collection, as mentioned in other reviews, the quality of the transfers isn't the best, if you have the money I'm sure the regular DVD and Blu -ray releases look much better than the offerings here, but considering that would cost hundreds of dollars to get all of these films, I am happy enough with this set in it's less than amazing quality for the price, and yes they do have silly sounding American dubs on the films ( the ones I've watched so far) and I actually like that, and think it is part of the charm of watching films like this. There are also some fun extras like interviews with Tinto and the Actors, and behind the scenes stuff. For people who want a region free player, many models have remote unlocking codes online you can google, Panasonic has a nice 1080p upscalng model that can easily be unlocked and only costs $40-$60, model # Panasonic DVD-S700",1452556800,,1024,4.394736842105263
