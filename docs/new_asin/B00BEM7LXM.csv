5609437,5,B00BEM7LXM,"Having hiked most of the AT, I am very impressed with this production.  It's not your typically ""You got to hike the trail"" or ""Let see how funny we can make this adventure"" movie.  It's an open and honest portrayal of trail life.  The Traveling Circus--the three hikers featured in the movie--experienced all the emotions that come with the physical demands of a thru-hike.  Great job!",1364428800,2,386,4.803030303030303
5609438,2,B00BEM7LXM,"I've read a lot of books on the AT; watched a lot of DVD's on the AT; and hiked the AT. This DVD was a disappointment to me. It looked like a brother/sister act wanted to break into the film industry; unfortunately, in my opinion, they weren't successful. With all of the ""hype"" associated with this video, I expected so much more. I'm not saying that they didn't try hard, but unfortunately they tried to make a movie drama with a plot, out of this video. While professionally done (film wise), the ""story"" just wasn't there.

I wish them (him and her) success in pursuing their careers (her in law and him in the medical profession). I just don't think that the film industry, is their ""thing"". However, I did learn to use profanity and cuss a lot after watching the video. I guess this is considered ""entertainment"".

I wish the cast of the video, the best of luck and hope that friendships are restored, I just didn't think much of the video.",1364428800,5,946,4.46242774566474
5609439,5,B00BEM7LXM,"I watched this film, and all the extras, this weekend. It's pretty much MTV's The Real World meets the AT. I mean that in a good way.

I've watched over a dozen AT-centric videos, and this one is definitely different. As someone who also completed the entire Trail (me, over an eight year stretch in sections; the main ""characters"" in this film as a thru-hike in a single hiking season) I know the many joys and pains that long distance hiking entails. And I've seen my share of drama out there. The main film captures the drama and then some. The ""extras"" capture the rest of the experience.

So . . . Three young people set out to hike the AT, and self-produce a film with a different angle than any other AT video out there. They succeed on both counts. One of the women and the man are siblings. The other woman has been friends with both for a long time. Do they get along well after months living and backpacking together? Mostly, until the non-sibling develops a crush on a male hiker, and a typical trail ""romance"" begins. The two women get emotional, and lots of screaming and crying ensues. Just like on MTV! That's enough spoiler for now--see the film. It's unique.

Monkey, the male hiker, pretty much stays out of it. His primary crying scene takes place when he learns his best friend, a 13-year old dog, had to be put down as he was just a couple weeks from finishing the AT in Maine. I like his style and sense of humor; this episode about the dog showed his humanity as well as anything. I'd be crying too.

I think this is a realistic look at the interpersonal relationships, private feelings (there are lots of reality-show style ""confessionals""), and language that many (not all) experience on a long hike. They went out of their way to produce something different, and not just another travelogue. They deserve a lot of credit for not only putting in the miles, but keeping a production schedule and carrying the extra gear needed to make this film.

The extras are, in some ways, as interesting as the actual film.

The hike happened in 2010, and the film (or at least an early version) was shown a lot of places on a PR tour in 2012. Apparently it's now ready for prime time (well, maybe on HBO because of the language). Worth the time and money!",1362268800,2,2269,4.455421686746988
5609440,3,B00BEM7LXM,"I suppose it is difficult to form a story from raw footage without the knowledge of a story forming, however, BBtD was an exhilarating documentary, and a noble effort. At times, I would have enjoyed to view and hear of the perils and tribulations of the trail and the hike, itself, and focus less on the 'drama' between the ladies, but perhaps that is another documentary, or, their is a lack of footage of the hike. Also, a lot of planning goes into a trek such as this, and the 'pack' you prepare and carry - and the 'drops' you would have to pick up from town to town is an adventure as well. In short - I'd've liked to see more 'man vs. self' and 'man vs nature' rather than the 'man vs. man', or rather, 'woman vs woman' angle, as it seemed the filmmakers ignored the elephant in the room - the AT. These are mere opinions of mine, and only a small aspect of my judgement and review. The story between the two ladies and the one gentleman is a fine tale, and does explore a certain aspect of self-discovery through nature when the 'norm' is cut off...even if Ringleader leaves the trail to go to a graduation ceremony(which seemed out of place). Overall, not bad.",1362096000,,1168,4.337899543378995
5609441,4,B00BEM7LXM,"When I first heard about this movie, I expected to get a feel for what it would be like doing an AT thru-hike. That's really not what the movie is about although you do get a sense for some of the highlights of a typical AT thru-hike (i.e., the hiker photo album at Harpers Ferry, the abandoned bus just off the trail, ""trail magic"", biting flies). The real story of the movie is the interpersonal dynamics between the three hikers and their struggles to deepen or maintain their relationships with each other. OVERALL RATING: G-R-E-A-T.",1362009600,2,537,4.663157894736842
5609442,2,B00BEM7LXM,"I really was excited about receiving this DVD - I love the Appalachian Trail, and have many books and DVDs featuring it.  I had heard about this movie last year, and was not able to see it in a theater.  Well, I watched it last night for the first time, and was rather disappointed.  This movie is not so much about hiking the Appalachian Trail as it is about ""My Best Friend is a B***h"".  I got more and more irritated as the movie went on - here were these young people in these amazing places, meeting amazing people, doing amazing things, and it seemed like all the movie focused on was the screaming and crying.  Thankfully, now that I've had time to simmer down, I realize that first of all, all of the people who were featured in this movie were very, very young.  The other thing that I realized was that the filmmaker chose to focus on the emotional experiences, rather than the physical/intellectual experiences when making her movie.  I get the impression that this film was made in response to friends and family asking her why she doesn't speak to Emily anymore.  I don't want to take anything away from them, it is a great accomplishment to hike the AT from end to end; I just think that they might be best served by hiking it again, when they have the maturity to understand that fighting with your friend, while interesting to you, is not very interesting to anyone else.

Two stars for making it end to end, and the ""bonus features"", which were a lot less irritating than the actual film.",1362009600,12,1505,4.443636363636363
5609443,5,B00BEM7LXM,"The movie was great, the dvd as a whole is really 2 movies, 1 main one which i feel is really an emotional journey and then you have all the outakes, interviews etc which make another movie which is probably

5609505,2,B00BEM7LXM,"Definitely a title that fits the film. No beauty involved. Just a whiney and overwhelming unhappy film maker. Maybe she should have interviewed some AT trail thru hikers to get a better understanding of why people decide to challenge the AT trail and what they are looking to find and accomplish.

Listening to the brother's ... painful fits, position statements or whatever they were ... didn't help. I rented the video ... thankfully not a purchase ... and by the half way point had to force myself to keep,watching. I should have just gave up and wrote the $2 rent off as a bad choice.

5609556,1,B00BEM7LXM,"The only good thing about this film is the fact that it actually took place on the AT. The ""girl drama"" among these three was unbearable. If ""Ringleader"" didn't have ""Lightning"" with her every waking moment, she had a tantrum. Grow up! ""Ringleader"" acted like she owned the hike. Any semi-experienced hiker knows that every individual has his or own pace and reasons to be on the trail. ""Ringleader's"" expectations were so over the top to expect her friend to stay with her for every step.

All that to say...if you want to watch middle school type drama rather than a real hiking film, then this film's for you.

Also, was dropping the f bomb that many times really necessary? It loses its intended effect when you use it in every sentence.",1395187200,3,741,4.606060606060606

There's an intentional lack of scenic shots, trail info, history, or outdoor skills.  Fortunately it's only 69 minutes long. About 60 of which feature the trio of pretentious twenty-somethings complaining of how their fragile feelings were crushed by some perceived slight or because they didn't spend every waking moment together on the 2000+ mile hike.

Their accomplishment is even overshadowed even when they summit Katahdin where Ringleader says she feels no emotional high from the experience.  Overachievers can ruin a hike.

I was surprised they made it, because contrary to her belief, I highly doubt that Ringleader or Monkey could have finished on their own.  I'm even more surprised I made it through this dysfunctional trail soap opera.  I implore you not waste your time or money on this one.",1391212800,11,1060,5.311377245508982

It definitely doesn't focus much on the trail itself, so if you are looking for specifics about shelters, mileage, trail towns, etc., this may not be what you had in mind.  But it does give a good look at the very real emotional and relational challenges of the trail.  Hiking in a group isn't always going to be easy-- and it definitely requires that you reassess what it means to you to ""hike your own hike"". While there is a lot of emotion in the film (lots of yelling, crying, frustration, etc.), at least it depicts a very real part of the whole thru-hiking experience.",1379116800,,602,4.463636363636364
5609577,2,B00BEM7LXM,"About halfway through, I found myself wishing I could digitally remove these kids so I could just enjoy the scenery. I don't think there's anything wrong with delving into a little interpersonal drama in a hiking documentary, but the focus here is overwhelmingly on the dynamics among the three hikers, including many long scenes of crying and actual screaming matches. The problem with putting this kind of drama at the center of your film is that you really need to compel viewers to care about the people involved. This is a high bar for any filmmaker to meet. So, part of the problem was excessive self-involvement on the part of the filmmakers. But I concede that my own expectations were also to blame: I wanted some insight into the thru-hiking experience and wasn't that interested in the emotional lives of these young folks and their decidedly first-world problems. Viewers who enjoy reality TV might find more to enjoy here.

I will say this: I feel that a little more empathy on Kate's part could have helped her understand that Emily's situation on the trail and in life was fundamentally unlike her own and in some ways less advantaged, and such an understanding could have gone a long way to make things better for everyone. As the resentments between Kate and Emily build, you begin to sense in retrospect that Kate's chosen trail name, ""Ringleader,"" was in fact a bad omen.

Although I really didn't like the film, I have to give it a passing grade for production value. The videography and editing are quite competently done. However, I'm subtracting one star because I feel misled by the trailer on YouTube, which really suggests a more hiking-focused film.",1378857600,3,1676,4.83623693379791

5609583,4,B00BEM7LXM,"When viewing this movie, I think it's important to remember the intent of the producers.  For those watching this thinking it's about how to hike the AT....then you missed the point.  There are a LOT of other films out there dedicated to the physical trials of thru-hiking and the scenery.  This movie was more about the less tangible ""how"" of hiking the AT, how it affects the hikers lives in other ways than physical difficulty.  How Monkey had to push back applying for medical school by an entire year because he wasn't able to complete applications while hiking.  How Ringleader had to leave the AT because she didn't want to miss out on another life experience: graduating law school.  How Emily wanted to spend some alone time with someone she met and really liked, but how basically impossible it was for her to nourish a new relationship when there is no privacy.  The scene where Monkey learns about his dog is absolutely heartbreaking.  There has been a lot of criticism of the drama between Emily and Kate.  While I agree there is a lot of yelling and crying, I found it interesting to see how two very close, old friends can be brought to the point of not speaking due to the hardships of the AT.  Definitely makes me re-think who I would choose to hike with!  I also liked Monkey's insight about how he was expecting to feel some sort of ""zen,"" a revelation, or to figure something out, or SOMETHING, but didn't get it.  But Kate did.  I thought that was also interesting and very real.  That while an amazing experience, it wasn't necessary ""life changing"" for him in the way we all think it is (those of us who haven't done it).

These are the experiences you do not get from other films.  While the AT is a great accomplishment, there are other things that must be sacrificed to do it.",1367539200,,1802,4.515432098765432

5609585,3,B00BEM7LXM,"I had hoped for more focus on the trail rather than relationships.  The drama of relationships is something that is readily available in everyday life; whereas, trail experience could be something that is much more unique.",1367280000,2,222,5.166666666666667
5609621,5,B00BEM7LXM,"I have seen the movie twice now and let me start by saying it was awesome!  This is not your grandparents PBS documentary but instead it's more like MTV's The Real World meets Survivor.  Most people would assume that the video is about hiking the AT but it is so much more than that.  To me it was a look into relationships, bond, trust and triumph.  There are parts that I laughed so hard but at other times the tears were slowly making their way down my cheek.  In the end, it was an inspiring video that shows the complex nature of relationships and the beauty of our world.  I highly recommend!",1367280000,,598,4.294642857142857
5609622,4,B00BEM7LXM,"The movie highlights what happens when three people try to hike the Appalachian Trail together. Brother, sister, and sister's friend find out what the real meaning of ""Hike your Own Hike"" is. Is there drama? Almost too much, but overall, with the added bonus features the film is worth a watch. For me, it was worth the buy, but then again, I collect all hiking DVDs. If you can laugh at people's drama/crying, then go for it. Part of me found it friggin' hilarious!  YMMV",1367280000,2,472,4.552941176470588
5609623,1,B00BEM7LXM,"The three main characters are fairly likable by themselves but the friction between the two women is something I would not have put up with for more than a day or two.  The dynamic is so far from what I experienced as a thru hiker that I am in awe of their apparent masochism and something approaching sadism by one of the triple.  There was a lot of gratuitous cursing which would be grating to watch with youngsters interested in the Appalachian Trail although maybe they cut that out since my viewing.  The movie ""The Way"" is much closer to what it feels to thru hike the AT where new friends and love for the life that one is living that moment drive one forward from day to day.  The beauty beneath the dirt is the majestic and serene scene of the Appalachian Trail in the background.",1367193600,3,789,4.346938775510204
5609624,4,B00BEM7LXM,Loved the honesty. Humorous male interpretations of female drama! Entertaining. Fun to see old friends in the DVD. Can't imagine all the rewalking to film and having to carry the equipment.,1367193600,,189,5.129032258064516
5609625,5,B00BEM7LXM,"I've watched several AT movies, and this one stands out for several reasons. It's heartfelt, throughout. The intense emotions that come out in such a hike are on full display for all to see. You really feel like you are on the trail, with the characters, on good days and bad. Second, the videography is great. The image of hiking through the snow is one I won't forget. The extras are enough to buy the film, by themselves.",1367193600,,424,4.448717948717949
5609626,5,B00BEM7LXM,"Just wanted to let you all know how much I enjoyed the film. Not only was it inspirational, it was informational, and most of all it was beautiful. I'm in the middle of my thru-hike (mile 852, chillin in waynesboro, VA) it's great to come across sections on the trail that I remember seeing on your film. I've read many books and watched multiple films but beauty beneath the dirt was by far the most unique and beautiful!!! If you enjoy hiking, the outdoors, and espicially the Appalachian Trail....this is a must see!!!",1367193600,,521,4.612903225806452
5609627,3,B00BEM7LXM,"Yep, I said ""Hurt"". Not in a bad way. There just seemed to be a lot of emotional pain in the film. It was a unique blend of reality-drama and mountains. When I first heard about this film a year before it's release I was very excited about it. Unfortunately, on the Appalachian Trail side it didn't quite hold up. I never heard them mention one place or hot spot other than Katahdin.  I was somewhat disappointed only because I was expecting it to be something else. For what the movie is, a relative drama-fest set in gorgeous scenery, it was dead on. But I'm afraid it shouldn't completely hold up as a genuine Appalachian Trail film because, at it's core, this is far from what the Trail is about. Arguing in the woods... Actually, screaming at one another. There's a tad more than there should be for an AT film. I know it gets stressful out there sometimes but those are the parts you don't want to remember. But again, that wasn't the direction they took it. I can still appreciate this movie because at times it is fun and well-shot. Great camera work, great set-ups. It just didn't necessarily make me want to go be in the woods if I could potentially lose a friend over it, and you'll know what I mean if you see it.

All in all, I've watched a few times. It's worth at least one thoughtful viewing(if you don't mind obscenities).",1367193600,,1339,4.395161290322581
5609628,3,B00BEM7LXM,"This movie could've been so much better. I thought I was going to see a film about 3 friends thru-hiking the AT; instead, I watched a movie about 2 supposed friends arguing and yelling at each other throughout their hike. I wanted to know more about the trail, it's beauty, and the effort it takes to hike 2200 miles.  Unfortunately, the movie only focused on the 2 girls and their difficulties with each other.  While the film was somewhat entertaining, it was not what I was looking for!",1366156800,,489,4.545454545454546
5609629,3,B00BEM7LXM,"I had high hopes for this film. It starts out slow and is initially kind of hard to follow. There was nothing definitive of the hike beginning. This is the ""story"" of three people, Kate ""Ringleader"", her brother ""Monkey"" and Kate's friend Emily hiking the trail. I never understood how Emily and Kate were friends since there was all this terrible middle-school-esque drama with them. Maybe something was edited out. One issue was Emily was hiking too fast and Kate was hiking slowest of the group (I probably wouldn't have wanted to slow my pace either).  Another was when Emily meets a guy she likes. Kate seems almost jealous of this relationship. That stuff was annoying. Emily ends up leaving the group. And then the story becomes more brother-sister which was kind of cool.

I stopped watching this film multiple times throughout. But, I always went back. I think because of Brandon. He was funny and endearing.",1365984000,,917,4.834394904458598
5609630,4,B00BEM7LXM,"This doc is more interpersonal relationships and emotional interactions between a group of three young hikers, full of drama (some scenes I felt uncomfortable watching) and less trail and A/T lore.

However, the movie is about a whiny, controlling ""leader"" and the drama that ensues because of those qualities. We don't get to see much hiking but there IS a whole lot of crying, complaining, and cussing goin' on. We have watched many movies on the AT, but never one this bad.
If you enjoy high school drama, this is your movie. Enjoy.",1472256000,,424,4.182926829268292

8567303,1,B00BEM7LXM,"Not good! I would not have wasted pack space and weight to carry make-up and excessively large earrings with me. And if their packs had been actually loaded with the gear they needed for a 5 month through-hike of the AT they would not have been able to run any where. Every time there was a scene where they talked to the camera, they were camera ready. Not a realistic take on a lengthy through-hike. Maybe they filmed those sections after they had time to shower at a hostel or such, but it was more annoying than any thing. And I get that after you have spent a large amount of time with someone day in and day out, you start getting on each others nerves. That's part of the struggle. But when one of the 3 party members is filming you complain about how miserable you are with the group, it loses some of the authenticity. It made it feel fake, forced and just awkward. If you want to watch a quality documentary on hiking the AT, please watch the Flip Flop Flippin', Flip Flop Flippin' 2, and Flip Flop Flipped. They were excellent!",1459468800,,1038,4.328205128205128

It's a sweet story that made me want to do something similar with my brother.  The story line between Katie and her friend, Emily was very relatable, as a female I have been there before, a close long-term friendship becoming extremely tense because of a guy.  The producers, directors, etc. were not educated in filmmaking which, although in some ways detracted from the cinematography of the film, added something genuine.  Over all, the story is very coming-of-age-esque and watching the subjects at these significant cross roads in their lives attempt such a life altering challenge was really fun.  I'd love to see more from Katie, catch up with her wherever she is now, and attempting another large challenge.",1452038400,,818,4.985294117647059
