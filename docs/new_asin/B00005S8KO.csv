1658630,5,B00005S8KO,"It was a wonderful movie that went back in time to the days of the pioneers were a bear cub could run free and be safe. The scenery was spectacular and majestic and I would reccommeen it to anyone especially a family. The actors were all wonderful and they did a good job. The ending is left open for two sequels going either direction. I am looking forward to future movies from the prodcers.
PS thanks for the wonderful movie.  Thank you amazon.com for your couteous services.",1029888000,9,478,4.494252873563219
1658634,2,B00005S8KO,"This was kinda lame.  If you are looking for content for a young boy 7-8 years old, its OK, but for any other audience, its lame.  Don't get me wrong, I own the TV series in DVD and love it.  But this movie, not so much. Its lame...",1459296000,,232,3.7916666666666665

1658659,2,B00005S8KO,Well what can I say? I guess I was suffering from nostalgia for Grizzly Adams but believe me this is definitely not the cure.

1658660,5,B00005S8KO,This is a funny feel good movie that tugs at the heart especially when Jimmy played by (Miko Hughes) is talking to the bear cub about losing his parents. Dan Haggerty adds a great bit of straight comic relief while being the hero Jimmy needs to free the bear cub from the evil circus owner,1284422400,,289,4.2727272727272725
