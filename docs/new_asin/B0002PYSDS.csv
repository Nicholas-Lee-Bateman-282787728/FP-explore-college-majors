8030497,5,B0002PYSDS,"I had never seen a Lum and Abner film before this one and found it to be quite a nice surprise. The humor may be low-brow but much the same as the Ma and Pa Kettle series, it is often hilarious. In this one the seasoned duo from Pine Ridge become the toast of Washington!

It all begins when Abner (Norris Goff) invents a formula for synthetic rubber during the war years and follows the urging of a radio personality to bring the invention to Washington. Before they leave there is a humorous explosion from another experiment of Abners and an explanation of the ""point system"" by Lum (Chester Lauck) regarding the running of their general store that will bring some laughs.

Washington is all booked up but Lum and Abner find a bed to sleep in that is very comfy. The problem involves its location, and that's all I can say. It brings about one of the funniest moments in this likable and entertaining entry in the series.

The boys find themselves on a park bench dispensing their homespun wisdom about earthworms and other matters and soon every powerful mover in Washington is seeking their advice. Abner loses his memory after a bump on the head, however, and it's back to Pine Ridge for the boys.

All turns out well, of course, in this fun little film with many amusing moments and some genuine laughs. Fans of Ma and Pa Kettle will also love Lum and Abner in this fun little ""B"" series entry. A real gem.",1147564800,3,1413,4.465116279069767
