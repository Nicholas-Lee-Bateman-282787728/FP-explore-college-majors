913006,4,6304610599,"This miniseries adaptation of Herman Wouk's ""War and Remembrance"" is pretty faithful to the novel, which itself is a continuation of Wouk's ""Winds of War"" which is also a miniseries.
For those who are not familiar with these two novels, they are stories of the period immediately before, and then during, World War II.  ""War and Remembrance"" is set in the period immediatly after the Japanese bombing at Pearl Harbor, and encompasses the entire war.
This production suffers from the flaws inherent in most miniseries: it is too long.  The well-done and good parts are sandwiched in with a lot of extraneous material that in a true movie would have been left out and never missed.
This is essentially a number of interconnected stories, all of which have the Henry family (particularly Pug Henry, the patriarch) as the common nexus.  Pug Henry is an American naval Captain (later Admiral) in a variety of interesting assignments.  He has two sons: a naval aviator and a submariner.  Then there is the Natalie (the submariner's wife) and Aaron Jastrow story--two Jews caught up in Hitler's Europe and the Nazi persecution of the Jews.  The miniseries, like the book, tries to tell all of these stories--it never settles on one or two the way a movie would.
The result is mixed.  My favorite part by far of this series, which itself is worth the price, is the volume that deals with the Battle of Midway.  Wouk's Battle of Midway is far superior to the Henry Fonda movie on the same subject.  It is historically more accurate, faster paced, and overall far better done.  It is a magnificent tribute to the battle that turned the tide in the Pacific.  The Fonda movie practically ignores Admiral Raymond Spruance, the true genius of Midway.  That is rectified here.  The segment that deals with the submariner son and ""Lady"" Aster is similarly excellent.  All of the segments that deal with the Russians are superb.
Two portions of this miniseries really drag.  Natalie and her Uncle, Aaron, in Nazi-occupied Europe is far too long and not particularly well done to begin with.  The choices Natalie makes are asinine--she should have gotten and stayed the hell out of there, and when she doesn't, it becomes difficult to stay interested in her plight.  Further, the scenes at the concentration camp are ugly, unpleasent, and frankly not very good entertainment.  Certainly not fit for families with children to watch.  I imagine this is Wouk--he is said to have insisted that this portion be played out.  The result is not pretty, and most of this could have been done in a more summary and more entertaining fashion--the object should be to entertain, not to rub the viewer's nose in the horridness of the Nazis.
The acting in this miniseries is uneven.  I found the actor who played Byron (the submariner son) to be a poor substitute for Jan Michael-Vincint.  The Hitler character is poorly done; essentially a caricature.  I didn't think Jane Seymour was a particularly good Natalie, but she was wildly better than Ali MacGraw, who is rumored to have asked for a Presidential pardon for her acting in ""Winds of War.""  The rest are OK but not great.
If you are into the ""War and Remembrance"" story (as I am) you will want to own this collection--its strengths are the fact that it faithfully follows the story, and it truly does a wonderful job with the Battle of Midway, the submarine parts involving Byron, and the parts where Pug is in Russia.  You can skip over some of the other parts when re-watching it with the good old ""chapter search"" function of the DVD, and it does come in handy here.
Speaking of the DVD, the audio and video are both very good.  The chapters should have been more finely delineated--the entire Battle of Midway is shown as two chapters.  Four or five would have been appropriate.  Minor quibble.
Worth owning and watching.",1036886400,4,3851,4.77643504531722
913007,3,6304610599,"I'm a huge fan of Wouk's work, and watched the two miniseries when they ran in primetime.  I eagerly awaited this release, and bought it the day it came out.  I am disappointed with my purchase.
The video looks as though it was digitized with a PC and run through a cheap DVD creation program.  The interface is ordinary and out-of-place given the DVD content.
One other reviewer has pointed out that this series ends rather abruptly with episode 7.  Only by carefully reading the small print on the packaging is it possible to determine that the entire series is not contained within!  The 'extra' DVD, which features the story of the making of the film, is counted as one of the six DVDs in the set.  The producers might just as well have made it into another couple of episodes...at least the ending would not be so untoward, and I'd feel as though I'd gotten some semblence of my money's worth.
The really bad thing, for me, is that I enjoy this series so much that I'll probably buy part 2 when it appears next spring.  Maybe the music score CD it is slated to contain will be something of a redeeming factor.",1036368000,11,1114,4.431372549019608
913008,5,6304610599,I first saw War and Rememberance when I was 11 yrs old and only remember the brutal gas chamber scene in part 2 of the movie. I had no way to decipher whether it was acting or not and that is how I watch movies today. Let me tell you I will NEVER forget the mother and little girl as they went into the showers and came out and how the Kommadant looked at them. That scene has emotionally devestated me. I was wondering if you could tell me who played the mother and little girl? I would like to know,1019865600,2,500,3.9603960396039604
913009,5,6304610599,"...The entire ""War and Remembrance"" sets surpasses ""Winds of War"", if that can be believed.

A sleeper performance was Sky Dumont's portrayal of Count von Stauffenberg, Hitler's would-be assasin. He was faithful with Mr. Wouk's intentions, Mr. Curtis' intentions, and this world's historical record. Can you imagine the severe tension and anxiety that the Count experienced as he was arming the bomb, and, later making his getaway? Dumont did it all so masterfully!

The cinematographer's choice of raw film stock, and the techniques that he used to expose that stock was even BETTER than ""Winds"". You don't need no stinkin' airline ticket nor cruise ship ticket to experience Italy, Corsica, Poland, and unfortunately Theresienstadt.

And this segues to a stern warning to the overly sensitive viewer. I'd rate the depictions of Nazi brutality as strong, if not stronger than ""Schindler's List"", ""Saving Private Ryan"", or George Takei's (""Star Trek"") portrayal of a sadistic Japanese POW camp commandant in a production that eludes me right now. The brutalizations of Natalie and Aaron; the gassings, with full frontal nudity, which, as I recall, were the same as I remember in the original ABC TV telecast; the SS's additudes that their conduct was a ""funny"" thing; and SS man Blobel's flashback of his Babi Yar Massacre participation. This was as close to the real thing as it gets and it's NOT for the timid. For a gutslamming juxstaposition, consider ""Lady"" Aster's actions on the Big Submarine Raid.

All of you fellow Mitchumomaniacs, you'll just love the way his ""Pug"" takes complete charge when faced with the extreme hazards of naval combat. Yeah, Pug finally got his ship!

I'm a stickler for continuity, so when they touched off the Trinity A-Bomb shot, instead of Trinity stock footage, they used footage of OPERATION HARDTACK H-Bomb footage from the late 1950's, for some strange reason (more psychedelic to view, I suppose). I believe that there IS full color footage of Trinity in existence.

Jane Seymour's Natalie had a strange complimentary quality to Ali McGraw's Natalie, emphasizing the changing circumstances the character found herself in -- no time for the frivolous, more time for the serene and somber, pointing towards potential martyrdom.

Every time I view the death of Dr. Jastrow, played by Sir John Geilgud, I cry. He really made you love the old man.

As some of you out there may also know that Dan Curtis also produced the vampire soap opera ""Dark Shadows"", please keep an eye out for Dan's production assistant, Barbara Steele, as party hostess Elsa in Singapore. Barbara Steele was a ""favored victim"" in the Hammer House horror pics of the '50's-'70's. In the 1991 NBC-TV revival of ""Dark Shadows"", she played the role of Dr. Julia Hoffmann (role pioneered by the late Grayson Hall), the erstwhile healer of Barnabas Collins' (Ben Cross, role pioneered by Jonathan Frid) vampirism.",995587200,6,2919,5.092050209205021
913010,4,6304610599,"War and Remembrance"" picks up where the infinitely superior ""Winds of War"" leaves off. This continuation has a multitude of problems and is not nearly as cohesive or riveting as its predecessor, but it's still worth watching and re-watching. Be prepared for a long sojourn in front of your TV however, it's 23 total hours of viewing time.

 Some of the problems of its precursor have thankfully vanished, most notably, Ali McGraw and Jan-Michael Vincent have been replaced by superior actors (not a difficult chore, I assure you). Jane Seymour is hardly Ethel Barrymore, but she is leagues above the wretched Ali McGraw in the pivotal role of Natalie Jastrow. But the character of Natalie grates on the nerves. She makes one appalling choice after the other, until it's difficult to root for her. In addition, Seymour plays Natalie as a curiously flat character, and missing is the essential fire and determination of Wouk's Natalie. Hart Bochner is a marginal improvement over Vincent as the whiny Bryan, but his screen chemistry with Seymour is zilch. His scenes with Mitchum also betray his liabilities as an actor. Whereas Jan-Michael Vincent's Bryan was sympathetic and appealing, Bochner plays the part as a mean-spirited, spoiled and pompous prig: watch especially his scene with Mitchum when he whines about the picture of Pam Tudsbury on the table.
  And what of the magnificent Robert Mitchum, the glue that holds the series together? He is much too old for the part of Pug Henry here and his limitations show. Whereas he was a trifle elderly for the Pug part in volume one, this was filmed six years later and Mitchum is downright doddering. Is he still sexy? You bet. Is it still believable that Pamela Tudsbury (played a bit insipidly by Victoria Tennant) would travel across the world to lie chastely in his arms for 10 minutes? Well... it's a stretch, but I wouldn't say no to Mitchum, would you?
  The historical characters are, again, wretched. The Hitler they cast is absurd and one wonders how such a raving cretin as this could have held the German nation spellbound for twelve dark years. In fact, the Hitler scenes are riddled with absurd errors and if anyone believes that actual Hitler behaved like this ignorant maniac, please consult a non-fictional history. It's amusing that Pug Henry again meets all of the integral characters of WWII in one fell swoop: Hitler is on his dance card, as well as Churchill, Stalin, Mussolini and anyone else he chooses to see. It's silly, contrived and forced, but it still manages to rivet the viewer.

If you're expecting true-to-life World War II drama, forget it. But if you love Robert Mitchum, a good story of epic proportions, then this will suffice. I watch it every few years and love it despite its myriad problems.",977875200,12,2785,4.8752642706131075
913011,4,6304610599,"Herman Wouk and Dan Curtis score highly in what is one of the best ""historical novel"" to ""screen adaptations"" ever.  To begin with, Wouk's books are a masterpiece. Curtis managed to faithfully capture the heart of the written work as War and Remembrance continues where Winds of War left off.
As a historical primer, War and Remembrance powerfully continues to introduce you to key characters that drove World War II.  From Hitler to Stalin, Churchill to Roosevelt, they are all there.  At the same time Wouk developed some of the most poignant vignettes that fully illustrate the savagery of the ""Final Solution.""  These scenes rival those appearing in films such as Shindler's List.
The chemistry in casting shifts a bit from the first mini-series. With this continuation we are introduced to some changes. Barry Bostwick and Sharon Stone heat it up on the screen with a tempestuous affair in the sub-plot as Byron Henry's commanding officer ""Lady"" Aster and widowed sister-in-law Janice.  Of course with Stone being so notable these days, watchers of the mini-series are going to take notice of their performance.  Polly Bergan continues to perform flawlessly as Pug Henry's wandering, lush wife. There are others simply too numerous to mention.
The five year hiatis between the two installments was a bit too much for some of the already strained age differences.  One result-- we now pick-up Jane Seymour and Hart Bochner as key characters Natalie and Byron Henry.  Some great solo performances at times emerged especially as the plot shifts to Natalie's internment, but Seymour never really mastered the fierce independence written into Natalie's character or portrayed in the previous mini-series. Together Bochner and Seymour were not as enjoyable to watch. While Robert Mitchum ""is"" perfect as Victor Henry, it becomes much more difficult to put aside his actual age by this installment. In spite of that, Mitchum and Victoria Tennant (as Pamela Tudsbury) play to perfection opposite each other.
Having said that, the Winds of War-War and Remembrance combination remains to this day as the best mini-series ever produced.  It is worth saving for to have in a home library.  Our family continues to revisit it again and again.",973987200,21,2234,5.129476584022038
913012,4,6304610599,"War and Remembrance, the sequel to The Winds of War, starts off where the first ended. It's December 15, 1941 and the U.S. has just been attack by the Japanese Navy. Just like Winds, the historical content is extremely  (and sometimes distubingly) accurate. The acting is great, and the battle  scenes are as impressive as any ever filmed. If there is any downside to  this series it's that Robert Mitchum is just too old here for the part of  Pug Henry. In Winds he seemed to fit perfectly, however by the time Dan  Curtis got to filming W&R Mitchum had begun to truly look his age. It's  a small distraction, but it's there none-the-less. Upgrades in the casting  from Winds include Jane Seymore taking over as Natalie Jastrow from Ali  McGraw, Hart Bochner as Byron Henry (originally played by Jan-Michael  Vincent) and Sir John Gielgud as Aaron Jastrow taking over from John  Houseman. Downgrades include pretty much the whole German contingent (with  the exception of Jeremy Kemp). In Winds Hitler and Goring were dark,  sinister, and downright scary. Here they are portrayed as pompous and  overbearing, but also stumbling through the war almost by accident.  Probably not the most accurate of portrayals. I would recommend this to  just about anybody who is interested in WW II and is looking for a great  story. Just be forewarned: This mini-series has some of the most disturbing  scenes EVER filmed for TV. The mass murder of the Jewish people here is as  graphic and violent as you can possibly imagine. Add to that the journey  that Aaron, Natalie, and her son are forced to endure so that the author,  Herman Wouk, can show us the horrors of the holocaust, just absolutely rips  your heart. This mini-series is NOT for the faint of heart.",953769600,121,1751,4.77
913013,4,6304610599,"This mini-series has many problems: Mitchum is far too old for the part of Pug Henry, plus his romance with Pamela Tudsbury (ineptly played by Victoria Tennant) is not credible. And, the character of Natalie Henry  remains problematic: Although supposedly a fiesty go-getter, she makes one  foolish decision after another, so many that it becomes difficult to  sympathize with her. But the recastings are all improvements over  ""The Winds of War"": John Gielgud, Robert Morley, Jane Seymour  (without whom the project would have foundered), and even Hart Bochner are  welcome upgrades. And pros Polly Bergen, Jeremy Kemp, Topol, and David Duke  successfully reprise their roles from the first entry. And give director  Dan Curtis credit: No one before or since has presented a narrative with  this kind of force and sweep. Moreover, he presents the inner workings of  the Third Reich fairly convincingly. Ultimately, these attributes overcome  problems of characterization and script. I have to admit that I watch it  once a year, and it always holds my interest. (This review covers Part 2 as  well.)",953078400,13,1100,5.181818181818182

913015,5,6304610599,"Without doubt the most stunning work of filmmaking I have ever seen, ""War and Remembrance"" is a massive experience to watch that will haunt you always. This last great miniseries dramatizes the ENTIRE Second  World War, and does so at times with a raw honesty unseen before or since  on network TV.
Shot on location around the world, the soap opera stories  are always intriguing as we follow the various members of the Henrys, an  American Naval family as they encounter every major event of the war.
The  heart, though, is the central plot of Jane Seymour, in a heartbreaking  career-best performance as an American Jew trapped in Europe, and John  Gielgud, mesmerizing as her uncle. As they are slowly, inexorably pulled  into the Holocaust we follow them, step by agonizing step, to the final  horrors of Auschwitz, filmed entirely on location.
The movie is aided by  a brilliant, unforgettable score by Bob Cobert, especially the main theme  which seems to encapsulate every single emotion of the thirty hours into  its two minutes.
It may be a bit of a commitment to watch this, but it is  worth it. ""War and Remembrance"" is as close to time travel as is  possible, and makes that dark period of history come powerfully alive.",926294400,107,1232,4.777251184834123

  When the movie concentrates its efforts on World War II and the Holocaust, it is very interesting and very well done.  Those unfamiliar with World War II can learn from it, and maybe some viewers will go on to study the war and Holocaust in greater depth.

  Then there is the soap opera.  I found the story of Rhoda and affair unwatchable and eventually just fast forwarded.

  I thought that Jane Seymour was a great improvement over Ali McGraw.  McGraw often appeared to be reciting her lines and I found her annoying.  To be fair to McGraw, I found her character in the book to be annoying too.  The character only became of interest in the second book, just when Jane Seymour takes over the role.  Strangely enough, various characters often mentioned who beautiful Natalie ( Ali McGraw ) was, but by the time Jane Seymour ( who is incredibly beautiful ) took over the role, no one seems to ever mention her beauty.  Just a small point, but one I found odd.

If he had played Briny in the beginning, I would have been pretty mad at her for not choosing Slote.  As it was I was routing for Briny.

Robert Mitchem was too old for the part in both series, imo.  But he said very little.  Most of his lines were one liners, and very short clipped sentences. ""I'd say so"" ""Could be"" ""It's possible""  etc. He really had very little to memorize.

I don't have the 2nd W&R on DVD.  I have it on Video, and the whole story begins at  Part VIII when Natalie and her Uncle are already in the concentration camp.  That puzzled me.  The whole series about them in Europe and Paris, and the frantic escape from the Nazi who was insisting that Aaron do radio broadcasts for the Nazis was completely omitted on the video.  I had never played the 2nd Video, but had taped it from TV, therefore after I got the WoW on DVD, I pulled out the Video of W&R and I was totally confused thinking a whole year had been omitted, which it obviously was.  The reason I wanted to read the DVD review of W&R was to see if that part was included.  From what I can gather from the reviews, it seems that it was.  I'm glad it's all together again, even though I'm sorry the cast was changed.  It's a great story, and now I hope to buy the DVD's of W&R.",1218499200,2,1681,4.135802469135802

The replaced characters in the cast seemed a distinct improvement - more likeable, less jarring. But mostly, what I valued, was the sweep of the history of the war - the most important steps highlighted, explained, and put clearly into their context in the turnaround after Dunkirk and Pearl Harbour. I found the story of Midway especially illuminating. I hadn't realised that the odds were so heavily in favour of Japan (more than 3 to 1). Singapore, Guadalcanal, Stalingrad and the end of the Russian campaign were all fitted neatly into an easily accessible historical framework, so that for the first time I grasped the movement of the events. The manic side of Hitler was confronted head-on, which enabled a sympathetic portrayal of some of his generals - the extermination machine, and those who ran it (Eichmann, Himmler &c.) were brilliantly and horrifyingly shown up as the hideous distillation of evil that they were. Most powerful of all was the exposure of the cruel Theresienstadt deception - that this was done through the experience of characters we had journeyed with so long and so far and had come to love so much, turned it from cold historical fact, into heartbreaking human tragedy.",1208649600,2,1320,4.819383259911894

I loved this series when I was a teenager and remember watching this epic mini-series with my family. It has been years and I was happy to discover that the entire War and Remembrance was available in a complete DVD boxed set.

For those new to this series, I would advise watching the prequel ""Winds of War"" which is also available on DVD. ""War and Remembrance"" begins about a week after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, and once again viewers get to see the various members of the Henry family. Victor ""Pug"" Henry (Robert Mitchum) assumes command of the U.S.S. Northampton, while his eldest son Warren (Michael Woods) is a fighter pilot on board the U.S.S. Enterprise. Byron (Hart Bochner), Pug's other son is a torpedo officer on a submarine. Byron misses his Jewish-American wife, Natalie (Jane Seymour) who together with their infant son and famous uncle Dr. Aaron Jastrow (Sir John Gielgud) are trying to evade the deadly Nazi web, though events will soon enough conspire against them. Meanwhile, Berel (Chaim Topol), Aaron's cousin is a Soviet POW who ends up in the Auschwitz concentration camp. In Parts VIII-XII, we see the conclusion of this epic mini-series as the lives of the Henrys and the Jastrows play out against the backdrop of the war. The implementation of the Final Solution sees the destruction of European Jewry made all the more harrowing through the credible portrayal of Natalie, her young son and uncle Aaron and their collective suffering. The depiction of the Final Solution - mass shootings, gassings, etc is one of the most realistic and horrifying depictions of the Holocaust ever portrayed on screen (the other shows that come close are Holocaust, Amen, and Schindler's List, amongst others). The depictions of Nazi brutality are quite gruesome and I would advise caution against showing this to children under 12. Viewers get to see the leaders of both sides (the Allies and the Axis powers) - FDR, Churchill, Hitler, etc. make historic choices , and the eventual conclusion of the war.

This is an epic mini-series that is memorable and will forever remain a classic of its genre. Highly recommended and a must-watch for history buffs and those interested in WW II history and Holocaust history.",1204675200,,2303,4.930412371134021

913191,3,6304610599,"I'm no historian so I'm only going to deal with casting here and there are spoilers so stop now if you must. While I wholeheartedly agree that Seymour is a better actress than Ali MacGraw, I still liked Ali's brown-eyed spunk and I managed to overlook some of her godawful line (and shriek) delivery in WOW. Seymour's Natalie was a totally different character in W&R, and it was hard to make the transition because of that: she was quiet, diminutive, delicate. Very distracting. The great Gielgud is unsurprisingly a definite improvement over the great but not quite as great Houseman; the scene in the Nazi's office where you watch his old man get kicked about and this spoiled and pampered distinguished gentleman sees the reality of brutality up close and personal for the first time tears your heart apart. Bringing Barry Bostwick in for the marginal cigar chomping character from WOW was inspiring; I'm sure you can catch a young Sharon Stone in a typical role, but did you spot a young Michael Madsen in the submarine? For me, the most heartbreaking casting replacement was Jan Michael Vincent being replaced by Hart Bochner. Vincent may have looked constipated at times in WOW, as some  reviewer pointed out, but a constipated (and hung over, I'm sure) pretty boy is better than a pretty boy with a lump of coal personality (Bochner). Vincent had personality, as anyone who witnessed his classic Howard Stern appearance, knows - sort of a Brad Pitt on the outside and Mickey Rourke on the inside. And there was some chemistry between him and MacGraw in WOW; they looked like they were hanging out at the local bar in between scenes. But back to War and Remembrance....I admit I still have four hours left to view here, but the one scene in W&R with Seymour and Bochner I've witnessed so far was dead and dull - nothing there. Nothing...... Oh Mitchum fine, a little tired, but fine. Victoria Tennant aka former Mrs. Steve Martin - lovely, should have kept her hair consistent, but lovely. Spot Ian McShane - so much life, then poof, gone, you find out, in a voice-over by Tennant. Steven Berkoff makes a fun Hitler - definitely an improvement over the WOW Hitler, but I longed for Derek Jacobi or Anthony Hopkins who each played Hitler around that time in Inside the Third Reich and The Bunker. Now finally, for me, the unsung hero of both WOW and W&R: Leslie Slote, played by the late David Dukes, a highly underrated film, television, and stage actor who dropped dead of a heart attack on a tennis court in 2000 at the age off 55. In WOW he was flawless and center stage as Natalie's fiancee thrown to the side by Byron but still determined to win her back; in W&R he was thrown to the side by a whole host of people, possibly because his character was written that way in the book I did not read, or possibly because his star was no longer on the rise in 1988. He did manage to squeeze in a couple of outstanding scenes: one where he uncovers the evidence of German atrocities, and two, where he tells Byron on the phone that Natalie's situation is damnable and he's struggling to keep from falling apart. Leslie loved Natalie more than Byron; if Jan Michael Vincent did not convince you of his love for Natalie, Hart Bochner was not about to. But the way David Dukes played him, Leslie was the one who should have walked in and rescued Natalie and gotten the girl. The reason I am submitting this review now before finishing the series is because I'm bummed out that Leslie died so suddenly in that ambush. I just felt he was thrown out. A paratrooper? Leslie? Anyway, Dukes had real talent and substance. And he kept his hair consistent. Mark of a great actor: continuity.",1197331200,5,3684,4.598784194528875
913192,5,6304610599,"All the massive reviews here that point out bits of weak acting, regard the series as too long, bemoan the over-dramatization of Hitler (although honestly I have no idea - he obviously wasn't sane), cliched plot twists and some improbable plot elements are right. But they miss the point.

Despite its moments of dated narration, War and Remembrance really does transport you back to the 1940s. The length of the series precludes you from watching much else, so in a way you do participate in the war as an observer of the Henry clan. The main problem with history, in general, is that it happened to people we don't know. Through immersion, this film starts to erode that barrier. I.e., as Aaron and Natalie slip down the slope of Nazi persecution, you can't help but care about what happens. Ditto for the Henry men fighting in the Pacific - you want them to come home safe, because you've spent enough time with them to have felt like they were your siblings or children.

With regard to acting, Mitchum continues to be Pug Henry. I don't know how anyone else could have played that role. He's stoic, but in Wouk's books Pug isn't exactly a bubbly kind of guy. Jane Seymour is a much less obnoxious Natalie - I believe Ali McGraw would have been a distraction in this role, whereas Seymour conveys true fear and anxiety. John Gielgud, as others have mentioned, is riveting - just superb. Peter Graves looks out of date - somehow he has just always looked 1970s, and he doesn't quite fit here. You could argue that Polly Bergen (as Rhoda Henry) is superficial and that her romantic swings are trivial against the backdrop of world events. But Wouk probably knew this, and the truth is that even in desperate times a lot of us are more focused on our own heartbreak and loves, so even that soap opera -- poorly acted, in my opinion -- fits here.

Others have commented about how this series omits or glosses over the internment of Japanese Americans, the huge casualties in China and other aspects of the war. Honestly, I think this is ridiculous critique. What is amazing is how Wouk was able develop such a vast scope for his work and cover as much as he did -- Russian front, Pacific Theatre/Pearl Harbor, Italy, Poland, Turkey, the UK, the Desert War -- I mean, it's staggering. Someone will doubtless complain there wasn't enough emphasis on womens' role in the armed forces, and you could probably make that argument. But in the context of War and Remembrance it's a piffling complaint.

So now that I've written another massive review, and probably not as good as the others, I would set forth War and Remembrance as one of those films that everyone should see. With all its flaws, it succeeds brilliantly at animating an era slipping from out collective memories, in a way that has value as a history lesson and nonetheless pulls you in emotionally. Five stars, not because it's perfect, but because it's unrivalled in its effect.",1182729600,20,2939,4.657032755298651

There are character changes.  Jane Seymour replaces Ali McGraw (Natalie), Hart Bochner replaces Jan Michael Vincent (Byron).  Ben Murphy is replaced by Michael Woods (Warren).  Lisa Eilbacher was replaced by Leslie Hope (Madeline Henry).  John Gilgood replaced John Houseman (Aaron).  Sharon Stone also replace Deborah Winters (Janice), Robert Morley replaced Michael Logan (Alistair Tudsbury) and the Hitler character became far more dramatic by Steven Berkoff replacing Gnter Meisner.

913224,4,6304610599,"War and Remembrance' is the sequel to the highly successful book and the miniseries `Winds of war', by the bestselling American author Herman Wouk. The 1988 adaptation of the book picks up the story where its predecessor has left it off. Made during the 5-year period on location in 10 countries, `War and Remembrance' thusly remains one of the biggest achievements in the history of television. This 6-disc set encompasses the first part of the series; about 13 and a half out of 30 hours of film.

The basic plot continues with the aftermath after the attack on Pearl Harbor. Again we follow the American naval family Henry and their involvement in the various parts and phases of the war. The war story is roughly divided into two levels: Europe and the Pacific. The male part of the Henry family (the patriarch Victor Pug Henry and his sons Warren and Byron) are part of the great battles in the Pacific (Midway, Guadalcanal...), while the major focus has been put on the European stage and the tragedy of the holocaust, as seen and experienced through the eyes of Natalie (Byron's wife) and her uncle Aaron, who are both Jewish. This main plot has various personal subplots between the characters (the love between Pug and Pamela, the daughter of an old friend, for example) and just like in `Winds of war'; we see things from the perspective of the major historical characters (Hitler, Roosevelt, Churchill...). This part of the series ends in the ghetto Theresienstadt in Nazi occupied Czechoslovakia, where Natalie, Aaron and her small son, after escapades across the Europe, end up, with an uncertain future.

The impeccable attention to period details make this DVDs a delight to watch. The casting for the most part also deserves praise. Robert Mitchum (Pug), Polly Bergen (his wife Rhoda) and Victoria Tennat (Pamela) reprise their role in best of ways. Despite the fact Mitchum was a bit too old at that time; he still has the power and charisma his character is made of. There are also some changes in the cast, some better than other. Jane Seymour replaced Ali McGraw as Natalie here and she gave more than a satisfying performance  She is not as headstrong as McGraw was, but a more subtle incarnation of the character. Handsome-looking Hart Bochner replaced Jan-Michel Vincent as her husband Byron and he give a bit of an arrogant performance, without the boyish charm the character has in the book. John Houseman, who was too ill to reprise his role as professor Aaron Jastrow, was replaced by one of the greatest British actors of the last century, sir John Gielgud, who gave his usual outstanding and dignifying rendition.

But the greatest disappointment, as some of the other reviewers noted here, comes from the character of Hitler. In `Winds of war' Hitler was played by the late German actor Gnter Meisner, who played this role a few times during his career. Although a bit too old for the role, he managed to keep things under control, so despite the fact his Fhrer was stiffed and not altogether perfect, he gave a hint of the evil personage Hitler was. Here, however, the role is taken by the British actor Steven Berkoff and he did an awful job out of it. According to the interview on the extra disc, the director Dan Curtis wanted Hitler to be overplayed. The reasons remain unknown, although one can guess that he wanted to downgrade the character more by doing this. Berkoff's Hitler is a mixture of a buffoon and a yelling maniac. He portrays these sides in such an overacted manner that the result is anything but believable. This makes the Hitler scenes really uninteresting to watch and the way he behaves with his inner circle has no trustworthiness at all. Therefore it is hard to believe such a person could put a spell on the entire nation, let alone  be listened by his generals, most of whom are shown here as the observers who put up with him. The role of Hitler is a hard and yet manageable task for an actor who can make a character, as shown by Bruno Ganz in the recent movie `Downfall'.

It becomes obvious after watching the DVDs that the main task the authors put before them here was to show the holocaust in its most brutal and vivid form. And the way they do it remains unmatched in the TV history to this day. The story includes all the main points of `the final solution': the life in Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp (this is the first TV crew that got the chance to shoot in the original camp); the extremely graphic and violent scene of gassing during Heinrich Himmler's visit there in 1942; `Aktion 1005', where the Nazis cover the tracks of mass killing by firing squads (so called 'Einsatzgruppen') by digging up the graves and burning the bodies and in the last episode of this part, Babi-Yar massacre, where the Kiev Jews were brought outside the town  like cattle and shot by machineguns. All this is very disturbing to watch, so it is not suitable for small children. The most tragic scenes in this respect will, however follow, in the last part of the saga.

Having said all this, one has to mention the obvious slip ups. The most noticeable concern is the narrow scope used in reference to the holocaust, i.e. by showing it to be solely and exclusively a Jewish matter. There is no doubt that the Jews suffered far worse than any other nation, but the subject matter cannot be understood without mentioning all the other groups that suffered under the Nazis. Here there is no reference whatsoever as to all the others that perished in Auschwitz and other places: Slavs, Jehovah's witnesses, Gypsies, homosexuals, etc. This is something that should not have been done in the series of such importance and scale. The book and the movie `Sophie's choice' (where, incidentally, the same actor played Rudolf H, the commandant of the Auschwitz concentration camp) recognizes this problem by showing a Polish woman caught in the tragedy that is holocaust. Another evident thing is the fact that the authors tend to be too biased: the subtle message is all Americans are totally honest and good in each step of the way, while all the Germans are bad and vicious. A bit more of objectivity would be more than welcome.

Despite all this, the series remain more than plausible for anyone interested in World War II fiction. The bonus DVD includes two behind of scenes documentaries that show the way this epic was written, made and cast, through the interviews with the director/producer Dan Curtis, the author Herman Wouk and the cast.

913230,4,6304610599,"War and Remembrance starts out strong with actual marines (not actors) raising the flag at Pearl Harbor shortly after the attack on it. But the viewer soon realizes that this is not the ""Winds of War.""

Several actors have been changed for this sequel including Jane Seymour replacing Ali McGraw as Natalie Jastrow. Seymour does not look or act like the dark and dusky character from the book, which may be the director's doing. Yet, her acting is far superior to McGraw's, so it is an overall improvement.

However, the story does seem to labor with small intrigues and bureaucratic bumbling that was not in the first story that sets the stage for the Henry family being flung world-wide by the ""Winds of War.""

The most interesting part for me was Victor Henry and his son in the historic battle of Midway, which was one of the three most pivotal battles of the war. (According to Wouk, this the greatest victory in American naval history and the war's best ""general,"" Admiral Raymond Spruance are almost lost in naval archives.)

It comes down to this. How curious are you to find out what happened after the ""Winds of War"" ends? Chances are you will want to find out what happens to them all. In that case, you will buy it, or at least borrow it.

913233,3,6304610599,"First, let me say that I've seen this show 3 times at this point in my life. The first, I vaguely remember, when it was released, watching it with my parents (when I around 7), the second time when it aired on ""The History Channel"" around the mid-90s and the third, just very recently, with this set (and the ""Winds of War"" and the second set for ""War and Remrembrance"").

With each time I've seen it, my opinion of the show has decreased. However, being able to watch the entire show in a very short span of time (in 1 week) on the DVDs have allowed me to collect my thoughts on the show much easier.

The first half of ""War and Remembrance,"" is certainly inferior to ""Winds of War."" The first reason is that the many actor changes that were made. Most notably, Natalie Jastrow, who is now played by Jane Seymoure, is nothing like the character we left in ""Winds of War.""

In the former series, Natalie was a strong willed academic type individual, very progressive, and fierce, at least that is how Ali McGraw played her. Jane Seymoure's version of the character seems to be nothing more then a damsal in distress aimlessely following her idiot uncle.

Speaking of which, this brings us to the character that annoyed me the most of the entire series, Aaron Jastrow, played by John Gielgud. In the first half, you realize, this character is the sole reason that everyone is in the mess they are in to begin with. Of course, one can't blame actors for this (and I'm not -John Gielgud plays the role well), but evidently Herman Wouk could find no better way to have Natalie and Aaron stuck in Europe other then by a series of key, naive, stupid (to such a degree you wish to strangle Aaron) decisisions Aaron makes in the beginning of the series. Or Wouk has the beaucrats slow their offical paperwork down to such a degree that it doomed them. Of course this seems more realistic, since beaurucrats can be very ineffecient; however, I wonder if they would have bunggled so much that Aaron and Natalie (both American citizens) would have been delayed for more then a year; even with a direct request from the President of the United States.

To say the least, the whole plot element in that respect is dubious, but it is historical fiction so much can be forgiven in this area. As for the plot outline itself, the director described the two main goals for the show were to depict the ""Pacific War"" and the Holocaust, as the Jastrows/Henrys saw it. This is all well and good, but watching the show, one get's that they succeeded very well in the later, but failed miserably in the former.

Unlike the European campaign in the show, the enemy (this case the Japanese) in the Pacficic Theatre don't get ANY speaking roles in the show. At least with the Germans, we had characters like Brgd. Gen. Von Room (a ficticious character), who gives the viewer a inner-glimpse at how the Third Reich military/political command operated.

Yet, the Japanese are reduced to a bunch of things that are shot up in occasional submarine surface battles or fleet actions. It all is very fitting with Western/Hollywood perception of Asians in film to begin with, abstract/exotic/inhuman so I am not suprised. As for the rest of the Pacific War, the Sino-Japanese war which ate up the second most casualties in the all of WW2, at least 14+ million on the Chinese side and most of the Japanese casualties on theirs is not even mentioned passively in the series.

As far as ""War and Remembrance"" is concerned, it does not exist. This is certainly not a gripe for the director or the series production, but one with Wouk and his work. Yet, for a series that claims to be so all-encompassing/Epic drama of WW2, it seems that it wasn't that ""all-encompassing"" and unfortunatly, very standard as far as Hollywood WW2/Movies/Drama goes.

Further, the Asian-American internment durring the war gets nothing but a passive mention in the show, I find it intresting that Wouk couldn't have any of his characters deal with any of these people, since I'd assume he was so against things like this (since he was a Jew himself).

Yet, we get nothing, but one has to also observe that this series was produced in the eighties, a time when Anti-Asian/Anti-Japanese racist sentiments were rising in America because of increased economic competition (certainly not an excuse), but it could explain the nature of Pacific Campaigns portrayl very well once put in this light.

Thus contrary to what the director has stated, ""War and Remembrance"" has very little to do with the ""Pacific War,"" and almost everything to do with the European Campaign, which is portrayed in much vivid detail (at least politically). Steven Berkoff, who plays Adolf Hitler, certanlly looks much more like the dictator then the previous fellow in ""Winds of War,"" but, the way he plays the role is a bit more cartoonish then it was in that show.

Hitler is reduced to a 24/7 screaming lunatic, being patiently tolerated by his well-meaning generals (a situation I find a little hard to swallow -especially after reading some authoritative biographies on the man, such as Toland's), who wish to do the right thing, but can't, and must therefore dutily follow their Fuhrer's orders. Goering is just a fat yes-man (At least he got some substantive speaking parts in ""Winds of War."") Other high-ranking NAZIs that are portrayed are Himmler and Eichmann. Adolf Eichmann is played the best, however, as a very sinister organizer of the Final Solution; which only begins to take shape in the first half of the series. And of all the higher ups in the NAZI party, only Eichmann actaully meets any of the ficticious main characters.

Techincally, ""War and Remembrance"" is not much to look at, as it has aged rather poorly. The special effects are models etc. quite standard fair for the time. Although, most of the fighting scenes are reused stock footage from the actaul war or some stock footage from previous war films (i heard some film was used from the ""Longest Day"" , but I cna't confirm this). The audience is too be much more concerned with the characters and their interactions (and for the most part, I was) then for gritty scenes of violence (if this is what you're looking for, look elsewhere).

Thus, ""War and Rememrbance"" is more describle as a Soap Opera that takes place in WW2, rather then a ""War series."" Alot of the romance subplots are very cliche (especially those with Rhoda Henry and those with Sharon Stone's character), and I found myself skipping most of these scenes altogether (the magic of DVD).

In any event, if one has not seen this series, it is worth one's time to watch. But be warned, one will not find anything particuarly revolutionary in the series (with respect to the coverage nor the portrayl or anything else for that matter), except with the Holocaust, which were probably the scenes I remember the most from when I saw it as a little boy. In fact, I will go as far as say that the Holocaust scenes are much more intense then those found in Schindler's List. However, most of those scenes are in the second DVD set.

In any event, save those scnese of the Holocaust, the rest of the series should be watched for entertainment, not for accuracy or realism (but this goes for any production from Hollywood).

Added Note: Robert Mitchum is in fine form, I think, however others do consider his performance as extremely dry in this series... I just take it that this is ""Pug's"" character, but many claim he was just not trying (One of those people being Stephen King in his commentaries for ""The Storm of the Century"" a more recent TV-Mini series).",1146700800,8,7611,4.684880239520958

Well, I watched this mini-series on television when I was 7 years old, and scenes from it still stick out in my memory almost 18 years later! I'm buying the set today and plan to eventually share this mini-series with my own children, so that they ""remember to never forget.""

For those who wish to protect their children from images of violence, be warned, there are fairly graphic depictions of the atrocities committed during the Holocaust.  My personal opinion is that depictions of violence are everywhere, and these depictions at least have the benefit of conveying, in a manner that mere words cannot, an important aspect of world history.",1142640000,10,721,4.845528455284553

Dan Curtis spared no effort to make the horror of WWII come through, especially in the his decpiction of the German atrocities towards the Jews.  This is a must have for the video reference library of any one who has an interest in WWII.

The cast has been upgraded from ""Winds of War"" with new and better suited actors for the parts of Aaron and Natalie Jastrow, they really gave superb performances!

An epic such as ""War and Rememberance"" may never be repeated again.",1137110400,6,629,4.443478260869565
913277,5,6304610599,"Having been born in 1940, and having spent my adolescence and early adult years researching everything I could find regarding the Nazi ""final solution,"" I found the filming of ""War and Remembrance"" to be a superb rendering of the immensity and brutal atrocity of the dark side of human experience.  I believe that it may never be matched for its honest recreations of the horrors that can be committed by maniacal people, if allowed.  It is for this reason that my wish is that every teen reaching adulthood should be exposed to this production, somehow, to help them realize how important it is to keep such actions from reoccuring, ever.  This production is probably the most awesome and important depiction of WWII ever compiled, weaving documentary style segments into the fictional storyline in an irresistably fascinating fashion, keeping interest riveted to the events.

  As for the complaints I have read regarding the amount of time spent filming nonessential plot segments, I find the  footage spellbinding for the reminiscence of a time the world will never see again.  The antique cars, which I vaguely remember from childhood, and the railroad cars, which can only be seen in museums, and the WWII planes, which my own daughter is obsessed with, are woven into the storyline in such a way that you can almost believe you are part of the scenes portrayed.  These scenes are essential to setting the stage for the really important elements of the story, in my opinion.

  As far as the choices of the actors, Jane Seymour plays a very believable Natalie, given the storyline, but definitely lacks the irresponsible vivacity of Ali McGraw from the Winds.  Nevertheless, Jane is an excellent actress and does a magnificent job portraying the most difficult role of the series.  John Gielgud IS Aaron to a T.  And although there is much talk about Mitchum's advanced age, he also IS Pug Henry, and no one else could have improved his great performance.  I was a little ambivilent regarding Berkoff's portrayal of Hitler.  Sometimes, he seemed to really capture the insanity of the man, but at other times, he seemed too vapid and unreal - although, for all I know, that may have been the essence of Hitler, so I wouldn't be too judgemental.  All in all, the characters are so real and so captivating, that I give them all ten stars.

  See this movie and make sure your adult children see it.  I can think of no better way to make sure that we do not EVER repeat this history.",1137024000,7,2485,4.770491803278689

913281,5,6304610599,"Yes, I've seen hundreds of WWII/Holocaust films.  No other has the emotional impact as well as the realism of War and Remembrance. Of course it is the longest such film ever made at over 30 hours, which gives director Dan Curtis the time to portray everything of Herman Wouk's book.  Made as a sequel to the miniseries Winds of War, this is superior in many ways.  The first half on this DVD set covers the years 1941-1943, beginning with Pearl Harbor and weaving the Henry family into all the events of the war.  Jane Seymour is excellent as Natalie and John Gielgud perfect as Aaron as they play cat and mouse as American Jews stuck in Europe while Aaron's ""good friend"" Beck keeps tracking them.

  With a cast of thousands, an exhaustive list of stars, and on location in ten countries, a lesser director could never have pulled it off, and Dan Curtis rises to the occasion of recreating the events to a tee, including graphic depictions of the Holocaust.  A few different storylines run through.  Most interesting to me is that of Natalie and Aaron and their attempts to escape Europe.  Gielgud and Seymour cannot be praised highly enough for believability and complexity, their plight being the most emotion provoking.  Milton Johns gives a chillingly intense portrayal of Eichmann.  The next of interest is Slote (David Dukes) as a U.S. official in Europe trying to bring the Holocaust to the attention of Roosevelt, but to no avail.  Pug (Robert Mitchum reprising his Winds of War role) has an interesting segment in Russia, but the Pacific War, submarine battles and all, though well done, didn't hold my interest.

  Prisoners at Auschwitz attempt to smuggle out film to the Allies, and the depiction of Holocaust events is realistic beyond belief.  Volume 1 contains the Baba Yar massacre, Himmler observing a ""Special Action"", and the digging up of mass graves.
Volume 2 is even more graphic.  Steven Berkoff as Hitler is great with his over-the-top ranting and raging...hey you can't BE too over-the-top in portraying Hitler.  Volume 1 ends after living in relative luxury with Aaron and Natalie being transported to Theriesenstadt.  On the way a lady says, ""We bought an apartment there with a view by the lake"".  Needless to say there was no lake.

  War and Remembrance towers over Schindler's List in every way.  Up to the present W&R is the most realistic dramatic portrayal of the events.  Some have learned the lessons of WWII and the Holocaust.  Those currently running the world have not.",1113609600,10,2510,4.844705882352941
913282,4,6304610599,"Winds of War was quite a feat to accomplish and War & Remembrance is as well. The downside is length but given the depth and breadth of the book that is understandable. Many have already commented ont he change of actors. I personally found Ali McGraw miscast but an excellent actress in Winds and Seymour excellent as Natalie in this. John Gielgud is marvelous as Aaron Jastrow. Jan Michael Vincent was good as Byron but personal problems (drinking and other things) made him impossible to use again.

Parts 1-7 take us from Dec 1941-1943. The Henry marriage is strained, Warren dies at the Battle of Midway, and Natalie & Aaron are trapped in Europe. This part of the series does show the war events well on both sides. Hitler and the top generals did not agree on the war plan. Brautisch did resign (some say fired) due to his ill health and Halder was fired for disagreeing with Hitler. The inaccuracy is that Brautisch was connected to the conspiracy to remove Hitler (he was not but Halder was).

The series does not flinch from showing the horror of the Holocaust. The events of Babi Yar and the attempts to recover the dead and destroy the remains are true to history. The scenes are gripping, realistic, and not for those squeamish about seeing how brutal and degrading the Nazi's were to Jews.

Milton Johns conveys the quiet methodical evil of Eichman (there is an error in the series, he is identified as Colonel Eichman when his highest rank was Lt. Colonel). And escaping Jews faced numerous challenges about where to go. The routes were few and full of trials (and treachery). Getting into Spain and then Portugal was not easy at all (they turned Jews away at the borders routinely even if they had transit papers).

The death of Warren and the Battle of Midway are handled well for the most part. Where it is less accurate and more fiction is the conflict between Captain Miles Browing and Admiral Spruance (who knew from intercepts the strength of the Japanese fleet) which did not happen. In fact, Spruance praised Halsey's staff but Browing was irritating to everyone (he had that kind of personality)as historians have noted.

This part ends with Natalie and her uncle arriving at Theresenstadt, the so called model ghetto. The deception the Nazi's played to get Jews to willingly go there is well depicted and many did arrive thinking they had nice apartments awaiting them. And in fact it was just a jumped up transit camp for Jews on the way to Auschwitz and death.

Overall you will enjoy this part of War & Remembrance but sometimes the jump from the scenes of horror to other parts of the story are not done well. Herman Wouk, unlike Winds, did not have total control over the script and it shows at times.",1112140800,2,2732,4.657676348547718

913322,4,6304610599,"WAR AND REMEMBRANCE picks up right where THE WINDS OF WAR left off.  Story-wise, part one of WAR AND REMEMBRANCE is every bit as good as THE WINDS OF WAR, too.

However, there are a number of major cast changes here which are a bit disconcerting.  The switch from Ali MacGraw to Jane Seymour is the one I found the most troubling; Jane Seymour may be a better actress overall, but her Natalie lacks the confidence and self-reliance of Ali MacGraw's Natalie.  The change from Gunter Meisner to Steven Berkoff as Hitler is also a bit of an adjustment, as is seeing Sharon Stone as Janice.

On the other hand, there are some improvements.  Hart Bochner is a better Byron than Jan-Michael Vincent, and Sir John Gielgud is truly amazing as Aaron Jastrow.  It does take some time to get used to seeing different actors in all these roles, especially if watched back-to-back with THE WINDS OF WAR.

Robert Mitchum, Polly Bergen, David Dukes and Victoria Tennant are all perfect in their roles, as they were the first time around.  Like THE WINDS OF WAR, WAR AND REMEMBRANCE is just a pleasure to experience, with an epic scope juxtaposed with the intimate details of the lives of the Henry and Jastrow families.

Dan Curtis does not shy away from the realities of war and the Holocaust here, and some scenes are visually and emotionally intense.  This only adds to the realism, though, and serves to make the story that much more compelling.

And, of course, Part 1 of WAR AND REMEMBRANCE is only part of the story -- the middle of the trilogy, so to speak.  Part 2 has to be seen in order to complete the story, which makes me wonder why both parts weren't simply packaged together for DVD.",1090713600,8,1684,4.554817275747508
913323,4,6304610599,"If you sat through Winds of War, then you must sit through this
production. Several of the leads have been replaced, for the better. True, Mitchum shows his age, but for me, he IS Pug, no matter what. The Henry family struggles on through the early days of WW2, in almost constant upheaval. This doesn't paint war as a glorious battlefield, nor does it wallow in angst. The story is being told and carries you along, because you have learned to care for the Henrys'. The almost maddening situation regarding Natalie and her uncle will frustrate the viewer, but in its' final conclsusion, the horror is told unflinchingly and true to historical fact. It's well worth the time and the money.",1086048000,7,689,4.702479338842975
913324,4,6304610599,"As historical miniseries go, the ""Winds of War"" and its sequel, ""War and Remembrance"" add up to one of the most ambitious made-for-TV productions of all time.  (A confession here: It's me Mum's favorite video series.)  It follows Herman Wouk's two massive tomes which put the reader at the center of Worlds War Two, through the vehicle of Captain Victor `Pug' Henry and his family.  Victor and his wife take tea with Hitler, meet Stalin and Churchill, and share martinis with Roosevelt. Son Byron (""Bry"") Henry  manages to get stranded in Poland during the 1939 German invasion, and Pugs other son, Warren, joins the navy. Daughter Rhoda goes into the radio business in 1940s New York, the center of the universe.  Pug's daughter -in-law Natalie Jastrow, a Jew, is imperiled in fascist Europe.
""Winds of War"" is the more interesting of the two books and mini-series, since it covers the odd time from just before the start of the war in Europe in 1939, and ends at Pearl Harbor in December 1941.  Wouk uses American's neutrality (while Roosevelt positions for America's entry into war) to allow his characters to travel to Britain and Russia,, and to get Pug Henry assigned as military attache to Berlin.
Most of the script is faithful to Wouk's book, and the movie is heavily stocked with first-tier actors.  Robert Mitchum is an excellent, authoritative elder-statesmanlike Pug Henry in ""Winds of War"", even though he becomes more of a walking statue in ""War and Remembrance"", unable to visibly change facial expressions.  Lisa Eilbacher does officer's wife Madeline Henry to the nines, enjoying the status of being high in the ratings' list while casting nets elsewhere.  Jan Michael Vincent, staple of many 1970s miniseries, does OK as a the black-sheep Bry.  Of the main characters in ""Winds of War"", only Ali McGraw is problematic.  Fortunately, the producers replaced McGraw in the sequel with the leaner, more serious Jane Seymour, which avoided  unthinkable scenes of McGraw (""But Bry-an!') wallowing  about in a death camp.  Ralph Bellamy's Roosevelt ius unmatched anywhere.
This is a first class, high quality production, and well recommended.  Despite its scope, it avoids major distortions of history and is, best of all, fun to watch.
Recommendations:  Herman Wouk's novels, ""Winds of War"" and ""War and Remembrance""
Olivia Manning's WW2 novels, ""The Balkan Trilogy"" and ""the Levant Trilogy"", and if you can find it on tape, the British miniseries ""Fortunes of War.""",1064966400,11,2479,5.068965517241379

""The Winds of War"" & ""War and Rememberance"" were the best mini-series of all time, and were good enough to have been released theatrically.  Only problem with them is the time committment.  They are each approximately 15 hours long, so don't expect to sit down and watch this in one night.  If you commit the time (I recommend popping in a disk/night), you will surely not be disappointed.

The DVD is superb as it captures the essence of the novel and the times with scattershot views, of simultaneous events, leaping from Hawaii to Italy to Midway and back to Russia, yet never confusing the viewer, always providing insight and temporal clarity.
This is a series to be conserved on disc for the ages.  It will be viewed by generations to come, perhaps stored in some new medium not yet invented, but, captured for all time to come and to remember as the title notes.
