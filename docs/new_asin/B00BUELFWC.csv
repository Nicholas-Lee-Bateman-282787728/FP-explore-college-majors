8574031,3,B00BUELFWC,Good twists. Pacing was a bit uneven and there were several points where the camera would linger for no apparent reason. Acting was a bit over the top but it's always hard to judge acting when the voices are dubbed.,1527206400,,215,4.4
8574032,4,B00BUELFWC,Very good film with a surprise ending that I did not expect. Good acting and fascinating alien creature.,1440201600,,104,4.833333333333333
