The movie has a weak, absurd storyline, but nevertheless, the performances by the cast keeps you entertained.",1515715200,,289,5.148936170212766

7790688,4,0783224435,"I've seen several Deanna Durbin movies, but in this one she was almost obnoxious and too assertive, which made her less attractive. Mistaken identities is a common theme in comedies, and this is used also here. Mary Collins (Deanna Durbin) is kidnapped by Donald (John Dall) and his third cousin (Don O'Connor) who believe she had dealings with Donald's grandfather, the late Reed, who was very wealthy and recently passed away. Cancelled checks to her name make them believe their grandfather was sending them to her, but he really had been sending them to her spinster aunt, also named Mary Collins. She pretends that there is a baby in the story and tries to bribe them for a million dollars.

The movie was not as funny as her other ones, although there were a couple of funny scenes. One in particular was when Deanna Durbin was in jail and the jailer sang opera with her. It was beautiful singing and very funny as she tried to get the key from him while he moved around her.

A couple of other things that stood out - Don O'Connor loved the fiance of Donald, Clarissa, but you never saw them together or even showed sympathy for each other. Also, John Dall appeared slow and not well matched with Deanna Durbing's witty and sharp character. Even when they kissed, it didn't feel romantic.

However, being a Deanna Durbin fan, I still love her music and acting. I wish she had made more movies...",1342656000,,1402,4.6
7790689,5,0783224435,"i really enjoyed this movie a lot mostly because of the music.  although she has an operatta voice she shows she can sing something other than opera.  with her singing in this
movie it makes it very enjoyable.  the movie is so enjoyable with a very young donald o'connor singing and dancing.  this is such a fun movie with all the chaos going on.  just like all her movies it has a little of bit of everything for everyone, comedy, drama, singing. i feel that is what makes her movies like this one so enjoyable.  the plots aren't always the best but the movies are still enjoyable and so much fun to watch.",1260489600,,607,4.327433628318584
7790690,4,0783224435,"SOMETHING IN THE WIND (1947) was an attempt by Universal at getting their premier songbird, Deanna Durbin, away from operatics and into a more 'middle of the road' popular style of music.  The result was this cute romantic comedy about switched identities and family intrigue.

Mary Collins (Deanna Durbin) is a bright young radio disc-jockey who lives with her elderly aunt, Mary Senior (Jean Adair).  When the patriarch of the rich Read family passes away, he leaves a large chunk of his estate to Mary Senior--his one-time mistress!  But thanks to a case of mixed identities, the younger Mary is the one who's implicated in the Read family scandal!

Donald O'Connor, Universal's promising young musical star of the period, is Deanna's appealing costar in this bright, sassy musical comedy.  Things get off to a brilliant start when Deanna swings her way through ""The Turntable Song""; and O'Connor's zany dancing skills are later showcased in ""I Love a Mystery"".  The score also includes ""Something in the Wind"" and ""It's Only Love"".  Deanna also gets to share a memorable scene with legendary opera tenor Jan Peerce.

Definitely one for the Deanna devotee in your family!",1210982400,,1174,5.041450777202073
7790691,4,0783224435,"Something in the Wind is a fun movie and a great example of a typical Deanna Durbin film. It has music, a great cast, and a fun but unimportant storyline that shows Durbin's knack for comedy. It starts with radio personality Mary Collins (Durbin) whose life is changed when a wealthy man accuses her of being his newly deceased grandfather's mistress. She learns that they have mistaken her for her aunt who had a romance with the old man when she was young. To get back at the ill-intending family, Durbin plays along and plans to teach them a lesson. In the process, she gets involved in a love triangle that includes the two young men of the house, Donald (John Dall) and Charlie (Donald O'Connor).

Durbin and O'Connor entertain through song with several great numbers. Durbin's range goes from pop music (""The Turntable Song"") to opera (""Il Miserere""). O'Connor is great in his animated ""I Love a Mystery.""",1149120000,2,911,4.729559748427673
7790692,5,0783224435,"Deanna Durbin traded opera for pop, and sentimental for sassy, in this bright and bouncy comedy. This was the truly fun side of Durbin and she is radiant in a film that lets her really shine. This was Donald O'Connor's first film after leaving the service and he has never been better. John Dall is also terrific in director Irving Pichel's breezy and charming film that is fun to watch.

Based on a story by Fritz Rotter and Charles O'Neal, the screenplay of Harry Kurnitz and William Bowers has just the right touch, giving each member of the great cast some fine and funny moments. It also gives Donald O'Connor an opportunity to do a routine about radio mysteries that rivals his work in ""Singin' In the Rain."" Charles Winninger and Jean Adair are splendid also, as are the songs by Johnny Green and Leo Robin. For those fond of Deanna Durbin, but looking for something a bit lighter musically than is her usual film fare, ""Something In the Wind"" is your ticket.

Everything about this film is a delight, especially its star. Dressed by Orry Kelly and with a new hair style by Carmen Dirigo, the ""new"" Durbin, as advertisements touted her, loosens up and has a ball in a film that is breezy from start to finish. Opera fans aren't slighted as she gets to sing a beautiful version of ""Miserere"" with Met star Jan Peerce, but it can't keep this film from having fun for long. Deanna gets to sing ""The Turntable Song"" and the romantic ""Something In the Wind"" between the comical situations. She also gets to do the suggestive ""Don't You, Daddy?"" as she has some fun making John Dall's character squirm.

Deanna is disc jockey Mary Collins. She does 60 minutes of music every morning at 10:00 on WFOB, which includes her singing pop numbers like ""The Turntable Song"" in her stocking feet. She really needs a sponsor and has an audition for one that gets sidetracked when a rich society fella named Donald (John Dall) pops into the station informing her of her benefactor's death, and accusing Mary of being less than virtuous in obtaining his help.

Mary blows him off in a huff since she doesn't have a clue what he's talking about, only to discover later that it is her aunt Mary (Jean Adair) who had been receiving the money used to raise her. It seems she had been engaged to the deceased in question. She was not of his station and when he married another, regret prompted him to support Mary all through the years to help raise her niece.

Thinking the old man had a young thing on the side because both Mary and her aunt have the same name, his wealthy heirs are looking to pay her off to avoid scandal. The feisty Mary refuses to discuss it, so Donald and Charlie (Donald O'Connor) kidnapp her! It's just to get her to talk about signing papers and how much it will cost them to get her to go along, of course, but since Mary doesn't care much for these snobs, she has some fun asking for a million. She'll need that much at least in order to raise her ficticious ""love child!""

Donald is engaged to the very suitable Clarissa, but it's Charlie who is in love with her, and when he and Mary hit it off they hatch a scheme to get both what they want. As it always does, things get complicated when Mary realizes she isn't acting anymore and really does like Donald. Donald has the same thought but Mary is made to feel unworthy so runs back home after singing the sad but lovely, ""It's Only Love.""

Don't shed any tears yet, however, as it only takes about two seconds for the scoundrel in the family, Charles Winninger, to see a financial windfall. The old rascal, Chester, has Mary put in jail until she signs those papers and agrees to give him half! She wangles a phone call after a duet with guard Jan Peerce, only to get in touch with a very tight Donald and Charlie, who can't seem to piece it all together. Dall and O'Connor are hilarious here but have to sober up quickly if everything is going to work out like it's supposed to in the movies!

Donald O'Connor and The Four Williams Brothers get to sing a soft version of  ""The Turntable Song"" and Deanna gets to play against type in this film both Durbin fans and classic film fans will love. Though available as one of the films in the ""Sweethearts"" dvd collection of films, the vhs is a bit superior and highly recommended for Deanna's fans. ""Something In the Wind"" is something really special among Durbin's films and you don't want to miss out on all the fun.",1132963200,5,4430,4.4525277435265105
7790693,3,0783224435,"Reviewers have not been kind to Deanna Durbin's post-1946 films so this may be the best of her last 3 or 4 films. The plot is silly and light as a feather but painless and on the plus side is a very good score by Johnny  Green and Leo Robin, the  manic energy of Donald O'Connor and Deanna,  herself who is in very good form vocally.",924307200,4,333,4.015151515151516
