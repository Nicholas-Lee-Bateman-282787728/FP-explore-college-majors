8383793,5,B002XOTBAG,"A B-movie that, once ahead of its time, is given a second life during the atmosphere of the current political situation.  The corrupt mayor, played by Dick Boland, is the politician that is so truly represented in our world currently.  Seymour brings forth a tremendous performance from his cast while adding comical situations which are infeasible to regular human action and interaction.",1516579200,,389,5.258064516129032
8383794,1,B002XOTBAG,"Is this a student film? The production value is bad, the writing absolute trash. I actually feel sorry for the woman who plays the lead character, imagining how desperate she must have been for an acting gig that she took this role alongside a bunch of people who seem like they got hired off of Craigslist.",1508457600,,307,4.5
8383795,4,B002XOTBAG,"This movie is weird, although I should probably say Quirky. Unique, humourous and just plain fun. I enjoyed it a lot. Not a great film, but great for kicking back and relaxing.",1446940800,,176,4.53125

8383797,1,B002XOTBAG,"I don't see anything new in this film, honestly. It's a little less than what I expected, and it's very cliche. I don't understand why people think because a film is indie, it has lower standards...or that the indie viewer has lower standards. As usual, you can tell that this film is full of amusing one-liners and inside jokes that the cast and crew may be aware of, but as the viewer, don't waste my time. If you ""had to be there"" to understand it, then save it for your home movies! I personally am insulted. This was a hack film.",1287187200,,534,4.297029702970297
8383798,4,B002XOTBAG,"If you like indie comedies you will love ""London Betty.""  There are a lot
of great small budget films like ""London Betty"" being made that just don't make it to the
mainstream because of limited ad budgets compared to the major studios
beating their drums about how great their films are.

I don't want to be a spoiler so I will just say this film has a great story, wonderful performances,
and some  great shots in this film.  This is a great film to buy.",1277164800,,455,4.317647058823529
8383799,4,B002XOTBAG,"Betty has moved across the pond to become a real life American reporter, but when her first story assignment turns out to be just another fluff piece she begins to think twice about the move. Discouraged and looking for allies Betty forms an unlikely bond with the neighborhood thieves and together they set out to investigate the town's crooked Mayor. Betty might just get her first real news story, but she'll have to be in cahoots with thieves to get it.

This indie film is awesome!!! Thomas Edward Seymour directed the film, who has an ample amount of experience in the indie film business. This quirky comedy will definitely bring you a few laughs and completely entertain throughout the entire film. Check your local retailers like Walmart, Redbox, Blockbuster, Netflix, and Bestbuy. I am postive you will not be disappointed, enjoy!

8383800,4,B002XOTBAG,"I had been waiting to see London Betty for quite some time because of the director, Thomas Edward Seymour's previous work. While a fan of his supernatural/comic influenced ""Land of College Prophets"", I was much more impressed with his first film, ""Everything Moves Alone"". I thought the premise for ""London Betty"" sounded much more like his earlier work and I was anxious to see if he delivered another great independent comedy - even if his first film did have many dramatic themes, it still made me laugh on numerous occasions.

""London Betty"" did not disappoint. As a full length feature, it keeps your interest from start to finish. The witty dialogue and over the top antics kept me laughing throughout the film. While some of the acting is not what you would consider ""Oscar worthy"", it did contribute to some of the laughs that were experienced throughout the film. The title character, Betty, played by who I found out from the director commentary is Seymour's long time girlfriend, portrays an outstanding lead character & is genuinely likeable in this role. It may have something to do with the fancy British accent. While I was not aware of any of her previous work, apparently she is a theatre actress including some well know Broadway performances.

The fast paced shots & stellar screenplay make for an enjoyable film experience. I look forward to seeing more work by Thomas Edward Seymour down the road. I think his contributions to independent film making, including the films mentioned previously, have proven his ability to create entertaining features, and I hope it gives him further opportunity to prove himself in the world of cinema. Congratulations on a job well done.",1265587200,2,1692,4.954225352112676
