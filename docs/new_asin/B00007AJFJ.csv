1805630,4,B00007AJFJ,"I am a BIG Spongebob fan. If you are too, (and hase a DVD player) then get this DVD.* NOW. Here's why.
This VHS will have:
all episodes from the VHS titles ""Bikini Bottom Bash"" and ""Deep Sea Sillies""
Underwater Sun music video
Drawing to Goo Lagoon
Party Pooper Pants Storyboards
So is it werth it? Yes. But One thing I truly miss is the ""Backstage Pants"" they did on the first DVD. The one bad thing about the DVD is that ""Just One Bite"" is the edited version. Oh well. Other than that, it rules!
*If you don't have a DVD player, get Bikini Bottom Bash AND Deep Sea Sillies.",1044662400,,575,4.1891891891891895
1805631,5,B00007AJFJ,"This is a must have! It's SO funny! It's not just for kids, either: my mom and dad watch it whenever they have the chance. I wouldn't strongly recommend this to younger kids, however. There's more humor in the words than in what they see, so they probably wouldn't get it.
My favorite episodes are ""The Paper"" and ""Just One Bite"". In ""The Paper"", Spongebob finds a piece of paper that Squidward dropped, and askes Squidward if he wants it back. After Squidward says ""just take that stupid paper, it's yours forever and ever,"" many times, Spongebob begins to play with ""Mr. Paper"" for hours, creating shrieks of laughter that Squidward hears from his house. Squidward begins to get really annoyed and then he becomes desprate; HE wants to play with the paper.
In the end, Squidward trades everything he owns(even all his clothes) for that one scrap of paper, then finds out he can't have as much fun with it as Spongbob had. Oops!
And in ""Just One Bite"" Squidward says to Spongebob that he's never had a Kabby Patty. Spongebob keeps pestering him to try one, so, just to get rid of him, Squidward trys a tiny bit of it. He says he hates it, but really he loves it, so he goes out to the Patty Vault one night in the Krusty Crab and eats tons of Krabby Patties and ends up exploding. The end shows his head in an ambulance with a docter next to him saying, ""Yeah, I remember my first Krabby Patty,"".
This DVD is so funny and it's great for the whole family! You've got to get it!",1044316800,2,1477,4.374545454545455

1805633,4,B00007AJFJ,"I'll be short and sweet. This DVD is so funny and includes some really great episodes. The new episodes are so hilarious. They were a real treat to see before they are shown on TV in March. I just wish they had included more episodes and in order of the air date. I just hope they don't sneak some sorta SPONGE BOB SEASON ONE on us, that would truly make these DVD's a waste of money. Anyway, I can't wait for the next one (March 4th) keep em Coming Nickelodeon/Paramount and I'll keep buying!!",1043884800,,494,4.26595744680851
1805634,5,B00007AJFJ,"I started out watching Spongebob with my godson.. Eventually, I found myself watching the show on my own.. I love the characters and look forward to buying all the DVDs! Not sure what it is about that little sponge, but we're going to keep watching!!",1043539200,,250,4.5777777777777775
1805635,5,B00007AJFJ,"I want to start off by saying that I've been a fan of Spongebob since the beginning, and no I don't fit into the age bracket of 4-12 years old like Amazon suggests.  There is just something about this show that can keep anyone entertained.  Even one of my college professors is hooked on this show because of his children!  Well, with that in mind I will try to explain what episodes will be on this DVD release.  I don't know the official titles because they haven't been released but I will explain the episodes that I am aware of.
The episode where Spongebob discovers that Squidward has never eaten let alone tasted a krabby patty.  Spongebob hounds Squidward until he is addicted, and humor ensues from there.
In one episode, Spongebob and his faithful sidekick Patrick Star lure the retired superheros Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy out of the retirement home to fight ""eeeeeevviill"" characters off.  Dirty Bubble makes an appearance in this episode.
In another episode, Spongebob has endless imaginary fun with a gum wrapper until Squidward becomes so annoyed that he gives everything he owns to Spongebob so he can play with the gum wrapper. This leads Squidward to find that it won't work for him, just Spongebob.
In the next episode, Spongebob visits Sandy's air-filled home only to find that he can't breathe once inside.  Always remember ""pinky up"", which is the only advice Patrick has for Spongebob.
In another episode, Mr. Krabs insists on trying to sell a spoiled krabby patty.  He insists that it is ok, but no will touch it so Krabs tries it for himself.  This leads Mr Krabs to a near death experience, which is quite humorous.

In the next episode, Spongebob purchases a party planning kit.  Spongebob annoys his guests by planning every minute of the party.  Then he accidentally gets locked outside, but that's when the real party gets started inside.
In another episode, Spongebob is unwillingly appointed the task of hall monitor.  Well, he takes his duties too seriously after he leaves school by disturbing life in Bikini Bottom.  Needless to say, Mrs. Puff goes to jail again!
Next, Spongebob gets in a sand-sledding accident that requires extensive surgery.  He is so upset by this that he refuses to leave his house for fear of getting hurt again.  That is until a gorilla attacks Patrick and Sandy.  Will it be Spongebob to the resque?
In another episode, Spongebob plans a very big Valentine's Day suprise for Patrick.  Sandy is supposed to fly in the giant chocolate heart but chocolate-eating mollusks try to prevent Sandy from making the delivery.  Meanwhile, Patrick terrorizes the Valentine's Day carnaval trying to guess what his present is. Nothing like a crazed seastar to make things interesting. Will it be Sandy to the rescue, or Patrick the crazed seastar destroying Bikini Bottom?

Remember, I am not sure of the order of these episodes but these are the ones that will appear on the DVD...I can't wait. I hope everyone is looking forward to this release as much as I am! I also heard that there is another Spongebob DVD set for a March release.  If you are a fan or watching for the first time, get this DVD!  It has to be the funniest cartoon that is out now and I know you won't be disappointed.",1040169600,39,3240,4.727758007117438

1805664,4,B00007AJFJ,"""Contains all episodes from the VHS titles 'Bikini Bottom Bash' and 'Deep Sea Sillies'

Deep Sea Sillies was funny, but Bikini Bottom Bash wasn't so great. Why I gave this DVD 4-Stars instead of 5, is because of the order in which the episodes play. It doesn't make sense that Sandy is invited to Spongebob's party, when he hasn't meet her yet. What I mean is, Deep Sea Sillies (specifically ""Tea at the Treedome"") should have been first, then Bikini Bottom Bash.

Frankly, I find Patchy the Pirate, more annoying that bad episodes of Ren & Stimpy. But otherwise this DVD is a must buy.

1805666,5,B00007AJFJ,"A little riddle for the riddle lovers.
What's the similarity between SpongeBob SquarePants Tales of the Deep and Krabby Patties when it comes to Squidward?
Give up?
Gotta have more! Gotta have more! Gotta have more! Gotta have more! Gotta have more! Gotta have more! Gotta have more! Gotta have more! Gotta have more etc etc.
Anyways.
(Note: Since I don't want people to get put off by any aspect of SpongeBob anymore, and since it's my birthday, I am now only putting down the best 2 episodes for you to watch, and the worst for you to avoid.)

BEST EPISODE: Born Again Krabs.
The Krusty Krab hasn't been popular for the past few weeks. And no, it's not the new place mats. It's the old patty that SpongeBob found under the grill and tried to trash. And you know how Mr Krabs is with trying to throw patties out, no matter how old they are. But he can't find a buyer for this! Not even when he samples the patty... and gets put away for food poisoning and clashes with the Flying Dutchman, who comes to take him to Davy Jones' Locker for being cheap. They strike a bargain; he returns to life a generous krab or else. He lives up to the deal as long as possible (he even initiates naps at work and [gasp shock horror] free refills!), but the last straw comes when he reaches total bankruptcy. Now comes the ultimate bargain. SpongeBob, his best fry cook? Or all the money the Dutchman has in his pocket? (No prizes for guessing which.) A totally funny closing episode, including one of Squidward's finest moments! (Though a little pushing might be in order.) - 11 outta 10.

SECOND BEST EPISODE: Just One Bite.
Krabby Patties; the most delicious thing in Bikini Bottom. But they're the reason Squidward hates his job. Radioactive sludgeballs, he reckons. So when SpongeBob finds out, he eventually has to stoop so low to take just one bite. And to be frank, words like horrible, putrid, poultry prepared, vile, unappetizing and disgusting don't begin to describe it. But yet, the fresh meaty tangy taste is refreshingly addictive. And it tastes better on a Kelp Bun with extra sea pickle... Soon Squid's caught up in a patty-lurving frenzy. How to cure this craving? How about a trip to the patty vault after hours? Honestly a fantastic ep, and the ending is hilarious. But those who act along to Squid, beware! Now where did I put my King-Size Ultra Krabby Supreme Double Batter Fried on a Stick? - 10 outta 10.

WORST EPISODE: Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy. The first of 5.
SpongeBob and Patrick have been fans from day 1. They even have their own adventures, thus they learn of the location of the real things in a harsh duel with Reflecto (Squidward). Apparently they're working undercover in a retirement home. By working undercover I mean retired. But according to SpongeBob, old people are great, full of wisdom and experience. And he'll get married, cross-dress and paint an invisible boat mobile to get the duo out of retirement. It's too bad he doesn't take no for an answer. Quite good for a superhero epic. - 8 outta 10.",1127001600,2,3032,4.590405904059041
1805667,5,B00007AJFJ,"of the past half decade. Did you know that my uncle Tom Kenney(1947-) did the voice of Spongebob?Well,he DID.Best cartoon since 1999. The artwork was good but some of the artwook  sucked.
this didn't really have a plot though. This is just  a mega collection of the episodes from Deep Sea sillies and Bikini Bottom Bash which are only available on the videotape edition. This is only available onthe DVD format. You can tell that the ones with the bad artwork are old just  by lookin g at them. How about I say that the ones with the good artwork are color and the bad art black and white(eventhough all of them are color).The following episodes are:
  .""Party Pooper Pants""(Double length episode)- color. This is probably the first episode to have good art.
  .""Hall Monitor"" -black & white
  .""I had an Accident""-color
  .""Valentine's Day"" -black & white
  .""Just One Bite""-color
  .""Mermaidman and Barnacleoy""-black & white
  .""tea at The Treedome""-black & white
  .""The Paper""-black & white

Tea at the Treedome 3/5  This one's on TV too much, and it's not the greatest.
The Paper 5/5  ""Look at me, I'm a guy with a mustache!""  Funny.  Spongebob entertaines himself with a piece of paper.
Born Again Krabs 5/5  Funny.  Mr. Krabs tries to eat a spoiled Krabby Patty to prove it's still good.

Later Mrs. Puff accidentally admits that Spongebob is her responsibility.
3. I Had An Accident. Spongebob breaks his butt on Sand Mountain, has a 20-hour surgery to repair his butt, and makes a vow to never go outside again. Sandy and Patrick try to get Spongebob to come outside and get beat up by a gorilla.
4. Valentinte's Day. Spongebob and Sandy get Patrick a big Valentine with a chocolate balloon and it gets stopped by chocolate-eating scallops.
5. Just One Bite. Spongebob tries to teach Squidward to like Krabby Patties. Squidward hides the truth and then admits it. Squidward goes in the Patty Vault and eats so many that they went to his thighs and made him explode.
6. Mermaidman and Barnacleboy. Spongebob and Patrick try to get Marmaidman and Barnacleboy out of retirement.
7. Tea at the Treedome. Spongebob meets Sandy for the first time and he dehydrates in her treedome.
8. The Paper. Spongebob haves fun with a gum wrapper that Squidward throws out and Squidward tries to prove that a gum wrapper is no fun.
9. Born Again Krabs. Mr. Krabs refuses to throw out a moldy Krabby Patty and tries to sell it. No one wants it. So he takes a bit and gets food poisoning. So the Flying Dutchman tries to put him in Davey Jones's locker for being cheap. But Mr. Krabs begs for a 2nd chance to prove he isn't cheap.
