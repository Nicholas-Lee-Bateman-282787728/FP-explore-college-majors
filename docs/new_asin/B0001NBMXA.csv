8015166,5,B0001NBMXA,"My son watched these over and over when he was 1.5 to 2 years old. He first started watching Miffy on Noggin when he was 1.5 years old. I'm very picky about what is appropriate for my son to watch. Just because something is rated G doesn't make it appropriate. Kids are so impressionable at this age and believe everything they are told and that they see/hear. Miffy is innocent and teaches about love, friendship and every day things.

Disclaimer: I'm not advocating TV watching here - Pediatricians ask that you limit the amount of TV your toddler watches. We limit our son (now 3.5 years old) to one 1/2 hour show per day and one movie on Friday or Saturday.",1170201600,3,661,4.462809917355372
