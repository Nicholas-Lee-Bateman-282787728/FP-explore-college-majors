3515990,1,B001CQONOA,What is the point of buying season sets when the video companies are constantly giving buyers of the complete series more material. From now on I am going to hold off buying individual season sets.,1222214400,15,197,4.6571428571428575
3515991,1,B001CQONOA,"I bought each season as it came out on the day it was released.  My reward for that?  Getting the shaft by not being able to purchase the reunion movies separately.  You always hear from the studios - ""if sales are good on these releases then we'll come out with the next season, etc.""  Well -loyal fans showed there was a demand and now we're expected to re-buy everything with the carrot of the two reunion movies.  Sorry but I'm not getting ripped off that way.  Listen up studios - don't bite the hand that feeds you or we'll simply stop buying your product.",1222128000,23,562,4.355769230769231
3515992,3,B001CQONOA,"Note:  This review was also posted in the Box Set thread for West!

I will buy this box set IF it is in Blu-ray format, or more extras are made available beyond the two TV movies. I'd like to see more interviews of surviving actors, directors, writers or even pundits with their inside take. Or perhaps an interview with the lady who wrote the Wild Wild West compilation some years ago. Would love to know how the show carried on past Conrad's late Season 3 injury, or Ross Martin's Season 4 heart attack. Since I already own all four seasons, the point made by another West fan of bypassing this box set unless the two movies are made available separately is well taken. As of mid-Sept., I can't get confirmation on whether worthy, new extras are forthcoming, or the Blu-ray format might be used ... this makes a difference!!",1221523200,3,826,4.5369127516778525
3515993,4,B001CQONOA,"I loved this show as a kid, it reran right after school and was always a great way to relax. The show is a kind of James Bond in the Wild West. Lots of gadgets and lost of hot women. Each episode was well rounded but any episode with Lovless in it was a must watch. Some of the best parts of the show were the moments with West and Gordon you could tell that the actors really like each other and it made those sceens all the better. In this box set you get not only all the eps of the show but the 2 movies they did. Don't worry the Will Smith verison is not in it. A great but because its hard to find season 2 in stores anymore. Any fan of Conrads or of Baa Baa Black Sheep&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Baa-Baa-Black-Sheep-Volume-1/dp/B0007YMWGY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Baa Baa Black Sheep - Volume 1</a>&nbsp;will love this show.",1219622400,16,882,4.733766233766234
3515994,1,B001CQONOA,"The Wild Wild West DVDs are GREAT! I'm sure this Complete Series DVD set is too. BUT...when a person has already purchased all four seasons DVD sets and now is told that the two reunion movies are to be included in the complete series set and NOT available on their own...well, I'm a bit perturbed. Please make us happy and release the movies. Separately if you must make more money from us fans but at least release them.",1219190400,29,422,4.423076923076923
3515995,1,B001CQONOA,"I totally agree with Howie in the above review. On its own the complete series set would rate 5 stars but as a present owner of all four season sets, I find it unfair that I am expected to repurchase the whole set again just to get the two additional reunion movies. It would be great if Paramount would make these movies available to present season set owners with proof of purchase from the current set cases or at the very least allow us to purchase them, preferably at a budget price. You know most loyal Wild Wild West fans like myself have already purchased most if not all four seasons already and would have jumped at the chance to purchase the complete set had it been available from the begining.
To anyone who has not yet purchased the individual season sets, The complete series is a fantastic set and with the two reunion movies,cool looking case and a great price from Amazon, its a deal that cant be beat.",1218758400,31,920,4.41764705882353
3515996,3,B001CQONOA,"Don't get me wrong.  This is a 5 star series and the quality of the seasons is excellent, also deserving 5 stars, but once again a major studio releases a box set with extras reported to not be available separately.  That's why this gets 3 instead of 5 stars.

What you'll get is all four remastered seasons, with the same features, bonuses, etc. as in the individual sets, plus the reunion films, ""Wild Wild West Revisited"" from 1979, and ""More Wild Wild West"" from 1980.

The primary downside is there are no plans to release the 2 reunion films separately so you'll have to spring for this set to get them.

Another downside is the packaging.  Yet another gimick box set designed to scratch disks when inserted into tight cardboard disk holders.

Unless you get this for a greatly reduced price and or just *have* to get the rather lackluster later movies, the individual sets are better packaged and an overall better value because of the better packaging.",1218585600,18,960,4.678571428571429

3516035,4,B001CQONOA,"Great spy thriller series with a western flavor and dry sense of humor! The 1st season is in black & white; the final 3 in vivid color. Robert Conrad is frequently shirtless displaying the first regularly  televised abs.  Ross Martin is his sidekick donning disguise after disguise as they solve mysteries and fight crime throughout the west circa the late 1800s.

Guest stars include Victor Buono, Boris Karloff, Susan Oliver, Jo Van Fleet, William Schallert, and many others.

The series was canceled in March 1969 due to its violent content. It continued to air in repeats for another four years. Production ceased late 1968.

Each disc has 4 episodes. Only the 1st season has special features. It features audio interviews and intros by Robert Conrad on each episode. A late 70s talk show clip includes parts of an interview with the two leads and Conrad's stunt double. Also a photo gallery.

It would have been nice to feature current video interviews and the 2 reunion TV films.",1507852800,3,985,4.868263473053892

My only complaint (not with the series or transfers but with shipping) and a rather big one is the way I continually receive multi-discs DVD's and Blu-rays from Amazon.  The plastic cases are continually broke, especially the corners with discs rattling around inside.  If I sent back all the T.V. series because of broken cases I'd never own any, so I continually buy replacement cases.

3516067,5,B001CQONOA,"Just received a copy today, 10 Aug 2017.  Several earlier reviewers complained about crude packaging where many disks were shoved together in a pouch with no protection between them.  Apparently someone at CBS Video is listening.

3516076,4,B001CQONOA,"On the description on Amazon this series of disks are described as being in color. But I have watched the first disk and all four episodes are in black and white. My suspicion is they will remain black and white until the last few seasons when CBS presented the WIld, WIld West in color. I had bought this series on VHS years ago and that is what I found.  The quality of the disks is very good, even in black and white. My problem is with the description on Amazon is not completely honest. I would think this being the 40th Anniversary collector's edition the black and white episodes would have been colorized. But that is found not to be the case. Also remember full screen means 3:4 format. So do not expect to see the episodes on a wide screen TV in wide screen format. It is formatted according to how the format was when it was originally televised on analog televisions. However, unlike the earlier packaging of earlier editions of this series the disks are very well protected. Special care was taken in designing the  case. it is very easy to find any one  particular episode you may want to watch. See my accompanying photos.",1497052800,10,1137,4.483091787439614

3516082,5,B001CQONOA,"I am loving re-watching this show.  My first disc had a fair number of skips in it, but only one other episode in season 1 had any problem, and it was minor.  I did not ask for a replacement, though I suppose I should.  The quality of the picture and sound is fantastic so far (I have finished season 1 and am into the second disc of season 2) for the rest of the episodes in this set.  I had forgotten how truly gorgeous Robert Conrad was.  A beautiful body (not over-muscled, just very, very fit), handsome, charming, perfect.  Ross Martin was great, too, and their obvious enjoyment in their work is wonderful.  Familiar guest stars were fun to watch, though some of the females cast were not the greatest actors.  There was success with others, though.  Some very clever, smart episodes mixed in with the silly but always performed with professionalism and enthusiasm by the two leads.  I decided to buy this series after watching the miniseries Centennial and just marveling at how fantastic Robert Conrad was.  That is a series worth your time as well.",1493769600,3,1058,4.60427807486631

3516115,5,B001CQONOA,"THE WILD, WILD WEST: This popular late sixties series combined the western genre with a James Bond twist, trotting out a never ending supply of elaborate gadgetry, sinister villains and femme fatales. Fresh off a stint in the surf detective hit Hawaiian Eye, Robert Conrad portrayed suave secret agent James West, a ladies man quick with his fists (the compact actor performed his own stunts) as well as his wits. Aided by fellow agent Artemis Gordon (Ross Martin), who was armed with scientific know-how and an arsenal of quips, clever disguises and dialects, the pair traveled in an elaborately equipped private train car, squaring off against larger than life foes like meglomaniacal midget Dr. Loveless (the perfectly cast Michael Dunn). For four fantastic, futuristic seasons, The Wild, Wild West served up witty plots, cool guest stars (Victor Buono, Agnes Moorehead), freeze-frame cliffhangers and slam-bang action sequences...in short, some of the best over the top entertainment to ever crash the small screen.

RATING: FIVE FIST FIGHTS",1479168000,2,1045,5.333333333333333

Actors Robert Conrad and Ross Martin are superb in this and compliment each other so well.  This is a great DVD series to have in my collections of movies and programs that I enjoy watching when tv programming at that time was produced well unlike a lot of todays shows.

3516129,5,B001CQONOA,"Pros: Great looking box set, very stylish and looks like its worth $70.  All discs work fine.

Cons: The DVD's are stored poorly, and do have slight scratches/marks on some. but DVD's are quite durable nowadays, and most DVD players are much better at reading slightly damaged discs than they used to be,(its not like old CD players.)  I have yet to find an issue even on the worst looking disc.

3516133,1,B001CQONOA,"The Wild Wild West is one of my favorite shows from that era and a worthy entry in Steampunk fiction.  The video transfers in this disk series are, for the most part, excellent with only a very few mastering issues noted.

However, the packaging is awful.  I started with Season 2 Disk 1 and noted a few light ""skips"" that, on rewind and replay, didn't reappear.  Then I got to Disk 5 of Season 2.  The Night of the Feathered Fury pixelated and froze partway through playback and when I ejected the disk to examine it, I found a large area of surface defects and scratches (see attached image).  At that point, I examined the rest of the disks and found almost all had surface defects.  Obviously, the defects don't always affect playback but when almost every disk has defects and one of the first five watched won't play through, it does not bode well for the rest of the disks.

I have requested an exchange but I'm concerned the next set won't be in any better shape than the first.  At that point, I'll have to decide if ordering individual seasons that come in more traditional packaging won't be preferable.  Note how the top approximately 2/3 of each disk can rub against the label of the next disk.  That is the case with all except the last disk of each season, which has cardboard behind it instead of another disk.  Not coincidentally, the last disk of each season appears to be undamaged.",1475280000,23,1401,4.4940711462450595

My husband surprised me with this complete series boxed set - and I was ecstatic! (I had not been aware this even existed on DVD!) Rewatching the series now as an adult, I can see why it stuck with me through the years... Artemus had the brains and gadgets to get Jim through his missions and out of his scrapes! (What would he have done without Artemus?) :) Too, Dr Miguelito Loveless is such an over the top arch-nemesis!

The packaging is nice though the DVDs aren't too secure in their holders. It looks good on the shelf!  It's the same size as my Gone With the Wind and Wizard of Oz commemorative boxed sets yet smaller than my Smallville and 24 boxed sets. I am watching this once again and enjoying it immensely!

3516276,4,B001CQONOA,"I have to agree....points off for the packaging. I think if one GENTLY removes and replaces the discs into their respective slots you should be OK, but they could get slid into the same slot potentially rubbing each other. I have no idea who thought up this bonehead ""saddlebag"" box, but little testing probably went into it. Depending on shelf space, I may just use 27 slim case jewel boxes and store them separately, or a compact multi-disc zippered case in which each disc has its own slot.

Now that out of the way....the show is just plain excellent fun. I loved it as a kid, and it holds up very well. James Bond of the old west, yes, of course, but Bob Conrad brings so much to the role (hee hee hee, I spoke to him some years ago, and he introduced himself to me as ""Bob,"" so I think it's OK to call him that). And Ross was amazing; I did not know he actually sketched many of his costume ideas and gave them to the wardrobe department, nor that the cast had no idea of his disguises until the ep began filming. He was a remarkable man, and a true asset to a great series.

3516284,4,B001CQONOA,"I first heard about this show in the early 1980s, but it was only in the last month or so that I actually had a chance to see it when Horror Channel in the UK began Season 1. As it began on a Friday afternoon, I missed the first episode, but watching the rest I absolutely loved it, so much that I decided to take the plunge. I bought the 2008 box set with the extra disc containing the TV movies.

I haven't started to watch the colour episodes yet, so I'm hoping that the discs will be okay, which explains why I've knocked a star off the rating. I did read other reviews before committing to purchasing this set, and decided it was worth the risk. I agree though, about the packaging problem. The outer box is a thing of beauty, but the ""saddle bags"" inside leave a lot to be desired. It's hard getting the discs in and out without worrying about scuffing them and as I live in the UK I'd hate to have to send the set back.

Other reviewers have suggested getting paper sleeves and cutting them down to fit the discs, and I can get them from my local Poundland shop.",1440028800,2,1069,4.159420289855072

3516307,5,B001CQONOA,"I still remember watching the reruns when I was young.  The gadgets depicted in this show were innovative and ahead of its time.  The main character Jim West was a secret service agent who rode around in a railroad train throughout the west, fighting villians at every railway stop.  His master-of-disguise partner also designed gadgets to help out the hero.  Best of all, unlike modern tv shows, every episode was made for the audience's entertainment - without any sort of social / environmental / leftist propaganda.  It was also made in a more morally pure time - when heroes were good and villians were evil.  Jim West and Artemus Gordon (""good guys"") battled evil masterminds (the ""bad guys"") pure and simple.  Oh, and the ladies acted like ladies.  (I'm not absolutely certain, but to the best of my recollection, most if not all the ladies were proper and wore ankle-length dresses.)",1435449600,2,891,4.854304635761589

I watched them once.",1433980800,,564,5.086956521739131
3516314,5,B001CQONOA,"Back in the sixties when I was a kid (somehow I knew Id have to use that phrase one day) we watched television when it aired and only when it aired. We didn't have video recorders, DVRs or even DVDs to watch. You watched when a show was on and if you missed it hoped you could catch it during reruns. On Friday nights as the street lights began to glow you knew it was time to rush home before the opening credits to one of the most popular shows on at that time: THE WILD, WILD WEST.

Fortunately things have changed when it comes to favorite shows. Between recordings and streaming channels you pretty much have the chance to watch what you want, when you want. Along with those options many studios have made it possible for classic series from the past to be offered in DVD format at a reasonable price. Such is the case with WEST.

If youve never seen the series (forget the Will Smith movie which was okay but doesnt compare) its a combination of the two biggest genres at that time, westerns and spies. The show covered the adventures of James West (Robert Conrad) and Artemus Gordon (Ross Martin), two undercover agents working for President Ulysses S. Grant. Each week the duo rode their specially rigged train across the Wild West in search of threats to the government or to various towns. While it might sound boring the series was anything but.

On the western end of the spectrum there was plenty of horse riding and numerous brawls that took place in any location from the barroom to the well-manicured mansion of that weeks megalomaniac. On the spy end this team had tons of gadgets that would do James Bond proud as well as Artemus ability to change his appearance with makeup and acting ability, never enough so that the young viewers couldn't recognize him. The blending of these two genres made the show interesting and fun. It also had enough action to keep the most jaded viewer watching each week while employing a ton of stunt men.

Along their trips the pair also ended up with a nefarious arch nemesis in the form of Dr. Miguelito Loveless, a dwarf of a man with the mind of a genius well played by Michael Dunn. The evil doctor appeared in over 10 episodes of the series. Perhaps that didn't make him a regular since the show ran for 4 years but it would be close enough to make him the main bad guy from start to finish. His henchmen were always the biggest bad guys around and a challenge for James West.

The good looking Conrad was a mans man in that old fashioned television, someone who could handle himself in a fight, draw faster than the local gunslinger and able to woo the most jaded female villainess. On top of that Conrad insisted on doing most of his own stunts which led to difficulties at times. In so doing he gained the respect and friendship of the various stunt men who worked the show and would follow him into other series he starred in later.

Ross Martin offered a different look, a more mature look to be sure and not quite as handsome but always able to find dates to accompany West. His various disguises helped make him a great sidekick to his partner allowing him to save the day on occasion. The character of Artemus also had the knack for creating various weapons they could use down the road like an exploding cue ball for the billiard table found on their train. I told you the train was impressive.

Fans of the series were sad to see it go off the air. Even so it has remained a talked about and well-loved series that fans cant forget to this day. Ask someone who grew up during that time to hum the theme song and chances are they know it. Ask them about the animated opening segment and theyll describe it. And for those fans the new release of the complete series is a joy to add to their collection.

The complete series has been offered before in a collectible box set but the new release features the series in a more shelf friendly version. The only thing missing are the two made for TV movies that followed when the series was gone which were included in the special set. But if what you're looking for is the original series this is the way to go. Twenty six discs (!) bring you each and every episode of the series from start to finish, all four years.

Im guessing that with one look at a picture from the show or if you happen to see this set sitting on the shelf at the store youll find yourself remembering that famous opening. Youll remember that the boxes in that animated sequence changed with each commercial break. And youll suddenly find yourself remembering that theme song, perhaps going so far as to sing it. Admit it, you're humming it now.",1433894400,5,4629,4.417350527549824

Unless there's some kind of legal reason that barred their inclusion, it's a bizarre decision by Paramount, considering their recent re-releases of MacGyver and Walker, Texas Ranger complete series do include the later TV movie(s) for those  shows.  Either way, I'll have to hold my breath and wait for a separate release (highly unlikely), or actually buy the 2008 release and stick the disc into my new set, rendering the 2008 release unsellable.

While one can buy empty multidisc Amaray cases online, it often feels insulting to do so when the manufacturer should have taken care of this in the first place.

I read how disappointed people were in the packaging.
I found a really fair price and ordered it as I loved the ones I saw on You Tube and I am 77.  If not now, just when was I gonna view these!
I love these.  Robert Conrad's interviews before each are nice.
Having NO COMMERCIALS!!!!! is really, really nice.
No wonder they were taken off the air if they started out in children's time slot, and then later, after they tossed out a lot of the talent who created the series, some things got prolonged, like a love-interest.
In any case, to learn that the train was real and got bought by a Texan who got it for his small (I think) children....I keep wondering how it is nowadays maintained.  Maybe he gave it to a museum.  You cannot not let something with that much steel and cast iron just sit.  It must be continually lubricated and operated and the cost in trees for fuel!!!
Anyhow,  learning all about Robert Conrad was really nice.  He was really truthful that he was a stuntman.  I have never seen a more gorjus male anywhere.  And that he was 5' 8"" and 1/4"" !  They did his test by putting him on the near side of the pool table and other actors on the other side.
If you look up Phoebe Dorin you will get her interview with Tom Weaver, you will find a heart-rending true story.
Worth your trouble.
I just love this series as I did when it was on TV.  Yes, it was violent but in a way that you knew was all contrived.
It is superior to the junk children are subjected to these days and that a lot of time shows absurd self-centeredness or crudeness that is totally unnecessary and vulgar.
You can also buy the entire series of the Prisoner....a clever and likewise absurd mystery week after week and even at the end, you puzzle how it ended and who the little man was.  Was he ""Number One""?

3516437,4,B001CQONOA,"When I read reviews where people complain about the packaging, I usually ignore them because I archive all of my disks to a server and don't care what the cases look like afterwards..  DO NOT IGNORE THIS.
This review is not about the show (which gets 5 stars from me).  The packaging is clever and unique, much like the TV show.  But, they are either recycling old disks to write the data onto, or their packaging is causing problems.  Of the 27 disks in this set, only a few of them looked in great condition (on the data side).  Of the 27 disks, several of them took a lot of work on my part to make useable (many cleanings and multiple times through different drives).  Of the 27 disks, most of them were unbelievably marred over much of the surface, and most of them all had the same section of the disk in the middle of the data area that looked like it was going to be unreadable - but luckily the software ran over this slow enough to finally get the data.  I have a feeling that when I watch the episodes from these disks that I'm going to notice the problem.
I'm sure that when they designed this packaging and had it sitting there on their table, with the perfect little disks in the 2 containers (that I think are to resemble old machine gun magazines or something), that everyone loved it.  But, when these disks are bounced all around the country from warehouse to warehouse to delivery stations to delivery stations and all the handling in between, these disks slide around way too much.  They should have secured them tightly to each other for shipping.",1420070400,6,1568,4.416666666666667

3516441,4,B001CQONOA,"It's a crying shame that that odd film with Will Smith was made which purported to be the movie culmination of this marvelous TV series.
The TV series was the 'state of the art' at the time, with fast paced action, a marvelous music score, and 'hip' repartee in a 'cool' pair of secret agents from the 1860-70's.  They are portraying the initial Secret Service agents, though much of their work parallels the dominant agency of the time, which was actually private: Pinkerton.
Robert Conrad and Ross Martin were the stars, getting themselves into, and out of, some James Bond 007-type of predicaments.  There were a series of guest villains(a la Batman) but the ultimate was Dr. Loveless.  He was a man of tiny stature who had a giant bodyguard(in the early episodes) who was always surrounded by women.  He had a vendetta against James West(Robert Conrad) as well as the government, who seemed to want to thwart his constant attempts to take over the nation...and the world.  His plans were normally as absurd as the James Bond 'villains' but did make for some interesting 'science fiction' in the midst of a western.
The show's only flaw is that it was 'hip' and 'cool' for its time.  99.99% of the time, when something was hip for its period, it doesn't age well and seems out of date.  The series still holds up, somewhat, but it just misses the excitement it used to generate.",1419897600,,1381,4.658436213991769

3516493,3,B001CQONOA,"I Purchased this box set in Oct 2014. In Dec. 2014 I discovered a problem, season four disc 2 The first episode on the disc is "" The Night of The Gruesome Games"" It is also episodes 3 and 4 on the disc. According to the episode guide episode 3 should be ""The Night Of The Fugitives"" and episode 4 should be ""The Night Of The Egyptian Queen"" However those two episodes are missing and Gruesome Games plays instead. So Gruesome Games plays three times on disc 2 of season 4. Buyer beware, I don't know if this is a common problem or not, also not sure of Amazon policy for this type of error. I was just going to purchase season four to avoid the process of being made whole, but it is not listed as a single purchase. I found 1-3 but not season four. Anyway, buyers check the integrity of your box sets as quickly as you can.",1418947200,,824,4.124223602484472

As you see I loved the series in my youth and I took that love into my later life. I am still active and watch little on the box.  I assure you I will be watching, oh yes I will.

It is a cross Batman (Adam West/ Burt Ward series), and Maverick. You expect to get the old  cowboy ride-the-range shoot from-the-hip scenario rammed down your gullet, then  some outrageous event occurs which challenges, stimulates and amuses the modern discriminating person,

This is a western with a twist.  so as soon as that magical sound of a loaded Colt 45 Peacemaker starts lulling you into the usual voyeuristic fantasy; It starts to  twist and turn more times that the conversation of a Bogong, travelling to Campbelltown (N.S.W. Australia), explaining why he hasn't got a ticket, to an impromptu  ticket snapper.

3516607,3,B001CQONOA,"MY COMMENT RELATES TO THE PRODUCT  NOT THE SELLER !!

The cheap packaging of the DVDs, as supplied by Paramount/CBS, brings to mind the ""2 for a Dollar"" bootlegged and Public Domain material I used to buy in the Dollar Store. Not even paper sleeves for the discs. They are put into two flimsy cardboard pouches which resemble the cone-like holders you get for french fries in at a fast food store  creating many opportunities for scratches and damaging accidents. Shame on the producers of this packaging for not including an interesting booklet describing the 4 seasons of episodes and backgrounds of the performers. I'm sure that this shabby presentation of The Wild,Wild West puts a blemish on the enjoyment of the series DVDs by its many loyal fans.",1413244800,5,753,4.821705426356589

3516610,4,B001CQONOA,"I am still watching Season 1. The quality of the picture and sound is sharp and clear, I love the way it is packaged. I watched this series when I was a kid. I would have rated it 5 stars if it were not for how the discs are stored next to each other. I have to be very careful when I remove a disc to prevent scratching. CBS Entertainment could have put each disc in a paper disc holder to prevent possible scratching. Paper disc holders are inexpensive and they are thin enough to not hamper storing the discs in the box. I am going to buy enough for all the discs for my peace of mind. CBS Entertainment was either being cheap or the manufacturer of the box set was cutting corners and overlooked the consequences of storing discs side-by-side. Be that as may, I highly recommend it to those that enjoyed watching the series when it originally aired and to those that were too young to see it but love watching Western shows.",1412553600,4,928,4.278409090909091

3516651,5,B001CQONOA,"While I have to agree with everyone else on the packaging (it's kind of like how they package hard taco shells) but the shows are delightful.  Hey, some of the six disks in one pack is just as bad when those inner ones fall off the hinges.  The best packing is individual plastic cases with four to eight in a cardboard outer box and this ain't that.  This is cardboard with slits and disks sitting in those slits inside a big box.  But the contents (videos) are precious.  Robert Conrad introduces each episode.  They also include the original artwork and titles from the unaired pilot entitled ""THE WILD WEST"" instead of the ""THE WILD, WILD WEST.""  So you get an idea of how producers and networks changed the show before it aired.  Conrad details this and it's quite compelling.  The first season is black and white and the rest are in color.  The picture quality is quite good.  The guest stars and great.  And it includes all the movies except the turkey from the turn of the century (which sounds like a Z grade Sci Fi movies and IS WORSE THAN THAT, and I usually like Kevin Kline and he was Horrible in that butcher of a remake hatchet job).",1406937600,,1148,4.414285714285715

3516671,5,B001CQONOA,"What do you get when you cross the western genre with the Spy genre? You get a successful Emmy nominated 60's TV classic, 4 seasons, 104 episodes plus two 1979/1980 TV reunion movies! So successful, In fact, that the series wasn't canceled due to ratings but because CBS had issues with all the violence. The series follows the Wild West exploits of two secret service men: Ex-Cavalry Captain man-of-action James T. West and inventor master-of-disguise Artemis Gordon. Not only do they have lots of 19th century super-spy gadgets (like switch-blade cowboy boots and the ultimate pair of skinny jeans), they have a groovy private secret service railcar, and even a recurring super-villain in megalomaniacal dwarf Dr Loveless! Robert Conrad & Ross Martin are terrifically paired as agents Jim and Artie. That great regular cast chemistry aside special guest star Michael Dunn is terrific as evil, sometimes sympathetic Dr Loveless (although he sadly only appears in ten episodes and passed away before reunion movies). Many other recognizable tv character actors appear throughout the series run like Richard Kiel, Robert Loggia, Burgess Meredith, Jackie Coogan, Martin Landau, Sammy Davis Jr., Richardo Moltaban, Batgirl Yvonne Craig, Richard Pryor, Ed Adner, Skipper Alan Hale Jr., (not to mention Islanders: Jim Bachus & Mary Wells), Ted Knight,  John ""Gomez"" Astin, Don Rickles, Robert Duvall,  Suzanne Pleshette, Victor Buone, Maltese Falcon's Elisha Cook Jr., Dark Shadow's Thayer David, the great Leslie Nielsen and Boris Karloff himself.

3516692,5,B001CQONOA,"I loved this show when it was aired back in the mid and late 60's. Robert Conrad and Ross Martin did such great jobs as James West and Artemus Gordon. The show was a great synthesis of Western and action and James Bond. There were a lot of great guest starts playing the villians, too. If you saw the movie ""The Wild Wild West"" with Wil Smith but have never seen this show, then you've never seen ""The Wild Wild West.""

3516694,5,B001CQONOA,"Always loved this show.  Tried to watch all of them in my youth, but I know I missed many.  Back then there were reruns, but most times in the summer months when I stayed outside.  I know they have been on cable on occasion and perhaps still are, but I rarely watch cable anymore.  This allows me the opportunity to view when I can.  The price drop at the time was a great bargain to me so I scarfed it up before it rose again like gas prices.  The DVD's were not individually packaged and that was bothersome.  Just have to be extra careful and keep away from kids handling or retrieving them.  Just particular is all...nothing against kids...I was one myself.",1404172800,,661,4.360655737704918

3516708,3,B001CQONOA,"What more can one say?  Great series, lousy packaging.

Two mistakes in the editorial reviews should be noted.  First, while Morton Stevens composed some individual episode scores, the Wild Wild West theme song was composed by Richard Markowitz.  Although uncredited for the theme in the series, he is given credit in the two TV movies.  Second, Pat Paulsen did not portray a temporary replacement of Ross Martin's character. He appeared in one of Charles Aidman's episodes.  The Pat Paulsen character would have appeared even if Ross Martin had be able to participate in the episode.

Also Harvey Korman's name is misspelled along with the episode title ""The Night of the Janus.""",1403827200,,680,5.072072072072072

3516743,5,B001CQONOA,"This complete series is a wonderful addition to any DVD library, especially if you enjoyed watching the original programming on TV. This series includes commentaries to broaden your understanding of each episode if you so desire. For example, there was a necessary formula for each episode, which included an attractive woman and some mysterious archenemy. It's a futuristic Western, and I found it never to be dull or predicable, other than the fact that James West always wins.
Robert Conrad, who plays James West, is too handsome for his own good, but he plays well on screen.
James is accompanied and assisted by his handy and knowledgeable sidekick, Artemis Gordon, who is sufficiently less handsome than his companion not to be a threat to the ladies that grace the screen, but sufficiently adept to save James when he's in over his head in impossible situations.
The title ""Wild Wild West"" is a play on words, given the hero is James West (a government agent sent around the country tackling impossible situations with the backing of the President. Having unlimited funding from Uncle Sam allows him access to toys that would limit other sleuths of the Old West. His 'home base' is an opulently furnished railway car he rides all over the country. He is definitely not a saddle-sore cowboy.
I have not finished viewing all the episodes, but as a TV mystery series, it is still interesting. Each episode is entitled ""The Night of...""
You must bear in mind that the series is from the 1960's, and so the plots may not be as twisted and complex as some you view today; but if you sat in front of a TV back in 1965 and watched it every week, you will not worry about that.  And when you're done, rest assured that there will always be someone else who will be happy to take the Wild Wild West series off your hands.",1403136000,,1818,4.645962732919255

3516748,5,B001CQONOA,"The Wild Wild West had interesting villians , great guest stars and fairly good acting. Jim west played great part as western secret service agent superman with sence of humor. My farorite villian was evil genius midget, Dr. Lovelace with his giant assistant. James West always had some gadget or tool he needed, on his person, to save himself from a bad situation. Ok, the plots were a little far fetched, but I enjoyed most of them. James character was able to fight off several bad guys all at once & not even mess up his hair. He always got the girl to fall in love with him. He defeated the bad guys, but remained gentlemen afterward, not needing to brag. Good role model for young viewers at the time of its broadcast on TV.  Even the train he lived on & traveled in was a work of art & well designed with all kinds of special hidden gadgets to make show interesting. These shows brought back great memories of a more simple time in history.",1403136000,2,947,4.380681818181818

3516751,5,B001CQONOA,"Simply one of those shows that cut it's own path and has never been adequately copied or imitated.  It had limits imposed by format, censorship, and the cultural cauldron of the 1960's yet struck a quirky balance that only a few equally quirky British ""cult"" shows like the Avengers, the Prisoner, Strange Report and a couple others were able to achieve.  While I give it give stars I can certainly understand a lot of people won't ""get it"" but that's what makes a ""cult classic"" what it is.

There is an audio introduction at the beginning of each episode, which is kind of nice.  It's been a long time since we've seen this show and we're really enjoying watching it again.  The only thing that isn't so good is the way the discs are packaged.  While the overyall packaging is ""cute"", the way the discs are packed makes it kind of hard to get each disc in and out.  The discs are lined up in a row standing in a cardboard footing with slots in it.  Getting the first and last disc in/out is easy, but all the ones in between are much harder.

I am just enjoying  the fun of clean good tv shows.  They  have drama fun and yes even some hug N And Kiss N .  Mr Conrad says its a James bond meets the west.  I have to agree with that statement.

3516779,4,B001CQONOA,"I know you have read all the reviews crapping about the packaging and it's all true. The discs are loosely packed in two holders. This has got to be the worst design ever. The flap does not hold the discs firmly and, through multiple handling of the case, they rattle around and get scuffed. I'm not talking about light scuffing that can be buffed out. These are major scratches.

The case, itself, is absolutely stunning. The graphics look like an leather box with metal corners. It's raised and metal embossed. If you don't know what that means, the corners and lettering look like metal and all the designs pop out and feel like real leather crafting.

Now, I have the first two seasons already and just got this to get all and the bonus movies. Took advantage of the week long special for $29.99 as it was cheaper than get the last two seasons individually. Also have to get this set for the bonus movies. I had hoped to give the one's I have away but the first two seasons had the worst damage. I will, most likely, transfer all of these to discs and shelve the originals.

As I've done with similar packaged editions (the Shout! Factory Bruce Lee collection in particular) I got multi-disc DVD cases and put them in there. Either scanned  the original artwork from the packaging or downloaded covers on some sites and printed them out so they look decent on the shelf. I just put away the bulk packaging on my oversized/special packaging shelf.

The transfers are really good and show little wear and tear. The First Season has most of the special features.

I, reluctantly, recommend this set. It's currently selling, as of May 28th, 2014, for $59.99. Even at that price it's beating out buying the seasons individually as they're going for $70 - $100 total. If you liked this show then get it. It's not likely to be this affordable for long.",1401235200,,1849,4.570996978851964

and Smudgeing, the rest had close to the same. I was thoroughly disgusted. Now I see my this
product was discounted so much. So many Customers probably returned their Set that they just
want to get rid of them. I'm going to keep the Set, for the Price that I got this for(just shy of $35.00

3516797,5,B001CQONOA,"""The Wild Wild West"" was one of the TV attempts at James Bond, along with ""Get Smart,"" ""The Man from U.N.C.L.E,"" ""Get Smart,"" and ""I Spy"" and I was addicted to all of them.  ""West"" was set in the 1870s when U. S. Grant used James West and Atremus Gordon as among the earliest secret service agents to solve various crimes.  There are some issues.  All of the women use 1960s makeup and 1960s hair, as was typical of the time.  Also, the costuming of the women who were supposed to be wearing contemporary dress was typical of the era - they were put in a dress, the skirt of which brushed the floor, and the same costume could have been used in any TV show of the era to cover any time period from 1800 to 1900.  Women's dress of the 1870s included lots of drapery, pleats, and enormous bustles.  None of these are in sight. And of course there are the completely absurd suits Robert Conrad wore -  tight Bolero  jackets with painted on trousers.  No man dressed like that in the 1870s.  But one takes the show for what it is worth - a piece of somewhat campy and mind-candy type nostalgia for those of us of a certain age who were enchanted by a genre of television drama which was very popular for a short time in the latter half of the 1960s and then disappeared with the rebirth of private eye dramas like ""Mannix"" and procedural medical dramas like ""Emergency!"" and ""Medical Center,""  and as the networks moved to cut production costs.  Costume programs were and are very expensive, and the spy gadgets did not help the bottom line.  It IS great fun to see what ""ultramodern"" gadgets West and Gordon will pull from their hats, pockets, and boot heels to get out of various situations.  You know they will prevail.  The fun is in seeing how.  It is also fun to see actors who at that time made a living doing TV guest shots, like Suzanne Pleshette, Ruta Lee, Robert Logia, and Leslie Parish, and others like Pat Paulsen (Pat Paulsen for President) who are long dead or long forgotten, in their 20s, 30s, and 40s.  And at $50 for 27 CDs, the price can't be beat.  Be prepared, however, to spend some additional money on something to protect the discs other than the flimsy pasteboard packaging provided which allows the top half of the discs to be exposed and to therefore rub against one another.  All in all, this set is a great way for us fifty somethings to go back and be reminded of what fun expesive major hit television looked like in the mid 60s.  Definitely place an order, but get another form of disc storage ready.  Then pop some popcorn, and be prepared to savor a childhood pleasure again.  Without the inconveniences of commercials and waiting four years to see the whole series.  Sit back and enjoy, because how can you not?",1399852800,,2744,4.422310756972111

3516838,4,B001CQONOA,"This is a magnificent show! First of all, I may have to explain why someone would be interested in an 'old' Western-show, probably very familiair to  everyone in the USA...  Well, you'l have to bear in mind that this show was never shown in The Netherlands. I had read an article about The Wild Wild West as a TV-show in a copy of a magazine called Comics Scene, but I have forgotten whether that was in connection with a 'soon to be published, new and improved' comic series, or in reference to the Wild Wild West movie (starring Will Smith and Kevin Kline, and I use the term 'starring' in a bit of sarcastic way...).
The article peaked a bit of interest: ""What's this? A western show with Secret Agent gadgets? Rawhide meets Man from U.N.C.L.E.?"" So naturally I was a bit curious and since that moment I have been looking for a DVD-set that would make it possible to watch this show in the DVD-format that equipment in Holland can handle (that's Region Code 2, for all you varmints). And naturally, it never came to be!
Recently I was able to get my hands on a Region Code 1 DVD-player (courtesy of the USA Airforce, Ramstein, Germany) and that opened the door to this series, for me. And I have not been disappointed!
So far, I have seen three of the four seasons, beginning in humble Black-and-White and in Full Colour from season 2.
From the very first episode, I have been entertained! This show, with its very nostalgic feel about it, has so far never bored me! I love the plots, I love seeing very familiar faces in the oodles and oodles of co-stars, recognizing people I have also seen in the 60's Batman TV-show (would you believe Victor Buono 'King Tut' in the first episode?), I love the gadgets, I love the train and I love the acting!
Of course Robert Conrad is the Dashing Hero, performing most of his stunts himself, battling the Bad Guys with amazing fisticuffs and a lot of furniture while never failing to make a good impression on the ladies! But let's not forget Ross Martin, who was responsible for every single one of his silly and amazing disguises and who was called upon to give various performances, in accordance with the appropriate disguise of that episode. This gave him a very broad range of acting and, sometimes, over-acting. But we forgive him: this is a campy show, right?
Concerning this set: I agree with the people who complain about the packaging. This is not the best way to store your DVD's, it is very possible that in time some of the discs will be scratched. That's a shame, since the material is worth better care!
But apart from that: this set is very complete, it contains every episode of the show and an appropriate amount of extra's and it will make a very nice addition to every afficianado's collection.
If a TV-series can bring a sense of nostalgia to a person, who has never seen it before, but it still takes this person back to a time that reminds him of his youth, then, Brother, this is a terrific Show!!

The music scoring session tapes alone are worth the purchase price ($50 as of this writing). This is an absolute must-have for any WILD WILD WEST fan. The only drawbacks are that the special features are not listed on the contents of the disc, or the booklet, so you have to hunt them down. And the packaging itself may look good, but it's impractical for handling & storing the discs. You'll have to get disc slips or cases to keep the discs safe.",1392422400,3,600,4.513761467889908

3516886,5,B001CQONOA,"During the late 60s, as a kid, this was one of my favorite TV series along with such other exciting entries as ""The Man from Uncle"", ""Batman"", ""Star Trek"", and even ""Lost in Space"".

The episodes are a bit formula, but there was always plenty of intrigue, great looking ladies (which I appreciated even at that young age), action ... and of course Robert Conrad at the top of his game. No one could make cool, tough and deadly look as natural as Robert Conrad. Nothing underscored this so much as the fact that he did all of his own stunts through the four year run of the show! The nostalgia factor surely plays a role, but I enjoy WWW and other top-notch shows from the 60s much more than most of the current crop of TV offerings.

Much has been made of the packaging of this set. I don't find it to be a threat to the DVDs as long as I handle them carefully, which is something I always do with DVDs anyway. The box, while large, is attractive. I have a few other box sets that don't fit into my normal alphabetic arrangement, so I just stack them on the bottom shelf of one of my CD/DVD cabinets.

I haven't watched all 102 episodes yet. I'm only part way into the first season, which is in Black & White. However, the picture looks flawless and the sound is sharp and clear. As I write this review, the price is a steal at fifty dollars.

If you're a fan of the great TV series of the 60s, this one's a no-brainer.

 This attractively boxed set is economically packaged ( though im not fond of the 2 multi disc holders as the discs seem to be loose and could spill out if not handled carefully). The quality of the picture is top notch. As far as extras/behind the scenes, there's no shortage here to satisfy the true fan of this innovative western themed series from the historic title search to Robert Conrad's narrative before each episode. The guest stars are  fun to identify for those who are celebrity face watchers of this TV era, and there's a lot of them. Great fun to watch as a rerun, and now even better to own.",1389484800,2,804,4.576388888888889
3516897,4,B001CQONOA,"One of the DVDs had scratches but it did not affect the play, I would have given this collection 5 stars except that the packaging inside the box set could have been better. the DVD's are in two cardboard saddlebags which promote scratching of the DVDs. That aside, the DVD's are great quality, they are not double sided and the show is remastered. The show itself definitely gets 5 stars. I forgot how much fun this show was to watch. It's James Bond in the old west, what's not to like. Even with the cheesy packaging I would still highly recommend getting this collection.",1389484800,,575,4.538461538461538

Though, the dvds should be separated, so far we have not found any scratches.  The special features are not exciting, but, Robert Conrad's intro into each episode is fun to hear.  Having the complete series, we are seeing episodes we never saw in syndication. I highly recommend this collection.",1389398400,,433,4.631578947368421

3516915,5,B001CQONOA,"A lot of reviewers have commented on the bad packaging and I couldn't agree more with them.  The manufacturer should be ashamed to put this product out with the crappy method of securing disks that he did.  That said, my disks appear to be in acceptable condition.  The first few are scuffed (not scratched) but I was able to polish the scuffs off and the disks play fine.  Now...The WIld Wild West!  One of my favorite TV show of all time.  I though the cheesy sound stage settings would bother me more than it does.  What I do find is the joy of watching this wonderful series from some 50 years ago..",1389139200,2,603,4.330357142857143
3516916,5,B001CQONOA,"First off, I agree with those who have complained about the packaging. Pretty but not workable. Still, all of the discs were in brand-new shape with no evident damage done by the goofy saddlebags. Bought 27 jewel cases and I was good to go. Even adding in the price of the cases, the total cost was still less than had I bought the four seasons individually.

This was a nostalgia-driven purchase, to be clear. I didn't buy it for the great writing or acting or set-design. The writing is occasionally clever. The actors all seem to have attended the same school as William Shatner, by which I don't mean they are bad but broad and not at all subtle. And the sets are pretty clearly recycled from episode to episode. All that to say, The Wild Wild West is not The Wire, The Sopranos or Battlestar Galactica (or choose your own example of great television).

So, why 5 stars? There's the afore-mentioned nostalgia. Something about the shows of my childhood (Star Trek, The Man From UNCLE, I Spy) continues to resonate. Perhaps it's the naivet, the earnestness, the good guys winning and the bad guys losing. There's no ambiguity and there's comfort in that.

Jim West and Artemus Gordon are Secret Services agents, assigned by President U. S. Grant to seek out various evils that threaten to destroy the country as we know it, and eliminate them. Along the way Jim wears skin tight pants, walks around without a shirt on, makes out with a beautiful woman (sometimes good, sometimes not so good), engages in fisticuffs, risks his life for the good of the nation, and brings down the bad guy. Artemus, meanwhile, wears disguises, hooks Jim up with Q-like gadgets (Steampunk long before there was Steampunk), and stands by awkwardly while Jim and the damsel smooch. The chemistry between the two leads is warm. They seem to genuinely like each other. And the various villains (admittedly, some are more believable than others) are of the megalomaniacal kind, the most notorious of whom is Miguelito Loveless played by the brilliant Michael Dunn. Their vision wildly outstrips their grasp, but that's how it goes for evil people with dreams of world domination, at least on television.

It is not necessarily great art, but it is great fun. And that's nothing to sneeze at. So leave your cynicism at the door, then buy and watch and have a good time.",1389139200,6,2345,4.740196078431373

I have not been disappointed!  I love it!  Thanks Amazon!!  I noticed before I bought it that some reviewers complained about the packaging of the DVD's - I say, if you handle them carefully, you'll be fine!

3516938,4,B001CQONOA,"First the good, the transfer to DVD was flawless in my set.  The picture and sound was crisp and clear.  It was fun to watch the old show again.
Now the bad, the boxed set has the worst packaging that I have ever seen.  The disks are in little cardboard holders that allow them to move around and get scuffed and scratched.  I was lucky in that only a few were scuffed and all were salvageable.  I invested in some plastic multi-disk cases (one for each season) and threw the cardboard ones away.
Now to the show: those that are familiar with the slam-bang violence, explosions and gore of today's shows will be bored.  Yes, the shows are formulaic, yes, basically the same thing happens on every show (Jim fights, Artie disguises, Jim gets, then gets rid of, girl, etc.)  Still I find the shows to be much more fun than the stuff that is on today.  You knew that they were acting, that some of the stuff they did was impossible and that the actors knew what they were doing was not Shakespeare, but it was fun.
I will give the show 4 stars and the packaging 1/2 star.",1384300800,4,1068,4.305

3516944,5,B001CQONOA,"The Wild Wild West was a favorite of ours back in the 60s. So we looked forward to watching it again on DVDs. We are amazed at the difference between then and now. It's interesting how our viewing preferences change over the years. Having said that, I still love watching it, but for different reasons. If the value of being entertained is to take you away from the stress and pressure of modern day living, this series is still doing an outstanding job of doing just  that. It's corny in the most delightful way.. to quote Julie Andrews. We're glad they changed to color in the second season, and we're looking forward to that. Over all, if you want to watch a fun show, which will entertain you and make you smile, this is the one. Another plus is recognizing all the actors of that era as they appear as guest stars in the shows. There are many discs in the box, and we're looking forward to all of them!!",1382486400,2,908,4.341176470588235

3516950,5,B001CQONOA,"This series was produced at a time when American television was dominated by Westerns, yet we also had the threat of the Cold War, and international spies. We knew about Chemical Warfare and the Atom Bomb. The strangeness of Computers were making their way into our lives. More people had telephones and automobiles. New knowledge was available with algebra, calculus, world history, and social philosophy offered more and more at High School level instead of just to college students.

We Americans love our Western heroes yet we are drawn to the widening world of adventure with international connections.

Enter Secret Service Agent James West, the man in between. This series brought an amalgamation of both worlds together, with inventive scripts and amazing special effects in the new visionary realm of television.

While Ian Flemming's spy novels introduced us to James Bond, his suave manner, his way with the girls--and who can leave out the gadgetry. In similar Bond -esque manner, The Wild Wild West with Robert Conrad gave us the straight shooting man with his fast gun and cowboy hat riding on the American icon of the magnificent horse.

The Wild Wild West Television series gave us glimpse of the technological impact of a coming change. The huge world of international interaction was just around the corner. With a dash of comedy, quick witted quips, fast guns and fist fights, the Wild Wild West series put to use new weapons and the strength of the mind outmaneuvering the enemy over the simple battle formation of stand and fight to the death.

If you like the marriage of international intrigue, suspense, adventure and amazing gadgetry side by side with forty-fives, high heeled boots, Stetsons, and horses, then The Wild Wild West the Complete Series is a great buy.",1379030400,,1790,5.013468013468014

Not the strongest material, so continuous use would probably end in damage. The two TV movies are not the best quality, you have to consider when they were made. Not many TV shows/movies were filmed in digital formats.
Overall I got what I ordered and I am very happy with it. The Wild Wild West has always been a favorite, now I can watch it when I want. Love the episodes with Dr. Loveless.

3516970,5,B001CQONOA,"The Wild Wild West shows are classics. Very enjoyable to watch and remember how TV was in the 1970s. they don't make shows like this anymore, unfortunately. Brings back very good memories of the past.",1370649600,,200,4.742857142857143
3516971,5,B001CQONOA,"This has always been one of my favorite TV shows. Our local ""oldies"" TV network was running it but stopped recently so I decided to go ahead and buy this, which turned out to be a good decision.  The product arrived promptly and in good condition.",1370649600,,247,4.369565217391305
3516972,3,B001CQONOA,"The original shows run the full spectrum, some are really good, some not so much.  They all have interesting plots and most all have memerable characters, but there are some off the scale of believability with no possible 19th century explanation. So while some are centered around believable innovations that pose a serious threat to national security, others inexplicable contain 20th century technology in such an offhanded way that it makes one wonder if the writers simply forgot the story was supposed to take place in the 1860s. The science fiction should have been taken from Jules Vern not Star Trek.  Actually, the episodes that suffer from this are reminiscent of Lost in Space.  Fortunately, these episodes do not dominate the series.

One disappointment, the DVDs are not packaged well.  They are contained into two saddle bag like cases made of light cardboard with built in sleeves that only cover half of the DVD, so although it looks cute, it's not the type of protection DVDs need, at least in my house anyway.",1370217600,,1028,4.91907514450867
3516973,5,B001CQONOA,"Too Much Fun. Now that I am 47 years past when it first hit the air, it is a scream to realize that there were people who were writting the weekly adventures for this program were also writing for Star Trek. As soon as you watch a particular episode you go, ""Hey, wait a minute.. . ""

It came in the time of the new world of Color TV. It  just started and boy, did they go out of the way to get that point across. And it was very clear that all the people on the screen were having a ball. It was just fun. And it is still fun to sit back and watch Jim and Artie save America an hour at a time.",1369785600,2,594,3.7063492063492065
3516974,5,B001CQONOA,"Before our purchase of this Series we reviewed what everyone had to say about the product and we agree that the packaging could have been better.  Still in all, if the disk are handled properly they, as with any media which is taken care of, should last for years to come. Our disk arrived in good condition and unscratched.  If you wish you could buy at very low cost paper jackets that will cover the disk completely that is if you feel that the disk might be jarred from the relatively loose packaging.  Over forty two years ago my wife and I watched the original The Wild Wild West which was transmitted over the air on my then girlfriend's round eighteen inch, color TV.  We enjoyed the series then and still do so as we watch them on our sixty inch high definition flat screen.  The picture quality, of course, is much better that it originally used to be especially since they have enhanced it to today's standards. One thing that I was disappointed about was the poor sound quality used to record the actor's words as he gave a quick summery before some of the programs.  After all, what could it have hurt to have taken a few minutes more to make sure that the microphone and the background acoustic were properly set?  However, regardless of the poor sound quality of the actor's episode remarks the weekly episodes themselves we just as good if not better than they always had been.  The plots, of course, is not complicated by today's standards, but they are fun to watch.  I recommend this set to anyone who would enjoy the advent of a gadget filled action packed western that helped to create the action standards of today.",1369267200,4,1637,4.522033898305085

He told me that a few of the discs were scratched during shipping because the disc are just in cardboard and not a protective cover.  He was able to smooth out most of them with little damage so far but we are not through all of them.  For the price you pay for these items they really should be better protected.  That is the only reason I did not give a 5 star.,1369094400,,474,3.90625

3516984,5,B001CQONOA,"If you grew up during the better days of television, then you are aware of THE WILD WILD WEST.  This was a weekly  television show based on the premise of two 'intelligence' individuals in the then developing secret service in the 19th century - 1870's.  While some of the contraptions and special gadgets Agents West and Gordon use (contrived) they were a little ahead of their time, but then Dick Tracy had his two way wrist watch well before that came into being.  What makes this program entertaining is the plots, the underhanded criminals who as today, are out to take over the nation, world and become the number 1 leader,  financial and industrial controller, (wait - we are still dealing with such individuals in today's society).  The plots are easily contrived, the action is that of the 'old west' with some modern twists, and the good guys usually win after the natural struggle and pro-con activities.  Again, this is better television than the 'shows' broadcasters try to pawn off as good entertainment television.",1366502400,2,1029,4.879310344827586

3517021,3,B001CQONOA,"I love this and watched it since I was a kid. It is imaginative and sort of ""steam punk"" before the term was coined. The main characters resemble a kind of James bond; Mission Impossible and Macgyver set in a Western era.

Instead of the ""one man"" Bond we have a ""two man"" team. I like team work and the lesson it gives. We don't always get to do everything alone. Not as much team work as Mission Impossible but still shows the importance of reliance on others.

Stories are generally very creative filled with Science Fiction ideas. Some of which might actually work :-) In summary the series gets a 5. So why 3? Because of packaging. It is so badly done that the DVDs may easily be damaged. The just stuff them next to each other in a few cardboard holders. My suggestion is to get a box of regular DVD holders at the same time you order this. As soon as you get the box take the DVDs out and put them in regular holders and be all set. Just hope they were not damaged in shipping. If so it is pretty simple to remove minor scratches.

This is one of the original TV series that introduced us to undercover work and wry humor.  One of the most amazing things that I find in this series is Ross Martin playing so many different characters in disguise and doing such a wonderful job.

I have been on an old 60's TV series kick lately and this was truly one of my favorites and worth every penny.",1347408000,,531,4.237623762376238

Also included is a bonus disc: ""Wild Wild West revisited 1979"" and ""More Wild Wild West 1980"". The discs are packaged in order by season. (4 seasons) There is also a complete episode guide which includes a brief description of every program. The video quality is great for 47 year old technology although the first few episodes were filmed in black and white.

3517027,5,B001CQONOA,"A destinctive entry at a time when westerns were GUNSMOKE, WAGON TRAIN, RAWHIDE and BONANZA.  It is basically James Bond on horseback in an old west that might have been designed by Jules Verne. This show was ACTION ... ACTION ... ACTION.  Robert Conrad did all of his own stunt work -- the first actor ever inducted into the Stunt Man's Hall of Fame.  In her book on the series Susan Keesler counted that James West was involved in 394 fights with 940 opponents in the four year run of the series.  West fought multiple opponents at one time (usually three to five). Ross Martin wss a combination of the Bond series ""Q"" and Rollin Hand of MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE donning 124 disgues. The show was FUN with guest stars that included Robert Duvall, Robert Logia, Leslie Parrish, Ed Begley, Richard Kiel and a host of others.  The set contains the two WWW revivals.  Entertaining but never equalling the original series.",1333497600,2,914,4.68125
3517028,3,B001CQONOA,Packaging leaves a lot to be desired as has been stated in other reviews but for the price I thought this was a better deal.  However I'm not a big expert on how many episodes there were or what all the titles were but it seems that even though this contains 2 season with 28 episodes each and 2 with 24 episodes each and the 2 movies they did after that it seems episodes I remember are not included; this may just be my memory but I seem to recall more episodes where they used the dual 6 shooters mounted to the table and in all of these I only saw them used like twice.  Again this may just be my failing memory I only bring it up because on some other review I've read about other series complete sets some of these people that do know all the episodes pointed out on those series there were specific episodes that were not included so this may be the case here.  The only bad thing I can really say is the cardboard saddle bag DVD holders were a bad Idea if you just want to have this to watch once in awhile and store it away or if you don't mind getting jewell cases to put the DVDs into then this will be a great buy and save a good chunk of change over buying each season seperatley.,1331424000,3,1193,4.025316455696203

3517030,3,B001CQONOA,"I read the other reviews on this product and they were spot on.  I too was diappointed on how this was packaged.  It is so bad that some of the disc were scratched and when played either freeze up or jump a few clips. I guess I should have sent it back and either got a refund or try anoter set, but if I did get another set who is to say that set wouldn't be worse or the same, so I will just stick with what I got.  If I was you and want Wild Wild West than get the shows one at a time,if you can.

3517032,1,B001CQONOA,"Review for complete series box set only.
Great series but horrible packaging. The 20+ discs are packaged in 2 card stock containers that look like little saddle bags but only have thick paper seperation half way up the discs so the entire top half of all the discs make contact with each other and loose spacing makes any movement friction mare the other disc.  It may look good to some but expect most discs to be scratched, many will have skips and in our case they were all dirty and sticky.
This seller has known of these problems but keeps selling this set as ""New"", this box set should be pulled from stock and returned to the studios or sold as ""Acceptable"" condition with a full disclaimer of all the known problems.  Suggest you believe all the bad reviews about the packaging and don't misplace your trust like we did that this seller would have pulled all known bad stock and only sold ""New"" condition product as they advertise.",1328659200,23,939,4.550295857988166

3517034,5,B001CQONOA,"i've read the above reviews, and not only did it delay my purchase of this set, but i knew i had to have it even though i bought the individual seasons. i found the set and packaging to be fantastic! the two cd ""cases"" are removable and when you bend the flaps back (along the creases), you find that they are in fact saddle bags. the discs are easily accessible and there is little risk of damage because the discs are standing on end. you can file through any or all of them.

i've seen worse packaging from cd box sets where they put the discs in slots in the covers; now, if that doesn't scratch up your discs, i don't know what will.

i just need to see if my discs are defective. that could take a while.... i've reviewed the movies, though, and they play and look fantastic. the filming is a little different as how all made-for-tv movies are filmed (and harry morgan [R.I.P.] gives a feel of a fun disney show...), but the two movies give you an overall feel of a good old-fashioned spaghetti western - recommended for anybody interested in western adventure!

i can only hope that this dvd set is the last word on the wild wild west series.

(i just looked my discs over, by the way, [didn't take that long] and there are some very minor scratches on a few of them, but that is from the handlers i'm sure; and, if any of your discs do get scratched, they have repair kits that really do work.)

Edit: i've concluded that the cd cases are nothing more than that. they are not saddle bags, or gun holsters. they are ""holsters"" for the cd's. they are ""high tech"" cd cases from the wild wild west!",1327017600,3,1602,4.273927392739274

3517037,4,B001CQONOA,"I won't comment on the packaging to much as many have mentioned the problems. I have noticed some fine scratches on some of the disks, nothing that seems to be causing any problems.
The packaging is fine except for the actual disks as they rub together causing scratching.
I would recommend going to Staples and getting one of there  slip sleeve storage cases. They have them that will hold hundreds of disks safely and are inexpensive to buy. This should take care of the disks.

As far as the series the transfer is great quality, both video and audio.
It has been decades since I watched this series so it is like watching the episodes for the first time.
Bonanza which has been running nonstop for decades, the Wild Wild West hasn't.

So do yourself a treat and get this great boxed set.

There should have been more thought put into the inside packaging. The cardboard DvD holders are extremely unwieldy with the velcro holding the flap very tightly closed, You have to be careful you don't tear or bend the cardboard flap each time you get a disc out. The discs are very tightly enclosed together if you don't have thin fingers (luckily I do) it would be quite the task removing them from their respective cases. The introductions by Robert conrad were a nice behind the scenes touch, I just wish they went the extra mile and had video introductions as well, especially  the interviews with the writers.

Ok, so the episodes are predictable but its always fun watching how things turn out at the end.  I read the reviews about the packaging and still bought it anyway, because for the price I paid ($35)it was well worth it. 5 stars for the show minus a ding for the packaging. I fixed the problem with the packaging by inserting an index card between each disc.  Just number the cards so it will be easy to find the one you want to take out or to put it back in its place.

The packaging of this DVD set leaves something to be desired and I give it only 3 stars. I think the creators of the packaging tried to do something western but didn't quite know what to do. It looks odd and the DVD's don't have much protection.(I got other packaging to protect the DVD's themselves) With 104 episodes and 2 movies there is PLENTY of quality TV to watch. The chemistry between Robert Conrad and Ross Martin on this series was incredible. The writing was also top notch. I recommend this TV series to anyone!!,1323043200,,627,4.367521367521367

The packaging is fine although not the best.  My only complaint is that it is hard to figure where the disc goes and which is the next one without counting discs.
If you enjoy Westerns and remember watching WWW in the 70's these DVD's you will like.  Gone are the days when you simply put a disc in, pushed play and sat back.
And the price is right!",1322438400,,517,4.181818181818182
3517052,5,B001CQONOA,"The Wild Wild West is one of my three all-time favorite shows (the others being U.N.C.L.E. and the original Hawaii Five-O)  Everyone knows that the premise of WWW was originally James Bond on horseback.  Most people know that it evolved from a more traditional western adventure to a series with many fantasy elements, a show that was itself as ahead of its time as the futuristic gadgetry used in some many episodes.  As one who watched this series from the first episode my favorite thing about this show was that it was as enjoyable its last episode as it was its first.  Many fantasy and action series from the 1960s devolved as they went along.  Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea started as a futuristic combination of sci. fi. and James Bond elements.  By its third season, it became the monster of the week series with the Submarine Seaview being menaced by the likes of evil Leprecans and Lobster-Men.  Lost in Space started fairly serious for about 5 or 6 episodes until it turned into the Dr. Smith and the Robot show sinking to levels unheard of like ""The Great Vegetable Rebellion"" featuring walking, talking vegetables.  The worst was The Man from U.N.C.L.E. which turned from an enjoyable spy romp played seriously its first and most of its second season to a third season featuring hiccup gas, explosive apples and an episode entitled ""My Friend the Gorilla Affair,"" possibly the worst episode of all-time.  This never happened to The Wild Wild West (although the two WWW movies did fall into that trap and as a result weren't very good.)
I did not buy this box set as I already purchased each season separately.  As someone who has seen the episodes many times, I thought I would comment about some of my favorites from each season.
A. The Night of the Puppeteer (season 1)  Probably the most imaginative of season 1.  In a Dr. Phibes-like episode Lloyd Bochner plays Zachariah Skull (one of my favorite names ever,) a mad puppeteer who uses life-like marionettes to put West on trial.  My favorite episode of the first season.
B. The Night of the Man-Eating House (season 2) West, Gordon and a criminal they are escorting spend the night in a House of Usher-like house in the bayou.  A very creepy episode with a ghost, many spider-webs and an elderly villain played by Hurd Hatfield who gets younger as long as he remains in this living house.
C. The Night of the Lord of Limbo (season 2) Ricardo Montalban as a disabled Confederate officer who has mastered the art of time travel and plans to use it to change the outcome of the Civil War.  Great episode.
D. The Night of the Towering Tontine (season 2) My favorite of the several ""10 Little Indians""-like episode TWWW did, wherein a group of investors get murdered in imaginative ways, one at a time.  WWW did this type of plot extremely well.
E. The Night of the Falcon (season 3)  Robert Duvall and a giant cannon threatening Denver.  A very memorable prop that was written up in a TV guide article.
F. The Night of the Simian Terror (season 3)  My favorite gothic episode: lightning, wind, rain, murders, a mad scientist, a gorilla and Richard Kiel.  WWW had such great production values despite being made on a modest budget like most series of that era, this episode really shows those values.
G. The Night of the Kraken (season 4)  My favorite sea monster episode with a (seemingly) giant squid and a villain played by Ted Knight.  Another very exciting episode.
H. The Night of the Bleak Horror (season 4)  More gothic horror is a ""Hound of the Baskervilles""-like plot featuring a stormy island with waves crashing, thunder, lightning, a howling creature and Hitchcock-favorite John Williams as a Sherlock Holmes-like character assisting West. (This was the season where Ross Martin had suffered a heart attack and there were several guest-stars appearing to assist West, while Martin was recovering.)
Well those are my favorite WWW episodes.  Of course, there are many more but those are my most memorable.
In conclusion, WWW remained a quality show throughout the length of its run.  Theres no telling how long it could have lasted had it not been prematurely cancelled by CBS as a result of Congressional hearings on violence in tv.
However to those of us who remember watching it every Friday night at 7:30, it remains a very memorable show and one that still holds up greatly.",1321574400,3,4356,4.722589167767503
3517053,5,B001CQONOA,"Cowboys, Secret Agents, super-villains, action, adventure, humor and in at least one episode flying saucers.  There is something for everybody and it all meshes together seamlessly.  The show was very creative and clever.  Robert Conrad and Ross Martin do their best work here as Jim West and Artemus Gordon, two secret agents traveling by train in the wild, wild, west.  The show was still running strong when it was cancelled in its fourth season for excessive violence (actually it was pretty mild by today's standards so don't let that stop you from buying this collection).  Because of its premature cancellation, it never had the chance to deteriorate which makes all the episodes worth watching.

The first season was black and white.  I do regret that the second season does not have audio introductions by Robert Conrad.  I had forgotten how many actors in Star Trek also appeared in Wild, Wild West.  Also, I did not realize Richard Pryor appeared in an episode of Wild, Wild West.

3517067,4,B001CQONOA,"...'Wild, Wild West' invented steampunk before anyone knew what 'steampunk' is.  I remember it as a hokey '60s western, but it's pretty cool: an 1870s secret service agent traveling the west in an armored traincar, with his trusty sidekick Ross Martin, and all sorts of cool gadgets.  The gadgets include cars, modern movies, explosives, laser beams (!!!), and yes, androids.  Think 'Bonanza' with fembots and Robert Conrad.  The early black-and-white episodes are more mystery-oriented, the later color episodes a bit more campy.  Much like 'Lost In Space', which this show somewhat resembles (lots of familiar faces in both series.)

Watch for the derringer hidden in Robert Conrad's arm.  It kind of 'feels' like Irwin Allen, but the writing is infinitely better for the most part.

The opening sequence is clever with animated stills of various scenes becoming 'live' one-by-one.

One major flaw, and the reason this set is not getting 5 stars - there is no ""play all"" feature on each DVD.  That is, one has to hit 'play' for each of the 4 episodes per DVD.  Kind of irritating, not a deal-stopper, but I would prefer for one hit of the button to play all of the episodes on the DVD.

Worse, even though the set comes in a large box, there are no standard DVD cases, jewel cases, slimline cases, or anything else we've come to expect.  The DVDs come in a cardboard accordion-type sleeve, which I believe is supposed to be a saddlebag (and it's incredibly difficult to find the right sleeve when it's time to return the disc.)  I found some minor scratches on the DVDs - not enough to affect playability, but enough to make me wish for more standard DVD packaging.

Comes with a bonus disc with the standalone movies from years later (1979's 'Wild Wild West Revisited, and 1980's 'More Wild Wild West.') Other than that, not a lot in the way of extras.

Still, on balance, it's much better to have this DVD set than not.  And even cooler that the entire series and extra movies come in one set.

[...]
The video quality is great - nice and crisp. I deducted a star as the audio seems to be low - normally I view my TV at volume level 15 and have no problem viewing most shows and DVDs. I have it cranked up double than that just so I can hear it - and have to raise it more to hear Robert Conrad's audio introduction to each episode (which is a nice addition I think!) Audio levels seem to have just been recorded lower than many discs are.

Overall this is a must have set for fans of the series.

On older shows like this, it's rare to get a lot of extra's and this set has more than most which makes it fun. Honestly, I rarely watch the extras on any dvd (if I do, I might watch them once then ignore them since I'm mostly interested in the show or movie themselves).",1302220800,3,976,3.9693877551020407

3517082,4,B001CQONOA,"Maybe I got lucky. I had read quite a few reviews in regards to this collection and was a little leery about purchasing it. Most of the negative comments were about the packaging and scratches on the discs. These were valid comments. I did find some scratches but the discs played very well either through a blu-ray or standard dv player. The price was right, the quality was very good and I am totally satisified.",1299283200,5,414,4.533333333333333
3517083,5,B001CQONOA,"I bought the Season 2 DVD set for my teenage son for Christmas and he loved it so much, I went back and bought the complete series for him. My husband and I both remember loving the reruns as kids and it's been as much for us to experience it again as its been for my kids to discover it for the first time. Even though it's now 40 plus years-old, it still holds up and my son calls it the ""best TV show ever."" Wildly inventive plot lines, characters and props, it's a little bit James Bond, Jules Verne and Gunsmoke all at the same time. And it's also fun seeing some of the guest stars like Suzanne Pleshette or Ida Lupino who made appearances on the show early in their careers.

I chose Season 2 to start with because it was the first season to be filmed in color and I thought a 13 year-old might not give it a chance in black & white. However, now that we're 1/2 way through Season 1, I think it may be the best of all. The episodes seemed to be a little darker and edgier the first year, with even more emphasis on Jim's artillery of cool gadgets. The pilot episode where they set it all up (""Night of the Inferno"") was fantastic. I think like a lot of shows, it was maybe commercialized a bit after it's initial success to reach a broader audience. It continued to be a great show, just a bit more campy after the first year. Robert Conrad and Ross Martin really had great chemistry together (with Jim's cool James Bond-like character juxtaposed with Artie's disguises and comic relief) and could be considered one of TVs all-time great duos.

Unlike a lot of the other reviewers, I don't really have a problem with the packaging. I think it looks great, but then I'm not really anal about that kind of stuff. The design of the dvd storage pieces doesn't seem to have a negative impact that I can see -- none of them arrived scratched or damaged in any way and don't seem to be in any danger now. If you want each dvd in it's own case, however, it might be better to buy each season individually. This set does include some fun extras including audio intros to each episode by Robert Conrad, the two TV movies and a printed guide to all of the episodes. If you loved this series the first time, I'm sure you will enjoy reliving it. When there's nothing on TV we want to watch, we just put on the next episode of The Wild, Wild West. Always a good time!",1298332800,4,2360,4.219026548672566
3517084,5,B001CQONOA,"Overall, I still give this five stars because it's a lovely set to own. You get the entire original TV series, plus the two ""reunion"" movies which aren't including in the individual season sets and it all comes in a very handsome box. The box itself is sturdy and well made - but now we come to the downside which is the truly awful design of the internal packaging. Inside the box, nested in a moulded plastic tray covered in faux-suede material are two flimsy card boxes shaped like, I assume, saddle bags. Inside these are the 27 discs...but they're simply stuffed into a card concertina-like affair that has the discs crammed right next to each other so that they are free to rub against one another. The combination of raw card sleeve and this invariably lead to disc scratching; in my set five or six of the discs were scuffed and scratched but fortunately still playable. On top of that it's a royal pain trying to access the disc you want. My advice is to replace all the internal packing with some 8-disc Amaray style cases since the main box is exactly the right size to hold two standard size DVD cases side by side. Or the DVD's *will* end up being ruined.",1297641600,79,1168,4.462616822429907

3517086,1,B001CQONOA,I recalled this being one of my favorite shows (in reruns on cable in the 1980's) as a teenager.  I couldn't wait to get this boxed set and see these episodes again...  Wow.  We forget how far action entertainment has come in the last 30 years!!!  Every episode:  Jim gets ambushed.  Jim fights with clumsy henchmen.  Jim gets away.  Artemus fools bad guys with disguise.  Jim gets girl.  Jim drops girl.  They ride off on train laughing.  I only manged to watch about 3 episodes and couldn't take any more...  Some childhood memories are best left memories.,1297123200,14,558,4.628865979381444
3517087,5,B001CQONOA,"Robert Conrad was in his finest form. My brother and I would never miss a chance to see what Jim and Artie were going to save the United States from this week.  What would be the nifty gadgets they would use, or the disguises we see Artie in.  The best days of my youth were spent pretending to partner up with West and Gordon to solve the toughest crimes and catch the worst bad guys. Dr Loveless, as a bad guy, had no equal, but his good guy match in James West always showed that if the good guy was clever enough, he would always win.  And get the girl.  Go to work and kiss pretty girls. No finer work...if you can get it.
Now for the rest:
I found the packaging to be imaginative and easy to use.  The seasons are color coded and well marked.  I did not need any further packaging such as individual sleeve wraps. The commentary by Robert Conrad was interesting and informative.  The backstage look at Ross Martin and Michael Dunn gave more than a few laughs and some groaners. I never knew Ross was an artist and a concert violinist.  You'll just have to get the set and find out for yourself. I can't give it all away.

3517109,5,B001CQONOA,"Before I ordered this I went on line and read the reviews; all of which stated some real issues with the packaging.  The idea for packaging the discs what horrible and the receipt of the package proved the reviews to be valid.  So before I ordered the package I decided I would buy a small dvd disc holder capable of holding 27 discs, which I found at a local store (starting with Office and ending with Depot) for about $15.00.  I found everyone of my discs so far to be free from scratching and they all play in my DVD players.  The shows are classic and sometimes a little contrived and campy - just the type of mind numbing entertainment I love.  Anyone skeptical about getting this compliation should not worry.  I ordered from ""mightysilver"" through Amazon, got the two day free shipping and the package was traceable (through Amazon and Fedex) all the way to my front door. I do recommend getting a disc storage ""Vault"" as it just makes it so easy to get the discs out of that dinky holder and into  protective sleeves. Fortunately these came along at the right time as there is absolutely nothing on television (living in Houston - we're stuck with the Dis ""Astros""- which means there's no sports), which means with this awesome set there's always something on television.  Finally, I absolutely love the first season being in black and white - it's an over 50 thing.  Great shows, great villians and great concepts - it's amazing how much of the threats to the national security of this country in the late 1800's was never publicized; thank goodness the WWW exposed these plots and now they are now preserved for your viewing pleasure.",1280361600,2,1645,4.6061643835616435

3517123,5,B001CQONOA,"If you grew up watching CBS-TV's ""Wild Wild West"" during the '60s or if you discovered the show in the many re-runs over the past four decades, this is for you. Every episode from all four seasons, inculding the b&w first season, along with two circa 1980 made for Tv movies.

  These are re-mastered uncut episodes just as they were filmed and aired back in the '60s, a good value and perfect for any fan of the series. Having siad this now for the flip side.

 The DVDs are stored in two pouches and are seperated only by paper slots. The disks can contact each other and it is possible for them to get scratched. Also the pouches are not sealed and dust and dirt can reach the exposed disks created further possibilities for scratching.  Keep the DVDs in the case to avoid getting dust on them.

I can't believe the morons who came up with the design...I'm sure they aren't into collecting movies or they would have never conceived such a cheap idea.  They aren't even in protective sleeves.  They sit in small compartment which covers about 2/3 of the discs leaving the tops to carelessly scrape against one another.

I thought about returning them but figure I could end up with a set in worse condition.  I generally burn all of my movies to discs and play them while leaving the originals on my dvd shelf.  I just hope there isn't one or two discs that are completely damaged and cannot be copied.

This is the FIRST time I've had to actually throw out the box they came in, and purchase a little DVD wallet w/sleeves to transfer the discs into.  When I read the reviews before I bought this, I kept thinking to myself, ""how bad could the packaging really be..."" --- well .....BAD!!  So bad, that in order to protect the discs from further scuffing, they truly cannot stay in their original box.  In fact, I'm floored that these discs play at all (so far, they do, and I had better hope they continue to because I've pitched the box already)..they are more scratched up looking than some of the various DVD discs my kids have abused over the years.  We've played probably 7 or 8 of these discs (and we didn't start with disc 1 and go from there -- purposely, we did some ""sampling"" throughout the pack because I was envisioning this would be the first set I would have to return to Amazon....in fact, hubs thinks that we actually probably got a returned set because visually these look SO bad, they do not look new at all....) ....but so far they play perfectly.  And others who did return their set, got replacements that were JUST as bad...so I figured we'd keep them if they play..and they do (so far).

The show is as we remember it and my husband (it was a birthday gift for him) really enjoys it.  But we can't display them (like I would like to, in their original box) on the DVD bookcase we have along with the others which is a shame. Part of the fun to me is to have a nice big colorful collection of neatly arranged box sets to choose from..and then, next to those, is a little black wallet with ""Wild Wild West"" written on it in a marker.

What were they thinking when they designed the packaging.  It's hardly difficult to come up with good DVD pkg now-a-days - not like they have to reinvent the wheel ....its been done before!  And cost effectively too.  In fact, I don't think this was so much that the mfgs were trying to be cheap (although they achieved that remarkably well) - it is more pure negligence on their part.

It had it all-evil criminal masterminds concocting clever schemes, dastardly(and beautiful)dames and of course a cacophony of James Bond-like gadgets. The best episodes were the 10 where our heroes, James West and Artemus Gordon, matched wits with Professor Moriarty-ish villian Dr. Miguelito Loveless. The guest star list reads like a who's who of cult '60's icons such as Lloyd Bochner,Kathie Browne and Nick Adams, plus future stars like Katherine Ross and Robert Duvall. The plots are some of the most imaginative ever to grace television. Even though the first season is generally considered the best,there is very little drop off from seasons 1-4. Unfortunately 8 of the 10 Loveless episodes are in seasons 1 and 2. The show probably could have run for several more seasons, but was cancelled due to a crackdown on television violence(perhaps the opening credits montage where the cowboy punches a saloon girl in the face was a clue). As a kid the show was just plain fun to watch and after getting the set my opinion hasn't changed as an adult. Except for a bonus disc of the two WWW TV movies and audio intros from star Robert Conrad in season 1 the rest of the set is devoid of any extra bonus material.

It was kind of a 'Western' version of Batman, now that I reflect on it. Great campy villains, wonderful (repetitive) plot lines and cute females for the boys to compete over. A lot of reviewers have commented on the packaging, but I usually take my DVDs out of the lavish packaging and place them in discgear holders, so I've not had any issues with disc damage. I bought this set for the shows, which take me back to my youth and sitting in the living room wondering how Jim and Arty could ever escape form this predicament - but they always did. As i re-watch these episodes I can't wipe the grin off my face at these wonderful classic TV episodes. For this price, the collection is a great buy. This is the TV I grew up on, and in a time where watching 24 hour news just depresses the hell out of me this collection offers respite and escape to a simpler time.",1237248000,142,1020,4.290155440414508

Both of us have said so often that we wished we could watch Wild, Wild West that I started looking for it online. And found it at amazon.com, of course.
I think we were both even more pleased than we anticipated when we watched the first episode together. It's a series with a little bit of everything... romance, comedy, mystery, science, history and fiction. James West may not be Superman, but together with his indispensible companion, Artemus Gordon, he has saved the US from imminent doom more times than I can count. And entertained us delightfully every step of the way.",1232323200,2,736,4.5
3517160,4,B001CQONOA,"First, let me say that I sympathize with the fans who bought the season sets before the box set was released. I can imagine the frustration of having to pay more plus not getting the two TV movies. I was 11 when the series debuted and it quickly became my favorite show. I only missed one episode(""Night of The Tartar"") in the four year run. Now, that I have the box set, I'll  finally be able to see it. I think I'll wait until 7:30 PM, February 3rd to watch it. It will be 42 years to the hour since the original broadcast.<G> So far, I've watched 44 episodes since I received the box set and I'm very impressed with the video and audio of most of them. They're all good, but most are very crisp and pristine. The '79 TV movie is quite entertaining and the picture quality is excellent. I can't say the same for the '80 movie. It would have to qualify as one of the worst movies ever made, and the video quality pales in comparison with the first film. The Special Features are nothing to get excited about. The best one is Conrad and Martin's appearance on a 1978 talk show. It's a pity that the entire show isn't included. As an original fan, I can remember all the press releases claiming that Robert Conrad did all his own stunts. I'd heard stories down thru the years, that this wasn't the case, and now I know for sure. While he did the vast majority of them, it's quite evident in a few episodes that a stunt double was used.  I especially enjoyed one particular gem from the first season; Dr. Loveless(Michael Dunn) and his partner singing ""Sloop John B."" That was neat! Previous reviewers have complained about the packaging of the discs. While I don't like it,(It's awkward to remove them)if handled with care, I don't think any damage will occur. I was very disappointed to discover that some(if not all) of the episodes are edited. I suspected as much when watching a first season episode. It appeared as if an important scene may have been omitted. After close examination of the very fine print on the box's exterior, my suspicions were confirmed. It's interesting to see how the popularity of the ""Batman"" series influenced some of the episodes in the second season. The criminals were very colorful'comic-book' types.  Overall, this is a great box set for a very good price.",1231718400,3,2292,4.5048076923076925

3517163,5,B001CQONOA,"Has there ever been a series that has been cancelled for the very same reason it remained a top-rated show? That's exactly what happened to ""The Wild Wild West"", as CBS bowed to pressure over the violence of the series...but when you watch ""The Wild Wild West: The Complete Series"", you may be surprised; the violence is as tongue-in-cheek as the plotlines, humor, and characterizations, and this is a series I'd certainly have no qualms letting kids see. Truthfully, the show is terrific!

Blending a 19th century setting with 20th century technology was not a new idea (film adaptations of Jules Verne and H.G. Wells have been doing it, for years), but series creator Michael Garrison hit upon a winning mix, by combining the long-popular Western genre with the spy craze, and adding an occasional dash of science fiction to spice things up. With just the right balance of action and humor (qualities other spy shows had trouble maintaining), and two stars with perfect chemistry (hunky Robert Conrad and urbane Ross Martin), ""The Wild Wild West"", even in weaker episodes, had consistently more adventure and entertainment value than any other series of it's time.

There are several real pleasures in owning this collection...Of course, the episodes are great fun, with each season special, in it's own way, from the atmospheric B&W plotlines of Season One (introducing the charmingly evil Dr. Miguelito Loveless, as personified by Michael Dunn), to Season Two's cliff-hanging color climaxes, to Season Three's more traditional approach (with Jim West's amazing horse highlighted, and the previously stoic agent occasionally breaking into laughter!), to Season Four's broader storylines (and temporary disappearance of Martin, after suffering a heart attack), before budget constraints forced the final episodes to occasionally rely on inserting action scenes from earlier seasons (considering how many series frequently air 'flashback' episodes to save money, it is remarkable that in four seasons of ""The Wild Wild West"", this is the only time any previous footage was ever used). Another pleasure is the opportunity to view both of the TV-Movie reunions, from 1979 and 1980 (and marvel at how little Conrad and Martin had aged!) While I wish Seasons Two through Four had the Robert Conrad introductions and other extra features the Season One episodes have, it's a minor quibble, as the collection does provide so much. You even get to see Conrad, Martin, and stunt man Red West on a daytime talk show from the late seventies, the infamous Conrad battery commercial (""Knock it off, I dare you!""), and to hear his own thoughts on the Will Smith movie version of the series.

I really can't say enough about how much pleasure ""The Wild Wild West: The Complete Series"" has provided...I find I love the series more today, than when it first aired, over forty years ago!

3517186,1,B001CQONOA,I have been a fan of this show for years.  I too bought each season as it came out.  Three weeks ago I purchased the box set because I wanted the movies.  Unfortunatly my set was very deffective.  The very first disc would only play for the first 20 minutes and then stopped. Upon checking the rest of the disc's I found all but 2 had mild to moderate scratching.  The packaging is terrible.  I had to return my set.,1228089600,132,416,4.1375
3517187,5,B001CQONOA,"Love this show. The episodes are remastered to perfection and have little artifacts. The color seasons are bright and vibrant. Yes the paper sleeve packaging will cause some light scratching but I suggest that you put the discs in better packaging. I usually don't buy discs in paper sleeves but this set had the movies so I had to get it.

For those complaining about the fact that they were duped out of the tv movies. You really need to stop complaining. I also bought the single sets in case the complete series wasn't released. After I found out they were released from reading it here, i immediately sold my season sets for half price on EBAY. I got enough to rebuy the complete series for under  $69 at another retailer.(they have a 25% off sale going on right now)",1226534400,,772,4.507142857142857
3517188,3,B001CQONOA,"""The Wild Wild West"" was a terrific show. CBS/Paramount has released the series in this entire season format. The show looks extremely good and the extras (only on season one except for the ""bonus disc"" but we'll get to that in a moment)are good as well. The big issue is the packaging. The box is certainly attractive look but it's basically the size of a board game box. When you open the inside the 27 discs are split into seasons 1 & 2 and 3 & 4 in what appears to be 2 cardboard ""saddle bags"" where they slide into it and are held in place with tiny cardboard inserts. The discs could be pretty easily scratched in this cheap packaging. Whoever designed this should be sent back to design 101--it's clever IF the quality of the materials were good but they're not--and it is a pain if you want to store this with some of your other DVD season sets. The saddle bags are sunk into a plastic older again making it look a bit like a board game (which is perhaps the purpose). There is a strip reprsenting the pix from the opening along the top. There is also a booklet that notes what episodes are on each disc.

The ""bonus"" disc has the two TV movies which should have been included as an extra on the fourth season box set (but was withheld so fans would have to double dip to get the two TV movies). Although the box claims they have been digitally restored, they look like simply transfers and while they don't necessarily look bad, they could have used the clean up given to the season sets. There are lots of white streaks and splotches that appear on the first TV movie and the openining 10 or 15 minutes for the 1980 sequel looks WORSE with the image a bit muddy and image quality darker than the 1979 TV movie. I was never a huge fan of the TV movies as they are more in line with ""Support Your Local Sheriff"" the movie starring James Garner. That's because both TV movies were written and directed by the same team who did that movie and ""Support Your Local Gunfighter"". It's nice to see both Robert Conrad and Ross Martin in their roles again but both movies while they have the humor that was characteristic of the series, certainly lack something. The producers must have gotten a bargain on stock footage for nuclear bombs exploding as it appears several times in both TV movies.

The first TV movie ""The Wild Wild West Revisited"" features Dr. Loveless' son (played by Paul Williams)planning to take over the world with replicas of the leaders of every major nation in the world. Both West and Gordon are called back retirement to prevent Loveless from using an atomic bomb (or something similar)that he has created planeted in the major nations of each country where he has replaced the leaders.

The second TV movie ""More Wild Wild West"" features the duo pulled out of retirement again to prevent Albert Paradine II (Jonathan Winters) from using his invisibility device from taking over the world.

Both films have nice supporting casts, some clever gags and nice interplay between Conrad and Martin but are a bit uninspired failing to capture the flavor of the original series at all.

I think it stinks that CBS/Paramount chose to release the TV movies only in the ""The Complete Series"" as they rightfully should have been included as part of the second, third or fourth season sets as an extra there. Regardless, my advice is to burn a copy when you're watching it on TV vs. ponying up additional cash for a package that while it looks nice isn't very sturdy.

If you haven't purchaed the other season sets this is an affordable one stop shop but the box itself is cumbersome and the materials a bit shoddy in my opinion (although it looks quite nice).",1226361600,296,3672,4.506006006006006
3517189,3,B001CQONOA,"I do not like gimmicky packaging - especially when it is prone to damage the discs. This complete set comes in a rather large box - 11"" x 8"" x 2 "". The box itself is pretty heavy duty - reminds me a bit of the candy boxes people like to give. The top of the box has a bit of foam attached to the underside to cushion the contents. The bottom part of the box has a form fitted plastic insert that is frocked with sort of a fake velvet. There are two cavities, holding cardboard sleeves shaped to look either like gun holsters or saddle bags (kind of hard to tell which). There is also a strip of cardboard attached to the plastic insert - printed with the iconic end-of-scene graphics from the show. What disappoints me the most about this set, is the fact that the DVD discs are stacked in these holsters and are only inserted in cardboard sleeve half the size of the actual disc. I randomly pulled out a half-dozen of the discs and a couple of them had visible wear marks from the cardboard. Putting the discs back into their individual slots was somewhat challenging too. It sort of reminds me of the odd packaging that the first & second series of ""Sliders"" came in. I know a bunch of people complained about the use of friction to hold the discs in place and how it tended to scratch the DVDs. I think the same will happen here too. As soon as I can, I will be buying some slim dual disc DVD cases and transferring this set to them.

I don't know why these gimmick packaging are made - I recently bought the complete box set for the ""Angel"" series - which was 40 discs. That came in a great package - a cube (5 "" x 5 "" x 6"") which fits on the shelf next to my regular DVD cases. Each season is in its own ""book"" with each disc safely in its own tray.

I will save on shipping cost as well. and the companys that pull this crap will start feeling it in their pockets, and then and only then will they stop treating their customers like we are fools.",1225065600,,560,4.2924528301886795

They are like old friends come to call.  I watch these old DVD's and its as if I can smell the TV dinners in that foil container a treat from our youth.  Watching these old DVD's is as much about a journey back to the most pleasant aspects of our childhoods.

How vulgar and foul that the studio in question yanks us all back to the evil nasty cheat mongering anything for a buck mentality of 2008 by not putting the final season and reunion movies on DVD as a season set.  I refuse to be manipulated by stupid greedy business men who do any reprobate thing possible if their is the faintest scent of a ill gotten dollar to be had.

Buying the complete series tempting as it is would be rewarding the studio for the worse possible betrayals of a loyal customer base.  Short sighted decisions have a way of destroying customer good will and when the customers start assuming series sets are being offered that will never be completed they will rot on the shelves.  The Studio can gloat over this Gottcha because they got me.  However my entertainment dollar is a mercenary owing alliegence to no one.  I love old TV series but I by no means need them.  When I am cheated I go elsewhere and my entertainment money goes with me.

I will not reward a studio for betraying fans loyal to its old shows hence I will not buy the complete set of the Wild Wild West and hope you refrian from doing so as well.  Individual season sets offered by this studio are worthless now in my opinion do not waste your money buying them.",1224979200,12,1674,4.303514376996805

So now a better package and price comes out, which isn't a surprise. But it takes nothing away from the fact that this is the best and most complete WWW package out there and should be owned by anyone who loves the series as much as me. Ratings shouldn't be about marketing so disregard the 1 stars. I should have given this 5 stars. My apologies for lowering it a couple due to marketing when I first submitted this review.
I like everyone else who buys the WWW series has done so with anticipation of each series release. I bought the first 3 sets the 1st day or at least week they went on sale. Until I realized that patience can sometimes be rewarded. I watched on Amazon as the prices fluctuated and were cheaper at times for the same thing. So I waited on the 4th season and saved $14. Now the box set comes out and it's a better deal. Not unusual in marketing. I have to agree that offering the individual later released movies is necessary though for us loyal people who bought the sets as soon as they came out. We're the only ones interested in the later released movies in the first place. And we'll buy them day one just like we did the sets. This big box set won't do as well since all of us bought the seasons already and are not foolish enough to spend $90 on the box set to get what we already have plus the ""more WWW"" movies which are rated poorly anyway. We still would love to have these movies if reasonably priced. But I think I can say with confidance that most of us are in our 40's and 50's, regular guys and not really interested in being toyed with. We're too old and been there before. Make the WWW movies available at an honest price and we'll buy them. As for me, I'll wait a year and these movies will be released individually.
