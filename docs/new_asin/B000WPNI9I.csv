8225111,4,B000WPNI9I,"This is an organized comedy night by an Italian Radio Disk Jockey, Goumba Johnny who hosts five various comedians that do very funny standup.
Tony Daro, Mario Cantone, Vic diBitetto, and two more whose names I can't remember, all take the stage for a memorable night.
Some adult jokes, much more ethnic jokes poked at Italians and NY'ers.
