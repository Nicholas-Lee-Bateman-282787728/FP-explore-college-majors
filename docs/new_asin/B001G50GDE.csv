The ruggedly handsome Stuart Whitman was also very good. The fact that it was a Hammer film was a little surprising. I hope you will give Mr. Shatter a try.",1493856000,,305,4.446428571428571
8303841,5,B001G50GDE,"It was a good cast,and the movie was very entertaining. It also fun to hear Ti Lung speaking english. In the shaw brothers movies that Ive seen him in, his voice is dubbed in with a voice you pretty much know isn't his. But that dubbing was pretty good. Shatter is filmed on location in Hong Kong;this movie moved at a good pace;the was pretty good :and the action was mostly satisfying. Stewart Witman is also known for working with John Wayne and did a western tv series called Cimaron ridge. Ti Lung is known for doing alot of shawbrothers martial arts films. Id like to have seen him in one where they showcase his Wing Chun skills.",1473120000,,636,4.398305084745763
