8727390,2,B013EXPKGI,"The English title for this film in ""Blood Redd"" which doesn't let you know it is a werewolf film, but written by punsters who were as talented as the ""Joan of Arcadia"" crowd. My apologies to the individual who watched the TV series.

The film opens with a werewolf scene and we are discover that young girls are being found with their crotch chewed out. The police investigator (Michael Teh) believes the girls are being raped and large dogs are being used to hide the evidence while the pathologist (Christopher Frainza) believes the community may be annoyed by a werewolf issue.

The film really centers on Lauren Redd (Stephanie Hullar) hence the oh-so-clever English title. She visits her grandmother (Peggy Ivene) and in one scene is wearing what looks like a red cloak. Albert (Torey Widener) is grandmother's care taker who is clearly not what he seems.

I really did like the plot idea, including the way they handled the twist (sorry I mentioned it.) However, the low budget aspect killed the film. The sound wasn't good. The special effects, which we see at the end, were abysmally bad. The sound track which started out fine during the opening credits feel into a tired piano. The acting was below ""B"" film standard with the dialogue not helping.

Guide: The film was made in English. I caught 1 F-bomb. No sex or nudity. Stephanie Hullar gives us a little tease.",1449878400,,1374,4.7364016736401675
