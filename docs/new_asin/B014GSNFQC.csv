8730724,5,B014GSNFQC,"The review is based off the assumption that the viewer has seen the original twenty-four episodes Fate Stay Night anime beforehand.
The first thirteen episodes of Fate Stay Night Unlimited Blade Works are on three discs. The show starts on episode 00 as sort of prelude via Rin Tohsakas point of view to the first actual episode. It is dubbed in English as its standard setting. All basic skip points for a DVD are present so the opening and end credits are skippable. There are no advertisements outside of the Japanese/American warning screens of copyrights at the very beginning. There is a good deal of improvement to the visuals with better usage to CGI and camera angles. The fighting scenes have also benefitted and have become far more stimulating.
This is a retelling on the Fate Stay Night anime with the same characters vying for the Holy Grail in generally the same flow of events. The voice actress Mela Lee is thankfully reprising her role as Rin Tohsaka, who continues to bring the character to life with a charming flare. The bulk of other voiced over characters will differ from their predecessors, but fill the role just as well.
Characters such as Tohsaka are getting more of the limelight and Saber is getting more of a back burner role, at least regards to their interactions towards main protagonist Shirou Emiya. Events play out from the original incarnation almost entirely different while other parts have nearly the exact same dialog. Whether that is a positive or negative will depend entirely on the viewers. In any case, by the end of last episode to this set the story will differ far the original tale. It is both entertaining and well thought out in this latest version. A recommended buy for fans and new viewers alike to the franchise who will have to go and buy the second set to complete the story that was left on quite the cliffhanger.",1480118400,,1873,4.730886850152905
