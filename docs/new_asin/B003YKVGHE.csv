4230946,5,B003YKVGHE,"I saw this video with my little one, and was amazed by the new facts I didn't know about history and development of animal domestication. I would recommend this video to any child 3-6 year old.",1367452800,,193,4.388888888888889
4230947,3,B003YKVGHE,"I was a little let down with this  because it was clear that they use the same shots from various zoos over and over.  Also the information overlaps a lot. With that said, my 6 year old has enjoyed watching it though I think she will outgrow it quickly.",1366243200,3,253,4.142857142857143
4230948,3,B003YKVGHE,"I bought this for my one year old, knowing that it was not made for kids quite his age. He loves any video with animals, and I assumed he would understand it more the older he grew. The vocabulary is rediculous. So much so, that even adults would think it was too much. It's almost as if they go out of their way to make it more difficult to understand. I really like that they made it educational, but in my opinion, it's overkill.",1353196800,5,432,4.154761904761905
4230949,5,B003YKVGHE,"I wasn't sure if this would be too old for my son and as I watched it with him, I was concerned there was too much narration.  He was about 18-20 mos old when I bought it.  He really enjoyed it though.  He loves seeing the animals and even though he probably doesn't understand when it teaches about the difference between domesticated and tamed animals.  I have been really happy with this purchase.",1345766400,5,400,4.438356164383562
4230950,5,B003YKVGHE,My 5-year old granddaughter wants to watch this DVD over and over.  The video is colorful and delightful.  Informative and educational as well.,1345334400,,143,5.173913043478261
4230951,5,B003YKVGHE,"This DVD along with the other Animal Atlas DVD's in the series are wonderful! Very educational, stimulating and thought-provoking. The narrator uses rich language which helps to build vocabulary among young ones. I have a 2 year old boy who doesn't like cartoons (which is fine by me) but loves these non-fiction DVD's. I really enjoy watching them with him as well. The Animal ABC's & Animal 123's DVD's have really helped reinforce his letter recognition skills along with counting. These would be great for preschool aged children as well.",1344816000,11,542,5.033333333333333
4230952,5,B003YKVGHE,My daughter lves these movies and keep her entertained as well as learning new things. I would recommend these movies!,1328400000,2,118,4.95
4230953,5,B003YKVGHE,"My kids and I love this DVD--as we love ALL of the Animal Atlas titles. The show is so much fun and it makes learning about animals a total joy. Forget the NATGEO/DISCOVERY videos that are heavy handed and so serious. My kids tune those out. But Animal Atlas keeps the fun going and there is much more wildlife information in Animal Atlas anyway. Fun on the Farm shows what life on a farm is like, where farm animals come from (your kids will be surprised), and what the difference is between a wild animal and a farm animal.
I also recommend these Animal Atlas titles--worth collecting. This is fun and enriching television:

4230954,4,B003YKVGHE,"My son (2) loves this movie! He is animal crazy. He especially loves horses. I was so glad I found this movie. Great price too! I will say the guys voice is a little weird/annoying but I can look over that. Lots of animal facts. Even I have learned some new things. It has three episodes; Down On The Farm, Barnyard Friends and The Horse, Of Course",1408233600,,348,4.208955223880597
4230955,5,B003YKVGHE,"Excellent video series. LOTS and lots of nice animal footage for my 2 1/2 year old grandaughter, yet plenty of interesting information to make it educational for children who are older. I'm very pleased with this purchase.",1402876800,,222,5.027027027027027

4230957,5,B003YKVGHE,Great! Very informative and teaches kids the importance of animals. Kids get a healthy view of how some animals are pets and some are bread for meat.,1395360000,,149,4.555555555555555
4230958,5,B003YKVGHE,"My son watches Animal Atlas every single day, and they remain as popular as they were when first purchased a year ago.  The Farm one in particular is his favorite, he just loves the horses and cows and all the other familiar farm creatures.

We own all of the DVDs in the series.  The formula is simple but very effective - great footage of fun wild animals, paired with smart narration and facts about the animals.  Most of the footage is from zoos, farms, animal parks and aquariums rather than the wild, but that doesn't distract from the animals.  The adults enjoy watching them too - even after many, many viewings we still pick up some new facts from time to time.  There are trivia questions sprinkled throughout - my son's attention tends to wander during those moments, but they only last about 30 seconds and then it's back to the animal footage.  His favorite part is the short ""blooper reel"" of funny animal behaviors at the end of each episode.

Our son inevitably asks for his ""mals"" at least once a day - this video series has been a lifesaver, and he's learned lots of animals.  He ""talks"" to the animals and dances along with the parrots and pounds his chest with the gorillas, so it's a pretty interactive experience for him and we feel better having him watch and participate with these vs. just sitting passively like we've seen with some other videos.  I can't recommend these enough and only wish they had more episodes available on DVD!",1391385600,,1459,4.576923076923077

4230960,3,B003YKVGHE,I purchased this for my toddler daycare class.  It was a DVD that they just didn't enjoy.  It wasn't at all what i expected.,1372032000,,124,4.125

8409599,2,B003YKVGHE,"Purchased for our son who just turned 2, and has a mild obsession with ""The Adventures of Milo & Otis"".  We thought this might provide a diversion as well as some educational material, but he was completely disinterested.  There is no music and no interaction, as with the Animal ABCs video, which he really enjoys; it seems to be aimed at older preschoolers, perhaps a junior version of National Geographic.  It got traded in at Bookman's after the third failed attempt at viewing.",1421020800,,482,4.783132530120482
