740089,5,630394518X,"Ever had a dream where you feel like you're falling? That inescapable feeling of knowing that you're going to hit the ground eventually, but you can't stop it?
Seven feels like this. You are caught in an inescapable  trap, you cannot escape, you cannot avoid the inevetible. From the opening  to the end, you want the murderer to be caught, you want him to be killed.  Yet, this is not failure for the killer. This is sucess.
How do you win  in the situation? You can't. Whatever you do, you must fight your instincts  to prove the killer wrong, but you cannot. It is with a heavy heart that I  condemn the killer to his own glory...
Pitt proves once and for all that  he can act. It would have been so easy for a lesser actor to walk this  action orientated role, to look clean and prissy. Pitt captures the mood  and perfectly displays what must be considered to be the most disturbing  decision anyone can make.
Freeman adds to the screen as wisdom does. He  cannot act freely, and must allow youth to take the lead. Thereby, his  answers, however correct, are not always implemented.
That's a hell of a  read, isn't it? Watch Seven. You'll remember it for a long time. buy it and  you can re-live the pure suffocation that it induces. Just don't show it to  your kids.",926553600,,1272,4.399141630901288
740090,5,630394518X,"David Fincher hits the nail on the head with this one. The tension does not let up, and just builds on and on, slowing down to an almost unbearable climax.
Fincher is evidently a skilled director, and he is lucky to work  with skilled actors as Morgan Freeman, Brad Pitt and Kevin Spacey who is  terrific in his role, giving Anthony Hopkins' Hannibal Lecter a run for the  money. Gwyneth Paltrow is in this too, as Pitt's wife, but her role is a  discreet one. One could say she adds the air of feminine beauty and grace  to the movie, a pleasant change to a constant tension  build-up.
Congratulations must also go to Howard Shore with his beautiful  and exquisite music, perfect for this movie, even when the credits show up  the tense atmosphere is still somewhat hanging around densely, because it's  David Bowie with his strange ""The Heart's Filthy Lesson"".

740162,5,630394518X,"Seven is one of those movies that looks spooky and creepy and like you've got to see it, when you see the trailers for it - but then you just know when you actually see it that it's going to be disappointing.
This one isn't.
""Seven"" is an awesome film - but not one for the squeamish.
Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt are paired together in what is ostensibly a tour de force for both of them.
Freeman is a cop a week away from retirement.  Transferring in from a cushy precinct is detective Brad Pitt.  He wants to experience police work in the gritty city.  He gets his wish - and how!
Pitt's first day in the new precinct sees the discovery of the first murder in a serial killer's sick mind.  Freeman wants out, because he knows that the killings are going to continue and he wants to retire on time.  Pitt wants to go for the gusto.
Ultimately they work together to solve the murders, each more gruesome than the last.  While the murders are truly horrific, David Fincher really doesn't show us everything that he could, though he does show us a lot.  Our minds simply fill in the gaps and it's enough to make you reel from the thoughts.
Fincher piles on the symbolism in this film.  Red is used to symbolize death and each time we see it we know someone is going to die or has just died.  It rains constantly throughout the film, exemplifying the confusion and horror of the case.  Sunlight is revealed at the ending of the film when we and the detectives are to be enlightened to the killer and his motives.
Whether it was the actor or the producers who made the following decision, it was a stupendously wise one:  the actor portraying the killer is not listed among the opening credits.  Too often filmmakers make the mistake of revealing the name of the actor or the face of a well known actor portraying a killer in a film, only to have that action allow the audience to ""know"" who the killer is from the beginning of a good mystery (such was the case in the film ""Copy Cat"" - which owe's its box office to ""Seven"" incidentally).
Seven is David Fincher's finest film to date.  Although he made films before and has made films since, he hasn't been able to get the same lightning in the bottle that he did with ""Seven"".
You really must see this horrifying thriller to believe it!  But whatever you do, don't watch it for the first time while you are alone at night - you won't be able to sleep for days!",1047340800,5,2409,4.312638580931264
740163,1,630394518X,Although the actors are good actors  - not in this movie. This movie doesn't work. It starts to have a plot and then rushes ahead to the ending which is simply horrible.  We don't get to know the killer  - he just gets the luxury of doing his thing.  Really poorly directed. I'm not kidding about the way it ends.,1024444800,9,313,4.166666666666667
740164,5,630394518X,"This is a review of the video version of Seven.
This movie stars Brad Pitt as a brash young detective partnered with Morgan Freeman's character, a cerebral, experienced detective, as they try to catch a serial killer who murders people according to themes derived from the seven deadly sins (gluttony, greed, sloth, lust, pride, envy and wrath). What might have been merely a clever idea becomes not only a stylish and exciting thriller, but also a challenging work of philosophy.
I don't want to give anything away in this review. (Several other reviews here tell you which actor plays the serial killer. I didn't know when I saw it, and I thought it was a great surprise, so I won't mention his name.) But I would like to comment on some of the surprisingly deep things director David Fincher does in this movie.
The framework of the Seven Deadly Sins is more than just a throw-away. The people who are killed really are, by almost anybody's standards, unlikable people. This leads into the deeper question the movie raises about the value of human existence. Why is humanity worth fighting for? Morgan Freeman's character, a brilliant detective, is about to take early retirement precisely because he seems to have decided that, after years of fighting the good fight, the human race just isn't worth the effort.
He is challenged by his new partner. Brad Pitt's character has a seemingly indestructible passion for trying to rid the world of evil. Pitt's and Freeman's character's represent two sides of the human soul. Freeman is pure intellect. Pitt is all passion. (I don't know whether Fincher intended this, but the contrast between the two officers is like the contrast between the rational and the non-rational parts of the soul in Aristotle.)
The movie uses various visual devices to suggest the contrast. One shot shows Freeman and Pitt on opposite sides of a wall. We also see Freeman in his meticulous apartment, all by himself, but later see Pitt in the messy apartment he shares with his loving wife (played very nicely by Gwynneth Paltrow). According to Aristotle, the intellectual and passionate aspects of the soul must work in harmony for either to develop its full potential. In the movie, Pitt and Freeman gradually learn to work together, as is suggested by a scene near the end where they make pleasant banter while gearing up for what they hope will be the operation that closes the case.
Intellectual movies can be ponderous, but this one is not. Even if you couldn't care less about the philosophical underpinnings of the movie, you'll enjoy its quick pace and tightening sense of terror. There is a chase scene near the middle of the movie that will have you sweating, and the tension really ratchets up during the climax of the movie. You know something bad will happen, but you're not sure what it will be.
Well, that's not 100% true. One minor weakness of this movie is that, about 15 or 20 minutes from the end, I had a pretty good guess what kind of thing was going to happen. However, I also knew that one of the characters would have to make a key existential choice, and there was a lot of tension waiting to see what he would do.
So for both intellectual challenge and sheer fun, I recommend Seven.",1024444800,7,3235,4.73758865248227
740165,5,630394518X,"God I love this movie! This is one of the most suspensful movies. I can't say enough about how unbelievably brilliant it is. I absolutely adore Morgan Freeman, especially in this movie. His name was written all over the character when the script was written. No one else would have even come close to his performance, and Brad Pitt pairs with him perfectly for the part as his partner. And of course we can't forget about Kevin Spacey. Wow! This movie gives me goosebumps it's so good! The ending just blows you away. One of the best movies ever! Extremely suspenseful! You will love it!",1017014400,,587,4.6

740167,5,630394518X,I remember seeing seven in san antonio texas in 1995 and remebering how great of a movie it was then. I have seen the movie several times now and it really doesn't lose it affect. Seven is still a strong movies with some great acting from Morgan Freeman.,1012608000,,254,4.3125
740168,2,630394518X,"Morgan Freeman is the seasoned homicide detective and Brad Pitt his green and eager partner, a fresh trainee who thinks rules only exist to hamper good cops in ""Se7en"". The title refers to the deadly sins which collectively inspire some horrible serial killer to perpetrate particularly gory murders (one man is overfed to death, another is kept in bed with his limbs and tongue removed, still another is forced to perform an act of unspeakable sexual violation). There isn't much of a story here, mostly because director David Fincher spends most of his time on the visuals - the setting is some barely identifiable city where the weather is perpetually horrible (it's always raining, like in Blade Runner), and everybody looks like they deserve some kind of divine retribution. Unfortunately, the visuals not only take attention from the story, they make it almost impossible to understand what the story really is. (Just like in Fincher's ""Alien3"", only that film did sustain a fair amount of suspense for the first half hour). The characters aren't well developed - with Freeman playing his worldly wise self, Pitt as the young hotwire slated to replace him, and Kevin Spacey as the object of their hunt. Besides the stars, everybody else seems to exist in some form only slightly more substantial than the fog that engulfs the city. When the killer turns himself in (you didn't think a script this thin allowed for some real detective work, did you?) the lack of character definition is clear. Who is the killer and how has his hunt been brought to end - are questions that you not only can't answer after finishing this movie, but you are sapped for any reason to even care. The film ends on a major cop out. I can't believe somebody thought that the cooler thrills of ""Silence of the Lambs"" were any way touched by this film.",1007078400,7,1832,4.782334384858044

740170,5,630394518X,"Se7en is already a classic in the thriller genre. The story about a serial killer punishing his victims for their sinful living by killing them in a most gruesome manner. Old detective Summerset(Freeman) is put on the case with his new partner(Pitt), the movie is full of suspense from the first moment, the clues, the investigation and the two detectives private conversations. They are opposites. Pitt the idealistic young detective, that want to conquer the world, and Freeman the tired old man, that see that it makes no difference and you cannot change the world(even though he might learn something in the end). Gwyneth Paltrow plays Pitts beautiful wife, and she is great even though she does not appear alot. The showdown is one of the best and most suspenseful I have seen in a long time.
The movie is grim and dark. There are no strong colors and the light is always gritty, which helps to create the atmosphere of the movie. A great movie, great acting, great directing. Watch it!",1004832000,2,991,4.767441860465116
740171,5,630394518X,"With an interesting plot and excellent acting, Seven deserves the full five stars.  Kevin Spacey plays a killer who commits his crimes to reflect the seven deadly sins (lust, gluttony, vanity, etc.).  Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt are the detectives assigned to the case.  The way Spacey's character murders his victims is gruesome, however, what I thought was clever about the film was how the horrible details of the crimes are implied and not shown graphically (which helps those of us who can't stand gorey scenes.)  Don't expect a happy ending, however, do expect a thought-provoking one.",1002585600,,592,5.072164948453608
740251,5,630394518X,"In a virtual quagmire of cliched, poorly written serial killer films, SEVEN belongs in a small, select group of ones that worked. It represents the successful culmination of writing, acting, cinematograhpy and direction. The result is a profoundly disturbing and, at times, surreal film.
Based upon a frighteningly intelligent premise, SEVEN begins rather mondanely. We are introduced to a horrific murder, and a pair of surprisingly cliched detectives. Luckily for us however, Freeman and Pitt are in fine form, and add as much dimension to Somerset and Mills as the script allows.
And it is clear from the outset, that the world they inhabit is cold, dark, and almost perpetually wet. Indeed, the set direction is astounding; the city becomes another character, with filth and decay all but jumping out of the screen. Dark and almost exceedingly moody, the cinematography does an excellent job of establishing a world which bears witness to numerous atrocities, which form the basis of the film.
And it is this latter point which once again emphasizes the nature of this film. Thankfully, Fincher and company have spared us much of the explicit gore, and left us with aftermath shrouded in gloom and shadow.
As mentioned, the acting was above par on all accounts. However, special mention must go to Spacey for his haunting and restained performance as John Doe. Pay special attention during the conversation between Mills and Doe.
However, ultimate kudos goes to Kevin Andrew Walker for his uncommonely intelligent script, which actually succeeds in profundity, without sounding didactic.
Pulling it all together is David Fincher, who, with just a few films, has [justifiably] made a name for himself. For those who haven't, take time to view his following films.
However, despite all the accolades, SEVEN remains one of the most disturbing stories ever set to film. It's conclusion, [which becomes more and more inevitable] leaves one with a foreboding feeling, and a little less hope for the human race.
That said, one must remember that it is a film, and a very good one at that. For those looking for a brainy thiller, look no further.",993600000,,2142,5.070821529745042
740252,5,630394518X,"This extremely intense movie depicts the dementia and fanatism, and how both of them endanger life.  Brad Pitt delivered another great performance along with the great Morgan Freeman.

740253,3,630394518X,"SE7EN is a very power film that relies on the shock of its chilling ending to divert the moviegoer from the gaping hole in the climax.  We know from the Sloth victim that John Doe has been planning this crime for over a year.  Yet we are to believe that he put all this in motion without having planned out the Envy and Wrath victims?  Certainly Doe could not foresee Mills' transfer and move.  Certainly he could not foresee that the detective assigned to his case would have a pretty young wife capable of making him feel envy.  The ending is contrived and unbelievable.  Sadly, this contrivance is there simply to make room for cliches... the retiring detective facing the case that changes his mind... the green upstart unwilling to admit his lack of omniscience... and the necessary convention of having the case become personal.  This necessity could have been achieved through better screenwriting while still avoiding cliches and plot holes.  The movie is powerful enough to distract most from the error, but reliance on shock over story is lazy.  There is no way that John Doe didn't have the entire design planned out well in advance... and no way he could have planned it around Mills in the story's current structure.",984182400,5,1229,4.759433962264151
740254,5,630394518X,"I've seen a lot of catch-the-serial-killer films, but this one is by far the most original.  ""Silence of the Lambs"" is a smart and creepy flick, but in my opinion ""Seven"" is even better.  Brad Pitt is good as the ambitious but combustible cop looking to make a name for himself.  Morgan Freeman embodies cynicism with his quiet portrayal of a detective who has seen too much.  I love him in this movie.  Paltrow and Spacey are also very effective in supporting roles.
The star of the film is the city itself, however.  Whether the scene is in a dimly-lit kitchen, a rainy alleyway, or a neon-laced whorehouse, director David Fincher's vision of New York City as a vast, overcast wasteland populated by jaded, immoral citizens is overwhelming.  I've been to NYC and rationally, I know it's not a complete hellhole, but I don't think I could ever live there after seeing ""Seven"".  It's great to see a movie in this genre with a theme besides ""serial killer are evil""; the message that a big city either hardens people or hones them to a jagged edge is deftly displayed throughout the movie.
""Seven"" contains many original touches as well.  The opening credits are justifiably famous; they flash over a montage of photographs depicting the details of heinous acts, with violent thrash music (by Nine Inch Nails, I believe) playing in the background.  The movie embraces some serial-killer cliches (the murders all follow a strict theme), but transcends others (the murderer is not an evil genius undone by his pride).  This movie might also contain the only instance in entertainment history where a character is rewarded for using Cliff Notes.
Chilling, intelligent, and suspenseful without being overly dramatic; I can't imagine a better movie in the serial-killer genre than ""Seven"".",981676800,4,1783,4.929765886287625
740255,4,630394518X,"Seven is supported by its solid cast, especially Kevin Spacey and Morgan Freeman---who I find to be a few notches above, for example, Denzel Washington in The Bone Collector.  Tracking a serial killer with a peculiar religious motivation, Freeman and Brad Pitt have a nuanced relationship (one could probably find homoeroticism in it) as investigative partners, and each murder is a setpiece in cruelty and methodical retribution.  I also appreciated the film's willingness to question the morality of punishment, indeed some of the killings seem in some ways to be hardly  malicious at all.
The only reason I don't give it five stars is the last scene, which admittedly could be a lot worse.  But there is a notable lapse in the movie's tone and a twist which I could see coming a few minutes before it happened.  Nonetheless, there is a nice psychological reversal which one rarely sees in today's crime films.",981331200,,912,4.934640522875817

740257,5,630394518X,"'Seven' is one of the most disturbing thrillers I've had the pleasure (or displeasure?) to watch.  It is a brilliant film, well directed, acted and photographed.  The ending is one of the most frightening and disturbing pieces of film-making in recent thriller history.
When watching this film, though, take in some of the other amazing things:  the performance of the always-dependable Morgan Freeman.  Freeman has been overlooked numerous times by the Oscar folk, and sadly so.  He is outstanding in this role, and commands most of the movie away from his stellar cast-mates.
Look at the performance of Brad Pitt, the ""hunk"" who can really act, when given the opportunity to do so.  Relish in the superior acting of two future Oscar winners--Gwyneth Paltrow and the amazing Kevin Spacey.  Neither is given much screen time, but they both are incredible in their brief appearances.  Spacey is out and out terrifying as the serial killer.  Paltrow has a very beautiful scene with Freeman in which she laments her new life in the city.  This movie firmly convinces me that New York City is not the place for anyone in their right mind to live. Few directors have captured the seamy side of NYC as well as David Flincher.

The plot in this movie is very original, and the ending is IMPOSSIBLE to figure out.  You think you have it figured out, but you do not until the very end.  My only problem is that it takes a second to figure out what the 7th sin commited at the end is, so if you missed the lecture on what the 7 sins are, study the box cover for a few minutes.",977443200,,522,3.942857142857143
740259,5,630394518X,"In the interest of full disclosure, let me tell you some things about myself:
I am a Brad Pitt fan.  I am a Morgan Freeman fan.  I am a David Fincher fan.  I am a fan of serial killer movies.
So we've perfected the recipe here, then.  All of those elements are at the top of their game.
Pitt is immature and kinetic, strong-willed and strong-headed.  He plays off Freeman perfectly.  Freeman, for his part, is quiet and thoughtful.  You can see just from his eyes that he is tired and spent, but feels that this one last case is important and necessary.  He does his duty.  He is a rock (to Pitt's roll?).  David Fincher is Fincher.  His style is just so addicting when he's working with a plausible (in context) script.  He gets to build an anonymous city, making it dreadful and sickening, and run his characters through its mill.  Everything is dark and wet, never letting you take a breath.  Gwyneth Paltrow, in two brief scenes, is quite sweet and touching, exhibiting both humour (with Pitt) and torment (with Freeman).  I usually can do without her, but here she is a welcome relief from all the bleakness.  And of course one of my favourite actors plays the killer, with shaved-head intensity.  It's a great secret that - even though it's already out of the bag - I won't tell.
...yecapS niveK s'tI
Top to bottom, this is a great movie.  From the first seconds of the first scene, through the opening credits (they look like a Nine Inch Nails video), to the last moments of the closing credits, it's just great.  Every scene is pulled off perfectly; all the details are just right.  Morgan Freeman looking up Dante in the library; the killer's dank little apartment; Pitt and Freeman bonding over beers in a bar... all superbly done.  Of course, the best parts are the murder scene aftermaths, based on the seven deadly sins.  You never see any violence in these scenes, but what you do see is actually a bit more disturbing: gritty tableaus of human suffering.  Fincher's greatest choice is not showing us all that's going on, letting the mind of the viewer fill in most of the grisly details.  My favourite is the 'lust' sequence.  I didn't fully understand what had happened until I watched the movie a second time.  And now I can't get the imagery out of my head.  It works quite powerfully.
And the denouement is just staggering.  It's 15 minutes of slow build-up.  You hope that the payoff can live up to the suspense.  And they keep going.  And the suspense builds.  And you hope... and you hope... and you hope.... And the payoff is brilliant.  It perfectly sums up the films themes, and is a very satisfying narrative conclusion to a highly suspenseful mystery/thriller movie.  And my favourite part about the ending: after 2 hours of dirty, dark, and rainy, the film ends at high noon in an open field.  A great contrast, that.  Fincher really knows how to use imagery to make a point.",972518400,2,2903,4.558139534883721

So careful that right up until the last fourth of the movie, they're completely unsure of who it is.
So its pretty typical -- guy dies, they search the house, question some people, come just an eighth of an inch to getting the killer... but with a few exceptions. (Oh my God, the ""DEAD"" guy on bed! That scared me half to death.) The end was good. Not so much as typical. Just really good.

Pitt  could have been better (and less annoying), but Freeman turns in a great  performance, as always, with his purposeful, precise, well-cultured manner.

740314,5,630394518X,"We have all grown up with this idea of what a hero in a movie should be:  impulsive, idealistic, and young.  If you don't agree with me see how many  movies you can come up with where the hero is cautious, apathetic, and old.  In this movie we get both sets of characters in Detective Mills and  Somerset.  What makes this movie stand apart is that Fincher (the director)  has the guts to show the audience that being that steroetypcial hero might  not be all that its cracked up to be.
Another reason that its very  atypical is its views on violence.  When Somerset talks about society's  apathy towards crime its like he's talking to the audience.  The audience  itself is numb to the kind of violence he is talking about as they sit  there listening to his very lines. To them it is just one more of a  thousand films that has left them unfeeling.
What puts the movie a notch  up from others is how psychological it is.  The only person who understands  what Somerset is saying is the killer. The reason John Doe does what he  does is because he is fed up with society's lack of concern over these  sins.  What must be going on in Somerset's mind when he realizes the same  thing that is driving him into retirement is the same thing that causes the  killer to do the horrible things that he does?
Its apparent the theme of  the movie is society's apathy toward sin. The more important question is  what solution does it offer?  Its not John Doe's way.  It isn't Somerset's  thoughts of running away from it all either. At the end of the movie the  audience is left with the idea that Somerset knows he can't leave,  ""I'll be around"" he says,  and that he feels that the ""world  is worth fighting for.""  A little vague on the details as its the  closest we get to answer.

Arrogance never got such a cinematic comeuppance (not to mention gluttony, pride, greed and the rest of the seven deadly sins), nor was innocence ever made such an alien as in  this masterpiece of monstrous intent.  Morgan Freeman stars as William  Somerset, a wise and modest big city homicide detective ready to retire who  finds himself partnered with David Mills, an arrogant young detective  effortlessly depicted by Brad Pitt.  As they try to find the killer there  develops between them a nice chemistry that helps to make this an  engrossing movie.  Kevin Spacey arrives after a bit as ""John Doe,"" a 20th  century version of a medieval scribe obsessed with sin morphed into a  monster from hell.  He sees himself as the personal judge, executioner and  torturer extraordinaire of a vengeful god gone amuck.
Momma, lock the  doors and bar the windows.  Don't let this video into your home.  You'll  watch it, every last minute, and your kids will watch it, several times,  their eyes between their fingers, and the end result will be a cynicism  about humanity so deep that it'll take the blood of the lamb to wash it  clean.
Well, that, or the realization that this is just Hollywood up to  its old tricks.  After all it's only a movie-or is there something more to  this extraordinary commercialization of evil?  One of the penetrating  things about Seven is the implication that, through the Christian concept  of sin and by our very nature, we ourselves create the serial killer and  give him a justification to turn upon us and do his wretched deeds.  The  ending slyly suggests the triumph of evil; and indeed this cagey movie  would be depressing beyond redemption were it not for the three things:  One, the modest wisdom projected by Morgan Freeman; two, the essential  innocence of Brad Pitt's character; and three, the fact that the horrible  deeds are the work of only one man.  Whether he is just an insane ""nut-bag""  as Pitt's character exclaims, or part of our nature as the film implies, is  an interesting question.
Serial killer film makers of the future will try  to top this one, but I doubt if it will happen any time soon.  This is  already a classic.  Incidentally, I do wonder about these guys (Walker and  Fincher) who lie awake nights dreaming up this stuff.  I hope they're only  doing it for the money.

The old black detective goes along that line and tries to understand the religious and cultural  motivations of the killer and finds them in Chaucer, Dante, Milton, and the  killer's references to the Seven Deadly Sins. The young white detective  follows his instinct and feeling in front of facts and crime-scene  elements. That helps him find the essential clue that will bring the film  to its end. But, not understanding the motivation of the killer, he will  neglect some simple security measures concerning his wife, and will not  understand how the killer is trapping him little by little in the seventh  deadly sin, wrath. So he will fall in the trap. This film is entirely  symbolical, every detail having a deeper meaning if it is read in the line  of the religious and cultural references. The killer is a preacher who is  trying to preach to the world the necessary crusade to be undertaken  urgently if the world is to be saved. We have here a motivation that  associates religion, the desire to punish, the ambition to be God, and the  most reactionary ideology that considers that freedom in our world produces  sin and decay. The man is a fundamentalist who tries to go back to the  Middle Ages, when religion was fundamentalistic. He forgets one thing : the  books he quotes had a double meaning. They reflected this fundamentalistic  religion of the time, and they spoke with the authors' tongues in their  cheeks, becoming hence a subtle denunciation of that fundamentalism and a  call for a liberation of man's pirit and soul from this total alienation to  a belief that is nothing but a superstition. We must also understand that,  in the world, there are people who do think like that, and in some  countries which have such a fundamentalistic approach of religion they  commit all the crimes that go along with it, and of course all the  limitations of freedom and private life.

7856950,3,630394518X,"This was my first time seeing SEVEN.I know it was a hit when it was released years ago. I know that some wonderful actors starred in it. How has it aged?

1. There is little in SEVEN that held my interest. The story of a weary gumshoe and his hot-shot snot-nosed newbie partner is as old as the hills. One wants to retire and the other is shot-from-guns-ready to jump at anything. This story was done way before SEVEN and has continually been rehashed on every crime show that television offers.

2. The story is slow and the film weighs in at a tiresome 127 minutes. It takes three murders and a lot of setting up of the characters and their back-stories to come to the first really tense moment resulting in a chase of any kind. We must see the tableaux of gluttony,greed and sloth before we are treated to any action. Perhaps David Flincher wanted to set us up in the manner of methodical exactness that his killer was creating,but this made for tiresome,lets-move-this-thing along-while-staring-at-the-""counter"" on the vcr. A lot of material about the seven deadly sins are introduced and shot and not developed from sources such as Dante's ""Divine Comedy"",Chaucer's ""Canterbury Tales"" and other ponderous volumes. I suppose this is to give the film an intellectual flavor that never lingers on the palette, but passes right on through and comes out to be flushed away and not explained.

3. It rained everyday.
There were no people around in New York when the investigations were  going on.(When does that EVER happen).

4. The clues were so in-your-face that the ""gut-wrenching climax?"" came as no surprise. One only needed to pay attention to the scene between Paltrow and Freeman in the cafe to know where this was going to end.

5. I still think that Brad Pitt is no actor. I simply cannot see why this fellow gets work! Pretty faces do not an actor make!

6. I still admire to the utmost Morgan Freeman and Gwyneth Paltrow and their expert acting skills. They are far better than Pitt could ever dream!

7. Kevin Spacey seems only to ever play the same dead-eyed vacuous maniac even if the film is not a thriller.

SEVEN may be more appealing to some than it was to me. I honestly cannot see any value to the film for story line,rising action,editing,soundtrack ,direction or acting beyond one viewing.",1190851200,2,2312,4.688888888888889

7856954,3,630394518X,"When I first heard about this movie and its premise, back in '95, I nodded my head and figured it was a great idea. Then, some years later my father-in-law sent the vhs to my wife and me. SEVEN started out promising enough: the heavy atmosphere of a generic urban blight region, the deliberately paced filming, etc. You're set up for a terribly complex, suspenseful thriller. But it never fulfilled that promise. The movie strives for the psychological depth of SILENCE OF THE LAMBS or IN COLD BLOOD but never reaches it. I mean, the killer is using the Seven Deadly Sins as his model for the murders, so you think maybe he or she is a misguided religious nut? Duh. I dunno. Has it ever been done before?
And once you see who portrays the killer (although other reviewers have ""given it away""), I think you'll kind of grimace and say, ""Jeez, he was always playing the weird bad guy back in those days."" And, to me, his performance is kind of a throw-away job. He almost seems to not want to be in the picture.
Freeman and Pitt give good performances, however, Although the chemistry between them seemed strained (unlike the wonderful Glover and Gibson pairing in the LETHAL WEAPON films), the combination is effective, overall. I enjoyed watching them. The cinematography was engaging enough, and the direction elicited a few good scares. I guess I was expecting a really good thriller mystery--at least I was supposed to, given all the hooplah, Instead, I got a fairly-decent though brutal film.

Freeman stars as detective William Somerset, a thirty-four year veteran of the homicide department who is only one week away from retirement.  Pitt stars as detective David Mills, a brash young detective who will eventually become Somerset's replacement.  As the killing spree begins, Mills and Somerset are forced to put their philosophical differences aside and try to find the killer before the body count becomes too high.
This is one of the most thrilling, yet complex, movies I've seen.  Freeman and Pitt give excellent performances throughout the film, as do Gwyneth Paltrow as Mills' wife, and Kevin Spacey as the murderer, ""John Doe"".  The complexity of the film made it difficult to follow at some points, though, and I found myself really having to concentrate to keep up with the plot twists.
I enjoyed the way the producers of the film developed the character of ""John Doe"".  From the grisly murders to the portrayal of a media reported paid by the police themselves, Kevin Spacey brought this character to life in an attention-grabbing style.  Freeman's no nonsense, straight ahead approach is the perfect counter to Pitt's somewhat charge ahead and sometimes carefree demeanor.
I really enjoyed this film.  The plot was excellent and the actors are first-rate.

7856957,4,630394518X,"Despite being an unnerving, gruesome, and at times, twisted film, Se7en directed by David Fincher takes an accurate look at today's society.
Granted, everything has been amplified, but by the end of the movie, you can clearly see a message being put forth to the viewer, and that is, the world that we live in is dark, disturbing, and full of sin.
Se7en, which was made in 1995, takes place in a crime-ridden district, where a fresh-face detective by the name of Mills (Brad Pitt) has just arrived and been paired with Detective Somerset (Morgan Freeman), who is on the verge of retirement.
Although wise-mouthed and impatient, Mills' outlook on things is quite bright, while Somerset's is pessimistic, which quickly leads to a clash in styles.
Right off the bat, the duo is assigned to check out a murder where an obese man has apparently been forced to eat himself to death.
At first, it seems to be just an unusual murder, but Somerset soon sees a pattern being formed, following the murder of a high-powered lawyer, whose blood was used to write ""Greed"" on the floor of his office.
Somerset catches on that these two murders were based after two of the seven deadly sins, with the obese man's sin being gluttony, and the lawyer's, of course being greed.
Murders based on other deadly sins such as sloth and lust soon follow, with each one not being for the faint of heart, even though in each case, the victim is already dead when we finally see them.
Somerset concludes that the serial killer is using these murders to preach his sermon, and a small game of cat and mouse between the detectives and the killer ensues.
The mood of Se7en is projected nicely through its look; it's dark and gloomy, even indoors, colors with even a hint of brightness in them are used sparingly, and it's usually raining outside.
One dynamic that most people are sure to notice is the film's intelligent and unique dialogue, which can be credited to the film's writer, Andrew Kevin Walker, who didn't ""dumb down"" any of the film's dialogue.
The key characters in Se7en were well cast, with Pitt doing a fine job as the well-meaning but at times nave detective, and Freeman excelling in his role as the ""seen it all"" detective.
Gwyneth Paltrow plays Tracy, Mills' wife and is effective in the role, despite being seen infrequently throughout the film.
One of the more unique aspects of Se7en is that the killer makes his first appearance near the end, and provides a thought provoking little speech explaining his motive behind the murders.
This is really a strong element, when you take a look at so many other movies that feature a murderer who is killing for no apparent reason (or whose reason for killing is quite lackluster).
To some, the ending may seem unsatisfying, but in my eyes, it just sent home the film's message via a cruel twist.
Overall, Se7en will have you on the edge of your seat for two hours, but unlike other films that do that; this one will provoke your mind, leaving you full of thoughts at its conclusion.",1063324800,2,3017,4.662288930581614

  Freeman is wonderful, as always, playing a character similiar to his ""Red"" in The Shawshank Redemption:  soft-spoken, patient, and wise.  Pitt (Lose the mustache and beard!) looks at ease playing the cocky, over-eager kid cop.  Gwyneth Paltrow has a small part as Pitt's wife who encounters the serial killer later in the film.  The killer is played by Kevin Spacey as a quiet, intelligent, insane madman.

The direction and photography are top-notch.  The pace is quick, there are no wasted speeches or scenes.
