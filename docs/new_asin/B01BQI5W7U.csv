7666249,5,B01BQI5W7U,"A great collection of rare films based upon a brilliant series of mystery novels by S. S. Van Dine. The films are 80 years old and haven't been restored, but they are certainly viewable. They are delightful",1469145600,3,206,4.594594594594595

7666252,5,B01BQI5W7U,A great compilation of Philo Vance films and a free taste of the Lone Wold series came with mine.  It's amazing the number of innuendos you catch when you actually watch these films.,1466035200,3,182,4.515151515151516
7666253,4,B01BQI5W7U,The best are the older films. The later efforts (1947) are more like weak tv shows. The earliest with William Powell are my favorites.,1461024000,5,134,4.625
8751128,3,B01BQI5W7U,"I love the old 30s detective movies.  Ive collected many different sets.  But, unlike other detective series, Ive actually read the Philo Vance books.  Philo Vance was not a detective.  He was a well-to-do gentleman who was a friend of District Attorney Markum.  He had an interest in the psychological aspect of crime solving and used that to see clues the police overlooked.  He helped Markum only if he found the circumstances of the case interesting.  The Bishop Murder Case with Basil Rathbone best follows the book.  To some extent I can separate the books from films, and I don't mind that some of the films don't follow the books at all (Garden Murder Case).  But, I didn't care for some of the later films that turned Vance into an actual detective, at war with the police to the point that he was often suspected of the crime.  They tried to turn Philo Vance into a Simon Templar, Boston Blackie, or other thorn it the side of the police.  Philo Vance in the books was also more like Sherlock Holmes in that he had no romantic interests in women so his film persona coming to the aid of the lady in distress, I guess was necessary for films of the time.  I do recommend these films for lovers of 30s detectives, but not so much for lovers of Philo Vance unless you're good at separating the book Philo from the film Philo.",1523059200,,1332,4.458677685950414

8751130,5,B01BQI5W7U,Everything was as described. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the video considering some were 90 years old.,1502496000,2,119,5.0
8751131,5,B01BQI5W7U,Great collection-  the quality is as described.,1497139200,,47,5.714285714285714
8751132,4,B01BQI5W7U,"I ordered this set of movies and was delighted to receive the entire Philo Vance set, including two TV pilot episodes.  My only complaint is that the originals were old.  One of the movies was so damaged, the ending was cut off.  WHO DUNNIT??

Warning: The Philo Vance that starred Basil Rathbone was truly dreadful.",1495929600,,316,4.6909090909090905
8751133,5,B01BQI5W7U,"First off, not only do you receive ALL the Philo Vance movies, but the copy of The Bishop Murder Case is an excellent copy.  Much better than the one I received from WB Archive Collection.  Movies from the 20s, 30s, & 40s don't appeal to everyone, but I heartily recommend them to anyone that is interested in a good watch.",1493424000,3,323,4.366666666666666
8751134,4,B01BQI5W7U,All the philo vance movies.  Some are remakes of the same story.,1487203200,,64,4.333333333333333
8751135,5,B01BQI5W7U,"I was am very pleased to have found this collection. The 1929 ,1930 Philo Vance films (talkies) are very difficult to find. Here they are part of this collection. The seller makes no bones about these films are dvd r and the quality is much the same as they were originally shown on screen. These films are not going to be enhanced by your high definition players and should be viewed in 4:3 resolution to keep the graininess to a minimum .Very watchable. I have always been a fan of William Powell and have watched all his talking movies from the beginning of his career to his last perforance on the screen. Not all the Philo Vance movies starred William Powell but it was difficult to find a set which contained the earliest Powell/ Vance films. I enjoyed most of the later films up to 1947 (my taste) but this set includes the earlier films which I think are the most enjoyable. The seven disks (an 8th is included as a gift) are in a nice presentation case (plastic with art work) and in dust protectors within the case.  4 films star Powell, 2 star Warren William , 1 stars Basil Rathbone , the others 6 Various Stars of the day. Paul Lucus whom seems miscast does appear in one of the films but he was such a fine actor that it is a pleasure seeing him on the screen.
I only had read one S.S. VanDINE STORY SO I really do not know how faithful these films are to the origional stories but they are non the less enjoyable. I am almost exclusive to purchasing my dvds on the Amazon site ( as they really do stand behind what is advertised on their site) and this marketplace seller seems to be the only seller to have the best of the lot of the Philo Vance films.",1486252800,3,1668,4.261829652996846
