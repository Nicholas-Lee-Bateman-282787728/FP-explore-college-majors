Anyone who has ever tried to save someone they love, or seeks answers to  the sudden, tragic loss of that someone, will identify instantly with  Winger's character.",930096000,15,312,5.346938775510204
300944,5,6300271579,"Finally, a widescreen DVD! and a good one. Still the cut version and with no extras (except for the prevues, which includes a clip from the actual murder itself, which was cut after the first 2 days of original release, along with a few other minor deletions). I was fortunate to see the film on the day it opened in Hollywood; was surprised at the obvious cuts made during the 3 days before I went back to see it again. These cuts do not ""hurt"" the film in any way, but naturally we all hope that someday someone will oversee a restored, intact letterbox DVD release with lots of ""extras"". A haunting film, mysteriously overlooked...",1274486400,10,634,4.521739130434782

300946,5,6300271579,"This is one of the best films made in the late 1980's. Debra Winger is fantastic in this remarkable films.  I loved it when I frist saw it then later it turned up on tv but was never a hit.  It well should have been a top film at the time and has since become a classic to a lot of people.  Great acting, the photography is top notch and love the music score.  It is finally on DVD thanks to the new Warner Bros. Archive Collection so a must own for a lot of fans.
This one is a winner all the way!!",1257206400,6,499,3.769230769230769

And then I had to have it to add to my growing movie collection.

Whenever I need to be reminded of the seamy side of life, I pull this one off the shelf.

Debra Winger shines as a loyal girlfriend who puts up with almost complete neglect by her occasional boyfriend, played by Mark Keyloun.

An intermittent drug dealer, Mike tugs at our heartstrings with his charm and that little-boy appeal.  We still root for him despite his flaws and foibles.

When he is murdered (not a spoiler, since this is in the title!), Debra's character, Betty, is determined to find out exactly what happened.  Even though her pursuit leads her down a dangerous path.",1253577600,6,857,5.4961832061068705
300948,4,6300271579,"This movie is currently being released by warner Brothers Home Video through their website, Warner Archives. It is an official release, but has not been digitally remastered. Still, it looks and sounds great, even on my blu-ray player. Only downside: Warner Brothers list price is $19.95, plus tax (in CA) and shipping. There are no extra features. Even then, $24.00 for a beloved movie that will probably never see the light of day in any other format is better than nothing.",1249948800,7,476,4.888888888888889
300949,5,6300271579,"This film which I think came out in 1983 is one of my all time sentimental favorites. I found out about this movie because of Siskel and Ebert. Roger Ebert gave this movie a great review on his show ""At the Movies"". I took his advice and this movie has stayed with me for over 25 years. I tried to find it at the video store for years but finally located it on Amazon about 2 years ago.
 Debra Winger was at her all-time best as Betty the young woman who meets a guy that she falls for and can't get him out of her heart despite his unpredictable and sporadic attention. Debra was so convincing in this role because of the small things she did to portray her vunerability and need to try and rescue Mike. The scenes where Betty is wating patiently for Mike to call her to confirm the date he promised earlier in the day are heartbreakingly real.
 The soundtrack to the movie is superior and both enhances the suspense and drama as well as the piano theme that portrays Betty's character.
 Everytime I watch this movie I remember everything about my life when I first saw it and how I knew a girl just like Betty and how much I miss her.",1239580800,6,1136,4.225806451612903
300950,5,6300271579,"Absolutely brilliant film.  I saw it over 20 years ago, and it still haunts me.  If it had been made in France or Italy, it would be taught in every film school in the country.  Think ""True Confessions,"" or ""Salton Sea,"" or ""Chelsea Walls.""  An underappreciated American masterpiece.",1171411200,10,283,4.833333333333333
300951,4,6300271579,"I had to throw my two cents in on what is probably one of the best films I've ever seen. I remember seeing this film late one night, and being glued to the set. While it is a thriller, it also plays well as a character study. Whoever owns the rights to this should put it out ASAP! Included cut footage, and include a documentary about how poorly this film was treated upon it's release. If you can find a copy on video tape, I implore you to give this cool little film a look. You'll be glad you did.",1148947200,15,501,4.02
300952,5,6300271579,"Such an ubderrated film!!! Not to mention the debacle around its 1984 production when the MBA's at Warner made Bridges recut and trim down the violence because some yuppies girls sniffing nosecandy in a Walnut Creek bathroom during screening broke down crying saying things like ""How do they expect us to go on after seeing this?!!!"" They told Bridges they would not release his film unless he made the young cokeheads feel more safe, so he spent $200,000 to recut and reshoot portions of the (still) remarkable film so that he could give it to us, then, darn it, he up and died a few years later!!!
Anyway, this film has a GREAT score by JOHN BARRY with additional songs by then famous Joe Jackson.
It is an accurate a picture of the seediness of amoral 'I will kill you for money' vibe in L.A. as anything I have ever seen.
There are stellar performances throughout. Winger is simply the best of the 80s here.  Mark Keyloun (what happened to him???) shines as goofy, loveable, stupid Mike.
The cinematography (like Body Double of the same year, methinks) captures the numbing glare and seductive light of Los Angeles, the sense of ALWAYS BEING IN A CAR or ON A PHONE and rarely having any direct contact with the people you desire most (isn't that what fuels that place, though?).
Cannot recommend this thriller/character study enough for anyone who enjoys a peek at how the uninitated get destroyed, and how places like L.A. destroy them.
Oh yeah, this film bravely slams everyone equally. It's democratically un-PC.",1074816000,32,1519,4.753787878787879
300953,4,6300271579,"Running neck-in-neck perhaps with her work in Black Widow, this is Ms. Winger's best performance  to date.  Low-key and a little bit rambling, the movie's portrayal of an ordinary woman's descent into the L.A. drug culture  makes you feel uncomfortable and squirmy.  I hated the film when I first  saw it back in 1985; yet something about it stayed with me, got under my  skin, wouldn't let go --until in 1990 I rented the video, and realized  ""Oh my god, this film is a masterpiece.""  It's odd, slow and  expectation-defiant.  Favorite moment: Winger, alone at her piano, hovering  over an out-of-tune key because the sound brings back what she liked best  about Mike.
Contrary to Mr. Maltin, the late director James Bridges  never made a finer movie than this in his all-too-short career.",963360000,24,790,4.849624060150376

7808547,5,6300271579,"From the first time I saw this movie I loved it. Not sure why I was drawn so as it included blood and violence. The story line keeps me intrigued.  It was not available for DVD or streaming so it had been years since I have watched. The Hair and clothing may make it dated to some but this is real 80s reel and not just recreating the era.  Additional music by Joe Jackson is another reason why it remains a fave.

I remember it be a little more violent when I first saw this, which sadly must mean we have become desensitized to such things.
Debra Winger perfect for the role.",1442188800,4,577,4.133928571428571

7808550,4,6300271579,"I saw this movie a long time ago, so long ago that I don't really remember it, except for the fact that ""Mike"" does, in fact, get ""murdered"", just like the title says. He gets killed relatively soon in the movie, since it's more about his then-girlfriend, played by Debra Winger, who digs deep to try & figure out how and why he got murdered, which brings her to some kind of secret, ""underworld"", a criminal gang or something along those lines  - this Mike, who was either Winger's boyfriend or just a really close friend, whatever it was, was close w/Winger (her character, you know), but there turns out to be this whole part about him that the Debra character didn't know about - his ties to whatever organized crime syndicate or some corporate jazz or something illegal and outlawry...but the point of it is more seen through Debra Winger's eyes, who, being surprised (If I remember right) at his murder and so doing this kind of one-person investigation or getting clues from the cops, who probably aren't really doing anything about this case, at least not until Debra brings it to their attention & starts doing things about it, etc. Like I said it's been a while since I've seen it, so I really can't comment much on it, but I do remember that, although I would've been, like 14, 15 or so, when I saw it, something about it must've made an impression on me, to make me remember it all this time plus the fact that you never see the movie played on TV or cable at all, not even late night on Cinemax or someplace and, being that I've read good reviews of it, remember liking it the 1st time I saw it (even if I didn't see it all & I don't even remember that), I just knew that I wanted to see it (even the soundtrack is really good - on its own, as an album, it really stands up: Joe Jackson did the music for the film & wrote an album's worth of songs for the soundtrack: original stuff, but basically, a new album for Joe, one that he could add to his own discography, since all of the songs are his). Anyway, not being able to find it in Netflix or anywhere, really, on the internet, I finally was set on getting it, so I went to Amazon & I was in luck, this time I found a copy that sounds like it's decent enough - the last time I looked for the film on Amazon, a few months ago, I found that it was available but only from this one source that would, everytime someone would order it, burn a new copy of it on a DVD-R, then package it up & ship it out, but the place did mention that they were doing it that way, so they weren't hiding that fact. Anyway, the one I ordered sounded like it was a real copy, it says in the photo that the distributor/whatever that put it out is ""the Warner Bros. 'Archive Collection'""; I didn't even know if it was on DVD, but if it's now part of WB's ""archive collection"", maybe it did get put out w/a bunch of others from the same era.  Anyhow, I know it's worth watching. Not only do I remember it somewhat, but the reviews that I've read for it have all been relatively positive about it, so I must not have mis-judged the film.  So now, I can't wait to get the DVD to see it again!",1417910400,,3131,4.180463576158941

Mike's Murder (1984) ***1/2 / 4
D: James Bridges
C: Debra Winger, Mark Keylound, Darrell Larson, Brooke Alderson, Paul Winfield
P: A loan officer infatuated with her drug dealing tennis coach has her world unraveled when he is murdered.

Watching Mike's Murder for the first time, I found myself confused. Not confused in the sense that I couldn't follow the story, but confused in the sense that I didn't know what to think of it. My initial reaction was to simply dismiss it.

It's a well photographed film with a strong, distinctive look. The performances are strong, but when I went to examine what exactly it was that I took from watching the film, I couldn't really think of much. However, as time went by, I just couldn't quite shake it. It was one of those films that lingered on my mind afterwards. So I thought, maybe my initial reaction was unfair.

Looking at it a second time, I found the idea of how all these people's lives are interconnected by one random person (that all of them barely know) and how that one person has a domino effect on everyone they meet to be quite intriguing. The notion that someone you barely know, could affect your life so profusely, so negatively is quite frightening, quite powerful, quite tangible.

Reexamining Mike's Murder, the more I appreciated all the various nuances and complexities that were brimming just beneath the surface and the more I took from it each time I watched it. Mike's Murder isn't an easily accessible film, but I think the best films aren't always easy and they challenge you in unexpected ways. With Mike's Murder, there are so many different layers, so many different things to pick apart. It's the kind of entertainment that is endlessly fascinating.

7808553,3,6300271579,"This is a solid, gripping thriller that does an excellent job of portraying a seamy, ugly side of Los Angeles (the drug culture), so I'm not certain why it has been routinely trashed in many reviews. The negativity might be a result of all the rumored problems this film encountered post-production, as it was taken from the director and essentially re-cut. Apparently, it was originally designed to run backwards chronologically, but was pulled after poor test showings and re-edited in to this more conventional format. Regardless, in this released version it plays just fine. However, it would also be fascinating if it were ever cut as to its original intent. Although writer/director James Bridges passed-away in 1993, perhaps some enterprising outfit like Criterion might one-day offer a ""Director's Cut"" so that we might be able to enjoy this as it was meant to be shown (there are several tantalizing scenes in the original trailer that's available via IMDb).",1384128000,3,967,5.1265822784810124
7808554,5,6300271579,"I weighed in on this one many years ago at IMDB but I have to hold forth again. This is one of the most underrated neo-noirs ever made--smart, beautifully atmospheric, expertly paced, believable, and evocative on all sorts of levels. It's not perfect; the attraction between Betty Parrish and Mike Chuhutsky is not fully realized (though it is plausible). Yet all else falls into place with stunning elan and intuitive brilliance. The plot is absorbing, the acting is great, the musical score is first rate, and the overall effect has a tragic resonance that will linger in one's memory. Through some lucky, inspired alchemy of talent, timing, and zeitgeist, the late James Brooks created a truly great film. Enjoy.",1310342400,4,715,5.016806722689076
