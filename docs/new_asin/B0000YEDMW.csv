8004526,4,B0000YEDMW,"Knowing the history of situation the movie starts in helped me enjoy it more. Beria, head of the NKVD at the time if Joseph Stalin's death,gave a full pardon to the many people jailed and rotting in the gulags. Some were political prisoners, some were hardened criminals. They were all released together.",1390348800,,304,4.865384615384615
8004527,5,B0000YEDMW,One of the strongest Soviet movies I've ever watched. It is a drama based on real historical eventes happened in Soviet Union shortly after the death of Stalin. Imressive atmosphere and brilliant play of actors. I strongly recommend to watch it to those who are interested in the Soviet Union history,1218067200,2,300,4.901960784313726
8004528,3,B0000YEDMW,"This film was shot in 1987, when Russia was still part of the USSR.  The film, however, is openly critical of Soviet authority.  It couldn't have been made as little as a year earlier, but the makers decided to take a chance after Gorbachev and glasnost' came on the scene.  Ultimately, not much happens in the film, although some blood is spilled.  It does establish a certain atmosphere and mood.  Virtually the entire story takes place in a miniscule Siberian village and involves a mere handful of characters.  I was expecting the washed-out, grainy image of earlier Soviet films, but the image quality was quite good.  Subtitles in about twenty languages are offerred, as well as dubbing in English and French.  The only extra of note is a 15-minute interview with the director, who discusses how the film was transformed from the run-of-the-mill detective story he was tasked by Mosfilm to make into a risky critique of Soviet authority and those who either wield or accept it.  I wouldn't recommend this film for those who expect American-style action; it's definitely done in the European style.",1139529600,8,1103,4.918918918918919
