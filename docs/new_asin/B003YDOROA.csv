8409036,3,B003YDOROA,"Much better than what I expected after reading so much misinformation and moralistic rubbish about it, there are several elements that save ""Cuban Rebel Girls"" from oblivion. First, of course, it is somehow moving to see it as a product of love (or lust, take your pick), a vehicle conceived by Errol Flynn for his last woman, the 17-year old starlet Beverly Aadland. As it is, it is not bad: he even steps aside to let her be the center of the story that he conceived for her. To reflect on the plot, one has to consider first the second high point of the motion picture: it is a direct and fresh view of the first days of Cuban revolution, shot in Cuba and with the support of the Rebel Army. Those who make fun of the film apparently have no sense of the historic value of moving images, and in this case ""Cuban Rebel Girls"" contains valuable footage of the year the Cuban revolution triumphed, 1959 images of La Habana, the country side, the rebels, the sugar factories and even a brief moment of country music. In the movie, Flynn plays himself taking a trip to Cuba as a reporter covering the last days of the struggle to overthrow dictator Fulgencio Batista. Simultaneously an American girl (Aadland), whose lover is fighting with the rebels in the island, helps a Cuban girlfriend to take guns to the army. It is a very simple story line, but quite effective, combined with the images of the real ""barbudos"" (the bearded men, as the rebels were called when they could not shave after spending long time hidden in the mountains). For the project I guess Flynn could not afford top professionals, so he had to make do with his pilot-manager Barry Mahom as director (who in latter days would produce, write or direct sexploitation movies), cinematographer Merrill S. Brody, whose camera set-ups were not always inspired and a cast of non-professional who at least handled their few lines with enthusiasm. A third factor of interest for me is that this was Errol Flynn's last film: whatever you may think of it, especially if you compare it to his glorious adventure films at Warners, Flynn really touched my heart and made me smile with his last lines, wishing the best to all male and female rebels of the world who fight for a better life.
The real stinker here is ""Untamed Women"". You can do without it and find the better films that the writers of this one surely plagiarized.",1437091200,,2385,4.60093896713615
8409037,3,B003YDOROA,"It was interesting to see the last movie Errol Flynn made with his young lover Beverly Aadland in 1959, just before he died.  The movie is not great, and the acting by Aadland is substandard.  One of my favorite young actresses, Dakota Fanning, played Beverly in the film ""The Last of Robin Hood"".",1428537600,3,297,4.584905660377358
8409038,5,B003YDOROA,Found Cuban Rebel Girls interesting shots of Cuba. I found untamed Women fun to watch. Had no troubles with DVD.,1372291200,7,112,4.65
8409039,3,B003YDOROA,"Well done to Kit Parker/VCI for giving us the chance to see 2 very rare films in pretty good condition. Neither film in it's original showing would have been crystal clear/mint prints, but apart from some very dark scenes in ""Rebel Girls"" and given their age, these are very watchable prints. Sadly I can't say the same for the actual films. ""Rebel Girls"" is nonetheless, very interesting in a bizarre way. Flynn is himself, making a documentary about Castro's rebels, and I have to say that a lot of it looks pretty good, mixed in with real Newsreel. We also get to see his ""Friend"" Beverley Aadland, and what he saw in her I don't know. What she saw in him, well, maybe in a perverse way I can understand. I would never feel the need to watch this one again, but it is worth a view for cineastes and the plain curious. The second film ""Untamed Women"" has, in my humble, nothing at all going for it, so I won't be silly and list all the bad points like the ""acting"" and the dancing girls all made up like Beverly Hills models...Oh! Sorry I couldn't help it. Even those of us who have a penchant films like ""Prehistoric Women (Laurette Luez) will not find anything to like here. Still the price isn't bad, so you can ignore me...Go and buy!",1364256000,,1240,4.372294372294372
8409040,3,B003YDOROA,"...or 2.5 stars total: 3 for rebel, 2 for untamed. untamed"" has too much the same stock footage i already have in many other films using one million yrs bc for one. only good thing different in scenes is the opener of the plane going down, the plant grabbing a dude & the babes. all i can remember for now; i guess ill keep it in me collection.",1316563200,,344,4.073529411764706
8409041,5,B003YDOROA,The dvd I recently purchased is very entertaining in a way that brings back the memories of going to the movie house for a Saturday afternoon escape as a youngster.  Thank you for providing it.  I will search for more of the same escapism from the past to enjoy soon.,1311638400,5,267,4.32
8409042,2,B003YDOROA,"Errol Flynn loved Cuba and thought, like many that Fidel Castro was the country's savior. Well, everyone is wrong now and then. The film is about freedom fighters Flynn is backing as a ""journalist"" in Cuba. As a film it is really lame, but has some value as a documentary. worth a look for it's curiosity value.",1297468800,4,311,4.473684210526316
8409043,2,B003YDOROA,"If film history serves me correctly, Cuban Rebel Girls is Errol Flynn's final film.  To be sure, an inauspicious ending to a fine career.  I think more could have been done with the material, but let's not be hasty in attempting to change VCI's ""Positively No Refunds"" policy.  Flynn's explanatory narration is adequate and - as far as I can see - the troop skirmishes are realistically done.  The major problem with this release is that it's just too dark, you simply cannot make out much of what's going on.  For those interested, you do get a good look at Beverly Aadland - Flynn's young girlfriend.  The second movie on this double bill is Untamed Women, an early 1950's opus about lost airmen and lost women.  This is definitely the better of the two films, if - in fact - they can be compared.  Lost women descended from the druids, a tribe of Neanderthal men, giant lizards and brave hearted airmen - - what more can one ask?  With Doris Merrick and Mikel Conrad.  Crisp, bright picture.",1291852800,10,994,4.564971751412429
