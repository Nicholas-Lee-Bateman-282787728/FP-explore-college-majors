8555210,5,B00AO7HQG0,"This video is worth every penny, I have been a Kundalini student for over ten years now, and last year participated in a level one teacher training.  Kundalini yoga is a part of my daily life.  This video feels like being in a real class at home.  I felt like I was a part of his class, although I have to admit, there were quite a lot of people in that room, more than I would probably be comfortable with in a live class.  That being said, the exercises are doable for most people of all ages and flexibility.  Akasha's voice is soothing and encouraging.  Jai Jagdeesh is amazing as ever!  I can't say enough about this video.",1474675200,5,628,4.271186440677966
