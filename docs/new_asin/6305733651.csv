with being gay and in love for the first time.

to remain quite even though he love's Steven the cost is too high for him,

1063966,3,6305733651,"Silverstone's portrayal of Steven was pretty interesting. He's a strong actor and he really carriers the movie well enough mostly on his own. And given how he's in almost every scene, that's quite a burden to bear, so to speak. And I appreciated how he didn't exactly get all mushy and crazy over John. Sure, he was pretty interested, but I think there was a greater intellectual curiosity at work at first, especially since it's so rare to find someone you know that was gay at the time.

Gorton's performance as John as a little lackluster. You may end up spending a lot of the movie wondering why Steven ever decides to do more than just hook-up with the guy. His performance was a little wooden and it's see how the two might logically come together in any meaningful way. But the plot demands it, and so it happens.

What's a bit more intriguing is Steven's writing and how his thoughts on his homosexuality lead to a greater desire to talk about himself openly. The anonymous article that becomes one of the key plot elements in the movie is all about him trying to find a voice but also taking a stand in support of his fellow gay men. He speaks of the damage caused by the hurtful things that people say and what this might mean for the future. And that's a pretty powerful message indeed.

The movie is pretty well done with a lot of scenes that find other ways to convey a message apart from direct dialog. But there are some extraneous bits that maybe could have been edited out since there are times that the movie drags on a bit too long. And I'm not quite sure why they made the dad such a major Whovian - it makes for interesting background material but it seems wasted on being not much else. Steven's father seems to be angry about a lot of things, but we never fully explore this aspect to things.

Get Real is a good enough movie, although is suffers from the pains of plays translated into movies. I don't know the original material so I can't make comparisons, but I do get the feeling that elements that might have worked on the stage didn't quite work out here.",1420588800,,2084,4.405194805194805

1064124,5,6305733651,"Extremely well acted with young actors that know their job: to make us believe the story is true, is what happens everyday now and then and from time to time more often than we think. Secondary schools of any type are big boxes where there are plenty of closets and they tie up and throw those they don't like in those closets for them to rot, to cry, to suffer, to be miserable. Don't believe one moment it is only a question of sexual orientation. It can be the way you dress, the music you listen to, or even for teachers the way you speak to the students or the way you may put your hand on the students' shoulders.

This film is perfect and so British indeed. It touches the right points and it plucks the right strings. How can a 16 year old young man, or boy if you prefer, come out of the closet and just trust himself, trust his family, trust his school, trust the world even, and know he will be accepted the way he is and the way he feels happy? That's the worst part of it. Of course the parents know there is something bothering the boy, or the young man if you prefer. Of course the teachers feel it too and even know it. The other students just feel it, decide that it is what they feel it is, and most of them, at least most of those who will say anything, will condemn the young man, or the boy if you prefer. And don't even imagine it is not the same thing for girls, or young women if you prefer.

But at the same time the only way to get out of the closet is to open the door with a bang and to let everyone know that from now on they better not walk on the boy's, or the young man's if you prefer, prick and even raise one single finger to block the way, otherwise their ""cubes"" as they say in CSI will be mashed to a pulp. It takes crazy courage for the first one. It takes courage for the one hundred next ones and when you reach one thousand you can finally start finding it nearly natural. But it will be natural only when you reach the million of out-of-the-closet-tall-walkers. And tall you need to walk.

I regret that this simple question of the freedom to love who you want to love and who wants to love you back, no matter who that one is has become a religious question, a political question, a philosophical question, or whatever other label you can put on that. It is none of these and it is no other classification you may invent. It is only a question of sentiments, feelings, emotions, passions, empathy and liberty. It is a basic human right. Everyone has the right to love everyone else who accepts that love and loves them back.

I have been dealing with men, or women, in the closet, no matter what closet it may be, all my life. Some of my university professor colleagues told me I was not supposed to know who is Jewish, who is Moslem, who is LGBT, or whatever, and that the students are not supposed to tell. Some professors are still living on the ""don't ask don't tell"" syndrome, you know that cowardly compromise Bill Clinton invented to make everyone forget what was happening at the time in the Oval Office.

And now this DADT shameful legislation has been dropped all the fundamentalist brains in the world consider marriage is for sex and sex is for procreation, and that there is no other dimension in sex and in marriage. As you can see love has disappeared for these brains that are indeed no brains. You make love but you do not love. For them everyone on this planet, and sooner or later they are going to extend this silly ideology to the moon or to mars, has to wear the only penguin costume that is allowed by the necessity to make spermatozoa and eggs meet and fertilize each other. If you use a French letter, not to say a condom, a pill of any sort, a diaphragm or, horrible horror of horrors, vanity of vanities, an abortion you become a killer, a murderer, an assassin, some one who should be stoned on market day on the market square in every village or neighbourhood in the world.

Yeah it is nothing but love and love is a passion, an emotion, a feeling, a sentiment, something that makes your mind rev up and then take off at cosmic speed and in that phenomenal power and force there might be for some a sexual dimension but there is no obligation for that dimension to exist and be experienced by all the people who are in love, who love one another. To make love is not even a plus. It is another dimension because then you lose your head, you loosen your mind and you blaze your soul tracks to let your hormones take over and your endocrine glands, you may chose the one you prefer, empty themselves.

Actually it seems to be a syndrome that concerns the fundamentalists because for them love cannot exist outside the only sexual relation they accept - read my lips even if my mouth is full - and anything that is pricking outside and on the side of this square definition makes them retch: the poor darlings, my heart is bleeding for them, and I applaud all those who make them vomit proving that for them it is always a question of emptying the endocrine glands, but in their case the wrong ones and the wrong way.

1064125,4,6305733651,"""Be realistic, demand the impossible"". Why not? Sometimes being realistic means, indeed, to have no creative freedom and above all no real desire to escape ideological imprisonment.

When Steven, a 16 year old student, starts frequenting public toilets hoping to hook up and have random sex with unknown men, he looks aloof and somehow emotionally unattached. His only confident is Linda, a girl somewhat ostracized because of her weight, and they come to a conclusion: no matter how hard they've tried, love has not been a part of their lives.

One day, in one of those public toilets the British seem so keen on visiting, he runs into John, another student from his high school. Except that John is not just another student, he happens to be the Golden Boy, not only is he the best athlete and the most handsome boy, he is also rich and very popular. Of course, John neutralizes possible misunderstandings by explaining that he just happened to be there. When Steven, disappointed and embarrassed, decides to depart, John asks him if his parents are home.
In Steven's home, the game commences, or rather, what was already there comes to the surface. When John makes fun of a teddy bear in Steven's room, that soon leads into physical contact as Steven tries to retrieve the object from John's hands. Then, after being on top of each other, breathing hard and unmistakably excited, John proceeds to unbutton Steve's trousers and when they're about to kiss things get interrupted.

The interruption is a symptom of society's intervention, which in this case does not take the form of an angry mob but rather the moral constraints that are deeply rooted in John's mind. If the gaze of the other defines us completely, then what must we do to be successfully inserted in society? For traditional psychoanalysis homosexuality has been a perversion, a mental illness, a condition that could be remedied, but it has also been the abject, id est, the vilest, the very lowest of the human condition. I would like to believe that much time has passed since then, but it's undeniable that some people, perhaps more than I would care to admit, continue to think as if they had been raised in the Victorian age.

On the contrary, Steven has come to terms with his sexuality since he was 11. He has no doubts, no regrets. He feels only angry at the prejudiced people surrounding him at home, at school and everywhere in between. As his relationship with John progresses, they thrive to keep the secrecy, but the clandestine rendezvous and the constant hiding takes a toll on Steven. As John explains to him, they can do anything they want as long as no one else knows about it.

Although at first this is hardly a limitation, soon the nature of the relationship will demand openness. Steven wants John to feel proud of them, of their relationship, he demands John to acknowledge him in school, not only outside. How long can they go keeping the secret? And is it really impossible to declare their love to everyone else? Be realistic, sometimes the impossible simply cannot be demanded for the very reason that it shouldn't have been deemed impossible in the first place.

As the impossibility of accepting homosexuality is firmly placed in John's head, things will not be easy. But when other school kids start making enquiries and deductions, the entire relationship could come apart. Does this couple have what it takes to surmount seemingly unconquerable obstacles or was this a doomed affair from the very beginning?",1318723200,3,3509,4.84
1064126,4,6305733651,"This is  film about a young British boy, well played by Ben Silverstone, coming to the realization that he is gay who wants to love and be loved.  This is generally a good treatment of its subject but not nearly as movingly or effectively as Jonah Markowitz's remarkable film ""Shelter"" (2007) starring Trevor Wright and Brad Rowe treats a similar theme.",1317600000,,353,4.770491803278689
1064127,5,6305733651,"This was a very good gay teen story, romantic and not too dramatic. Giving the year, 1998, and the setting, UK, I'm not surprise the movie is not entirely ""happily ever after"", UK movies tend to be a little more realistic and not really light, but in any case Steven and John share their romantic high school romance and maybe for Steven it will be a nice love story he will sweetly remember when he will be older. On the contrary of many gay teen characters of other movies, at 16 years old Steven is sexually active and even if he is not able to find a boyfriend (living in a little town and being gay is not easy), he cruises the public park and the near woods: not really safe, but for sure a place where he can at least unload a bit of energy. Here he finds John, all-jock-beautiful-bod-wet-dream student at his same high school. Even if John seems older and more mature than Steven, he is instead still in that phase when he doesn't know how to address his sexual urges for his same sex. Steven will help John and at the same time he will realize his high school romance, but it's pretty clear that this cannot be a long-term relationship, at least not until John will be able to admit that what he is feeling for Steven is not a phase. I need to give credit to John though, even if he has not the courage to go public and admit it with everyone else, he has the courage to admit his love for Steven, and that I think is a good thing for Steven, what he will probably remember with fondness in the future.",1299974400,,1511,4.213793103448276

With all the bullying going on now in our country, let us hope the recent effort to get us back in the closet has not happened in Britain!  This is a really fun film to watch.

1064129,5,6305733651,"I have a thing for County Durham. I find the people calming, sexy and immediately fell in love with the soothing and sweet accent. Perhaps this makes me a little biased when reviewing 'Get Real', although I suspect those that watch will not be disappointed. The story is a little stayed, in that there is very little which we have not seen or heard before, but what makes this version so different is the lead actor Ben Silverstone. If there is a single reason for watching this movie, it is to see his enigmatic performance.

For such a young actor in such a difficult genre, he has achieved what many senior actors spend life times trying to achieve. A single performance which echoes throughout ones acting career, and which elevates you regardless of how you perform thereafter.

The cast in general is very good. Together they portray the innocence, endemic cruelty and frivolity of youth, without negating the importance of the story. The story in turn is a challenge to get real, and accept what one is despite what society would have you be. Unfortunately, as in many truths there are few courageous enough to stand against a sea of adversity, hypocritical judgment and societal norms.

Brad may be the hero in the eyes of the school body, in that he fits the measure against which society makes such heroes. Good looking, sporty and in authority he is both coveted and admired. Steven is the exact opposite, and despite his inner strength, personal convictions and overwhelming courage, he is not considered for hero status. When Brad crumbles into the weak, deceptive person that he is, Steve emerges as the only person prepared to be real both to himself and the world.

If only we would make heroes of those that deserve such title.",1277424000,,1744,4.745874587458746
1064130,5,6305733651,"I have had a VHS copy of this movie since it was produced and purchased the DVD as soon as I knew it was available.
The main characters, Steven, his boyfriend, Steven's best (girl) friend and an unexpected ""girlfriend"" all give superior performances. Steven is a somewhat precocious teenager who is braving the local ""lav"" (tearoom) to meet men. Naturally, society presents encouragement only for hetero- relationships so this appears to be the best Steven can do to meet somebody.  He does have an encounter with a man which he escalates (in his mind) as a wonderful new opportunity for romantic opportunity.  Unfortunately, life doesn't allow things to happen so easily for most people.  A bit later, Steven is ""trying anew,"" but this time, things are very different.  The story takes a very new and exciting course which I won't further elaborate except to say everything throughout this movie is extremely 'Real'-to-life. If you're not gay, you will get a much clearer understanding of the difficulties gay males, in particular, suffer due to a society that generally condones and/or encourages some, if not all of the discriminatory treatment you will witness here.  There is definitely some comedy, twists, turns and very tender moments as well.  Another great film of this genre is ""Beautiful Thing"" which I highly recommend. I read many reviews of films before I decide whether to purchase and I hope you will consider the learning opportunity offered in this film to 'Real' film buffs who may want to expand their horizons or just enjoy a beautifully acted film with great production values, a real plot and reasonable ending.",1275868800,2,1635,5.014760147601476

Personally being gay myself could identify with Steven (Ben Silverstone) and his issues that he goes through while trying to hold onto a little romance with the schools jock, John (Brad Gorton).

Just bought the film on DVD recently, it was hell of a search because this title is out of print and I had to resort to buying second hand, but was not displeased with the price.

Steven spends time in public toilets seeking gay encounters and he finds them...school uniform and all.  He gets more than he bargained for when John, the school hottie turns up...talk about awkward.  You could suspect a trap, gay bashing, gay outing...but no, John is emabarrassed and awkward.  The relationship starts and stops and stutters.  John wants to pusue Steven but he is the geek, the target of bullying by John's set of friends (the tossers, no that is not what they call themselve it is what they are).  Steven knows who he i (smart, gay, not into sports) , and so does his best friend Linda - played very well. She is the comic counterpoint for the deep and meaningful pathos of the lead characters.  The relationship between the boys develops in secret but it looks set to fizzle into obscurity.  However, the night of the school dance, when Steven has lost all hope John surprises him and the relationship, in all it's glory, begins.  It is a secret of course, only Linda knows, but Steven's mother is becoming aware of the difference and the signs, realising he is gay.  The relationship develops and Steven wants more, he wants equal billing with John's official girlfriend.  There is a cute scene where  John is holding Steven and says ""You need a shave"" and Steven replies ""I shaved last week""...cute, cute, cute.  Steven comes out in an article for the school paper, anonymously.  The article is banned.  Steven is caught smelling John's clothing by the tossers and John.  John deals with Steven by beating him, well so the tossers think.  In fact they are staging the beating...and almost end up kissing.  As the lips are about to lock the lead tosser comes in and catches them, so the beating becomes real so John can cover the love he feels.  Steven then turns up at school assembly, beaten and bloody and outs himself - he does this while accepting a prize in front of dignitaries, staff, parents and the whole school.  Shock, horror, acceptance and rejection ensue.  By outing himself he has severed the relationship with John because John cannot face the shame and say he is gay - his parents and friends and the world have expecations of their bright light and he doesn't have the courage to say ""That is not all there is to me, I am gay as well...not instead of, but as well"".  Steven did.  There is no happy ending between the boys.  John looking into the empty future without Steven, instead he has accolades and academia waiting...but not the love of a good boy...  And Steven goes off into a future where he looks strong and as though the weight has been lifted.  He is out and he is proud and he is who he is, no apologies.  I recommend this...whatever age you are.  It makes me smile...it reminds me of Beautiful Thing, I recommend you look at that too:-)&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Beautiful-Thing/dp/B00008UALE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Beautiful Thing</a>",1201910400,4,3175,4.8584729981378025
1064149,5,6305733651,"The first time I watched this movie, I immediately got emotionally attached to the characters, especially the main character Steven (played by an excellent Ben Silverstone). Like the title suggests, this movie is ""real""--a believable tale of what it's like being gay in a school where it's not accepted and everyone is 'in the closet'. No spoilers here, but the ending is very emotional, realistic, and will probably make you cry.

After renting this movie, and watching it a couple times after that I decided I had to buy a copy. You will watch this movie many times and not get tired of it!

A bit of a personal opinion: This movie is a UK movie (I'm from Canada), and I'm a huge fan of foreign cinema in general, but the UK setting is great--I love how they talk, both the words and their accents. But that's just my opinion.

I give this movie a 5/5 based on the movie itself, and it definitely deserves it! One thing I didn't like about the DVD is that it lacks in additional features. It would have been nice to see some interviews etc. with the actors and/or directors but so be it.

In summary, I would highly recommend this movie for *anyone* to watch, it's not just for gay people. The issues dealt with are quite serious--homophobic comments/harassments at school, ""self-homophobia"" (i.e. denial of being gay), and others. At the same time, there is humour injected in just the right places. A prime example is Steven's best friend and next door neighbour, and her dealings with her driving lessons (you'll see what I mean). If you buy one ""coming out"" movie, make it this one!",1200960000,2,1588,4.6007067137809186
1064150,2,6305733651,"This movie was first released in 1999, and I just now got to see it.  Kinda' pitiful, but what can I say?

The film is a coming-of-age tale about high school student Steven Carter (played by Ben Silverstone).  He is 16 and when the movie starts he can be found cruising of the neighborhood park bathrooms.  He has admitted to himself that he is gay, and I suppose ""any port in a storm,"" huh?  The only other person he has told his secret to is his best friend and neighbor, Linda (played by Charlotte Brittain).  Charlotte chides him for his indiscretions at the bathroom, but he urges her that he is ALWAYS safe.  Yes, we all know what kind of safe sex goes on in bathrooms.  Durinig one of his trysts, he accidentally hooks up with one of the high school jocks (played by Brad Gordon) who has managed up to this point to turn a blind eye and deaf ear to his jock friends bullying Steven.

I really wanted to like this film.  I--and I'm sure many others who read this--went through a lot of what Steven's character goes through; however, I NEVER sought solace in a public bathroom.  After the initial tryst, the movie then settles into a very run of the mill visualization of scenes:  gay boy falls for jock, who is also gay but VERY closeted, they ""frolic,"" are caught in lies, outted by the school newspaper, jock then hits/leaves gay boy, gay boy makes speech at graduation, ZZZZzzzzzzzzz...

The reason it was difficult for me to like this movie (and I do NOT recommend it) was because the actors--try as they might--could not deliver believable enough performances.  Silverstone's attempt albeit feeble at breaking down during his speech was just that--feeble--as was Brad Gordon's attempt to explain his feelings.  Both actors managed ""sobs"" but there were not tears.  Steven's coming out speech contained so many pointed questions, but they were not delivered with any real emotion.

The movie is rated R for brief nudity, language, and sexual situations.  Run time is 1 hour and 50 minutes.  It was directed by Simon Shore, written by Patrick Wilder (based on his play ""What's Wrong with Angry?"" and was released in 1999.",1193788800,4,2130,4.662198391420912

No doubt much of my reaction is personal, and I suspect this movie is pretty much a gay thing. It may even be more specialized than that -- a gay thing for people who aren't American idiots, which would rule out much of the audience for teen-oriented entertainment, as evidenced by a couple of the more vapid reviews in this thread. So be warned if you are (a) straight, (b) stupid, (c) unable to tolerate non-Hollywood fare, or some ungodly combination of the above.",1183161600,2,729,4.481203007518797

Of course it's tough to be ""real"" when that is exactly what friends, family, and society often don't want to see, but in the long run it is just so much better than trying to live a lie and make yourself believe this is okay.  In the film, I thought the writer did a nice job of showing how some people who appear to have everything actually end up with very little of true value while the ""outcasts"" often shine with true grit and integrity.  Overall, this is a feel-good movie with a mostly good ending.  The characters are great. You'll like it!",1174089600,4,785,4.468531468531468

1064257,5,6305733651,"This film is near the top of my heap on the Gay Movie List. Funny & moving, the film deals with its subject and characters with thoughtful sensitivity. The tender scene when closeted/terrified school athlete John Dixon confesses his feelings & inner conflict to average but sweet Steven Carter is beautifully done. But soon after John & Steven become a couple, the anguish begins: secret rendevous, close calls with the law (and friends) and overlapping stories to cover their tracks gradually paint  them into a corner. The climactic scene is absolutely startling & emotionally powerful as Steven summons up the courage to come out to the entire school. Could you imagine doing THIS in front of your classmates & faculty? The filmmakers obviously took artistic license for maximum effect, but it's still a great scene. And the prom dance in which John & Steven slow dance with their own female partners but lock eyes wantingly with each other from across the room says it all.

But that final scene which Steven walks away from the relationship is so heart rending, yet it's a move Steven MUST do in order to go on with his life. Although ""Get Real"" has a few cliches---the caring/savvy Mum, the lunkheaded Dad who's so focused on other things that he can't put two-and-two together on his son, and of course, the chubby but intelligent friend who strikes out on love but strikes with a sharp tongue---the film succeeds in telling its story anyway.

Simply put, ""Get Real"" has a great cast, a great script, and great direction.

If only more U.S. films could handle their content more deftly as this special British import does!",1165276800,5,1629,4.827956989247312
1064258,3,6305733651,"""Get Real"" is really the standard 'gay boy in high school' movie in all respects. The storyline follows Steven Carter, a rather shy boy, as he falls in love with jock superstar John Dixon. Through a series of happy coincidences, they get together and become boyfriends, against all odds. But while Steven, supported by female schoolfriends, is increasingly seeking to come out of the closet, John simply doesn't dare to lose his reputation and constantly reneges on his relationship with Steven. Meanwhile, Steven is constantly pestered by the school bully, who has an inkling that he might be queer. The tension and secrecy finally come to an end in a somewhat climactical ending when Steven wins an essay award and decides to come out right there.

As already somewhat clear from the above description of the plot, this movie is awfully full of lucky coincidences, unlikely series of events and rather clichd scenes. This isn't really so much a bother, since it's clearly intended to be a feel-good movie for gay viewers and it succeeds quite well at this. But if you're looking for a deep or realistic plot, this is not the movie for you. The standard of acting is somewhat uneven across the characters; the protagonist and the girl next door are played very well indeed. Much less impressive are most other roles, especially John Dixon, who is not convincing for a moment. And then there are some odd script elements, such as Steven's best friend Mark, who appears a lot in the beginning of the film only to be increasingly neglected by Steven; at the end he doesn't play a role at all, and the point of this is never explained.

The soundtrack of the movie is very pleasant though, the plot is fun and entertaining if not a moment real, and as gay high school movies go, it could be a lot worse. But if one wanted to be critical, it could be a lot better, too.",1159833600,2,1865,4.6314199395770395

To watch and observe Stephan's life go from a pain of loneliness and secrecy to love and shame rips at your inside and leaves you feeling both uplifted and vulnerable at the same time. This cinematic masterpiece moves beyond the typical coming out story and focuses on true love and the boundaries it faces and must conquer inflicted not from the outside world but from the lovers themselves. Combining a mix of heart wrenching drama and laugh out loud dark humour I was left enthralled and fixated not wanting for it to finish.

I like Get Real better than Brokeback Mountain. No one gets killed at the end, and the boy who comes out, possibly gets a better life (the movie ends abruptly with no epilogue).

In a single word, Get Real is ""fresh"". The background music is just lovely, it's a very light kind of music and that helps a little bit. it feels as though you're being transported to the actual moment when it happened. the whole story is absolutely believable. i'd give it a 5 star rating if it weren't for Jhonny's poor acting and lack of chemestry with the movie as a whole, simply, he doesn't fit at all. i suppose some casting crew members are into greek guys, dunno why.",1125705600,6,817,4.527027027027027

Get Real includes the awkward silences, the social fumblings, the excitement of a first love, and the heartbreak that everyone, gay or straight, went through in high school.

You will enjoy this film greatly, and will want to watch it over and over again. It is not about hot sex, violence, crime, or drugs - it is about what may be happening next door to you, or even to your own children, or what have happened to you when you were young.
When you are young and learn that you are gay it may be a nightmare, or a serious situation. You have to think about your family first, then about your friends and school-mates. What will they all say when they get to know about you? Certainly, they won't approve - that is what you think. And your school-mates may even beat you seriously, if even not knowing yet they give you no peace with jokes and insults.
With all that you find out that you want to love and be loved. As Steven Carter, the main character, puts it, ""Find someone to do it with, find somewhere to do it, and do it. The thing is that at my age it just isn't that simple."" Then comes the one you cannot resist, or, rather, the one that cannot resist you: and the story rolls on to its climax.
Steven Carter (played by Ben Silverstone) is 16 years old, attends a school in Basingstoke in the south of England, and happens to be gay. Only his neighbour, Linda (Charlotte Brittain) knows about it. Parents would not be happy, and other schoolchildren, particularly Kevin, already call Steven queer. He is certainly a ""secretive"" type: never goes out with anyone, doesn't have friends beside Linda and Mark, doesn't go in for sports as other boys his age do. His talent (or at least one of them) is writing, and his article about Millennium Generation wins the local newspaper award.
Then life throws John ""Sex-on-Legs"" Dixon (Brad Gorton) into Steven's hands. John tries to take himself in hand, but with every encounter with Steven falls more and more in love. Finally, he comes out and the two lads get close. What ensues is a story of difficult relationship between a school outcast and a school heartthrob.
The film might be a bit melodramatic, but our lives are melodramatic. There might be a bit of a fairytale thrown in here and there, but again, fairytales make people feel for their heroes and learn certain lessons. Both ""Get Real"" and ""Beautiful Thing"" are sometimes accused of being fairytales. But aren't we read fairytales in our childhood, and don't we learn a lot of good things from them? What is wrong about a fairytale?
There are surely things and words to laugh at, especially when Linda comes to the foreground.
""Get Real"" shows how difficult it can be for a teenager to come to grips with the people surrounding him; how important friends' and parents' support might be; what it takes to love another person and fight for your love; how it feels to come out to a whole crowd of people after you've been let down by the beloved one.
The language of ""Get Real"" is much easier to comprehend than that of ""Beautiful Thing"": there is less slang, and the accent is closer to the norm (which is especially good for non-British viewers). Only the kissing scenes do not look as real as in ""Beautiful Thing"", and that is where ""Get Real"" has its drawback. But we can surely forgive it, as the rest of the movie is beautiful.",1067212800,5,3293,4.508361204013378

The story is so realistic & I could relate to pretty much everything. There's other movies about coming out & falling in love for the first time being gay, but this one does it in the best way. At one point in the film, everyone seems to be heartbroken. I won't deny that this movie made me cry, and it will probably make you cry too. It's a beautiful story & it ends in a different way than most movies. Let's just say it will leave you wanting more. Make sure you have some tissues nearby!

One of the better coming-out movies. It is right up there with Beautiful Thing. The only fault is the ending as many of us wished that Steven and John didn't have to say good-bye. Highly recommended.

1064492,3,6305733651,"While watching this movie, I kept looking for the release date: surely it must be 1952, not 1998! It's about some alternate-world Britain where Stonewall never happened, so there are no gay organizations, no gay publications, no gay pride festivals, nothing except anonymous encounters in public toilets. Ben Silverstone plays the only gay student in his large urban high school, an extremely feminine young man who plasters his bedroom with pictures of football jocks, yet is horrified by the idea that his parents might find out he is gay (surely any parent would have figured that out years ago).
He begins a relationship with the local jock, who is so horrified by the idea of anybody ""finding out"" that he won't acknowledge Ben's presence in public, continues to date his old girlfriend, and even beats Ben up to prove to his high school cronies that he hates gay people. Of course, he does: he hates himself. But Ben is no model for gay pride either, since after all no gay pride exists in this weird alternate world, just furtive encounters and worries that someone might find out.
In the U.S. and in Britain, there are gay-straight alliances in hundreds of high schools, chapters of PFLAG and MCC in even the tiniest of towns, hundreds of organizations for gay teenagers. So why does this movie live in some weird twilight zone? It is a slap in the face of gay teens everywhere, their parents and teachers, and just about everyone else who devotes time and energy to fighting homophobia and anti-gay oppression.",1059609600,5,1519,4.823754789272031

She turns out to be a real friend of Ben, however.

I immediately checked Showtime online to find when it would be playing again. Director Simon Shore beautifully creates every gay teen's dream come true (a romance with the high school hero) and he makes it seem all so natural and believable. Ben Silverstone (Steven) illuminates this film. Brad Gorton (John)is wonderfully awkward yet passionate - not to mention incredibly beautiful. I must admit, I am a sap for this. I was a college cheerleader and had my first romance with a guard on the team. Both of us were like John, however, and our fear was paralyzing. I eventually became like Steven, and the other guy got married. Go figure.",1051315200,,753,4.8
1064498,5,6305733651,"Simon Shore manages a smooth transition from television and documentary filmmaking to feature films with his debut, the captivating and engrossing gay teen comedy Get Real, based on Patrick Wilde's stage success, What's Wrong with Anger? Shore recounts an appealing tale of a teenaged schoolboy coming to grips with his emerging sexuality. Sixteen-year-old Steven is just another teenager: He listens to the latest music, plays computer games, hangs out with friends. But Steven has a secret: He's in love with the school's top athlete, the devastatingly handsome John Dixon, who reminds me of a young Christian Bale. Not surprisingly, Dixon is dating a model and is the object of every girl's attention. Steven certainly can't tell his parents, and none of his friends know he's gay; he can only confide in his best pal, the overweight, feisty Linda, who wants a romance of her own. As if this weren't complicated enough, Steven discovers that one of the girls at school has developed a crush on him. And then Dixon notices Steven's attention. Shore and his cast of youngsters do a wonderful job of capturing the secret lives of his teenage characters. He penetrates the hearts and minds of people trying to understand their complex sexual yearnings, while compensating for the expectations of parents, friends, and society. Fresh, youthful, and invigorating, Get Real establishes its moving tone from the beginning and doesn't let go; it takes an incisive voyage into the world of a gay teenager trying to tell the world that there's nothing wrong with being in love. This film was strongly recommended to me and I'm glad it was. It's an inspiring and insightful view into young gay life. All the characters and real and not cardboard sterotypes, giving the film that realistic edge which helps it surpass other films of the genre. It's a wonderful film and one every struggling gay teen should see. One of the best coming-of-age films ever and an inspiration to the handful of gay-themed scripts I have written.

1064610,5,6305733651,"""Get Real"" is a great gay coming-of-age story. This British film has a screenplay by Patrick Wilde and is directed by Simon Shore. It stars Ben Silverstone as Steven Carter, a teenage schoolboy who's looking for gay love and sex. He's only out of the closet to his friend Linda (played by Charlotte Brittain), who feels like an outsider herself because of her large weight. The film follows Steven as he deals with the joys, pain, and frustration of being a gay youth.
""Get Real"" certainly touches on some controversial issues, such as teenage sexual activity and public ""cruising"" for sex. But I believe the filmmakers handle these and other issues with intelligence and sensitivity. Stephen is a writer, so the role of the student press is also a factor in the story.
Wilde's script has some really engrossing dialogue, and Shore directs his scenes with grace and skill. Classic songs are cleverly used throughout the film to underscore the characters' emotional states.
It's the outstanding performances of ""Get Real"" that really make this film excellent. Silverstone shines in the title role; he brings a rich blend of strength, vulnerability, impishness, and sexual energy to his character. Much of the film rests on his shoulders, and he succeeds totally. Silverstone has great onscreen chemistry with gal pal Brittain, who brings a nice dash of spice to her character. Other strong performances are turned in by Brad Gorton (as the school jock who is the object of Steve's affection) and Jacquetta May (as Steve's mother).
""Get Real"" is a thoroughly enjoyable and entertaining film, but it is also a film which deals with serious sociological issues in a compelling and compassionate way. The film vividly explores the burdens faced by gay youth: homophobic harrassment from classmates, internalized homophobia, etc. But ultimately I found this to be an uplifting and hopeful film.

Let me add that the romantic scenes bewtween the leads were tastefully done and won't embarrass mom and dad.  Best friend Linda is hilarious and fits right in the film.  Through this film, everyone can see that it's normal to be gay, and that there's a reason those men meet in parks.  It's not because they are perverted and sick.  As a gay person, I could identify with pretty much every scene, the discomfort dealing with the parents, the longing for a relationship, the need to hide absolutely everything about this part of myself from the world for fear of reprisal.

Steve is a gay kid, closeted and non-suspected of being so, but nonetheless persecuted as a gay kid by the school jock/bullies.
After classes at his school, Steve often cruises the local park bathroom for sexual encounters.  The typical 16yo, he interprets the encounters as being based on love and ends up hurting himself in the process...and building his despair.
One day, chance would have him meet John, a school mate and star football (soccer for us yanks) player at the toilets.
A friendship begins, with John finally trying to break out of his shell.  He just might have done it too...if he could only get past his desparate fear of becoming a social freak.
But alas, fate also deals them some rather ugly blows, and Steve's advanced acceptance of his homosexuality fights back.  His actions lead John into a panic...and some reprehensible behavior against Steve in an effort to save his reputation.

1064762,5,6305733651,"You could say this film had all the typical twists and turns of a straight Hollywood teen romance flick.  But this isn't a straight Hollywood teen romance.  This is a foreign, gay romantic movie with the depth that isn't found in Hollywood movies.
There is subtly in all the underlying story currents...the overweight best friend...the parents...the anonymous meetings in the park.  The story isn't exaggerated as a Hollywood movie would be and the ending isn't as fairytale-like.
But that is where this movie outshines most movies.  It is more down to earth, more real, and more life-like.  The slow development of Steven and John's relationship leads into those hot and heavy, desperate meetings on the sly.  John, the seemingly strong jock, is the one who constantly questions himself and his feelings, while sweet and not so innocent Steven has jumped right into the gay life.
I suppose you could say the parents are stereotypically played out where the mother is already aware of and accepting of her son's homosexuality and the father is distinct and reluctant to the idea.  Having gone through several friend's coming out, I have to say that this is the way it usually is.

1064765,5,6305733651,"This highly realistic movie is the kind of film-making that the Brits excel in. Presumably made on a showstring budget, there is, however, nothing undernourished about the performances, scriptwriting or direction of this genuine classic.

Patrick Wilde has fashioned a hugely entertaining *and* thought-provoking screenplay from his play, What's Wrong With Angry? Yet to his credit, there is nothing stagey about this movie. Some of the kudos must go to first-time director Simon Shore, who has created a tightly paced (and often suspenseful) movie with one memorable scene after another. This is a film with real atmosphere - witness the way he lights the scenes in the swimming pool and the woods, with mood music to match.

But what makes the movie a masterpiece of its genre is the performance of its central actor, Ben Silverstone. This 18-year-old is an acting genius. He walks such a tightrope of emotions (some likeable; others less so), yet carries the audience with him at every turn. It's impossible not be drawn into his plight as he struggles to maintain his sense of self in an overwhelmingly heterosexual (and, at times, hostile) society. He is amazing, and it will be fascinating to follow what should be an outstanding career. His co-star, Brad Gorton, is good (notwithstanding the occasional awkward moment) but Silverstone's worthiest co-star is the wonderful Charlotte Brittain, in the role of his cheerfully fat confidante. The rapport between the two is a joy to watch, and Wilde provides them with some of the sharpest dialogue you're likely to hear in a youth-oriented movie.

The good that this movie will do for gay people struggling with self-acceptance is incalculable. Many have referred to Beautiful Thing as the superior film, but for my money Get Real has the script and magnetic performances to reach out to audiences both gay and straight in a way that no other film has achieved. It's simply the most accessible ""gay"" movie I've ever seen.

Why Ben Silverstone was not nominated for an Oscar is beyond me!",1000425600,15,2040,5.0266272189349115

""Get Real"" uses those late teenage years to present issues that can be awkward and distressing to confront at any stage of life.  Anyone who has ever faced the difficulty of hiding homosexuality, wondering about one's sexuality, or who has ever attempted to navigate a real love through a social minefield will be touched by this film.  Don't believe the promotional descriptions that call ""Get Real"" a ""comedy.""  There are some laughs, but, as in life, they result from ironies and surprises encountered when something serious is being pursued.  And, unfortunately, some of these attempts at humor are among those very few moments in this film that seem contrived.  Thankfully, though, the strong cast--especially Ben Silverstone--manages to hang on to the story even when the script falters.

It didn't cheat on the ending, but it sure did make me wish things could have turned out differently. I wanted to know what happened to the characters after the film ended. To me that's really what a good film and story does.
Ben Silverstone is only fantastically believable as the kid who is okay with his sexuality, but trying to hide it from the world.

The fact that his parents are sci-fi nuts isn't a plot point, but rather a part of the rich tapestry woven to make this film seem like ""a day in the life.""

innocence of teenage love can be pretty boring in your forties, but
this film never bored me (both visually and storyline) and made me
feel renewed when it finished. I enjoy a male-male love story when its

1065003,3,6305733651,"Don't get me wrong, I did like this film. However, it has its problems. Based on the very well written ""What's Wrong with this Play?"", there are too many monologues and unlikely elements to translate to a sceen version smoothly (one in particular where one of the characters relates his first almost sexual experience, which goes on so long that you just want to fast forward thru it). The story centers around Steve, a 16 year old thoroughly accepting of his own homesexuality and sort of a ""geek"", and John, the ""sex on legs"" school track star. John has never had a real sexual experience with a man, and, though very uncomfortable with his sexuality, very confidently picks up Steve in a public toilet in the park famous for one-off gay sex(one of the unlikely elements). John freaks out, however, after kissing Steve in his bedroom (why a guy who is comfortable enough to cruise a toilet would, I don't know), and he and Steve never quite get anywhere during their first encounter. Steve has been having sex in the park with older (mostly married ) men for ages, but this is the first time he has met anyone he harbors real feelings for. The only one who is aware of Steve's proclivities is Linda, written as the quintessential fag-hag (fat, loud, and slightly over the top in fashion sense), who worries about his adventures in the park. John gets drunk one night at a party, follows Steve home, and the two develop things from there....
This film may have been better for me had I not seen ""Beautiful Thing"", another teen-coming out story. Unlike ""Beautiful Thing"", the characters in ""Get Real"" all seem written with heterosexual stereotypes of gay characters (and their friends) in mind. John, the ""sex on legs"" track star, Steve, the ""pervert"" who frequents toilets in the park, Linda, the stereotypical fag hag. As they are all charicatures, you don't really get too sympathetic for any of them, and therefore don't get engrossed in the story. Finally, the two monologues, one by John describing his first semi-sexual encounter with a man, and one by Steve in front of his school assembly, presumably the two scenes designed to have the greatest emotional impact, fall absolutely flat since the actors themselves don't seem to know how to emotionally handle their own parts.
I strongly recommend that you see ""Beautiful Thing"" instead, or at least see ""Get Real"" before you see the better of the two. While both deal with teen coming out issues, ""Get Real"" is a bit too clichd, and might actually be more frightening than necessary, whereas ""Beautiful Thing"" deals with the subject in an almost realistic fashion, with more sensitivity expressed by characters with more than just two dimensions.",974592000,3,2704,4.829741379310345

The film tells  the story of Steven Carter, a closeted high school student diving into the  world of sexual discovery with men he meets at public bathrooms (all  implied, no action, which can be good or bad, depending on who you are). Hs  stress over being closeted (Steven is only out to his friend, the hilarious  Linda), accompanied by his quest to find love, interferes with his  schoolwork and family life, though never raising too many suspicions by  outside parties. By chance, Steven happens to meet a fellow student at the  public bathroom, a soccer jock by the name of John Dixon, and the two of  them become uncomfortable around each other until a school dance, at which  they become locked in a glance. This begins the start of their  relationship, and while Steven would like to make known his newfound  happiness, John insists that they must keep it underwraps or it is off. The  fun and the fears of coming out and closeted life play out hilariously and  surprisingly touching in this charming, witty comedy about the ills and  thrills of gay adolescence. Patrick Wilde's screenplay is brilliantly  directedby Simon Shore, and beautifully acted by top-notch young Brit  actors. Ben Silverstone gives a stellar performance as Steven, playing out  each emotion and feeling to perfection. The story will touch all those, as  well as give people a lesson in tolerance and acceptance.

1065112,5,6305733651,"For connoisseurs of gay themed cinema,GET REAL is one of the best achievements of this particular genre to come along for quite some time. Alternately funny and sad,this bittersweet tale of a gay male teenager coming to terms with his own sexuality and all the potential minefields that he must tread through along the way is both heartwarming and thought provoking. Most of us,gay or straight,can identify with the perils that we all faced in our own adolescent years;peer pressure,being popular or trying to be,secret crushes and sexual awakening. Ben Silverstone catches all of the intricacy and insecurities,ambivalence and trepidation perfectly. We find ourselves caught up in his quest for love and acceptance and alternately cry and cheer him onward as he finally comes to realize that love is a complicated and precarious undertaking. At the end though,the character that he plays,Steven Carter,has become stronger and more secure by publicly proclaiming to one and all who is and no longer putting up the facade that has become tiresome. This film is well written,directed and performed by a cast that from the largest part to the most minute goes together like the pieces of a puzzle that when fitted all together make a beautiful and memorable story. Truly a film not to be missed.",964310400,2,1292,5.070422535211268

I  think people who haven't gone through it can't appreciate how hard it is,  and they then cast it aside as less than important.  I found this film to  deal with a real life situation in a way that a lot of closet-cases would  love to have it.  Two boys meet, they fall in love, what could be more  perfect?

The gut-wrenching,  soul-shatteringly wonderful realization that there is more to sexuality  than sex--and that he has met someone to share it all with....
Steven  Carter and John Dixon, the star-crossed lovers of ""Get Real,""  might easily be the same person: both struggle to reconcile their awakening  gay-ness with the lives they're ""supposed"" to want.  Watching, I  resonate with each of them in turn.  Their two stories, each so similar to  the other's, are similar also to mine.  And yet their paths are not the  same.  So with each choice, with each triumph or mistake, I see my life not  only as it is, but also as it might have been.  Am I more like Steven,  valiant and reckless?  Or do I, like John, spend my life looking over my  shoulder, wondering whom I should be trying to please?
""Get  Real"" is not, finally, about growing up gay, or even about growing up  at all.  It's about choice--about choosing honesty and integrity or deceit  and half-truth, about choosing freedom or  security, about choosing to  live, or choosing simply to survive.

A gay teenager finds love in the arms of the school jock, but social pressures frustrate their budding romance.

A feel-good movie for gay teenagers (and their parents) everywhere! Bright narrative, instantly likeable characters, and a neatly-observed study of a relationship forged under extreme circumstances, this charming movie  balances its dramatic momentum with plenty of comic asides, though the narrative has been stripped of the political dimension which informed the stage play on which it's based.

Of course, it DOES help if  the hunk of your dreams (Brad Gorton) is wildly attracted to and completely  in love with you.  But, when only your Aretha Franklin-loving, horribly  stuck in the 80s, desperate-to-drive, ""cuddly"" friend Linda  (Charlotte Brittain - the epitome of ""fag hag"") knows about your  episodes pulling tricks with strangers in public toilets, it's hard to stay  quiet once you ARE in love.  You've got to hide it, keep it inside, even  though you're practically ready to shout it out to the world.  And that is  the predicament of young Stephen (Silverstone) in this amazing depiction of  falling in love and coming out as a gay youth in the 90s.  From being  worried about getting ""gay-bashed by squirrels"" to lamenting  about the ""sex on legs"" he thinks is SO inaccessible, and on to  averting the attention of female admirers away from him so he can focus on  what he truly wants, Stephen shows us the troublesome side of his secrets  but in a often humorous, and always heartwarming fashion.  His lover, John  Dixon (Gorton), gives us the side of fearing being out while still craving  a forbidden love in the worst way.  And, in the end, we may not be  completely happy with what we see, but we can only imagine what the future  holds for Stephen, John, and Linda.  All in all, this film is perfect.  Whether you're gay, bisexual, straight, or whatever, rent it a few times,  or buy it, and learn how beautiful falling in love can truly be.  Cheers!",952905600,4,1813,4.751612903225807
1065278,5,6305733651,"No wonder this film has prompted so many positive appraisals. The cast is perfect and comely. The story is gritty, witty, funny, touching, and true. It's about being in the closet (whether you're married or just in high  school), and the painful process of deciding to come out -- or not. Steve  (Ben Silverstone) knows he's gay but, isolated by his feelings, only has  secretive, anonymous sex. Johnny (Brad Gorton) is the handsome high-school  hero headed for Oxford. He is paralyzed by fear and loneliness, being so  deeply in the closet. They accidentally hook up in a public bathroom and,  despite Johnny's misgivings, eventually get together. Their moments of  private happiness -- understated, gentle, and sweet -- are among the  loveliest on screen. Affectionate and comfortable when they are alone, the  jock is also terrified that their 'secret' will come out, and he has a very  hard time dealing with Steve's gradual emergence from hiding. One hopes for  their union but can, at the same time, see the fall coming. Johnny is  ultimately a coward, his heroics on the sports field notwithstanding. The  straight men, in general, do not come off at all well. Steve's father is  withdrawn and unsupportive, though we are given to believe that he will  come around. The high school boys are, without exception, mindless jerks.  Certainly, Pre-Stonewall, Steve could never have 'come out' on film, much  less at his high school awards ceremony! But, that having been said, it is  apparently just as dangerous and terrifying for young people now -- in a  still-repressed, still-suppressed, and violently homophobic society -- as  it ever has been.

1065356,5,6305733651,"Get Real is one of the best films I have seen this year. It is wonderfully directed, and the acting is superb. The admixture of comedy and poignant realism treats a subject that is never approached in a hackneyed manner.  The young loves of the gays and the straights in the film make an  interesting counterpoint against each other. And then there is the creative  treatment of the young gay who early on accepts his homosexuality  juxtaposed against the young man who typically cannot accept his, and who  then resists, also typically, coming to terms with it.  The film reminded  me only too well of the ambivalent feelings I had in my youth when I, too,  had to come to terms with being gay. I, like Jon, tried everything to avoid  facing reality. But unlike Jon, I eventually came to embrace my  homosexuality in the manner that Steve does. But what a road trip that was!  The film immediately reminded me of some of the many encounters and  passions I had long since forgotten -- or so I thought.
This British  production is able to delve into this subject in a manner more honest than  most American productions would. No prurient sex scenes, but no Puritan  preaching either. Nothing shocking here, except a budding love affair  between two very young, and very inexperienced men. This film does cover a  now all too familiar subject, but it does it in a fresh new way. And you  won't be disappointed by the music either. Extremely entertaining, superbly  crafted, highly recommended.

1065358,5,6305733651,"Tense touchy topic meets a superb director's skills. The result, IMHO, the best-dramatized film of gay youth among the dozen existing. All controversial issues have potential drama in them--conflict, action,  suspense. But only the best novel writers or film directors employ the  potential to create work we don't just watch, we experience.
So here.  British highschooler Steven Carter is gay, meets ""questioning""  athletic classmate, gets involved, but Steve's secretive at home, dad is  puzzled, mom gradually puts pieces together, and then that anonymous  article on being gay submitted to the school paper, who write it, how will  Steve's would-be girlfriend react to his coming out to her, etc.....
But  that's just plot. Average artists just report plot, superior directors  recreate the dramatic tensions of it. Sure, homosexuality is laden with  drama if any subject is. (For Example: am I or am I not.....to come out or  not.....is he or isn't he.....""but he's getting  married!"".....duplicity: who knows, who doesn't, who suspects but do  they really.....I'm out to him but not to them....the powder-keg  atmosphere, will the straight athletes explode with fear? the tragicomedy  of errors, ""didn't Steve say he stayed overnight at YOUR house last  night, and if not, where....""Etc.)
All good grist for the mill. But  only a superior writer/director mines this raw material to create, not just  to claim, real experience. 9 out of 10 films don't do as well as here.  ""Beautiful Thing"" remains good, but.....!
So many audience can  enjoy this. (1) ""Crossovers."" Straight peers and parents. It's  less didactic, more engrossing, than ""Trevor."" And because it  doesn't discuss, but actually re-creates, the pain and the unfairness and  the fear and the joy and the isolation, the film is worth 10 brochures. (2)  All students of artistry--see how it's done, how skill translates emotions  onto the screen. (3) Anyone who loves well-done art. Which was surely me.  Which might be you too. You go and see now. All the way thru to the film's  slam-bang crescendo finale. Why not? Get reel!",952214400,4,2094,5.191616766467066

1065433,5,6305733651,"I have just finished watching ""Get Real"" for the second time. I found the story incredibly moving, the characters well developed, and beautifully acted.
The story is based upon Stephen, (wonderfully acted by  Ben Silverstone) who is a young gay secondary (high) school student in  Britan. Stepen encounters, by chance, the star athlete of the school he  attends, portayed realistically by Brad Gorton.  Boy meets boy---and with  some difficulty ---- they fall in love. However, admitting this is the  tough conflict of this movie.
Major themes of concern for gay youth are  covered in a realistic and an unbiased manner. Peer pressure, parental  concerns and misunderstanding, the necessity for ""clandestine  activities"" are all handeled in a reasonable and sensitive  style.
With all of the care and concern in this well written script,  along with the directors' sense of timing and detail, this movie is a must  see for anyone with concerns or interest in the area of gay youth or of  coming out.
Because of the nature of the subject, this movie was rated  ""R"" by the MPAA. The sexual content is minor, and there is some  language which might be considered offensive to some, however, I believe  none of the language was used unnecessarily.",951609600,8,1243,4.990243902439024

I plan on suggesting this film to my parents to help them deal with my coming out; that is how believable  and true to life the movie really is.  So if you want to watch a ""real""  movie that truly captures the emotions that all gay teens go through; ""Get  Real"" is a definite must: gay or straight.",951523200,2,487,4.172043010752688
1065435,5,6305733651,"Okay, On the surface I started thinking this film was Beautiful Thing all over again.  Then came the cruising in the bathroom at the park.  But, I would never do that! ;-)  So, anyway...I did love Beautiful Thing, But this  film is soooo much better.  It's well written.  The characters are more  like 30 stuck in the bodies of 16 year olds.  And as all of us who were  aware we were gay when we were teens know, that's exactly how it was.  We  were forced to mature much quicker than everyone else.  Heck, these kids  are more mature than half the 30 year olds I know.  I wish I would have  heard of this movie during it's theatrical release.  It would have been  great to see it on the big screen.  So, rent it or buy it.  Whatever, just  see it!",951350400,6,748,4.133802816901408
1065436,5,6305733651,"This film is excellent because it illustrates gay love in a respectable way. This movie isn't about only sex, like ""Edge of Seventeen"", it's about true, innocent love, like ""Beautiful Thing."" Except,  this film is 10 times better than ""Beautiful Thing.""
I loved  this film because I could relate to it on a small degree. Everything the  the characters do, I wish I had done with a perticular boy in high school.  But fear kept me from doing it. This film was my way to live out what I  didn't experience.
My boyfriend, on the other hand, was able to live out  what he desired. When the film was over, he was very upset. The film was a  direct parallel to his life. All the wonderful and exciting feelings of  love mixed in with the bitter reality of physical and emotional pain hit a  little bit to close to home for him.
Based upon our differing views, I  can say that this film will touch the lives of many people that see it. It  is inspiring to see two young men innocently in love with each other. The  film shows the kind of love that many gay men aspire to have in their own  life and it illustrates how stupidity and fear can cause complications in a  relationship.",951350400,25,1173,4.321100917431193
1065437,5,6305733651,"As someone with an open mind toward people who have a different sexual preference than my own I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  Ben Silverstone plays Steven Carter, a 16 year old boy stuck between a rock and a hard  place.  He attends a typical English high school where being gay is about  the last thing that he'd want to reveal.  But Steven feels a void in his  life that is there perhaps due to the fact that only one person knows his  secret.  His best friend and neighbor, Linda (Charlotte Brittain) keeps his  secret while supporting his choice to not tell his parents.  She worries  about his safety however, because the only place Steven can meet other men  like him is in the woods at a mens restroom.  One day while in the bathroom  Steven is passed a note through a small hole in the stall.  He and the  author of the note agree to meet outside.  Boy is Steven shocked when his  new friend turns out to be the high school track star and most beautiful  boy, John (Brad Gorton).  John and Steven begin an awkward romance, John  not quite sure if he is straight or gay and Steven wanting the world to  know how happy he is with John.  John seems to have real feelings for  Steven but is unsure if it is ""Okay"" to feel this way.  Steven  has a hard time being shunned by John in public and then adored in private.  The end of the movie adds a surprising twist that left me wanting to know  what happened to these characters.  I highly recommend Get Real to those  who are open to the subject matter.  The actors did a brilliant job,  especially Ben Silverstone.",951350400,11,1570,4.325259515570934
1065438,5,6305733651,"Between Get Real and Beautiful Thing (1996) I am thinking that Britain knows how to make great films with gay themes.  Movies like Jeffery & Trick are fun and all but for me they don't seem to strike those deep and  delicate chords that ring within the soul.  The movie Get Real is a coming  of age story about a 16 year old boy named Steven Carter. (played with  utter perfection by the rather talented Ben Silverstone.)  Steven longs to  be accepted for who and what he is and to make a life for himself more  meaningful than random bathroom encounters with other gay men.  Enter John  Dixon (played by Brad Gorton).  John is the school's track star and the one  ""hunk"" that every girl in the school (and one particular Steven  Carter) would give away their first born to date.  After an awkward  encounter in a park bathroom Steven finds that John may actually be more  ""family oriented"" than he appears.  What ensues is a wild ride of  self discovery for both Steven and John where ultimately their growing bond  of friendship & love help Steven to overcome his fears and be who he  really wants to be no holds barred. The only things that were minorly  irritating about this film is the placement of the comic relief in the form  of Steven's best friend Linda (played very believably by Charlotte  Brittain.)  After every intense scene we are thrown into a silly sequence  of Linda being...well...Linda.  One other complaint was the unconvincing  performance by Brad Gorton as the closeted and frightened John Dixon).  I  do not know if the actor was just out of touch with gay issues or what, but  I just wasn't buying his sincerity when he would speak his more deeply  moving lines. But let me assure that these are comparatively minor issues  and that this movie is definitely a great viewing.  For anyone who has ever  longed to cast aside all fear and inhibition and be your true self, its  time to get ""Get Real"".",951264000,21,1924,4.5588235294117645
