It has that ""Shaun of the dead"" feel about it, mixed with some of the absurdity that you get with Monty Python. The movie is about two visiting blokes from England who wake up while in New York City to find they are the only two people left and everybody else is gone, except for a demonic figure that seems to be stalking them.",1524441600,,412,4.036585365853658

8682547,5,B00O8J0KTK,"Two Brits decide to attend a Sci-fi convention in New York. They wake up in their hotel only to discover there is nothing on TV which is about as bad as the fact almost all of the people are gone. Ben (Nat Saunders) is clearly the dumber of the two as Stephen (Chris Hayward) plays the role as the straight man, setting up lines for Ben. There are a number of things going on. There is a blue monster trying to kill them, a creepy image on TV, and Ben meets a pretty female psycho-killer (Hannah Spear) in a straight jacket and wants to repopulate the planet with her.

The film had a number of great lines. I liked when they looked at empty NYC and hoped on meeting Will Smith of ""Legend"" and ask him why did he made ""After Earth.""

Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity. LOL funny.",1422835200,3,777,4.173333333333333

Their journey to find other survivors and answers to what happened takes them on a twisted, laugh and fright-packed caper...",1421798400,3,320,4.631578947368421
