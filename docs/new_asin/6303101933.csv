7839511,5,6303101933,This video has not verbal instruction.  All the instruction is watching Patty Sheehan's rhythm to the music.  Amazing how it will improve your golf swing.  Too bad it has never been put on DVD,1396051200,,192,4.588235294117647
7839512,5,6303101933,"As a beginning golfer with a similar build to Patty Sheehan, it was suggested that I study her swing. I found this video and have been watching it daily for about 6 weeks now. In addition to a weekly lesson from a local pro, the video has done wonders for my golf swing and confidence. The music from the tape ""plays"" in the back of my mind at lesson time. The viewer must realize however, that she needs to follow the simple instructions at the beginning of the tape. I wish I could find the audio cassette of the music on this video.",1007856000,3,535,4.203883495145631
7839513,1,6303101933,This video will make you want to SCREAM. It's so annoying watching a 1980's Patty Sheehan hit a ball over and over to nausiating music. I found it useless in terms of golf instruction. Don't waste your money.,998956800,2,208,4.5
7839514,5,6303101933,"Patti Sheehan's golf tape, with the examples it shows, is timeless!  I consider this tape  my most important game improvement tool.  I' m so glad it  is still available. I purchased it from Sybervision,16 years ago, when I was a 'beginning golfer'. Watching the tape, and putting what I learned into practice,made me very competitive in my first season of league play resulting in increased enjoyment of the game.  I still watch this tape to refresh my skills ,especially,  the night before an important match.
 Your age ,gender,or,  level of competency doesn't matter. I believe this tape should be in your golf tape library !",983318400,4,627,4.904761904761905
7839515,5,6303101933,This is the best golf video I've ever purchased.,970790400,,48,4.444444444444445
