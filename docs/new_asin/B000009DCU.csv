8363781,4,B000009DCU,"This is both the best and worst of what to expect in the world of low-to-no budget horror films. For the most part, the acting and directing are top notch, but the script(s) are what hurts the show. While taken as seperate entities, the various stories are fine, but thrown together, they never mesh together, and end up creating a quagmire of confusion in the process. It's not even the writers' faults, though, as the people behind the film intentionally set out to make a series of anthologies that were loosely linked, but not obsessively so (This is in fact the first of Lindenmuth's ALIEN AGENDA series).  Sasha Graham is perfect in her dazed role, and Scooter McCrae is hilarious as her inhuman benefactor. The rest of the roles are well suited to the actors, as well.
Overall, a very nice effort, but best taken in episode-sized chunks, as this type of film is best digested as seperate snacks rather than one cohesive meal...",971481600,2,934,4.695121951219512
