8069647,1,B0009XRZPG,Very dumb the plot didn't even make since it was all over the place don't buy it you will regret it.,1398211200,,100,3.8095238095238093
8069648,1,B0009XRZPG,What were they thinking?  I get the sense you had these guys who watched too much Tarantino and thought they could hatch up something violent but cool.  The movie seems misogenistic and the dialogue is poor.  I think high school kids could write better.  I give them credit for finishing the project but I'm sure they maxed out their credit cards to finance this loser.  Or maybe they didn't have to max cuz their trust funds helped them cover expenses.,1252886400,,453,4.6125
8069649,5,B0009XRZPG,"I had a free rental coming at the video store, and I just grabbed this because I was in the Halloween spirit. It's not really a horror movie, but sort of character study, so if you're looking for something like Saw, this isn't it, even though the cover suggests that. The movie reminded me a little bit of Boxing Helena.

It was made on a very low budget, there's a special feature that shows a local news show reporting on the making of the little independent movie being made in their city. As long as you're not expecting a big Hollywood production, and don't mind independent movies, you'll probably enjoy it.

Mary Skinner, the actress that played the girl being held captive in the basement, was very good, she's beautiful, but she has a natural look that sets her apart. I tried to find more of her work, but this is just about the only thing she's done, which is a shame, I hope she comes back to acting at some point.",1193443200,3,926,4.377906976744186
8069650,2,B0009XRZPG,"Here's a low budget film that just doesn't cut it. The first scene introduces the poor acting and the bad choice in 16mm film stock. Whatever stock they chose, it was the absolute worst choice for dark scenes!

The acting does get better as the movie slowly moves along, but it's not enough to save the viewer from cringing at the horrible cinematography, bad audio, and the cheap finale to the story (although, quite disturbing). There are much better thrillers shot on 16mm than this... try ""Primer"", ""Freak"", and don't forget the classic ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre""!

The biggest downfall here is the poor choice of film stock for this type of story. The grain in the dark scenes really gets in the way of the storytelling. This film could have earned 3 stars if it was shot on a VHS tape, even!",1154217600,,796,4.598591549295775
8069651,1,B0009XRZPG,"I wish I could have given this movie zero stars. It was the most boring, stupid, horrible movie ever!!!

Don't watch this one! It is a waste of time and money!!",1148860800,,160,4.161290322580645
8069652,5,B0009XRZPG,This a great movie that will leave you on edge of your seat,1145664000,3,59,3.6153846153846154
8069653,1,B0009XRZPG,"The girl is kinda cute.  Other than than, this is the most boring movie I have ever seen.  There is nothing in the movie that helps develop compassion or interest in the character except that he had a messed up childhood.  I must think that the people that gave this movie high ratings are teenagers who never had sex or been close with a girl.  This is about as close as they'll get.  There is no meaningful or interesting dialogue between the girl and the boy.  After 1 hour 30 minutes, I thought I'd might be in for a unexpected change but nope no meanginful dialogue unless you consider yelling, screaming, and putdowns to be meaningful (of course this may be meaningful if you've never had dialogue with a girl).",1139788800,,717,4.476923076923077
8069654,4,B0009XRZPG,"THE GIRL IN THE BASEMENT

WOW, Where to start...Great DVD box art, Title is better than Reindeer Games( imdb ),Alter Ego(commentary track) and nice plug about these filmmakers who went on to do a Project Greenlight  "" Battle Of Shaker Heights"". This do to  some behind the scenes drama, The director was killed after this film in a botched car-jacking and the others went on to do ONLY comedies. This is a good film and works well, Kyle Rankin & Mary Skinner as the leads are perfect. This movie needs to be nominated for best use of a Baby Monitor and that ""I've fallen and can't get up"" gizmo. You know it's even holiday-themed with this Sick Santa Icon. Sooo, If you looking for the early works of Project Greenlight winners-This film is very good and intense drama.",1133049600,3,769,4.557971014492754
8069655,5,B0009XRZPG,"There is alot of independent garbage being released these days, but GIRL IN THE BASEMENT is an excellent example of what can be done with a storyline, reasonable acting talent and no need for special effects, even on a low, low, low budget.

Hollywood should study this film to remind themselves that good filmaking does not mean 90 minutes of CGI animation and 3 minutes of plot/storyline...... but an interesting story that draws you end wanting to see what happens next should be the core of the movies, and effects are just icing on the cake.",1132272000,2,546,4.6875
