This was one of the bonus feature in season 7-9, there is no need to pay for this over price for 1 episode that is less than 60 minutes. I believe amazon right now is selling it for $37.99&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-Love-Lucy-The-Complete-Series/dp/B013FCLEIG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I Love Lucy: The Complete Series</a>.",1456444800,,426,6.237288135593221

8041187,4,B0002XMJ1I,Overall good DVD. The reason its getting 4 stars instead of 5 stars is because. I watched the entire special on YouTube. And then found when I got the DVD. That some of the original backround scenery was not showing. I also think they might have switched some parts around from the original film. But it is still a wonderful piece of history to view again and again!!,1308441600,,367,4.411764705882353
8041188,2,B0002XMJ1I,"Goodtimes has a lot of nerve charging 40 bucks for this low quality print.  For about 13 dollars LESS, you can get a better quality print of this PLUS all thirteen episodes of the Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour PLUS other bonus materials.  Yes, the ""I Love Lucy: The Complete Seasons 7-9"" DVD, which is currently available on Amazon for $27 includes this Lucy-Desi Westinghouse special as a bonus feature, and in perfect condition AND without the Goodtimes logo appearing on the screen.",1174089600,21,477,4.8765432098765435
