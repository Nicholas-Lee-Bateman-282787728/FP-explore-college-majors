4935747,3,B0063FGFCS,"The previous year's Royal Rumble had been a lot of fun with the 40-man gimmick. I really wish they would have done that again this year, because it was advertised as ""the most unpredictable Royal Rumble in history"" yet it was anything but. Of the thirty men that entered the Rumble, the vast majority of them were mid-carders with no hope of winning. Usually in these matches, there are around 7-10 entrants who you could see getting the victory, but on this occasion it was obvious that either Sheamus, Jericho or Orton would do it before they were even the last three left. Why wasn't Cena in this? I know Kane had hurt him earlier on, but everyone was supposedly eligible. They could have had Kane enter then Cena come in and eliminate him to further their story. Unnecessary maybe, but as I said, this was the most easily choreographed result you could imagine, so why NOT use the rest of the match to advance or create other feuds? The announcers all entering was amusing, but again, this was another reason they should have had 40 entrants again. It was just yet more filler. We knew they weren't going to stay in very long, and none of them really did anything while they were in there. Road Dogg entered as well, and barely did anything despite looking in good shape. Kharma entered, eliminated Epico, then got tossed out by Dolph Ziggler. What was accomplished here? Nothing! Unpredictability my arse. There were no major surprises, no uncertainty about the outcome, and not even that much excitement from the action itself until the admittedly brilliant final exchange between Jericho and Sheamus. It was as underwhelming a Royal Rumble as I can remember.

As for the rest of the show? I can barely remember it. The cage match was ok, but forgettable. The Cena/Kane match was ok, but forgettable (sensing a pattern here?), and there didn't appear to be much development in the rivalry since Kane just attacked Zack Ryder again and that was that. The WWE Championship match was pretty good, but the John Laurinitis stuff was a bit clumsy. Oh, and there was a squash match as well. A squash match on pay-per-view - one of the 'big four' pay-per-views, no less - and Drew McIntyre (aka Vince McMahon's hand-picked superstar) did the job in less than a minute, and appears to have gone the Ken Kennedy route. At least Brodus Clay is kind of funny, but I'd rather have just seen them enter the Rumble.

This isn't a horrendous event by any means, but given the quality of the last few Rumbles leading up to this, coupled with the quality of some of WWE's other events last year, this was a big let-down albeit with the right winner at the end.",1328832000,2,2648,4.619957537154989
4935748,3,B0063FGFCS,"Steel Cage Match: World Champion Daniel Bryan vs. Big Show vs. Mark Henry - A funny moment happened before the match where Big Show went to give his hat to a fan (Randy Orton's daughter) but he ended up scaring her to the point where Show had to laugh & say ""I know your dad.""  Show & Henry both used their heavy weight & strength advantage at various times like sandwiching someone between themselves & the cage, tossing & slingshotting Bryan into the cage, and Show's powerful shoulder tackle.  With Bryan being the smallest guy in the match, he tried to sneak out the cage but then resorted to his strength in wrestling like working over Show's legs to take him down while keeping both men down with various kicks, a tornado DDT from the top rope followed by the LaBell lock, and his superior speed that worked for him when trying to escape over the top.  It was a good match & one the best match between Show & Henry throughout their entire feud but one thing to pay attention to was the visual between Show & Bryan at the end as it showed the strength of Big Show being able to hold onto Bryan & even curl his arm with Daniel hanging off it.

Eve Torres, Kelly Kelly, Tamina, Alicia Fox vs. Beth Phoenix, Natayla, Bella Twins - There really wasn't much to say here past the fact that all the diva teams have matching outfits (Teal never looked better IMO) & Cole having a one liner directed at Booker T that I couldn't help but laugh at.  However the main story behind told here was re-establishing Beth Phoenix as the dominate diva towards the end where she just got fed up, gave an aggressive tag to her teammate telling her ""GET OUT OF MY RING!"" before taking care of business herself.

John Cena vs. Kane - Cena got his usual ""mixed"" reaction from the crowd as both men brawled in the ring to the floor & back in the ring.  Kane was very dominate & always able to keep fighting off Cena's offense while staying a step ahead of him.  Cena was able to make a comeback with being able to knock Kane off the top rope before doing his 5 Knuckle Shuffle from the top rope.  The brawl continued all the way backstage..to Zach Ryder's dressing room who was in a wheelchair wearing a back brace.  This was one of those matches that was more about continuing a storyline more than anything else as they were teasing a more aggressive Cena (who did embrace the hate) for weeks based off his actions on RAW but instead we got the same John Cena we're used to seeing with the same ending we've seen for weeks with Kane destroying Zack Ryder while Cena is unable to save him & has to deal with the aftermath.

Brodus Clay vs. Drew McIntyre - You got the same stuff you've gotten on free TV for a month now...Drew continues his losing streak while more time is spend on Brodus' dancing than the actual match.  Another thing they should have saved for TV, not a pay per view.

WWE Champion C.M. Punk vs. Dolph Ziggler with Johnny Ace (sorry but I can't spell his real last name if my life depended on it) as the special referee - Before the match, it was made clear that with Triple H appearing on RAW the next night to evaluate & possibly fire John from his position at RAW General Manager, John decided to make himself the outside enforcer while having a regular referee in the ring & even removed Vickie Guerrero from ringside.  Both men went back & forth throughout the match with some highlights being Punk's suicide dive onto Dolph on the outside, Dolph taking Punk's leg from under him while on the top rope causing a bad case of whiplash on Punk's neck, a series of counters & attempts that went from the sleeper to an anaconda vice back to the sleeper, and Punk countering the fameasser into a powerbomb that caused Dolph's head to bounce off the mat.  The match itself was nothing more than a backdrop to continue the storyline between Ace & Punk but unlike how Cena vs. Kane was earlier, these two delivered a really good performance in the match itself so if you can get past the storyline they were pushing & just watched the action, this was a good encounter & definitely the match of the night.

Royal Rumble Battle Royal - The Rumble returns to the traditional format of 30 men & had some highlights like The Miz facing his past, Ricardo ""Del Rio"" which got him one of the loudest pops of the night, Socko vs. Cobra, the fact that EVERYBODY was eligible for the match, Kofi Kingston having the most memorable ""saved himself from elimination"" moment, various returns including one that really scared Michael Cole, the performances of The Miz & Cody Rhodes, the homecoming of Randy Orton, and the battle between the final two.  This was one of those Rumbles that was missing a lot of things such as the heavy amount of main event/big name star power spread out throughout the match & the darkhorse that lasted longer than anyone expected but it did have it's entertaining & funny moments.  It's not one of the best Rumble's in history but I've seen way worse.

It should also be noted that throughout the night, they did two big video packages putting over both John Cena & The Rock in the buildup to their WrestleMania match.  The biggest issue here was that this PPV came off like a 3 Hour Pay Per View edition of RAW/SmackDown where we gotten things that we usually get on free TV with some stuff being things we have already seen or was shown for weeks before & after the event (the filler divas tag, the Brodus Clay squash, the long video packages for Rock vs. Cena, the ending & aftermath of Kane vs. Cena along with Punk vs. Dolph) with the best performances being the World Title matches while the Rumble was more about entertainment & comedic quality more than anything else.  In the end, this isn't a Rumble PPV that's worth going of your way to see but it's worth a rental as I would expect this type of booking for a show like ""Over The Limit"" but not one of original big four PPV's & definitely not when your celebrating the 25th anniversary (although that's technically next year but I digress) of the event.",1328486400,6,6029,4.418394950405771

4935750,4,B0063FGFCS,"The 3 way Steel Cage Match for the Worlds title(Daniel Bryan vs Big Show vs Mark Henry) while a pretty good cage brawl, it should have gone longer then under 10 minutes. The 8 Diva Tag Team Match(Beth Phoenix,Natalya & The Bella Twins vs Kelly Kelly,Eve,Alicia Fox & Tamina) was passable even though some of the Divas didn't get enough screen time. The John Cena-Kane match was a pretty good brawl but it was ruined when they fought outside for too long thus ending in a double countdown. The Drew McIntyre-Brodus Clay match was a stupid & mindless filler. The WWE title match between CM Punk-Dolph Ziggler was a solid & entertaining bout even with John Laurinaitis as Guest Ref who played that part very well by the way. This Year's Royal Rumble match was a entertaining,fun,smash-mouth bout that lived up to the unpredictable nature from the appearances of Mick Foley,Jerry Lawler,Booker T,Jim Duggan,Ricardo Rodriguez,Kharma,Road Dogg Jesse James and even Michael Cole to Sheamus(Not Randy Orton) winning the Rumble match. I bet alot of the St. Louis fans were real mad when that happened. I give this PPV a 8 out of 10",1327795200,,1122,4.818652849740933

ROYAL RUMBLE 2012

There were some interesting storylines going into this Rumble and even if there wasn't I would have been all about it. You see this is my favorite event since I love the actual Rumble match, plus I have always loved battle royals of any kind. I even loved WCW's ""World War 3"" event. Any way I like this event over all, not as good as others but not the worst.

1.[WORLD TITLE TRIPLE THREAT STEEL CAGE MATCH]DANIEL BRYAN VS MARK HENRY VS BIG SHOW-I was honestly surprised that this match opened up the show. But the more I think about it I just realize they do not treat this title with the respect it deserves. Any way I really enjoyed this opening match as the story between the three was fun. Show and Henry displayed their power throughout the match as Bryan worked on chopping the bigger men down. The smashing up against the cage and such were excellent and Bryan trying to sneak out only to be caught was great. Still in the end Bryan defies the odds and keeps his belt.

2. NATALYA, BETH PHOENIX, THE BELLA TWINS VS EVE TORRES, KELLY KELLY, TAMINA, ALICIA FOX-another match in which they team all the divas together just to get them on the card somehow. The match itself is pretty good compared to others but to be honest it is always Beth and Natalya that keep me interested here. There is some good action here like the diving onto everyone outside moment but it is Beth that ends it and ends it quick.

3. JOHN CENA VS KANE-I was really wishing that a few certain things were going to play out with this storyline. First I wanted Kane to continue to be a destructive killer ever since he came back, I loved that he was back in the mask. Secondly I was kinda hoping that Cena would go heel because of this feud and embrace the hate. Based on the storyline with Zach I liked that this match was more of a brawl, it made sense. Kane was very dominating in this match controlling most of it laying into Cena with power moves and fists. Still Cena stayed in the game even delivering a top rope 5 knuckle shuffle. The match eventually spills onto the outside in which both men get counted out. This is a fight so they don't care as the fight all the way backstage leading to Kane finding Zach Ryder and destroying him as usual. Cena makes one last attempt at helping his friend but is chokeslammed by Kane for his troubles.

4. BRODUS CLAY VS DREW MCINTYRE-I am still disappointed that Drew was put on this long loosing steak because this dude could be big in my opinion. I have been enjoying Clay and the funk like I enjoyed Flash with his Funk [who else remembers?] so this was fun for what it was. This was a squash match to help put over the funk, a really quick one, poor Drew.

5.[WWE TITLE]CM PUNK VS DOLPH ZIGGLER-John Laurinaitis was the special referee for this match and man do I miss him as the GM. I can't help it I thought he was great in the role, of course we would come to find out that he made himself the special enforcer and not ref before the match. This of course was because Triple H was coming to Raw the next night to evaluate him. Any way two of my favorite wrestlers would go at it here so I knew this would be a good match. Before the match starts John sends Vickie to the back which was kinda upsetting because I love her as a heel manager. Any way just as I thought this was the best match on the card as both men go all out. This is a back and forth match with highlights throughout like Punk catching a little whiplash. I liked how this match played out including Johnny helping with the three count to see Punk keep his title. Loved the Randy Savage chants.

6. ROYAL RUMBLE-now of course the thing everyone looks forward to when this event comes around, the rumble match itself. Like always the Rumble was fun like it always should be but it didn't feel as epic as it should. Still I did enjoy it like the Socko/cobra showdown and Kofi Kingston displaying the best save from being eliminated since Morrison. There are some good eliminations, the announcers get involved, and Kharma comes back, over all it was a fun time. I really loved Road Dogg Jesse James coming back and showing that he still has it.

Special features include interviews from the event and of course moments and matches from Raw and Smackdown.

BONUS MATCHES

1. CM PUNK, JOHN CENA VS DOLPH ZIGGLER, JACK SWAGGER-this was a match from the Raw before the Rumble. This was actually a pretty good match from Raw and it was cool to get this as a bonus since I like all of these guys. The pace is great and moves along nicely but the story here is Ziggler getting another pinfall over Punk.

2. KANE VS ZACH RYDER-this was the match on Raw that would see Kane demolish Ryder and put him in a wheel chair. Kane dominates the match with Ryder trying come back every once in a while. In the end Kane would chokeslam Ryder threw the stage and then set his sights on Eve. She is saved when Cena makes his way out.

3. ALEX RILEY VS BRODUS CLAY-this like many of Clay's matches is a squash match meant to get him over. It's cool I guess since you get to look at the girls but Riley was run over in this match.

4. BIG SHOW VS MARK HENRY-this match is another short one from Smackdown that helped push the storyline with Bryan. He comes out of course which is why the match is so short but it was entertaining to say the least.

This is a great Blu-Ray set that features some other moments from the Raw & Smackdown before the PPV. Also included are some interviews from the actual event and such so this is a good buy. I would highly recommend this Blu-Ray if you are a fan of the WWE.",1344470400,,5605,4.270499528746465
4935777,5,B0063FGFCS,This DVD played perfectly. The PPV itself was alright. A few things that were pointless to put in the show. A few surprises as well. I would recommend this.,1341360000,,156,4.413793103448276
4935778,4,B0063FGFCS,"Steel Cage Match: World Champion Daniel Bryan VS Big Show VS Mark Henry: Bryan's feud with Big Show was one of the worst feuds of all time. Rather then show Bryan's Bret Hart type skills, WWE puts him in feuds against the worst opponents. I don't really him winning too many matches as a champion. Anyways, this match was pretty good and Bryan escapes with the belt once again.

Some diva's eight woman tag match, skip as always.

John Cena VS Kane: I'm not going lie, this match was going pretty damn good and out of the blue, both men leave the ring and get counted out. Kane attacks Zack Ryder backstage, brings him out, and tombstones him in the ring. Yea, WWE isn't known for good storylines anymore.

Brodus Clay VS Drew McIntyre: I'll admit at first Clay's gimmick was amusing, now it's just old. Nothing really to see here, just the same old crap from Clay.

WWE Champion CM Punk VS Dolph Ziggler with John Laurinaitis as guest ref: Ziggler has the looks and talent to be a world champion but alas, he is just another in the long line of should have beens in the past WWE decade. A very good match, Lauri..sorry I don't care to spell it again so i'll call him Johnny. Johnny has his job on the line so he doesn't interfere and even counts the three at the end. Two years in a year Ziggler has a world title shot, puts on a good match, but can't quite win it. Speaking of shoulda beens, isn't there always on authority figure in WWE in the past decade that makes people turn off Raw? I mean you got two now that make me turn of Raw- Michael Cole and Johnny Ace. God, Vince really needs to wake up and see what he is turning his company into.

Royal Rumble: Miz starts off with a promo saying he'll win it. It wasn't a star studded Rumble with all annoucers getting involved, Kharma, Jim Duggan, Mick Foley, and Road Dogg returning. Not bad but it shows you what shape WWW is in. Sheamus wins it then goes on to win the belt in 18 seconds at WrestleMania 28.

Overall, not a bad PPV but nothing i'd call must see. The blu ray comes with 8 bonus matches but there is really only 3 actual matches as the rest are just interview segements. The blu ray sells for under $10 at same places, if you can get it for that price, then yea it's worth it.",1337126400,3,2248,4.228438228438228
4935779,5,B0063FGFCS,"the royal rumble is my favorite event of the whole year and has been since its birth in 1988.
here are the matches and what i think of them
im not even sure these guys were.just a guy who looks like an inflated hugh morris wailing on someone much smaller than himself.the match was very very quick.[6 stars].ok but intense while it lasted.
2-a bunch of chicks doing battle.it was normal girl fight stuff.natalya gets very angry late on.i wonder why she didn't just use that anger from the begining.[6 stars].better than average.
3-cm punk vs dolph ziggler.im wondering if this one wasn't racist.cm punk with his jewish stars all over his trunks and boots like some walking advertisement for judaism not to mention g.i. joe and pepsi.is he a wrestler or a jewish nascar driver?anyhow,he was battling a guy supposedly from germany with his german name and bright blonde hair.even though its obviously dyed.the match was good throughout despite a cheating ref and vicki guierro.[7 stars].super!
4-daniel bryan vs big show vs mark henry in a steel cage match.mark henry got hurt and laid around for 99% of the match.the rest was just big show playing cat and mouse with daniel bryan.[6 stars] very good but could have been far better.
5-john cena vs kane.john cena spent the majority of his time getting beat down.rise above hate?rise above the ring with a sniper rifle because that would be the only way he'd win this one.kane unleashes his sadistic side later on.i noticed kane has a mask back on.its because he was so ugly the wwe universe wanted him to put it back on.
 [6 stars] but just barely.
6-the royal rumble match.it was a great one. 3 former winners were in.hacksaw jim duggan,big show and randy orton.there were A LOT of suprise competitors.i know you think you've seen everything but kofi kingston does something that has NEVER been done in a rumble before.its mind blowing.the 3rd ever girl enters.even big show and dolph ziggler came down despite having both been in tough matches earlier .[8 stars].a classic!
i would definately urge  you to buy this video.",1333584000,,2071,4.798319327731092
