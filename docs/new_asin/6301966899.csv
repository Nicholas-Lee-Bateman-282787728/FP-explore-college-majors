415033,4,6301966899,"Blue Steel is entertaining. I believe you have to be a Jamie Lee  Curtis fan to appreicate this movie. The actress performance
was good, but the story line wasn't as good.",1035504000,,171,4.516129032258065
415034,2,6301966899,"Blue Steel is Katherine Bigelow's second Hollywood feature as a director, and it has many of the same consistency problems as her subsequent movies, great action, interesting characters, but a fumbled last act where everything turns to stupid.
I'm anticpating the release on DVD of Blue Steel, however because it makes a great companion to the recent DVD of the cult movie ""Near Dark"", her debut. ""Near Dark"" is her take on a vampire movie (though vampires are never mentioned in the movie, and they don't have fangs). Blue Steel is Bigelow's werewolf movie, and is enjoyable on that level. I hope the DVD will have some of the detail the release of ""Near Dark"" had.",1033948800,,666,4.75
415035,1,6301966899,"A ""friend"" recommended this movie, and so I rented it. The next day I wish I had some cold, sharp steel to run through his scrawny, lousy-reviewing heart. Oh, the headache this movie gave me! And that lousy dialogue will haunt me 'till the day I die.
There was a scene in this movie where Jaime Lee is telling her captain how she's going to get the bad guy. I'll paraphrase and embellish to give you an idea what you're in for if you rent this turkey:
J.L.: Captain, I'm going to get him! I'm going to shoot him with my gun and bullets!
Captain: Okay, Jaime Lee, relax.
J.L.: No captain, I'm going to kill him! He's going to--
Captain: All right Jaime Lee, I get the point.
J.L.: No captain! I'm going to shoot him dead--
Captain: Shut the @#*!&# up!
And believe me, that was one of the high points.
However, this movie has influenced my life. For example, when a ""friend"" called me to ask how a date turned out, I told him it was like Blue Steel. I guess you can figure out how lousy my night was.",971740800,7,998,4.176165803108808
415036,1,6301966899,"An NYPD rookie and her partner match wits with a not-so-bright homicidal lunatic (Silver) in this farcical ""thriller.""
Silver's one-dimensional character is so vile and despicable that we become too  infuriated to be scared. Despite the substantial time focussed on him,  there is little character development, no past, no context, no  meaning--nothing to make him an interesting or awesome character. Because  we don't expect him to do anything else but kill like a homidical robot  from the start, suspense is nil.
Not once do any of the characters  act out of rationality or common sense. The story itself completely lacks  common sense. Too bad Jamie Lee Curtis's best performance to date had to be  in such a turkey of film.",958867200,5,729,5.016666666666667

415098,4,6301966899,"I think I saw this movie years ago.  At least the opening scenes were very familiar.  However, it was still a very exciting and disturbing movie.  Ron Silver was brilliant in portraying a psychopath and Jamie Lee Curtiss did a decent job as well.  If one describes in any detail the plot, it would undermine the enjoyment of this thriller, except to say that J L C is a rookie cop who happens on an armed robbery of a grocery store.",1483660800,,432,4.296296296296297

415164,3,6301966899,This isn't a straight ahead action cop movie.  It is more of a pshycological type story.  Sort of like Tightrope with Clint Eastwood but not.  Jamie Lee Curtis is very good.  She plays a rookie cop just out of the academy who sees an armed robbery in progress.  When the suspect won't lay down his weapon she has to take him down.  But then during the investigation they cant find his gun.  Which one of the witnesses took.  And it goes from there.  There is a sub plot sub plot involving her abusive Father and a little romance thrown in too.  This isn't a movie for everybody.  But I thought it was good.,1480464000,,606,4.274336283185841

415338,1,6301966899,"I was expecting a decent action movie, but instead got a poorly written and edited urban horror movie.

Nothing about the plot made any sense at all. The concept isn't terrible, but every detail is cringe-worthy. Take the first major scene which sets up the rest of the movie ...

--- Possible spoilers ahead although it is only a few minutes in. ---

If you're in a shootout and a man ends up dead, why are you not securing the weapon and making sure that eye-witnesses don't just walk away from the (brightly lit, indoor) scene of the shooting? I'm not a police officer and I have no training at all, but that's what I would do immediately. Does nobody have any sense in this movie? Also, watch that scene again. There is a Dirty Hairy gun in the cashier's face for more than three minutes and he supposedly tells the cops that he thinks it might have been a knife? I'm pretty sure the first, biggest, scariest thing you would remember about having a gun pointed at you is when you realized there is a gun pointed at you! You can't later reflect on it and think ""well maybe the guy was just pointing excitedly at a pack of Marlboros with a comb."" Even the main character who was so observant as to see the robbery gearing up from across the street before it even happened and says she saw what looked like a .44 revolver, almost immediately admits that she shot the robber when she saw a ""glint."" Please! A .44 caliber glint? Plus there were at least three other witnesses right there not including the guy who somehow sneaks away. This is just part of the stupidity of the first 15 minutes, but I think you get the point.

Was it just our pre-9/11 innocence or is this the product of waking up from the cocaine-dusted 80s and trying to juggle 12 steps while making a movie a tight schedule?

Technical incompetence aside, I hated the characters. All cliche and no depth or development. The only remotely charming person in the whole story  is the villain. And after seeing the first act of this movie, I don't blame him for becoming a schizophrenic psychopath murderer.",1478476800,2,2072,4.468253968253968

415814,5,6301966899,"This was almost more of a horror movie than a thriller, with supernatural elements. I'm only writing a review to clear up some things about the story written by reviewers who gave the movie 1 star, mostly because it seemed that they didn't understand the movie they had just seen. It makes sense that they might not understand it because it isn't a standard ""Hollywood"" movie: they simply may have never been used to a story told this way, with this pacing, or this level of thought or analysis to it. Nothing was dumbed down or laid it out for you directly. You were supposed to be gathering the story through context and the characters' environments and behaviors. The movie never out-and-out directly tells you, ""this is why this is happening."" It takes a little bit of thought. (A word of caution, this review contains many spoilers.)

Character development didn't clobber you over the head. A very great part of the movie was about the transformation of the villain (Silver). In the beginning, he is a man who made his money at the stock exchange. His profession and lifestyle and aggressive tactics at work, which were smoothly and quickly laid out before the audience, were intended to describe his character. We learn his obsession with money is actually his obsession with power after he witnesses a criminal getting gunned down by a cop (Curtis). Before he becomes a murderer, Eugene's life is threatened by a thief with a gun in a convenience store. It is in this moment that he realizes the power of the fear of death, firsthand. When the cop, Megan, guns down the thief, he has an epiphany: death can be defeated by whomever kills first. We don't know, but it may have been the first time Eugene ever even thought about dying. Watching Megan take down the gunman, who represented ""death"" to Eugene (in that the gunman was threatening to kill Eugene), ""inspired"" Eugene's lust for power to turn towards killing. It may have also been the trauma of almost being killed. Eugene pockets the thief's gun, the very gun that could have killed Eugene, and begins a fixation with it and with killing random people.

After a few random murders, Eugene becomes demonically possessed. There is a scene of him ""hearing"" voices talking to him, telling him he's God. He orally translates the message he's hearing. One could argue he was schizophrenic, but considering he only hears the voices after he begins murdering people. He uses almost religious, spiritual language as he orally speaks the message he is receiving, which we can assume, based on his life that seems totally devoid of spirituality and dedicated to money, that this is new language, a new way of describing things for him. In other words, the movie implies the message aren't coming from his own mind. After these ""messages,"" his murders take on a new, ritualistic feel to them: he kills a prostitute, for example, and gets off by rubbing her blood-soaked clothes on his naked body, after she is already dead. He had previously been clothed, leading the viewer to think that he didn't even have sex with the prostitute. It's a sequence of events very similar to what one would see in a supernatural thriller or exorcist movie. His attacks on Megan also become intense and unrelenting, and almost surreal and dream-like. This was something I completely didn't expect to see, but as a horror movie fan (especially of Italian horror movies, which often incorporate a ""dream like"" feel to them), it was an amazing surprise. However, it wasn't just written for horror movie fans: his possession is also essential to the plot and the theme of the characters' lives, which is power. In the course of his desire for power, which led to an interest in the power over life and death through murder, Eugene has lost all of his own personal power by opening himself up through his murders to having his will supernaturally possessed. Therefore he no longer has any power over himself because he has lost control over his will, actions, mind. He is working completely for evil, there is no more ""Eugene,"" per ce, and therefore he has lost all of his power.

Throughout the movie, Megan is asked numerous times why she became a cop. She always gives a flippant answer, after a pause (which indicates she's thinking of an answer to give other than the direct truth). In other words, you can't answer why she is a cop based solely on her words, you have to figure it out for yourself, through context. Slowly throughout the movie see her home life: her father has an anger problem and beats her mother regularly. We see she never got married, never established many relationships, and we start to piece together who this woman is and why she is a cop. She obviously comes from a broken home, never witnessed a positive relationship between a man and a woman so never was good as establishing her own relationship, but had a supportive mother so could make a close female friend. It's basic psychology, how early development at home translates to future relationships. She says she wanted to be a cop from the time she was young, and we can start to figure out its because, perhaps, neighbors called the cops on her father once or twice for domestic disturbance, or she saw a cops TV show and saw people doing something to stop violence, the kind of violence she witnessed against her mother by her father. Its easy to see that Megan wanted power: power over her father, power over people like her father, power to stop violence against other people.

Both Megan's and Eugene's lives and careers are shaped by their desire for power: Megan wanting power over people who want to hurt others, and Eugene wanting power for his own personal gain without regard to who he hurts in the process. This common theme in both of their lives is made point when Eugene tells Megan, during one of his ramblings, that they are two halves to one whole. They both desire power, and he sees that, but because he never gave any thought to helping others, probably in his whole life, he can only see part of Megan. He can neither see nor understand her completely. This contrasts with the character Nick, the detective who, because he also wants to stop evil in the world, can truly connect with Megan.

The fact that we have no backstory for why Eugene wants power may be to intentionally show that the reason is because of his own shallow-ness as a human being. He may simply be a narcissist or a sociopath, which would be in line with his deterioration, and not be as deep a person as Megan. Because of the thoughtfulness of the character development, script and environment (every moment of the movie works to telling you who these people are and why these things are happening to them), I don't doubt that things left out of the story, such as references to Eugene's childhood, are to tell us something, as well.

The relationships between the characters is also something to indicate their shallowness or depth and are therefore very important symbolically. Eugene and Megan initially have a relationship but it is based off of nothing, it is shallow. It is based completely on him saying how much he thinks she's beautiful, how much he loved her at first sight, flowery language--""sweet nothings""--thrown her way, and sensational thrills he can purchase for her. There's no deeper relationship, no shared interests, nothing in common. This contrasts later with the relationship between Nick and Megan, who share everything deep, everything in common, and all loyalty and trust, even if they share absolutely nothing sensational or flowery or outwardly ""romantic."" The sex scenes are also symbols in themselves of these themes: Nick and Megan have consensual passionate sex, whereas Eugene rapes Megan, which is an emotionally shallow, selfish, violent act. It was interesting that even the sex scenes were not there to merely be titillating but were symbols of these reoccurring themes, indicated especially by their close proximity to each other (which was supposed to hit the viewer over the head with the contrast between the characters, their life meanings and choices, and who they are).

The final showdown between Megan and Eugene was shot, edited and directed perfectly. It was like a dream, a nightmare. Megan hadn't slept much in a few days and the movie looked just like the world looks when you haven't slept that long. She had undergone tremendous stress and the ending also reflected a disassociation from reality that a person experiences when they have undergone tremendous, impossible stressors. I didn't know if anything was really happening or if it was a going to end up being Megan's dream, quite like it would be for the main character in an under-slept, over-stressed state. Events seemed surreal as they unfolded, but when you realized what had just happened, it was standard action movie events, just told in a different way. This took tremendous guts as a film maker to do because there would undoubtedly be people who didn't understand it or think about it and so got frustrated over it. Eugene also appeared and disappeared like a puff of smoke, almost, from Megan's torn down perception, like a supernatural being more than like a man.

I watch a lot of Italian horror movies and sometimes American viewers who don't understand their method of storytelling get confused by continuity. Like, in Dario Argento movies, Americans wonder, ""why is this character doing this, why are they going to slowly, how could this possibly happen?"" The point of his movies are to describe events in a dream-like state that inspire horror in the viewer. Much like a terrible nightmare where you can't do anything correctly to save yourself and you find yourself in strange situations without knowing how you got there.

Similarly, ""Blue Steel"" is told in a unique way that viewers used to Hollywood movies might not understand, only with this movie, scenes, environments and characters aren't set up to create a dreamlike state to frighten the viewer, they are set up to tell a message, make a point, and establish scenes. If you are wondering why Megan is doing this, or this scene is happening right after this other scene, keep watching and keep thinking about the themes throughout the movie, how each scene contrasts with other scenes similar to it, how each character contrasts with other characters, and what each tiny detail is telling you about the overall message about good and evil, and what power and strength really are, that Bigelow is trying to get across.

The mood, cinematography, editing and script don't waste a second, a scene, an environment, or any of your time. The script is so carefully and perfectly balanced and the actors carry their parts. Many people have said this is Curtis' best acting job. If you are studying storytelling or film making, I definitely recommend this movie.

If you are just looking for a simple cop action movie thriller (like I was), be prepared for a much deeper, larger, more literary and artistic story than you expected.",1428451200,13,11027,4.813720316622692
415815,4,6301966899,"This film is obviously dated but I did very much like this movie, & found it worthy among other action police themed crime fighting dramas which had received critical acclaim.

The late Gene Siskel had problems with this movie when he expressed his very obvious concern or question du jour, asking the SAME puzzling rational I had originally asked as to why the late Ron Silver's character suddenly became a violent psychopathic serial killer????

 The amazing Jamie Lee Curtis, (star of other fantastic movies like Trading Places, Halloween, True Lies), stars as a young rookie lady NYPD officer who unfortunately responds to a vicious 7-eleven robbery, where a younger Tom Siezmore (Saving Private Ryan) holds up the clerk for quick cash.  The robber has in his possession a .44 Magnum revolver & attempts to murder Officer Curis, but her gun slinging skills are quicker, putting some nice pieces of hard lead into the suspect preventing a robbery and homicide, killing Seizmore's criminal character dead.  When the handgun falls to the store floor, a shopper who rightly ducts down during the crime scene suddenly finds himself face to face with the loaded weapon, where he grasps the gun into his own possession only to later decide to use it in his own deadly crime spree around New York.

 Curtis's character is a very sexy, single, dynamic attractive young woman who works in a rougher career field, at the time, that traditionally had been occupied by mostly men.  This issue comes up as Curtis attempts the dating scene finding she has more testicles and courage then many of the lame men she meets.  But in no time she is swept off her feet by a charming, smart, suave NYC Wall Street themed gentleman in the late actor Ron Silver (who clearly is not what he appears to be on the surface).

 I saw this movie years back when I was younger, and watched it again recently very much enjoying the film and finding it an excellent police thriller.

 But the ultimate question continues to haunt the plot of the movie, ""Why does this obviously smart, established, higher end business man magically becomes transformed into a violent shooter and hunter of the innocent just because he acquires a robber's handgun?""

 Siskel also brought up the point that he found the meeting, and love affair between the good cop and the hidden serial killer seemed contrived and ultimately unbelievable.  How would these two people who live in different worlds in the biggest city on the planet, who are in reality the primary dueling opponents among this crime drama some how meet and become quick romantic partners?  But never the less I did very much like the portrayals of the extreme ends of both the force of law enforcing avenging good verses the sadistic predator brutality of pure evil displayed through Silver's act.

 If you enjoy other epic crime action drama films like ""Dirty Harry"", ""Death Wish"", & cop dramas like ""NYPD Blue"" or ""New York Undercover"" you might really like this movie too.  Thumbs up at B+ for ""Blue Steel"".",1427500800,,3027,4.829457364341085

415817,1,6301966899,"I am a Jamie Lee Curtis fan so naturally I disregarded the bad reviews and gave this movie a try. I wanted to like this movie, I really did. Unfortunately, the one star reviewers here are right. I've seen some bad movies in my day and I'm sad to say that this is one of them. I'm the kind of person who hates not to finish a movie so I always suffer through, no matter how much agony I'm in, but I thought about not finishing this one many times. Jamie's character is so annoying you just want someone to punch her in the face. I actually rooted for her to die at the end; that's how done I was with this movie. The actor who plays the bad guy does a really good psycho, but that's about the only positive thing I can say about the film. Let me be clear though, just because he played his part well does not mean that I wasn't annoyed with him too. I was annoyed with the whole movie and I yelled at the moronic characters throughout the film. I'm really disappointed that I will only get a couple hours of sleep tonight because I decided to watch this movie. It wasn't worth my time. Blue Steel is not worth anyone's time. Even if you get this movie free (like I did watching it on Prime), it's not worth the price. Your time is far too precious; even if you use it to blankly stare at a wall for an hour and 40 minutes.

I find myself drawn to this movie whenever I see it coming around on TV, and it's saved to my prime because it's fascinating to watch and the acting is impeccable given the material. Ron Silver's turn as the  burgeoning serial killer is fascinating...his choices are scarily unpredictable, and we never know what exactly is going on with him. Is he hearing voices? Is he the craziest stalker ever? Did he kill cats in his childhood? These unanswered questions and Silver's take on the character make him very frightening.

Curtis and Brown have very convincing chemistry and Curtis is very believable as a stressed out, directionless rookie cop from a dysfunctional family. The culmination of events strains belief, and smacks of a writer desperately trying to get herself out of the back alley she backed herself into (I don't actually know if the writer is female or male, honestly). But Bigelow's visual choices are deliberate and telling, from the opening title shots of a revolver and the careful shots of both the rookie cop's and the killer's obsession with the gun as an instrument of vengeance. She was flexing her muscles her to make those connections with the character's psyche, and that's what brings me back to this movie.

415964,2,6301966899,"Academy Award winner Kathryn Bigelow (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hurt-Locker/dp/B00275EGX8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hurt Locker</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Point-Break/dp/B004OBQDHK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Point Break</a>) co-wrote and directed Blue Steel (1989), a violent and very pretentious crime drama that loses touch with reality quite early, pushes matters to extreme levels, and by the finish has completely flown off the rails.  There's plenty of action, and bold attempts to pump up the tension, but few signs of any intelligent thought, in the poorly written screenplay that incorporates nearly every trick in the book, to feature a badass female cop.

Fresh out of the academy, New York City police officer Megan Turner (Jamie Lee Curtis,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Halloween/dp/B000UR9QHQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Halloween</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/True-Lies/dp/B00026ZG10/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">True Lies</a>) is on patrol with her partner, when she discovers a robbery occurring in a store.  She confronts a man who is holding a gun on a cashier, and shoots him when he fails to put down his weapon.  The robber's revolver falls on the floor, where it is secretly taken by stockbroker Eugene Hunt (Ron Silver,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Timecop/dp/0783225520/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Timecop</a>), who was shopping in the store.

Hunt leaves the crime scene with the weapon.  Lacking physical evidence, Turner is suspended, but after the mentally unbalanced Hunt kills a stranger, and leaves behind bullet casings with Megan's name scratched on them, police detective Nick Mann (Clancy Brown) has Turner reinstated with the rank of detective, so she can work the case.

Firmly fixated on Megan, Hunt begins a relationship with her, while he continues to kill in her name.  The movie takes a dramatic turn near the halfway point, when Hunt unexpectedly reveals himself to Turner.  The remainder of the film features Turner and Mann attempting to bring Hunt to justice, as the stockbroker displays an uncanny ability to stay several steps ahead of the police.

Credibility is an early casualty, as Blue Steel is built upon a series of unlikely events, that become increasingly ridiculous, as a green rookie cop with a bad attitude, almost instantaneously has the confidence of an experienced detective, and the balls to break protocol when it suits her purpose.  Things get increasingly personal after Hunt reveals himself, as he zeros in on her friends and family.  Turner is incapable of saving a friend from harm, but she's like a manic when she has a gun in her hand.  Being able to cut loose and overplay their roles was probably a blast for Silver and Curtis, and the movie is entertaining for a while, but if reality matters, at a certain point, it all gets to be too much.

Not unlike a myriad of other violent crime dramas from the era, Blue Steel entertains in a superficial and pretentious way.  Featuring a female as the lead character was different for 1989, but the implausible clich heavy story, fails to make Blue Steel the groundbreaker it might have been.  The film has kind of faded into obscurity, but if Jamie Lee Curtis making like Harry Callahan and administering vigilante justice sounds like fun, this is definitely a must see.

415972,3,6301966899,"Kathryn Bigelow is like a female Michael Mann. She makes moody crime films that are always stylish, gritty, and that boast well choreographed action scenes. In 'Blue Steel' she tells the story of Margaret Turner (Jamie Lee Curtis) a rookie cadet just graduated from the Academy. After less than twenty four hours on the job she has prevented a grocery store stick up by blowing away the robber (Tom Sizemore). Turner's partner was in the bathroom so the rookie went it alone. This doesn't sit well with her superior officer Nick Mann (an excellent Clancy Brown). He takes her badge away and relieves her of duty. The police never found the suspect's weapon because it has been stolen by a commodities trader named Eugene (Ron Silver). He was in the grocery store at the time and made off with the gun before the police could find it. Eugene goes on a killing spree leaving behind spent cartridges that he has engraved with Margaret's name. As more bodies pile up Mann pulls Margaret out of retirement so that he can use her as bait in the hopes of catching the killer. Margaret meets Eugene by accident and the two become lovers. She has no idea that he is the one leaving her these messages. Curtis is strong in the lead role and Silver is legitimately scary as Eugene. The cat and mouse game between the two of them goes on a little too long especially once Margaret discovers who he is but that's more a complaint against having to endure more of Silver's creepiness than it is Bigelow's direction. The beautiful Elizabeth Pena is underused in a few scenes as Turner's best friend. A scarily plausible, disturbingly violent film that's very well made.",1247011200,2,1654,4.667808219178082

415996,3,6301966899,"There are some things to love about Blue Steel but there are some things that make the movie go sour before it even begins. Jamie Lee Curtis plays a rookie cop whose life is turned upside down by an obsessive man who happens to be the city's recent serial killer. After seeing Megan Turner ( Curtis ) kill a robber ( Tom Sizemore ) in a grocery store, Eugene Hunt ( Ron Silver ) goes on a mission to not only acclaim legendary status with his own murders, but win the heart of Megan and he goes about this in some very twisted ways. He soon ends up making it look like Curtis is the killer in hopes that it brings her closer to him. Blue Steel is very suspenseful and you must give it points for keeping the tension high, but it lacked a lot in the plot and characterization departments.

First off, we needed at least a little background on Ron Silver's character. Granted I understand the director probably kept this a secret on purpose, but she should have shared just a tiny hint of how this stockbroker can count change during the day but kill innocent bystanders at will during the night.

Secondly, the romance factor was totally off. Instead of having Silver obsessed with Curtis, the script should have concentrated more on her capturing him once she found out he was a serial killer. Curtis' character danced around the real police work for the first hour then finally decided to do real police work when the film was almost over. As for the obsession, sorry but I couldn't go for that. Jamie Lee is attractive in her own way but I don't believe she's the kind of woman someone would get so obsessed with. And when Silver blurts out that line: "" You're the most beautiful woman I've ever seen in my life "", I couldn't keep a straight face. In some parts the dialogue wasn't realistic at all and was terribly out of place. The longest scenes are the ones that should have been cut short. We should have seen more one on one interaction between Silver and Curtis since these were the primary characters. Instead Curtis spends most of her time with the police, trying to claim her innocence.  There are so many silly scenes in the film you can spot them a mile away. Blue Steel is very graphic and at times uncomfortable, especially when Silver brutally rapes Curtis while trying to choke her with a gun in his hand. This didn't seem necessary but thrown in for shock. The best part of the film was the end duel between Curtis and Silver. This was one of the most entertaining shooting scenes ever filmed for an actress and it was well worth it. Jamie held her own with the last scenes alone.

Ron Silver was fantastic and should have gotten an Oscar for his portrayal of Eugene. Jamie Lee Curtis doesn't quite fit the cop role and you get sick of people saying how beautiful she is throughout the entire movie.  Blue Steel is a one time deal. You'll either love it or hate it. I loved it despite its flaws. For some it warrants going out and buying the DVD though you get no extras whatsoever. For others, they may want to save their money and watch it on Encore.

As any good psychopath would he becomes infatuated with Megan and goes around killing people with her name on the bullet casings.  Too make matters worse he courts Megan and she falls for him.
The rest of the film finds Megan working with her fellow men in blue to figure out who the mysterious killer could be during the day while getting her swerve on with Eugene during the evenings.
The cinematography is good including some appropriate scenes shot in blue light.  However, the characterization is fairly poor, especially for Eugene where very little of his background is revealed and the plot is quite predictable.",1068249600,,951,4.888198757763975
415999,3,6301966899,"I wanted to like Blue Steel more than I did, but in the end the film is not effective as a psychological cop drama, an action film, or a thriller.  It's only use seems to be as an over stylized, heavy-handed exercise in emasculating a female cop for some role reversal in a genre dominated by tough male cops (Dirty Harry and its dozens of imitators).  It's sure to excite film theorists looking for a feminist angle, but in the end it comes off as plain silly when it had a lot of potential.
Jamie Lee plays Megan, a rookie cop who gets suspended after shooting a robber her first night on the job.  (The robber is a cracked out Tom Sizemore).  The crime scene gun, which would clear her, disappears into the hands of one of the witnesses.  Ron Silver is the Wall Street gold trader who grabs the gun and begins a maniacal killing spree, carving Curtis' name into the bullets and implicating her.  In the meantime, he begins seeing her romantically after arranging a chance meeting on the street.  This enables him to really play with her mind; as the relationship escalates, the bodies start piling up.
Even after he implicates himself to her during a demented revelation of sorts (that gun grabbing business will have film theorists drooling), his status makes him a very unlikely suspect, and his expensive lawyer is able to shield him from the cops.  He even shoots Megan's best friend right in front of her, yet he still gets away with it.  The man is clearly nuts, yet he's somehow untouchable.
There is practically no insight into Silver's character.  Like how a successful trader (who readily describes his own job trading gold options as 'misanthropic') is just one stray gun away from becoming the next Son of Sam.  Silver is a tremendous actor but he's given little to work with.  Having Silver play a trader must be some comment on a male dominated industry (Wall Street, traditionally) and its relationship to other primal male instincts (killing?), only hinted at in some of Silver's wackier moments.  It's not exactly subtle, and if you think about it, it's even slightly offensive.
The movie is rife with plot holes and jumps in logic that you dismiss until the end, when absurdity really takes over as a deserted Wall Street turns into the Wild West.  Our two principles chase each other, exchange gunfire at close range, get shot, run some more, shoot each other again, etc.  I kept thinking it was a dream sequence, but it wasn't.  Silver turns into Michael Meyers; he just can't seem to die.  He's shot, he's down, he's back up, he's shot again, etc.  Don't worry, that wasn't a plot spoiler; you can see it coming from the opening titles.
Blue Steel could have been much better.  Perhaps it was too early in director Kathryn Bigelow's career.  The intense, confident visual style of Near Dark is here, but the film is mainly concerned with vindicating its androgynous star's character through (typically male) movie violence.  The significance is that it's a female director.  The film would probably make even less of splash were it released today.
There are worse ways to kill time.  The DVD is not bad, it looks and sounds good enough.  So nice of the studio to include nothing in the way of extras; everyone loves having to buy the same product yet again.  Recommended for Bigelow and Curtis fans.",1062028800,2,3323,4.678141135972461
416000,4,6301966899,"Writer-director Kathryn Bigelow was a very talented painter before she went to film school to become a movie director.  It shows in her work which is very artistic for someone primarily known to the action-adventure genre of filmmaking.  She is a breath of fresh air in this genre, investing it with literate scripts and haunting imagery.  Her most frequent producer is James Cameron (the action wonder king, ""Titanic,"" ""Terminator""), who is also her ex-husband.  You can see his influence on her work as well. Bigelow's ""Blue Steel"" is set in the police world with a new cop played by Jamie Lee Curtis.  She heroically saves a whole supermarket full of people from an armed gunman only to set off a serial killer played by the aptly villainous Ron Silver, a commodities trader in New York City.  The film is a war of wits between Silver and Curtis, with Silver exhibiting all the raw cunning of a supremely intelligent man who has been lured over to the dark side of his existence.  Although not as artistic as most of her work, ""Blue Steel"" works very well in the police movie genre.

416001,5,6301966899,"I don't know what movie some of you people reviewed in this section, but it was not BLUE STEEL! Some of you seem to have ""missed the boat"" altogether and at once on this one. I just caught this on a saturday afternoon TV matinee, and it's one hell of a suspenseful psycho-killer-thriller in which Jamie Lee Curtis very well succeeds and comes across extremely credible and entertaining as an action type heroine stalked by a murderous psychopath. The killer is obsessed with Jamie throughout the film and sets about destroying her professional and personal life...you'll have to watch it, I don't want to give it all away...and this film has its ongoing suspenseful and intriguing twists and turns which will keep you on the edge of your seat throughout its entirety. Never a dull moment! There are elements within this film that remind me of Sigourney Weaver's COPYCAT thriller, which is another entertaining film. Jamie should make more films like this one. I've only seen a few of her movies, not really a fan before, but this one has surely made a Jamie Lee Curtis admirer out of me! I'm adding this dvd to my collection.",1052524800,,1125,4.715736040609137
416002,3,6301966899,"Ok, the storyline's pretty weak and the characters aren't developed properly, but one thing is for sure: Jamie Lee's acting has improved in leaps and bounds.  I found her quite convincing as a new recruit who has been suspended for shooting a guy whose weapon disappears after she's shot him.
It's far from being the greatest film of the early 90's, but worth owning if you're a Jamie Lee Curtis fan.  Go and watch ""The Fog"" after this, and you'll see what I mean about the improvement in her acting.",1051142400,3,500,4.544444444444444
416003,2,6301966899,"Every once in a while someone comes up with a movie and makes the terrible assumption that as long as they put a well known actor/actress in it that everything will turn out good. Blue Steel is one of those movies. Jamie Lee Curtis plays a rookie cop who is being held responsible for civilian casualties (or should I say murders) which she did not commit. Sounds like an interesting plot, right? It would be had the script not been so poorly written. The supporting actors give such a bland/typical performance that not even Jamie Lee could have saved the dialogue. Aside from the acting, the film does not give the action packed performance that it promises. Some scenes are quite dull and as you are watching you wonder half way through the movie when the cop (Jamie Lee) is going to finally kill the psychopath whose been after her. So why do I give Blue Steel an extra star? Well, I'll just say that if you are a fan of Jamie Lee Curtis you might want to watch this if it comes on television. Just don't pay over $3 to rent it and certainly don't buy it.",1044144000,3,1059,4.353535353535354

It's quite a showcase for Jamie Lee's talents, I've always been impressed with Mrs. Curtis's work but I think was her first ""all in"" dramatic role and she really nailed it. If it has one flaw I would say that I wish it was 30 - 40 minutes longer so the characters could get more fleshed out. All in all a great flick and well worth the wait for delivery from Europe  :)",1520035200,,466,4.1208791208791204
