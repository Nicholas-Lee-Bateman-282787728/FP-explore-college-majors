With one exception, this is a Rogers and Hart score of forgettable songs. Jesse Matthews was a triple threat but she had a face that did not register as beautiful on camera , despite effort. The leading man seemed gay so there was no chemistry between these characters. Worth seeing if you are interested in film history otherwise miss it.",1484006400,,505,4.75

It is tiresome so many great British pixs are not in the offing in the USA . . .  including FOLLY TO BE WISE, THE GREAT GIBERT & SULLIVAN, Halas & Batchelor's RUDDIGORE . . . and many more.

I'm not alone in my desire to be acquainted or reunited with Jessie, Alastair and the rest.

7896607,4,6305825173,"Evergreen (1934).  Director: Victor Saville.  Cast: Jessie Matthews (Harriet Green and Harriet Hawks); Sonny Hale (Leslie Benn), Barry Mackay (Tommy), Betty Balfour (Maudie), Ivor McLaren (Marquis of Staines), Hartley Power (Harriet's father).
Towards the end of her career, British musical star Jessie Matthews (1907-1981) generated some controversy when she complained she felt abandoned by her audience.  Critics hooted she was feeling sorry for herself, and was only trying to generate false publicity.  But Matthews was right: she undoubtedly sensed that her fame was slipping away.  By the 1960s the elfin sex-symbol of the 1930s was reduced to radio soap operas and playing Tom Thumb's portly mother in the eponymous children's film.
In 1940 Matthews was a household name on both sides of the Atlantic, as famous as Bette Davis or Greta Garbo.  Now, more than thirty years after her death from cancer, she is almost completely forgotten, her only exposure being one or two movies shown annually on TCM.  Most of her pictures are either unavailable on DVD or found only in cheap, poor quality copies, although some will be coming out soon in (hopefully) better-quality disks.
Matthews was the seventh of sixteen children born to a poverty-stricken London grocer.  It was a competitive brood: one of her brothers was the featherweight champion of British boxing back in 1920.  Jessie, incredibly cute but not conventionally beautiful (she had huge eyes and prominent front teeth), began working in the British equivalent of vaudeville as a kid and became a child star on stage: many believed she could progress no further up the ladder.  But in the mid-1920s, while touring Canada as an understudy, she got the kind of big break later reserved only for WB heroines when star Gertrude Lawrence took sick.  Jessie took her place, and audiences were sufficiently impressed by her dancing, singing, and bubbling personality to propel her to the top rank of British stardom.  She had the additional advantage  of an incredible physique, a figure that prompted her husband-manager Sonny Hale to insist to film producers ""We've got to sell that body.""  During her prime in the 1930s no opportunity was lost to show her in her underwear or changing into a skimpy stage costume.
It was her persona, however, that lay at the root of her immense popularity.  During the 1930s Jessie was the embodiment of the pretty-and-good-natured London shop-girl, smiling through adversity and willing to work hard if only she could get a break: streetwise but virginal, hip enough to understand a double entendre but quick with a slap if you got fresh.  Her singing and dancing styles were unconventional, centered around high notes and even higher kicks, but she never failed to entertain.  She was also the only major British star who refused to be lured by Hollywood money (they always wanted to pair her with Fred Astaire, a deal that supposedly fell through over who would get billing), which further endeared her to the British public.
She had her share of bad press, including a major divorce scandal before she married Hale in 1931, but when war broke out in 1939 there was little dispute that she was the biggest star in Britain.  She basically stopped working during the war years, apparently to help out with service appearances, and was never able to re-establish herself with postwar audiences.  The British public of 1945 was vastly different and more cynical than that of six years earlier, and (just as in Hollywood) there was no market for cute romantic comedies.
The plot of Evergreen (loosely based on a true story involving stage star Lottie Collins) concerns Harriet Green, an actress (played by Matthews) who, in 1904, plans to retire to marry a British nobleman.  At the last moment she is black-mailed by Hartley Power (also a great performance), a former lover by whom she has an illegitimate daughter.  Rather than expose her fianc to scandal, she decides to return to her home in far-away South Africa, leaving the daughter to be raised by her assistant in London.  Years later, that daughter (also played by Matthews) seeks to launch her own career by pretending to be her mother, returning to the stage at the ripe old age of sixty.  It is one of the unconscious hilarities of the film that sixty is considered ancient, although I can vouch for the fact that even when I was a kid myself, in the 1970s, anyone older than forty seemed very, very old.  Funny how that perspective changes.
Other notable performances in Evergreen include Hale (a marvelous role as a theatrical director), and Betty Balfour, a big star in her own right who here plays a former actress who is the first to realize Harriet's identity.
The heart of the film is in two segments: the big production number that introduces ""Harriet Green"" to the 1934 public, and the finale.
The first segment is broken into three parts, intended to demonstrate the music and dancing of three historical eras.  The 1924 number revolves around jazz and the Charleston; it is the least successful of the three.  The 1904 routine emphasizes the insularity and power of what proved to be the last days of the British Empire.  These people felt they ruled the world, much like the Americans of today, but with the additional conviction that they had a moral and ethnic right to do so, and that everything was going to turn out just fine.  Boy, were they wrong: the world wars were just around the corner, as were the gulags and the Nazi death camps, chemical warfare and genocide.  The third segment takes place in 1914 and is evocative of the Great War period.  Young women are transformed from innocent girls in white gowns into Nordic warrior maidens in futuristic armor, and sent off to battle inside giant shells which will also serve as their coffins.  It is quite simply one of the most dazzling bits of cinema produced during the 1930s, albeit sadly (and inexplicably) forgotten.  Think Metropolis with a really good pop soundtrack.
The climactic number at the end of the film also merits special mention, succeeding as it does in tying together all the loose ends and providing the happy ending without which the film would not work.  It is easy to imagine audiences of the time filing out of the theater amid excited conversation and contented smiles.
On the technical side, these Warner Brothers Archive ""manufacture on demand"" disks seem to be regressing.  The first one I bought, about a year ago (Hollywood Review Of 1929), had the chapter stops placed roughly every ten minutes.  This version of Evergreen has no chapter stops at all: the entire film is all one long chapter, and you have to fast-forward and rewind to find your favorite spots.  The print quality is okay but not great.  Evergreen could really benefit from a restoration, but since the establishment seems to ignore it completely I guess we'll have to be satisfied with what we've got.  To sum it up, Evergreen is an incredibly appealing movie in an ordinary or even sub-par package.",1378944000,,7027,4.908706677937447
7896608,4,6305825173,"This film is perhaps the most remembered of Jessie Matthews legendary musicals. A charming piece of frivolity. Devine dancing, magical music, and charismatic comedy performances by Brtitains best.  The film is a tuneful, spectacular cinematic version of the stage musical notable for excellently executed ensembles. Remembered not only for Jessie's singing, dancing and acting, but for husband Hale's uplifting performance and return to the screen of Betty Balfour. Stunning costumery and lavish sets dress a carefully crafted plot which opens with the farewell performance of Harriet Green at the Tivoli Music Hall in 1909. After the show a party is thrown for Harriet at which her engagement to the Marquis of Staines is announced. She is called away to discover the man who had lived with her attempting blackmail: an occurance that makes her flee the country, leaving her daughter to be brought up in the charge of her dresser. Grown up daughter takes on mothers identity for an amazing return to stage. But Tommy, Harriet's pseudo publicity agent and supposed son, finds that he is falling in love with his 'mother'...",981244800,9,1123,5.170329670329671
7896609,4,6305825173,"By 1934, there was a steady stream of classic musicals flowing from the Hollywood production line. 'Gold Diggers', 'Flying Down to Rio' and '42nd Street' had all made it big the previous year. One of the most successful British attempts to emulate them was 'Evergreen' starring Jessie Matthews. Although 'Evergreen' inevitably looks dated and lacks the scale of a Hollywood production, the movie is the perfect showcase for Jessie Matthews to display her wonderful singing and dancing ability. This film features Jessie Matthews performing her 'Dancing On The Ceiling' and 'Springtime In Your Heart' numbers - which rank amongst the best in any British musical of this period. The dance numbers are complimented by a pretty good storyline (by 1930s musicals standards) involving Ms Matthews impersonating her late mother in order to make her name as a dancer. It doesn't sound much on paper but it's quite entertaining when you come to watch it. Having seen other British musicals of the same period ""Evergreen"" is definitely a cut above the rest. This movie will obviously not be to everyone's taste but it's a great place to start if you're interested in Jessie Matthews or musicals from this period.",962236800,6,1202,5.075757575757576
7896610,3,6305825173,"An essentially old-fashioned story (which time has been unkind to), this movie nevertheless gives a glimpse of sparkling young English actress Matthews. Musical films were not Britain's forte yet Jessie carries the entire film with considerable charm, perkiness and resilience. Matthew's round face and wide eyes enlighten her rather rabbitty mouth (which is done up with cupid bow lipstick). While her singing is not great, her rendition of ""Dancing on the Ceiling"" is famous, and her dancing is like a feather in the wind; it is only when Matthews is on the screen that EVERGREEN really comes alive.",958521600,5,601,5.142857142857143
