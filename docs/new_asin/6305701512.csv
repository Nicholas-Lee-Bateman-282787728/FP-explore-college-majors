1063102,5,6305701512,"James Spader in a refreshing light-hearted comedy??

Without nudity and lots of sex?? Is it any good?? YES!!

  I was overly pleased with Spader's antics. I had no idea he was good with anything physical above the eyebrows (graymatter). And these supporting actors are without equal. It's a sweet, fun script that flies by which you'll have to watch again - and show it to friends.

1063103,4,6305701512,"Peter Yates `s career has had too much peaks and some lows . From his famous thriller Bullit in the far sixties to the Dresser ( his masterpiece to my mind) . His concerns have always turned around the inner dragons hidden in the intimacy of the most of the human beings .

In this time he recreates a funny situation in which  New York ` s dressy guy will be haunted for two old specters in the New Year `s 1927 . Obviously he will be the one who watches them . Since the plot has many intersections with previous films , the masterful hand of Yates and this splendid cast gets to lead this film to a happy land .

 Michael Caine , Maggie Smith , Marcia Gay Harden and James Spader and my dear reader as you well know I have not seen any film accepted by Mr. Caine fairly mediocre . So considering all the cards in your hand , how can you lose with this clever and easy going picture ?",1103587200,3,886,4.017045454545454

The story idea is pleasasnt enough, but too often the scenes seem to just ramble on.  There are bright spots, usually when Smith and Caine are around.  The dialogue needed much more sparkle to make this film more memorable.  A bit of better editing might have also improved the whole piece.

James Spader is great also, sort of Cary Grant similar.  I don't remeber Polly Walker very well, the weak link? You also get Buck Henry and Sam Shepard!  The music is wonderful also, very beautiful movie.

She wants him to marry her, but  the old home he has just purchased has a few resident ghosts whom he needs  to deal with first.  Because to some degree they have contributed to his  rift with Julia, (she says several times ""I just don't want this""  in confronting Stevenson's seeming inability to commit himself) the ghost  couple also go to great lengths to bring the two of them together.  However, there is another woman in the picture, one which Stevenson likes  but not romantically and, well, things gets good and complicated down this  path.  Meanwhile, the ghosts, Max and Lily Gale, stage performers in their  previous lives, dead as they are, have much to work on in mending their own  age old romance.  The acting is superb.  The customes are posh if adequate.  The story is original and thoughtful, and warm, it feels real, in spite of  the infighting spirits.  And -- a big plus -- the language is clean.

Spader inspires giggles with  another of his always surprising comedic presentations, especially in his  ""fright"" when the ghosts appear. The music is warm and the  characters are rich. The dialogue is bright.  The film offers a beautiful  fantasy escape to upper class New York and a look into the publishing  business - enjoy it with a glass or two of wine, and it will seem very  believable.",957571200,35,659,5.027777777777778

Unfortunately, it's boring to the point where  you just don't care.  I really wanted to like this movie, but it just  didn't happen.  What was probably a good idea on paper didn't translate  well to the screen.  The acting is good, and some of the dialogue  (especially between the bickering ghosts) is funny, but the whole thing  lacks energy and seems forced at times.  This is the second video from  Square Dog Pictures that I've suffered through, the first being a very  unfunny low-budget comedy titled ""Kill The Man"".  Based on what  I've seen so far (and the quality of the previews for their other films),  it's best to leave their productions on the shelves.  Definitely not worth  purchasing unless you enjoy making yourself miserable.  Maybe worth a  rental if there's really nothing else available.",950572800,7,1205,5.103092783505154

James Spader is kind of awkward in his role as a publisher in a down-and-out romance, and it's clear that rom-coms aren't his strong point, even this early in his career. What really makes this movie shine is the outstanding chemistry between Maggie Smith and Michael Caine. These two film legends paired together  are comic gold, in a very British way, and it surprises me that this hasn't become more of a classic just on their account.",1408060800,,548,4.757894736842105

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
I was a huge fan of the old Topper TV show. Leo Carroll was just right for the role and I preferred the casual insouciance of Robert Sterling over the suave but aggressive Cary Grant from the movie version.

Curtain Call replays the notion of married ghosts haunting a nervous socially inept man.

Michael Caine and Maggie Smith carry the movie. Between them is a natural, effortless professional set of skilled performances. Timing, delivery even the carriage of their bodies lend to the enjoyment of this movie. A short silent sequence has the lecherous Caine as Max Marlow attempting to leer at the living couple;  James Spader (Stevenson Lowe) and Polly Walker (Julia) share an amorous moment.  Evan as Max maneuvers for the best view, Dame Maggie Smith (Lily Marlow) urges him away with a gentle imperious manner , she in turn lingers to get her voyeuristic moment then reluctantly leaves the living to live. Start to finish, a lovely performance.

Plot wise the story asks if the nervous but art inspired Spader character can come to realize his love for his girlfriend while making the adult decision about his just taken over, previously  family owned publishing House. No need for spoilers except that the plot hardly matters. James Spader looks very young, and handles his role as the point man well enough. His job is to observe and then make the big speech.

 There is some real power in the supporting roles of Sam Shepphard (competing love interest for Julie- she has no second name ) and some wonderfully slick moments by Buck Henry, the oozing corporate master mind who now makes the decisions for the publishing house.

This is light entertainment. There is some rough language but overall it is family friendly. The plot is close to surprise free and the humor is rarely above the broad smile level. I am rating this at 4 stars but will not quibble with those who would rather see 3 .",1398297600,,2171,4.9423076923076925

I watched thinking this would be a witty, sparkling, urbane comedy, the kind Cary Grant was a master at performing in. James Spader as the harried hero is no Grant, and tries gamely to charm his way through the proceedings but fails.

The story of a chaotic publishing exec, trying to juggle career, problematic fiance' and the gorgeous NYC townhouse recenty purchased, home to two squabbling ghosts ala the Lunts, should have been a riotous romp. It quite simply is not. While Caine and Smith, looking glorious in period 30's glamour, do sparkle together, their scenes are too few to save this plodding borefest. The script slugs along in various directions that at times don't make sense and are often unnecessary. Sam Shepard as a U.S. Senator vying for the affections of the heroine, Polly Walker (badly miscast), is a complete unneeded waste. And Marcia Gay Harden appears as a seductress after the hero that makes no sense either.

Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan could have pulled off this type of comedy. Hanks had the put upon demeanor that was endearing and charming, in the vein of Grant, and Ryan was adept as the wounded, vulnerable, and confused girlfriend. Walker in this role is harsh and grating, and the audience can't sympathize. In fact, you wonder what the leading man sees in her at all? Spader just doesn't have the charm and appeal needed for this type of comedy.

Smith and Caine as a theatrical couple of the first half of the 20th century are the only reason to watch this drek. Even their scenes only have a modicum of the fun they displayed in California Suite. For a bickering, spatting, squabbling witty diva and impressario, there is little quarreling, let alone wit between them. Probably the films greatest sin is the waste of talent of these two brilliant performers.

The direction is slow and boring and often leaves glaring errors. For example, the ghost Caine drinks from an Absolut bottle with Spader, yet others don't notice a bottle in midair unfetered by a living or dead being (only Spader, for some never explained reason, can see the entities). We never learn why the ghosts remain, why all their belongings are still inplace, that they seem to be able to use as if still living...?? And why they must open and close and walk through doorways the same as mere mortals, yet they can transport themselves anywhere they want to at any time. A decided lack of special effects is apparent all over the place.

Overall a bore, that only briefly comes alive due to the slight sparkle of the great Caine and Smith.",1379030400,,2642,4.759825327510917
1063362,3,6305701512,"I must say that I didn't see this film until 2013. Spader is delish as a romantic comedy lead. Is there anything he is not good in?  The biggest problem with this film is Polly Walker.  She  does not portray the girlfriend, Julia in a manner that you ""root"" for her. In fact, she left me hoping Spader as Stephenson Lowe, found someone enchanting and adorable somewhere along the way to take her place.  Walker played Julia as an aloof, offended beauty and there was little other than the beauty to recommend her for her relationship in the romantic comedy. There is really no ""spark"" between Julia and Stephenson at all.  No matter how steamy Spader can get in this film, as he does in most of his films, this movie is pretty tepid.

Michael Caine and Maggie Smith make for all the fun in this film. They are a delightful pairing and their timing and presence work together like clockwork.

This is a romantic comedy. Stevenson (Spader) is a young publisher who just bought a furnished 1930s' house. He is afraid of commitment and his girlfriend is tired of waiting to be asked. The house has two bickering ghosts (Caine and Smith). One encourages him to be a philanderer, the other pleads for romantic love. Stevenson has trouble in his job too: the new owner wants to publish bestsellers with little concession to literature. You can guess that he feels very lonely, because while complaining about the ghosts, he calls them when he comes back home. So we follow two love stories: the story of Stevenson and the story of the ghosts.
The actors
The whole cast is perfect, the style of James Spader contrasts pleasantly with the style of Caine and Maggie Smith, it is a real pleasure to see their work. In a small role, Frances Sternhagen is delightful.

1063530,3,6305701512,"Down through the years I have simply adored Dame Maggie Smith especially in her forays into comedy.  I really believe that she is one of the funniest actresses on earth.  Just one look or one line delivered can send me into hysterics.  This film ""Curtain Call"" is certainly not the greatest film on screen but WHO CARES it has Maggie Smith and Michael Caine ""bouncing"" off each other in very amusing ways.  Yes, when they are on the screen, in this movie, I laughed out loud many, many times.

This 93 minute, made in 1997 film, to me, is, at best, merely  mediocre with no ""stand out"" acting; however, I derived a great deal of pleasure whenever Maggie Smith and Michael Caine were on screen playing ghosts from the 1920s that have been married for a long time and feud a lot but love each other a lot.  Their duels make one laugh out loud with Maggie delivering, in her wonderful way, some very funny lines.

In light of the above, if you want to spend 93 minutes of your time watching a non-challenging movie that is free of any gratuitous violence, sex or nudity and, most of all, has two veterans (Maggie and Michael) that illuminate the screen whenever they appear, buy this film,",1279843200,,1186,4.4837209302325585
1063531,3,6305701512,"I admire Maggie Smith and Michael Caine but this was certainly not one of their best.
The main character, a young fellow buying a house with the other two as resident ghosts is such a disappointing character. One wonders how he can run a publishing house when he can't manage to ever get meaningful words out of his mouth when dealing with his personal life, especially when dealing with his girlfriend.
Another film that used this theme (and did a better job of it) springs to mind: THE GHOST AND MRS. MUIR.
Even fanciful films such as MR. PEABODY AND THE MERMAID---unfortunately not available on DVD---worked a similar theme better.  CURTAIN CALL is not a keeper in our DVD collection.",1276473600,,687,4.725

1063535,4,6305701512,"I'll watch any movie that has Maggie Smith and Michael Caine together; their comedic chemistry is strongly reminiscent of William Powell/Myrna Loy. It's also nice to see James Spader in a comic role, which he handles quite well.

This is a very entertaining, light-hearted movie which wears well over more than one viewing. The only part of the plot that ever-so-slightly annoys (at least, it does me) is that the girlfriend, played by Polly Walker, never gives Spader's character a chance to explain; she always interrupts him, then runs away. But of course, that in itself provides some of the ""conflict"" in what would otherwise be a mere piece of fluff.

James Spaeder does a very good job holding his own with these two. This is not the average love story. After all there is nothing average about a ghost couple with a history of fireworks in their relationship. They have a lot to teach, and do it well just being themselves. In spite of the fact that everything seems to go constantly awry, all that unseen ""help"", Spaeder's character proves to be a clumsy but apt pupil.

The cast is a dream. Caine and Smith are simply wonderful together and Spader gives a brilliant performance as a comedian - one has to think of his later work in ""Boston Legal"". The supporting cast is also very good. Polly Walker seems a little pale and uninteresting, but that can be easily overlooked.

And this film is more than just a love-story (or even a ghost-story): it's a film about books. The sub-plot features the hero's struggle to run a publishing house that refuses to publish low-quality books. His reactions on some of the ""best-selling"" titles alone are worth watching the film.

Fabulous.  a young James Spader with a mop of hair and a tendency to fall over obstacles is simply hilarious and he nearly manages to compete with those two inveterate scene stealers, Michael Caine and Maggie Smith.

The storyline reminds me of the old Topper tv series.  This is light comedy, almost as light as a sponge cake from the Great British Baking Show.
