1909774,5,B0000BWVAE,"This movie was hilarious.  It is definitely a movie for teens.  I am not joking when I say that this monkey walks, talks, and acts like a human.  Plus he throws his balls at unsuspecting victims.  You will fall over laughing, especially if you are under the influence.  The jokes in this movie are not funny at all, but this monkey acts like he is constantly on crack, and he always jitters and shakes.  Plus you can tell that everytime he is snowboarding that someone pushed him down the mountain and he is trying to stop, but he can't.  In one scene you can see the guys hand pushing him off of a jump.  It was probably the funniest thing I have ever seen.  Go see this movie... no, wait, go buy this movie!  It will be worth it!",1080950400,4,731,4.194244604316546
1909775,5,B0000BWVAE,"Of the 3 films in the MVP trilogy, I think MXP might be the best.  I watched this one with a few friends before going out on a Saturday night.  The comic hijinks of Jack and the other monkeys, as wells as the complete aloofness of every adult in the movie who fails to see Jack climbing trees, eating food, and sneaking onto airplanes dressed in a sombrero and pancho is incredible.  This film sells itself.  1 monkey + 1 snowboard = awesome.  Is MXS (Most Extreme Surfer) next?  I hope so.",1076976000,3,490,4.271739130434782

7998061,5,B0000BWVAE,"WOW! I was blown away by this movie. When I first saw MVP 2, I didn't even think that a better movie exist. Then I discovered this bad boy at a Wal-Mart in the cheap movie bin....for some reason? I immediately went home and popped it into my dvd player and sat down, popped a cold one (RC Cola), ate a skittle, and awaited for the laughter! Jack is back in this all out action extravaganza. The movie starts where MVP 2 left off. After Jack dominates Ted at the skateboard competition, Jack and Ted get into a fight, and Jack is kicked out of school for violent behavior and extreme acts of prejudice. But did that keep Jack down? Heck no! Jack says ""later suckas, Im goin' to Colorado"". At least thats what I think he said. Its actually just chimp jibberish. Just like MVP 2, Jack is joined by an all star cast featuring David Allen Grier, Sarah Jessica Parker, and that one guy from ""Everybody Loves Raymond"". It also shows Jack training with pro snow-boarder Lance Bettington. That scene was so awesome, I threw my bike into the street! So if you want to stay up all night laughing, then check this movie out. Because there's one thing for sure about this movie, ""Jack is back, ready for the attack, and that ain't whack"".",1179619200,,1225,4.400881057268722
