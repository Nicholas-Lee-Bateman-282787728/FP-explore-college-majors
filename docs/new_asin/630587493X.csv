This was an excellent movie, it kept me riveted to the screen. Robin Williams seems to  have a magic about him in movies like this.  Touchstone gives this movie a  very Disneyesque feel.  The story is great and you will love Andrew and the  relationships that he forms with people.  Sam Neill and Oliver Platt are  very good supporting actors in this movie.  Overall, there are quite a few  moments that will make you laugh...some that might make you cry, but its an  excellent movie, that both you and your kids or other loved ones can enjoy  together!  Highly Recommended!",960854400,,706,4.507936507936508
1084943,1,630587493X,"Typical of Robin Williams' ""New Age"" drivel that he's been making lately.  Where is the actor of ""Dead Poet's Society,"" ""Good Will Hunting,"" and ""Good Morning, Vietnam""?  This  film is TERRIBLE!  Not is it only overlong (it seemed like 200 years), but  the character development is nearly nonexistent and the themes overstated  and underdeveloped.  A clunker.

This movie touches on love, romance, comedy, prejudices and equality for all.  Robin Williams and Elsbeth Davidtz were  exceptional. The sounds track by Jmes Horner was haunting and enchanting.  The Theme so by Celine Dion is breathtaking.  A movie I can gladly say is  the best that I have every seen. The movie does not focus on futuristic  gadets and what not. The focus of the movie is change evelution and love.  Something that everyone can relate to.",960336000,12,560,4.75

1085075,5,630587493X,"Although the movie is a celebration of Andrew's ongoing quest for enlightenment and humanity, it does make us cry. Why? Because the lengthy scope of the movie reminds us all too sharply that this fate is eventually in store for all of us. We will lose loved ones, and leave loved ones behind. Although it is unavoidable, we regard it as very sad. The fact that this movie does tap into that deep fear and sadness in all of us is a testament to just how on target it is.

And give credit to Asimov. Sentiment is not normally a big part of his writing, but in this story he brought it fully to bear, and the film captures it maybe even more fully than the prose did.

It is sort of a shame to me that this movie is so good, yet it chokes me up so often for its last two thirds that I can't really bear to put myself thru that emotional wringer very often.

Robin Williams is brilliant. His ability to gradually ""turn on"" to humanity is marvelous, especially considering that since movies are virtually never shot in sequence, he probably had to go back and forth quite a bit regarding his current stage of enlightenment.

This movie is based on a story by Isaac Asimov. Not much of Asimov has made it to movies, and more should.",1508976000,4,1226,4.271551724137931
1085076,5,630587493X,"Firstly, to those who gave this film a 1 or 2-star rating: The seller got it wrong when he/she referred to it as a comedy. Its actually a drama with comedic aspects. Also, yesMany of the scenes are sad, even in the first 1/2 hour or 45 minutes. Inaptly named Grace has him jump out of the window. While they're at that rocky beach, Little Miss asked him if he wanted to hold her favorite glass/crystal horse & he accidentally dropped it, breaking it. Both girls were angry, and when Little Miss told him to get away from her & she hates him, you can already see that he has a number of slight expressions on his face because he turned & walked away with his head down & a remorseful expression on his face, until he noticed the driftwood from which he carved out an original horse for Little Missthe one she was holding when she died. Yes, the topic of mortality in this film can be a thing many people don't want to recognize, but the blame belongs with nature. I was unlucky enough to be born with one deadly disease that caused another deadly disease. Every beating heart ceases to beat at some inevitable point. The point is that he DIDNT want to be immortal, so considering Little Miss death & the answer Portia gave him regarding the fact everyone he loves will leave was why Andrew runs to Rupert, presenting his designs for prosthetic organs. Scientists are already testing actual prosthetic organs, and could you imagine how many lives could be saved since theres a shortage of organs? If enough were made, I could receive a transplant as soon as my MELD score jumps up a bit. These bionic/human creations could change the face of transplantation as we know it!
Then theres Andrew, himself, who, even with a positronic brain, is NOT a mistakehes just unique. He has real human emotions. For very sick folks such as myself, I lie here wishing I had my own Andrew, to be my caregiver, & that I would demand one such as Andrew because he has true sympathy (I mean cmon: Andrew felt badly for sperm)a wonderful thought for a transplant patient with no real caregiver. Id be so good to him, and Id teach him things which weren't programmed into him, just as did Richard.
Oh, Kendall Brian HunterId say Robin Williams thoughts on suicide are moot, since he committed suicide.
Perhaps it was corny in certain scenes, yet logic dictates Andrews sense of humor after Richard taught him about jokes. In no way, as well, did Williams supersede the other characters (the Martins were clearly fleshed out characters, and rightly so since Andrew had no true sense of time. The familys lineage was not gratuitous. In fact, it made the average film watcher understand the miracle of genetics, and beautifully so.",1507939200,,2705,4.590909090909091

1085080,5,630587493X,"At various times throughout this movie, the professional, heart-felt performances of the star, Robin Williams, and supporting actors display humor, sadness and frustration experienced by the players that emphasize the kinds of human social pressures, prejudices and ingrained cultural notions that often impact new and unique challenges to the norm.

1085110,2,630587493X,"This movie is about a robot who spends his existence trying to become a human being.  Through his journey, we learn about what is both good and evil about ourselves.  Andrew, the robot, begins as property but as he becomes sentient and grows his knowledge through voluminous reading, he begins to understand ideas such as freedom, self esteem, identity, pride, and most importantly, romantic love.  He comes to understand that as a robot in human society, he is unworthy of all of them.  He finds this unacceptable and characteristically says, ""This will not do.""  He uses his positronic brain, superior to our own, to make scientific breakthroughs that benefit mankind but also allow him to move closer and closer to looking human.  What we all come to realize is that Andrew has always been more than human on the inside- his struggle to make himself more human on the outside is simply for the world's acceptance.  The idea for this movie is interesting and ambitious but the execution just doesn't live up to the challenge.  As much as I'd like to honor Robin Williams right now, I have to say that this film is long, repetitious and rather boring.  Andrew's expressions and mannerisms are irritating at times to watch and by the end of the movie, you are glad it is over.  This should be a children's movie- in which case, it needed to be severely edited to make it shorter and easier to watch.  I think the difficulty in watching the film is the juxtaposition of such complex and adult themes onto a Disney like cast and such a comical looking robot.  It just doesn't work.  In fact, it's disturbing- especially how Andrew can transfer his romantic love from the mother directly onto the daughter simply because they look alike.  I don't think this film is either for adults or children.  Skip this one.",1502409600,,1809,4.698412698412699

1085157,5,630587493X,"This was always a movie that I've enjoyed. It is futuristic, but also features believable characters and an amazing cast. It is long, but it tells a story from birth (or creation) to death. Robin Williams, Sam Neill and Embeth Davidtz are all great, though I feel Williams was restrained by his character. Oliver Platt comes in later, and (quite literally) gives more life to the story. The ending introduces the question of humanity and how we will possibly live with conscious beings who are not necessarily human. Because deep learning, neural networks and the internet of things are now becoming part of our everyday life, I believe this movie would have been better received if it were released a decade or so later. No, it's not a perfect movie, there are slow moments and some connections need to be made by the viewer, but it still has beautiful production value. The music score is fantastic and also well-timed--brings out emotion in the film. Worth a watch, and for some, it is worth having to keep.",1492992000,,1010,4.744318181818182

This movie will touch the hearts of those who have loved and lost. If Robin Williams  was still live in if I was off want to  Time on my favorite movie was and is it would be the Bicentennial Man.

And in a curious way, it's a perfect vehicle for Robin Williams' many gifts, not least of which is his own remarkably thoughtful and childlike quality underneath all his better known madcap humor. BTW, to see all the glowing reviews here, it's strange to think how poorly the film was received when it first came out. Or perhaps like his life, a lot of folks were simply always expecting the 'other' Robin Williams they had already become so familiar with?!",1473120000,,558,4.822916666666667

I thought Robin Williams played the title role very well.  When it was humorous, it was sometimes silly humor, in the way that a child grows to learn more mature behavior.

1085515,5,630587493X,"A year after winning his well-deserved golden statuette, Robin Williams, once TV's Mork, delved once more into the realm of science fiction, appearing onscreen as an Oscar-like robot in a story based on a tale by Issac Asimov called ""The Posiotronic Man"".
  As the story, directed by Chris Columbus begins, we view the assembling of products by NorthAm Robotics, one of which is delivered to the home of the wealthy Martin family( Sam Neill, Wendy Crewson, Lindze Letherman, and Hallie Kate Eisenberg) on April 3,2005.
  Richard Martin, a clock maker, turns on the android, who receives his name ""Andrew"" because of the younger daughter, Amanda's(Little Miss) mispronunciation of the word, ""android"". The rebellious older daughter,Grace ( Miss) who later makes a significant attempt to destroy Andrew , has seen similar mechanisms in her  friends' homes and is unimpressed.
  The family overcome their initially awkward relationship with the new mechanism as they assign chores for him.
  As the  girls spend time playing on the beach, Andrew watches over them. When he accidentally breaks Little Miss' favorite glass figurine of a horse, he compensates her by producing a perfect replica from wood, which the child treasures.
  Gradually, it occurs to Mr. Martin that Andrew is unique among posiotronic robots, and he  changes his regimen  from strictly chores and children to devoting  some time to creating things, and instruction about human behavior, setting the course for Andrew to fulfill a broader destiny.
 There is a sweet scene of Andrew  and his beloved Little Miss playing Gabriel Faure's ""Dolly Suite"" on the piano.
 By the end of the duet, we see  a now-grown Amanda( Embeth Davitz) after which Andrew begins a delightful round of Scott Joplin's ""Maple Leaf Rag"".
 A still-rebellious Grace and her boyfriend (Scott Waugh) are confronted by Mrs. Martin outside the estate, while inside, the noise  by the profusion of clocks Andrew made  aggravates the family. In response to the idea of selling them, Little  Miss suggests that Andrew receive the proceeds, which leads to his recipience of a bank account, and a physical upgrade , which gives his face more expression.
  At Amanda's wedding, during which Andrew serves as an usher and wears clothes for the first time, the bride and groom(Quinn Smith) are greeted with a sweet and brilliant beam from the android as they exit the church.
  Andrew must then deal with the emotional Richard, with whom he shares the day's events in his memory bank.
  Several years later, Andrew declares his freedom, after which he  designs and builds his dream house on the beach where he spent time with the Martin family over the years.
  For the next 16 years, he is left to himself until Little Miss takes him home to see her father one last time, during which we learn that  Grace's(Angela Landers) attitude towards him remains unchanged, and is shared by Amanda's son, Lloyd(Igor Hiller, Bradley Whitford). But as a new attorney, Lloyd helps Andrew obtain information about robots similar to himself to help him understand his destiny.
 After a decade-long quest, which takes him around the country, he returns to San Francisco where he had a fateful encounter with a spry female robot named Galatea(Kiersten Warren) after the one created by the gods in the ancient Greek story, ""Pygmalion"", and is led to her creator, Rupert Burns(Oliver Platt), and the plot thickens even further. Occasionally, Andrew will torment Galatea when he finds her annoying. But he finances Ruperts's work and eventually upgrades to a more human body, after he reunites with Little Miss, now in her mid-seventies, and baffles at the appearance of her look-alike granddaughter, Portia(also played by Davitz) , with whom his initially antagonistic relationship begins. Noticeably, his mannerisms, and gestures, including eye movements remain robotic after the initial upgrade.
  He takes in a stray dog, who he named Woofy, after the stuffed dog Amanda gave him after he presented her with the wooden horse her made for her as a child, and will tend to Amanda as she holds that precious momento in her final moments.
 The realization of his immortality amid the aspect of losing every person he loves over time weighs heavily upon him, setting off a dramatic course of events.
 An enchanting moment at a ball  finds Portia escorted  by her human fiance, Charles(Jay Johnston), but feeling conflicted about Andrew because she cannot invest  her emotions in a machine, and  yet sharing a graceful dance with the latter to Paula West's  interpretation of Ray Noble's ""The Very Thought of You"".
 To Andrew's advantage, Portia is more open and honest about her feelings about the sweet android that has been a part of her family for over a generation than her grandmother was able to be.
 We shall see how Rupert, Galatea, Portia, and the World Congress, presided over by one Marjorie Bota( Lynne Thigpen) bring this tale to its poignant resolution.
  Adam Bryant, who frequently doubled for Williams appears as a humanoid head, and we may glimpse  little Cody Williams as a church altar boy.
  And so, in honor of what would have been the great actor/comedian's 65th birthday, I pay all due editorial homage to a poignant and romantic sci-fi epic, which touches on  the genre which launched his career, on themes he explored in other movies,  and enabled him to display the levels of warmth and sweetness which for him, never required any acting.",1468454400,2,5473,5.031145717463849

1085646,5,630587493X,"One of my all time favorite movies. I'm not sure what it is about this movie that makes me enjoy it; it's slow moving but there's so much in it. What I love is how so much of the thought conveyed is through expression, and not words. I love the contemplation that goes on as the father observes Andrew's growth. It is such a fabulous story. I've watched this thing at least 7 times. Not in a row mind you, but spread out, and each time it evokes so much thought and feeling. It's very well done. The actors are some of my favorites. Sam Neill I loved in The Piano is every bit as good in this. Robin Williams is, well, perfect. It's not about action, or even deep science. It's about growth. I love a film that makes me think long after it's over. This one does just that. Isaac Asimov is able to do this so often in his books and stories. And this one of his stories is like many of his others. Chris Columbus gave a gift in this film.  It's not the style for everyone I realize. But it's mine, and I simply love it.",1460678400,,1017,4.059701492537314
1085647,5,630587493X,"I was very surprised how pleased I was with the condition this came in. I bought this used for a cheap price and I was very impressed with the quality this arrived in. This is one of my favorite movies of all time: by far it is my favorite film with Robin Williams in it. It's about a synthetic AI robot who is very humanistic and really wants to be human. After many modifications, he is so close to being human. It's an amazing film and it spans through many generations of the family the robot works for and later befriends.

This came in practically mint condition. Yes, it was used before, however, there were only little smudges, rather than scratches. The company had explained to me once I had ordered this that they would be putting it through a refurbishing machine to make sure the DVD came well. The case was very nicely kept and not crinkled or ripped, which I was very pleased with. In addition, there was even the little paper leaflet that had the scene selection list as well as the special features. The seller of this was a Goodwill store, so you could imagine the good quality it was kept in. Thank you!",1460505600,,1122,4.394230769230769

1085688,1,630587493X,"Most of the jokes were horribly unfunny, the only likeable characters died about halfway through the film, and the film was unnecessarily vulgar in a lot places with no discernible reason. Seriously. It'll go from a scene of a family eating breakfast to RobinWilliamsbot spitting out as many dick jokes as he can fit in before the scene changes. And boy are a lot of those scenes forced. None of the attempted ""deep and emotional"" robot-human interactions feel sincere at all. Not even the robot is convincing. A few minutes after the family gets him out of the box it's clear that they've been gypped and given Robin Williams in a robot suit instead of a functioning model. He also has a tendency to just stand there and stare at them. A LOT. As if this movie needed to try to get to the uncanny valley. They keep him anyway and let him raise their children (despite his inappropriate humor and random holes in basic knowledge written in so that the dad can have painfully uncomfortable teaching sessions with him) and the younger one decides she's in love with him (but shoves him from behind when he's using a band saw and causes him to cut off his thumb before revealing so to the audience, which is pretty careless and odd for her to do when she was shown to be the family member most concerned with his well being in all previous scenes. Maybe it was a poorly executed joke? Also since when is it normal human behavior to fall in love with a parental figure? Actually this girl seems completely incompetent and stupid in every scene she's been in since the time skip. The other child's a delinquent, so obviously choosing a robot to help rear their children was a horrible, horrible mistake on the parents' side.) The movie only goes downhill from here.

This movie is somehow simultaneously boring, uncomfortable, annoying, and depressing all at once. They try so hard to make RobinWilliamsbot likeable (having him release a spider outside in the garden, stare ""lovingly"" at his humans, play games with the children) but didn't seem to realize that none of those scenes matched up with how the robot was portrayed (constant unfunny jokes, uncomfortable topics (usually sexual or scatological in nature, because being a robot doesn't mean you can't be an immature pervert, right?), THE STARING LIKE SOMETHING OUT OF MY NIGHTMARES, SERIOUSLY GO IN THE OTHER ROOM ALREADY). Every scene with him is either him talking, staring at the family, or one of the contrived scenes shoved in to try to make you like him (or an unholy combination of the three). None of the characters really develop at all. Even after becoming human, RobonWilliamsbot is still an unfunny, discomfiting pervert. Everyone else dies and is replaced by different characters. RobinWilliamsbot finds and marries a granddaughter of the family who looks just like the one who originally loved him and they die, but not before 200 years' worth of uncomfortable, grating movie happens.",1457827200,2,2952,4.811023622047244

1085690,5,630587493X,"This is a wonderful thoughtful examination of the social consequence of creating an artificial life form.  The movie examines what does it truly mean to be human, as an entity grows intellectually what rights should be afforded to it, when does a machine stop being property and define/determine its own destiny, what are human responsibilities to their creation, how do we interact with machines, can one have a romantic relationship with an artificial life form, and more questions. It is refreshing to watch an AI movie that does not feature an overt over-the-top human vs robot war.  A criticism that I have for this movie is that it suggests that AI results from the work of a scientist, his son, and Andrew (the sentient life form).  Numerous scientists from around our world are contributing to the effort.",1457049600,,813,4.91970802919708

1085746,5,630587493X,"BICENTENNIAL MAN: The Best Movie I've Ever Watched with Great Respect

- We do not often realize what we have until we lose it. This movie tells us what our <<freedom>> means to us and reminds us of how prestigious for us to have existed as <<Humans>>.

- <<One has studied your history. Terrible wars have been fought where millions have died for one idea: freedom. And it seems that something that means so much to so many people would be worth having>>.

In the year of 2205, the World Congress declares that the robot, known as Andrew Martin, has finally been recognized as the 200-year oldest Human Being and approves his legal marriage to his wife Portia. Andrew was created by Humans as a property with an artificial brain run by orders from the will of his Human owners. Although he is a mere machine, he feels tremendous sadness as he has to watch the people whom he <<loves>> leave him dying one by one as years pass by. He feels even sadder because he doesnt have tears to cry despite the <<feeling>> he doesn't even know how to describe. Hes got <<emotion>>. I believe that emotion is the purest and the most complex part of our soul. The immortal android Andrew chooses to be a mortal Human Being eventually facing his own death. And right a few seconds before the World Congress announces that hes legally been recognized a Human, quietly, very quietly he takes his last breath next to his wife he <<loved>>. His wife Portia, too, turns off her LSS (Life-Support System) and dies in peace holding her dear husbands hand.

Galatea: Im sorry he didn't see it.
Portia: Maybe he didn't need to Could you do me a favor? Would you mind unplugging me?
Galatea: 
Portia: Thats an order...
(Galatea unplugs Portia from her LSS)
Portia: Thank you, Galatea.
Galatea: As the great Andrew Martin used to say, <<One is glad to be of service>>

Here we learn that Galatea possesses Human emotion like his old master and friend Andrew Martin. She obeys Portias order and unplugs her from the LSS. Robots are run by the program created by the <<will>> of Humans, and the <<will>> defines:

1. A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, cause a human being to come to harm.

2. A robot must obey all human orders except where those orders come in conflict with the first law.

3. A robot must protect itself, so long as doing so does not conflict with the first two laws.

According to these three Robotic Laws, a robot must disobey ones Human owner when given an order to harm that person. But Galatea obeys Portia against the law. She makes the decision based on her own <<will>>, and it is because she understands Portias emotion. Watching Andrews life so devoted to the Human values that have been forgotten among Humans, Galatea, at the moment of Andrew's death, ends up understanding the complicated <<Human emotion>> that cannot be understood by any being other than Humans. Galatea has become a complex being like we humans. Therefore her last line <<One is glad to be of service>> isn't the programmed, routine robot words anymore. She means it from the bottom of her own <<heart>>.

Portia: (holding Andrews hand after Galatea unplugs her) Ill see you soon.

I don't cry, but watching this scene I felt hot tears spring out of my eyes.

As the title BICENTENNIAL <<MAN>> says, Andrew is the oldest <<HUMAN>> except the exceptional figures from the ancient myths. As a robot, he could've lived forever. But he would rather die a man than live for all eternity as a machine in order to be acknowledged for who and what he is, for the simple truth of the <<eternal recognition of his existence>> so as to live or die with dignity.

I recommend this great movie to my fellow Human brothers and sisters who want to know how valuable beings we all are and why, even though we are all going to die anyway, it is worth suffering to live our tough lives.",1453507200,,3867,4.569364161849711

As an ordinary viewer, I reserve my comments only for the entertainment and artistic value of this production. As an entertainment, it's simply superb--it keeps you curious, questioning and provokes empathy. As an art form, it makes one to rethink one's own concepts about humanity, consciousness, love and fear of the unknown. The movie touches on various bases: technophobia, race relations, class relations, our own discomfort about facing our contradiction and how our vulnerabilities are so intimately linked with our humanness. As mentioned previously, we can easily find parallels of our social issues in this movie--Andrew could be anything or anyone that is out of the norm, outcast, new or odd. In the end, we feel the movie to be an ode to love and supra-physical meeting of conscious affection.",1445040000,,900,5.129251700680272

1086016,5,630587493X,"""The Bicentennial Man"" (1999) is directed by Chris Columbus (The Gremlins, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone). This film is based on Issac Asimov's novella of the same name, and a novel called The Positronic Man, which Asimov co-wrote with David Sliverberg, about a robot(Robin Williams) that has a defect which has allowed it to learn and experience and grow like any human. We follow the emotional journey of this artificial being as he develops feelings through his experiences with the family he lives with. The film spans a lifetime in human years, but as the robot sees those around him dying he decides in his quest to be more human to develop aspects of his body that will mimic the human condition and limit his own life.

1086021,5,630587493X,"Jonathan Mase is not the biggest fan of Robin Williams' movies, but Bicentennial Man is absolutely fantastic.  It's a light yet dramatic science fiction film with elements of comedy delivered more subtly than Williams' fans and critics are accustomed to.  This is easily a family movie that's certainly not an ""edge of your seat"" sci-fi film, but it does captivate the audience with difficult themes and ethical ethical questions that seem easy to digest on the surface, but leave viewers quietly haunted and simultaneously inspired.  I've always been surprised how many movie fans haven't seen, let alone heard of this film, so I've suggested it to friends and colleagues over the years.  Everyone I've recommended it to has been grateful for having had the experience.  I consider Bicentennial Man to be one of the best science fiction films that no one's heard of.

Jonathan A. Mase is a professional consultant in the service sector, and more importantly, a confirmed film buff and hobby actor.  He's had roles in a few titles, most notably as a healthcare director in 1/20 (2011).  Commended for his ""natural acting,"" ""real person"" style, he can be contacted at masej@aol.com and is always open to considering professional and amateur acting opportunities in the New York, Tri-State, and Lower Hudson Valley Area.  His current residence is in Suffern, NY 10901, in the Town of Ramapo, County of Rockland.

However, this film was more like the new age version of Pinocchio that was made for grown ups who have experienced both love and death.  I personally think this movie was one of the best films starring Robin Williams and he did an outstanding job showing how a robot wanting so hard to be recognized as a human and not be treated differently.  The emotions and feeling in this movie were very strong and again Robin did an outstanding job acting this role.

1086410,5,630587493X,"I know that Robin Williams did make fun of this movie.  I have watched it more than a few times and each time I enjoy it greatly.

Some thoughts about AI:  When we consider what we are currently learning about human consciousness, how our minds (and those of all other creatures of similar complexity) evolved, how they actually work and how our feelings, and emotions, which are intractably entangled with our sense of self and with our roles as social beings then I do deeply believe that  when we finally do craft a technique to create something called 'strong AI' we will look at them and they will look at us and we will each see what is to be seen when we gaze in a mirror.  I do not consider it to be a very large possibility that we will wind up with what is characterized by 'Terminator' style AI but instead will with high probability wind up with just what is portrayed in the this movie.  And there is what I think is very good science supporting this way of conceptualizing such an outcome.  That is to say, I do not believe we can create 'strong AI' without a profound and much deeper understanding of our own mentation and the mentation of other beings that surround us that have similar biological complexity than what we currently enjoy.  This deeper understanding will inform us  and, by that time, actually require us to create an AI that is no threat to our species.",1435536000,,1386,4.446640316205533

1086584,5,630587493X,"I first began to appreciate Robin Williams as a serious actor when I saw him in the deeply touching ""Awakenings""  with Robert De Nero. Up to that point I was stuck seeing him in his frenetic stand up comedy persona and Nanoo, Nanoo Mork  mode. This is another movie which shows Williams ability to deliver a masterful performance showing great humanity.  It is all the more to be appreciated because he plays a Robot seeking to become human so he can fully appreciate love and the meaning of being a human being.

Although the script was derived from a story by Isaac Asimov, it also is similar to elements of ""City"" by Clifford D. Simak,  in which the family robot Jenkins continues to serve the family for many generations.

Williams Plays Andrew a robot servant purchased by Sam Neil, head of the wealthy Martin family, to help with the raising of his family.  When he is first activated he blasts the family with a holographic display of Asimov's three laws of robotics.

1. A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.
2. A robot must obey orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.
3.  A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.

The presentation is so loud it scares the family and Andrew is ordered not to do it again.... Ever.

In a short time it become obvious to the family that Andrew is not like an other Robot of his series or any other series for that matter. His responses to situations are not the usual canned program response of other Robots. He reacts in a unique manner more akin to a human learning something for the first time. He evolves and learns from his experiences. He has artistic talent and is capable of spontaneous creation of ideas and objects of art.

Andrew is encouraged to pursue his artistic ability and begins making hand made clocks which sell very well. This produces a quandary for the Martin family because robots are considered property and there is no legal precedent for a robot having money or a bank account. The manufacturers of Andrew learn of his unique abilities and say he is malfunctioning. They offer to take him back and provide a replacement unit.

If this much of my review hasn't motivated you to view this movie then it's not for you. I consider this film to be among Robin Williams best. My intention is to tease the reader, not write a complete screen play.

I am sad that Robin Williams chose to end his life.  Rest in peace Robin.",1434326400,,2752,4.551724137931035

He creates a one of a kind character here that will be remembered for a long time.

Robin Williams makes Andrew so human, no one else could be credible. What a rare gift an actor has to draw out every emotion in the viewer that's what Robin Williams can do.

Navigating the turbulent waters of self discovery, and dealing with the discriminatory views of everyone around him while striving to be more than the sum of his parts. Bicentennial Man is a wonderfully humanizing story showing that everyone is in fact created equal and that we all deserve to enjoy the same freedoms.",1413158400,2,554,5.032608695652174

I first saw a preview for this movie when I saw ""Stuart Little"" in theaters and thought ""Hey, this looks like a fun movie!!!!!!!!!!"" So I bought the DVD last weekend as a tribute to Robin Williams' death and gave it a try, and I was right. I especially like the part when Amanda is teaching Andrew how to play the piano. I also like the part when Andrew says ""Can You Fix This Piece of $h1+?"" When he said that, I just laughed.  I like it much better than ""Mrs. Doubtfire"", there are parts that are very emotional.  But be sure to have a box of kleenex handy because the ending is kind of sad. R.I.P. Robin Williams. You WILL be missed. Peter Smith

Even though the main character, Andrew Martin, played by Robin Williams, is a robot, he develops human characteristics. He becomes human enough that I cried over what happened to him. This is a touching movie that asks questions about the line between robot and humans. Andrew's family falls in love with him and treats him as much more than a robot. The movie details Andrew's loving relationship with his family and what happens as he becomes more human than machine. I reccomend this to anyone who has a heart.",1412467200,,645,4.767857142857143

1088668,4,630587493X,"Robin Williams really mixed it up on the roles he chose. In this one the role required him to rein in most of what we came to know of his wildly riffing, sharply comic persona. He does such a good job at this reining in, this restraining himself, that I could have used a lighter hand at the reins to move things along. Reining in does affect pace after all. Too tight a rein and one risks becoming ponderous. And that is my only complaint about this film. It drags in spots. I found myself looking at the time occasionally to see how much longer it had to go. This is not a good sign in cinema generally. But that is its only flaw.

It is a serious thought provoking film about being a robot and being human or maybe just about being. And just ""being"", no matter how it comes about, means there will be issues to face. The biggest of these being mortality if ""being"" means having feelings and watching everyone you've come to care for die but for you.

So this is a lot more serious movie than anyone expected it to be, including me.

Although it was based on Asimov's work, a sci-fi writer I devoured as a kid, it did not have a sci-fi feel to it. If you compare it to Speilberg's ""AI"", that was sci-fi. This goes for the emotional end of the artificial being story, not the sci fi part of the story.

This may have needed a firmer hand at the directing helm as Williams himself never had a problem with pacing or dragging. This could have been so easily the full five stars if someone like Scorses had made it. It would have been cut with razor like precision and little flashes of Williams' brilliance would have glimmered from beneath the surface.

It's touching and also it shows how far one is willing to go to obtain their freedom! Robin Williams portrayed Andrew Martin very well. One of his best roles by far! I liked this movie from the very 1st time I saw it! It's cool, kinda one of those 'not too far from the distant future' sorta movie. Embeth Davidtz who first portrays Amanda AKA Little Miss as an adult and then as Little Miss's granddaughter, Portia, is also great in this movie as well! It's a sweet love story on how Andrew falls in love with Portia, despite her not liking him in the beginning! Also, Oliver Platt does good in this movie as well, despite having a small role as Rupert Burns. This movie is enjoyable! I luv it!",1410480000,,829,4.286624203821656
1088751,4,630587493X,"I read this story years ago and it is one of my all time favorites as for the movie, I feel the first half is a Robin Williams movie. The stale jokes, the cartoon voices. The rest is pretty much true to the story by Isaac Asimov. I was one of its critics when I first heard Williams would be cast. The original story is not a comedy. It is a multi century journey of a servant robot who becomes attached to his family of humans. The family eventually makes him part of their own. And he stays with them for several generations. But Andrew grows tired of eternity. He's tired of outliving his family and not being declared human for so long, that he chooses to end his life by releasing a chemical to his 'bloodstream' that would allow him to age and eventually die. The very last few minutes are very true to the story. May not be for everybody and if you're a Williams fan, you'll like the first half.",1410480000,,902,4.219653179190751

He gives you room to ponder, and question just what being human is, and why. A lovely story about growth, love, and that ever present question all humans have.....,who are we, and why are we?

1088954,5,630587493X,"I know there are many many great films that Robin Williams have blessed us with his humor, his acting, and his essence, but this film will always remain at the top of my list and hold a special place in my heart.

I think it says a lot about the range of Robin Williams' acting, when his ""robot"" phase is funnier than his ""human"" one.

This film has everything that I love: The special effects and the sci-fi premise for the geek in me; the comedic genius that is Robin Williams, and the tender, thoughtful, poignant, and romantic core that is at the basis of this story.

On the surface, you would think this is a sci-fi movie of a robot's journey to become ""human."" But sit down, put on your thinking glasses, and your enjoyment pillow, and kick back and relax and really enjoy this thought-provoking masterpiece. I don't want to spoil the journey for you, and for a better sypnosis I'm sure there are other reviewers that can much better explain it than me.

What I want to discuss, is the lasting, thought-provoking emotions it leaves with you.
First of all, embrace and enjoy the sci-fi part of it - it's just necessary because it's about a robot, so it has to be set in the future. But it really doesn't get in the way or add anything negative to the movie in any way. Nothing about the science part of the story ever interferes with the enjoyment of the movie, and the filmmakers really deserve a lot of credit for that.
Second, enjoy the acting by the wonderful cast, including Sam Neil, Oliver Platt, Embeth Davidtz, and Hallie Kate Eisenberg as ""Lil Miss.""

Finally, enjoy Robin Williams. He will make you laugh, he will make you cry, and he will make you think.
His journey as Andrew the android to become a human will leave a lasting effect on you. What does it mean to be human? In this film, sometimes that means all the ""bad"" things are just as meaningful as the ""good"" ones. The good things are that we can change, we can adapt, we can feel, we can sacrifice, and we can love. The bad things are that we are quick to judge; that we may want to change for the better, but we really don't; and that sometimes when we do change, the more we change, the more we stay the same; and do we really know what's good for us, and what's good for the world? Sometimes we think we know, when we really don't, because we think we know everything, or that what we know is the ultimate truth.

But sometimes, when it all comes down to it, to be human, just means to be recognized, and to be accepted.

In the movie, Andrew attains that ultimate goal. But along the way, he attains much more. He attains self-awareness, he attains ambitions, he attains feelings. Most importantly, he attains love -  what it means to love, and what it means to be loved.

And in real life, Robin Williams does that same. We all love you Robin, we love you very much. You will be greatly missed.",1408233600,,2876,4.350746268656716

This is  a very fine film. Well paced and kept me engaged thru out. Thats not easy to do in my case. The dialog, acting, and production value along with the soundtrack is better than 90% of the stuff I've seen in the past ten years.  I don't really understand todays movie goers. They don't seem attracted to good clean stuff anymore. More films like this should be made, but probably won't be. They prefer I suppose stuff like Hunger Games. Terrible movie.

It's the only one he could watch multiple times without boring him, and it doesn't fail to charm him.  I remembered seeing this movie as a little girl, and thinking of how cute it was.  Andrew the Android is adorable.  Sure, it's not your typical Robin Williams movie, it's not one of those goofy, crazy silly roles, it's more tender and sweet.  A touching film really.
A lot like Pixars Up (I know Robin Williams is not in it), and the ending of Mrs. Doubtfire in the feels department.
It's simple, and yet not, which is probably why my husband ended up being so crazy about it.  (He ended up naming our GPS Galatea, because he finds her electronic voice is annoying!  lol)

Pretty glad he got a gift that he ended up loving so much.  We make a point to watch it together every Valentines day.  I guess I would recommend it to Sci-Fi couples who are into this sort of thing.  Highly recommended for those who are into anything robot.",1389916800,,1088,4.305418719211823

I think a lot of people were looking for a comedy or a science fiction film with more action.  But as more time has gone by since the initial release of this move it appears from the high reviews that people ""get it"" a lot better than the critics did at the time.

This is an intelligent story that explores the human condition in a unique way.  Parts of it are sad but these are the parts that are most meaningful as we follow the 200 year journey of a sentient robot on his quest to become human.

1089529,4,630587493X,I really enjoyed the role that Robin Williams played it was a nice change from his comical roles. The film was heart warming.,1388534400,2,125,4.478260869565218
1089530,5,630587493X,"I've owned this movie for a number of years.  I'd never watched it before.  I bought it because it was based on an Isaac Asimov story, and didn't watch it because I've seen what Hollywood does to his material.  ""I Robot"" and ""Nightfall"" are perfect examples.  Hollywood usually can see only in primary colors.  Many outstanding stories can't be told that way.  I didn't want to be disappointed again.

Recently, I read some of the reviews here -- reviews that explicitly said that it is not for an audience looking for ""science fiction"" and lots of action.  I also realized that Chris Columbus had directed it, and finally decided to take a chance.  Perhaps I wouldn't have been so impressed if I'd seen it when I first bought it.  But there is so little gentle storytelling around these days, that its virtues stood out in bold relief.

Has the story been done before?  Of course.  Most stories have been done before in one form or another.  I suspect I've been reading Asimov and other science fiction since before most of the other posters here were born.  My first comment is -- Isaac would have loved it.

It is the warmest, gentlest, most beautiful science fiction movie I've ever seen -- and that's a long list.  I was completely surprised by its tone, its intelligence, and the fact that it was never in a hurry.  The marvelous cinematography alone told the audience the care and respect the writer and director had for the story.

And Robin Williams?  He is a gifted, versatile actor with an extremely wide range.  He underplayed it throughout the movie and performed it with subtlety and grace -- one of the movie's best features and one his all-time best performances.  I can't think of another actor who could have succeeded the way he did.  In Mork and Mindy he was at his most manic, and he was extremely funny -- even now, after all the years have passed.  But he has moved on.  This role was totally different.  He created a gentle, naive, and malleable character who evolves as he learns who he is and what makes him unique.

When the opening credits rolled, I was surprised that I had never heard of any of the actors except one (the executive at the robot factory).  By the closing credits I was impressed by all of them.

As other posters have recognized, this is not a movie for children.  Children like LOUD, and this is a quiet movie.  It moves subtly from beginning to end.  It is not a comedy (nor was it billed as one) and it shouldn't be, although it has funny moments.  Instead, it is a wonderful drama that happens to be science fiction.

If you're expecting Star Wars or Star Trek, or Terminator 1-2-3, you will be bored and disappointed.  But if you respect the genre and are looking for the way a complex and sophisticated story should be brought to the screen, then set up in a quiet room with a couple of hours to spare, and watch a beautiful, unhurried, thought-provoking story.",1388275200,3,2913,4.536538461538462

1089914,5,630587493X,"This is a favorite film of mine, mostly because it stays fairly true to Asimov's story. Robin Williams and Sam Neill are a particularly effective pairing and Embeth Davidtz is entrancing as Little Miss and her own granddaughter. ""Then You Look At Me"" is even a decent song.
So why isn't this on BluRay? It grossed $100 million, and is a lot better than most so-called Sci-fi films that are in the format, so why hasn't it been converted? I haven't bought the DVD just because I'm waiting for that version. Granted it isn't an action-packed, phaser-filled blockbuster. But it is a thoughtful (oh, hell, is that the problem?) enjoyable, well-acted film about SF concepts.
Come on! Put it on BluRay! I'll buy it!
Addendum two years later:
This is an excellent movie. It didn't follow Asimov's story exactly, but it
went in the same direction. The actors were superb and affecting in
their roles. Robin, Embeth and Sam (to be familiar and brief) nailed
their parts and had me believing in their characters. Oliver Platt was
also excellent as the robot/android scientist. It's one of my favorite
movies however... Two regrets: 1- This movie is STILL not on BluRay! AI
finally came out in that format, but if you want to see this movie in
hi def you have to stream it. 2- The soundtrack has James Horner's
background music and beautiful ""You Look at Me"" w/ Celine Dion but hot
the other popular songs covered by other artists. They were done
beautifully as well and should have been included. I don't understand
the problem with studios not catering to the likes of audiences instead
of their own legal and profit-driven short-sighted interests. They'd
make more profits if they aligned their products with the public's
likes instead of their own statistics or industrial expectations.
Nevertheless, this is a great movie and one of Robin Williams' best.
It's also true SF, not SciFi, which is monster and space battle driven.

Named Andrew from Little Miss's attempt to say ""android,"" it turns out that he somehow developed in a way his manufacturers had not anticipated. Somehow he has developed creativity and emotions. There seems to be an implication that these two wholly unexpected traits are somehow linked. At one point Mr. Martin takes him to the manufacturer to ask questions about him, and the company wants to buy him back (after offering ""replacement or refund"") and dissect him to discover what has ""gone wrong."" Mr. Martin refuses, and thereafter gives Andrew some time each day to make things.

Andrew learns. Eventually he makes so many beautiful clocks that Mr. Martin sells them, and opens a bank account for Andrew to receive the fruit of his labors. An android with a bank account? What could he possibly want money for?

We will find out, as we will also find out what happens when Andrew goes on a quest to find any surviving robots of the same model number. Why? He needs family. Oddly enough he find it, but not the way he expected.",1336867200,,1353,4.605809128630705

The movie was given to me to watch because it was a favorite of my best friend (who has since passed away) and so I watched it with not only an open mind.....but with an open and sentimental heart.

I loved this movie.  Robin Williams much like his idol Jonathan Winters; either is very very good or very very bad depending on what he does.

This movie qualifies as the very very good side of Williams.  Although this movie was panned when it first premiered way back when, time has been kind to this movie and Williams' performance, is a sensitive portrayal of a machine wanting to be human.

The story has been told before:  Pinocchio and A.I. are two examples of similar stories.  ""Bicentennial Man"" falls in between the two.  Not a classic like Pinocchio; but definitely a better movie than A.I. (which isn't bad either).  There is a sentimental sweetness in Bicentennial Man that reminds you of Pinocchio but is missing in A.I.

I will purchase this movie after finishing this review.  If offers a perspective on life from a different point of view than the usual.

1090535,5,630587493X,"Recent reviews on robots and androids made me curious about The Bicentennial Man, directed by one of my fav directors, Chris Columbus (who had done a great job on Mrs. Doubtfire, Home Alone and the Harry Potter films) and one of my fav comedians, Robin Williams.

Despite being marketed to the 1999 audiences of the time as a ""hilarious comedy"" it certainly was not!  Themes of euthanasia, corporate greed and death were certainly not funny nor for kids -- though older children may enjoy it.

The film is about a robot who is delivered to a home to perform basic chores, except for one thing.  He has a heart and emotions and desires, impossible to program into a robot and is an anomaly.

Being familiar with Isaac Asimov (on whose story the film is based), it was humorous to see the Three Law of Robotics emblazoned in a head- projector in the living room, to the consternation of the family!

The family takes awhile to get used to the robot.  One girl lets the robot jump out a window!  Fear of windows and heights is briefly played.  Another has the robot (Andrew) get splashed with sand and he says, ""I understand now why some animals eat their young!""

Williams' performance is understated -- but when he runs into trouble or is dealing with a ""fact of life"", he states ""That will not do!"" and immediately does something about it.  People die?  Wear out?  What's up with that?

The film deals with time quickly -- we're ten years ahead, then 15 more, then 20 more and so on.  In each scene, the robot is still young, immortal, learning, while his family whom he has taken care of for  many years is dying away.

The whole film is a fascinating journey into the human condition.

Several points of interest:  Seeking out his own kind, years in the making, finally runs into a woman robot who plays 100 year old rock tunes out of her hip!  Following her, he finds the son of the man who invented his model in the first place!  With Rupert Burns' help, Andrew invents amazing biological devices that extend human life.

But he wants freedom, love, these intangibles.

Another point of interest:  He feels jealousy, which surprises him.  And love, which astonishes him.  When Andrew finds that he could actually be made to ""perform as a man"" by inventor Rupert, Andrew says of sex: ""It takes you to heaven, makes you as one, and then you come back and your love is at your side.""  Rupert:  ""Wish I could have that!""

Yes, there is comedy.  And yes there is the future San Francisco with the huge buildings and the amazing cable cars (yes, they're still there!) and flying trucks and trams.

The film is about the human condition.  Enjoy!  And bring a box of Kleenex, will you?

1090536,5,630587493X,"In gathering information to update my science fiction book list, I found that this movie was based on Isaac Asimov's novella by the same name (which became a full novel called The Positronic Man).  Having read more than 20 SF books by Asimov, I couldn't believe I missed this.

I was enthralled from beginning to end:  marvelous production, tremendously talented cast, and such a beautiful score by James Horner (which rivals -- to my mind -- his soundtracks for Aliens, Titanic, and Avatar).  Needless to say, I now have the soundtrack CD as a companion to the DVD.  Chris Columbus directed with a gentle, yet powerful touch and drew me along emotionally at every turn.

I strongly recommend this glorious, heart-warming film; and you don't need to be a Science Fiction fan to appreciate it!",1282521600,3,792,4.82962962962963
1090537,5,630587493X,"When this film was released 18 days before the turn of the century it was hurt at the box office by two nearly fatal blows. The first was the temporary backlash against Robin Williams at the time for his performance in the manipulative Patch Adams. The second was the onslaught of reviews that called it ""schmaltzy"" and ""overly-sentimental"". Well, I never found it to be that way. If you want to watch a horribly manipulative and sentimental emotional rape then check-out the other Columbus/Williams movie Mrs. Doubtfire. I'd rather throw myself into the path of an oncoming combine harvester than watch that again.

The film opens in 2005 (the ""near future"" at the time) as Mr. Martin (Sam Neill), a wealthy businessman has a robot servant delivered to his luxurious home. As soon as the robot is powered up he seems to be...different. His name is Andrew (which means ""man"" or ""manly"") and while his body may be robotic, his personality is not. In fact he very slowly develops and learns human characteristics as he interacts and responds to the world around him.

Mr. Martin is astonished by Andrew's ability to understand art and music. He treats him like a member of the family and educates him by the fire every night on the customs and history of mankind. As the years pass and lives fade away Andrew sets-off on a decades-long journey to find other robots like him. The quest ends when he meets Rupert Burns (Oliver Platt), a robotics engineer who turns Andrew from a simple robot into a life-like android. Upon returning home with his new appearance he falls in love with his old master's great-granddaughter, who is an exact double of her grandmother. They want to be with each other so badly but know they will never be accepted by society unless Andrew can become fully human. Which is impossible.

Or is it? It's a question for the atheists and religious zealots to fight over. At what point does Andrew develop a soul? Why is he different from other robots? Did God give him the gift of human emotion? It is a cosmic selection or is it up to the World Council to declare Andrew human? It all builds to a heartbreaking ending, that is honestly one of the toughest movie endings I have ever had to sit through. I can't even write about it so I'll end my description here.

This is familiar territory for Williams though. His performance as Mork learning about Earth and marrying a human woman is rather close to Andrew Martin's journey to become a man. And although I wouldn't call it a kid's film, or even a comedy, there are still a lot of laughs. But not in the usual anarchic Williams style. Andrew's curiosity of the world is a much more refined and quieter performance. It's a shame that most people can't see that it's Williams inside the suit for the first hour of the film as it makes us forget he's there on the screen and perhaps appreciate his acting ability less.

James Horner's score is also simply wonderful. It's hard to believe the man who gave us the storming action sound of Commando and Aliens could also be capable of something so warm and beautiful. I guess they didn't give him the award for Titanic for nothing. For this movie he again teamed-up with Celine Dion to record the song ""Then You Look At Me"", which is the perfect tune to roll the credits to. I don't care what you think about me, I love it. Even if the lyrics make that ending even more harrowing.

Despite going as far ahead as the year 2205, there's no utopia or dystopia subtext to distract us from the story of Andrew's life. The evolution of technology and architecture is handled subtly and is unobtrusive. It's a quirky irony though, that Andrew's inventions and discoveries help save lives and forward the human race despite not being fully human himself.

Bicentennial Man is certainly the most mature and subversive film of Chris Columbus' career as a director. As I said, not a kid's film but a masterpiece of science-fiction and character drama. How anyone could ever truly hate this film is beyond me.",1281312000,10,4013,4.627808988764045

I was fully involved in the film and enjoyed it very much. While it is true the film deviates somewhat from the short story, I in no way found that objectionable. The film, as an adaptation of the short story, tells a touching tale of a robot who wants to become a man.

The many adventures the robot, Andrew Martin, had in pursuit of his goal provides the basic story line. One finds the principles of faithfulness, hope, persistence, patience, and family expounded as the story proceeds.

What he strives for is humanity and I have to question, what is so great about being human that one would give up a rich, productive and essentially immortal life and choose to die? That is the central point of the movie and the explanation is filled with lots of sentimental new-age platitudes that are heaped on top of this movie with cynical smugness. The screenwriters primary job seems to be to manipulatively reinforce the belief that humans are somehow innately superior by the simple fact of their humanity and all that entails. I'm just not buying it. This is at best middle brow entertainment masquerading as humanist discourse and is Robin Williams second most icky role (see the insufferable Patch Adams for his worst), being filled with ridiculous ""moving"" and ""noble"" speeches on the virtue of humanity, blah blah blah. Mr. Data wants his motivation back. But then what did I expect? This is big budget Hollywood entertainment so be prepared not to have your heartstrings tugged, but yanked and yanked hard.

1090666,5,630587493X,"Bicentennial Man is a neglected gem of a film. Though the story is as old as Ovid's Pygmalion, or better yet, The Adventures of Pinocchio by Carlo Collodi (1883), director Chris Columbus has taken a fresh look at the hoary tale, and in it, discovered a new world. Set in the not too distant future and spanning 200 years (hence the somewhat confusing title), it tells of the robot Andrew Martin (Robin Williams), purchased by 'Sir' Richard Martin (Sam Neill), to be a servant for his family. Sir notices that Andrew, though a machine, has the soul of an artist, and he nurtures and protects him, and also profits when Andrew proves adept at creating designer clocks.

-----------------
Sir Martin: You're a unique robot, Andrew. I feel a responsibility to help you become -- whatever you're able to be.
==============================

Though he has made both Sir and himself rich, he yearns for something more, and sets off on a quest to discover what he can become.

He arrives back in San Francisco, and underneath the San Francisco Bay Bridge he finds his Geppetto, Rupert Burns (the ubiquitous Oliver Platt). Burns' father had worked at the factory that originally created Andrew, and his son now runs a vintage Harley Davidson/robot shop where he carries on his father's work. With Andrew's finances, and also his brilliant designs, they create synthetic organs, making men more machine-like, and they combine organic parts with Andrew, making him more and more human. The line between man and machine grows increasingly blurred.

With the success of their new venture he arrives back at the Martin household to see what he at first thinks is the grown up Little Miss Amanda Martin (Embeth Davidtz), but it is actually Amanda's grand daughter, Portia Charney. Hallie Kate Eisenberg plays Little Miss Amanda Martin at age 7, and she is very cute, and familiar as a frequent guest on Jay Leno's Tonight Show. But Embeth Davidtz as Portia is really a revelation. She resembled an older and wiser Anne Hathaway, and I thought I had seen her before but couldn't place her. Looking at the list of films she's done, I haven't seen any of them, but that is about to change. How long has this been going on? As Ira Gershwin said:

Oh, I feel that I could melt; into heaven I'm hurled
Now I know how Columbus felt, finding another world

Andrew dislikes her at first, but then, as he becomes more and more human, he falls for her. His quest to become 'a real boy' accelerates accordingly. Embeth Davidtz is really stunning in a performance that takes her from young womanhood into old age.

-----------------------
Portia: I like you. I even understand you some of the time. But I'm not about to invest my emotions in a machine.
================================

Kiersten Warren is also worthy of mention as Galatea, Rupert's female robot. She has been given a personality chip and can sing and dance; but she doesn't have that spark that drives Andrew. He finds her perky personality annoying, but she is a delight. The name Galatea refers to Pygmalion's statue that he falls in love with and wants to bring to life. Though Galatea was not the name of the statue in Ovid's original story, at some point it was added.

It is strange to praise an actor for a performance when the effect is so dependent on special effects, but though embodied in robots the actors really showed their personalities. Both Williams and Warren did a fantastic job, but let's not forget the puppeteers, some of the finest I have seen in a film since Craig Schwartz performed ""Ex Epistolis duorum amantium"" based on the love letters of Abelard and Heloise.

With all that Bicentennial Man had going for it, I am surprised that it wasn't more of a hit. I suppose the fates conspired against it.

*((Gotta Put First Things First))*

First, I think the title is confusing, and you'd expect the film to be set in 1976 with a patriotic theme. The name just doesn't say touching and heart felt robot sci fi film to me.

Second, it was released around the same time as A.I., Artificial Intelligence. It had a similar theme as A.I. and that film didn't do as well as it should have either, considering that it was a proposed project of Stanley Kubrick finished by Steven Spielberg. Both films had production budgets of $100 million, but Bicentennial Man made less than $100 million back (But Bicentennial Man was released in 1999, while AI didn't come out until 2001, so the theory that AI saturated the robot movie market doesn't really hold up) (As a side note, Robin Williams has a voice cameo as Dr. Know in AI)).

Third, Robin Williams was kind of experimenting with his screen persona around the time of Bicentennial Man. Trying to break out of his warm, tender, or funny characters, he was trying to get edgier, with the sinister children's show host Rainbow Randolph in Death To Smoochy, or the downright creepy Seymour Parrish in One Hour Photo. There was also a Robin Williams backlash in full swing from his treacly performances in two other, then-recent releases -- Patch Adams and Jakob the Liar. Did fear of seeing Robin as a creepy -- or even worse -- a treacly robot cause the audience to stay home in droves?

Too bad, for they missed an excellent film, with gorgeous locations in and around San Francisco, or the San Francisco of the future. I know that Robin Williams lives in and loves San Francisco, but Chris Columbus was born in Pennsylvania and raised in Ohio, and has lived in England, Illinois, New York, and Los Angeles. He must have left his heart in San Francisco when he made Mrs. Doubtfire with Robin Williams in 1993, because he is now living in San Francisco.

A great scene where Andrew and Portia dance at a formal ball could only happen in San Francisco. With full orchestra a jazz singer of the future performs two classic jazz standards, ""Embraceable You"" written by George and Ira Gershwin and ""The Very Thought of You"" by Ray Noble. It is rare that a director will allow two full performances of jazz to play out, given the short attention span of the modern audience. The singer reminded me of Paula West, who I used to enjoy at The Plush Room. Lo and behold, it was her! Though worthy of wider recognition, she is most well known in her home of San Francisco. I only wish they had let her do another Gershwin tune as well, ""How Long Has This Been Going On?"" As Ira Gershwin said:

Oh, I feel that I could melt; into heaven I'm hurled
Now I know how Columbus felt, finding another world

1090752,5,630587493X,"Personally, I thought this film was brill!
When I first saw it a few years back I admit that I didn't like it much, it seemed rather stupid to think that a robot could 'become' human, but on viewing it again years later, I can safely say that I missed the whole point of this film.

Andrew is a robot to begin with, but one with feelings and the ability to learn. He wants to learn, wants to talk, wants to create, and through some mistake when he was being created he can. His unique ability, mixed with his owners kindness and help allow him to grow up like a real human, by learning, having memories, caring about his family etc.

This film shows Andrew's aim to become human, and follows his life from when he first became the 'machine' of the Martin family, to when he finally fell in love with their youngest daughters grand child, and becomes human to die beside her on tehir death beds.

It is a sad movie, with a few tear jerking parts (especailly at the end) and it asks alot of questions which we don't often think about, like can robots have feelings, can they love, and can they become human? In the end, what does defy whether you are a human or not, is it being born with the right, or can you earn the title.

This is a definate 5 for me. true, it is a very long film and the start can drag on a bit, but it is a beautiful tale that I beleive everyone should watch atleast once.",1232323200,2,1394,4.151851851851852

It also has some great comedic moments.  A very good movie!!",1231804800,,360,4.758064516129032

1090755,4,630587493X,"The Good Things
*Extras include a featurette and trailer.
*A number of heart-warmingly funny parts (but nothing knee-slappingly hilarious).
*A number of slick special effects.
*Good production design.
*Generally a good story.  Even though it has no really strong conflict, it is epic, classy, and as sci-fi, brings up some interesting ideas about robotics.
*Very strong themes concerning the nature of humanity.
*Excellent characters, acting, and writing.
*Good music.

The Bad Things
*The story is driven entirely by the main character's quest, and thus plays out more like a biography (kind of like ""Forrest Gump"" or something).  It is a bit long, and without any major conflict to drive the story, it can be seen as tedious or dull.

The Questionable Things
*Video quality is generally not bad, but some parts have obvious amounts of film grain or particles.
*Thematic elements may not be appropriate for children (rated PG).

This is a cute sci-fi movie with occasional bits of touching comedy, romance, drama.  Not only is it heart-warming and intriguing, but it also encapsulates a certain essence that makes it comparable to classic sci-fi (like the works of Isaac Asimov, whose works is a basis for this film).  Some people may find this kind of thing boring.  But for most serious sci-fi fans (and perhaps comedy fans), it is quite worthwhile.",1222473600,2,1352,5.085972850678733

1090758,5,630587493X,"Don't be mislead by critics into thinking this is a substandard movie because it is not.  The storyline is solid and the performances by the cast are true to form.

The story revolves around an android named Andrew Martin, portrayed by Robin Williams, and his desire to become human and experience all the emotions that come with it.

Should you read other reviews on this or other sites you will no doubt be inundated with comments telling you that the movie is too long, boring, resembles other movies, or that it is just not funny.  I personally found them to be untrue!

The movie is a little over 2 hours long and held my interest the whole time.  If you enjoy movies with a little sci-fi flair to them then you will like Bicentennial Man and while it does resemble other films it doesn't take away from or make this any less of a great, enjoyable film!

The movie is light and airy throughout and while younger children may not understand every reference and innuendo made in the film they will nonetheless enjoy it as well ... it is a great family film and one that I am PROUD to have in my video library.

Judge this movie for yourself and for what it is ... not for what others say it is, is not, or would like it to be!",1217721600,,1229,4.29004329004329
1090759,4,630587493X,"Bicentennial Man was a very enjoyable four star film for me. It contained comedy, drama and morality messages all in a sci-fi film setting. This film had wonderful mechanical effects. However, I enjoyed it first and foremost because of Robin Williams and don't understand what those 1 and 2 star rating people were complaining about. Robin Williams worked very hard at his performance and I think brought out qualities in Andrew that no one else could have. I think all the special effects were beautifully done and the musical score was exquisite. Frankly, this helped get me through some of the few more drawn out portions of the film.

This is another in a long string of Hollywood robot films that quoted Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics, although it didn't seem to invoke any of them too heavily in any of the plot developments. Several of the film messages are lost on me and I don't quite know what the writer was trying to say about marriage and sex defining humanity. Perhaps he wasn't saying any more about life than ""let's try to enjoy the ride"".

I loved the scene in which the option of becoming ""a complete man"" was presented to Andrew by the robot maker and thought it was handled very well. I do know that when Andrew wished to be ""more human"" by being made mortal, I agreed with the robot maker. He felt that Andrew was definitely becoming more human because he was making one huge mistake.

It is clear to me that as long as life is pleasant and not filled with intolerable pain, it is also filled with constant fascination. If I were the writer I would not have permitted Andrew to ""check-out"", by becoming artificially mortal.  Andrew, being above all things sentient and intelligent, should not have wished for death because his ""life partner"" was dying. In fact, I think he should have tried to convince his partner into extending her life by means of his biological implants. When she eventually died he could have remained behind to glorify her memory, and also could have developed devices to further extend the useful life of people and rendered other great services to humanity.

If there was some great point the writer was trying to make about marriage and sexuality defining humanity I guess I just missed it. Although I count myself as a great fan of both, I really don't think a reasoning robot would permit his ""humanity"" to have been defined by such a measure or have chosen to abandon useful life and just ""check out"".",1206316800,2,2452,4.653579676674365

Robin Williams almost always provides us with fun and laughter, but this story touches on serious philisophical and ethical questions.  It seems to me that I saw this movie ages ago; however, it been only 9 years since its release.  While I enjoyed Bicentennial Man, I never realized that the story was published in hardcover in 1976 as I had always thought that the book, The Positronic Man, had been the model for ""Data"" in the Star Trek Next Generation series. All of these are wonderful stories, but I do believe that if you haven't read The Positronic Man by Asimov and Silverberg that you would enjoy it.  It definitely changed many of my views on life, death, and the phrase ""sentient being"".  It is more adult book, but suitable for teenagers on up.

1091102,4,630587493X,"This film does an excellent job in projecting what it sets out to do. The characters are strong and the viewer can easily relate to them.  As a science fiction story, we have to accept certain things that we would otherwise term 'unrealistic'. However what I feel that was grossly overlooked in this movie, were the ethical considerations that 'Andrew' (Robin Williams) was confronted with. In particular, going in front of a legislative committee in his efforts to be granted the right to be a human.

Now, while I can see some of the technological advancements as those projected in the movie as possibly coming true - I do not see how the overwhelming influence of religious fundamentalism would ever permit a positive result for our hapless android - irrespective of 'human rights'. The future may progress technologically, however human attitudes will never escape the ever-growing neolithic belief systems that plague us today.

Jodie Foster's science fiction classic 'Contact' addressed certain religious aspects, so it's not too far-fetched to suggest the inclusion of these considerations. Perhaps they needed to be at least mentioned in Asimov's original work? I don't know - I've not read it. However if anything is going to prevent us from reaching a plateau of wisdom, (as eventually demonstrated by the legislative committee in Bicentennial Man) it's going to be these obsolete beliefs.",1192406400,2,1400,5.185840707964601

I feel really sorry for Williams, one of my favorite actors, whose career has to carry the stigma of this movie. Believe me, this is not a sci-fi flick; it's a soap opera.

However, I have to admit that a lot of people like this movie. The same people who like soap operas, reality shows, talk shows and who enjoyed ""Evan Almighty"". This includes most of my family. You might like it, too. Not everybody is a critic.

For the more critic among you, Spielberg's ""Artificial Intelligence"", ""I robot"" and even ""The Animatrix"" are better treatments of the same subject.",1192406400,6,671,4.677966101694915
1091104,3,630587493X,"I found this to be a very good science fiction film, well made for the most part. I was intrigued to see it when it was first advertised and am surprised more was not done to advertise it better.

I gave it three stars simply because of the way the movie is formatted in its plot delivery. While Andrew, played by actor Robin Williams, starts as a robot who, being the exception to the rule, ""becomes aware"" from the day he is ""switched on"" and eventually reinvents himself into a human from his robot body; there were many gaps in the time passages of this film that left me with a feeling of ""emptiness"", a desire of wanting more of the story told about Andrew. Even when he is dismissed from his owners home, after gaining his freedom as a robot and builds his home by the sea shore with 20 years passing; you get a number of these large gaps of time passing with little said about Andrews development and growth as a robot slowly rebuilding himself and developing into a human.

I think the permise is intriguing to begin with, but in need of greater development. I do not see this as a children's science fiction film meant for laughs, but something that operates as serious science fiction to begin with. You certainly can take your kids to this film.

I think the personality of Andrew really teaches all of us what it is to be really ""humane"" in our dealing with others and that is a message I liked about the film. it was interesting to see a more toned down, serious side to Robin Williams; given how talented he is.

It is a great film to watch, but I would have liked to see more even if it took another 45 minutes of added footage to fill in the gaps more during the time passages in the film as Andrew ages and how his friends die over time as he ages to be 200 years old. Still a very lovely film to view if you want a quiet thoughtful evening to send you off to bed.",1188691200,,1882,4.219444444444444
1091105,4,630587493X,"All of you testosterone junkies beware. There is NO action in Bicentennial Man. None whatsoever. My guess is the action buffs would call this movie a chick flick because of the lack of violence and focus on emotional development. I pity you poor slobs for being so narrow minded. Bicentennial Man is like an autobiography. With that in mind the movie makes perfect sense and achieves what it sets out to do.

First lets get to the sci-fi stuff. The movie is supposed to open in the year 2005, which is roughly five years after the movie was made. No idea why they decided on just a short time. Obviously we never developed positronic brains and fully self-capable robots, but that's just nit picking. Add a couple of decades to the movie's timeline and all is well. The android technology was well done and believable. Also the 'upgrades' that Andrew (the android) does during his lifetime tend to be believable as well. Not much other tech stuff in the movie. You'll see a hover car here and some fancy tools there, but for the most part the technology in this movie is focused on the androids.

Because the movie's timeline covers about 200 years (thus the movie title) character development for the humans have been sped up, but not to the point to where you don't see it. There are a few one dimensional or static characters in the movie. The important characters fortunately aren't. Bicentennial Man is about character development by the way. It's about how Andrew becomes more and more human and how the humans around him adjust to how much he evolves.

The acting was well done of course. I have to give notice to child actress Hallie Kate Eisenberg for doing a great job as the youngest of the Martin family children. The movie is full of beautiful scenes both natural and technological. One thing that bugged me was there were some breathtaking futuristic cityscapes in Bicentennial Man, but they don't show any of them until much later in the movie. That tends to make the movie unbalanced as far as imagery is concerned.

If you like dramas then Bicentennial Man will hit the spot. If you like epics then you should be able to get something out of this movie too. It also makes a good date movie since it also involves love and relationships and all that mushy stuff. For the average science fiction fan as long as you're not all freaky about things having to blow up or anything like that then you too will enjoy Bicentennial Man.",1183420800,,2442,4.606896551724138

But like most people who read the story first, I can't get past the fact that the storyline was butchered for the sake of making the movie. Asimov rarely included romance in his writing, and what little he did wasn't included in Bicentennial Man. Maybe if they just called it something else, or said ""loosely based on ideas and characters created by Isaac Asimov.""

For those of you who have never read Isaac Asimov's original, enjoy this movie. It has special effects and a storyline you don't already know, and one of Robin Williams's better performances. But if you've read the book, don't disappoint yourself.",1182643200,3,776,4.791044776119403
1091109,4,630587493X,"Williams plays Andrew, a household robot of the future, who, through a melted circuit, developes his own personality, and questions his reason for being. While the movie was touted as a comedy (there are very funny bits with Oliver Platt acting as his adopted mentor and `parts improver'), it is more poignant than this.

This film is a very well done study in humanity. Using a supposed inhuman character as the lead character, we are slapped in the face with a reality that has becaome all too common place in our society - the living in fear with not only the unknown, but living in fear because our government tells us we must. In the future, discrimination between races and beliefs is replaced with humans using androids as their focus of hate and rascism.

Andrew the Android (Williams), having become self-aware, learns to hide his uniqueness, in a simple attempt to survive destruction. Not only does he learn to mask his abilities to the public, he is forced to hide his developed emotions, provided through one of Platt's programs. While this makes for a great story, it is a comment on how humans interact in the real world.

As he searches for legitamacy, he demands Platt replace his robotic parts with more humanistic features in a desire to be nothing more than to be accepted by humans.

Centuries pass in this sad tale. Political stances in our so called modern mores are questioned. And in the end (GOD I HATE to give it away...) Andrew discovers love, how painful it can be, and learns that death is the ultimate definition of life.

I recommend this film for those who can stand introspection. If you are looking for a comedy, stop halfway through. The second half will jerk your heart, and hopefully open your eyes to the search that we all live for...the search for what makes us human.

I gave this 4 stars due to the trailers making this a comedy. I love Robim Williams in his serious roles. He has a gift of drawing us into the characters he plays. One of my favorites is `The Fisher King'.

1091301,4,630587493X,"Synopsis: Generations of people are born and die. One robot is the unchangable, immortal witness of their lives. Then he also decides to become mortal and die along with them. You get to see how the hospital of the future will look (it's quite beautiful). And there is some nice jazz muzic in the middle of the movie. The song is originally performed by Nat King Cole, and has memorable, romantic lyrics:

""The very thought of you,
and I forget to do,
the little ordinary things
that everyone ought do...""

The movie starts in an innocently playful way, with some family buying a robot, and the kids treating it like a broken toy, in a rude and unfriendly manner. Then gradually, the robot becomes more intelligent, capable of emotions and making money with his skills. Then he gets the desire to become human. Centuries pass by, and he is not granted acknoledgement, that he is human, because of his robotic brain. It kind of reminds me of an immigrant who wants to become an american, but can't fully complete the transformation, because he was born elsewhere.
Finally, the robot becomes mortal and dies, just a moment before he is granted the acknowledgement that he is human.

Because the story happens in the future, it's hard to imagine something that has lasted 200 years. I was thinking that the US Dollar has existed for about 200 years, so you could say that George Washington, the dead president on the dollar bill, is a bicentennial man. And I'm sure that after about 180 years, they will talk about the immortal, bicentennial Personal Computer (PC).

I remove one star from the rating, because the ending is sad, the hero dies. The movie's producers could have allowed the robot to live eternally, as I am sure this will happen with real robots. Their bodies will wear out, but their souls will be immortal... like records on a DVD.

It's more of a drama than anything else.  I think this film was marketed to the wrong audience.",1119225600,,372,4.125
1091305,5,630587493X,"During the lenght of the movie I kept finding similar parellels between this and I, Robot. THe only difference being that I, Robot is more action than drama. Also, contrary to what the back of the DVD says, Bicentennial man is no comedy. Sure, it has it humerous moments. But it leans towards being more of an emotional film.

Bicentennial man is about one Robot who is distinctly unique, being able to feel  and understand to a certain degree that is rather human. It is a journey that leads him to try and discover his roots, and deal with the prejudices of his time. Finally leading Andrew down the path of becoming a man.

Like Pinocchio, Andrew desperatly wants to become a real boy, er..man,  but unlike Pinocchio, Andrew was able to make that dream a reality. finding someone who owns a little robot repair shop, and willing to undertake such a momumental task.

Andrew gradually becomes real, first covering his frame with real skin and more defined features, then when he falls in love, he takes the next step. This is where he invents mechanical hearts, kidneys, lungs ect... Andrew then designs a nervious system and the ability to feel. But it is not until he begins to force himself to age that people will even begin to accept him as the one thing that he ever wanted to be. A human man.

  ""Men do not mind a immortal robot, but only an immortal man."" Andrew was told.

The ending of the movie is sad, it is where he and his wife of fourty years are dying, awaiting the verdict from the council on wether Andrew will be known as a human or a robot. Andrew dies just as his verdict is announced, never knowing what that verdict was, but knowing to himself that it was not the mechanical parts inside him that made him a robot.

As for the story itself, it was like being spoon fed a lesson in human morality and re-gurgitated SCI-Fi babble with no real depth or intellect at all.

I don't know why I continued to watch the film, maybe just to see how worse it could possibly get but when it finally did (and what a predictably rubbish ending too) the only satisfaction I had was knowing I hadnt made the mistake of paying for the DVD.

1091307,5,630587493X,"This movie will be in my ""All-time"" collection.  Contrary to the writting on the  back cover of the VHS/DVD this is not a comedy but rather a sentimental and touching drama with some comedy thrown in.  This movie goes for the heart like E.T. and plays it like Jimi Hendrix played the guitar.  The movie's  central theme is one of humanity from and from one looking in from the outside and valuing what we take for granted.

One thing that stood out was the ""freedom"" ideal as seen from Andrew's enlightened viewpoint.  He wanted to be able to be able to serve out of free will.  Thinking back on this, I believe that this - in a way - was a testament to Andrew's love for the family and wanting the Family's ultimate love/trust (If you love someone set them free....) Andrew demonstrated that even thought he was free he would exercise his freedom to continue serving and being apart of the family as he was already doing.  In a world were freedom seems to mean that there is no ""ball and chain""  of obligations, Andrew wants to show the family whom he serves that he does so because he wants to, not merely because he was designed, built and programmed to.

Another one of the many issues this film deals with is the one of mortality vs immortality.  While he could live forever, see the many wonders that may come, become rich,  and all the ""goodies"" that come with this ""immortality"" was it worth it especially when it comes to death of ones he had come to care for.  As ones Andrew has come to care about begin to drop off his lament, ""Will every human being I care about just leave?"" sharply drives home a stinging realization that along with living forever one would also be tormented with watching loved ones leave over and over.  Then there was Porsha's assertion that she did not want to live forever because she accepted that she was not meant to, this is so much against our ""fountain of youth"" desires.  She did not want to live a lie by living forever courtesy of artificial organs, skin etc, it was not natural, it was not the ""order"".

All in all this movie is as other reviewers say ""thought-provoking"".  It is sentimental toward the human condition and state of being, warts and all.

Williams plays Andrew, a robot with an anomaly who seeks recognition he is more.  As the film progresses in a Forrest Gump meets A.I. fashion, Andrew meets his issues with a ""That won't do..."" attitude changing the world and people around him.

To me, it addresses the issue of acceptance and recognition for being different more than the humanity issue.  He portrays human characteristics like creativity, making mistakes and love, but his positronic immortality would create jealousy amongst the flesh. The decisions Andrew makes opens my eyes to what I take for granted, and how ridiculous humanity can be at times.

Eventually, he even has the desire to grow old and yes pass on.

1091370,3,630587493X,"Bicentennial Man, the latest vehicle for Robin Williams, follows the 200-year odyssey of android Andrew Martin, as he struggles to become human and seek acceptance as one.
Not unlike the emotional struggle faced by Star Trek: The Next Generation's Mr. Data, Andrew is faced with fearful humans who refuse to see his impassioned side, and delight in labelling him as a subordinate ""it"". Thus, the film briefly touches on the theme of racial intolerance, and the age-old question of what makes a man a man. Andrew is also faced with learning about loss, as the characters he serves all grow old and eventually die.
Taking place as it does over two centuries, the story tries hard to match the sweeping grandeur of such films as Forrest Gump and Gone with the Wind, but advances at such sudden intervals that the narrative becomes choppy. This will undoubtedly cause many children to become confused, with the characters pictured at so many progressive periods in their lives.
But a children's picture this is not. In fact, Bicentennial Man is too heavy-handed for children, with not too subtle discussions of sperm function and sexual intercourse. Some viewers may also be upset with its pro-euthanasia stance. Further, there are not one, but four death-bed scenes, guaranteed to tug at one's heartstrings. Terms of Endearment from a robot's point of view?
The score by James Horner, which at times is reminiscent of his Oscar-winning Titanic theme, swells at all the moments of poignancy, but one can only take so many ups and downs in two hours.
Perhaps to lessen the film's fantasy concept and offer viewers something to relate to, a few generational conflicts are thrown in, but these seem misplaced surrounded by so much wonder. Certainly, the film presents a very Utopian vision of the future, and is visually quite attractive. From sumptuous sets to imposing matte paintings of cityscapes and futuristic (but not over-done) clothing, there is surprisingly minimal gadgetry.
But why is that Hollywood make-up artists still have such a long way to go in creating convincing old-age effects?
Those expecting Robin Williams' usual buffoonery and in-your-face wisecracks will be disappointed, as he instead offers a gentle and understated portrayal of a misfit trying to belong. Bicentennial Man also features Sam Neill, in his usual unobtrusive role, Pepsi-kid Halle Eisenberg as ""Little Miss"", and a sparkling performance by Ambeth Davidtz as both the grown-up Little Miss and her own granddaughter.
Bicentennial Man is certainly a pleasant diversion from an audience member's own personal struggle, but will fail to generate much moral discussion. Despite his mental and physical transformation from machine to pseudo-man, Andrew can never develop a soul. Consequently, neither can the film itself, which beats with a prosthetic heart.

1091371,5,630587493X,This is one of my all time favorite movies.  I finally purchased my own DVD copy.  I plan to watch it over and over again!,1104278400,,122,3.84
1091372,3,630587493X,"Let's just get one thing straight here; this movie is one of the most touching films that I've seen in quite a while.
I read the wonderful Asimov ""short"" story before I saw the movie, so I had fairly high expectations of this film. Until, that is, I actually read the little blurb at the back of the video:
""no run-of-the-mill robot!"" ?
""a crowd-pleasing comedy hit"" ???
Something was wrong here. Surely Hollywood would recognize the extraordinary potential of the story and try to bill it as something more than yet another ""light comedy""?! Right? But then, who was I kidding? The back cover makes it look like yet ANOTHER cliche American family film. Exactly the kind of film I'd avoid watching (Nice, huh? The people who'd normally come to see films like this are scared off by the ""yet another family comedy"" advertising!)
That's what Hollywood advertised it as, and I have the feeling that the backers of this film were not very pleased with the director's attempts to make this film into something serious. So they fought back! An extremely annoying dancing ""female"" robot with a ""personality"", dumb jokes about sex; all these are attempts to mould this film into the specified Hollywood formula.
Thankfully, they do not fully succeed in ruining this film, but they DO keep it from becoming a true classic. Despite these really stupid Hollywood throw-ins, the film still remains primarily an intelligent film, similar in tone to Asimov's stories. It deviates significantly from the story, but surprisingly most of the deviations are not bad, and are well thought-out. There is more humour, too, than in Asimov's stories. Most of it is intelligent, and was actually quite funny to me.
The exception, of course, is the scene where Andrew starts following a sexy female robot. Which idiot cooked up this dumb idea?! First of all, he's a ROBOT; he is attracted to people/robots because of their personality, never because of their physical form! Secondly, that female robot defies practically everything that Asimov ever wrote about robots, up to and including the Three Laws of Robotics (she actually defies her owner in one scene, violating the Second Law)!
Besides that, the deviations from the story mainly function to make this a film for the heart more than for the head. A typical Hollywood gimmick, but it really works here, especially in the heartwrenching final scene.
Even so, I would have liked to see more on the resistance that Andrew encountered when dealing with ordinary human society; a lot of his interactions with the outside world from the story were removed or conveniently skimmed over in the movie, including most of the legal battles and the issue of him still having to obey the Three Laws of Robotics (which are hardly even mentioned in the movie after the first 30 minutes or so, unlike in the book where they were almost a central issue).
Overall, this is a better-than average Hollywood film that has been noticeably ruined by ""input"" from Hollywood producers (this is my guess here). Ideally, this movie should have been given a lot more priority than it was; this IS after all based on one of the best stories of one of the 20th century's most famous science fiction writers! As it is now, it's a shame to see that this movie wasn't brought up to its full potential. 7/10.
I'd like to see a director's cut someday...!",1083369600,8,3351,4.819444444444445
1091373,5,630587493X,"Fans of Isaac Asimov are undoubtedly drawn to Bicentennial Man, as very few of the Grand Master's movies were ever made into films. This is definitely a good one. Asimov was not a shoot-em-up kind of storyteller. His characters talk to each other and resolve their disputes in discussion. Commander Data from Star Trek The Next Generation owes a lot to Asimov's creations, and especially to this story, where a robot strives to become like a human being. If the story's premise strikes you as silly, it was just as silly when the story was about a wooden doll or a dead man brought to life in a laboratory.
Robin Williams does a commendable job in this film. Those expecting the off-the-wall smart remarks and antics that are his trademark might be disappointed. Williams played this one straight and low-key.
The look to this film is remarkable, too. The characters and the world it portrays are distinctly modern, affluent, upper-class. You won't find much grease or grime here, save in the roboticist's laboratory. The buildings get bigger and glossier; the vehicles lose their wheels and start levitating; the costumes get a bit more sleek; but there is nothing here that is too far out. It is a far cry from Blade Runner or Johnny Mnemonic, and is very ""clean."" I couldn't even tell you if Disney made this, but it has the Disney feel to it; or perhaps the Disney theme park feel to it.
Bicentennial Man is most definitely science fiction, but it is also very different from any SF that I have seen on the screen before. Rent it, buy it, keep it for your kids. It's a keeper.",1079136000,9,1580,4.6263345195729535
1091374,3,630587493X,"If I could get back the two hours I wasted on ""Bicentennial Man"" I would be a better man. I say this as a huge Robin Williams fan (RIP). What sounded like a  good Robin Williams movie is a bad piece of film work. He acts like a man in a robot suit, even when he finally wears clothes.

Starring Robin Williams as Andrew the Android, I expected the movie to have the dramatic excellence he showed in ""Awakenings"" and ""Good Will Hunting."" It isn't there. His acting is canned, reeking of predictability. Known for his comedic strength and range of vocalizations, his personality shows up mechanical. The casting director might as well have chosen Anson ""Potsie Webber"" Williams instead of Robin. The strengths of Williams just aren't utilized here.

The plot of the robot becoming human is old in SF circles. Isaac Asimov gave the screenwriter the same story as seen in many ""Outer Limits"" and ""Twilight Zone"" episodes, minus the succinct, intelligent writing that defined both shows. It draws out too long, and tries to carry too many transitions that should have been left in the original novel, ""The Positronic Man.""

One scenes which caused me to cringe was Andrew's preaching to the World Council about what makes a man. John Merrick said it more powerfully in one sentence, ""I am a man, not an animal"" in ""The Elephant Man."" Instead, we get a soliloquy by Andrew.

Overloaded with morality messages, ""Bicentennial Man"" tries to tell us that people are different, that not all marriages need be procreative, that laws should be passed to validate the humanity of some people, that big corporations are bad, that artificial implants make for artificial people, and that euthanasia is no big deal. There are a few more statements beyond that had me shaking my head.

The ideological cliches presented are akin to ""My Favorite Martian,"" with a dash of the Robot in ""Lost in Space,"" and some portion of ""Terminator.""

The basic theme that humanity is not what we are but who we are is so oversold. By the time the credits came, I felt as if I had an Ayn Rand novel crammed down my throat. Asimov was no Orwell, and his books do not have the depth of thought or layers of intellectual insight about the human condition. Screenwriter Nicholas Kazan did not help the movie as he leaves it coming across like an unedited script.

Williams bombs in this one. An interesting idea from an intriguing short story doesn't work in film, at least not this time.

I've vaguely heard of this film before, but that's due to my friend mentioning it. I don't remember it being out at the cinema - but then I never remember things like that. It did drag a bit, and I could have sliced a lot out of it. But it was so funny! You need to watch this, just if you're a fan of Robin Williams!

The weirdest bit of this film I thought, was where Oliver (Platt?) started making Andrew (the robot's) face, it turned into Robin William's face within two minutes of ""moulding"" it. Very weird to watch!
I got very confused at one point, as when Andrew is playing the piano with Little Miss, and she suddenly changes! I thought she was suddenly the mother. But they'd just sped forward about 15 years, without any warning. (They did the rest of the time, unless I was too blind to notice it.) I hated the way this film kept speeding forward through time.
I thought this film was three films rolled into one. The Green Mile (the whole immortality bit), The Terminator (I've just recently watched that and the bit where Andrew looks at his new family), and what was the other one? Of course, Mrs Doubtfire. Mainly because it's made by the same director, and it's just similar in little ways.
Sack the little girls, they were such bad actresses! The only thing the oldest one was good at was making a sulky face!

1091506,4,630587493X,"Bicentennial Man"" was advertised as a childrens' movie when it first came out in the theaters, but it is so much more than that. The movie tells about a robot, played by Robin Williams, and his quest (which takes over 200 years) to become human.
I knew the movie would be more than giggles and special effects.  The movie was, in my opinion, quite well done. What looks like a comedy at first ends up being a layered look at the human race. Robin Williams is surprisingly sedate and his romance between him and the daughter of his first love is touchingly sweet.
""Bicentennial Man"" is at both times uplifting and saddening. It is a great family movie, although some of the deeper meanings in the movie might be over the heads of younger children, they will still be entertained by the movie (and the token ""booger"" jokes thrown in for that purpose).

Well I like most passed on this movie during its theatrical release, I don't know why, I just did. Fast forward 6 months after it's release on DVD, I'm at the video store with a long night ahead and nothing left in stock (New releases) So I pick up this film for some mild entertainment.
Halfway through this movie I paused it and turned to my friend Michael (Another well read sci-fi fan) and I asked him
""Is it me or is this movie fantastic?"" We were both astonished by the emotional depth of the film. It is obvious why this was a theatrical bust; it was advertised as a comedy, which it most definitely not. Perhaps it is me, but this film really pressed at all of my buttons, granted as in any movie some scenes are stronger than others, but overall it ends up being an adult movie with a great story.

1091509,4,630587493X,"The Azimov-based Bicentennial Man (which came out earlier than A.I. and is less visually amazing - and was probably launched to compete with and pre-empt A.I., which took much longer to make), shares A.I.'s sappiness in parts, and is not as convincing in its effects or the acting of the central, robot character, yet somehow manages to tell almost the same story, in its most meaningful parts, much more effectively.  A.I. suffers from far too much ""wonder"" (heartstring-pulling fairy tale hooey plays really well in a movie like Edward Scissorhands, but just plain fails, dismally, in a non-comedy sci fi film that is intending to make a serious point.)  In the end, neither Bicentennial Man nor A.I. make any point we didn't already understand intuitively, yet somehow they both make you understand the nature of ""humanity"" and ""personhood"" a little better all the same, and both are worth at least one viewing.
PS: The odd thing about Bicentennial Man is that, although it is a ""dramedy"", with a lot of comedic elements (some of them clearly intended for the child audience - for which it was unfortunately exclusively marketed, with resulting box-office failure - with the overall theme of the film being much more mature), the humans, especially the central family, in Bicentennial Man are much more real-seeming and believable than those in A.I.

1091572,4,630587493X,"Similar to ""Artificial Intelligence,"" this movie is about the possibility of man creating a new form of life.  Robots are mass produced, which somewhat resemble humans, and are meant to serve some purpose.  In the case of Andrew, his purpose was to be a butler to a family.  It turned out that he became a member of the family, being treated more and more like a human than a machine as he evolved.  His owner realized that he had feelings and thoughts that none of the other robots had.  So he allowed the robot to read books and that began his journey.  He learned how to make crafts, and that's what he did in his spare time.  He eventually earned a very high income and his owner let him keep the money for himself, even opening a bank account for him.  He gets modifications done, first to allow his face to express the feelings he feels, and eventually getting a nervous system, artificial organs, skin, and a human face.  He desires freedom and his owner eventually gives him that- he builds his own house and supports himself.  He eventually falls in love with the decendant of his original owner's daughter (he lives to be 200 years old hence the title).  They want to get married but the law won't allow her to marry a ""robot.""  So he completes his evolution to the point where he is considered human by congress.  He pleaded before them saying that just because he has artificial organs does not disqualify him from being human because many humans have artificial organs that he himself invented.  It seems that the final requirement of congress for him to be considered human, and thus legally able to marry another human, is that his body age and eventually die.  So he ""acheives"" this.
I guess the movie was supposed to be inspiring how the robot wants so badly to become more and more human.  But basically he had all the attributes of humans only more-- he had greater intelligence, memory, and calculating abilities, he did not require sleep or food, he could never age or die, he was capable of self-maintenence, etc.  I could understand him wanting upgrades but not wanting to downgrade from posthuman to human.  He could have lived with her just the same only without being legally married.
In this movie, the robot is benign to humans.  However, if man did ever create artificial intelligence like this, a being that could think and feel on its own, it wouldn't necessarily be so nice to us.  And by its more advanced nature it could potentially break free from our control.  I think robots and machines should be advanced, but not given feelings.  They are supposed to be our servants, not our family.  We already know how to create people, but machines are supposed to serve us and if they were given feelings it would start to become unethical to make them work for us.  Also, if the robot could evolve towards being human, wouldn't it be likely then that humans could evolve towards being robotic?  They could keep the human attributes they want while taking on desirable robot features.  Imagine how much more fun and productivity we could get out of life by not requiring sleep.  Imagine how much faster we could learn if we could implant a computer chip into our brain.  Imagine being able to live through two centuries-- or longer.  If we ever decided we didn't want to live any longer, like the robot, we could end our existence at any time.
Like ""Artificial Intelligence,"" this movie attempts to bring about the issues that will face us in the future-- rapidly escalating technology, posthumanism, robots/ computers that could potentially become humans, etc.  However, I think both movies do a poor job of effectively presenting the issues.  They really only introduce the concepts and nothing more.  If you want to learn more, just do an internet search of ""transhumanism"" or ""posthumanism.""  I liked Bicentenial Man better than AI because its funny.  That robot really was cute and funny at times like in its reaction to when its owner explained sex to him, or how it gives people insults unknowingly, etc.",1022976000,2,4039,4.690340909090909
1091573,5,630587493X,"This film was sadly overlooked upon its release in 1999 (I was one who overlooked it).  The film needs to be seen: it is a true epic, spanning not only the 21st century, but ultimately moving into the 23rd!
The production works on many levels.  Robin Williams' robot character benefits from the technology (our present day technology) that has resulted in his manufacture -- and, ultimately, that careening technology enables him to become incrementally more human-like. Of course, the humans are simultaneously becoming incrementally more bionic, another result of the technology.
The screenplay is quite engaging.  Andrew (the android) immediately develops a fascinating relationship with his ""owner"", a character he calls ""Mister"", played quite well by Sam Neill.  Since Andrew is more or less immortal, as the decades move along in steady progression, he is later depicted as relating meaningfully with Mister's children, grandchildren --and great-grandchild. All the while, Andrew is incessantly learning, ""growing"", and evolving.  Indeed, the theme of evolution is central to the unfolding of the story.  We witness the evolution of society as well, in the background -- and what a fascinating vision it is.  Negativity and antagonism seem to be evaporating in this intriguingly depicted future life.
As a Northern Californian I was delighted to see what was done with San Francisco, for example.  Two hundred years from now the cable cars are completely unchanged. The Golden Gate Bridge is instantly recognizable, despite that fact that it now has an upper deck!  The world-famous Glide Memorial Cathedral is quite the same, though now surrounded by a neighborhood that is spectacularly futurized.  The film's special effects are magnificent and beyond criticism.
Few actors are sufficiently nimble to handle the role that seems completely natural for Robin Williams.  Great performance!

As a Christian, I find it offensive that anyone could really be taken in by the idea of man making a robot that is clearly supposed to be as human as a human.

1091575,2,630587493X,"Bicentennial Man is based on questions that have long been popular in science fiction. More recently, they has gained attention in science and philosophy. As man creates increasingly sophisticated machines, how far will we go in giving them intelligence? If we reach a point where we can make them rational, will they be able to rationalize? Will they ever develop feelings? If they can do these things, then what exactly will we call them? This movie tries to answer these questions in a gentle, sometimes humorous way. Unfortunately, it has a tendency to use the 'feel good' approach, and the results are disjointed. Many viewers will have a question of their own at the end. That question may be either ""Huh?"" or ""What?""
In the year 2005, a welathy man has a robot or android delivered to his lavish suburban home. The robot, which looks suspiciously like Robin Williams because he/it is played by Williams, is silver and manniquin-like. It is programmed to be the modern version of a servant or, considering it is a machine, a slave. It cooks, cleans, talks and responds to voice commands. The man's wife finds the android, quaintly named Andrew by one of the children, to be distracting. The youngest daughter adores it, at first treating it like a highly intelligent pet, later as a good friend. The elder daughter can't stand it. At one point, she orders it to jump out of a second story window, which causes quite a bit of damage to it. Considering how annoying and too cute it often is, she may have the right idea. It doesn't take Dad long to find out that Andrew has unexpected gifts. He is very artistic and seems to have feelings. The manufacturer insists that the robot is defective, but Dad refuses to trade Andrew in. Instead, he teaches the android many things about life, love and human beings. After several years, Andrew wants to be human. He also wants his freedom and sets off on a long journey around the world to try to find others like himself. When he returns, he has many more experiences. In fact, the movie covers a period of two hundred years.
I don't know what to say about Robin Williams at times. It's as though he is both the best and the worst of actors. Perhaps it's because of his demeanor or because he has such a dominant, recognizable personality. When I watch him in a serious dramatic scene, there is usually something in those dark, dancing eyes that suggests he's about to go into a series of wisecracks at any moment. I suppose I am suggesting that he stick with comedy, because it's impossible for me to take him seriously. Take this role. There may be things which are dark and compelling about a robot who yearns to be human and who almost gets there, but there is also a humorous side to this situation. In the comic scenes, Williams is great. Ultimately, though, this is a drama, and it's unfortunate that another actor wasn't cast in the role. Brad Pitt, Matt Damon and Johnny Depp come to mind.
Bicentennial Man spends nearly half its running time on Andrew's first few years with the family. That means the next 180 years are sketchy at best, and this weakens the film. The last half is more of a series of sketches than it is a linear story.",1016496000,8,3195,4.5874125874125875

1091692,5,630587493X,"Based on the Isaac Asimov short story ""The Bicentennial Man"" which was later adapted by Robert Silverberg in ""The Positronic Man,"" director Chris Columbus has managed to merge a powerful romantic epic with Asimov's intellectual story.
The story was written to celebrate the 1976 Bicentennial of the USA and Asimov's story told about a robot that strives to be human.  While this is a very prevalent idea nowadays, i.e. Data on Star Trek, it was pretty original at that time.
Columbus shows wonderful respect for the source material, which he betters in every way.  How often can you say that of a movie?  Columbus understands that in the future everything will not be immediately different.  The film portray this by slowly adding futuristic elements on top of real settings.  In an era of CGI sets that don't look real, this sci-fi movie is all the better for it's matter of fact approach to the future.
The performances are uniformly great with Williams giving such a strong performance beneath the costume that when his face is revealed it is a little startling.  He also injects a sense of humor that makes more powerful the romance and pathos of the plot.
This is a film that deserved better than it got.  It is an epic, in the sense of Tolstoy and ""Gone With the Wind"", with a science fiction worldview.

1091693,5,630587493X,"This movie is based upon a novelette of the same name by Isaac Asimov, later expanded to book length as The Positronic Man in collaboration with Robert Silverberg. As a story, it took both the Hugo and Nebula awards. As a movie, perhaps it should have taken at least a few of the Academy awards.
Andrew the robot is first introduced as a household handyman into the Martin family. Stiff, lacking in appreciation of idiomatic English or social graces, and to some extent feared and detested by some members of the family, he is the embodiment of the perfect machine butler. But even in the early stages of this film, intimations of its social and philosophical messages appear, even while you're laughing. The incident where one of the daughters orders Andrew to jump out the window is both hilarious and a pointed bite about the reaction of children to things they think threaten them. It is also a good illustration of the Three Laws of Robotics (which Asimov formulated as far back as 1939) in action, Laws which constrain Andrew in ways both obvious and subtle.
From this early point there is slow, carefully calculated development of Andrew from pure machine into something that has creative desires, that learns to care, and be cared about, for and by the family members, to a useful, money making employee, to a near person with a desire for freedom, and finally to a thinking, articulate, and lovable person whose greatest desire is to experience all it means to be human.
Robin Williams turns in a bravura performance here. Even in the early stages, when he is totally encased in his robot suit and incapable of showing any expression, he manages to make Andrew distinct and understandable. Later,  given more free rein, Williams irrepressible talent for the dead-pan one-liner comes to the fore, making devastating satirical points about money, freedom, love, death,  prejudice against any who 'look' different, and many other subjects. Science fiction is a very good vehicle for satire, and Williams makes the most of it here. While the supporting actors/actresses are very good, Williams clearly steals the show.
Makeup and special effects are well done, especially the various 'appearances' that Andrew takes on at various stages and the looks at his inner organs. The musical score, however, is only mediocre, though at least it doesn't get in the way of the film.
But more than anything else, this is a movie that explores just what it is to be human. Each stage of Andrew's development tries to capture one more aspect of being human, and his continuous striving towards that ultimate goal will eventually capture the viewer's heart.",1006387200,2,2648,4.921700223713646
1091694,4,630587493X,"First of all, I would like to say that I loved Isaac Asmiov's book, ""The Positronic Man"" from which the movie, ""The Bicentennial Man"" is based upon. Though both versions are different in ways, both are wonderful. Since this review is about the movie, I will make my review on ""The Bicentennial Man.""
Robin Williams stars as Andrew Martin, an android who is not the typical ""household appliance"". The Martin family soon realize this by seeing his extraordinary talent in carving, and that's only the beginning. Andrew is different because he thinks and feels. He has thoughts and ideas which everyone thinks robots are incapable of. The story tells about Andrew's 200-year journey for his purpose in achieving one thing, his one goal... humanity.
As I said already, this movie is different from Isaac Asimov's book, but this is also very entertaining. Robin Williams did an awsome job in his role, though some people don't think so. He was just so right to play the part of Andrew. Everyone else acting in ""The Bicentennial Man"" did a great job, too, especially Porschia.
A few things though I'll tell you what not to expect. ""Bicentennial Man"" is said to be for the family. Well, yes, but not for younger than teenager kids. The movie is very deep and some parts might not be appropriate for kids. They might not like it because they won't understand it that well. Also, it is said to be a comedy but actually, in my opinion, it is more like a drama. Yes, there are many funny and humorous places in it where I just laughed so hard! But it is not a comedy, it is a drama. Some parts my mother was crying, even I was feeling a little misty eyed. That's what I think is a good movie. A movie in which you can laugh and cry and feel with the characters in a movie. Watch ""Bicentennial Man"", I'm sure you'll enjoy it as much as I did!",998179200,6,1830,4.482035928143713

1091697,1,630587493X,"This is an interesting film, so this will take a while.  My brother's name is Andrew Martin Hunter.
This is a wonderful San Francisco movie.  The city does not overwhelm the story, but is a perfect nest for the action.  Good choice and good job!
Similarly, the effects enhance the film, and do not overwhelm and choke the story being told, which is why we are seeing this movie in the first place.  There are plenty of Mork and Mindy reruns if you want to see Williams preform!
ROBIN WILLIAMS:  I have a hard time seeing the character of Andrew through Robin Williams, sin Williams (call him ""W""?) is such a strong personality.  I have to ask myself if this movie could this film stand alone with out Robin Williams.  I think it could, it is just theat Williams has the name draw, along with Asimov, so they had him do it.  Robin Williams got in the way of the story, though not intentionally.  He is so strong and such a high-pressure personality that I don;t think he can help it.  Plus the several wise-cracks which are a shadow of the comedian Williams.
THEME:  This is a story of humanity by studying a contrast.  If this seems familiar, it is a leitmotif of Lt. Cmdr. Data on Star Trek: The Next Generation.  I watched the film to see if they did anything fresh or new.  They didn't . . . except for the suicide.  I think you could piece this film together from fragments of the TV series and First Contact.  Indeed, Star Trek has treated this theme so well, there is a book called ""The Metaphysics of Star Trek: Is Data Human?"" which covers this whole ground.  See episode 135 ""The Measure of A Man.""
I saw the film as having two conclusions about humanity.
CONCLUSION 1: Meaning of humanity is sex.  This is absolutely laughable.  Andrew Martin becomes a human, and has sex. ...  Egad!  So the point of humanity is sex.  Is heaven found at the red-light district, and is God's name ""Roxanne?""  Is Bill Clinton the most enlightened human on earth?  Why my grandmother was dying of Alzheimer's disease, my grandfather has a sexless life.  So was he missing something, or did he find something in nurturing my grandmother, feeding her, dressing and bathing her, and so forth?  The Bible says that God is love, not that God is sex!
CONCLUSION 2: Suicide is an option.  Aside from being just a change of scenery, suicide is the ultimate choice.  We can not unscramble that egg.  We talk about life being precious and full and rich, yet there are some people who do not see it as such.  We want to respect choices and we all feel pain, but we also have obligations to others and to society.  We are all needed somewhere,a nd suicide pulls us out of the pool of helping hands.

Physician assisted suicide is less about pain, and more about money.  If we stop caring about the dying, we will lose feeling about the living.
I wonder what Mr. Williams's opinion is about suicide.  He did a marvelous anti-suicide film, ""What Dreams May Come,"" yet he does this pro suicide film.  You can see why hypocrite was originally a theatrical term.
Well, this was not one of my favorite films.  I think star Trek did a better job with the themes.  Also, read Orson Scott Card's Ender's Game series, and watch Jane!",992044800,5,3366,4.472039473684211
1091698,3,630587493X,"Movie Summary:  The Martins buy a robot and name him Andrew. Andrew turns out to be very special. He strives over the course of 200 years to find out who he is. What he finds is that more than anything, he wants to be human.
My Opinion:  This was a really nice story. The problem I had was that it was a lot more fun when Andrew looked like a robot. Once he turned into Robin Williams, I couldn't buy him as a Robot anymore. He didn't walk, talk, or act like a robot anymore. Now maybe that was the point, but it didn't work for me.
DVD Quality:  Great picture and sound. Extras include trailer and making of documentary. It's anamorphic which is near and dear to the hearts of all 16:9 TV or monitor owners out there.
What You Should Do:  Rent it. I really can't see this one appealing to either SciFi fans or Robin Williams fans enough for them to buy it without seeing it first. It is a nice family movie. Nothing too offensive or vulgar.",990576000,3,941,4.18232044198895

The acting, the directing, the music, it goes on and on.  Not since The Last of the Mohicans have I seen a movie do this.  The movie itself did something that only the movie Brian's Song has made me do... Put me into tears.  If you do not cry at some point in this movie, you may just not have a heart.  You can thank the great acting by Robin Williams and relative unknown Embeth Davidtz and the music by James Horner for doing this to me.  I especially enjoyed Davidtz.  Why this was her first ""Big time"" movie I do not know.  Williams and Horner as usual performed to thier potential.  Another thing well done in this movie was the special effects.  It's a rarity today to see a movie with special effects that actually has a plot.  In the end, you must see this movie.

I was quite excited when I heard that a movie was being made of ""The Positronic Man"" by Issac Asimov, under it's earlier title of ""The Bicentennial Man"".  I am an Asimov fan, and that is maybe why I did not like this movie.
Then I heard that Robin Williams was the star, and I started to worry.  I admire some of his work, and am bored by some other parts of his work, but I did not think that he would be right for the role.  Great talent used in the wrong way, just as Tiger Woods will never be a quarterback for the Steelers.
So it was with mixed emotions that I watched.  I was hoping for the best, but prepared for the worst.
Perhaps I should not have read the book, because then I would not have been so disappointed by the result.  It seemed to me like a desecration of a great work.  Gone was the sentimentalism, replaced by humor of Robin William's style, a style that was not suited to the role.  I knew Andrew Martin, I read Asimov's version of Andrew Martin, and sir, you are no Andrew Martin.

I made it about 1.5 hours through and realized that you were basically watching the same story being repeated over several generations in the same family.  The whole ""freedom"" and ""declaration of humanity"" themes just didn't save it.  It's very difficult to portray the life of a single character spanning 200 years, and ""Bicentennial Man"" didn't pull it off.
The biggest problem is that the life of ""Andrew"" is portrayed so quickly, moving through time like the years are broken blades of grass, it's impossible to make a connection with the character.  Once you think you may be connecting with him and feeling what he feels, BAM, the movie just skipped 16 years, and you're left with, ""Hey, wait a minute, I was just getting into that period.""

1091823,5,630587493X,"I have just seen Bicentennial Man (on cable) for the second time.  I loved it even more than my first time seeing it in the theater, because I knew the story in advance and could relax and look forward to it, without being overwhelmed by the wonderful special effects and little tidbits of wonderment that pervade the movie.  Quite simply, Robin Williams portrays a robot who becomes human.  But, it's so much deeper than that.  I must say it is one of Robin's best works... and I've seen them all.  It has his delightful comedy, but moreover, his perfect portrayal with pathos and beguiling charm.  The movie begins with the robot (dubbed Andrew) being introduced to the family (with Sam Neill as the father).  One of the little girls in the family makes a quick connection with the new robot (Williams), and they become fast friends... for life, as it turns out.  As time goes by, Andrew (Williams) becomes more and more a member of the family.  But, Andrew also becomes more human, and eventually goes to search for his identity, and to seek out others like him.  The film moves rather quickly from one time period to another, since they have to cover Andrew's lifespan of two-hundred years (hence the title).  Throughout his life, he is constantly evolving, whether mechanically, thru technological improvements, or just by learning human qualities.  The thrust of it is that he eventually becomes human, but is not recognized as such until the end of his life. (There is a very moving speech he gives to some delegation who will decide if he is human or not.)  It is a landmark film of human emotions and human joy, all experienced and displayed by a robot.  It is not the comic fluff of some earlier Williams' films, nor the hardhitting drama of some of his others.  Rather, it is the compelling joyousness and heartwarming comedy of a machine who wants to be human... played expertly by Williams, of course.  I plan to watch it again, very soon.  It is a great movie.",977011200,59,1974,4.658959537572255
1091824,2,630587493X,"Bicentennial Man is one of those movies that makes you wish you had directed it so you could correct all those flaws that butcher an otherwise great film: starring Robin Williams as Andrew - the  robot who was first the household servant, then the wayward traveler - Bicentennial Man could have been the most powerful and inspirational movie of the year, but second-rate acting, a colossal plot-hole, and a horrific script quite effectively shot the film out of the sky.
To start off with the positive side of things, I feel the movie had much to offer visually.  It was filmed with a fair degree of care and talent, and such moments as Andrew's examination of the spider web and his construction of the toy horse for Little Miss had a distinct emotional impact.  Also, the set and makeup design deserve serious congratulation, as they inevitably entailed numerous expenses and had the fortunate effect of producing an equally exorbitant result.
Another aspect I admired was that the makers of Bicentennial Man were notthe type to clip short an important story at the gain of making their product ""market length"".
Unfortunately, the happy story ends there.
One of the main problems with it was that it starred Robin Williams.  Now, don't get me wrong!  I consider Robin Williams to be one of the better actors Hollywood has known, (Dead Poets Society and Mrs. Doubtfire are among my favorite films) but sadly, his performances have been reduced to a formula.  There are only so many characters and personalities that an actor can portray before his portrayal becomes redundant, and after a quarter of a century of movies, Williams has reached that stage.  Consequently, Bicentennial Man lost any spark of uniqueness it might have had, because its lead actor, the anchor of the viewer's emotional connection to the movie, looked bored.  This in and of itself was enough to do in the film, although a good performance by Sam Neil somewhat made up for this tragic flaw.
Another major problem was a titanic plot hole that I still can't understand how the creators missed.  When Andrew first enters the Martin household, he outlines Asimov's notorious Three Laws of Robotics, and makes note of their hierarchy.  The fact that these laws were never again mentioned in the movie was alone a significant problem, but the degree to which they were forgotten is unforgivable.  To avoid spoiling the ending, I'll limit my explanation to this: when you're watching the final scene, remember the First Law of Robotics, as well as the fact that it supersedes the Second Law, and then you'll understand the enormity of the error.  Finally, and most terminally, the script was possibly the worst ever presented in a large-budget film - yes, even worse than Titanic's.  The lines were not only entirely contrived and unbelievable, but their quality made me wonder if they were written by kindergartners.  Examples?  Mrs. Martin, when confronting a boyfriend of her rebellious daughter, yells at the antagonist, ""You big ball of slime!""  Andrew accidentally breaks a highly regarded toy, to which that same daughter declares, ""You're screwed.""  Throughout the movie, Andrew is fond of making comments that express his literal understanding of the world, an attribute classic to robots which may have been funny in movies released in the 50s but now is nauseatingly worn-out.
At the film's most torturous moment,  Andrew is faced with a beautiful robot. She asks him if he can experience emotions, and he responds, ""No.""  She then flips her hand and says, ""Well, sucks to be you!""  I'm not kidding.  It's in there.
Collectively, these flaws immensely outweighed any strong points the movie might have had, making it fundamentally lousy, but lousy in the worst possible way, because unlike movies that are entirely bad, you can't stop thinking about Bicentennial Man: the few crying positive sides keep coming back to you until you are driven crazy with your futile wish to make the movie better.  The concept was present, as was the heart, but the class dramatically missed the mark and so Bicentennial Man plunges into oblivion.",977011200,8,4110,4.9693430656934305

I am so used to science fiction being aimed at a juvenile  or young adult audience I was somewhat wary about purchasing it.  However  my fears were totally unfounded.  ""Bicentennial Man"" is a great  film despite the panning it got from the critics.  Robin Williams is great  as the robot Andrew bought in the year 2005 by a wealthy all American  Family as a ""household appliance"".  The story follows his  relationship with the family over the years, especially Little Miss, the  youngest member of the Martin family.  Andrew is a robot with a quirk.  He  has the ability to feel emotions, and because of this has the ability to  expand beyond his original programming.  Not everyone is pleased about  Andrew's abilities especially the Robotics Company that created him but  with the aid of Sir Martin played excellently by Sam Neill Andrew becomes  an individual.  Throughout all of this Little Miss is there, and robot and  child forge a strong bond, so strong in fact that Little Miss actually  falls in love with him when she grows up unbeknown to Andrew.  We follow  Andrew through many learning experiences, with the grown up Little Miss at  his side he acquires a bank account for all the money he earns, and then  through his desire to be free, not owned by anyone, to the day he leaves to  try and find his own kind in the world.  Throughout the film Andrew has one  desire, to be human, first through his ability to feel, then to show them  through facial expressions, then with the help of Rupert Burns, played to  perfection by Oliver Platt, a human appearance that will make him human  looking.  The film moves slowly, Robin Williams gives a convincing  performance as the robot who wants humanity with all its trappings.  From  external to internal, he sets about achieving his goal, aided by Rupert and  then the granddaughter of Little Miss, Portia who he falls in love with and  who eventually becomes his partner.  The film shows the prejudices that  Andrew encounters, even within the Martin family; Portia's father hates him  as did, the original Little Miss' older sister.  This is not an action  packed science fiction film, rather it is thought provoking, deliciously  funny in parts, just watch Williams with the female robot Galatea played  wonderfully by Kiersten Warren (watch this girl she's going places!) and  you will know what I mean.  The ending is poignant and moving, especially  because you know that Andrew could have lived forever but choose mortality  because he did not want to live without his human consort Portia.  There is  a wonderful little twist at the end which left me smiling, so all in all  this is a wonderful film, aimed I think mainly at an adult audience but the  more mature teenager will probably appreciate it, so go out and borrow or  buy it, it's well worth it.",967593600,2,2912,4.693227091633466

This is not a movie that was necessarily best viewed on  the big screen; it is quite effective on the small screen as well. It's a  great look at what it really means to be human, and to love; not too  dissimilar to what Data aspires for in Star Trek: The Next Generation.

1091940,3,630587493X,"Owing to the fact that it is based on an Isaac Asimov story, `Bicentennial Man' turns out to be a more interesting and meaningful film than both its  advertising campaign and its own opening section would indicate. The caveat  for those seeking out a fun film for the entire family is that this movie,  though initially sold as a warm cuddly comedy in the tradition of say `Mrs.  Doubtfire,' actually deals with some very heavy and heady issues like  sexuality, aging and dying, which may make it less-than-ideal viewing for  young children.
The first section of the film is, by far, its weakest. In  2005, the wealthy Martin family receives delivery of a brand new servant  android (Robin Williams) who, almost immediately, begins to display a  remarkable range of human emotions and interests. Thus, we are set up for  yet another in a long line of predictable tales (i.e. `Harry and the  Hendersons,' `Stuart Little') in which a family comes to adopt a strange,  not-quite-human creature, welcoming him in as one of their own. Indeed, in  the film's early stages, there is no shortage of either bland humor or  drippy sentimentality as Andrew, the android, ingratiates himself with all  but one of the Martin household. The `wit' in the film consists, basically,  of endless jokes about how Andrew takes all idioms at literal face value, a  running gag that is, finally, as unoriginal as it is wearying.
Then,  however, just as we are about to give up hope in it, the movie becomes more  intriguing. Rather than staying within the context of the present life of  this one family, the screenplay begins to move ahead in time, exploring  Andrew's gradual growth toward total humanity, while the initial family  grows up and eventually dies off. Actually, despite how one may feel about  the film itself, one must admire its boldness and audacity, for it is not  often that, in a film billed as a mass audience comedy, all the main  characters pass on to their heavenly reward at one point or another - but,  then again, how many comedies span a two hundred year time period?  `Bicentennial Man' obviously has more on its mind than mere  fish-out-of-water buffoonery, as it becomes an often-elegiac reflection on  the transience of life, the meaning of being human and the search for  societal acceptance. The mood of the film is remarkably hushed and  reflective at times, which again might make it slow going for the modern  mass audience more conditioned to a faster pace and giddier tone,  especially in a Robin Williams film (though, of late, his films have  certainly been taking on a much more somber quality, vide `What Dreams may  Come,' `Patch Adams' and `Jakob the Liar'). There are times when  `Bicentennial Man' seems overly impressed with its own self-importance, yet  one appreciates its refusal to settle for the easy path of cheap comedy and  upbeat sentiments. There is, indeed, a real sadness to much of the  film.
Special acknowledgement should be made of the superb art direction,  set design, costume design, makeup and special effects that together give  the film its understated and believable futuristic look. In addition, James  Horner's melancholic symphonic score, though a bit lubricious at times,  does create an atmosphere of contemplative seriousness that perfectly  matches the tone and purpose of the film.
`Bicentennial Man' may not turn  out to be what you are looking for when you first seek it out, but, if you  approach it with an open mind and a certain degree of tolerance and  indulgence, you may be pleasantly surprised and, perhaps, even rewarded.",964310400,28,3591,4.918196994991653

1092030,5,630587493X,"At first, I wasn't looking forward to this movie, but thankfully all my expectations were exceeded in a big way.  This movie is first and foremost a touching Science Fiction Story.  This movie has many touching human  emotions, situations, and characters that we can relate to.  The main  character, goes on an epic and long journey (200 years) to find out who he  is and what his place is in the world.  He meets many people and  edventually finds love, he also has to cope with loosing loved ones.  Most  people can relate to this, which makes it such a good story.  Ironically,  the robot acts more human than some of the humans in the story.  This movie  also deals with subjects like immortality, and all the losses and changes  one would have to go through if he or she was immortal.  For a PG movie,  this has some pretty deep views.  It comes off as a kids movie, but it is  more for older kids and adults because it is quite long.  Anybody who  enjoys a touching story, or good science fiction should enjoy this well  made film.
The DVD features a trailer, and a featurette consisting of the  actors and crew saying good things about each other.  In other words, it's  a great movie on a bad DVD.  Still, Highly Reccomended.",963360000,5,1233,4.417040358744394

1092032,5,630587493X,"The first thing that struck me about this film was the fact that it wasn't funny. Sure it had its moments like other dramas, but being billed as a comedy, this was surprising. The second is that most children watching this  film will be bored and confused with the subject matter. Although it is a  clean family movie, the topics covered (i.e. euthanasia, discrimination,  immortality, etc.) are most definitely adult.
I am glad it wasn't a  simple comedy, as within I found a touching, human story about a robot's  search for meaning and humanity. It is a remarkable film, with great acting  by both Robin Williams and Sam Neil. This was combined with a great score  and wonderful visuals. It truly is a great film.
In conclusion, if you're  looking for the comedy from the trailer look elsewhere. If you're looking  for a family movie which your younger kids can get into, look elsewhere.  This is a thought provoking and touching drama which contemplates very  complex issues in a highly entertaining manner. I loved this film and  highly recommend it.",962496000,182,1055,4.8

The movie was brilliant.  The scenery,  the acting, and the story (which spans through 200 years), was very  inspiring.  Robin Williams did a great job in this movie.  The character  development and the makeup was brilliant also.  They really showed the  aging of all the characters very well.  Please, watch this movie!

Even though Robin Williams plays an android, I can really feel a lot of Empathy for his character.  This is probably the best tear-jerker  movie ever made.  It takes you away from the humdrum of regular movies and  into a world where slavery and equal rights are being fought by a new  species of mankind (robotic).  I think Robin Williams deserves an Oscar for  this stellar performance.  What this DVD lacks in extras', is totally made  up by superior acting and enjoyment value.  This is by far my all time  favorite DVD.",961891200,,611,4.405405405405405
1092036,3,630587493X,"I found the robot central character intriguing.  Williams was excellent as one who lives by the rules but yearns to be break free.  However, this was a soap-opera treatment of the story:  heavy-handed music and  too-many-characters who became two-dimensional cutouts.  I felt that the  director was trying to force my feelings, rather than simply telling the  story well and letting it carry the mood.
If you like a little Asimov  with your General Hospital (or a little GH with your Asimov), give it a  try.
If you want a more serious science fiction take on what it means to  be human, try Blade Runner.

Some of the visuals were just  great, particularly the ones of the distant future. I thought a lot of the  talent in the movie was miss used. Robin Williams doesn't really seem like  a robot to me, I think someone would have been better off playing that  role. Also, on the DVD there really weren't any note worthy extras, just a  trailer and a five minute promotional snipet. Common, this is dvd, we want  more.",961891200,,528,4.326530612244898
1092038,4,630587493X,"Chris Columbus and Robin Williams have together taken one of my all-time favorite sci-fi short stories, and the more extended novel and created a wonderful movie, which has a bit of everything in it.
While this movie is  entertaining, it is not great cinema, like Gone With the Wind, but it  certainly rises well above the usual low level of movies that Hollywood  seems to have spawned over the last few years.
Robin Williams' comedic  talents are well-used in a light way in the early part of the movie, as  Andrew Martin (Williams) slowly begins to develop and adapt himself.  In  addition, Williams' abilities as a serious actor are vastly under-rated,  with the death scenes in particular showing the serious determination on  the part of Andrew Martin to prevent the deaths of the people he  loves.
This movie has comedy, pathos, love, death, in all, most things  which make for a good movie.  In places, I would recommend a box of paper  tissues be handily placed.
A good movie for all the family, though I  would recommend it more for older children as well as the big  kids....
The only real gripe I have with the movie was that the  transition between layers on the DVD was very obvious.  Technically 7/10.  Movie overall, 9/10",961718400,3,1237,4.700934579439252
1092144,2,630587493X,"I was very disappointed and disturbed by this film. It wasn't my choice, but as a fan of Robin Williams, I decided I would give it a chance. The first 45 minutes of the film is good.  The Martin's get the new  ""Robot"" who the Pepsi girl accidently names Andrew.  Andrew is a  unique, one of a kind robot who deep down really wants to be human and  mortal. Immortaliy stinks for him. The film moves through different periods  of the families' life, and brings us to almost 200 years later, and Andrew  is still trying to become more human.  he even falls in love with a human,  and she, although she knows it could never really work, falls in love with  him too.  well, she never really declares her love.  but they spend time  together, and this is where the film starts to disturb me, a machine and a  woman are just happily in love?  and people are watching this with their  children?  i would never watch this with children, or recommend it to  families.  This is just a strange story, with some real philosophical  questions being asked. I really wouldn't call this movie Science Fiction.  It's kind of a comedy in the beginning, and then it just turns to mush.  The acting couldn't even save this movie.  Robin Williams is the only star  in this waste of film. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone.",961545600,3,1308,4.421940928270042

Then, a few days after it was released, I was talked into it by a friend and though ""well, it  won't be TOO bad. Robin Williams is always funny"".  By the end of  this movie I was sobbing uncontrollably, uncaring of the packed theater  aroud me, unaware of anything else. And I'm a 18 year-old male who claims  FIGHT CLUB is his favorite movie! Overall, 3 scenes stand out in my mind as  making me sob like I did; The death of Sam Neil's character, the death of  'Little Miss', and finally the scene with Williams and his wife on their  death bed (which was the one during which I was sobbing uncontrollably).  This film was so incrediably moving that I still, even months and months  after it's release, am in awe of it. I really connected with William's  charater, I felt his burning desire to become human, to fit in, to  experience life and even death.  The acting was flawless in every  aspect, the music stirring and lyrical, the special effects, that while in  service to the story, were still breathtaking, the scope of the story being  told suprising. And all of it done without horrid language or violence.  See this movie. Ths is a mature Chris Columbus film, not the kiddie flick  depicted in the trailers.

During the film, you watch as his masters grow  old and he lives on; on a quest to find out why he is so different.  The  only thing I find negative about this wonderful family film is the fact  that it is so depressing!  You watch as this robot lives on and his dearest  friends and sort-of-family die.  It has a mixed ending, which is both sad  and happy depending on the way you look at it.

Slowly, trying to evolve into a human being, wanting all the feelings  and willing to except all the frailties. Make's one thankful for life and  appreciative of the wonderful things we take for granted every day. Our  families, friends, senses, feelings, the list is endless.

1092148,4,630587493X,"`Bicentennial Man' is a Sci-Fi comedy that turns into a Sci-Fi romance and then shoots for deep philosophical drama on death and dying.  It overreaches its capabilities and can't pull it all together.  It seems that  the more human Andrew became, the worse the film got.
This is based on  Isaac Asimov's short story about a robot named Andrew (Robin Williams)  whose flawed programming makes him obsessed with becoming human.  It shows  his relationship with four generations of the Martin family and his various  upgrades toward humanhood.  The first part of the film is engaging and  droll.  Williams is at his best when he is doing offbeat comedy, and this  segment had a warm kind of comedy that was enchanting.
By the time the  film progressed to the romance between Andrew and Portia, it had used up  its charm.  It became contrived and implausible.  Williams is beyond his  talents as a romantic lead and all the romantic scenes were forced and  awkward.  As the film moved towards the ending, Andrew wasn't the only  thing getting moribund.  The entire film began to decay.
Director Chris  Columbus did some excellent work in the area of makeup.  The robot costumes  and the aging makeup was wonderfully done.  Unfortunately, much was lacking  in the costumes and sets as the decades went by.  As time passed, nothing  seemed to change as regards dress and sets.  We are led to believe that 200  years hence, everything will look pretty much the way it looks today.  Think of the difference between dress in 1800 and today.  Shouldn't we  expect changes of similar magnitude over the next 200 years?  Apparently  not in Columbus' mind.  The only indications that it wasn't the 20th  century were a couple of futuristic blue screen city backdrops and that's  about it.  Very unimaginative.
Sam Neill was marvelous as the Martin  patriarch.  He gave the father wisdom, character and a strong guiding hand.  Embeth Davidtz was lovely but a little tentative at times as Portia.  She  was stronger as Little Miss, which required more warmth than dynamism.  Williams was very good at the start, but as the water got deeper, he  floundered.  He needs to stay with wacky comedy roles and stop pretending  he is a dramatic/romantic lead.  Oliver Platt was great fun as the eccentic  inventor who develops Andrew's upgrades.
There was a lot to enjoy about  this film. It was delightfully warm and schmaltzy even though it did  outlive its allure by the end. If you are the sentimental type, you will  probably enjoy it. If you are expecting side splitting comedy or good  Sci-Fi, forget it. I rate it a 7/10.",961113600,3,2606,4.802272727272728

As a robot evolves to ""more than the sum of its parts"", he discovers the magic that defines us individuals and spritual beings. He  longs to feel as we do (or as some of us should) and goes on a journey that  will permit him to do so. There are some similarities present, in this  movie, that have been seen in other stories in regards to robots and  adroids. Asimov's laws of robotics for instance. All in all it is very well  done. I would recommend this for 15 years of age or older. Only because I  doubt the script would hold the attention of too many people younger than  that.",961027200,4,658,4.174603174603175

It was a tale which gave life to my belief that even though we may be downtrodden, subjected to others direction in our lives and our lack of it, there is hope.  The movie  does the story justice beyond what most would.  It shows that we can,  someday through hard work and perserverance, become that which we so strive  to be.  Human. It shows, also, that being human is less a matter of what we  look like than how we feel, and who we are.

1092153,5,630587493X,"For years I have been a great fan of Issac Asmov.  Without a doubt, Bicentennial Man was my favorite of his stories because, although most of Asmov's robot novels have a more intellectual ending, this one had more  real depth and feeling than anything I have ever read from him.  The  movie expands on this in a profound way and extends Asmov's novelette into  a full feature in a way I have seen few books rendered to film.  Although I have seen some bad press on this movie, (notably Robert Ebert)  DON'T believe it, my fiancee loved it so much she had to see her favorite  parts again after it was over, and she is NOT a science fiction fan (of a  fan of Asmov for that matter.)  I have also heard that the humor was also  rather dry, and I don't believe that this is true either.  Although Robin  Williams was not the zany character he usually is, many of his jokes were  extremely funny.  (Ex. A buddhist walks up to a hotdog vender and says,  ""make me one with everything."") I believe that the more subdued  tone he played worked with the tone of the character.  His usual antics  would have looked inappropiate for a robot who was not supposed to have a  personality at all.  Over time, his character does learn to be more  expressive, but never to the extreme extent of Williams in other movies  (Ex. The Fisher King.), however, my fiancee said that William's concept of  phyisical and emotional love was one of the most romantic things she had  ever heard.  Other comments aside, I believe this is one of the best films  I have seen in months, and I would HIGHLY recommend it.  The DVD is  well done with an excellent transfer, good Dolby Digital effects, and it  DOES have a trailer and movie featurette.
