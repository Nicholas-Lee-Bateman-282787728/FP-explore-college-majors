8462501,5,B0058YPPBC,"My title just about says it all. Great stories, great effects, strong cast, and a unique set of characters. There are numerous elements reminiscent of classic X-Men storylines, but the show feels fresh and the ideas are well developed, and I enjoy the fact that there are no uniforms. Ryan Cartwright, as Gary Bell, is a genius, and I have a brain-melting crush on Azita Ghanizada. As far as I'm concerned, there's a fair argument to be made about her being Afghanistan's greatest export. (And, yes, I realize she was raised in the United states.)

Can't wait for Season 2 on DVD, and I hope this series has a good, long run!",1350691200,2,625,4.580357142857143
8462502,5,B0058YPPBC,"I haven't watched the entire first season yet but I'm aleady won over on this one.

Personally I get rather bored with the superhero theme (except for Superman)and have found many of the TV series such as Heroes, Mutant X etc rather ho hum.

Alphas is different and the closest series I could compare it to would be X-Files. Yes, the characters have exceptional abilities, but all of the characters are flawed and very human with their own 'personal demons' and insecurities. the producers have gone out of their way to develop very believable characters and to develop almost believable reasons for their particular skills, each of which has a down side. The leader, who isn't an 'alpha', is a rather naive father figure type character, who struggles to keep the group together, as they search, on behalf of questionable Government authorities, for other alphas misusing their abilities. The repartee between the various characters is chaotic and again believable.

The principal nemesis is an apparently very vulnerable autistic character, yet she leads the RedFlag group of alphas with an unfriendly, though quite understandable agenda. The complexity of the characters has you realising that, other than the ubiquitous shadowy Government agency watching over our heroes, there are no seriously evil types, only people with conflicting agendas, a little like the two X-Men groups.

This is serious at times scary SciFi fodder, with complex characters who grow on you, and who you increasingly come to like, despite their at times weird behaviour and conflict within the group. And yet they remain rigidly loyal to each other.

The only series being screened at present and presently in production, that matches it, would be Fringe. Alphas and Fringe in my mind are the two best present SciFi shows on TV",1333843200,7,1806,5.087837837837838
8462503,4,B0058YPPBC,"There seem to have been a lot of movies and TV shows in recent years that try to depict more ""realistic"" superhero stories. You know, less spandex and magical powers, more ""regular"" people.

The latest example is ""Alphas,"" a TV series that focuses on otherwise ordinary people with strange evolutionary quirks like supersenses, influencing minds and ""seeing"" electronic signals. It's one of those series that is solid and fun, but it feels like it hasn't fully grown into itself just yet -- but the last episode does imply that big things are coming.

The CIA is stumped when a key witness is shot... in an empty room with no windows. The case is handed over to Dr. Rosen (David Strathairn), a scientist who has a special team of ""Alphas"" -- and they soon determine that the shooter is also an Alpha, Cameron Hicks (Warren Christie), who is being controlled by someone else.

Among the problems the team encounters are: a kid with rage pheromones, a bunch of mystery deaths at a high school, a kidnapped heiress who can only be found with Gary's abilities, a woman who can MacGuyver almost any device from scraps, a cult leader who is slowly destroying his followers, a shape-shifter, and an invisible menace who is stalking a prisoner.

But the biggest problem comes not from Alphas, but from regular humans. A terrorist cell known as Red Flag reveals that our dear government is trying to surreptitiously stamp out or imprison all Alphas, and the tenuous relationship between Dr. Rosen's group and the government becomes more fragile with time. If they can't stop it, war will be the next step.

""Alphas Season 1"" follows the basic X-Men formula -- an idealistic father-figure/mentor who oversees the young  superpowered people, in a world that fears and hates them blah blah blah. It doesn't stray too far from that formula, but it does seem to be trying to have more ""realistic"" abilities (flight or fight, for example) instead of assigning magical superpowers.

Most of the first season is made up of standalone episodes -- each one has a solid mix of comedy (Gary trying to divide his burrito), acrobatic action scenes, and some intriguing moral questions about terrorism and interference in evolution. But the series doesn't REALLY take off until the last episode of the season, which is not only intense and heartbreaking, but it radically changes the way the Alphas live in this world. That episode is what boots this season from ""okay"" to ""good.""

It has a pretty solid cast too -- David Strathairn does a particular good job as a kindly man who genuinely wants normal humans and Alphas to live in peace, but whose idealism is slowly dwindling. Azita Ghanizada is great as a girl who is incapable of having a normal life because of her abilities, and is hurt by her family's view of her. Laura Mennell, Christie and Malik Yoba are pretty good as well.

And Ryan Cartwright is EXCELLENT as high-functioning autistic kid Gary. Not only does he do an excellent job depiction autism, but he shows us Gary's determination to make his own choices and have his own friends (including a Red Flag girl).

""Alphas Season 1"" is merely good most of the time, but it really, really blossoms when it focuses on Red Flag and the impending Alpha/human war. Here's waiting for season two.",1331596800,5,3281,4.791150442477876
