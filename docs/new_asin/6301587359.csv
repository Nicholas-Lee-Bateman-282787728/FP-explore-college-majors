Well, I most certainly can not but I thought that the idea was interesting. The movie is a loose adaptation of great Alberto Moravia's novel (notable adaptations of his novels include Vittorio De Sica's ""Two Women"" (1960), based on ""La Ciociara"", Jean-Luc Godard's"" Contempt: (1963), from ""Il Disprezzo"", and Bernardo Bertolucci's ""The Conformist"" (1970), from the book of the same name) and I thought that it was funny.

The movie won a Golden Screen award in 1988 - which is presented to the distributors of domestic and foreign feature films - including documentary and children films - with more than 3,000,000 admissions within 18 months since their release or re-release in Germany. ""Me and Him"" won the award along with ""A Fish Called Wanda"", (1988), ""Rain Man"" (1988), and ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" (1988).

But if you're looking for a great Italian slapstick comedy, I recommend ""Johnny Stecchino,"" directed by Roberto Benigni.",982195200,2,401,5.03030303030303
