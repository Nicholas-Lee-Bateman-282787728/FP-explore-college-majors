4960625,5,B0065IYS3G,"We had to buy the DVD set before we left our Australian holiday. It has all of the ingredients perfect for my pre-teen, dealing with a range of issues like first crushes, jealousy, striving for your dreams and rejection. It's refreshingly honest and heartwarming with real characters and situations that my daughter (and I!) can identify with. Set against the gorgeous backdrop of Sydney without the annoying 'ocker' stereotypes, this TV drama will make you laugh and cry in turn as you watch it again and again.",1332547200,,512,4.896551724137931
4960626,5,B0065IYS3G,"I found this show on Netflix, looking for a dance movie, wow, I LOVE this series.  Why can't America make a kid friendly dance show like this.  Here is the information to write the Producer of this show.  We need to show them we are interested, at the very least, make the DVDs in our format.  [...]",1332374400,,299,4.192982456140351
4960627,5,B0065IYS3G,"I watched the first season on Netflix and I can't wait for the 2nd season to come out. I grew up dancing and I also grew up partially in Sydney, so there is just more reason for me to love this show. Beautiful Sydney setting and the cute story line about a sweet country girl, Tara, who came to the big city to be a dancer. As always like in any TV show, there is a villain, Abigail, Tara's roommate, without whom life would be just too easy. The dancers may not be the best in the world, nor they are the typical skinny ballet dancer body types, but they are gorgeous anyway when they dance. Jordan Rodrigues who plays Christian is so very cute, if I were younger I would have a crush on him. Like what the other reviewer said, I also watch this show over and over again!",1328918400,3,772,4.119205298013245
4960628,5,B0065IYS3G,"Really? No USA version.

Caught this on Netflix and I couldn't stop watching it, over and over again!  Came here to add it to my permanent collection and just couldn't believe it wasn't available.  (They started airing a season two in Australia) Perhaps when enough people see it on Netflix the word will spread and we'll get both seasons on a DVD in US format.  If you like dance, check it out.

4960631,4,B0065IYS3G,"OK, let's be real. This is a teen dance (insert acting, music, any arts) academy series. It covers the conflicts, crushes, cynicism, and other teenage challenges of high school, but set in a ballet academy in Australia. There is really no way this would earn 4 stars compared to award winning series with real world adult challenges (say West Wing or Sopranos). But for a teen-based, art-based series, I found this to be quite enjoyable. OK, admittedly, for years I studied ballet, so I'm sure that's part of what I enjoy about it. But if I had young or pre-teens at home, and wanted to find something healthy, that we could watch together, this would be one of my selections.",1426636800,,676,4.641666666666667

4960636,5,B0065IYS3G,Great show for pre-teens and teens who are dancers and who would understand the ins and outs of the dance community.

4960644,4,B0065IYS3G,"Keeping in mind that this show is targeting teenagers and some of its acting is not that great it is made with a lot of thought and brings up important topics.

4960665,5,B0065IYS3G,"Terrific Series.  Just finished watching ""Glee"" -- hadn't seen it on TV when it aired.  And I was kind of missing watching the kids and  all that wonderful music, so thought I'd try watching ""Dance Academy"" which I'd never heard of.  Absolutely loved it.  It's about a group of young people who win admittance to their country's (Australia) national ballet academy.  Even if you think you don't like ballet you'll love watching these kids evolve over several semesters at the Academy.  The series doesn't shy away from serious issues kids face today, but overall it's a delight to see how well these kids handle the angst of growing up in the glare of the spotlight created by their choices.  Thoroughly enjoyed this series in every way.",1405900800,,737,4.7936507936507935

4960671,5,B0065IYS3G,"Absolutely one of the best tv series I've ever seen for both young teens and up to and including adults of any age. I'm 68 years old and never watch kids shows unless I have to but I tried the first episode just because of the dancing (and I didn't know it was a kids show) and I was hooked. It's original, surprising, excellent acting by a bunch of unknown Australian actors. Really no cliches here. All characters are multi-layered with good and bad traits. You'll end up loving all of them.

I can't recommend this enough for parents and their kids.",1404259200,2,552,4.411764705882353

4960673,5,B0065IYS3G,"Bored one day I decided to watch Dance Academy on Amazon Prime.  Filmed in Australia, there are some beautiful scenes.  The storyline is typical of any Dance School/Academy but after being invested in the characters lives, I felt like I knew them personally.  I watched season one, two and three in its entirety in two days.  I laughed, I cried, I prayed, and felt  a every emotion possible during this series.  I finished two days ago and find myself lost and longing for more.  I understand that it would be highly unlikely to continue on to a season 4 as the kids grow up in front of your eyes and go in their own direction.  I highly recommend this series and will probably watch it again.  I have searched for other series such as this, but have found none.  It is like watching the kids of Glee grow up.  Please watch this!  The dancing is beautiful!",1403740800,2,856,4.416666666666667

4960675,4,B0065IYS3G,"I really enjoyed it.  Binge watched it and now I am sorry that there is no season 4.  It is aimed at teens and deals with some pretty mature issues, but they are handled very well and I would recommend to anyone",1403222400,,211,4.0

4960680,5,B0065IYS3G,It's addicting to watch. It's like a series of after-school specials. It doesn't tackle any ground-breaking issues and is very teen-friendly.,1402012800,,141,5.761904761904762
4960681,5,B0065IYS3G,Thought this was a show my daughter would enjoy.  Turning into a show I'll finish without her.  Wish we made shows like this in the states.,1401840000,,139,4.3076923076923075

4960683,5,B0065IYS3G,"This series was such a refreshing look at teens vying to be the best dancers in Australia. I loved that the kids were not overly made-up; their fresh natural faces shown through. There was no preachy agenda about ""tolerance"", the characters conveyed what could have been a very realistic glimpse into the struggles that highly driven artists/athletes face as teens. Performances in acting and dance were stellar and very, very believable. The only shame was that it was necessarily restricted to 3 seasons. I would love to see the characters later on in their lives. I love how they dealt w/real problems of relationships without throwing a constant barrage of sexually charged nonsense in your face the way our US shows do. Kudos to Oz and this program!.",1401494400,,755,4.90625

4960687,5,B0065IYS3G,"I like to watch many forms of dance. Lovely lines, sharp beats, tapping toes, all of it.

4960689,3,B0065IYS3G,I love ballet and watched the first of this series for that reason alone. My personal preferences dictate a less dramatic version of the story they're portraying with less of the nasty interaction between the players.,1397088000,,217,5.055555555555555
4960690,5,B0065IYS3G,"Tim Pocock is a wonderful actor, making his character a little bit more than it's been written. In other words, he gave it his own spin on it, rescuing it from a cliche role. The rest of the cast is awesome as well, their ballet skills so wonderful to watch. It is an intelligent, clean, and inspiring show for the teens (and not only).

4960694,5,B0065IYS3G,"This show features amazing ballet and contemporary dance sequences, truly believable and likable characters, little bit of love, laughter, and tears.  The show is shot in beautiful Sydney, Australia, certainly making this expatriate extremely homesick -
and proud!  A great glimpse into the world of dance, and the reason I prefer this show to, for example, FAME, is as a balletome, I love that the spotlight is on firmly on the artform of dancers - without the distraction of music, vocalist and acting students.

It is well done and the episodes run smoothly and quickly. I am getting ready to start Season 2. Hope it is even better. I am glad in the approach to cover real situations for young people under huge pressure to be perfect in all ways. Covering eating disorder is quite honest as this is a terrible illness hitting young people especially where body image is one of the big stresses. In some ways these actors are quite large looking for the average ballerina who is forced to keep weight abnormally low to prevent developement and also to remain light for the continuous lifts involved. Not easy to lift a 130 lb. woman. Also, the competition between the dancers is realistic.",1390262400,2,812,4.645833333333333

We are a family of dancers and we like that there are many scenes with real dance and real dancers. Showing dance class  demonstrates the work that is involved, and not just the performing aspect and what young dancers go through to achieve their goals. Sydney Harbor is a beautiful setting.

We've watched other dance shows but my granddaughters said they like this one best because it really shows dance. Even my husband, not a dancer, enjoys the show, especially the cenery",1388275200,2,567,4.775510204081633

4960737,5,B0065IYS3G,"I'd say almost anyone would benefit from watching Dance Academy, adult or young person.  Many adults have not learned the lessons which are personified among this group of young adults.  Many adults make the same mistakes the students do.  Many adults do not yet know themselves well enough to avoid the pitfalls of growing up and becoming an adult. The series provides many topics for discussion groups on behavior.

There are many lessons one can learn from this series: patience, perseverance, commitment, honor and loyalty; betrayal, cooperation, appreciation, confronting one's problems, learning to know oneself, assessing/reading character, decision making, pursuing goals, prioritizing, the concept of community vs. individual, excellence vs. mediocrity, reality vs. fantasy, responsibility, integrity, effort and friendship.  The caste performs well, acting out options of behavior in the process of growing up, all amidst Sydney's wonderful land- and seascapes.

Unlike most American-made series for young adults, this program does not portray sex or direct violence.",1377216000,,1077,5.828025477707007

4960755,4,B0065IYS3G,"Let me preface this by saying that I have never danced at all, ever, in my life. I am, quite possibly, the most uncoordinated person on the planet. So I have no basis for really judging the dancing, but to me, it looks perfect. The dancing, music, and choreography bring this show to life, and it's very easy to get wrapped up in the story and the characters.

The show is intended for a teen audience, but I really enjoyed it (I'm in my mid-30s). Some of the love-triangles can get a little tired, but I was able to look past that. Overall, I would recommend watching this.

I have already finished season 2, and I don't want to give anything away, but **POSSIBLE SPOILER** something very sad happens at the end of season 2, and honestly, it makes me wish that I hadn't started watching the show, because it was a little addictive, and it's very easy to connect with the characters. I'm not a big fan of the choices that writers made in season 2, but this first season is definitely worth watching.",1373328000,2,999,4.394594594594595

4960758,4,B0065IYS3G,I would recommend this as a suitable show for youth who enjoy watching dance-themed shows.  It provides just the right amount of realism without being corny.,1372896000,,157,5.038461538461538
4960759,5,B0065IYS3G,"Amazing talent in this show. Actual dancers watching will not be disappointed. The choreo is pretty good, the technique of the dancers is spot on, the variations are correct. PLUS, the story lines are great. The show deals with 15-16 yr+ age group, guys and girls, at a prestigious dance school. I appreciated that none o the dancers, though all beautiful dancers, were not stick thin and the show didn't focus on the stereotypical ballet drama like eating disorders, depression, etc. I loved this show.

4960762,5,B0065IYS3G,"Dance Academy gives you a somewhat romanticized look into the lives and struggles of students at a prestigious ballet school in Sydney. It deals with topics teens can identify with in a non-preachy way and even while I'm not a teen anymore, I definitely enjoy it. The dance routines are great, the drama is heartfelt, the comedic moments are always well timed. It can get corny and the acting sometimes isn't amazing, but these are young dancers who happen to be getting started with acting so it's understandable. Overall, I highly recommend it.

The whole homosexual theme was so unnecessary and totally unwanted. It ruined the series for me and my kids.",1369785600,5,266,4.804347826086956
4960768,4,B0065IYS3G,"I liked it a lot. Once you started watching you couldn't stop at just one episode.  All characters were interesting. Acting was ok at times, sometimes a little immature.  But over all good show if you like to dance.",1369785600,,215,4.487179487179487
4960778,5,B0065IYS3G,I love this series because of my past experience as a dancer.  It truly reflects the growing pains and pressures experienced by young dancers.

The only thing that kinda bothered me from this season is how constantly the teenagers jump from partner to partner (romantic partners that is). They resolve their issues fairly quickly too, I think that the show needs more mystery or cliffhangers. Other than that I love the show, being a dancer myself ( no ballet but modern dance and african dance) I get really into the show and know their worries and struggles with the pressure of performing in front of a live audience. So if you are a dancer or just love to dance, this show is for you!",1369180800,,704,4.465116279069767

Both seasons are amazing, and season two is even better because the characters are well-developed at this point.  I fell in love with each character one by one and it was very easy for me to identify these teenagers, even though I'm an adult.  Btw, get a box of tissues for season two.

4960795,5,B0065IYS3G,"I stumbled across this show and decided to give it try... and I was totally, quite happily, surprised.  It's not so much that the acting or dancing swept me off my feet it was the careful development of all the characters that ended up holding my rapt attention.  There is a wonderful sense of tension between these young people, who are so flawed yet striving for perfection in the demandingly perfect world of ballet. That tension spills out from their personal internal struggles as well into their interpersonal relationships with each other as they learn what it means to be who they are meant to be.  They have definitely not arrived by any means as they continue to struggle with pressure and all the little twists & turns their lives take along their amazing journeys...  This is a wonderful drama about coming of age and learning from your mistakes as well of from your triumphs. I found the characters heart-warmingly genuine and loved watching them grow with the challenges they face.  Really enjoyed this gem of show and hope it continues on!",1363824000,5,1054,4.769230769230769

I love the mix of dance and acting - neither overpowering the other but complementing instead. Teen issues are real as well as the teachers who show them that it takes hard work to achieve their goals, and to make them aware that dance is a tough competitive business. Well acted across the board, kudos to the producers for casting Tara Morice (wonderful in ""Strictly Ballroom""). Am anxious for many more seasons of this one!",1363737600,2,520,4.663043478260869

4960816,5,B0065IYS3G,"I started watching this show because I love to watch dancing.  The actors do almost all of their own dancing and are extremely talented at it.  It's more than just ballet, though that's the focus.  I'm an adult, and sometimes the teenage drama gets a little irritating, but overall I like the show because it's about good people who make some bad mistakes and how they move forward and learn from what they've done wrong.  There's plenty of great dancing along the way.",1360540800,4,469,4.614457831325301

It took me a few episodes to get into it, but pretty soon watching my nightly episodes was all I thought about throughout the day. It was like falling in love, with each episode I was more impressed with the layered characters, the perfect level of realistic drama, and the dancing...oh my the dancing!!!! The choreography alone is another character in the story it is so well done and danced by the actors. I loved how the ballet dancing cliches like boys being gay, eating disorders by the girls, and falling in love with your dance partner were all touched on but not in a way that made me feel anything but what it would really be like to be a dancer.

Also Sydney shines in the show too...Just watch it already! I can't wait for season 3!

Definitely not your typical cheesy/predictable dance show.  Blazed through season 1 and 2.  Can't wait for Season 3!",1357257600,,377,4.552238805970149
4960822,5,B0065IYS3G,"Once you have watched the first episode, you will be too.
the top three reasons this is true:
1) The characters;
Tara Webster; Tara is one of the more-focused-on main characters. At the beggining of the season, she is painfully naive. She starts off the year as the worst dancer in her class. She becomes friends with the wrong girl, walks into the wrong dressing room on her first day, and falls in love with the wrong boy. But eventually she sees things for what they are.
Abigail Armstrong; At first Abigail, who is also one of the more-focused-on characters, seems like the stereotype mean girl. She hates everyone who is better than her at dancing, wants to kill Tara and all her friends, and is a all around suck up. But it turns out that Abigail behaves that way because of her problems. You have to feel for her when the show reveals them.
Kat Karamokov; Kat is another of the most-focused-on characters. She is the ""rebel"". Her mom is a famous ballet dancer, and Kat is sick of all the pressure to be perfect, her older brother breaking all her girlfriend's hearts, and her parents ignoring her. So she hates all things ballet, or so she thinks she does. The truth about her relationship with dancing is revealed at the end of the season.
Christian Reed; Christian is the bad boy. The way he grew up is the reason for this. Because of his father leaving him, he has serious rejection issues, and because he always was forced to take care of his mother, he refuses to let anyone take care of him. Then he falls in love. Only, the girl he loves finds it hard to love him back. He is one of the more-focused-on characters.
Sammy Leperman; Sammy has always always been picked on and bullied. He finally finds a home at the academy. Even though he thinks the academy will fix everything in his life, it basically makes it worse. He has bitter fights with his family, has to be ""neutral"" in his friends many fights, and gets dumped.
Ethan Karamokov: Ethan is the player. He has a habit of kissing and dissing--but then he falls in love! And when he gets dumped for once, he starts to question his ways.
2)The ballet;
I always thought ballet was pretty, but plain and boring. This show gave me a peek of what was behind the scenes at a ballet. Now, whenever I watch ballets, I think about how much each dancer must have gone through to get on that stage.
3)The twists and turns;
No episode didn't have a suprise or shock in it. Nothing ever stayed the same for long. It had me biting my nails to see the next episode.",1356825600,3,2519,4.407725321888412
4960823,5,B0065IYS3G,"Awesome series, I'm somewhat patiently waiting for the next season to be added! Great storyline, I don't cry with movies, but this one can bring up the tears and also the story telling is not basic. You never really know what's going to happen next.",1344988800,,249,4.555555555555555
4960824,5,B0065IYS3G,"Package was delivered as expected. Songs weren't available when I wanted, so ordered the CD and so glad I did. Great dance music- been listening to this soundtrack over and over. Thanks!",1344816000,,186,4.84375
4960825,5,B0065IYS3G,This series is very impressive. The dancing is beautiful - the process grueling and  because the storylines are well written (not sappy or silly as in most of the Disney channel shows) and well acted by strong cast I was immediately taken in and watched both seasons in three days. I also like the fact that the viewer gets to see the natural beauty of Australia and how truly lovely it is in Sydney. Can't wait for Season 3.,1336694400,8,425,4.379746835443038
4960826,5,B0065IYS3G,"I have said it before and I'll say it again - it's very rare that I blog about anything other than books. So when I make an exception to this rule, you can guess that I have a new (worthy) obsession to spruik.

My new exceptional obsession is the Australian ABC3 teen drama, `Dance Academy'. To be fair, I am jumping on this band-wagon way too late. The first season aired in Australia in 2010, followed by a year-long gap when the show's creators didn't know if it would be picked up for a second season . . . which it (thankfully) was, airing this year between March and April. There are 26 episodes in a season, and the last one for 2012 aired on April 24. And, yes, a third season has been commissioned (no word on whether or not there will be another year-long gap between season 2 and 3, making for a 2014 release?).

The show follows fifteen-year-old country ballerina, Tara Webster (Xenia Goodwin) whose love of dance stems from a dream of flying. Tara gets one step closer to her dream when she is accepted into Sydney's prestigious National Dance Academy. . .  but it doesn't take long before Tara realizes that loving dance isn't the same as being a good dancer.

Tara's technique is not where it needs to be, and her fellow students at the Academy are cut-throat, with their eye on becoming principal dancers by the end of their three years. In her first week at the Academy, Tara is given the nickname `training bra' by scholarship kid Christian Reed (Jordan Rodrigues) after an embarrassing changing-room incident with the beautiful Ethan Karamakov (Tim Pocock) who happens to be the half-son of an infamous Australian prima-ballerina and choreographer. Tara's roommate is Abigail Armstrong (Dena Kaplan) the best and most ruthless first year dancer at the academy, and the one with the biggest grudge against `country bumpkin', Tara.

Tara is ranked lowest in all of her dance classes and her teacher, the cold-blooded Miss Raine (Tara Morice) lets her know that she has a long way to go. . .  But Tara got into the Academy because she has something that no dancer can learn - she puts her heart and soul into every pointe and pirouette. She dances from the heart.

There are bright spots in Tara's new life. Like Ethan's half-sister, Kat Karamakov (Alicia Banit) a bubbly, bright and begrudgingly good dancer who struggles to be one of the `betty bunheads'. Kat's best friend is Samuel `Sammy' Lieberman (Tom Green) string-bean with a heart of gold, who is attending the Academy without his father's support.

Season one of `Dance Academy' follows Tara and her friends through the highs and lows of first year. Second season shows the gang return for second year, and adds goofball Ben Tickle (Thomas Lacey) to the crew, as well as new prima mean-girl in Grace Whitney (Issi Durant).

`Dance Academy' is phenomenal. Created by Samantha Strauss and Joanna Werner, it is a fantastic series that combines a coming-of-age story with all the requisite heartbreak, love triangles and hiccups, with the backdrop of a competitive creative environment.

The show is shot in the heart of Sydney, literally. The National Dance Academy is situated near Circular Quay, while the boarding school lies in The Rocks (the most beautiful and expensive area of the city). There are lots of panning shots of the Harbour Bridge, and especially in second season the Opera House becomes the stage for a worldwide dance competition, the Prix de Fontayne.

I also love the show because it has a great, diverse cast. When so many Australian shows are lacking ethnic diversity in their casts, `Dance Academy' shows a far truer Australian melting-pot and is more interesting for it. But the diversity is also in the storylines explored - the show had a wonderful plot about Sammy being attracted to his male roommate, Christian . . .  this plot, in particular, was handled beautifully with no over-dramatizing; it was treated as the coming-of-age it was, grounded in reality and with little flamboyance some shows sometimes want to give the `coming out' storyline.

Other heavy issues have been touched on - such as eating disorders and bullying (in the form of teacher/student, to make for an especially interesting change). And, of course, the complications of love and relationships are also consistently touched on. From liking your best friend's brother, to liking your best friend's ex. First season has a mini love-triangle between Tara, Christian and Ethan while second season changes shape to explore a Kat/Christian/Tara love complication. The romantic up's and down's of these characters are a real draw-card for fans, and the writers do a brilliant job of spreading the drama out across 26, half-hour episodes. But my favourite couplings have been Sammy's - the character with the most interesting and diverse love background, I have most enjoyed his romantic storylines.

I can't go past a review of `Dance Academy' without at least touching on the dancing in the show (even though I must confess, I have the dance skills of a one-legged robot). The choreography is beautiful, and tells a story in itself. From Tara's obsession with `The Red Shoes', to Sammy's explosively heartbreaking season two solo, performed to the Jezabel's `She's So Hard'. The actors do a remarkable job, and the choreography is so good that while watching an episode I do find my feet pointing and hips shaking. God, I wish I could dance.

I fell into obsession watching the first season of `Dance Academy', but it was really the second season that cemented this show as something truly remarkable for me. The second season storyline takes a dramatic and heart-wrenching twist towards the end. I refuse to give anything away, but save to say the writers outdid themselves and the actors broke my heart while watching a breathtakingly sad story unfold.

`Dance Academy' is one of the best Australian shows I have had the pleasure of watching in recent years. It's a little bit `Centre Stage' crossed with `Heartbreak High', and with stories and dialogue that would do Aussie YA proud. The actors are phenomenal, the choreography sublime and I am happily addicted. For curious international's, I believe `Dance Academy' episodes can be downloaded on iTunes (don't hesitate - just watch and get on the bandwagon!).",1335312000,28,6288,4.901222953904045
