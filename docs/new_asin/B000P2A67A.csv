8494824,5,B000P2A67A,"I'm a huge fan of What Not To Wear. With the show having gone off the air, I'm now monthly buying on Amazon episodes from the first four seasons that I've never seen (which technically means the show hasn't ended for me ... woot, woot!)
Anyone reading any WNTW review I do should know:
1) I'm only doing these reviews to give the ep 5 stars; I will give EVERY ep 5 stars as a nod to the general greatness of WNTW. I admit it, I'm biased. (But really, if the knowledge, fun, and drama aren't enough, the brilliance and wit of Stacy and Clinton push every ep to a 5 anyway!)
2) While I don't have time for big writeups on each DVD, a few observations: I entered knowing this was going to be a sass-fest, as one of the funniest-ever WNTW moments, which I've seen on the Internet, is a Kerryellen and Stacy dressing-room-area exchange (and there's another great moment with Clinton in the dressing room). Indeed, Kerryellen, who's got a mouth on her, gets off some lines and Stacy and Clinton deftly return fire. But then a strange thing happens. Kerryellen, who has a petite body most women would die for, and is very cute no matter what her hair color, suddenly starts to show some major insecurities even as she's still tossing out one-liners. Didn't see that coming, and it was fascinating watching S and C and Nick and Carmindy work with her to get an awesome final look, for which Kerryellen expressed thanks. Excellent ep!
3) However, I would be remiss if I didn't again mention the cost ... $19.95 per ep? WTF! I am a big enough fan of the show, and have the resources, to buy them. But do I see anybody else purchasing them? Probably not. Yet if you do spring for this ep you certainly will enjoy it.
