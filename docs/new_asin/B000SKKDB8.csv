I can't really say whether the story is good or not. I have only watched the first episode. I got it for Morrissey and Serkis. I'd like to see the rest, but have to do it on a day when I can focus and give it my whole attention.",1394668800,,392,3.8518518518518516
8205664,4,B000SKKDB8,"this movie is great..it's got a great storyline, the acting is good and Finney played by David  Morrisey is just right for the part, it's a crime family story but not your usual kind, don't miss it",1372464000,2,197,4.324324324324325
8205665,5,B000SKKDB8,"It is refreshing to see how the British do a mini-series like this.  The first thing you notice is that, apparently, they are not so shocked and offended by a bit of frontal nudity as we are, or, at least, the censors here think we are.  There is little or no blue language.  Just interesting -- even compelling -- and well-thought-out scripts, and good British acting.

David Morrissey is always a favorite.  Here he plays the black sheep of a northern crime family.  Rather, one should say he is the 'white' sheep as he wants nothing to do with the family's illegal shenanigans and has become a professional jazz musician.  He is called back when his father is killed, perhaps by a local syndicate.

He becomes involved in the family again, wants to stay in the area to open a new jazz club of his own, make peace with rival families, and repair things with his wayward wife.

Good characters, story, photography, and acting make this an enjoyable series -- if not one that demands multiple viewings.",1266710400,5,1002,4.6158192090395485
