8520236,3,B007P9HW0A,"After waiting for Danny (Graham) to pay off his debt the local mob boss (O'Hara) is ready to settle up right now. After Danny's large and strong but feeble minded friend Joseph (Akinnuoye-Agbaje) steps in and saves him. The mob boss offers Danny a way out. All he has to do is let Joseph fight in underground cage fights until Danny's debt is paid. This is a dark and depressing updated version of ""Of Mice And Men"" mixed with a more serious version of ""Snatch"". The acting is good and the movie itself is very good and very watchable. Like most British movies I have seen there are scenes of intense action that keeps you glued mixed in with scenes that tend to drag on a little bit longer then needed and you start to lose interest in parts. I am in no way saying that this is a bad movie at all because I did like it, but the flow wasn't smooth to me. Danny reminded my a lot of Tony Montana in this movie in the way that you want to root against him, but find yourself rooting for him and want him to succeed. That may just be me though. Overall, a serious and somewhat slow moving ""Snatch"" like version of ""Of Mice And Men"" that is worth a watch. I thought it was good. I give it a B.",1337644800,,1189,4.1072961373390555
8520237,4,B007P9HW0A,"This film has been `loosely inspired' by John Steinbeck's novel `Of Mice and Men' - hence the title. It is set in Nottingham and starts with Danny (Stephen Graham) getting Joseph (Adewale Akkinuoye-Agbaje) to steal a washing machine, they are stopped by local heavy Curtis (David O'Hara). Danny has had a drug deal go bad leaving him indebted to Curtis, therefore he has to pay some other way.

As he is about to get a kicking, Joseph turns up and steps in to Danny's rescue. His pugilistic skills are thus revealed to Curtis and he can see an alternative way to get Danny's debt discharged. Yes that is in illegal cage fights with Joseph being the secret weapon. Only problem is that Danny has `special needs' and is one of those gentle giant types, and this runs completely contra to his values.

Danny meanwhile seeks solace in alcohol, drugs and prostitutes with a considerable degree of success. He falls for one and endeavours to start a relationship with her. Joseph meanwhile has rescued a girl form bullies who also needs special care and they form a bond too, apart from Isobel all he has ever wanted is a camper van. But the fights are going to get harder and Danny knows that things are getting out of hand.

This is a bristling thriller from director David Blair who has used the Steinbeck novel only as a starter as the rest is a story all of its own with a much removed ending and an unusual setting. There is not a bad performance, but the two central characters are utterly convincing and utterly compelling. It is also brutal in the scenes of violence and charming in the way it handles the relation ships.

There is so much crammed into the 104 minutes that it is the sort of film you will want to see a second time, we also do have a fair amount of rutting going on, but the violence is the sort that happens in real life, people get hurt no punches are pulled as to the full effects of violence and there are scenes of drug abuse. This is an urban, gritty British drama that adds to the recent clutch of good crime thrillers but is actually almost a genre on its own - highly recommended.",1334448000,,2109,4.427835051546392
8520238,3,B007P9HW0A,"This is an odd combination of heartwarming friendship and crime. Danny (Stephen Graham) owes a crime boss big money.  Joseph (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) is his mentally handicapped friend who is strong as an ox. Danny persuades Joseph to fight in underground cage matches to pay off his debt. This is something Joseph does not like to do.

They both meet girls to add some spice to the plot. The acting was superb. The movie was well written, although I felt I had seen it before while watching it for the first time. For me the film wasn't overly entertaining.
