6403020,5,B00K5PWOWW,Good transfer to DVD.  Great story plot about true romance with a little bit of a war background.  Love it.,1445644800,,107,4.3
6403021,3,B00K5PWOWW,"Okay, it's another WWII movie.  You know, back when God was on Our Side.  Try pausing about 10 minutes before the end and try to guess what will happen.  And please don't tell anyone what the Title means.  They won't believe you anyway, so go ahead.  Joe Versus The Volcano is perfect as far as I believe, but Believe this combination flashback and religious wishfulness, will you?  You gotta be a few years older than I am, a War Baby, and still have Traditional Values.  Five stars, if you are Pre War, one star if you are too young to realize how close to Pearl Harbor we still are.  Some WWII vets may love this tearjerker.  Smug kids will just laugh.  Johnson and Allyson supposedly were lovers in ""real life.""  Big surprise.  I wanted her to do more singing and dancing, but that's not fair.",1433808000,,797,4.4206896551724135
6403022,5,B00K5PWOWW,great movie,1426896000,,11,5.0
6403023,4,B00K5PWOWW,"Over the years, I have seen parts of this film but never its entirety. I just saw the DVD and rather enjoyed the story. The film shows a highly idealised picture of pre WW2 America ( no mention of the Depression or its effect on the population). Nonetheless, the story is uplifting if somewhat bittersweet for me as my late parents were from that generation and shared its hopes and fears. Van Johnson
may not have been a great actor but he was certainly a likeable one. No one can steal a scene like Thomas Mitchell. Overall, certainly worth your time.",1425859200,5,553,4.485148514851486
6403024,1,B00K5PWOWW,Sooooo boring! Very disappointed with this one. I don't like these two in all dramatic parts. They shine better with some comedy. Id pass on this one.,1419292800,,150,4.592592592592593
6403025,5,B00K5PWOWW,Enjoyable,1416873600,,9,9.0
6403026,5,B00K5PWOWW,"I saw this movie the first time in 1953.  It is a simple story with major stars.  The plot is of the romantic/drama/action mode.  Simply, two kids grow up next door to each other with a imaginary island they call ""High Barbaree"".  They get separated by the war and magically, they get back together to become one.  A very nice movie that can be somewhat of a tearjerker.  Try it, you'll like it.",1414022400,2,395,4.342465753424658
6403027,5,B00K5PWOWW,Love the two of them together.  They play so well off each other.,1410220800,,65,4.0
8656061,1,B00K5PWOWW,"I've read ""The High Barbaree"" several times and really enjoy it. When i saw the movie version was available I bought it expecting a great film. What I saw was not what I was expecting. The picture quality was fine but this wasn't ""The High Barbaree that Nordoff and Hall wrote. It was butchered up with scenes that weren't even in the book. The High Barbaree itself, while being a big part of the book, accounted for one scene at the end.
I couldn't have been more disappointed at a book to movie presentation. When the credits rolled I took out the DVD and tossed it in the trash can.",1524787200,,585,4.327272727272727
8656062,4,B00K5PWOWW,Brought back some old memories of when I watched this movie as a child. Loved it.,1501286400,,81,4.125
8656063,5,B00K5PWOWW,It's a classic i enjoy so much.,1498521600,,31,3.5714285714285716

8656065,5,B00K5PWOWW,"I never finished watching High Barbaree on a morning before school in 1960. Since then I have been on the lookout to finish watching this film with no luck for 56 years. I was thrilled to finally cross this off my bucket list, Great film with two of my favorite actors. The chemistry between June Allyson and Van Johnson is superb.",1483401600,,331,4.442622950819672
8656066,4,B00K5PWOWW,"I remember this movie from my childhood - watched it on TV. Love Van Johnson & June Allyson and after I saw it again many decades later, I find it holds up surprisingly well.",1471132800,,174,4.147058823529412
8656067,5,B00K5PWOWW,Great movie,1463616000,,11,5.0
8656068,4,B00K5PWOWW,"A shot down naval aviator recounts his life and his quest for an ideal place.  Similar to Brigadoon, which also starred Van Johnson, and which came later.

Some contemporary footage of PBY Catalina operations.  The flying boat used in closeup work is easily recognizable as a PBN Nomad variant due to the unique nost turret.

In flashback we see joy riding in a Ryan PT, and the test flight of a civilian marked O-49/L-1 Vigilant.",1463443200,3,430,4.693333333333333
8656069,5,B00K5PWOWW,Excellent.,1461628800,,10,10.0
8656070,5,B00K5PWOWW,"I tried to find this movie off and on over the years with no luck.  Thanks for having it now at a reasonable price.  Old reviews called it ""corny"" but I personally think that it is a masterpeice and a classic ... and I am an old movie buff!  It is a wonderful addition to my library.",1456876800,9,283,3.9298245614035086
