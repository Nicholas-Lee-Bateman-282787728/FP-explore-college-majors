8262047,4,B0016AKSJQ,"Being a fan to the original film First Blood, I was pretty disappointed in the two sequels that followed. I found them to both be shallow, too cartoony and replaces solid characters and story with too many expositions and nonsense. That's not to say they are't entertaining, but they fall far short of the original.

Rambo, the third sequel redeems the series with a gritty, more story based action film. It; sis easily the second best in the series and it wouldn't have bothered me if this was the only sequel to First Blood.  This film is very bloody with graphic violence throughout. Stallone gives a his second best performance as the unstoppable force known as John Rambo.

The Transfer on Blu Ray looks and sounds fantastic, with enough bonus features that should satisfy anyone. The main feature-ette is actually longer than the film. If you;re a fan of the series this is certainly one to ice up and if you're interested in watching some of the Rambo films, I'd suggest the first and the last.",1458172800,,1001,4.676136363636363

8262052,5,B0016AKSJQ,"This is not your guts and glory Rambo film. RAMBO is an interesting film and Sylvester Stallone has an interesting take on the Rambo character. Rambo's dialogue is space and a bit cryptic. He reflects on his motivations. There is a pure cinematic quality to Stallone's direction. The story is virtually told through through the camera's eye. Almost all dialogue seems superfluous to what we see in the images. Rambo takes mercenaries up river as they spew and embellish in ritualistic and meaningless banter.

RAMBO is an inversion of what we last saw in RAMBO III. I think it looks at the whole genre of war films and sees nothing admirable or noble in them. War is nothing but carnage and a futile waste of humanity. This notion is graphically represented here. In the end Rambo has come full circle and its time he went home.",1415232000,,828,4.671232876712328
