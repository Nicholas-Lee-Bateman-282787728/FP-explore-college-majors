7307381,5,B010CG2D8I,"I think the few reviews for this movie are pretty spot on. I loved it and I plan on watching it again because once you watch the extras and really understand what the Director was going for it will make it all that much better. Great sound effects in this movie and that helps since there is zero dialogue. I am an avid horror movie collector and am very happy that I now own this film.

Highly recommended,

7307383,4,B010CG2D8I,"If you're one of those horror fans that have been complaining that there are no good, original, new horror films coming out these days, then you have not seen FLOWERS from Director Phil Stevens.  This is a film unlike I've ever seen....it's vile and disgusting, yet beautiful at the same time.  It's probably the closest you will ever get to an gore soaked art film.

Now, I have to be honest with you....I'm not sure I understand this film 100%.  I think that is ok though, I think that leaves it open to multiple interpretations by multiple people.  From what I gather from the film, we are looking at different murder victims who are in purgatory, which in this case is a disgusting, dilapidated old house full of dangers around every corner.  The film is unique in that it features no dialog whatsoever.  What is amazing about that, is that is doesn't need any.  The films is written and acted so well we can get the story from the actresses emotions and mannerisms captured on the film.  The film does contain sound effects and an amazing score which really sets the tone of the film. Also, FLOWERS was filmed with a very drab, yellowish tone, which really helped set the mood for the film as well.

  The films starts with one woman, making her way through a bloody, gore soaked crawlspace of the house.  When she comes up  through a hole in the floor, we now see a different woman.  The film changes between all the women in the ""house"" very seamlessly.  While this was part of what confused me at first, I soon realized there are multiple victims here and we are seeing all of their struggles, sewn together by the fact they were all victims of the same killer.

  As mentioned before, the acting in this film is amazing.  I know some might say it's easy to act when you don't have to say anything, but I think just the opposite.  I think that is actually harder.  Trying to tell a story with no dialog means that the actors and actresses have to rely on their visuals and emotional expressions only.  All the women in this film did an amazing job, and that was definitely not an easy task from what I saw.  The set pieces were extremely vile and disgusting, and the women in this film were usually right in there with it...being covered in blood, guts, and whatever other bodily liquids and body parts there were!

  FLOWERS is a film you need to check out soon.  It's not for the easily squeamish, as there are some very disgusting scenes, but it is a very well made film and to me is a home run for first time director Phil Stevens.  I imagine we will see great things in the horror community from Mr. Stevens in the years to come!",1447200000,8,2642,4.412008281573499
7307384,5,B010CG2D8I,Amazing film by an amazing filmmaker. I bought Flowers when it first came out a year or so ago. I am so glad it's getting the deluxe treatment. Unearthed went all out with the 3 disc edition.,1446076800,7,191,4.1891891891891895
7307385,5,B010CG2D8I,"This is a film that its hard to explain for a lot of people. Its one of those that if you like Disturbing, weird, gory movies then it right up our alley..
 I would say watch the trailer and if it tickles your Disturbing side in the right way. Then i say get it. That what got me to Pre-order my copy.
 If you are disgusted to easily or timid. I say no. But i dare you to watch it once. It might not even scare most. But leaves the WTF did i watch or i don't get it moment.. There's not really a plot to follow. But i have to say the imagery is right on. Dark, F**ked up even chilling. This great film to play on unexpected friends or a Halloween scare creepy feel.

 If there is a plot.. It's like a Ghost watching them self after their body dies.. On how they died and their stuck in the house.
Theirs no voice acting. Just music and sound effects.  So you really got to take it in Scene by Scene.
I think it's very clever and unique to this film..

 So when you watch this film. Have an open mind and Go along with the ride.",1445904000,15,1026,3.9038461538461537

8721978,5,B010CG2D8I,"Flowers is not a slasher film. It is a horror film, and one that has been well thought out. There are only a few films I have seen that are truly frightening to me: Wolf Creek, the Descent, the Hills Have Eyes, the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Saw and moment from a couple of others like the opening of Jaws, where the woman, swimming alone is attacked by a shark, the beginning of Cliffhanger, where the woman is hanging over a thousand foot crevasse, and even a film called Open Water. Flowers reflects a lot of the work of Jan vankmajer, a Czech filmmaker, known for his stop-action and claymation incorporated with human actors, as well as Club of the Discarded by Jeri Barta, another Czech filmmaker. Flowers is thought-provoking, something lacking in the majority of films today. Does anyone have any in depth discussion after watching Iron Man or Wonder Woman or Transformers?  Movies that make you think seem to have gone the way of tear jerkers and romantic (screwball) comedies. Flowers is not an edge of your seat kind of film. It is an edge of your soul kind.",1521158400,,1076,4.633507853403142

8721980,1,B010CG2D8I,"I feel as if I was magnanimous in donating enough  time watching this 'film' so the review will be succinct.  There is no dialogue, little in the way of substantive direction and if you like to watch the cinematic ramblings of people crawling mud and muck, you have found your 'film.'  Keep it moving as this was simply another in a long line of froth over substance garbage trying to appear artsy and deep.",1482969600,,407,4.472972972972973
8721981,2,B010CG2D8I,"The synopsis on Amazon VOD sounded extremely interesting.  Unfortunately, the cinematography was just kinda bland, and the acting was even worse.  Not to mention the film was extremely slow moving.  I got 3 minutes into it.  I saw a woman clawing her way out of a plastic bag and watching through a window at what appeared to be a prostitute was being degraded.  These two things took at least 3 minutes.  If this had been a beer-bellied fast action film, the lack of craftiness would be excusable.  Total waste of $4.  There's good reason Redbox doesn't have this.  Not that everything Redbox has available is solid gold...most of it is mediocre at best, IMO...",1482710400,,662,4.7368421052631575
8721982,5,B010CG2D8I,"Very dark and twisted, but beautifully filmed. If you look closely, it has a message, but you have to dig through the blood, guts and bones to find it.",1479859200,,151,4.241379310344827
8721983,1,B010CG2D8I,"Well, I gave it a chance. I'd read mixed reviews online but there were a few that intrigued me enough to get the movie. I'm sure there's an audience for this film. It seemed more of a--- I don't  know--- a fetish-type movie. I don't mean that as criticism of anyone here who likes the movie. I'm just trying to give the sort of information I'd want when deciding whether to purchase the product. Yes, I realize it's experimental and therefore the narrative is unconventional... it just didn't work for me. Way too much wet goopy post-violence gore. Kudos deserved for most of the sets, which were created in the filmmaker's home. Also, for the most part, the use of lighting. Ironically, my favorite parts featured a sort of reverse of what is usually used in a ""horror"" film, specifically, scenes of sharp objects being pulled, one-by-one, FROM a door or wall. For the most part, the performers are quite good in their thoroughly thankless roles, though, when something is pitched this high, it can tip over into overwrought, which this does from time to time, due to the wordless aspect of the performances. However, the real sore thumb sticking out for me was the man playing the killer. It's made very clear in the extras that this guy had no experience other than being an admitted exhibitionist. I found him to be, well, awful. I cite this because it pulled me out of being so involved in what was happening on screen, and that annoyed me. Whenever he appeared it really felt like one of those shot-on-video, budding special-effects artist's movies, featuring the budding artist's friends. Frankly, I think this entire thing would have worked better edited way down and used for one or two music videos. I'm a fan of well-done horror with minimalist scores but I think this would actually benefit from being paired with some hammering, brutal music, even if that might seem too obvious a choice. The trailers included for the other dvds from this company seem a lot worse, though. This at least has an art aesthetic to it. I can't recommend it, though.",1473897600,3,2058,4.716666666666667

8721986,4,B010CG2D8I,"I'm quite impressed by the fact that one can make a whole horrorfilm without a single dialogue. The film is made in an artistic way, capturing the very essence of classic horror. Unfortunately analysing litterature, poems nor films is not my strongest side, so I probably missed a lot of symbolics and messages, but the movie tells a story, quite a sad one.
Filmed in sephia-tones it contains enough gore and unpleasantries to make a solid impression. The scenes are slow, often filmed in long takes which gives the viewer a possibility of really feeling the characters in view.
Not your typical Saturday night horrorfilm over a beer or two, but certainly a film that leaves a mark.",1462665600,2,682,4.788135593220339
