8520064,5,B00595K0MY,"We're trying to design our Dream Home and it sometimes is a Nightmare Home it seems! Neither of us are the ""fix-it"" kind and we get frustrated easily, especially in these early stages with the plans. We want to add a window or something and the designer says, ""Ok, but then we have to change this and this"" and it does seem obvious when he tells us that but not before! We needed a different approach.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/House-Plans-Your-Step-by-Step-Guide-to-Finding-Your-Dream-Home/dp/B00595K0MY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">House Plans - Your Step-by-Step Guide to Finding Your Dream Home</a>&nbsp;REALLY made it easier for us. First of all, the DVD simplified EVERYTHING for us - the DVD should be required watching by anyone trying to create their family Dream Home.

Also, the plans at the web site gave us tons of ideas that we didn't have before. It may be that after the DVD and learning from all the resources how to get stock house plans and learning about modifications, we are probably just better prepared than we were before. But now we can more intelligently discuss what we want... and the first thing we did was toss out everything we had and start over. Turns out that was the BEST thing we could have done and we then really went to town. There were a lot of myths that we had heard about house plans and designs and this material saved us from trouble there too.

We HIGHLY RECOMMEND this and all the extras it gives for anyone who wants the perfect family home.",1311638400,,1537,5.047244094488189
