4902364,5,B005X7H9RW,"Being a baby boomer, I fondly remember the various David Wolper documentaries, especially ""Biography"" and space ones such as these. They're well done on all levels and the film material used here is, no doubt, the best that could be found. The picture may not be as sharp as some might prefer but the contents are more than worth it. Highly recommended.",1330819200,9,353,4.709677419354839
8488337,2,B005X7H9RW,"I will be frank. I did not like this series. It's a black-and-white series from the 1960's with Mike Wallace about the space program. It's very old, very dated. There's a lot of footage here, but just not a very good production. I was not happy with the purchase. Unless you just want it for nostalgia, I'd steer clear of this series.",1484438400,,334,4.403225806451613

8488339,4,B005X7H9RW,these DVDs are worth the money if you have a palate for older media; these documentaries offer the viewing to catch a glimpse of the frenzied zeitgeist of the early cold war.,1417305600,,174,4.46875
8488340,4,B005X7H9RW,"The Space Race has seen a plethora of material released to home video over the years.  Even though I have already owned much of the video here for quite a while, I still pulled the trigger when I came across this at a local bargain outlet for $3.99. This recent offering from Mill Creek features some fairly rare material that hasn't seen the light of day in decades.  While none of this has much new information they are still pretty good and have some respectable transfers for a budget release based largely on newsreel grade footage.  I'll try to detail what's on the discs since the information is vague even on Mill Creek's website.

DISC ONE

This disc contains the 3 David Wolper television documentaries that were apparently licensed directly from The Wolper Organization.  All of them were very well researched and the first two feature the talents of 60 Minutes legend Mike Wallace as well as noted film composer Elmer Bernstein.

THE RACE FOR SPACE (1959/B&W/52 min.) - Covers the developments in rocketry from it's early beginnings with Robert Goddard up to the first satellite launches.  Includes some great coverage on Werner Von Braun and the German rocket team who became highly sought out by the US and Russia at the end of the war.  Was nominated for the 1960 Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature and aside from some groan-inducing scripted interview segments it pretty much lives up to that billing.

PROJECT: MAN IN SPACE (1963/B&W/51 min.) - This one details the training & preparations and reviews the then-recent history of manned spaceflight for both the Soviet Union and America.  Some of the Soviet training footage (real or staged, who knows) is exceedingly rare and I found it fascinating.

RACE FOR THE MOON (1964/B&W/53 min.) - Project Apollo and it's progress up to 1964 is reported on.  This was made before Project Gemini was even in it's flight phase; as such it has some great coverage on very early Apollo hardware and methodologies.  Unfortunately, many of the interview subjects are ""heads of department"" types and senators arguing over funding so a fair portion of the program is spent on political posturing.  Has some insightful comments from astronauts Rusty Schweickart who later flew on Apollo 9 and Ed White who went on to be the first American to walk in space and tragically die in the Apollo 1 fire.

DISC TWO

JOURNEY TO THE MOON: THE APOLLO 11 STORY (2009/B&W/COLOR/44 min.) - The only newer program in this collection, it's a pretty tepid paint-by-the-numbers documentary on Apollo 11.  I suppose it's OK but many others have done a much better job.  If you are familiar with the type of cheaply-made newer docs that feature a bland narrator which often show up on Mill Creek and other budget label collections, well this is in that same vein.

The remaining programs are a sampling of the NASA-produced [usually mission-specific] documentaries that have long been in the public domain and have appeared on countless DVD releases.  They have a long history of abysmal image and sound quality but these ones are amongst the better transfers out there.  The best collection of these films I've come across is a set of VHS put out in the 80s by Easton Press called ""America's Achievements in Space"".  They are worth tracking down if you find this stuff interesting.

TIME OF APOLLO (1975/COLOR/29 min.) - Labeled as ""Apollo 11: Time of Apollo"" but really an overview of the entire program.

APOLLO 12: PINPOINT FOR SCIENCE (1970/COLOR/28 min.) - Kind of a rarity, it's hardly ever featured on DVD releases.

APOLLO 13: ""HOUSTON, WE'VE GOT A PROBLEM"" (1970/COLOR/28 min.) - Very common, the version here is in great quality.

APOLLO 17: ON THE SHOULDERS OF GIANTS (1973/COLOR/28 min.) - Again, it's pretty common but decent quality here.

FLY ME TO THE MOON AND BACK (1966/COLOR/29 min.) - Super rare doc looks at the complex physics of going to the moon.

JFK SPEECH AT RICE UNIVERSITY (1962/COLOR/21 min.) - JFK's ""We choose to go to the moon"" speech in it's entirety.

SLIDESHOW: APOLLO 11

SLIDESHOW: THE UNIVERSE

At the usual low price point for Mill Creek releases, this one is worth it.  Instead of a total rehash they managed to dig up some different material and they should be commended for that effort.  There's enough material here that even the most hardcore space nerd is likely to learn something new or see something different.",1411516800,6,4398,4.851206434316354

8488343,5,B005X7H9RW,This is a very educational set of DVD's to have to learn the beginnings of the space race and the effect it had upon the world at the time it began and is still having today.,1389225600,,174,3.861111111111111
8488344,5,B005X7H9RW,"My daughter had an essay assignment on the Space Race. We live very close to the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum, so we went to their museum store to see what they might have. They didn't have this in, but recommended it. Even though it was done before the moon-landing, its still a good production. The interviews however, are blatantly orchestrated and read apparently from a prompter, but the information on people and events is engaging. The film footage adds nicely.",1387324800,2,472,4.839506172839506
