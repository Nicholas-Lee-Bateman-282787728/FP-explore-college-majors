8182410,5,B000NO2F92,"This is a one of a kind horror film, really funky direction and impressive performances. Definitely worth a look.
I heard also that this film was shot in just 48 hours?! I struggle to understand this, as it looks great, the editing is slow paced but the suspense is sustained by the lead actors and excellent direction.
I recommend this to anyone for a tense night in, or a masterclass in film-making!! 5 star.",1189382400,3,410,4.554054054054054
