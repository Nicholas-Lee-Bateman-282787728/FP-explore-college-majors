3558863,5,B001F0TM62,"Jasmine (played by KeKe Palmer) needs a sitter for after school and her mom can think of no one better than her uncle Curtis (played by Ice Cube).  With nothing in common, the two soon bond over football, and find that some of their interests are the same. While dealing with a father's absence (Jasmine), watching a town (Minden) die or struggle with high unemployment rates, and an uncle who is dealing with lost dreams (knee injury ended his football career) and depression, Jasmine's will prove that perseverance and setting seemingly impossible goals can inspire all.  While her success inspires those around her to do better and motivates a dying town (because plants are closing/bad economy) to reclaim it's previous glory, Jasmine becomes the 1st black female quarterback to play Pop Warner football.  I loved this story, and watched it with my two sons (ages 7 and 10) who were captivated by a tale of ""Hope"".  Ice Cube and Palmer are extraordinary actors and loveable in these roles. Watch ""The Longshots"" and you too will be inspired.",1235520000,,1045,4.887005649717514

It also shows how family is important and how much a younger child needs positive guideness. I am going to buy this movie. They did an excellent job on showing how a female can play football and other sports, just like a male.
I encourage families to show this movie. It also showed a scene where she is being picked on by the ""popular"" kids. Even though her feelings got hurt from being picked on, she still continued to maintain her goals.

3558867,4,B001F0TM62,"""The Longshots,"" on the surface, is a movie we've seen countless times before -- an underachieving team, freshly motivated, become real competitors as they ride from one victory to the next.  What sets ""The Longshots"" apart, however, is the central relationship between a sullen girl and her out-of-work uncle.
 The film is about Jasmine Plummer (Keke Palmer), the first girl quarterback to play in the Pop Warner football tournament.
Jasmine, who lives with her mom, Claire (Tasha Smith), is an eleven-year-old more at ease reading books than socializing with classmates.  She's tried to get involved in after-school activities, but is teased and soon retreats to her books.
 When Claire's work schedule is changed to a later shift, she asks Jasmine's Uncle Curtis (Ice Cube) to look after her in the afternoons.  Reluctantly, Curtis agrees.  Both Jasmine and Curtis initially resent this arrangement, but try to make the best of it.  One day, Curtis, a former high school football player, tosses around a football with Jasmine and sees that she has a good eye and a strong arm.  He talks Jasmine into trying out for the local team, telling her she owes it to herself to pursue something she does well.
 The story is set in the fictional town of Minden, economically devastated since a local factory -- the town's major employer -- closed down a few years ago.  Many shops on the main street are closed, idle men hang out on the streets, and a general air of resigned despair permeates people, buildings, and the town itself.
 The film's second act focuses on Jasmine's making the team and turning around its fortunes from also-ran to winner.  The team's success energizes the town, giving it something to be proud of.
 ""The Longshots"" delivers a far different experience than I anticipated.  Director Fred Durst devotes considerable time to the growing relationship between Jasmine and Curtis.  We really get to know them and have a firm grip on their personalities, fears, and frustrations.  In a non-rushed series of scenes -- some with gently comic moments -- we come to like these two people and care about what will happen to them.
 Ice Cube is very good as Curtis, a man whose self-esteem has taken a hit in the years since his high school glory days.  His Curtis is a decent guy who genuinely cares for his niece, partly because his brother, Jasmine's father, has abandoned her.  His suggestions are never bullying.  They are presented with logical back-up and rationale.  He relies upon Jasmine to weigh the suggestions and decide for herself whether to pursue them.  Ice Cube is wonderfully expressive, and perfectly conveys what he's thinking, a technique invaluable in acting for the camera.
 Ms. Palmer provides a sympathetic yet spirited Jasmine.  As she comes to know her uncle better and like him, she listens to him and comes to have faith in herself and respect for her own athletic ability.  By playing football, she is making her uncle happy, but is also tapping talents she never knew she had.
 What ""The Longshots"" doesn't contain are scenes of excessive team putdowns of Jasmine, big arguments about a girl playing football, and a melodramatic family home life.  Director Durst has wisely cut to the chase, staying with the story of Jasmine, Curtis, and the team's effect on Minden, and avoiding the cliches.
 Rated PG, ""The Longshots""  is an excellent family film -- a movie that can be enjoyed equally by a young audience and their parents.",1226880000,13,3466,4.907216494845361

It focused on poverty, abandonment, rejection, bullying as well as overcoming obstacles, taking risks, reaching for the stars, friendship, community spirit, loyalty and love.

3558898,4,B001F0TM62,"I saw ""The Longshots"" on HBO, and decided to purchase it for my friend and her family.  They live in rural Washington, and don't have the money to go out a lot. I thought TLS was the perfect family movie.

It is hard to find a family film that doesn't have sexual references, bad language, violent or destructive situations. ""The Longshots"" is a great movie for girls, especially. What makes it even better, it's a true story.

A lonely, 14 year old girl in a broken-down town, with a single mother who has to take on extra shifts at work, ends up being ""babysat"" by her uncle [her dad's brother], who she barely knows. Her father, who she misses terribly, is a con artist who only comes around when he wants something.

The relationship between Jasmine, and her uncle [Ice Tea who is GREAT] is at first disconnected.  Neither wants the other around, until her uncle tosses her the football he always carries as a reminder of what might have been, if not for an injury.  When she throws it back, he sees she has quite an arm, and after many training sessions, and getting to like one another, she eventually makes the boys, not-so-hot football team...........and becomes the starting quarterback.

The story has the usual girl-hating etc, but they don't focus on it for too long and ruin the beauty of the movie.  Instead, the boys quickly become her ally,(she starts winning games!). It is really refreshing to see boys portrayed in a more realistic light.  I get very tired of boys and men constantly being depicted as insensitive buffoons, or violent sociopaths.  Most of the boys I know are sweet, sensitive, smart, kids, who might balk at a girl on their team, but I don't think so. Especially one as good a Jasmine!  The story shows how acting on a belief can change a life, a famiy, a football team, and a whole town.

It is a wonderful story for girls AND boys to see.  But it appeals to all because it is a well acted and written  story about love, committment, redemption, believing in possibilities, and yourself.",1270080000,3,2024,4.586111111111111
3558899,4,B001F0TM62,"Not to sound too cornball, I think we can never have enough of these warmhearted, inspirational movies and, in that vein, so what then if THE LONGSHOTS ends up mining sports cliches left and right? This film is aimed more for the kids, and the themes and messages imparted are those that never get old. Yes, the story is familiar. But it really happened.

Ever since the factory shut down, tiny Minden, Illinois has become a town in decline, crime and unemployment mounting even as prospects faded. But then a Pop Warner football team rolls along to pull the town together. The underdog Minden Browns, with its roster of inept kids, go from losers to contending in the Pop Warner superbowl game. And an 11-year-old girl quarterback got them there.

No one told shy middle-schooler Jasmine Plummer that just because she's a girl she couldn't play football. Jasmine was this introverted bookworm, pining for the no-good father who'd abandoned her and being endlessly tormented by her school mates. Jasmine's concerned mom convinces her brother-in-law Curtis to spend some time with her daughter, and never mind that Curtis is shiftless, unemployed, and always cuddling a football and a beer can in a paper bag, surely the calling card of the down-and-out. Curtis used to be a high school football phenom before he blew out his knee and, in hanging out with Jasmine, it turns out the thing that puts them on the same page is football, a game for which Jasmine shows a surprising knack. But can Jasmine compete with the boys and play in an organized youth football league?

Break out the checklist and start crossing stuff off. The struggling town in need of hope? Check. The loser team turning it around? Yep. The new kid having to prove herself? The dirtbag of a daddy coming back to eff things up? The broken down athlete who gets a shot a redemption? Yep, yep, and you betcha. But a couple of things save the film from being too schmaltzy. For one thing, the heartfelt emotion helps in overcoming the trite elements. The cinematography does a good job of conveying the drab grittiness of a struggling, poverty-stricken town. And Director Fred Durst (yes, from Limp Bizkit, that Fred Durst) keeps his actors on point. Ice Cube, baby. He's got presence, and I even think he can act. He certainly has an affinity for sports and for children. Still, I winced a bit when Cube unthinkingly rags on Keke's character: ""Now I'm stuck with you. That's 'cause your father didn't want to be."" That's just about meaner than any of his gangsta rap lyrics.

THE LONGSHOTS, both a drama and a comedy, is based on a true story, but with certain liberties taken, of course. Keke Palmer, so wonderful in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Akeelah-and-the-Bee-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000G1R394/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Akeelah and the Bee (Widescreen Edition)</a>, again turns in a very good, natural performance and she's always got that marvelously expressive face. But the thing that keeps me from entirely recommending this film is that I don't quite buy Keke Palmer as a quarterback, not with the way she moves and not with that weak throwing motion. The movie, with its camera angles and timely cut-aways, does cheat a little bit, and the camera doesn't always follow the flight of the ball directly from Keke's arm.

The DVD bonus features: the Making of THE LONGSHOTS; ""Jasmine Plummer: the Real Longshot""; 13 deleted scenes, the last one featuring more girls trying out for the team for the next season; the theatrical trailer; a conversation with Ice Cube; and a conversation with Director Fred Durst who comes across as someone who knows what he's doing with this directing gig. It's great seeing people shatter conventions and exceed expectations, it's one more theme in this movie. And to have rebel musicians Cube and Durst venturing into and doing well in another career, it's a pretty cool thing. 3.5 out of 5 stars for THE LONGSHOTS.",1265500800,,3971,5.001512859304085

3558903,3,B001F0TM62,"Longshots has a good story.  It also has terrific performances by both Ice Cube and Keke Palmer, which won't go unnoticed to the viewer.  The problem with the film is that it doesn't go deep enough to really tap into the emotional core of the film the way other sports films have done, such as ""Remember the Titans"" or ""Rudy.""  At an hour and a half, I feel that they could have added another 20-30 minutes to really make this movie fly.  The movie is still watchable, fun entertainment, for the most part.

Longshots is based on a true story of a young girl who wants to play football, and becomes the first girl to ever play in the Pop Warner Superbowl.  Jasmine Plummer lives with her mother.  Her father has left the family and is nowhere to be found.  She spends her spare time reading, and she's ridiculed by her classmates at school for always having her nose in a book.  Her one desire in life is to become a model.  Her mother has to take on extra hours at work, and so Jasmine is left with her unemployed uncle, Curtis.  At first, and a bit predictably, Jasmine and Curtis have a difficult time getting along, seeing that they don't have much in common.  Curtis doesn't go anywhere without his football, and Jasmine is the same way with her books.  When Curtis is playing catch with a friend, the ball lands at Jasmine's feet (yes, we've seen this formula a number of times), and Jasmine delivers a near-perfect pass.  Suddenly, it dawns on Curtis to help Jasmine develop her skills of becoming a quarterback that even she doesn't know she has.

Keke Palmer is one of today's best upcoming actresses.  She was fantastic in ""Akeelah and the Bee,"" and she matches Ice Cube in every scene.  Evidently, she trained very hard to be able to throw a football.  There is a hilarious scene when Jasmine is trying to put on all of her football equipment, and she lets out a piercing scream of disgust when she realizes she's holding a jock strap.

Ice Cube is equally good as her uncle, Curtis.  Curtis is a man who is feeling the pains of being stuck.  He feels that he should have left the little town they live in, which is all but dead due to the economy.  He spends his days hanging out at the field, and little else.  He wears the same clothes for days.  However, finding a companion in Jasmine, Curtis discovers that he now has something to do with his time that is worthwhile.

I would have loved to see more development between Jasmine and Curtis.  The story had something really special going on between these two characters, but there simply isn't enough time to devote to them, as the story shifts to Jasmine's football training, a few games, and then, of course, the championship game in Miami.

There are a couple of scenes when her father comes back.  I would have also liked to have seen this dynamic played out a bit more as well as the strained relationship between Jasmine's father and Curtis, who now bitterly resents his brother for abandoning Jasmine.  These three characters are really the most interesting in the film.  Even a budding romance between Curtis and Jasmine's teacher feels contrived and unreal.  It is also unnecessary.

The football scenes are fine, and they play themselves out in typical fashion.  There isn't anything we haven't already scene in other films, which is another reason why I feel that movie short-changed itself in the characterization and the relationships.  The heart of the movie seemed to lie there, so I was hoping for something deeper.

In any case, Longshots is a good film that can certainly be enjoyed by the whole family.  However, the movie could have been so much more than it ended up being.",1250294400,3,3659,4.566820276497696
