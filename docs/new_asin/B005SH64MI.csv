4884240,5,B005SH64MI,"I've seen ""The Lion of Judah"" several times and it makes me laugh and moves me to tears every time. It shows how love can conquer all, which rings very true for me.",1335225600,,164,4.0
4884241,4,B005SH64MI,"This movie was almost all about talking animals, which at first seemed very childish to me.  I confess that I was worried the kids wouldn't like it.  But by the end of the movie and the animals realized why Jesus died on the cross, even the teenagers were saying it was very good.  So I would recommend it for children...it gives several good Biblical points, as well as just general animal silliness.",1335052800,23,401,4.541666666666667

4884245,1,B005SH64MI,"I've been on the hunt for quality Christian films for my two year old to watch when she starts begging for the television.  Lately, we've been filling the screen with The Lion King and Land Before Time, and while I'm a fan of these, I would love to have something with a little more substance.  I recently found a few videos from the Greatest Heroes and Legends of the Bible series and was totally impressed.  Perhaps Christian movies have taken a turn for the better.

Apparently not all of them.

Lion of Judah starts with an exceedingly long credit list and goes downhill from there.  The actual movie opens with a bunch of barn animals who are dumb, scared, and generally a mess.  I thought my life was a disaster.  These animals have me beat, by a long shot.  They can't put two and two together and watching their day  unfold makes me want to hit my head against the wall.

Surely this will get better, right?

Not unless you're willing to hang on for a VERY LONG TIME.  Thirty-three minutes into the film, and the animals have made it Jerusalem, with no substantial dialogue taking place and barely one reference to anything scriptural.  In the streets of Jerusalem, the animals somehow get split up, and the horse ends up in an alley with a couple of mobster crows.  Seriously?  Is this supposed to be funny?  Dramatic?  Ugh.

There's some reference to animals coming down in a sheet (seems very out of context), some dreams, and I just can't take it anymore.  I skip to the next scene.

Fifty minutes into the movie and still nothing substantial has happened.  There's a few jokes.  Some references to the ""high calling of being a sacrificial animal"" and some very vague references to a king who will set people free.  There's a very brief flash back to the manger scene, but unless you're already very familiar with the Christmas story, it won't mean much.

An hour and 10 minutes into the thus far un-impressive film and you meet Jesus, the king.  He rides in a previously-hard-hearted donkey, flips some tables, and sets the animals free.  Oh, all except the little lamb Judah, who actually thinks he's a lion.  If you've stuck with the film this long, you're probably throughly confused, bored, or annoyed.  If you're a kid, you might still be hanging on, but I'm not sure there's any redeeming value to watching this film.

Anyway, Judah, the lamb is about to be sacrificed (could be a scary scene for little ones) when he is miraculously ""set free"" by the earthquake that occurs at Jesus' death.  You see Jesus on the cross, then taken down for burial, and then you wait with the animals for 3 days until he raises himself again, without much fanfare, I might add.  There's a touching scene with Jesus hugging the lamb and then little Judah trots home to mom.  More pointless dialogue.  End movie.

In conclusion, don't waste your time.  Or your kid's time.  Or your Children's Church time.  If you want to do a movie, grab some Greatest Heroes movies.",1333411200,18,2967,4.591603053435114

Loved the parallel of the lamb and Jesus and I can help make that connection and help to use this to further explain salvation to my 5 year old. There were some parts that could have been done better, I didn't care for the set of birds in the movie, but overall well done and cute movie for our family with a 3 & 5 year old to watch.",1497139200,,481,4.239130434782608

4884353,5,B005SH64MI,"This was really good... I'm not sure if I've seen many animated Christian related movies, but I really enjoyed this one. I thought the characters were great, as well as the animation. The only complaint I have, is that it seemed to drag on the last 30 minutes or so... this would be where they were looking for Jesus ""The King"", and after they had found him. You just sort of had these 'dead moments' in this part of the movie, with not much going on. I mean, with exception of the Lord going through what he was in the background of the movie. I mean, they sat outside the gate, then ran around some, then they sat over here, ran around some more, and over there, and finally at the tomb. I think they could have played this part out a whole lot better and filled in the gaps. I don't want to take away from the movie, because I did really enjoy it.",1496707200,,850,4.157575757575757

4884500,1,B005SH64MI,"I was hoping it would be a very good story about the sacrifice of the Savior; instead, it seemed to put down what many call ""jewish beliefs,"" though the same beliefs they seemed to put down are Biblically founded. I do not belief the sacrifice of the Messiah sought to do away with the commands He put in place, nor do I believe they are ""done away,"" as some people claim. The Messiah said He came to fulfill not to change or do away with. What is unclean is still unclean to Him. By the way, that is the example that Jesus--the Messiah--showed and lived. He lived out His law perfectly so that we can do the same.

If you are a Bible-believer, I would say this is not for you. I really did want it to be relevant and true, but I found that it was not. :-(",1436227200,10,756,4.073825503355705

The pig, as if we don't already know how dirty they can be, they do take it too far with passing gas and other and just being really foul - not necessary for the story. There are some funny parts especially with the horse.

The 3D is impressive, but does feel jerky at times, playing ""let's get dizzy"" with your eyes.  BUT it is not bad enough to cause me to not give it great recommendations.

This documentary fall short on many ways how the commentators vaguely response and tries hard to express feelings comparing to the present day situation with  the  each witnessing of the physical site of holocuast places and the monuments. If you want to understand the holocaust experience deeply in the context of human sufferings and hatred than this is not one of those documentary.....they are others out there and not necessarily it have to be a documentary always, some holocaust fiction movies does a better job.",1380412800,,741,5.166666666666667

The 2-year-old will normally sit through a movie but not this one. The story is great... it obviously takes some liberties with the true Bible story, but that's expected since they are talking animals and all. My kids love Bible stories, especially the 4-year-old and regarding the cross and resurrection.

I was thinking with the animation and somewhat recognizable voices, it would be an easy and enjoyable watch.  Unfortunately, that was not the case.  We did not make it halfway through the movie before we decided to turn it off.  Yes we are ""believers"" but this movie was not the right fit for my kids (12, 15) and I was just simply fooled into thinking since it was animated they would enjoy it like the other ones.

Solid message they are sharing, just at a very basic (maybe under 8 yrs old?) age group.",1364860800,,577,4.209090909090909

8484975,1,B005SH64MI,"A lie, however told, is still a lie. One and Three are not the same.
That God Almighty has offspring, and that too through the womb of a woman, is an abominable lie. How can you expect anyone, much less a child, to believe that God has a son who ate and drank (and evacuated the food and drink) and bled and was persecuted and then crucified and then resurrected? (This so called resurrection should not be confused with the Resurrection of every human, on the Day of Judgement). Did it occur to Paul that maybe Jesus did not get resurrected after dying on the cross? God Saved Jesus from going through the severe trial of being crucified.  Do Christians who believe in Trinity not know that according to the Bible the one who was crucified was deemed cursed, which is why the enemies of Jesus didn't simply kill him like they did John, but wanted to crucify him, so that what he said about God and Gods Law, was discredited? Jesus was 100% a human and Gods Word and Gods creation and the birth of Jesus was a miracle and a sign from God Almighty. Jesus mother also was human and chaste all her life. We know that God Created Adam without a father or mother. At least Jesus had a mother. Jesus came with many miracles of God and signs of God. God sent the angel Gabriel (The Holy Spirit) to aid Jesus. Belief in God having any offspring or parent(s) or anyone being equivalent to or having partnership with God is an example of the very polytheism that Jesus came to steer the lost sheep of Israel away from. (Israel was Gods Prophet and the father of the Jews/Israelites). Sadly its ironic. But how weak is Satans plot that it falls apart with a little thinking and Gods Guidance! God Guides whomever He Wills. May God Guide us to true monotheism and the straight and narrow. Let us please be true to ourselves in front of God, who is the only one All Seeing and All Hearing, speak the truth at least about God and His messengers from among the angels and men. All Glory is to God the One and only One God.",1528416000,,2007,4.323607427055703

8484979,2,B005SH64MI,"Cute with the animals, and the basis that Yahushua took the little lambs place; but it was not based upon Yahushua/Jesus or much of an allegory to our Messiah. The basis of storyline they were throwing in and at end was that all unclean food became clean. This is NOT Biblical/scriptural of YHWH. Isaiah 65;66; Psalm 55; Malachi (YAH doesn't change); Leviticus; Matthew 5- Yahushua did not come to abolish the law but fulfill it. Disappointing and more replacement theology likely. I would not want to show this to kids as the teaching is scripturally wrong. I would have to then teach them the parts of the movie that are incorrect. Too bad.
