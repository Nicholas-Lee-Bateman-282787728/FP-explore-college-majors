5943366,5,B00ETHN9L2,"First I will give the bad experience I had with trying to obtain this product. I had been dying (pun intended) for a really good Friday the 13th documentary since it is my favorite horror series, and admittedly I was underwhelmed by the ""His Name Was Jason"" feature that glossed over all of the films rather quickly. So, when I heard that the makers of the superb ""Never Sleep Again"" documentary that went in depth with the ''A Nightmare on Elm Street"" series was making one about our favorite Hockey pucked freak, I got very excited. I ordered the Blu ray/DVD combo on the makers' website on Friday, September 13th, it's release date and I found out it would take weeks to get my delivery. To add insult to injury, the site seemed like it didn't want to release it to other retailers as all video stores in my area had it on back order, and even Amazon took a while getting it. So I cancelled my order, and placed one on Amazon, I got it a week later (today actually)and since I got it from Amazon, it didn't come with the bonus disc that's exclusive to the website. It will be the last time I order directly from that site.

Anyway, on to good news, this documentary is everything a Friday fan can ask for and more. It's seven hours long, roughly, and gives a VERY indepth look at all the Friday films as well as any other things associated with the series (such as the tv show). It is chalked full of actors, directors, producers and special effects men and women giving their experiences working on the franchise, and shows the ins and outs of making the films. The main feature is broken up on two Blu ray discs, and if you don't have a Blu ray player, it also comes with two regular DVDs to make everyone happy. I highly recommend this product!!",1379721600,3,1751,4.371165644171779
5943367,4,B00ETHN9L2,"I pre-ordered directly from the Crystal Lake Memories website and received the bonus DVD. Overall the documentary covers a lot of  ground in a very orderly fashion. Part 1 covers the first movie, Part 2 covers the 2nd movie and so on. There seemed to be some audio issues on the first DVD. It seemed muffled or perhaps the audio was too compressed. I couldn't quite figure it out. It almost seemed like it was in mono. But it seemed to have cleared up by Part 3 or I finally adjusted to it. But it it really took me out of the experience for the first 40 minutes or so. I was a bit unenthused until Part 4. It could have been the audio up until then, but I was also getting a lot of deja vu moments. I realized at moments that I had seen a few of these interviews before in the mini documentary, ""His Name Was Jason"". And that's fine. Because this feels a lot more complete and thorough than the DVD of ""His Name Was Jason"". And the interview footage works here and doesn't seem too far out of place from the newer interviews shot for this documentary. There are some fun interviews. Some will have you laughing. There was one star that seemed to still have a chip on their shoulder about their experience after all this time. But almost everyone reflected upon their Friday the 13th filming experience with happy nostalgia. Corey Feldman was a nice choice for the narration of the documentary. He does a decent job of it. Overall it is a nice documentary of the Friday The 13th movies and the television series.",1379462400,7,1512,4.361702127659575
5943368,5,B00ETHN9L2,Just binge-watched the entire almost 7 hour documentary and loved it! Truly does the series justice and really appreciate the time and effort that went into it. Make sure to buy it from crystallakememories.net to get the 5th bonus disk (4+ hours of extra content) as it's absolutely worth it.,1379376000,4,292,4.86
5943369,4,B00ETHN9L2,"I really did enjoy this. It will please all Jason fans. But one thing that I didn't like was that alot of the actors & crew being interviewed pretty much re-told the same on set stories that we already heard on the deluxe edition films special features. I was hoping for more new stories about the films. I guess it's hard to remember events 25 to 30 years ago. But still does come with newly interviewed cast members like Jennifer Cooke, Rebecca Sharkey, ect. that I was excited to see. Overall, still a worthy 6 hour watch!",1379376000,8,525,4.422680412371134
5943370,5,B00ETHN9L2,"What else would you expect from the team who brought you 'Never Sleep Again: The Elm Street Legacy'????  Well worth the money!  And if you buy from crystallakememories.net you get a bonus disc with OVER FOUR HOURS of extended interviews that you can't get anywhere else!!!

And really great stuff on 'Friday the 13th: A New Beginning', which is easily the best out of the entire series (beating 'The Final Chapter' only by a smidge).  Buy a couple boxes of candy bars and enjoy this beast of a documentary!",1379289600,7,506,4.651685393258427
5943371,5,B00ETHN9L2,"There is, in fact, a 5th disc that is ONLY available when directly ordered through 1428 Films. So there shouldn't be any confusion here. You don't get the 5th disc with the bonus interviews unless ordering directly from 1428 Films.",1379289600,31,231,4.8
5943372,5,B00ETHN9L2,"In the 33 years since the original FRIDAY THE 13TH premiered in May of 1980, the slasher franchise has grown to include twelve feature films, a television series, novels, comic books, merchandise and memorabilia. In addition to staggering box office success, the films turned Jason Voorhees and his signature hockey mask into a pop culture icon. Now fans can get an in-depth look that spans the entire history from those involved

If you are a Diehard fan of Friday the 13th than you must get this Blu-Ray!",1379289600,5,506,4.816091954022989
5943373,5,B00ETHN9L2,"Spoke to the site about the confusion with  regards to the bonus dvd and here is the reply.

The full set contains the entire 400 minute documentary on two Blu-rays and two DVDs.  You will not receive the bonus fifth DVD through Amazon or any other online retailer.

Hope this helps everyone.",1379203200,3,292,4.5576923076923075
5943374,5,B00ETHN9L2,"I hope the other reviewer is right and the bonus dvd is included in this set cause i have already pre-order mine directly from the franchise's site and there it said u get this bonus dvd EXCLUSIVELY from that site only.
 After a while the dvd set will be available at other sites (amazon) but without that bonus dvd.
 So i don't know if this dvd is here also as the other reviewer claimed or not.
 i just warned thee....

 Anyways this looks much greater f13 doc than ""his name is jason"" which cover really everything there is to cover about the F13 franchise.
 I'm still not sure if it contains the two alice cooper ""jason lives"" videos due to rights issues but i'm certain it contains everything else but i really wish they had included at least ""the man behind the mask"" video which is GREAT....
 This was the first slasher franchise which did it with so much purity and spawned 10 sequels, a remake and 3 spin off television seasons series all of which is here to find.
 I really wish for a fresh new series as the old ended permanently with Jason X and the remake was more like a tribute to first 4 original F13 films rather than been a ""remake"".
 I wish a new series from the beginning maybe a prequel showing what happened between 1957 when jason drowned at the lake and 1980 when we had the events of the first original movie and maybe we can see finally elias, jason's dad and his relationship with pamela....etc....in an old school manner and of course a great new jason voorhess and his new bloody rampage with his glorious machette.

 Friday the 13th franchise was so popular thru the ages cause it had this right combination of gore, a faceless killer, axceptable plot and that great dark-horror old school atmosphere full of thunder and rain which made u chill every time u watched those films.
 Until we get a new generation of f13 films sit and enjoy this complete f13 new documentairy.",1378080000,3,1902,4.465317919075145
5943375,5,B00ETHN9L2,"This 4-disc (2 BD & 2 DVD) combo pack showcases the extensive retrospective F13 documentary which runs almost 7 hours (400 minutes). It is almost 3 hours longer than Never Sleep Again (of course there are more films in the F13 franchise). Corey Feldman (star of Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter) narrates Crystal Lake Memories, which features interviews with approximately 150 cast and crew members from all twelve Friday the 13th films and the syndicated television series, many of whom have never before appeared in on-camera interviews. Interview subjects include Kane Hodder, Robert Englund, Tom Savini, Danielle Panabaker, Sean S. Cunningham, Derek Mears, Betsy Palmer, Wes Craven, Robert Shaye, Alice Cooper and many more. Crystal Lake Memories is written and directed by Daniel Farrands and produced by Thommy Hutson (Never Sleep Again: The Elm Street Legacy). The focus is mainly on the films. Merchandise such as novels, comic books, and memorabilia don't play a large role. There are some bonus features like the Filmmaker Commentary and Trailers (English and Spanish Subtitles are also provided). The film runs in chronological order from the original F13 to the reboot with each film getting roughly 35 minutes of treatment. The TV series gets 10 minutes of coverage. At the end of each chapter there is a brief memorial for the people who have since passed away (there are more than I expected). The score and music are so much better than His Name Was Jason but the official Harry Manfredini track is not used. Notably, Manfredini blends his F13 score with music from Halloween and Psycho 2. Corey Feldman introduces and concludes the documentary. Feldman was the biggest draw for the documentary and does well in interviews and as a narrator. Some of the cast do their famous lines during the end credits (the Farrands touch) which is always funny. Darcy DeMoss is the best, the best! :-) Disc One contains Chapters 1-6 + TV Series. Disc Two contains chapters 7-12 + Retrospective. Buy this excellent documentary on the Friday the 13th film franchise! Most F13 fans consider this a must-own because it really should have been included in the F13 Blu-ray collection. It is much more comprehensive than His Name Was Jason and Seth Green does not show up to plug Robot Chicken. Jason fans will love this in-depth retrospective which is the ""Never Sleep Again"" for the F13 franchise.

Comparisons:
[Book] The CLM book is one of the best resources ever created for a horror fan. It is divided into 12 chapters (the 12th chapter includes a collection of quotes from people in the entire film franchise) but it does not discuss the reboot. However, the documentary is 13 chapters and includes discussion on the reboot. Essentially, the film follows the format of the book fairly closely. It is more positive and less critical. Not all of the people in the book get an interview in the documentary. Many stories about wild parties, religious objections, and accidents during filming are not included.
[Never Sleep Again] It is almost but not quite as good as Never Sleep Again. Perhaps because ANOES (still) doesn't have a great book that documentary blew me away. CLM is much longer but fans will know many of the stories already. Since there are many more interview subjects it seems few people really get the time to tell their story. Never Sleep Again seemed more complete and almost everyone was immediately recognizable. A New Beginning, Jason X, Freddy vs. Jason and the reboot get bashed (though many fans won't mind). The attitude towards Freddy vs. Jason is less complimentary than Never Sleep Again (many fans see it more as a Freddy movie but some don't like it at all). Some of the biggest stars aren't interviewed but Never Sleep Again also missed their biggest stars (Depp, Arquette, Wasson, Fishburne, Gregg and others) so it is understandable that they are simply too expensive to be included.
[His Name Was Jason] You can toss HNWJ because it has been squeezed like an orange. All the good stuff is in CLM. CLM takes the franchise more seriously and is much more complete. Everything from the old documentary except the fan cameos, Seth Green and some jokes have been spliced into CLM.

Pros:
The leads from the films which had a great impact on the franchise are interviewed: Adrienne King, Betsy Palmer, Amy Steel, Dana Kimmell, Corey Feldman, Kimberly Beck, John Shepherd, Thom Matthews, John D. LeMay, Lar Park Lincoln, Jensen Daggett, Erin Gray, Kane Hodder, Robert Englund, and Derek Mears.
Deleted scenes, chopped scenes, outtakes, merchandise, posters, a music video and other alternate shots are shown throughout the documentary.
Plenty of interesting new material for The Final Chapter, A New Beginning, Jason Lives, Freddy vs. Jason and the reboot.
Jason Lives has the most interviews (and Alice Cooper music video clips!) with only Tony Goldwyn, Ron Palillo, Kerry Noonan, Joseph T. Garrity, and Jon Kranhouse absent.
All the Jasons and Tommys are interviewed. Almost all of the directors, writers, final girls and leading men are interviewed.
The new interview with Frank Mancuso Jr. is candid and interesting. One of the better and more lengthy interviews.
The new interview with Corey Feldman finally shows the fans one of its most passionate supporters on film. The biggest star interviewed in CLM.
The new interview with Ken Kirzinger is cool. He talks about how the director had a completely different idea for Jason.
The new interview with Melanie Kinnaman takes a turn. It's possibly the least flattering segment but she did take some abuse.
The new interview with Jennifer Cooke shows a game actress.
The new interview with Mark Swift & Damian Shannon sheds more light on Freddy vs. Jason and the reboot.
The new interview with Derek Mears shows a passionate fan behind the mask.
Some eye-opening new interviews with Dana Kimmell, Thom Matthews, Sean Cunningham, Harry Manfredini, Tom & Nancy McLoughlin, Camilla & Carey More, Sharlene Martin, Julie Michaels, Rebecca Sharkey, Lee Coleman (the former lead of Jason Takes Manhattan), Steve Monarque (F13 TV Series Season 3), Monica Keena and others.

Cons:
Missing from Doc & Book: Bruce Mahler, Tony Goldwyn, Terry Kiser, Scott Reeves and others.
Missing from Doc: Steve Miner | Kevin Bacon, Cliff Cudney, Crispin Glover, Peter Barton, Tiffany Helm, Kerry Noonan, Jeff Bennett, Kari Keegan, Jonathan Potts and others.
Not everyone from the franchise is interviewed (at least 25 cast and many more crew) and may never be interviewed. Most are shown in archival footage.
Borrowed and extended interviews from His Name Was Jason, Never Sleep Again and previous F13 bonus content has been spliced into CLM.
Director Steve Miner's absence is really felt because there aren't many new stories for the first three films which are fan favorites.
JGTH is perhaps the most disappointing segment with few interviews. Adam Marcus is clueless and John D. LeMay looks bored.

Future: Since there are still reams of footage that has never been released for Part 7, 8 and 9 that could make a future documentary. Just about all the major stories for the first six films have been told but there are still plenty of Jason's victims and F13 crew to interview. Paying for an interview with Steve Miner and big celebrities like Kevin Bacon would be great but perhaps a pipe dream. There is also plenty to talk about script-wise especially in regards to the Freddy vs. Jason development hell. It would be great to get a quote or interview out of Kiser and Reeves because they both played lead roles (New Blood & Jason Takes Manhattan).

* A bonus DVD with extended interview material from cast and crew was available on launch directly from the distributor. That DVD is no longer available. It contained some cut interview footage that didn't make it into this documentary but it's fairly rough (and unfinished) material.",1377993600,48,7897,4.9977203647416415

5943393,5,B00ETHN9L2,"Finally a fitting documentary for the iconic Friday the 13th film franchise. Like a large number of other fans I was disappointed with the ""His Name Was Jason"" documentary. It seemed hastily put together and could've included so much more information. Crystal Lake Memories corrects all that by giving you a chronological inside view of the series from conception to production. They do reuse a decent amount of footage from ""His Name was..."", but it's tastefully intertwined with newer and extended interviews and a lot of behind the scenes photos and film. Narrated this time by Corey Feldman it seems that Tommy Jarvis from Part 4 is actually a good choice as a host for the following in depth look at the first and original ""blood for the sake of blood"" slasher films. I'll spare anyone reading this the highlights and details of the documentary.

Each film is given plenty it's own Chapter, where the cast and crew discuss the good, the bad and the ugly of making their ""Friday"" installment.

5943425,5,B00ETHN9L2,"An incredibly in-depth documentary on the making of the 12 Friday films, and the tv series.  I am a huge fan of the movie franchise, and thought that the documentary ""His Name was Jason"" was the end all be all of the franchise documentaries. I got this 2/2+1 set as a gift, and just absolutely love it!!!  Nearly 7 hours of footage chronicles the journeys from the original film, Friday the 13th all the way to the 2009 re-boot.

  This set has something for everyone and presents it in a really high quality fashion in my opinion.  The films are broken up into well organized chapters each film gets its own roughly 30 mins of interviews from actors, directors, editors, etc. along with deleted scenes, and stories of cast and crew about what it was like to do the shoot.  Some of them are well known, and some of them are fresh and new, at least to me.

  I really cannot say enough good things about this film.  If you are a fan of the film, and you are the fence don't be.  I am sure that any fan would find this movie incredibly satisfying and rewarding. Everyone has their favorite film, favorite director, and of course favorite actor who portrayed Jason and I'm sure that we could debate the merits of each until the end of time.  I spent two days watching it, and it took me back to fond memories of summer vacations, and the forbidden thrill of being able to steal away and watch these highly entertaining, and sometimes controversial films. A truly enjoyable experience even if not everyone understands our passion for this franchise.",1404518400,3,1545,4.514388489208633

5943427,5,B00ETHN9L2,"I love how they go in order from the 1st film to the last. It's such a nice progression to see how the movies came about and why choices were made. And believe me, they speak of everything. I'm about half way through the doc but can definitely give Crystal Lake a high rank. I'm not a full-on die hard Jason junkie either, but this is a craftedly put together film and fun to watch. The other reviewer is spot on, the 7 hours flies by. It's very refreshing to see cast & crew speak honestly about the films, good & bad. It's so annoying listening to a director/cast who are in denial about a film they made that fell short. Just be honest. And it's cool to see Corey Feldman join the mix and narrate the history of the franchise. I also suggest the Nightmare on Elm Street documentary which was made by the same company.",1402876800,4,820,4.229299363057325
5943428,5,B00ETHN9L2,"Believe it not this is a quick 7 hour documentary. It is funny and informative and far superior to the previous behind the scenes documentaries. Having read the book of the same name that it borrows its structure from, I did noticed that it is glosses over some of the disagreements among the creators brought up in the book, Instead pushing forward a unified, almost feel good vibe. Covers every incarnation of the franchise including the loosely related television series and frequently contrasts it to its contemporary horror films, specifically the ""Elm Street"" series. But make no mistake, it stays firmly on ""Team Jason"" A must for any fan of the series. This video is comprehensive and visually interesting as it moves through all incarnations of the franchise. Interviews by nearly all of the talented people behind the films. Stays positive and avoids any of the arguments presented in the book of the same name. It is easily superior to the previous ""His name was Jason"" in that it is more comprehensive and removes the fan interviews to concentrate solely on the people who worked on the movies.",1402790400,7,1106,4.888297872340425

Although there are some small recycled scenes from the director's previous doc 'His Name Was Jason', it still provides some added information that is gladly welcome here.

My base instincts tell me how terrible this movie series and it's the same thing through every movie without a cohesive narrative. However, I was always drawn to the simplicity of the films and the mystique (for lack of a better word) of Jason Voorhees. For whatever reason, he just make for an interesting villain...that you can't help but root for. After watching this fantastic documentary and hearing the stories behind the movies, you understand more than ever that you are having fun because the people behind them are too. They know what these movies are but its ok because they are what they're supposed to be. I'd love to see Jason Voorhees again soon, just as he is and nothing more.",1395878400,,784,4.451388888888889

5943442,5,B00ETHN9L2,"Every wonder just where Friday the 13th came from? Did you ponder just how Jason became a household name and why the filmmakers chose a hockey mask? Look no further than this 6 hour 40 minute documentary that leaves no stone unturned. Taking a cue from ""Never Sleep Again"" this exhaustive documentary explores all twelve films and even the television series. Writer/director Daniel Farrands (who co-directed Never Sleep Again with Andrew Kasch) does a phenomenal job of bringing Peter M. Bracke's coffee table book to life with more than 150 interviews with casts and crews that worked on each film. Some might be turned off by more than seven hours of ""talking heads,"" but don't let that deter you. Everyone has some interesting things to say. The film never feels long nor boring. In fact, by the end I was a little taken aback that the time flew by so quickly.

If you've ever seen the previous doc, ""His Name Was Jason,"" you'll get a few of the same stories, and even some footage cut in, but ultimately coupled with that film you really have absolutely everything you'll ever want or need to know about the undying franchise. I feel bad for the next who comes along wanting to do a documentary of these films as there's nothing really left to discover.

What's also great is the clever use of footage from the films, especially rare behind-the-scenes footage and even some of the infamous deleted gore scenes as the mercy of the MPAA. If you're a fan then don't pass this up. It is worth every penny.

Sadly, I was too late to the game to get the third disc with 4+hours of interviews cut from the main feature. Both the book and this great film sit proudly on my shelf ready to be experienced again and again.",1393977600,,1715,4.561688311688312

I'll keep it short.

This was so fun to watch and you never even notice how long it is(400 mins). Between the history of each film and the stories and interviews of cast members It's safe to say the documentary surpasses even some of the films( insert Jason Goes to Hell and Jason X). If your a fan and are even a bit curious, BUY THIS. I will be watching this again and making sure it gets loaned out as much as possible.

No. But every one does hold some significance to me with growing up.  And because of that, getting a behind the scenes look at every movie is like traveling back in time through my life.  Although there are a few people missing from the series, it doesn't do anything to lessen the 5 out 5 I gave this. If you're a Friday The 13th fan at all this is a must own.  7 hours and none of it feels wasted.

5943457,4,B00ETHN9L2,"...I would have absolutely loved this look at the series. I've read the other reviews and I get why people didn't like HNWJ. I  didn't like all the fanboys and meaningless interviews about the movies. Memories does a nice job of cutting all the fat and just getting down to the brass tax of the interviews.  The first four are my favorite and those were the ones I was most excited to see. The problem is that 50% of the interviews in memories (especially from the earlier films) come from HNWJ. As far for the other 50%, they are all new with actors from the franchise that you wouldn't expect to see. No, no really big names, but they are interesting. As we get into the later films, there are more varieties of interviews, and tidbits that are interesting.

I'm not faulting the makers of Crystal Lake Memories because I'm sure that it was tough to find the people to talk about the earlier offering in the series, (a lot of them seemed to have passed judging from all the ""In Memory of..."" from Memories), just be prepared for what you're getting. If you like the later films, you'll love it. If you're a diehard ""First Four"" fan, it might not be worth your money.

So all in all, I did enjoy watching it, but a lot of it I had already seen. And, many of the new interviews are rehashes of what I've heard before. I wish I would have ordered it from the actually website to get that bonus disc. I think the extra money would be worth it, especially for all the unused interview footage.",1390608000,,1490,4.348920863309353

5943459,5,B00ETHN9L2,"Inspired by the critically-acclaimed book, Crystal Lake Memories: The Complete History of Friday the 13th takes viewers behind the mask on an epic journey into the making of the landmark horror franchise-from its humble beginnings in 1980 at a New Jersey summer camp to the blockbuster release of its 2009 ""reboot."" Combining hundreds of rare and never-before-seen photographs, film clips, outtakes, archival documents, conceptual art and behind-the-scenes footage, and featuring interviews with more than 150 cast and crew members spanning all twelve films and the television series, Crystal Lake Memories is the ultimate tribute to one of horror's most iconic and enduring franchises.

Corey Feldman (star of Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter) narrates Crystal Lake Memories, which features interviews with approximately 150 cast and crew members from all twelve Friday the 13th films and the syndicated television series, many of whom have never before appeared in on-camera interviews. Interview subjects include Kane Hodder, Robert Englund, Tom Savini, Danielle Panabaker, Sean S. Cunningham, Derek Mears, Betsy Palmer, Wes Craven, Robert Shaye, Alice Cooper and many more.

Crystal Lake Memories is written and directed by Daniel Farrands and produced by Thommy Hutson, who previously teamed up for the award-winning Never Sleep Again: The Elm Street Legacy.

""As lifelong fans, we couldn't let 2013 pass us by without giving Jason his due,"" explains Farrands. ""I hope that Crystal Lake Memories will serve as a fitting tribute to one of this generation's most iconic bogeymen.""

""We're thrilled that we are able to bring all the incredible stories from the cast and crew to life, showcasing why the Friday the 13th franchise is still going strong decades later,"" adds Hutson. ""It's a testament to the blood, sweat and tears that went into making summer camp, and eventually a hockey mask, both terrifying and fun.""

In the 33 years since the original Friday the 13th premiered in May of 1980, the slasher franchise has grown to include twelve feature films, a television series, novels, comic books, merchandise and memorabilia. In addition to staggering box office success, the films turned Jason Voorhees and his signature hockey mask into a pop culture icon. Now fans can get an in-depth look that spans the entire history from those involved.

I've watched several documentaries on Friday the 13th -- and this is the best one. They managed to get actors that I had never seen before and I liked how honest everyone was. I especially liked the guy who played Jason in the fourth movie talking about how much he hated Corey Feldman (even though he was a child at the time).

I really enjoyed the interviews with the cast members and directors.  They even go back to some of the original locations where they filmed and show you what they look like today.

i love the Nightmare movies more cause the later Friday the 13th sequels got really Ridiculous and pointless
the producers were just recycling the same plot over and over again just to try and make more money really

But If you love the Never sleep again Documentary about the Nightmare on elm st film series
than you'll Definitely love this Crystal lake memories Documentary
even thou i'm not a big fan of every friday the 13th film cause the sequels did get pointless after
FRIDAY THE 13TH FINAL CHAPTER, paramount just wanted to make some more money really
that was the only reason to continue the sequels

i bought the Crystal lake memories Documentary anyway just to check it our really and it's definitely worth the cash
the same writer and Director from the Never sleep again Documentary
made this Crystal lake memories Documentary.
the Documentary is spread on 2 Blu-ray's and 2 DVD'S so for fans who don't have a blu-ray player
just watch the 2 DVD'S all Discs are ALL REGIONS
each Friday the 13th movie has their own making of Documentary
it's directed the same way as Never sleep again
the original 1980 classic  has a more detailed Documentary about 45mins of very indepth cast and crew interviews
with everyone from the film except for Kevin bacon who was not available to be interviewed
and the rest of the sequels each have about 30-40mins Documentary each
for the rest of the sequels, this is the first time all 12 films have been given a Documentary
friday the 13th 1-6 is on Disc 1 the rest of the sequels are on Disc 2
each film has been explained in detail right to the Friday the 13th remake
which i didn't bother watching cause i thought the remake was an insult.

over 150 cast and crew members were interviewed but not all actors from the series were interviewed
unfortunately some of the cast/crew have now past away or did not want to be interviewed
Kevin bacon, Steve miner and Crispin Glover are among some of the cast/crew
that did not want to be interviewed or were not available, it's anybody's guess what the reason was.
the Director from Friday the 13th new beginning past away after this doco was made
and Jennifer susan sullivan from Friday the 13th New blood also past away.

apart from that, the Documentary is still fantastic just as Good as Never sleep again Documentary
about the extras, very limited extras
there's Directors Audio commentary, i think there's trailer and stills Gallery
there are no Extended interviews
Never sleep again had Extended interviews but not this Documentary

this Documentary definitely is the complete History of Friday the 13th film series

5943478,4,B00ETHN9L2,"Though not as epic as the Never Sleep Again Elm Street documentary, it is certainly the best we will ever see about the Friday films. A small amount of the footage is from the older ""His Name Is Jason"" doc, but the majority is new.  It's really great to see the actors especially today (some of them have held up incredibly well, particularly the men who are mostly still smokin' handsome) and to hear more of the stories combined with footage from the films (unlike Never Sleep, there is a lot more footage from the films themselves to reenforce the interviews).  If you've read the associated book there may not be a ton of new material, but it's very much a worthy purchase and simply the best doc that will ever be made about the series.  It's an excellent companion to the recent Blu-ray box set of the films.",1384560000,,814,4.449664429530201

5943480,5,B00ETHN9L2,"Through the three discs, this is an 11 hour documentary.  You will literally learn EVERYTHING about the Friday series through this.  I own the book this was based off of and still learned so much from this documentary.  I was fortunate enough to have this signed by 25 of the people throughout the series so this is beyond a staple of my collection.  The actual documentary is hosted by probably the coolest person on Earth, Corey Feldman.  Almost everyone involved in this series makes an appearance.  However, it did have some sad moments.  I knew that the director of Part 5 passed away, but did not know that Richard Brooker (Jason from 3) and the director from Jason X passed away.  It made me incredibly sad but also makes me respect their work more, especially Jason X which is towards the bottom of my list of favorite Fridays.  The documentary shares behind the scenes stories, box office success stories and shows how close this series came to not existing at all.  ANY horror fan and ANY slasher  movie fan need to pick this up.  If you get one without the bonus disc, you still have a  2 disc 7 hour documentary.  Highly recommended!",1383609600,6,1145,4.5763546798029555
5943481,5,B00ETHN9L2,"As a horror film fan, the Friday the 13th films have always been a source of fun to me. Just a bunch of mindless fun movies about undead serial killer Jason Voorhees and his endless stalking/killing of sex starved, nubile teenagers at Camp Crystal Lake. No wonder he's a legend among the slasher film crowd. I bought the 90 minute documentary HIS NAME WAS JASON a few years ago, and although I enjoyed it, I ws excited to hear about this 7 hour doc that FULLY explored the entire legend of the character and the behind the scenes making of all 12 Friday the 13th movies (though I consider the 2009 remake an inferior joke). Even the fun late 80s syndicated tv series (which was about cursed antiques) is profiled. Much like the equally excellent Nightmare on Elm St documentary NEVER SLEEP AGAIN, This is a great film for both horror fans and students of low budget film making.",1383264000,,878,4.528301886792453
5943482,5,B00ETHN9L2,"I've mentioned before that I'm a big fan of special features and behind-the-scenes documentaries.  For this reason, I therefore loved films like NEVER SLEEP AGAIN: THE ELM STREET LEGACY and MORE BRAINS!: A RETURN TO THE LIVING DEAD.  The fine folks at 1428 Films and CAV Distributing have released yet another film documentary that every horror fan will want to own--CRYSTAL LAKE MEMORIES: THE COMPLETE HISTORY OF FRIDAY THE 13TH.  This definitive look at one of horror's most iconic series is a real treat for anyone that has seen or even heard of Jason Voorhees.

I cannot begin to tell you how exhaustive this documentary is.  The run-time clocks in at over 400 minutes, which is 6+ hours long!  But it's worth every minute.  I sat and watched this film through in a single day, pausing only a couple of times when needed.  It is simply THAT enthralling.

CRYSTAL LAKE MEMORIES is shot well and is presented nicely onscreen.  The format for the documentary is superb, combining cast and crew interviews with screenshots from the films as well as snapshots taken during production.  It is truly a real treat to see the cast now that they are older, and it's fascinating to hear their insights into the productions themselves.

I say `productions' because this film chronicles ALL of the films, not just the first one.  It also includes non-traditional aspects of the series as well, such as FREDDY VS. JASON and the reboot produced by Michael Bay in 2009.  Basically, as you can see, this documentary covers almost every aspect of the Friday the 13th franchise.

CRYSTAL LAKE MEMORIES is an excellent film and it is one that every single horror fan must own.  If you don't like behind-the-scenes footage, it won't matter...there's something for everyone here in this flick.  I highly recommend this one and suggest you check it out soon!  Just make sure to clear your calendar for a few hours so you can enjoy this with no interruptions.",1383264000,,1939,4.806646525679758

5943485,5,B00ETHN9L2,I love the fact that Hollywood is finally acknowledging this franchise after so many years of really poor releases. Growing up I knew that one day they would come to there senses and make a proper documentary about all 12 films (up to Jason X at the time I was growing up). This is a terrific insight on the most iconic horror character to ever splatter the screen with blood. Great buy. Great purchase. It's a 100% all the way.,1382745600,,428,4.3625

5943488,5,B00ETHN9L2,"I have seen both His Name Was Jason and Crystal Lake Memories. HNWJ was very lackluster and disappointing. It was rushed, not very thorough and it involved a lot of people not directly associated with the franchise just giving their two cents on Jason and the pop culture phenomenon of it all (resembling something of a VH1 or E! countdown list). CLM is a more detailed and insightful retrospective from the people who made these films (cast and crew) and their own personal experiences. Yes, some interviews are recycled but others are new and fresh and it all comes full circle into one definitive awesome documentary. There were a lot of old photos during filming that popped up that made it more sentimental.

New interviews I appreciated that haven't surfaced before were from leading ladies Dana Kimmell (Chris, F13 III), Jennifer Cooke (Megan, F13 VI) and Melanie Kinnaman (Pam, F13 V).

Other notable interviews include Frank Mancuso Jr. (Producer) Thom Mathews (Tommy, F13 VI), Carol Locatell (Ethel, F13 V), Ron Sloan (Junior, F13 V), Joan Freeman (Mrs. Jarvis, F13 Final Chapter), Tracie Savage (Debbie, F13 III), Jeannine Taylor (Marcie, F13) Susan Blu (Mrs. Shepard, F13 VII) and Sharlene Martin (Tamara, F13 VIII).

I believe older (although still recent) interview clips were pulled for Adrienne King (Alice, F13), Betsy Palmer (Mrs. Voorhees, F13), Amy Steel (Ginny, F13 II), Kimberly Beck (Trish, F13 Final Chapter), Lar Park Lincoln (Tina, F13 VII) and Jensen Daggett (Rennie, F13 VIII). So for fans of the ladies like myself, all leading women of the first 8 films are present.

Corey Feldman appropriately narrates. Steve Miner (director of F13 II & III) is absent.

There were also mentions of those who have past. Sad to hear about Susan Jennifer Sullivan (Melissa, F13 VII).

My only gripe is I wish the actors had spoken of what they are up to today after their Friday the 13th success. Are they still acting? Do they have different careers?

Also, I could have done without Jeff Katz (former New Line exec). He is very loud and obnoxious and doesn't really add anything special to the mix.

Very cool ending with the cast reciting lines from their roles. I got this for the first 8 films alone and skipped over Jason X, Freddy vs. Jason and the reboot which to me are the worst. Jason Goes to Hell is a mixed bag with fans, but I liked it.",1382486400,4,2364,4.805418719211823

5943491,3,B00ETHN9L2,"Ok, for what its worth this is a split review. If you don't own HIS NAME WAS JASON, then this is a great buy for the price. Covers each film in great detail with plenty of interviews from pretty much everyone whos worth listening to. If you Already own HIS NAME WAS JASON than don't waste your money, this has a few more interviews but its lot of the interviews from HIS NAME WAS JASON.

Watching it I kinda felt cheated because I already have these interviews on dvd and the new interviews really didn't add much. I also got the bonus dvd from the offical release website and its not worth the extra money. Its a lot of rambling that plays more like Deleted scenes from a friday the 13th film. They weren't added for a reason.

I gave it 3 stars because its a great release by itself but in the end JASON WAS HIS NAME did it better in my opinion. This release has more interviews but really didn't add anything to it with the new interviews.

Pros
+Even without Bonus dvd, its like 7 hours long of interviews
+Cool cover art

Cons
-No extras
-Re Used Interviews from another release
-Bonus dvd is a waste of money

In my opinion its real simple. Buy it only if you don't already own HIS NAME WAS JASON. And even if you don't already own it I pefer His Name Was Jason over Crystal Lake Memories.",1381795200,6,1295,4.22672064777328

5943501,3,B00ETHN9L2,"There are lots of recycled interviews from the old special features spliced in where needed. If you look closely, you can see where the interviewee's hair, clothes or age suddenly change back and forth. Take Tom McLoughlin's interview as an example. In fact, there are whole segments that were just recycled from old material, instead of filmed fresh. It just gets restructured into a more complete timeline.

If you buy this from 1428 Films, not only is the disc $5 more, but you also have to pay shipping. If you have a Prime membership, you can get this for about $25. If you want the bonus disc, which is usually just some unfinished, unpolished interview footage that comes in a single white paper envelope, it'll cost you about $33 total. And I had to wait two weeks before shipping because they couldn't meet demand on time.

5943505,4,B00ETHN9L2,"As a long time fan, it was only natural for me to pick this up. The book was great, so of course this comes as a great companion. Its not perfect by any means, it can never be the ""complete"" history of Friday the 13th, but it does have amazing insights from many of those who were involved with the franchise.

First, I must mention that the documentary, ""His Name Was Jason"" was saddening. I was truly disappointed by how goofy it was with its loud and silly background music, interviews from people I don't care about (fanboys and hipsters who run websites), and by how it seemed to make a joke of the series. Then, these guys create ""Never Sleep Again"", disappointing me more since it seemed they took Nightmare much more serious than Friday the 13th.

But then we get Crystal Lake Memories, which of course, blows both documentaries away. I have watched this 7 hour long documentary twice (once with commentary) and also watched the 4 hour bonus disc that came with the set if you pre-ordered from the Crystal Lake Memories website.

The documentary interviews over 150 people. Some interviews were shot for the His Name is Jason doc, but they were clever in trying to not use the same cuts from His Name is Jason. We get interviews this time around from people you'd never imagine you'd ever see again.

For me, the true star of the doc is Frank Mancuso Jr., who has never gone on camera to talk about the franchise. During the Paramount era, he was the guy behind the curtain, running this franchise as the producer. I always wondered about the man that made many of these films possible so its great to hear him reflect on his years with the franchise.

The commentary was very very insightful. I just wish that the filmmakers were more blatant about their dislike for several films in the series, but they chose their words carefully, and understandably so. It was quite clear that they were not fans of the New Line films including the remake, but they do not come out and say ""These films are terrible"" (and they are). Director Daniel Farrands has had a history with the franchise that goes back to the late 80's , so he's not only some fanboy making his dream documentary.

As much as I loved this, I still feel like its missing something. I wish we heard more from the actors, such as how working on these films affected their lives or the culture of fans that saw these films in the 80's. I wouldve also liked to see larger portions of the film segments spent on the special effects since these were effects-driven movies. Sure, we saw some of this in other docs or supplements, but having all this in the doc would truly make it more definitive. Also, I think its important to note that besides the commentary, there aren't any special features...at all. I understand that there are some legalities that make it difficult to have full film trailers, music videos, etc on the discs, and thats a real shame. But they could've had a section focusing on props, locations, etc. The 5th bonus disc has some non-interview bonus stuff that wouldve been nice to have as a bonus feature rather than merely an exclusive for pre-orders.

Otherwise, I really loved it! Perhaps in another 10 years, we'll have another updated doc with even more great stuff!

The extra bonus disc that came with the pre-order has 4+ hours of more interview materials, much of which I think shouldve made the documentary.",1379808000,5,3403,4.5763546798029555

One cast member saying he was the meanest kid he'd ever met and couldn't wait to kill him on screen.  They do tend to try to put a shine on some of the turds in the series. At times is a bit of a fluff piece, self-indulgent and congratulatory. You have to watch closely  just to catch some of the areas where people admit to their mistakes and regrets. I would say that, The inclusion of the TV series was totally unnecessary. No one cares. Had nothing to do with ""Crystal Lake""  Jason or anything Friday the 13th related.  They seemed to try to paint this picture of it being this amazing feat that no one really appreciated.  if not for the crazy Right-wing Christians this amazing show would still be on the air!!!!

It's not as good as ""Never Sleep Again"", but the production value is much better. The only reason I'm not in love with this like NSE is because I generally like the Elm Street movies better.
