2638926,4,B000HLDFAE,"Let me preface my review by saying that I'm a die-hard fan of ""Little Britain."" However, I will be as unbiased as possible in my review of this DVD.

I have to admit that I do agree with people's criticism that Season 3 of ""LB"" was not as funny as the previous 2. I didn't find the new characters they added terribly amusing, and sketches with the old favorites do tend to get a little repetitive. I've seen the episodes on BBC America, but I'm looking forward to hearing the episode commentary and deleted scenes. Having said that, I still think that there's enough laughs, giggles, and smiles in each episode to warrant purchasing this DVD. I'd kind of only recommend it for fans and purists... but please know that Matt Lucas and David Walliams' lesser work is still a million times funnier than a lot of drivel that we get here in the US.

Also, as for extras, that's a real enticement to get this DVD. UK fans were disappointed because they were all previously seen television clips. But they're treats and rarities for us US fans. Matt and David never disappoint when they appear on talk shows and such, so that's guaranteed laughs for you too! All in all, if you're a fan and you're considering getting this for yourself or a friend... I'd say ""Computer says yes."" :)",1163894400,17,1274,4.510822510822511
2638927,1,B000HLDFAE,"Season 1 was very funny; Season 2 was amusing. Season 3 is just awful.  The skits are predictable, the punch lines are obvious, and the jokes just aren't funny any more. This is even less than funny than SNL.",1163721600,2,208,4.333333333333333

Purchasing it from Amazon, however... the DVD did not work. I repeat, it did NOT play. With a British series, I checked several times before purchase to make sure I was buying the correct DVD format for the US & Canada. When this package arrived, neither of the DVD players in my house would read the spotless disc. Naturally, I cleaned it, tried several times, checked my TV setups -- again, the disc is useless. Very frustrating, had to return it. Currently looking for another place to purchase it.",1427155200,,668,4.605042016806722

2638958,3,B000HLDFAE,Little Britain is a hilarious show. I found that the third season lost a lot of its originality and a lot of skits were just repeated rather than enhanced in some way. Though I am glad they made a third season of the show. I believe Little Britain USA was a little more innovative as it had to change up some of its skit in order to fit a different audience. I did still enjoy it. Just not as much as season 1 or 2.,1408752000,,415,3.8941176470588235

2638962,3,B000HLDFAE,I could not give the 3rd series any higher of a rating because the manufacturer of this DVD set is now 3 for 3. By this I mean that at least one of the discs in each of the 3 series has had some sort of defect preventing me from watching the DVD. I've gone so far as to order a replacement DVD to no avail.

'Bitty' and 'wee wee lady' need to be retired. Linda is fantastic in this one...., the depressed owl is also an new adventure in ridiculous shopping requests....  My favorite is the Prime Minister's assistant - I LOVE THIS BIT ..... we must have more of him!",1369699200,,523,4.077669902912621

2638982,2,B000HLDFAE,"I own or have rented dozens of television series boxsets. I can say that this Little Britain Third series is horrendously packaged, with terrible menus and layouts.

4 stars for the program material, but no stars for the format.

The back cover has tons of writing on it, but nowhere on it does it state HOW MANY EPISODES it contains! Well, only after unwrapping it, did I find out.

6 episodes at about 28 minutes each!!
6 episodes? In a tv ""series""?!!! RIPOFF!!!

The outsides of the disks don`t even tell you which episodes are on which disks. Actually, the dvd outsides have NOTHING written on them!!

There is no episode menu. The only dvd to actually HAVE episodes doesn`t even have a ""list of episodes."" After putting a dvd into the dvd player, previews come on instantly, and you CANNOT SKIP THEM. Therefore, from the moment you insert the dvd into the player to the time an episode actually starts, it takes about 4-5 minutes. VHS is faster than this garbage.

Tape the season from tv. It`s only 6 episodes. The picture quality is pretty good. I`ve seen much better much more often.

Unfortunately, this wonderfully-written and acted program does not deserve this piece of trash formatting  at all. It seems a 6-year old put this trash together....no wait. A 6-year old can do better. More likely a preschooler.

Stay away. Save your money.",1333152000,3,1349,4.706382978723404

The first minute of the first episode, I lost it and laughed until I cried! Bubbles Deviere (if that's how you spell it) is such a crack up.
I love David Williams and Matt Lucas. British humor is so much different than American humor. I'm just so taken back by this whole series, it's BRILLIANT!
They introduce a few new characters, that DO NOT disappoint! But the regulars are even more HILARIOUS! Vicki is just as hilarious and Margery is also very funny! oh and don't forget about Sebastian! I LOVE IT!

2638988,5,B000HLDFAE,"Well, comedy is, anyway.  Little Britain brings a new level of hilarity to sketch comedy.  Lucas and Walliams have created a ridiculous cast of memorable characters.  Characters like Andy Pipkin, Mr. Man, and Daffyd Thomas really defy explanation- you've got to see them.  If your sense of humor is at all sick, twisted, weird, or otherwise somewhat off, I highly recommend Little Britain.

2638991,4,B000HLDFAE,"Acerbically narrated by the ultra eccentric Tom ""4th Dr. Who - - guy with the scarf"" Baker, Little Britain combines elements of classic British sketch humor with a contemporary twist...
Like many of its predecessors, it can be delightfully rude and edgy at times...
unlike other predecessors, the show does not hold back...
typical scenes include a women with an increasingly extreme bladder problem and just goes everywhere...
at least 5 gay/transvestite theme recurrent sketches (a closet gay prime minister, a politician who continually has to continually appear with his family and apologize and explain varying situations including ""falling and accidentally landing inside someone""  - - in another routine, the lead actors (guys of course) dressing up in grotesquely obese fat lady body suits (one is in black face) - - There is one other ""fat"" sketch... a Thai mail order bride (who turns out to be a lady boy) - - oh, and even gypsies and handicap are fair game...
Despite the series unabashed use of shock humor, the fact is however, that the show is well written and acted... even so to the extent that even the most obnoxious stuff is forgivable...

All in all, any show with a line like:
""My own mother rejects me simply for the crime of wanting men's torches in my bum bum...""
is a winner to me!

All this said, I like the show... but feel a downside is that a lot of the jokes are so recurrent you can see them coming from a mile away.... nonetheless, its hard not to watch... watch... and keep watching...

Though considered a ""classic"" by many, reviews of the show were initially mixed... like LEAGUE OF GENTLEMEN and KIDS IN THE HALL (from Canada) consider this a love it or hate it thing...If you like it, you'll probably be quoting the catch phrases for ages to come...",1218844800,,1787,4.717948717948718

I really enjoy 90% of the skits and I've developed a special liking for some characters over others. There are a couple characters and skit topics that just aren't up my alley but the others make up for them. What I truly enjoy is the attention to character detail these guys have. They are ""Kid's in the Hall"" at a level or two better. I'm definitely enjoying all three seasons and have shared with several friends. We've had a lot of fun referencing favorite characters and  key phrases (""Look into my eyes, directly into my eyes....."") in other conversations and having a good laugh.

Certainly there are annoying characters as well like the ""Computer says no"" lady, but I will forgive them for those since the funny stuff is in plenty supply.

They've added a few new characters and a couple of the old ones are gone, but the show is basically still the same. This might not go down that well with the people that think ""Little Britain"" too monotonous, but I think it works. The changes and additions, small and subtle as they might be, adds just enough new flavour for it to be new and wonderful, but it is still ""Little Britain"" all the way. The humour is still just on the edge of what is acceptable for the general audience and sometimes maybe even beyond that, but without really being offensive. It takes a lot of skill pulling that off. Very good indeed.",1178841600,,843,4.369426751592357

2639003,5,B000HLDFAE,This series is excellent if you enjoy your comedy a bit off center!,1174003200,3,67,4.230769230769231

2639007,5,B000HLDFAE,"If you have ofbeat humor, you will really love this DVD.  It is Britan as never seen before.  The inventiveness and sneaky humor is hilarious.  It is directed for adults and not really something the kids will like or even understand.  Anyone who has liked Monty Python, Doctor Who, or Red Dwarf will enjoy this.  I can see why it became an icon in the UK.  Smashing good time!! The behind the scenes is great because you find out just how much work went into this show and it is obvious everyone enjoys making it.  The two guys in the lead are really down to earth chaps who are very quiet and unassuming off camera.",1169337600,4,616,4.304347826086956

2639009,1,B000HLDFAE,"Honestly, these guys were funny two series ago.  They bring back some of the old characters (Emily Howard, Andy, the Fat fighters and Vicky Pollard) that wre funny then.  I just didn't feel it with the new characters.  And the old ones are getting tired.  More of the same I suppose.  Instead check out Extras, the new Ricky Gervais series, or the League of Gentlemen, for a dark treat.",1168992000,3,386,4.536231884057971

2639012,5,B000HLDFAE,A line used by Vicki in most episodes.  This third season introduces new dysfunctional characters such as the incontinent lady.  Such oddity can only be viewed as twisted and funny.  Watch out for Bubbles Devere at the HillGrange Health Spa.  She will crush your funny bone.,1168300800,,274,4.891304347826087
2639013,5,B000HLDFAE,I have been a fan of this series since it began.  It has progressed nicely and the humor remains uniquely British and very funny.  I wish we could get more of the BBC comedy series on DVD.,1168300800,,188,4.054054054054054

2639016,5,B000HLDFAE,Season three was not as good as season one.  I think the first season was the best.  They need to bring back Dennis Watermen.,1168300800,,125,4.166666666666667
2639017,1,B000HLDFAE,"Sure, not as great as the first two seasons,but it's still very funny.  Our set however has worked only once in the lst four attempts to play the discs.

8140308,1,B000HLDFAE,First one I received the first disc containing the actual episodes was a failed burn and was not readable by any dvd drive.  The second disc which is the special features worked fine.  Item was returned.  Second one received has the SAME EXACT ISSUE!  Disc one is not readable and disc two works.  The quality control on these is god awful and the manufactured lot should be considered faulty.  Having to return for a refund a second time in a row.  STAY AWAY!,1519948800,,460,4.469879518072289
