2480997,5,B000E1JOYS,"Tennessee Tuxedo is a completely goofy show about a penguin who wants to prove that he is as good as a man, and his walrus friend, Chumbley.
In the course of the stories Tenn. always runs into torouble and runs to consult Mr. Whoopee, the man who knows everything. Mr. Whoopee uses the 3-d B.B. to explain bridge building, electricity, sculpture, physics, and more. The education is intertwined so well in the story that my children have no idea they are learning anything.",1357689600,,473,4.710843373493976
2480998,5,B000E1JOYS,i totally enjoy the old shows.  ordered and received this item in excellant time.  completely pleased with the purchasing process...,1356393600,,132,5.55
2480999,5,B000E1JOYS,"This dvd, The Best of Tennessee Tuxedo and His Tales, was a smooth transaction and the show is a classic and fun to watch!",1322870400,,122,4.125
2481000,4,B000E1JOYS,"I bought this for my kids (OK and for me too) as many of the lessons from this show that I learned as a kid still stay with me.  I know the basic idea behind an internal combustion engine and the light bulb thanks to Mr. Whoopee.

The quality of the video transfer is excellent.  However, all the bumpers on either end of each episode are gone.  It makes the episodes seem a bit disjointed.  Also, the theme song (""Come on and see, see, see, Tennessee Tuxedo...) has been re-recorded by someone.  Why didn't they use the recording of the original singers?  Of course my kids don't know the difference, but for me it was grating.

All-in-all, this is still a must-have collection.  The printing on the DVD itself, has Mr. Whoopee explaining how a DVD works.  My kids (7 & 9) LOVE the antics of Tennessee and Chumley and are getting smarter with every episode they watch.  I just wish the producers had kept more of the lead-ins and the original song.",1320019200,3,949,4.427745664739884
2481001,1,B000E1JOYS,"The Tennessee Tuxedo cartoons(/63-/66-71 made in all)are herewith presented with just one opening segment while the rest just run into each other,with no closing segment. These eps are all culled from the first season but done and presented in this way,they are terribly dry,clinical and humourless. These cartoons worked best when they ran with other cartoons like Underdog and even Jay Ward segments from Rocky and Bullwinkle.
While the cartoons themselves look very good,the only extras are some riddles and some audio outtakes from the original recording session.
So while the mention of Tennessee may bring back fond memories of his friends Chumley,Prof Know-it-all with his 3D Blackboard,Yakkety Yak,Baldy the Eagle,etc.;for all you baby boomers out there I would give this DVD a WIDE pass. It is guaranteed NOT to bring back any fond memories of the show and in fact you may wonder what you ever liked about it at all. Thanks Sony for nothing.",1317600000,,950,5.096153846153846
2481002,5,B000E1JOYS,This sure bring backs a lot of great memories from over 40 years ago. It's great to see this on DVD to enjoy time and time again. Some of the other reviewers are right...there were more than just 15 episodes made in this cartoon series. For now anyway I will enjoy this collection of Tennessee and Chumley. By the way I wish they would have had some of the bloopers from Don Adams in this. Don Adams will be best remembered for this cartoon and Get Smart! Enjoy!,1252108800,,462,4.261363636363637
2481003,5,B000E1JOYS,I love this cartoon.  It gives you funny stories but also lessons in science & history. My neice is now a big fan.,1242604800,2,114,3.9565217391304346
2481004,5,B000E1JOYS,I always enjoyed these cartoons as a kid.  It was nice to find this dvd and share it with my children aged 4 and 5 and find out that they enjoy it as much as any of the current children's cartoons.,1231286400,2,197,3.8048780487804876
2481035,2,B000E1JOYS,"...perhaps I'll look for a pirate version that has the complete series available. I hate doing that but my money is valuable to me and how and what I spend it one better be of real quality. I'm tired of corporate bean counters dictating to me what they will deign to throw at we Americans rather than pleasing the customer as businesses once did in this country, a long time ago now.

I was forced to buy a pirate version of another series, Batman the '60s TV series, as it seems there is no release going to be made for this show at all, not merely any time soon, but at all. I did my research on this and found a site from a guy who worked on the series intimately and he said there is likely never to be a release of the Batman television series.

But there was someone online who made very good quality home recorded DVDs of it. So, if the corporate fascists won't take care of us customers then we'll take care of ourselves.

You greedy corporate thieves want my and other Americans' money? Then you all better damned well come across with what we want and in a quality form in all things. Wall Street crashing recently and how angry We, The People are with all you greedy thieves should tell you all something.

Back to Tennessee Tuxedo. I'll give the corporate brains six months from the date of this post to come out with a full series package. Then if nothing happens, I'll see what other avenues on the net avails me of what I want. I have no problem in buying legitimate products if they're of quality. But when the corporates figure to toy with we customers to the point of ripping us off, well, get with the program you bean counters and give us Americans the quality of products we want and you'll get your money then. Until then...

2481036,5,B000E1JOYS,"My Mom really enjoyed reminiscing over her childhood with this cartoon! She was quite happy with this as a ""no special occasion"" gift!",1216252800,2,134,4.869565217391305
2481037,4,B000E1JOYS,"I never even heard of 1960s cartoon show ""Tennessee Tuxedo"" until shortly before I got myself this DVD. And boy do I love it. From Total Television (""Underdog""), this show follows the adventures of suave, optimistic penguin Tennessee Tuxedo and his dimwitted walrus pal Chumley as they try to improve life in Megopolis Zoo. This involves everything from installing light bulbs to deep-sea diving. To assist them in accomplishing their goals, Tennessee and Chumley have the help of Phineas J. Whoopee and his three-dimensional blackboard (the 3DBB for short). To make matters more difficult are oppressive zookeeper Stanley Livingston as well as an assortment of unpleasant characters. But whether Tennessee or Chumley succeed, their adventures always have a distinct, laid-back charm to them.

""Tennessee Tuxedo"" debuted on ""The Underdog Show"", and has an animation style similar to that wave of animation which was popular in the 60s.  There is something really nice about the atmosphere of this show. It has a kind of early-morning, drinking-your-coffee feeling about it. Not to mention is it really educating for many adults, since explanations as to how things like the telephone, light bulb, telegraph and more function are very clear and interestingly presented. And the adventures themselves are often deceptively profound, with Tennessee and Chumley always trying to improve their lives and often others', but meeting nothing but heavy opposition because they're a penguin and a walrus. Especially Chumley the walrus is a really endearingly goodhearted character.

I do agree with criticism based on the actual DVD release of this show, however. It is a 'Best of' DVD, and those should always be taken with a grain of salt. The quality is superb, true, but the episodes aren't in run-time order, and the 15 episodes aren't the entire repertoire of their adventures. Not to mention is there an unskippable Casper cartoon show ad every time you insert the DVD. However, there is a short 'Riddles' section and a nice outtake recording of the title song.

This is, on the whole, a nice cartoon show, especially for those interested in animation. The release may have its faults, but the show has a lasting charm.",1198886400,5,2216,5.164345403899722
2481038,5,B000E1JOYS,"They don't make cartoons like this anymore.  Sure, the graphics are much better today, but the stories are not as compelling.  Adults can enjoy Tennessee and his friends with as much glee as children, although they might have to keep it a dirty little secret from others who might not understand.

In addition, the talented Ben Stern can be heard coaxing a wonderful performance from the vocalists as they render the famous theme song in one of the extras available on the DVD.",1186963200,3,477,4.72289156626506
2481039,5,B000E1JOYS,"You can here Howard Stern's Dad ""Ben"" on the outtakes.
You should buy this now and ""don't be stupid you moron"".

The cartoon itself is as I remembered it.  Very enjoyable and representative of simpler times.  The bonus features aren't that great but it's great to see T.T. again!

""Thank You""",1182988800,5,292,4.666666666666667
2481040,4,B000E1JOYS,"You probably couldn't do better than to plunk down twelve bucks for this DVD if you're looking for a real kid-pleaser. Don Adams as positive thinking penguin Tennessee is magic as he was in Get Smart and Inspector Gadget. Larry Storch from F-Troop and the Original Ghostbusters (not the movie) is excellent as Mr. Whoopee. This cartoon is billed as ""sort of educational"" because Mr. W. enlightens Tenessee and his walrus pal Chumley with the aid of the 3D Blackboard (3D BB).

The art looks like Jay Ward Studios (Rocky and Bullwinkle) but it's from Total Television (Underdog). What we'd like a lot better is if these series were presented in their original format and the whole run released on DVD (hence four stars for this five star cartoons series). Get the Underdog DVD box set, however, and you also get a couple Tennessee and friends under the ""Cliffhanger Cartoons"" section.

I'm wary of buying ""Best of"" DVDs like this because I'd rather wait and get the box sets with the shows in order (if one is forthcoming). It's possible that companies put these single DVDs out as feelers to see if a box set will sell, but the sales figures wouldn't be accurate since fans would hold off waiting for the set (that's what's happening with the single DVDs of Ed, Edd and Eddy). The solution is to buy these single DVDs as gifts for all the kids you've ever met and wait to get the box set for yourself.

Some cartoons don't work well out of context. For instance, I don't think the Peabody and Sherman cartoons by themselves are very exciting on their ""Best of"" single DVD. But in the context of the Rocky and Bullwinkle box sets they're excellent.

A lot of cartoons were released a few at a time on video in the VHS format, most of which are no longer available. Since DVDs hold a lot more, most DVDs contain at least two VHS tapes' worth. Happily, many of the cartoons formerly released on VHS are now starting to come out on DVD. Hopefully this show will get a box set, but regardless, kids will love this DVD and to see, see, see Tenessee Tuxedo.",1147132800,24,2050,4.517520215633423
2481041,4,B000E1JOYS,"Even though this TTV/Leonardo Productions animated show is now 40 years old, things like how light bulbs and telephones work are still accurate and very educational for little ones.  Being part of the disregard for violence era of cartoons, it remarkably has little gun play, violence, or fisticuffs (at least the episodes on this DVD).  It has some very informative scenes where Tennessee and his pal Chumley get instruction and their education from Phineas J. Whoopee and his 3-D blackboard.  Very fun for children of today to watch, and a highly recommended piece of cartoon nostalgia.",1145145600,6,588,5.104166666666667
2481042,3,B000E1JOYS,"""Tennessee Tuxedo and His Tales"" arguably was one of the best series to come out of Total Television (now owned by Classic Media who also owns the rights to Casper, hence the promo), next to ""The Underdog Show"". Unfortunately, Classic's treatment of the TTV material pales in comparison to their treatment of the Jay Ward material (which they also now own). They should offer complete seasons instead of ""best of's"" as there were 70 ""Tennessee Tuxedo"" episodes in total. Also, the theme song has been changed to a 'demo' version instead of the actual one sung by Don Adams and Bradley Bolke (Tennessee and Chumley, respectively). The prints are good, and the cartoons are still entertaining, despite my misgivings on the packaging.

FYI, Total Television produced the following series (in no particular order) from 1959-1969:

King Leonardo

The Hunter

Tooter the Turtle

Tennessee Tuxedo

Klondike Kat

Commander McBragg

Underdog

Go-Go Gophers

The Beagles

According to Wikipedia, the rug was pulled from TTV and Gamma Productions (the animation house that also animated much of Jay Ward's stuff) when General Mills (the show's sponsor) pulled out in 1969. The last show to be produced was going to be called ""The Colossal Show"" which was never completed, although there is a comic book out there. The rights reverted back to the creators who sold it to Lorne Michaels (of ""Saturday Night Live"") who in turn sold it to Golden Books, and then was acquired by Classic Media, the current owners.",1142467200,45,1497,5.020242914979757
2481043,3,B000E1JOYS,"I'm in my mid 40's and I watched Tennessee Tuxedo in its original form on a thirteen inch black and white Zenith TV back in the mid 1960's.  I am thrilled just to see Tennessee and his friends in color (I didn't know they were in color) and in a high quality reproduction on a modern TV.

That said, there's something very sterile about this approach to packaging these old cartoons.  It's really not like watching those great old shows I remember over again because what you have here is fifteen or so Tennessee segments (many more episodes were produced) cut out of their original context and presented pure, alone, and rather clinically at that.  (And with a weird and totally out-of-context promo for a Casper the Ghost show that you have to view every time you put in the DVD.)

There's a certain fun factor that's been removed.  It's like an exhibit in a futuristic museum of 1960's kids TV.  You can see, but you can't really experience the subject matter.

I just wish more of these cartoons would be released like the Bullwinkle and Rocky cartoons have been: seasonal box sets with the original stuff all there.",1142380800,104,1120,4.592964824120603
2481044,4,B000E1JOYS,"I am going to be 35 years old this sunday which means I was watching Tennessee and Chumley on the Underdog show back in the '70s. I remember I actually enjoyed the Tennessee Tuxedo shorts more than the Underdog and Go-Go Gophers etc most of the time. The 'education' that is part of each plot was fascinating to me as I child. I loved to read and learn and I loved cartoons!

Very great times and very good memories.
I think most other people my age, if they are interested at all, would like to see/relive these shorts in their original, Underdog cliff-hanger style - but I will take what I can get.

Technical:
Overall, I would say the picture and sound quality are quite good, but I did note a couple of details:
1.) There is an UNSKIPPABLE Casper commercial on the DVD
2.) When using 'Play All', there are no credits or breaks to Underdog etc. so the shorts sort of run together if you aren't paying close attention.
3.) The package says, '15 of the greatest episodes' - what are we missing??

I do not have kids, but this is really great (and slightly educational) stuff and I highly recommend it. I have no doubt that Tennessee, Chumley, and Phineas all had a hand in my great love of knowledge and humor.

Episode List:
1.) The Rainmakers (Learn to seed a cloud)
2.) The Lamplighters (Learn to make a lightbulb)
3.) Telephone Terrors (Learn about telephones)
4.) The Giant Clam Caper (Learn about deep sea diving)
5.) Tic-Tock (Learn how a clock works)
6.) Scuttled Sculpture (Learn about sculpture)
7.) The Bridge Builders (Learn to build a bridge)
8.) Howl, Howl, The Gang's All Here (Learn how to build a log cabin)
9.) Sail On, Sail On (Learn about sailing)
10.) Tell-Tale Telegraph (Learn about the telegraph)
11.) Rocket Ruckus (Learn about rockets)
12.) Tale Of A Tiger (Learn about battle armor)
13.) Wreck Of A Record (Learn how a record player works)
14.) Parachuting Pickle (Learn about parachutes)
15.) Wish-Wash (Learn about windmills)",1141603200,49,1955,4.6253602305475505
