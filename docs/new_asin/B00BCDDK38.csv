8565909,5,B00BCDDK38,"Fairy Knight is actually the Japanese 2013 DVD release of the 1999 South African movie, Dazzle. It was previously released in DVD Region 1 as The Fairy Princess: Secret of the Crystal.

There hasn't been a Region 1 rerelease of Dazzle since 2001, and somehow this movie made its way to DVD Region 2 some 12 years later.

I kinda like this movie yet it's still uncut and the plot sometimes don't make sense. Well basically the original English version is subtitled in Japanese, which you can turn OFF on their DVD Menu. This movie plays automatically in the same similar fashion of Disney's Fast Play, you know when you pop in this DVD on Region 2 DVD player or DVD Burner.
I think the Japanese sleeve for Dazzle 1999 is high quality, and pretty magical. This release would be a nice collectible for you.",1436745600,,803,4.531034482758621
