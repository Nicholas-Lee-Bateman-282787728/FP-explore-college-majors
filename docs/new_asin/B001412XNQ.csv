8253939,5,B001412XNQ,A very entertaining movie I saw during a plane flight. Even with out all of the special effects and explosions we see in American movies this movie kept my attention. It is a story of lost love finding the old love and saving the world. I guess it is fair to say the hero of this movie was a woman. I am so glad I found this movie on DVD so I can watch the movie with my girlfriend.,1212105600,,382,3.848101265822785
