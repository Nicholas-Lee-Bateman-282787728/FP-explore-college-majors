345846,4,6301706811,"An unbelievably terse look at the Hollywood scene from an insider, but cleverly done with a witty script and a talented ensemble cast. I don't want to give too much away, but it is worth the money if you enjoy broad farce, a well flipped bird to the assumed politics of the studio system and the ending a tribute to one of Hollywoods' most cherished rumored kinapping / funerals. An outrageously successful Hollywood producer with an equally successful Hollywood actress wife commits The Biggest Sin - he produces a flop and flips out. With studio execs after his head, the producer loses his head, his wife and ultimately tries to end his life, only to heed the "" bugles' call "" ( watch it and see ) and has an epiphany...to re-shoot his flop with eroticism. The late Richard Mulligan is laugh out loud funny and heartbreakingly sad throughout the movie. His trio of friends - Holden, Webber, Preston - prop up the plot, the ties of friendship and loyalty and give the movie its' most poignant moments, as well as its' most clever.",1019260800,,1032,4.614130434782608

Thrown together is a brilliant cast, a rediculous story, a bunch of crazy characters, and the centerpiece: Julie Andrews' boobs bared. The result is a very funny and entertaining movie that is well worth seeing.",1017187200,,385,4.848484848484849
345849,5,6301706811,"Actually, I'm reviewing this from memory of having seen the film when originally released.  I fondly remember it as very funny -- and there are images that I retain.  (No one has mentioned Robert Vaughn in ""Rocky Horror Picture Show"" Dr. Frankenfurter drag! -- with pink, puff mules yet!!)  Just to see William Holden and Robert Preston work should entice any acting aficionado.  Robert Preston was one of the best we'll ever know -- and that goes all the way back to 1939's ""Union Pacific"" with Barbara Stanwyck.  William Holden was perhaps the best film actor ever -- he was never over the top, but never lacking.  Subtle.  Julie Andrews attempted to do what she had mildly threatened for many years -- to put that virginal, goody-goody image in the dust bin where it belongs.  She is extraordinarily adept, and we'll probably never know how agile an actress she truly is.  Tote up the rest of this brilliant ensemble cast, and you'll laugh like you've been wanting to laugh for a long time.  Not only do they not make them like they used to, but nobody else ever made one like this.  It's an original, and (to my knowledge) no one has attempted to copy this gem.  Kudos to Blake Edwards et al.",997747200,4,1196,4.563380281690141
345850,4,6301706811,"Lewd, crude, rude. Richard Mulligan is Soap's Bert Campbell joined with Norman Maine on psychedelics. Robert Preston & Bill Holden are the best best friends a crazed director could have. If you enjoy seeing Hollywood  get the shaft, i.e. The Player, Sunset Boulevard, & Ashley & Mary  Kate Join The San Berdoo Angels, you'll have lots of belly laughs &  guffaws. S.O.B. is also full of fashion tips for those who miss(missed?)  the '70s. Once past the excruciating musical number, which is the most  horrible thing since I was stuck at a drive-in through Mary Poppins AND The  Sound Of Music (The S & M), S.O.B. shows why it shouldn't be  overlooked. Can Blake Edwards follow this up with a musical version of  Dogma? I hope so. Did I mention, Julie Andrews bares her chest? You've  gotta love it. Check it out.",963792000,3,811,4.654929577464789
345851,4,6301706811,"Julie Andrews baring her breasts? If they are hers then she has nothing to be ashamed of. This is one of those movies that the critic's hated but the majority of people who saw it found it hilarious. When you have such  wonderful veteran actors such as Richard Mulligan,Julie Andrews,Robert  Preston,Loretta Swit et al. in one production there is bound to be a good  time by all. The humour is definately slap stick with Richard Mulligan doing  a wonderful job as a hollywood producer who cannot deal with the only flop  he ever had and is trying desperately to kill himself but just can't seem  to get the job done. Robert Preston is wonderful and funny as the boozing  but very sympathic doctor. Julie Andrews plays Richard Mulligans wife to the  hilt with gusto -she is kind of caught in the middle and has all kinds of  lawyers,agents,personal secretaries trying to advise her on how to handle  her divorce from Richard and the eventual big mess that he ends up getting  her involved. Just to hear Julie Andrews cuss and show her involved in a  soft porn movie is worth the price of this one. This is anothe one of those  movies that i can't really justify liking it as well as i do-other than it  keeps me chuckling almost all the way through it.
this movie is now availiable on dvd and i would recomment getting it via that format due to the fact of the longevity vs. vhs.",954201600,11,1378,4.46

345866,2,6301706811,"Bear with me here. In 1971, Blake Edwards made a film named DARLING LILI. Set in World War I, it starred Julie Andrews as a German spy, with whom the audience is supposed to sympathize. It was a flop, and nearly sank the studio that produced it. It DESERVED to flop. Its awful.

In 1981, Edwards made SOB, about a director who makes a musical nobody likes, amd how he is screwed by The System. Since Edwards had a highly successful career, this frankly comes off as a temper tantrum about how a musical of his got treated. What musical of his was received with the enthusiasm normally accorded a dead skunk? DARLING LILI.

This is a bad film full of hysterically funny bits. Robert Preston as a Hollywood quack doctor is priceless. The first half or so of the film is a lot of fun...and I almost never watch the last third.

I recommend the film, with caveats; if you like Robert Preton, don't miss it. William Holden is great, too. And I suppose it has curiosity interest as the only film in which Julie Andrews has a topless scene. But it isn't a good movie.",1509840000,,1060,4.370558375634518

345870,4,6301706811,"S.O.B. is a ""lost"" gem and is one of the last gasps of the old Hollywood studio system. Blake Edwards skewers multiple ""real"" targets in this Hollywood satire about a producer (not too different from Edwards himself) who casts his wife (played by Edwards' real-life wife, squeaky clean Julie Andrews) in one of the biggest flops in Hollywood history. He becomes suicidal, then has an epiphany. SEX! He reshoots the huge flop as a ""pornographic"" epic. Though what was considered porn back then was truly tame by our current jaded standards. An amazing and hilarious supporting cast, including William Holden in his final film, makes this a must-see. And it looks great on Blu-Ray!

I'm sure it was meant as a dark comedy, however all I could see was dark. The endless uselessness of the characters lives was enough to make you question why you're living at all. Blake Edwards was a big name in comedy after his success with Pink Panther and he had a cast of wonderful actors here, including his then wife, Julie Andrews. But he wasted their time and ours when we could have been doing more fun things. The only scene in which you see Edwards' brilliance is the first scene in the garage.

345892,4,6301706811,"I always think of this as part of a pair of mature-themed movies that the lovely Julie Andrews did (""10"" being the other) and completed my appreciation for her.  Of course the scene where she tears off her top was a delight as well (and I saw this for the first time as a young teenager) and still looks very good now on Blu-ray.  Overall I find early 80's comedies interesting as a time piece, in terms of the sets and costumes but also the culture that was still showing some remnants of 70s style.

As far as the Blu-ray itself, it's refreshingly simple in its features - just a trailer and English subtitles, with a beautiful transfer and nice audio.  Even better, the disc has other playback features enabled (my BD player has things like an A-B loop as well as zooming in up to 4x - but these often don't work at all on newer major studio releases).

I'd give it 5 stars if we got just a few more extras (e.g. commentary, interviews etc), but I'm very pleased with this purchase.",1498953600,2,985,4.331521739130435

345912,1,6301706811,"Julie Andrews bares all for her art and husband in S.O.B. For the record; she's as perky below the neckline as she was above it in more meaningful film fare like Mary Poppins and The Sound of Music. The scene herein is superfluous and idiotic. Blake Edwards, generally known for razor-biting comedy, herein just gives us dark, dirty, arrogant barbs lobbed all over the screen, determined to make us hate the disreputable characters who populate this mangled melange of Hollywood hotheads, harlots and has beens. It's a real sour blend of A-list talent and it leaves as bitter a taste as one might imagine. Clumsy comedy that's not funny at all - or revealing either; as I suspect was Edwards real reason for making this movie in the first place. Both he and Andrews have done better work elsewhere.  Warner Archives' Blu-ray transfer is a middling effort at best; heavy of grain, some gate weave in the opening credits, and just competent without being stellar. Personally, I would avoid this one like the plague. Life and Hollywood are ugly enough without the unnecessary embellishments Edwards applies herein.",1492041600,,1111,4.9411764705882355

I love this era of film, I love when Julie Andrews plays against type, I love ensemble casts, and I love the type of movie that sends up any industry and exposes its underbelly in a clever way. Though this had all the ingredients, it just didn't work for me perhaps because I found it to be more cruel than clever. Black comedy is usually a favorite of mine, but except for a few lines here and there, I found it to be completely heartless and fairly depressing. Most of the characters had no redeeming qualities whatsoever, and maybe that was the point. However even the characters I was supposed to like and have sympathy for I found to be largely unlikeable. I did like the parts played by Julie Andrews, William Holden, and Robert Preston, but even they took a while to warm up to. The only one I liked from start to finish was the dog, and I was not satisfied with how his story ended at all. Now a lot of the actors seemed to be phoning it in, but I do grant there were some pretty decent performances. However if you aren't starting with a worthwhile character, a good performance can't always salvage the role.  Glad I rented this one instead of purchasing.",1489449600,,1203,4.342222222222222

God love Blake Edwards cajones to make this film.

R.I.P. almost everyone from this perhaps-too-long overlooked Hollywood film.
Incidentally, though many are critically praised, most films showing behind-the-scenes Hollywood have never faired well box-office-wise.

345952,4,6301706811,"Created by Blake Edwards as a means of breaking wife Julie Andrews excessively wholesome image, the 1970 movie DARLING LILI received ho-hum critical reaction and proved a box office disaster.  A decade later, Edwards revisited the experience in the form a movie he titled S.O.B., a surprisingly dark satire on the film industry and those who inhabit it.  S.O.B. received a sharply divided response from the critics and did somewhat disappointing business at the box office, but over the years it has become something of a cult filmand then as now, it is singularly famous for the movie in which Julie Andrews rips open her gown to expose her breasts.

The story concerns producer/director Felix Farmer (Richard Mulligan), who has never had a flop film until the release of Night Wind, an expensive movie that has been savaged by critics and ignored by audiences.  Deserted by his wife and the movies star (Julie Andrews), he attempts suicidebut when he is felt up at an impromptu orgy he is inspired to reshoot the film, transforming it from a family friendly musical into a sexed-up Freudian nightmare.  But can he convince his wife, the studio boss, and their various minions to go along?

S.O.B. is crammed with stars.  Julie Andrews, William Holden, Robert Preston, and Shelly Winters major stars, and the other characters were played by such notables as Larry Hagman, Loretta Swift, and Robert Vaughn.  They are all capable, with Loretta Swift a standout as a particularly nasty celebrity gossip reporter, the script is often memorable, and the production values are spot-on.  But it is easy to see where the movie went astray: it is half satire, half physical farce, and the two don't mix terribly well, with Mulligans performance a case in point.  It also relies, at least to a certain extent, on you having a knowledge of Hollywood scandal, legend, and lore, and if you don't it won't be as funny to you as it otherwise would.

In spite of being terrifically uneven, S.O.B. is also unexpectedly watchable.  You may not get all the jokes, and you may find it a strange blendbut it is never dull; when it goes, it goes with a bang; and yes, you really do get to see Julie Andrews knockers.  Recommended.

His solution, turn it in to soft porn! The list of actors in this movie reads like a 70's A list from William Holden (his last movie) Robert Preston, Loretta Swit (MASH) the list goes on.  Almost too long at 2 hours it is packed with great scenes and dialog.  The finale involving a Viking funeral is to die for...  Am I too forgiving for it's problems in giving it 5 stars?

S.O.B.: Geez (I wrote, shaking my head). That Blake Edwards. Half genius (""The Great Race""); half idiot (""Skin Deep""). What do you do with a guy who has a deep understanding of comedy--but only about half the time? Most distressing of all: his audiences. A year after ignoring this masterpiece, critics and the public awarded rave reviews to the mediocre ""Victor/Victoria."" Sure, ""V/V"" was a funny flick. But ""S.O.B."" remains by far the funnier--and more intelligent and insightful--of the two. (And I say this despite its rude, crude and juvenile humor.)

Legend has it that ""S.O.B."" is based on Edwards' experiences making ""Darling Lili"" in 1969 with his wife, Julie Andrews. Things must have gone horribly awry for him to hold a grudge for over a decade! ""S.O.B."" is his revenge: an hilariously savage satire of the creative individual at odds with The Industry; a valentine with a death threat scrawled on the back. It's ""Sullivan's Travels"" meets ""Fatal Instinct""--and the very idea of a scene in which an actress exposes her headlights being considered ""shocking"" seems quaint--almost innocent--today, following Sharon Stone's exposure in that latter flick.

""S.O.B."" is chock-full of character actors, all in fine form, all performing gloriously, flamboyantly over the top. Few do physical comedy like rubberman Mulligan; Webber is hysterical (in both senses of the word); and Preston steals every shot he's in as the tart-tongued, devil-may-care Dr. Feelgood, world-weary and full of cynical wisdom (essentially the same character he would play again in ""Victor/Victoria""). As a trio tied together by their camaraderie with Felix and their sense of integrity (an endangered species in Hollywood), Holden, Preston and Webber perform in fine fettle as ""The Three Muscatels"" in the final few minutes of the film, recreating in fiction a legendary event in Hollywood history involving W.C. Fields and his cronies and the about-to-be-buried body of actor John Barrymore. Here, the ensemble goes a step further in fiction than their kindred forebears did in fact, and their farewell tribute is at once original, hilarious, heartbreakingly poignant, and totally appropriate.

Be warned, however: A major plot twist occurs about three-quarters of the way through the film (one which I can't reveal, because of our ""no spoilers"" rule). This twist is so unexpected, so shocking, so sobering, so downright appalling--and is such a personal violation of the viewer (precisely what Edwards intended, no doubt)--that you may very well be tempted to give up on the film. (When I first saw this movie, after this event I was actually ashamed of ever having laughed at Felix's predicament.) You might well be convinced at this point (as I was) that you will never again laugh at this ""comedy."" Well, guess what? The last half-hour of the flick shifts into comic high gear, becoming twice as fall-down funny twice as fast as anything that came before it. Edwards accomplishes two brilliant transitions, manipulating our expectations and emotions, as ""S.O.B."" transforms from light comedy to sobering tragedy to pitch black slapstick at its finest. It is in effect a reverse roller coaster ride, rocketing us from an acceptable elevation of levity to distressing depths, then recovering at the speed of lightness to attain the highest dark comic heights.",1422403200,,3602,5.1521367521367525

B."" being IMHO the best of the lot.  This movie is so bitter and twisted but truthful about the creative process in Hollywood - and all the levels of interference and back stabbing associated.  The plot constantly twists and turns, the cast is packed with great characters, and the dialogue is witty in a way that makes me nostalgic. But the real heart of the movie is the trio of William Holden, Robert Preston, and Robert Webber who hold down the center of the picture like a Greek chorus.  They aren't necessarily nicer of more ethical than anyone else - except Robert Webber's weak stomached agent, who shows the only true remorse in the entire picture - but they get the funniest lines and keep the party going, no matter what.

346109,5,6301706811,"Years ago, in a Playboy magazine interview, Blake Edwards was asked, of all the movies he made, what was his favorite. His response was S.O.B (Same Old Bulls..t) He also went on to explain that the reason this movie is so unknown is because Hollywood wouldn't promote it. It's a dark comedy that slams the whole shallow, cheating, double crossing, what-have-you-done-for-me-lately movie industry. With an all star cast (at least for it's time), this movie, like it or hate it, should be better known. It has some very funny visual comedy but the real standout is its subtle dialogue. Robert Preston as the Hollywood Doctor & Loretta Swit as the Gossip Columnist are real standouts. (Swit looks & plays the part of a Rona Barrett clone so well, I'm sure the lawyers had a fit) Richard Mulligan stars as Felix Farmer, a producer who's having a breakdown after his last movie was a big bomb & Julie Andrews (Edwards real life wife) plays his wife & G-Rated Star. (yes, Edwards even pokes fun at himself) After their latest movie fails, Felix, in an irrational moment decides to reshoot it as an R-Rated movie but the studio won't put up any more money. So Felix buys the rights & stakes everything on doing it himself. I won't give away any more except to say, as far as I know, this is Julie Andrews only nude scene. (although it only lasts about 5 sec) But be warned. I admit this is one of my favorite movies of all time & I'm bias. I've shared it with a lot of people & the reaction is never neutral.

I think my main issue here is in the lazy writing, where nothing is given real grounded merit and instead feels tossed in for shock effect or for a laugh, but nothing really substantial.  Still, the black comedy of the film industry is ripe for mockery, and this film does nail some key aspects, especially in the building of the two main characters, Sally Miles and Felix Farmer.  It doesnt hurt that Andrews and Mulligan are so gifted in the ways of comedy.  Andrews is a riot, and also the most grounded of the actors here (shades!) but the rest of the cast does everything they can to keep us interested.

Well worth a jolly laugh at a Hollywood ""A-Lister"" gang(?)who enjoyed their liquor, women, drugs (prescription) in that order of course!  I am sure 'outtakes' would be hilarious.  Of course those, clips are probably in someone's vault--waiting for the last one to pass on!

Pause the DVD, empty bladder, replenish cocktail before the ""Morgue"" scene.  I believe it is the most outrageous caper ever to get past censures at the time. Seemed like everyone was having such a good time 'improvising' sections of this movie--it is difficult to see where script ends and send-ups began. I am sure a good bit of alcohol was consumed by all during entire shoot.

Ms Julie Andrews,is beautiful, delightful,sexy and bawdy in this film, directed by her husband.  Understand she has quite a 'vocabulary' in real life (Mary Poppins, she  ain't!)

I was very pleased by the Sellers' kindly handling a couple of matters.  His 'good will' helped make the day fun for many who think they are forgotten. I donated this movie to local community help center, serving retired/disabled veterans.  It is a 'guys-guy' movie, bit on the raunchy side...perfect film to give those fellows a laugh--which I was informed it indeed 'did'!

Mulligan from the first scene was trying to commit suicide and from there it went down hill for a laugh a minute.  These is one scene which is so funny. This is where the guys try to snatch Mulligan's body out of the funeral home. It has to be watched again and again for the laughs.

I was enthralled with the story and found myself laughing a lot at the shenanigans of the whole lot of them.  I recently re-watched it with my middle aged eyes and it still holds up only now there is a lot of nostalgia that goes with it.

Julie Andrews was fantastic and absolutely gorgeous in this role.  I honestly have to say that I still blushed during the big reveal of her ""boobies.""  However, I now realize the brilliance of that whole scene. There is a lot of funny, funny stuff being said and done throughout.

This was William Holden's last film and it is hard to believe that he was only 63 at the time. Many years of alcoholism had aged him in the harshest ways.  He was long past his ""Golden Boy"" days, yet,his ""Cully"" still had a swagger that was seriously legit.

My all-time-fave was Robert Preston who is someone I never get tired of watching.  His ""Irving"" was witty, sarcastic and charming.  It's obvious that he engaged in a lot of delicious debauchery that would have been a hoot to hear him tell.

The rest of the supporting cast was a who's who of 80's movies and television: Richard Mulligan (from ""Soap"") Larry Hagman (from ""Dallas""), Robert Webber, Robert Vaughan, Marissa Berenson, Shelley Winters, Stuart Margolin (from ""The Rockford Files""), Rosanna Arquette, etc.

I thoroughly enjoyed this spoof of '80s Hollywood - the stars of screen and TV combine to make this a sidesplitting 2 hours. Julie Andrews(Mary Poppins), William Holden(Bridge on the River Kwai), Robert Preston(The Music Man) join forces with Richard Mulligan(SOAP), Robert Vaughn(Man From UNCLE),Loretta Swit(MASH) and a first rate cast of supporting actors to flesh out a story line all too familiar to Hollywood ... mega-bucks spent by a studio on a 'FIVE-STAR-FLOP!'  How fast can the blame be shifted and fingers pointed? Better yet - how can the studio recover any of their money?
How many personalities can you recognize? The cross-dressing studio head? The 'Miss-Squeaky-Clean-""G""-rated' actress? The over-the-hill-womanizing director? Or the go-for-the-kill gossip columnist?
Richard Mulligan plays Felix Farmer, the producer of 'NightWind' (a major flop that breaks wind everywhere it plays) whose only idea to salvage his career is to kill himself. Throughout the first half of the film he tries various methods unsuccessfully. Finally, after his last disastrous attempt - which drops him into the middle of an orgy, he gets a revelation - turn the ""G"" movie into an ""X"" rating!

S.O.B. has  nudity (a brief topless shot of Julie included...), sexual innuendo at every turn, drugs,  homosexual references, sex-implied acts, profanity and bribery. But it's also a fast and funny story about a marriage that's crumbling amid the chaos of Hollywood and the friendships that swirl around it.

 With lots of big name actors including William Holden, Richard Mulligan, Robert Preston, Larry Hagman, Shelly Winters, and Julie Andrews to name a few, S.O.B. is a movie that is still relevant. Hollywood egos still power the money-making machine, and people still give lip service to carrying about what happens to each other even while stabbing each other in the back.

346227,3,6301706811,"After his family-friendly movie staring his wife, squeaky-clean actress Sally Miles (Julie Andrews), becomes the biggest flop of all time, director Felix Farmer (Richard Mulligan) decides to turn the movie into a porno in an effort to regain the money he has lost.

By now, just about everyone should know the gimmick behind this film: ""S.O.B"" is that movie in which Julie Andrews swears and does a nude scene in an (unsuccessful) effort to tarnish the squeaky-clean image that she earned from making movies like ""Mary Poppins"" and ""The Sound of Music"", and admittedly, that gimmick was what convinced me to see this film. In theory this is a great idea for a film, and for the first 90 minutes, I thought it was working. The first three-quarters of this film are a hilarious take on Hollywood, with some great sight-gags that have no real purpose other than that they are just plain funny (for example, the running joke about the dead guy on the beach). In fact, I would favourably compare the first three-quarters of ""S.O.B"" with ""Network"", the classic television industry satire. Unfortunately, ""S.O.B"" is ruined by writer/director Blake Edwards not knowing when to end the film.

There is a point at about the 90 minute mark which felt to me like it would be a great place to stop this film (I won't mention what it is, in order to avoid spoilers, but you'll know it if you see it). However, Blake Edwards overshoots this point by about half an hour, subjecting his audience to 30 minutes of pointless, unfunny rubbish that contributes nothing to the story and just gives the viewer time to stop and realize that not all of the plot threads were adequately tied off and that Larry Hagman's character vanished somewhere around the middle of the film. Thinking back on some of Blake Edwards' other films, including ""Victor/Victoria"" and ""The Great Race"", I realize that this pattern of making films that start off well but are let down by disappointing endings, is not a one-off occurrence for Edwards and it doesn't exactly encourage me to watch any more of his films.",1224201600,4,2071,4.782122905027933

346232,5,6301706811,"This film is one of Blake Edwards's best films, and it's one of the best films ever made about Hollywood.  It's filled with some of the most memorable dialogue I've ever heard (my favorite line has to be ""you look like 100 pounds of condemned veal""), and it's filled with rich, great performances.  Richard Mulligan (a very underrated comic actor) is perfect as Felix, the great producer who's latest film has bombed, which leads to a nervous breakdown.  He comes up with the scheme of making his film a porno, and buys it back from the studio.  Shelley Winters, Robert Weber, Stuart Margolin, Darrell Vaughn, Loretta Swit, and Larry Hagman all give great performances, but the best ones have to go to Robert Preston, who plays the quack doctor (giving out vitamin shots for everyone, among other things), and William Holden, who plays the cynical yet hilarious Scully (it was his last role).  This film was Blake Edwards's revenge on Hollywood for dissing Darling Lili (which was a bomb and re-edited against his wishes).  It's one of Blake's best films, along with The Pink Panther Strikes Again and Victor/Victoria.  Blake's career died out in the 1990's (with Son of the Pink Panther being his last completed film), but this work reminds us of why he was so good in the first place.  The dialogue is filled with dark, biting humour, and the film really hasn't dated much in its depiction of Hollywood politics.",1189296000,,1414,4.790123456790123

346235,3,6301706811,"In 1981, Blake Edwards teamed up with his wife, Julie Andrews, and a formidable cast of stars (Shelly Winters, William Holden, etc.) to make ""S.O.B.""  The film details the transformation of a big-budget motion picture flop into a huge success.  The road to success for the fictional film, ""Night Wind"" involves many twists and turns which take it to a soft-core porn status(a la ""Last Tango In Paris"".)  The cast performs decently with the material they are given, but ultimately, the film disappoints.  Although this may be what Edwards had intended as the ultimate satire of how things go in Hollywood, the film falls flat in several places.  The over lengthy musical sequences (other than the saccharine-sweet opening sequence), which illustrate the fictional film's transformation bog the movie down...along with several other nearly incoherent plotlines.  Ultimately, Julie Andrews becomes a very unlikable character, and one sympathizes with the Richard Mulligan character.  Loretta Swit provides some laughs as a Hollywood reporter, but overall the film is pretty mediocre.  I honestly think the idea for this film was hatched in Edwards' mind after the severe failure of one of his wife's earlier films, ""Star!""  ""Star!"", which detailed the life of Gertrude Lawrence, was a major motion picture, costing millions of dollars, and happened to include several musical production numbers...and it bombed...royally.  Although ""Star!"" wasn't all that bad, it was released at a time when the nation was changing dramatically (1968) and facing many turmoils. The general public wasn't in the mood for a big musical (directed by the same team that brought us ""The Sound Of Music""), and US knowledge of Gertrude Lawrence was minimal at best.  In an effort to recoup some of its investment, the movie studio severely cut ""Star!"", and even went through the trouble of releasing it under a different name ""Those Were The Happy Times.""  The whole debacle of ""Star!"" is like a blueprint for the script of ""S.O.B.""  Which film do I recommend?  ""Star!""  Julie Andrews has never looked more beautiful, and some of the musical numbers are simply over-the-top.  For a better Edwards/Andrews collaboration, check out 1982's ""Victor/Victoria"", which is fantastic.",1143158400,4,2249,5.275280898876405

SOB is clearly done as a narrative, but you can see some of the elements that later were used in the 'mockumentary' movies of the 90's.  The writing is top-notch and the actors seem to be reveling in their parts.  The scene where Robert Preston explains his occupation to the young lady at the party has to rank as one of the top 10 funniest scenes in the movies.  The story doesn't wander.  Blake Edwards mixes slapstick with dark humor to create a thoroughly enjoyable experience.  It's a shame this doesn't get airplay anywhere that I've been able to see, even with 500 channels to surf through.

The acting is amazing, from Richard Mulligan to Robert Preston, from William Holden to Julie Andrews (who, once and for all buries her Mary Poppins image with a topless scene) to the host of cameos and guest shots by many recognizable 70s and 80s supporting stars.  And the script is as absurd as it is flawless.

True, the film is a little slow at first, but as soon as Robert Preston appears on the scene (around 15 minutes in), the film's pace and humor really picks up. Mulligan was fabulous as the character the other characters interact around - his voice and facial expressions and moments of clarity in his insanity really shine. Everyone else is a complete hoot. Robert Preston has the best dialogue by far, but the movie has a *lot* of good quotes. The satire is sharp - no one is spared. No one is perfect, no one is evil - it's all very human and believable, which contributes to the humor. 'Wacky' definitely applies - this is, after all, a Blake Edwards film - but like The Great Race and Victor/Victoria, a line comes along here and there that take you out of the box and make you think.

346243,4,6301706811,"Well, Julie Andrews DOES bare herself in this movie--which is why some may first want to see it--but this film by her real life husband Blake Edwards (who also brought us The Pink Panther) does have some other very good qualities. The trouble is that the film-and the DVD itself--also have some potentially bad points.
On the bright side, we are treated to excellent performances by some very talented people including Julie Andrews, Richard Mulligan, William Holden, Loretta Swit, Larry Hagman--and more! These actors really worked! The story is comparatively simple: in Hollywood, director Felix Farmer makes a terrific flop of a movie and despite his many previous successes in true Hollywood style the studio, his wife (Julie Andrews) and everyone else are abandoning him. Yes, as another reviewer points out, some people in Hollywood try to shield them from reporters and publicity backlash--but they really don't succeed. Felix tries four times to kill himself until he realizes if they re-shoot the film as some type of pornography flick it will make millions and be the biggest money making film of all time. Everyone is afraid at first of taking the gamble; but they see Felix's idea may just well be right and then they all jump on the bandwagon in a brazen and crude greedy rush. When the film makes it even Felix thinks gleefully of the money it will make as he dies a premature death! The film therefore really lashes out at Hollywood greed and backstabbing. A good reminder to us all of how NOT to behave in life! The characters rush around so deeply concerned about money and JUST money that the film illustrates very sharply how shallow, greedy and cruel Hollywood ""people"" can be.
Then there are the potentially bad points. I say they are potentially bad because not everyone will think they are bad! The film does go downhill a bit because of Edwards' heavy reliance on slapstick to make the film funny. There are, as another reviewer points out, very few exciting extras on this DVD. I agree that it would have been great to have Julie Andrews discussing the scene where she bares her chest as well as her thoughts about the movie in general. An interview with Blake Edwards himself would also have been a really interesting extra.
All in all, this is a movie noteworthy for its attack on Hollywood politics, greed, corruption, game playing manipulation and shallowness. The actors worked their tushies off, too! I was impressed with their fine effort. The humor is fairly good, about a B+ in quality--although if you like slapstick (which is perfectly fine, of course!) then the humor grade goes higher.  Nevertheless, the sound quality could definitely be better and there are few extras, however, so I give this DVD four stars.",1088035200,36,2749,4.861407249466951

This showed a side to her that people who liked her didn't know about, the ""i'm going to be modern and trendy and stay the box office draw, even if i have to bare my breast,"" attitude.  She sings brilliantly in it but her acting is over the top, especially in the confrontation with Felix, when a bloke who's in bed is sick through a whole in the roof on Felixs head. The whole film is boring and over the top sexiness and Richard Mulligan, good actor that he is, does go over the top and starts acting like Jim Carrey on happy tablets.
Generally, i'd say rent it or see it on T.V and if you are a Julie Andrews fan then buy it but other that don't bother.",1059004800,4,857,4.071005917159764
346245,4,6301706811,"Blake Edwards's filmography is quite impressive. This is the man who brought us the Pink Panther films, The Great Race, Victor/Victoria, and 10. Edwards was the king of the 1970s, creating films that blended adult themes with memorably comedic moments. The filmmaker carried this approach into the early 1980s with S.O.B., a black comedy about the backbiting, cynical world that is Hollywood. This 1981 film fields some heavy hitters in its cast: William Holden, Richard Mulligan, Robert Vaughn, Julie Andrews, Robert Preston, Larry Hagman, Loretta Swit, Robert Webber, Stuart Margolin, Shelley Winters, and Robert Loggia all play parts, both big and small, in this movie. Look for a young Rosanna Arquette as one of the hitchhikers Culley (William Holden) picks up on the highway.
S.O.B. is a movie within a movie. Felix Farmer, played with brilliant alacrity by the late Richard Mulligan, never lost money on a picture until ""Nightwind"" came out starring his wife Sally Miles (Julie Andrews). Now Felix is on the outs with his studio head David Blackman (Robert Vaughn), his wife is divorcing him, and he just tried to kill himself. Since this is Hollywood, a whole host of publicists, agents, and advisors try to shield Felix and Sally from the critical backlash. As Felix stumbles around his beach house in a dazed stupor, his friends Tim Culley, Dr. Irving Finegarten (Robert Preston), and publicist Ben Coogan (Robert Webber) all arrive on the scene to lend a hand. Nothing seems to bring Felix out of his funk until he arrives at the realization that the only way to save his career is to reshoot his stinker by having wife Sally, who is a G-rated film queen, bare her all. When it looks like Felix might be on to something, everyone jumps on the bandwagon to make a buck or take some credit for the success.
I had hopes that this film was as funny as it was when I first saw it in the mid 1980s. It isn't, but there are still some great performances along the way. Mulligan is electricity as Farmer, adding even more gusto to his character here then he did as Bert Campbell in ""Soap."" Holden always does a good job as the weary soul that must witness the slow decay of those around him. Preston is great too as Finegarten, whipping out one-liners with great aplomb. The problem I had with the film is that it is almost too sad to watch it. Here are all these great actors giving one last gasp before passing into the great beyond. S.O.B. was Holden's last film, made before he hit his head and bled to death during a drunken binge. Preston died a few years later from lung cancer, and Mulligan died in 2000 from colon cancer. It is difficult, nay impossible, to forget this as you watch the film. The habits of the characters do not make it easier, either. Holden actually plays a drunk in the film, so knowing that he was one in real life makes it a tad painful to see it here played for laughs.
Another problem more noticeable with repeated viewings years later is the schizophrenia of the film. Edwards starts out with a bang, introducing the characters and establishing their quirky traits. After Felix buys the rights to ""Nightwind,"" however, the movie morphs into a farce with slapstick elements. The latter half of the film still delivers laughs (Felix's last words concern bringing in another ten million at the box office, hardly what a normal person would think during their last seconds of life), but it doesn't mesh as well with the scathing first half. Add to this a mediocre DVD transfer, with some haziness and sunburns on people who shouldn't have them, and this adds up to a good, not great, film.
I would have liked to see more extras on this film. While Holden, Preston, and Mulligan are dead and therefore unavailable for comment, Julie Andrews and Blake Edwards are still alive and could have contributed many insights on a commentary track. Hearing Andrews discuss her topless scene would have been worth the price of the movie in and of itself. As it stands, there is a filmography of Blake Edwards plus the trailer for the film and that is about it in the way of treats. Taken as a whole, S.O.B. falls strictly into the ""rent, not buy"" category.",1054771200,7,4177,4.676630434782608
346246,5,6301706811,"I've heard several criticisms of this film for years that, as much as I love this movie, really can't be argued with.
The first is that the main character really isn't a main character: Felix Farmer, the desperate-then-demented producer (played by the great Richard Mulligan) who first appears in wordless attempts at suicide and brief manic scenes before he's dispatched from the movie (and the world).
The other criticism is that the film is ""uneven.""  I think the reason for that is that S.O.B., after assembling a caustic, hilarious ensemble of tinsel town sleazebags, then finds a heart with Farmer's real friends when they try to provide him with a ""real"" funeral--as opposed to the hypocritical circus Hollywood gives him.
So, yes, the film is uneven and the main character seems to spend a lot of time on the periphery, but this is still a great movie about Hollywood from someone who should certainly know about it.
What stays with me is the affection for the actors in the roles they're playing.  William Holden in, sadly, his final role as the alcoholic degenerate director Cully, Robert Preston as the hysterical Dr. Feelgood (""I remember this scene from THE THING...""), and Robert Webber as the hyper press agent with the body function problems.  There are many more funny characters but these guys provide the heart of the film--in their own Hollywood way, of course.

346248,5,6301706811,"When I was younger, the appeal of SOB was seeing Mary Poppins bare her chest.  Well, it's still great.
But when I got older, and really watched this film again, it was the incredible timing and acting chops of the entire cast that blew me away.  The skewering of the Hollywood system this movie delivers is first-rate. It's fascinating seeing a film so greatly crucify the underside of Hollywood, when these days its so common knowledge the incorporation and bureacracy the film industry is.  We have the internet and a million entertainment magazines now, its common knowledge how cut-throat it is.  But in 1981 things were different and when SOB came out, it disappeared quickly it seems.  It was probably too ""inside"" for general audiences to appreciate.  Plus I'm sure the forces that be made sure to not trumpet a film which made fun of the people who brought it to screen.
If you appreciated the 'adult' humor of Blake Edwards other films such as '10', and 'Skin Deep', you must see 'SOB.'  You have veteran actors tackling matters and situations that really apply to being an adult in the adult world.  Mid-life crisis', integrity over indecency, getting older, standing up for principles as society seems to worsen around you...these themes run rampant in Edward's films. Its as though Edwards was the last 'Rat Pack''-ideaology director making movies about loveable drunks and womanizers who's hearts were in the right place, though we watch them comically learn life's lessons through trial and error choices.  Good people dealing with the anxiety of getting older and realizing truths about themselves and the world, good and bad.  But Edward's always presented it with a 'Boy's Club' mentality that, at least for me, made one hope to have such colorful characters as friends as I matured and got older.
To any prospective watcher of the film reading these reviews, I'd suggest one thing per your first viewing.  Pay attention to  the repoire between Felix (the suicidal director) and his cohorts Erving (the doctor), Cully (director friend), and Ben (Felix's wife/Julie Andrew's publicist).  These guys are pros and the timing of the scenes they share is stellar , old-school, drinking pal ensemble acting. Especially as they 1-by-1 come by the beachhouse to see Felix and fall into their routine of spending time together (drinking and one-liners).  These characters were partying Hollywood-style in the 50s and 60s and are now alumni of that classic generation, elders in the world of late 70s early 80s starlets and studios.  They've seen it all and nothing shocks them. And boy do they still keep up.
Just lots of little moments, subtle nuances of comraderie that make this film a gem.
I've spent the last few years anxiously awaiting SOB on DVD, searching and contacting studios,websites, anyone who may have known something but to no avail.  Suddenly one day it was just another title on a DVD site's ""Upcoming Releases."" I was ecstatic.  I hope it looks and sounds as good as I imagine.
Wish Edward's would have done a commentary track for this, like supposedly he's done for 'Skin Deep'.  Then again, maybe since most of the male leads of  the film are deceased, it may have been tough for him to watch and reminisce.",1022112000,79,3237,4.906422018348624
