8433427,4,B004KUEGQU,"This is an identical PAL video format Region 0 release of the NTSC Region 1 version for this title. Made in Germany (2010).
The only differences I can see are this item does not include the 24 page informative booklet and video and audio quality are slightly lower definition. Not bad, just barely noticeable.
I have an NTSC/PAL All Region player because I am Anglophile and most of my PAL discs are superb in quality, especially my Optimum Avengers series 5 & 6 releases.
This is still a great purchase, especially for someone who lives in or visits a PAL region. I bought it out of curiosity and have no regrets.",1480291200,,614,4.54054054054054
