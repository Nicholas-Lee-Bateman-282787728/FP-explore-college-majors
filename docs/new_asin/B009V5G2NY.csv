8644589,4,B009V5G2NY,surprising musical screen play presentation.  Largely as a showcase for songs written by Janis Ian.  But also a pretty set of love stories set in the toxic environment of an All Co Hell pushing place.,1496707200,,200,4.685714285714286
8644590,3,B009V5G2NY,"This is a cute movie but if I wasn't in it I probably would never have seen it. A friend of mine and I are extra's in one of the bar scenes so naturally we had to buy copies for our friends and family. The best you can say is it's a grade B ""chick"" flic. The leading man is handsome and the woman are beautiful, the singing is lovely but the dialogue is trite and the acting could be better. It has won awards so not everyone thinks as I do. Some people will like it and some won't.",1381017600,,482,3.83
8644591,4,B009V5G2NY,"This is a fun movie, a hybrid of a love story, Cinderella story, displaying the trial and triumph of multiple characters. It is a musical and the singers do a wonderful job, by the way. The movie is about second chances and dealing with the bittersweet aspects that life deals out. A scene that sticks out in my mind is where Billy, the employer and ultimate love interest of Jesse first catches on to the allure of her voice. He is in the bathroom clearing the toilet with a plunger while Jesse is singing (lovely!) out in the bar after hours. Soon he is plunging in synchrony to her tune. It was wonderful way to capture the symbiosis of both the mundane and the magic inherent to life! Magnificent! Many surreal and beautiful moments. I give it a thumbs up!!",1353369600,3,761,4.442857142857143
