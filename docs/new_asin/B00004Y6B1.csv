7926551,5,B00004Y6B1,"A touching love story, but don't mistake this as just another ""chick flick.""  Robert Forster is tough as they come when holding his own on the dark side.  Gripping suspense balanced with a passionate love affair. It's been a favorite of mine for many years.",1287532800,5,257,4.688888888888889
