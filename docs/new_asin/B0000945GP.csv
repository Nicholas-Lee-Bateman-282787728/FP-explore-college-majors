7989203,5,B0000945GP,"Absolutely worth every penny!!
Not only are his DVD's kick-butt but he is easy to listen to and nice to look at!
I was completely drawn to Bryan's ability to balance extreme challenge with respect for one's own limits.  He is an outstanding example of Yoga in its truest form. He comes from the heart and it shows through, even in a DVD.
I own a good number of other Yoga DVD's but I use his the most.  It is an incredible workout and a transformative experience if you let it be.",1240272000,,480,4.206521739130435
7989204,5,B0000945GP,"Bryan Kest Power Yoga Series was the first yoga DVD's I tried.  I was hooked on his form of yoga & ruined for any other!  I've tried pretty much all that's out there, Rodney Yee, Ana Singh, Mark Blanchard, to name a few, and keep gravitating back to Bryan Kest.  I've sold countless of these disappointing (to me) DVD's on Ebay. SO, about THIS DVD...., yes it is short and a beginner DVD, but certainly can be modified for the more advanced.  All you need do is extend the poses to your ability.  This is a gem of a workout for those short on time irregardless of your ability.  Highly recommend!!!",1233705600,,598,4.342342342342342
7989205,5,B0000945GP,"I have yet to come across a better 20-minute power yoga practice. Perfect for the mornings you've overslept or if you're an add-on junkie (like myself) trying to squeeze as many workouts as possible into 40 minutes.

In a class-style setting Kest instructs as he moves among the yogis making form corrections and, as he is known for, talking all the while. Although one yogini shows modifications, this is not a true beginner workout. (Novices would do better starting with Yoga Zone's ""Introduction to Power Yoga."") I've been practicing yoga for a little over two years and this one is still in my regular rotation. It's short but intense especially if you substitute more advanced versions of the poses such as a full side plank instead of the one-knee-down modification.

Kest starts of with (surprise!) sun salutations, brisk but nowhere near as rapid as his non-beginner routines. Standing poses include warrior 2 into extended side angle and triangle into the Kest ""airplane,"" as well as a stretching sequence with blown palm and standing forward bend. (Side plank is in there somewhere.) He finishes up on the floor with boat, reverse plank, seated wide-legged forward bend, spinal twists and final relaxation.

Bryan Kest seems to be a love-him or hate-him instructor. He's very easy on the eyes but some complain that he talks constantly and uses superfluous language. Personally, I don't think he talks any more than your average video instructor; he is leading a class after all. I find the constant form pointers to be helpful and the use of imagery deepens my understanding of how my body should feel while keeping the practice playful. Clearly I'm a fan. But those who prefer a strictly athletic approach or who have a conflict of faith may not agree... which is a shame because it's a little 20-minute gem.",1121644800,36,1821,4.925081433224756
7989206,5,B0000945GP,"Great DVD for someone just starting Yoga!  I am 65 and have been strength training in a gym most of my life and really thought I was in great shape.  What a surprise, even this beginning series made me realize how much I need to improve my flexibility, endurance, and strength.  Bryan really breaks it down to my level and has made it so easy to not only understand the move but the reason for each move.  My breathing and flexibility were awful and I am sure this will be the answer to my low back and joint problems as it has already helped me with only a few workouts.  I would highly recommend this DVD to anyone, at any age that wants to improve his or her health and has just starting with Yoga.  As Bryan emphasizes, you don't have to do every move with perfection as that will come with practice and that helped me a lot.  AWESOME BRYAN!!",1117497600,6,846,4.217391304347826
7989207,3,B0000945GP,"Bryan is inspiring and he has a lot of good things to say.  I just wish he would say it in the first session and then let me practice yoga in the rest of the sessions(four included on this DVD).
I've done Yoga on and off for years and recently got into power yoga.  This is waaaaaaaaaaaay to slow and by the time you feel any heat, you are done.  If you are a beginer it would be pefect for about 2-3 weeks and then you'll need to move on to something more.",1060128000,33,457,3.89247311827957
