6345371,5,B00J9EMU06,"This is an elegant film, following in the traditions of ""Nashville"" and ""My Prairie Home Companion."" The characters are diverse and honest, with the camera never betraying their trust. See this movie with your family, which is truly the central theme of ""We Always Lie To Strangers.""",1401753600,2,283,5.042553191489362
6345472,5,B00J9EMU06,Thoroughly enjoyed this beautiful documentary which presents a real view of real people doing what they love and bringing joy to many.  The cinematography was beautiful and the soundtrack compelling.,1402272000,,199,5.633333333333334
6345473,5,B00J9EMU06,"I grew up spending many summers in Branson as a kid in the early and mid 1990's, the boom of Branson, and this documentary was a very entertaining and accurate portrayl of midwestern life. Bravo.",1402272000,,195,4.6
6345474,5,B00J9EMU06,"having been a resident of Branson from 1987 until 2000 and involved in the early growth at Silver Dollar city , then a opener at the Freddy Fender show and having our own gospel show called Homer Hallelu' and Friends....boy howdy did this bring back memories
I believe that the Presleys have done so much for this lil' community...may God continue to bless 'em all !",1402099200,,366,4.5606060606060606
6345475,5,B00J9EMU06,"""Strangers""--which the filmmakers ironically were not--is a meditative portrait of the small tourist town Branson, Missouri, depicting some of its key families. This intimate look at a community severely affected by economic recession, together with a beautifully haunting soundtrack, is what makes the film great.",1401926400,2,314,6.0
6345476,5,B00J9EMU06,"A very smart, incisive commentary on American values and dreams. Beautifully shot, multi-layered story with complex and compelling characters. Everything a documentary strives to be.",1401926400,3,182,6.32
6345477,5,B00J9EMU06,"Family is at the heart of this well-balanced, beautifully shot reflection of Branson, MO. The soundtrack by Mountain Man compliments perfectly. WALTS is a great example of telling several very compelling stories, artfully and honestly.",1401926400,3,235,5.742857142857143
6345478,5,B00J9EMU06,"This is a fantastic documentary about a city that is familiar to millions of people, yet completely unfamiliar to millions of others. Even those who think they know Branson will see at least one different side of it in the course of this movie. That's what makes it so brilliant: It effortlessly weaves together stories of varied, seemingly disparate lives that all coexist in the shared environment of a once rural town that continues to expand into the 21st century as a particularly branded entertainment destination. The portrayals of these lives are done so without demeaning or exploiting their stories, and without preaching any specific message, while simultaneously showing how these individuals are unique linchpins to the foundation of a tourist town that most people only ever see from its highly polished outside.",1401926400,2,826,5.2180451127819545
6345479,5,B00J9EMU06,"What beauty shines for the cameras in this elegant film. One of the most elegant documentaries I've seen in a long time. The characters are engaging and intelligent, each of them working so hard to make a life for themselves doing something they love. The score of the film is mesmerizing. All around, this is a phenomenal movie.",1401926400,,329,4.689655172413793
6345480,5,B00J9EMU06,"My husband and I just got through watching this movie he said ""it was like a painting."". We loved the pace of it, the different side-stories it took, (I personally loved the redhead with the potty-mouth, she was a hoot). I lived in the Ozarks for a while as a teen, and while the speed was a bit too slow for me, I have a lot of good memories and the shots of the Lake are just spectacular. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. The music running throughout was so haunting and lovely.....and yes, you will find out why it's titled as it is.",1401926400,3,536,4.213592233009709
6345481,1,B00J9EMU06,"This documentary focuses on too many things and never gets around to showing or telling its audience what point it is trying to make.  While some reviewers or critics might call this approach ""complex"" or ""realistic,"" it is simply confusing and even boring.  The film maunders on far too long and does not accurately depict citizens of Branson or the Ozarks.  Rather, it focuses on extremes and ignores the norm.  Mustering up the emotion the film hoped to evoke was difficult because my real longing was simply for the film to end.  At times, the film seems to blame conservatives and Christians for many of the characters' problems, but it strained to do so, leaving the connection hard to accept.  As I watched the film, I couldn't help thinking the people it depicted were being exploited and mocked.  I do not recommend this film.",1401753600,5,835,4.756944444444445

8648978,5,B00J9EMU06,"Having been to Branson and seen some of what that culture is like, this documentary helped me understand it a lot better and feel more empathetic toward both performers and visitors than I had before.",1460678400,,200,4.742857142857143
8648979,1,B00J9EMU06,"it's a pretty dull and uncompelling ""slice of life"" documentary about the struggles of small town performers. also, as someone else mentioned, it skips around way too much, probably as a means to mask the films blandness in an attempt to keep you engaged. it could have used some heavy editing, two hours was way too long, and the overall content was pretty unsubstantial: small town mayor with a heart of gold, a multi-generational stage family, and a gay performer reconciling his lifestyle in a conservative climate, yawn nothing too out of the ordinary. would have been more interesting to delve more into the regions heritage or examine the kitsch that seems to permeate everything.

never been to branson, and after watching this, i have no desire to. as a young city slicker myself, i am well aware that i am not the target demographic for any of these acts, but even if i had money to burn and wanted to visit for the sake of its campiness, i doubt i could sit through any of these mediocre performances (which are basically a step above a church christmas pageant, and im being generous here).

would have been nice to interview the audience members and ask them why seeing amateur has-beens in the middle of nowhere was more attractive than say, vegas or nashville in short, id pass on this one. nothing novel, remotely interesting, and did not satisfy my basic curiosity in the least.",1445126400,,1395,4.713114754098361
8648980,1,B00J9EMU06,"Not great. I love Branson, I lived there for several years as a child. It's definitely a place of character with lots of natural beauty. Let me just say there could have been more depth to the story. I remember seeing Barbara Mandrell's name on a marquee sign before she was famous. It was a start for a lot of people...and then an ending place. All with the background of the Ozark hills and a helping of hillbillies. It's an interesting place with lots of history that's not anywhere in this show.",1442966400,,499,4.434782608695652

8648983,2,B00J9EMU06,"If I ever had any curiosity about Branson (which I don't recall having), this film has doused it.  Frankly, I wouldn't sit through any of the shows that are highlighted in this documentary.",1434412800,,189,4.7272727272727275
