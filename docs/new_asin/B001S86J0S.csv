3785062,5,B001S86J0S,"great season.  as usual, Penn & Teller tell it like it is.  nothing slips past them. i will deffinitly be buying any more seasons that come out.",1268092800,,144,4.296296296296297
3785063,5,B001S86J0S,Objective a yet humorous look at issues that effect us every day. I own them all and can honestly say that I learn something new every series. A must have.,1267574400,,155,4.2
3785064,5,B001S86J0S,"The comedy duo debunks some sacred cows with much flair. I thoroughly enjoyed the shows but I must warn you that there is considerable nudity involved. Penn uses the ""F"" word a lot, but that is part of his charm.",1264204800,,212,4.325
3785065,4,B001S86J0S,"As usual, they flay the incompetent non-thinkers. Hard to believe there are actually people out there with so few functioning neurons. Only negative is I think the vulgarity is a bit over done, but hey, that's their style.
Quality of the transfer is good....as long as they keep up the good work, I'll keep buying the series.",1262563200,2,325,4.719298245614035
3785066,5,B001S86J0S,"If you like Penn & Teller, and have any familiarity with this show, you'll definitely want to own this modern classic.",1245801600,2,118,4.666666666666667
3785067,3,B001S86J0S,"Entertaining as always: a mixed season, with some hits and some misfires.

First, forgo new agers for a while.  They are absurd to the point of being impaired.  Season six seems fatigued:  sensitivity, dolphins and the like echo earlier episodes.  Balance becomes an issue for this season, with acrimony working into some material--the Being Green episode was off kilter and strident.

It would be good to see more shows about things we accept as mainstream but do in fact have faulty joints.  Stranger Danger made a bold point that child protection has become Manichean.  The series really hits target with episodes like these.

The writers might consider lightening up on ideology and focusing on deconstructing things commonly accepted, such as the prison system, litigation culture (the root of political correctness), dumbed down reality TV and the like.

Certainly there are enough contradictions out there to re-energize the series.",1242518400,15,939,5.283783783783784
3785068,5,B001S86J0S,"After five great seasons of the perfect show for thinking people, I was doubtful that P&T could keep up the editorial quality for season 6.  Fortunately, I was delightfully mistaken.

You'd think they'd have run out of good subject matter, but that's not the case. This season they tackle such evils as the war on porn, new age medicine, the ""green"" lifestyle, and sensitivity training.

Who else can hold up the collective American condition so effectively, yet be so entertaining?",1242259200,8,482,5.0

8339494,3,B001S86J0S,"Things are winding down at this point for the series (despite there being two more seasons after this one). From here on out, expect about one or two good episodes per season.",1384905600,2,175,4.5

8339499,5,B001S86J0S,"Penn and Teller are one of my favorite comedy acts, and though they may be biased in parts I never get the feeling that they're lying. They do an excellent job with the subjects chosen in season six and I thoroughly enjoyed this season.

Though I don't always agree with them, I do absolutely love watching them, and this DVD does not disappoint in the entertainment factor.",1326672000,,374,4.582089552238806
8339500,5,B001S86J0S,"Ok so the episode list goes as follows: The War on Porn, New Age Medicine, NASA, Dolphins, Sleep Inc, Being Green, Sensitivity Training, Stranger Danger, World Peace and The Good Ol' Days. I thought it was pretty awesome. The only thing that wasn't that great was the episode on doplphins. Even that it was interesting to see how many people are just so crazy in love with them that they forget they are wild animals. The war on porn was a good one. Some women really think that porn objectifies women. Well, I'm a woman and I disagree. I think it's two (or more at times) consenting adults having fun together. I don't see the harm in it. New age medicine...now there's some truly crazy stuff. Like P&T I'll give them that accupuncture might actually do some good in some cases. But the rest of it is just crazy nonsense. The only effect being the placebo effect. NASA? Well, I'm not as bold as them...I don't think I'll touch that one. Sleep, that one was good. I'm with that one expert. You go out, try out a few beds, ignore any and all supposed ""experts"" who tell you that their bed is the best. Lay on a few, see what is comfortable for you and (this is important) within your price range, and choose that one. Overall, it was a great buy and a great series. I love them. Keep on what your doing, guys, and I'll keep buying your series. :)",1297382400,3,1345,4.341269841269841
