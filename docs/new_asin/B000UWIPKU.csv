8611080,5,B000UWIPKU,"If you write ads for radio, TV, newspaper, or any other medium, this will be the most profitable 20 hours of TV watching you've ever experienced.  Professional ad writers and business owners who write their own ads should consider this required viewing.

I am an avid follower of Roy.  I've read all his books, his Monday Morning Memos, I've taken in every video and audio seminar I could find.  They were all extraordinary.  But this DVD set was the smartest career investment I've ever made.  The price isn't cheap, and I was admittedly quite nervous to spend that kind of money.  But I swear on my life it was so, so worth it.  As a media sales rep, I made my $1,000 back within 9 months in the form of increased commissions.  Turns out, advertisers are willing to give you more money, more often, when the ads you write for them actually make them gobs of money.

This series takes you through a the ad-writing process of a man who writes the most persuasive and profitable ads I've ever seen.  The ads drafted and edited to perfection in this series cover a wide range of styles, including transactional & relational ads, and emotional & intellectual ads.  As a quaint little bonus, he throws in some random extra advice when their discussions bring it up, including when you should write story-telling ads vs. information ones to sell a product...that's not something I found in ANY of his other materials, and that single piece of advice reversed the looming failure of one of my then-current annual client campaigns.

Roy shows you how to make the claims in your ads more credible, more persuasive, and more lucrative.  He shows you examples of black words contaminating otherwise good ads, and teaches you how to recognize them and avoid them altogether.  The examples of from a well-selected variety of industries, which demonstrates that when it comes to writing ads, it really doesn't matter what industry you're writing for.  The styles and strategies really don't differ very much at all.

Invest the money, watch this series, write better ads, and watch it again later to keep your chops up...then again and again as you see fit.  Or after your first viewing, maybe just pop in a DVD and watch one ad construction at a time as a form of ongoing ad-writing maintenance.  But don't chicken out because the price if just short of 4 figures.  If it wasn't worth it, Roy wouldn't be selling it at that price.

Yes, Roy is arrogant...you know that if you've seen/heard his group seminar recordings.  Get over it and buy this set.  He's arrogant because he's a tremendous success.  Fortunately, his ego doesn't shine so brightly in this set, because he's not lecturing here, he's actually interacting with other people.

I also recommend you find his other DVD series, ""Secret Formulas School of Advertising"".  It focuses less on ad writing and more on the rest of the things you need to know to make your advertising the very best it can be.

Enjoy!",1377734400,,2958,4.715399610136452
