3119366,5,B0013TR4GK,"BCI Eclipse (the company responsible for the entire He-Man/ She-Ra DVD releases) has just announced the exciting news that the second volume of the 2002 animated series is coming out on DVD on May 27.

Debuting on Cartoon Network in 2002 from Mike Young Productions, the first season of the show ran for 26 episodes (the first 13 were released on Feb 19).  This collection represents volume 2 (there will be 3 total).  Considering the order of the first 13-episoide release, it appears as though BCI is going to keep the continuity of the original airing in which case this collection should contain the following episodes:

Underworld
The Mystery of Anwat Gar
The Monster Within
Roboto's Gambit
Trust
Orko's Garden
Buzz-Off's Pride
Snake Pit
The Island
The Sweet Smell of Victory
Separation
The Council of Evil Part 1
The Council of Evil Part 2

Like all of BCI's incredible releases, the second volume of the 2002 series is slated to be packed with creative staff commentary, bonus materials, and a pair of collector's art cards.  Fans of the series are anxiously awaiting BCI's announcement of the third volume which will consist of the 13 episodes that made up the second (and final) season of this excellent show.",1203292800,15,1218,4.859903381642512

3119390,2,B0013TR4GK,"This package is labeled only ""Volume 2.""  What it doesn't specify is that it is the new release of season 1, volume 2.  However, the episodes it contains are out of order.  It has 20 episodes out of the 65 that were broadcast - mostly the ones from the middle of the season.  So if you already have the entirety of season 1, don't buy this DVD.  THe 2 stars are for the lack of labeling on the package.  I am sending mine back since I already own all of season 1.  I don't own season 2 and am not the type to worry about the whole BCI to Mill Creek thing that has been mentioned in other reviews of He Man and She Ra DVD's. I watch the shows and don't really care about extras.  If you do care about extras, then you should read the other reviews.",1298678400,14,747,3.966442953020134
3119391,5,B0013TR4GK,"In this volume you get to see TWO-BAD before being TWO-BAD...2 individual hunters with different names refering to their later name that Skeletor united for a failure. In the old series TWO-BAD was already TWO-BAD, & there wasn't any reason for it. Plus you get to see STINKER & who he was before being STINKER. An action figure from  that never made it in the old series, here you get to see him several times. & so on & on are new introductions to new Masters of the universe. It didn't even crossed my mind that SYKLONE was oriental,cause in the old series he wasn't & it wasn't even explained his origin. The series still focus on HE-MAN VS. SKELETOR but with some new & interesting inductions that never made it in the old series.",1256860800,2,735,4.444444444444445
3119392,5,B0013TR4GK,"I really like the take this cartoon has on the He-Man story.  I think it's better than the original in terms of animation, action and story telling.  I wish this series hadn't gotten canceled when it was just hitting it's stride.",1250726400,,229,4.560975609756097
3119393,5,B0013TR4GK,"This set has some of the lighter episodes like those from volume 1, but also builds more complex back stories based them.  I've seen this entire series at least three times through since the original TV airings, and they just keep getting better.  This particular volume seems the weakest of the three, but it plays such an important role in the 2002 mythology that I can't fault this set for anything at all.  What can I say, it's an awesome dvd set.  Whether it's Roboto's or Stinkor's origin - or you just want to see Skeletor finally make an intelligent power play for Eternia... this set has some great stories.

By this volume, your knowledge of classic and 2002 MOTU is not necessarily needed, BUT being versed in the mythology is consistently rewarded with amazing tidbits in every episode.  If this series was your first experience with Masters of the Universe, then it won't hit you the same way as the boy or girl who grew up seeing the characters / toys / comics / etc. of classic He-Man and She-Ra.  These are not stand alone episodes for small kids to just view casually... no, these are the episodes that build and provide the groundwork for future darker stories in Volume 3.  And oh by the way, anytime these episodes are labeled as a multipart story - prepare yourself, these are usually the most shocking.  For fans of the classic series, the 2002 series is a MUST SEE.

And of course, the extra features are just as fun to watch as the show itself.  The creative team behind this series did an amazing job - because they are as much fans as the viewers.  BCI similarly devoted a great deal of attention into this DVD set, art cards, and packaging.  Only thing negative I can say is that this series is way too short.  Once I start watching volume 1, I then have to watch 2 and then watch 3.  I really hope that new interest in He-Man toys will lead to more of the 2002 storyline - I would even settle for a direct to DVD movie.",1239494400,,1947,4.399441340782123

I loved the 80's cartoon, and I like this one better. Imagine that!!

I saw a few episodes of this new series on cartoon network and i was immediately hooked. Great animation, some characters that never showed up in the original are here and their looks have improved. I only waited 2 weeks and a couple of days, my fear was that it might not get here but it did. I'm going to place my order for volume 3 vs SNAKE MEN right now. I'll eventually buy the first volume, even though we all know there is a flaw in one of the episodes, some minutes missing. But the first 3 origin episodes are worth the package, and what a package it is. TO THE GUYS WHO CREATED THIS SHOW, please make another volume/season, even if its direct to dvd.

Its a shame this cartoon didn't run for over a 100 episodes like its predecessor.",1214697600,,317,4.660714285714286
3119421,5,B0013TR4GK,Many people likes to compare the Cartoon Network version of He-man with the classic Filmation version. I think they both stand up on their own legs for equal greatness. What I like about this version is the rich history they give practically all not just a few of the characters. Especially the episode The Power of Greyskull that finally gives the history of the castle itself which I had expected The Secret of the Sword to do when I was a kid. While many people I guess didn't like the fact that Cringer didn't talk in the cartoon network version I would like to remind people that in all of the Filmation He-man's flashbacks with kitten Cringer he also didn't talk and his ability to do so was probably brought about by one of Orko's spells. Since CN had planned to do a chapter on Hordak if they had lasted another season the only disappointment I had would be the fact they never talked about the queen's earth history.,1212192000,,925,4.479289940828402

Now w/ kids, I got some of the old 80's box sets and love them.  Then I bought Vol. 1 of the 2002 series and it's totally awesome.  Got this one the day it was released and already watched it w/ my little guy.  It is very well animated and super cool.  I recommend this to anyone.

3119423,4,B0013TR4GK,"The planet Eternia is the battleground for the ultimate clash of good versus evil in the animated adventure series ""He-Man and the Masters of the Universe"". When the evil sorcerer Skeletor and his fearsome henchmen break through the great barrier around Snake Mountain to once again threaten all of Eternia, the headstrong Prince Adam must fulfill his true destiny and wield the Sword of Power to become the mighty champion He-Man. Guided by the Sorceress of Castle Grayskull, He-Man leads his fellow warriors against the evils that plagued Eternia. ""He-Man and the Masters of the Universe"" is a very amusing remake of the 1980s cartoon favorite based on Mattel's successful toy franchise.

The 2002 adaptation shares many similarities to the 1980s original but its stories, action and characters are well updated for a new generation of viewers. The 3-disc DVD set includes such highlight episodes like ""Trust"", ""Orko's Garden"", ""Snake Pit"", ""The Sweet Smell of Victory"" and the two-parter ""Council of Evil"".

Pick up a heavy dose of heroics with ""He-Man and the Masters of the Universe: Volume Two"". All 13 episodes are presented in 1.78:1 anamorphic widescreen format and include the never-before-seen end of episode morals. The DVD features a fantastic video transfer with vivid colors.

I also agree that there should be subtitles/CC on the dvds. I'm not hard of hearing or anything, but I like to have that to make sure that I don't miss (or misunderstand) anything. I was most disappointed that they didn't have that.

Btw, does anyone know how many volmues this series will have? Thanks!",1208217600,,410,4.189873417721519

3353922,4,B0013TR4GK,"I too am an '80's child and grew up with He-Man. I still have most of the original figures I got as a kid.
I also agree that there should be subtitles/CC on the dvds. I'm not hard of hearing or anything, but I like to have that to make sure that I don't miss (or misunderstand) anything. I was most disappointed that they didn't have that.

Btw, does anyone know how many volmues this series will have? Thanks!",1208217600,,410,4.189873417721519
