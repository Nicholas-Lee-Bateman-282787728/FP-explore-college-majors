8282704,4,B001BDPMYE,"This is a typical 60s Hercules movie, with fairly good acting and scenery.  The quality of the movie is ok, but really nothing to write home about.  However, this is probably the best copy currently available.  The movie disk and case were in good condition, and the sender managed to get it to me in minimal time after ordering, despite the lousy postal service in my area.  I highly recommend the seller as an excellent trading partner.",1268265600,,438,4.64935064935065
8282705,5,B001BDPMYE,"This film is so much better than the usual Hercules movies. It's really similar in story to the Russell Crowe film ""Gladiator"". It's almost a peak at ancient history. Fun stuff!",1238803200,3,177,4.741935483870968
8282706,5,B001BDPMYE,"This is more of a glatiator movie than a Hercules movie, similar in many ways to Russell Crow's Gladiator. Caligula captures a fighter named Glaucus, played by the rugged Richard Harrison, during a raid in Britain. Glaucus is brought back to be a gladiator. Enter the beautiful Messalina, whom has her own power hungry agenda. Overall a great adventure flick.",1213920000,5,359,5.0
