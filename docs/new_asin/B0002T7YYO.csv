2119131,4,B0002T7YYO,"Okay, first, I have to admit that I haven't made it through all 37 shows in this set, so all I can say about the transfers is....so far, they are excellent. Other non-studio companies packaging television programs would learn a lot to follow the lead of Rhino. They include all intro and outro sequences, and are the full program, as originally broadcast.

The one thing that distracts from this being a 5 star set is the packaging. This is the worst packaging job I have seen yet of a season set. The single DVD plastic keep-case, with a hinged 2-DVD insert is just plain cheap. Not only that, it promotes the damage of the discs...including the fact that one of the dual-sided discs rests on the mount for the third disk (which is stored on the back flap of the case).

The insert is a simple cardboard one....no booklet detailing the different episodes, or giving any additional information. Just a list of the shows.

Also, a menu of the episode selections would have been greatly appreciated. The only choices on the main menu are ""Play All"" and ""Scene Selections"". In order to choose an episode, you must page through the ""Scene Selections"" and choose the beginning scene of the desired episode.

Another note....when an episode concludes, the viewer is not sent back to the menu, but instead, the next episode starts playing.

Rhino really gets an ""A"" for releasing this show, and for it's video transfers (not only the quality, but that they are in their entirety).

Unfortunately, they are prevented from getting 5 stars by their poor menu programming, and the packaging which doesn't protect the disks.

Still, if you are a fan of classic TV, this set is still well recommended.",1099267200,93,1688,4.7406143344709895
2119132,5,B0002T7YYO,"Before Mork (Orkan) and ALF (Melmacian) came to Earth and moved in with their humans, Los Angeles Sun reporter Tim O'Hara (Bill Bixby) took in a Martian (Ray Walston) as his ""Uncle Martin"". The series ranks up there with Mr. Ed on the laugh-o-meter. Viewers who only know Bill Bixby from his more dramatic role as Dr. David Banner from TV's The Incredible Hulk will be floored by Bixby's incredible sense of comedic timing. The show also received solid support from Pamela Britton as Tim's befuddled landlady Mrs. Lorelei Brown and Alan Hewitt as suspicious Detective Bill Brennan. Unlike previous Rhino ""Martian"" DVDs, this Rhino Home Video release of My Favorite Martian - The Complete First Season, features all 37 original, uncut episodes on 3 discs.

2119147,5,B0002T7YYO,"Tim O'Hara (Bill Bixby) is a young Midwesterner who relocated to California after college and became a reporter for the Los Angeles Sun.  One day, assigned to cover an attempted supersonic test flight, he oversleeps, and while he's still on his way to the base, the plane is passed like I was standing still by a UFO.  The base CO, not wanting to foster another UFO story, refuses Tim any information about the flight when he arrives, and Tim has no choice but to get off the base.  On his way home, *something* screams by overhead and crashes in the brush by the roadside.  When Tim goes to investigate, he finds a small one-man spacecraft and its pilota very humanoid Martian (Ray Walston).  Seeing that the Martian is badly shaken by the crash, Timwithout any thought of broadcasting his findtakes him home to the three-room apartment he rents over a double garage belonging to Mrs. Lorelei Brown (Pamela Britton).

Thus begins an unusual friendship.  To fend off the curious, Tim presents his guest as my Uncle Martin.  Since the spaceship was badly damaged by the crash, and its repair will require assorted elements and devices that Earth hasn't discovered yet, he hides it in the padlocked bay of the garage and offers the Martian the hospitality of his home.  He learns that the Martian civilization is very advanced (about 30,000 years ahead of Earth) and that Martians have a long slate of fascinating powersamong other things, Martin can read minds, understand animal languages, levitate just about anything by pointing his finger, and vanish by extending a pair of silvery antennae.  He's also 450 years old and a professor of anthropology specializing in this primitive planethe's been visiting since at least Shakespeare's day.

Before long the two have grown genuinely fond of each other, though their relationship is fraught with problems--everything from Martin's odd ailments (like the time he comes down with VDM-974, or Vitamin Deficiency in a Martian, or gets a toothache in his eye tooth and it affects both his vision and his levitational powers), his attempts to get back home (either by repairing his spaceship or hitching a ride in someone else's), and the difficulties of protecting the truth about his identity (how do you apply for a driver's license if you're a Martian and Martians don't have fingerprints?).  They also have to and fend off the attentions of the widowed Mrs. Brown, who finds Martin very attractive.  But they also learn from each other--Martin introduces Tim to both hard science and high culture, and Tim helps Martin to understand humans and discovers such truths as that trying to change yourself into something you're not for someone else's sake will never lead to happiness.  Of course the whole thing is played for laughs, but there are also morals hidden in the scripts (many of the episodes were written and/or directed by James Komack, with whom Bixby would team in the following decade for ""The Courtship of Eddie's Father""), and at root it's the story of a friendship--how it develops and grows and how important it becomes to both the parties.",1439769600,,3104,4.921455938697318

I am glad that RHINO made them available, but unfortunately making the DVDs two sided instead of one sided was a disappointment since it is difficult to handle the discs without fingerprinting them. After reading the ""not so good"" reviews of the second season of My Favorite Martian from RHINO on Amazon's reviews, I put off purchasing anymore RHINO DVDs. MPI did a much better job for the price of the third season of MFM and hope MPI will make the first two seasons available even though I already have the first season.

2119176,4,B0002T7YYO,"Family based comedies in the 1950's typically featured normal, almost picture perfect nuclear families.  Heading into the 1960's this would change radically, as all kinds of whacky permutations of the family unit began to appear on television.  The decade would see programs like Bewitched (1964-72), The Addams Family (1964-66), The Munsters (1964-66), and I Dream of Jeannie (1965-70), become hits.  But ahead of this group of eclectic shows, was My Favorite Martian (1963-1966).

Created by Jack Chertok, the program was about a Martian scientist, whose spacecraft crash lands on Earth.  Marooned, the dazed alien is discovered by Tim O'Hara (Bill Bixby), a newspaper reporter, who takes him into live in his home, under the pretense that the alien is his ""Uncle Martin O'Hara"".  Compared to earthmen, the Martian has strange and unusual powers, including the ability to become invisible, read minds, and levitate objects using his right index finger.

The tone of the program is mostly light-hearted and innocuous as Tim and Uncle Martin learn to live together, and help each other deal with various situations, usually in a humorous way.  Reoccurring themes include Tim's romantic adventures, Martin's issues with various Earthly customs and agencies, situations related to Tim's job, Martin's various illnesses and maladies, that often have strange consequences, and Martin's attempts to repair his spacecraft and return home.  Semi-regular characters include Pamela Britton as Mrs. Lorelei Brown, Tim's landlady who lives next door, and J. Pat O'Malley as Tim's boss at the newspaper, Mr. Burns.  Britton is quite charming, as the ultra-friendly, but slightly daffy neighbor with a heart of gold.

The show features a nice mix of character actors from the period, including a number of budding starlet types, intended to capture the fancy of the handsome Tim O'Hara.  Bill Bixby is almost always charming, the kind of guy almost any girl would be interested in, either as a friend or lover.  The multitalented Ray Walston, brings just the right amount of mirth to the role, so as to not come off as completely ridiculous.  It takes some skill to carry off what is essentially a gag, and Walston does it quite well.  Together, Bixby and Walston make a marvelous team.

My Favorite Martian has a relatively low key, adult approach.  Although often subjected to stress, Tim and Martin don't do much yelling, or running around like maniacs.  They have some bad moments, but are very much a team working for a common goal.  This would become more evident in the second season when Bill Brennan (Allan Hewitt), a police detective, joined the cast as Mrs. Brown's boyfriend.  The suspicious Brennan, would be a constant threat to Martin and Tim.

The program also featured some special effects and camera tricks, that would later become quite common in programs like Bewitched, and I Dream of Jeannie.  Another cool aspect was the music, including George Greeley's catchy and unorthodox theme, and the strange science fiction inspired sound effects, produced by a device known as the electro-theremin.

Back in the early 60's, the television season was an extremely long grind, and there are 37 black and white episodes in season one.  With so many programs, producing high quality stories, particularly in an experimental series such as this, was a major challenge.  While most of the episodes are fun and entertaining, it is not unexpected that there are also a few that miss the mark.  Although quite silly at times, My Favorite Martian remains a very enjoyable show about a very special friendship.  Image quality of the DVD's is soft at times, but not too bad for a program of this age.

The versatile Bixby would later star in the television series The Courtship Of Eddie's Father (1969-72), and also as David Banner in The Incredible Hulk (1978-82).  Bixby appeared in several Hulk movies, and also became a director mostly working in television.  He was only 59 at the time of his untimely passing due to cancer in 1993, when he was working as a director on the TV series Blossom.",1295136000,7,4088,5.058208955223881

2119182,5,B0002T7YYO,"Telepictures Corporation AmericanLife TV Network is showing the third season of ""My Favorite Martian"" through the help of Warner Bros. Television.  Every other week they are showing each episode in their original format as it was in the fall of 1965 to the spring of 1966 in color.  One week a 1965 color episode then the following week a B&W 1964 to 1965 second season episode and then follow by another third season episode.

I don't know if Warner Brothers is running a test to see what kind of a response it will get but it might led to a new re-release of all three season by Warner Brothers.  They may only release it on HD-DVD's but only the future will tell.

I am only guessing about all of this because of them televising the series only on one channel in a very large number count.  I do not have HDTV, so if they are televising this series on those channels I have no way of knowing.  My DVR makes it possible to search through all of the channels that I receive a program.  This is how I found My Favorite Martian on one station out of 1000 channels with the exceptions of HDTV.

The show is being televised once a week.  There is a repeat of the same episode at midnight but the new one does not come on until the following Friday.

In my own personal view, I doubt that ""Rhino"" will ever release the third season.  So, if you can capture it on TV go for it.",1179187200,2,1372,4.234615384615385

All 37 season one episodes are presented in beautiful black & white, no colorization here. The video transfer is really clean and crisp and the sound is decent albeit in mono. In my opinion the packaging is really kind of cheap for this 3 disc set and Rhino didn't include any kind of episode booklet to accompany the set. I don't think Ray Walston ever got the recognition he deserved as an actor and season one reminded me of his ability to act. Season one is still funny after all these years and it's a treat to finally own it on DVD. Thanks Rhino!

2119205,5,B0002T7YYO,"I have only watched 5 episodes so far, but have enjoyed them. The show isn't hilarious like ""I Love Lucy"" (eg Vitameatavegamin episode) and I would probably term it a drama/comedy rather than a straight out comedy.

The picture and sound quality is excellent. I would prefer single sided disks to double sided disks (disk 3 is single sided), just necessitates getting out the white cotton gloves!!!

I would also have preferred if they had spent a few cents more on the packaging so that disks 2 and 3 weren't back to back.  However if you are careful when handling the dvds it technically shouldn't be a problem.

I have noticed two inconsistencies so far:

Tim and Uncle Martin apparently live upstairs, however the image  outside his living room window shows a house at street level.  Technically the view from the window, from inside the room, shouldn't include the side-walk and fence of the neighbours house (well at least not at the angle shown).

Episode 5 (Man or Amoeba).

This episode should have been episode 2 (or closer to the beginning) because Tim questions that Uncle Martin is from Mars, and is surprised when he disappears and puts up his antenna.  I think it was Episode 3(?) when Uncle Martin had a cold and he kept disappearing and putting up/down his antenna.  Thus (technically) Tim would have known about these two abilities.  Maybe they did a cut and paste of an unused scene from an earlier episode and inserted it into Episode 5?

So did Astronaut Gordon Cooper and so have many AF and Commercial Airline Pilots.  Don't let the conservatives fool you and lead you astray from the truth.

The pilot episode of My Favorite martian is based on a real UFO report at Edwards AFB in 1962.  Time Magazine reported on July 27, 1962 that while test flying the X-15, Major Bob White saw a UFO outside his window.  he said, ""There are things out there.  There absolutely is.""

2119208,5,B0002T7YYO,"Rhino did a great job with this black and white 1963 show. (The third season was in color). It's on two two-sided discs and one one- sided disc in a single width DVD package. Given deluxe packaging like Futurama and The Simpsons, it could have been five one-sided discs in a slipcase. But no one thinks retro TV will sell, so it's packaged less expensively to appeal to a lower market niche. That's why shows like Burns and Allen, The Beverly Hillbillies, and Petticoat Junction are hard to find except in budget, no-frills versions, often without the original themes (since the DVD manufacturer didn't license them).

Enter Rhino, one of the few companies with any sense of how to make good DVDs and with any interest in black and white TV. Rhino gets what TV execs don't: we really aren't watching their highly- rated new shows. We really don't care about the Nielsen ratings. Many of us don't have cable, and we really are buying these retro DVDs. And we do want deluxe packaging and well-done transfers. Thanks to Rhino for preserving TV history. They even have the pilot, which got this show off to a good start. However, it immediately sinks to same old sitcom fare, only slowly beginning to develop the show from the characters, and only later hit its stride. But this was arguably the first fantasy sitcom (Unless you count Topper), preceding Jeanie and Bewitched. Like so much of the memorable TV of the time, it was filmed at Desilu Studios, produced by Sheldon Leonard and bankrolled by Danny Thomas and Andy Griffith.

Sitcoms then were not the anything for a laugh shows they later became, and the shows writers ponder profound questions and dabble in drama. Tim and his alien uncle wrestle with the problems of the day, offer the occasional insight, and rebound with unsinkable optimism. Pamela Britton is outstanding as supporting actress, with far better chemistry than the ""crackpot neighbor"" foils for Bewitched. Early on Bill Bixby and Ray Walston are both stiff and awkward, and we are very much aware that they are acting, but as they settle into their roles, an easy camaraderie develops. Everywhere abounding with joy and good humor, this buoyant show echoes the underlying theme of early '60s sitcoms, in the title of an earlier show by Fulton Sheen, that ""life is worth living.""",1115769600,37,2303,4.813131313131313

He plays a character that is very likable you could say he's ""everyone's Uncle"". The guys' bond is a shining example of friendship. Despite their differences they always reconcile. I can't wait for Season 2. The quality is great!",1114732800,5,337,4.451612903225806
2119211,5,B0002T7YYO,"I decided to wait and watch the entire season before writing anything, since I don't like reviews of something this size which are done after watching only part of the set.

The Show Quality is superb. Where-ever they got the original tapes from, they were  either high  quality, or have been cleaned up very well . About the only down-side to this is that you can see the wires fairly clearly at times when Uncle  Martin ""Levitates""  any objects. One would have thought that they could have digitally removed the  wires for this package.

Anyways, for what was probably a low budget series, the scripts are what make this show. The Sets are great, and the acting is first rate, with a known Character  Actor, Ray  Walston , who did TV and films from 1954, and probably stage as well ( I suspect). Bill Bixby was, it seems a relative unknown, starting in 1959, though he did work solidly in TV, and had a definite  stage history prior to 1959.

So, it is evident that they worked well together, and the quality of the performances are excellent.

This is a set of 37 original, and mavelously  entertaining  shows that  in my view are timeless. The Packaging could quite easily  be improved upon in later releases, but all that is trivial. Just having these shows on crystal clear DVD is great, and brings back many fond memories of a much beloved TV show.",1108684800,7,1355,4.537190082644628
2119212,5,B0002T7YYO,"My favorite Martian is one of my favorite series! I think it's great that they cut costs so that the set could be made affordable to fans. 37 episodes that's less than a dollar an episode!

It looks fantastic. No special features but I never watch them myself. Another reveiwer complained about the packaging. I like that it is compact. Personally I need to conserve space for my ever expanding collection of DVD's. The other reviewer felt the packaging could damage the discs but they look perfectly secure to me.

One other personal comment I think it's wonderful that each episode starts up on it's own and doesn't go back to the main menu until the disc is finished. I really really can't stand the discs that go back to the main menu after ever episode!!! I've often wondered why anyone would design a disc that did that.

All in all it is a wonderful set!",1104278400,6,861,4.506410256410256

8031620,5,B0002T7YYO,"A lot of things happened in 1963.  Kennedy's assassination, the Beatles, Mercury space project ended, Soviets put the first woman in space and Studebaker ends production.  One thing that seldom makes the list is the beginning of My Favorite Martin.  Ray Walston plays ""Uncle Martin"", a Martian stranded on Earth after a narrow miss with a NASA spaceflight.  Crashlanding near Los Angeles, Martin is picked up by newpaper reporter Tim O'Hara (played by a VERY YOUNG Bill Bixby).

This series is long before Industrial Light and Magic make special effect everyday occurrences.  Here our special effects are limited to Uncle Martin's telescoping rabbit ear antenna from his head and his ability to disappear on command.  These were big news effects of the time and honestly, they looked good.

Season 1 has Tim and ""Uncle Martin"" in a variety of hijinks.  Many times these occurrences leave Tim with, as they used to say on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-Love-Lucy/dp/B013FCLEIG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I Love Lucy</a>&nbsp;""'Splaining to do"".
