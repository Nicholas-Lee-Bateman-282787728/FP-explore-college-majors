8337400,2,B001R4KQEI,"This DVD is just OK.....meh. I was hoping against hope that the other reviewers were wrong, because I love Bollywood, bhangra and dancing. What could go wrong with that, I asked myself. THE SOUND. Kinda hard to have a workout DVD with horrible sound. I don't even mind the fact that it was a bit repetitious because how else am I going to get the moves down, but I can't get past the sound! Very muddled, sounds like something done with homemade equipment. I played it once, and ever since, it sits on my shelf. Maybe I can repurpose the disc for something......",1442275200,,562,4.466019417475728
8337401,2,B001R4KQEI,"I bought this DVD expecting that the ""Bollywood"" moves in this DVD would be like the dance moves from Sarina Jain's TV show. Well, it was not. It was the same 2 or 3 dance moves and that was it.....for the ENTIRE DVD. It was really disappointing.",1420243200,,246,4.25531914893617
8337402,5,B001R4KQEI,Great workout video. Great music. Will definitely buy anything and everything Sarina Jain.,1417392000,,90,6.0
8337403,4,B001R4KQEI,Love the music and dance moves. I didn't give it five starts because it seem really repetitive in all the sections and the video is split in sections. I wish the video was just 50 mins straight and not broken up in sections,1402617600,,223,4.209302325581396
8337404,5,B001R4KQEI,"Fun and energetic moves and music - Saraina Jain's enthusiasm and energy are contagious.  I was smiling within the first few seconds, even though I was tired and cranky before starting.  The moves are pretty easy to learn, and it definitely gets your heart rate up.  Enjoy!",1272412800,,273,4.76595744680851
8337405,5,B001R4KQEI,"For a month, I worked out to the Masala Bhangra show that was aired on Fit TV. Some how my DVR lost the recording, and I was so bummed. When this DVD arrived, I got really happy! I had missed Bhangra for a week. After doing the workout for 3 weeks, I noticed that my thighs and arms were both more toned than they had been. I love the dance moves and the fun and fast pace that Sarina pushes you to do. This video is slightly different than the show that I had. It's got some of the same moves and a few new moves that I easily picked up after doing the work out only twice. Plus, there are tutorials on the moves that you can watch to pick them up. This work out is great for anyone who has a small place to work out in. I do it every morning in my living room, and have never had an issue with feeling confined or cramped.  Get yourself a few small scarfs and tie them on your fingers and go for it~ You won't regret it.",1268352000,6,922,3.878306878306878
8337406,5,B001R4KQEI,"This DVD was fabulous. Whilst billed as a Bollywood-leaning dance workout it is still mainly Bhangra but it is an absolute treat. Sarina seems more relaxed filming in India with her Indian dance crew. Her passion for her dance and culture shine through. Each of her crew dances with a different nuance in style which adds to the possibilities when doing this DVD repeatedly. The step guide is direct, clear and ordered. [Be sure to learn it first]. The routines are divided into three blocks then combined in the ""jam"" at the end so you can vary the length and intensity of your session. The moves are fun, most of them were new to me, and while they were not as high impact as in her Vol. 3 DVD there was plenty to spend energy on! I smiled right through this one ... there is a feeling of celebration and joy throughout. It's at the top of my pile and will stay there.",1262822400,2,870,4.343558282208589
8337407,5,B001R4KQEI,"I love the video, I danced ""traditional"" styles for 14+ years and recently fell in love with Indian dancing! I found other instructors that I liked then ran across Sarina Jain's video! I'm thankful I took a chance and got the video! It isn't like the other videos where I get bored after 2 times watching it! You can actually dance, I love the fact that unlike other videos she puts the steps together and all the ""block"" together at the end! You can make it as easy or as challenging as you want depending on your level of fitness. You do need to be able to catch onto dance moves quite quick but is so worth it if you can't it's a GREAT FUN workout!! I laugh and love it, I'm smiling through the whole workout!! And even on those days I don't' want to workout, I'm glad I did it!!! I just ordered two more of her videos and can't wait until they come in..... She is also coming into my state not to far so I plan on taking the class and can't wait!!!!!!!!!!",1251417600,5,959,4.133689839572193
8337408,3,B001R4KQEI,"I love masala bhangra. It's a great workout and it's a LOT of fun. I take classes in person at my gym and thought doing the workout at home would be a good way to improve my skills.

However, if I were not familiar w/these moves because of my gym class, I would have a hard time just keeping up with the video. This one does not slow down to demonstrate the moves clearly enough for a beginner. Maybe it's okay to just wing it and try to keep up; maybe you'll get it eventually... but I could use a little clearer instruction.

Beyond that, it's a fun and exhilarating workout!<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Back-2-Bollywood-Full/dp/B001R4KQEI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Back 2 Bollywood (Full)</a>",1249430400,4,737,5.2905982905982905
