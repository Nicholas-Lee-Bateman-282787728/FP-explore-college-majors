6249452,3,B00I462Y1K,"Firstly, this is not really a sequel to the first one; it is instead a series of skits, three per episode, with virtually no continuity
between episodes, or even the skits themselves. There is no narrative flow. On the plus side, the skits themselves are
often quite funny, with plenty of fan service to liven up the show.

On the subject of fan service, it fits in with the comedic scheme. What would be annoying in an action series is acceptable
in a lightweight comedy series, which this is (and, I believe, was all it was intended to be). Clearly one of Lala's inventions
for this second season was Mr. Breast Reduction, because she is much more pleasingly proportioned in ""Motto"" than the
top-heavy heroine of the first season.

There again was no English dub with my copy, but the subtitles were much less rapid-fire in this one, which made it easier to
follow.

In summary, buy this one if you're looking for light entertainment; just don't expect it to advance the story much.",1428019200,3,984,4.64367816091954

6249457,3,B00I462Y1K,"I'd like to warn that this is not dubbed in English only subbed. Not a big deal for some but I like to see both versions and make up my mind. This is also half as long as the first one.
If you liked the first one you'll like this my biggest issue is you just don't get much for the price. Id wait till it drops in price this is becoming a pattern with Sentai trying to save a buck everywhere they can.
I'll let better writers describe the story I just wanted to make sure everyone knew that the description was wrong.",1401321600,7,517,3.980769230769231
8639097,4,B00I462Y1K,Didn't really know what to expect from this anime (I knew of it) but never actually seen any of it and for the price I got it used I figured I might as well get it.
