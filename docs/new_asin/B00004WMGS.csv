7925743,5,B00004WMGS,"The German General skit, Sid's ability to ""speak"" German is very funny.  This technique is used by many old school comedians, I once heard Don Rickles ""speak"" Chinese, as if to order some Chinese food.  If you are a fan of comedy, you must have this tape/dvd.  Thanks.",1405209600,,268,4.541666666666667
7925744,3,B00004WMGS,"Inside the Writer's Room gives the writers themselves a little chance to talk about what life was like behind the show.  Now mind you when I say a little time, it's only a little because the whole movie is just around an hour in length.

However, you still get the benefit of hearing Woody Allen, Mel Brooks, and the rest including Caesar himself.  Also, a few of the sketches were thrown in as well, but only about three or four of them.

I have nothing against Sid Caesar or his comedy.  My only problem is that if I were an avid fan of Caesar's comedy then I would want a longer film with more information about the process, instead of just a few tidbits.

Still for the dedicated fan I'm sure they'd be pleased, otherwise this probably isn't that good of an introduction to Caesar.",1104710400,2,785,4.379310344827586
7925745,5,B00004WMGS,"It is great that we are finally able to see some of the classic comedy moments from the two greatest sketch comedies of television's golden age, ""Your Show of Shows"" and ""Caesar's Hour.""  Both of these 1950s shows starred Sid Caesar and his great ensemble cast of the late, great Imogene Coca, Carl Reiner, Howard Morris, and many others.  This second volume in ""The Sid Caesar Collection"" makes a point of focusing on the talented writing staff Caesar put together, which included Carl Reiner, Neil Simon, Larry Gelbart, Woody Allen and Mel Brooks.  Sketches on this DVD include ""The German General,"" ""Boy at First Dance,"" ""The Sleep Sketch,"" ""Aggravation Boulevard,"" ""Chita Rivera and Jack Cole in 'What Is Jazz?"" and ""The Hickenloopers.""  These sketches, selected by Caesar personally, are digitally remastered from the original kinescopes.  To add to the fun, interviews with the cast members are writers serve as the introductions.  The main thing is that these sketches are as hilarious as you always heard they were.",1000252800,5,1023,5.095808383233533
