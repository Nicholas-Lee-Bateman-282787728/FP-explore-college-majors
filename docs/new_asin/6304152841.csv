798696,5,6304152841,It is decent and cool. Melissa Joan Hart is a good actress. I recommend that everyone buy it. You'll love it.,1383264000,,109,4.238095238095238
798697,3,6304152841,"I don't know what to think of this one, to be honest. I'm not exactly in their demographic. This movie preceded the TV series, and comes off as more of a light teen drama. An altogether different tone. There are major character differences, as well; Salem has a funny (not ha-ha) accent, and Hilda, Zelda, and Harvey are all played by different actors than their television counterparts. Sabrina is, of course, Melissa Joan Hart. One actress, Michelle Beaudoin, who plays Marnie, returned for the first season of the show as Sabrina's friend, Jenny.",1364256000,,549,4.913978494623656
798698,5,6304152841,This is a good movie for my grandchildren.  They find it entertaining and choose it fairly often.  The price could have been a little cheaper.,1359331200,,142,4.64
798699,5,6304152841,this is a family favorite we watch every year so i know it will be used often and it is so funny you will love it too,1356220800,,117,3.3703703703703702
798700,5,6304152841,"It is really comforting knowing there are still good movies available for purchase. This movie provides a cute wholesome movie for young children. No guns, no cursing, no sex, just a simple innocent story.",1354060800,,205,5.0588235294117645
798701,5,6304152841,"I enjoy watching the TV show and the movie was just as good--although somewhat different.  The movie is a little less lighthearted, but has more emotional depth.  The relationship between Sabrina and Harvey is explored in a more satisfying way.  For hopeless romantics like myself this movie has an ending that was all that all I could have hoped for!  As always, Mellisa Joan Hart (the only actor who is also in the TV show) is delightful--as anyone would know who saw her dancing the Charleston on ""Dancing with the Stars.""  She has a great comedic presence as well as the ability to convey genuine emotion.",1305676800,,609,4.7075471698113205
798702,5,6304152841,I absolutely love this movie. It makes me feel like a kid again.  Imagine having magic powers to do all that Sabrina does.  A lot of kids would definitely love this movie.  My niece and I do. I definitely recommend.,1203379200,,215,4.325
798703,5,6304152841,"I really like shows with a magical theme to them. This all started when I was a little boy in the 1970s as I watched ""Bewitched"" every day after school. Now I am an adult and I still enjoy these shows with a magical theme to them. I am so incredibly pleased and thankful that television shows like Sabrina and a plethora of others are available upon DVD; ""woohoo"" (lol).",1178409600,,370,4.3
798704,3,6304152841,This was An OK Movie And it went into more detail about her witch hertiage but besides Melissa Joan Hart as Sabrina. I Think The TV Series Cast was a Lot More Believable,1175472000,,169,4.151515151515151
798705,5,6304152841,"I absolutely LOVED Sabrina The Teenage Witch on Nickedodeon UK TV. I used to watch it every day without fail. I am very surprised that there's still no sign of it being released on DVD. This is not a review of the movie, (even though I did enjoy it!) just another plea to RELEASE THE SERIES ON DVD! PLEASE! Like another reviewer said further down, register on that tvshowsondvd.com website, and find the tv shows voting bit to vote for Sabrina!",1140566400,7,444,4.493827160493828
798756,5,6304152841,All the fun and wonder of finding out a teenage girl is a witch. I confess to some wishful thinking whilst watching. Had a great time watching the movie.,1123027200,4,153,4.310344827586207
798757,4,6304152841,"This movie was great and it led to a great series.  I was a Sabrina fanatic when I was younger and I'm glad to finally get the movie that started it all.

  If you want to get this show on DVD go to [...]  They take requests.  This method has worked with Full House, as well as many other TV shows",1106006400,16,297,3.7868852459016393
798758,5,6304152841,"My baby daughter and I love Sabrina!  I am a new viewer and have only been watching since my little one was just a few weeks old (she's now 20 Months).  Now, that I've seen most of the show's reruns, I have purchased the movie - I was a little dissapointed to discover Harvey and the Aunts were not played by the same actors in the episodes, but otherwise, it was a wonderfully done movie and I am thrilled to add it to my collection of DVDs!  Now all we need is the release of Sabrina's 7 seasons on DVD to make it even better! :)",1103673600,21,531,3.990566037735849
798759,3,6304152841,The movie is ok but I really found the tv series to be delightful for family viewing.  You would think that after something like 7 seasons there would be some on dvd.,1087862400,11,166,4.1875
798760,5,6304152841,"In the movie she is Sabrina Sawyer, or at least in the DVD version that I watched. Apparently it was shot in British Columbia, with her best friend played by Michelle Boudoin, a Canadian girl. I wonder if most of the actors were Canadian?",1082678400,3,238,4.431818181818182
798761,3,6304152841,"This movie introduces Sabrina Spellman,the teenage witch. You will see her turn 16 and discover she is a witch. However,many characters are played by different actors than in the tv series.",1032307200,5,189,5.129032258064516
798762,3,6304152841,"This movie was OK.  The plot was pretty good, and a lot of other people must have liked it, since it was what inspired the TV series, but I didn't like all too much.  I think that's probably because I've already seen, and am a big fan of, the TV series, and all the changes with the people and the voices get really annoying, especially since I love the people and voices on the show. Don't let this discourage you from seeing this movie, but I'm just saying that if you've seen the show, you'll notice some big (and disappointing) changes, so be warned. If you've never seen the series, than I would definitely recommend this movie, because you wouldn't notice the differences and be set off by them.",1004918400,2,701,4.426356589147287
798763,4,6304152841,"This is a great movie if you like magic. Basically, It's a story like the comic books:
On her 16th birthday, Sabrina discovers she's a witch and has many wonderful-and not so wondeful-adventures with her powers. If you like the TV show, you'll like this movie.",994032000,,260,4.673913043478261
798764,5,6304152841,"This movie was made back in 1996. Melissa Joan Hart wasn't a big star back then. All she had done were small things and Nickelodian's Clarissa Explains It All. The movie is based on the character that appears in Archie Comics. It was made as a Shotime original movie, but spawned a hit t.v. series.
Sabrina Spellman's parents have gone on a trip far away and have left her withe her two aunts, Hilda and Zelda (Not played by the same people on the show). She has a hard time fitting in. On her 16th birthday, her aunts explain to her that she is a witch. She tries to use her magical powers to make the most popular boy in school fall in love with her, but the concequences could be deadly. What she dosen't see is that her friend Harvey(not played by the same guy on the show) loves her. Now she has to make the right choices or she will be doomed forever. It's funny but not as funny as the show. For one thing, the voice of Salem is different. This movie is really good despite the changes. If I were you, I'd buy it today!",984700800,9,1026,4.160804020100502

7863603,4,6304152841,"A girl, sent by her parents to live with her two eccentric aunts, finds out on her sixteenth birthday that she is a witch.  This premise sets up Sabrina the Teenage Witch (1996) to be a blend of  Bewitched and Mean Girls.

This teen movie belongs to the ""high-school-queen-bee-gets-her-comeuppance"" sub-genre of which there are endless examples.  Apparently there is a huge viewing demographic who on some basic level repeatedly get off erotically or emotionally on this humiliation dynamic.  The friendship and coming-of-age elements are almost incidental to the story.

More central for your thinking viewer are the moral dilemma and ethical considerations raised by the story.  Sabrina competes with other girls in track and field events;  winning several of them by using her powers to cheat.  Little effort is made to show her in any sort of quandary over her decision to cheat.  The story hedges a bit on this issue,  as her magic is mostly used in response to unwarranted attacks by her rival;  but in several of the track & field events her cheating makes losers out of all the other participants and no attempt is made at rationalization or justification.

The problem with casting someone like Melissa Joan Hart as your good girl love interest is the absence of even a hint of physical sizzle.  Which means that to stay remotely credible with viewers, the bad girl she plays off has to be several erotic levels below Megan Fox;  hence Tori Spelling lookalike Lalainia Lindbjerg as Katy Lemore (apparently a play on L'Amore).  And Harts rival Libby in the 1996-2003 series would be played by the even less sizzling Jenna Leigh Green.  Which makes their inevitable comeuppances almost sterile.  And since Katy does not rank especially high on the queen bee badness scale Sabrina's extreme revenge is way out of proportion.  To appreciate the missed opportunity just check out Samanthas inspired abuse of rival Sheila Sommers (played by gorgeous Nancy Kovack)  in several episodes of Bewitched.

But the producers should get some credit for a glammed up Katy in the Zapped (1982) inspired final comeuppance scene.  Although Sabina has tortured Katy throughout the movie she saves the most extreme for the end, reducing her rival to a disheveled and whimpering wreck.  With this Sabrina the Teenage Witch sets a new standard in teen movie queen bee degradation, if that is your idea of a turn on or a good time.  Going any further with this sort of thing would cross into ""Carrie"" territory and that is an entirely different genre.

Sabinas bad boy hunk Seth is played by sleepy looking Ryan Reynolds,  he is relatively harmless and almost cluelessly disengaged. Reynolds would play an almost identical character three years later in Dick.  ""Dead Like Me's"" Daisy - Laura Harris - plays one of Katy's friends and has a lot of what the main actresses are missing.

Then again, what do I know?  Im only a child.",1467158400,,2915,4.9038854805725975
