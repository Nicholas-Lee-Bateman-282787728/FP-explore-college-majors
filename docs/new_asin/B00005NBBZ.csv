1630835,4,B00005NBBZ,I have only one other workout tape for pregnancy.  So I did not want to get bored of using just one so i decided to get this one.  I was happy I did get this one.  I love this one alot.  I like that it has different work outs then my other dvd I bought.  I like the instructor too.  Sometimes if the instructor is not good you don't even feel like watching the dvd.  I recommend this dvd.,1199836800,,388,3.8354430379746836
1630836,5,B00005NBBZ,"Most pregnancy videos are centered on cardio moves with a tad of strength, or yoga-finally, a dvd that is just strength training alone! I normally did walking and belly dancing (I'm an instructor) during my pregnancies, and I already owned 2 prenatal yoga dvds, so this filled in the gap perfectly in my prenatal workout routine.
 The dvd is divided into 3 short, 10 minute segments: upper body, core, and lower body. They recommend using water bottles if you are inexperienced, but if you have been strength training for a while, then you can use weights. I went down a couple of pound in my second/third trimesters, however, to ease the pressure on my core a bit.
 The video shows how to do strength moves SAFELY, especially ab and back work, which is of utmost importance to allievate or prevent back pain during pregancy.
 I can't say enough about this dvd...I used it for my third and most recent pregancy-I only wish I would have had it for my first two pregancies!",1193702400,,971,4.633720930232558
1630837,5,B00005NBBZ,I like this exercise DVD. It is short enough to do on the week days after work but it also gives you a good workout while your pregnant.,1178582400,3,136,3.892857142857143
1630838,5,B00005NBBZ,"This video features 3 ten minute toning segments (core, upper and lower body) for beginnner/moderate exercisers. If you've taken a lot of time off because of fatigue or other pregnancy related issues, or aren't a fitness fan, this video will help you stay toned. You'll have to supplement with cardio of course, to keep up your endurance and keep weight off, but strength training is just as important. All of the women featured are fit with just a tiny perfect belly, which is probably intended to be inspiring, but makes me want to slap them instead. I'd like to see at least one pleasantly plump woman sweating with the rest. Who really only gains 20 pounds anyway?

Enough ranting-see Kathy Smith's pregnancy video or Leisa Hart's fit mama for some good cardio choices.",1128038400,11,773,4.81203007518797
1630839,5,B00005NBBZ,"I'm a 20 year old mom to be with bad back problems and I stand all day in my workplace so that in itself is a workout!  I bought this video yesterday a little skeptical at first.  But after trying it right after work I feel more energized and better about my body already.  I absolutely love this instructor and hope that I can find some of her other stuff for after my baby.  I'm a serial workout tape collector and my collection usually ends up collecting something of it's own...dust!  And while I will only be able to use this while pregnant it's still worth the money and I would totally reccomend it to other pregnant friends in the future.
I really like how the instructor makes you feel like your body is special and beautiful even though you feel like a beached whale.  I hope that this tape will help me to have a quicker recovery period and maybe even get back to my old shape sooner!",1117756800,5,895,4.266272189349112
7946621,3,B00005NBBZ,"This video was okay but I also bought ""The Perfect Pregnancy Workout, Vol. 1: Sculpting"" and liked that one a ton better. I ended up only doing this one a couple times. I'd recommend the other movie instead. Even my husband likes exercising with me with the The Perfect Pregnancy Workout, Vol. 1: Sculpting  tape.",1389225600,,313,4.6909090909090905
7946622,3,B00005NBBZ,"I bought this and used it only maybe twice. The work out is good, if you can follow it. The music is cheesy and outdated.",1233532800,,121,3.88
7946623,3,B00005NBBZ,"Let me start by saying that I absolutely hate to exercise and accept it only as one of those neccessary evils of pregnancy. I started exercising a bit before getting pregnant and found the QuickFix series and Leslie Sansone's walking DVDs best suited for my level of ""excitement"" and schedule.

Good thing about this DVD is that, like all other QuickFix DVDs, it's divided into 3 10-minute sections with a clock counting down minutes till the end of torture. Also exercise doesn't really require any special equipment (such as belts, balls, etc.) and is suitable for the beginners and pregnant women in third trimester.

But here are the bad things. Nancy Popp takes way too long to explain some movements and not long enough for others. (This is actually a problem with all of her QuickFix segments.) Out of 10 minutes there is really 8 minutes of exercise. Sometimes you get stuck in some awkward pose for much too long. There should've been a separate section on DVD with all the explanations and then a pure workout section. At the same time, Nancy hardly ever mentions proper breathing and very poorly cueues, especially when exercise involves taking your eyes off the screen.

First section involves arm and leg movements and squats. It's probably perfect for women in 3rd trimester, but at the end of 2nd I find it a bit slow and boring (and, mind you, I'm not a fit person). Second workout is mostly for arms and here, on the other hand, I felt that some movements were unnecessarily strenous for the upper back. (Although I did use 3 lb weights instead of water bottles.)

Third workout (abdominals) was of most interest to me, since late in pregnancy we can't do any exercise laying down on the back. The workout starts sitting on the floor with legs crossed in front - for some reason this pose just makes my back hurt instantly, even though I usually don't have any problems with it. About 5 min. out of 10 are Kegels and breathing in and out. Other 2 min. are needed just to re-position yourself between the movements.

Also what's up with the Nancy's two companions? Their smiles look so artificial, it's painful to watch - poor ladies. And I just couldn't take my eyes of the black nail polish on one of the ladies.

Overall it's better than doing nothing, but I'm sure there's something beter there. Early in pregnancy I wouldn't even bother with this DVD.",1227398400,,2372,4.662679425837321
7946624,4,B00005NBBZ,I am 37 years old and 5 months pregnant with my 3rd child. I have exercised all my life though not always consistently.  I just started this workout and completed all 3 workouts in one session and felt great afterwards.  I have only been walking 3 to 4 times a week prior to receiving this DVD.  My arms and legs were sore the next day but not too sore to move.  I used 4lb weights in place of the water bottles she uses and had no problems finishing each exercise.  The workout is lead by Nancy Popp who if any of you are Weight Watchers alumni... she leads the 3 pack of Weight Watcher DVD workouts.  Obviously she is pregnant in this DVD and is clear and concise with directions as in her other videos.  I don't find her annoying like Denise Austin or some of the others.  I will continue to workout to this DVD along with the Erin O'Brien Prenatal fitness fix.  You can see my review for that DVD as well.  I am happy with both purchases.  They were both worth the money spent.  I will be in better shape for labor and will hopefully fend off gaining a lot of weight this pregnancy!,1224115200,,1086,4.193236714975845
7946625,4,B00005NBBZ,I have been taking prenatal yoga classes and this dvd is a exactly what it's titled - it's a quick fix of prenatal yoga classes.  I wish that it came with the necessary yoga equipment but this plus a mat and ball would make an excellent pregnancy gift for expectant mothers!,1219881600,,274,4.372549019607843
7946626,5,B00005NBBZ,"This was my all time favorite pregnancy workout DVD.  You can select from 3 ten minute workouts or do all three, it all depends upon what type of energy level you are feeling that day.  And I started this mid-to late pregnancy and it is totally safe and make me feel really good after a long day at work.  Highly recommend this one!!!!",1211932800,,335,4.285714285714286
7946627,4,B00005NBBZ,"I bought this workout DVD because I do not routinely exercise but wanted to start working out.  Like other reviews said, the workout is best for beginners but you could always change the exercises slightly to incorporate more resistance or added weight if you want.",1206489600,,265,4.888888888888889
7946628,4,B00005NBBZ,"This is a great pre-natal workout video!  I really felt like I worked my entire body and it only took 30 minutes.  My only suggestion is that if the 2nd workout (for upperbody) isn't challenging enough use free weights and increase the weights as necessary.

Another perk is that you don't have to do all 3 workouts at once if you don't have 30 minutes.",1201564800,,353,4.4
7946629,3,B00005NBBZ,"I had several pregnancy workout videos on VHS but got this one cause I am trying to gets some on DVD.  Its okay but seams kind of sloppy.  The timer at the bottom of the screen that counts down for each 10 minute segment was a nice feature. The upper body and lower body sections are great and not too hard but you really feel it.  However, it seems she just muddled through the core section without properly explaining the exercises.  The Liesa Hart FitMama is a much better overall workout.  I also really like my old The Method: Pre-natal workout.",1201132800,,550,4.405940594059406
7946630,5,B00005NBBZ,"I know it's a little silly that I have this DVD and I've never been pregnant.  I first picked it up at my local library for a light workout and I really enjoyed it.

You've got to be good to your body and I thik this helps me do that.  The instructor focuses on important muscle groups that any woman should develop while not over-stressing anything.",1200355200,,350,4.2727272727272725
