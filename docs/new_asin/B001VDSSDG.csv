3821318,1,B001VDSSDG,"If you want to know the entire truth about Islam, do not use this DVD as a reference.
According to the Koran, Moses, Abraham and even Jesus are all MUSLIMS.
The God of Islam is Allah.
The Torah and the New Testament have been plagiarized and the Koran is the result.
The Torah is over 3,300 years old.
The New Testament is 2,000 years old.
The Koran is 1,300 years old.
The Koran claims to be the original Word of Allah.
The God of the Old and New Testament according to the Koran is Allah.
This movie is an absolute public relations propaganda piece.
Be warned.
I encourage you to research Islam.
Research Islam's origins; the truth lies there.",1347235200,3,645,4.428571428571429
3821319,3,B001VDSSDG,"As an armchair student of things Islamic for a number of years now, I must say I have never seen anything quite like this documentary on the Koran. It is as if the understanding of the West is beginning to come of age. There is still a lot that speaks the same old platitudes that we have all heard. The film is very respectful and still says things like Arabs had such a great civilization and preserved all the learning and so forth.

But there is new investigation into the complexity and frustrations of Islam. The film does not shy away from the blatant contradictions in the text of the Koran. New to me was that up until 1974 no one wore a veil in Egypt; that is a practice of some younger women. The film shows a little girl being circumcised by older women. [That was pretty bad.]

It also tells about the ancient Korans that were discovered in the Mosque in Yemen in 1972 and opens the door for further critical study of the text. The text is apparently very unstable. Because ancient Arabic did not use vowels, some written words can mean as many as 30 different things depending on where the vowels were inserted. It seems there was a lot of human editing and interpretation. Specifically called into question are those 72 virgins that every jihadi gets upon entering paradise: they turn out to be grapes. :)

There are things here that I disagreed with and think the author just got wrong. I think the whole Islamic world is beset with huge problems that are fascinating and most of these were not touched on. In that way it is both good and bad; hence the three stars. But it is also as if the author is finally beginning to look at some of the real issues in Islam and reporting on them and in that sense it is ground breaking. Let's hope there is a lot more of this kind of thing in the making.",1337644800,2,1810,4.333333333333333
3821320,1,B001VDSSDG,"Okay this video is good in the sense that it shows the many different personalities and versions of Islam, but as a student of this religion  for many years, it is very unfair and bias as  how the beginning of the video starts with all violence and controversy, which implants the idea of hate and confusion already,  and in all honesty it just does not do a good job for beginners who are wanting to know about this faith. They do a poor job discussing the historical analysis of why there are many different versions or why there is a twisting of verses or practices.  It sort of displays a very common picture of the religion you would get from the television.. depending on what channel or commentator that is talking about Islam, you can get an account of the faith that is interpreted very bias or very liberal, with no historical, sociological analysis.  Personally if you want a good start for Islam that shows not only the many versions of Islam and the many different analysis of interpretations, personalities, controversies and profiles, i recommend ""muhammad legacy of a prophet"" which was produced by PBS- there is a film of experts that cover all aspects of the religion and has a competent team of experts to explain all your questions in an entertaining fashion too.  I really wonder about the intent of such film makers",1296172800,8,1337,4.6680851063829785
3821321,1,B001VDSSDG,"This documentary is not good for an introduction to Islam.  It jumps from point to point and from Shia to Sunni to Sufi ideology without giving clear divisions as to who those views belong.  For a film that claims to get inside the qur'an it spends very little time  actually discussing what is said in the text at all.  It gives a little passage here and there but certainly doesn't go into it.  It barely gives how different scholars interpret the meanings and why or how they are misinterpreted.  Although there is mention of how certain passages that talk about mercy and such are sometimes only half-heeded it is understated.  This documentary gives the impression that Islam is widely open to interpretation which it is not.  85% of Muslims (as stated in the film itself) are Sunni so why not emphasize the Sunni beliefs since that's what most believe and then give the minority views of Shia, Sufi, even Wahabist views.  There is good information in it, there is poorly presented and/or bad information in it.  It is not a good primer.  Even many of the issues it addresses are not beginners level issues and are better left to someone who already has a basic understanding of Islam and various Muslim cultures.  Inside Islam and Islam: Empire of Faith are far better as an introduction to this religion.  I had hopes that this would provide a better understanding of how certain verses from the Qur'an are mis-interpreted by both extremists and by those who try to disprove Islam but that was not the case either.  Overall I felt this was a very poor introduction and a very poor look at the Qur'an itself.  Don't wast your time or money with it.",1280448000,31,1654,4.635738831615121
3821322,5,B001VDSSDG,"This is a wonderful documentary for people interested in learning about Koran, the Holy Book of the Muslim people.  The film is broken into several chapters and is very easy to follow, regardless of your faith.  While it covers many topics on Islam, I wasn't satisfied with their explanation of why Muslim women & girls were made to wear a garment that covered them from head to toe.  If by covering them means it will avoid ""tempting"" man's desires, then where's the man's responsibility for their action?  Why does the responsibility rest sorely on the women?  If the Muslim woman chooses to wear the full abaya, then that's a different story, but to punish her for NOT wearing it is nonsensical.

This documentary start out with a suicide bomber telling us what he was going to do.  In his distorted mind, he thinks his action is justified.  It was very sad to see how he carried out his ""mission"" and thus ending his young life.  It was even sadder to see so many innocent people being killed.  If we all acted based on what we believed to be the ""truth"", then we had better make sure that ""truth"" is correct; otherwise, our entire life would've been based on false assumptions.  No matter how you look at it, Koran does NOT encourage killing of innocent people.  No religion does.

After watching this documentary, I had many more questions than answers, but I did find it to be comprehensive and a fair interpretation of Koran.  I also found it interesting to know that Koran and Bible shared many common threads.  Who knew?  Highly recommended for people with an objective mind.",1269993600,4,1585,4.64748201438849

3821325,5,B001VDSSDG,"It goes without saying that many in the Christian and Jewish worlds are deficient in knowledge about the Koran and the diversity of Muslim beliefs. ""Inside the Koran"" is an outstanding, ""most bang for your buck"" introduction to Islam. Experts, of course, will quibble over specific points, but there is a crying need for a starting point for the average Western viewer.

This documentary explains the difference between Sunni and Shia, and several other variants of Islam. It explains how different Muslims can find, within the Koran, completely opposite justifications for how they act on crucial issues like the use of terrorism and violence, and the role of women.  Some insist that the Koran is Allah's unchangeable word, others that it is a living, flexible message that each believer can interpret for himself. Many Americans do not understand emotionally why Muslins consider the United States and the State of Israel to be joined at the hip. This program makes that clear. The role of Saudi Arabia as the major funder of the recent expansion of Muslim beliefs, education, and some terrorism is outlined.

Some coverage is given to recent scholarship that questions historical interpretations of the Koran and accepted history of the various texts. Such scholarship may prove to be right, but should initially be taken with a grain of salt. Regardless, this is an excellent general introduction.

""Inside the Koran"" has excellent production values for elements such as photography, interview technique, sound and editing. It should be required viewing in every high school in the United States.",1262304000,29,1601,5.1937984496124034

Their ""sacred"" books, and I don't care if we're talking about the Bible, the Koran, or the Jewish Talmud, are NOT infallible. These books may contain many spiritual truths, but translation errors, misinterpretations, and the political and cultural beliefs of the people who wrote them make them unreliable as absolute truths.

It begins with the plan to present various perspectives on the Koran and Islam from different segments of the Islamic community.  While the opinions being shared were those of more moderate to liberal Muslims, all was well.  During a segment containing views being shared by more conservative Muslims, people who might be called fundamentalists, suddenly there was a content permissions error.  It would be hard for me to see someone being ""radicalized"" by this documentary.  It's broad perspective grants a fair hearing to multiple viewpoints, and the fact that it respects the existence of multiple viewpoints cuts against the attitude of the fundamentalists that there can only be one way.

Now we find that the Koran has the same problems of proving authenticity that the Bible does.  It seems that with both text, humans have had ample opportunity to alter the ""Word of God"".  If you know little about Islam this film will help you to see that denominational difference within Islam are just as screwy as the denominational differences in Christianity and Judaism, yet every group claims that they are ""right"".  If ""The Great Spirit"" Yaweh, Allah, and God are the same entity, why is there such division on how we worship that entity, because all religions seem to agree that prayer is the accepted form of communication.

The violent jihadist on the one hand and someone like Professor Ramadan from Oxford, (who interprets the text to bring forth compassion, forgiveness, etc) on the other. There were other very interesting bits of information like the possible origin of the Koran and the possibility that the present Cairo version is NOT the direct word of God.

Or how one could tell our only hope is the Imams?  These are in clear contrast with the bare message of (Shia) Islam that God is the greatest and no-one ever shares powers with him, unless he bestows himself.  So overall, I didn't very much like to see completely false presentations in a documentary.

Says there was a time when the faith was a leading force on the globe but when it became marginalized it becomes violent.
