1929728,3,B0000DZ6R9,"This movie is truly a showcase for both Gerard Depardieu and Jean Reno's versatility. Gerard's character is an idiot who has the propensity to annoy everybody that he comes across whilst Jean's character is a cold & methodical crook.  The plot is easy enough: Jean's character sleeps with the mob's mistress & when it is found out, she is killed.  To avenge for her death, Jean steals the mob's money. In return, the mob endeavours to retrieve the money and killing him at the same time. Gerard's character fervently helps Jean's character because he is endeared to him & he hopes to open a cafe with him someday called ""Two Friends"". Naturally, the mob & his henchmen are on their trails.  That's when the movie is at its funniest as both characters try to evade the captors by doing many silly things unintentionally.  Yes, its based upon a predictable formula but a movie that actually works because of these two brilliant actors whose comic timing is impeccable.  Commendable watching for a rainy night with friends!",1181347200,,1020,4.805714285714286
1929729,5,B0000DZ6R9,"Tais Toi (also called Ruby and Quentin) is one hilarious movie! Starring Jean Reno and Gerard Depardieu, and directed by Francis Veber, this movie starts and finishes with ridiculous (but funny) scenarios. The whole movie is somewhat unrealistic, with incompetent and weak police officers, 6 stolen vehicles in 48 hours, 2 gunshot wounds that seemingly had little effect on their victims, and the good guys always winning. BUT, you do not watch movies like this for their plausibility. Rather, slapstick humour, dark moments filled with laughter, and overall fun times rule the day in this film.

This movie has great one-liners and minor characters. The French is not too difficult to understand, so if you speak a little, you might catch some of the dialogue. Even for those who don't speak French, the humour translates well, and often does not even require words! I showed it to 2 Americans and 2 Japanese people last night, and they were howling with laughter throughout!

Rent it and if you like it, buy it! (I'm quite sure you'll enjoy!)",1173657600,5,1044,4.926136363636363
1929730,4,B0000DZ6R9,"Reviewer No. 1 is a bit tough I think. This is a hilarious movie well worth the money! BUT, I'm sure that the dubbed version (with English subtitles) is superior because you get more of the ""atmosphere"" that the actors try and create. Give it a go!",1170115200,2,248,4.297872340425532
1929731,4,B0000DZ6R9,"I have to admit that at first I did not know what to expect from this film, but as it turns out it was pretty decent!

A good comedy, Tais Toi a.k.a. Ruby and Quentin, brings to the screen the story of an unlikely couple: a dim witted petty thief and a highly intelligent dangerous criminal who meet in prison and become inseparable....

The acting, the setting, the plot, and the music are all very good, though French humor is a bit of an acquired taste.

In short, Tais Toi is a movie definitely worth watching, as it will surely put you in a good mood!  Strongly recommended to those that love all things French, and/or fans of Jean Reno and Gerard Depardieu.  3.5 stars",1157155200,,674,4.36

1929733,4,B0000DZ6R9,"""Tais-toi!"" (meaning `Shut-up') is also known as ""Ruby & Quentin"" in some countries. Whatever it is, the film's greatest asset is its stars - Grard Depardieu and Jean Reno. In spite of the capable supports from Jean-Pierre Malo, Richard Berry, and Leonor Varela, the film belongs to the two leading stars.

Grard Depardieu plays Quentin, a criminal who made a silly mistake in commiting 'bank robbery.' Now in prison, Quentin has a knack of irritating the guys around him by his constant gab. He is the worst kind of inmate to be with, who never stops asking things a single moment, and he thinks he is a very nice person trying to be gentle while you are most likely driven to madness by his constant chatting.

Jean Reno is a professional killer Ruby, who has stolen money from the mobster/his former employer Vogel (Jean-Pierre Malo), and hid it somewhere he alone knows. Both the boss of the gangster and Police Commissionaire Vernet (Richard Berry) want to know the place of the money, but Ruby never speaks a single word about anything in prison.

Now what would happen if Ruby and Quentin are thrown into the same cell? What if they manage to escape from the prison, running away from the mob and the police? You may call it all too familiar, this story about the two opposites, but French veteran writer/director Francis Veber turns this situation into an enjoyable, well-made comedy, of which story plays second fiddle to the chemistry of two characters. Talkative Grard Depardieu are laconic Jean Reno are always amusing to see for the totally different reasons.

Francis Veber has made an impressive list of works as writer and director, including two recent examples ""The Dinner Game"" and ""The Closet,"" and you might know his name through the Hollywood remakes which uses his screenplays like ""The Birdcage."" Surely it depends on your taste, but though ""Tais-toi!"" is a very good comedy, I don't think it is his best film. As in his rather disappointing 1996 film ""Le Jaguar"" (which incidentally starred Jean Reno and Patricia Verasquez), Veber, whose forte is creating unforgettable characters, is not good at handling the action sequences. ""Tais-toi!"" has a few actions, and suddenly the film's touch becomes unsure, even banal.

Fortunately the actions are not many, and Depardieu and Reno are always there, providing what only good character-driven comedies can give. Except for some brief moments, ""Tais-toi!"" is fun for any film fans, especially the fans of Jean Reno, who have been in the not-so-great works like `Godzilla' `Mission Impossible' and `The DaVinci Code.'",1150934400,6,2587,4.979166666666667
1929734,5,B0000DZ6R9,"I have been enjoying the films made by this director for over 30 years already. I remember his films with Pierre Richard from the 70s and 80s very well. His name is like a quality mark to me. If I see ""directed by F.Veber"", I know that the quality is guaranteed. It also applies to the latest ""Tais-toi!"" (Ruby & Quentin) film. If you love French comedies you will enjoy the movie without any doubt.",1150416000,3,399,4.333333333333333
1929735,3,B0000DZ6R9,"Tais-Toi!/Ruby and Quentin reunites Francis Veber with Jean Reno and Gerard Depardieu, but it isn't up to the standard of his previous collaborations with either star. An amiable throwback to the Depardieu/Pierre Richard comedies (Les Comperes, Les Fugitifs and Le Chevre, remade as Father's Day, Three Fugitives and Pure Luck), with Reno in the Depardieu tough-guy role and Depardieu taking Richard's as the clinging genial idiot, it's a pleasant rainy day movie with a few good jokes but not enough to make it stick in the memory despite the sight of the two stars in drag. But, if in the next few years you see a Hollywood comedy about an idiot on the run from a prison asylum with a revenge seeking hardened con, you'll at least remember where the idea came from. And it's almost worth the price of the disc just to see Reno in drag.",1148428800,,837,4.662162162162162
1929736,5,B0000DZ6R9,"Gerard Depardieu once more steals the show in this admirable portrait as a weakminded character. He is sent to prison and soon he will establish a peculiar relationship with Jean Reno that will lead us to unthinkable and laughable situations with great doses of black humor.
Go for this film. It will reward you always.",1115078400,4,319,4.818181818181818

1929738,5,B0000DZ6R9,"A a French comedy. Combining the sombre murderer and the comic naif who escape from gaol together, Tais Toi offers a great movie with lots of loud laughs. An interesting story with three plot phases and the brilliant French quality of fascinating sub-plots alongside the main theme. Superb acting and directing.",1360886400,2,311,5.117647058823529

1929741,4,B0000DZ6R9,"This is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen even though it is spoken in french & I had to rely on the english sub-titles. I never realised how talented Gerard Deppadieu was, he is terrific as the sub normal idiot. An absolute classic performance worthy of commendation.
Fully recommend this DVD.",1354060800,2,303,4.62962962962963
1929742,5,B0000DZ6R9,"A brilliant comic performance from Gerard Depardieu as a simpleton so annoying and talkative it's hard to believe marks another hilarious collaboration between the heralded star and writer/director Francis Veber and actor Jean Reno. The group from Les Fugitifs, remade in America as Three Fugitives, is equally as good here. Depardieu will have you laughing out load much of the time. Reno is no slouch either as the hardened and dangerous mobster out for revenge against the man who took his only love away. It gets more complicated, and more hilarious by the minute when Quentin (Depardieu) attaches himself to Ruby (Reno), his only friend.

The talent and quality of the three principals, both in front of and behind the camera make this film what others in this genre try to be but are not. In short, this is dumb comedy for smart people, a brilliantly executed exercise in making us smile while feeling a tug in our hearts. A clumsy robbery, an escape from prison that will leave your eyes watering, a can which makes cow sounds and a tender moment between Reno and lovely Leonor Varella all add up to a laugh riot with an underlying warmth missing from others of it's ilk. The mere image of Quentin and Ruby opening a pub together is enough to make you smile.

Depardieu is hysterically funny and Reno is terrific as the criminal who first can't believe Depardieu is even for real, since no one could be that annoying or dense, then can't believe he's softening toward him the closer he gets to carrying out his plans. The two are handcuffed together without any handcuffs, and it's an absolutely delightful ride for the viewer. This is a lowbrow comedy with class. If you like belly laughs, and want to see what's wrong with the moronic films often passed off as comedy today, get a copy of Tais Toi to remind yourself funny films are still being made. A real winner.",1262822400,10,1874,4.675757575757576

1929745,5,B0000DZ6R9,"Another offbeat buddy movie from Francis Veber.  This time Depardieu plays the role usually handled by Pierre Richard as Quentin and Jean Reno takes on the role usually played by Depardieu as Ruby.  Reno is wonderful as a criminal who won't talk to the cops - or anyone at first.  Depardieu's character seems to never stop talking, infuriating everyone around him.  In order to ""crack"" Ruby, the police put the two characters into a small cell with the hopes that Quentin will drive Ruby to desperation, and that's only the beginning.  As in all of Veber's buddy movies, the action takes us to many places and situations with increasing hilarity.

Please note that this is a Region 2 PAL DVD and requires a Region 2 or Region-Free DVD player.  Also, the only subtitles are in French.  There are no English subtitles available.",1226016000,,826,4.767605633802817
1929746,5,B0000DZ6R9,"I really enjoyed this movie. Depardieu shows his versatility as an actor this time playing the role of a very simpleminded but talkative fugitive, who ends up sharing a cell with a much more sinister character played by Jean Reno.
