7815403,5,6301801407,"What annoys me most is you get companies that will release a season of a show that only lasted a single season, but are far too lazy to release great movies such as LIES on DVD, my copy of LIES is on VHS & is almost worn out from the amount of times I've seen it over & over. I'm even finding it difficult to obtain another copy new on VHS. It's a pity that some of the great movies I like are either not available on DVD, or if they have been released onto DVD, have now been deleted & no longer available.",1276128000,,507,3.8846153846153846
7815404,3,6301801407,"You know I have been pondering on what to review next and I remembered a good thriller I had not seen in a long time  LIES  Lies is a underrated HORROR that stars Ann Dusenberry as an actress fired from a SLASHER film for not exposing her breasts.(""I'm an actress,not a stripper,""she yells and the producer screams THIS IS A  ....... HORROR FILM YOU HAVE TO SHOW THEM)She then is hired to star in a movie about a mad woman and the plot twist predates both BODY DOUBLE & DEAD OF WINTER this is a enjoyable film with a cast of underappreciated thesps.

7815405,5,6301801407,"This is a film that no one that I know ever have seen. I saw it myself 18 years ago and couldn't get it out of my mind. For a long time I've been looking for it and when I finally found it on the Amazon site I just had to buy it. It is a very breath-taking story and if you are a nailbiter, you will lose every one of them. I strongly recommend this thrilling movie to everyone that like psychological thrillers..... And remember, trust nobody... :)",1095033600,2,449,4.056179775280899
7815406,5,6301801407,"Not much credit given to such a beautiful suspense movie. Tough to get your hands on - but it's worth the running around! Does go hand in glove with ""Dead of Winter."" Good, a very good mystery movie!!!",989193600,,201,4.315789473684211
