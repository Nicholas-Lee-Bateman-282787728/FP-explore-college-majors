8292472,5,B001DAVTSS,"""Sword Stylization"" is nicely filmed and set out, with easy menu choices. I am a beginner with sword, and this DVD provides ample moves to work with and practice. I like how Belladonna demonstrates each move, then provides drilling time for practice. I would have liked to see more balance positions than just the head, but the variety of non-balancing moves makes up for this.",1407369600,,377,4.815384615384615
8292473,5,B001DAVTSS,It is an excellent instructional DVD on how to use the sword for belly dance. I have gone from no experience with a sword to feeling competent enough to use a sword in choreography.,1381017600,,181,4.352941176470588
8292474,4,B001DAVTSS,"I would certainly qualify myself as an intermediate dancer but a  beginner when it comes to sword work. So this video was a great first step for me. My dance partner has more experience with sword work and is a great help in refining my technique, but the moves made more sense in my brain after watching Belladonna's DVD.
I must be honest in saying that the music for the drills was a touch droning and I would have liked something different- or perhaps at least different parts of the same song to demonstrate different movements- but that could be a matter of personal taste. I definately appreciated her approach that sword work wasn't ALL about plopping the sword on your head and dancing a regular performance- sword work IS different and requires different music, tone, and technique than you might expect. I would like to see Belladonna move on to an intermediate video that discusses more on various body balance points, more layering techniques, and floorwork. But this video all in all was a great starting point to use in further developing my sword skills.",1301961600,,1069,4.747311827956989
8292475,4,B001DAVTSS,"Average sword dvd. All the basics I already knew. It was good practice to refresh my memory, though. The only bad part was the creepy music. I had the volume on mute while watching this. This dvd is sort of for sword beginners. She teaches a good bit of intermediate/advanced moves but it is mostly basics and easy to learn. I'd totally reccommend this. Whoever bought this would have to be able to tolerate the freaky music, though. I had to sell it because the music distracted me from learning. It's overall a very good dvd!",1294617600,,527,4.5
8292476,4,B001DAVTSS,"I have been dancing with a sword for years, so a lot of this DVD was not new for me, but it's a very good overall instructional on the subject. I like her take on transitional moves, balancing tips (who knew -- start your sword spinning before you do, and it will follow you!) and stylization. I ended up picking up a few tricks from her performance clip as well. I would have liked a bit more choreography and a bit less theory -- I didn't really need a segment on how to pick a sword -- but as I said I know a lot of the basics already. Perhaps her second DVD will be more choreography-intense, and perhaps with a bit more fancy production values. Overall a very good DVD for a first effort. Recommended!",1233878400,9,706,4.198529411764706
