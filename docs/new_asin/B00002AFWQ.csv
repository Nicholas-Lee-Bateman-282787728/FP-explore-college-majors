1251448,5,B00002AFWQ,"This exercise tape is the best one I have ever done.  I never thought bellydancing could be so fun!  You work your muscles and feel it too!  The 30 minutes feel like 10, its that much fun!",1014336000,2,188,4.027027027027027
1251449,5,B00002AFWQ,This video set is fantasic... I received them this morning and tried them out. The videos are low impact but really put you though the motions. After each video I was sweaty and feeling good. Neena and Veena show the basics and then at the end of each video there is a small dance. I would buy these for anyone.,990489600,5,311,4.2
1251450,5,B00002AFWQ,"I use belly dance as low impact fitness.  The entire series is geared for fitness.  The women are excellent dancers and the routines are all fun.  You get a great half an hour workout without hurting yourself!  This is not a set of tapes directed at ""pro"" belly dancers to pick up or improve movements, be a smart shopper and keep that in mind.  The secondary advantage to the tapes is of course the HHF (Happy Husband Factor)  If you actually keep up on the series you end up with a solid dance routine that helps you get your way more often, and far fewer back, neck, shoulder and leg pains.  This has been great for this 37yo with injury arthritis.  Give it a try. Enjoy your life!",971308800,10,684,4.2890625
1251451,4,B00002AFWQ,"This is the first bellydance tape I've tried and really liked it.  After a few weeks, though, it got a little boring.  (Hint, buy another one in the series or get their boxed set for variety.)  It is for sure harder than it  looks!  The floor ab workout at the end sure puts you to the test.  Overall, it's a fun way to get in shape and the sisters are very  impressive!",955238400,5,370,4.055555555555555
1251452,4,B00002AFWQ,"If you just sit and watch this video you may think, ""So what? That's not so hard.""  But spend 25 minutes or so with these sisters and you'll feel it the next day.  The movements in this video are geared to  bellydancing.  The layering of movements [such as ribcage circles with  egyptian arms]is key in proper bellydancing.  The slow methodic movements  of arms, ribcage and hips on this video help tone the upper body and gain  control of torso muscles.  The floorwork is a little tricky and you may  have to work up to it. Not an aerobic workout, but definitely a muscle  toner, especially for the upper arms and shoulders.  Not a bad little abs  section added, focusing on more traditional ab exercises needed to round  out the workout on the video.  Adds a nice variety to any home based  exercise program.",952473600,17,810,4.559440559440559
7915484,5,B00002AFWQ,Fun and hard at the same time. Great workout!,1472860800,,45,4.111111111111111
7915485,1,B00002AFWQ,I watched the video twice and didn't really feel as though it was a good fit for beginners. The video starts out in what seems to be a warm-up but it continues at a rapid pace. I couldn't follow it at all.,1375315200,,205,3.9047619047619047
7915486,5,B00002AFWQ,This workout will really tone you upper boddy.  Its fun and not too intense although for a beginner it may take you a couple of weeks or so to hold the abdominal strengthening positions.  But it does work.,1300233600,,205,4.368421052631579
7915487,3,B00002AFWQ,"Bellydance Fitness Arms and Abs is designed to tone your upper body using bellydance-inspired movements. In the first half of the workout, you will do a variety of arm movements, most of which require you to hold the arms at shoulder level or above. Although the voiceover instruction suggests that these moves will tone your biceps and triceps, I felt them mostly in my shoulders, which quickly became fatigued. Eventually, you move on to working the chest and ribs, mainly through isolation movements. The final ten minutes of this workout are performed on the floor. You'll start with several non-traditional abs exercises--eg, leg lifts while propped on your elbows--and then you'll work on more traditional crunches. The workout finishes with several yoga-inspired stretches, and the total time comes in at about 28 minutes.

Overall, I found this to be an okay light toning routine. However, because the workout concentrates on the upper body, there is no footwork, which removes the fun factor (as well as the cardio work) that exists in other videos of this series (eg, Basic Moves). If you're interested in toning the arms and abs and are looking for something a bit different, this workout might be for you, but if you want to experiment with some fun bellydance moves, you'll probably want to try one of the other videos in the Bellydance for Fitness series.",1117152000,8,1369,4.978165938864628
7915488,5,B00002AFWQ,"I barely made it through the warm-up, so I know this one is good.  My arms and abs are probably the weakest parts of my body, so I was drawn to this video by its title.  Veena and Neena aren't nearly as annoying as some exercise video instructors, and they make it all look so effortless.  I'll definitely be working out to this video for a while, until I can make it through the whole thing.  Fun and a great workout, which is what I've been looking for.  After this I'll buy anything Veena and Neena put out.",1107129600,6,510,4.163265306122449
7915489,4,B00002AFWQ,I started out on this and it was easy...but as time went through..by the end of the half hour I was in pain!! If this doesnt make me loose nothign will!,1084406400,3,152,3.935483870967742
7915490,5,B00002AFWQ,"I own this video and I love it! This is one great workout, ladies! It's great for the beginner, like me and Veena and Neena are EXCELLENT in teaching you the movements, slowly and presicely!
I broke my wrist last summer and doing the ""wrist circles"" on this tape has really helped with improving my flexability in my wrist and relieves the stiffness!
I find myself using this tape more and more every week! I also own ""Basic Moves"" and it's even better! I can't wait to get the ""Belly Dance Essentials"" gift set for Christmas!
I'm hooked on bellydancing now!",1069545600,7,558,4.534653465346534
7915491,5,B00002AFWQ,"I bought this tape wanting to target my arms and abs, but not thinking a belly dancing tape would be too strenous for targeting these muscles. I was pleasantly surprised to see that you can have a really effective arm work out without any weights. Some of it may be too tough for beginners (like myself) but it was a fun work out and found it more enjoyable than most work out videos.",1053907200,2,384,4.273972602739726
7915492,5,B00002AFWQ,"This tape is intense, but it's also a joy. The first time I worked out to it I realized how weak my arms were. There's a good stretching warmup, and then the twins get right into the arm workout. They do the moves with a bit of dancers' flair, which keeps you distracted if you're finding out what a wuss you are. Everything will get worked, from biceps to triceps to your forearms. The best thing, however, is you feel strong and feminine while doing it. I don't want to feel like I can kick butt, just stronger and more graceful after I do a workout, and this one does the trick (along with the other twins' videos). Once the arms get the business the twins start working the midriff with rib slides and circles, which feel very sensual and wonderful on the spine and ribs as everything gets warmed up and stretched out. After a few minutes you're on the floor working the abs with fun and challenging moves. Cooldown incorporates some wonderful yoga moves (cobra, etc) that feel like heaven. It's probably the toughest tape in the series, but it's worth it. If this tape were ever to melt down or break it'd be right up there on my shopping list with milk and bread.",1024790400,6,1169,4.391705069124424
7915493,5,B00002AFWQ,"This is an *Exercise* video first and foremost.  ""Bellydance Fitness for Beginners: Arms & Abs"" provides a great alternative fitness routine for those who want to sculpt their arms and abs.  This video is NOT instructional and NOT designed to teach the beginner how to belly dance.  However, Neena and Veena DO demonstrate how you can incorporate the exercises into a bellydance routine with their brief performance and graceful entrance.  I was able to learn some of the veil work that they demonstrate--just by pausing and re-watching the tape. It is so much fun!
This is my favorite video in the ""Bellydance Fitness for Beginners"" boxed set.  My collar bone broke in a car accident years ago, and has since healed, but my neck and shoulders are always stiff. The exercises in this video has increased my range of motion and eased tension in my neck. The fluid and flowing movements are a sensual and an effective way to shape your arms.  The ab exercises include traditional crunches and belly rolls (ribcage rolls or undulations).  Most of the exercises are isolated belly dance movements choreographed to make this most enjoyable exercise routine.
I would highly recommend this tape for bellydancers who want to refresh their technique or work on isolated moevments, and for people looking for an alternative fitness routine. Unlike aerobics, bellydancing is a fun way to stay in shape.  I also suggest that you buy the boxed set and save yourself some money!  Enjoy and have fun!",1024099200,7,1485,4.931726907630522
