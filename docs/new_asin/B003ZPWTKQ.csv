Then I tried to return it and it went to the United Kingdom I was not able to view the DVD because it is not in the USA format. I can see now that it's says that right in the title but I didn't notice it when I ordered. Then I tried to return it and it went to the United Kingdom and would have cost me more money to send it back than the DVD cost to buy. Live and learn.,1470096000,,529,3.4915254237288136

Though I don't collect movies, this is one to watch again sometime soon because the story is so promising and intriguing.  From a place of possibility, Lourdes offers hope in a time when we can certainly use it.",1343347200,,294,4.25
8410731,4,B003ZPWTKQ,"There's a certain ambiguity to the questions raised in Lourdes by Austrian director Jessica Hausner, but it's that not Lourdes is too respectful of its subject or wary of causing offense to believers. Rather, the film seems to be attempting to look objectively at the kind of people who go there on a pilgrimage looking for healing and even the possibility of a miracle, while for some it may be enough to just give them the strength and the faith to struggle on, the film attempting in the process to reconcile questions of faith with the realities of human nature and illness.

The film finds some degree of scepticism, objectivity, or perhaps simply humanity in the figure of Christine (Sylvie Testud), a young woman suffering from multiple sclerosis, pretty much paralysed from the neck down and confined to a wheelchair, who hasn't come to Lourdes with a group of pilgrims in expectation of a miracle, as much as using it as an opportunity - one of the few available to her, and one she has taken advantage of in the past to go to other holy sites in Europe - to get out and about and meet people. One might think that there would be enough people of a likeminded nature on these trips, but Christine doesn't get the opportunity to speak to many of them and share details of their suffering or their hopes for a cure. It's not so much that Christine's condition doesn't give her much freedom to meet anyone other than the carers from the volunteer nurses looking after her needs, as much the fact that everyone, Christine included, seems to be wrapped up in their own little world of quiet suffering and contemplation, concerned with their own hopes for a cure and fears of it being someone less deserving than themselves who experiences the longed-for miracle.

These are very human responses to basic questions and tenets of faith relating to the will of God, questions that the priest travelling with the pilgrims takes pains to explain to the faithful in terms that everyone will be familiar with - God works in mysterious ways; the Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away. There's no realistic way of objectively confronting or challenging these questions other than on a personal and individual level, and Hausner allows the viewer to relate to them through a diverse collection of characters and, admirably, manages to do this without any unwarranted cynicism or didacticism, allowing actions, silences and glances between the characters to speak for themselves.

If it doesn't delve too deeply then into questions of faith, suffering and miracles, Lourdes does at least address them in terms of human hopes and failings, which the viewer can't help but identify with. The pace might be somewhat slow and deliberate, the look of the film intentionally austere and almost documentary-like, but without being directly provocative the film nonetheless raises interesting questions in a thoughtful and sometimes humorous manner that entertains at the same time as it gives you something to think about.",1303862400,,3007,4.903732809430255

8410733,2,B003ZPWTKQ,"This film fails in two ways. First it fails as a work of art. Or, to put it bluntly, it is a lousy movie. The direction and the acting are stilted, the characters are undeveloped, and the plot leads nowhere--neither to an epiphany nor to a disillusionment. Second, it fails as a depiction of a pilgrimage to Lourdes. I have been on such a pilgrimage with the group represented in the film, and real life is nothing like the movie. In the film the focus is on ""getting"" a miracle; in real life it is on putting oneself in the presence of God and taking what he sends. The idea of a prize for the best ""malade"" is absurd. In real life the pilgrims and their helpers are usually laughing when they are not actually in prayer; in the film they are silent, glum, and occasionally pretending to be pious. In real life Lourdes is full of real human connections; in the first all are isolated. In real life there is some happy flirting at Lourdes; in the film there is only dutiful, predatory lechery. So this film tells you nothing about what a trip to Lourdes is like today. If it were a good movie otherwise that might not matter very much. But it is not.",1287187200,10,1150,4.304147465437788
8410734,5,B003ZPWTKQ,"The title hints at a documentary structure,Lourdes is the French town at the base of the Pyrennes,synonymous with the notion of miraculous cures. This movie was shot in Lourdes, with the agreement of Church authorities. The film is subtly hedging its agnostic bets,beautifully filmed and composed with long-shot or side-angled photography. Testud as Christine,a young qudraplegic woman with MS,who is wheel-chair bound and comes as a `pilgrim'to Lourdes. She can't see why she's been afflicted and wants more from life, to be like `normal' people. Jessica Hausner, an Austrian film-maker,wanted not to mock the idea of spiritual comfort or bodily repair,she wanted to do a test-case healing,but with such precision and sardonic wit,that the repercussions,envy,insight into the pilgrims' minds, the fall-out,of the miracle that is not, are superbly rendered. The attitudes of other pilgrims to Christine after her healing are wonderfully depicted,why her and not me? There is a Greek chorus in the two fellow pilgrims,garrulous fraus,Huber and Spor. Also we get the concurrent life of the Order of Malta volunteers,whose lack of piety and flirting with each other,mirror in some way Christine's low-key response to a miracle cure. Has she merely won on the lottery to find out her ticket has the wrong numbers?Is she a higher form of traveler in a ghastly cultural/ spiritual package tour?Christine seems to compete with Maria,a volunteer for the attentions of Kuno,an older man Order helper. We get a reflection of different degrees of spirituality:some like Cecille who overdo it,a stickler for religious protocol and religious respect,doesn't believe in miracles, collapses. Frau Hartl is too serious.

There is the hint of Jacques Tati's influence with the choreography of movement of the crowd scenes,the sublime in the form of a comedy of manners. Christine,a wheelchair confined invalid going along for the ride on a pilgrimage to Lourdes, by which I mean that it is a pilgrimage only for the group she is with, as 1) a sceptic and 2) bored and lonely because of her condition, she has more or less tagged along for lack of an alternative. There's a nice mix of satire and sentiment at work here as we note the commercial aspects of organised religion and the negative aspects of human nature masquerading as piety. But, her mind is vibrant, she seems to accept the help of nurse volunteers at Lourdes with a pleasant demeanor. She tells a priest, in confession, that she gets angry over her diagnosis and feels envious of able bodied people, like a nurse who is flirting with a man on the trip that she fancies. This is like a group tour, with a different activity each day: a hike through the grotto, a bath in the water, even an award at the end of the trip for the ""Best Pilgrim."" Christine has Frau Hartl stay with her. Their relationship is one of fellow pilgrims/caregiver, they barely talk or interact, except in a very distant fashion. A couple of the older volunteers hang together at night and discuss deep topics of faith and spirituality. Juxtapose that with Christine confessing to her nurse that she is not really a believer, she just goes on the pilgrimages because she can't really get out of the house for much else. When the inevitable miracle occurs, within the group, some are jealous, others are sceptical, others just wonder why some are chosen and others are not. A medical examination proves inconclusive. We get the wobble on the dance floor. The music consists of Schubert, Bach spiritual standards and some karaoke at the end. The colour scheme dominated by blue with some splashes of red.",1286323200,2,3623,5.008291873963516
