5789007,5,B00DCHPXKK,"I really enjoyed this one. Only 1 episode was a double dip and I especially liked how many episodes from the New Scooby Doo Mysteries (1984) made the cut for this one. I really hope that Warner Bros uses this dvd an example for future releases. The other new Scooby dvd, Scooby-Doo: 13 Spooky Tales Run for Your Rife, is so full of double dips that I couldn't bring myself to buy it.",1382486400,4,383,4.260273972602739

The first one was the Halloween themed&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Scooby-Doo-13-Spooky-Tales-Run-for-Your-Rife/dp/B00CWR111G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Scooby-Doo! 13 Spooky Tales - Run for Your 'Rife!</a>&nbsp;This time the theme is robots, computers, and other mechanized inventions. The GOOD news, make that GREAT news, is that all but one of the episodes is NEW-to-DVD. That's outstanding for a new Scooby-Doo compilation set! The BAD news is that all these NEW-to-DVD episodes feature Scrappy-Doo, well, all except the BRAND-NEW new episode. Even though they advertise 13 episodes (12 of which are NEW-to-DVD), there's really only 7 and a 1/2 shows (6 and 1/2 of which are NEW-to-DVD). For those of you who are trying to piece-meal together all the remaining Scooby-Doo episodes on DVD, here are the specifics of what's new and what's not (and available elsewhere):

Disc 1:

1. Scooby-Doo!: Mecha Mutt Menace - (BRAND-NEW) complete 2013 half-hour direct-to-video Robot special. Scheduled to premiere on Cartoon Network sometime later in 2013.

2. Foul Play in Funland - originally aired during the 1969-1970 Season 1 of ""Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!"". Available on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Scooby-Doo-Where-Are-You-The-Complete-1st-and-2nd-Seasons/dp/B0001CNQVM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!: The Complete 1st and 2nd Seasons</a>.

Complete half-hour show.

3. The Scary Sky Skeleton  - (NEW-to-DVD) originally aired during the 1979-1980 Season of ""Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo"". Complete half-hour show.

4. Way Out Scooby - (NEW-to-DVD) originally aired during the 1980-1981 Season of the hour-long ""The Richie Rich/Scooby-Doo Show"". (This will appear on ""The Richie Rich/Scooby-Doo Show"" Volume 2 DVD Set if it ever gets released). The Scooby-Doo half-hour portion of the show was composed of three (3) seven minute shorts and later re-run separately as the half-hour show ""The Scary Scooby Funnies"". This short is just 1 of the 3 shorts that made up the Scooby half-hour. However, this release uses the modified 1979-1980 ""Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo"" opening credits created for the syndicated runs, even though the voice of Scrappy from the 1979-1980 opening credits and episodes (Lennie Weinrib) is not the voice of Scrappy from the 1980-1981 (and later) opening credits and episodes (Don Messick).

5. Who's Scooby-Doo? - (NEW-to-DVD) originally aired during the 1982-1983 Season of the hour-long ""The Scooby and Scrappy-Doo/Puppy Hour"". Again, the Scooby-Doo half-hour portion of the show was composed of three (3) seven minute shorts. This short is just 1 of the 3 shorts that made up the Scooby half-hour. Same modified syndicated 1979-1980 ""Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo"" opening credits as described above, but with the 1982-1983 closing credits.

6. Disappearing Car Caper - (NEW-to-DVD) originally aired during the 1982-1983 Season of the hour-long ""The Scooby and Scrappy-Doo/Puppy Hour"". Again, the Scooby-Doo half-hour portion of the show was composed of three (3) seven minute shorts. This short is just 1 of the 3 shorts that made up the Scooby half-hour. Same modified syndicated 1979-1980 ""Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo"" opening credits as described above, but with the 1982-1983 closing credits.

7. The Dinosaur Deception - (NEW-to-DVD) originally aired during the 1983-1984 Season of ""The New Scooby and Scrappy-Doo Show"". Second half of the half-hour show, but with BOTH the opening and closing credits.

Disc 2:

8. The Hand of Horror - (NEW-to-DVD) originally aired during the 1984-1985 Season of ""The New Scooby-Doo Mysteries"". Second half of the half-hour show, but with BOTH the opening and closing credits.

9. Doom Service - (NEW-to-DVD) originally aired during the 1984-1985 Season of ""The New Scooby-Doo Mysteries"". Second half of the half-hour show with the closing credits only.

10. A Code in the Nose - (NEW-to-DVD) originally aired during the 1984-1985 Season of ""The New Scooby-Doo Mysteries"". First half of the half-hour show with the opening credits only. (Hmmm, 9. And 10. here should have been reversed, because they originally appeared together and made up a complete half hour show.)

11. The Bee Team - (NEW-to-DVD) originally aired during the 1984-1985 Season of ""The New Scooby-Doo Mysteries"". Second half of the half-hour show, but with BOTH the opening and closing credits.

12. A Night Louse at the White House Part I - (NEW-to-DVD) originally aired during the 1984-1985 Season of ""The New Scooby-Doo Mysteries"". First half of the half-hour show with the opening credits only. (One of the few episodes this season that includes Velma, but no Fred).

13. A Night Louse at the White House Part II - (NEW-to-DVD) originally aired during the 1984-1985 Season of ""The New Scooby-Doo Mysteries"". Second half of the half-hour show with the closing credits only. (One of the few episodes this season that includes Velma, but no Fred).

There are no Special Features in this set.

If you are a Scooby-Doo completist, then this set is a no-brainer must-have for you. But, if you absolutely hate Scrappy-Doo, then don't bother, because you'll seriously be disappointed. And at my last count, we are almost at the half-way point of getting all the episodes of the 1984-1985 Season of ""The New Scooby-Doo Mysteries"". That should mean a complete season set is inevitable. And Warner, at some point, you guys are going to have to bite the bullet, and put out one of the remaining Scooby-Doo season sets with Scrappy's name in the title and picture on the cover. And you might be surprised on how successful it actually sells.",1380412800,26,6238,5.896895787139689

So I started this review with an episode list. Most likely you've never heard most of the episodes on the set. That is because only one episode on this set is a rerelease which is fantastic. That being said I need to address that the sneaky folks at warner bros. fail to mention Scrappy Doo's appearences in every episode on the set except two. So this set appealing to you depends on your opinion of Scrappy and the new Scooby-Doo! Mecha Mutt Menace special on wheather or not this collections a buy for you. I give this set five sars for all new releases and the fact that Scrappy doesn't bother me. 5/5",1376697600,16,949,4.2430939226519335

5789017,1,B00DCHPXKK,If you are thinking this DVD has all new shows. It doesn't. DVD contains 1 new show and every other episode on both DVDs is an old on from the 70s/80s....,1388361600,,154,4.0
5789018,3,B00DCHPXKK,"I grew up with Scooby Doo. I love the original series from the early 70's, but when it came to the ones with Scrappy Doo, in my opinion it had to have the whole gang in it to make it enjoyable.

 These 13 episodes do not contain the whole gang! There are in fact only 3 episodes out of all 13 that contain the entire gang. Thus, the reason I gave it less stars. 1. Scooby Doo Mecha mutt menace, 2. Foul play in Funland, 3. The scary sky skeleton. Other than those episodes, on this DVD you will only see 3 episodes with Velma and or Daphne. It's not very many either. Mostly it's Scooby, Shaggy and Scrappy Doo only.

 Now I even like the what's new Scooby Doo series and most of the other ones as well, but this, I just could not get into. I felt the plots were not good enough to be looked into as a real mystery and for the most part extremely silly. Plus you have scrappy basically ruling each episode more than any other character.

 Here are the only redeeming qualities that I will go by for this collection : you get that all new 22 minute movie to start with that does contain the whole gang and is without Scrappy. Foul play in Funland episode with the original Gang and no Scrappy. The scary sky skeleton does have scrappy but contains the entire gang, making it bearable to watch. Also the story had that creepy quality and didn't suck as half as bad as the other episodes.

 So to wrap up this review. If you like Scrappy Doo and don't care that the rest of the gang is not in it, then this is definitely a buy for you. But if you're used to the whole gang being in on the mystery, then this dvd is only worth renting for those 3 episodes mentioned above.",1388275200,,1668,4.1265432098765435

8591817,4,B00DCHPXKK,"The content of this scooby doo set spans from 1969 to 1984 with the exception of a newer episode from a few years ago. I decided to buy this set because i was interested in seeing episodes of the new scooby mysteries. I had only seen one episode of that particular series previously: nutcracker scoob. This is truly the most mixed of a mixed bag collection because the degree of likeness towards  the episodes was  spread quite evenly. I thought 4 were great, 5 were okay, and 4 were terrible. So this set definitely succeeded in variety. The great- foul play in funland, scary sky skeleton, who's scooby doo?, and a code in the nose. The okay-way out scooby, disappearing car caper, dinosaur deception, the hand of horror, and doom service. The terrible- mecha mutt menace,the bee team, and night louse at the white house part 1 and 2. I was very excited about getting this set. I had seen only foul play in funland previously. I paid a bargain price for this set. I will definitely order another 13 spooky tales set.",1459814400,,1018,4.557377049180328
