1202423,5,B00000F5WY,Loved it !! A lil slow at first but defiently worth the wait. Can't wait for him to make another movie!!! People that gave it less then 3 stars obviously did not watch the whole movie and they certainly  do not know what murder is.,1439164800,,231,4.133333333333334
1202424,5,B00000F5WY,"It is a strange,seemingly simple and very funny movie. It is best to watch it more than once as you see things that you did not pick up on the first time.",1438732800,,154,3.84375
1202425,3,B00000F5WY,Very weird Indie movie. Low budget. I'd only recommend to die-hard Stargate Atlantis fans.,1437609600,,90,5.5

1202460,5,B00000F5WY,"Katherine Emily ""Kate"" Hewlett alone is worth buying and watching this movie.  She is such a MAGNIFICENT blond beast!  Too bad the Canadians aren't as kinky as the French- I would have loved to have seen more of Ms. Hewlett's alabaster glory-yum!  It's amazing how good this movie is with ONLY 3 CHARACTERS!  lol",1436227200,,312,4.722222222222222
1202461,5,B00000F5WY,"A Dog's Breakfast is one of the best small budget films I have ever seen. David Hewlett gives a seller performance. The acting is on point and makes me laugh without rolling my eyes (or cringing from the overdone-ness or cheesiness). Love, love, love this movie.",1435104000,,262,4.717391304347826

1202463,5,B00000F5WY,"Funny movie filled with dark humor. Good twists.  Ordered it because I had just watched ""Stargate: Atlantis"" for the fifth time from start to finish and wanted to see something the actors had done prior to the series and after the series was cancelled.  This was my first David Hewlett movie.  Fun and offbeat humor.  Will keep it to watch again.",1428883200,,346,4.622950819672131

1202465,4,B00000F5WY,"It's a rather oddball movie for sure, but we like David Hewlett and the other actors who were with him in Stargate and Stargate Atlantis that were involved in this, so that's why we wanted it. It was fun to see them! If you like these particular actors also, then you'll probably have fun seeing them as well.",1425081600,,309,4.344827586206897

1202503,5,B00000F5WY,"If you're a fan of Dor. McKay on Stargate Atlantis you should definitely pick up this movie and watch it. You get Davis, his sister AND Paul McGillion... and other familiar faces. Get it! You'll love it!",1398384000,,203,4.513513513513513
1202504,5,B00000F5WY,I wish I would have got this when it was first released. David Hewlett is a very clever and talented Actor/Writer/Director and this movie has easily become one of my favorites. For a small budget film ADB is fantastic! It is a laugh fest for sure. A Dog's Breakfast features a highly talented cast including his sister Kate and Stargate pals Paul McGillion and Christopher Judge. I only hope that David Hewlett will continue to explore his creativity and please give us another film soon!,1393804800,,488,4.752941176470588

Funny and entertaining film.",1389052800,,119,4.454545454545454
1202507,5,B00000F5WY,"Absolutely hilarious movie with a wonderful cast. Patrick's efforts to get rid of his sister's fiance, and then his subsequent efforts to deal with the results is fantastic. And the revelation at the end is laugh out loud funny :) Definitely a movie worth watching.",1386288000,,265,4.911111111111111
1202508,4,B00000F5WY,"Spoiler alert: don't go out and get this just because of the reviews alone....
The first time I saw this I laughed my butt off thru the whole movie, but that could just be from my twisted sense of humor lol
Definitely a LOW-budget film. Seems like almost all the things shot in the backwoods of Canada all have the same casts.... Mostly from the Stargate franchises. Watch it before you buy it just to see if you actually like it.",1383264000,,430,4.320987654320987
1202556,5,B00000F5WY,A great comedy. This is one of the few movies I've seen many times over. It's great no matter how many times you've seen it.,1378857600,,124,4.0

1202558,5,B00000F5WY,I love this show David Hewlett is always funny and this show is definitely one of his funniest in my opinion. So happy I was able to get this show and add it to my collection.,1370390400,,175,3.888888888888889
1202559,5,B00000F5WY,"Interesting, nephew loved it. A dogs breakfast by David Hewlett, bought a couple years ago, would buy again if it were to get lost.",1368057600,,131,4.5
1202560,5,B00000F5WY,"I still haven't been able to sit through this all the way, but it is ridiculously funny! I'm always dying of laughter less than five minutes into the movie!",1365206400,,156,4.413793103448276
1202561,4,B00000F5WY,"The cast of Stargate Atlantis and SG1 get together to make a film just for fun.  If you enjoy them, and enjoy the things that make them laugh - the hilarious Hewletts, the intimidating yet classy Christopher Judge, and Dr Beckett trying a new accent - you can feel closer to them by watching this film.

4/5 stars because this will appeal pretty much only to fans of dark comedy, independent films with small casts and a single location (except that it's not independent, but rather the cast and crew of Stargate), and those who love all things remotely connected to Stargate.",1361836800,,576,4.637254901960785
1202562,4,B00000F5WY,My Kids loved this movie!  They couldn't stop laughing!!!  They watched it over and over again! Very funny for Kids!,1355788800,,116,4.75
1202563,5,B00000F5WY,"Its funny. David Hewlett at its best. Other actors have done their acting really good as well. If you have watched Stargate Atlantis, one knows how David hewlett's acting is.",1350345600,,174,4.833333333333333
1202564,5,B00000F5WY,"I'm a fan of SG-A and wanted to explore the actors other works. I saw some clips about the show and thought it looked hilarious but the reviews for it were mixed so I decided I had to see for myself. I felt a little uncomfortable at some of the parts but it is only minor content, so I would give it more of a four and a half stars for that. The first time it was really strange, but I gave it another chance and I actually think it's really good, funny, and creative. I've seen it seven times now including one time with my brother, once with my mom, and once with the comentary. My family members also enjoyed this movie.",1339027200,,623,4.073170731707317
1202565,5,B00000F5WY,"Honestly- I bought it only because the main characters were from Stargate Atlantis. That was my favorite show of all time and the movie itself is entertaining, though I wouldn't call it a blockbuster hit. Afterall, its really cheap on here ( or at least it was when I bought it), but worth a good laugh or two if you liked the characters from SGA.",1333497600,,347,4.3538461538461535
1202634,1,B00000F5WY,"I cannot understand all the positive reviews for this gross production -- except by understanding this is a consequence of the decline of Western Civilization.  Some say this movie is hilarious and induces giggling all the way through.  I finally had to stop watching after seeing about 60 percent of this trash when my increasing nausea became too much.

If you think brushing your teeth with the same toothbrush you just used to brush your dog's teeth is funny, then you may enjoy this disgusting mess.  If you find trauma to a man's crotch just hilarious, then you will like this offering.  Or how about repeated attempts at murder and finally succeeding?  If you enjoy tromping through mud and getting filthy over and over, you and your hogs will love this show.

The reason for murder is the brother's dislike of his sister's fiance.  I suppose one's suspension of disbelief is not stretched by the brother's motive for murder, i.e., the fiance is an actor and therefore cannot be trusted.  Most of us will murder sis's guy if she brings home an actor.

No way is this repulsive mess comparable to the black comedy of the past.  Pass it up for something from the more distant past.

BTW, why is it funny when a man's crotch is hit, but not when a woman's crotch or breast is hit?",1326499200,,1284,4.583333333333333
1202635,5,B00000F5WY,"This was a great little movie.  If you liked the Stargate series, both SG-1 and Atlantis, I think you will get a kick out of seeing the stars of the series taking on all new roles.  David hewlett takes on a role he is very well suited for, an akward loser.  This role seems to fit him very well though.  Paul McGillion comes in as a slick hollywood actor, another great role for him.  I loved this quirky comedy.  If you like David Hewlett as an actor and enjoy indie comedies, give this one a shot, I think you'll be pleasently suprised.",1326412800,,538,4.2254901960784315

1202637,5,B00000F5WY,"I've watched this movie a couple of times before with friends, but was thinking about it and decided to buy it to support Mr. Hewlett.",1322524800,,134,4.4
1202638,5,B00000F5WY,"I bought this because I'm a big fan of Rodney McKay on Stargate Atlantis and I heard good things about it from many Stargate fans.  It is every bit as good as I heard it would be.  In addition to being a hilarious movie it stars many of my favorite Stargate characters, which is something I really enjoy.  It might not be enjoyed by everyone, but fans of Rodney McKay will love this.",1317340800,,383,4.219178082191781
1202639,5,B00000F5WY,"It had me laughing all the way through, David is really good at humor and crafting such a hilarious piece, (You should also check out his rapping video on Youtube.)

1202641,5,B00000F5WY,"This movie was really hilarious. It may be a bit dry, but if you like British comedy like Monty Python you'll love this movie. A great buy for any fan of David Hewlett or the cast of Stargate: Atlantis.",1310947200,,202,4.205128205128205
1202642,5,B00000F5WY,"The movie is a little slow in places but being a fan of davids I was rewarded with some good laughs. Worth having the DVD for sure, there is some pretty funny

1202643,2,B00000F5WY,"I didn't think much of this film. After reading another reviewer's suspicions that the reviews were written mostly by just a few persons, I am inclined to agree. It's a strange movie. I love humor but didn't find much to like in ""A Dog's Breakfast."" I can't agree with the glowing reviews.",1301011200,,289,4.576923076923077

1202695,5,B00000F5WY,"Fun for the whole family, child safe with adult humor. Well written, and well produced. Proves good entertainment does not require a big budget. Everything about this movie was good, the music, the acting, the writing, and the camera action.",1291852800,,241,5.05
1202696,4,B00000F5WY,"This was a very different vehicle for David Hewlett. Certainly a B movie if ever there was one. I found it funny at times, but all too predictable at others. {Spoiler Alert} I knew from the ladder accident that the Paul McGillion character was not dead. Furthermore, I knew very quickly that he was the person pulling the pranks on David's character. Perhaps that was what David Hewlett was going for when writing this. Certainly not a mystery. David's sister is a wonderful actress who played her part perfectly. Paul McGillion with the Scottish accent only happens when we see him play his aunt a detective. Actually, Paul McGillion is absent from most of the story and perhaps it was planned that way. There is a brief cameo by Christopher Judge, and an even shorter cameo by Rachel Luttrell, though you will not recognize her. I know I did not. The story centers around David's character trying to kill Paul's character because he is going to marry David's sister. When he finally thinks he has succeeded he immediately regrets his actions and tries to atone to his sister and hide/bury the evidence. The evidence keeps reappearing in dubious ways. The title comes from David's sister making David believe that she has chopped up and ground up Paul's character's body. She then feeds this alleged ground meat to David's character's dog.  Thus, the story. The story ends with a viewer guess at what is going to happen, but an indication that after meeting the Paul's character's sister and falling head over heals in love with her, Paul's character is now trying taking David's character off to kill him.

Overall, I a decent story. Boring at times, funny other times. I rated it a 4 because I really like David Hewlett and want to see him to more movies.  For the movie itself I would have given it a 2. Sorry, David.

1202697,4,B00000F5WY,"Was quite a funny movie but a shame that Mr. Hewlett was a little too revealing untoward his fans. If you watch the movie you'll know what I mean. Met Paul McGillan in Calgary May 2010 and seemed a little shocked by the movie (rather subtle) but nothing that a little therapy can't cure. 8 out of 10 if you enjoy Dr. Rodney McKay when ever he was a little upset. There is an aspect of SciFi but not really the same as SGA. For those who look forward to the planned SGA movie, A Dogs Breakfast is a nice appetiser. Guess we will have to settle for the appearance on the SGU special as the goodbye role for the brilliant Dr. Rodney McKay.",1278892800,,636,4.137096774193548
1202698,5,B00000F5WY,"First off, I am a hug fan of David Hewlett. I was happy that he made this show with his sister and several other from the Star Gate Atlantis crew as that gave it somewhat of a nostalgic view.  The writing and the acting was simply hilarious. This is a great family movie.  If you are looking for a great comedy that you can watch several time over this is the movie!",1277942400,,366,4.069444444444445
1202699,5,B00000F5WY,This is a great movie - even if you're not a fan of SGA.  It's very dark and funny - the characters are wonderfully flawed.,1274140800,,123,3.92
1202700,5,B00000F5WY,"This has got to be one of the funniest movies I have seen in a long time. I just wish that I had discovered this earlier. David Hewlett and his sister work perfectly together and Paul McGillon is great as the 'detective'.

I cannot wait for David to do something, anything, else.",1273017600,,279,4.365384615384615

1202703,5,B00000F5WY,"I adored this movie.
I may not have liked it as much had I not been an avid fan of Stargate and its actors, but luckily the top-notch acting from David Hewlett, Paul McGillion, and Kate Hewlett kept this one bubbling along nicely- so even if you're not a Stargate/DH/PMcG fan, give this one a burl, it's the little indie movie that could!
Great humour, great scary moments, great drama and confusion and craziness, WONDERFUL ending...
This one deserves a rewatch, especially since after the first time, you know what it's all about... :-)",1258848000,,538,4.73404255319149

The story is well paced and funny, but I was a little frustrated with the plot. It's quirky and funny most of the time, but I found some plot elements irritating. It's a very good film worth seeing. Thanks FM for pointing this on out to me!",1254268800,,426,4.271604938271605
1202785,5,B00000F5WY,"A DOG'S BREAKFEST

I am a huge fan of David Hewlett who you may know as Dr. Rodney McKay' from the shows Stargate SG-1 and Stargate Atlantis, as well as the film ""Cube"". So with that said I was really happy to hear a while back he was making his directorial debut with a film he also wrote, ""A Dog's Breakfast"". Unfortunately I was never able to catch a screening any were but I knew that the DVD would be coming eventually and I would catch it then. So of course when it came out I was finally able to buy it, don't know why I waited so long to recommend it.

Patrick [Hewlett] is kind of a weird guy he lives alone in the house his parents owned and he wakes up every morning and separates his cereal [a fruit loops type] into separate bowls by color. He has a dog named Mars [played by a dog named Mars] and that is pretty much it, oh and his sister [Kate Hewlett] is coming to visit him. He actually looks forward to this occasion and even wants to prank her when she gets there. When he is getting ready to do this he notices a guy stalking her so he rushes to help her, turns out it is her boyfriend [Paul McGillion] trying to scare her as well.

This throws him off a lot especially because he is not a people person and also this is some dude with his sister. So as time plays out he is kinda trying to get used to the fact this guy is in his house, but it is not working out to well. One day when he is outside he hears a conversation in which her boyfriend is plotting to kill his sister. So the rest of the film is based on him trying to kill the boyfriend before his sister gets the axe.

This is not your typical film because it is full of an off sense of humor; I think it is hilarious personally. The script by star/director David Hewlett and Jane Loughman is excellent and very funny. Hewlett does a great job in his directorial debut as he keeps things moving and every thing feels very fresh and original. Hewlett is excellent as Patrick and gives one of the best performances ever. His sister Kate [Stargate Atlantis] who plays his sister is excellent as well and is surprisingly evil at times [you'll see]. Paul McGillion [also from Stargate Atlantis] is down right brilliant as TV actor boyfriend Ryan, colt and also as female detective, Detective Morse. He is an excellent actor and I hope he is in Hewlett's next film; he is hilarious especially as the cop. Christopher Judge who you may know as Teal'c from Stargate SG-1 is also hilarious as Chris in this film, the interaction between him and David Hewlett is masterful. Rachel Luttrell from Stargate Atlantis and Amanda Byram who plays the boyfriends sister are also great in this. But the show stealer could possibly be Mars the dog who plays Mars the dog.

This is a very odd yet very funny film that may not be for every one, if you like off the wall comedy then this is for you. Every one in this film did a marvelous job as did the crew for this film. The special features are great with behind the scenes and such but it is the commentary that is the best thing in the bonus features. I recommend this movie to any and every one, buy this don't rent.",1251676800,,3132,4.213333333333333
1202786,3,B00000F5WY,"I bought this film with mixed expectations.  I always read good and bad reviews before buying a product that I know little about.  All I did know is that one of my favorite actors wrote, directed, and starred in this film.  Based on the bad reviews and the very similar wording of a lot of the good reviews (my golly, some of the good reviews were worded almost identically to the description of the movie *on the movie's web page*) I really didn't know what to expect, in fact, I hoped for the best, but feared the worst.  I just watched the movie and can honestly say that it made me laugh, so I liked it.  It wasn't everything that the glowing 5 star ratings made it out to be, but it wasn't the polished turd that the 1 star reviews made it out to be either.  Almost all of the actors are from Stargate.  Being a stargate fan, I found this very distracting at times and it had a tendency to pull me out of the movie, so not really a good thing.  Being his directorial debut and low budget, I can't really fault the director for casting friends and family, but he might have done better if there were some less recognizable faces in the cast.  I found the plot somewhat predictable, but I think it was intentionally so, more of a ""Okay, I know what's going on, when are the character's going to figure it out?"" sort of thing.

Yes, it contains a few actors from Stargate, but I have seen these folks perform in other projects and in this film, the chemistry just works and makes the film more enjoyable.

David and Kate Hewlett are perfect for roles like these and really made the characters that much more believable.  You can really tell that they are siblings, and it made the characters seem more normal.  Paul McGillion did an excellent job as well, rounding out the styles of David and Kate, making the movie well-rounded and exciting to watch.  Mars is the star, though.

Paul McGillion is outstandingly funny. I wanted to see more of him.  I ended up rewinding his scenes several times because I couldn't get enough.

Christopher Judge's role was also very well acted.  His scene with Hewlett in the kitchen had me in stitches.  Who knew Teal'C was so funny.

The only drag for me was there too much Hewlett solo time for my taste.  Hewlett kind of goes overboard beating a dead horse (pardon the pun).  He is not quite as charismatic to carry so much solo time on screen. He is much funnier interacting with the other characters and is more in his element feeding off of their dialog.  Hewletts facial expressions are delightful.

The Hewletts are brilliant. Absolutely brilliant. Their comedy is straight-on, especially with regards to David Hewlett. And watching Paul McGillion play a cheesy sci-fi actor is beyond funny. As a Stargate fan myself, it's more than rewarding to watch so many Stargate actors come together to make such a fun movie. And it's more than obvious that they're all having fun together. But those are just nods to the Stargate fan base. The movie really doesn't have any ties in its plot to the Stargate series that go beyond tongue-in-cheek moments so no worries if you're not a Stargate fan.

The movie is about an over-protective, neurotic, very odd brother meeting his sister's fianc. The brother (Hewlett) thinks the fianc (McGillion) plans to murder his sister (the other Hewlett) and so begins his attempts to murder the fianc first. But, of course, because it's David Hewlett, the plans go awry, and hilarity ensues.

Amazon says (at this time) that it is not rated, but when I received the DVD, it is actually rated PG-13, for ""some nudity, sexual references, and thematic elements.""  There is one use of the ""b"" word; brief rear nudity (male); almost full-frontal male nudity (the ah, pertinent parts are just barely covered); several references to sex and body parts which may go over younger kids' heads, but there is one reference/visual involving a ""sex doll"" that is impossible to miss, and for that reason I would have to say - not family friendly, and not really something you're going to want to watch with your mother, for instance.  Also a particular scene involving meat may make some viewers uncomfortable.

I actually liked the movie - it was funny and the acting was good.  The one-liners are hysterical.  Although I could have done without the above references/scenes, the movie was MUCH tamer (and more intelligent) than what the typical teen is watching these days; I am just a little more old-fashioned than most.

After further reflection, it's pretty clear to me that most of the reviews were written by one or two people. Read a dozen of the 5 star reviews and you'll begin to hear the same screechy voice coming out of the mouths of nearly one hundred sock puppets.

When Patrick, who is determined to hate Ryan no matter how nice the guy seems, overhears him plotting to kill his sister, he takes matters into his own hands. But things don't go as planned (that's an understatement) and Patrick is soon in WAY over his head...
Stargate fans will love the cameos and inside jokes, the cast is stellar, and David Hewlett is brilliant as ever. That said, the plot isn't run down with inside jokes non-SG fans won't understand.",1199923200,,921,4.910256410256411

One friend of mine really hates slapstick ""Dumb and Dumber"" type movies and said she was relieved that this was more intelligent than that.  I couldn't agree with her more.  I love the brother-sister relationship.  Also, Mars, the dog, is just adorable.  There aren't many ""good quality"" movies out in the theaters. (Anyone else make the mistake of going to see ""The Mist""?) It's a shame that this one isn't being seen on the big screen. Even though I've bought the DVD I would love to go to a theater and watch this with an audience. If you have a good sense of humor, this movie is for you.",1198800000,,732,4.377777777777778

Everytime the movie started to drag, something funny would happen again.  I thought Christopher Judge would have a bigger & better written part but it was still great to see him in there.  This movie is totally worth adding to your collection.  There is one scene alone that is worth the price of admission. Dance Monkey Dance!",1198454400,,485,4.593023255813954

I'm not sure if it is David Hewlett, his beautiful sister Kate, or Paul McGillion; probably it is a combination of the three of them that makes it all happen the way it does.  This movie will make you laugh from deep inside, and just give you a good feeling all over.  It is what a movie is supposed to be about:  Entertainment.  I hope we will see more of this kind of movie from the Hewletts and I would like to thank them for creating a film that is good to escape into at the end of a wild and stressful day.  It is great to watch and drift off to sleep with a smile.  :)",1198281600,,652,3.8208955223880596

This is a low budget Canadian movie so don't expect the most over the top film with special effects or a lot of extras in the filming. I found this to be refreshing and hilarious, if you are a Stargate fan it's all the more enjoying.",1198195200,,386,4.16
1203584,5,B00000F5WY,"I confess, I am a David Hewlett fan (""McKay"" is one of my favorite characters of all time), also I'm a Stargateophile (gatephiliac?) and pretty serious fanatic, however, I don't automatically and blindly ""love"" everything out just because it's attached to Stargate, either SG-1 or Atlantis. I like to think I have an independent mind to some extent.

A Dog's Breakfast sounded like a cute project, and I enjoyed reading the Hewlett ""dgeek"" blog and watching the squirrels (his self-named fans) spin an ever-widening and impressive marketing buzz like never seen before. But I still reserved my opinion until I could view the film. I love the old screwball comedies, Cary Grant, Tracy & Hepburn, and I loved Peter Seller's Inspector Clouseau. These were comparisons Hewlett made for his film, and it caught my interest on a level other than sci-fi (spoken reverently).

So, when I popped this little indie film into my DVD and started watching, several things happened. 1) I fell in love with Mars the dog, totally and completely!  2) I adored Kate Hewlett (even though she'd already won me over in ""McKay and Mrs. Miller"" (Atlantis reference))  3) Discovered Paul McGillion was hilarious  4) Tried to mimic Chris Judge's fantastic facial expressions, and 5) I totally loved the screwball, far-fetched and often exceedingly clever film

Silly? Oh ya. Goofy? Most definitely. Over the top? You betcha. But, it also had this core of sweetness (not sloppy, icky, sticky sweetness, but good, warm, real sweetness), a warmth running through it that was subtle and unmistakable. The behind-the-scenes stuff on the DVD opened me up to the Dog's Breakfast ""inner circle"" so I felt a part of the movie and the inside jokes, which is not only a clever marketing angle, but it also increased my enjoyment and gave me a real connection to the crew and the film...and made me salivate (my homage to Mars) in anticipation of their next film.

So, bottom line: fun movie with a lot of energy, nice subtle yet warm ""moral,"" laughs galore, a few groans of mock-agony as it went over the top here and there, and I grinned, giggled and laughed out loud through the entire film. And I wanted a signed photo of Mars in the worst way! LOL

I own the movie and have watched it multiple times. I'm thinking it's going to be a great Christmas gift....",1197331200,,2325,4.795
1203585,5,B00000F5WY,"I have to admit that I was pleasently surprised by ""A Dog's Breakfast"". I origionally bought it because of David Hewlett and only HOPED that I would like the movie. In less than a month I have seen it six times simply because it is one of the best movies I have seen. It's a family-friendly murder mystery that keeps you wondering what in the blue-blazes is going on right until the end. Parts had me laughing so hard I was crying.

David Hewlett is halarious as Patrick and Kate Hewlett shines as his sister. Paul McGillion is a riot as the somewhat clueless Ryan, but you love them all despite--or because of--their rather odd quirks.

This is a movie for anyone and everyone--and I really do mean that. I have rarely enjoyed a movie so much. It is sweet and twisted all at the same time, and weirdly enough it works well!

I highly recommend this movie for anyone who likes something that's just silly enough to be charming--and then be happily surprised in the end.",1196294400,,969,4.463276836158192

It is highly creative, pulling traditional sight gags and slapstick comedy mixed in with some very unexpected (and dark) twists. The humor can be enjoyed by everyone and serves as a good lesson to or about those that are set in their ways and make judgements too quickly. The use of camera angles and sight gags v. expensive special effects is excellent and works very, very well - without being sophmoric, cheesy or corny.

I will admit to being a Stargate SG-1 and Atlantis fan (and David Hewlett fan) so maybe I was predisposed since the cast and crew is from those shows, but I honestly think anyone will find the movie quite entertaining - and I think it is suitable for most but the youngest family members.  It reminded me many times of British comedy (so if you don't like darker British-type humor maybe skip it).  There are just some laugh out loud funny moments too.

David Hewlett's comic prowess is perfect in this movie about a brother who wants to protect his sister, and more importantly, himself.  The casting was perfect and seeing Chris Judge as the would-be suitor is just too good (not to mention Det. Morse, but I won't give anything away).  The music was a dead-on fit, from the bits of the TV show to the ""murder"" scenes.  All in all, a very good film and fun to watch.

Knowing it was a fairly low-budget Canadian film (I am Canadian, but find it hard to get into most Canadian tv and films, but that's a topic for another rant), I tried not to let my hopes get too high.  I thought it would likely be vaguely entertaining.  But this movie totally blew away my expectations.  I was laughing through and through from the get go all the way to the end.  It is a brilliant (in the smart sense of the word) comedy, mixing pure wit, excellent timing, and well-done physical comedy.  I think everyone will find that they can identify with the characters in this movie to a certain extent, and the limited set really adds to the atmosphere rather than taking it away.

I've watched it through at least three and a half times now - all within a week of receiving it from Amazon - including half with the commentary that I intend to finish (I was interrupted).

I showed A Dog's Breakfast to my family over Thanksgiving weekend, and my dad stayed awake for it: always the hallmark of a GOOD film. As this is David Hewlett's first film, I wasn't sure what to expect. However, it was even better than I anticipated. In fact, I've now watched the film three times and know it will be something I watch again and again and again. Oh, and I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised by the special features. Not only was there a wonderful commentary, but great behind-the-scene featurettes as well. I mean, that's pretty impressive for an Indie film. I know I've come across DVDs for movies with much bigger budgets that barely had any special features at all. So if you're a fan of comedy, especially British comedy, or physical comedy like Fawlty Towers or the Pink Panter films, then you really should watch A Dog's Breakfast.

Also watch for a hilarious cameo by Christopher Judge. Well worth the money, you'll love this film and want to share it with everyone you know.

I had already seen 2 screenings of this film before it was available thanks to an Atlantis convention and a local film festival. I still could not wait to get my hands on a disk. The brother / sister interplay is fantastic, no doubt helped by the fact that Marilyn is played by David's real life sister Kate.  Mars (playing himself) is just brilliant. That a low budget movie like this gets such a relatively large release via MGM should give an idea of its quality.  My only disappointment is that it is only Region 1.

The true mark of his talent is exemplified by his ability to make you despise his personality in his original role as McKay in SG-1, and to slowly make that character endearing using the same personality with subtle nuances.  He truly is a brilliant actor and, as proven here, director as well.

This movie reminded me more of a British type comedy, such as 'Shallow Grave' or 'Keeping Mum'.  The humor was dark, but the characters are likable (unlike 'Shallow Grave').  David and his sister Kate have massive on screen chemistry.  They worked well together in an episode of Atlantis too ('McKay and Mrs Miller').  They should definitely do more together!

1203892,5,B00000F5WY,"I've been eagerly awaiting the chance to see A Dog's Breakfast since hearing about it through the Stargate Atlantis fan grapevine.  I'm an unabashed David Hewlett fan, and I must say that with all the fan hype and excitement, I wasn't disappointed in the final result.  And usually the more people who scream how incredibly awesome something is, the less I end up liking it.

I laughed, I snorted, I barked and convulsed with laughter all throughout the movie.  The closest comparison I can give this movie without giving away all the delicious plot twists and turns is that A Dog's Breakfast is a hilarious twist on the dark classic Poe's ""The Telltale Heart"".

David is a wonderful physical comedian, and Paul... well, Paul McGillion isn't just a great sport with all the physical abuse he had to endure, but he also has such a fantastic onscreen chemistry with Kate Hewlett that really added sparkle to his performance.

As for Mars... sweet, adorable Mars the dog - David and Jane did a spectacular job showing off Mars' wondrous personality to the benefit of the movie.  (And pet wrangling is enough of a hassle when you've got critters specially trained for the task, too)  I particularly loved the doggy snoring and growling.  Chris Judge I just wanted to bring home and cuddle with, he was so sweet and adorable.  Which of course made his character's plight that much more hilarious in its irony.

I will admit there could've been a little more polishing in the overall running time with (and pacing of) the story, but all in all I would highly recommend A Dog's Breakfast to everyone I know.  As a matter of fact, I plan on buying many copies and giving them for Christmas presents this year!

1203948,5,B00000F5WY,"After the first time I watched the trailer, I knew I must see this film.

""A Dog's Breakfast"" is reminiscent of the old school black comedies like ""Arsenic and Old Lace"", ""The Trouble With Harry"", and ""A Comedy of Terrors"". It's simple, funny, and twisted with quirky characters and great dialogue.

The acting goes above and beyond. The chemistry between David Hewlett, Kate Hewlett, and Paul McGillion is phenomenal. And the story is an anticipation-filled gigglefest with an appropriately twisted ending.

From the purposely painfully bad dialogue of Starcrossed that had me cringing to the slapstick that had me rolling; the girly screams of David Hewlett that had me cackling to the karaoke that had me twitching; the man-dog toothbrush sharing that had me gagging to the ""date"" that had me giggling, I completely and totally enjoyed this movie.

It is an excellent dark comedy, with elements of slapstick sprinkled generously throughout. At times reminiscent of another great black comedy, Hitchcock's ""The Trouble with Harry.""

  All of the performances are top-notch, with Kate Hewlett as a particular stand-out.  The interplay between brother and sister Patrick and Marilyn, portrayed by real-life siblings David and Kate Hewlett, was both hilarious and heart-warming- very true to life.  Many of the films best moments occur between these two characters.

  The premise, while not entirely new or unpredictable, was well-presented.  The film could have benefited from a longer, stronger resolution, the end coming hot on the heels of the reveal leaving the viewer without any sense of closure.

  All in all, A Dog's Breakfast is a first class first effort.  I'm am looking forward to more films written and directed by David Hewlett, and hope that the success of this film will lead to larger future releases.",1190160000,,1123,5.161111111111111

Very remniscent of the earlier film in the Hewlett catalog ""Nothing"" as far as the humor goes.  I spent the movie alternating between laughing out loud, trying to look away from the screen (without success), and on the edge of my seat trying to decide where they were actually going with the story.  Plus, the appearance of several Stargate alums and just the clips we get of the spoof show ""Starcrossed"" are nice little Easter eggs for long time fans.  The on-screen chemistry between real life brother and sister David and Kate is beautiful to the level of John and Joan Cusack.

When he overhears Ryan plotting to murder said sister, he's even less so. Cue a not-quite-fatal-enough comedy of errors as Patrick tries to off Ryan, then cover up his crime, with his best friend, Mars the dog, looking on hungrily.

A Dog's Breakfast marks the writing and directorial debut of actor David Hewlett, proving without question that he's a man of many talents. If you're already familiar with Hewlett's award-winning character, Doctor Rodney McKay of Stargate Atlantis, multiply McKay's neurotic personality by about a billion, and you'll have a notion of what Patrick is like. You may already be familiar with Patrick's sister, Marilyn, as well: her portrayer, Kate Hewlett, David's real life sister, has also appeared alongside him (again as his sister, Jeannie) on Stargate Atlantis.

If you enjoyed their bickering in the episode ""McKay and Mrs. Miller"", I promise you that you will love this film, as their sibling rivalry, too, is magnified immensely. I really hope to see Kate in other projects -- the Hewlett family seems gifted with a humour gene! And Mars, David's dog in real life, appears just enough to satisfy those who love animals in movies (like me -- what a cutie!) without upsetting those who hate that sort of thing.

The film also features another Stargate Atlantis alumni, Paul McGillion (Dr. Carson Beckett on the series) as sci fi soap actor Ryan -- and in drag, as Ryan's wickedly funny Scottish detective aunt! Stargate SG-1's Christopher Judge (Teal'c on that series) puts in an amusing cameo. (It's so interesting to see the ""real"" Judge, without Teal'c's somber, deep-voiced affectations!)

But you don't have to be a Stargate fan to appreciate this film, which is really of a very different genre (dark comedy) -- I like it far better than the genre's ""classic"", A Fish Called Wanda, too! A Dog's Breakfast is chock-full of great little twists, delightful absurdity, and brilliant comic timing, certain to please any true moviehound's palate!

Also, fans of Stargate will be delighted to see some familiar faces popping up. The movie isn't just darkly funny - it's got a few fun little twists that will leave you VERY impressed!

My favorite performance was probably from the canine participant: dog Mars is such a cutie that he can't help but steal the show! The human acting in the film WAS very good, however.

A word of caution is in order: the movie seems to be unrated, and I would NOT watch it with my child (I saw someone on IMDb say it was ""fun for the whole family""--yeah, if you're the Addams family). Much of the humor is sick, so if you don't like sick humor, steer clear.

If you DO like twisted humor, this movie has a lot for you. Patrick is the deeply disturbed older brother of Marilyn, who is engaged to SF/soap star Ryan. Patrick can't stand Ryan (and no doubt would feel the same towards anyone she brought home), who tries be friendly to Patrick and yet pushes all the wrong buttons (not that Patrick needs much help with that).  The first half is screamingly funny, but the film turns darker as it progresses. Hang in there, though: there are more payoffs to come, from David Hewlett's very expressive face to sight gags to slapstick. A few scenes from the space soap ""Star Crossed"" parody science fiction shows in general (oh, the dialogue is dreadful!).  Quite a debut for the writer/director!",1184457600,,1166,4.413953488372093

On a whole it's not bad for a directorial debut, but there was room for improvement. Had there been the option of half stars I would have given this a 2.5, but I rounded up to be nice.

While the movie obviously was to focus a bit more on the character Patrick (David Hewlett) as opposed to Marilyn (Kate Hewlett) and Ryan (Paul McGillion) or all three, in my opinion it was too much, a better balance of the three characters would have been better suited. This is the case in the first part of the film and I what found it to be the funniest. This was when I found myself laughing out loud. But soon the focus shifts mainly to Patrick. The jokes and antics of Patrick get old and predictable as the movie goes on. Many are very slapstick, which can be either hilarious or stupid. Sadly, many of the over-the-top slapstick gags were painful to watch. The end of the movie could have been much funnier had the other characters, Marilyn, Ryan and ""Detective Morris"", been given more attention in the film. Even in the scenes they are in, the focus is always on Patrick. The climax at the end was far to fast for my own personal taste and wrapped up too quickly. I assume the ending was to be a surprise twist, but it was easily detectible half way through the movie. And the revel scene at the end was more disturbing than funny.

The acting was enjoyable. Kate Hewlett is a joy to watch on screen and obviously has great chemistry with Paul McGillion and her brother David. McGillion was wonderful pulling out three roles, even if the writing for the ""detective"" role fell horribly flat. David Hewlett played the obnoxious and quirky brother well, but it wasn't much of a stretch from his current role on Stargate: Atlantis. Mars the dog was adorable at all times.

I know the internet was the largest, possibly the only, venue that this film was marketed on. I think it is definitely a way for independents to get noticed, but I am a bit suspicious of the total hit counts the YouTube trailer received. The trailer is embedded on the director's (David Hewlett) website and set on auto start (+94k hits come from his website). I also find it odd that the download is available before the tangible DVD. I hope this isn't a test and a way to push back or cancel the DVD release or a worldwide release.

If this has been theatrically released I would say its better off to rent than to see in the theater. However with this film your only options are downloading it or buying it. Since I think Unbox is a terrible program, I suggest downloading it off of iTunes, which is the lesser of two evils.

Clever costuming really added to my enjoyment of the film - just quirky
enough to establish character without distracting from the story.  Marilyn's dresses in particular revealed as much about her as Ms. Hewlett's entertaining performance.

Director Hewlett used wide angle shots with a stationary camera to great effect for some of the outdoor scenes without overdoing it - the choices he made really added to the mood of the film.  And actor Hewlett's expressive face and hilarious delivery made Patrick a very real person instead of the caricature that he easily could have become.

One small quibble - this is NOT a horror movie! Dark comedy in the hilarious mannered style of 'The Pink Panther' or 'A Fish Called Wanda', yes.  Horror? Not so much. Which is fine by me!

For all of you afraid of this option, it was very easy to install the program and get it running.  Now on to the good stuff:

This movie is well written, well acted, and very funny. The Hewlett siblings with McGillion as main characters were just amazing. Mars earned his kibbles to be sure.

Co-star Paul McGillion does a lovely job of playing his character straight, especially given the nature of the role.  Fans of ""Stargate: Atlantis"" will get an extra kick out of the in-film science fiction show in which Paul's character stars.  Watch out for some fun cameos!

Kate Hewlett plays the perfect exasperated, but loving, sister.  Talent definitely runs in the family.

Mars, the dog, is a complete scene stealer.

David Hewlett and writing partner, Jane Loughman, created a charming gem which was made great by the cast and directing.  It's refreshing to see a film that isn't afraid to do whatever it takes for a laugh.

David Hewlett has managed to create a film that evokes all the fun about the ""old-fashioned"" dark comedy.  Think ""Arsenic and Old Lace"" or ""A Fish Called Wanda"" with a little Peter Sellers and some Fawlty Towers thrown in.

It's a wonderful, family-friendly film about a rather dysfunctional guy who can't even manage to do murder correctly.  (The ""violence"" is all implied, in case you're squeamish like I am.) It not only features a great performance from David himself, but you also throw in his real-life sister Kate Hewlett and his friend Paul McGillion and you get a whole lot of fun. (Look for David's dog Mars to steal several scenes while in the foreground and background.)

You might recognize all of these actors (and much of the listed crew) from the TV shows Stargate Atlantis and Stargate SG-1.  If you're a fan of these shows, you'll really enjoy seeing everyone in a very different role.  If you're not a Stargate fan or even a sci-fi geek, no worries.

Paul McGillion also does an excellent job as Ryan, Marilyn's movie star fiance'.  Great Movie!!!",1182902400,,481,4.690476190476191
1204174,5,B00000F5WY,"For once, I knew nothing about the film I was about to see (other than what I'd gleaned from the trailers, of course), so it was really refreshing to sit down and be taken along by the plot. Having flown through all three seasons of SGA in two months (it would've been quicker, but Christmas beckoned), it was obvious that the acting was going to be of a high standard, but I was mainly interested in the writing and how well it translated to screen.

The plot itself is pretty simple (not in a bad way), and I'm surprised it hasn't been done before. Is a great concept that everyone can understand on some level; annoying brother/father/grandfather, it's happened enough for people to get that. I loved the impression presented that the dog kept digging up the body, not only because Mars is possibly one of the cutest dogs ever, but also because I remember my dog digging up our hamsters once shortly after we buried them - not quite the same, but believable in a surrealist way! And the unexpected ending, which I was only vaguely considering for about 5 seconds before dismissing it was a fantastic variation on a theme that only improved it.

I know some people were saying a general audience wouldn't understand most of it because of all the Stargate references - 'Starcrossed' is funny in a different way if you know who plays what in Atlantis, but that doesn't stop it from being a funny sci-fi parody in its' own right. I'm sure there are people who didn't get the clutching of ""The Tell-Tale Heart"" in one scene, but it hardly matters overall.

Likewise, the cross-dressing - it's always funnier if you know who the actor is, but it's still funny because it's the macho-type guy you just saw, dressed as a scary, middle-aged Scottish woman.

The shooting of it was interesting. Whether it was due to budget concerns, directing or cameraman choice, nothing was overly complicated and it looked every bit a well put together indie type film. The thing I was most impressed with (apart from the line ""Dance monkey dance"", because that's a daily utterance in our house) is how well the silence worked. It wasn't a bombardment of slapstick and unecessary build-up to beat laughs out of the audience, it was just... funny - you know something is going to happen eventually, and the build-up via daily routine or whatever makes you want to laugh even though nothing is actually happening. It's hard to get that sometimes, so it's probably one of the more strangely geeky things I enjoyed.

I can't really think of any downsides to the film...oh, apart from the clown. I hate clowns, and it kept freaking me out, just being there. Watching.

And Paul McGillion's legs, but I mostly put that down to jealousy.",1182902400,,2710,4.658995815899582

Basically, it's a hysterical comedy with lots of Python-esque humor. Paul McGillion really shows his range in this one, and of course the Hewlett 'team' (brother David and sister Kate) play well off each other.

If you are a fan of the Stargate's you'll know the whole cast but even if you aren't a ""Gate"" fan, you'll enjoy this wonderfully quirky movie.

We took our two kids, ages 7 and 13, to a couple of screenings and they laughed right along with us. Fun for the whole family! Do yourself a favour and watch this gem. And then watch for anything else Mr. Hewlett decides to make.",1182556800,,561,4.73469387755102
1204260,5,B00000F5WY,"It's hard to review a movie like this without giving anything away, and I don't want to write any spoilers. So to start, I recommend everyone tries to see it.

One can already see how hilarious it is by the trailer and the few clips on the show, but let me tell you... it gets even BETTER!!

The acting is great, but if you're a fan of the Stargates, then you already know that. And Kate Hewlett, the female star, has theatrical experience, and I guess good acting is genetic in the Hewlett family. Along with the sense of humor. The sibling rivalry in the movie is great to see, and even funnier knowing that David and Kate actually are brother and sister. I can't even comment on Paul McGillion, 'cause I'd be giving away stuff, but let me pause for a second and giggle madly!! *ROFLMAO* OK, back. The other roles were fairly short, all the actors were great, and I personally hope that we'll get to see ""Starcrossed"" - the space opera in the movie that is to become a real TV-show soon, so we can see what Paul and Rachel can do in a comedic role (and even if that's not the direction it will take, and even if Paul and Rachel weren't in it, I'd still want to see it. It was so cheesy it was hilarious!!). A special mention goes to Mars, the poster-dog for the movie. Handsome, very natural, and apparently all he asked to do his job was a little doggie biscuit from his friends!

Again, it's hard to say more without giving bits away, and every little clip from the movie is worth watching without knowing what will happen... even though the second time you watch the movie (personal experience), you'll enjoy it even more. For one, you'll be able to hear all the lines you've missed from laughing to hard the first time around, and you'll be able to see things without the blur of tears (again from laughter). And you'll notice all the funny details that you couldn't focus the first time, when you were focused on the main story.

It is a low-budget movie, but you'd never know if they didn't tell you. The way it's shot, everything makes perfect sense, and I really don't see how a lot more money could have made any difference (expect, of course, in making people happier!).

And I wish I could say more, but again I'd go into spoiler-area.

So from giggling, to laughing out loud, from going ""ewww"", to seeing a lot more David Hewlett than you've ever wanted to see (or finally enough!, depending on your point of view!), you'll want to watch this movie again and again, ask for a REAL theatrical release by MGM, or at least that the DVDs come out soon!! OK, I just re-ran a little clip in my head, laughed, and the people around me looked at me as if I were nuts. Hope that if you've seen the movie you aren't reading about it in a public place!",1182556800,,2755,4.339805825242719
1204321,5,B00000F5WY,"I've been lucky enough to see a number of screening of this movie, and am really looking forward to it coming out on DVD. I can honestly say that it is one the funniest movies I've ever seen. The main cast is brilliant, and Kate Hewlett is not only a wonderful actress, she's wickedly funny in her role as Marilyn. This movie is pretty family safe, and we took our children, ages 8 and 13, to see it as well. Both of them laughed through the entire thing, though of course some of the humour went over their heads. For a movie made on a very small, very tight budget, I found it more appealing them some of the resent Hollywood mega-films. This is a movie I will most certainly buy, and one that I have been recommending to friends and family. If you like your comedy with a dark bite to it, then this is the film for you.",1182470400,,822,4.14375
1204322,5,B00000F5WY,"I had the pleasure of catching a UK screening of this film and I have not laughed so hard in ages, and not just the occasional laugh but almost throughout the film. The pace was good, the visual jokes alternating between sudden and between that slow build up when you know what is going to happen and it feels like you are watching a train wreck in the making, and you laugh all the harder for it. All the cast were in top form, including the dog.
I was tempted to drop one star rating (from 5 to 4) because there was one small segment near the middle that seemed a slower pace but then I compared the film to other comedies I had seen in the past few years and realized that those comedies were dull in comparison, generating far fewer laughs for my money!

1204324,5,B00000F5WY,"Being one of the lucky few to see this film at the time of writing, I am excited for everyone who hasn't seen this. I'm happy that at last that you will be able to see this at home soon.

I can safely say that this film surpassed even my expectations (unsurprisingly high) and it did not disappoint. Given that this is David Hewlett's directing debut (no doubt under the watchful gaze of long time Yoda and chum, Vincenzo Natali among others)Hewlett exhibits a creative flair that marks this film out as distinctively his own. Natali et al were not the crutch for this project that I had feared. Newbie Hewlett seems to have successfully navigated what was probably a mle of creative advice well.

David himself does not hide the fact that he has had to beg, borrow and steal resources to get this film made and producer (fiance) Jane Loughman has done a remarkable job bringing this film to fruition on such a tiny budget. What this man could do given bigger budget doesn't bare thinking about . He does seem to have wet the appetite of (DVD only) distributor MGM who have commissioned a pilot of 'starcrossed' (the spoof sci-fi featured in the film). Lets hope that this relationship continues.

Hewlett demonstrates a witty, style of expression and originality unusual for a first time director. An entertainment focused screenplay, it has no pretensions and does not take itself too seriously. It doesn't make too many demands on the audience but it doesn't require you to leave your brain at the door either, a perfect balance. The film is a real testament to the director's ingenuity and understanding of his medium. I would like to see him in the future try out some different genres. A Horror does seem to be in the pre-production stages (working title Design of the Dead).

I personally love extremity of character, and Hewlett's performance as the endearing Patrick demonstrated well paced comic timing and relished in the sort of classy but not too crude slapstick that Peter Sellers would have been proud of. Similarly Paul McGillion as Ryan plays well off of Hewlett. Cynics (who have not seen the movie!) may say that their on screen chemistry is already well known and pre-established outside of the film's parameters and that this assumption is a requirement to fully enjoy the film. I would answer by saying that this film dispells the myth that you would to have seen Stargate Atlantis to appreciate 'in jokes'. There simply aren't any. Where would we be if that same argument were levied at anyone 'writing and influenced by what they know'?. Many who have never heard the word Stargate have absolutely loved it.

I also wondered whether one of the more memorable scenes involving THAT dressing gown and McGillion, had been at all influenced by Cary Grant in 'Bringing up Baby';-)?

I hope this is the first rung on the long ladder of Hewlett's directing career with preferably Jane supporting the ladder;-)

yup, the boy done good!",1182470400,,2951,4.7745098039215685
