5643443,5,B00BL9MOPS,"ENEMY AT THE GATES has grown on me. It focuses on the cat and mouse tactics employed by the German Major Konig (Ed Harris) and Soviet Vassily Zaitzev (Jude Law), both snipers trying to bring the other out into the open in the fight for Stalingrad during WWII. The film constantly shifts focus between the Soviet propaganda officer (Joseph Fiennes) and female Soviet soldier (Rachel Weisz) in a curious love triangle. This adds to the drama and gives it a human element. By the time of the denouement there is no emotion left. This is heartbreaking stuff. The only emotion felt, is delivered by James Horner's score during the scenes when the two men actually do confront each other. But the war, its devastation on personal humanity seems to be the focus here. The casting of Ed Harris is interesting. We kind of think that maybe he will not be that bad of a guy. When he arrives he uses a standard military salute when reporting. I thought that was significant. However, we see the fate of a young Russian boy who had been giving information to Major Konig throughout the film. That boy's fate brings to reality the true nature of this conflict.

THE BRIDGES AT TOKO-RI has always been one of my favorite movies. The principal characters are William Holden as Lt. Harry Brubaker USNR, Grace Kelly as his wife Nancy, Fredric March as Rear Admiral George Tarrant, Mickey Rooney as Mike Forney a helicopter rescue pilot and Charles McGraw as Commander Wayne Lee leader of the jet fighter group. THE BRIDGES AT TOKO-RI is a very moving film. The sacrifices that some are called upon to make are often gone untold. This film reminds us of those sacrifices in brilliant almost unsettling color images. When you see William Holden's final scene and then think back to a prior scene of Holden with his family, the message hits home. We see Fredric March on the bridge of the aircraft carrier reflect on the news of Holden. March unknown to Holden kept a watchful eye on him as if he were his own son. When the ultimate sacrifice is made, men in command must stand strong, yet inwardly mourn the loss only to themselves. The sacrifice has not gone unrecognized. It is a simple but powerful message.

HELL IS FOR HEROES so we are told. Was there ever a man more misunderstood? Steve McQueen plays a soldier who lives only for the thrill of combat. His character is cold and frightening and borders on the psychotic. He's a sociopath who carves up German soldiers with a butcher knife. After the war there is no going back for him. I saw this when I was a kid. I saw a lot of war movies in the theatre back then but this was the first one that really scared me. It gave me a sick feeling inside of how real war must be like. The scene with the bayonets and landmines left an impact on me for a long time after. Everyone in this film gave realistic performances but I remember how Steve McQueen's character seemed really demented. Yet despite the obvious psychological makeup of McQueen is there still a human being hidden deep within him. What is a hero? Don Siegel directed this tough and mean film and asks this profound question. Cinematographer Harold Lipstein's photography brings stark realism to this film. Composer Leonard Rosenman's score is very reminiscent of his brilliant work for the very popular W.W.II television series ""Combat!"" which ran for 5 years. This film also boasted a brilliant cast. Bobby Darin, James Coburn, Fess Parker, L.Q. Jones, Nick Adams, Harry Guardino, Mike Kellin and Bob Newhart are all featured. This is an underrated classic. HELL IS FOR HEROES is brutal heroism.

DEFIANCE is a film based an actual events during WWII. I was drawn to simply because of Daniel Craig. The turn of events and the strengths and weaknesses of some of its characters is interesting. This is the drama of the Polish Jewish Bielski brothers: Tuvia (Daniel Craig), Zus (Liev Schreiber), Asael (Jamie Bell), and Aron (George MacKay) that struggled to save the lives of approximately 1200 Jews during the Nazi Holocaust in World War II. This was directed by Edward Zwick who directed GLORY, THE LAST SAMURAI AND LEGENDS OF THE FALL. Daniel Craig becomes the leader and gives a complex performance as someone who must be up for the challenge of leadership. He is at times restrained and at other times explosive. Liev Schreiber, giving a very strong performance, does not stay with the group, but instead joins a local company of Soviet partisans. This is a great story of survival and not giving up against insurmountable odds.",1414972800,7,4531,4.69685534591195

5643448,4,B00BL9MOPS,"Varied"" is the key word.  This is quite an unusual collection, because of the movie (and historical) eras it represents. Three of the four are set in World War II, but present the conflict in a multi-level way--no simplistic jingoistics or flagwaving, here.  In fact, only one of the three focuses on the American war experience--and I suspect that this is one reason why there are so few reviews.  This ain't John Wayne land!

The most ""traditional"" take of the three WWII stories is Hell is for Heroes, but, when it was made (1962), the troubled film presented its players as ""tragic"" rather than ""heroic,"" in a drama in which (gasp!) many die before final credits roll.  As he did repeatedly in his career, director Don Siegel, fought his own familiar battle against a miniscule budget and wrested some good performances from youthful, still-developing talent.  And what talent! The cast alone makes this a fascinating entry: Steve McQueen, Bobby Darin, Bob Newhart, Nick Adams and James Coburn.

Enemy at the Gates (2001) is not a typical war movie (despite some riveting big-scene Stalingrad combat sequences) but a ""gun-fighter showdown"" drama between warring snipers, one Russian (Jude Law) and one German (Ed Harris.) So this is a very ""personal"" or ""human"" story, but one balancing scope--well-mounted and thoroughly convincing-- with intimacy.  Great movie.

In Defiance, the newest entry (2008) tight direction, convincing settings and good performances elevate a familiar ""against-all-odds"" plot, giving us a rousingly good adventure film, and the only one of the four focused on an actual wartime episode. Daniel Craig stars as one of three brothers leading a rag-tag group of Eastern European Jews away from Nazi ghetto death and into sheltering forests. Shot near actual locations, Defiance ""beefs up"" reality (the group never did combat German forces) for the sake of drama--but that kind of literary license is okay by me. Good flick.

 The oldest of the four is the Korean War film, Bridges at Toko Ri (1954) taken from James Michener's best-selling novel. Like most pre-1980s action movies, it suffers from primitive special effects, notably the miniature flying sequences, (so stunning at the time, however, that they won the Oscar.) That aside, there is much to like, as the story is a moving, emotional build-up for the final action sequence. That makes this a good one for stars William Holden and Grace Kelly--and for us, succeeding in capturing the human side of conflict as did the Vietnam War drama Coming Home, for a later generation.  The fire-fight in the ditch, with Mickey Rooney's standout performance as rescue chopper pilot, is a top-notch gut-grabber.",1384905600,16,2687,5.1235697940503435
