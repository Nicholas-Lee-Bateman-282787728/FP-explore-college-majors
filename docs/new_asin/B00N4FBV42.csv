8676225,4,B00N4FBV42,"I had seen this film many years ago and thought it a good one then.  My recollection is that I first saw a version dubbed in English.  While this version had English subtitles, it was easy to read and follow;  I found it just as good or better than I remembered.  Of note, the trivia/goofs that accompanied the Amazon Video streaming version stated that some of the uniforms, including Kappler's, lacked SS insignia.  This is incorrect.  These uniforms had the blank right collar tabs and the SD diamond shaped sleeve patch of the Security Service (""Sichereits Dienst des Reichsfuhrer-SS"") of the SS, which was  correct for Kappler and his men.  The SD was the primary Nazi intelligence service, which had combined responsibilities, more or less, of those separated into the FBI and CIA in the US .  The SD was not the criminal police (""Kripo"") or secret state police (""Gestapo"").  Neither was the SD the security police (""SiPo"") which is a term used incorrectly in the film.  Given this discussion, it is easy to see why Kappler and his men were awkward, hesitant and inexperienced in carrying out the executions.",1489968000,,1114,4.810526315789474
8676226,5,B00N4FBV42,"Powerful film showing the cruel absurd futility of the Nazi military at the end of the Nazi occupation of Italy. Col Kappler (Richard Burton) abdicates his own conscience (beautifully played by Marcello Mastroianni in the role of an art restoring priest Father Antonelli). Parallel to the abdication of conscience by Nazi leadership is the Pope's unwillingness to see reality and save the lives of men condemned for no reason as reprisal for an ambush that took place on a Roman street in which the condemned men played no part. The Pope refuses to step in for reasons that have nothing whatever to do with life in the real world. His insane fear is that when the Nazis leave, the Communists will come in, all this while the Americans are days from liberating Italy. Stunningly filmed, effective sound track. really great film.",1482883200,,827,4.872340425531915
