4273287,1,B00471JT0K,"I trust my fellow H5O fans on what has happened to season 10 and how CBS/Paramount has gone bush league on us again, expecting us to buy this ""Garbage"" no matter how bad it is !
I almost purchased this product at a local ""Vintage Stock"" today but noticed how the front and rear cover look like a 5 year old put it together.
The actors faces look all stretched out and 2 photos of Jack Lord are reversed on the rear packaging, not to mention the awful digitally enhanced picture on the cover.
Did anyone proof check this thing !
Now we all find out the season-10 episodes look like something put out by Alpha Entertainment.
No Video or Audio enhancement !
Will CBS ever learn their lesson that they cannot screw over their customer !",1293667200,18,732,4.350364963503649
4273288,1,B00471JT0K,"As an avid Five-0 fan, I eagerly await each new release.  The video quality of season 10 is so poor that you would expect to find it in the $5 bargain bin at Wal-Mart.  This is a slap in the face to all of the faithful that have purchased the first 9 seasons.  At first I thought I was having a problem with my equipment.  After testing the collection on two different systems as well as a PC I realized that CBS & Paramount had ripped me off.  It's too bad this wasn't produced by a reputable company like Disney.  When they release old films they have truly remastered them.",1293321600,71,576,4.1909090909090905
4273289,1,B00471JT0K,"What the hell happened with season 10 of Hawaii Five-O? The video is of poor quality. No remastering at all, or maybe 1%. And the audio is not that great as well. Why did that have to do such a lousy job? Seasons 1-9 are digitally remastered very well. They should have a recall for season 10. I just hope the remaining 2 seasons are done the right way. This is what I call CHEAP LABOR!",1293321600,20,386,4.092105263157895
4273290,1,B00471JT0K,"The tenth season of HFO has absolutely NOT been remastered. I bought this for Christmas thinking that it would be the same quality as all the other seasons. Boy was I wrong. I've seen VHS tapes taken from old television reruns that look and sound better than these dvd's. This whole season reeks of being thrown together overnight, and they want $37.00 for this garbage! I feel like I've been totally scammed here. This effort would be worth 5 or 6 dollars at best. Save your money, don't get ripped off.

Edit: They have since raised the price to $39.00. Nice.",1293235200,92,561,4.554455445544554
4273291,1,B00471JT0K,"Paramount/CBS has really screwed up on Season 10 of Hawaii 5-0.
The audio is terrible.  The volume level is way too low.
There is no depth to the audio even when you turn it up on your monitor.
This set should be recalled and redone!  The previous 9 seasons were well done, but they really messed up on this one.",1293062400,37,312,4.183333333333334
4273292,1,B00471JT0K,"I have purchased and own all of the previous nine seasons of Hawaii Five-O.This is perhaps the best television series ever made. My ultimate goal was to eventually own the entire series on dvd...all 12 seasons. I own many other CBS/Paramount dvd set releases of television series and movies. The quality has always been top notch. I have often told friends how the remastering of older tv shows by CBS/Paramount has been beyond belief !!!.Bright,sharp,crisp,vivid,clear and colorful images that simply pop off the screen. It all ends with the tenth season release of Hawaii Five-O by CBS/Paramount. A transfer that one would expect from a two bit unknown studio. Either Hawaii Five O went from recording on film (to) video tape for season 10,which would explain the sub standard video quality,or it is a poor transfer from CBS/Paramount. Season 10 was released unusually soon after season 9,no doubt to increase sales due to the popular new Hawaii Five O,and benefit from Christmas sales. But if they took a shortcut on the remastering of season 10 due to this,shame on you CBS/Paramount. You will lose many loyal customers,and also your reputation.",1292976000,82,1149,5.052631578947368
4273293,3,B00471JT0K,"As it stands, I've randomly watched three of the 24 episodes on this set. First the positives - the three shows I've watched, 'Up The Rebels', 'Frozen Assets' and 'Deep Cover' have all been very good - in fact, much better than I was expecting. This was surprising because, in general, Season Ten is widely regarded as the 'jump the shark' season i.e. the first complete season in which the number of average or below average episodes outnumber the decent ones. Sure, there had been 'jump the shark' episodes before (these gained prominence circa Season Seven), but never was there a complete season in which the consensus was that it sucked. Anyway, as I say, I'm impressed thus far - ok, they're nowhere near the quality of earlier seasons, but compared to Magnum Season 1 (which I've just started watching), they're excellent and even when compared to a number of episodes from Mannix Season 3, Season 10 of Five-0 more than holds its own.

Now, the negatives - this set is by far and away the worst of the ten DVD releases thus far. Whilst I may have only watched three complete episodes, I've skimmed through all the rest. Many episodes are washed out and lack definition - colours are dull and there is noise which is highly visible. Ironically, one of the better 'remastered' episodes is 'Deep Cover' now compare that to some of the worse, such as 'You Don't See Many Pirates These Days' and you'll see the inconsistencies within the set. As a result, many of these episodes look older than those from its Season One counterpart (which were made ten years earlier).

The sound on these discs is also hit and miss - sadly more miss than hit. 'Up The Rebels', for example, contains a distracting background noise in certain scenes and, be prepared to turn the volume to high just to attain a 'comfortable' level of sound akin to regular DVD sets.

So, in comparison to earlier Five-0 releases, its questionable as to whether any 'remastering' actually has been undertaken (although the back of the set states it has..). That said, I've seen far worse so called re-mastering - check out the European Releases of Kojak Seasons 2 & 3 for that 'experience'. Generally this is a disappointing set - out of 5, this season scrapes a 3 for the show itself -  however, the DVD set just makes 2 (oh, there are no episodic trailers either).",1292976000,14,2334,4.657766990291262
4273294,1,B00471JT0K,"awful. The color is dull with no rich color and the sharpness looks almost out of focus.  Watching this season on the flat-screen TV is difficult to view because of the focus issue. On the old monitor-style TV, it's improved, but still not very good. Chalk that up to poor re-mastering, if it was even performed at all. I have seen better reproduction on old VHS tapes.  Seasons 1-9 did not have this re-mastering problem.  Why does season 10?  Very disappointed.  Also, the new dvd packaging that started being used in season 9 is once again used in season 10.  Cheap!! It will not protect the dvd's for the long term from scratches. This is not a comment about the show's review, just the quality of the product and packaging. No excuse why the consistency is lacking with season 10 re-mastering production, when season's 1 through 9 did not have this issue.",1292889600,18,860,4.625
4273295,1,B00471JT0K,"I only watched the first two episodes (because it's all I could stand), so maybe I'm not being fair to the entire set, but here's what I have to say about season 10. I've been collecting and watching every dvd season of Hawaii Five-O. Of course, the main reason has been because I love the show! The bonus has been that overall I've been amazed and surprised at the quality of the video and sound quality of these dvd sets for the earlier seasons. I have a 65 inch screen, and yet the picture quality has always looked great, even enlarged to this size. Just plain fun to watch! So when season 10 was released, I bought it without a second thought. Much to my surprise, the quality of the video and sound is so poor in in this season, it's distracting! I'm not sure what is contributing the most to the problem. It's either a poor transfer to dvd this time by the studio, or poor production values when they originally filmed this season, or both. Because the picture and sound is just downright lousy! Did they use cheaper film stock when they shot this? The picture is lifeless, colorless, blurry and dark, and in regards to sound quality, voices are muffled, with lots of background noise in most scenes. It's hard to hear what anyone's saying. That's all I could take.  It's so bad that it drove me to write this review. If picture and sound quality matter to you, then you may want to think twice about purchasing this season.",1292803200,22,1431,4.44106463878327

4273299,5,B00471JT0K,"""Hawaii Five-O"" is one of the most entertaining and iconic detective shows in the history of television. Its tenth season continues to follow the exploits of Detective Captain Steve McGarrett, who serves as the head of the Hawaiian State Police Special Task Force known as Hawaii Five-O. Jack Lord delivers a perennially outstanding performance portraying the unflappable and intrepid Captain Steve McGarrett, in his mission to vanquish the criminal element in Hawaii. Although ""Hawaii Five-O"" now comes across as being somewhat comical, because its initial episodes are almost fifty-years-old, most viewers still find it to be enjoyable, especially because of the spectacular Hawaiian scenery. Therefore, I give ""Hawaii Five-O"" a five-star rating, along with my highest recommendation.",1485561600,,786,5.726495726495727

I don't agree that the stories are not as good as previous seasons, they're just different. I like the direction that Jack Lord took the show after the first producer, Freeman, died halfway through the run. The later seasons from season 8 are less violent, more human interest stories, and use more cultural references of Hawaii throughout the islands. And there's some exceptional episodes in these later seasons that demonstrate an ability to experiment with pushing the envelope. An example is season 10 ""A Short Walk on the Longshore"" that, in my opinion, ranks among one of the best episodes in the entire 12 year run. So it's worth getting this season.

4273403,4,B00471JT0K,"As others have complained, the picture quality is not quite up to the standards of the previous nine seasons but the tenth season is still a keeper because this season continued the trend of good storytelling and superb guest casting.

Though many of this season's episodes were retreads of past productions, there is enough of a difference to make them as intriguing as their predecessors.

Regarding the stellar casting, the field is filled with movie stars, up-and-comers, and veteran and highly-respected character actors.  Stephen Boyd, Jean Simmons, Rossano Brazzi, Geraldine Page, Carol Lynley, Lucianna Paluzzi, Eleanor Parker, and Peter Lawford are just some of the acting heavyweights who graced the stories from the 77-78 season.  Other actors who were just a few years away from stardom include Kurt Russell, Vic Tayback, Gil Girard, and Michael Conrad.

And two-time Bond girl Maud Adams guests as a murderous leader of a conspiracy to infiltrate America's naval forces.

Series regular Richard Denning as the ""Governor"" gets much screen time this year, even getting referred to by his rarely-heard first name in an discussion with Jack Lord's McGarrett.

The season ends on a downer with the appropriately-titled ""A Death in the Family"" which sees the demise of a longtime cast member.  This installment bookends the other best episode, the season opener, ""Up the Rebels"" with Boyd.

As other seasons, there are no extras and that is unfortunate for those fans that wouldn't mind some insight into the production and people behind one of the best crime dramas in television history.

The production and direction is very good. The filming sets are beautiful. The closed caption of the DVD is very detailed, and the font used, is easy to read. The DVD menus are beautiful. The Remastering is not so very bad like some people says, but is not so good like the previous seasons. Some scenes look like a (good quality) VHS tape and other scenes looks like the previous seasons remastering.

The guest stars, like Stephen Boyd, Kurt Russell, James B. Sikking, Michael Conrad, Sharon Farrell and Maud Adams are brilliant. This is the final season for Kam Fong as Chin Ho. In ""A Death in the Family"", (SPOILER ALERT!) Chin is killed by a mobster during a secret mission in downtown.

The episodes on this set are: ""Up the rebels"", ""You don't see many pirates these days"", ""The cop on the cover"", ""The friends of Joey Kalima"", ""Descent of the torches"", ""The ninth step"", ""Shake hands with the man on the moon"", ""Deadly doubles"", ""Deep cover"", ""Tsunami"", ""East wind--ill wind"", ""Tread the king's shadow"", ""The big aloha"", ""A short walk on the long shore"", ""The silk trap"", ""Head to head"", ""Tall on the wave"", ""Angel in blue"", ""When does a war end?"", ""Invitation to murder"", ""Frozen assets"", ""My friend, the enemy"", ""A stranger in his grave"" and ""A death in the family"".

Lord started the series playing a character younger than himself, and he was able to pull it off because of his athleticism and personal explosive style.  Steve McGarrett would explode with anger and other emotions as he and his team tried to solve cases.  It was often the 5-0 team that felt his fire:  ""Kono,if I didn't love you, I would punch you in the mouth!""

Watch an episode of season one and then one of season ten and you'll see a remarkable change in Steve McGarrett.  He's not the fire-breathing crime fighter of the first seasons: he seems to be focusing more on what to say than how to say it, chewing out the words often without much passion or none.  As Alzheimer's slowly crept up on Jack Lord, it stole some of his acting talent.

However, even operating at 80% of his normal skills, Jack still puts on a good show. (I just wish he had kept the hair style he started with instead of letting it and his sideburns grow out and his trouser legs flare.  The trade winds mussed him up something awful in a few episodes.)

Why on earth would CBS do such a horrific thing? I ordered the 10th Season of Hawaii Five-0 on the day it was first announced for release.  I waited a couple of months to receive the DVDs.  However, I was totally shocked at the insane quality.  It is even worse than I can even put into words, especially when watching this on an HDTV.  I've never seen such poor quality video, not to even mention the extremely poor sound quality.

Yes, I noticed that some of the sound quality ain't great, but I haven't noticed the washed-out colors some people comment on, and in fact the Wave has been cleaned up substantially compared to some earlier seasons. Yes, the packaging is chintzy, especially compared to earlier seasons, and the Danny pic on the back of the set is awful!!
BUT! I'm in it for the stories, and there are some really good ones in this season. The writers and actors gave us reasons to care about some of these folks in very little time - the reporter in Cop on the Cover, the washed-up astronaut in Shake Hands... the screwed-up cop in Ninth Step, the appealing and complex terrorist in Up the Rebels.  There are some great plot turns and twists as well, and of course Chin Ho's farewell. There are some dog episodes too (Short Walk on the Longshore), but I think the stories in this season were overall better than Season 9.
It's been interesting to compare the original Five-0 to the new series - I still don't care about the principal characters in the rehash (tho' Danny comes closest, espcially when he protests McGarret's completely unrealistic, out-of-control black-ops tactics and behaviour - they're like a married couple in that car). They certainly haven't made me care about any of the guest characters (except maybe the snitch who wanted to see his family again); there've been no ""gotcha"" or ""didn't see THAT coming"" moments or stories, and the enhanced false colors of the scenic shots is really annoying. Maybe Paramount cheaped out again on the release of the original Five-0; but I know which DVDs I will buy and which version of Five-0 I will be watching in x years, on my hopelessly primitive and outdated technology.
