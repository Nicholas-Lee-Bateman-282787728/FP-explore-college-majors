863551,4,6304400179,"This one is so cool! But, as you might know the english dubbed versions are horrendous. There are some great fights with Ken and Ryu, but when ryu does his infamous hadouken fireball he sounds so [bad] in english!!!!!!!Other than the English dubbing this is a grand slam for street fighter fanatics.",994896000,,299,4.769230769230769
863552,4,6304400179,"I bought volume #1 to try that out, and even tho I kinda liked it I just was not sure if it was worth purchasing. So I rented vol #2. The storyline picked up and basically all around the episodes got much better. The intro for Sagat and Dalsim were rather interesting, but really got me was the intro for Vega. Now that was pretty slick.
SF II V is not the best anime. I have seen much better. Even tho the music sounds Casio keyboardish, it does get my blood pumping enuff to train while the intro and ending credits are going off. This is really for the Street Fighter fans, I do not think a non-SF fan could like it but I could be wrong. I am biased so it is hard to see the other view. What can I say, I played a lot of SF as a kid. =D
The characters in this series are different than what you see in the movie because quite frankly this is in a time period before the movie. In fact, in this volume Ryu is searching to find out what Hadou (think fireball from the game) is.
I will not say much more than that so I do not ruin the surprise of you seeing the characters for yourself... ...except one more piece =P ...look for the red head in black, heh nice subtle cameo!",988070400,2,1174,3.9788135593220337
863553,5,6304400179,"Street fighter is always making history,first in the arcade bussines and now in anime. I love the first volume of the serie and I love this one even more because more new events had been add to the story of S.F.IIV making it even better. If you are a Street F. fan you have to buy this,you won't be disaponted.",984268800,2,310,4.183333333333334
863554,4,6304400179,"The middle portion of this series starts it getting interesting. Ryu starts learning the secrets of the Hado, and M. Bison is finally introduced into the picture. The episodes start flowing together much more as this series continues. I've liked Street fighter and watched all the incarnations of it being ported to video and this is my favorite one. My only reason for not giving it 5 stars is that the series tends to recycle the animation, using the same 3 punches over and over to represent the fights, and the fact that they used a lot of build up during the episodes and wasted a lot of time. I believe they were just trying to fill the half hour. But the story is solid and entertaining. Buy it if you like Street Fighter.",983923200,,729,4.447761194029851
863555,4,6304400179,"This sentence is maybe the best for the second part of the v series. The story keeps on going and we want to know more about Ryu and the other Streetfighter Characters. The design is beautiful and in old ANime/STreetfighter manner. Fans of Streetfighter should buy this DVD, but it's a look worth for people who didn't see a streetfighter (but buy first the Animated Movie).",983836800,,374,4.681818181818182
863556,4,6304400179,So far the series go great with english dubbing. But still the original dubbing is far superior. Alot of quotes from the original is changed and that's what hurted this movie on english. Just get the original to be on the safe side.,982368000,,232,4.4186046511627906
863557,5,6304400179,"So far, I've found the first six episodes of this series simply awesome.  I've seen the first three subtitled, and I saw four through six dubbed.  I have to say that the dubbed voices work out quite well, but I'm not a major fan of Chun Li's dubbed voice.  It's not the greatest, but not the worst voice I've ever heard.
Anyway, onto the review.  The battles got a teeny bit repetitive, but the fighting action in this movie is just, great.  The moves that the characters pull off, the attempted ""American"" background music (with an average synthesized sound, might I add), and the storyline is pretty good, too.  But, at this point of the series, it's still building up.  Like I said for the first tape, this series'll make you want to see more.  One episode after another, it's just that good.",970358400,,795,4.510489510489511

then you will like this dvd.",1391385600,,100,4.05
7870215,1,6304400179,"This whole series was really bad, it was boring and slow not a whole lotta action here bubs.",1189123200,,92,4.166666666666667
7870216,4,6304400179,"I'm still quite surprised at how good this series is. Most shows and movies based on video-games are dreadful but SF II V seems to keep coming up with good stories and features great fight scenes. Even for animation the brawling still packs a punch and the cartoonish nature of the show never imposes on the more serious parts. By this point the story arc is becoming more sophisticated and ends up being rather theatrical. It's great the way they incorporate all the famous SF characters and still manage to give them quality writing.

The DVD has a glitch though. From about the 3rd episode on the English dialogue is roughly 1-second off sync with the mouth movements. I got used to it but it still bugged me to begin with.",1123891200,,726,4.541984732824427
7870217,4,6304400179,This series was great. I already have the entire video collection and it is great. If you don't have the entire series you better get it.,1026691200,,137,4.3076923076923075
7870218,5,6304400179,"Some of the problems that I've been having with the first disc are here on this one, however, most of them are fixed, and the disc is not as glitchy as the other one.  Also, the series itself really starts to pick up well, with some important factors...
The storyline also takes a few new interesting twists, but I won't state them here.  The character development continues to shine, which is one of this series' shining points.  Each of the characters has a separate personality, and it is shown in this disc.
I also noticed a big change in the music.  The first volume had all synthesized music running in the background, but the second volume had some new music: all orchestrated.  This is a very pleasant change, because now the dramatic scenes are more dramatic, and the battle scenes are more intense without thinking, ""Geez, that music sounds so phony...""
However, I still would have liked the original opening theme, ""Kaze Fuiteru"" instead of the new opening that Manga placed.  They even replaced the original Japanese version with this opening.  This doesn't really make the series complete if the original opening isn't there...
But anyhow, I think this is a great disc.  The plot moves very quickly, and if you're an anime fan who enjoys action-packed battle scenes, great music, and a generally exciting series, then this show is definately for you.",1012089600,,1363,4.819742489270387
