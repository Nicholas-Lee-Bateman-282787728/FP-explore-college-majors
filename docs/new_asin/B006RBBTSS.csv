Ended a bit abruptly and a little too neatly I thought, making the two and half hours seem to fly by and so I wanted more, but the journey was wonderful. Great acting with a little bit of everything.  I believe this is the only film between Madhubala and Bharat Bushan who had interesting chemistry here.  Definitely worth watching more than once.",1510531200,,418,4.698630136986301

8503542,4,B006RBBTSS,"Thoroughly enjoyed the DVD, there are some superb qawaalis in it and the old theme of ""beautiful girl hears a great voice and falls in love"" which happened at one time many years ago but,perhaps, no longer does now. The past had its own charm.",1354060800,,243,4.4222222222222225
