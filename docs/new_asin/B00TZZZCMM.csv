7026819,3,B00TZZZCMM,"Mildly interesting B movie. This can be fun if you find yourself entertained by a vintage character study with more than a little mild, horror erotica.",1476230400,,151,4.846153846153846
7026820,5,B00TZZZCMM,"Whew! I'm so glad I watched this movie before I read the negative reviews! I'm a kind of connoisseur of vampire films having seen them all, yes ALL. If you're looking for a true hard core vampire film that delivers, few ever reach this film's high mark. What this movie excels at are the vampire bite scenes. They are among the most realistic you'll ever find anywhere. They are a little graphic and a little violent, but in reality that would be how I think a vampire bite scene would look. This film excels at the realism. You will see a bit of gore here, it's realistic, not phony, not overdone, it's done just right. Another thing I liked was the number of bite scenes, over four! Some vampire films may show a couple, many show none or tease the heck out of the viewer until the end then either deliver or don't. This film delivers throughout the movie! And the film is not done in poor light, it's done in good full color light so you can see every bloody detail (and I'm not a fan of gore).

The vampire in this story is depicted as a kind of monster. That's okay, some vampire films depict vampires this way. Believe it or not, many worse vampire films have received much higher ratings than some ratings I've seen here, go figure. I guess it's all in how the viewer sees the movie. I've watched most of the vampire films out there for both entertainment and research for my own vampire story writing. In my humble opinion based on watching hundreds of vampire themed films, this vampire movie sets the bar for realism! What it's not, it's not an erotic vampire story or love story. It takes a bit of skill to be able to make an interesting vampire movie, show it realistically without going overboard on the gore, and show so many realistic bite scenes. The actors who played their parts were all outstanding in making the film appear so realistic as were the special effects gurus. Great writing, direction and production all around. I hope and encourage the industry create more such movies. I don't give many films 5 star reviews. This vampire themed film is one of the best I've ever seen and it clearly deserves it!",1475884800,18,2129,4.473007712082262

I write better than this.

As people disappear and die from vampire bites the media laments it needs better laws to prosecute vampires, which seem to have become a metaphor for corporations.

PLOT SPOILER: Like QUARANTINE, the DVD cover opts to show you the last scene in a movie that failed to entertain. Yves Carlevaris was horrible as a vampire. This had a bad hand held camera plot with tons of boredom without the hand held camera. And these vampires can go out in the daylight.

Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity. Heck, there wasn't any real good cleavage scenes either. What kind of vampire film is that?",1442620800,,744,4.628787878787879

7026836,3,B00TZZZCMM,"Deserves a 3.5/5, so I'm giving it a 7/10 on IMDb.  I suspect ""Reborn"" refers to a retelling, different from others, modern European, and utterly somber in tone.  It's more mystery than horror, though you should be prepared for some mighty ugly and rather sickening blood-letting.  I love great effects, and these vamps almost turned my stomach.  The ""prince"", conveniently named Corvinus, has been styled after the kind of vamp from ""Nosferatu"" and ""Shadow of the Vampire""; he's neither likeable nor pretty, but sometimes is comical in his physical demeanor.  My big hint is to watch for a modern day-protector whose job is luring in the food.",1508544000,,644,4.981308411214953

7026841,2,B00TZZZCMM,"This at best might be called an art film. The dialogue is trivial. The ""research"" is below elementary school level, meaning a twelve year old with an encyclopedia or Google/Wikipedia could do much better. In the end, the ""three friends"" get what they deserve. Most of the film is much like the first few minutes. I think this film would only make sense to a vampire want-to-be who just wants to see people pounced upon -- reference a very early statement by the protagonist talking about how she likes to ""watch vampires, because it makes her feel good.""
The female protagonist is good to look at but pretty soon she just comes across as a poseur. The friends are idiots, the vampires are insane gigglers, and the ending is appropriate.",1499990400,,736,4.6692307692307695

While most pan this movie I can't. However it is not something I liked.
I did like the lead Vampire, very reminisicent of the original Nosferatu.
But that is why most americans will not like this movie, we are used to romanticizing dracula & europeans look at the art of nosferatu.
While both stories are based on the same story the whole religion part of the story is ignored in the USA.
The symbolism from the art & clothing all blend to tell part of this tale.

I'm not very harsh on movies but this one left me wondering how a writer could be so bad as to have nothing actually happen except a series of badly done vampire attacks.

7026878,5,B00TZZZCMM,"I really like vampire stories.  I am open to different ways of telling them and I don't get hung up on the details.  For it to be a good one, it needs to tell a story and do it fairly well.  This one does.  I admit, it is slow paced at first.  I think I saw the first 20 min before and got bored.  Tonight I was patient and wanted to see a good story.  I like that it was a European film with European actors.  Not everything needs that Hollywood look to it.
The pace does pic up and keeps accelerating to the very end.
I do think you will have to be a vampire movie fan to like it as much as I did. Being HAF might help, too.
The evidence I have to show that it was good is before seeing this, I would have easily gone to Transylvania to check out the myths.  This movie put some hesitation back in me just like Jaws did with swimming in the ocean.  I know it's just a story, but it was a good telling of it, IMO.
It does leave question, but I think was part of the design of this movie.  It's designed to make you identify with the characters seeking information about vampires.  I think this film succeeded in that.  I probably wouldn't put it in the top 10 list, but maybe in the top 20 vampire movie list.",1482969600,3,1210,3.9300411522633745

But film at night they did and quite spectacularly to boot.

I'm not as authoritative in vampire movies as Night Writer (whose review prompted me to watch this) but I've seen a coupla three vamp movies. Speaking of blood suckers, I thought nothing could trump (lol) Herzog's 1972 Nosferatu the Vampyre but Dracula Reborn's king vamp not only resembles the old bag but I actually got the feeling that I was watching Nosferatu: Still Dead and Alive. ""A rose by any other name...""

It's got some great lines, twists and turns that don't explain everything like I'm a mindless holly wood robot. I was reminded of classics like The Night of the Living Dead and The Hills Have Eyes only with vamps and not zombies or mutants. A very ""nowhere to run; nowhere to hide"" vibe pervades (hey CIA, I hope you watch this just cuz). I switched from laughing to totally repulsed to scared sh*teless (especially towards the end).

7026909,1,B00TZZZCMM,"Ridiculous premise.  Difficult to understand what's going on with thick accents and constant whispering and mumbling.  Silly ""Dracula"" character good only for laughs.  The only interesting feature is the attacks made by the guy in the black and purple cape when he comes out of nowhere, leaps on the victims and practically throttles them when draining them of blood.  Other that that, the scariest thing about this movie is the skeletal, badly dressed and freakily coiffed heroine.  Who gets carried off at the end by the guy in the cape.  One of those movies where everyone dies at the end.  But you don't really care.",1477699200,4,620,4.847619047619047
