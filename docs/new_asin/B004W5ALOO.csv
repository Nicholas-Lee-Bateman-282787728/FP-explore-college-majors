4485253,5,B004W5ALOO,"I got two of these dvds from the local library when I had a sub and lo and behold, the students LOVED them. So, I bought two more myself. They seemed a tad childish (I teach 6-8), but kids actually drew pictures for me of el perro y el gato. Naturally, they are asking to see them again and so I shall just before Christmas when everything is up for grabs, but I can corral them. Two thumbs up!",1322611200,,394,4.0
4485254,4,B004W5ALOO,"As a Spanish teacher, I hoped to use this series in class.  Would be nice to have a synopsis included so I know what is covered.  They are still good anyway.",1318032000,,157,4.032258064516129
4485255,5,B004W5ALOO,I have watched these on HBO On-Demand for years and I am so excited to finally have them on DVD! My kids just love watching them.,1316649600,,129,4.0
8444436,5,B004W5ALOO,"My son loves this show. I own this episode and two others: de aqui para alla (from here to there) and juntos otra vez (Together again). I purchased this copy to replace one he accidentally broke. These DVDs are a little pricey to me but the amount they have been watched have made the price well worth it. This episode has more music than the other two. Its great to use a teaching tool to encourage toddlers to be bilingual. If you are unfamiliar with this show, half is in English and half Spanish. They say a statement in one language and then the other character says what? And they repeat that same phrase in the other language.  My son repeats the words from both languages during the course of the show. Would definitely recommend to anyone wanting encourage their child to be bilingual or simply expose them to another language.",1510531200,,836,4.5364238410596025
8444437,5,B004W5ALOO,My daughter loves these cartoons!  Great to learn Spanish and English.,1444867200,,70,5.363636363636363
8444438,5,B004W5ALOO,"This is an awesome way for kids and adults to learn Spanish. I got this one at a bargain price, as the other DVDs in this series can be pricey.  The short episodes keep everyone's attention with great animation and voicing.  I also love that it repeats everything in Spanish and English, and they also put key words up in both languages and review them at the end.",1432684800,,364,4.338235294117647
8444439,5,B004W5ALOO,"Excellent for kids, good way to learn dome spanish words",1430611200,,56,4.7
8444440,5,B004W5ALOO,"My daughter loves this series and is learning at the same time! I do have admit, I get a little annoyed sometimes because she watches it over and over again but it's like that with all her favorites.",1399161600,,199,4.2631578947368425
8444441,5,B004W5ALOO,"My toddler has learned a handful of Spanish words from this show, and so have I!
It's not too irritating, its bright and contrasting colors really keep their attention, and it teaches good lessons.
Two thumbs up!",1395187200,,212,4.756756756756757
8444442,5,B004W5ALOO,"I really like how everything is repeated in the other language. I think it makes it easier to understand. I have two kids ages 4 and 2 and they both enjoy these videos. The only thing I don't like is that sometimes when they say something in spanish, they use an accent. I wish they wouldn't do that, because I want my kids to learn the correct pronunciation. It's not enough for me to lower my rating though. It only happens a few times but I just wanted people to know in case its a big deal to them. I own several episodes of El Perro y El Gato, but I'm only posting my review once.",1393286400,,585,4.051724137931035

8444445,5,B004W5ALOO,My daughter and hubby have expanded their vocabulary quite a bit by viewing these cd's. They toggle between English and Spanish with each phrase. They also do a summary at the end just in case you missed something. Nicely done.,1337385600,,227,4.7
