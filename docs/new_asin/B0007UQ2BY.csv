2244476,5,B0007UQ2BY,"It's unlikey that any film released in 2005 will rival ""Punishment Park"" for its combination of political urgency, blazing moral ardor and formal quile.  Peter Watkins is the most marginalized film director of the 20th century. The release of this film is a watershed moment in the history of his career. For the first time America will have the opportunity to see this visionary, earth scorching missive and one of his very best films.  If ""Fahrenheit 9/11"" was released in 1971 it would have been called ""Punishment Park""",1130371200,17,523,4.931818181818182

2244482,1,B0007UQ2BY,This film is  a pretty low brow tome involving some sort of vast right wing conspiracy persecuting hapless protesters.

2244486,4,B0007UQ2BY,"This was an interesting movie. Since Amazon insists on putting the year the film is released as streaming as ""The Year"" -- instead of when it was actually made -- I watched the entire film thinking it was made in 2011. Thus the 1970s vibe -- costuming, film quality, etc. -- seemed oh golly! so real.

OK, stop chortling. I bet it would draw you in, as well.

Learning it wasn't four years old, but 44 years old, changed that aspect of it for me, but not the curiosity-piquing that the entire production produced. This is a quirky film -- even it IS from 1971, it STILL functions as a pseudo-documentary, which I bet many people think was invented by The Blair Witch Project.

And for that matter, it has something to say to all times, including ours.

2244504,5,B0007UQ2BY,"Made in 1970 by the exceptional British film maker Peter Watkins, this is a film with a punch that has lost none of its impact after more than forty years. It was set at a time when the Vietnam War was slowly going very badly wrong, America had seen the drafting of its young men, the Kent State shootings and political polarisation that moved a generation to take up politics as a force for real change.

Watkins used all of these elements and more as a vehicle for this work. He used the McCarran Internal Security Act of 1950 which allowed for emergency powers to be used by a President in a time of war without recourse to Congress. This meant that undesirables could be held in detention with scant regard to the rule of law if they posed `a risk to internal security'. In the film we see young people being shackled and taken to a tribunal - of sorts. What is to all intents and purposes a kangaroo court then passes indeterminate sentences like 10 to 15 years, on all of them for acts against America etc. They are then given the choice to serve the term in a Federal Prison or do 3 days at Punishment Park.

They all go for the Park. Here they have to travel through the desert to an American flag being `pursued' by National Guards and Police - if caught they go to prison if they make the flag they are `free'.

Well the film uses docudrama techniques and the film crew interview both hunter and hunted and depicts how attitudes change and harden over the course of the hunt. We also have the ongoing court case of the next batch and that is equally as powerful. This was all done using amateurs and a lot of improvisation as people felt so aligned to what they were doing that they felt well able to take the arguments on by themselves.

This is one of the most powerful pieces of film making I have seen for a while. I watched it late in the evening and was transfixed by its potency and visceral realism coupled with the still blatant relevance of power gone mad and law enforcement unchecked. Absolutely recommended and it will make you think and you will most certainly have a reaction, it was banned in America on release and some accused it of being Communist - well what ever your view is, this is guaranteed to have a very real impact and cinema is all the richer for having such people as Peter Watkins making films.",1398384000,8,2336,4.35091743119266
2244505,5,B0007UQ2BY,"Like Medium Cool, this is a film from the anti-establishment era that used a combination of actors and non-actors participating in roughly scripted scenes and filmed in a mostly documentary fashion allowing a lot of convincing improvisation. Most of Punishment Park looks absolutely real and has an impact that no dramatized film could ever have. Forty years after it was made you could use it to fool some people into thinking it actually happened.

But does a grainy dirty 16mm film from the early 70's look any better in high definition? Fortunately this particular release has both the Blu-ray and DVD discs. To my eyes the Blu-ray with its relentless grain (even the dark police uniforms in many of the bright desert scenes grain out!) looks more like a projected film than the DVD, and that makes it look even more like true documentary of the era. This is especially effective in many scenes where the cameraman (actually a woman) is struggling to keep an actor (or non-actor) in focus yet the grain keeps hitting your eyes and keeping your attention. In the tribunal scenes the ugly grain somehow makes the tent seem even more claustrophobic. A few scenes do look slightly sharper with a little more detail but I can't say there are many of them.

Beware that there are some Blu-ray releases of Punishment Park that are B region (Europe) only. The disc I bought released by Eureka! ([...]) plays in all three regions. It claims the audio is a DTS-HD audio track but it's actually stereo PCM which of course is no different.",1398297600,2,1531,4.7518796992481205

2244508,5,B0007UQ2BY,"30 years after it was made and derided, marginalized, and tossed on the ashheap of sixties political culture, paved over by the rumbling crush of today's corpo-socialist fascism, THIS FILM RE-EMERGES to a new audience who will understand it very well! If you have seen it, you know what I mean. If not, you aren't paying attention. WATKINS himself gives us a terse introduction to the film and explains it's history and his frustration, and then WHAM!! ...it comes at you, blows right in your eye like dirty desert dirt, bakes your brain with its heat, and makes you THIRST for your rights and freedoms now GONE.......FOREVER??????",1328659200,2,631,4.906542056074766
2244509,5,B0007UQ2BY,"sometimes people just need to die in order for the world to be a better place, not because one side is better than the other at articulating its principles and convictions, but because there is no other possible denouement to the fiery conflict once words become woefully insufficient. these are the moments when the tree of liberty stands thirsty for its nourishment and only darker days lie ahead. peter watkins' powerful film ""punishment park"" perfectly captures this pessimistic sentiment.

this pseudo-documentary is set in a dystopian america in the early seventies as the vietnam war raged under president nixon's administration. the battle against communism on the global stage is joined by a homegrown civil unrest, leading the administration to suspend constitutional rights in hopes of quelling the dissent. leftwing critics of the government and of the war are rounded up and tried in special tribunals. after the inevitable judgments of guilt, the dissidents are given the choice between multi-year prison sentences or spending three days in the eponymous punishment parks. perhaps unsurprisingly, all of the condemned choose punishment park.

the story takes place in the southern california punishment park. (the scope of the nation's problems are hinted at by the existence of other punishment parks as far east as chicago.) the dissidents need to cross fifty or so miles of harsh desert terrain in order to reach an american flag planted far away. if they make it in this symbolic struggle, they are set free. the practical aspect of this exercise is to train national guardsmen, army reservists and law enforcement officers to confront the rebellion at home. the dissidents are given a two-hour head start before being pursued by the arm of the authority. if caught, they must serve their jail sentences. the movie follows two groups, one undergoing tribunal and the other fighting for their freedom in the desert.

the tribunal scenes are amazing. the actors improvised most of the dialogue and some of the back-and-forth moments of passionate rhetoric as well as calm eloquence are just stunning. point, counterpoint, slogans, hyperboles and sarcastic quips are exchanged in this clash of ideologies. neither side comes out victorious nor leaves unscathed. there are plenty of illogical arguments and untenable positions taken by both sides. viewers are likely to bring their own political stance into this film when scoring debating points, but this film works largely because it is able to avoid skewing too far in either direction. all we have are opposing principles unresolvable in the realm of ideas and ultimately brought out to bear in an arena of pure naked force.

it seems almost unnecessary to comment on the desert scenes. any cursory glance at human history offers plenty of hints at what happens after the tribunals are over. additionally, director peter watkins masterfully intersperses the events in the desert with those at tribunal. this gives the viewer a sense of continuity as the film wraps around itself in the end, enhancing the pessimistic overtones.

this movie grabs you from the start and pulls you into its horrible world with never a boring moment. it should appeal most to those who are capable and willing to see both sides, those who have read smith's ""wealth of nations"" and marx's ""capital,"" those who feel respect toward william f. buckley, jr. as well as noam chomsky, in short, those who can live in two worlds. i am conservative by nature, but wildly attracted to radical ideas, and i was so engrossed in this movie that i had to watch it a second time afterward. you should definitely check out ""punishment park"" if you've ever felt passion for this country.",1315267200,,3719,5.100164203612479
2244510,3,B0007UQ2BY,"At times it seems as though Watkins is interested in promoting discussion between those who are complicit with the US system/way of life & those who want to overthrow that system/way of life, and at times he seems perfectly content to let them fight it out Mad Max style (a scenario that doesn't seem to serve any useful purpose at all except to entertain those easily bored by political conversations).

To its credit the film does not show the hippies/radicals as innocents and the representatives of the status quo as evil. Watkins gives us enough testimonial evidence to see that in many ways each side has something to learn from the other. The students have a lot more education but they tend to use that education destructively as a weapon to criticize & tear down existing forms, instead of using that education in a constructive way to offer viable alternatives/modifications to an existing system. The students seem to have big ideas but no idea how to put them into practice. Some of the adults respect the idealism but see the students themselves as they see their own children--as young people who have benefited from the hard work of parents like themselves but who are now turning on the system that has given them so much.

In reality both sides want a fair & just system but neither side wants to admit any of its own failings. The spokesmen & women for the status quo do not respect the hippies/radicals because they don't work and yet expect the system they criticize to take care of them, while the hippies/radicals don't respect the working men & women because they are uncritical of the system they serve & defend. The hippies/radicals could use a little more life experience/moderation in their views; and the adults could be a little more critical of oppressive policies (racism, sexism, imperialism).

The film does inspire some thought but the overall impression is that there is no way to talk it out and that the only solution is to fight it out in a way that assures the elimination of all opposition. This seems like a gross miscalculation on Watkins part because excessively paranoid visions do not encourage resistance but make all resistance seem futile.

One of the best songs of the time, Buffalo Springfield's ""For What its Worth,"" cautions both sides to stop shouting & listen to each other. A more interesting film would have heeded that songs message & shown some people from each side talking to each other & revising their opinions of each other. But Watkins, like most media, is only drawn to the extremes. He seems to want to criticize the fact that only violence makes the front page, but he also seems to be exploiting that fact with this sensationalistic scenario.

In his director's introduction (recorded in 2004), Watkins tries very hard to sell himself as an art director & this film as a subversive document that remains relevant. He may have art film pretensions but he has a pulp fiction/exploitation/tabloid sensibility without any of the redeeming features (like a subversive humor, a quality distinctly lacking in Watkins work & person) that make those schlocky sub-genres so appealing.",1309478400,5,3142,4.865420560747664

Peter Watkins makes Goddard look like a sellout.  This man is a true believer and has paid for it.  He's the kind of person so honest it hurts.  We need more of this kind of pain.

You wouldn't want to hang out with him but you respect his efforts.  He's from the Left but so what.

The players in the movie are real people the situation is fictional mockumentary is not the right word -- call it documenary fiction like Battle Of Algiers; but 40 years later it's like a LoFi Logan's Run, or The Running Man.  Arnold Strong was in that wasn't he?  Now California has the Governator and we have a black President -- all of it less plausible and less well acted than this movie.

2244513,4,B0007UQ2BY,"I saw Peter Watkin's CULLODEN and THE WAR GAME a few months before this and was very impressed. The technique is essentially the same, or at least very similar, in this film detailing on the one hand a trial of dissidents in California in the (apparently) near future, and on the other the attempts of a group of already-convicted ""criminals"" to slog through 50 miles of desert to win their freedom in a government-run ""punishment park"" as an alternative to prison. Watkins films everything in a documentary style, which causes for more than a little awkwardness or required strong suspension of disbelief: how is it that the camera crew is with the group of starving and parched prisoners over 2 days without either offering help or sharing in their misery? And that's merely the most obvious example. But questionable storytelling aside, this packs a punch; no doubt you have to be interested in political film-making to really get involved, but the film really isn't like anything else of it's era (or any, really): it pulls no punches, offers no simple solutions. The leftist political figures are certainly painted broadly at times, but they aren't all alike; the right-wing government functionaries seem a little more cartoonish, but even they are allowed to show at least a little humanity. Overall, the film gives much to think about and leaves an indelible taste.

On the same DVD is THE FORGOTTEN FACES, a 1960 or 1961 (listed dates vary) 18-minute very low-budget short, shot silent with narration and sound effects added in later, detailing a small group of freedom fighters engaged in the 1956 Hungarian revolution. This is much more powerful, kinetic and forceful film-making, and though the politics are for the most part more obvious and blunt, there are several moments, like a beautiful passage at the end that together show how  ""the right side of history"" is dependent on what side the viewer - or filmmaker - is on at the time.  Despite the overwhelming, nearly all-encompassing human need to boil everything down to black and white, the truth that there really is no truth has not been forgotten by this leftist filmmaker; this is Watkins at his most basic, angry and primitive and for me, at his best.",1255305600,,2224,4.893899204244032
2244514,1,B0007UQ2BY,"Punishment Park (Peter Watkins, 1971)

Much of the message board debate on IMDB centers on the movie's vast left-wing slant (making the right wing out to be 100% evil and the left wing to be saints, in the words of one poster). Much of the rest of it has to do with comparing the film to Kinji Fukasaku's 2000 film Battle Royale. I have to disagree with both counts; the movie reminds me far more of Stephen King's novel The Long Walk (written as Richard Bachman), and had the filmmakers wanted to make the left wing out to be anything but a bunch of whiny, pathetic idiots, he would have had them saying more thoughtful things and spouting fewer platitudes. I don't see a bias because I don't see a single person in this movie who is in any way likable, and I have to wonder about people who think the activists are the ""good guys"" in this movie.

Plot: filmed as a pseudo-documentary, Punishment Park intercuts scenes of military tribunals against left-wing activists who will be sent to Punishment Park, a desert military facility, with scenes of the last group of left-wing activists who chose to go there as an alternative to kangaroo-court-style prison sentences (seven years in a Federal penitentiary for, for example, writing seditious music). At Punishment Park, the detainees are told that they have to survive in the desert for four days, walking sixty-odd miles over a pre-arranged course while being monitored, and in some cases pursued, by military and the police. Leaving the course will cause them to be re-arrested. Unless, of course, they resist, in which case the cops will use eye-for-an-eye justice in order to bring them in.

The big problem here, as I mentioned, is the lack of likable characters. Sure, you expect the right-wingers in a movie like this to be two-dimensional caricatures (you can't allow for it, but you have to expect it), but the left-wingers as well? How deeply stupid do you have to think your audience is to simply regurgitate the same extremist garbage heard from nutcases all through the late sixties through the mouths of two-dimensional characters who have no humanity whatsoever? At least Abbie Hoffman had a personality.

I only give zeros to films that I either didn't finish watching or that I finished watching, but were explicitly offensive, as I define the term. This is the best example of an offensive film I've seen in the recent past. It would have had to have been orders of magnitude more intelligent in order for me to call it brain-dead. It is willfully, aggressively stupid, and it assumes its audience will be even stupider than it is. Kill it. Kill it with fire. (zero)",1251331200,6,2636,4.761487964989059
2244515,3,B0007UQ2BY,"This ""underground"" pseudo-documentary unfortunately has not lost any relevance since its inception 36 years ago until today. At its core is an at the time of the movie's making fictitious law but sounding eerily familiar today in view of the Patriot Act, which involves the right to detain and arrest anybody by the police of whom can be assumed they will commit some terrorist act in the future.

A number of accused, hippies, draft dodgers (Vietnam war was still going on in 1971), left wing activists etc. stand before a tribunal made up of right wing politicians, good loyal citizens, knights of law and order all, that represent the particular American flavor of the establishment.
Naturally none of the accused stand a chance on acquittal and they know it, so with nothing to lose they feel free to verbally attack the tribunal.

The documentary makers in the movie clearly choose their side and it's interesting to see that emotions on both sides rise to such a level that at times one can clearly see that they are real and no acting is going on anymore.

After the, surprise surprise, guilty verdict the convicted are presented with a choice: face a long incarceration or three days in Punishment Park and what do you know, they all choose Punishment Park, a training ground for police and national guard that they have to cross to reach an American flag at its end, the government it seems is not without a sense of humor.

On their three day track (with one stop supposedly where they can get water) they are ""accompanied"" by members of said police and national guard, which basically amounts to hunting them like animals, trying to provoke the convicts to use violence which would give them license to exercise force, i.e. shoot them down like dogs.

The movie switches back and forth between this desperate journey and the individual tribunals that preceded it. Obviously it shows a world that in its detail is dated in showing the end of the hippy era and subsequent political radicalization especially among students but the parallels with present day are obvious. The camp that houses the prisoners reminds of Guantanamo Bay and the issue of the relationship between violence of the state versus that of the individual, which in the end obviously makes all involved a loser, is illustrated in this movie in a quite effective manner. By using non-professional actors for the most part it all comes across very realistically and especially the tribunal scenes are fascinating and at times make you forget you're watching a fake documentary. Anyway it was real enough for the Danes who filed an official complaint and had to be informed that it concerned a work of fiction.

For years this movie was hard to get if not impossible, but luckily this has now changed and we can see in its full raw power and I believe it to be an important movie that everybody should see, not necessarily to agree with its point of view but it should at least make one think.",1229472000,2,2969,4.755339805825242
2244516,4,B0007UQ2BY,"Possibly the most extreme example of 1970s-style ""us vs. them""/political radicals vs. the Establishment movie, Punishment Park, directed by notorious social commentator Peter Watkins, uses violence--both verbal and physical--to smash its message home. This is an intense dystopian vision of both the present and the future simultaneously--and whether that future is near or far is hard to say.

Hippie-radical types, all in their late teens/early 20s, are tried and found guilty of conspiracy/treason, blah, blah, by the straight, much older Establishment guys--judges, the moral majority, et cetera. Their sentence is either hard time or three days in a ferocious desert environment cordoned off especially for this purpose called Punishment Park--which is, needless to say, frequented by all kinds of stupid, trigger-happy representatives of said Establishment--cops, National Guard, etc. Of course the hippie-radical types choose the desert. And of course this results in tragic circumstances.

What's interesting here is that Watkins does not really portray the protesters as all shining and pure and good. They're self-absorbed, completely uninterested in how the world really works outside of their view of it, and often very petty among themselves.

But in a sense, that's the whole point here. The real theme of the film is intolerance and while in the 1970s that was in many ways more blatant than it is today, the message still rings true. Intolerance is as American as apple pie and the flag, as American as the shining image of a mother cradling her baby or the bald eagle flying over snow-capped mountains. Intolerance is, in fact, how we live our lives in many ways, even today. So says this film. So it is true.

While admittedly over the top in its execution, Punishment Park is nevertheless difficult to forget. The sight of the radical youths struggling to survive in the desert is one that resonates deeply. This is a unique film by a unique filmmaker.",1193875200,2,1971,5.227848101265823
2244517,4,B0007UQ2BY,"In 1971, Director Peter Watkins became one of the unfortunate few to make a prophecy which came true--in this case, in the form of a film.  I know not how it was received at the time or how it was reviewed.  I suspect not well, since the film virtually disappeared from sight for a number of years.  Rumor-mongers even claimed that the government had banned it--whether true or not I have no idea.  More likely, the graphic violence and language, which are common enough now but still far from easy to watch, were a bit much for audiences of 36 years ago.

Purporting to be a documentary shot by a British film crew about a controversial Presidential order intended to suppress dissent, ""Punishment Park"" offers 85 minutes of grainy 16mm footage, usually from a handheld camera, with performances that were to my understanding improvised at least in part.  The result is ""The Blair Witch Project"" set in an all-too-real world, with both actors (some of them thinly-disguised versions of both 1960s radicals and ""establishment"" figures) and fictional film crew falling into their roles beautifully.  We watch as a rigged government ""tribunal"" summarily hands down verdicts against assorted alleged ""conspirators"", including a poet, a singer, and an assortment of faces anyone over 40 will easily recognize from old news footage of anti-Vietnam protests.  Each is given the choice of a lengthy prison sentence or what seems an ""easy out""--a three day trek through ""Punishment Park"" in what basically amounts to a large-scale version of ""capture the flag"".  The storyline alternates between a group of people being sentenced, and their predecessors, who are making their way through the ""park"".

It's disturbingly easy to forget the period in which this movie was set--a picture of Richard Nixon shown a couple of times makes it clear that Watkins was not attempting to portray a future society.  However, as the story progresses, and one begins to listen to the platitudes offered by the judges as well as the rhetoric hurled by the judged and ""jury"" (a group of police officers and National Guard personnel), they begin to sound all-too-familiar.  What may have seemed over the top in 1971 can be seen on Fox News every day in 2007. Life has imitated art, to a terrifying degree.

A few dated comments (references to Kent State, for example) and a predictable ending (though I've no idea how it could have been otherwise) do not in any way diminish this powerful film.  We may not have ""Punishment Parks"" just yet, but ""boot camps"" for some convicted criminals have been around for a good long time now, and military tribunals are underway as you read this (of course, we can reassure ourselves, they're only for terrorists).  With detention centers under construction at this writing ""for the event of a national emergency"", it is difficult not to wonder just how far away the full realization of ""Punishment Park's"" dire warning might be.

While clearly intended as a no-holds-barred slam against authoritarianism, ""Punishment Park"" almost manages to strike a balance between utterly callous ""authority"" and book-smart, world-stupid ""dissenters"".  Both sides receive their share of ridicule.  So, for that matter, does everyone's favorite enemy, ""the media"" (I note that a Michael Moore was credited as a sound man--THE Michael Moore?). No matter who you side with in the end, you will rage by the end of this movie.  And you will think a bit about the present-day world, a world in which it increasingly seems all-too-possible that the concepts of truth, justice, and the American Way just might be on the verge of obsolescence.

See this film.  And keep an eye on it.  Should it disappear from shelves, you'll know that the final piece of Watkins' prophecy has indeed come to pass.",1186358400,4,3784,4.973015873015873
2244518,5,B0007UQ2BY,"Punishment Park (1971) by Peter Watkins is one of the hardest hitting political movies you can see which is to be expected given its low-budget antiestablishment bases which was condemned by the media who did not want any form of ""anti-American"" propaganda.  Punishment Park is the story of two film crews who follow the army and the police in a desert zone, 60 miles long, called Punishment Park. The film is told in non-linear format between a court hearing type political debate were after the defendants are charged set loose and then chased down in the park trying to run to their freedom before being captured, i.e. filled full of hot lead.

The film is set during the actual Vietnam War but in alternative history with a SF feel. Nixon who has bombed the Far East has seen fit to bring in executive powers and privileges. Any form of antiwar movement or objection to the draft is met with a choice between either a long jail term or punishment park.

While low-budget constraints manifest themselves (only 8 people worked on the film) in terms of some production values the documentary feel is there and at times you do question if what you are seeing is real or not. The idea itself is very much a type of ""Stanford Prison Experiment"" and the cast are all unknowns. In fact most of these people are actually playing themselves and were in real-life dissenters. Some of the cops had worked as cops. There was no script. The result, however constrained by budget, is what makes it is so unbelievably hard hitting. Of course Hollywood refused to have anything to do with it so naturally we want everything to do with it.

Instant cult classic.",1174867200,2,1648,4.652920962199313
2244519,4,B0007UQ2BY,"I first saw Peter Watkins's Punishment Park the year of its release and I have never forgotten my visceral almost painful reaction to it. At that time the film was a politically charged document with just enough narrative to carry the weight of its polemics through to its disconcerting conclusion. It was 1971, Nixon was in the White House and the Vietnam War dragged on, leaving many of us to feel that the politics of the day had doomed the social revolution of the late 60s. Despite some uncanny contemporary resonances, watching the film now, severed from its original moment in time but with the indelible emotional memory of my first experience of it, Punishment Park feels both distant and nostalgic. Nevertheless, it remains a potent achievement that represents anti-establishment filmmaking as a passion for justice and a commitment to socio-political change rather than entertainment or technological wizardry. This DVD is a perfect transfer of the original film, which was effectively shot on 16mm. The film concentrates its uncompromising message in its documentary style, so thankfully you won't come away distracted by praising the direction or performances, some of which do seem affected relative to today's standards of realism. Punishment Park stands for what it believes and its indictment remains relevant.",1155859200,5,1327,5.293838862559242
2244520,5,B0007UQ2BY,"Regretably, reality is worst than this.  Simply watch ""The Road To Guantanamo"" (Michael Winterbottom, in a similar style) for an example.  Peter Watkins does what CNN, Sky and BBC cannot: express the contemporary experience with the use of a fiction (instead, those channels fail to show reality with the use of clips from the real).
Watkins' introduction to the film is excellent and work as one (so watch it before the film).  Is also nice to finally put a face to Watkins' name.",1155168000,5,481,4.771084337349397

2244522,3,B0007UQ2BY,"This is a very hard review to write, because this is a very hard movie to watch.  There's so many different ways to take it, and unfortunately it forces you to take it a particular way even if you don't want to.

Punishment Park is about extremes, rightists versus leftists and the destruction inherent.  Two camps of protestors are put together, the violent and the nonviolent, and both are punished together by being forced to trek 50+ miles through Death Valley in the middle of summer without water... if they fail, they die.  If they succeed... well...

The thing is that this movie is hateful.  It's utterly predictable, but not in that way where it's condescending or stupidly written, but in that terrible way where you know what's going to happen and don't want to see it, but do.  It's entirely a ""necessary"" product, one that HAD to have been made during the era it was, and unfortunately one that HAS to exist, even if it's simply a terrible experience.

What angers me so much about it is that it proves itself.  The way it's a pseudodocumentary and it's vastly leftist politics makes it almost insulting, makes you want to just ignore it as the ranting of a zealot.  If the people are in the desert, for instance, with a camera crew nearby, why aren't they asking the camera crew for water?  And once they start to get desperate, how come they never attack the camera crew?  Major difficulty in a movie where the director speaks.

Yet the movie ""exists"" as it ""actually happened"" becuase of people's treatment of it.  It was banned in England, pretty much not allowed release in America, and got very little release in very little places.  The credits roll, and the director/narrator points out that at least one of his crew was subsequently imprisoned.  The treatment of this movie by those in power profoundly reinforces its themes, which is terrible because its themes shouldn't exist.

And then I'd love to say that this film should now be forgotten considering the by-gone era, but noooooo!! Current political landscapes and people's readiness to turn Iraq into another Vietnam either by making poor decisions or repeating said fact with slogans on picket signs makes this movie come back to the forefront again, a painful Big Brother, a terrible paean to the fear and hatred that consumed many during that era which people seem eager to reclaim in this era.  Basically, it angers me to no end that this had to exist, it angers me more that it's still palpible, but not because of the movie itself but what it represents.

2244523,5,B0007UQ2BY,"It took me a few minutes into the film to realize it was shot in the early seventies and, in fact, was about the era of Nixon rather than the era of Bush. The similarities are creepy to say the least.

The film is about the state of national emergency proclaimed by the president of the United States, which gives permission to detain those who may be a threat to national security, who are then detained, often preemptively, judged by the tribunal that disregards constitutional rights of these ""criminals,"" and given a choice between hard time in prison for years or hard time in punishment park for three days. Guess which one is worse? Still, everyone picks punishment park where they are forced to run through the desert in intolerable heat (or cold, at night), without water, toward a destination designated by the American flag. The purpose of the punishment park is to - well, punish - and train the law enforcement officers to deal with dissidents en masse.

The whole thing is so realistically done, including the lack of script for the tribunal scenes, where the actors on both sides of the fence spoke their own invented lines based on their own life experiences, that I had to take another few minutes to remind myself that we don't have punishment parks in America. According to the director's commentary, Danish media was convinced otherwise and protested punishment parks based on this movie, then was forced to retract their protest realizing belatedly the movie was fictional.

It's a visceral picture. There is more than one reason why it had been practically banned (or simply denied distribution) for decades: not only is it pointing fingers at just about every establishment, but it is also difficult d/t the violence and lack of humanity displayed on the screen. Yet, the sheer nerve and vision of this film are undeniable. Though the point of view of the director is unmistakably that the police is bad and the prisoners are decent people, I couldn't even call the film prejudiced. It does give both sides something to say.",1136246400,28,2047,4.8262108262108265

Peter Watkins brilliantly uses the style of cinema verite and neo-realism to effectively blur the lines between what is real and what is fake. The set-up is this: the President has declared a state of national emergency to restore order. Those labeled as ""dissidents"" are charged with federal crimes and face either long prison sentences or three days at the Bear Mountain National Punishment Park, where overzealous cops and national guardsmen are trained in the methods of hunting down anyone found guilty of questioning the government. Terrifying stuff, indeed.

This film should be essential viewing for anyone interested in the future of this country. This is an IMPORTANT film that needs to be widely seen and discussed.",1134086400,6,827,5.164179104477612
2244526,4,B0007UQ2BY,"I first saw this film in 1976, my freshman year of college, played and replayed for free in the student union building of the University of New Mexico.  Two points about that: one: this was not the usual ""entertainment"" one would expect to find played for students killing time between classes, and two: this film would not be played at all in any university or college open space today.  There is no contemporary counterpart for Peter Watkins that I can think of today--he makes someone like Michael Moore look like a sixth grader with his first camcorder.  Watkins is best known for his 1965 film The War Game, a rumination on what would happen if nuclear war struck the UK, shot in his trademark ""you-are-there"" psuedo documentary style.  The film was immediatelty banned by the BBC who had originally commisioned it, for being too realistic and disturbing.  (Duh--what were they expecting, The Day After?) Watkins other great film, not available in the US, and as far as I know, never shown in American since it first appeared on PBS, then NET, in 1964, is Culloden, about the battle between the British and Scottish rebels under Bonnie Prince Charlie at Culloden Moor in the mid-eighteenth century.  I saw it when it was tv in 64 and images from it still remain with me, 40 years later.  Punishment Park proposes a US, circa 1971, where those actively against the Vietnam war, instead of being imprisoned, are set loose in some southwestern desert, pursued by police and National Guard; if they manage to reach the destination set for them by their jailers, they are set free.  If not...Implausible? Over the top?  Paranoid? Perhaps.  But I wonder what Watkins would say about The Patriot Act.  About our treatment of Iraqi prisoners.  The film shocked me thirty years ago, and I think it will shock me when I see it again.  Watkins, as unknown as he is, still is one of the important filmmakers to come out of Britian in the 60s.
