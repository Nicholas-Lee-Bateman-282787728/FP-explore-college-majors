8162264,5,B000LMPM5U,"Very informative video of a great Ocean Liner.  The facts of the ship are accurate, contrary to what some reviews have said. The know the history this great ocean liner very well.",1391212800,2,179,4.59375
8162265,2,B000LMPM5U,"As somebody who has a passion for transatlantic ocean liners, and has also researched the history of ""The Stateliest Ship"" for several years, I purchased this DVD with the misconception that it would provide a definitive and a fascinating history of the RMS Queen Mary, as is implied from the title. Furthermore, I have never had to rate any product on ocean liners this poorly before, so I regret to say that the feature did not live up to expectations, and I would urge anybody considering purchasing it, to spend their money on a book of the ship instead; you will get much more enjoyment out of it, believe me!

At the end of the feature, which is a poor 48 minutes long, and has no special features, I am not ashamed to say that I was quite upset, as I felt that the producers had let the Queen Mary down greatly. The documentary had the chance to be a detailed and comprehensive biography of the life of this legendary liner. What is recieved instead is a feature that gives the impression of a ""B-movie"". Although the information provided is accurate, that is not to say that it is relevant. The first ten minutes of the programme are wasted, by what seems like a monologue on the history of shipbuilding by some 'historian', who never relates any of his points back to the Queen Mary. This uses up almost one quarter of the feature, and as a viewer, I came to resent this man's regular appearences. The remainder of the DVD is like this, about 30-35 minutes must be devoted to ""talking heads"", and what is even more frustrating, rather than playing footage over these interviews as many documentaries do to ease the monotony, absurdly, the production team have decided to include the entire interviews' in the feature, some of which drag on for 5 to 10 minutes! I felt this to be a major shame, as some of the historians were genuine experts.

The DVD constantly breaks to a blue screen where the viewer is presented with important statistics on the Queen Mary, this wastes another 5 to 10 minutes if I have to be honest, and why they can't just be spoken by the narrator over the main feature seems utterly crass. Although the majority of the footage of the ""grand old lady"" herself, was new to me, I would say interesting, but after about five seconds, it would be abruptly stopped and another interview would commence, so that I felt that I could not entirely enjoy it. The details of the ship's ocean going career are rushed through, and the focus of the documentary is on the Queen Mary's retirement in Long Beach, which is certainly not the impression that the title conveys. What made me angry, was one particular man, who claimed that she should be sunk and turned into a reef! Absolutely ludicrous. Towards the end however, the DVD did get a little better, as more footage was shown of the ship in her present state, but just as I came to appreciate this, the documentary abruptly ended.

Overall, my impressions of this product are far from good. It did have the potential to be a fantastic resource, and it may leave you wondering how such a thing could be produced and survive being completely edited. Once again, I urge potential buyers to purchase a book on the liner instead, as this feature will prove a disappointment.",1297987200,3,3243,4.5687285223367695
8162266,2,B000LMPM5U,"To be to the point, do not buy this DVD. All it has going for it is some nice photographs and photography of the ship today. There are so many factual inacuracies in the interviews that I pondered weather or not I could get my money back a third of the way through. If you must have this, watch it without the sound turned on. Better yet buy some books on the Queen Mary. If the Queen is somthing you know about you will regret this purchase",1239235200,7,441,4.080459770114943
8162267,4,B000LMPM5U,"For those who are fans of the great liners, this is a must have DVD for you.  Filled with facts, footage and interesting tidbits, this video gives you a tour and history of one of the great ocean liners of the 20th century.",1230508800,2,223,4.186046511627907
8162268,3,B000LMPM5U,"Although there was some archival footage to satisfy the nostalgia buff, there was also a large amount of footage given over to ""talking heads"" which is a disappointment for anyone seeking a historical recap of the Queen Mary's rich and storied history.
Overall, this is a fair account of the fabled liner without the visual impact that could have been presented.",1184457600,3,362,4.950819672131147
