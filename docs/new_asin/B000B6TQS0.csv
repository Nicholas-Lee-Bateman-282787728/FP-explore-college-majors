8082606,1,B000B6TQS0,Not what we thought and not worth the money paid. Would buy again,1462665600,,65,4.076923076923077
8082607,2,B000B6TQS0,"This actually is a collection of seven mini-episodes of an old (1997) series, rather than two separate feature films the way that it's been marketed.

That in itself isn't a problem. What is a problem is that, from what I can tell, it wasn't a good series to start with. It doesn't go nearly far enough to be sexy the way that some later similar series did, although I see a lot of evidence that this was edited to death before release. In fact one of the little episodes has no nudity in it at all, which is just unacceptable as far as I'm concerned. We aren't buying this crap for its horrendous soundtrack, after all (and make no mistake about it--it's horrendous).

The women (including a young Beverly Lynne, dispelling the myth that she actually was born old--and an old Monique Parent who, apparently, actually WAS born old) are not very attractive and we wouldn't really be able to the ones who do look pretty good because the cameras just don't show us much. The sex scenes are dull, even laughable at points. I have to believe that  this series was aimed at women because there's nearly as much male exposure as female exposure, and everything is all about sex wrapped in the guise of tenderness and ""love.""",1419897600,,1217,4.5479452054794525
8082608,3,B000B6TQS0,Great DVD for the price and like softcore. The DVD will play in a regular DVD player but will not play on computer DVD players. Its too bad because I watch all my DVDs on the computer and tried it on 3 computers with no luck . I guest the VOB info files are not correct or wasn't mastered correctly player would open then have error and won't play.,1418169600,,348,4.057971014492754
8082609,4,B000B6TQS0,"I'm a fan of softcore erotica and intimate sessions is one of my favorite eroticas.  The stories on this DVD are somewhat based on real life and fantasy at the same time.  Whe I bought this DVD, I've noticed that side B was edited and why was that? I still enjoyed the DVD anyway and somebody talk to york entertainment about the editing please and I also like to give a shout-out to waynehamtx for a good delivery for this masterpiece and I hope somebody will read this review.",1394064000,,478,4.359550561797753
