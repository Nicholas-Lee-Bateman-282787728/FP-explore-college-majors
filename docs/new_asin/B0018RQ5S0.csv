8270848,4,B0018RQ5S0,"This 22-minute documentary is a solid little introduction to the cultural sites in Santiago De Compestela, Spain, and is geared toward potential pilgrims to the tomb of Saint James the Apostle. It features some of the extraordinary architecture that has accumulated there over the centuries, particularly the interiors of the cathedral, as well as some obscure historical and religious factoids. For instance, I had not known that St. Francis of Assisi founded a parish in Santiago. The film simply points out some different things to see and do if one happens to end up in Santiago on pilgrimmage. Soothing classical music and precise narration accompanies the images, which have a certain rythmic beauty. There are no interviews and nobody actually speaks on-camera during the film, which prefers to linger over its footage with nothing more than a fairly steady voice narration. Although I felt indifferent to this style at first, I gradually found the lack of analysis by on-screen ""experts"" and veteran walkers refreshing, as it allowed me to enjoy the imagery without being ""talked"" to death. I also enjoyed the film's brevity in saying a lot in such a short running time: The major conceit of this type of documentary is that it often runs far too long.

Special features on the DVD include three very basic maps of the El Camino pilgrimmage route (Spain, Europe, Global) and monthly weather information for Santiago. Language options include English, German and Italian narration -- the film was produced by Italians. My only critique is that I thought the film might have benefitted from just a little more information about how people actually travel the Camino, as it seems geared toward people who already know the background of it. But overall, this is a minor quibble, as this film is a solid little picture postcard of a very popular UNESCO World Heritage Site. If that's what you're looking for, here you go.",1349827200,2,1924,5.0125
8270849,2,B0018RQ5S0,"I was under the impression that this video would deal with the experience of actually walking the camino.  It does not at all.  It just features a rather boring view of several of the cities along the Camino Frances.  At only 40 minutes long, I consider it very over priced.",1252713600,10,274,4.44
