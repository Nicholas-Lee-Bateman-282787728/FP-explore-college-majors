4666867,5,B005ELVC3O,"Mysteries are one of my favorite things in life and trying to figure out the whys and the how comes, and so forth.  I also love the mysteries of our planet and how there is so much to be learned and then the whys when we do learn something.  There are always going to be more questions than answers, but that is part of the great mysteries of life.  There are a lot of different history mysteries to this package and it is worth it.",1364169600,2,432,4.0588235294117645
4666868,4,B005ELVC3O,"This is what I call a one timer...Very interesting and I enjoyed it from start to end, but not as addictive as some of the other History channel documentaries that I have watched over and over, and will watch again...",1350518400,20,217,4.45
4666869,3,B005ELVC3O,"I don't take these short History Channel documentaries entirely seriously anyway, but that isn't why I watch them.  I appreciate the sense of wonder and hint of strange they try to convey.  I bought this collection for the size & price, and it was more or less what I expected  I guess, but noticeably uneven.  Not all of these shows were produced for the same broadcast program, so the approach is a bit different from episode to episode.  For example, one show treated Roswell with incredible skepticism, but another views crop circles with absurd credulity.  The ""Nazi Ghost Train"" episode must have been selected for inclusion on the title alone by someone who never bothered to view it, because while there may be some history involved, there's nothing mysterious about it (it was a Belgian train that was sabotaged so it couldn't deliver prisoners to German concentration camps; there's no unexplained phenomena involved at all).  Certainly ok for the price and affords a few hours of distraction, but hardly the pinnacle of the genre.",1328918400,46,1041,4.948275862068965
4666870,5,B005ELVC3O,My husband and I have always loved History's Mysteries.  We were thrilled to find such a large collection for such a reasonable price.  We are very happy with this purchase!,1327968000,10,173,4.733333333333333
4666871,2,B005ELVC3O,Wasn't really worth the time watching. Good item to add to your history channel collection. Gave no good information or showed anything exciting. Just talked about mysteries. Nothing to have you on the edge of your seat.,1326153600,11,220,4.972972972972973

4666887,3,B005ELVC3O,The usual stuff I have come to expect from The History Channel. Somewhat entertaining corny crap good for some laughs. It did not cost much and it makes for good back ground noise. For the price not bad.,1474934400,,203,4.368421052631579

Amazon provides me with All this plus great deals and fast shipping, at low prices.
The support staff and packaging Staff both offer excellent services, and as a bonus for me...being able to procure what I love at better than home charges in New Zealand makes me a very Happy Customer with No complaints.
AMAZON gets a 10/10 score from this zealous guy.
Thanks Amazon.",1377043200,6,594,4.5607476635514015
4666910,3,B005ELVC3O,"This is definitely a low level collection of History Channel documentaries. I did not get my money's worth on this set as all topics are all too brief and filled with information which is very old and very well known. The best episode is the one on the Bermuda Triangle  but it just stops short of being compelling and offers a basic ""There's something There"" generic explanation.",1372636800,6,380,4.6716417910447765

8468643,5,B005ELVC3O,"Nice 4 DVD set about the most interesting subjects of the world, conspiracies, myths and legends.  I do not affirm I am avid believer but it does raise a question just how much do we know about events that transpired and if official black book kept records of such events, just how world changing or life affirming they could be?  It makes you wonder that is for sure and no it doesn't make a tin foil hat wearer for wondering,  some of the most creative shows are based on these, like X-Files, Hercules: The Legendary Journeys, Sliders, Earth Final Conflict, Stargate SG1 and Atlantis.  Great stuff!",1519171200,,600,4.632075471698113
