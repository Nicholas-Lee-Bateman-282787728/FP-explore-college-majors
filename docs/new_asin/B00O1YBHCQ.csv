6701707,3,B00O1YBHCQ,"This is somewhere between ""Rocky"" and ""Million Dollar Baby"" but not as good as either.

Here's the scoop. Based on a true, and ongoing story, Mary Kom (a name given to her by her boxing trainer) is a feisty young girl living in India. She doesn't like injustice and tries to beat up guys who are mistreating their girlfriends. One fight takes her o a gym that trains boxers. The head trainer sees her toughness and willingness but won't train a woman. She changes his mind and she becomes the best female boxer in India. Bu the road is not without its bumps.

This is an okay, watchable movie. It takes the viewer through the meeting of Mary, her training, and the trials and tribulations of being a female boxer in India. But it all seems so familiar. The reluctant trainer. The training itself. The problems with trying to be successful at something while juggling a marriage and two children. For instance: The final, and longest, training sequence is set outdoors. Is it harder to do pushups on rocks as opposed to a floor? Is it harder to do any of these exercises outdoors than it is to do them indoors. This seemed to be staged strictly for the audiences edification. Then there is the scene when she's fighting for her 3rd world title while here infant son is having heart surgery. This is so blatantly aiming for the heartstrings I was surprised anyone would have the gawl to try and get away with it. The fight scenes are not all that well staged either. The women don't fight like fighters. They rarely hold their hands correctly or move correctly. It doesn't feel authentic.

Like I said, this is an okay watch. Just don't expect too much out of it.",1437350400,,1661,4.53
6701708,3,B00O1YBHCQ,I'll try to watch this again and maybe get a different take on it.  Just didn't like the way it was filmed.  Not a fan of Bollywood as the filming reminds me too much of what I don't enjoy about Hollywood.  Many similarities.,1435795200,,225,4.186046511627907

I do not know the language spoken in the movie. I only found this out after I paid for it and started watching it. Does anyone know if there is a version with subtitles?",1466121600,,319,3.8484848484848486

8681505,4,B00O1YBHCQ,"It's a solid ""beat the odds against a doubting society and corrupt governing body"" sports movie, much like ""Chak De! India"" with SRK. I have little background knowledge of Mary Kom's biography, but since she helped out with the production of the movie, I have to believe that it's quite accurate in the broadest sense. Priyanka Chopra is a solid actress for roles that demand athleticism, action, and intensity, and I enjoyed watching her. The movie has songs in the sound track, but no dance numbers. As in all Indian movies, some of the characters, especially anti-heroes, are cartoonishly overdrawn. Don't expect to think hard about whom to root for and whom to despise. It's much more polished and neat than Rocky, lacking any grittiness and genuine drama. It's fun to watch, but it's difficult to be gripped by the story.",1445472000,2,826,4.865248226950355
