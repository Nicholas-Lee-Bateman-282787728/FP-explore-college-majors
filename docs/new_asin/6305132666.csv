973730,5,6305132666,"There is no limit to the things I can say about this movie!  It was absolutly wonderful!  Michael Douglas leads the terrific cast.  He is so down to earth and realistic!  Annette Bening is perfect in her role.  Martin Sheen deserves a best supporting actor award.  Michael J. Fox is  HILARIOUS, and David Paymer is wonderful too!  ""Do you think there's a  florist in there planning an assassination on the off-chance I might be  stopping by?""---""It's possible...""  Keeps you laughing  forever!  If you're in the mood for a truly wonderful movie, The American  President is a must see!",924998400,,584,4.826530612244898
973731,5,6305132666,"This movie covers a different view of a President. In one moment you feel for him and in another you hate what he does. It gives you a look at how the life of the President, private and personal are always looked at. I  really recomend this movie to any one who has ever thought of being the  President.",911865600,,303,4.11864406779661

973969,5,6305132666,"A guilty pleasure.  There's something about this movie that gets to me.  Maybe it's the President that Michael Douglas portrays.  Maybe he is the president I'd like to have.  He's a nice guy and caring and fair with a sense of humor.  This is more a love story than any political intrigue and could definitely be considered a ""chick flick"" (politically incorrect?).  I think one of the things that draws me to this movie is its connection with West Wing, one of my all time favorite TV series.  There are a few plot lines that writer Aaron Sorkin incorporated into his TV show and several of the cast members of the movie ended up as regulars in the series, albeit in different roles.  Martin Sheen, chief of staff in the movie, was president in the TV show.  Anna Deavere Smith is another of the cast carried over in the TV show.  In both the movie and the TV show there are many characters that you grow to like.  I resisted buying this DVD for a long time but finally said what the heck.  If I was channel surfing and came across the movie, I'd stop and watch it regardless of where in was in the movie so I felt it was time to just buy the DVD.",1519257600,4,1148,4.23963133640553

974065,1,6305132666,"I love the character story and the characters, but I cannot stand the politics.  It's funny that I when I first saw this movie 25 years ago, I didn't see just how proselytizing the movie had been.  I think the ending speech by the ""President"" sums up the views: Gun control, the ACLU, burning flags, and global warming.  Behind it all is a twisted presentation of moral virtue.  It's ironic that Clinton had his tussle with morality just 3 years after this movie, but this time they defended adultery (to maintain political power): not virtuous at all.",1518220800,,552,4.65979381443299

The actor's could not have been better chosen, nor could they have better portrayed the characters.

974463,5,6305132666,"In one of the most romantic movies of the decade, Michael Douglas and Annette Bening sizzle on-screen as a modern-day couple, trying to feel their way through their relationship. Bening works for the EPA and Douglas is the President. Their attraction is immediate but when the President's rival drags Bening through the muck, will they survive or was it not meant to be?

A wonderful romantic comedy to snuggle up to your partner with and enjoy. Plenty of humorous dialogue and hijinx for any viewer.

I have never seen her be anything but great in any work in which I have ever seen her.  The supporting cast is excellent.  Martin Sheen and Michael J. fox are great.

Of course, I do not have the slightest idea how realistic the movie is from a political standpoint.  The ""liberals"" seem to play the ""good guys"" and the ""conservatives"" seem to play the ""bad guys"".  Personally I just wanted to enjoy the movie as a movie.  I just tried to enjoy it as a movie viewing experience and let it go at that.  The chemistry seems to work.

This movie seems to presage the television series ""West Wing"".  I enjoyed that show just as much, at least the early episodes.  Thank You...",1488153600,,818,4.558620689655172

The movie was filled with political arguments(can a film about a presidency during an election year not?), which is why I gave it only four stars, but producing such a screenplay, without taking certain political positions, is perhaps expecting too much.
Two points I came away with after re-watching The American President: yes, the personal character of the most powerful political leader of the free world does matter. Secondly, the presidency is probably the most stressful position anyone can hold; the weight of decisions faced every day, with every action, and every word, on display for the world to see and hear...it ain't easy.",1481328000,,737,5.201680672268908

976144,5,6305132666,"This is an absolutely perfect movie from many angles. Despite all the politics going on, Douglas and Bening give performances that are stellar and authentic. Reiner's direction creates an atmosphere of the President we all long for - one who absolutely loves this country and is beyond reproach. Everyone respects the man even if they don't respect his political views, and the ""odd couple"" of an environmental lobbyist with a widower President and father is handled with such relish and charm that one can't help fall in love with this couple as they do. This is a smart, witty, and tightly written comedy that never disrespects the Office - even to the very last line of dialogue.",1480377600,,682,4.837606837606837

Michael Douglas plays the lonely widower to perfection.  His best friend is Economics Nobel Winner Martin Sheen, who simply took it to another level when they went to TV with the West Wing. Michael J. Fox ? Richard Dreyfus, the phenomenal Annette Bening, John Mahoney , David Paymer, Anna Deavere Smith. A tour de force supporting cast of unquestionable professional acting genius that take a perfectly tailored script to a bang-up conclusion that will leave you happy and satisfied",1479772800,2,643,5.123809523809523

976594,5,6305132666,"The best romantic movie I have seen! Both lead actor/actress were excellent, and their respective personality (whether learned or natural) were perfectly played roles.  The single-mindedness of the President depicted as a widower in the story was masterfully and convincingly played. Social expectations were fulfilled by him by waiting one year before starting to date anyone. His relationship with his daughter was positive. She was definitely a priority in his life, shown by listening to her, complementing her, and giving him 'advice'.  He didn't start flamboyantly to date woman at random. Rather, he looked for a woman with an independent in mind and one who is confident, rather than one who is needy and single-mindedly shallow looking for status and influence. Highly recommend this film to be viewed by anyone.",1479168000,,821,5.3076923076923075

Warner Bros apparently never released a 16:9 aspect ratio version of this movie on DVD.  Only on Blu-Ray. Again, I love this movie.  The movie gets a 5/5 stars.  But this DVD is not worth $1.

Yet watching the issues presented in the movie, you might think you were turning on a national news network for the latest on America's political issues.",1478563200,,386,4.7611940298507465

977154,5,6305132666,in this political year; the impassioned speech Michael Douglas delivers as the President makes me proud to be an American and for those who are critical of all things government; it smacks of the truth.  Instead of complaining and blaming; work together to make things better.  I am fearful for our country and look forward to a positive outcome for our country's leadership and future.  This is actually a very inspiring movie in this political climate.,1478563200,,454,4.947368421052632

977297,3,6305132666,"The movie is so filled with propaganda that sadly the fine part of it that deals with romance... is almost lost. Well made film but... apparently all of the President's concerns are Da da! Israel of course and those evil Libyans whom our country has  now destroyed and before that bank robbery  was even complete DA DA! set up a central bank associated with the DADA! a prominent Rothschild bank... a name that is also... in the movie as just a you know, common political operative.

This movie of course was back in the day when Hollywood films that is of course, Jewish produced and directed films like The American President and to be honest... almost every movie made before it and since... took a leftist cartoon approach to American politics.
No mention of say... Russia ever... and what happened after 1917, the mass slaughter of tens of millions and who did it.. ... no movies about burning Germans alive by the 100s of thousands... in scientifically created firestorms but yes always a highly propagandized fictional account of all of the 20th Century but today, same group makes movies about heroic American soldiers in the countries around Israel rooted on by ""Neocons"" meaning the formerly horrible right wing by now OK because they are Zionists... turned Republican... that is, after their grandparents were communists and grand parents revolutionary mass murderers in Russia.
But I digress.
The gun control and global warming thickness in the story tells one who also is behind that... now its climate change of course and its laid on so thick that you want to throw-up.

However the personal stuff IS good and the leads excellent.
That said, that personal stuff is there to carry the propaganda. Still on only the romance side of the movie, it is above average.",1478390400,,1776,4.851485148514851

Global warming crap is portrayed as being something that is actually happening, when it is nothing but a hoax based on computer models and not any true imperical data.

978961,4,6305132666,"This was an entertaing movie that held my interest for its entirety, which says a lot. I watch few movies and no television.

When I search for a movie, I do so realizing that whatever I watch will use up nearly 2 hours that I could spend on something more productive. So, quality is important to me.

This movie is rated PG13 for a handful of profanity, two light kissing scenes, and one brief scene with minor adult sexual content.

I recommend this movie to mature audiences. It's good entertainment.",1476230400,,503,4.566666666666666

But upon re-watching this movie recently, I can't get over how it's really just a left wing propaganda flick. Hollywood has been doing this for generations now. The most infamous quote of the movie...""We are coming after the Guns!""  Do they not realize that handguns (and even semi-automatic weapons) existed in 1787?",1476144000,2,450,4.769230769230769

981897,5,6305132666,"Magical.  Truly Capra-esque in the truest sense of the term.  Michael Douglas and Annette Benning are perfect in the lead roles of the President and the environmental lobbyist with whom he falls in love.  Martin Sheen, Richard Dreyfuss, and Michael J. Fox play the supporting leads in a superbly acted movie that will leave you rooting for another term for Douglas.

982176,4,6305132666,"A charming romantic comedy written by a master of the political comedy Aaron Sorkin.  The film made in 1994 focuses on two pieces of legislation - one is an anti-crime bill that is designed to ban assault weapons in private hands and the other is an environmental bill designed to lower emissions by 20%.  In 2016, these issues have not yet been resolved. Is this progress.  The film is a comedy but the issues aren't.  While the president gets the girl and it all ends happily, I wish we could say the same thing for progress in this country.  Think about that as the final credits roll.",1473984000,,588,4.457943925233645

983037,1,6305132666,"I was surprised to see no long negative reviews after I watched this movie. It was disappointing, cliche, and in a simple word, stupid. Even though music would swell at crucial scenes and people look impressed, still it seemed anti-climatic whatever the scene was. And I have to admit, the love story just wasn't realistic. Two such professionally successful and highly intelligent people would not be so unthinking in a relationship. Spoiler: meet once for minutes awkwardly, formal date once with barely moments of privacy, dinner with kid and quick kiss, and boom their sleeping together as though they were college sophomores that had no standards of responsibility. If this was a chick flick, okay, I can understand how ludicrous this was, but I thought it would be something more than that and have an actual storyline. There was just so little depth in how they developed their relationship, especially at first. So, while some may love this, I would not recommend it as I rarely find a movie I wish I hadn't wasted time watching - this was one of them. Just a warning: If you aren't in love with this movie within the first few minutes, I don't think you will be happy seeing it through.",1473292800,2,1195,4.75

984153,3,6305132666,"Douglas and Benning were very likable.  Their characters seemed like people I would like to know --they worked hard at doing their jobs well, seemed good to their colleagues and friends and family.  They seemed to genuinely care about other people.  I enjoyed watching their relationship develop and then was slammed up against the wall (once again) when the leading characters slept together when they still barely knew each other.  Up to that point, I was enjoying the movie.  Yes, the story is still well-told, but I just wasn't as interested in the protagonists after that.  In the scene where Benning is looking for a vest or something she left at the White House and is in a froth of self-righteous anger, I was rolling my eyes.  He had indeed sold her out, but he had sold her out way before that when he bed her without waiting to wed her.  Old fashioned, I know ... but true.",1472428800,,884,4.550632911392405

We've had a President for the last 7+ years that has been as close to this ideal as any in my lifetime (nearly 70 years) but those who oppose him and his political philosophy are more strident and angry than ever.  This film reminds me that even our President is an 'everyman'.  Watching it is to my political self like eating comfort food in January.,1470528000,,422,4.30379746835443

It is romantic in an old fashioned way but current politically as only Aaron Sorkin can write them.  Annette Benning is witty, radiant and intelligent.  All the future West Wing folks were stellar, especially the future POTUS, Martin Sheen, as the Chief of Staff this time around. It's on my list to watch once a year and during this election period, it gives us hope that there are still politicians who have integrity, moral courage and backbone.  It's not an earth shaking story but so worth the time to escape today's nastiness and lack of respect to a time and place where good old fashioned ideals can still be celebrated.",1469923200,2,712,4.664

986525,4,6305132666,An entertaining movie with good performances by Michael Doulas and Annette Bening. Martin Sheen and Michael J. Fox provide good supporting roles. The trappings of the presidency are always awesome when they are portayed right. The movie does seem like a long episode of the West Wing at times. The plot is a little corny with people overwhelmed that they are talking to the President and a surprise ending that isn't practical in real life politics. Still a great romantic comedy and the actors pull it off despite some screenplay triteness.,1469318400,,541,4.956043956043956

987042,4,6305132666,"Good movie. It's easy to spot Aaron Sorkin's writing style in this. Lots of walk-and-talk, lots of rainy weather as background; even some of the dialogue found its way into The West Wing (""the virtues of a proportionate response"" for instance). Weird seeing Martin Sheen as the Chief of Staff and not as the president. The acting is good and the story is light. Nice romantic comedy, with overtones of politics as the B storyline. Fun, but not serious.",1468800000,,452,4.734177215189874

I do like the story but frankly had to try and ignore the far left, ultra-liberal perspective regarding the characters and political policies.
In this movie conservatives are devils and liberals are saints. I'm an old fashioned liberal myself, just pointing out that maybe a bit less in the way of demonizing a large part of the audience would have been better for a feel good movie.
Still, the characters are likable, I enjoyed it and would recommend it for those who won't take the political messages seriously.",1463270400,,656,4.615384615384615

987710,4,6305132666,"This review is about the movie and NOT the transference to DVD or any other medium.

What do you get when you have Michael Douglas, Annette Benning and Rob Reiner at the helm?  Well folks, you get one helluva comedy, especially when considering the supporting cast of Martin Sheen, Michael J. Fox and Richard Dreyfuss.  Douglas plays (fictitious) President Andrew Shepherd a widower in the White House.  Benning is Sydney Ellen Wade, a lobbyist working on behalf an environmental group.  She is predictably oft times at odds with the President's politics but eventually becomes smitten with Shepherd's charm.

This is a fun movie.  It doesn't make you think, it doesn't leave you wondering.  It's entertainment, plain, pure and simple.  This is what a good movie should do.  You pay for entertainment.  If you want reality, drama and intrigue, look outside - there's plenty of it.",1462233600,,880,5.0

Annette Benning and Michael Douglas are funny, tender, gentle, passionate, and made for each other.

I really dislike the fact that the consumer is not made aware that this DVD is in letterbox form.  It specifies that on the actual case!  That information should be so specified in the description of the DVD.  Be AWARE and read carefully the back of the case BEFORE opening.  As much as I love this movie, I would never have purchased it had I known it was in letterbox format.",1452038400,,638,4.294117647058823
987976,5,6305132666,"At last! A version of ""The American President"" that is a pleasure to watch, and it's found on Amazon Video.

The movie itself is wonderful. It's a romantic comedy that features Michael Douglas as U.S. President Andrew Shepard, who's also a widower with a teen-age daughter. He falls in love with Sydney Ellen Wade (played by Annette Bening), who's a lobbyist for an environmental group that opposes some of Shepard's energy policies. Sparks fly between the President, the lobbyist, and some of the President's other political enemies who want to use the issue of his affair to score political points against him.

""The American President"" is filled with humor in a script written by Aaron Sorkin. The dialogue is sharp and fast, as is often the case with Sorkin's best work. The acting by the ensemble cast (Douglas, Bening, Martin Sheen, Michael J. Fox, David Paymer, Richard Dreyfuss, and others) sparkles throughout the movie.

What makes this version of ""The American President"" especially enjoyable is the quality of the video and audio. This is the first time I've ever seen the film in any other format that the tired old DVD copy I've owned for years. Instead of the dated, non-anamorphic, low resolution version found on my disc, I was treated to a full-blown high definition edition replete with 5.1 surround sound. It was like watching it for the very first time. It was indeed a revelation to me to view ""The American President"" the way it must have looked in theaters.

988748,2,6305132666,"Here's everything you need to know about this agenda laden propaganda piece by noted Hollywood liberals, Rob Reiner, Aaron Sorkin, Michael Douglas, Annette Benning and Michael J. Fox. One of the scenes, sweet enough to require a sugary substance advisory, shows the liberal democratic President (Michael Douglas) playing Parcheesi with his daughter and environmental lobbyist girlfriend (Annette Benning) while his political rival and republican Senator (Richard Dreyfus) is in a smokey wood paneled conference room sipping scotch, smoking cigars and conspiratorially plotting the president's demise. The president stands for all things good according to Hollywood liberals (the environment, gun control, the ACLU, etc.) while the republicans are portrayed as only standing for anything against the democrats. Everything Reiner and Sorkin have done has a liberal bias, a strong liberal bias, and any film they are involved with should come with a warning label.",1427587200,,961,5.7272727272727275

The picture (even though widescreen) is about 1/4 the size of the TV screen - huge black spaces on all 4 sides of the screen with a little picture in the middle. Even my wife, who never notices anything about picture or surround sound on any movie, said she can't watch it because she can hardly make out the people - we have a 52"" TV. I'm not a hater, this is just a really bad job of transferring an old move to DVD format. I did manually change the aspect on my TV to enlarge the picture which did work and I was able to fill the screen, but it's a bit like zooming in on a low res image, it's not as clear but at least we could stand to watch it once.",1418515200,2,766,3.8544303797468356

The only caution I would have is the occasional language and the fact that there is a physical relationship outside the auspices of marriage. Not what we have brought our daughter up to be okay with, but she is old enough to see the things in the world for what they are. The overall feel of this movie is great.

It was funny. / It was witty. / The Acting was great throughout./  It was interesting and moved right along. / The cursing was kept in tow. / The love scenes were adequately romantic. /  The chemistry came off great between Douglas and the other actors. / Fox and Sheen especially made this viewer feel that they were really communicating with a president. / Douglas and Bening were also  delightful.

I just can't say enough about the believability of the characters. It is always a pleasure to watch a movie (3 times now for this one) with a good start, a good ending, and great stuff in between.",1407715200,,859,4.265432098765432

Recently, I purchased 5 DVDs from Amazon.  Of the 3 that I have watched, this is the only one that has a problem.  I do not know why the DVD version of this movie has a 'fuzzy' area going down the middle of the picture. Difficult to ignore.  I own a VHS copy, which I 'was' going to replace with the new DVD. The VHS version doesn't have the problem.  Is it a conversion problem?  Something to do with letterbox format?  FYI, we played it on a Toshiba combination VHS/DVD player -- fairly new.

989647,2,6305132666,"4 things you need to know before buying:

This DVD is non-anamophic. Doesn't matter what the latest DVD version says, the picture will be 2x smaller than your widescreen TV, with black bars all around. (Why do they do this? Back in the day, home videos had to be in 4:3 boxes since all TVs were 4:3, so they took the widescreen film and cropped the sides. Then in 2000, DVDs came out. So how do they put it into widescreen? In this case, they simply cropped the tops. Yes, INSTEAD of reverting to the original widescreen film reel, they cropped the sides and then later cropped the tops. You now have a 2x smaller picture. If this sounds unacceptable to you, then you're absolutely right.)

This film does not sit on the political fence. Its message is leftist, and the republicans are flat non-character characters. Please note this is coming from a somewhat liberal guy, so personally I don't uber-hate the politics here, but the villains are flat and not a lot in this movie made me actually think. Also, many political moments are pretty unrealistic, like the President coming out on stage and strongly endorsing ACLU. These moments exceed casual literary exaggeration and cannot suspend my disbelief.

Here's what really irks me and I didn't see in any other reviews: The relationship between the President and girlfriend is incredibly chauvenistic and one-sided. Virtually every scene when they're together, the guy is pushing her around, manhandling her will in every way except physically wrestling. The scene where he pressures her to have dinner (meatloaf night) until finally she whimpers 'mm-hmm' is probably the epitome of this. Like I said I'm a guy so I hesitate to decry how huge a turn-off this is, but if most woman actually find this romantic, then that's just too bad because that kind of disrespect to woman is never gonna work in my relationships.

Finally, the writing is pretty decent. Say what you will about Aaron Sorkin, but the man can write dialogue. The conversations in this film are witty, fast-paced, and funny in equally-spaced and relatively far above-average amounts. Let me compare it to a stereotype: For a movie with no explosions, The American President is nonetheless not boring anywhere by any means, and this is accomplished entirely with dialogue and character.

Overall, 2 stars.",1396915200,,2324,4.903307888040713

989926,2,6305132666,"There are allot of really great aspects of this film, primarily the acting.  You really get a sense of who every one is.  Even the relationship plot of the film is good.  It begs the question as to how would the American people respond to a single president.  However, it gets only 3 stars from me because of the obvious political agenda of the film.  It's filled with obvious bs liberal agenda and what's worse is that it's all fabricated lies.  At one point wade States that a child can purchase an Uzi with a 3 day waiting period....  hogwash.  In the final press conference scene Shepard States he is coming after the hand guns and assault rifles of the American people and he will get the guns.....  liberal wet dream.  Such a statement made by a sitting president would lead to record low polling and lack of a second term.",1395273600,,829,4.430463576158941

989928,5,6305132666,One of my all time favorites! A feel good movie about the presidency. Can't help but cheer when the President lashes out at his opponent for his back stabbing behavior and thens sends the right legislation to Congress. Yea!,1395187200,,223,4.743589743589744
989929,3,6305132666,"This is a cute romance but has the usual, predictable, Hollywood, Liberal bias.  Putting Richard Dryfus in as the major ""evil"" Republican figure just tops it all off.  I might have enjoyed the story if they weren't angering me so much with the usual Hollywood bias.",1395100800,,265,4.739130434782608

989932,3,6305132666,It was a fair movie related to a romance of the president. It did get into political correctness which made this only an okay movie.,1394928000,,132,4.32

Good characters through out...so if you enjoy emulating movies emulate this one.",1394236800,,283,5.431818181818182
990092,5,6305132666,"This well acted, strongly written and skillfully directed film vividly depicts a portion of the life of a US president.

990175,5,6305132666,This is a story on what it is LIKE to be President. Something many of us rarely see. Too many times we only get the political side of the coin.

990274,5,6305132666,I loved it... ..the glimpse of behind the scenes of  lobbying...gave me some hope that sometimes good can  come out of it... that corporate bullying of legislators might not be the only way laws get passed  for we the people.  Loved  the playful dialogue  between the lovers .....A tearful...joy to watch.,1393718400,,305,4.882352941176471

990278,3,6305132666,"Great story line and very well acted. Unfortunately it is obvious that the director wanted to show Democrats as great people [ even when sleeping around which is somehow good and acceptable behavior? ] and the Republicans as mean spirited sinister people who are prudish and uncaring. If you overlook the didactic liberal messages, and there are a lot to overlook, it is a fun and entertaining movie. I suppose good film making requires an exceptional protagonist and a very evil nemesis and they did this quite well. I liked it but would caution the viewer to not suspend belief while watching this one. You will have to leave a gaping whole in your sole to buy any of this at a serious level.

Granted most shows incorporate a bunch of fantasy, but I commented on how absurd many of the shows plot lines are since they are based in the White House or involved the President. She questioned my reasoning, but I thought you could have drama while being somewhat realistic as to what could go on in the White House. Not wanting to watch the 'West Wing' series again, I went with this movie.

Even still, the potentially new President's wife was not what I would say is the kind of woman that people who have a voice, in this way of choosing who is to be what, would like her.  She seems to be rewarding as a confidant to the President, but her main line conversation is continually sarcastic, demeaning of the rich, and martyred

991020,5,6305132666,"My wife thinks this is the greatest movie ever made, so I'm reviewing on her behalf.  Michael Douglas, Annette Benning, and Michael J. Fox star along with a bunch of people you have seen before but don't know who they are.  A pretty brilliant story actually, a widowed President figures out a way to find love while battling the bars of his ivory prison and Congress as he falls for a political consultant of all things.  It's Love vs Politics, and we get to watch who wins.  Rob Reiner directed this, so you know it will be pretty good and intelligently funny.

Ms Benning isn't very authentic as a tough ""political closer"" but she sure can cry convincingly, which is always fun to watch.  It's interesting and funny to watch Mr Douglas figure out how to do simple things, like buy flowers, for a girl he likes.  MJ Fox is the moral compass for the President, in an energetic and slightly neurotic role that suits him well. The road to the end is more interesting and humorous than the end itself, but it's a feel-good romantic comedy that even the guys will (secretly) like.  My wife has watched it dozens of times, it makes her happy and that's what it is all about..",1390867200,,1170,4.460093896713615

I skipped over most of the rest of the movie once the offer was made and it appeared it would be accepted, to avoid seeing this behavior.  I restarted the movie near the end, which was pretty good again.

992483,5,6305132666,"Okay let's be honest... Politics is a dirty business and idealism yields to the realities of power. But, underneath the reality no matter what politics people espouse, we ALL want love, we all want to see others to try and do good. That's what this movie is really about. Aaron Sorkin is a writing genius, he is what I wish I could do. Like his politics or hate them, (I personally don't care one way or the other) one must admit the man can write dialogue like no one else except Damon Runyon (maybe). The pace, the pitch, the right word at the right moment... I'm in awe every time. No wonder The West Wing is my favorite TV show ever, even after Sorkin left he created a monument to language and articulate speech, and this was the launching point. My only issue with this film is that I have to mute the F-word, really Mr. Sorkin, ""profanity is the crutch of the conversational cripple!"" I wish I could remember who said that quote.

I think Rob Reiner, is one of those Directors who tells his actors, ""do what you do"" and points the camera where he needs it. That's the way I like it. In this film with Michael Douglas and Annette Benning did he need to do more? I don't think so! The casting couldn't be more perfect.

You know, as much as I adore Mr. Douglas I've seen more of his father's films, then his. That said, he embodies everything that you want to see in his character. At times, he's stately and regal, at others charming and witty, at others decisive and even ruthless. But most of all, he's a good guy who wants to find love again. Really, you have to root for him.

Annette Benning must have the most beautiful shoulders and neck on earth. Really, nobody looks better in a strapless gown. I love the fact that she's not a woman who goes through the movie proving herself to every man. Yes, she's in a man's world, (playing hardball with the most powerful man on the planet) but she's not shoving that fact down the audience's throat. She's smart, strong, and supremely capable. That's all she needs to be professionally, and it works. In her personal life she's very much like any other good woman, full of idiosyncrasies, vulnerabilities, warm, loving, and kind. In other words, a decent human being first, then a killer political operative. Bravo!

Martin Sheen, (the future Jed Bartlet) was wonderful as the White House COS and you can see glimpses of the future in his role. Warm and wonderful, my only complaint is that it's too small! I would have loved a scene with him and Mr. Dreyfuss.

Richard Dreyfuss as Senator Rumson, now I admit this movie makes the Republicans the bad guys, but when watching a movie who doesn't love a villain you love to hate? Seriously, half the fun in any fiction is hating the bad guy and Dreyfuss is AMAZING in a ""twirling Mustache"" role with his charisma and showmanship. He's honestly my second favorite character, completely brilliant!

Michael J. Fox as Lewis Rothschild Okay he's my favorite! Lewis is the precursor to Josh Lyman of The West Wing, and I've got a thing for the ""doers"" he has one major scene where he just grabs the heart and squeezes it with all the talent he possesses.

Most of the rest of the cast would find it's way on to the small screen in Sorkin's kingdom, and this movie shows you why. There isn't a single weak link here.

All in all, this film gives 99.9% of people what they want in an underdog romantic comedy regardless of political ideology. Much like another movie made sixty years before. That movie is Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. So enjoy the Capra-esque experience, drink in the idealism (if not the ideals) and root for finding love and loyal friendships. After all, that's what everyone wants, and most deserve out of life.",1383091200,,3728,4.5125925925925925

992751,5,6305132666,"I've always been a fan of films from the 90s, and this film is a gem among the seabed.  The predecessor to ""The West Wing"" (seriously, see how many plot points are later repeated in that show), this film stars Michael Douglas as a father, widower, resident of Wisconsin, card-carrying member of the ACLU, member of the Democractic Party, and...oh yeah, President of the United States.  Facing an approaching re-election, a fierce Republican rival, a crime bill headed for Congress, a state dinner with the President of France, problems with the Middle East, and a possible love interest, played by Annette Bening, the man's day is certainly never boring...and neither is this film.  Michael Douglas comes off as a likable guy, so it's no wonder that he enters this film under high regard and respect.  Unfortunetly, his desire to keep his job (who doesn't have that these days) soon interfears with all that high regard and respect stuff and the White House staff find themselves on shakey grounds.  Annette Bening's character is definetly more focused as she fights to save the envierment and hopes to get the president's support for such a plan.  Though a deal is struck, both characters have a lot of work ahead of them and will have their character and marols tested along the way.  This is a film worth watching and owning if you can never seem to catch it on television.  While there are those who regard this film as a ""libereal fantasy"", I remind everyone that it's simply a movie and not a documentary.  If you want to learn about politics, read a book.

""The American President"" is an eternal must-see film.",1372204800,,326,4.839285714285714
993080,4,6305132666,"If you enjoyed the TV series ""The West Wing,"" you'll like ""The American President,"" the movie that partly inspired it. They have the same setting and tone, and writer Aaron Sorkin is the man behind both. His stories are never about toppling the empire, but they are about the people who help make democracy work, and the elements are rarely heavy-handed. Sorkin writes both appealing lead characters and secondary ones who are policy nerds, comic foils, or both.

Michael Douglas plays Andrew Shepherd, a widower President, which is unusual, and a bit awkward for him. He is serious about his job, but his dry wit and easy banter with his staff make him very engaging. When he meets environmental lobbyist Sydney Ellen Wade, played by Annette Bening, their chemistry is powerful and is what really propels the movie. Their first date is at a State Dinner, and allows them that first dance (depicted on DVD sleeves in real life), and on newspaper front pages in the movie. It sets the stage for the non-issue which becomes a very real one, that weaves its way throughout the last 2/3rds of the story.

""The President's got a girlfriend,"" sneers Sen. Bob Rumson, played with relish by Richard Dreyfuss. He is the presumptive Republican candidate who will face Shepherd when he runs for re-election. Rumson sets out to dig dirt on Ms. Wade. There isn't any, but politics is perception, and Rumson takes to the TV news shows to accuse Ms. Wade of treason and prostitution. President Shepherd, who up to now has been silent, noting that he doesn't have the luxury of losing his temper, has had enough. He crashes the daily press briefing to deliver a classic speech which allows him to admit his weaknesses, successfully refute Rumson's charges, and make a case for happiness in his personal life. He winds things up by being very presidential. Both Sorkin and director Rob Reiner excel at pulling off this kind of scene.

The movie wraps up as neatly as you might expect, but that's OK. The supporting cast is all excellent; Martin Sheen is the president's closest adviser, and would become the president on ""The West Wing."" Anna Devere Smith, Michael J. Fox, David Paymer, Samantha Mathis and John Mahoney among others, all lend very able support. The current rating for ""The American President"" at the IMDb is 6.7, which I believe is far too low for an intelligent comedy-drama, and might keep potential viewers from choosing to watch a movie they'd almost certainly enjoy.",1372118400,,2471,4.836879432624113

I would give it 3-1/2 stars, but Amazon doesn't seem to allow me to do that. The performances by the actors are quite good, with Annette Bening standing out (in my opinion). The jokes are cute and not over the top; this would make a good date movie.

Apparently Aaron Sorkin (the writer) couldn't stay with a plot that centered around the romance of a widowered President dating a woman that may have presented a conflict of interest with his bid for reelection.  But instead we see a political agenda of ""gun control"" and ""carbon emissions"" inserted into the script to promote the views of the writer and those that adhere to this line of thought.  The film ""Dave"" on the other hand was able to pull off the romance without burying it in the mire of political agendas, and this would include the agendas of either party.

If they had tried to bring too many politics or labors of the presidential office into the story, I doubt they could have pulled this off as well. But Reiner did a great job of bringing in just enough of the ""work"" side of the president's duties and still maintain the balance with the romance. Of course, like most films it's too far from reality to even be conceivable but that's okay, it's a movie. I think both Fox and Sheen played their parts great, especially when Fox has to come to the president with a dose of reality.

993272,4,6305132666,"I had very little interest in seeing this movie.  I'm just going to put that out there.  I have this thing about Michael Douglas (he's just somewhat uninteresting) and Annette Bening (overly theatrical and unnatural for the most part) and yet I was told by so many that this was such a great romantic comedy that I felt compelled to give it a go.

I really liked this!

Sure, some of the plot points were familiar, predictable and preposterous to a degree and yet it worked so well thanks to the sharp writing (Sorkin can write anything) and the devoted performances.  It isn't just Bening and Douglas who carry this film though.  The entire ensemble is delightful, with Martin Sheen delivering a standup supporting role that has so many layers and steals every scene.  I was particularly blown over by Douglas though, who takes on this role and gives it such life and honesty.  He's touching, tender, funny, charming and earnest and he makes it all look so light and natural.

The story itself needed serious help.  When you take a step back and look at it, it's rather dumb in concept.  The President, a widower who won his election thanks to the death of his wife (no one wants to smear the recently widowed) is up for re-election, and his competition is fierce (a seething Richard Dreyfuss).  When he makes the decision to woo a lobbyist, his staff goes into hyper drive trying their hardest to maintain their president's image and shield him from attack, but it's of no use and soon not only is he under attack, but the woman in his life is feeling the heat.

Of course, love always finds a way, and while the closing speech is overblown to the enth, Douglas sells it nicely.

Overall, I really, really liked this.  For what it is, it is above average, and that means a lot when you consider the amount of average and below average that comes out of this genre.  The cast, the dialog (so fresh, funny and sharp) and the general atmosphere (Reiner is considered a hack and sellout by many, but he has delivered quite a few great films) are all worthy of your attention.",1370304000,,2073,4.532258064516129

His defense of the ACLU, a flawed but generally admirable organization, is also spot on.

However, the movie is needlessly heavy handed.  The ""good"" positions are far too left of even the most liberal members of the Democratic Party.  Could you imagine a Democratic President saying that he would ""get the guns,"" that handguns need to be banned, or that conventional cars should be outlawed in 10 years?  The positions are just laughably extreme, as is the portrayal of Republicans as universally malevolent and meeting in smoke filled rooms.

I like the movie, both for the Rom Com aspect and drama, but I think Sorkin was being a mean-spirited in the way he targeted about half of the US population.  Why turn it into a manifesto?",1367366400,,938,4.682926829268292

Again, ""The American President"" and ""Dave"" are the perfect companions for White House antics.

Just because he is the ""President"", who is raising a daughter after the death of his wife, does not mean he can not or should not have a ""personal"" life.  Michael Douglas portrays President Sheppard who has values above and beyond of who we need as a leader.  Romance, sex, and real life are at the beginning and throughout this movie. With a approval rating of 63% before becoming romantically involved with Sydney Ellen Wade (Annette Bening). The press is all over them from every angle, and Sheppard's 63% approval rating is dropping like a rock. The romance in this story is sweet, but it takes second place for a crime bill and a reduction of fuels.

The political infighting, the lies, the mudslinging, the broken promises. If a real life portrayal was intended, it was, oh, about half as vicious as it really is in congress today.
Had to remind myself that I was reviewing a movie, it was that engrossing at times. Not like, ""Gosh, I just can't wait to see which lie is coming next"", but that it did give a sometimes accurate view into today's congressional intrigue.

Holding me back from a four star rating is the sanctimonious politics involved here; a significant plot device revolves around two pieces of legislation: one to cut carbon dioxide emissions by a drastic 20%, and the other called a ""crime bill"" to outlaw the possession of handguns.

993800,5,6305132666,"""The American President"" is one of the few comedies that actually made me laugh out loud -- and it's a rare comedy that can accomplish that. It will come as no surprise to fans of ""The West Wing"" that script credits for this film go to Aaron Sorkin. Just as in that series, clever and sophisticated humor abounds and Michael Douglas and Annette Bening make the most of their roles. Bening is at her most charming when she's flustered or caught off guard, yet she never appears foolish since the intelligence of her portrayal is always present. Douglas gives a winning performance as the Chief Executive, although it's hard to imagine a U.S. President that carefree and unruffled so much of the time.

Both are political movies that concentrate on the People rather than strictly about the issues and the actions taken. but much more than that is the way  the central characters  care about the people. The Pres. is a widower raising a teenage daughter and juggling the job/the daughter//the relationship/and his own time. This movie sets that conflict as a core part of the story. I love movies that are story- centered with well defined characters. Michael J  Fox  is wonderful. He is frantic most of the time; He is in motion, over-reacting,self-important, always sees the worst thing possible, and thinks he has everything under control but is fighting to keep his lapses hidden.

994064,5,6305132666,"Andrew Shepherd (Michael Douglas) is a widowed Democratic American president struggling to get two important Bills through Congress - one on a reduction in carbon emissions and another on gun control. Shepherd comes from Wisconsin and before too long will want to run for a second term of office. The `voice of the people' advising the president is his Chief-of-Staff, A.J. MacInerney (Martin Sheen), playing a role not vastly dissimilar to that he played as president in the West Wing TV series. The script for the film was written by Aaron Sorkin who also created West Wing. As an ardent environmentalist, Sydney Ellen Wade (Annette Bening) lobbies the president to press Congress for a 20% reduction in carbon emissions rather than a safer 10% reduction, which will be easier to get through. Then the president finds himself faced with a state dinner to welcome the President of France but without a dinner companion, as his previous partner is ill. Wade gets invited in her place and so the romance begins. Michael J. Fox is good as an annoying and over-enthusiastic Advisor on Domestic Policy, Lewis Rothschild; and Richard Dreyfuss is the appropriately sour Republican Senator Bob Rumson and Leader of the House.  I guess we could call this a romantic comedy and it's thoroughly entertaining. There is a lot of witty and extremely well-written dialogue and the characters are quite believable - which is why West Wing was also such a success.

994130,4,6305132666,"This is a very sweet movie, actually. Hard to believe about a president, but it's true. Why? Because these people are so human, and it's been a long time since we had any reason to expect that in the White House [review written in 2008].

President Andrew Shepherd (Michael Douglas) is a widower, and in fact has raised his 12-year-old daughter almost single-handedly. She's a bright, sensible, nice, but not particularly pretty child, so he must have gotten a few things right. Sydney Ellen Wade (Annette Bening) is a lobbyist for an important piece of environmental legislation. Conflicts of interest professionally do not stop them from a good bit of interest personally.

But as his chief of staff, A. J. MacIneney (Martin Sheen) points out, presidents do not just call a girl up for a date. Well, this one does. At first Sydney assumes it is an old friend of hers making a silly joke when she receives the call. So President Shepherd, thinking fast, tells her to hang up, call the phone number he gives her, which is the main switchboard at the White House. She does, and it is. The operator says, ""Oh, yes, Ms. Wade, the president is expecting your call. I'll put you right through.""

She can barely talk, and he doesn't really know what to say, either. After all, his secretary sets up his phone calls, and it's been a very long time since he asked a woman for a date. But he manages to convey that they are having a reception dinner at the White House the next night for the new French president, and he would like her to be his date.

Naturally, the press go bonkers. There are photos of the two of them dancing all over the front page of every newspaper in the country. And when his biggest opponent from the ""other party"" (party names are never mentioned), Robert Rumson (Richard Dreyfus) gets hold of this picture and the scandal he whips up, the president's approval rating in the poles plummets.

All his aids are in a panic the first time Sydney sleeps over at the White House. Lewis Rothschild (Michael J. Fox) is supposed to come up with statistics on the various polls, Leon Kodak (David Paymer) is trying to pin down support for the president's crime bill, and it's amusing to see how they assume this is going to ruin his chances for re-election on the ""character issue"" Rumson has cooked up.

My only question is why didn't he resolve the issue by asking her to marry him? His daughter likes her, Sydney likes the daughter, Andy and Sydney are clearly nuts about each other, so why? And why did none of his advisers mention the idea? And why, come to that, didn't his daughter? I kept expecting her to say something.

Maybe it was because the president viewed that as giving in to the gossips and ""character issue"" BS-slingers. And indeed, he handles the situation very well in the end.

How does he ask her on a date? How does he buy her flowers? Is his personal life a legitimate topic of inquiry for the press, or is it not?

This movie reminds us that, when you are in power, there are plenty of people who will pounce on anything you do in order to try to bring you down. The President of the US continues his relationship with his surreptitious girlfriend. (He is not cheating: He is a widower.) Nevertheless, rumors circulate. The budding relationship is complicated by the fact that he has a natural born daughter. Questions about the character of the President begin to circulate, and his poll numbers plummet from 63% approval to as low as 41%. He is losing his political muscle in terms of getting Congressmen to vote on important legislation that the President is supporting.

The ACLU is presented in a favorable fashion--as one that protects the Constitution. Flag-burning is portrayed as legitimate free speech. At first the President is ashamed to admit his association with the ACLU, and then he comes out strongly and publicly in favor of it.

For a long time, the President has faced incessant attacks. Then he goes on a spectacular offensive against his political opponents. And so it goes...",1309737600,2,1393,4.771784232365145

I did feel that the character of the love interest (Annette Bening) was a little flat and cliched, but certainly not enough to bring down the movie. After seeing this, I felt like I had just seen into the inner workings of the White House. (Untrue, as it is only Hollywood's portrayal, but it is certainly a mark of a good movie that I would come away feeling like that.) I also had an increased respect for my president. (I am American.) Regardless of political parties, it takes a certain character to have a job like that and not allow the country to fall into disarray.

The one thing I did notice in some of the other reviews was the fact that this movie had a political agenda and they gave it a low review for that. On this note, I have to say, ALL Hollywood movies have what you could call a ""political agenda"". They are written by someone who is comprised of certain views and of course it is going to show through in their work. It really doesn't matter as long as you are not the type of person who is easily swayed by what they watch/read. I wouldn't give it a low review just for that. :)",1303171200,,1199,4.3053097345132745

Too bad our country has been hijacked and the religious right have not only destroyed the infrastructure, they have also destroyed liberal help in restoring the constitution.  The constitution is based on liberty, but fascism has been the main course so long that liberals now ask how we win the war on drugs, instead of asking how to legalize drugs and stop wars.  The war on drugs is a failure.  Criminalizing anything presents problems.  When is prostitution the healthiest?  Where it is legal.  Drinking problems occur, prohibition made them infinitely worse.  How do we solve the war on drugs?  Legalize and tax them.  Take the crime out of the equation.  Gain tax revenue.  Learn healthier administration.  Stop people having to steal to gain access to drugs.  Stop over crowding of prisons.  Free up the legal system.  Stop drug dealers from having to kill.  Stop searches.  Stop undercover officers from risking their lives, etc..., etc...  Will drugs create problems?  Yes.  Will the problems be lessened ad infinitum?  Yes.  How do we solve the problem of second hand smoke.  Let owner's decide on smoking policies.  People that bought all the exaggerations and don't want to be bothered by second hand smoke can go to smoke free establishments.  People that don't care can go to smoking establishments.

994272,4,6305132666,"By casting Martin Sheen (eventually to play President Josiah Bartlett) as White House Chief of Staff to President Andrew Shepard played by Michael Douglas, Adam Sorkin perfectly presages his THE WEST WING in this intelligently written romantic comedy also starring Annette Bening. Although she isn't one of my favorite actresses she plays the role of Sydney Ellen Wade, environmental lobbyist and girlfriend to the widowed President, with panache.

This was one of my father's favorite films and he watched it every time it was on Cable, which is to say about eight hundred times. It was so ubiquitous on the family TV that I avoided it on purpose, which is a regret since it is very entertaining. Michael Douglas is very Presidential and his staff (including Michael J. Fox, who was to go on and star in SPIN CITY) bring a solidity to the film which makes it believable.

President Shepard meets Wade at a function, and eventually calls her after Sheen and everybody else reduces the idea of his dating any woman to a poll projection. ""You'll lose five points; at least,"" Sheen cautions. Douglas isn't deterred. At first Wade thinks the call is from a friend playing a practical joke, and tells the President, ""You have a cute @$$,"" but after a hilarious moment where he asks her to call him back in the Oval Office, the game is afoot. Their first kiss is interrupted when the President is called away to order a retaliatory strike on a warlike Libya.

Shepard loses more than five points. He loses about twenty-five, especially after the public is told that Wade has been spending nights at the White House. The staff go into battle mode, but Shepard, for his part, seems moon-eyed and oblivious to the criticism. ""How do you want to address the Sydney problem, sir?"" Fox asks him at one point, to which Douglas responds, ""When you say that you'd better mean a trade disagreement with Australia.""

The popular President's numbers continue to tumble, and key legislation is endangered as votes evaporate. The flames are fanned by Shepard's nemesis, Senator Bob ""I'm running for President"" Rumson, an arch-Conservative and leader of what might be the Tea Party. Richard Dreyfuss, who plays Rumson, might have been inspired by a study of Senator John McCain or perhaps McCain was inspired by a study of Dreyfuss in this role. Rumson is intelligent, knowledgeable, and politically powerful; he certainly believes in his cause. But Rumson, much like Sarah Palin, is a mean-spirited and vitriolic human being who courts votes by avoiding any real debate, and appealing to Family Values and The Flag. He spends an inordinate amount of time denigrating the ""First Mistress."" In his constant carping on negatives and his propensity for unbridled personal attacks, Rumson reduces everything to the lowest common denominator.

Shepard ignores Rumson to the point where his Presidency is at risk. No less at risk is his relationship with Sydney, which has blossomed into true love. Belatedly realizing that he must respond to what has become an overwhelmingly negative perception of himself as passive, Shepard comes out swinging in one of the best-written faux Presidential addresses ever filmed.

Although we don't see the result, the implication is that Shepard's forceful reason undoes Rumson. We are also left with the delightful prospect of a White House Wedding.

Although this is a romantic comedy, it has surprising depth and prescience in its handling of the declining state of American politics and the mindset of the electorate toward its leaders and toward what the nation truly stands for.",1294444800,2,3593,5.008375209380235

Don't know how I would have rewritten the final hour to make more palatible but then Sorkin/Reiner wouldn't have had their final version any other way. If they remade the movie today, no doubt they'd be defending ACORN as well, wasting trillions of our children's future on their version of health care, polluting the air space as thousands of lefties fly on their private jets to Copenhagen (much as Pelosi and her entourage have on the tax payers), and of course they'd cast Will Smith as the Andrew Shepard character (renamed Abdul Shepard).

994478,1,6305132666,"First I liked the movie.  If you like a romantic comedy then this is good one.  You must put aside any idea that it has any basis in reality.  It is the expected hollywood version of the US government.  If you are a liberal than you are heaven sent and if you are conservative than you are a hellbound devil who's only interest is destroying the country and starving children and old folk.  In this film, you have a ultr-liberal director and the only conservative voice in the film is a monster and played by Richard Dreyfuss who has never had a conservative thought.  So if you can get past the extreme bias in the film and not take it too seriously, you might enjoy it.  My rating is not about the movie, it is about the distribution of the DVD by Warner Brothers.  They have released three verions of the film....kind of.  The first version released ten years ago indicated the film was not in enhanced widescreen.  It had a poor image but was that was very common as DVDs were first coming to the marketplace.  The two followup releases have claimed to be ENHANCED FOR WIDESCREEN TV...BUT WERE NOT.  One version had an outer sleave that claimed this, but the actual case did not while the most recent version puts ENHANCED right on the disc insert.  Both of these version are the same old version previously released.  I would like to believe that this is a mistake, but it occurs too often for this to be true.  What is likely more accurate is the WB intentionally mislabels the disc packaging so that owners of the old disce will buy it again, and since once it is opened it cannot be returned....FRUAD profits for WB.

994541,5,6305132666,"This is a very pleasant romantic comedy, reminisent of the old Cary Grant screwball affairs, light on the sex & heavy on the budding relationship. This blending of film making elements, so prevalent during the golden age of movies, makes a 2 hr film seem far too short; whereas, today, most 2 hr films seem far too long. Douglas, the younger, & Sheen, Fox, etc. hold together like a fine tuned car for the pictures length. Also, good casting for the right love interest, not too old, or too young & of the right degree of sophistication.

The story line was very tastefully done, being that the subject(s) is/are the President of the USA & the White House. Of course a charming & youngish First Man of the Land would have to be a Democratic man of the people. The Oval Office romantic encounters made me think of other such factual affairs in this local & as I recall they also involed Democratic Presidents, so I guess that it is entirely fitting that this was also the case.

994548,1,6305132666,"A wonderful 5 star movie, so why would I give it only one star? Please let me enlighten you before you run out and buy it on DVD. I watched this movie for years on a VHS and adored it, it's one of my favs. more on that later, first you want to hear my warning. Now that I invested in a wonderful Plasma HDTV I found I needed the higher resolution DVDs and began replacing my entire 2000 movie collection. as another person who also tells you about the lousy DVD trasnfer said, it isn't anamorphic, and basicqally it means everything when you are talking about a great picture versus a lousy one with pixels showing, making every edge of everything constantly distracting with the way they seem alive, kind of reflective and moving,,, but we don't want the edge of the desk to move. they don't move in real life, they are hard straight edges of hard wood. in an ANAMORPHIC transfer the edges are crisp and clear and everything is beautiful, even a delivery truck on a street is actually fun to look at because its so darn clear and amazing to see! the faces of the actors are made ugly, litterally. I am not exaggerating. faces are so pixelated its completely distracting! The people becomd tiny due to the overly wide format, but you cant click your zoom to get closer because that just shows the bad effect even more pronounced! it sucks! I kid you not! so, seeing this and being made so upset here's what I did; I plugged in my VCR AND my DVD player,,,, mind you I use an OPPO which i also bought here on Amazon, so you know I was getting more from the DVD than it actually has to offer,,, they optomize the resolution,,, but even with it's help the VHS actually was better to watch, more enjoyable, clearer, closer larger faces, just plain more fun to watch.  I just paid $11 for a used DVD in mint condition through Amazon's used movie section and ended up watching it on my old VHS. WOW!~~! when given the choice I actually watched the entire movie from my old VHS and put the DVD BACK ON THE SHELF!  I hope you are hearing me folks because its the truth.  I wasted every penny I'd spent on the DVD. now just so you know i'm not just full of bad beans,,, of my 2000 movies I own, only this one DVD actually sucks like this.  There are older movies that aren't anamorphic either that were put out on DVD that I also bought and played and though they also aren't high resolution, they weren't all pixelated like this one is and they were still enjoyable and very watchable.  only this one is of such a poor video transfer that I had to write all this about it, only this one!! and thats the truth!!!  Do yourself a favor if you haven't seen this movie yet, buy it, but not on DVD. Go buy a cheap priced VHS on ebay for $1 usually (plus shipping) its cheap because so many were sold due to its so good. but wait to buy it on DVD until they fix this awful crime. they really screwed us over with this crapola low quality DVD,,, its as if they got it directly from a VHS and stretched it to fit the larger screens without giving it the additional resolution to make it look as good. SOoooooo,,, the only way to get them to fix crimes like this, is if everyone will give it a one star rating until they fix the problem, and apologize for screwing us of our money,,, its so bad they should send a new DVD to anyone sending in an old crappy version, the one now available! I hope you take me seriously, if I could I would mail you both my DVD and my VHS so you can see for yourself. I bet you could even tell the difference if I took pics of the movie on pause at the exact same part in the movie and had you all compare them.  I am so dissappointed I cant watch this great movie any more, until they undo the damage and re-make it. it just sucks I will have to buy it a third time, there should be a law against this kind of junk happening to us, aren't we American citizens? don't we deserve better? a seperate agency from the movie industry should police these DVDs and give them a 1-5 rating of the DVD transfer so people could avoid ones like this, and this one is the worst one there is. Amazingly I read online where it doesnt really cost them hardly any more money to produce a movie anamorphically, its just a different setting on the equipment when they do it. really makes you wonder how ANY movie is sold if it isn't anamorphic. the highly informative story I read online compared it to the ""GOOD HOUSE-KEEPING SEAL OF APPROVAL"" on an apliance, the way it was in the old days, you would remember this if you are old enough. I'm 53 so I know how we used to look to see that tag on the cord before we bought the junky one that was going to spark and not work a week later. Also amazingly, I have old movie made many years ago that are anamorphic and they look fabulous! How could they ruin a great movie like this one???? and no one does anything about it???  I would think Michael Douglas and Annette Bening would be pounding on doors shouting at the people responsible and make them fix it. does anyone have Michael's phone number?  ummm, maybe you better send me Annette's number instead, she is soooo dreamy, lol.

994627,5,6305132666,"In the world of romantic comedies this is one of my personal favorites, ranking along side such modern classics as ""You've Got Mail"" and ""Pretty Woman"". (Yes I own all three.) It's been available on DVD for some time, and chances are you've seen it on TV. If it is new to you, then read on. The story is unusual in that it revolves around a widowed President, his pre-teen daughter and an antagonistic lobbyist to whom he's attracted. The dialog is smart, witty and  funny, and the chemistry between all the principle actors is very evident. If the opening theme music and some of the players seem familiar, it's because the film was made and produced by the same people who went on to do the Emmy-winning TV series ""The West Wing"". (With Martin Sheen advancing from Presidential Advisor here, to the Presidency itself.) The workings of the White House, the serious decisions that have to be made, and the travails of a re-election campaign all provide an authentic backdrop to the tale of romance that is the real heart of the film. I don't want to spoil the fun of the ins and outs of the love story as it unfolds, so instead offer up a few of my favorite lines:

""This is the White House...yes the President is expecting your call.""
""Tell her she has nice shoes, women like that.""
""No Sydney, 200 pairs of eyes are not on me, they are on you...""
""Oh, hi Sydney... Good morning Sydney...Hi Sydney...""

It's amazing really. I never think about the personal life of our President.

As this is a romance there is a equally focused and idealistic love interest played by Annette Benning who does not water down her character or make her a simpering trophy wife.

The rest of the cast is wonderful too...Michael J. Fox, Martin Sheen and the rest of the President's ""staff"" are admirable, familiar characters in this nicely written script.

This interesting, well-acted, and sometimes comical movie can be technically summed up as follows:

(1) The President of the United States Andrew Shepherd (Michael Douglas) who is widowed with a daughter has a popularity rating in an election year of 63%.

(2) He gets a girlfriend, political strategist Sydney Ellen Wade (Annette Bening).  As a result, his popularity rating decreases in seven weeks to 41%.

(3) Despite his now low popularity rating, the President continues with the relationship.

Besides the romantic relationship that develops, we see the President's hard-working staff members (two of which are the chief of staff {Martin Sheen} and the senior domestic policy advisor {Michael J. Fox}), a senator (Richard Dreyfuss) who desperately wants the top job, state dinners, former protocol, informal moments, and global crises.

The acting throughout is in a word: fantastic.  Kudos to Michael Douglas, Annette Bening, and Martin Sheen who, I felt, give above-average performances.  (This may have been Sheen's audition role for the popular TV series ""The West Wing."")  Michael J. Fox also gives a fine performance.

This movie is well filmed.  The background music I heard was classical, ballet, and even some Rogers & Hammerstein.

Some people may focus too much on the liberal politics presented in this movie.  This is a mistake.  The idea is to show how a romantic relationship can possibly fit into the grueling schedule of a President.  It explores the balance between private romance and public Presidency.

Finally, the DVD (the one released in 1999) is perfect in picture and sound quality.  It has minimal extras.

In conclusion, this movie is a romantic comedy and dramatic gem that attempts to answer a unique question:  what would happen if an unattached President got a girlfriend??

The creator of West Wing, Sports Nite, and Studio 60 really demonstrates in this movie what it means to write a script that conveys not only words but all the emotions and nuances behind the words.

Aaron Sorkin has to be the best ever at gettng the viewer completely absorbed in his screen plays.  Look at West Wing's first three years versus the rest of the series...night and day.  The last years were good, don't get me wrong, but those first three years, written by Sorkin, just pulled me in and kept me wishing for the next episode.

In The American President the final news conference speech alone is worth the price of admission.  That scene and the scene from the West Wing when the President reminds the target of his conversation that ""when the President stands, no one sits."" (You WW aficionadoes will know what I'm talking about.) Those two scenes are among the best screenplay writing ever.

994708,2,6305132666,"With top acting, directing and production values, it's a shame Rob Reiner and his writer put liberal posturing over all else in The American President.  Instead of providing Douglas with a worthly conservative foe, the lazy script practically puts a big ""S"" on Douglas' chest while presenting the Richard Dreyfuss character (of course the only conservative in the movie) as a shallow, manipulative bully.  The nadir of the movie, though, is when Douglas' character utters the line about american voters that they will drink sand in the desert ""...because they don't know the difference.""  So there, Reiner and writer Sorkin think the average american voter in an imbecile--just what you would expect from the unfettered narcissism of Hollywood.

So, does the movie work?  As a romantic comedy, it skates by on the undeniable charisma and chemistry of the leads.  And no one said Reiner wasn't a slick director, moving his movie along at a brisk pace.  If you have a liberal bent, you'll probably love this movie beyond question.

994709,2,6305132666,"When I saw this film, it was so obvious that Michael Douglas's character was based on Bill Clinton, and Richard Dreyfus's character was Bob Dole.  Its essential message was the President is a good guy, he's doing his best, and we should give him a break.  Then Dreyfus, playing Bob Dole, attacked him for his ""morals"" (which the Republicans have none) because he had a girlfriend and she burned a flag at a protest in her youth.  Dreyfus continually trashes Douglas until he finally stands up to him, and then everything is fine.  The film ended up being a very preachy film, even though it was something I generally agree with (I did vote for Clinton, though not with great enthusiasm).  I don't like when films preach.  They never get their message across.  They all end up very heavy handed.  The film is rather naive and simplistic, but that isn't surprising, consider Aaron Sorkin wrote it (The West Wing is a horrible show, too naive and idealistic).  Michael Douglas's character in real life would have sat there and ""would have waited for it to blow over"" (like John Kerry did when his patriotism was attacked in 2004), but as Kerry will attest to, this doesn't work.  It doesn't matter if Clinton (or any other president) is a ""good guy"" doing his best.  It depends on whether his best is good enough.  This film reduces politics to silliness, and while it would be nice if politics were this easy, it isn't, and we shouldn't pretend that it is.",1164844800,2,1454,4.614785992217898

This DVD was originally supposed to have a new anamorphic widescreen version on it, but I guess they changed their minds.  I have a feeling they intended to release a good version of this movie (anamorphic, etc.), but then decided not to for some reason.  Instead of cancelling the release (which is what they should have done), I guess they said ""Hey, we have tons of old stock in inventory.  Maybe we can repackage it with some gimmick like a Mother's Day card.""

Honestly, I don't even think they make snap cases anymore.  I haven't seen a new release with a snap case in 2-3 years.  I also haven't seen any movie releases that don't have an anamorphic version in a couple years either.  This has to be old stock.

Sometimes I really hate Warner Brothers.  I initially hated them because of the snap cases that they littered our collections with, now they sell old stock to fans that have been waiting years for an anamorphic version of this movie.

The movie is great.  Maybe someday they will do it justice with a decent DVD release.

This is a smart movie and I like smart movies. The dialog is what makes this movie work and the casting is perfect. Yes this is a liberal movie and I amd a conservative republican. Nothing in this movie came close to changing my political stance, on the contrary it was so blaitent it was funny. But the love story is good, the story flows well from beginning to end, and the politics of the office are exposed an interesting. The only thing I would have hoped for is they didn't jump into the sack so easily. It also never made sense to me that the American public would turn against a president who had lost his wife and was finding a new companion after a sufficient waiting period. In fact I think the president's ratings would actually improve, but that wouldn't have lent itself to the story line so I accept this twist.

Directors can make or break a movie. Rob Reiner is one of the best directors in the business in my opinion. May he stay a director and out of politics forever!",1136332800,7,1122,4.415458937198068

Cast:  Michael Douglas, Annette Bening, Martin Sheen, Michael J. Fox, Anna Deavere Smith, Samantha Mathis, Shawna Waldron, David Paymer, Richard Dreyfuss.

Running Time:  114 minutes

Rated PG-13 for some strong language.

Rob Reiner's `The American President', is a refreshing look at the controversial and sometimes boring subject of politics. This movie also does more. It has a wonderful love story, with a very comedic feel, which is different to other romantic movies I have seen. I am sure that being `The President of the United States' is arduous task at the best of times. However this film gives a much different look at what it means to be the US president, in the public eye and in private as well.

When US President Andrew Shepherd, quite unexpectedly, falls in love with Sydney Ellen Wade, an environmental lobbyist, he must overcome obstacles not faced by average citizens; he must worry that the public's right to know will collide with the desire for personal privacy. Political crises are different than personal ones and somehow the American President alone must find a way to balance time to do his job, for the love of his country with his love for an incredible woman.  It is obvious that this movie's main stars, that being Andrew Shepherd (Michael Douglas) and Sydney Ellen Wade (Annette Benning), steal most of the limelight. There roles as politicians are so believable, it allows them to do so.  The film, with its continuous delightful humor and charm, manages to make light of relatively simple tasks for normal human beings who are not the president, such buying flowers or calling up a girl for a date, buth are thoroughly difficult for the Commander in Chief.

The screenplay was well written for this movie by Aaron Sorkin, who does a stupendous job interwining the political tension amongst Shepherd and his nearest competitor (Richard Dreyfuss) and the relationship tension that occurs between the president and Wade.  The supporting cast for Douglas and Benning in `The American President' is first-class. A.J MacInerney (Martin Sheen) is the president's right-hand man, Lewis Rothschild (Michael J. Fox) is the president's conscience, with a brilliant scene of retaliating remarks between Douglas and Fox close to the end of the movie, Robin McCall (Anna Deavere Smith) is the press secretary, Leon Kodak (David Paymer) is his pollster and Janie Basdin (Samantha Mathis) is his personal secretary. I also enjoyed the role of the president's daughter `Lucy' (well played by Shawna Waldron). Her character had wisdom that her Father needed and was a good change to see from time to time.

The political feel this film had was also a highlight, handling such issues as the environment via Sydney's character and gun control through the president character in the most professional way. The final speech of the president's, is an extremely powerful moment and one that shows a commanding presence from Douglas as the lead.  Directed flawlessly by Reinter, ""The American President"" is a romantic comedy that takes us away from the political corruption that surrounds our world and reminds us of the genuine good in people; even the president.  If you want to see a good night's entertainment, then `The American President' is the movie just for you.  Funny, heartwarming, beautifully acted, and splendidly executed.",1135814400,7,3372,5.114754098360656
994843,5,6305132666,"Before Aaron Sorkin brought us THE WEST WING on TV, he scripted this wonderfully evocative script.  Under Rob Reiner's astute direction, THE AMERICAN PRESIDENT is marvelous entertainment, a chick flick to be sure, but still a film that anyone can enjoy.  Michael Douglas gives one of his finest performances as the President, a widower with a conscience and a sense of humor.  He falls for an environmental lobbyist, played with skill and finesse by a radiant Annette Bening.  His character is attacked by an uncredited Richard Dreyfuss who plans to use this relationship to defeat Douglas in the upcoming election.  Without the talent of creator Sorkin and the director/cast, this could have been a treacly maudln mismash.  But it's oh so good.  Helping out is the tremendous supporting cast:  Martin Sheen, Michael J. Fox (who is brilliant); Samantha Mathis.  They all come together to make THE AMERICAN PRESIDENT a truly regal experience.",1130457600,3,941,5.1381578947368425
994844,4,6305132666,"Before the successful run of the series 'West Wing', Aaron Sorkin created another presidential drama for the big screen, entitled 'The American President' (the film co-stars Martin Sheen, who would go on to be the president, Josiah Bartlett, in the television series). This is one of the first fictional accounts of life in the White House to concentrate more on the private lives of the people who work there, particularly the president, more than the politics or policies that make up the work of the place. (I like to pair this film for viewing with 'Dave', a comedy starring Kevin Kline who stands in for a president who had a stroke; this also deals in a different way with the private lives of those in the White House.)

This film is very well done in terms of detail; the sets for the White House are incredible, and the footage for placing shots taken around the actual White House and around Washington are truly remarkable. The Oval Office set was constructed for the film 'Dave', and is also the one that continues to be used on the West Wing, along with other sets. A bit of trivia: When Shepherd first calls Wade to ask her out on a date, she doesn't believe him, and hangs up the phone. When Shepherd rang back, he gave Wade a number to call him back - 456-1414 - which is in fact the number to the White House switchboard (with a D.C. area code 202).

Also, for a film that doesn't concentrate on the issues of policy, the backdrop of the policy struggles are also very interesting to watch. For such dramas, policy issues must necessarily be bare-bones in terms of presentation, but one does get a sense of the politics involved when the president has to make a tough choice between two favoured projects as to which one is going to get his support. In the end (and I'm not giving away the ending, because it remains unresolved) President Shepherd does come to support both projects, but this is intended as a more feel-good move to set the film on a course of idealism and principle winning out over politics - in other words, a Hollywood ending.

President Shepherd is a liberal president, but quite distinct from being a copy of Clinton. We get the sense that character debates for Clinton are being played out by writer Aaron Sorkin and producer/director Rob Reiner (one of the leading directors in Hollywood), but they don't quite match, given the different personal situations for Shepherd and Clinton. Shepherd is a widower, whose wife died during the campaign. He has a high-school aged daughter, played by Shawna Waldron (who is remarkably well-adjusted for being someone who both lost her mother and being a politician's child), and tries to navigate the difficulties of being a single parent and president at the same time.

Enter into the scene, rather near the president's first term of office, Sydney Ellen Wade (played by Annette Bening). Wade is a professional lobbyist (who, we find out later, makes more money than the president - this is not unusual in politics) hired to bolster the environmental lobby's efforts to pass major legislation. Wade is an attractive, single lady used to the rough-and-tumble of politics, although occasionally seems a bit nave, as does Shepherd, as their relationship deepens and the press papparazi begin to circle. Her appearance on the scene knocks Shepherd out of his complacency, and he begins a courtship that is in full view of the world press, as well as the conservative challengers to the election, that is happening in one year's time.

Michael Douglas plays the role of the president with panache but also with a bit of imperiousness; perhaps this cannot be avoided by anyone who wants such an august role, (in real life or in acting) but there is a tension between the idea of the liberal, for-the-people president who then also acts in a rather elitist and condescending manner. Douglas's main opponent politically is Senator Bob Rumson (doubtlessly a character drawn from the public image of Bob Dole), who is presented in a very monochromatic way (the complexity of the conservative side would be shown in Sorkin's series, 'The West Wing' in more detail, but still suffers from bias). Richard Dreyfuss plays this role well, but is prevented from developing this character as much more than a nemesis both by the writing and the on-screen time constraints.

Martin Sheen plays Andrew Shepherd's chief of staff, A.J. MacInerney (it would have been a nice touch if MacInerney would have been the president, rather than Bartlett, for 'The West Wing'). Sheen's role is well-done, but again we see more of the personal rather than the political here - MacInerney is Shepherd's best friend in here, rather than being chief of staff. Another major role went to Michael J. Fox, who as Lewis Rothschild was really playing the character of George Stephanopoulos. Also starring is Anna Deavere Smith as press secretary (she will also go on to 'The West Wing' as National Security Advisor, the role Condaleeza Rice had prior to becoming Secretary of State.

This is a polished film, very well done, with lots of details and a nice romantic story. It is biased in the liberal direction - many Republican friends I know like the film, but I have yet to find one who loves it. For Sorkin, this is the kind of liberal president that he'd like to have (and Bartlett on 'The West Wing' is a further extension of that), but reality rarely lives up to such ideals in any direction.

A well-done film, with minor flaws, but good appeal.",1130371200,,5496,4.765756302521009

The title of my review says it all in a nutshell.  If you're looking for Air Force One, Executive Decision or Thirteen Days, the buck does not stop here.  This movie is a fairy tale.  Think Ivan Reitman's ""Dave.""  That movie starts with the Subtitle ""Once Upon a Time.""  Exactly.  It's Boy meets girl on a grand scale.

Richard Dreyfuss plays an exquisitely delicious villan, using President Shephard's new found love of Sydney Ellen Wade, for his own political gain.

Martin Sheen as Chief of Staff AJ MacInerney, now best known as President Josiah Bartlet on the West Wing, seems to be a fore-runner for the President Bartlet's own COS Leo McGarry (After all Aaron Sorkin [who is GOD] did write this movie and the series West Wing).  Sheen is brilliant as Douglas' conscience and confidant.

Michael J Fox' character, Lewis Rothschild, and  David Paymer's Leon Kodak, are Shephard's Prism.  They show Shephard in Black and White, with no punches pulled, where he's at, where he's going and how to get there.

A romantic, political comedy this movie provides us with great pleasure while watching events unfold.

 In The American President there are numerous well known actors that play extraordinary roles. Michael Douglas, Annette Bening, Martin Sheen, Michael J. Fox, Samantha Mathis and Richard Dreyfuss round out the main characters in the film. Other prominent actors included in the film are Anna Deavere Smith, and David Paymer.

 Each of these actors looked like they felt extremely comfortable with their roles. According to Liz an Old Dominion student, ""The actors just looked like they fit into their characters. They way they acted and spoke made me really think that could play these people in real life. Sydney Ellen Wade would have to be one of the characters. She played into her role and really gave an insight to how political lobbyists operate."" Bridget a George Mason student said ""This movie was so charming and romantic. The actors were absolutely stupendous and I think that they did an outstanding job portraying their characters, especially Michael Douglas playing the President. He was charismatic and showed that his acting skills range from an action figure to President of the United States.""

To include a brief synopsis, widowed President Andrew Shepard (Michael Douglas), meets an environmental lobbyist named Sydney Ellen Wade (Annette Bening). They have a confrontation over a bill that Sydney wants passed, which is a 20% reduction in the admission of fossil fuels. The President disagrees with the bill but says if she can get 24 votes by the State of the Union he will support her bill, there is another little argument before she leaves his office and something quite humorous occurs. After the confrontation he invites her to State Dinner where they really being to hit things off. She comes over for dinner the next night and they have a romantic moment beginning their romance. Meanwhile since this movie is taking place during an election year we have the political opponent, Bob Rumson (Richard Dreyfuss), who would do anything in his power to beat President Shepard. Especially if this means that he will attack the President's character and his relationship with Sydney. He goes on television and begins to say horrible comments about her. During this time the President is also trying to support a bill of his own, the Crime Bill. Due to the relationship between the he and Sydney things begin to heat up when he has to choose between the two bills. The President finally makes a decision at a press conference which is also a heartfelt speech that he gives to the American people about his life. At the end of the movie we see the President walking into the chamber of Congress to deliver his State of the Union.

 I would recommend The American President to anyone who enjoys a romantic political comedy. I feel the actors did an outstanding job and the plot was charming. Rachel a student at Radford University said, ""Yes, I would recommend this movie to others. It was a good movie if you are into that romantic, political type."" Liz and Rachel both agreed that men will also like this movie because it is not really a ""chick flick"" but more a movie that all can enjoy. If you like this movie and you would like to watch more movies related to presidential romance and politics I would recommend Dave and Air Force One.

994931,4,6305132666,"Nominated for an Academy Award for Best Music, The American President should have been considered for other Oscars as well (maybe even Best Picture, although I realize it's not the great drama of the century). Nevertheless, The American President is a fun romantic comedy reminiscent of the old Frank Capra movies. Although not handled with kid gloves, the president comes across as fairly shy and innocent in his relationship with a Washington lobbyist, creating a charming contrast considering the power of his office. Released in 1995, The American President is one of a number of mainstream movies favorably focused on the presidency, with Dave and Air Force One leading the list (did liberal Hollywood producers hope some of the favorable light would rub off on Clinton?) That's debatable. But what's not debatable is that The American President is one of the best romantic comedies of the decade...

Michael Douglas plays the role of Andrew Shepard, widower and President of the United States. In the political world, Shepard is king - enjoying unprecedented highs in his job approval rating. But the president's private world is empty. The president's daughter is the only close person in his personal life, and he greatly misses his wife. Following an environmental policy meeting with Washington lobbyist Sydney Ellen Wade (Annette Bening), Shepard considers asking her out. But he takes advice from aides A.J. MacInerney (Martin Sheen) and Lewis Rothschild (Michael J. Fox) en route to making his decision.

When the president does arrange a date with Sydney, her presence at the White House is leaked to the media, and the president's approval rating falls (I'm not exactly sure why, seeing as how the American public would have to be totally deranged to forbid a widower from dating). The growing scandal is further compounded by opposition leader Senator Bob Rumson (Richard Dreyfuss) who uses the scandal as a launching pad for his own campaign to win the presidency. Will the good guys win, or will the evil Rumson take down the president?

The plot structure of The American President is nothing new, and the screenplay itself is far from masterful. But what makes this film so successful is the way in which the cast breathes life into the dialogue. Michael Douglas, as President Andrew Shepard, shows the audience why he is a Hollywood titan. His presidential demeanor is a West Wing prelude which should make Martin Sheen proud, yet his interaction with Sydney Ellen Wade and his daughter Lucy (Shawna Waldron) paint a human picture of a tough political character. The other half of the equation, Annette Bening, plays her role to perfection as well, transforming from the rough political creature of a hard-nosed Washington lobbyist to a giggly school girl swept off her feet by a great guy (who, incidentally, happens to be the president).

One of the more interesting aspects of The American President is that the screenwriters made Andrew Shepard a widower and not a divorcee. Despite the overall acceptance of divorce in current society, the film wouldn't have worked if the president were divorced. Subconsciously, it would implant an idea in some members of the audience that he's a dog. That's an interesting footnote in my opinion. Also of further note are the appearances of Michael J. Fox (who later starred as a political operative in the TV series Spin City) and Martin Sheen (who later starred as the president in the TV series West Wing). Did The American President peak their interest in such roles, or were they already pursuing those types of roles? Either way, The American President will delight and entertain audiences of all ages, and that's why it's a definite must-see movie...

994932,4,6305132666,"Politcally slick, but immensely enjoyable, more so than its more serious and less romantic version - ""The Contender"". In this flick, Michael Douglas plays Andy Schepard, Hollywood's version of the perfect president - a center-left people-pleaser who doesn't let his Stanford education (under a nobel-prize winning economist) or his perfect grades get between him and the soul of the American people. The movie starts off with his presidency on a high note - with the state of the union address in the offing, Schepard's enjoying unprecedented approval ratings, and we can immediately sense why - he's smart and surrounds himself with a staff of fast talking, fast thinking wiseguys.  A widower, Schepard he falls for Sydney Ellen Wade (Annette Benning), a shark of a consultant who works for a DC-based lobby committed to environmental protection. Mixing politics and pleasure, Schepard courts Wade even as he pushes for Congress to pass groundbreaking legislation Wade's lobby has been seeking for years. The president's foes (arch conservatives in the fatcat mold) seize on the affair as a way to take down the popular President and the liberal causes.  Conscious but apathetic to the minds of Americans who don't approve of the widowed Chief's extra-marrital romancing (of a liberal, no less), the all-too decent Schepard remains silent about his relationship, determined not to let the business of statesmanship become bogged down by meaningless debates about ""character"" - even as both become touch-stones of the vile neo-conservative Bob Rumson (Richard Dreyfuss, in a thankless role). Although the script plays up the idea that the president's private life is his own, it also blurs the lines between Schepard's and Wade's two relationships (lovers on the one hand, president-to-lobbyist on the other) making it impossible to separate the Chief's private life with his public existence and compounding the problem by having Schepard propose a complex deal with Benning under which he will push for her environmental protection bill if she can guarantee enough support for it. Schepard is under pressure to pass his own pet-bill, a deceptively revolutionary anti-crime package, but figures that he can sell Congress on his bill and Sydney's if she can guarantee enough support for her own. When Schepard's romance so erodes his popularity that he'd be hard-pressed to pass either bill alone (even when Sydney fullfills her half of the deal, and signs on a hated triumvirate of auto-industry pols behind her environmental bill), the President finds himself in a deep dilemma that touches on his love for Wade and his duty to his office.

Liberal wish fulfillment? Not a doubt. The film is also incredibly disengenuous - positing Rumson at the center of a bunch of fatcat republicans who sip brandy while considering the unprincipled ends to which they will use Wade against Schepard, as if they had nothing more appropriate to use against him.  (The film summarily dismisses Rumson and fellow right-wingers as backward political hacks who go for the jugular and base their popularity on the votes of older nostalgic Americans.) The biggest cheat is Schepard's staunch unwillingness to confront the vile Bob Rumson directly on the ""character"" issue. ""American"" is a film about politicians, but it's not really all that political - it touches on issues like fossil-fuel emissions, flag burning  and Uzis bought by 8 year olds not so much to deal with them as to remind us where each of the characters stood.  Since the film is largely if surprisingly apolitical the character issue is pretty much the only real nugget the script has. By keeping Schepard silent on that subject until the end of the movie, the script saves both sides the trouble of really tearing to pieces the question of whether a president can sleep with the proponents of legislation pending in Congress without raising a few well-reasoned doubts. By then, there's only one side given adequate time to really deal with that question (which one, you ask?)  Instead, the script's GOP, the brandy-sipping fatcats, never utter a word about gun-control, abortion, church-state separation, corporate welfare or the environment - something even liberals can't believe. While Schepard prefers to ignore ""the character issue"", the script immediately hits upon it - sure to remind us of his top-flight education (his ""Stepford Child"" grades), his integrity, his honest-to-goodness honesty and how much everybody seems to like him. All of our heroes are smart and funny, and even the slings and arrows of political misfortune just roll of their backs.

If the movie rises above its lefty addictions for even this right-wing fundamentalist, it's because it's west-wing wish fulfillment is pretty much unconcealed. Think of this flick as a liberal version of ""Red Dawn"" - a movie that doesn't so much change people's minds as reinforce what their minds were. Gun-control liberals can sit through that flick because they know going in that it's about a bunch of rural farm kids with guns staring down the Red Army; - ditto in ""President"" for card-carrying NRA members who get pretty much what they expected, politically speaking in any event. The clever repartee of its characters (especially David Paymer and Michael J. Fox as his consultants - one being fearless, the other seeing portents of doom everywhere) keeps the film from getting to heavy and messagey. Nor could the story be dismissed as apologia for the Lewinsky affair - with Wade's position as a lobbyist making her relationship with Schepard look more questionable (not less) than ""Monica-gate"". Schepard is no Bill Clinton, Sydney Ellen Wade is no Monica. In short, this is a flick even Bob Rumson can enjoy.",1110499200,2,5733,5.156989247311828
994933,2,6305132666,"When I saw this movie for the first time, I enjoyed some parts for great acting and writing and winsome characters.  However, as for its politics, the film's mischaracterizations, political straw men, distortions and outright lies left me extremely frustrated.  One small example: the ACLU is not ""an organization dedicated to defending the Bill of Rights"" as President Shephard claims at the end of the movie.  When was the last time the ACLU came out to defend the second amendment, or the ninth, or tenth?

Some people say that you have to separate this film's politics from the romantic comedy aspect.  Why?  Aaron Sorkin clearly intended it to be a political tract, allbeit gift wrapped and tied with a bow; he clearly didn't intend for it just to be another romantic comedy about, oh, two competing shopkeepers on the Upper West Side.  He had a point to make, he made it, and his film should be taken as such.

I've heard that TAP became the blue print for the West Wing, which makes sense.  It doesn't take a shroom trip to make the connection between the two.  What can you say about TAP as opposed to WW?  Well, the lighting's better.  The tone is lighter.  The president is portrayed by less of a freak.  I think.

I know conservatives who badmouth TAP, based on its obvious pro-liberal slant and shilling for Clinton, who was president at the time (of course, Clinton was married, while the fictitious Shephard was a widower, but liberals never let marital status stand in the way of romance).  There's something to be said for that angle, but in retrospect I think that conservatives should be more generous to the film.  Particularly as it relates to gun control, this movie and countless TV shows helped ossify the liberal thinking about guns, which more than any other factor lost West Virginia for Gore in 2000, which... well, you remember.",1107734400,3,1856,4.73208722741433
994934,4,6305132666,"The American President is a wonderfully enjoyable film that conducts itself with style, verve and the grace of assured comedic narrative. Michael Douglas is commanding and presidential and Annette Bening is smart and charming. And the placement of the unavoidably naive and adolescent ploddings of romance against the stark and rigid world of politics is extremely amusing. However. . .

In the words of Dorothy Parker, many of the other reviews on this site for The American President should not be taken lightly -- they should be thrown away with great force.

Despite the fire and brimstone preachings of high school students and the other provincial minions that you might read here, maybe you should just see this movie and decide for yourself.

The essential problem is that all of these reviews apparently are igorant of the draught of intelligent comedies that plagues the American film industry. Here we have an intelligent comedy with smart characters and -- god forbid -- witty banter.

Is it idealistic? Yes. Is it politically slanted? Yes. Will anyone who watches it run the risk of being brainwashed? Not unless they have the resilience of a bowl of pudding. For anyone who is petrified of Superbowl halftime shows and SpongeBob Squarepants, maybe you shouldn't venture into such adult territory. (Mind you that the only poorly enforced stipulation of this site to post reviews is to click on a box to ensure that you are, in fact, over the age of 13.) No one single film is going to be able to satisfy a large -- and divided -- audience merely on the terms of political rigamarole. As one reviewer said in a more limited and political fashion, maybe we should judge the human story here and not the political one: A man who conducts himself with dignity and strength, who is looking to find love and happiness amid the societal mess of conflicts of interest and judgement.

If you can think for yourself and you would like an alternative to movies glutted with scatalogical humor, junevile sexual antics and cartoon sensibilities, then watch this film. For anyone who enjoys The West Wing, Sports Night or comedies that involve thought and the love of language and repartee, you'll find an enjoyable couple of hours with this movie.

And the other reviewers on this site should perhaps look beyond the limits of their political agendas, which have obviously tainted their opinions of this film. I'm sure your energies would be much better spent on attacking SpongBob.",1106784000,4,2482,4.911694510739856
994935,1,6305132666,"My mother and I have a certain few chick flicks that, no matter what, whenever on is on TV we will stop and watch it.  The American President was one of them.  I must have seen it twenty times.  We loved it, and I considered it a truly great movie.

... then I grew up.  We watched it in my government class because our teacher was sick, and I noticed with horror... that this guy, the man we're supposed to be rooting for, is a Democrat!  He defends ACLU, he is for ""gun control,"" he cavorts around with environmental lobbyists!  How can I root for someone who stands against all of my core beliefs?  Then, not only that, the guy who shares MY beliefs, the Republican, is totally demonized.  He is old and stodgy and Michael Douglas constantly makes fun of him.  Which, I guess looking back, is the good ol' liberal way of handling people who know what they're talking about.

And THEN there's the romance.  Now, okay, widower President dating is one thing.  But President putting off going to stop an airline strike to go buy flowers for his girlfriend?  President not doing ANYTHING to assure the public that their relationship would not affect anything he did?  President NEVER giving ANY addresses whatsoever, not even when freaking bombing Libya?  And not only this, but the girl he is seeing is a LOBBYIST (environmental too, BLECH).  Whenever his cabinet members were discussing important matters, all he would ask is things like ""Do you think she likes me?""  He was more concerned with this hot redhead than matters of state.  Mr. President, what you do behind closed doors is your own business, but when you let it get you distracted when you are the leader of our FREAKING COUNTRY it gets a little out of hand.  Oh, and this girl burned the flag once.  Y'know, the American flag.  And Mr. Democrat President DEFENDS her.  We're supposed to sympathize with them.  I can't.  I tried, but I can't.  We're supposed to be like ""OMG THOSE EVIL REPUBLICANS!  Yeah, why AREN'T you a member of the ACLU?  And why WON'T you support this ban on fossil fuels?  And WHY are you arming our druglords with your evil second amendment!  FOR SHAME!""  I don't know about you guys, but I just.. can't.

I'll miss this movie, I really will.  But maybe they should have tried less to force leftist ideals down my throat, and tried harder to win me over to the love story.  And maybe made the President seem a little more than a lovesick teenager.  Like when he asks his Sec of State who talked with Sydney on the phone: ""Did she say anything about me?""  And, exasperated, he says ""No, but I'll ask her before study hall!""  That sums up my feelings pretty well.

The president opposes any changes in the educational laws, suggesting that tampering with educational experiments would be turning our back on public education.  (Well, I suppose public education has to win at the expense of school children!

The president does not support the 20% reduction -- not because it's bad for the economy -- but rather, because it's unpopular!  Well.  Then there's the Michael J. Fox character, who is an assistant to the president.  He and many others in the movie suggest that if we only banned hand guns, the streets in LA would be safe.  Good grief.  I suggest reading More Guns, Less Crime, by John Lott.

The romance in the movie was superficial, but that is what one would expect from liberals.  After all, they are not too concerned with learning about others, but rather through learning to govern and control them.",1104624000,5,1209,4.925742574257426

When it comes down to the wire, he chooses to focus on the crime bill instead, and shelves the environmental one. Not to worry though, because the President comes to his senses, and all ends well.

I wrote a screenplay a few years ago called ""A Murderous Campaign"". It had all the elements of a great script. A beautiful porn star has an affair with a Democrat Louisiana Senator. She overhears him plotting the assassination of a political rival, but they find out she heard the plan. They try to kill her, so she goes into hiding and hooks up with a crusty old Washington reporter who is considered kooky because he has been accusing this Democrat of these crimes for years. A retired FBI friend of the reporter helps them. The Democrat announces a Presidential bid. The porn star uses her considerable charms and discovers that the Governor of New Jersey is the assassination target at a Statue of Liberty rally. She saves the Governor, and the plot is revealed, but the Democrat candidate goes into spin control. Nobody can really prove the plan. It looks like he will win the nomination, having weathered the politics of personal destruction. Finally, the porn girl and the reporter find the old father of the Democrat's chief of staff, a former Ku Klux Klansman who wants to get what he knows off his chest before passing from this mortal coil. He tells them about the drug smuggling operation the candidate has been running in the Louisiana Bayou. The reporter's FBI pal arranges a raid. They discover all the ""smoking gun"" evidence of a series of political murders going back years. The girl is re-united with her family, gets out of the porn business, the reporter wins the Pulitzer, and it is jail time for the Democrat. The end.
 Creative execs who loved the verbal pitch when I simply described the Democrat as a ""politician,"" a ""candidate"" or the ""Senator"" all passed when they read the part in the script that identifies him as an actual Democrat. Pamela Anderson would be perfect as the porn chick. I could see Denzel Washington as the reporter, and Gary Busey as the Democrat Senator. I was asked if I would change him to a Republican. My answer was that I wanted to maintain the realism of the story. See ya.

995033,5,6305132666,"Rob Reiner's 1995 film, ""The American President"", is one of my favorite movies.

Michael Douglas' realistic portrayal of the title character [President Andrew Shepherd] is a refreshingly-different change for Mr. Douglas, from his earlier rather--shall we say--steamy roles in ""Fatal Attraction"" (1987), ""Basic Instinct"" (1992), and ""Disclosure"" (1994). Annette Bening also shines brightly here--as Douglas' love interest.

Written by ""The West Wing's"" Aaron Sorkin, it's nearly impossible to watch this movie today and not notice the similarities between Sorkin's work on the film and the excellent NBC-TV program it spawned.

Several of the actors in the film went on to star in the TV series as well, including Martin Sheen, Joshua Malina, and Anna Deavere Smith.
Mr. Sorkin is one heck of a writer.  And he wrote an impressive movie in ""The American President"".

Unfortunately, there's no ""Making Of"" type of materials included on the DVD.  We get a trailer for the film, plus some production and bio (text) notes, but nothing more in the way of bonuses. (Perhaps a ""Special Edition"" DVD Edition will some day surface.  That'd be sweet indeed.)

While it's certainly true that the picture quality on this non-anamorphic Warner Brothers DVD-Video is far from being perfect....I still think it's in a highly-watchable condition.  Sure, we get the usual amount of ""jaggies"" and blurred images of stuff in the background inherent to an image that's not been enhanced for 16x9 televisions. But I don't really think it's the worst DVD transfer ever to come along either.  Of course, mileage will vary. Everyone has their own definition of ""bad"".

The soundtrack, on the other hand, seems quite robust and nice. There's a Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround track on this disc.

""The American President"" is presented here in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 2.35:1. I've seen information elsewhere that claims this DVD presents the movie in a 1.85:1 ratio, which is inaccurate. So don't be fooled, it's definitely shown here in its full w-i-d-e ""scope"" ratio of 2.35:1.

The picture quality is terrible and is akin to the kind of picture one would expect to find on a bootleg DVD. In fact, I have seen bootlegs with better picture quality than this.
I would suggest waiting for a ""Special Edition"" release with a newer transfer. Or, one may consider the possibility of purchasing the Region 2/4 Edition, as I did (assuming, of course, that one has a multi-region player that can handle PAL).

995090,1,6305132666,"""The American President"" was a script idea floating around Hollywood since the late 1970's.  Originally entitled, ""The President Elopes"" it was first conceived as a flat out farce and then a melodrama before falling into the capable hands of director, Rob Reiner in the early 1990's.  Retitled and rewritten, the resulting film, about what would happen if a widowed President decided to date a political activist, the film emerged as a touching, sentimental and witty romantic comedy that warmed the heart and endeared itself in the mind. As President Andrew Sheppard, Michael Douglas is simply amazing.  Annette Benning is a sensation as his girlfriend, Sidney Ellen-Wade.  Nice cameos from Martin Sheen, David Paymer and Michael J. Fox round out this stellar cast.
Unfortunately there's nothing stellar about the DVD transfer from Warner Brothers. It's not anamorphic and is riddled with the kind of excessive digital grain and anomolies that one can't fathom from a major player like Warner Home Video.  Aliasing, shimmering of fine details, excessive edge enhancement and extreme digital tiling create a visual image that is gritty, harsh and overpowering on the eyes.  Colors can be well balanced and at other times quite smeared.  The soundtrack has been remastered to 5.1 surround but one wonders why the extra effort was taken, considering how badly the rest of the film looks.  THERE ARE NO EXTRAS!  Bottom line: Don't waste your time or money.  The good news - since this release Warner Video has done a complete 180 degree turn about so we just might see a remastering effort of this title in the near future.

Why aren't you, Bob? Now this is an organization who's sole purpose is defending the Bill of Rights."" ...

Michael Douglas plays somewhat against his usual type as a likeable, widowed, well-meaning single father who is also the President of the United States, Andrew Shepherd.  He becomes romantically interested in an environmental lobbyist, Sidney Ellen Wade (Annette Benning) which turns out to cause a lot of problems for both of them.
These two high-powered actors manage to humanize their characters into ordinary, likable people who are just trying to fall in love despite unbelievable opulence of surroundings, ugly political maneuvering and living inside a media fishbowl of publicity.  Along the way, there are plenty of funny, heartwarming moments including a couple of very funny telephone calls.  (Imagine what YOU would do if you suddenly received a call from someone who claimed to be the President of the United States)
David Paymer, Michael J. Fox and Martin Sheen are excellent in their supporting roles as advisors to the President and Shawna Waldron is wonderful as the 1st daughter.

The movie is about president who lost his wife, who falls for a environmental lobbyist.  The struggle comes from Richard Dryfus's character ""Bob Rumpsfeld"" (bad nomanclature). He finds out that this woman is an extreme left lobbyist.  He uses this to throw stones at the president, who he is trying to defeat in the coming election.  The presidential staff characters are wonderfully acted and fun to watch.  The interaction in the staff is Golden.
People should look at this movie as a movie, not a political statement. Of course the movie has liberal themes.  When a filmmaker makes a movie, the audience is what he/she is working to please.  It is hard to romanticize a conservative agenda.  This movie's target audience is women(Even thought I love it). Do you think a woman is going to want a watch a romantic dramedy with a central theme of business, welfare reform, or maybe even limiting awards in malpractice suits? NO, of course not. I am a conservative, and I don't want to watch a romanitic comedy about my agenda.  Two things that are heart felt issues on both sides of the isle are the environment and gun control.  They use these issues because they are common and good plot points, and are easily dramatized. They are not the central theme of the movie.

The set design and the dramatic scenes with Douglas and his ""cabinet members"" and ""high-level military personnel"" were also very believable. However, the quality of the disk is grainy, and the ""movie screen"" format not only shrinks the images, but it also distorts them. The movie's frames ""hang"" in spots, suspending the action for seconds at a time on and off throughout the film. My recommendation: Stick to TNT's reruns.",1031788800,3,726,4.959016393442623
995096,5,6305132666,"Okay, to weigh in on the key points of discussion that keep popping up with regards to this particular romantic comedy.  First, I would have liked ""West Wing"" if I had never seen ""The American President"" and I would have liked ""The American President"" even if it was not a test balloon for ""The West Wing.""  Second, of course a romantic comedy about the President of the United States is going to have a liberal in the White House.  Conservatives are either (a) not that funny or (b) do not like to be laughed at, take your pick.  Third, the part that bugs me the most is the ""character"" issue everybody keeps alluding to.  I know part of the premise of this movie is ""What is Hillary died and Bill Clinton was all alone in the White House and Chelsea was giving him dating tips?"", but does that automatically mean we have to give all his sexual foibles to the fictional Andrew Shepherd?  The man says he has only loved two women in his life and that it has been a long time since he has done anything sexual, so what is this character issue?  Somebody explain it to me...like I was a six year old.
The actual plot of ""The American President"" is as old as the hills: boy becomes President, boy meets girl, boys falls for girl, girl falls for boy, and the entire country has an opinion.  But ultimately the story does not matter because we stop flipping through the channels when we come to this movie on television because of the snappy dialogue and the excellent acting performances.  Somehow screenwriter Aaron Sorkin got from ""A Few Good Men"" and ""Malice,"" to this choice piece of political drama.  Michael Douglas turns in his best romantic comedy performance as President Andrew Shepherd while Annette Bening plays Sydney Ellen Wade, a paid political lobbyist who discovers she has more of the President of the United States than his ear.
But ultimately ""The American President"" features one of those ensemble casts that makes you sit and shake your head in wonder.  Actually, it is rather depressing to think that the actual occupants of the West Wing are no where as smart or as glib as this crew: Martin Sheen (""Come, friends, let us away""), Anna Deavere Smith (""I think the important thing is not to make it look like we're panicking""), Samantha Mathis (""Sir, I don't understan?""), and David Paymer (""Well, I could explain it better, but I'd need charts, and graphs, and an easel""), and in my choice for the best performance of his career, Michael J. Fox (""Can I just state very clearly I can't be part of anything illegal"").
Did I mention the dialogue is really good in this film?  However, the film's only Oscar nomination was for Original Musical score.  Go figure.
Personally, I do not think the American people would turn upon a widowed President who started dating.  But then I have this pesky idealistic streak that refuses to go away.  This is a witty, literate romantic-comedy that harkens back to Hollywood's golden age.  Ultimately the film's political leanings have little to do with our enjoyment because we know nothing ever happens with issues like gun control and fuel emissions in the real world and Bob Rumson's problem is not that he is running for President but that he is trying to break up the romance between these two kids.
Most Romantic Lines: (1) ""Well, first of all, the two hundred pairs of eyes aren't focused on me. They're focused on you. And the answers are Sydney Ellen Wade, and because she said yes.""  (2) ""Perhaps I didn't properly explain the fundamentals of the slowdown plan.""  (3) ""I've loved two women in my life. I lost one to cancer and I lost the other because I was too busy keeping my job to do my job. Well, that ends right now.""  Of course, these are not the best lines in the movie because those are all about politics more than romance.
If you like ""The American President,"" then check out these other films on the AFI's list: #74 ""Woman of the Year"" and #31 ""The King and I.""  Why?  Well, because in the former you find how hard it is to mix politics and love and in the latter you have a leader whose position does not allow him to fall in love.",1028332800,36,4106,4.536585365853658

As romantic comedy, it works quite well, and the political setting elevates it so that one who usually doesn't like romantic comedy should give it a chance.  Somebody compared this with DAVE, and this will appeal to those who liked DAVE.
The cast definitely carries the picture.  I'm not a Michael Douglas fan, but he's quite effective here, as is Annette Bening.
As far as believability is concerned, sure, the movie misses here and there, but do we go to see a movie to see things exactly the way they are?  I doubt that myself.

Aren't our standards a little high?""), the riotous (and painfully realistic) futile attempts Shepard makes to personally send flowers to Sidney.
There's a ring of honesty to the story that's rare in Hollywood movies today. Presumably Reiner and staff had plenty of opportunity to view the Clinton White House in action. It's too bad they didn't pay more attention to protocol. There is no way the President could/would have danced first with Sydney Wade at the dinner for the French Ambassador. Protocol demands that the President dance with the Ambassador's wife for the first dance...THEN he might have been free to choose Sydney. There were a couple of mistakes involving protocol that shouldn't have appeared but in all the movie is romantic, witty and vastly entertaining.

Now imagine this president being played by a terribly noble but very believable Michael Douglas, a presidential single father who lost his wife to cancer a few years back, and who has avoided any hint of dating since then. Enter environmental lobbyist Sydney Ellen Wade, playing charmingly by a sprightly and beautiful Annette Benning, and you have the beginnings of a romance reminiscent of the ""good old days"" of Cary Grant and Ingrid Bergman.
In these post-Monica days, it's hard to think of a president seriously courting and falling in love with a worthwhile and intelligent woman. The problems they encounter (inquisitive press, sniping by political adversaries) seem so tame in light of real life! But they are very real to this couple, and they are solved in a manner that still makes me sigh with pleasure.
A word to the politically conservative: Although it is never stated, Michael Douglas's president is definitely not a Republican.

Well, it didn't put me to sleep.  In fact, I was glued to the screen from beginning to end.
The first thing I remember thinking was, ""Man, Michael Douglas just had the greatest lines.""  And he did - he had a witty comeback for everything that was thrown at him.  And when he wasn't being witty, such as when he is addressing his character towards the end of the film, it is still great writing.  Aaron Sorkin, the writer of the movie, should win an award for ""Best Lines"" or something.
Every character in the film gives a great performance.  Annette Bening is as great in this film as she is in ""American Beauty.""  I just loved how her character was vulnerable one minute, sexy the next, and then sharp as a whip later.  The supporting cast also deserves kudos for rounding out this great film.  Michael J.

His showdown with Douglas towards the end of the film about Douglas' character is great.  Also to be commended are Martin Sheen, Anna Deavere Smith, David Paymer, and Richard Dreyfuss, who perfectly plays the snot-nosed Republican only looking out for his own personal political gain.

995236,3,6305132666,"Aaron Sorkin must have went back for seconds and even thirds on the day that God handed out the ability to write witty, intelligent dialogue. Fans of his television shows ""Sports Night"" and ""The West Wing"" know this already, as do anyone who saw his play ""A Few Good Men"" or its filmed adaptation. In ""The American President,"" Sorkin teams up again with ""Good Men"" director Rob Reiner to provide, again, a political drama that manages to remain human and endearing, primarily due to Sorkin's magnificent lines.
Michael Douglas plays President Andrew Shephard, a widower, who, although the President, happens to be a decent person. Annette Benning plays a lobbyist who, despite being a lobbyist, is also decent. These two decent people meet each other and fall in love, though their love is thwarted by the wholly indecent Richard Dreyfus as a petty little twerp of a Republican candidate, using their liasons as political fodder. Will our heroes survive? Save us, Frank Capra!
The setup works well, and all the performances are splendid. The highlight is Sorkin's writing, and the highlights in Sorkin's writing here are the great speeches. Hey, it's Presidential. The film is made by Douglas's gripping, propelling speech to the press club at the climax of the film where he politically ...-slaps Dreyfus and stands up for his woman. It's great, makes you want to stand up and cheer for the country and several liberal-leaning policies like gun-control and greenhouse emissions (Sorkin, thankfully, was allowed to through in some political ""lobbying"" of his own, as usual. No one wants an apolitical movie about the President, for crying out loud). Michael J. Fox as advisor Lewis Rothchild also gets his two copper cents in as an insider who is somehow undamaged by soul-crippling Washington and has maintained his idealism. Fox makes up believe it, which is shocking.
Now, while the speeches are great, the rest of the dialogue never manages the wit and pace that is Sorkin. Reiner's directing, in their second team-up, doesn't seem to keep up with the script, and most of the exchanges are flawed. We can see how they should be, but they aren't there yet.

995241,4,6305132666,"This film makes a serious effort to tackle a serious subject.  How far may the electorate  intrude on a public figure's private life?  Michael Douglas' role of Andrew Sheppard is a  modern reflection of Woodrow Wilson's nearly state-secret marriage in the latter days of his  presidency.  Douglas' portrayal reflects an equivalent political scene, as well.  Wilson  struggled with the biggest issue of his day, the League of Nations.  Sheppard is seeking  passage of environmental legislation.  Both, confronted with the need to compromise, are in  vulnerable positions.  As so often with American politics, the public are led by unscrupulous  politicians to overlook serious issues and target incumbents with tainted personal  considerations.  Wilson scandalized America with his marriage.  Even later historians credited  Mrs Wilson with forcing policies she favoured through an ill, weakened president.
Douglas carries his role quite suitably.  He's a far cry from the austere Wilson, portraying  Sheppard with a Kennedyesque panache.  He amply demonstrates what a president must  endure in having vital legislation adopted.  The ""Crime Bill"" episode is reminiscent of the  Kennedy brothers' efforts to curb Mafia power in the 1960s.
 There is just enough of the daughter's presence to keep that issue before us, but the apparent  limited age distance between her and Bening makes one wonder what this would to after the  Banns are published.  Douglas' initial efforts to court Bening superbly demonstrate the  constraints the world's most powerful figure operates in, the florist call being one of the finer  sequences.  Reiner is able to balance the personal with the political.  Bening's presence is more  commanding than a legislative document, but her performance as a lobbyist is strong enough  to keep the real issue before us.  The screenplay falls just short of being truly expressive on  issues.  That may come, someday.
Michael J. Fox and Martin Sheen [especially the latter] turn in strong performances as  presidential advisors.  Sheen is vividly realistic as the long-term counsel, but Fox comes  through in a climatic scene urging Sheppard to reverse an attitude.  Richard Dreyfuss,  however, turns in a very special performance as the petty-minded Kansas senator.  Whether  this is Reiner's personal assault on Bob Dole is irrelevant.  Reiner deftly exposes how low  American politics can sink in the hands of the uncaring.  The contrast is vividly displayed in  Douglas' lament over the innocent people he must destroy in exercising policy curbing  terrorism.  He carries it off with fine credibility.  In the last analysis, this is a film worth  having and re-viewing.  It has a timeless quality, reflecting the feeling of hope we once had  about what a human being a president could be.  Perhaps it will come again.",982454400,2,2837,5.339407744874715
995242,5,6305132666,"Wow!
This is going to be one of my all time favorite movies.  Last semester in my senior government class my teacher showed this movie because it illustrates the seven different roles that a president must fulfill.  I was absent on the last day and just had to rent it to see the end.
Aside from the education factor, the movie is wonderful.  The cinematography is great, the actors are great, it's all great!  I'm not really old enough to be familliar with the actors in it, but they were so convincing in each of their roles...right down to the daughter.  I appreciate that she looked like a normal kid and not like someone from MTV.
The movie is a bit predicatable, but that is part of what makes romantic comedy so great.  It's the warm fuzzies you get when the good guy gets the girl.  My favorite part is right before the end when at the end of his speech he says, ""My name is Alan Shepard and I am the president.""  My whole class cheered then, because during the rest of the movie the other candidate would say at the end of all his speeches, ""My name is Bob Whatever, and I'm running for president.""  It was like, take that Bob!
If you haven't seen this movie yet ,get in your car, drive to circuit city, and buy it.  It's only twelve bucks, and it will surely become one of your favorites too.  This ranks up there with One Fine Day.",977702400,,1342,4.264822134387352
995321,4,6305132666,"I, like many others here, really liked this movie. From the opening credits with a rich, presidential (although the Democrat leanings even begin here) score to the sharpness of the daily White House precision to the tough lobbying activities to the comfy-cozy apartment of Sydney Wade (Bening) and her sister to the fantasy courtship ride of a popular President who happens to be a witty and charming widower. Rob Reiner cuts a clean film which must have been easy with such outstanding script and acting talent at his disposal. I watched it back to back and the only thing leaving a sour taste in my mouth was the blatant Democratic party platform grandstanding. Obviously, each political party is passionate about their issues but I felt the movie ""Dave"" did a better job of blending liberal politics with a similar fantasy theme.",975974400,2,832,4.907801418439717
995322,5,6305132666,"This is one of those movies that I turn to when I need a  ""couple"" pick up.  My husband and I pop this in when we are  looking for an old favorite with great lines that we can recite from  memory.  I find myself quoting the movie and having others say ""Oh I  know that movie - I loved it""). The word play between the principles  is sharp and to the point. I reminds me of how a relationship between  equals can be. It is so refreshing to see strong female roles - a woman  that has a point of view and whom people look to for direction and  authority. The outcome maybe fanciful and idealic but it certainly leaves  the viewer with the warm fuzzies.",965433600,,649,4.071428571428571
995323,5,6305132666,"There are two romantic comedies in the 1990s that made a big impression on myself; one of them is with what's even known in this side of the world as the Queen of American Romantic Comedies, Meg Ryan in ""Sleepless in  Seattle""; and the other's ""The American President"".
The  motion picture's received some criticism for Michael Douglas' President  Andrew Shepherd, that perhaps this president's just a little too good to be  true. But it didn't bother myself as it may have for others; and what's  wrong with a little fantasy thrown into a romantic comedy like this one?  Douglas is himself supported by an excellent cast that not only offers  variety in character personalities but also in acting styles; with special  nods to Martin Sheen, Samantha Mathis and Michael J. Fox. The true star of  this picture, in my opinion, however is Annette Bening. She sparkles, has a  thoroughly likable character, and possesses an infectious laugh that may  just bring about that chuckle in yourself too. There is also a wonderful  score written by Marc Shaiman, part of which was used to extremely good  effect in the trailer of Saving Private Ryan not too long ago.
All in  all, despite the rather hasty ending at the end- the only real flaw that  detracted just a little from the overall experience- the movie was a  delightful two hour comedy that I've watched many, many repeated times. And  like Sleepless, it's never failed to bring forward a smile. :)",964051200,,1448,4.797570850202429
995324,4,6305132666,"When I first saw this film, It immediately became one of my favorite movies.

995325,5,6305132666,"Beyond the personal chemistry of Benning and Douglas, some of today's political scandals are mashed into the movie. The conservative senator is outraged that a ""Liberal Democrat"" with 1 daughter is dating.
I think too often we forget that the president (irespective of party and  ideology) is a human being with the same need to be loved. This movie  cheers me up everytime I watch it and can best be categorized as a  dramadey.",962582400,,428,4.756756756756757
995326,5,6305132666,"I finally stopped trying to analyze why I can watch this movie over and over and never get tired of it.  It's simply a well done romance.  Michael Douglas plays the type of President we all want to elect, a very  ""presidential"" man of deep concern for his country and humanity,  yet also the guy next door we could play pool and have a beer with.
Only  one thing bothers me about this movie.  There is a basic fallacy in the  premise and I think the popularity of this movie makes my point:  If there  were a widowed President who began dating again while in office, I don't  really believe his popularity would crash, I think the exact opposite.  It  would be the biggest real-life romance since Chuck and Di. CNN would have  live coverage of their dates and daytime talk shows would be filled with  ""The Romance of the Century.""  Their popularity would soar, and  millions of hopeless romantics would be filling their tear-ducts in  anticipation of an emotional and heartfelt marriage proposal during a State  of the Union Address.",962150400,,1033,4.613259668508287
995327,5,6305132666,"This movie is my all-time favorite and watch it at least once a month.  The chemistry between Michael Douglas and Annette Bening is very real and the dialog is fresh, snappy and inventive (especially the scene where Bening is trashing the president, unaware he is standing right behind her).  Michael Douglas is able to bring the presidency down to a  human level, showing the internal struggles he has to do what is right  versus what is popular; it makes me want to right him is as a write-in  candidate this November.  Richard Dreyfuss is deliciously evil as Bob  Rumson and easily brings to mind several modern senators from both  parties.
This movie also highlights a flaw in our modern presidency that  wasn't evidenced until Clinton's impeachment: every aspect of the President  is under public scrutiny.  The term ""personal life"" is an  oxymoron, and his enemies will use the slightest thing to discredit him.  Even if you disagree with the liberal politics, I think everybody agrees  that the president's press conference near the end should be watched by not  only Pres. Clinton but by all of his successors and taken to heart.
The  sets themselves are phenomenal.  After seeing the film I took a tour of the  White House and realized just how accurate they were.  Even the Secret  Service agents standing guard confirmed that the sets of most of the  mansion were highly accurate.  The movie score is lush, romantic and  patriotic without using traditional John Philip Souza or similar marches.

As far as romance goes, watchers can sense the chemistry between Michael Douglas and Annette Benning, and are quickly drawn in, what more could you ask for?  But this movie's distinction lies  in the setting.  Before the Clinton era, making a sitting American  President fall head over heels for you would be a storybook romance.  The  political aspects of the movie are great.  Two thumbs up for Michael J. Fox  as the George Stephanopolous figure!  The frenzy of the White House  involves watchers and makes them cheer even harder for the calm and peace  that surrounds the romance.",961113600,,610,4.872549019607843

995396,5,6305132666,"The scene I most adored in the film is when Michael Douglas showed Annette Bening his so-called ""Dish-room"" (the ""China Room""). It's THE most romantic scene I've ever seen : particularly when Michael  Douglas looked deeply into the eyes of Annette Bening, came closer to her,  told her that he was standing in front of her AS a man and not the  President, and then ...... he kissed her !  [sigh] We all want to be truly  and deeply in love. It's part of our nature. And this is what the film  talks about: the nature of true love; that kind of love that has and knows  no boundaries; that love that can change one's life forever. Some have  found it and have lost it. And this film takes a glimpse on how one can  find love again once one have lost it. Thank you Rob Reiner.

995397,5,6305132666,"With a bit more breezy charm and a little less office politics, this wonderfully warm and surprisingly enchanting romantic comedy resembles at first glance The West Wing, the current White House drama series on NBC.  Rob Reiner directs this handsome movie with a light touch, yet the movie  looks beautiful.  Respectful of the highest office in the world, the movie  playfully gets inside, but never pulls the rug out from under its comedic  tone, which is key to its success.  Annette Bening has never been more  appealing; her comedic skills nearly overshadow her scene-stealing  emotional moments, and Michael Douglas has the bigness in presence, charm  and sheer physical prowess that make his president entirely believable.  The big fanfare of the gorgeous musical score provides a patriotic  undertone to this entirely American story; like the best sexually charged  comedies from the 1940s (Hepburn/Tracy, etc.), this movie has a big heart,  and wins your completely.",957225600,16,974,5.287581699346405

And did I mention that it is an election  year?
As President Sheppard's character ratings falling from personal  best 68% to the low 40's, his interests become torn between the crime bill  (his top priority) and Sydney's-passing Energy Bill 455.  And it is up to  the White House staff members A.J. MacInnerey (Martin Sheen), Lewis  Rothschild (Michael J.

You want a lesson on  how movie romance should be made? Just watch the scene where the President  and his date are dancing and talking with each other during a state dinner  at the White House. Pure magic!
And towards the end of the film, the two  monologues about leadership; one by Michael J. Fox's character and the  other by the President should be required viewing in any civics class (if  civics are even taught anymore!).
