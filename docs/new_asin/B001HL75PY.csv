3630489,3,B001HL75PY,"i didn't buy this for a long time becuase of some of the reviews i have seen but i like this dvd! other bellydance superstar dvds are definitley better than this one BUT as a dancer of almost 5yrs(on and off i must admit) i found morias layering section challenging but in a good way! samanthas cymbal section is GREAT if your a *beginner*, sherrys floorwork section is my 2nd favorite part of this dvd! kamis is too short and not challenging...so in the end 2/4 sections i liked, its a okay dvd.",1278288000,2,496,4.344086021505376
3630490,2,B001HL75PY,"I got this after a workshop with Kami Liddle at a Bellydance superstars gathering.  I'd asked her specifically for something that would be good for a tribal dance beginner.

I have had extensive belly dance experience with Egyptian cabaret and experimented a little with choreography to ""Dead Can Dance"" music before tribal was popular and before, for some reason, it turned Goth. I've performed at restaurant venues, fairs and private parties.  But, I have not danced in several years and needed something to get me back into dance form.

This is a wonderful video if you want to see what these women can do.  But it is a completely unrealistic workout.  A contortionist, perhaps?  A 20 year yoga veteran, maybe.  But not, definitely NOT for even intermediate much less a beginner or someone trying to get back into shape....unless you're trying to injure yourself...then it's perfect.

I'm afraid this is one that's gathering dust on my shelf.  I'm not likely to take recommnedations from Bellydance superstars in the future.",1274572800,11,1027,5.023668639053255
3630491,5,B001HL75PY,"Of the DVD's I received for Christmas this year, this was my favorite. Four talented belly dancers delve into 4 different aspects of this form of dance. Kami with pops & locks, Moria with yoga and strength training (which is advanced but worth having as your skill level progresses) Samantha with zil patterns, and Sherrie with floorwork. There are also 2 excellent special features one on makeup, where Moria applies Samantha's makeup for her... and one on costuming where each lady goes into excellent detail on what they are wearing who made it, and where they got it. I do wish the floor work section was a little longer with perhaps a few more moves, but the fact that they left me wanting more as opposed to turning it off can be seen as a good thing. I have been danicng for about a year now, with little opportunity to take workshops, so for me this was well worth having. If you are somone who already knows a lot of the fundamental moves, than this could be seen as remedial.",1264032000,,985,4.477777777777778
3630492,3,B001HL75PY,"This video has four instructional sections.
The first is Kami. Kami does a series of short drills. She starts slow enough that if you had not done this before you could follow. However they get progressivly harder.  I found these drills great practice, and the combos at the end fun.
The second is Moria with an intro to layering. Moria's conditioning section is only for those of you who are already in top shape, also really too fast to follow. This is not an intro to layering - this is a test in your ability to do difficult moves at top speed. Moria talks as fast as she can and moves just a s fast. I really don't think even the best dancer could follow this.
The third is Samantha with an into to finger cymbals.  This was a great challenge.  The very beginner would have to stop video and practice between each section.  I have only has a couple sesson in finger symbols and I followed along untill about the middle.  As it got harder, even though I could not keep up it was fun all the way through.  She covers RLR, 31313, 3 11, acents and 373 all with layering.
Fourth is Sherri with floor work.  I have never done floor work before and although I found it interesting, most of this was beyond my abilities.  She has lots of good tips for beginners and advanced. She also does a short warm up and cool down. She covers getting to the floor, back bends and traveling while on the floor.
The makeup section was detailed and helpful.
The costume section was alot of fun.
The performances were of coures great. I think I would buy this, Kami and Samantha's sections would be great practice.",1253923200,28,1596,4.368243243243243
3630493,4,B001HL75PY,"This is an interesting DVD in the sense that I did not like it when I first got it. I didn't like the fat body of Kami and I still don't, nothing wrong with her, only I am very particular on body shape. I don't like the lighting, too dark. I couldn't quite follow the moves by Moria. I did not touch anything by Sherri.

But after a few months' practice with Asharah, which is a very good DVD and one that I use a lot, I am getting better and so I return to this DVD. To my surprise, I like it. I now find Moria's moves very challenging. I like the fast beat, which is very good for a quick workout when I am pressed in time. I like the way that she explains while doing the moves, saving a lot of time without stopping the flow. In that sense, she has to speak fast, which I normally don't like but accept. I also like Sherri's teaching of the floor work, which no other DVD has offered before. She speaks in a more controlled tone and a very sweet voice than Moria. I like their bodies, very lean and strong. I thought these two ladies' teaching is already worth the price of the DVD. So a 4 star at least! I have not started the remaining lady's teaching yet, Samnatha. In another word, this DVD is like a gem, always having something to offer.

Yes, only one thing. I can't quite see whether Sherri lifted her heels up in some moves. So I suppose it is better for the teachers to wear something shorter or see-through so that we can see the moves very clearly.

At this moment, it is my favourite one.

I have also learned one thing. Even though other customers all give a 5-star for some DVDs, like many other DVDs that I have bought, I still find some of them not my cup of tea. I guess it has to be appropriate for our use at the moment. Therefore, I suppose we may try our luck instead of wholly relying on others' views.

Having said that, I would like to see more precise description given by the sellers like for what kind of students, what it will offer so that we can see whether it is appropriate for our use. If a DVD delivers what it claims, then it is good enough.",1252368000,2,2081,4.090686274509804
3630494,4,B001HL75PY,"i quite liked this dvd.  the only two things i did not do were Moiras intense yoga stuff.  the other parts i did do, but the floor shimmies and chest lifts at the same time, no f***** way.  i am not that advanced yet. as much as i love Moira, i am not at that level yet.  i just started learning tribal a year and half ago so it will be a while.  i did do Kamis part and have not gotten up to Sherries part yet 'cause i don't have kneepads yet.  Samantha'a zills demonstation is not for me.  loved the costume and makeup section.  overall a good dvd.  i would recommend it.",1247529600,4,573,3.956140350877193
3630495,2,B001HL75PY,The solo's are nice but if you haven't had any dance experience this isn't the dvd for you. It's like BBSS are getting to commercial and just randomly coming up with below par dvds.,1243296000,8,181,4.352941176470588
3630496,1,B001HL75PY,I can't  find anything nice to say about this DVD..There was one part where the music was so loud it seemed like I was fighting to hear what the instructor was saying...I took it out of the player and haven't thought about it since...I will up date this reveiw if I decide to take another look....,1239753600,11,297,4.303571428571429
3630497,4,B001HL75PY,"four differnt teachers. one for every section. actually their is one teacher but demostrated by four different dancers. There is a different dance solo from each dancer demostrating the area they taught. the first I recall that you are learning the moves that she performs. there is a floor work section, an conditioning section ,a pop lock section ,and finger cymbals section. The conditioning section is rough. I would keep this dvd just to get into shape so that I can do isolations like Moria. You get to learn four differnt areas of mastery on one dvd. I wish it was longer and more practice but nice introdution to the fundamentals. I can't see where it is for beginners espcially the conditioning section. you should have some idea of the basic moves for they are not explained. Fusion is a lot harder to me than regular belly dance the moves are more cut and you use more muscle control.",1238198400,6,895,4.635220125786163
3630498,4,B001HL75PY,"So far I have enjoyed this DVD. I loved the performances and the tips on costuming and makeup. I did a few of each section, some I found fun and challenging. However, I think a few of the words were off on some parts, and you can tell me if I wrong but I thought yoga was more slow paced easing in the stretches, I felt rushed on some of the yoga, but overall I think it was worth the money.",1237939200,3,391,3.8395061728395063
8308874,1,B001HL75PY,DVD won't play. I bought 3 DVD and can only play one of them. So I am assuming there was some kind of exposure during delivery. I hae to return,1425772800,,143,3.8
8308875,4,B001HL75PY,"Samantha's zill section is perhaps the best beginner zill instructional I've seen thus far!  Sherri's floorwork instructional (given in her rad California-girl accent) was super--get ready to take notes on those two!  Moria, while adorable, taught basic yoga stretching and did those bizarre Suhaila/Sharon Kihara buttcheek isolation twerking exercises.  Her twist was that she did them super fast and layered a million things on top of them which was more like showing off than something a student could follow or use in their arsenal.  Kami's pops and locks were standard beginner tribal fare.

Perhaps I am a bit spoiled because there are some really awesome tribal troupes in my state, but the performances on this DVD were a little bit lackluster in my opinion, but then again tribal isn't my fav anyway.  I did like Sherri's style though--she looked like a half-wild slave dancer from a ""Conan the Barbarian"" movie--and she even sort of smiled, although she still had the obligatory thousand-yard-tribal-dancer stare.  And Samantha is a rarity--too few tribal dancers play zills!  It was a nice break from the constant squid-like hand movements many tribal dancers employ.

The bonus makeup technique and costuming sections were interesting and inspiring, but the camera never focuses in close enough to really get an idea of how to achieve the same result.

Overall, it's worth checking this DVD out for Samantha, Sherri, the bonuses, and the fabulous costumes (particularly Moria's self-described ""Queen-of-the-Damned-wearing-a-tablecloth""!)",1378684800,,1549,5.443514644351464
8308876,5,B001HL75PY,Fun way to stay in shape. Felt results after first time. Found myself practicing in the kitchen while cooking. Fun & sexy way to entertain!,1363305600,,139,4.6
8308877,5,B001HL75PY,"challenging but not impossible, interesting extras.  The 3 dancers have different styles, gives you alot to choose from. would recommend for intermediate dancer",1332806400,,160,5.956521739130435
8308878,4,B001HL75PY,"I have done bellydancing off and on for several years now. When I first bought this DVD it frustrated me that I couldn't do alot of what they did. Such as the stretch routine with Moria. I have never been able to do the splits nor do I have enough butt to do those stretches.  They tend to go pretty fast but if you get the jist of the movement then you can do it later on your own. Considering that it's hard if not impossible to find an intermediate DVD for bellydancing I would think of this as the closest i've found so far. The floorwork will definately get your legs burning. I also liked Kami's routine simply because it didn't make you feel as if you couldn't do anything, but you can also challenge yourself to ""pop"" the movement like she does. This also covers some on how they made their costumes, not actual step-by-step as I was hoping, but more of where they got this piece or part. Taken seriously, I could see a part-timer like me using this DVD for awhile.",1321315200,,973,4.2594594594594595
8308879,4,B001HL75PY,This was not too bad.  I liked the section done by Kami.  I am still working through Moria's section.  I did find that this section is not a beginners section.  The performances were great.  I also liked the intro to floor work.  I would have to say that this DVD is for advanced beginners not someone who is starting out.  I have been dancing for a little over a year and some of this DVD is a little above me.,1315353600,,411,4.0625
8308880,3,B001HL75PY,"Seeing as there are no tribal fusion instructors in my area, I bought this DVD to learn moves.  I have another DVD called ""Tribal Fusion Belly Dance"" featuring Rachel Brice by the same company, which in my opinion was extremely well-done for a beginner.

When I watched this DVD I felt that it was very rushed and did not have the pace it should have had for beginner/novice.  Not only that, I felt the voice instruction was hurried, almost impatient, while I am sure these women do this sort of instruction everyday with more experienced dancers, they seem to have forgotten that some of us are trying to learn it.

Despite this, after doing it about a zillion times I was able to kind of keep up (meaning, I didn't  have to pause it every five seconds, just only every ten.), the moves and techniques are solid, but I feel like they should have maybe had a beginner section, where things were broken down and explained with more clarity.. the whole thing just felt more like a marathon, than instruction.",1314835200,3,1006,4.566666666666666
8308881,4,B001HL75PY,"I wasn't sure what to expect from this video given the reviews that had been posted when I bought it.  Kami's Locks section is accessible for someone like me who is an experienced beginner, almost intermediate dancer.  Moria's conditioning section is, however, still beyond me for the most part, although I can follow along to some of it.  This section contains quite a few ingenious exercises.  I find that if I slow it down (especially the floor section in which one contracts the glutes in rapid fire, while cycling to the upper and lower abs and pulling in at the shoulder blades). Although I can't follow it yet, I look forward to a time when I can - it's an incentive to grow, a challenge, and I respect that.  Thus, I've bought a DVD resource I can continue to consult as I grow as a dancer.  Samantha's zills section is a godsend to someone like me, whose greatest hurdle to learning zills has been coordinating movement while playing!  This is the most ""fundamental"" of the section and is well done. I'd like to see a follow up from Samantha, maybe a comprehensive zill course for those of us who love tribal fusion.  The floorwork by Sherri is still mostly beyond me but, again, it's something I can grow into, extending the useful life of this video long after most others languish on my shelf.  Finally, the makeup section was comprehensive.  I learned quite a bit about products (although some that they recommend seem no longer available).  The costuming section is a bit chatty but one can get a good idea of what TF dancers were wearing in 2007.

All in all I would recommend this DVD with the few caveats listed above.",1297036800,5,1635,4.561643835616438
8308882,5,B001HL75PY,"This is a great dvd, I especially love the costuming and makeup sections that's hard to find anywhere else.",1280966400,,107,4.684210526315789
