It's mostly just background music and video of babies and toddlers playing on an indoor plain background.  Babies and toddlers will probably like looking at the children on the video, but don't expect them to learn anything.",1126051200,,301,5.122448979591836

We have been very selective about our children's TV viewing and found LittleFriendsTV to be among the quality DVDs like Baby Einstein. I think it's our families new favorite!
