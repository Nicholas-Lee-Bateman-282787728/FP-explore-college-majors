7027421,5,B00U1U2SG8,We really enjoyed this DVD!  It was a nice mix of Champagne houses from more modest family run operations to Bollinger.  The music/soundtrack was lovely.,1439337600,,153,5.08

7027424,4,B00U1U2SG8,"We love Champagne and drink it regularly.  I was excited about this documentary but it fell slightly short.  The main reason is that I felt 'A Year in Burgundy' showed a wider variety of producers and different viewpoints.  This documentary does focus heavily on Bollinger and a couple of small producers (and Gosset was thrown in almost as an after thought).  I would have liked a little more time spent on some other producers, perhaps even adding this to the special features. Speaking of: they were pretty minor - though there is an e-book of sorts about Champagne but reading on the TV is hard to do and there are four deleted scenes and a brief biography of the filmmaker.

In my opinion, this is a DVD geared towards those interested in but not knowledgeable about the specifics in production and style of Champagne.  Never once was there a mention of various styles such as Brut vs Demi-sec or even what really made a 'vintage' Champagne special.  Instead we have a few winemakers talking about it and mentioning that it is special, but we don't really get a picture of non-vintage vs vintage vs Tete de Cuvee.  I was happy however to see a nice segment on the disgorging and bottling of this beverage.

If I hadn't seen 'A Year in Burgundy', then this would probably rate five stars.  We did watch 'A Year in Burgundy' between watching this twice.  I am really looking forward to next year's 'A Year in Port'!!!",1432598400,6,1420,4.595238095238095
7027425,5,B00U1U2SG8,"So many wine films are simple self-promotion, or touristic nonsense filmed just during the picturesque harvest season. But this is the real thing: bad weather, grumpy winemakers, cute winery dogs, families who've been doing this for 500 years, the whole story. If you're bored by the self-promotion of the big combines (Moet & Chandon etc) and want to know just what genius (technical and artistic) it takes to create the ""real thing"", then this 82 minutes will flash by in an instant. You'll discover things you never believed possible (Attila the Hun was finally conquered in the fields of Champagne!) and have laughs and fun too. Go for it. This is the real story of Champagne.",1431043200,5,680,4.870689655172414
7027426,4,B00U1U2SG8,"Time usefully spent if you like Champagne, the real (and the only) thing to us Champagne fanatiques who find life tres dull when drinking Champagne's hot climate spawn, now found throughout the shameless world.  A little too much of the French ""Prestige Disorder"" is in evidence in this hour and a half, but the film gives you a sense of what the people who make Champagne have to put up with, climate-wise.  Full marks to these  suffering Gallic worthies, who turn out a consistent brew no matter how wet and cold the weather. Only one quick mention of the prestige-less pinot meunier blending grape the whole movie through.  But what would Champagne be without the tempering off-flavors of the Miller's grape, but, in most cases, a very superior Chardonnay soda?  Fours stars if you are fascinated by this mysterious drink, fewer if you are not.",1428969600,6,847,4.813793103448276

8703906,5,B00U1U2SG8,"Bubbly rewarding documentary on the celebre region of champagne.

I've been to Reims and saw both the ancient Roman monuments and the champagne cellars. This documentary sums up well and uncorks what makes the region so special around the globe. Let's raise our glasses to a video well done.",1529020800,,291,4.938775510204081

8703909,4,B00U1U2SG8,"If you want to see what life is like for the families who have been making Champagne for centuries, along with the countryside, and their passion for wine, this is the movie for you. Absolutely beautiful! I only gave it 4 starts because I liked ""A Year in Burgundy"" better.",1483401600,,273,4.48
8703910,3,B00U1U2SG8,This was actually a pretty interesting documentary about the French champagne industry.  No wonder the stuff is so expensive!,1480377600,,125,5.578947368421052

8703912,5,B00U1U2SG8,"Don't miss Epernay !

The most interesting part of 'Champagne' are the rides through the miles of
underground stone cellars and caves where one can see the long process (green fuzzy mold on bottles) involved in
making this wonderful and prized beverage.",1461542400,,253,5.023809523809524
