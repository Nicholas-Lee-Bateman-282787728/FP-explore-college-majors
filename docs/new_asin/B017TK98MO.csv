7534001,1,B017TK98MO,"A hodgepodge of stories at first understandable, when things becomes clear it is much to late to be even likable.  This one is a real klunker.  Do not even waste your time watching it.  If I could of even given it negative stars I would of.",1457222400,,240,4.173913043478261
7534002,5,B017TK98MO,"If you were a boy growing up in the 80s, you will feel comfortable in this world, with it's primitive video games and lack of most modern conveniences that we take for granted today. This story is actually 2 of James' Palo Alto stories combined. It is a gentle, thought provoking film (you can read the Variety review on this page).  Regular kids, not jocks or braniacs!  A bonus for me was seeing James in 'Dad mode'. The ending resonated with me, as that was the type of kid I was.  Definitely a film that will move you if you watch carefully.",1457136000,6,545,4.323529411764706
7534003,1,B017TK98MO,WTF? Didnt get this at all.,1457049600,,27,3.6666666666666665
7534004,1,B017TK98MO,"Never know what, where, why or anything else you can think of about this movie. For a five star movie someone voted wrong. Do not watch. This is my first and last review.",1456963200,,170,4.181818181818182
7534005,1,B017TK98MO,No plot,1456876800,,7,3.0
7534006,5,B017TK98MO,"Excellent story about growing up and the hazards life hands to you, which include a few tests of friendship. Excellent work from James Franco!",1455062400,12,142,4.958333333333333
7534007,2,B017TK98MO,Nothing happened. You never even see a mountain lion. This movie was so boring.,1463788800,,79,4.714285714285714
7534008,1,B017TK98MO,"One of those movies that leaves you saying...""what in the world just happened""? and ""well, there went an hour and a half of my life that I will never get back"". Waste of time and money. This movie made no sense. No real story line and has nothing at all to do with ""Yosemite"", or James Franco for that matter. He shows up for about the first 10 minutes of the movie and then you never see him again. This movie was the among the worst I have ever seen.",1462838400,,452,4.033333333333333
7534009,5,B017TK98MO,I loved this movie. The stories are challenging and rewarding. The cinematography is gorgeous. And the acting is terrific--and I'm usually pretty skeptical of movies largely driven by child performers. These kids are amazing. Henry Hopper is amazing in this movie. Do yourself a favor and let yourself be challenged by this film!,1462060800,3,329,5.226415094339623
7534010,5,B017TK98MO,"Took me back to those moments when I was a kid and it was like I could FEEL the edges of my childhood. When you know the world is dangerous and bad things happen and could happen to you. These boys are all grazing those edges and they kinda know it. This film unfolds slowly, carefully and beautifully.",1461196800,2,302,4.224137931034483
7534011,5,B017TK98MO,"An intimate portrait of three young boys growing up in Palo Alto in the 1980s. Sensitively observed, it beautifully captures the three protagonists' innocent sense of the world with its potential dangers and mysteries. Great performances by all three young boys and Henry Hopper.",1461024000,,279,5.363636363636363
7534012,5,B017TK98MO,"I absolutely loved this film--it offers a window into the lives of three boys growing up in 1980s Palo Alto, and captures the details and reality of the experience--along with the nuances of the time period--with astounding poignancy and authenticity. A looming threat of danger drives the narrative tension throughout the film, and the way the director weaves together each of the three stories/perspectives and allows them to culminate in a joint adventure is simply masterful. A fantastic debut, and can't wait to see more of this director's work.",1460851200,,550,5.191011235955056
7534013,5,B017TK98MO,"This is an amazing film, with masterful tone and a brilliant capturing of the small-time 1980's lifestyle that many kids grew up in. If you're looking for James Franco or Freaks and Geaks, you will not find it here. Franco is great but is a minor character and is upstaged by the kids--they did an awesome job and must have had a brilliant director to get the performances out of them.

This film is not about a mountain lion. It's about people brushing their teeth and dealing with stuff.",1460764800,4,489,4.49438202247191
7534014,2,B017TK98MO,This was probably a good movie but it just wasn't for me.,1460678400,,57,3.8333333333333335
7534015,4,B017TK98MO,I checked out the rental of this and thought that I'd purchase the dvd considering that James Franco stars in the film as well.,1460246400,,127,4.333333333333333
7534016,1,B017TK98MO,"Just don't waste your time. The description makes it seem like a completely different movie. The title is completely misleading as the story has about 2 minutes of film in Yosemite. Movie is slow, dull, and a waste of time.",1457481600,,223,4.6
8740671,5,B017TK98MO,"My wife made me watch this film. Honestly, Ive never been much of a James Franco fan, but I loved this! The babysitter character was amazingly acted, with more than the expected nuance. Id keep an eye on that girl, she has quite the future. And I am always very critical of films, so you know this is the real deal.",1532390400,,315,4.180327868852459
8740672,2,B017TK98MO,"Serve up mashed potatoes and gravy next to this turkey! A confused train wreck of plot lines introduced that are either completely forgotten or go unresolved. Makes ""The Room"" look like Citizen Kane. Called Yosemite but the park maybe gets ten minutes of screen time, if that. James Franco, it is time for rehab, my friend!",1506211200,,323,4.785714285714286
8740673,1,B017TK98MO,"I'm not sure I've reviewed movies on here, but felt the need to add my 2 cents....

Well acted, and decent cinematography, but lots of loss. Probably the most tragic loss is an hour and 21 minutes of my evening. Don't bother watching, it's a web of dead ends and nonsense.",1505952000,,272,4.333333333333333

8740678,1,B017TK98MO,"This was an hour and a half of my life I will never get back. This movie was ssssllllooooooooow and the whole time you were just waiting for something, anything to happen. There was no point. It just meandered along with no point.",1467504000,,230,4.372093023255814
8740679,1,B017TK98MO,"Ugh...I was so disappointed in this movie. I lived in Oakhurst, CA, just south of Yosemite for the best seven years of my life, and when I saw the title, I had to watch the movie.

Bad acting, and the plot just didn't go anywhere. Just when you think it is building up to something, nothing happens. The ending was as anticlimactic as anticlimactic can get, leaving you wondering what the whole purpose of the movie was about, just depressing.

The best part of the movie was seeing the trees. Forgetting about the failed plot right now, the movie could have been stronger just by showcasing Yosemite's beauty, but it fails to do that, too.",1465603200,,640,4.556521739130435
8740680,5,B017TK98MO,The extras were fantastic. I truly believe this is one of my favorite movies! The plot has a very deep meaning and the settings were superb. I loved the extras and how they were so expressive and how they were a part of the movie. This deserves an Oscar. Yosemite brought be joy and happiness and showed me a new side of life. This is my all time favorite movie. 100% reccomend.,1463788800,2,378,4.263888888888889
