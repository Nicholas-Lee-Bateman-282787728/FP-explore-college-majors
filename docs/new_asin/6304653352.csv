7875029,3,6304653352,"k.d. lang, she of the ""big bones"" and the small letters, is a talented singer and performer.  She knows how to work the stage, and how to work her audience.  Her performance on this video release is virtually flawless, and her hardcore fans will certainly love it.  The rest of us will enjoy it--I certainly did--but may ultimately find that it is not indispensible.  For all her subversive ""gender bending,"" there is something classically ""show biz"" about lang.  Her vocals are powerful, but also rather conventional.  There is little about her actual music that is quirky or subversive.  You could certainly play the bulk of her music for  Mom or Grandma, and they'd never raise an eyebrow.  If they catch the video, they may do a double take--for a minute or two--but ultimately, they'd probably embrace lang and her music.  Which, in the last analysis, may make her pretty subversive after all.
But I still can't find her music quite as compelling as her image and message.  As a performer, she's gifted, canny and a lot of fun.  But she's not really what one would call ""inspired."" Still this video is a good introduction for the uninitiated.  It is, as she herself mentions, a bit of a sampler of a decade's worth of work.  Fans and neophytes will certainly appreciate the range of styles and personae that she embodies.  But a lot of it remains superficial.  To achieve actual greatness, she needs to dig a little deeper.",1023494400,6,1428,4.720647773279352
7875030,5,6304653352,"This surprise video is one of those rare reminders of just how satisfying an evening of entertainment can be! With performances like this, surely k.d. lang will receive the long-overdue recognition that she deserves. Singers come and go in droves, but as this video demonstrates, occasionally the music world is blessed with a phenomenon of immeasurable talent.
The video is an effective mixture of documentary and live performances. Starting with the alluring ""Sexuality"", lang draws us in and entices us. Her cover version of Roy Orbison's ""Crying"", and classic country standards like ""Three Cigarettes in an Ashtray"" are moving vehicles that highlight the incredible range of lang's voice. The raw energy lang musters on ""Pay Dirt"" will make you swear you're watching Elvis. She revisits ""Pullin Back the Reins"" from her country days, this time with a decidedly-bluesy/gospel rendering. Utterly flaunting her diversity, she even does a ""punk"" cover of her own song!
What makes this video so watchable is that lang is having so much FUN while performing. Her rapport with the audience is palpable, especially when she does ""What's new, pussycat?""
All in all, this tape nicely chronicles the full spectrum of k.d.'s career from her country days through her later, jazzy material. Don't miss out on this extraordinary show!",989193600,14,1323,5.245283018867925
7875031,5,6304653352,"This video gives us a small insight into k.d.lang's unbelievable musical greatness.  She is without no doubt the greatest hunk of all.  This video sets u down in front of your tv and holds u there.  It's got everything u  could have of kd's music in the same place except for her self, to bad for  us langsters.  A must must see.",923702400,10,329,4.225806451612903
7875032,5,6304653352,"This is very good for a music video. It captures the emotions and mood of a live concert which is often lost when translated onto a video.  She sings a set of sixteen songs, everything from pop to country to soft rock.  Backstage photos and comments from k. d. lang feel sort of weird at first,  but you get used to it.  Most of the songs are sung beautifully, some i  didn't like but that's just a personal opinion.  There are certain scenes  and things that may be a bit irritating but overall, the video is  entertaining. Those who are seriously into ska, hip-hop, rap, etc. should  avoid this video.  But the general music-listener should find this pretty  cool and enjoyable.  k. d. lang fans will not be disappointed.",914198400,8,723,4.51937984496124
