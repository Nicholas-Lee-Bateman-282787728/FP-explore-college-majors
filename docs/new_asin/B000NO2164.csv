8179480,5,B000NO2164,"One of the more serious commentaries of the surfing lifestyle, yet fun.  It covers history, personalities, etc.  ""Surfing is a gift from an ancient culture that loved the sea"" - from the back cover of the DVD jacket.",1356566400,,216,4.657894736842105
8179481,5,B000NO2164,"After a little more than 45 years trying to find my way through surfing, its history, evolution, etc here is a really didactic film that would have saved me a lot of time, though I don't regret every of the many hours spent on this research. In Boston Museum of Fine Arts, I think, there is a painting by Gauguin (1897) that says: ""D'o venons-nous? Que sommes-nous? O allons-nous?"". For the real surfers many of the answers to these questions can be found on this film.",1219104000,,469,4.465116279069767
8179482,1,B000NO2164,"I bought this DVD thinking it would be like all the other surfing DVDs I have bought - plenty of waves, maybe some narrative, good surfing. I was disappointed. No surfing at all. Instead it is entirely devoted to people talking about what they enjoy or how they have been affected by the sport of surfing. Can't see myself pulling this one out of the collection to watch too often.",1207353600,2,381,4.457142857142857
8179483,5,B000NO2164,"This is a really great movie.  I suggest you buy it for loved ones, just anybody that missed it on PBS.  I happened to see it on PBS and am sure it will play again as a re-run but if you want an all around complete history of surfing, this is the best you will find.  Nothing better to do than watch a surf video about the history of surfing.  If you love old school surfing (Longboarding) or have been swept into the summer lul use this video to get you amped before a session.  Cause we all know to surf often you have to longboard most of the summer.",996364800,9,553,3.9909090909090907
8179484,5,B000NO2164,"this thing was awsome, I loved it.  Two thumbs up.  Get it and you won't regret it.",961113600,7,83,3.823529411764706
