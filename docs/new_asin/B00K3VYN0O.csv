6402858,4,B00K3VYN0O,"As the son and daughter of WWII vets, my husband and I are very interested in the era.... Neither of our fathers would speak of their experiences during the war... my father was in the Pentagon, my husband's father was a U.S. Marshal. This film (and others we own) help us to see what they went through.",1428105600,3,303,4.333333333333333

6402862,5,B00K3VYN0O,Well made with many new and different scenes/vintage clips not seen in many other productions.  Shows a new perspective on some issues.  Could use some coordination of facts with other videos/productions to encompass all the information available.,1418169600,2,247,5.648648648648648

6402864,5,B00K3VYN0O,"Having visited Normandy earlier this year, this show really gave the best description of the German killing fields and fields of fire that I have seen.  Shows why the men were doomed until the first few actually got off Omaha beach.  Also the best description of why air superiority did little to aid the soldiers landing on D-day.",1413936000,3,331,4.689655172413793

6402867,4,B00K3VYN0O,"Packed a lot of information on Omaha Beach into it. By seeing into, under, around, and from various angles the viewer comes away with a better understanding  of this part of Overlord.",1408406400,3,183,4.71875
6402868,5,B00K3VYN0O,"Another view of the D-Day.... This was a good attempt, but not as good of a product like some of the others here on Amazon about the 6th of June.",1505520000,,145,3.8666666666666667

8655760,5,B00K3VYN0O,"Excellent documentary with vivid graphics and on-site views.  Stephen Zaloga, one of the finest authors on WW2, is one of the interviewees.  The best book I have ever read on the defenses the allies faced was ""Devil's Garden"" by Zaloga, and I highly recommend it.",1512000000,2,263,4.822222222222222

8655762,5,B00K3VYN0O,"Very poignant re-telling of the courage, cost and planning that are required to win freedom against a determined, entrenched and well-trained opponent. This movie helps understand more than most what Omaha beach was like on June 6, 1944.",1510185600,,237,5.2631578947368425

8655764,4,B00K3VYN0O,"Unfortunately, the claim that the Germans used a NEW so called super strong material (aka reinforced concrete) to build their bunkers is completely false.  Reinforced concrete was not new.  It had been discovered in 1853 and was being used in France, Germany, Britain, the US prior to 1900.  A 210 foot tall skyscraped in Ohio was built in 1902.  A 1,100 foot long viaduct was built in New Jersey in 1910.  Both of reinforced concrete.",1507334400,,435,4.746666666666667

8655767,5,B00K3VYN0O,"This is very good, well worth watching. All the 360 Documentaries I have seen have been very good, I'm not sure if that means they are all from the Producers or not. The other one I saw was about a WW2 Aircraft carrier, very good, forget the exact name.",1506470400,,253,4.183673469387755
