1242040,3,B00000K3UF,"For it's time this was a great movie.  I was fascinated at the fact that at the time of release, this movie was banned in several states solely because of an interracial kissing scene between the always sensational Dorothy Dandridge, and Curd Jergens, who's performance was less than remarkable.

I'd like to point out that the theme of the movie was to share the knowledge of some of the atrocities committed during the tragic slavery era in the US.  Unfortunately, I must also note the tragedy surrounding the film.  Most notably the name of the film ""Tamango"" suggests that the movie would center around the character Tamango.  It does, however the film credits omit Tamango-(Alex Cressan) even Amazon omitts Alex Cressan in their credits.  Most sites on the internet that review the movie omitt Alex Cressan.  Alex Cressan seems to be victimized in the movie as Tamango as well as himself in not receiving the well deserved credit for a brilliant performance.

There is some comfort in that Dorothy Dandridge gets her props somewhat, however the Black actors who played the slaves were essentially still treated like slaves in the lack of acknowledgement for obvious heart felt performances.

HELLO!

This movie still came along almost a hundred years after slavery?

I do not regret purchasing or viewing the film, I think from a historical perspective it is very important work.  As the saying goes, those who are not aware of their history are condemned to repeat it.",1123459200,6,1474,4.923076923076923
1242041,5,B00000K3UF,"I finally tracked this movie down last week after trying to buy it twice on Amazon.  For such a rare film, it seemed odd that there were so many copies for sale.  It turns out there is a listing error on this site.  It seems that whenever a seller tries to list the Ronald Reagan film CAVALRY CHARGE, it comes out listed under TAMANGO.  If you order one of these $13 items, you will get CAVALRY CHARGE in the mail.  If you are ordering TAMANGO, either look for a more expensively listed item or one where the seller mentions the film itself in the description.",1097452800,22,560,4.295238095238095
1242042,3,B00000K3UF,"A story of a revolt on a slave ship was actually around prior to the more recent Amistad but unfortunately, few seemed to have much interest in it judging from the limited distribution of this film when it first appeared in the conservative atmosphere of the 50's. It was actually banned in France. The objection of course, was the interracial relationship between slave ship captain Curt Jurgens and his slave mistress Aiche (Dorothy Dandridge). When a revolt occurs, Dandridge as a marginalized person tries to stay uninvolved, even though she has some attraction to the revolt leader Tamango. She is not really liked by the African captives as she has ""given"" herself to the white captain and is, of course, viewed as a slave by the white crew members. Curt Jurgens, as a slave ship captain is obviously not the nicest person in the world but seems to have some genuine affection for Aiche and treats her comparatively well. Aiche has suppressed bitter resentment about her slave origins and treatment by former masters and still has hopes for a possible future better life with Jurgens, even after she finds out he has plans to wed a white woman and live in Holland. However, when confronted he claims he will stay with Aiche and even make her a free woman. When the revolt begins she is forced to make a decision where her loyalties lie and tragedy occurs.
There are a few problems with this film beyond low budgeting. The African captives, Jurgens and crew,  all mysteriously speak the same language to each other. 1820 muskets are never seen being re-loaded but continue to fire anyway. But technical issues aside, it is still a film with some impact. Jurgens swaggers well as the captain and Dandridge is appealing as Aiche. A pity that the public was not ready for it when it was released and that it is currently not well known. Not to be missed by any Dandridge fan or those wanting to examine the horrors of slavery.",1095811200,11,1928,4.704142011834319
1242043,5,B00000K3UF,"Tamango captures a wonderful story line, that has never been touched on before, or after. Although the movie seems somewhat ""underbudgated"" it is well worth the money to see this film. It captures the essence, beauty,and talent of Ms. Dandridge. This film also happens to be one of Dorothy Dandridge's last films. Tamango (1958), Porgy and Bess( 1959), and her final finished film Malaga (1960), and her final film that was never finished Marco Polo. Although the quality of the film is poor, you canot deny the quality of the actors and exhuberamt plot. Tamango is well worth it.",995414400,4,580,4.8686868686868685
1242044,3,B00000K3UF,"Tamango is the story of a slave ship, during the early 1800's, on a voyage to Cuba.  Curd Jrgens plays the captain of the slave ship ~ Dorothy Dandridge plays Aiche, a mulatto/mixed slave who is also the Captain's lover.  When a new slave, Tamango (played by an unknown actor, Alex Cressan) comes aboard, he plans (with the help of the other slaves) to take over the ship so they can return back to Africa to become free again.  While they manage to take over part of the ship, they don't do as well as they planned; but they have taken Aiche hostage.  Aiche must choose to help her fellow slaves, or the Captain (who happens to own her, although he doesn't mistreat her and gives her special treatment).  Dorothy looks beautiful as usual (she grew her hair long for the role) and her acting talent shines all through out the film.  However, I am dissapointed at how cheap the movie was made. A lot of the actors voices have been dubbed (their mouths don't match what they are saying) and the sound and picture quality is not very good.  Also, the ending kind of leaves you wanting more.  ""Tamango"" never became very popular because sadly in 1959, it was banned in the United States because of the depiction of interracial romance.",985824000,10,1231,4.513513513513513
1242045,1,B00000K3UF,"please at least get the date that it was made right. It was made in 1959, NOT 1969. Ms. Dandridge had already died four years before then so it's not possible that the film came out in that year!",978739200,,195,4.0256410256410255
1242076,4,B00000K3UF,"On a slave ship carrying Africans from their homeland to slavery in the American south, a charismatic young warrior attempts to organize a revolt. Meanwhile, Dorothy Dandridge plays ship Captain Curd Jurgens' mistress, featuring interracial kissing and sexuality at a time very few American films would go near the subject. Add in that Dandridge's subjugated Lucy, torn between worlds,  is a far more empathetic and complex figure than any white character, and that Tamango and his fellow captives are shown to be in every way - morally, strategically as well as physically -- better than their white captors, and you have a film that was way ahead of it's time.

That said, there is odd flat quality in some of the drama and less than thrilling acting and film-making that keep the actual story from living up to it's potential. But it's still pretty involving, and worth seeing at least as a part of films' maturing around racial issues.

Interestingly, blacklisted director John Berry, went on to later direct another racially 'ahead of it's time' film; 1974's ""Claudine"", one of the first mainstream American films to try and intelligently deal with the struggles of poor urban African Americans without falling into exploitation, violence or clich.

The quality of the DVD is OK, but nothing thrilling.  However, given that this important film was so hard to find, it's certainly way better than nothing.",1402876800,4,1409,5.056034482758621

1242078,5,B00000K3UF,"I rate this movie five stars because it dares to tell a story of race,confused love and what could have been an unwitten part of history. The below deck scene were shown to be very close to what the history books tell us of cramp dark and dirty condition as well as the fear the slaves shared among themself.

1242079,3,B00000K3UF,"This is Dorothy taking roles she can get to stay relevant in 1950's Hollywood. The only reason I was interested is that Dorothy was a great actress and a trail blazer for her time. She should have had more roles and better roles no thanks to listening to Otto Premminger.

1242082,5,B00000K3UF,"A small production it may have been, but this a great piece of film history that has received little recognition. Because the movie has received so little recognition and small distribution, this DVD is special. No great special features dealing with the movie, but it has excellent quality for being such a rare film.",1297555200,,318,4.907407407407407
1242083,4,B00000K3UF,"This movie proved to be a nice surprise.  Dorothy was great.  She played the role of a slave woman who was subjected to her slave master's every beck and call.  The interesting thing is that in the midst of being this slave, somewhere within her, she accepts it and him.  In one scene she gets upset that she's told by the slave master's ship doctor that he has another woman.  It's very interesting... and expected, especially of a black woman during the time of slavery.  When you've been ripped away from your family and everything known and sacred to you and you're made to serve a white man who uses you not only as a work mule, but as a play thing he can have at his disposal whenever he feels the itch... you can only imagine the conditioning that you're subjected to... being actually taken by the very presence of the man who's raped you and your people figuratively and literally.  This movie came out at a time when black bodies were still being hung from trees, people still being told incessantly that they were nothing but N*ggers.  It's quite bold that a movie dealing with slave revolts and the challenging issue of the twisted relationship of a black woman with her ""master"" is put on display.  I enjoyed this movie.  The ending was powerful also.  The big sacrifice was made... when she had to decide between staying true to herself and her people or being back in the arms of the comfort of her white man's promises.",1286668800,,1435,4.501930501930502
1242084,3,B00000K3UF,"Our Dorothy had to do this B-movie because there were no other star offers from Hollywood after ""Carmen Jones"". She plays a slave here even though author Donald Bogle in his definitive Dandridge bio claims Dorothy turned down a supporting role in ""The King and I"" because she didn't want to play a slave. (Incidentally, that ""Tuptim"" role launched Rita Moreno's super long acting career!) But what's a beautiful and talented colored girl to do in racist Hollywood?  Ask Halle.

The color quality of this DVD is awful, but Dandridge gets a chance to stretch her acting skills while looking drop dead gorgeous in her late 30's.  But couldn't they have found a better wig for a tragic mulatto?  This one is right off the Korean store dummy. DD tells slaveowner Jurgens she hates when he touches her. Who can blame her?  Jurgens is gross and ugly!

One of the best scenes shows how the genuine diva flips her wig and quickly recovers after a slave spits in her pretty face.  In another scene the camera zooms in on Dorothy as she twists and jerks - with incredible style and grace - away from a grizzly old ship doctor who tries to rape her.  She moves like a haughty ballerina!  Only Dorothy Dandrige makes this movie worth watching!  But why does the movie poster make her - a slave - look like a white woman?",1265587200,3,1307,4.523404255319149

7914231,4,B00000K3UF,"When I was 7 years old I saw the ads of Tamango in the press and the cinemas as I passed them by, but when I was old enough to see it (it was classified ""for adults only"") it had vanished from sight. Now that I finally watched it, when it was finished I was in awe. What a good film! Of course it does help that the final 10 minutes are simultaneously tense and poetic leading to a highly dramatic ending. But six decades after its original release, it is still a motion picture of strong content and great visual impact (although the copy I saw is not in the original 2.35:1 aspect ratio and the colors have faded). Released in 1958 it is an adaptation of Prosper M&eacute;rim&eacute;e's 1829 homonymous novella (before he wrote his most famous Carmen). Significant changes were made for this screen version, but the final plot is also set in the early 19th century. In the coast of Guinea, warrior Tamango (Alex Cressan) and a sizable group of men and women have been sold to Reinker, a Dutch slave trader (Curt J&uuml;rgens) and they board the ship Esperanza that sets sails to Cuba, where they will be sold again, this time in the slave market. On route the violent conflict between the Caucasian sailors and the black slaves intensifies, the interracial sexual liaison between Reinker and a beautiful African woman named Aych&eacute; (Dorothy Dandridge) breaks, and Tamango leads a mutiny against the slavers. In the final script that went through significant re-writing due to Dandridge's insistence (who also refused to wear costumes that were offensive to the African woman, as designed by a Parisian designer), Aych&eacute; and Tamango are no longer lovers, he does not sell her but the two are victimized, and instead of surviving in Kingston the warrior fights until the end. These script changes turn Tamango and Aych&eacute; into icons of racial struggle, while the sincere, intense passion Reinker feels for Aych&eacute; is one of the first screen recognitions of the Europeans' desire for Africans. In the time it was made Tamango must have been some kind of a political and educational audiovisual pamphlet, invaluable for those who were involved in the fight for the civil rights of Afro-descendants in the United States and elsewhere. No wonder it was banned in a few countries, and surely not only for the Reinker-Aych&eacute; relationship. I saw the English-spoken version: it becomes a bit hard in the first scenes to accept Dandridge as an African girl, with her American accent, but one gets used to it and thankfully she only has the necessary dialogue. Cressan, a medical student from Martinique that only made this film, is a magnificent emblem of African male beauty; and J&uuml;rgens, as usual, is fine as the villain with a soft heart. Director Berry was black-listed during the witch-hunting craze led by Senator Joseph McCarthy, and, after directing the cult film He Ran All the Way, he went to Europe as Joseph Losey, Cy Endfield and Charles Chaplin. Berry also directed the romantic comedy Claudine about a couple of African-American workers, but he remained in France until his death.",1478044800,,3118,4.896030245746692

7914233,4,B00000K3UF,"Being that this film is on the Blax DVD label, it is presented in a full screen version.  Although the overall quality is good, there are a couple of instances where dialogue is interrupted by splices, along with a couple of other minor annomolies.  It seems to be the only version available and really needs a more presentable presentation.  It was a controversial film in it's time and didn't get a proper release here in the states.  It should be released in both English and original French unedited versions.",1451692800,,513,4.730337078651686
7914234,4,B00000K3UF,"""Tamango"" from 1958 is another presentation from the video releasing company Blax that brought us an unrestored but, as faithful to the original production values of Otto Preminger's and Samuel Goldwyn's 1959 film of ""Porgy and Bess.""  With ""Porgy and Bess"" there was an excuse for the lack of definition in the image as the gerswhin estate, to who the rights reverted to after the first fifteen years, did not like the film version and have denied permission for any restoration.  ""Tamango"" had problems upon release due to its, for its time, forbidden interracial love scenes for Dorothy Dandridge as a slave to Curt Jurgens, slave ship captain.  One of the captured Africans on the ship becomes a leader, who Dandridge, when a revolt causes her to choose her loyalties.  Named ""Tamango"" and played by a very good actor named Alex Cressan, who should have become more well known had the movie had a wider distribution at the time of its release.  It is a very important picture, historically.  Aside from the inter-racial kissing scenes, it is adapted from Prosper Merimee's ""Tamango"" and director John Berry later directed the comedy ""Claudine"" in 1976 with Diahann Carroll and James Earl Jones that had a soundtrack with music by Curtis Mayfield.  The movie does have some problems in that the script is somewhat confusing, but I thought it was quite intelligent moreso.  Once again, however, there is no restoration, and the film, in Cinemascope and color, is washed out  and indistinct, but it is well worth owning for its complicated and well-intentioned performances and situations.  They are not asking for a lot for it, and should deservedly be seen.",1447459200,2,1660,4.96028880866426
