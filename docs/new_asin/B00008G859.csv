7982985,1,B00008G859,"love Kendall and Jen, and have enjoyed using the original Bodyshaping video, so thought this would be a good one to try.  within the first few minutes had to stop the dvd because the camera was constantly bouncing, as tho the cameraman was doing the workout right along with them.  unfortunatly im unable to give a review of the workout itself but it is probably good.  i was quite upset at having to return this, and fortunately the place i got it allowed me a refund and i picked up a different dvd.",1186790400,3,501,4.365591397849462
