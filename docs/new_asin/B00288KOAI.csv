8355901,4,B00288KOAI,"My sons (2 1/2 and 5) both love watching this DVD. Both of them are fascinated by airplanes, especially the Blue Angels jets, and the show has a good balance between narrated video of planes flying and ""talking heads"" interviews of current and former pilots.

Only downside: the opening credit sequence (which has nothing to do with planes) is an unreasonably long 4+ minutes.",1357689600,,376,4.875
8355902,1,B00288KOAI,"First of all, only half of the two videos on the 60-minute DVD is about jet planes; the other program is about ships. My kids found both videos boring. ""Why is there so much talk?"" was their constant question! A big problem from a parent's perspective, other than too much talk that's incomprehensible to anyone under 12 or 13, is the actual clips are poorly shot and edited, making it very difficult for a child to grasp what exactly is a jet plane and what makes it fly. My kids didn't like this DVD at all.",1344988800,2,509,4.3125
8355903,4,B00288KOAI,"My sons began watching this video at age 3 and 1. They LOVE it! It is certainly educationally-focused and a little dated, but it offers excellent information and it is so much less flashy than most kids' videos (which I see as a huge plus). My sons have learned a lot and my husband, who is a pilot, says it is accurate. He enjoys watching it too!",1318377600,,347,4.1940298507462686
8355904,2,B00288KOAI,"The age range on this DVD says ages 2+. My 3 year old son who loves planes, and generally enters a zombie-like state when watching TV, was bored within 5 mins of this video. There are interviews with pilots which are very much lost on a toddler that needs action and kid-friendly voices. This may be better for a 8-year old or older. Also, the video footage looks like a series of videos from the 1980's that has been pieced together. I would not recommend for anyone under 8 and even then, it's questionable.",1293840000,3,509,4.425531914893617
