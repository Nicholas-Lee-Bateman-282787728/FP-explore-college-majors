Norman Taylor (Peter Wynegarde) a down to earth cultural anthropology professor is having extraordinarily good luck in his career and life in general. He finds his wife, Tansey (Janet Blair), has stuffed fetishes in every nook and cranny of the house. She knows that someone is out to get him but as with most movies is too dumb to tell him who it is. He on the other hand does not believe in magic. Divesting himself of all dubious protection, does he leave himself to the elements? Well we will see.
And the question will be ""Do You Believe?""",1509580800,3,639,4.508620689655173
8273626,4,B0019D7AHI,"I only know this crackerjack, black and white thriller from the mid-20th century by the title ""Burn Witch Burn!""  This is the first I've seen of the ""Night of the Eagle"" title.

The story concerns Norman Taylor (the handsomely sensual Peter Wyngarde), who teaches cultural anthropology at an English country college.  And he's doing well at it, too - he seems to be one of fortune's favorites!  He has a pretty, if high-strung wife, with the kind of quintessentially silly name, Tansy, that the English occasionally bestow on women.  Tansy (Janet Blair) is curvaceous, blonde, adoring, and well-dressed; they have a lovely home; Norman drives a sleek sports car.

And then, one day, the very modern Mr. Anthropology Professor finds out that the seemingly very modern Mrs. Anthropology Professor has rather revolting fetishes, like dried spiders, hidden all over the house, in places like drawers and lampshades.  Appalled, Norman demands that Tansy get rid of it all, over her frantic protests.  She confesses that she picked up her tricks from a practitioner in the Caribbean, where, while on vacation, Norman once got so sick he nearly died.  Tansy begged for help from the local Voodoo master and got it, and ever since has been a devotee, unbeknownst to her husband.

Tansy is frantic at her protections being dismantled because she knows that someone in college resents Norman's success and is trying to undermine him, if necessary through physical destruction.  Hence, a war of witches is quietly afoot on campus.

Needless to say, once Tansy's ""protections"" are taken down, Norman's luck begins to unravel: a student accuses him of molesting her, not only his promotion but his current position is threatened, and serious physical accidents begin to occur.  How long will it take Norman to get wise, and will it be too late by the time he does?!

Atmospheric to the nines, this film is a real ""page-turner"", so to speak, with a literate script and charismatic performances (not least among them by Wyngarde's physique, displayed at every turn in tight slacks and short-sleeved shirts with cuffs rolled over his biceps).  It is very rarely seen on television, and as I have a region-free DVD player, I plan to purchase this and add it to my collection.  If you like this kind of thing, you should add it to yours.",1218758400,3,2319,4.922879177377892
