7893864,5,6305731888,"After watching the first story, I immdiately went to my fridge and began checking expiration dates! A hilarious episode with some real intense suspense scenes. The second episode is also very enjoyable as well and shows off Spike's fighting skills well.",984960000,,253,5.195121951219512
7893865,4,6305731888,"Hot off the heels of watching a batch of episodes from another, older Sunrise animated show, the excellent ""Armored Trooper Votoms,"" we now have volume 6 of Cowboy Bebop.
For a while now, the show has been  giving us many adventures for our crew, but one thing that it has been  lacking is depth of plotting.
This volume finally pulls together most of  the show's virtues and delivers a nearly five-star show.
First up is  episode 11, one truly unique and amusing episode that ranks as my favourite  ""quirky"" Cowboy Bebop episode. The suspense is slowly built up as  an alien on board the ship is systematically taking out most of the crew,  and the ending is a wacky hoot. Ed is great again.
Next is episode 12,  ""Jupiter Jazz--Part I"". This is probably the most serious and  intense episode yet, with Spike looking for Julia in a cold planet only to  run into Vicious again, and Faye truly hitting a low spot in her life. It's  much more grim in many respects, and the characters here are probably at  their ugliest, as many of their character flaws are exhibited to their  fullest extent.
The show is coming along as one of my favourite  ""new"" shows in a while.",955670400,,1164,4.507177033492823
