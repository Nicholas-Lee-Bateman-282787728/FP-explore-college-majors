Great price too.  I suggest you buy it because you'll want to watch it over & over.",1339372800,,151,3.6875
4899796,4,B005WLC87K,"I worked in the area of Traffic Enforcement for most of my career which is what drew me to this DVD.  I am also originally from Florida and grew up there so I was very familiar with the FHP (as most Floridian's call it).  I was curious about the training and day to day operations of the FHP and for the price, figured it was a good deal.  Overall, the DVD is a good production.  The show follows a class of recruits throughout their academy from day one to graduation.  It also follows the day to day operation of State Troopers in the performance of their duties similar to an episode of COPS.  I think most people would enjoy this show, and it is a must for anyone considering a career as a State Trooper, no matter what state you are planning on applying for.  It gives you the basics of what a State Trooper (similar to most States) would do on a daily basis.  Florida Highway Patrol (like every other State in the United States) are a very professional organization and had I remained in Florida after the military, I would have applied to be a State Trooper as I did this type of work for the majority of my career, though, not as a State Trooper.  This is a good, fairly in depth showing of the day to day operations of the FHP.  One thing I think would have made it better, is to have gone more in depth of some of the office work required of most police officers.  The not so fun part of writing extensive reports and documenting everything that you do.  Most, if not all of the shows about police do not show the majority of what police do, REPORTS and report writing.  75% of your career as a cop, Deputy, Trooper, Officer, etc. etc. etc. is going to be spent WRITING REPORTS.  If you don't like writing and your not fairly proficient at writing, then having a career in law enforcement is not for you, I assure you.  It is one of the biggest functions of your entire career.  Sure, there are many moments of excitement and having fun and doing a lot of good things for the community, but you better love writing, because that is the bulk of what police do.  Which really surprises me that the primary part of the job is rarely shown or known by the general public.  Probably half your shift, depending on where you work, will be spent writing reports or other paperwork.  If your in college for criminal justice, do yourself a huge favor, take a lot of classes in English, writing, and composition.  You'll be very glad you did once you get hired and start your career.  Another thing is become very efficient in TYPING.  I took typing for many years in both middle and high school and I got laughed at a lot.  Once I started my career, I was the one laughing.  People were amazed I could type over 100 words per minute without mistakes and I could finish my reports in minutes.  This was in the early 80's too, before we used computers and computers in the car, but typing is a skill I have used through my entire career.

Overall, TROOPERS is a good DVD and it's enjoyable to watch, especially if you like cop shows.",1334102400,3,3031,4.310954063604241
4899797,5,B005WLC87K,Just a taste of what it was really like. 121 second to none. Black and Tan will always stand. Best time of my life...!,1332892800,,118,3.9583333333333335
4899798,4,B005WLC87K,"After 26 years doing this job, I am glad to see that someone documented what it takes to be a trooper. The job can get considerably more dirty than what is presented and definetely more fast paced, but overall, it depicts a general feel for academy life and what is driving the recruits to finish. Despite being criticized for only doing traffic, I think I would have highlighted just how many Troopers have given their lives on the job. I was glad to see many of the different tasks Troopers fulfill offering different opportunities to the Trooper in the field and giving a recruit, perhaps, something to strive for. And yes, the best job is and always will be K-9.",1323561600,5,666,4.558333333333334
4899799,5,B005WLC87K,I'm VERY grateful for this dvd. I start my journey to the FHP in Feb 2015 and this dvd helped me to get a feel of how the academy is like and it just makes me want to join even more. I can't wait!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1405728000,2,212,3.840909090909091

4899803,5,B005WLC87K,I thought this video was very good. As a retired FHP trooper it brought back memories. I must say since 1972 the training academy has got more demanding. I recommend this video to anyone interested in being a FHP Trooper or just interested in what it takes to be a trooper.,1381968000,,273,4.372549019607843
4899804,3,B005WLC87K,"The organization (FHP) is one of the best in the Country.  Due to the fact its reality TV, it placed holds on the Cadre, for some recruits needed adjustment with their attitude. The cadre had to hold back some with their adjustment and for this reason and this reason only a three rating is given.",1379808000,,297,4.4
4899805,5,B005WLC87K,I really enjoyed this documentary on the Florida State Highway Patrol (FHP). This DVD gives the viewer an inside look at the dedication and hard training that FHP law enforcement personnel have to endure to become one of the finest in uniform that protects our streets and highways. My hat is off to all law enforcement personnel for their dedication and service to uphold the law. Keep up the good work.,1369699200,2,404,4.704225352112676

4899808,5,B005WLC87K,"Having worked for FHP many years ago, I just had to get this DVD when I saw it available.  It brought back so many memories, both funny and sad.  The beginning of training and watching the recruits was funny to watch, but scary in real life.  The death of the trooper was very sad, and the other troopers emotions show just how closeknit the FHP family is.  I knew two troopers taht were killed while working for FHP, and it's something that never goes away.  Very good DVD if you're interested in Law Enforcemnt.",1342483200,,513,4.414893617021277
