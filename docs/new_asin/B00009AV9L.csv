1882723,5,B00009AV9L,"I, as a straight guy, just had to write a review. I found the short films touching and amazingly well-done. Definately for anyone who has a human heart. The themes ran the gamut from love-lost and new love found, these are universal human stories!",1083542400,18,247,4.636363636363637
1882724,5,B00009AV9L,"These are the best lesbian short films I have seen.  ""Interview with my Next Girlfriend"" is hilarious and I would get this DVD just for that one.  The namesake of the collection, ""Watching You"", is in a different language, so you have to read subtitles which is only a small distraction.  The short titled ""10 rules"" or something like that is very funny, though I think they could have come up with some more creative ""rules"" (in the spirit of the ""ironic but true"" thing they were going for).",1077840000,31,493,4.51685393258427
1882725,2,B00009AV9L,"It is OK not too bad, but I do not want to pay for OK...this is a rental...nice cast over acting and writing is stilted...nice effort....hopefully their next project will be better...there was potential there",1076544000,8,208,4.9714285714285715
1882726,5,B00009AV9L,"If only all lesbian movies or shorts could be as good as this collection, then lesbians would find more commercial success at the box office. I agree that the women were attractive, the plots were fun and the collection in general is one worth owning. Skip straight to the short called, ""The Ten Rules: A Lesbian Survival Guide"" which is located in the bonus section of the movies. That one will have you laughing out loud if you are familiar with the lesbian community and their quirks/stereotypes. Very FUNNY! The title short, ""Watching You"" is a little more serious and covers the topics of obsession, drama and real life. It is set in Israel (I think) so it gives a foreign-Middle Eastern lesbian perspective, which I have never seen on film. I highly recommend you purchase this dvd -- it is a rarity.",1075593600,17,806,4.643356643356643
1882727,5,B00009AV9L,"I have never been compelled to write a review of a movie, so the fact that I am doing so for this collection speaks volumes. I have seldom seen such quality in short films, the acting is excellent, and the production values are high. The films are varied, all are brilliant. I promise that you won't be disappointed when you move this video to the top of your shopping queue.",1075075200,9,375,4.371428571428571
1882728,4,B00009AV9L,"This was a good collection of lesbian shorts. Good enough that I have bought it. The good thing about short films is that unlike a two hour film there is no time to waste with filler or subplots that don't work. This collection has it all, buy it.",1070582400,6,247,4.166666666666667
1882729,2,B00009AV9L,A collection of stories which are short on substance and high on marketing. Found them trivial overdone repeated themes of past shorts and films.,1070236800,3,145,5.083333333333333
1882730,1,B00009AV9L,"These shorts were short on substance and script...A nice set up but not worth over one star...If you want to see a good lesbian flick go buy ""A Family Affair"" or the old classic ""desert hearts"" or Sayles film ""Lianna"" Those films are more worth your money if you buy anything...",1069459200,3,278,4.470588235294118
1882731,5,B00009AV9L,"Wolfe Video has pulled out all the stops on ""Watching You."" The short films on this DVD were entertaining and funny. They were well made,the women in it are very attractive and the stories were realistic. The film ""10 Rules to Being a Lesbian"" was hilarious and sort of a newbies guide to lesbianism. The other film ""Interview For My Next Girlfriend"" was absolutely hilarious as well, where the filmmaker interviews all different sorts of lesbians and poses various questions to them and their answers are wildly entertaining. You'll be laughing. The longest short film in the group is ""Watching You,"" which was touching and sensuous. I've never seen such a great collection of lesbian films as this one. All these short films are worth seeing",1066262400,22,743,4.904761904761905
1882732,5,B00009AV9L,"WATCHING YOU contains eight lesbian short films that will certainly entertain you. Some are of a serious nature (""Dear Emily"" and ""Watching You"") while others are fun and hilarious (""The Ten Rules: A Lesbian Survival Guide"" and ""Interviews With My Next Girlfriend""). I was pleasantly surprised of the depth and quality of each film. I highly recommend this DVD to others who enjoy good short films. Enjoy!",1061164800,39,405,5.059701492537314

7990549,3,B00009AV9L,"If you want lots of erotica, this will disapoint.  However, this collection contains humor, thoughtful connections, drama, and a sort of avant garde feel of diversity. The filming isn't Hollywood with its millions, but that doesn't necessarily take away from the entertainment value.  Worth the price of a used DVD!",1164067200,,315,5.28

7990552,4,B00009AV9L,"After going thru all the shorts, I think three will stand out and you will find yourself watching it again.  These three are ""Traveling Companion"" ""Watching you"" and ""Interview with my next Girlfriend.""  My favorite is ""Traveling Companion"" because it epitomizes the classical short film format.  The story and how it is told, is subtle and engaging.  The central character is played wonderfully by Susan Savage, a travel writer who is looking for a travel companion.  Her partner has recently died of breast cancer and the loneliness is etched on her face.  She spends her days interviewing potentials at Santa Monica's Little Frieda coffee shop (where can I get that T-shirt?), enter a young, pretty waitress (Suzanne Mara) and the underpinnings of a May-December romance. A lot has been layed out about the characters in an unhurried way and  the actors are so crafted in conveying this, that it feels like a full length film.  I also like ""Watching You"" maybe because of the foreigness of the movie, I mean when was the last time you actually watched an Israeli movie but aside this, the characters are well defined and the story moves along evenly.  The actresses are very pretty and were able to relate the sadnesss of their characters in the movie.  It is melancholic and like ""Traveling Companion,"" it is able to transcends the short story format aptly.  And lastly, I picked ""Interview with my next Girlfriend""  just for the comic relief value.  Straight or gay, don't we all wish we could interview our next partners?  The interviewees were hilarious and wide ranging from the scary lesbo dykes, to the ultra femme nuerotic grad student, to the tailored suit corporate raider.  This little short certainly brought out a few chuckles out of me.  Over all this is a good collection of Short Films that is better than most that are out there.",1150934400,5,1849,4.840764331210191
7990553,4,B00009AV9L,"Ironically, Watching You is the least watchable of these films, but the others are definitely worth viewing.  They are witty, sexy, funny and at times downright hilarious.  This is one of the few lesbian-themed DVDs that was worth my time and money.",1122595200,,249,4.904761904761905
7990554,2,B00009AV9L,"i was very dissapointed from this DVD i bought.

i think it's not worth the money.

it's a pretty old collection of short lesbo movies which i allready have seen the last 5 years in differet occasions.

very dissapointing.",1095984000,,222,4.641025641025641
