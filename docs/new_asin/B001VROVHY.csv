3823684,5,B001VROVHY,"This dvd is great! any BDM fan can agree its worth the cash the live perfomances are really good not all practiced like some bands, and as far as disc 1(the backstage stuff)really shows you how down to earth the members really are 5 stars get this dvd!!!",1245283200,,254,4.3125
3823685,5,B001VROVHY,"When I bought this I didn't know what to expect but being a huge fan of the band I had to buy it whether it be bad or good but this is now in the front of my music dvd collection. Majesty isn't your common metal dvd because let's face it most dvd's in this genre show's a little partying here and there some live performances and then it's over. Make no mistake there is a lot of partying, 7 music videos and 11 awesome live shows but this dvd contains a two hour documentary that is solely focused on the band and what they are all about. TBDM is not your run of the mill metal outfit they in no way take themselves too seriously as shown by their many hobbies that include: long boarding, smoking weed, eating, drinking, or dressing up like Scooby Doo for a show no matter what you know they are there to have the best time. The good thing is you can tell that all the guys in the band actually like each other and they are all friends in fact Bart and Brian live across the street from one other and hilarity ensues. This dvd shows that bands can still be absolutely brutal but in the end they are just regular guys who's parents still come to their shows. This dvd is awesome you will not be disappointed it's something that you will want to watch over and over again I promise.",1243900800,4,1282,4.152610441767068
