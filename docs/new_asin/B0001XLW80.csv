8018086,5,B0001XLW80,"This reminds me of the X-Files but there is NO FBI or law enforcement aspect to it.  Thus, there are also no governmental conspiracies to cover.  Thus our team of PhDs from a university in the UK can concentrate solely on their cases which form the basis for their research.  There are presently four seasons of this show but the release of episodes is slower in the USA.

Our heroes are in the paranormal department of Clyde University.  Their efforts are largely sneered at by the university as a whole but they carry on nonetheless.  People turn to them in desperation when something inexplicable disrupts their lives.  We open with two twins who were separated at birth but who find one another when they are middle aged.  The investigators find strong paranormal abilities running between these two.  Things take a sudden turn for the worse though when one twin wants to take over the other's life.

Even better is an episode involving a little boy who is the reincarnation of a girl who died in a remote Scot village.  They all travel to this village to unravel his prior life.

8018087,5,B0001XLW80,"I have seen some of the episodes in HBO, in my country, Brazil, first almost by chance, then I discovered that it was really an amazing series. First, this series is about a Parapsychological Department in a University (in this case, in Scotland) that investigates ""paranormal"" phenomenon with a scientific approach. The leader of the paranormal investigators is Dr. Douglas Monaghan, played by the actor Bill Paterson, an incredible character. There are two more researchers, one a young skeptic man and a charming Indian woman that is a believer of paranormal issues. The episodes that I have seen portrayed cases of supposed reincarnation, voodoo, psicometry, and other themes very interesting for the paranormal researcher. But the great charm of this serie is the utmost scientific approach and the seriousness of the investigators. It almost seems like a medical/psychological research! They treat themathics as complex and controversial as reincarnation as it were a reality waiting to be thoroughtly investigated and eventually proven, as a scientist that was waiting to prove the existence of a new specimen of life or a new cure for a disease! The objective, no-nonsense approach to subjects that until recently were the exclusive domain of the mystics is for me the most appealing trait of this unusual mini-series. And it was very sucessful, because now it is in the third season (in HBO)!
I recommend this very charming and unusual series. If you believe (or not) in  Parapsychology, you will love the unusual approach.",1211846400,3,1532,5.202429149797571
