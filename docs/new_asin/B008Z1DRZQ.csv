8532912,4,B008Z1DRZQ,I love all Margaret Richard videos.  I like that they are 30 minutes long.  This isn't as good as the Best of Margaret Richards but close enough!,1483574400,2,145,4.333333333333333
8532913,2,B008Z1DRZQ,"Not anything like her show! I was very disappointed,it only covers a few exercises, and they are all upper body. I should have sent it back!",1451433600,3,140,4.423076923076923
8532914,5,B008Z1DRZQ,"i have worked out with maggie for many years. she left me in good enough shape so that when i retired, i retired on a farm i can lift 60lb. bales of hay among other things at age 69. this workout is still challenging but i can modify and choose my work effectively no boredom.",1427587200,6,276,4.036363636363636
8532915,5,B008Z1DRZQ,"I have a number of Margaret Richard's workouts and this is one of my favorites. Margaret's enthusiasm and excellent ability to explain, demonstrate and teach the different exercises to her viewers makes the workout truly enjoyable. It is almost like she is right in your living room, personally instructing you. She provides a thorough workout for all parts of the body, and you can choose what you want to do, as there is a menu option. Very little equipment is needed, and she emphasizes adjusting the workout for your personal fitness level so that you do not feel overwhelmed at first if you are unfamiliar with her types of workouts. The workouts do their job, too- in no time you start to feel the changes in your muscles, your flexibility and your strength, I would highly recommend this for anyone of any age- although she herself is a baby-boomer, her exercises are her signature classics.",1424908800,6,898,4.8

8532917,5,B008Z1DRZQ,MR is a real inspiration on this DVD as usual. I'm grateful she continues to encourage the boomer generation to empower their selves and stay strong or get stronger.,1399334400,3,165,4.724137931034483
8532918,5,B008Z1DRZQ,"I love this dvd. Margaret Richard is so low key and down to earth like she's right in my living room encouraging me. Every single body part is worked. I was looking for this type of workout for a long time. I really felt the work done in a good way. This is also a thorough workout. I actually stopped at 120 minutes so I definitely got my money's worth. There is a menu so if I am pressed for time, I can choose which sections I want to work. There is time to get into postion and Margaret says in advance what will be worked and if the weights or ball is needed. She also makes it unintimidating -  a ball can even be bought at a dollar store. She makes it a point to stretch the muscles that were worked. This is an excellent workout and perfect for me.",1380326400,13,756,4.006622516556291
8532919,5,B008Z1DRZQ,"Margaret Richard's Body Electric was my favorite morning workout, our local broadcast quit showing it, and I had not found an enjoyable replacement until I found these DVD's at a great price!",1367020800,8,191,5.0
