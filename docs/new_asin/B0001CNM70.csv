Yes, the story is silly, but it does give the children the sections of the orchestra and the sounds of many of the instruments.  They have always enjoyed it, and for children that have no musical orchestra background, this is a place to start.",1402704000,,305,4.527272727272727
8010019,1,B0001CNM70,"As a music teacher, I am constantly looking for new ways to introduce and reinforce the instruments to my K-3 students.  Unfortunately, this video is not of any use to music teachers.  The story line offers no information about instruments, orchestras, or anything musical.  (Even my students thought the story was pretty silly.)  I had hoped that there would be examples of each instrument's sound, but even that was missing.  I guess this video would be passably entertaining for very small children, but it is of absolutely no value for music teachers.",1106524800,,555,4.989130434782608
