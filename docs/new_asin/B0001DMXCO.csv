8010824,4,B0001DMXCO,"I borrowed a bunch from the library to choose the best ones, and I found this series to be pretty decent. Having it split up in the instructional part and the routine part is a help.

However, this is really not beginner material! Frankly, the recordings that are out there for beginners are either so simple that you'd get bored with them within weeks, or too hard for beginners. So I can recommend this as a supplement for those taking a beginning Yoga class for a month or two so they can practice at home.",1312675200,2,509,4.3578947368421055
8010825,5,B0001DMXCO,"I really like this DVD for light yoga; this second disc is quite a bit less of a ""workout"" than the first disc.  I got the first disc, then the third (and couldn't do any of it-- too advanced), then this second one.  They are all very different.  The first one is very good for stretching the lower body and tones your quads very well (with the length that you stay in the warrior poses), and the third one is more advanced poses with a lot of headstand variations, but this one stretches your core a lot.  There are a lot of poses that stretch your back and a couple that get your abs really well.  I feel very loose and relaxed when I'm done.  ""The resting pose"" at the end of your session is several minutes long, unlike in the first disc, and allows deeper relaxation.  I would recommend this disc to everyone.",1259798400,,814,4.246753246753247
8010826,5,B0001DMXCO,I really like this Yoga video. It flows vey nice and Natasha has such a soothing way and voice. Highly recommend.,1194393600,,113,4.428571428571429
8010827,5,B0001DMXCO,I have Yoga Step by Step Vol. 1 and 2.  I love them both! Natasha moves a little fast though.  I like the fact that Jason is on there for those who can't get into some positions.  I've been doing yoga for years now and I enjoy these videos.,1167696000,2,240,3.857142857142857
8010828,5,B0001DMXCO,"I have been suffering from back pain for the past year or so and back bends have been very helpful in taking some of that pain away. The instruction on this dvd is superb. After watching the dvd once I realized that I wasn't doing the asanas perfectly. Just one session of the yoga practice on the dvd made me feel far better that I had in months. Natasha takes great care to explain alignment, breath and modifications for each of the asanas covered.  There are many very useful features on this including chalk talk, and watching a beginner practice the asanas which were especially useful. Truly an excellant video.",1162252800,5,618,4.618181818181818
8010829,5,B0001DMXCO,"According to a recent study, 15 million people in America are now practicing yoga. 8.7 million are beginning students and 7 million practice yoga at home.

If you love Yoga, then you might want to experience the Yoga Journal's Step by Step series. This is for students of yoga who have mastered the first instructional session in Yoga Step by Step Session 1. Natasha Rizopoulos leads you through backbends, twists and forward bends.

Yoga can help you fully relax and prepare for meditation or just feel more relaxed while reading or cooking. Your mind will be cleansed and while the world surges around you in all directions, there will be an inner calm you can carry with you all day.

I'd consider myself to be intermediate and the workout on this DVD seemed to be an intermediate workout with some challenging bending and twisting poses. It is a healing workout that may be enjoyed by intermediate yoga students who are looking for challenging backbends and twists.

Natasha Rizopoulos has a beautiful teaching style that allows you to fully experience the body mind connection. She encourages you to experience yoga in order to balance your life. After watching her Yoga demonstration you may start to think of Yoga as an art form and not just an exercise routine. She turns yoga into ballet and her upper body strength is astounding. Upper body strength will be especially important in this DVD.

I'd ""highly"" recommend buying two beveled foam yoga blocks (if you have yet to buy them) and a yoga strap along with this DVD. Modifying the balancing poses with props is advised.

This DVD has interesting menu options. There are really two main parts:

A 35 minute tutorial - You explore the postures in depth
20 minutes of uninterrupted flowing practice - a vigorous vinyasa flow sequence

You can follow the Instruction Menu, Practice Menu, go straight to the Yoga Chalk Talk (a great way to explore the poses) or Medical Commentary. The Practice menu has four sections:

Begin Practice (Different from Begin Instruction)

Follow Jason Crandell - This is an excellent option if you want to use props like blocks. Jason demonstrates modifications for those who have less flexibility.

Practice with Medical Commentary
Practice without Music

This is the second DVD in a series of three high-quality yoga packages. You will need blocks and a mat. Even after years of yoga practice, it is exciting to find out there is so much more to learn. This is a must-have series for anyone who is interested in yoga. I personally think this is intermediate or can be done by individuals with good upper body strength and balance.

Natasha Rizopoulos teaches at Yoga Works in Santa Monica, CA and have studied with Sri K. Pattabhi Jois in Mysore, India. She teaches at conferences and has appeared in YOGA, a photography book featuring the country's top yoga teachers.
