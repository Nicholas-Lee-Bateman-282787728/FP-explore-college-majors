8696658,5,B00RZXWWMY,"It doesn't matter how bad this movie is, it still gets 5 stars for Ted Mikels, whose body of work (and i use the term advisedly) comprised over 100 films. If you have any involvement with the industry, you can appreciate the gigantic task of making just ONE movie, no matter how good or bad or what the budget is.  Mikels was a genius in this regard. And in honor of his passing today, 5 stars.",1476921600,,394,4.184210526315789

8696660,4,B00RZXWWMY,"The leading lady is adorable and very cute, hope to see her in more movies. I liked the concept and being a huge fan of micro-cinema I can easily forget bad special effects and bad acting. The cast won me over.

My biggest complain would be it was a bit too long. Too many characters that add nothing to the plot (and I mean nothing)This would've been better at 70 or 75 minutes.",1461628800,,379,4.191780821917808
8696661,1,B00RZXWWMY,"I realize many movies are made to stroke the egos and validate the creators. But this one is on another level of self indulgence. All I really needed to see was the cover to know how horribly cliche it would be. Seriously, look at that cover. I'm so glad the ""terrifying specter"" is holding up the cellphone because I never would have known it involved a communication device. Oh wait, ""Texts from the dead"" is in the title. Covering all bases I guess.

But examine the cover a bit more and we see the tried-and-true formula of self indulgent rubbish, ""A Ted V Mikels Film."" Because, clearly, you need to let all your unemployed friends at the local coffeehouse who the real ""artist"" is.

As horrific (and not in the scary sense) as this movie is...as laughable as the cover art, I can't for the life of me understand why anybody would be proud to have their name listed boldly above the title. Mr. Mikels, I hope this satisfied your ego but I would recommend dropping out of that ""Tyler Perry's Guide to Film"" class from your local Community College.

Awful. Awful. Awful.",1460937600,,1073,4.549222797927461

8696663,1,B00RZXWWMY,"The movie just didn't really flow together and the ending was really lame. I was expecting more interactions with mobile devices base of the title, but it was just one small part. Real let down.",1460332800,,194,4.571428571428571
8696664,1,B00RZXWWMY,"This is the absolute WORST movie I have ever watched.  I thought it HAD to get better, so I kept watching it.  But not even half way through it I kept checking how many more minutes were left remaining.  The LONGEST bad movie I have ever watched.  Amazon Prime gives us free movies, etc.  If this is the best you can do, then shame on you.  This doesn't even rate a half star.  And don't even ask me about that totally awful platinum wig she wore.  Worst.movie.ever.",1459987200,2,466,4.275862068965517
8696665,1,B00RZXWWMY,"Paranormal Extremes: Text Messages from the Dead is just flat-out awful.  The storyline is terrible and full of gaps, the special effects are embarrassingly bad, the acting is stale and oftentimes painful to watch, and the editing is just atrocious, with no transition between one scene and the next.  Most of the homemade videos youll find on YouTube have a higher production quality than this film. Some plot elements seemed to have been added on a whim midway through the story, and the ending makes this whole bitter pill even harder to swallow.

The film stars Colie Knoke as Addison London, a young model who begins seeing and hearing things in the wake of a personal tragedy.  After consulting everyone from a tarot card reader to a neurologist, she finally begins to face the fact that scores of dead spirits are trying to communicate with her.  Ill bet you're thinking they communicate with her via text messages  you are thinking that, aren't you?  Well, you're quite wrong.  She only receives a couple of text messages from one spirit  and she pretty much just ignores those.  Knoke does a horrible job playing the part of a distraught and scared woman battling grief and an unceasing assault by spirits looking for help  and, unfortunately, shes probably the best actor/actress in the entire film.

Most movies this bad have a comparatively short runtime, but Paranormal Extremes drags on for an excruciating 100+ minutes.  Most viewers won't make it through the first ten.  It really is that bad.",1439596800,3,1509,4.889763779527559
8696666,1,B00RZXWWMY,"Pacing is horrible, acting is terrible, wasted film having nothing to do with the plot, and a cast from city college drama. Even with an obvious $380.00 budget, at most, they ended up with change left over. Why didn't they use that change to hire real actors or even a skilled director? Why did they allow Knoke to pose in a bikini? That was the scariest part of the movie.",1437523200,2,373,4.3428571428571425
