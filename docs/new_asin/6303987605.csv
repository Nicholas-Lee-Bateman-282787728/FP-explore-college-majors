7858747,3,6303987605,"""The Devil Horse"" is a 12-chapter Mascot serial from 1932, directed by Otto Brower, with story by George Morgan, Barney Sarecky, George Plympton and Wyndham Gittens.

Two horse thieves, Canfield and Boyd (Noah Beery, Sr. and John Paul Jones) had robbed and killed a rancher (Lew Kelly), whose young son (Carli Russell, a.k.a. Carl R. Botefuhr, age 6) then grew up with wild horses.  Now known as the ""Wild Boy"" (Frankie Darro), he again encounters the two villains, who have become ""respectable citizens,"" a rancher and a banker.  This time they kill a state ranger, Elliott Norton (Lane Chandler) while trying to steal a race horse, El Diablo (Apache) who escapes and joins the wild herd.  The dead ranger's older brother, Bob (Harry Carey), also a State Ranger, goes after the outlaws, encountering not only the Wild Boy, but also a mysterious band of horsemen, trying to capture the ""devil horse"" for Canfield, who seem to have some connection with Linda Weston (Greta Granstedt) and her brother Lee (Barrie O'Daniels).  Bob Norton discovers that his brother's death was witnessed by the Wild Boy, who unfortunately has forgotten how to speak.

The plot has similarities to that of the earlier Mascot serial ""The Vanishing Legion.""  There are strong performances by both the hero and chief villain, and remarkable stunt work including some by Yakima Canutt.  No question for the audience as to the identity of the main bad guys, but the mysterious horsemen provide a guessing game in the early chapters.  The ""Wild Boy"" variant on Tarzan takes some suspension of disbelief, especially his knowing only the language of the horses when he was doing well enough at English before his father's death.  But issues of this kind are easily overlooked with the serial-movie format of one chapter per week.  The fight scenes are as expected from Mascot, with a lot of arm-swinging and no background music -- sound mixing was a problem for small film producers in 1932 -- and surprisingly Harry Carey doesn't always win, even when only a couple bad guys are involved.  Also typical for a Mascot serial, there are quite a few ""flashbacks"" with rerun action footage from previous chapters.  Several serial and ""B"" western regulars are present, including Al Bridge as chief henchman Curley Bates, Jack Mower as Vigilante leader Mark Adams, Edward Peil, Sr. as the Sheriff, and in the first chapter William Desmond as the Ranger Captain.

The familiar theme music, from Rossini's ""William Tell"" overture, is an earlier usage than ""The Lone Ranger,"" which didn't air on radio until a couple months after this serial was released.  Other ""classical"" music is used, occasionally mixed with the dialogue.  The introductions, which describe all the murders, violence and mayhem of the previous chapters, are accompanied by a rather cheerful section of the overture to Herold's ""Zampa.""  Lee Zahler was the music director for this serial.

Alpha's DVD edition, # ALP 5617D is on a single disc, and while the image isn't too bad for an Alpha release, it isn't very sharp and it looks a little muddy, though the highlights don't wash out.  Sometimes there is ripple in the intensity and quite a bit of video noise.  The print shows occasional fading, some splices interrupt the sound, though mostly during the chapter introductions, and one of the ""next week"" titles was ""recreated"" along with another title in Chapter One.  There are some rough ""splices"" from video editing where the opening credits join the chapter titles.  The image is framed fairly well, though in some of the ""last week"" text the final line goes partially off-screen.  The sound is a worse problem; while the dialogue isn't hard to understand, there is dynamic compression of the ""auto-level"" variety, so the background noise becomes quite loud and it makes a real mess of percussive effects such as gunshots, which often vanish in the sonic fog.  Some extra sound effects have been added to try to compensate for these defects, mostly horse noises, but it wasn't done well, the sudden appearance of high frequencies is all too obvious.  On this release Alpha does not put their logo in the frame during all of the credits, but includes a copyright notice for the ""special edition"" during the opening titles, less annoying even if it covers the original credit for Disney Film Recording Co.

VCI's old VHS edition, # 1733 is from a different video source.  It has a sharper picture, and after viewing Alpha's DVD it is a joy to watch.  While not ideal either, with chapters Ten and Eleven having some horizontal jitter noticed mostly in the titles, the gray scale is better than Alpha's, and the sound far more representative of what was possible in 1932 films, with gunshots sounding pretty much as they should, and the background hiss is mostly at a constant low level.  Further, the film is more complete, the first chapter running a minute and a half longer, and the titles that had to be recreated by Alpha are present in their original form.  The framing is about the same as Alpha's, though different chapters have the slightly off-screen text.

This is a good Mascot serial, which should be of interest to fans of Harry Carey and Noah Beery, but much as I would like to encourage Alpha's attempts at restoration, their release has little to recommend it over VCI's VHS edition, other than availability and that it fits better in a DVD player.  It is better than many from Alpha and fairly cheap, so it might do for those curious about the serial and tolerant of poor sound, but the serial deserves a better DVD transfer.",1324857600,2,5582,4.880296610169491
7858748,4,6303987605,"The only connection between ALPHA's serial version of THE DEVIL HORSE and the silent film of 8 years earlier is Yakima Canutt-- he starred in the original and directs the 2nd unit on this one. These westerns are quite different plotwise (the 1926 movie was scripted by Stan Laurel!).

DEVIL HORSE TRIVIA--

The film career of Western superstar Harry Carey (Bob Norton) began in 1909. He worked with great directors like Griffith, Hawks and Ford. When Carey died in 1947 he was buried in a cowboy outfit.

Noah Beery (Canfield) was Wallace's older brother. He specialized in playing villains.

Frankie Darro (Wild Boy) was the son of circus aerialists. He never grew taller than 5' 3"" so Darro was forced to do all his own stunts (there was no one his size to double for him). After his acting career ended, Darro became a stuntman himself.

Al Bridge (Curley Bates) often played the bad guy in Hopalong Cassidy programmers.

El Diablo was portrayed by Apache; the horse was also western 'B' film star Bob Baker's mount.

Yakima Canutt got no screen credit as both ""Slim"" and a henchman. Also in uncredited parts: Lane Chandler and Robert Walker.",1218153600,,2304,4.927648578811369
