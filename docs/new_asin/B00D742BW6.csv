8590185,5,B00D742BW6,"Exquisite video, the photography is beautiful. I had seen this video on PBS and selling for $90 and this is the same video. I have not been to Canada and had no idea it was so beautiful and diverse in its landscapes.",1425945600,2,216,4.166666666666667
8590186,2,B00D742BW6,Only shows a few big cities and that is well done. Would have loved to see some of the rest of Canada like all the little villages NE of Vancouver.,1422662400,,147,3.933333333333333

8590190,3,B00D742BW6,"I absolutely love the content of the program...mostly.  They skipped over Winnipeg.  It seems like a big enough and significant enough city to at least mention.  But even without that, I'd give the content 5 stars because you can't cover everything.

I took off 2 stars because the video quality is horrible for DVD.  It is very grainy and definitely below typical DVD quality, which is distracting at moments.  When doing flyovers, pixelation takes away from the immersion into the content.  I remember seeing this program on PBS in HD quality, so I hope one day it appears on blu ray.  But considering it took forever for the DVD to hit the market, I won't hold my breath.",1392508800,5,674,4.6525423728813555
8590191,5,B00D742BW6,"As a resident of WA state, I have only strayed north of the border to see British Columbia. So I was thrilled to get this DVD and see some of the amazingly beautiful sites of the rest of Canada.  The narration was articulate, almost poetic, and I have replayed the DVD several times.  I do wish the producers had included something about the more northern parts of the country.  Despite that, it's worth the time to watch this program.  I met a Canadian once who vehemently stated, ""We are not an extension of the United States!""  From what I saw in this DVD, I am convinced he was absolutely right! Canadians have a story that is uniquely their own and very much worth hearing and seeing..",1388620800,6,690,4.444444444444445
