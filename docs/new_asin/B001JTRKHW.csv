3660697,5,B001JTRKHW,"Don't ever let anyone ever tell you not to take on 'the giant'. We did, and we won. All of us who wrote, called and e-mailed Universal made a difference. Obviously Universal didn't make the money they wanted to, so they sold the rights to Shout! Factory.  Universal . .  I still think you are a money grubbing conglomerate that ditches old shows and actors like trash. After the money Jameson and Gerald made for you . . .  and that is what they get. Nice. Shout! Factory . . . thank you so much. Not only do we finally get rolling with the rest of the Simon's cases, but we already have Adam-12, SCTV and many more thanks to this company. Now that we rallied to slam Universal, let's make sure we thank Shout! Factory just as much. Send them a 'thanks' at shout@b3custserv.com
And I thank all of you fellow fans of San Diego's finest private investigation firm (no, not Peerless Detectives, sorry Myron) for your voice in this matter. And now that the Sleuth channel has removed the boys from their line-up, this may be all we have for some time. This all may seem a bit much for 'just a t.v. show', but S & S is my favorite show of all time and I sincerely thank you for helping in getting this ball rolling.
Thank you
Andy

3660698,4,B001JTRKHW,"It's about time SHOUT released this 1982-83 Season of SIMON & SIMON on DVD, since they've already had SIMON & SIM0N's 1st Season out on DVD for the passed 2 years now along with the fact that SIMON & SIMON's 2nd Season was also quite an upgrade from this detective drama's First Season and when the Simon Bros. started hitting their stride since this was the season when this show started to walk, but the 1st Season was when this show was just starting to crawl, kind of like the ROCKFORD FILES did and like many other shows did.

As a matter of fact, SIMON & SIMON's Second Season was also the season when I started watching this private detective drama more often, especially since it was more sophisticated with more action in it than the First Season was.

Additionally, SIMON & SIMON was like a pioneer in many ways, because for one thing SIMON & SIMON was probably the first private detective show that took place here in San Diego instead of L.A., or New York, or even San Francisco. For another, SIMON & SIMON was definitely one of the first private detective shows about 2 brothers who ran a private dicks agency, which in this case was in Downtown San Diego.

For another, SIMON & SIMON was one of the first private detective dramas about 2 private investigators working together to solve cases, unlike most other private detective shows like the ROCKFORD FILES, MAGNUM, P.I.; MATT HOUSTON, and MANNIX, since most other private investigators like Rockford(James Garner), Magnum(Tom Selleck), Houston(Lee Horsley),and Mannix(Mike Connors) all worked solo most of the time, since most private investigators like Rockford, Magnum, Houston, and Mannix ran their own private detective agency alone, unlike the short-tempered gonzo PI Rick Simon(Gerald McRaney)and the often fastidious A.J. Simon(Jameson Parker), but Rick & AJ who often butted heads with each other on cases still had their streetwise cop buddy Det. Marcel ""Downtown"" Brown(Tim Reid)and the spunky Lt. Marsh(Joan McMurtry)from San Diego P.D. just like the down-on-his-luck private detective Jim Rockford had his often irritated cop buddy Det. Dennis Becker(Joe Santos)from the LAPD on the ROCKFORD FILES to help them solve their investigations. Rick & AJ also lived an eccentric lifestyle like Rockford did since Rick was always tapped like Rockford was, plus Rick lived in AJ's backyard which was Venice in actuality and Rockford lived by himself in a small rusty trailer in a parking lot in Malibu Beach and always kept his gun in a cookie-jar.

SIMON & SIMON was also like a spin-off of MAGNUM, PI too, since it was a tad similar to MAGNUM along with the fact that MAGNUM, P.I. even had a cast colliding episode in this season where Rick & AJ Simon end up teaming up with Magnum(Tom Selleck) in Honolulu to solve an investigation regarding a string of mysterious deaths plaguing Hawaii.

In fact, this DVD contains both a bonus episode from MAGNUM, P.I., which is the ""KI'Is Don't Lie"" episode along with the fact that this was the season that has the ""Emerald's Aren't A Girls Best Friend"" episode of SIMON & SIMON when Rick & AJ Simon team up with the often disgruntled Higgins(John Hillerman)to go capture a prosperous jewelry thief(Morgan Fairchild) in Mexico, which by the way was the conclusion to the crossover episode ""KI'Is Don't Lie"".

In addition, SIMON & SIMON made it's debut on CBS in the Fall of 1981, which was only a year later after MAGNUM, P.I. made it's debut on CBS in December of 1980. SIMON & SIMON is also the show that made Gerald McRaney(Rick Simon) famous too, so you could say that SIMON & SIMON pretty much launched McRaney's acting career, since he went on to doing other shows after SIMON & SIMON cancelled like MAJOR DAD and TOUCHED BY AN ANGEL.

In this season, it was also interesting seeing guest stars like
*Anne Lockhart in the ""What's In A Gnome"" episode after her co-starring days as Lt. Sheba on BATTLESTAR GALACTICA

*Monte Markham in the ""Psyched Out"" episode before his co-starring days as Capt. Thorpe on BAYWATCH

*Judith Chapman in the ""What's In A Gnome"" episode during her co-starring days on ALL MY CHILDREN and before her co-starring days on YOUNG & THE RESTLESS and DAYS OF OUR LIVES

*Bill Boyett in the ""Design For Killing"" episode after his co-starring days as Sgt. MacDonald on ADAM-12

*Football celebrity(Dick Butkus)in the ""Fowl Play"" episode

The one thing I don't understand is why wasn't this SIMON & SIMON DVD wasn't made or distributed by Universal, unlike all the other Universal classic television DVD box sets like the ROCKFORD FILES, MAGNUM, KNIGHT RIDER, THE INCREDIBLE HULK, and AIRWOLF for instance, because for some reason the makers and distributors who made and released this SIMON & SIMON-SEASON 2 DVD was done by the SHOUT! Factory instead even though SIMON & SIMON was evidently a Universal production classic TV show.

Therefore, when I first heard that SIMON & SIMON-SEASON 2 was being released on DVD, I was under the impression that Universal was the one releasing it on DVD, not SHOUT or any other company, but at least we got to see these episodes complete & uncut like they were originally shown on CBS as well as commercial-free as opposed to how these episodes were shown in reruns on Cozi-TV, WGN and A&E which all deleted too many scenes & too many commercial interruptions. In addition to that, since this SIMON & SIMON-SEASON 2 DVD wasn't released by Universal, this DVD didn't have the convenient subtitles for Closed Captioning in DVD mode that all the Universal DVD box sets have.",1231200000,8,5548,4.852008456659619
3660699,5,B001JTRKHW,Thank you Universal for releasing this to Shout! Factory to be put out. Thank you Shout Factory for putting it out. My dearly departed wife and I watched this show every week when it was on. I enjoyed the first season set and am looking forward to get the rest. The show really took off when Downtown Brown joined the show in season 3. Lets have all the seasons out ASAP. Thanks.,1230940800,5,379,4.277777777777778
3660700,5,B001JTRKHW,"I have been looking forward to seeing Rick and A.J. again for WAY too long - Simon and Simon was such a great show, and the networks never show it in reruns, so it seems like forever since it was on. If you like detective shows without a lot of violence (a little here and there, but minor), with a nice mixture of comedy and drama, this show is for you. What I liked the best was the very real way they portrayed the brothers, both the arguments and the way they were always there for each other, even when they were a little embarrassed about it.  A wonderful show - looking forward to February!!",1230768000,7,598,4.2

3660765,4,B001JTRKHW,"""Simon & Simon"" was such a magnificent, unique, humorous and fun detective television series.

Jameson Parker was perfect in the role of private investigator A.J. Simon.
Gerald McRaney was perfect in the role of private investigator Rick Simon.

I rated the ""Simon & Simon: Season Two"" 6-disc set four stars because the episode ""The Secret of the Chrome Eagle""
only runs for 48:40 instead of 49:12.

""The Secret of the Chrome Eagle"" ran for 49:12 on Disc #4 of the ""Simon & Simon: Season One"" 4-disc set.
It was included on that Season One set as one of the bonus features.

The teaser for the episode ""The Secret of the Chrome Eagle"" was included on both the Season One and Season Two sets,
but, for whatever reason, the version of this episode on the Season Two set is missing a scene.

The second season of ""Simon & Simon"" originally aired on CBS from October 5, 1982 until March 31, 1983.

Here are the exact running times for all 23 episodes that were included on this Shout! Factory DVD release.

Disc 1:
[Magnum P.I. episode] - Ki'is Don't Lie - 48:21
Emeralds Are Not a Girl's Best Friend - 49:14
Mike & Pat - 49:16
Guessing Game - 49:09

Disc 2:
Art for Arthur's Sake - 49:14
The Ten Thousand Dollar Deductible - 49:14
Rough Rider Rides Again - 49:18
Sometimes Dreams Come True - 49:16

Disc 3:
The Last Time I Saw Michael - 49:12
Fowl Play - 49:16
Thin Air - 49:12
Murder Between the Lines - 49:17

Disc 4:
Psyched Out - 49:13
Pirate's Key - 1:37:08
The Club Murder Vacation - 49:14

Disc 5:
It's Only a Game - 49:14
Design for Killing - 49:14
The List - 49:18
What's in a Gnome? - 49:14

Disc 6:
The Secret of the Chrome Eagle - 48:40
Room 3502 - 49:14
Red Dog Blues - 49:16
The Skeleton Who Came Out of the Closet - 49:17

The episode ""Emeralds Are Not a Girl's Best Friend"" concludes a crossover that begins on the
Magnum, P.I. episode ""Ki'i's Don't Lie"".

The picture quality and audio quality on this DVD set are both good.

The packaging that Shout! Factory used for Simon & Simon: Season Two is perfect.
There is a cardboard slip-cover case that holds three different slim plastic DVD cases inside.
All three of the slim plastic DVD cases hold two discs each.

Notable guest stars from the second season of ""Simon & Simon"" were Alan Hale Jr., Albert Salmi, Anne Schedeen, Brenda Scott,
Broderick Crawford, Charles Napier, Cleavon Little, Cristina Raines, Darleen Carr, Dean Stockwell, Denny Miller, Dick Butkus,

3660812,5,B001JTRKHW,"What fun to see these old shows!  The product is fine, arrived promptly, and provided hours of entertainment.  I was lucky enough to spend some time in San Diego close to the time frame of this series while my husband was stationed there in the Navy.  Did we really wear that type of clothing or style our hair like that?  Yes, we did.  Were those really the cultural attitudes and mores of the time?  Yes, they were.

3660844,5,B001JTRKHW,The discs are great and good quality. Too bad a complete season 2 is currently unavailable. Hooefully it will be released in the near future.,1379548800,,141,4.68
3660845,3,B001JTRKHW,"After a rather shaky first season, the Brothers Simon hit the ground running in season two partly in thanks to their lone Hawaiian-based counterpart Thomas Magnum. Just before kick-off of season two of S & S, Magnum P.I started its 3rd season with a two-part (tie-in) episode titled `Ki's Don't Lie', which featured our beloved San Diego detectives in Magnum's territory who are attempting to locate a stolen and highly sought after ancient artifact; one that possess some sort of mysterious voodoo-like power that causes a various amount of chaotic events to happen. While not the strongest episode of the second season, it is an intriguing one, as in TV Land we seldom witness characters from one TV show appear on another. And, since Magnum P.I. was an already established ratings-hitter for CBS, the tie-in episode certainly gave S & S a serious kick-in-the-ratings-pants, which would help keep the series not just afloat but would assist it in becoming another successful CBS series contender to be dealt with for years to come.

Firmly locked in with their now-familiar theme song and with more consistent characters, the second season is filled with many memorable episodes, such as `Mike & Pat' about two adorable dolphins one of whom is kidnapped and which the brothers must rescue from some clever, yet dangerous drug dealers. `Guessing Game' is about a psychic the police dismiss as a hack, but when she hires the brothers to follow-up on her ""visions"", she proves that not all psychics are like Miss Cleo. `The Club Murder Vacation' -a fun episode that shares plenty of screen time with the Simons' Mom, Cecilia, and which also introduces us to a short-term, multiple episode character who happens to be the local coroner and a friend of the brothers;  a relationship that proves to be both fruitful and useful, especially when the Brothers Simon find themselves in a pinch. Unfortunately, his appearance is all too brief but memorable. Perhaps, one of the seasons (arguably maybe even one of the series best episodes!) is the two-hour pilot that never aired titled `Pirate's Key'. Originally filmed before the first season, this episode traces the beginnings of the brothers' partnership when they were in Florida where A.J. and Rick had yet to officially pair up. It's an energetic and insightful episode that reveals much about the brothers' humble beginnings and their often tempestuous relationship with one another and how their dangerous choice of a career has affected those close to them. Perhaps, most important of all we finally learn as to why A.J. and Janet never worked out. This episode alone is reason enough to purchase season two.

Aside from the varying caliber of episodes which make up season two, is the video and audio quality of this season. After somewhat disappointing season one sales, Universal decided to hand the reigns over to Shout! Factory, whom have done a slightly better job preserving and presenting this series than Universal attempted with the first season's DVD release. Granted, there is not much difference between season one and two's video and audio (but then again most fans of any 80's TV series will not be surprised, nor disappointed in this area. After all, we're talking about a time when the term `high definition' was like speaking another language!). Having said that, these box sets are certainly a far cry from being `reference material' but for S & S purists they have been done justice. And for those who are interested in owning these sets it's always been more about nostalgia than technical bliss. Still, this is surely the best presentation format these episodes will probably ever see.

Sadly, the extras are severely lacking. But, one must keep in mind that this series was shot during a period when it was a `flash- in- the -pan' on TV and then tossed away, thought to never see the light of day again. So, while season two lacks meaningful bonus features (unless you count the Magnum P.I. crossover episode as one) chances are that future box sets may have something more to offer in the extras department. But I'm not betting my hi-def TV on it!

Simon and Simon fans would certainly do themselves a favor and continue to move forward with completing their S & S collection. Currently, all seasons are available on DVD and can be purchased directly through the Shout! Factory website. However, Buyer beware: these box sets are not the cheapest!  But for hardcore S & S fans price is just is just a slight inconvenience when it comes to finally being able to own this beloved series.",1373500800,2,4560,4.907911802853437

3660901,5,B001JTRKHW,"With new living quarters for A.J. (Jameson Parker) Simon (a brown-shingled two-storey house overlooking a canal), a new boat (the cabin cruiser Hole-in-the-Water) for big brother Rick (Gerald McRaney), and a rollicking new country-rock theme song anchored by electric guitars, handclaps, and a screaming tenor sax, this first full-length season of one of TV's best-ever buddy-detective shows establishes much of the Simons' background: it's in these segments that we first learn that ""Dad died,"" that Rick was a Marine who did two tours in Vietnam, made Master-Sergeant, has a chestful of medals and sometimes suffers insomnia; that A.J. ran the mile in college, loves old jazz, was an anti-war protester (mostly because he wanted Rick Out Of There), and ""used to stay up all night studying for finals...get all tensed up...[and] break out in [a] rash.""  We even learn A.J.'s full name (""Andrew Jackson"") and birthdate--and if you freeze your DVD at just the right instant during ""The Secret of the Chrome Eagle,"" you'll see that Rick's military serial number was 27-010-48!  McRaney especially begins fleshing out his character's little idiosyncracies--his trademark exclamation of ""Ah, jeez!,"" his slim cigars (to which he shifts after observing in ""Thin Air"" that ""I gotta quit smokin',"" and he does--cigarettes), his crazy high-pitched cackle, and his enormous cannon of a .44 Magnum revolver worn in a breakaway shoulder holster (though he also carries, as the situation demands, a sleek automatic or a tiny snub-nosed waist gun).  We see the first instances of Rick and A.J. being more or less able to read each other's minds, or at least complete each other's sentences (in ""Rough Rider Rides Again,"" when A.J. says of a suspect, ""But if he isn't her pimp--"" and Rick takes it up with, ""--Then he must be after her just as hot'n'heavy as we are."").  And the series begins a long flirtation with the paranormal--a psychic's visions of murder in ""Guessing Game,"" a woman's dreams of her twin sister in peril in ""Sometimes Dreams Come True,"" and another woman's baffling personality change (after spending several hours in a ""haunted"" hotel room) in ""Room 3502"").  The dynamics of the series have shifted too, with Myron Fowler (Eddie Barth), A.J.'s old mentor, now retired, and his daughter Janet (Jeannie Wilson) graduated from law school and working as an Assistant DA for San Diego County, while Robert Ginty makes four appearances as the Simons' old friend Jerry Reiner, MD, of the coroner's office.

The second season repositioned the series on the CBS schedule, slotting it in right after ""Magnum, PI,"" a powerful lead-in that contributed mightily to its subsequent climb in the ratings.  Included in the set is the MPI episode ""Kiis Don't Lie,"" the first half of a double crossover episode, in which Rick and A.J. travel to Hawaii to attempt the recovery of a native curio that may be cursed, and encounter Thomas Magnum (Tom Selleck) and his friends; the second half, ""Emeralds Are Not a Girl's Best Friend,"" guest-stars John Hillerman in his MPI role as Jonathan Higgins, as he and the Simons travel to South America in pursuit of the female con artist who ripped off a charity auction.  Here also are cases of varying character, some with murders and some without: a kidnapped dolphin (""Mike and Pat""), a stolen painting (""Art for Arthur's Sake""), the theft of $500,000 worth of diamonds (""The $10,000 Deductible""), the return (or is it?) of an old family friend thought drowned years ago (""The Last Time I Saw Michael""), a pro football player who's being pressured into throwing games (""Fowl Play""), a video game that somebody seems willing to kill for (""It's Only a Game""), a phantom saboteur haunting a soon-to-be-opened amusement park (""What's in a Gnome?""), the journey to San Francisco of a classic car (""Chrome Eagle""), a supposed mental patient who never should have been institutionalized to begin with (""The Skeleton Who Came Out of the Closet"").  And the re-edited pilot, ""Pirate's Key,"" set in Florida with a new framing story.  There's even an episode loosely based on fact--""The Rough Rider Rides Again,"" which takes off from efforts by the producers of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Legend-of-the-Lone-Ranger/dp/B001ARDC16/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Legend of the Lone Ranger</a>&nbsp;to bar TV Ranger Clayton Moore from appearing publicly in costume.  Both brothers get a taste of romance, A.J. in ""The List,"" Rick in ""Red Dog Blues.""  Best of all--what inspired a rich and active fandom that lasted almost a decade--is the relationship between the brothers: often wry, sometimes loud, but underneath it all always supportive (watch for A.J.'s way of grasping quickly at Rick's arm in moments of revelation).  With drama, humor, action, and family connectedness in almost equal measure, this is the first of what I consider the three best seasons of the series run.  Don't miss it.",1273449600,4,4965,5.221105527638191
3660902,5,B001JTRKHW,"This has been a long wait, but finally, SHOUT picks up the ball dropped by Universal so long ago. They have released seasons two and three and are scheduled to release season four on April 10, 2010. Now, as long as they complete the series by releasing seasons 5-8 (including the 1995 TV movie) we will have gotten our wishes. It just go to show that letters and emails can make a difference- as long as your company is not named Universal. I encourage everyone to send an email off to SHOUT at [...] and tell them how grateful you are for what they've done.
  Now, about S & S season two. We notice right away that things have evolved after season one when that familiar theme music kicks in. This show has one of the all time great theme songs, a rocking little ditty not so unlike the Magnum PI theme. This season is where S & S hit their stride. Everything we all loved about this show is here- the action, the characters, the comic antagonism between Rick & A.J.  This here is why we loved this show. Too bad it only five seasons, but it was bound to end when they moved it to Saturday nights. It seemed always that this show and Magnum PI operated in the same television universe, and the great crossover episode at the start of this season clearly illustrates that. When Magnum began winding down itself, it seemed to take alot of steam out of S & S as well. But while those two shows were on the air on Thursday nights- there was not a better night of television all week. It is awesome to be able to sit back now and watch those two shows again just like it was 1987 all over again.
  Anybody who even had a casual interest in S & S back in the 80's needs to buy these seasons. It holds up extremely well all these years later. No cheesey scripts or outdated dialogue to be found anywhere here. It is as fresh and intelligent as it was 20 years ago. And maybe even moreso- because with hindsight you can appreciate just how special a show it was. Thank you SHOUT!",1261094400,2,1972,4.23404255319149
3660903,5,B001JTRKHW,"I was very pleased when I read on the web that Universal had sub-licenced the 80's detective series Simon & Simon to Shout! Factory. I was doubly pleased when I bought the boxset via Amazon.com and found the boxset was intact and not damaged and all six discs played perfectly fine (I'd bought the second season from another Region 1 website beforehand but kept having problems with the boxset and some of the discs - broken pieces of plastic in some of the three slipcases, creases and dents to the outer box and audio problems on some of the discs).

The presentation of the Simon & Simon's second season by Shout! Factory is well done. Each disc has a different clip for it's menu screen, the Season 1 theme tune is used as well as the new theme tune for Season 2 on the menu screens, and the print quality of the episodes is very nice. If the 23 episodes in this boxset haven't been digitally remastered by Shout! Factory, then the print quality hasn't diminished much since the episodes' original airing back in the 1982-83 US TV season on CBS.

It was likely common for most 1980's TV series but I was pleased that there was a 30 second teaser before each episode. You eithee love or hate them. Some people say they spoil the following episode and some say they don't. I personally like pre-episode teasers (main example being the Jack Lord episode promos in the Hawaii Five-O DVD boxsets).",1251590400,4,1396,4.535714285714286

Those 2 guys are great.
Simon & Simon season 2 makes you forgive the slow start of season 1.

We like to call Andrew  'JA' as our favorite semi-recurring character 'Dr. Suvi Raj' aka Captain Midnight did, Rick's friend in the ER. He never got it right and it will be funny to again watch the very persnickety (borrowed from Natalie describing Monk, but it fits:) AJ just acquiesce and not offer any resistance to the butchering of his nickname numerous times. Emailed Shout to let them know of more big fans of Simon & Simon and that I was glad they have taken over the job of making sure the show is seen again.

3660962,5,B001JTRKHW,"After nearly two and a half years of waiting, SHOUTFACTORY licensed this great show from UNIVERSAL and they did a great job. After the first season, which already was good, this second season shows why SIMON & SIMON was one of the most popular-TV-Shows back in these days. The greatest fun of the show was the interacting of Gerald McRaney and Jameson Parker, who did a really great job on portraying these different brothers. I really like both of them, but my heart will always beat for Rick Simon...this guy really was the coolest ( and hottest... ) P.I. of all those P.I.-shows of the Eighties. Go and get your copy of this tremendous show, to let SHOUT ( and UNIVERSAL... ) know there are a lot of us SIMON-fans and that we are really looking forward for the next seasons to come...",1236988800,,787,4.510489510489511

3660978,5,B001JTRKHW,"""Simon & Simon: Season Two"" on DVD is worth cheering about! Far better written than the first season, and opening with a very entertaining crossover with it's new lead-in show, Tom Selleck's ""Magnum P.I."", the series, and it's wonderful stars, Jameson Parker and Gerald McRaney, provided an irresistable blend of action and humor, and is every bit as enjoyable today as it was in 1982!

Viewing both seasons, besides being great fun, is an education on how a series is 'polished' and improved. Besides the bouncy new slide-guitar theme, the characters of Myron Fowler and his daughter Janet (Eddie Barth and Jeannie Wilson) are gradually phased out, as the role of the Simons' mother, Cecilia (Mary Carver), is enlarged (thankfully, Marlowe, Rick's big, lovable dog, is still a fixture!). The backstory of Rick being a 'Nam vet is introduced, as is the first of the brothers' Police Department 'buddies' (Robert Ginty, as a hip coroner), who would foreshadow the arrival of Tim Reid, as Detective 'Downtown' Brown, in Season Three. More episodes would be set in the San Diego area, fewer across the border in Mexico (with a two-part episode utilizing the unaired series pilot, set in the Florida Keys), and most episodes ended with a smile (it appears McRaney often ad-libbed; watch Parker's attempts to stay in character to his occasional asides!) The show definitely had the look, and feel, of a winner!

While I wish the collection offered a 'Subtitles' option, and commentaries by Parker and McRaney (I'd LOVE to hear their recollections), and the picture quality is occasionally a bit grainy, I'm not complaining; Season Two was the first of the GREAT seasons of ""Simon & Simon"", and I'm thrilled that it is finally available on DVD!",1234483200,13,1738,4.989655172413793
3660979,5,B001JTRKHW,"People do not realize how close this show was to being scrapped after Season 1. The crossover with Magnum PI and placing it after Magnum on Thursdays saved it!  I remember watching the crossover in the fall of 82' as a young kid.""Ki's"" from Magnum and then ""Emeralds"" from this consecutively. So us fans owe a bit of gratitude to Magnum for giving it the exposure to stay another 7 years! Why people didn't warm up in 1981 to this is beyond me.
  My favorite episode from this season is the ""Just a Game"" episode. The AJ kissing scene at the end was pretty unique if you will. I remember that scene as a kid. I haven't even watched it yet and just bought it today. Will be great to relive early 80's thursday nights.

But i'm thankful after more than two years to be getting the second season. Nearly every episode is either good or great. And the list of well known or soon to be well known guest stars is another plus, including Tom Selleck, Charles Napier, Kathleen Lloyd, Anne Schedeen, Stuart Whitman, Ray Walston, Robert Englund, Darleen Carr, Richard Kiel, Jonathan Banks, Dick Butkus, Ed Lauter, and more. An episode from Magnum, P.I. featuring A.J. and Rick is the only bonus feature. A commentary on the 2 hour Pirate's Key episode by Jameson Parker and Gerald McRaney would have been nice.
