8704684,5,B00U88C31I,"When I first researched this topic I was unaware of the excellent book and film about San Francisco's Forbidden City. My interest began when I went to this Chinese nightclub in the early 60s. It became my home away from home while I was in the Navy, but until now I never knew about the rich history of that era. That coupled with the fact I toured the original Forbidden City in Beijing in the 90s and the reader can perhaps understand why my interest was so intense. An interest fully satisfied with the depth of information and priceless photos and video of this amazing time in Baghdad By the Bay. From this history sprang the musical, Flower Drum Song as well. Wonderful, not to be missed.",1520380800,,694,4.47244094488189

Many younger Asians Americans are searching for history that has been lost and that we were never taught. Thank you, Arthur Dong for creating this documentary!",1500681600,,267,5.090909090909091
8704686,5,B00U88C31I,"Stereotypes are how we exist - a tree is envisioned as a stereotype - no two people imagine the same tree.  However, stereotypes can be carried to extremes - as racial stereotypes once were.  However, such ignorance has been gone for over 60 years. Any perceived racial biases today are completely false.

Forbidden City USA clearly point out the false disparities between races; Chinese, Philippine, African, European, or American - we are all just people with similar hopes and dreams.",1489536000,,487,5.0625
8704687,5,B00U88C31I,"A beautifully-done documentary that combines rare footage of performances at the 'just outside of Chinatown' San Francisco club Forbidden City of the late '30s (and onwards), and great interviews with performers from the golden age of the club. Some of us may have only gotten a passing hint of this time and place, if at all, from the nightclub scene in 'Flower Drum Song'; this doc fills in the whole rich story.  The recently-published companion book makes a great complement to this DVD.",1481328000,2,491,4.9156626506024095
