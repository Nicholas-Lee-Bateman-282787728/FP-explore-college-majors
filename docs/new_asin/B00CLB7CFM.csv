5725889,5,B00CLB7CFM,Terrific show and a wonderful cast! Marton Csokas is fabulous as Detective Falcon. And the scenery is to die for. Seville looks  so excting . I  can't wait for series 2 !,1377475200,5,170,4.28125
5725890,2,B00CLB7CFM,"The delivery and condition of the physical product were flawless. It was the quality of the story and acting that were lacking when compared to other foreign detective stories like BECK, IRENE HUSS, MONTALBANO and MARIA WERN. Can't win'em all.",1377043200,,243,5.1
5725891,5,B00CLB7CFM,"What a guy...he's smart, troubled, flawed, mysterious and beautiful, just like Seville, Spain where this is filmed.  Don't you dare be put off by his English accent many Brits live in Spain.....the stories are marvelous as well as this gorgeous city, beautiful exterior and interior shots make this an eyeful, wonderful and hope there is many more episodes to come. Yes it's dark, but then, aren't good murder mysteries dark?",1374278400,14,425,5.071428571428571
5725892,4,B00CLB7CFM,"yes, this is a violent police series set in spain with a mess of a hero as the homicide detective.  i think i was a bit more bothered by the UK accents than the other reviewer but i am very used to reading subtitles. however, most amazon users hate subtitles so i think they will take to this just as they did the UK version of the swedish Wallander.

another aspect i found very interesting was that his late father was an artist. his late father is an increasingly vital element to the series and, of course, most of the detective's problems come from this source.

this is a straightforward police procedural type of series so you will not find the humor or exposure to Sicilian culture or cuisine like one finds in the Italian INSPECTOR MONTALBANO.

the leading actor is quite good so that is a big plus for the series.

5725893,4,B00CLB7CFM,"Disturbing scenes force you to look away. HD graphic thriller. Gruesome, sinister, dark side and secret side of harsh living.
CI Falcon is a Seville, Spain, homicide dept head with inner turmoil, intriguing past; a drinker, drug user detective. His wife (Emilia Fox- `Silent Witness') left him because he had no heart, only a job. Yet a stunningly beautiful murder suspect (Hayley Atwell- `Pillars of the Earth') attracts him to bed. A boat-load of other UK acting stars find land in Spanish Seville. Ignore the complaint of UK accents in a Spanish locale and enjoy the terror, violence, and suspense. Two episodes connect through plot, crimes, & character study.

SDH SUBTITLES available for features and bonus.
THE BLIND MAN OF SEVILLE
Falcon investigates a scene of forced film viewing & torture. A photo of his artist dad is among the murdered man's stuff. Why? The show is an in-depth character study, more like literature, but then these stories do originate from Robert Wilson novels. Murders for revenge of 3 men's sins. Falcon's father's art dealer (Bernard Hill- ""Titanic"" captain) knows secrets. If you can stomach the graphic images, violence, nudity and language, it continues in a second feature-length thriller with new murders, and some of the same old personal baggage for some. More regular than guest stars: Kerry Fox (Cloudstreet) & Charlie Creed-Miles.

THE SILENT AND THE DAMNED
Action picks up months later, after Falcon's forced hiatus. But soon he's moved form an apparent suicide to a vagrant death by Chief Commissioner Lobo (Henry Goodman- `Notting Hill'). A 40-yr-cop (Kenneth Cranham) soon to retire pals with Falcon on his return to the office. Falcon finds a connection between 2 murders and a cover-up. Corruption again gets deeply personal. Also has guest stars: Robert Lindsay (H. Hornblower); Martin McCann (Titanic: blood and Steel); & Bill Paterson (Little Dorrit; Wives & Daughters).

This may be considered a 5-star production for those who thrive on the dark side of thrillers.",1368835200,14,2018,5.165137614678899

5725895,2,B00CLB7CFM,"The excellent Javier Falcon novels written by Robert Wilson offer intricate plots, multi-layered characters, and psychological and cultural insights. The two books this TV series is based on are&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Blind-Man-of-Seville/dp/0156028808/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Blind Man of Seville</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Vanished-Hands/dp/0151008418/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Vanished Hands</a>. Perhaps it was an impossible task to translate them successfully to the screen. Little survives the transition. Not only are the plots entirely changed, but so are the characters and their motivations. None of the alterations are an improvement, leaving the books as far superior.

There's something off-putting about British actors playing Spanish characters, particularly when they pronounce Spanish words and names with an accent. They also can't quite get the cultural aspects of the personalities right, so it's difficult to be convinced they're Spanish. The similar ""Zen"" series had the same challenge with Italian characters. The only actor who strikes the right chord in ""Falcon"" is Venezuelan Santiago Cabrera, who, although British trained, has lived in Spain.

Like the books, the TV series aims to show the grittier side of Seville -- the one you don't see in postcards. So those hoping for colorful, scenic shots of the city will likely be disappointed. The major landmarks are glimpsed only in passing.

The 16:9 picture quality of the DVDs is quite good, as is the 5.1 surround sound. There are several short bonus features, mainly promotional in nature. The interview with Robert Wilson holds a bit more interest than the others.",1425513600,,1778,6.338842975206612
5725896,5,B00CLB7CFM,"We love this series of shows and sure hope they are making more!  Very unique, love that it is in Spain, get to see some of the city (if I recall, its Barcelona? have forgotten the city, but one of the larger cities).  the acting is great, the lead is wonderul, quirky, full of insecurities, really interesting character.  Highly recommend if you like a good detective/mystery.",1420934400,,377,4.681818181818182
5725897,3,B00CLB7CFM,"O.K. if you have nothing better in your purchases that you still haven't viewed. Acorn has much better titles than this one in their catalogue. If you don't mind viewing a substance abuser, I'd spend my money on Cracker instead. Also an Acorn series. Cracker's an alcoholic; Falcon is a doper. Both are not particularly likeable but Robbie Coltrane is much better at it.",1410480000,,370,4.796875

The character, Falcon, is a police inspector who's hooked on cocaine.  Both episodes are based around the death of Falcon's father and Falcon's discovery that he's not really the son of the only father he's ever known.  Additionally, there are so many side stories that really have nothing to do with the central theme of the episodes.  Please don't waste your money.",1402272000,2,490,5.012345679012346
5725903,4,B00CLB7CFM,This series is based on a very tortured man and his story is very intriguing  well thought out with lots of twist and turns.  Keeps you on your toes.  Would have got 5 stars is the editing and filming had been less all over the place.  At times it takes a minute or two to figure out what's going on.  Some of the editing leaves the plot a little vague.  BUT in the end it all come together and it really is GOOD.,1402099200,,413,3.9156626506024095
5725904,5,B00CLB7CFM,"Can't really ask for much more in crime fiction. Set in Seville, this was a very short lived series, only two episodes but well worth watching.  The only regret I have is that they didn't make more.",1399680000,3,198,4.351351351351352
5725905,4,B00CLB7CFM,"There are so many detective/cop shows in the market today that it is becoming increasingly difficult to come up with new material. Wisely, many producers are looking to literary sources to augment the genre.

What FALCON has going for it is its fresh, exciting, exotic and fascinating locale. Seville, Spain is the perfect setting for a new take on an old idea. Add to the appeal of the new backdrop the fact that predominantly English actors are playing Spaniards, and you have an even more unique scenario.

FALCON has its critics for this very reason, with many dissenters expressing the view that it should be done by Spanish actors. Perhaps they miss the point that FALCON is very much a Spanish-flavoured program seen through the eyes of an Englishman. Author Robert Wilson comes by his fascination with Spain and, specifically, Seville, honestly, having traveled there and experienced all that a young, adventurous cyclist is bound to encounter when he journeyed there in the mid-eighties. Wilson tells this story in one of the excellent bonus features that are included in this two disc set.

Wilsons exploration of the dark side of Seville is mostly successful as the film captures the grittiness that stands in stark contrast to the local colour and ritual that features in the first episode which is set during Holy Week and the Febria de Abril, when processions of the sacred Virgin on flower-laden floats are seen throughout the city accompanied by rows of people in dark robes and hoods (frighteningly similar to the Ku Klux Klan).

Unfortunately not all of Spains culture is as beautiful. A bull fight features prominently in the first episode, and although it was not staged for the film, shots were taken of real bull fights with all their ritual torture. Fortunately we are spared the killing of the bull. To say more would be a spoiler.

The character of Falcon himself is deeply troubled, with many hang-ups. Of course he is a brilliant detective (there would be no story without that characteristic). But the combination of personal angst and professional accomplishment is hardly new. Though brilliantly portrayed by Marton Csokas, FALCON cant quite seem to shake some of the clichs of the detective genre in its pursuit of a fresh perspective. Were it not for Seville and all its variety, wed be in awfully familiar territory.

Whether the change of scenery is enough to warrant viewer commitment (only two of the four FALCON novels were adapted here) remains to be seen. Though the mysteries are stand alone, there is still an overall story arc that will only be explored if and when the remaining two novels are adapted.

FALCON is not without interest and, though quite graphic and with lots of unnecessarily vulgar coarse language, should be completed before passing final judgment. Tortured he may be, but will he manage to overcome his demons?",1397433600,,2872,4.946058091286307
5725906,5,B00CLB7CFM,"A very dark series.  Wonderful performance from a favorite actor who hasn't done a lot.  He's superb in this and in Asylum.  Great cinematography.  Meanders a bit, but builds to a stunning conclusion.",1393027200,,200,4.96969696969697
5725907,3,B00CLB7CFM,"I honestly only bought this film because it had Marton Csokas in it.  His performance, along with the other actors, was very well done.  But I have to say that this was not my favorite film.  The story seemed to unfold rather slowly, and the build to the climax of the story wasn't as captivating as I had hoped it would be.  Over all, I'd say it was a decent film, but not the most exciting.",1388620800,,392,4.118421052631579
5725908,3,B00CLB7CFM,"The plot was interesting but it's all pretty dry.  I've watched lots of these kinds of mysteries and this one is weaker than the ones I've seen from the UK, Sweden, Italy and Denmark.",1384214400,,183,4.382352941176471
5725909,5,B00CLB7CFM,"I loved this dvd although it is a little ""dark"" in content. I would not be surprised to find that Maton Casocks was interviewed for the lead in the Inspector Zen series just because of his physical resemblance to Zen in the books - tall, light hair, light eyes. But that is nothing to take away the excellence of both these series.

5725911,5,B00CLB7CFM,"Incredibly imaginative, well acted and compelling photographic images. One rarely comes across DVD's that one can describe as this. Although a British production it certainly maintains the flavour of Saville. I do not think it is anymore graphic nor violent than that one routinely sees, and, if anything, the story line requires this !!! The character of Falcon is not unlike most of the (screen) homocide detectives one sees, e.g. introspective and jaded but at heart a caring police officer. One gets one's good value with this DVD - buy it !!",1379376000,4,546,4.945652173913044
