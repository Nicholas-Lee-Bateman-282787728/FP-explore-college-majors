8413590,2,B0042FHTBW,"This review is for the video quality of this particular label ( Columbia ), I have previously bought this title from another european source, and the video quality was deplorable, this release is better, but still leaves much to be desired. I have a copy of this film which some years ago I recorded on superbeta tape, off of TCM, and doing an a/b compare with this dvd, it is hard to say which looks better. I can only hope that one of the current studios, whoever has the rights, or if in public domain, may do a proper restoration, and perhaps release this title as part of their various mod programs. As far as the film itself, I would call this a western film noir, with as usual an excellent performance by Dick Powell, Jane Greer, and a first rate supporting cast.",1305331200,,771,4.398601398601398
