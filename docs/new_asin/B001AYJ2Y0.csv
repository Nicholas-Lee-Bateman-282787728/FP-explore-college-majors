3473946,4,B001AYJ2Y0,"I think this is one of the best movies ever made. About a young man named Christian's journey to the Celestial City. Based on the novel Pilgrim's Progress by John Bunyan, it's the second most widely read book in the English language behind the  Bible. Can't go wrong.",1503014400,,267,4.5625

3473951,5,B001AYJ2Y0,"Read the book or watch the movie, Pilgrim's Progress will help you see that this life is a journey and God wants us to stay on the right pathall the way till the end.  -The problem is, Lots of people come along the way... to try to take us off the pathand we follow thembecause we trust what they saywe trust the wrong people and things.  Thankfully, God always sends someone, to help us get backon the right path again-but we have to pay attention and notice, otherwise -we can miss and not recognize when they come...",1496275200,,519,4.34020618556701

3473957,1,B001AYJ2Y0,Corny doesn't even begin to describe this movie.  I bought this to show to my students after reading the book; we could hardly get through it without laughing. The acting is atrocious. It's just all so bad.,1487808000,,206,4.5675675675675675
3473958,4,B001AYJ2Y0,"A nice version of the classic written by John Bunyon in 1660.

This modern adaptation includes the great visual effects and lovely scenery, the director's commentary and closed captioning. I've watched it several times and find that I pick up something new each time.

I recommend one per household.",1487548800,,299,5.081632653061225

3473963,5,B001AYJ2Y0,"Like the director said in the special features, if you haven't read the book, do so.  This modern telling helps younger readers to get into the allegory of the story.",1485475200,,166,4.533333333333333

3473966,2,B001AYJ2Y0,"I really wanted to like this movie since I loved the book, but this was very chintzy and I couldn't take it serious. It has a good story, but it was like they had no budget for the movie, so the story is lost because the acting is so lame.",1483660800,,239,3.8
3473967,4,B001AYJ2Y0,"First of all, nothing will ever compare to the book!  I read Pilgrim's Progress as a child, a young teen, and I've read it as an adult (and appreciated it even more!). I've read it to my children.  I've shown the old animated version in Junior Church and hoped for a more up-to-date, real-life version for the teens.  This is a very worthy attempt.  One needs to remember throughout the film that this is a dream.  Otherwise, a man with khaki pants and armor will seem a bit cheesy.  I do appreciate the present-day feel, but I wish that the scene where he loses his burden was a bit more defined.  The acting is good.  My teen daughter remarked that it is slow in a few places, but compared to the old film I remember, this one moves along.  Special effects are decent. I was disappointed in the effects at the end where he crosses the river, but in retrospect I suspect there might be a reason the river looked so calm as they waded in, but grew turbulent as they crossed. The film as a whole is very thoughtfully done with regard to the things one encounters in the Christian life.  Some parts made me cry and others reaffirmed the truths I know in my heart as a believer.  It would provoke some good group discussion.  It's a worthy addition to our church library.",1483660800,,1268,4.348936170212766
3473968,5,B001AYJ2Y0,Exactly as described. Great movie and easy to understand. We got this for my daughter to help her understand the book & it helped her out tremendously!,1483488000,,151,4.62962962962963

3473972,4,B001AYJ2Y0,"Although this modern day version is not what I had expected I am happy to recommend this movie of Pilgrims Progress. Perhaps the contemporary setting will appeal more to the younger generation and it it does it will have served its purpose well.

i use it as an adjunct to my lectures in business ethics at the Master's level, along with the print version of the book to help prepare young students for some of life's trials and tribulations. John Bunyan's own life story is inspirational to all.

3473976,2,B001AYJ2Y0,Very boring.  I thought it would never end.,1475280000,,43,4.375
3473977,4,B001AYJ2Y0,"This movie is a doctored up version of 70's version of Pilgrim's Progress. Some of the special effects are not high quality and the makeup special effects leave something to be desired. Overall, it was a decent story line and it is a nice contrast to the cartoon version that I like as well as the Liam Neeson version. I think this one more closely parallels the book than some other renditions. If you're looking for a more ""Hollywood"" version of this beloved story line, then you will find this appealing. Some of the imagery definitely has more of an impact on your thinking, simply because the visuals bring the book to life. I've watched it several times. For a while, it was our ""go to"" movie.",1472256000,,699,4.511811023622047

3473979,1,B001AYJ2Y0,I was disappointed in the DVD received.  The only thing that played were the Director commentary and chapters of the movie. I really was looking forward to seeing a movie that everyone rated as excellent. I hope that I can return and receive a DVD with the movie not just chapters.,1471737600,,281,4.509803921568627

We'll meet Jesus- the one who finished it all!
And the Person of the Holy Spirit will keep us on course.",1471219200,,327,4.377049180327869
3473981,1,B001AYJ2Y0,"Ordered this movie twice and both times I got a promotional dvd that looked just like the right movie until I tried to play it. When I tried to play it there was a message from director, a movie trailer and then 5 promo chapters from the movie. No where on the DVD was the actual movie. Took a while to figure out and make sure I wasn't missing some option. I put it in my computer and the file is named ""church promo"". My assumption is that somehow these promos were incorrectly packaged as the full length movie (only thing that makes sense to me)...No other comments on this issue in the reviews so thought I better add one.

Amazon was very easy to work with both times but Im done for now just getting a refund.",1471219200,,716,4.188405797101449

3474005,1,B001AYJ2Y0,Terrible. The book has a beautiful balance of the good (promises od the kingdom) and bad (destruction of Satan and Hell). This story is predominantly the bad (fighting demons)  It went straight into the trash,1450656000,,208,4.942857142857143

3474044,5,B001AYJ2Y0,This is my third purchase of this movie. I've loved it since the first time I saw it at a local Christian film festival. It's a great rendition of the classic tale! There are a couple of cheap special effects (they were on a tight budget after all!). I would also caution previewing for small children as there are just a couple scenes which might be a bit more than small children can handle (a monster jumps out a man and the scene of hell although not graphic was intense for my more sensitive child).

3474079,5,B001AYJ2Y0,"If you'd like a movie that can be enjoyed as a couple, with friends or as a family - this is your film - complete with monsters and action for the men!

""Pilgrim's Progress: A journey to Heaven"" is adapted from the John Bunyan novel written in 1678. It is the timeless story of spiritual warfare . . . the progress of the Christian soul throughout this lifetime. It is as relevant now (if not more so!) as it was when it was written.

In this contemporary rendition complete with special effects we see the main character ""Christian"" fights demons as he makes his journey through the world and towards the heavenly gates. The narrow path ain't the easy one (as we know!) and Christian is led astray more than once! The film gives visual evidence to our difficult but rewarding journey of Faith by showing actual battles, sword fights, etc with evil creatures/situations and even a giant troll (he looks like an evil ""Shrek,"") who imprisons & tortures Christian and a companion. This is not a Hollywood type production but a welcomed and refreshing change. I have also published this review to my blog.",1409184000,,1101,4.641025641025641

3474081,3,B001AYJ2Y0,I'm a priest who went through the book with his youth and then purchased the movie to watch at the end. In the interest of time I'm going to tell you what I didn't like about the movie because there are several that say what is good about the movie and I'm not disagreeing with them. The main issue I had with this movie is that because it comes from an obviously evangelical tradition the focus is on going to Heaven and avoiding Hell. Now that is important and the book addresses that issue several times but the book focuses I think more on the trials and temptations of the Christian life. By focusing almost solely on avoiding Hell I think the audience loses out on the depth and genius of what I almost think could have been a divine vision to John Bunyan. After the movie I was left thinking about how much richness it missed out on. I realize its a movie and you have to cut back to make it work but by focusing the majority of the movie on that issue of Hell we really didn't get what John Bunyan mean for us to get.,1408406400,,1025,4.155778894472362

Please note that the cover photo represents putting on 'the Armour of God'.  The movie takes place in modern times.

I lent this movie to a friend and she said it was so powerful it brought her to tears.  Her family loved it.  Even the younger members could watch it safely.  She is my Bible study minister.  She was going through two deaths in the family on the same day.  I told her to keep it.  She tried to disuade me, but I said, ""No, it is yours.""  I saw her the next day in the elevator and she said she was feeling 'happy' and her spirits were lifted and thanked me again.  She had gone to her apt. and cried and then called her daughter to tell her that they could keep this movie.  How uplifting for everyone was that?

This movie is set in the modern day drama and, I believe could have been a mini-series to tell the whole Tale of Pilgrim's Progress.

Nice scenes about hypocrites and those who are easily veered off course. My only gripe with the plot is that they portray it as a series of never ending hardships and dangers to follow Jesus.

Maybe a bit scary during some of the battle scenes for the little ones but should be fine for teens and even younger kids if you think they can handle it.

The movie was semi-low budget but well put together and preserves the content of the book well.

The actors were just what I would have hoped for, because they seemed just like people in my own family and neighborhood.

This is certainly Carrales most ambitious project to date and also his longest film at 105 minutes.

I'll be honest and upfront about not having read Bunyan's novel so I can't compare the novel and the film, so this review will focus only on the movie as a standalone work.

There are a few good and some bad things about this film. The quality of the different aspects of the movie is uneven, for example acting. I think Daniel Kruse did a pretty good job and Hugh McLean gave a strong performance (as usual in films that are below his abilities, it seems), while some minor roles were really, really bad, and I mean laughably  bad (and I doubt Carrales was going for comedy value). The same is true for the special effects. The first special effects scene was pretty bad but later, there were some special effects scenes that were pretty good.

Anyway, those are the minor aspects of a movie, I guess. So let's move on to story and entertainment value. Story: Christian is reading a book. It's given him a great burden (literally - he walks around with the world's largest backpack). He wants to leave his home in  City of Destruction where he lives with his family, to journey to the Celestial City. No one wants to come with him so he goes alone. Along the way he meets various people who guide him on his journey, and some who try to get him off the right path.

So what we have is an adventure story, with fantasy elements. Now, adventure sounds exciting, but director-writer Carrales fails to create excitement. He has Christian and his occasional traveling companions walking from one place to the next, meeting one guide after another, and so it goes for a very long time. There's very few obstacles to overcome or many dangers along the way. With nothing exciting happening, it gets quite repetitive to watch and, to be honest, pretty boring.

I wouldn't generally recommend this one, except perhaps to those who are fans of the book and want to see what the movie is like.

PS: There's is also a 1979 movie from this book with Liam Neeson in his film debut in it:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pilgrim-s-Progress/dp/B000EQHX78/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pilgrim's Progress</a>",1321660800,,2749,5.753694581280788

We are not done with the book, but as far as we got, the movie was pretty accurate to the book.
There were some parts omitted, but overall, I thought it was good.
The acting wasn't terrible.  I actually liked the movie.
There are some scary scenes, so if you are going to have children with you when you watch it, just be warned...maybe preview it and show them the parts that won't scare them.  Someone I know allowed their little ones to watch and they reasoned that it was better for them to be scared of the consequences of sin rather than shelter them from consequences of bad choices.

3474189,5,B001AYJ2Y0,"John Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress is an enduring classic.  Its appeal is in the fact that his allegory does not sugarcoat the journey that all of us must embark upon if we are to be saved. This journey is fraught with many dangers, but it is one in which the victory promises great joy.  This modern-day adaptation is truly moving.  The script stays true to Bunyan's book while simultaneously making the language accessible to those who would not read the story.  Purists may not like this film, but I found it to be extrememely inspiring.

In the City of Disstruction, a man named Christian is barraged by doubts and fears.  A book that he reads predicts that his city will be destroyed by fire and urges him and his family to escape.  Not only does Christian deal with inward turmoil, but he is crippled by a horrendous burden upon his back that hinders his movements.  A man named Evangelist urges Christian to journey to the Celestial City, a place of refuge where he will escape the coming judgment.  Christian sets forth on his journey, little knowing that many dangerous foes lie in wait.  However, many helpers also wait in the wings to offer their assistance.

The acting in this movie was very good.  Certain characters were not portrayed in ways I would have imagined, but the overall effect of the film is excellent.  My favorite scenes were Christian's encounter with Worldly Wise, the trial scene at Vanity Fair, and the journey through the dark river.  Pilgrim's Progress is an entertaining journey that dramatizes our daily struggles with the Evil One and our only hope in our Savior, Jesus Christ.  I pray that more Christian movies in the allegorical/fantasy genre will be made.  God bless you all.

3474192,5,B001AYJ2Y0,"""Pilgrim's Progress"" is a faithful production of the classic by John Bunyan.  The story is an allegory describing the Christian walk with Christ.  The main character is ""Christian"" who leaves the city of destruction for the Celestial City representing heaven.

Along the way Christian meets some friends - Evangelist, Help, Faithful, Hopeful, Fearless, who help him along his journey.  They represent the people who aid us in our walk with Christ.

However, Christian meets many more people and demons who try to redirect him off the path - Ignorance, Vanity, Atheist, and a host of others.  Indeed, for the serious Christian, in our lives we will encounter many more people such as these.  Demons also.

The movie lasts around 1 hour and 45 minutes but seems to go quickly.  We watched the movie with our children and they seemed to really get into the story.  Some scenes may be too frightening for younger children.

This movie, like Bunyan's classic book, is as relevant today as it was hundreds of years ago.

Watch, enjoy, and be challenged and encouraged to stay faithful to Christ all the days of your life and refuse to let the world distract you!

A recent re-make of the 1950's version of the 17th century account of one man's biblical interpretation of the Christian earthly journey to eternal life in heaven. It is biblically accurate regarding what the bible (both old and new Testament) teaches about the faith necessary to complete life's journey and the things that derail and snare us along the way. It is replete with sound effects and visual gymnastics that give the viewer a panoramic view of bible themes and depictions (e.g., ""the valley of the shadow of death""). I encourage families to watch this movie together. I've shared it at least 10 times with neighbors, family, and friends; encouraging them to take the DVD and share it with someone else, I simply order another.

3474197,2,B001AYJ2Y0,"We watched this film 3 times, the first time we thought it wasn't as good as the book but it was ""okay"" for a filmed version.  One thing comes thru positively clear, and is truthful, and that is that we are on a journey towards God's Kingdom and not everybody will understand or appreciate that!

Then we watched it again, and thought...boy, the film really makes the Law (the Holy Torah) look bad!  On our third watching, many months later, we realized that though Hebrews 5 & 6 admonishes us not to dwell on the ""basics & beginnings"" of our faith, that this film is pretty much what Modern Christianity does and dwells on in totality...""the basics and beginnings of faith"" in God and acts of INITIAL obedience towards a person relationship with Him.

Also, the whole concept of heading for a ""celestial-city"" is the focus of the film, where you'll be ""happy, joyful, and get a crown, with eternal life.""  Again, those are the beginning basics, but Modern Christianity (in our opinion) focuses on those topics to the UTMOST degree and seminaries take those basics even further by delving into the SAME THINGS thru history, philosophy, geography, and modernity, but never grows beyond these simple things.  Any reading of the whole Bible tells you, from Genesis to Revelation, that the place Believers in the God of Israel will go to be near God and enjoy His presence will be the Promised Covenanted Land of Israel.  Jerusalem is the ultimate place, according to our Bibles, and not some ""unknown, fairy place in the sky"" that we fly away to.  Without going into a sermon here, on what happens once we meet Mashiakh in the air, i think i've given enough of a picture of why we personally got rid of this film and cannot recommend it.  It's rather childish and short-sighted, and often that is dangerous.

It's kind of ""flighty,"" and typical of Modern Christian thought, and the depth and wealth of the Torah are completely bypassed, marginalized, and even condemned.  The film pounds people with thoughts of getting to a ""celestial city"" in this film as if it were the goal at the end of life's road (most Modern Christians think this way because of sad watery teachings), and it therefore reeks of the strumming of harps and floating in clouds type-thoughts (tongue-in-cheek).  The Scriptures are clear, that all mankind will exist on the earth and that even a renewed heavens and earth will be created at some point.  The Scriptures are even clearer that all mankind will be required to come up to the Lord of Hosts for things like the Feast of Sukkot, ""New Moons,"" and ""Sabbaths"" in various batches/trips, as THE place we all want to be and THE goal (in being with the Lord).  Modern Christianity has been taught a very light, milk-drinking, semi-truthful (i mean that well...as all of this, i'm not trying to condemning anybody!), and VERY SHORT-SIGHTED view of what happens when we are resurrected or when the End of Days arrives (whichever happens first). The ""Celestial City"" should be Jerusalem, and ultimately the Holy New JERUSALEM with 12 gates for the 12 tribes of Israel, and not some fairy tale thought.  Life will go on...but in a more intended capacity, by the Creator's hand.

More than my two cents, but we all say ""don't buy.""",1298073600,,3246,4.7287234042553195

Also there was the make up issue, although Apollyon's face was well made up, horns and all... his hands did not have a scrap of make up on them. This was a distraction since it was obvious that it was a guy with a costume and only facial make up. This is the kind of thing that you would expect in a school play.

The film has a great musical score and catches the essence of the book. However the lines and the characters were structured in such a naive way that you could easily guess the next step for the character.

In order for these films to get a wider audience and the respect of movie critics, they need to pay greater attention to the details, so they can get away from the 'cheap christian film' stigma.",1285286400,,963,4.228260869565218

So, it was wonderful to find a christian adventure movie that we both enjoyed and found so many parts of it as applicable to our lives. The screenwriters amazingly were able to compress the original King James -and some scenes in the book that would drag on for quite some time- into delectable bites of symbolism. Pilgrims Progress being the rich symbolical work that it is - it is easy to pick out different scenes and find things that apply to your christian walk (especially when we've strayed off the path - has anyone ever stayed at the castle of the Giant Despair- hmmm?)Also, to see that desire (and the desperate struggle that it can be at times) of all of our hearts depicted: to enter into eternal life with our Jesus.

Appolyon is a person dressed in black with a white mask who is neither scary nor dangerous.  He makes a person laugh.  Why don't film makers do something serious?  Appolyon should have looked and sounded like the Balrog in ""Lord of the Rings.""  The armor that Christian is given is a bit of ridiculous plastic.  ""Prince Caspian,"" is authentic because he wears real armor.  For interesting illustrations for this classic, I would suggest, ""Dangerous Journey,"" William B. Eerdmans, Grand Rapids, Michigan.  I would not suggest purchasing this version of ""Pilgrim's Progress.""

3474227,4,B001AYJ2Y0,"All in all I like this movie more than say ""Fireproof"" or ""Second Glance"". They had just too much negativism in the characters...

But there was not as much of this in say ""Escape from Hell"" or ""Final Exit"" which were both excellent films and my first choices for discussion with others.

This fim however had trouble keeping you interested and watching.  There we always so many questions popping into your mind thus taking you away from the lesson....  It did not give you enough detail and was so long and fairy tale like that it did not have the impact the two above had.

Why did he travel this particular path...but no one else he met had taken the path Pilgram did?  Everyone he met came to his path from a different path or directions so it seemed rather than the narrow path there were many paths and some actually allowed people to jump past the trials and tribulations he had to endure...

So is every path different with different temptations or evil characters?

How did they get past or who were all the bad people or creatures they encountered.  the traps and dragons and such were not on their paths because they were on the path he took...just didn't make sense.

Surely he couldn't be the only person taking, or on, this path.  I understand the concept of you have to walk your own path...but something about it seemed odd.

Where ""Escape from Hell"" did not have so many questions following the main characters.

The guy in the town that wound up in the castle dungeon with him...how did he get a scroll?  Maybe I missed how he got there in the first place.

And the story made the main character just a little bit too nieve after all he had already been through (stupid) when he always made the wrong choices.  Like gee, getting a map and NOT looking at it once! And found himself following a guy with a hood he did not identify even when told to do so. Come on.

I liked the move, and the message, don't get me wrong...thus the four star rating...and God knows we need to reach as many people as possible with these types of messages...to watch out for the countless distractions in life...but it might have been great for them to get an average person to read the script or preview the movie and say hey what about this or couldn't you make this more real?

It almost had the feel of a quick make to make money and that would be terrible for a Christian Movie to have that as it's main goal.  Not the content of the message or the actions of the plot.

I will undoubtedly watch it again and might cozy up to it more but it did not have the impact on me that ""Escape from Hell"" did and it had the same main characters.

Still a good watch, maybe for young people with and adult to explain.",1254528000,,2709,4.324752475247525

3474234,5,B001AYJ2Y0,"I just recently watched Pilgrim's Progess: Journey to Heaven, and was completely satisfied with the experience. I would recomemend this movie to any Christian and/or fan of John Bunyan's classis story.

First of all, though the problems with the movie are few, I want to address them for the sake of giving an accurate review. The special effects are good (they don't look like a cheesy Saturday morning cartoon), but they are more like what you would see on a decent TV show than comparing with a Hollywood Blockbuster. That being said, the effects were well done. Also, as the director Danny Carrales correctly pointed out in a brief message on the DVD, not everything that is in the book has made it to the film. Like other movie adaptations, this one is only on Christian's story and does not address Christiana's travels (which was about half of John Bunyan's book), and some of Christian's story is shortened or ommited.

All that being said, the message of John Bunyan is faithfully conveyed in a powerful way. Granted that it takes a couple of minutes to get used to seeing the modern settings and clothing, but I don't see this a problem because Bunyan was writing to his contemporary audience, so making the message seem applicable to our lives is keeping with the spirit of the book. The acting was superb, and really served to help the viewer relate to the characters. The dialogue was strait and to the point and well-executed without feeling awkward. The cinematography was excelent in serving to ground the veiwer in place and mood. But what I thought the best part of the movie was is how it constantly hammers the Gospel Message from the start all the way through to the very end. I couldn't keep count of the times that the message of Salvation from sin through the Grace of Jesus Christ alone was clearly stated. This film did not pull any punches or gloss over the Gospel Message an any way, shape, or form.

A quick note to parents: this film is not rated, but it does have a couple violent parts in it (you may recall the battle with Apolyon) and some disturbing content (hell is suppose to be disturbing). This film would not get a rating higher than PG with the MPAA, but parents with younger or more sensitive children may want to preview the movie first.

Overall, I would have to say that as a longtime fan of John Bunyan's classic story, this is the first movie adaptation that satisfied. I highly recommend it for anyone looking for a non-watered down Christian film as well as anyone who is not a Christian but is interested in what the true Message of Salvation is.",1244505600,,2596,4.600431965442764

Watching this reminded me of what it's all about and how important it is to keep running the race to the high mark of my calling and not let the enemy bring me down through doubt and despair.

3474260,1,B001AYJ2Y0,"If you believe in eternal security, otherwise known as once saved always saved, you may think this movie is way off base.  First the main character started off being named Christian.  Later he found salvation.  After finding salvation, he had an encounter with Apollon, and fought him for his soul.  Before that I believe, he was in a place called the house of interpretation, where a door was opened and a palace was shown which represented heaven.  Then a warrior fought his way to get there, meaning to me that he fought his way into heaven.  Christian was looking for The Celestial City, and when he finally arrived the door was opened and a voice (I don't recall if people were shown) sang out something like ""come in, come in, an eternity you will win"".  Well did he need to fight for it or win it?  Also after he found salvation, he received an invitation to enter the celestial city.  Later someone else recieved the invitation as well his wife, without ever having received salvation.

I'm not sure of the significance of the movie, or whether it followed the book (I never read it), but I wouldn't recommend this to anyone if you expect them to understand the Gospel from it.  I'm not sure what this movie is trying to say.",1227398400,,1233,4.53393665158371

I loaned it to my pastor which said there is so much ""Truth"" in this movie, he is looking forward to us showing it. The movie company even has tickets you can buy so members can use them to invite friends.
It really shows the decisions many Christians face each day. It also shows we need to keep our eyes focused on the Lord as we journey through life and not let the devil lead us astray. The devil does like to deceive and you can see that in the movie. My prayer is the Lord uses this movie to help people make it through the narrow gate.

Because of my love for this book I am still hoping that a film maker would simply follow the book more painstakingly as the film makers of the Harry Potter series did for those movies.

3474269,5,B001AYJ2Y0,"""Many of today's filmmakers are focusing their lenses on important stories as they seek to change the world through their movies"". This DVD is an example of this very thing.

""Christian, in A Pilgrim's Progress, is a stranger in a strange land, curious, hopeful ... and a bit intimidated"" and this was clearly demonstrated and portrayed nicely. I was not disappointed in this DVD and was able to empathize and apply it to my own life just like so many have done with the reading of the original book of this title. Meaning, the movie adheres fairly tightly to the original book and I wasn't caught up in trying to figure out the liberties taken by the film industry. I was truly able to enjoy the movie and how it flowed and appreciated and felt the benefit of being able to see the books pages come to life and in motion right before me.

Production value was good. Even good + with some fairly ok computer generated insertions (some can be so hokey and these did not leave you asking ""why did they do that as it just took away from the feel of a genuine experience"" or ""am I playing a game on the computer screen now""?). Acting was good + and convincing. They were able to draw you in and past.....in contrast to leaving you on the fringe wondering why they were chosen to depict the part (and in hopes they had a different day job as well).

The bottom line for me was this....the true intent (and content) of the story came through despite the fact it didn't have a million dollar budget to do it. Our children, (8 and 6) who have read the child's version of this story, also very much enjoyed it and have watched it more than once. Granted, it is not the eye-candy we are accustomed to in so many of the movies out there with cinematography (Lord of the Rings, Narnia) and yet it is one that is still very well put together.  It is a ""keeper for the collection"" and we have even purchased it as a gift for others (including a copy of the book to go with it).

I have gone throught many of those encounters myself, that the films explains to us, and let me tell you that following Jesus Christ is NOT EASY. But if you have accepted him as your LORD and SAVIOR, the CONFORTER(Holy Spirit) is there with you to help you go throught it all. This movie is worth watching, and is worth every penny, it's more than just a film, this is a brief summary of how a REAL CHRISTIAN lives day in and day out.

If you haven't taken stock of your relationship with God lately by challenging yourself, you will have lots to gain by watching Pilgrims Progress. I found myself walking along with the characters, all along challenging myself to deepen my walk with Jesus and challenging myself as to whether or not I can serve as I should. The movie walks at just the right pace to keep your attention and to draw you from one challenge to the next. The characters make it easy to put yourself in their shoes as well as to relate to others that cross you life's paths. My father-in-law has not sat completely through a movie at my house in the past 15 years. He has always nodded off. But, at the conclusion of Pilgrims Progress last night, he commented to me how it was the first movie that held his attention from start to finish. He told me that every time he got ready to leave the room, something else grabbed his attention. I believe so strongly that this movie can and will be used by God that I have purchased multiple copies to give to my neighbors. My family has watched this five times so far in the past week: my children love it (10 year old girl and 12 year old boy). This may seem excessive perhaps, but there is something in this movie that speaks to my soul-that says ""we cannot give up; we must pursue Jesus at all costs."" It spurs me on toward my goal of pleasing Jesus and of not being ashamed at His return. You will do well to purchase this for yourself and see what I'm talking about.

So, I thought ""How can you beat Pilgrim's Progress - it is a classic of Christianity?"" Unfortunately, this is not John Bunyan's story.  Oh, it is faithful to many of the elements of the original but there are additions and subtractions that change the story.  In the book, when Christian is at the cross and his burden falls off it rolls into the empty tomb - one of the most important images in the whole story.  In the movie the burden simply dissapears.

The pace of the movie is very slow and they fill the space with evangelical cliches which over simplify the gospel.  Bunyan would be dissapointed with the theology imported into his story. This dumbing down of Evangelical Christianity is prevelant through the movie.

I was dissapointed with the acting, the special effects and the changed theology.  Don't waste your time with this one.  Read the book!",1221955200,,969,4.686390532544379

All in all a great allegory, very well done. Love the cinematics. Love recognizing my own place on this path, where I've been, warnings of what is to come, even recognizing the error that Christian made in asking questions of his enemy - his turning his eyes from the path to the accusations of the enemy and engaging in that conversation rather than turning away and looking forward left him vulnerable to attack.

The effects were like made for Christian TV. It felt like the movie was trying to be Christian rather than just being what it should have been. I don't think the movie was worth watching unless you love movie made for TV, then go right ahead and enjoy. As I said, if it had a budget it could have been great depending on the director.

8280231,1,B001AYJ2Y0,"The reasonS I did not like this movie were a few...
First: I got it to watch with my family as some suggested and the kids were a little scared of the demonic and alien looking creatures here and there through the first part of the movie (I do not know about the last part because we did not finish it but shut it off... my suggestion, watch Polycarp Destroyer of Gods instead which will give kids a good idea of Christian struggles and persecution -to some degree- and will not give them demonic nightmares).
Second: It was very hard to follow and get the points (I already knew of the story so I got the idea but the kids were completely lost, and trying to explain every few seconds was not working out very well, maybe they are too young yet to understand allegory).
Third: The modernization of the characters and apparel took away from the story to a degree however that is overlookable if the first two points were not a problem.
Fourth: I do not pick on the acting in movies because it is not a big deal to me if the story is written well and easy to follow.
This movie though had poor acting I will say for those who are into good vs. poor acting and it did take away from the feeling that should have been present in the movie due to Christian's struggles.
Overall I did not like the movie but like I said I did not finish it but threw it away.
I have decided though it is best to forget movies all together (where they are typically time eaters and do not help one keep vigilant if watched for entertainment purposes) and instead make your family time Bible reading, praying and studying time and don't compromise the gospel message, all who seek to live Godly WILL be persecuted it says and those who seek to keep their life in this world will lose it but those who lose their life in this world for Christ's sake and the gospel truly will find it or keep it eternally. Following Christ is not about getting in other peoples faces either as a troublesome meddler who has no true love for who they preach to and puffing themselves up like they have never or have no need to be forgiven by God in His mercy. Obey His commands or in other words repent of your sins and trust in Christ for salvation and forgiveness and follow Him obediently continuing to confess your sins to the end (repentance of sins is pointed to in the law of ten commandmentand the new but old command of ""love"" as John calls it is the fulfillment of the law but not cerimonials just the ten) and keep His testimony and endure faithfully to the end even unto death and you will be saved it says. Don't be fooled by the MODERN false gospel message that says ""once saved always saved"" because that is to put your faith in your experience and a point in time instead of in Christ and His words that teach you obedience. Even Ezekiel 18:21-24 speaks of this, ""21But if the wicked will turn from all his sins that he hath committed, and keep all my statutes, and do that which is lawful and right, he shall surely live, he shall not die. 22All his transgressions that he hath committed, they shall not be mentioned unto him: in his righteousness that he hath done he shall live. 23Have I any pleasure at all that the wicked should die? saith the Lord GOD: and not that he should return from his ways, and live?
24But when the righteous turneth away from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, and doeth according to all the abominations that the wicked man doeth, shall he live? All his righteousness that he hath done shall not be mentioned: in his trespass that he hath trespassed, and in his sin that he hath sinned, in them shall he die.""
and Ezekiel 18:4-19, ""4Behold, all souls are mine; as the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son is mine: the soul that sinneth, it shall die.
5But if a man be just, and do that which is lawful and right, 6And hath not eaten upon the mountains, neither hath lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, neither hath defiled his neighbour's wife, neither hath come near to a menstruous woman, 7And hath not oppressed any, but hath restored to the debtor his pledge, hath spoiled none by violence, hath given his bread to the hungry, and hath covered the naked with a garment; 8He that hath not given forth upon usury, neither hath taken any increase, that hath withdrawn his hand from iniquity, hath executed true judgment between man and man, 9Hath walked in my statutes, and hath kept my judgments, to deal truly; he is just, he shall surely live, saith the Lord GOD.
10If he beget a son that is a robber, a shedder of blood, and that doeth the like to any one of these things, 11And that doeth not any of those duties, but even hath eaten upon the mountains, and defiled his neighbour's wife, 12Hath oppressed the poor and needy, hath spoiled by violence, hath not restored the pledge, and hath lifted up his eyes to the idols, hath committed abomination, 13Hath given forth upon usury, and hath taken increase: shall he then live? he shall not live: he hath done all these abominations; he shall surely die; his blood shall be upon him.
14Now, lo, if he beget a son, that seeth all his father's sins which he hath done, and considereth, and doeth not such like, 15That hath not eaten upon the mountains, neither hath lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, hath not defiled his neighbour's wife, 16Neither hath oppressed any, hath not withholden the pledge, neither hath spoiled by violence, but hath given his bread to the hungry, and hath covered the naked with a garment, 17That hath taken off his hand from the poor, that hath not received usury nor increase, hath executed my judgments, hath walked in my statutes; he shall not die for the iniquity of his father, he shall surely live. 18As for his father, because he cruelly oppressed, spoiled his brother by violence, and did that which is not good among his people, lo, even he shall die in his iniquity.
The Soul who Sins will Die
19Yet say ye, Why? doth not the son bear the iniquity of the father? When the son hath done that which is lawful and right, and hath kept all my statutes, and hath done them, he shall surely live. 20The soul that sinneth, it shall die. The son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son: the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him.""
By the way be sure not to take the mark of the beast when it comes or you will never be forgiven it by God it is written in Revelation, lots of deceivers in the modern Christianity today. Paul warned wolves would come after his departure not sparing the flock and that was a long time back what do you think it is like now... tea gets darker and more bitter the longer it steeps I think.

8280233,5,B001AYJ2Y0,"I must confess that I don't especially enjoy reading books written in archaic language eons ago, so struggle in finding the right balance between making sure my teens are familiar with those books that all educated people should read without making them hate reading. I want to introduce them to literature they'll actually enjoy (isn't one definition of ""the classics"" books nobody would read if lit teachers didn't force them to?). When my son struggled reading Pilgrim's Progress, I suggested (hesitantly) that this might be one that we could watch as a movie instead of struggling through the text.  I am SO glad we found this up-to-date edition because I watched the movie in the early '80s and wasn't especially looking forward to seeing it again. This updated edition was fantastic. We enjoyed the storyline without getting bogged down in language from long ago.  And, having now enjoyed the story and gotten a grasp of the plot, reading the book seems a lot more doable. I highly recommend this book for an enjoyable family movie night.",1516060800,,1044,4.926136363636363
