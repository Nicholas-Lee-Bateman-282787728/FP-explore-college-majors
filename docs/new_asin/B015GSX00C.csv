8733529,2,B015GSX00C,"Travis (Mark Leonard Winter) is a psychologist who treats patients. He became too close to patient Rachel (Kate Cheel) who tried to walk on air. Feeling guilty he resorts to addictive pain killers, and ends up in a group run by Father Jay (Steve Le Marquand). He is attracted to Grace (Tilda Cobham-Hervey) who helps out. The group is run like a boot camp and a cult, as Father Jay treats the soul for the physical addiction. Travis has flashbacks to his painful times with Rachel and how he may have ""pushed"" her over the edge...figuratively speaking. About an hour into the film Travis has an epiphany which changes the direction of the film and in a way waking it up, unfortunately it was too little too late.

Film was pretty boring. You might want to take a pain killer to watch it. While addiction was part of the story, it doesn't really deal with the topic, it just uses it to weave a tale.

Guide: F-bomb, brief oral sex. No nudity.",1454198400,3,941,4.465116279069767
8733530,1,B015GSX00C,"I'm sure this will touch some people in an artsy way, but I was just bored, waiting for something real to happen. It is very predictable and really has no true ending. Spend your money somewhere else.",1452124800,2,200,4.4324324324324325
8733531,4,B015GSX00C,"Contemporary cults are more commonplace than people think, mostly because they don't tend to make the news unless they go out of their way to get attention or are too careless about maintaining a low profile. Some are borne out of traditional religions, others invent their own religion, and others are something else entirely. The cult (complete with the old favorite of a patriarch) in One Eyed Girl is a group of individuals desperate to escape addictions, but to say much more than that would unnecessarily spoil the plot.

The protagonist is Travis, who despite being a psychiatrist (ostensibly helping others in a South Australian mental ward) is struggling with some serious demons of his own. Somewhat incredibly, he falls in with previously mentioned cult as a last ditch effort to not die. Results may vary when one tries this sort of thing. The peculiarity about One Eyed Girl is that it takes forever to figure out where the filmmakers are trying to take you. About halfway through you are led to believe it's perhaps a certain type of narrative, and them BAM!, you are off into a different story again.

The beginning of One Eyed Girl is choppy, but this is likely intentional to convey the confusion and onerous cul-de-sac Travis finds himself in after he helps to precipitate a devastating event. In the first 20 minutes or so you may be saying to yourself, ""this is perplexing, I hope I won't need to watch this twice just to understand it."" And then just when you think you've figured it out, you realize there's more. One Eyed Girl is (literally) a psychological thriller, and one with fine acting and fierce cinematography. The caveat: it's not for everyone.

The Blu-ray looks fantastic. Extras / Bonus Features:
1. Commentary with 3 people in the cast and crew, covering the writing, casting, production, and editing.
2. Featurettes: Cast (4:17), Music (2:45), Production Design (3:08), The Beginning (4:04), Train (3:12)",1450742400,5,1942,4.9327217125382266
8733532,4,B015GSX00C,"ONE-EYED GIRL was a really good film, in my opinion. It was a different kind of story and the story itself, had many layers and sub plots going on. I thought all of that just added to the movie and made it more interesting. The actors who played the 2 main roles were excellent and I liked that one of the main characters was a young, troubled psychiatrist. To me, that elevated the story because one doesn't often think of psychiatrists going off the deep end, themselves, and especially be indoctrinated into a cult. The character development was done well, enough to make the viewer care what happens to them, the cinematography was beautifully done and there were lots of twists and turns that kept the viewer wondering what was going to happen next. I did not find the story predictable and I thought the ending was fairly realistic, even though there were some parts of the movie as a whole that I would've liked to have seen a little more developed. I wish the writers had given the viewer a bit more insight into Travis, the young psychiatrist's relationship to Rachel, a former patient that affected him very powerfully.",1450483200,3,1129,4.65
8733533,3,B015GSX00C,"One Eyed Girl is a thriller about a man drawn into a cult-like sect. Travis (Mark Leonard Winter) is a young, mentally fragile psychiatrist on the brink of a nervous breakdown after the death of a former patient. His life appears to take a turn for the better when he meets Grace (Tilda Cobham-Hervey, 52 Tuesdays), a mysterious teenager who represents a secret church that promises salvation to even the most troubled of its members.

Intrigued, Travis joins the group and meets its leader, the charismatic Father Jay (Steve Le Marquand), who indoctrinates him into the sects often radical practices. When a series of tragedies befalls Father Jay and his flock, Travis must decide if his loyalty lies with Father Jay, the elusive Grace, or himself.

The performances of Le Marquand and Winter are strong and their roles well written. Australian writer/director Nick Matthews, rather than fall back on thriller flick cliches, paints their characters in shades of grey, keeping the viewer guessing and maintaining suspense as to how the two men will affect each other. The tone of the picture is deadly serious  almost frigid. There is no comic relief in this study of the effect of guilt and the search for inner peace. One Eyed Girl is Matthews first feature film.

Special features on the Blu-ray release include commentary with Matthews, writer/actor Craig Behenna, and producer David Ngo; and five behind-the-scenes featurettes on casting, music, production design, and the genesis of the project.",1449014400,,1501,5.114285714285714
