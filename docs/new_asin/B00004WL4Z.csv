Considered the best of Basil Rathbone 's  portrayal  of Sherlock holmes,  this film delivers thrilling entertainment and a wonderful look back at movies of yesteryear.  Blackmail, hypnotism and murder, Yay!  What's there not to like?",1502755200,,248,5.594594594594595
7925578,4,B00004WL4Z,"Sherlock Holmes The Woman in Green & Dressed to Kill

These two movies were adapted from the Sherlock Holmes stories. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle wrote the four long stories and fifty-six short stories. They have lessons as part of their entertainment. Doyle was interested in criminology and used true crimes as inspiration for these stories. Human nature (greed) continues. These movies are not copies of the original stories, but used parts and adapted them to modern times. They are worth watching as entertainment and about the culture of that era. The original stories are always worth reading; you will appreciate them more as an adult. Read the individual reviews for more information on each movie.

Sherlock Holmes and the Woman in Green [1945] tells about a number of unsolved murders. Holmes deduces the scheme but lacks evidence. He visits Lydia at her home then encounters danger. Can help arrive in time?

Dressed to Kill [1946] is about stolen music boxes. One has an engraved plate that can be used to print counterfeit 5 notes that cant be distinguished from genuine 5 notes! Can Sherlock Holmes recover the plates and catch the criminals?",1453248000,,1152,4.989583333333333
7925579,5,B00004WL4Z,"Marengo Films is proud to announce that it has just finished upgrading the quality of both films on this DVD. Software that was not invented five years ago has allowed Marengo to complete a PRISTINE MAKEOVER. The movies were put through a complete new sound design, and color correction. We feel these are the best quality of these two HOLMES films on the market.",1104710400,,363,4.6875
7925580,4,B00004WL4Z,"This Marengo disc is a good buy.  The quality while not perfect does not make the eyes or ears vomit.  Like other reviewers have stated, The Women In Green is the nicest of the two.  Dressed To Kill seems washed out and there is not enough distinction between the blacks and whites.  Both movies are very watchable.  I did not hear any annoying hissing in either movie.",1083369600,,369,4.447761194029851
7925581,5,B00004WL4Z,"There is only one Holmes... Basil... and Nigel is the perfect foil... Dr. Watson. I have watched this DVD three times this year and have loved every minute of it... all three times! I read several reviews panning this DVD right before I wrote this and feel like maybe the competition is sandbagging this company... The Woman in Green is a SUPERB print and the sound is crystal clear as far as I can tell... Dressed to kill was a ""Lighter"" print than Dressed... but still it was very watchable, and the sound was perfect so I certainly am either going blind or something is 'Afoot' which I suspect... the DVD is a bargain for the price and if you love Holmes I would say buy it, you really won't be disappointed.",1063238400,4,711,4.393939393939394
7925582,1,B00004WL4Z,"Since MPI has restored all of the classic Sherlock Holmes movies on DVD from 35mm fine grain prints, there is absolutely NO reason to buy anybody elses grainy release!",1051142400,3,167,4.793103448275862
7925583,5,B00004WL4Z,"This is a great set of two classic Holmes. Pull out the popcorn and enjoy. One print, I forget which one, was a little ""lighter"" in contrast than the other... but still very watchable. The sound has obviously been cleaned up on both films and given the age of the movies, Marengo has done a fine job. Highly recommend.",981763200,6,318,4.406779661016949
