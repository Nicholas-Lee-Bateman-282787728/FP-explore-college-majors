Repression is the father of neurosis says a TV doctor. [Has this been proved scientifically?] The TV Lady is doing a story about a suspected killer (as a decoy). Karen White enters a porno video store and then a private booth to meed Eddie. Two cops enter the store, open the door and fire shots to end the reign of terror from a killer in Los Angeles. Karen now has an emotional problem. I don't remember. Reporters enter the room of the suspect and view his artwork. [The police weren't there?] Karen goes on TV but freezes; she is removed and replaced. She cant remember what happened. A doctor recommends rest and vacation for her amnesia. She and her husband Bill visit a resort, the Colony. We see the people there. [Recognize that old man?] There is music, singing, and a pig roast. That night she hears howls. The wind or a dog? Karen hears animal noises at night.

The dead suspect, Eddie, has disappeared from the morgue! Two women go walking in the night when their flashlight goes out. Cattle mutilations? Karen tries to recall that traumatic event but cant. A bookseller touts his wares. Marsha will cook a rabbit later. Something attacks Bill in the dark. A couple watches an old movie at night (The Wolfman from 1940). The next day Bill now has an appetite for meat. Karen has dreams at night. She hears howls at night and records them. Bill meets Marsha at night. [Do they need an orthodontist?] Karen goes exploring in the daytime. She finds a small cottage and enters, then takes photos. Suddenly a furry beast attacks! A hatchet severs its paw, Karen runs to the main building. Was that a nightmare? Scratches on Bills back are a clue!

Reporter Terry goes to investigate the Colony and looks into the files. She calls reporter Christopher at the news station to tell what she found. Suddenly a furry beast disturbs her search! Can the Sheriff send help? Karen finds her body! Next she sees Eddie again! How is this possible? He changes shape before her eyes and becomes a threatening monster. Karen throws a yellow acid on him and runs away. But she is caught! She is told the secret of the Colony. Shut up, Doc! Karen is too well-known to simply disappear. Christopher arrives with his rifle and special order bullets. Where is Terry? Christopher finds the werewolves and begins shooting. The werewolves are trapped in the barn, which is set afire to kill them. Can they get away? Two more werewolves show up! They have to warn people and make them believe! [Would you believe this?] Karen will report the news of the fire at the Colony. There is a secret society living among people! Karen offer irrefutable proof! There is a final scene in a tavern. One customer orders hamburger rare. What happens next?

This movie could have been better with a better story and writer. It just seems to be missing something. [Compare it to the 1940 movie The Wolfman.] Does it remind you of The Invasion of the Body Snatchers from 1956? Aliens invading society? Werewolves are people who turn into anti-humans to prey upon people. [Do they symbolize Wall Street Financiers and their synthetic credit derivatives that prey upon investors?] It takes a good guy with a gun to stop these beasts, a moral lesson. Will this be allowed in future horror films? The beginning shows scenes that were censored in earlier times. Is there a society to complain about this treatment of werewolves?",1507420800,,3416,4.6883333333333335
