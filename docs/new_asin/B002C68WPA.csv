3903914,4,B002C68WPA,"This is a phrase-by-phrase breakdown of some great Van Halen songs from the David Lee Roth Era. Mark John Sternal is a likeable teacher. View some samples on his website or on youtube to get a feel for his style and make up your own mind. To nail or get close to nailing these songs you will spend a lot of time watching and reviewing the material, so be sure you feel comfortable with his style. Some of the techniques, such as tapping and whammy bar dives will take a good deal of patience if you have not approached them before.",1275264000,7,531,4.267326732673268
3903915,3,B002C68WPA,"These are 3 stars at best, not trying to ding the author too badly.

I only listened through Eruption and parts of Panama so far. I'm not enticed right now to listend to anything else on the DVD. Here where the two star deduction comes from.

First of all, Mark's tone is pretty sucky. This does not sound like EVH at all. This DVD shamelessly pitches Carl Martin pedals, and unfortunately you would not want to buy any of those after hearing the DVD. First of all, you can't tell that there is any Phaser, Flanger or Chorus at all on the recording. Then, the distortion is totally tame and brittle, far from anything close to ""brown"" that EVH produced with his setup.

Second star deduction is from certain obvious inaccuracies in Mark's transcription (talking about Eruption now) and the lack of needed chops to pull off Eddie's stuff. I'm not saying I can do better, but c'mon, Mark, you are creating an instructional DVD, you better do some more woodshedding, man! If you (regular audience who is reading this) want to learn Eruption for example, buy the Guitar World March 2003 edition (no idea whether you can backorder), it has a fantastic transcription in which I only found a few ""inaccuracies"" (meaning my ears hear something slightly different than what's transcribed), and also buy the paramount Transcribe! slower-downer software by Seventh String (the best $25 I ever spent!). (I also have a Guitar One transcription of Eruption that is more of an approximation, don't recommend that one).

If you search on YouTube (most sucky video sharing web page you could ever nightmare of, with absolutely horrible streaming video technology and the most disgusting reader comments possible), you will find one guy who got an astoundingly close sound out of his Axe-Fx, and at least one guy who teaches you Eruption who sounds really close to the original.

Dude, that was a rant! Trying to kill off my back pain with beer ...",1273276800,8,1930,4.783783783783784
3903916,5,B002C68WPA,"This is one of my dream come true DVD. Really thank Mark John Sternal for creating this DVD which contain my favourite song like ""fade to black"" & ""master of puppets"" which are the songs i always wish to learn. It saves a lot of my times which i might have spent by looking at the tablature books reading and understanding. It's really cool. I suggest this product for all the Metallican fans. Enjoy",1267315200,2,399,4.405405405405405
3903917,4,B002C68WPA,"This video is what it says it is a breakdown of the songs listed by Van Halen during the best (in my opinion) period of the band. It starts by showing you the settings (close enough) to what Eddie used on said song such as distortion, phase, tone, volume, mid's, etc..., then goes in to braking the song down into ""phrases"" or riffs if you will played super slow then at half speed. Most of the info could be obtained off youtube or some other fan site, the tabs could be bought and dissected personally - but to have it all in one place already done for you on a whopping 5hr dvd for 25 dollars isn't too bad really. It was worth the money for the time gained, Mark John Sternal (dude has serious hair not to be f'ed with!!) does a good job coping Eddie's tone just wish the tab's had been included. I mean their showed on screen in clear to read notation I just like hard copies (old fashioned). I'm really just holding out for a ""hotlicks"" type video with Eddie himself now that would be totally sweet!!",1263168000,12,1006,4.244791666666667

3903929,4,B002C68WPA,This is my 2nd Phrase X Phase disc ( Van Hallen) Its well done and slow enough to absorb each part ...can get a little dry...but will teach you the whole song.....I am only an Intimidate level basement player but if you willing to take it slow and i highly suggest taking  the time to TAB out the parts you are learning ( since Metallica songs tend to be long  i am currently learning Welcome Home Sanitarium and its not a short track .) then you will get a lot  out of this.,1408147200,,475,4.086021505376344

3903931,3,B002C68WPA,Okay...but falls short...songs sound similar but with way to much attention on effects and amp setting and really never sound like evh....and try ing to sell there brand.  Like I said it's okay...could be a lot better with dif guitarist,1390262400,,236,4.9
3903932,1,B002C68WPA,I got this as a gift. Before ordering I implore you to look up the youtube clips of the author's work. This is not professional caliber guitar playing or tone. This is a hobbyist who has no business making guitar instructional videos. Watch the author's promo video on youtube and then look up Peter Torn's free Eruption tutorial on youtube and it should pretty obvious. Im sure the author has good intent and means well but these videos are rubbish.,1388793600,,450,4.6375
3903933,4,B002C68WPA,"He is very clear on what he is doing. He definately done his homework on Eddie's style, and you can tell enjoys Van Halen's music. It seems he enjoys teaching.",1386979200,,159,4.333333333333333
3903934,5,B002C68WPA,"I bought this because it had good reviews. I love metallica and they are why i play guitar. i was worried that this video wasn't going to be that good because of the youtube video examples played at slow speed. This video is great buy it.
I had the in the style of metallica vhs and it was fake this video is really how to play metallica songs and the songs
chosen are my favorites: seek and destroy, for whom the bell tolls, fade to black, master of puppets, saniterium, one,
And harvester of sorrow.",1377043200,5,501,4.28421052631579
3903935,4,B002C68WPA,This is a great way to learn hard to memorize music!!  Phrases of each song are broken down and explained so you can really learn how to put everything together and play entire songs that you never thought you'd be able to play!,1367798400,,228,4.3023255813953485
3903936,3,B002C68WPA,it was not as good as it was made at to be. it  like watching a b rated movie.  i would not recommand it,1365465600,,104,3.2916666666666665
3903937,5,B002C68WPA,"This video is on par with all his other phrase by phase DVD's, and with that said this is a great learning tool to learn Van Halen.
I read some of the other reviews, and yes, you can complain about the sound or even his playing, but Mark has a contract with Carl Martin products, so it's not like he can use any of the EVH flanger, Wah or choirs. He was, however, able to use the EVH Wolfgang guitar.
I would also recommend GUITAR TAPPING: FROM THE BASICS TO THE HOTTEST LICKS AND TRICKS BK/CD and should you go to Guitar Center, the have VH music on a thumb drive. I believe you are able to have the TAB music play at different time signatures so that you can play along and read the tab.
I did try to look it up online, but I have only seen it in the store.",1356912000,2,759,3.9673202614379086
3903947,3,B002C68WPA,"The instructor does a good job of presenting the material.  His technique is solid, and he's a good teacher, however, his phrasing is wrong in certain areas.  I would recommend this as a good resource for learning these songs.",1342396800,,226,4.769230769230769

3903949,5,B002C68WPA,"This is a good DVD because it breaks the song into small parts and reviews what youve learned. Tab is on the screen... Thats not that a big of a deal i guess. I use every other dvd out there and sometimes they don't have tab. That never bothered me, but what does bother me is when they teach big chunks. I want to remember what I learned and not spend a buch of time going back to remember parts. This small chunk approach is great. I can stop and come back the next day and pick up right where I left off. This guy doesnt have the budget that lick library and other companies have , but thats what is kind of cool about it. Its kind of like learning from the local ""ripper"". Guys that care about the effects...do you even play? I mean who cares about the tone. I want to play the song... I can play with any tone or effect I want. Anyway,great DVD. I wasn't expecting to like it that much. Now that I know what they are like, I'm going to get the Van Halen. Yeah son!!!!!!",1314057600,3,974,4.025773195876289
3903950,5,B002C68WPA,"I almost didn't order this based on some negative reviews by some expert advanced players I would guess, anyways I ordered and I'm glad I did. I'm only a intermediate level player and I find this DVD very helpful I wouldn't otherwise learn as fast as I have. I have books and cds from Troy Stetina and DVDs from Lick library which are also good, the only thing about lick library is it has no tabs on the dvd. I think the best I like about Mark Sternal DVDs is his instructions on different techniques and especially the 75% slowed down versions of the phrases which I have looped and play along until I nail it and then move on. I've been playing eruption for the past few days and still haven't made through the first part at 75% but getting real close. I have a copy of the Eruption transcription from Guitar world May 1995 and compare transcriptions with Mark Sternals, sure there are some differences but nothing to make a stink about, close enough to me. I'm just a hobbyist copying other peoples stuff. I also have the phrase by phrase Led Zeppelin and Metallica's DVDs but haven't started on them yet. Van Halen is more the style I prefer so I started with that. I hope this review was helpful",1311465600,14,1201,4.390134529147982
3903951,4,B002C68WPA,"Good teacher.  Walks you through it slowly breaking everything into small pieces - ""phrase by phrase"".  Great for learning the short leads and the riffs.
The issues are with longer leads, they should have a review after every 4 or so phrases - something like ""so far we have this, this and this"" - but instead we are left waiting until the end of a whole 15 phrase lead before it gets put back together at half speed.  Another plus would be backing tracks, but he does play whole leads at full speed at the start of each section.
also too much time is spent on the pedals - they must have recieved free pedals from the company.",1305590400,,627,4.296610169491525
3903952,1,B002C68WPA,A previous review suggested taking a look on youtube before buying. Excellent suggestion!! There is a whole lot better videos showing you how to play EVH out there. This guy isn't even close. Save your money!,1298592000,3,208,4.805555555555555
3903953,5,B002C68WPA,"This is a great way to learn Metallica. The lessons are great and well taught. I never tried to play Metallica before. I always thought it would be way too hard for me as an intermediate player. I was wrong. Though not ""simple"", it's really not as hard as I had once believed. Everything is there, even a breakdown of the solos. Wish they made more of these Phrase by Phrase DVD's. I can only find AC/DC, Metallica, and Van Halen. Make a Guns N' Roses...please!",1298332800,3,461,4.372093023255814
3903954,5,B002C68WPA,I found this to be a easy dvd to use. I love the way they not only show you but provide the tab at the same time. The way the songs are broken down makes learning the songs manageable and not overwhelming. So you can take your time and learn each part or just the parts you like most. Very pleased with this purchase.,1291420800,,317,3.96875
3903955,5,B002C68WPA,"Okay, you want the best you got the best this is the SH**!
I do own two other DVDs by Mark John Sternal and by far this BLOWS the others away. In fact, this may even blow some of the other Metallica guitar DVDs away as well. I will review in two weeks.
If you are a beginner and want to learn Metallica this DVD is definitely for you. If you are an intermediate guitar player this is for you as well. My two and only two gripes are 1. No PDF TABs and 2. he uses Carl Martin effects. Why I don't know unless the Carl Martin Co. is paying him to advertise for them, and helping him to produce his DVD.
This DVD is the BEST. You get seven (7) songs to learn slowly ""Phase by Phase"", but not painful. The tabs are on the screen just like all his other DVDs (again no TAB PDF on the DVD it's self). And Mark seems to be a very good instructor unlike so many other guitar leaning DVDs that the person on the DVD may be a very good guitar player, but lacks teaching ability.  So if you are wanting to learn some Metallica buy this DVD you will not REGRET IT!!!!!",1283904000,8,1055,3.9530516431924885
3903956,2,B002C68WPA,"This is a decent attempt at getting the basics down. It'll give you some insight to help fill out what you probably already know, but WOW would it help a LOT if the guy teaching it could actually play somewhat like Eddie. His lack of skill was distracting and during the solos often made it very hard to figure where he was in the song.
Curt Mitchell does a much better job. The only problem is he doesn't cover enough of the individual songs.

I sure wish Eddie would put one of these DVDs out. How amazing (and worth some good money) would that be? But there's probably a better chance of spotting mermaids riding flying unicorns on Mars.",1277251200,2,640,4.378151260504202
8363217,5,B002C68WPA,"Went from not being able to play much Van Halen to being able to play Eruption and other songs pretty well.  This is a great DVD, and if you put in the time and practice, you can sound like EVH.  You won't sound exactly like him because, hey, he's one of a kind, but you can sound pretty close.  There's even a section on how to get the VH tone.  Again, you won't get his exact tone, but you can get close.",1525824000,,406,3.9146341463414633

8363221,5,B002C68WPA,I gave it five stars. Its everything it says it is. The instructions are clear however it like anything on guitar requires practice practice practice. If you want to learn these songs its the way to go.,1441324800,,202,4.486486486486487

8363225,4,B002C68WPA,Very helpful in helping to learn the songs,1416355200,,42,4.375
8363226,3,B002C68WPA,"PROs
- A lot of songs
- Broken down into manageable pieces
- Instruction is a good start

CONs
- Carl Martin must have funded the video or been a key investor in it, because it plays like a Carl Martin advertisement
- Effects settings are never audibly demonstrated for individual effects. He shows setting for Carl Martin pedals only, and never let's you hear the individual sound of that effect once set up. Therefore, you can't really duplicate the sound on a different pedal of similar style.
- Seems to have some inaccuracies in transcription. But is probably still a good resource to explore.
- Overpriced at $25...$17.99 seems more the norm...and more appropriate.

Overall Summary
The instructional video is ok, but not great. It has on screen tab, which is both readable and helpful. The instruction is decent and if you have not approached Van Halen before, it's a good starting point. But there appear to be some inaccuracies and I was also really irritated by the way the sound/tone and effects were approached. When presenting effects they basically said ""This is the Carl Martin (fill in effect) and I set the knobs like this,"" then immediately proceeded to introduce the next effect the same way, without ever demonstrating the sound that should be coming out of any individual pedal. Therefore, unless you have the specific pedal, there is no way to know if your settings are sounding similar for that effect. Although...based on his sound I'm not sure you want to. I have not explored the whole video, but I found myself a little put off by it and not that excited about picking it up to proceed on to other songs after the first session I spent with it. The second session I spent with it, I noticed the instructors play was really sloppy in places...even on the half speed play. So I see where some other reviewers commented on his technique negatively. With all that said, it's a lot of instruction, like 5 hours, for the price and I think Van Halen fans will get some helpful information from this video...but it could be better and has some real gaps compared to most other instructional videos I've used (which is a quite a few!)",1410307200,,2152,4.675461741424802
