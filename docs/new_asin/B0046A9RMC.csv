4266950,5,B0046A9RMC,"In 2001, the world was introduced to the greatest fairy tale never told. It was the story of a grumpy ogre who just wanted to be left alone and instead was chosen to take the adventure of a lifetime. For 9 years the story of Shrek has been a huge part of film and pop culture and is one of the greatest family film franchises ever. Now, with the 4th and final installment the entire story is being released in a complete box set. It includes a ton of special features including all the holiday specials, which really makes it a true complete collection.

Shrek is a great story because it is a well written parody of the traditional fairy tale. It brings all the traditional fairy tale characters and puts a few hysterical spins on them. (My personal favorite is in S4 when the Pied Piper playes 'Sure Shot' on his flute) Also there is a little bit of hostility to Disney throughout the Shrek Saga, because Dreamworks does consist of a few ex-Disneyites so the jokes are pretty obvious digs. The cast is probably the sagas strong point with Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy and Cameron Diaz. Then you add a ton of other brilliant character actors and comedians and you get comedy gold. The list includes: John Lithgow, John Cleese, Antonio Banderes, Julie Andrews, Justin Timberlake, Larry King, Rupert Everette, Maya Rudolph, Eric Idle, Amy Poeler, Craig Robinson, Meredith Viera and more! Each part of the story is unique, some more likable than others, but if you look at it as a whole it is a great story.

Now that the whole story has been told the true point of the story is not about fairy tales and mythical creatures, but life in general.  Shrek goes from meeting his true love to taking care of a family and all the hardships and responsibilities that one encounters. Even though the story is meant to be out of the ordinary there are so many relatable features that can be seen in the characters. Shrek is a masterpiece and a treasure in modern cinema. If you purchase the box set I guarantee it will be one of your greatest treasures.",1290470400,11,2038,4.517615176151762

We have to ask ourselves just why is it that  anyone would laugh at vulgar humor such as this.  Do they laugh because something is truly funny or, as I suspect, do we laugh out of sheer disbelief at what we've just heard?  Sadly, these films are directed at those who enjoy low-brow humour.  Honestly, after watching these so-called ""cartoons"" films, I felt both ashamed and dirty.",1454457600,,500,4.767441860465116

It also seems to be somewhat of a good investment. Since the price on this is only increasing even on the used sets. It's much better than trying to collect them each separately. And the films themselves hold up quite well since their original release. Great family entertainment. The film's definitely are set to appeal to the whole family rather than merely children, and that's to their benefit. I hadn't seen first couple since the original release in the theater, and they really hold up. Given the test of time. I would definitely recommend this set and I would try to buy it sooner rather than later. given how the price keeps rising. Enjoy",1409875200,,776,4.55

I received the package, which says the complete collection (the disc box cover was broken) but inside it contained only 3 discs with a card where the 4th disk (and movie) are supposed to be able to redeem the card for the 4th disc.  Not what I expected as the offer was for the COMPLETE collection, but okay, still not an issue as if says ""your free 3D copy of Shrek Forever After awaits you"".  I go to the order form and it asks for serial number and original UPC to redeem.  There is no UPC on the disc box cover (which says for promotional use only, not for retail).  The card also gives the option for online redemption.  However, the online redemption also asks for serial number and model number which are not to be found.

So, long story short, I have no way of obtaining the 4th movie I paid for when I purchased the ""complete 4 disc collection"", the disc box cover is broke, and apparently what I purchased was not supposed to be sold.",1400112000,8,999,4.281914893617022

4267312,5,B0046A9RMC,"All four feature-length films in one box. Watching them on out flat screen TV was just like the experience of seeing them in the theater.

Years ago I bought the original DVDs and since it was Christmas time, they included an audio CD called ""Shrek The Halls"" which was cute. It wouldn't have hurt anything for them to have included it in this box-set.",1398556800,,352,4.5

4267314,5,B0046A9RMC,"If you've never seen Shrek, I don't want to spoil it for you, so I won't say anything about the plot. Suffice to say this is an animated comedy the whole family can enjoy. The humor works on every level, and there's something here that will appeal to any age group. This set of BluRay discs is pretty reasonably priced for what you get. Each of the four movies is about 90 minutes in run time, and both the image and audio quality are excellent.  Something you may not know: The first three movies are 16:9 aspect ratio (1920x1080), whereas #4, Shrek Forever After, is 2.35:1, or 1920x842 when you crop off the top and bottom letterboxing. I was surprised that they would change the format like that for only 1 out of 4 movies in the same series.  Anyway, go grab your pitchfork, a torch, and a big bucket of popcorn and enjoy your trip to Far, Far Away!",1398211200,,854,4.33125

Each movie has an individual case, which is a lot nicer than other box sets that put all of the discs in sleeves or all together. The box is cardboard and houses the 4 movies.

We picked this up thinking it would replace our old Shrek DVDs. The blu-ray is beautiful, and it comes dubbed in about a dozen languages, but there are no English subtitles or closed captioning! I'm ridiculously disappointed in DreamWorks and Samsung for putting out a copy of a childrens' movie in the year 2010 without subtitles for deaf and hard of hearing kids in the audience.

We'll have to sell this used because we can't watch it in my household. And that's extremely disappointing.

4267390,5,B0046A9RMC,"After finally purchasing a Blu-ray player in Dec. 2012 to go with our new Panasonic Viera ET5 HDTV, we thought it would be a good idea to congregate all our Shrek DVDs and Shrek 1 on VHS in one place and in one format. What a difference! The resolution and enhanced detail are amazing on Blu-ray - the difference is especially noticeable making the leap from a VHS. Of course, every Shrek movie has an awesome soundtrack so the audio is pretty great too. I love the entire Shrek franchise, with Shrek 2 being my favorite and Shrek 3 my least favorite. My husband and I are over-40 types who found love late in the game, so there are some really pertinent themes that we can really relate to. Great lessons for my daughter about stereotypical and preconceived notions of ""beauty"" and attractiveness as well.

4267394,5,B0046A9RMC,"There is some difference of opinion about whether these discs are 3D or not.
All 4 of mine are definitely  3D. I was rather leery about all the 5 star ratings being done on the same day.
But 2 points sold me.
1. That the product has 3D on the front cover.
2. That at the time I bought it, including shipping it was only 9 dollars more than the regular Blu-rays.

I bought it from the seller Alan_Sales

The only con for me is that there are no English subtitles.
There are German, Korean, Chinese, Russian and Turkish on disc 2. It seems like one of those was missing from disc 1.

It was a very good purchase for me and I would recommend it to anyone interested in Shrek in 3D.

And since buying his first ""Shrek"" movie several years ago I've learned that he watches it repeatedly so this year I purchased the whole set.

""I love it!"" He commented after a follow up phone call after Christmas. Also, while researching my selection for ""dear old dad"" I was orginally looking for only the Shrek movies that my dad did not have yet, but found it cheaper to purchase the complete set.

But ""Shrek Forever After"" worked better in theaters, when there were a few years between each, than in this package. All the 4th movie is would be a mash-up of good gags taken directly from Shreks 1-3, with the Gingerbread Man saying ""Didn't this happen before? I have a bad feeling about this..."" It worked in theaters because without having JUST WATCHED parts 1-3 hours, days, or even weeks before, it was a pseudo-surprise that crept up on your memory afterward; but like this you're just watching a best-of clip show you've just seen.",1301961600,,716,4.829268292682927

I liked the movies, they were fun, a little naughty, perhaps, but good family fun.  They follow Shrek as he misadventures through his romance with Princess Fiona to her transformation in the first movie, his visit the the Kingdom of Far, Far Away and the battle with the Fairy Godmother and Prince Charming, who is not so charming after all.  Puss in Boots was delightful in the third book, I think he really stole the show.  And the dastardly Rumpelstiltskin in the fourth and final movie was a deliciously villainous villain.

4267534,4,B0046A9RMC,"While Disney/Pixar has an impeccable track record, DreamWorks is a bit more ""hit or miss"" with their animated feature films.  Even still when Shrek first came on the scene back in 2001 it was pretty clear to everyone that the underdog had managed to beat Disney at their own game and perhaps more impressive still, they did it in the very domain (fairy tales) on which Disney had built its entire empire.

The formula was simple enough: take the classical themes and environments of a traditional fairy tale and blend them with pop-culture references, and enough layered wit to appeal even to adults.  The DreamWorks crew is nothing if not business savvy and quite aware of the popularity of the lovable green ogre they had created, went on to span 4 feature films across nine-years and a variety of shorts/ spin offs along the way.

In a surprising move, DreamWorks wasted absolutely no time in putting out a complete collection box set once the 4th (and final) film came out this past December.  In fact the final film (Forever After) and the box set (The Whole Story) were released on the same day.

As far as box sets go, The Whole Story comes pretty well packed with goodies and features that are sure dazzle long time fans of the franchise and neophytes alike.  Spanning 5 discs, the collection kicks things off on the right foot by including digitally remastered versions of both the original film and Shrek 2.  There are over four and a half hours of special features sprinkled throughout as well.  There's a commentary track for each of the films contained within... Actually that's not entirely true.  Shrek The Third is the only of the quartet to not include a commentary track but Shrek 2 makes up for this by including two full commentaries (one from the directors and another from the producers).

Each disc also includes a hodgepodge of other bonus bits including spotlights on individual characters, deleted scenes (which in this case are mostly just tests/ storyboard phase), Shrek Rattle & Roll music videos, secrets revealed of each film, previews for upcoming DreamWorks productions (namely Megamind), Shrek video game previews, and a look at the process involved in transferring Shrek from a film franchise into a musical.

Finally the fourth thin-pack contains a 5th disc containing Donkey's Christmas Shrektacular: Donkey's Caroling Christmas-tacular, Shrek's Yule Log, 12 Days of Christmas virtual Pop-up Book, Donkey's Decoration Scramble, Cookin' With Cookie, Merry Music Fest & Gingy's Games & Activities.  Phew!

All that's really missing from this all-inclusive Shrek collection are the holiday special, Shrek the Halls and the animated short Shrek 3-D.  Otherwise, this single release represents all a fan of the green dude could ask for.  Now let's talk about each of the films contained here.

2001's Shrek is the one that started it all and while '01 has proven itself to actually be the ""stone age"" of full length CGI films, many are surprised to discover production of this one actually began way back in October of 1996 (when Pixar's Toy Story was the only CG film on shelves at the time).

A whimsical blend of high adventure, light romance, and witty dialog, the film was extremely well received at the time of its release.

Our protagonist, an ogre named Shrek (voiced by Mike Myers, using a Scottish accent) comes across Donkey (voiced of Eddie Murphy). Unfortunately for Shrek, who is in the process of trying to ditch the energetic Donkey, the local landholder (Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow)), has decided to deport all of the fairy tale creatures in the kingdom to Shrek's quiet swamp.

This causes the irritated ogre to head for the city of Duloc, where Farquaad holds court. There, he makes a deal with the noble - in return for getting all of the uninvited guests out of his swamp, Shrek will perform a quest to rescue the Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) from the tower where she is held prisoner. The catch: one fire-breathing dragon who wants her right where she is.

Farquaad wants Fiona for his bride and Shrek wants to return to the peaceful life of ogre-esque solitude.

Truly the humor still holds up even today.  The visuals are crisp and tight and the digital remastering is impressive.  However, it's only after viewing the later entries that the limitations of computing power at the time become revealed.  Truly great strides have been made in the areas of textures, skin layering, particle effects, lighting, hair rendering and so on.  The end result is simply that the film looks a little bit like watching a video game cut scene.  However, the original still reeks of charm and character and would likely remain the franchise's strongest entrant except for a valiant effort put on by its sequel.

2004's Shrek 2 manages to do what all sequels aspire to but very few achieve: It actually captures everything that made the original so charming but improves upon the formula.  Shrek 2 retains much of the original's sassy attitude but actually manages to become a bit more kid-friendly in the process (without compromising any of that intelligent wit included to appeal to the adults).

This time around Shrek and Princess Fiona have tied the knot and receive word that the time to meet the in-laws has arrived: King Harold (John Cleese) and Queen Lillian (Julie Andrews). The rulers of ""Far, Far Away"" the king and queen wish to throw their daughter a party in honor of her wedding. The catch is they have no idea that Fiona didn't marry her prince charming as had been the plan and, as the spell had been written; took the form of the one she did fall in love with!

Disgusted by the couple, King Harold would obviously rather Fiona marry Prince Charming while the queen takes the usual motherly position that she only wants what is best for her daughter.

Thanks to a deal King Harold made with the Fairy Godmother (voiced by Jennifer Saunders) to get her son (Prince Charming) hitched to Fiona, it seems nearly everyone is against Shrek's happy marriage.

This one is, in my opinion, the strongest entry in the quartet thanks to some hilarious tension created by Shrek's inadequacy with his royal in-laws, the introduction of the character Puss in Boots, stellar pacing and the spot-on comedic timing made famous in the first.  It is often argued that the franchise should have ended here so as to go out on a high note, but there would be two more entries before all was said and done.

Generally considered the weakest film of the four, 2007's Shrek the Third is certainly the most watered down of the lot in the plot department.  This time Shrek and Fiona find themselves taking care of Far Far Away in the king's absence.  On his deathbed, the king reveals that there are really only two heirs to the throne: the new son-in-law (Shrek) or Arthur Pendragon (Justin Timberlake) of all people.  Naturally since Shrek is itching to get back to his muddy swamp something terrible, he sets off on a mission to snag young Arthur from Worcestershire.

The villain this time is pretty-boy Prince Charming, who simply refuses to surrender his would-be inheritance to a smelly green ogre.  Trouble is his plan of revenge is based on putting together a musical that demonstrates his awesomeness.  The plot's weak, it plods along, and it definitely gives up some of its razor sharp wit to surely appeal toward the younger (traditional fairy tale-going) set.

However all is not bad.  In accordance with the advancement of computing power, the visuals are pretty darn spectacular.  Especially noteworthy are the skin textures and lighting detail that seem to give the whole work an almost dream-like vibe.  Additionally there is some humor scattered about only unlike the previous Shrek films, this time most of it stems from visual gags over solid writing: School buses pulled by horses, Shrek's desperate attempt to reattach a ship's steering wheel just prior to running ashore, and Puss' need to escape all of the domestic cats that have fallen in love with him are among the gags that are sure to delight.

With a tighter plot and better scripting, this one could easily have been on par with the magic of the first one, but there is an inescapable feeling that the writers simply got tired of straining to think on this one and literally created a series of situations to simply showcase the nice visuals/ revisit the characters.  Yes it ends with the Shrek family expanding their brood but make no mistake, even that element can't save the meandering plot from bogging down upon itself.  On it's own, this would have been an entirely mediocre endeavor; when compared to the two prior entries and considering the depth of the vocal talent, this one is pretty sub par.

Finally the DreamWorks crew decided Shrek's final sendoff would go down in 2010 with Forever After (also known as the Final Chapter).  Many critics insist that the franchise is basically a downward slope from strongest to weakest but I'm of the opinion that the fourth and final entry was a slight improvement over the third film (but still below the precedent set by the first two).

This time the DreamWorks gang decided to pull a little ""It's a Wonderful Life"" treatment by presenting what could have been had Shrek never existed.  Now a celebrity and fully domesticated, Shrek finds himself tumbling ever closer to midlife crisis. A combination of fatherhood, lack of respect and virtually no privacy results in his conspiring with the creepy maniacal Rumpelstiltskin for a day of relaxation.  Unfortunately the contract Rumpel pens up trades a day of goofing around for one of Shrek's childhood and, in true villainy fashion, Rumpel snatches up the day Shrek was born.

What results is a world far unlike what Shrek fans are used to: Dark skies laced with patrolling witches, the drying out of Shrek's swamp, an ogre resistance force, a princess who gave up on being rescued and freed herself from the tower, an overweight, spoiled Puss in Boots and an obnoxious Donkey- okay so not EVERYTHING'S changed.

Shrek has until the day he wished for's conclusion to set things right lest fall into eternal oblivion and hence the quest is on.

Though easily considered the darkest of the bunch, the visuals, as are expected for a 2010 release, are quite spectacular.  Textures are at their highest level of detail and skin imperfections like freckles and moles shine in high definition glory.  However, good looks do not a good film make and Shrek Forever After is no exception.  While the plot improves over the ho-hum effort that was the third film, the comedy and sharp wit of the early entries are incontestably absent here.

In conclusion the fourth film may be the most high tech of the bunch, complete with the highest budget, 3D treatment, and silkiest visuals but becomes an entirely mundane romp without the heart and charm that made the series so popular in the first place.  Many of us will continue preferring to view Shrek as a fairly low-tech franchise (in a young industry) with enough heart and humor to overcome the limitations placed upon it rather than a high-tech visual showcase with little enduring properties.

In all, The Whole Story box set is a very worthy investment.  While it's a bit sad that the franchise will retire to the archives without ever fully having harnessed the magic that made the first two entries so strong, there is no denying entertainment value all throughout.  DreamWorks would go on to demonstrate a stronger capacity for scripting (Kung-Fu Panda) and solid story telling (How to Train Your Dragon) since Shrek first appeared on the scene a decade ago but there is little doubt that the lovable green ogre earned his spot in the computer animated film hierarchy.",1295395200,,11734,4.850125313283208

I've followed it from its surprise hit status to name brand status.  Watching these in Blu-Ray is like watching them again for the first time, taking me back to first seeing them in the theaters, long before they were cannon.  The picture is so clear and pristine it makes it worth double dipping.  There's a ton of special features, including those on the previous sets.  While there is not DVD copy or Digital Copy as found in most modern Blu-Ray sets, I'm not too disappointed as (1) I have the DVDs, and (2) now that I have the blu-ray I have no interest in watching the DVDs.  If I had one complaint its that the set doesn't contain either holiday special (Christmas and Halloween).  It doesn't kill the set, and frankly they aren't that great, just a little disappointed as this is called the ""whole story.""  Regardless, it's a great set, and looks wonderful.

4267549,5,B0046A9RMC,"Amazon lists this as ""Shrek:The Quadrilogy"",when it is technically NOT the case. The packaging itself clearly states this is ""The Whole Story"" not the""Quadrilogy"",with a beautifully embossed outer case on back and front. But wait,even ""The Whole Story"" is technically in error! Sure the four movies are here but included is ""Donkey's Christmas Shrektacular"" making that five discs;a Christmas sing a long with all the Shrek cast in attendance. Do not confuse this with ""Shrek the Halls"" which appeared first on TV a couple of years back(and would be here if it was ""the whole story"")but is NOT included. And let us not mention ""Shrek in 3-D"" which is NOT here,which pushes things even further beyond ""Quadrilogy"" or ""The Whole Story""! All this ""technicality"" aside,this is a set to celebrate and cherish,no doubt about it.
The first three movies have been REMASTERED and the picture of each is absolutely stunning and all are WIDESCREEN,in their original aspect ratios. The special features have been changed;some remain from the original releases while others have been dropped while others added.
Shrek's features include a spotlight on Donkey,Shrek secrets,deleted scenes,karaoke dance party,Shrek,rattle and roll and directors commentary. Shrek 2 contains a spotlight on Puss in Boots,secrets of Shrek 2,Shrek,rattle and roll,Far,Far Away Idol and commentary. Shrek the Third contains spotlight on Fiona,secrets of Shrek 3,deleted scenes,Shrek,rattle and roll and Worcestershire Academy Yerabook. Shrek Forever After contains a spotlight on Shrek(Mike Myers),secrets,deleted scenes, and commentary.
Let's briefly review each film's plot in case you have forgotten.
Shrek of course introduces us to the green ogre who ""likes his privacy"",in his swamp home. When the ruler Lord Farquod banishes all the fairy tale creatures to his swamp,an upset Shrek and sidekick Donkey are forced to endure a quest to save Princess Fiona from a castle guarded by a dragon. While returning the princess to the anxiously awaiting Farquod both Shrek and the princess fall in love. It turns out the princess also has a secret;a princess by day and an ogre by night. In the end it is Shrek and Fiona who ultimately tie the knot,riding away in a large garlic carriage.(Released May/01)
Shrek Two sees Shrek meeting the in laws,the King and Queen of Far,Far away;and it doesn't go so well for either. It seems the Fairy Godmothers' son,Prince Charming was supposed to have rescued the princess from the castle(not Shrek)and become the new King. The Fairy Godmother pressures the King to get rid of Shrek and he enlists the services of Puss in Boots. After a brief scuffle Puss becomes Shreks friend,much to Donkey's initial chagrin. Posing as Union members they get into Fairy Godmothers potion factory coming away with a potion making Shrek a handsome human and Donkey a beautiful white stallion. He rushes to Fiona only to find that Prince Charming has supplanted him and resigns himself to bachelorhood. But when he and Donkey overhear it's all been a set up he rushes to Fiona's side in Shrek-tacular fashion and saves his bride from a miserable life with Charming.(Released May/04).
Shrek the Third sees the King on his deathbed(in reality a frog)and he assigns Shrek as his reluctant heir. The only other one in line for the throne is a young lad named Arthur. Shrek immediately seeks out Arthur and also learns that Fiona is pregnant. In the meantime Prince Charming has been left on his own due to his mothers demise in Shrek 2,eking out a living doing supper clubs. He enlists the help of all the fairy tale creatures ever done wrong by others. They attack and take over Far,Far Away. Prince Charming carefully plans a large stage play in which he will actually slay Shrek in front of the entire population. Shrek gets captured and on stage starts to ruin Charming's theatrics with quick jokes aimed at Charming. Arthur makes a heartfelt speech which turns the tide and while Arthur begins his reign as King,Fiona and Shrek retire to the swamp with ogre triplets!(Released May/07)
Finally Shrek Forever After is basically Shrek meets It's a Wonderful Life. It sees Shrek fully into some doldrums with every day getting more and more boring. At a birthday party for his children he blows his stack and walks out. He runs into Rumpelstiltskin and makes a ""deal with the devil"",so to speak. In exchange for a day of Shrek's life,Shrek gets a day of life as it used to be;a bachelor ogre terrorizing the countryside. However the day Rumpel has taken is Shrek's day of birth,so Shrek was never born. He has until sun down to seek out his true loves kiss which will break the spell. But Fiona is now the leader of an ogre resistance movement to take back Far,Far Away from Rumple's oppressive regime. As the day ends and as Shrek disappears,Fiona kisses Shrek and the spell is broken. Shrek returns to the birthday party full of love for his family and friends;a new ogre.(Released May/10)
The four movies see a wonderful growing character development in Shrek,his family and friends. The final movie comes full circle with everyone living happily ever after,as it should be. The writers produced some very smart scripts,the humour is timeless and the in-jokes run a mile a minute. Everyone of all ages can get the humour here which is,for the most part,clean and quite innocent stuff. These are fantastic movies;the first two are about on a par,the third dips a bit but the last brings it all back in grand style.

Rating: 4/5

Shrek's Blu-ray debut seems limited only by the boundaries of the original source material. DreamWorks' Blu-ray release of Shrek sees the green ogre spring to vivid life courtesy of a nicely detailed and exceptionally colored 1080p, 1.78:1-framed transfer. While fine details are strong -- particularly around the foreground and in character construction -- the film's vivid palette is the real winner in the upgrade to high definition. From the opening scene that features the brightly-colored pictures inside a book and through the entirety of the picture, Shrek's color palette shines brightly and with a vibrant yet steady appearance that allows reds, blues, and greens to practically leap off the screen. Detail is almost a match, though the rather limited CGI artistry of the time period in which the film was made in turn limits what DreamWorks' transfer can show. On the downside, banding is evident in a few spots while shimmering is visible throughout and to the point of bordering on distraction. Otherwise, Shrek looks very good on Blu-ray, sporting a crisp, perceptibly deep, and satisfying image that should please longtime fans itching to upgrade from that well-loved DVD edition.

DreamWorks unleashes Shrek onto Blu-ray with a positively stunning Dolby TrueHD 7.1 lossless soundtrack. Those two additional channels bring greater dimension and clarity to the proceedings, effectively creating an immersive and wonderfully satisfying 360-degree sound field that's the ultimate compliment to the film. The various popular music tunes sound fantastic -- from Smash Mouth's ""All Star"" to Donkey's version of ""I'm a Believer"" -- and play with a power, clarity, and spacing reserved for the best of the best lossless presentations. Indeed, music spreads across the front with a fair back channel support element and a kicking but tight and perfectly-realized low end; these tunes have never sounded better. The 7.1 configuration also aids in recreating the various environmental nuances heard throughout the movie; whether nighttime buzzing insects or chirping birds during the day, listeners will often feel immersed into the world of Shrek thanks to a nuanced but highly effective support structure. Even better, more potent effects sound fantastic, and the bigger of them seem to widen the soundstage to practically hurtle the audience into the perils and pitfalls of the journey. Supported by seamless and center-focused dialogue reproduction, Shrek has never sounded better at home.

It takes but a glance to see the improvements in the animation between Shrek and Shrek 2. DreamWorks' 1080p transfer of Shrek 2 delivers a gorgeous high definition presentation that allows all of the digital nuances to be fully realized in every frame. Detail is amazing throughout, with the transfer revealing every stubble of facial hair on Shrek's face, the finest texturing of his clothes, and the massive amounts of intricate eye candy that abounds in all of the film's locales, whether the serene woodland areas or the far more complex structures of the Kingdom of Far, Far Away. Colors excel, too; whether Shrek and Fiona's ogre-green skin -- the color that's come to define the franchise -- or the bright purple splashes of magic contrails that follow the Fairy Godmother's flying cart, the transfer never lacks a breathtakingly gorgeous rainbow of hues. Great amounts of perceptible depth -- even in 2D -- are another hallmark of this transfer, but DreamWorks' image does suffer through some minor shimmering and a few jagged edges, though not to the extent that they're seen in Shrek. All told and aside from those two slight bugaboos, Shrek 2 excels on Blu-ray.

Copying and pasting the Shrek audio review would suffice here. DreamWorks' Dolby TrueHD 7.1 lossless soundtrack delivers a full and wonderfully immersive sonic experience that effortlessly transports listeners to the Kingdom of Far, Far Away. There's no wait time, no ""are we there yet?"" nagging; this track offers instant sonic gratification and never relents until the movie ends and the disc returns to the main menu screen. Once again, both popular music and sound effects alike spring to life through a rich and full-bodied presentation that works all seven speakers extensively, while the subwoofer chimes in to offer some tight and potent supportive elements that nicely round out the track and give it the heft it needs to stand out from tinier and less well-defined lossless soundtracks. Whether the slightest atmospheric elements or the most potent action sound effects, Shrek 2 delivers a continuous stream of sonic goodness by recreating every effect big, small, and in between with equal amounts of precision and ease. All of it is built around center-focused dialogue reproduction that plays with nary an audible hiccup from beginning to end. This is one soundtrack that will definitely leave listeners Happily Ever After!

Shrek the Third
Rating: 4.5/5

They just keep getting better and better. DreamWorks' Blu-ray release of Shrek the Third sparkles in high definition, with most of the (albeit minor) problems evident in the first two releases virtually non-factors here; only minor banding evident in the storm clouds seen during the film's open prove cause for concern. This 1080p, 1.78:1-framed gem of a transfer allows viewers to appreciate the precision work of DreamWorks' digital artists to an extent not even possible in theaters; pause almost any scene and marvel at the extraordinary attention to detail in every object. Even Shrek's old standby clothes that have seen him through three movies -- that dirty white undershirt and the brown vest -- offer up even greater detailing in Shrek the Third, with even the smallest of frays, speckles of dirt, and nuanced textures coming to life on Blu-ray. Colors are expectedly vibrant and remain steady even in low-light conditions, notably in an early scene in chapter three as several characters hover over the dying king. Once again, depth is fantastic, with several overhead shots of the Kingdom looking almost as good as a few of the lesser 3D transfers. The entire thing is a stunning achievement in digital animation and home video; that nuisance banding proves just heavy enough to knock the score down half a point, but rest assured that this is basically perfect picture quality the rest of the way.

Yes indeed, Shrek the Third sounds great on Blu-ray. DreamWorks' Dolby TrueHD 7.1 lossless soundtrack dazzles with another wholly immersive experience that's so well balanced that everything from the subtlest of environmental nuances to the most dazzling of the biggest sound effects all pull the audience into the excitement of Shrek the Third with an effortlessness that must be heard to be believed. No, this isn't the most dynamic track out there; bass isn't quite as aggressive and music isn't quite as natural as what's found on the cream of the crop lossless soundtracks, but this one resides just a notch below. It's the same old story, really. The track's prowess extends to both ends of the spectrum and covers everything in between with equal amounts of precision and fun. Listeners will feel like a part of the unruly crowd during a raucous barroom brawl in chapter four or as one of the audience members bemoaning another subpar stage performance from the disgraced Prince Charming at film's open. Atmospherics -- notably the dripping rain and booming thunder heard during the King's funeral in chapter three -- proves extraordinarily satisfying and real, while the subtlety of gently rolling waters brushing up against the hull of a wooden vessel in chapter eight will make the audience feel like they're on the ship's deck. Bass is seamlessly integrated into the track, too, as evidenced by a stampeding herd of imaginary baby ogres in chapter five. Music once again enjoys excellent spacing and clarity across the front, while dialogue never misses a beat as it flows from the center speaker. It's just another day at the office with this one. The only question that remains is: can Shrek Forever After top its predecessors in the audio department?

Shrek Forever After
Rating: 5/5

Shrek Forever After switches things up a bit, ditching the 1.78:1 aspect ratio for the 2.35:1 widescreen format. The results are, in a word, breathtaking. For as wonderful as the other films look, Forever After simply blows them away in every area, thanks to the jaw-dropping quality of the animation that's arguably the best of any purely digital film to date. Detail is so striking that it sometimes distracts from the movie; viewers will be awed by the infinite clarity, precision sharpness, faultless detailing, and immaculate color palette that all accompany every frame. Whether the regal purple and gold accents on the King and Queen's carriage as seen at the beginning of the film, Shrek's trademark green skin, or Fiona's captivating blue eyes, this transfer is awash in a splendid array of colors that put most every other Blu-ray disc to shame. Likewise, details are so good that one can only wonder how long it took to make a movie this exacting while staring at the 1080p screen in bewilderment that anything can look this good. The transfer is free of any unwanted blemishes, and that pretty much wraps this one up. The transfer speaks for itself, and Shrek Forever After commands strong consideration as the year's -- and, so far, Blu-ray's -- absolute best picture quality.

This sonically flawless Dolby TrueHD 7.1 lossless soundtrack is the perfect companion to Shrek Forever After's impeccable 1080p video transfer. DreamWorks' lossless presentation easily surpasses the soundtracks of the three other films in this collection, and while it shares in common most of the same attributes, it amplifies them all and perfects each one, allowing this track to reach something of a zenith that places it amongst the finest soundtracks available on Blu-ray. Spacing is perfect, clarity amazing, and the entire thing is virtually transparent as the speakers seem to disappear in favor of a wide, real, and organic presentation that simply must be heard to be believed. Listen as the Royal buggy slams its way through the soundstage in one early scene or be transported into a mobile holding cell with Shrek in another as it bounces around on rough terrain, allowing listeners to almost feel the bumps in the road with every pebble and recess. Listen for the track to increase in potency in conjunction with Shrek's level of irritation at the birthday party, culminating in him ""doing the roar"" and sending a shockwave of blissful bass through the listening area that's as tight, precise, and potentially window-shattering as anything out there, at least until the sensation is repeated and, it seems, kicked up a level or two later in the film. DreamWorks' soundtrack expectedly handles all of the lesser environmental nuances with ease, and music, too, is delivered with a clarity and realism fit for only the finest of soundtracks, whether speaking of the cheerfully laid back performance of ""Top of the World"" or the bass-heavy dance beats heard during one of Rumpelstiltskin's parties. Dialogue, of course, plays faultlessly, rounding out a superior soundtrack where even the most praising of adjectives can't really get to how good it really is.",1291852800,5,11357,5.153470715835141
