8393494,5,B003B4V57E,"This documentary should be required viewing for every junior high/college sociology and history class. I saw this on television when it was first broadcast back in 1991, on Dec 7th, as I recall.  Oh.  My.  Goodness.  It was absolutely riveting.  When I saw it again a couple weeks ago, all I could think at the end was that it was over much too quickly.  This should really have been a two or three hour documentary.  There are so many untold stories of incredible heroism out there.  There was one interview in particular when I first viewed it back in 1991 that just made the tears course down my cheeks.  There was another interview that, seeing it again a couple weeks ago, almost made my heart pound right out of my chest.",1290816000,,727,4.488549618320611
