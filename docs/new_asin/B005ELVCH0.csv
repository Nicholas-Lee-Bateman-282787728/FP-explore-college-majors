4665923,4,B005ELVCH0,"I liked One special night...this is a great great movie...James Garner and Julie Andrews are a hoot but it is also a beautiful, beautiful story!  It had a nice surprise ending...I will enjoy this movie for years to come!

the movie Christmas clause was very predictable...wouldn't buy again or probably won't watch again...

Christmas Clouds was a cute movie...funny and just had some nice warm fuzzies in it!",1354838400,15,409,4.985294117647059
4665924,3,B005ELVCH0,"One Special Night is one of my favorite holiday movies ever.  I am putty in the hands of Julie Andrews and James Garner.  If you are interested in seeing this movie, I strongly suggest you purchase it on its own.  If you want to know more about it, there are ample 5-star reviews on Amazon.

The other two movies - not so much.  I got maybe 10 minutes into Christmas Clause and turned it off.  A movie with vomiting in it just does not feel very festive, and by that point I was not nearly engaged enough to care what happened to Lea Thompson's character, much as I like that actress.

I lasted a little longer with Christmas in the Clouds, but only because I was appalled by how awful it was.  Loaded with racial and ethnic stereotypes, mistakenly billed as a ""riotous comedy,"" I was truly embarrassed for the poor actors who thought it was a good idea to appear in this misbegotten holiday-themed venture.

I would give One Special Night 5 stars - even more if I could - but it is cheapened by combination with the other two movies.  This set is an example of the very best and very worst holiday fare produced for TV.",1353888000,6,1120,4.315789473684211
4665925,4,B005ELVCH0,"All three of these movies were fun to watch, but ""One Special Night"" was really great, but how could it not be with James Garner and Julie Andrews!?!",1346284800,16,149,4.357142857142857
