5276789,4,B00979KQGI,"If you like suds grab a six pack and stick this one into your DVD player. It'll be an evening well spent.

It would be even better if the scene where Kovacs flys his plane through the hangar twice - first right side up and then upside down - had not been cut from the original film. Next to the ""hit me"" line it was my favorite sequence in the original film. Only saw it once - 52 years ago when it made its first round of the movie theaters. Have always wanted a copy for my film and TV library.

Glad it came out. Donnacha from Donoughmore",1351555200,3,541,4.0

5276798,2,B00979KQGI,"I wanted to see this again after I saw it one time on the Late, Late show as a kid....
Well I grew up and this slow pacing really disappointed me. I thought I was going to see the brilliant Ernie Kovacs, but his role was not well written. Don Knotts is funny, engaged in role as a RA-RA morale officer, but it does not make up for a disjointed movie and Dick Shawn is just there, not really engaged as an actor, just resigned to the inevitable punishment it is his lot to get. Like he was disappointed in getting this role. And I got punished watching it. As for Dick Shawn, he is a riot in Love at First Bite!",1403654400,,610,4.008196721311475
5276799,5,B00979KQGI,ordered it for a chirstmas gift becasue he likes Ernie Kovac and his movies from way back. I like that you keep old movies for people to find and buy.,1400284800,,150,4.033333333333333
5276800,5,B00979KQGI,this film was released in 35 mm  aspect ratio 2:35 widescreen.  the dvd is 1:77 format.  that means that the studio was too lazy to give you the movie they released in the first place.  what a shame that movies can't be released as they were in theaters.  if you want to see a movie with a lot of the visual missing....then this is for you.,1396742400,,340,4.090909090909091
5276801,3,B00979KQGI,"Loved Ernie Kovacs, he is so much fun in film! Started kind of slow but ends very well. I will watch it again and recommend it to any Kovacs fan. If you're not a fan, you will be.",1393200000,,179,3.736842105263158
5276802,5,B00979KQGI,"After spending a year stationed in Europe at a base we lovingly called Alcatraz with a runway, I came back and saw this movie by pure accident.  Best accident I ever had and saw.  Spent the entire movie in tears cause I was laughing so hard.  Of course I didn't see this movie till 1981, I still knew how he felt being no where with nothing to do, but be bored! Wished I had thought of half the stuff he did!  Best movie I had seen in years.  Buy and cry from the belly laughs.  Just added it to my collection.",1386028800,2,510,4.0
5276803,4,B00979KQGI,"Mustered out in 1946, an ex-tail gunner and POW who owns a Jersey city tavern and country hotel applies for GI insurance at the last possible moment in 1953, and gets caught up in the Air Force Reserves.  He is put through radar school and winds up on the fictional Japanese island of Shima after the Korean war, with a decrepit base and a dirt airstrip, and a radar dish located up the mountain.

He finds that his former B-17 captain is the C.O. of the remote outpost, and that most of their time is spent finding creative ways to keep from dying of boredom. The local population largely ignores them and honors the memory of a crash landed wartime Japanese aviator.

Airman Brubaker comes up with the morale building and money making idea of building a hotel at the local hot springs to serve the military en route, and attract the men and women stationed in post war Japan on leave.  The base men can do private work in their after duty hours, and the stockpiled materiel from the Korean conflict can be put to constructive use.

After they scam a doctor/journalist at a medical conference in Tokyo to convince him that the springs have health benefits, he becomes disgruntled and writes an expose that gets the attention of the public and Washington that gets them in real hot water.  A droll comedy about military bureaucracy, foreign relations and economic aid in the Cold War.

There is a short sequence of the C.O. buzzing the base and landing his P-51 on one wheel.  There are a couple of short shots of a C-47 delivering supplies, and the government investigating committee.  The Japanese shrine appears to be built over the carcass of a PT-17 or other fixed wheel trainer.",1385683200,,1684,4.605351170568562
5276804,5,B00979KQGI,Refreshing.  Reminds me of the old ways  in the military.  Funny to see how they use to get things done with no funds.,1383523200,,118,4.043478260869565
5276805,4,B00979KQGI,"I had not seen this movie in ages and I was not disappointed.

I first saw this film as a teenager, before I joined the military, and thought it was funny. Having seen it after years in the Army I found it HILARIOUS. The thing is, former Airman Brubaker KNOWS that applying for G.I. insurance is a mistake... he got out of the Army Air Force after spending almost his entire time in a German POW camp. Yet his wife wants him to apply and like a schnook he does. Then, naturally, due to an error that came up when he was discharged the Air Force drafts him and quickly processes him through radar training and sends him to one of the many backwaters that the U.S. military ran during the Cold War.

If you've never seen this film you owe it to yourself to see this!",1379030400,6,764,4.190476190476191
5276806,4,B00979KQGI,"Ernie Kovacs adapted to the television medium with a style unique to other comedians. Remember the Alka seltzer commercial where the guy is having a bad day and the water pours sideways into the glass ? Ernie Kovacs did this on early television by building a tilted set and having everything look upright by tilting the camera. Dick Shawn is the perfect schmuck in this film although his best is in the original Producers with Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder. A girl is pulling petals from a flower and saying "" er lieb mir, er lieb mir nichts, er lieb mir, er lieb mir nichts, Du lieb Mir Nichts !"" Dick Shawn as Hitler says , ""I lieb ya, I lieb ya baby, now lieb me alone"". This film has that same screwball approach to comedy. Enjoy !",1378512000,4,733,4.318840579710145

5276808,5,B00979KQGI,Just another one of those great early 60's cornball movies.  Very enjoyable to watch and laugh at.  I remember seeing this movie when I was a teenager and loved it then.  I still love it.,1374710400,3,187,4.285714285714286
5276809,5,B00979KQGI,This is a classic film Ernie Kovacs make this a gem the movie has a very thin plot and really makes a point  that anything the u s government does it does  it does wrong thing never change in Washington..,1373328000,,204,4.075

8537363,5,B00979KQGI,"The film parallels the book with a few risqu exceptions. What is unique is that even though major actors were picked for the movie they could not be closer to the character description from the 1959 book of the same name by Howard Singer.

Russ is a schnook. Therefore if something can go wrong it will. His wife is into insurance of all kinds. She wants him to get his GI insurance while he can. After she forces him to apply (schnook), he must explain that he has two serial numbers (schnook). When he was shot down over Germany he was presumed dead and needed a second number to get discharged (schnook). So naturally realizing that the (schnook) being in the service only one-day on the second serial number, is called up to finish his time.

He ends up on an island in the middle of the Sea of Japan. There he has a revelation that saves his sanity and that of 400 other servicemen. A plan so brilliant that I am not about to tell you what it is or how it is executed.

In the book the plan cured his shnookyness; in the movie it takes a trial. The cast includes Dick Shawn as the schnook and Ernie Kovacs as his commander and hotshot fighter pilot.

I can relate to this as I also have two serial numbers.",1508630400,22,1211,4.252173913043478

8537367,1,B00979KQGI,"Its graphic example of recycling warfare waste is probably the only saving grace of this bad and moronic American service comedy, which should be called instead ""Testosterone Nightmare"". Under the command of a beer-drinking, cigar-smoking and sexist captain (Ernie Kovacs) who throws empty cans into the air and wants a submissive and dependent woman, the plot concerns macho US Air Force men wasting the moneys of tax-payers, while they do nothing in a hard to find base in a remote Japanese little island called Shima, where local persons despise them. In comes a private (Dick Shawn) who happens to have two serial numbers (a fact that turns out to be the author's key artifice in the idiotic resolution) and who out of boredom proposes to everybody in the base to build a hotel in the island just to do something. They use all the wood, iron, tin or plastic of weaponry that American armed forces left around Japan, incorporate the community hiring local fishermen, maids and workers, and they successfully open the place recurring to false advertising (the promise of curative water in the premises, that also increases male potency). A scientific writer (Robert Emhardt in an embarrassing role) discovers the fraud and of course there is a shallow-brained trial that ends concealing corruption in all levels, or perhaps giving voice to a collective guilty conscience for all the cultural, physical and psychological health damage the United States brought to Japan and its people to end World War II in Asia with ""nuclear wizardry"", and thereafter. To top the whole mess, beautiful Nobu McCarthy is wasted, used as decor, playing the educated daughter of the mayor of Shima who is unable to explain anything to inane officials who think she is a slave of Shawn, who the maids call papa-san. One may say, ""Hey, it's a comedy"". Yes, but what an uninspired comedy. No wonder I had completely forgotten it, since I saw it when I was a kid.",1486425600,,1941,4.90273556231003
