3594849,4,B001G1FL4W,"I have been a big fan of Ian Mcshane and Lovejoy and had taped most of the A&E episodes on vhs.
Now since the dvd prices are going down I've replaced my vhs and i missed a few episodes.
This season is good even great but not as great as the first 3 but has some classic Lovejoy
episodes. I don't think you can be a Lovejoy fan without buying all the seasons anyway and
you won't be sorry getting season 4 either. I would just buy the entire season!",1392768000,,448,3.988888888888889
3594850,5,B001G1FL4W,"I discovered ""Lovejoy"" several years ago, and I am enjoying each season more and more.

3594853,5,B001G1FL4W,"I discovered Lovejoy back in the 90's when my cable
  was fuzzy and Lovejoy was on A& E and it gave me something to look
  forward too. By sheer chance I caught not only my favorite of all
  of them as my first show but it was a perfect way to see the rest.
  I have bought all 6 seasons and liked all of them a few more then
  others. As luck would have I sent a few to my younger brother
  and he couldn't wait to see more. Fortunately His library (New york)
  had all the season although it was good luck to get one.

  This is one of the few shows I truly enjoy and still smile laugh
  and once in awhile think this is brilliant. It's does what the
  best shows should do. Entertains and and makes you smile and
  think all at the same time. I'm so glad I bought the seasons
  as my cable system hasn't showed them in years. I sometimes
  hear complaints about the quality of the Dvd transfers but
  considering my old cable was worse and Vhs recording's even
  worse ( yeah like really fuzzy)I was very glad to get the Dvd's.
  Add in a few missed shows and the Dvd's look even better.

  Few things make me feel as good as finding a great show I
  truly enjoy and the only way it gets better is being able
  to own all the seasons and the Christmas specials.

  Finally the episode I first saw was They call me Midas
  and was near perfect. Even after many viewing I still
  laugh and smile at how perfect it was.

  Take the time to watch Lovejoy and you might be
 surprised like I was to find a very good Tv show.

3594854,5,B001G1FL4W,"I almost own the entire collection. Just season one,  which the local library has not replaced. (So, just purchase it here.)It is worn out so much, it will be unplayable shortly?  I cannot say enough about this show. I just love it. It is a pleasure to laugh, view the beautiful landscape and capture a learning experience all rolled into one tv show!",1295222400,,351,4.555555555555555
3594855,5,B001G1FL4W,"Always love Lovejoy,no matter what. I can see changes coming,but the stories always make my day. Recommend it for anyone who likes Ian or Lovejoy",1271203200,,145,4.84
3594856,1,B001G1FL4W,"i loved seasons 1-3 but the 4th is awful. don't know what changed to cause it, but now they are the 3 stooges, and jane is a little nasty/snippy diva while awesome good old lovejoy is suddenly kind of a sleazy lying thief, not a rascal with a gleam in his eye, but more like just a crook.

for comedy, you should expect to see eric fall in the grass repeatedly and come up with it in his hair and tinker slip and fall in the mud and cry about it.

i see bbc now co-listed on the dvd credits beginning this season, so maybe they became more involved to its huge detriment. no idea what changed but this little gem is now suddenly in the 4th season utterly unwatchable for me.",1269302400,,674,4.098484848484849

3594860,5,B001G1FL4W,"Seeing these Lovejoy episodes is like visiting old friends. I have waited a very long time for all of the episodes to be available on DVD. Perhaps the quality and sound isn't the best, but watching the stories compensates for it. The writing and acting are superb!  Well worth the wait.",1236902400,,286,4.607843137254902
3594861,4,B001G1FL4W,"We've now seen all four of the Lovejoy series.  It's been a lot of fun.  The scenery is beautiful, the acting is first class, and the stories have, by and large, been believable.  (However, I'll never get used to an actor talking directly into the camera with asides.  I think it harms all film drama.)  The twist in series four is that Lovejoy ceases to be a crooked antique dealer part of the time and now is a full time crook.  The antics are consequently less amusing. This is not about Robin Hood, and the approach lowers the already sagging moral tone of the films. Two more in the series are on the way, and one hopes that the writers can enhance Lovejoy's character a bit.  There was a hint of this possibility in the final program of series 4.",1234224000,,752,4.328571428571428
3594862,5,B001G1FL4W,"Lovejoy is a cultural phenomenon in the UK.  Quite often when you watch British antiques shows charming antiques buff is called a Lovejoy after the title character of this show.

The premise of this series was simple, Lovejoy (Ian McShane) is a professional antiques dealer with a shady past.  Tinker Dill (Dudley Sutton) is his old antiques buddy and Eric Catchpole (Chris Jury) is his young apprentice.  Lovejoy's love intrest is Lady Jane Felsham (Phyliss Logan) but it is a platonic relationship as she is married.

The fourth season contains the following 13 episodes:

The Napoleonic Comode - Lovejoy is kicked out of his cottage by his landlord (Alexi Sayles) and he goes on the road to get a stake.  On the way he finds a comode that was to have belonged to the great Emperor Napoleon.  Now all he has to do is find Monsieur Brogni, the Napoleon antique expert to certify it.

The Ring - The title does not refer to a piece a jewelry but a group of dealers that work together to increase the price of an item at an auction.  Lovejoy gets an unwitting Lady Jane plus three old friends to up the price of a painting he has up for auction.  But any fan of Lovejoy would tell you, things hardly goes as planned.

Second Fiddle - Lovejoy antiques is hired to turn a real Statavarious violin into a fake but why?

The Colour of Money - Lovejoy's arch nemisis, Charlie Gimbert reserfaces and askes Lovejoy to find a pool table that once belonged to Mary, Queen of Scots.

Fly the Flag - An American flag from the Revolutionary War period is found in a local parish church.  But who actually owns it?

Judgement of Solomon - A retired Air Force officer asks Lovejoy to sell a collection of antique jewelry.  But the provenences are questionable.

The Galloping Major - Lovejoy acquires an antique cannon.  But when Lovejoy is at the Tower of London to get information about it, Eric is almost conned out of the cannon.

God Helps Those - Lovejoy's table is smashed in an antiques store, Jane berfriends a young man helping a local hospital and Charlie Gimbert is asked to find a special clock.

They Call Me Midas - Lovejoy gets suckered into a scam by his antiques mentor.

Irish Stew - The gang go to Ireland in search of new stock and a special painting for Jane.

Dainty Dish - The group go to Brighton to buy a set of china but as usual it gets complicated.

Taking the Pledge - Lovejoy helps a friend raise money to recover a painting from a pawnbroker.

Lovejoy Loses it - Lovejoy puts his divvying talents on display for a TV program.  But later he passes over a find at a house clearance and he wonders if he is losing his powers because he abused it.

This is a show that is a delight to watch.  A perfect cast in a near perfect series.",1231977600,,2746,4.416334661354582
3594863,4,B001G1FL4W,"This is a wonderful series.  The only problem with this is that ""The Prague Sun"" episode is missing from this and the third season.  This episode was a full length feature between the third and fourth season.",1231804800,,208,4.594594594594595
3594864,4,B001G1FL4W,"Please don't mistake this as a criticism of the program it is only an opinion on the lack of quality product one gets for ones hard earned quid.
I and the family have loved this program since it was first broadcast on the BBC back in the early 1990's. The cast of characters and the scenic beauty of East Anglia are terrific. The TV production is almost as good as the books. This is possibly the best season of the series. The rough edges are polished and the interaction of the actors is superb and the writing is at its peak.
The only reason I cannot rate this 5 stars is due to the lack of re-mastering. For $51.99 plus S+H, one would think this wonderful program would have been restored. Instead it's like watching BBC Gold re-runs on the telle on a stormy East Anglia night. Scratchy picture, hissing sound track, and faded colour. Come on, with today's technology there is no reason for this program to be presented in Dolby Digital 2.0 mono and a faded image cut to fit the TV screen. For $52.00 I should get something fully restored to its original glory presented in Dolby Digital 5.0 at a minimum.
I will buy this regardless of its lack of quality and cherish the entertainment value as I eagerly await the release of season 5.",1231372800,,1239,4.414847161572053
8303612,5,B001G1FL4W,"This is the 4th of 6 seasons of this great comedic mystery series.
Following Lovejoy, Lady Jane, Tinker and Eric this season is a joy. ""The Ring"" is a great episode, full of angst and mistakes. ""The Galloping Major"" has wonderful WWII stories and ""Irish Stew"" has a lovely lost treasure tale. You'll even learn trivia such as how Mary Queen of Scots' billiard table would be different from the ones we use today. And, last but not least, watch ""Lovejoy Loses It"" for the tale of how Lovejoy gest his mojo back.

...1... ""The Napoleonic Commode"" It is a beautiful day, rudely interrupted by a bailiff on behalf of Inland Revenue (England's IRS). They repossessing property for the landlord's non-payment of the mortgage. Not only is Lovejoy out of a house and a home, but his lack of paperwork means he can't prove which antiques are his and not re-possessable. There's only one thing to do. Make a lot of money fast.
...2... ""The Ring"" Tinker and Jane are worried about Lovejoy, who's gone into a right funk after the blows of episode 1. Lovejoy comes up with a way to recoup some of his losses. Unfortunately, it's not quite legal.
...3... ""Second Fiddle"" Lindsay Parry-Dovies, world-renowned violinist, has an odd request for Lovejoy. Find a restorer to make his genuine Stradivarius look fake.
...4... ""The Colour of Mary"" Lovejoy gets an impossible commission  find the billiard table once owned by Mary Queen of Scots.
...5... ""Fly the Flag"" Beau and Rachel Whittaker are bringing the abandoned church and village of Great Buckling to life again. More funds are needed, and dollar signs are seen when a flag dating from the American Revolutionary War is found. But is it theirs to sell?
...6... ""Judgement of Solomon""  Poor Eric is framed and ends up in the county jail. Lovejoy needs to clear Eric's name while dealing with an iffy hoard of pre-WWII silver.
...7... ""The Galloping Major"" Lovejoy comes out of an auction to find his taillight has been smushed. We saw what happened, an elderly couple who had this conversation as they left the scene in a hurry:
Wife, driving: ""Why didn't you shout 'stop', you geriatric bonehead?""
Husband: ""I did but you're as deaf as a pickled herring.""
Wife: ""You couldn't direct rain to the ground.""
...8... ""God Helps Them"" Dalefield Hospital is having an auction of donated dolls to raise funds for an incubator. Jane donates a turn-of-the-century Ernst Heubach doll. She must have a lot of antiques at Felsham Hall. At least that's what a gang of antique thieves assume.
...9... ""They Call Me Midas"" Lovejoy says that Jim Leonard ""taught me all I know... about antiques and, like, other stuff  you know, how to spot a fake, how to make one."" So when Leonard asks a favor, Lovejoy is in. Even if it's risky business.
..10.. ""Irish Stew"" Lovejoy and Jane go to Ireland on business. There Lovejoy meets Bernard Monserrat for the 2nd time:  ""Bertram Montague Monserrat. The best-dressed con in Europe when I was a young lad coming into the game."" And Lovejoy paid for the experience. Is Monserrat up to his old tricks?
..11.. ""Dainty Dish"" Lovejoy Associates are in Brighton. Beaches, piers, sunshine. And work. They are there to help a Belgian baroness down on her luck.
..12.. ""Taking the Pledge"" Gimbert is selling an astrolabe made in 1583. For a minute, it looks like he and Lovejoy will be allies. Not. In the meanwhile, Jane has fallen for Iain, the owner of her latest redecorating job. Only, funny thing, he hasn't reimbursed her for any of her purchases yet.
..13.. ""Lovejoy Loses It"" Lovejoy looks on top of the world with a successful demonstration of his divvy abilities on the TV show ""Eastward Ho"". But then it goes wrong. He starts  drinking more, he's nasty to his friends, he loses his touch. But he'll come roaring back.

The 13 episodes of Season 4 originally aired from January to April, 1993. Note, this DVD set does NOT include the December 1992 Christmas episode, ""The Prague Sun"". The 13 episodes total about 660 minutes and are presented in 4:3 aspect ratio. Subtitles are available on the episodes and the one Bonus Feature:
... Bonus... ""Ian McShane Talks About Lovejoy: Part 4"" ( 8 minutes) A 2004 interview with McShane, who plays Lovejoy, is divided into six parts. One part appears on each of the six Season sets.
McShane: ""We filmed in so many unbelievable houses. I mean incredible.""

Really a great season of ""Lovejoy"". The characters have been together long enough they really work off each other well.
