1057794,5,6305674116,I rented this movie Tuesday and watched it Tuesday and Wednesday.  It is a good English movie in the sense of having a dry sense of humor.  (No heavy Cockney accent to distract.)  If you like a more tongue in cheek sort of  humor I think you will enjoy this one.,948326400,3,262,4.078431372549019
1057795,4,6305674116,"If you're as tired as I am with the Action/Special effects explosion in Hollywood, An Ideal Husband will prove to boost your low opinion of the film industry.  Beautifully cast, written, and directed, it's no wonder why  it's been nominated for two Golden Globe Awards.  The first of course,  going to the actor, Rupert Everett.  He delivers his lines with such an  aire and grace of an English gentleman and takes such care to wrap each  word in a delightful sarcastic tone-- which fits his character perfectly.  Although he is, in some ways, considered a nasty man of arrogance,  Everett's charm shines through and draws the viewer into his oh so romantic  embrace.  The rest of the cast is equally entertaining--mostly because  they mesh so well together. The period costumes and cinematography are also  important to note.  The movement from scene to scene, the juxtaposition of  the placement of the characters in the scenes are particularly amusing to  watch.  Enough is enough already.  If you don't mind watching  ""period"" films, this is a breath of fresh air to the genre.",948240000,54,1081,4.905555555555556
1057885,4,6305674116,"Pretty funny, but can be difficult to keep up with, esp. if you have distractions going on around you.

1057886,5,6305674116,"I hope that I am not the only one to notice this. Nowhere in Amazon's description of  this screenplay there any mention of who wrote the it. And that was Oscar Wilde. What kind of troglodyte sells the adaptation of a play without crediting the person who wrote it?  Are we supposed to think that this brilliant plotting and characterization, the superb wit of the dialogue simply sprouted from some anonymous script writer's pen? Maybe next we can watch Midsummer Night's Dream without a mention of Shakespeare. Wilde was a brilliant man and a brilliant playwright, and it is disheartening to see the commercial exploitation of his genius without so much as a mention of his name.

I'd like to add that this adaption is brilliant, the acting is superb, and the sets are gorgeous. It is, thanks to Wilde, an absolutely ideal comedy. Couldn't be much better. We will watch it again.",1509667200,3,880,4.738562091503268

All seems perfect among a young upwardly mobile family, but the snake in this garden, played by Julianne Moore, is prepared to do everything necessary to disrupt. Rupert Everett is the perfect foil to all the main characters, as son, friend, and lover, and ties all the characters together. Cate Blanchett, Jeremy Northampton, and Minnie Driver are perfect as members of the happy family, and John Wood's portrayal of Rupert Everett's father is droll and hilarious.",1459209600,2,661,5.12037037037037

1058204,4,6305674116,"The other night, some friends and I were trying to decide what movie to watch.  While it wasn't my first choice, we wound up watching An Ideal Husband.  Since I love Oscar Wilde's plays, I figured I'd enjoy it.  And I was right.

It's London season for the upper society in the 1890's, and for Lord Arthur Goring (Rupert Goring), life is grand.  He spends his time avoiding the trap of marriage set by the eligible women and his father's constant nagging about getting married.  His best friends are Sir Robert and Lady Gertrude Chiltern (Jeremy Northam and Cate Blanchett).  They are a very happily married couple.  Arthur is even on friendly terms with Robert's younger sister Mabel (Minnie Driver).

But all that changes when Gertrude's school chum Mrs. Cheveley (Julianne Moore) arrives on the scene.  She insists on meeting Robert, and it turns out that is because she wants him to back something in Parliament - something that will bring her a great fortune but will cost the country much.  And she is using blackmail to get her way.  Will Robert give in?  How will this secret affect his marriage?  And how might the fallout affect Arthur and Mabel?

This is based on one of Wilde's plays, and if you are familiar with his comedies at all, then you know you are in for a wild, hilarious ride.  You never want to miss a line because it either advances the story or sets up the next joke - sometimes both.  Trust me, the laughs are plentiful.  Honestly, he could give some sitcom writers a few lessons on how to write comedy.

Unlike some of Wilde's plays, the stakes in this story feel real.  Yes, he's still poking fun at the society of his day (which is funny today), but he puts his characters through some real struggles along the way.  I wasn't sure how he would resolve things, but he did so brilliantly.  What I thought was the climax came early, but I still found the rest of the movie entertaining.

And for fans of Wilde's best known play, The Importance of Being Ernest, there are a couple of very nice nods to the play here.

The cast is wonderful at bringing the characters and the world of the story to life.  I thought the performances were all perfect, and the subtlety in one scene was absolutely hysterical.

But I do have an issue with this movie - one that would probably be bigger if I had seen the play first.  I get that they don't want to take a play and film it for two hours on two or three sets, so they break something into smaller scenes to help keep the movie audience from being bored.  However, quite often in the first act, they start a conversation in one setting and continue it in another.  It's obviously the same scene continued, but too much time has passed for them to be picking up where they left off.  That drives me completely up a wall.  As the movie progresses, they do a better job of keeping scenes in one location and making scene changes fit with the progress of the plot.  It's not as bad as they've butchered other Wilde plays (some of them are unwatchable as a result), but maybe if I saw the play I'd think that about this movie.

But since this was my introduction to the story, I really did enjoy An Ideal Husband.  This is a comedy of manners that anyone who loves to laugh will enjoy.",1433203200,,3248,4.412457912457913
1058205,5,6305674116,"I have been searching for this movie since I first saw it on one of the movie channels.  I am glad that it has finally been released.

Rupert Everett as the dashing playboy Lord Goring, Jeremy Northam as Sir Chilton of Parliament and Julianne Moore as the wicked Mrs. Cheveley embody their characters and provide delicious performances.

Sir Chilton has a secret that can ruin his public reputation.  Mrs. Cheveley knows that secret and will use it to devastate him if he does not comply with her request.  Lord Goring has the shrewdness to thwart Mrs. Cheveley at her endeavor.

1058493,2,6305674116,"Oh no, they did it again. The script writer - at the same time director - the art masters and probably the producers too, managed to make a hollow dcor operetta from what is one of brilliant Oscar Wilde's most interesting plays. After ""The Importance of Being Earnest"" I had hoped this film adaptation would be better, but unfortunately I was disappointed again.

Wildes' wit, his criticism of society, his detail-loving characterisation and the moral question at the centre of the plot are more or less drowned in endlessly changing settings and costumes. It seems as if the filmmakers did not understand what the story is all about and thought that the viewers could only be drawn into the cinemas with promises of richly detailed pictures of the Victorian way of life.
Any half-way well made stage production could perform Wildes' play in a more interesting way than this film; on a stage you can't employ settings so lavishly, but the point is that you are not supposed to concentrate on those but on the remarkable characters and ingenious texts. ""An Ideal Husband"" is a more than a hundred years old theatre play but by no means stuffy or fusty. This film, on the contrary, is precisely that.

Who is interested in this play in my opinion ought to wait until the next amateur group brings it on stage and watch it there; it is hardly possible to interpret it in more boringly and superficially than in this film version. Oliver Parker may be a professional filmmaker, but when it comes to reading literary texts to me he is an absolute beginner, without any respect for the author's ideas, wit, acumen and originality, only desiring to fulfil the cheap parameters with which he believes he can attract the largest number of viewers into the cinemas. Many of the actors playing here are stars and most of them usually excellent actors: but there is nothing here that even they could actually save.",1391904000,2,1902,4.743202416918429

All in all I find it very strenuous to follow what is being said and I don't believe that was the idea.
It feels as if it has been dubbed afterwards and perhaps the actors were asked to only whisper to give it some sort of intimate feeling;  who knows?

1058817,4,6305674116,"Have you ever looked at a person who seems to be perfect in every way, and thought to yourself, ""No one is perfect. They must have done something wrong, sometime.""

And the dark secrets of a seemingly perfect man are at the heart of ""An Ideal Husband,"" a powerful and witty adaptation of Oscar Wilde's classic play. It's not entirely faithful to the play, but it rests on Wilde's brilliant writing and a quartet of formidable actors (although Minnie Driver's character seems... almost unnecessary).

Sir Robert Chiltern (Jeremy Northam) seems to have it all -- a flourishing career in Parliament, his beautiful and perfect wife Lady Gertrude (Cate Blanchett), and the universal respect given to a man with a perfect reputation. He has a vivacious sister (Minnie Driver) and is pals with a charming, womanizing, ironic and very bored playboy, Lord Goring (Rupert Everett).

But when a certain Mrs. Cheveley (Julianne Moore) arrives from Vienna, things take a sudden turn for the worst. She has Robert's dirty little secret, a financial scam from years ago. She'll give him the proof of his misdeed, but only if he sacrifices his principles and supports the Suez Canal motion. Otherwise, she'll make the letter public and wreck his marriage and his career. It's up to Lord Goring to get his pal out of trouble...

""An Ideal Husband"" is an enjoyable and witty play, with a plot that twists right up to the final scenes and a genuinely romantic subplot -- the only downside is the exclusion of one subplot from the original play The study of morality, payback for one's sins, the power of words and the need for forgiveness is much more interesting than the typical period-dress drama.

And the movie flows along well, with a brisk pace and plenty of emotionally charged scenes, although one early scene where Everett strings together and rattles off a bunch of Wildean witticisms feels like they were informing us ""See? This is a witty, ironic movie!"" But the rough spots are soon smoothed out in an elegant barrage of exquisite costumes, sleek dialogue, and some clever in-jokes (Robert and Gertrude go to watch ""The Importance of Being Earnest"").

But the strongest part of the movie is the central quartet of actors: Northam gives a powerful performance as a man torn between self-preservation and honesty, while Blanchett is enchanting as a woman whose love for her husband is disrupted by her excessively high standards. Moore is brilliantly slimy, charming and sexual, and she has great chemistry with Everett's lazy, witty playboy-with-a-heart-of-gold.

The one downside is Minnie Driver, who gives a strangely twitchy performance. Her character is meant to be a love interest for Everett, but since he has zero chemistry with her (and plenty with Northam and Moore), she feels... unnecessary.

""An Ideal Husband"" is a cool, elegant little period piece, with a powerful underlying message about facing up to your past sins. And the best part is the four lead actors.",1304208000,,2970,4.973790322580645

Lord Arthur Goring: I love talking about nothing, Father. It's the only thing I know anything about.

1058823,5,6305674116,"Oliver Parker's film of Oscar Wilde's ""An Ideal Husband"" demonstrates that Wilde's epigrams have lost none of their witty sting, and that his observations on society remain as profound and sagacious as they were more than a hundred years ago. Societal customs and mores may have changed enormously, but human nature has not. Wilde's themes of political skulduggery and financial swindling at the highest levels of society are all the more pertinent today, and the theme of dark secrets between men and women is as old as Aristophanes and as new as the latest rap song. All of this roils beneath the elegant, creamy surface of Wilde's story, brought to life in this film by a sterling cast amid the most sumptuous photography, costumes and set design imaginable.

Unfortunately, the themes of dark secrets and societal hypocrisy had enormous echoes in Wilde's own life. Parker creates a deep poignancy in the film in a scene portraying Wilde himself taking a bow after a rapturously received performance of ""The Importance of Being Earnest."" A caption at the beginning of the film tells us the action takes place during the London social season of 1895, which in real life was the exact time Wilde was sent to Reading Gaol. Wilde's appearance in the film can only be seen as a lament for what might have been, if Wilde had never met Bosie or read Queensberry's card.

The video transfer on the DVD is crisp and beautiful; however, there is very little in the way of extras, except for a short featurette about the making of the film. In the featurette, however, there is an amusing glimpse of Rupert Everett filming a scene in which his feet apparently would not be visible in the finished film. He is wearing impeccable white tie...and running shoes.",1254009600,,1750,4.810631229235881

1058875,3,6305674116,"Others have reviewed this film accurately stating a lot which was well said.

Vaguely inspired by Wilde -some quotations feel contrived indeed- this is a good film as long as you disregard its main theme, that of everybody's being imperfect and that real love and maturity are achieved by accepting one's partner and oneself for what they really are, flaws and all.

In fact, when dealing with the matter, the rhythm skips some beats, acting become less convincing and the script even more so.

Much is to be enjoyed instead: the accurate rendition of a specific time, with fabulous costumes and settings, the good acting and the continuos, spotless bantering of the different characters that, when forgetting about Wilde, sounds sharp and cutting and convincing on the actor's mouths.
Poor Everett has to deal with more Wildean lines than everyone else and that he can survive them tells us volumes about how good an actor he is.

Do not misunderstand me, I love Wilde and I am sure each of these actors would be perfectly capable of doing one of his plays: unfortunately this is not one of his plays and the script, elsewhere sparkling, suddenly loses gloss when Wilde is being imitated. Or when the attempt is made at conveying the deep theme mentioned above.

It's probable that the big screen treatment and some well known actors will bring an audience to Wilde's plays that would never attend a theatre performance of them, let alone read them (the texts are available as a free download at [...] But a cinematic treatment must in some sense be an adaptation, not merely a performance, so something is gained and something is lost.

Oscar Wilde turned from prose to theatre in 1891 and after writing some lesser plays, in 1895 produced his two best works, An Ideal Husband and The Importance of Being Ernest. Then he was attacked because of his homosexuality (probably bisexuality) tried (there were three trials and two acquittals before the prosecution succeeded), sent to prison, bankrupted, separated from his family and driven, ill, into exile, where he soon died. The punishment is a landmark of legal injustice. Before his destruction Wilde created a theatre that excelled that of Congreve and Sheridan. He exhibited a mastery of construction and a brilliance in dialogue that have never been excelled in English dramatic literature. He also revealed, beneath the surface brilliance, an astonishing understanding of human nature. These two plays are characterised by witty insight and entertaining wisdom.

Adapting such precisely constructed works is like disassembling a watch and putting the parts in a wall clock. Each of the parts might well work, but the clock may not tell the right time. Before looking at Parker's adaption it is worth noting how An Ideal Husband has been treated by other film makers. Alexander Korda's 1947 version with Paulette Goddard as Cheveley is an adaptation that remains poised between film and stage and succeeds as neither. Rudolph Cartier directed a version for the BBC in 1969 with Jeremy Brett and Margaret Leighton. This version managed to bring out both the drama and the comedy of the play (Wilde as successfully merges genres as does Shakespeare) and is a stage version with the only filmic contribution the fluid camera movement. This version is probably the best acted one. The 1998 version directed by Bill Cartlidge, with Jonathan Firth and Prunella Scales, is much too static to be successful, though some performances are very good.

Parker's 1999 version <ASIN: 6305692696> stars Cate Blanchett and Jeremy Northam as the Chilterns, Minnie Driver as Mabel, Rupert Everett as Goring and Julianne Moore as Cheveley. Parker rewrites the script, leaving out episodes and putting in several of his own. His film includes extensive location shots and very effective use of the sets and costumes available.

Two things emerge from Parker's rewrite. Firstly, he's not nearly as good a dramatist as Wilde. Some Parker episodes, such as Sir Robert's speech before Parliament or Lady Chiltern's admission of having told a lie, I found embarrassingly awkward. Insertion of location shots I thought sometimes ruined the pace of an episode, with more than once a street or countryside scene interrupting a fast paced dialogue.

Secondly, Parker is turning what is originally a witty and exciting drama into a romantic comedy. Marketing, I suppose.

What concerned me more was the actor's delivery of their lines. Avoiding the over precise, clipped enunciation common in Wilde meant to tell us we are hearing epigrams, the actors in this film frequently murmur or whisper to one another and just as frequently speak without moving their lips. I don't want to have the play stop while an actor delivers a witty line but I do want to hear the remark.

These things have been done to get away from theatre (Errgh!) and present the audience with something they are familiar with in the cinema. By and large it works, largely by effective acting. All of the principals are good, though I don't agree with some of the direction they get. This is a good introduction to Wilde. I think anyone who likes it will like the BBC version (now available on DVD) better <ASIN: B0019BI1FA>. And the plays are good to read.

Parker's Ernest suffers from the same pros and cons as his Husband. Again, the BBC version is the one I prefer. Directed by Stuart Burge in 1986, it stars Joan Plowright as Bracknell, Paul McGann as Worthing and Rupert Frazer as Algernon Moncrieff. This in my view excels the famous Anthony Asquith 1952 version with Edith Evans and Michael Redgrave. Both of these last two are filmed plays and the films work very well, the groundwork having been done for the directors by Wilde's masterly construction.",1226620800,3,4936,4.979368932038835
1058878,5,6305674116,"It is always impossible to adapt a play to the screen without making some changes- and that was also true in this case.  To which the only proper response is to say- so what? Did they keep the spirit and main ideas? Is it largely the same story? And in the case of any Oscar Wilde play- did they keep as much of the language, the dialogue and the wit as was possible?  In this film the answer to all of these questions was a resounding YES- if Oscar Wilde had been available, this is what he would have done to turn his play into a film- especially given the extraordinary loads of talent he would have had to work with.  There is not a single character here who was not perfectly cast and who did not deliver a pitch perfect performance. Oscar would have been very proud of this film.  We probably watch this fabulous movie about four times a year.  Even the DVD was very well done. This is one fabulous, beautiful movie.

1058883,4,6305674116,"This film has several real strenghts, including the witty dialogue by Oscar Wilde, the fine job of acting by the cast, and the beauty of the setting and gowns worn by the three primary actresses.

You have to remain alert while watching and listening to a play by Oscar Wilde as it is full of snappy, sharp dialogue and Rupert Everett is perfect playing a Wilde character. Jeremy Northam and Cate Blanchett also do a great job playing the straight characters in a Wilde dramatic comedy. Julianne Moore does an excellent job playing the role of a villaness. Minnie Driver is the only one of the actors who seems to be having a bit of a challenge with her role. Northam and Blanchett are meant to be the straight pair of lovers whereas Driver and Everett are the comedy pair of lovers. Driver and Everett have a bit of trouble pulling this off and their attraction to each other seems labored and unreal.

The settings are beautiful but the period gowns are over the top.

Underneath all the witty snide dialogue, and the twists and turns of a comedy, there is a morality play nestled in this film. The film is primarily about morals and payment for the sin's of one's past. Sir Robert Chiltern, a rising star in parliment, was once an assistant to a cabinet member. In this position he was able to provide an investor inside information about the Suez Canal. This resulted in his making a vast fortune as part of his bribe. Now, years later, Mrs. Cheveley, is attempting to blackmail him into supporting another canal in Argentina so that she can make a killing with her investment in the scheme.

We see all three of the main actors, Northam, Blanchett, and Everett grow and change as they undergo this ordeal. The film is entertaining.",1181433600,,1736,4.590322580645161

1058935,5,6305674116,"(I have not read the play nor seen it performed on stage so I didn't miss the features that other reviewers have mentioned.) I found this thoroughly enjorable. Rupert Everett perfectly embodies the paradoxical virtues of Oscar Wilde...the self admitted scoundral who only speaks seriously on Tuesdays from 1 to 3.  His total opposite is Gertrude (Blanchett), married to her ideal husband, a man she has placed on a formidably high pedestal of virtue.  Naturally, that had to fall and the scoundral saves the day.  (Knowing what we do of Wilde's life we can appreciate this theme even more.)  Underneath his protestations of superficiality he emerges as the real hero.

That's the theme -- that no one is perfect and that it takes more courage to love an imperfect person than a perfect one.  But Wilde doesn't bludgeon us over the head with the message---he delights us with the brilliant dialogue and clever plot.  If there were no moral at all, it would still be a delight to watch.

The acting is all very good.  Rupert Everett, as everyone has mentioned, seems born to play Wilde.  I disagree with those who said there was no chemistry between him and the Minnie Driver character.  I thought their scenes together were the most entertaining in the film.  She is genuinely funny as well as very beautiful.  Blanchett is perfect in her role of the pale, virtuous-to-boredom wife.  I thought the only weak link was Julianne Moore, who seemed miscast as the villianess.  Perhaps I've seen her in too many ""realistic"" American roles which she does with such depth of humanity and vulnerability that I had a hard time adjusting to this Julianne.  I thought her accent was lacking and she just didn't have the arch quality that such a part demanded.  However she carried it off well enough not to spoil the enjoyment of the film.  It's definitely fun and worth seeing.",1174608000,,1865,4.775

1058938,2,6305674116,"As other reviewers have been, I'm also unhappy with the removal of central plot elements, especially Mrs. Cheveley's broach.  The effect of removing this element is that it is Chiltern who saves Goring, not Goring who saves Chiltern, and the play therefore never gives Goring his moment of heroism and nobility.  This film  is too jolly and innocent.  Laura Cheveley's hubris, Robert Chiltern's anguish, these are really side shows in the film which focuses more on Goring, his wit, and his pre-marital uncertainty.

I do think the film is entertaining, for what it is worth.  Anyone who has an interest in romantic comedy or a very casual interest in Wilde will probably enjoy it.  If you know this play and Oscar Wilde well, though, you may be frustrated.",1148169600,9,757,4.8671875

1058942,5,6305674116,"Oliver Parker has done a fine job in adapting Oscar Wilde's play THE IDEAL HUSBAND for this 1999 screen version.  The transition is seamless with all the jabs and foibles of high society and political shenanigans mixed together to a fare-thee-well by a superb cast of fine actors.  Dress this all in the sumptuous sets by Michael Howells, Rod McLean and Katie Lee  and elegant costumes by Caroline Harris and embroider with a musical score by Charlie Mole and the result is one of the more satisfying period comedies to come along in a long time.

As the rising politician Sir Robert Chiltern (Jeremy Northam) ascends in Parliament, secrets from his past are brought to bear from out-of-towner Mrs. Laura Cheveley (Julianne Moore) who in turn surfaces dalliances by Lady Chiltern (Cate Blanchett) and the Wildean man about town Lord Arthur Goring (Rupert Everett) under the ever-present eye of Sir Robert's sister Miss Mabel (Minnie Driver).  Political promises are made as blackmail but in the end everyone's little lies and pacts are placed on the table and all's well that ends well.

The visual pleasure of the film is matched by the witty lines delivered by the top-notch cast in perfect Victorian Oscar Wilde fashion.

The cast is highly watchable and all well up to their jobs. The only exception I might make is Minnie Driver. Although I like her, I couldn't help but feel she was miscast in what was meant to be an alternate take on the classic ingenue part.  It didn't help that there was little chemistry between her and Lord Goring. Or that her strong red and black costumes emphasized the modern, while everyone else was dressed in standard period clothing and colors. This is a fairly minor quibble, though.

I enjoyed Rupert Everett as the well-born, razor tongued society wastrel...clearly a stand-in for Wilde himself. Julianne Moore is stunning as the predator who sets everything in motion. And Cate Blanchett and Jeremy Northam were of course wonderful as the perfect couple. I could have used a few more scenes showing both them and their marriage, instead of just having to accept what everyone says about their happiness.  Jeremy Northam was excellently cast. He is absolutely believable as the kind of man you can still believe is honest and good, even when he's caught cheating. That's important. The story doesn't really work unless you believe he is a good man.

As for the ""question of nudity"" discussed by an earlier reviewer: I watched the opening scene closely to see if what he posted was true. Is the woman leaving Lord Goring's bed really Gertrude (Blanchett)? I don't think so. The woman's hair is curly, yes, but it is bright red. Blanchett's hair in this is a medium blonde.

Rupert Everett is the heart and soul of the film, the screen positively crackles when he is on screen delivering his spate of one-liners. Julianne Moore is equally vibrant, if only in a more ascerbic skin. Cate Blanchett, Minnie Driver and Jeremy Northam round out the splendid cast that'll have you hooked.

However, I've read over a hundred reviews here and elsewhere and most -- if not all -- of the reviewers appear to have 'missed the boat.'
That is, in the opening scene at Lord Goring's (Rupert Everett - who is wonderfully cast, by the way) bedroom, where a woman nude is 'glimpsed' sneaking away from the bed -- and the butler's eyes.  I thought it was simply an establishing scene for Lord Goring's character (or lack of).  HA!  Did I drop the ball...
Instead my wife pointed out (after the movie) that the woman was not the prostitute most reviews identified but GERTRUDE.  I was shocked and bet otherwise; then I played the DVD (using the pause function to pay it second by second) several times.  Yes, it was Gertrude; the wavy hair is the give away since the distant figure is otherwise out of focus!!!  I lost the best, but gained a whole new appreciation of the film.
With this in mind, watch ""An Ideal Husband"" again and everything is different!  Gertrude's smug attitude and moral indignation take on an entirely new flavor; the ending, where her husband glosses over the 'revelation' about note suddenly makes sense.

And the dark secrets of a seemingly perfect man are at the heart of ""An Ideal Husband,"" a powerful and witty adaptation of Oscar Wilde's classic play. It's not entirely faithful to the play, but it rests on Wilde's brilliant writing and a quartet of formidable actors (although Minnie Driver's character seems... almost unnecessary).

Sir Robert Chiltern (Jeremy Northam) seems to have it all -- a flourishing career in Parliament, his beautiful and perfect wife Lady Gertrude (Cate Blanchett), and the universal respect given to a man with a perfect reputation. He has a vivacious sister (Minnie Driver) and is pals with a charming, womanizing, ironic and very bored playboy, Lord Goring (Rupert Everett).

But when a certain Mrs. Cheveley (Julianne Moore) arrives from Vienna, things take a sudden turn for the worst. She has Robert's dirty little secret, a financial scam from years ago. She'll give him the proof of his misdeed, but only if he sacrifices his principles and supports the Suez Canal motion. Otherwise, she'll make the letter public and wreck his marriage and his career. It's up to Lord Goring to get his pal out of trouble...

""An Ideal Husband"" is an enjoyable and witty play, with a plot that twists right up to the final scenes and a genuinely romantic subplot -- the only downside is the exclusion of one subplot from the original play The study of morality, payback for one's sins, the power of words and the need for forgiveness is much more interesting than the typical period-dress drama.

And the movie flows along well, with a brisk pace and plenty of emotionally charged scenes, although one early scene where Everett strings together and rattles off a bunch of Wildean witticisms feels like they were informing us ""See? This is a witty, ironic movie!"" But the rough spots are soon smoothed out in an elegant barrage of exquisite costumes, sleek dialogue, and some clever in-jokes (Robert and Gertrude go to watch ""The Importance of Being Earnest"").

But the strongest part of the movie is the central quartet of actors: Northam gives a powerful performance as a man torn between self-preservation and honesty, while Blanchett is enchanting as a woman whose love for her husband is disrupted by her excessively high standards. Moore is brilliantly slimy, charming and sexual, and she has great chemistry with Everett's lazy, witty playboy-with-a-heart-of-gold.

The one downside is Minnie Driver, who gives a strangely twitchy performance. Her character is meant to be a love interest for Everett, but since he has zero chemistry with her (and plenty with Northam and Moore), she feels... unnecessary.

""An Ideal Husband"" is a cool, elegant little period piece, with a powerful underlying message about facing up to your past sins. And the best part is the four lead actors.

No person is perfect, and the movie isn't either. But Blanchett, Moore and Northam are excellent and the movie is a visual feast. A pleasant diversion.",1051920000,69,3123,4.967432950191571
1059024,3,6305674116,"This movie would've been perfect if the filmmaker hadn't left out the very important and hugely delicious ""bracelet scene"" from Wilde's original play. If you've read the play, you'll know which scene I mean. The point and beauty of Wilde's play is that the blackmailer (Mrs Cheveley, who thinks she's too clever for everyone) gets blackmailed in return (in the scene where the bracelet plays a major part). The tagline of Wilde's play (in the backcover of the Penguin Books edition I own) reads: ""In order to be a successful blackmailer, one's own reputation must be beyond reproach"". In Wilde's play, the ""bracelet scene"" involves the cool Lord Goring and the scheming Mrs Cheveley. Why, why was the scene omitted from the movie?! Did the filmmaker find it difficult to produce the special-clasp bracelet? As a result, the movie fails to capture the most important point of the play and becomes only an average fare with a plot that fizzles out in the end. Instead of an embarrassed and defeated Mrs Cheveley who unexpectedly gets a taste of her own medicine (as in Wilde's play), the movie gives us a rather smug, victorious (and heaven forbid, almost ""virtuous"") Mrs Cheveley in the end. This is totally different from what Wilde intended in his play and I find the omission of the ""bracelet scene"" to be a bad and unforgivable mistake on the filmmaker's part. Ugh! Hugely dissapointing!
Watch the movie if you must, for its fine cast, beautiful costumes and witty lines (many taken verbatim from the play, of course). Just don't expect to experience the 'true spirit' of Wilde's play.

1059026,5,6305674116,"This 1999 British production (with a running time of 97 minutes) is without a doubt the most deliciously witty film I have ever seen, but then based as it is on Oscar Wilde's play, I would expect no less.  Wilde's gift for wit is, even now, unsurpassed, and for all the liberties taken with this film, it's wonderful to see that so much of the original wit and dialogue has remained intact.
The film takes place in London in 1895.  At issue is the habit some women had of idolizing their husbands--of putting them on pedestals and creating ideals out of them, with their love being directly proportional to the perceived perfection of their husbands.  The problems inherent in such a relationship are obvious; for one thing, as the film highlights, the higher a man has been raised, the harder he can expect to fall.
The film revolves around Sir Robert Chiltern (Jeremy Northam), a Member of Parliament and ""ideal husband,"" and his seemingly faultless wife, Gertrude (Cate Blanchett).  But Sir Robert is not, of course, an ""ideal.""  Sad to say, he is a mere mortal with feet of clay whose very marriage depends upon his wife as she discovers her husband's imperfection, her own imperfection, and whether or not she can love a man who is a mere flawed mortal.
I don't wish to give the story away.  Suffice it to say, it is absolutely delightful and (for the most part) consummately acted.  Although the story revolves around the Chilterns, the central character is really Lord Goring (Rupert Everett), a very content, witty, idle, and carefree bachelor whose time has come to marry, or so his father Lord Caversham has decided.
For those familiar with the play, I must emphasise that this is a film.  It is not a film of the play.  Not being restricted, therefore, in place and time as live theatre is, justifiable liberties have been taken to create something visually appealing and exciting in a way that Wilde could never have conceived possible.  A wealth of different settings have been utilised (rather than just three), and events that were merely alluded to in the play have been dramatised (by flashback in one instance).  Though much of the dialogue is (thankfully) verbatim, it has been trimmed back here and there and occasionally has not been placed where it occurs in the play.  The gravest liberty, however, has been to remove the part wherein one of the characters uses a brooch as a bargaining chip with a certain blackmailer.  Instead the film has these two characters reaching a different arrangement, one which relies upon the outcome of a particular Parliamentary speech.  Whether justifiable or not, I did find that this alteration extended the suspense and added an additional (and quite entertaining) reason for interest in the outcome of the speech, and it was certainly a plausible arrangement in view of the proposal the blackmailer had first made.
Whether or not one is an Oscar Wilde purist, this is a film to be enjoyed, for it is a treasure indeed to find a show that is at heart a comedy which does not descend into silliness.  At a time when most films are geared towards adolescents (or those with like mentalities), this film is a refreshing, delicious treat--a witty and wonderful feast for the intellect.  Very highly recommended to anyone who enjoys the wit of Oscar Wilde, period productions, or to anyone who is simply looking for an intelligent, entertaining and thoroughly satisfying comedy.  It's definitely not one to be missed!",1036454400,12,3471,4.8263069139966275

In addition, there is a source of unreliable information and black mail that increases the chances for assumptions.

This is the greatest production of an Oscar Wilde play I have ever seen, and leaves me on pins and needles waiting for the release later this year of The Importance of Being Earnest because it also stars an actor who seems born to perform in Wilde's plays/movies:  Rupert Everett.
The performances: wonderful all. Rupert Everett's work nears the genius level. Jeremy Northam as a not-so-perfect parliamentarian is great. John Wood as his father stands out. And there are the ever-so-essential ladies: Cate Blanchett as Northam's wife (would you believe she is Australian?), who believes she has a perfect husband. Julianne Moore as one of the most charmingly wicked women ever to grace the screen (would you believe she is from North Carolina?), and the very strong presence of Minnie Driver (yes, she actually is from England). All together, they create an effervescent champagne of a film.
The perfect find out they are not so perfect. The expecters of perfection find out they themselves are also not so perfect. Love finally lowers its standards to include the imperfection of the beloved. Even the loser at evildoing turns out to have an unexpected side to her. This is the film's theme. The actors and the director of this film, however, ironically bring this film close to, if not at, the peak of perfection.
The final scene is an ode to joy. Watch it and have fun!",1027728000,60,1583,4.7773722627737225
1059031,4,6305674116,"An Ideal Husband is an English film based on a comedy by Oscar Wilde. It's about how a group of English aristocrats handled the threat of a scandal a hundred years ago. How we handle everything has pretty much changed since then, and, in that sense, some of the movie's story is dated. Mr. Wilde's wit and style, however, remain as sharp as every. His characters' interactions and, most importantly, conversations with each other hold their own against the very best of today's situation comedies.
Things are going splendidly for Sir Robert Chiltern [Jeremy Northam] and his wife, Lady Gertrud [Cate Blanchett]. He's a hot ticket in English politics, and she, herself a respected social figure, is steadfast by his side. Their honor is beyond reproach. It seems the sky's the limit, socially speaking, until Laura Chevely [Julianne Moore] comes to London. It seems Laura has a letter indicating that Sir Robert's fortune may not have been gained in an ethical fashion, and she blackmails him. The victim must turn for help to his best friend, Lord Arthur Goring [Rupert Everett], whose sole goal in life is to accomplish absolutely nothing. Meanwhile, Sir Robert's sister, Mabel [Minnie Driver], is hopelessly in love with Lord Goring. He has no intentions of marrying anyone. That would blemish his hard-earned reputation.
There is a parallel with modern politicians' desperate attempts to avoid scandal, although I doubt Mrs. Chevely's information would have much impact in today's cynical climate. This is not the part which seems most dated. It is the relationships between the sexes which have changed so radically, and it is in this area that some viewers will be lost. Both Lady Gertrud and Lord Goring are types which are now practically extinct.
An Ideal Husband was meticulously cast with performers who are perfect for their roles. The costumes are wonderful, as are the sets. Of course, in England you can still recreate almost any time period with the right street or the right estate.
It is Mr. Wilde's words that remain the centerpiece, and it those with an ear for language who will most appreciate this cinematic bon mot. These are characters who know that the best defense in life's stickiest situations is to talk one's way out of it. [Historical note: In his own life, Wilde was unable to do the same.]",1016582400,3,2322,4.9411764705882355

Rupert Everett is cast perfectly as the living embodiment of self-absorbed Lord Arthur Goring, the well-born son of old money and quite happy to pursue a life of profound idleness. The story, while centered on an international investment scheme promoted by a woman of mystery and dubious character, Mrs. Laura Cheveley (Julianne Moore), describes with sharp unerring wit, timeless facets of the human condition that define us as, well... human. Wilde's take on friendship, fidelity, greed, ethics, political maneuverings, betrayal and ultimately the love we all seek, is pure delight. The film, adapted from Wilde's 1895 stage play, is a visual feast of elaborate costumes and lush interior sets. The story moves along at a fairly good pace. The acting throughout is top-notch, noteworthy for mention is Cate Blanchett (of ""Elizabeth"") who always delivers a polished performance.

The man caught in the middle of the whole mess is Aurthur (Everett), basically the main character that stands amidst of all tradgedies and intrigue that revolve around him and his friends and lovers. He keeps himself busy surrounded by so many catastrophies of the heart, while searching his own.

1059065,2,6305674116,"Oliver Parker's screen version of 'An Ideal Husband' leaves very little of Oscar Wilde's original play, save a few lines he has modestly allowed remain beside his own fabrications (which include a bizarrely anachronistic flashback in which a Mephistophelean aristcrat tempts an ambitious civil servant into fraud with the insight that 'Knowledge' is 'power').  The plays of Wilde, like those of Beckett, cannot be taken from the rarefied, static stage, for which they were intricately contrived, and speciously 'opened out'.  The structural movement and thematic complexity of Wilde's work depends on the theatre functioning as a microcosm for a society based on roles, costumes, masks, plots, etc.  Farcical contrivances that seem natural on the stage look silly on screen (e.g. the central business with assignations and rooms in Goring's house).  Stylised characters and situations wither when placed in a 'realistic' and 'psychological' context, and with them dies the preciously artificial dialogue (this is not helped by leaving out crucial plot points and inserting redundancies).  The restless pace and imbecilic breaking up of dialogues in different locations destroy all momentum.  Treating these marionettes as 'people' makes the play seem either an improbable melodrama or a harmless satire, endorsing the hypocrisy Wilde savages.
This is not to say Parker's adaptation is entirely worthless.  he moves the play's centre away from the dull central marriage onto the two far more enjoyable outsiders Lord Goring and Mrs. Cheevely.  (This might make nonsense of Wilde, but showcases the marvellous and sexy Rupert Everett, the one actor in the ensemble who seems to know that acting in Wilde requires as much stylised training as Shakespeare).  It is here that Wilde's delight in paradox emerges most playfully: Goring the louche, idle, womanising and possibly homosexual aristocrat makes a much more ideal husband than the publicly feted but hypocritical and criminal Sir Robert.  It is this outsider who works hardest to protect the status quo, by encouraging its members to lie and rewrite the past; the sexually loose and dangerously independent Mrs. Chevely tries to bring it down by telling the Truth.  Parker self-reflexively includes Wilde in his own play, setting the work in the year of his fall and imprisonment, showing precisely what's at stake.  On the other hand, he sets up Lady Chiltern as a latterday Suffragette, only to knock her down, returning her moral power to her husband (although Parker makes her such a prig we probably won't mind).  Thankfully, he doesn't overegg the 'contemporary relevance' (yawn).  There is little of the terrifying dissolution of identity threatening the characters in Wilde, but, in a heritage film of typical visual flaccidity there is one exquisite shot where happy couples are framed in proscenium-arched curtains, Parker finally admitting that you can take Wilde out of the theatre, but you can't take the theatre out of Wilde.",1011139200,7,2992,5.3518123667377395

The story concerns the blackmail plot(s) of the devious Julianne Moore as she attempts to get parliament to vote in favor of her nefarious scheme.

1059070,5,6305674116,"Wit, style, and an understated sense of comedy make The Ideal Husband a film every library should include.  Rupert Everett as Lord Goring is idle, rich, and devastatingly handsome -- and, he is single.  Every woman in London should be lined up outside his door, but then, that would be a Hollywood movie instead of a perfect British comedy of errors.  Oscar Wilde had no match when it came to writing drawing room comedy about the foibles of the class conscious Brits in the 19th century. This film gives a fine lesson of how comedy does not have to be falling down slapstick nor cretin teenage fart humor to be successful on screen.  It is elegant and riotous.
Jeremy Notham is Robert, an ambitious and rising politician with a secret in his past.  Cate Blanchett as Gertrude, his Lady wife is above reproach with an inflexible sense of self-richousness of others.  With Minnie Driver and American Julianne Moore superbly cast against type in the role of the the dubious Mrs. Cheevly,  this cast perfectly translates Wilde's humor to screen.  It is Rupert Everett however, who carries the film with a performance that should have won him more recognition than it did.  Overall, The Ideal Husband is one of the best ensemble  performances of the year.  Visual settings convey the Victorian sensibility without squeeky clean idealism that plagues many of the Ivory/Merchant productions.

1059073,5,6305674116,"To be a Oscar Wilde leading character, one must not only have the moxie of line delivery but the suave confidence to win over a public and not come across as a pompous snob.  Rupert Everett does a fabulous job as the head of this cast, bringing the heart of Wilde's play out with every mannerism and sharp retort.
Julianne Moore, as Mrs. Chevely delivers her lines as if she'd written them herself with the slighest hint of malice to every double entendre and retort.  She and Rupert have great chemistry together and towards the end, you find a part of yourself lamenting that alas, evil cannot win over the confirmed bachelor.  Her impish smile and calm demeanor unwordingly convey that she didn't start this situation - she's merely using it to her best advantage.
Cate Blanchett, in yet another transformative role, takes on what should be a moralistic and uptight role and gives us a window into a world of ethics.  She is truly betrayed when she learns of her husband's past folly not so much for *his* own error in judgement, but for what she accepts in the behavior that surrounds her.  With her delicate expression and crack in voice, she lets us into the level of disappointment this revelation has inflicted upon her.  Jeremy Northam as her husband, is given ample screen time to introduce us to his character, but not enough time for us to sympathize to his dilemma.
Almost the same can be said about Minnie Driver's interpretation of Mabel.  The tone of her voice and the upturning of her nose convey what should be Victorian pomp, but work themselves intoan arrogance not seen in the other players.  In a few scenes, one is completely confused as to what it is exactly that could so enchant Lord Goring, but thankfully Everett's charm convinces us that yes indeed, the cynic has a heart and it beats for Mabel.
All in all, the film is well made, witty and will have you laughing one breath, condemning a character the next. Compared to other period flicks, this one offers us a happy ending - always a good thing, when so many tend to drift towards depressing waters.",986947200,,2081,4.62059620596206

If you are buying this on VHS and DVD, please be informed that the camera-work in this film is of abysmally low quality. Some shots are way out of focus, embarrasingly so. There are a few remarkable and not-so-remarkable things about this film, so lets plunge right in :
a) Rupert Everett - Rupert is most at home in British settings and comedies, and he excels here. I liked him much better here than his earlier work in UK Cinema, as he seems so much more mature, confident, and at ease.
b) Julianne Moore - This is the worst thing about the film. Julianne's FAKE British accent is even worse than Madonna's accent in 'The Next Best thing'. Yes, THAT bad. If you can get past this (I couldn't), you'll enjoy much of the film.
c) The plot - This is an Oscar Wilde play, so of course, you'd have to leave your sense of plausibility behind, but the idea behind the story is way too ridiculous to be taken seriously. If you can get past this (I did), you'll breeze through the rest.
d) Cate Blanchett - While she is one of our best actresses, Cate also receives the blunt end of the bad camera-work in this movie. Did the director not like her face? Performance-wise, she is thoroughly engaging - being both vivacious and restrained at the same time.
If you love period pieces, you'll love this one. Do remember though that this IS a VERY low budget film, so the sets, costumes and style of film-making are really quite terrible, and resemble more a BBC Shakespeare adaptation than anything else. Luckily, I love those, and therefore, loved this.

1059127,4,6305674116,"Based on the Oscar Wilde play of the same name, ""An Ideal Husband"" scores as a moderately entertaining drawing room comedy thanks to the elegance of its design and the performances of its first rate  cast. Although it contains many elements of a classic Feydeau farce - comic  misunderstandings, delicately timed missteps, hairbreadth missed encounters  - the film lacks the kinetic energy necessary to allow these elements to  completely shine through. Instead, we are treated to a more laid back, more  traditionally British interpretation of the events. Indeed, the real charm  of the film lies in its sharp observation of British gentility thinly  disguising the often honey-tongued brutality lying just below the placid  surface of this society. No one smiles more sincerely or maintains such  immense social poise while slicing one's opponents to shreds than the elite  of England - and this quality director Oliver Parker captures in complete  fidelity to Wilde's overall vision.
Jeremy Northam portrays a highly  respected and happily married member of the House of Commons who is  suddenly confronted with a moral dilemma: should he allow a blackmailer to  expose an egregiously immoral action in his past, thereby ensuring the  ruination of both his career and his marriage, or should he go along with  the blackmailer's demands and publicly support a cause he knows to be  highly unethical and injurious to both his people and his nation? Julianne  Moore portrays the woman who waltzes suddenly into his life and attempts to  threaten him into supporting a doomed canal project to protect her own  financial investment. Rupert Everett also stars as a confirmed bachelor who  manages to become intricately involved in everyone's affairs.
The film  succeeds most when it concentrates on the stuffiness of the  stiff-upper-lipped British tradition juxtaposed to the single-minded  viciousness of the Moore character. She delivers a delightful  interpretation of an amoral woman utilizing cruelty to achieve her desired  ends, fitting perfectly into a morally topsy-turvy world which feasts on  scandal and the ruination of its own members, yet where a mismatched tea  set stands as the ultimate in moral turpitude. Wilde, on the other end of  the morality spectrum, also subtly jabs at the unrealistic obsession with  virtue in the character of Northam's impossibly pure wife (Cate Blanchett);  she erects so high a moral pedestal for her husband to stand upon that it  is only after she has been caught in a moral infraction herself that the  world these characters inhabit can come back into any sort of  balance.
The film is probably least effective when trying to cope with  the complex interweaving and overlapping of the characters and their  situations. Packer simply does not provide the manic energy and chaotic  pacing necessary to make such plot mechanics soar on screen. As a result,  ""An Ideal Husband"" is more likable as a genteel British comedy of  manners than the unbridled drawing room farce it seems so often to want to  be.

The plot was entirely unpredictable always leaving one at the edge of his seat  wondering what was about to happen next.  The acting was flawless.  Even  Minnie Driver who made me think that as an actress she would be a good  waitress in Good Will Hunting, redeemed herself.  It is one of those films  in which the viewer becomes totally immersed and forgets that he is  watching a movie.  The immoral character who later, reluctantly, displayed  morals and found himself left with nothing for his efforts was a brilliant  stroke of irony.",962496000,,678,4.6525423728813555
1059131,5,6305674116,"Oscar Wilde's wit shines from the very pages of his works, but the best way to enjoy him, in my opinion, is to see a performance of one of his plays. This movie is excellent, featuring a cast with the chutzpah to pull  off some of Wilde's wackiest lines, and the bizarre intrigues come to life  without seeming too surreal. Happy viewing!",961545600,,338,4.435483870967742
1059132,5,6305674116,"It is a perfect adaptation, as I far as I am concerned. Every actor is well-suited for his/her part. The film is dynamic and live. Altough Wilde's play enjoyed enormous theater success [still does], I thought that making  it into a  film would be a hard task. It probably was, but filmmakers have  done an excellent job this time.
I must also say that costumes are  simply fantastic. The three very beautiful women, Blanchett, Moore and  Driver, look absolutely divine in their dresses.  I think that designers  deserved to win an Oscar for creating such a Wilde-lesque beauty on screen.  And, of course, Everett is the most Wilde-lesque actor of them all, right  now. If he lived in the late 19 century, he would have been Wilde's leading  man in the theater, I am sure.
If you love Oscar Wilde, watch this film:  you will be delighted. His wonderful play lives here once again, thanks to  the filmmakers's efforts.",960508800,,916,4.6918238993710695

Northam, as always, is at his best in this film, and Blanchett sets him off wonderfully. It is a story of one's  past threatening one's future, and teaches a good lesson in the end. Witty,  charming, and beautiful, this is one film you have to see. However,  families be warned (and women, as well). In the opening credits is the one  thing that brought this film it's rating. A blurry figure of a nude woman.  Pity they had to spice this wonderful cake with pornography, but if you  skip the first track, all you'll miss is an eyeful.",959817600,,647,4.394957983193278

It's  completely British and I love that.  A really wonderful film.",956880000,3,418,5.149253731343284
1059169,5,6305674116,"To say that this film is a filmmaking tour de force would be a great injustice. It is far better than that. Oliver Parker's revitalizing of Oscar Wilde's classic play is filmmaking at its finest.
Every element of  this film is superlative. Wilde's story as adapted to the screen by Parker  is witty, intelligent and engaging from start to finish. Seldom can you  find a story that attempts to be a romantic comedy, a tale of duplicity  blackmail and betrayal, and a drama of political intrigue, and succeeds so  well on all counts.
The intricate weave of deception, manipulation and  double entendre along with comic misperception, irony and rapier witted  dialogue are delicious and classic Wilde. This is a film you will want to  see again and again, just to discover all the lines within the lines.
I  cannot say enough about the brilliance of Oliver Parker's direction in this  film. He has captured late 19th Century aristocratic England with vivid and  rich images that put the viewer right into the period. David Johnson's  cinematography is fantastic, with every scene working well as to lighting  and color. The beautiful blend of colors in the costumes and the set always  looked like they belonged together. Parker also provides numerous  interesting camera angles that help dramatize the scenes. It serves to  remind us that glorious films can still be made relying on the creative eye  of the director rather than special effects.
The acting was delightful.  Rupert Everett, as the self absorbed Lord Arthur Goring, delivers an  exquisite performance as the unscrupulous rogue upon whom the mantle of  truth and honor is laid.
Julianne Moore was delightful as the evil and  cunning Mrs. Cheveley. As cold, manipulative and heartless as she is with  Chiltern and Lady Chiltern, she is that vulnerable and helpless with Lord  Goring, for whom she has long held a flame. Moore handles this emotional  juggling act with great skill and you find yourself simultaneously loving  her ingeniousness and hating her treachery.
Cate Blanchett turns in  another wonderful performance as the oh-so-perfect, Lady Gertrud Chiltern.  Jeremy Northam is also excellent as Robert Chiltern, the man of untouchable  character with a scandalous secret in his past. Even Minnie Driver is  charming as Robert's sister.
This is a terrific film for the refined  viewer who appreciates all aspects of filmmaking. Even for those not into  the art of filmmaking, it is simply great entertainment. I can think of no  negative criticism of it. It is well written, directed, photographed and  acted. It is filmmaking the way it was meant to be. A perfect 10.",955929600,3,2639,5.020785219399538
1059170,3,6305674116,I liked this movie but I almost gave it two stars but the cast is grate they make the movie a hole lot better then it would of ended up to be without them. Cate Blanchett is just a grate acctres and I think she did  better in this movie then she did in Elisabeth. Minnie Driver is grate in  evrey movie that she is in and I love her she will win a Award  for one of  her movies or at least she should. Rupert Everett well I have not seen too  many movies that he has been in but he is grate in this movie offcorse he  dose make the movie seem boring in some points of the movie where he is the  only one flubing and the rest of the cast are playing there parts with no  flubs. Julianne Moore is another grate actress and I love all the movies  that she is in.,955238400,,759,3.78343949044586
1059171,5,6305674116,Rupert Everett was born to play in this movie. He's obviously perfect for the role. Julianne Moore's performance was excellent as well. A must-see for everyone.,955152000,3,160,5.1923076923076925
1059172,5,6305674116,"This movie is a real gem: an intricate period piece that illuminates as much as it entertains. A first rate cast capture the mood and mannerisms perfectly expecially the razor edge wit and intricacy that is the calling  card of Wilde's work.
What is it about? Well, blackmail, power, politics  and the shallowness of society. As relevant now as it was then! Julianne  Moore plays Mrs Cheeveley, a scheming and very smart woman who tries to  manipulate an up and coming political superstar (Northam). His wife  (Blanchett) is stunned to find that her much adored husband is less than  perfect and seeks support from a close friend (Everett). Well nothing is  straight forward as chance and prejudice tangle all manner of events into a  tight knot that can only be unravelled through humility, loyalty and  passion.
This is the best I have seen Rupert Everett (it seems like a  role he was born for) and I loved Minnie Driver in this. Her mannerisms and  pith so well portrayed her repressed feelings and expectations. Watching  her was even more delightful as I could see where the artists who drew Jane  in the Disney animation Tarzan got their inspiration from.
Blanchett and  Moore were excellent too. Blanchett as the beguiled wife was a big change  from the power she displayed in Elizabeth and Moore as the soft hearted  schemer once more demonstrated her versatility.
Based on Wilde, scripted  like Wilde, a truly excellent piece of cinema to enjoy any time.",954201600,7,1464,4.838709677419355

1059174,2,6305674116,"An Ideal Husband definitely has the ideal cast.  First, there's Rupert Everett, every inch the Wildean (and surprise!  heterosexual) dandy.  Then, there's Julianne Moore, the perfect villainess without a conscience.  And  of course, we have Jeremy Northam and Cate Blanchett, the period-piece  regulars.
Well, the cast is where the perfection ends.  Oscar Wilde's  sparkling dialogue has been pared down to '90's sensibilities, so as not to  confuse or offend anyone.  Then there's the tendency of the actors to be  unintelligible when speaking.  And of course, the at times hideous and  obviously unauthentic costumes.
There is one saving grace in An Ideal  Husband.  Oscar Wilde appears (obviously, not the actual author of the  play, but an actor) to give his infamous curtain speech at the end of his  last and greatest drama, ""The Importance of Being Earnest.""  This  was definitely the high point of the film.
If you're a Wilde purist, skip  this.  If you just like witty Brit movies set in far-off times, this is for  you.  But just realize there are better Victorian films out there, like  Wilde or Her Majesty Mrs. Brown.",953769600,9,1130,5.016304347826087

The most delightful aspect of the movie  is its timelessness. It was written in 1899, but the plot of political  intrigue, power-grubbing, and a rare, conscientious politician is just as  apt today as it was when it was penned. The light-hearted love story that's  intertwined is just a bonus.",950572800,14,540,4.6421052631578945

1059226,5,6305674116,"Talk about wonderful dialogue. This adaptation of Oscar Wilde's play shimmers with it. The ensemble cast is great; one exception here might be Minnie Driver. Unlike the other performers, who evince their characters  very believably, Driver falls a bit short. Part of it is perhaps her  accent, the rest is the lack of electricity between her and Rupert Everett.  Julianne Moore is exquisite as a conniving, devious member of London  Society, and certainly deserves an award for her performance. She engenders  a reluctant fascination in all the other characters, and you almost wish  for her to win in her schemes. Everett is perfect as the self-absorbed lord  with little occupation.

But that's what An Ideal Husband is, and it shines with something that blockbuster movies are sadly lacking: a plot.  It's  orgin as a play is evident in the fully devolped characters, witty  dialogue, and perfectly timed entrances, exits and near-misses.  The scence  in Lord Goram's house where all the characters are in the wrong place at  the right time particulary demostrates that this was written for the stage.  However, it lends itself incredibly to film, and whoever was in charge of  casting should be commended.  The performances were all superb, especially  Rupert Everett's with his talent for line delivery.  I saw this movie twice  while it was still in theaters, and will doubtlessly see it many more now  that it's avalible on video.",949708800,7,847,4.873239436619718

1059229,4,6305674116,"An Ideal Husband is a serene feast of exquisite language and subtle intrigues.  This comedy of manners by Oscar Wilde has been given its just due in the production starring Rupert Everett, Julianne Moore, Cate  Blanchett, Minnie Driver, and Jeremy Northam.  All of these actors are  excellent in their parts, but Moore and Everett stand out in their roles of  the evil blackmailer with the heart of gold and the shallow ne'er-do-well  whose crafty brilliance saves the day.  It would also be an injustice to  write about the film without mentioning John Wood who plays Everett's  exasperated father.  One might say that his performance is ""over the  top,"" but that is exactly what is needed for the part.  The film  starts very slowly, so you must have patience in order to be rewarded.  I  do not normally suggest that the special features be viewed before watching  the film, but some might be helped in their appreciation of the film by  viewing the featurette included on the DVD for it serves as a worthy  preface for the film.  It is an irony of history that, at the time of  writing this play, Wilde was on his way to his trial for being a homosexual  and offending some of the ""manners"" he so expertly barbed.  Wilde  understood our need to comply with the ""rules"" of society, and  his insights are just as applicable in today's times.
