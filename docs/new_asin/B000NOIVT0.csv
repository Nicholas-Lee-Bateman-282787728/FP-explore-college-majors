2772996,5,B000NOIVT0,"Remember when Westerns held nothing back?  When the characters were REAL, when the dangers were REAL, when you were pressed to the edge of your seat waiting for the next harrowing moments?  ""Seraphim Falls"" is a movie in this tradition, featuring brilliant acting, great cinematography, and super writing.

Gideon, a former Union captain, has headed out west, alone.  The war is three-years gone; he is a wanderer escaping his brutal past.  But he is pursued by Carver, a former Confederate general who has a grudge against Gideon.  What follows is a chase, of sorts--one man pursuing another through the wilderness, approaching a conclusion that, although predictable, is still strangely satisfying.

Pierce Brosnan, as Gideon, gives his the performance of his career, even topping his previous high in ""The Matador.""  Liam Neeson is engaging as always; you can't take your eyes off him.  A super cast, featuring a supporting role from the ever-rivetting Michael Wincott, as well as excellent cameos from other artists, helps keep this movie grounded.  The writing is great--dialogue is sparse and never used simply as filler; the violence is real but never gratuitous--and the cinematography is to die for.  There's nothing extraordinary here, which is why the film soars--it takes pride in being a Western, in being a revenge story, and doesn't waste time in trying to be anything more.  Sure, there are morals to learn from watching this movie, but director/writer David Von Ancken doesn't force them down your throat; he lets you ponder them at your own leasure, when you are finally able to take your eyes away from the screen.  ""Seraphim Falls"" ranks as one of the most engrossing movies I've seen this year; it's easy to watch and hard to forget.  To me, that's what makes a great movie.",1179964800,84,1795,5.02027027027027
2772997,2,B000NOIVT0,"This was a waste of the acting talent of some great actors. The opening sequences and subsequent escape of Brosnans character from the opening scene was indeed memorable, and the filmography stunning, but you're immediately asking the question of 'why does (Neeson) want so desperately to hunt down and kill (Brosnan)?'. This question goes unanswered for the majority of the movie, and once it's made known that the two were former war rivals and an accident takes the life of Neesons family (for which he blames Brosnan), the motivation is unsatisfying. I had absolutely no empathy with Neeson's character, who is apparently hell bent for misplaced revenge over nothing more than bad judgement, not malice. I was left with a feeling of 'that's it?' when trying to understand Neesons motive, and the ending was so anticlimactic as to render this movie utterly forgettable.",1179878400,2,872,5.104895104895105
2772998,1,B000NOIVT0,"I find it hard to find the words to describe this DVD.  Perhaps that is because it offers so little to describe. Some one should tell the writer/director that it takes more than famous names on the marquee to make a successful film.  A good story line would have helped.  It was never made clear as to who was the protagonist and who the antagonist. A good story would not have simply 'plopped' an Indian (Wes Studi) beside a waterhole for no reason, nor would it have 'plopped' an itinerent peddler (Angelica Houston) and her wagon in the middle of the salt flats. Perhaps it was supposed to represent something mystic.  If so, it failed.  All it did was to insult the intelligence of the viewer.  Suspension of disbelief is one thing - but this film had nothing to believe even after disbelief had been suspended.",1179792000,8,815,4.5479452054794525

2773001,4,B000NOIVT0,"Basically a revenge flick set in the West after the Civil War, SERAPHIM FALLS features Liam Neeson and an almost unidentifiable Pierce Brosnan. Apparently Brosnan wronged Neeson earlier and now Neeson is tracking him down to kill him. The two strong male actors dominate SERAPHIM FALLS with the only real female contribution coming from a strange, rather silly, cameo by Anjelica Huston, which causes this reviewer to withdraw a star from the movie's rating.  The film seems to peter out toward the end (another minus) but it is an exciting Western for the first hour or so and worth your time for the good acting and the good cinematography. Enjoy Mr. Brosnans's verbal and visual characterization; a real treat.",1179446400,4,713,4.991596638655462
2773002,4,B000NOIVT0,"Watching Seraphim Falls I'm almost glad that two of the best westerns of the past years were underplayed. Seraphim Falls fits well with the somewhat pretensious but well done The Proposition in being a hard core driven film that reinvigorated the western genre for me. Every so often the western genre seems to flucuate between good films like these or the generic audience pleasing pap like Young Guns or American Outlaws. If thats what the genre could wind up being I'm glad that once every so often a filmmaker makes something like these films.

Seraphim Falls is a story of revenge centering around the pursuit of a former civil war soldier, Gideon by Carver and his group of bountyhunters. In the begining we're not given much to the characters just thrust into the chase between the men with Gideon slowly whittling down Carvers men using anything at his means. There are questions perhaps to if it would be easy to drop a knife dead center between a mans head, or hollow out a horse to hide in but these are minor questions that don't effect the chase. Slowly we come to recognize how much Carver is willing to do in order to kill Gideon who's just as eager at killing to survive. In the end it comes down to Gideons past transgressions that lead Carver on his path of vengeance and what will happen to the men if they can't become more than the violent beings they are.

That sounds rather corny but thats something interesting about the film. Both Gideon and Carver while being portrayed as vicious don't really fit into that villianous archetype. They're deeply flawed men involved in this chase across the American west. In the lines of the film as they're the only ones who come across with any real depth which is good. There are great character actors playing the periphary characters ranging from Ed Lauter to Michael Wincott. But both Liam Neeson and Pierce Brosnan control the screen with their driven performances as the two leads.

This is the first film from David Von Anken, a director I noticed from an episode of The Shield and he does good with the direction not overdoing the film, giving the it a natural feel that makes the action fascinating. And the cinematography from John Toll a great photographer is excellent focusing on beautifully on the landscape.

If the film has a problem its the ending. Its not a bad one, just somewhat more metaphysical than I'd like it to be. It involves characters who seemingly appear out of thin air to offer odd advice and bullets. I won't say no more other than it might put people off to the film. Personally I liked it more than most of the bigger action films I've seen this year, and see it as an easy recommendation.",1179187200,3,2686,4.612970711297071
2773003,4,B000NOIVT0,"Well,who would have thought to use Pierce Brosnan and Liam Neeson as leads in a Western. Full credit to both actors and director for pulling this off. No disrespect to Mr Neeson,who was excellent,but Pierce Brosnan really does a great job and is very believable in what is an unusual part for him. The cinematography is first class and on a par with Jeremiah Johnson. I won't go into the storyline ,not wanting to spoil things and give too much away,but i agree with a previous reviewer,the first 30 mins are truly spellbinding.

If i have a criticism off this film it is that i could not understand the need for Wes Studi,totally wasted,and Anjelica Houston ,or the point of their roles,in this film. A mention too for the very good supporting cast.

All in all,a great effort and i applaud eveybody connected with Seraphim Falls for trying to keep the Western Genre ALIVE.

Well done.

2773030,4,B000NOIVT0,"A little-noticed aspect of this film, though not really that subtle, is the allegory. It starts with the title. Seraphim are angels. That doesn't mean anything, perhaps, until a fallen angel, Louise C. Fair (soundalike for Lucifer), appears out of thin air at the end. Those familiar with the mythology and allegory of the underworld will see allusions to it, and it will give the ending a different sense than it would otherwise have. (Further explanations can be found by googling the title plus ""Louise C. Fair."")

The mythical allegory can be taken to contribute to a more basic allegory of war and violence. How much of value it contributes is debatable. The allegorical aspects become almost comical in their presentation, which tends to undercut any serious point they might have. One reason most viewers miss them is no doubt that the earnest, gritty, realistic portrayal of everything until the last few scenes doesn't prepare one for it.

Like many films that attempt to send a message about violence via an entertaining, even spectacular and beautiful portrayal of it, this one probably does more to give people a taste for and enjoyment of it than to discourage it. (What, for example, do people remember and enjoy most about Ben Hur (1959), ostensibly a film about redemption from hate and violence through Jesus? The violent, revenge-soaked chariot race, of course.)

So, all things considered, maybe it's just as well that people don't notice the allegory. Without it, this is a grim but beautiful, violent western, a personal story, that spins into odd territory at the end.",1473811200,,1590,4.992452830188679

2773044,5,B000NOIVT0,"4 stars really, but the extra star is for effort. First you've got Brosnan AND Neeson in a flick so that's a winner in itself. Second, you get to see Brosnan not playing the part of a spy, hitman, or both, and you get to see Neeson not beating up international troublemakers, though he is doing the revenge thing but it's different enough. You've also got some classic elements of a western, survival epic and then towards the end there is a shift in direction that I won't explain so I don't spoil it. Epic-style nature scapes reinforce it all. I think this is a better film than the Revenant and in the same style but doesn't try to go for as much, which makes it more authentic to me. Still plenty of plot cliches that I won't bother to point out. They will be familiar to you. But how much room is really left for originality in storytelling?",1465257600,,846,4.327044025157233

2773047,3,B000NOIVT0,"Really, this worked out to about a 2.5-7 than a solid 3...but, for argument's sake, 3 it shall be. What I liked: First and foremost, even though it's now some 8 years since the release date, finally being on prime for that long has proven ok.  Yes, I first saw the preview in 1998, and recall placing it on my watchlist, and look! It's only waited 8 years to get there. I'm so pleased my hard earned dollars are paying off for me. Nah, just faking that. So, what I liked? A little. Some of the scenery was top notch, the rest had to be early blue screen. It was ok.  Uh, second- both actors still look pretty good. Pierce a bit more than Liam, but neither one was exactly in poor shape.  So, that was nice. Funny and odd, but still nice was Liam's shaky attempt at a semi-southern accent....who was he kidding? Brosnan's clipped quick-brit was much more refined. Not precisely wordy, but still a nice upper mid accent range. Again, neither one washed out for tone. Finally, I enjoyed the equine populace very much.  At one river scene, although the animal did not enter the water, the scene itself caused me to recall my own history, a+++, of not just riding, but taking my horse for a swim, with a friend on her ride a few feet away. Sports cars may be fun, but swimming on horseback is just a hoot.
Now, and the part I do not enjoy,  sharing what I did not like.  IMO, first: The drag. Deer me, on and on, this weather, then that weather, of course to show that whole ""ends of the earth"" feeling. Pursuing and pursued. I got all that, just why did it take an hour plus, before we even found out why the journey had to be so darn unending.  Geez, snow, rain, sleet, ice, rivers, streams, pools, then puddles. Finally, dry, cracked dirt.  It also seemed as though the clock stopped on the last, long scene....FGS, end it, already.  So, dragging literally, a dead horse of a story. Second:  Plot: It could have worked well, except there were just too many opportunities for these two dudes to end it all. Or was there a point in letting each one outwit for an instant the other, especially in close quarter brawls? The one time one of them caught the other 4-square and solid, in a sensitive body area, wouldn't fell the guy for a couple hours? Naw, just rolled over and sprang to his feet, to land a right cross to his opponent's jaw. Hard enough to deck him, so what gave with their exceptional pain tolerances. I think I know, but it would be nice to miss this:  Yes. Passed more time, nothing else.
Lastly, I did not like the interaction with the 2 mountain kids. Dumb scene, and what was with that boy? Looked like either a love sick cow (?) or a broom.  I'm rather leaning towards the broom.  I can see the stage direction: Young boy stares, empty eyed and slack jawed.  'Bout covered that. Of these, the one which felt the most unfortunate to me was how slow this thing was. (see above).  I could feel my skin aging as I watched.
In conclusion: I honestly can't recommend this film. It's just too outdated, outmoded and outlived.  People, it seems to me, don't tend to favor older-styled films, which place their settings in older-year America. In Europe, good. From them we expect, maybe, medieval.  We should be able to have that.  But in 2016, the world has moved so much more apace with ""blink of an eye"" time-technology. ( It's not always easy to turn from the nuclear blasts.)  E.G., , "" Tim and Laura, with their young son, Todd- have finally crossed the nuclear wasteland of New  York.""  Worse, car crashes, high speed chases, child porX, (UGH!!)- drunken parents...the list is almost unending.  So, audiences now seem to favor the action-packed-computer-generated-spy-vs. spy crap. The older an old western film tries to be, exponentially, the less people of this time-stamp are in watching.  Which is probably why some folks find their niche films from the older selections.  Hobby-films, I think. Works for me.
All in all, this was a film which I thought would need a great deal of attention paid. After about an hour, noting it would run for at least another 56-59 minutes, I half-watched, waiting for something new.  The ironic little walk-ons, like Madame whosits drawing her mares and buggy, were a bit far fetched for me, but that's really the feeling I have for the entire film.  Parts were good, but mostly, the final scene just made me think it was overlong and under played.  Probably could have shortened this film to about 1.4 hrs.  I think it would have been much more interesting.

2773052,4,B000NOIVT0,"I would call this movie a metaphysical thriller in a Western setting (I use ""metaphysical"" loosely!), and it seems to be exploring the nature of masculinity -- maybe just American masculinity, although there isn't a great deal of cultural specificity.  What is specific is the natural setting, and the director, David von Ancken, makes sure that all the four elements get their due weight.  We have the mountains and the plains and the desert, and we have men dependent on beasts -- horses -- and perhaps pretty much reduced to beasts themselves. The question the movie wants us to consider, I think, is the what basic masculine nature is.  The Civil War has robbed the two main characters of their families, so they are now isolated agents in a natural setting, enacting the roles of predator and prey, and the whole movie is basically a chase-movie.  The idea that a man without a family is a destructive agent is very strong, and the idea of the family as the basic civilizing building-block seems to be taken for granted in the screenplay.  Although both men lost their families in the war, Carver, an ex-Confederate officer (Liam Neeson), blames the Yankee Gideon (Pierce Brosnan) for deaths of his family, so he is the pursuer. Gideon is on the run from him, with his main motive being self-preservation pure and simple. Gideon is a very capable man, especially with a knife, and although Carver has hired three men to help him hunt Gideon down, it's no easy task.  The movie runs an hour and forty minutes, which is a long time for a chase, and it's to the credit of all concerned that it holds our attention.  The suspense isn't just a matter of whether or not Carver will catch Gideon but of what they will have to say, if anything, if that happens.  To say that they're taciturn on the journey is an understatement.  That suspense is enough to hold our interest, but the photography, often spectacular, helps.  And what's striking is that although Carver believes himself to have been wronged -- and he HAS been wronged -- our sympathies tend to be drawn to Gideon, not because he makes any excuses for himself and not just because of his resourcefulness, but mainly because he just doesn't come across as a bad man.  Carver isn't bad exactly, but the viewer (at least this viewer) isn't drawn to him.

As the movie goes on, what we began to see as perhaps a rather conventional Western story becomes stranger, and in the course of the pursuit, Carver and Gideon meet a few other people, and they seem to represent possibilities of ways of life to which the chase has blinded Gideon and Carver.  There's a settler family and a band of pilgrims, and they seem plausibly generic, but one realizes that perhaps they aren't when, a little later both men meet a mysterious Indian (Wes Studi) and an itinerant snake-oil saleswoman (Anjelica Huston), both of whom seem to prompt Carver and Gideon to different kinds of self-understanding.  An aura of the supernatural clings to both -- are they visions? or symbols?or ""real'?

 I won't give away the ending.  Suffice it to say that the actors are splendid throughout, and while one hardly is surprised by Neeson, an actor of protean range, one is surprised by Pierce Brosnan, whose character here is one that I would never have imagined him as being able to play convincingly.  My reservation?  It's a bit long -- which is to say it dragged in a couple of places -- but it's an intelligent, well-shot, and well-acted piece of movie making.",1458345600,,3492,4.685761047463175

The opening twenty minutes or so are terrific. These scenes are naturalistic. The characters look and act like you might imagine post-Civil War people would have acted. Then the chase descends the mountains and the verisimilitude likewise descends. In the last half hour the two antagonists run into more and more mystic and supernatural characters. Tom Noonan plays a tall creepy religious leader who acts very oddly. Wes Studi appears as a philosophical Indian. He sits alone in the wilderness by his waterhole. And finally Angelica Huston who appears by magic in the trackless desert. She seems to be a pawn of the devil.

I imagine the writer and producer had some message they wanted to deliver under all the symbolism.",1442016000,,903,4.857142857142857

2773131,5,B000NOIVT0,"Bullets and knives, snow and sand, horse thieves and Lucifer itself all collide in Seraphim Falls, a piece of sheer art where the canvas is the wide open country of the Midwest, the brush the delicate hands of a fine cast, and the result, a stunning and immersive Western for the thinking viewer.

Two men carry the film, and they both have demons in their past. What happened at Seraphim Falls so long ago has destroyed Gideon and Carver. Gideon is played by Pierce Brosnan (in a stunning performance); he's good on his feet and better with a knife, world weary and tired of running. Liam Neeson's (and has he ever been less than amazing?) Carver is tall and craggy, laconic and cold and single-mindedly focused on revenge. Imagine Clint Eastwood's Blondie if he was older, wiser, and had more hurt in his past.

As much a character as Gideon or Carver is the country they inhabit. From the snowy forest peaks to the wider than possible plains, Seraphim Falls is shot with a skill and beauty that would make John Ford tip his hat in respect. Do you like films that make your jaw drop in awe and wonder? Then perhaps the vastness and scale of Seraphim Falls will do that for you.

But don't be fooled. Seraphim Falls ain't casual viewing, or an action or revenge piece. This is a character study of two men and the Wild West. Not the John Wayne cowboys and Injuns Wild West, filled with saloons and gunfights, nor the Clint Eastwood Wild West, where everyone's good, bad, or ugly. Nobody's good, nobody's bad. This is a masterful human portrait of flawed individuals and those they come in contact with: bounty hunters, homesteaders, thieving pilgrims, Irish railroad builders, and perhaps something supernatural thrown in there (look out for Angelica Huston's delicious cameo).

So if you're a fan of thoughtful, violent, real, powerful oldschool Westerns, character pieces, or just some good ol-fashioned cinema, pick up a copy of this criminally underrated masterpiece of the Western genre. You will not regret it.",1416960000,3,2017,4.804034582132565

2773176,4,B000NOIVT0,"Opening and closing in cinemas almost without leaving a trace, Seraphim Falls did nothing to help revive the western's big screen fortunes, but despite some problems it's an enthralling manhunt movie that deserved a lot more attention than it got. It doesn't waste time getting things moving - no sooner has Pierce Brosnan started a fire to warm himself in the snowbound mountain country than Liam Neeson and his private posse are shooting at him, triggering an initially near wordless man hunt that will lead its protagonists across some spectacular country to a final confrontation in a barren desert, the ghosts of the Civil War briefly invoked en route. It doesn't reinvent the wheel, opting for the kind of genre staples that haven't had much of an outing over the past few decades, and doing them surprisingly well and, thanks to John Toll's magnificent cinematography, with an incredible feel for its ever-changing landscape that surprisingly few Western directors since Anthony Mann have ever been able to exploit. It's gripping stuff, the pitstops along the way - remote farms, railroad camps, wagon trains - offering memorable vignettes for the likes of Tom Noonan, Shannon Zeller and Kevin J. O'Connor.

Unfortunately it takes an ill-advised excursion in spiritual allegorical territory in the finale, first with the appearance of Wes Studi's top-hatted Charon figure collecting his payment on the shores of a dead sea of sand and Anjelica Huston's diabolical peddler. The latter is not quite enough to derail the film but it does throw in an unwelcome wobble that the film really doesn't need, hammering home what the film has much more effectively left unsaid up until then. Even before that there is, unfortunately, one absurdly contrived moment when Neeson first gets Brosnan in his sights and allows him to escape with ridiculous ease because it's too early to end the picture, while Neeson's motivation and bitterness aren't hard to guess at long before the secret is revealed. Yet despite those flaws the film's more than good enough and entertaining enough to have deserved a wider release and more attention than it actually got, and it's nice to see Ed Lauter back on the big screen and hear Michael Wincott growling away as Neeson's hired guns. On this evidence, co-writer-director David Von Ancken might well be one to watch in the future

Both the US DVD and Icon's UK region-free Blu-ray have few extras  - just an audio commentary by Von Ancken, Brosnan and production designer Michael Hanan and a standard making of documentary - but (unlike the UK DVD) are both in the correct 2.35:1 widescreen ratio, and this film uses the Scope format so well that it's well worth seeing it as it was intended.",1374796800,2,2724,4.9824175824175825

The dialogue is kept to a precious/delightful minimum and cinematography deliberate and well-paced; no jumping from scene to scene....

There are traces of Outlaw Josey Wales and likely a much richer story than can be detected.  As much as I like having to figure out things, this one was a little too vague.  The actors both did well.

I love this movie because it does not clog up the sound waves with unnecessary dialogue and noise, rather it uses the silence and few words that are spoken to set the tone. When this movie starts, all you know is that one man (Brosnan) is being chased by another man (Neeson) and his hired posse. You don't know why Brosnan is being chased, but this chase is the entire stage of the movie.

This chase starts in the snowy mountains and eventually makes its way to different areas. This is another area where I found this movie is particularly strong. It paints a very complex world that is easy to be interested in, while not getting very involved in it. The camera shots are often wide and far out to capture the mountains and valleys, and if I am not mistaken the directing cameraman had won several awards prior to this movie (it is obvious why!). There were several moments that made this movie my favorite (spoilers!), and overall this movie is the best western I have seen in a long, long time!

I don't think you can really go wrong with this movie! I only recommend avoiding it if you do not enjoy story based movies (in favor of shoot em' ups westerns etc).",1339200000,6,1409,4.4324324324324325

Nevertheless, there is much to compensate for those flaws, not least the acting of both stars and supporting cast, and, apart from the ending, it's easy to banish them to a level just below that of conscious awareness and allow them to drift away.

Essentially, it's a chase and revenge movie set against a backdrop of sumptuous scenery and majestic skies; Neeson, in company with four `employees', doggedly pursues Brosnan across frozen mountainous wastes and parchment dry deserts and, on several occasions, comes close to seizing and dispatching his quarry for reasons, not forthcoming until we approach the end.  Along the way, we meet various ancillary characters that add a bit of spice to what might otherwise have been a somewhat one dimensional narrative.

As others have mentioned, it is quite slow paced for a chase movie but I didn't find it any less tense for that and felt the pace a perfect match for the vastness of the country across which the pursuit took place.",1338422400,3,1142,4.811224489795919

The story and the script just get ridiculous. First of all, I like a good artsy film but it has to make some kind of sense. This movie does not. Second, I think if you are going to get abstract, you need to have some idea of where you are leading people with your abstractions. This movie smacks of having no point other than being abstract, and that means BAD SCRIPT.

They keep you in the dark about why this man is pursuing another man to the death for a long time, and when they finally do explain it with a clumsy flashback, the flashback is a corny, sentimental disappointment which could have been better done by a grade school class play.

2773214,4,B000NOIVT0,"Both Pierce Brosnan and Liam Neeson have been putting in superb performances in their last few movies, and the first pairing of them in ""Seraphim Falls"" is proof that both are now genuine class acts - only getting better with age and skill. Brosnan is a revelation in Seraphim Falls (as he was in ""The Matador"" and ""The Ghost"") just as Neeson was in ""Batman Returns"", ""Kingdom Of Heaven"", ""Taken"" and especially his Oscar-winning turn in ""Kinsey"".  In their latter years, each has acquired a grizzly realism that is serving them both well and their choices in movies.

The story is fairly simple - two ex Civil War soldiers of varying rank are locked into a Frontier manhunt in 1868. The relentless pursuance takes them from the snowy slopes of Ruby Mountain down through freezing rivers and into open pilgrim-filled ranges. It continues through homesteads and finally to a desert area that in many ways resembles both of them - arid, empty, drained and dry. Brosnan is the hunted and Neeson the pursuer, but we only find out as the movie slowly moves on, `why' Neeson's character Carver is so obsessed with hunting Brosnan's character Gideon. And not just killing him either - but making him bleed and hurt as much as possible (dialogue above). It's essentially a cowboy chase movie, but done with such style and intelligence, that it grips you for the first hour like a Terminator that just won't stop. The support cast is all uniformly excellent too, but it's the two leads that hold it together.

The cinematography is spectacular and the look and dialogue just right. But it's let down as some reviewers have quite rightly pointed out by an odd last twenty minutes - in many ways it spoils the great journey you just made with these two essentially good men locked into the horrible aftermath of war. Very old fashioned in ways, but hugely enjoyable - I'm reminded of ""Jeremiah Johnson"" from 1971 with Robert Redford and ""Black Robe"" from 1991 by director Bruce Beresford - two fantastic frontier `story' films that are rarely seen, but worth every second of your time seeking them out.

The BLU RAY is now a relative pittance on Amazon - which is some kind of bargain on a format that isn't exactly chockers with them. As you can imagine the image is superb and adds a great deal to your enjoyment of the movie. The BLU RAY also carries over the short but informative ""Making Of"" from the original DVD issue - it has interviews with all the principal leads - clearly enjoying themselves and drawn by a good script and great locations. There's an audio commentary with Pierce and Director David Von Ancken and Production Designer Michael Hanan. Subtitles are in English for the Hard-Of-Hearing only. But it's the driving story and picture quality that will keep you coming back.

Having sat through some truly appalling films of late, ""Seraphim Falls"" was like a breath of fresh air to me - and I wish I'd seen at the movies.

2773218,2,B000NOIVT0,"Seraphim Falls has one of the most intense, action-packed, awesome openening sequences ever seen. A bearded Americanized Pierce Brosnan is in the mountains trying to start a fire when he is shot by an unseen sniper. He runs away, rolls down a mountain, falls in a river, goes down a waterfall, climbs on the shore and does self-surgery on the bullet wound while trying to ward off hypothermia, all while being chased by Liam Neeson and his hired bounty hunters. That all happens in the first 10 minutes or so. Outstanding openening sequence.

From there the movie gets really repetitive. Liam Neeson chases Pierce Brosnan while Brosnan keeps killing Neeson's hired hands. Over and over and over. When you finally find out WHY Neeson is chasing Brosnan, it is somehow less-than-satisfying. This movie has virtually no plot, a severe lack of character development, and the most bizarre ending of any western I have ever seen. A movie that starts with gritty violent realism enters the realm of tale tale.

But I have to hand one thing to the actors: You feel their pain. When you fall down the side of a mountain you don't get back up and run away. You limp painfully. Brosnan and Neeson make their injuries look and feel real. If you are a fan of Neeson, Brosnan, or Westerns, then I recommend seeing this movie once.

Plenty of action, thrills and western scenery, but it all comes down to who Gideon and Carver are, how they got that way, and why their pursuer and pursued.

2773225,1,B000NOIVT0,"""Seaphim Falls"" is two films. The first part takes place in the mountains and savannahs and the second part takes place in the desert. Part 1 is a mystery. Liam Neeson and 4 other men are trying to kill trapper Pierce Brosnan. Everyone does a terrific job acting and the photography is stunning.

Part 2 is just plain silly. Wes Studi embarrasses himself as an existential Indian and Angelica Houston makes us forget that she actually won an Academy Award by playing a snake oil saleswoman from hell. Even the plot suffers in this half of the film (e.g., how do the hunters loose the bullets that are in their belts?)

There are some really good performances here by lots of people in little tiny roles. Shannon Zeller (the little girl who rescues Brosnan), Nate Mooney (the former soldier who recognizes Brosnan), Jimmi Simpson (the bank robber), Ed Lauter (the bounty hunter who is stranded), and Xander Berkeley (the railroad foreman) all stand out.

This film has been compared to ""The Outlaw Josey Wales."" NOT. Though both films deal with the aftermath of the Civil War, that's about the only similarities between the two films.

Pierce Brosnan is alright as Captain Gideon, though I've never been a big fan of his acting. Liam Neeson, as always, turns in a fantastic performance as Colonel Carver, a man seeking vengeance on Gideon for the death of his family. The supporting cast, overall, does a fine job. Anjelica Huston, a fine actress, shows up at the end, playing a character that shows up out of nowhere, in the already-mentioned awkward and disappointing ending.

2773266,4,B000NOIVT0,"A film of two halves, but with a somewhat uncomfortable join.
This movie starts off with one of the most gritty and riveting hunts in recent memory.  Pierce Brosnan's weatherbeaten and hardened ex Union officer is the hunted one, and Liam Neeson is the hunter, driven remorselessly by the ghosts of his past.  The cold of the mountains, the pain of using a knife to gouge out a bullet and cauterize the wound, the chill of the water, the close quarters kills with the knife, all make for a visceral start with minimal dialogue and little explanation.  Each man is completely single minded - one on survival, and one on revenge.  As the chase moves onto the plains, we discover more about their past and the reason for the chase, marking a change in tone of the movie.  As the plains give way to the desert, the movie takes an altogether more mythical and almost surreal mood, which is sure to divide audiences.  Those expecting an action packed climax to the chase may feel cheated,  however what we do get is at the very least thought provoking and I think lingers in the memory much more than a conventional showdown would have.
The director borrows heavily from the greats - the revenge themes of many a spaghetti Western, with the repeated flashbacks revealing a little more each time we see them reminiscent of Leone, also Ford's `The Searchers', as well as the atmosphere of Eastwood's Westerns.  Borrowed the styles may be, but they are put together with a unique voice and vision, albeit in a somewhat hollow way in which the director too often substitutes myth and images for true drama.  But what startling images they are! The photography is beautiful, whether it is the stark beauty of the mountains and snow, or the green of the plains or the arid expanses of the desert, and the images of the men facing off, or Angelica Huston in the desert, will stick with you.
The musical score to the movie is surprisingly restrained, but is a perfect accompaniment to the story - at first minimalist and somber in minor keys, reflecting the movies tone of survival and single mindedness, then the score switches to something more traditional as it enters the plains and the sphere of a traditional Western, and finally becomes wistful and dreamlike in the final stages.  It's imaginative and subtle, always in the background and never grabbing your attention, but adding immensely to the tone and feel of the movie, almost like another character.
It is the final third of the movie which feels just a little longer than it should, with some ideas dragged out, and with changes of tone which leave the viewer almost feeling like he is being asked to start a new movie.  What helps keep the viewer hooked are the leads, who are terrific, the two Irishman fitting into a Western with great assurance.  Brosnan in particular makes the most of a very physical role, with much more subtlety than we might expect.  Otherwise, a strong supporting cast of character actors is great to watch but frankly is given little of substance to do.
This is a flawed film, to be sure - but nonetheless it achieves what great cinema is supposed to - it stirs the emotions, and makes you think.  Recommended.",1225411200,5,3189,4.671428571428572
2773267,4,B000NOIVT0,"Essentially a chase story, SERAPHIM FALLS is a fine, action-filled, gritty western in the classic tradition.

When we first see Pierce Brosnan, he's a lone figure atop the snow covered Ruby Mountains, warming himself at a campfire.  Suddenly, two shots ring out, one of which hits him in the arm.  Pierce can only run, sliding down the mountainside; ultimately falling into an icy rushing river and being swept over a steep waterfall.

His pursuer is Liam Neeson who, with his hired guns, has been after Brosnan for years.  We don't learn his reason until late in the film which begins in the mountains and winds up in a parched desert.

Co-written (with Abby Everett Jaques) and directed by David Von Ancken, Seraphim Falls is beautifully photographed by John Toll, and co-stars Anjelica Huston, Michael Wincott, Ed Lauter and Wes Studi.

My only problem with the film was Ms. Huston's role which, since it changes the tone of the story, would have worked better had it been introduced earlier in the picture.

The DVD from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment features audio commentary by Brosnan, the director and production designer, plus an in-depth ""Making of"" featurette.

2773268,1,B000NOIVT0,Disappointing. With star power like this - Liam Neeson and Pierce Brosnan - I was expecting much more. Very slow and pointless. Purchased this because of the stars and the cover art and was very disappointed.,1223942400,5,208,4.805555555555555
2773269,5,B000NOIVT0,i stumbled across this western gem in the local movie rental store. i gave it a try and was pleasantly surprised. this movie has some star power and different approaches then a lot of westerns. i like brosnan's use of his bowie knife. the ending can be a little bit of a challenge to accept but not all that disappointing. all in all i think this movie is unique in such an established genre. i'd recommend this flick to any action/western movie fan.,1215648000,4,450,4.433734939759036
2773270,1,B000NOIVT0,This film had good potential in the beginning but went nowhere fast.  The story was week and the editing was poor.  Pierce Brosnan's acting was exceptional but not enough to carry this trainwreck of a movie.,1208822400,4,207,4.722222222222222
2773271,4,B000NOIVT0,"Both Pierce Brosnan and Liam Neeson have been putting in superb performances in their last few movies, and the first pairing of them in ""Seraphim Falls"" is proof that both are now genuine class acts - only getting better with age and skill. Brosnan is a revelation in Seraphim Falls (as he was in 'The Matador') just as Neeson was in 'Batman Returns', 'Kingdom Of Heaven', and especially his Oscar-winning turn in 'Kinsey'.  In their latter years, each has acquired a grizzly realism that is serving them both well and their choices in movies.

The story is fairly simple - two ex Civil War Sergeants are locked into a Frontier manhunt in 1863 - the manhunt takes them from the snowy mountain ranges, down through freezing rivers and into open pilgrim-filled ranges, through homesteads and finally to a desert area that in many ways resembles both of them - arid, empty, drained and dry. Brosnan is the hunted and Neeson the pursuer, but we only find out as the movie slowly moves on, `why' Neeson is so obsessed with hunting Brosnan's character Gideon - and not just killing him either - but making him bleed and hurt as much as possible. It's essentially a cowboy chase movie, but done with such style and intelligence, that it grips you for the first hour like a Terminator that just won't stop. The support cast are all uniformly excellent too, but it's the two leads that hold it together.

The cinematography is spectacular and the look and dialogue given to both leads, just right. It's let down though as some reviewers have rightly pointed out by an odd last twenty minutes that in many ways spoils the great journey you just made with these two essentially good men locked into the horrible aftermath of war.

Very old fashioned in ways, but hugely enjoyable - I'm reminded of ""Jeremiah Johnson"" from 1971 with Robert Redford and ""Black Robe"" from 1991 by director Bruce Beresford (""Tender Mercies"" and ""Breaker Morant"") - two fantastic frontier `story' films that are rarely seen, but worth every second of your time seeking them out.

Having sat through some truly appalling films of late, ""Seraphim Falls"" was like a breath of fresh air to me - and I wish I'd seen it at the movies. Recommended.",1208217600,,2208,4.709844559585492

Some great scenes that will have you on the edge of your sit.

2773287,3,B000NOIVT0,"Seraphim Falls is a quality western that is a throwback to the many excellent westerns that came out of the 1950s and 1960s.  In the Ruby Moutain range in 1867, a man named Gideon sits atop a snow-capped mountain by a small fire.  Then, a shot rings out, hitting him in his left arm, followed by another shot that just misses him.  Gideon is able to escape with a posse close behind on his trail.  A man named Carver leads a group of five gunhands in pursuit of Gideon across snow covered mountains and dry as dust desert and salt flats.  It is not until late in the movie we learn why Carver tracks Gideon down so mercilessly in a haunting flashback, maybe the best part of the movie.  The plot line is pretty simple, two stripped down men, one chasing the other, doing whatever it costs to stay alive.  Because you don't know till near the end why Carver is tracking Gideon, it makes the chase all that much more interesting, we WANT to know what drives the man.  It's a pretty straight forward western with a strong cast, beautiful New Mexico cinematography, and enough action to keep fans happy.  Not a great western, but with westerns so few and far between these days, enjoy this entertaining revenge/chase movie.

  Looking at the cast, it's kind of funny that two Irish actors are the stars in this American western, but both Liam Neeson and Pierce Brosnan are very strong in their parts.  Neeson plays Carver, the leader of a small posse who hunts down Brosnan's Gideon no matter what it takes or who tries to stop him.  Carver is cold-blooded, but when you discover what drives him, it all comes together.  Brosnan is fantastic as Gideon, stealing this movie in my opinion.  Most of his scenes are Brosnan by himself which makes his role even better.  He can only rely on himself with a posse closing in behind him.  Michael Wincott leads the rest of the posse as Hayes, a hired gun just trying to make some money, Ed Lauter as Parsons, a gunhand looking for some easier money, John Robinson as The Kid, a young man trying to prove himself, and Robert Baker as Pope, an ex-Confederate soldier.  The rest of the cast is primarily cameos, Angie Harmon makes a brief appearance as Carver's wife, Rose, but the best cameo goes to Angelica Houston, playing Madame Louise Fair, a woman who mysteriously appears in the desert to help both Gideon and Carver.  Is she the devil or something else? I think the devil, but it's up to you to decide.

  The DVD has some good special features to go along with the widescreen presentation of the movie.  This is a case where the movie needs to be seen in widescreen to fully appreciate the New Mexico scenery.  The special features include an 18-minute behinds the scenes look at the making of the movie with some excellent interviews with Brosnan, Neeson, and the cast and crew, and also an entertaining commentary with Brosnan, director David Von Ancken and production designer Michael Hanan.  It's a worthwhile DVD for a quality western with a good cast.  If you're a fan of westerns, or even if you're not, give Seraphim Falls a try!",1195516800,6,3082,4.556363636363637
2773288,4,B000NOIVT0,"Cowboy pictures, horse operas, shoot 'em ups - whatever you prefer to label them there is no denying they make for compelling cinema. I've long been an ardent enthusiast of them, as it's difficult not to be if you enjoy beautiful cinematography, engaging characters, and plenty of insight into the truly dark, cold recesses of human nature.

From the genre's very inception, the 1903 film aptly named ""The Great Train Robbery, to the excellent 2007 remake of ""3:10 to Yuma, there have been thousands of threads in the tapestry we know as the western. One of the more recent entries is ""Seraphim Falls"", a thematically poor but cinematically brilliant revenge film. With Liam Neeson and Pierce Brosnan as the two leads (as the Carver the hunter and Gideon the hunted respectively), you already know you're in for some great acting.

Despite having a moderately paced and quite exciting opening hour to the film, the plot begins to crumble amidst a barrage of derivative scenes and simply ridiculous actions. Brosnan's character emerging from within the carcass of a horse to surprise his adversaries has got to be one of the more absurd ""Hollywoodisms"" I've witnessed this year.

There is a scene, which was probably one of the more expensive to film, which succintly details what Gideon did in his past to spark such ire within Carver. It only serves to deflate the mystery surrounding their feud and comes as a huge disappointment. The fascination you're filled with during the beginning of the film turns into the pedestrian ""you killed my family, now I must kill you"" deal. The film would have been much more powerful and intriguing had they opted to leave any sort of explanation out.

Further, the appearance of Angelica Huston at the end of the film may be a bit too bizarre and surreal for some, as she is evidently intended to be symbolic of the devil. After her dealings with Neeson and Brosnan, in which she trades items with them, the climax is rendered effectively unavailing due to the hackneyed ""you kill me"" ""no, you kill ME"" conclusion.

All told, however, I enjoyed this film and it held my attention 'till the bitter finale. A worthy rental choice, and for classicist Western fans, a definite addition to your personal cinema library.

Dialogue 6/10
The speech is sparse and rough, much as it should be, but some lines are nausea-inducing with their empty machismo. An example being: ""You can't protect anyone in this life, son, the sooner you get that the better."" spoken by Carver.

Cinematography 8/10
This is perhaps the finest aspect of the film, as it's beautifully framed and diligently shot. Though it is a little jarring how the landscape suddently changes from snowy to barren in mid-chase.

Acting 9/10
Neeson and Brosnan are both first-rate actors, and perform brilliantly despite a couple of scenes guaranteed to make you roll your eyes (most notably the ""horse carcass ambush"" scene).",1195084800,2,2916,4.900608519269777
2773289,5,B000NOIVT0,"The superb landscapes that work out as big frame for the dramatic human chase, along miles of cold mountains, wild rivers and snowy mountains will lead us to an unexpected final in which we will realize the painful backgrounds that led to this man to undertake a search of three years. The rest of the plot runs for you:

Pierce Brosnan has grown up as actor to unexpected levels; his abrupt dialogues with his ferrous hunter - Liam Neeson in a mesmerizing performance - are unforgettable. There's an underlying tribute to a fabulous film of Erik von Satroheim ""Greed"" in the final sequence.

""Seraphim Falls"" is a powerful allegation against the thirst of vengeance,but also a heartfelt tribute to John Ford.",1194566400,4,709,4.851239669421488

Neeson and Brosnan lose their irish accents and engage themselves into this western. You can not fault them for the weird ending of the film

One of the extras on this disk is an audio commentary track with the writer, the director and Brosnan. Brosnan in the audio track says the ending is surreal..so if he can say it, i can say it!

2773293,2,B000NOIVT0,"Seraphim Falls is a movie about revenge.  Although the movie starts out strong it goes south in the later parts when we lose the realistic, earth-bound and basic nature of the story to spin into an ending that strikes as being very out of line with the rest of the tale.  That isn't saying what was done with the ending is bad, it isn't, it just doesn't belong in a movie where everything has been so basic and shallow up until the end and then the sudden change comes on too heavy.

To try and sum it up without giving away anything (don't worry, this movie doesn't hold any surprises though) you have Brosnan as ""Gideon"" an ex-union officer fleeing from something he took part in that he can't let go of.  Pursuing Brosnan is Neeson as ""Carver"" a confederate officer who hates Brosnan with a passion and is leading a posse to kill him, obviously over the aforementioned event that plagues Brosnan.

The movie opens well and cranks up the action and suspense but slows back down and never regains that momentum again.  As the story unfolds we find that both Brosnan and Neeson are at their core unlikeable fellows (despite the story trying to tell us that Neeson was a lovable family-man once we find it hard to believe that a man that treats the people around him this way now could have once cared about anyone).  The movie is very predictable, as it should be, cat and mouse stuff, though Brosnan is extremely capable of defending himself though he rarely chooses to stand and fight.  Given their nature, the limited script and the declining action the movie does start to drag on and when the ending arrives it has an overdue feeling to it.  Ultimately the two are given the option to sacrifice everything for a last shot at revenge and the remainder of the movie is open to interpretation but I found it to be a bit unsatisfying.",1188172800,4,1835,4.503012048192771

For the genre, it fullfilled all the senses. But just as you're riding along with the main character (Brosnan), you're feeling for him, you're rooting for him, and you're hoping he gets the best of his fierce enemy (Neeson), but you find out that maybe he's getting exactly what he deserves. He did a very, bad, ugly thing, and now you're not sure who to root for. This could have been a great movie, except for that one, final flaw toward the climax. Regardless, you will be entertained.

2773295,4,B000NOIVT0,"This was a very well done story an element of ""Josey Wales"" with, near the end, a bit of the surreal elements of ""Dead Man"".  Pierce Brosnan finally got a role he could really sink his teeth into, though not one of my favourite actors, in films of real drama and scope (more so than the Bond films) is where his true talent and ability shines, he was fantastic.  My favourite actors in the film are Wes Studi and Michael Wincott which was what initially drew my interest in it and I do wish Wes Studi had gotten a more significant part.  Wes like Michael Wincott are highly underrated actors which is a shame seeing how extroardinarily talented they are.
This film presented a great story of revenge and redemption and needs to be seen a couple of times to be fully appreciated.  The action was thrilling, the scenery was beautiful and the acting first rate.  Not alot of films of this quality of story telling are out these days.",1186185600,5,930,4.447058823529412
2773306,4,B000NOIVT0,"`Seraphim Falls' has all the elements of the archetypal Western you'd expect.  If the movie didn't have any expletives and it weren't so keenly edited, you'd swear you were watching an old movie.

Taking place just after The Civil War, Confederate Col. Carver (Liam Neeson) has an ax to grind against his former rival, Union Officer Gideon (Pierce Brosnan).  Taking a few men with him, he bears down on Gideon chasing him in the dead of winter through the unforgiving mountainous terrain of the West.  With transgressions that only unfold later, the two men fiercely hold their own in a chase that both sides win on the merits of ingenuity alone.  Encountering people one might expect:  A log cabin family, Irish immigrants, an elixir saleswoman, and revival people; the results, nevertheless, are not.

One particularly distinctive scene shows Gideon frozen, bleeding, and out of breath.  A departure from vintage Westerns, we really see his ordeal as he numbly, yet urgently builds a fire, removes a bullet, and cauterizes a wound that only leaves a trail of blood.  It's done so believably that we can't help but feel his agony.

With great performances by both Neeson and Brosnan, 'Seraphim Falls' is one compelling Western ride.  The palpable vengeance is convincing, and the chase brings considerable tension throughout.  Even containing familiar elements, the variations are often done in a startlingly different way.",1185926400,20,1424,5.143478260869565

Brosnan has been good in most everything I have ever seen him in. Liam Neeson is also an accomplished actor. This was clearly their poorest effort ever. However, they did the best they could on this horse dropping.

Bad writing makes for a bad movie. This was some dimwit's idea of a sophisticated character piece searching endlessly for a point.

I don't know where Brosnan's character was going when chased by Neeson. Heck, I don't even know what happened to either one of them at the end. In fact, the movie was so bad, I don't even care.

Several horses died in the movie. From the script, it would appear they died of thirst. In reality, they were just bored too.

I love a great Western. I even love a poor Western. This is somewhere way below that.

If you want to see Pierce Brosnan, grab a Bond film. It is much more sophisticated fare than this. If you want to see Liam Neeson speaking American slang, purchase a copy of ""Next of Kin."" Whatever you choose will be more entertaining and thoughtful than ""Seraphim Falls.""

After that the movie became so ridiculously unreasonable that I felt extremely bored. Especially, when Carver relentlessly tried to chased down Gideon again and again and again even after he was spared from death many times by Gideon. Their fighting scenes looked ridiculously fake.

2773312,3,B000NOIVT0,"This is an interesting and watchable movie, well acted and photographed.
It has a basic story line that strongly borrows from ""The Outlaw Josey Wales"", but the screenplay contains enough variations on the hunter vs. hunted theme to mark it as a different film from Eastwood's.

My only real complaint about it is that it begins strongly , in a realistic fashion, continues in this manner through most of its length, but then begins to unwind into something mystical and surreal as the end approaches. Basically, it starts to get weird. It's like the director decided to take a side trip through the Twilight Zone to reach his end credits.

It could be argued that the desert conclusion puts the two adversaries (Brosnan and Neeson) in a situation where the intense heat and lack of water makes them hallucinate and see and hear things wrongly: perceptions askew. Maybe. But the fact remains that from Wes Studi's appearance onward this movie starts going a bit wonky. And is the Angelica Huston character actually there at all? Is ""she"" real? Or is ""she"" the Devil? You almost feel the production is taking on a Rod Serling morality play form...wrapped in metaphor...there at the end.

""Seraphim Falls"" left this reviewer largely unsatisfied with its ending. but mostly pleased with the 85% of it preceeding that.

Gideon (Brosnan) and Carver (Neeson) are both unlikeable characters, and the actors play their roles with phony Western overstatement. Brosnan is so unbelievable as his character, it is laughable.

The plot is a grinding, plodding, so-what sort of scenario in which Gideon and Carver are supposed to encounter some intersting folks along their journey and end up in a climactic face-off with each other (yawn).  The only things they come across are foolish actors struggling through poorly written parts, including Anjelica Huston who shows up out of nowhere in the desert in a nonsensical cameo.

Written by Abby Everett Jaques and David Von Ancken and directed by Von Ancken, ""Seraphim Falls"" is a rough, tough, old-fashioned western set on the dusty plains and snow-covered mountains of western Nevada.  The plot is little more than a straightforward revenge tale involving Liam Neeson (sans Southern accent) as a sadistic Rebel army colonel who hires a posse to track down the marauding Union officer he believes slaughtered his family in the days following the Civil War.  The officer, played with steely-eyed determination by Pierce Brosnan, is a savvy, quick-on-the-draw survivalist who, through sheer ingenuity and skill, stymies and outwits the colonel and his men at every turn.

What ""Seraphim Falls"" lacks in substance, it more than makes up for in grit and style.  For even though there isn't a great deal of depth to the characters, there's much pleasure to be derived from merely watching two actors of the caliber of Neeson and Brosnan squaring off in a grueling game of cat-and-mouse played out in a punishing, unforgiving landscape.  Brosnan's character achieves an almost Superman-like quality as he stays one step ahead of his pursuers, devising ever-more elaborate means of ensnaring them in his traps.  The movie takes a decidedly metaphysical turn in its closing stretches, with the divine Anjelica Huston, no less, appearing out of nowhere as a desert apparition to set the boys straight on a few eternal verities like redemption and forgiveness.  But it is as a simple tale of vengeance and obsession that ""Seraphim Falls"" most captures our imagination and interest.",1182902400,10,1601,5.178294573643411
2773327,4,B000NOIVT0,"Terrific performances by Pierce Brosnan and Liam Neeson raise Seraphim Falls to near classic status among films of the western genre.  Driven by the will to survive and unrelenting vengeance, these two veteran actors completely discard their personas as screen heroes and battle each other through snowy mountains, unforgiving parched deserts, and an unmerciful high plains landscape to see who can kill each other first.  Neeson and his henchmen are the pursuers and Brosnan is the pursued, who both play out their drama of savagery in a surprisingly labyrinthine plot guaranteed to keep the viewer perched on the seat's edge.  What drives Neeson so compellingly to want to do away with Brosnan?  The audience finally discovers the existence of a brutal incident that happened in the shared past of the two men.  Long ago, the incident became a searing fire stoking Neeson's wrath.  The film has a well-conceived ending offering a strong message about the folly and self-devastation resulting from all-consuming vengeance and savagery.  Against this grim plotline, the movie offers some of the most stunning cinematography imaginable.  Comparable to ""Shane"" in its beauty.  A film to see!!!",1182816000,6,1191,5.292553191489362
2773328,4,B000NOIVT0,"Any film with an opening half hour as great as this may inevitably seem like a let down when it draws to a close.  Still, this is the best new Western in years.  Liam's accent is a little off, but Pierce delivers an outstanding, almost animalistic performance.  This should have been a hit.",1182643200,9,290,4.433962264150943
2773329,4,B000NOIVT0,"I'm not particularly a fan of the Western genre, but I am a fan of actor Liam Neeson, which is why I gave this film a try. I'm glad I did. The scenery is outstanding and just gorgeous to look at. Both of the lead actors, Neeson and Pierce Brosnan are very good. I've always thought of Brosnan as kind of a pretty boy, but not in this movie. In fact, it's even a bit hard to recognise him. The viewer can't help but pull for Brosnan's character as the hunted man. However, when we finally learn what exactly happened to put Neesons' character on his quest for revenge, we fully understand his actions and he emerges as much more sympathetic, whether or not you believe his actions are justified. I also thought it was interesting the way the director went from hard reality to scenes toward the end that were almost surreal, specifically the Native American at the stream and the lady trader who just happens to be traveling across the desert at exactly the right time to put the final events into motion. I don't know where this movie ranks in terms of great Western films, but I certainly enjoyed it.",1182124800,7,1101,4.428571428571429
2773330,5,B000NOIVT0,"This movie really deserves 10 stars! Awesome scenery and fantastic directing/writing. Gideon (Pierce Brosnan) is a formidable foe for Carver (Liam Neeson), a man seeking revenge three years after the Civil War. 'War is Hell' is an understatement in this story of two men with emotional scars from the war and everything it has taken from them struggling to just keep going. Unable to put their pasts behind, they take their hatred and anger out on one another. The intensity of the action is constant as Gideon runs for his life, adept at killing anyone intending harm if they get too close to him. Both men leave a trail of blood. How much will they spill before putting an end to their personal war?

2773332,4,B000NOIVT0,"Very enjoyable for western buffs.  Both Neeson and Brosnan were equals in performance and effort.  Some well known faces in some very small secondary roles were interesting, but, really didn't add much to the overall story.  This reminded me alot of the chase movie Charles Bronsan and Lee Marvin did several decades ago.  Nice to see a western actually filmed in the states instead of Canada for a change.  The ending was probably too predicatable, but, then anything else might have been wrong.",1181260800,2,496,4.927710843373494

2773334,3,B000NOIVT0,"""Seraphim Falls"" works very well as a western because of the contrasting lead characters--Col. Carver (Neeson)obsessed with revenge trapped in the past and his own pain while Captain Gideon (Pierce Brosnan)wants nothing more than to escape his past. He isolates himself in the wilderness working as a trapper in post-Civil War America almost as if it's his penance for an act in the past. Gideon was instrumental in a horrible tragedy that killed Carver's family. Carver hunts Gideon like he's nothing more than a wily animal. Gideon plays the part proving that even though he has isolated himself from people, he hasn't forgotten or lost the small remains of his soul. Gideon rediscovers the value of life--any life even someone else who hates him while Carver discovers that the need for revenge can eat away our reason for living.

""Seraphim Falls"" isn't a perfect film but it is one of the better westerns that has been released in some time (although it can't hold a candle to ""Open Range""). Because director/writer David Von Ancken focuses on the demons that drive these men, his film is admirable and entertaining. Both actors working with a great supporting cast do a terrific job of creating their characters with a minimal of dialogue particularly during the first third of the film. While the film falls apart by the conclusion and runs about 15 minutes too long, it's still enjoyable ride through the high country.

The DVD features an interesting and trivia packed commentary track by Pierce Brosnan and writer/director Von Ancken aided by roduction designer Michael Hanan. We get the usual trivia about the difficulties in shooting the film but also bits of history as well that make it informative and fun.

The featurette provides a solid look behind-the-scenes. I was surprised that a film this low key (it barefuly got a theatrical release probably because of Mel Gibson's involvement and his drunken rant. Icon Productions co-produced the film and I don't doubt that it made Sony gun shy about promoting this film in a higher profile fashion). The DVD transfer looks nearly perfect.

""Seraphim Falls"" recalls some of the character driven westerns that we saw during the 60's and 70's. Writer/director Von Ancken (who wrote it with Abby Everett Jaques)sketches in these characters worn lives and the deeds that made them weary of living very well. Both Brosnan and Neeson do terrific jobs in their roles making the most of their minimal dialogue creating much of their characters out of their physical actions and reactions as what they say. Like ""The Proposition"" (another fine Aussie western), ""Seraphim Falls"" shows us the price of war and following orders on the individual from both sides of the fence.

2773335,3,B000NOIVT0,"SERAPHIM FALLS is an odd film, one that on the surface appears to be an homage to the old Westerns, but proves to be a psychological battle for survival between two men engulfed in revenge.  There is very little story to relate: Carver (Liam Neeson) with a small posse of bounty hunters (Michael Wincott, Ed Lauter, John Robinson and Robert Baker) treks Gideon (Pierce Brosnan) through snow, forests, mountains, rough water, and desert over a Civil Ear seed of hate.  The 'story' fades to a philosophical stance (somewhat clumsily) by the intervention of some ghostly creatures (Anjelica Huston, et al) and ends without much more than a whisper of a memory about the futility of revenge.

Bronson and Neeson do well with their scant dialogue, revealing more of their character's minds with physical action and the power of facial expressions.  The mood of the film is in the superior hands of cinematographer John Toll and Harry Gregson-Williams' musical score. Director David Von Ancken keeps the tension at peak level even though the film is desperately in need of editing (just under two long hours in length).  But for a diversion and an appreciation for the wilderness of America in the mid-nineteenth century, SERAPHIM FALLS  is a visually satisfying experience.

2773357,1,B000NOIVT0,"Overdone in the beginning, just plain silly at the end.  The only Western cliche' the director did not abuse was the bison stampede.

2773358,4,B000NOIVT0,"I knew nothing of this film but it looked interesting.  I thought that it was not particularly memorable at first but on thinking about it the next day I realized that I was wrong.

The ending - an interpetation
SPOILER ALERT! . . .
The appearance of Angelica Huston in the middle of the desert really seemed utterly ridiculous until (the next day) I realized that she was the angle of death.  She took everything they had (water, horses, life? etc.) and offered them the chance for revenge.  The seemingly stupid moment when they get up and walk away (after barly able to walk and Liam shot) really is the death of both.  It took a while but it made sense after a day, lol.  In any event it was interesting (although a bit monotemous during the middle of the movie due to the largly uninteresting chase.  BTW, how could Brosnan (on foot) stay ahead of Neeson on a horse for so long?).  I would have given this a 3 star rating if I had not interpeted the ending the next day.  In any event, it's interesting to think about and it's beautifully filmed.",1180828800,14,1051,4.376288659793815
2773359,1,B000NOIVT0,"This movie sounded interesting, and I am a fan of both actors...but for me...I suffered all the way through this bleak film that I thought would never end.

2773360,4,B000NOIVT0,"The movie does not aim high, except, maybe, in the last act. For its genre it is very good. It is a very good ""chase"" movie. Brosnan flees from Neeson and his hired thugs. The movie only explains Neeson's motives for revenge when it reaches almost to the end. The movie is better when you didn't know the entire story. Guessing why Neesan wanted Brosnan captured and not killed keeps the tension in the story line. The beginning and the middle of the movie are very good. The movie has two very tough and smart antagonists making tough choices. I was entertained. The flashback sequence explaining the revenge motive doesn't has the same quality as the rest of the movie. It was one big misunderstanding? Another sequence with Angelica Huston doesn't quite fit either. The ending is a slight disappointment, but on the whole I found the movie exciting.

The movie is much like the first Rambo or Death Hunt; it is better than those two. Neeson and Brosnan bring pretty good acting chops to the movie. The plot is more interesting than the other two, with more interesting characters and scenery. The movie moves from high mountains to the desert so it has a lot of variety.",1180569600,4,1173,4.639423076923077

2773363,3,B000NOIVT0,"I read no reviews,saw no trailers and was prompted by no one to view this film. This was a random rental based on my desire to see a fresh western. Storylines involving people being pursued for vague reasons naturally draw a persons interest, particularly mine. So, at the onset of the movie I was engrossed in a realisticly gritty chase that had me patting myself on the back for good selection. Pierce Brosnan is probably at his best. All those years of playing the affluent, swaggering cool man type is put to rest to our benefit. He seemed to be emulating Marlon Brando at times(vocally), but its a step in the right direction.

  Liam Neeson held his own but needs to brush up on the old west. I was strongly engaged in the film when this sudden attempt at moral lessons and twilight zone staging took place. Nothing wrong with artistic license when you do it right. The film had none of those afformentioned elements up until it was looking for an ending and boom, weirdness. Im writing this as if you've seen the movie, which is wrong, but I was surprised to see how many people watched and reviewed it. I dropped this disc into my Hd player with surprising results. It really enhanced the great naturalistic footage.  Im not really sure what the fimmakers were aiming at with the mysterious lady, or what they expected the viewer to make of it, but it wasn't profound. Nice audio helped it along. Almost a keeper. I may pick it up again just for a few excellent scenes that depicted accurate strides at human survival.",1180137600,4,1526,4.5583941605839415

Otherwise, it's a grand Western in the strong old style.  Well worth watching and purchasing if you are a fan of Western movies.",1180137600,4,411,4.561643835616438

Interesting but much too long. And it's looooong. Oh - and it has the token mystical Native American and kooky-looking preacher, so it's Hollywood-safe.",1180051200,,464,4.7407407407407405
