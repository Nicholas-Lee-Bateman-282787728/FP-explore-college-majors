2525944,1,B000EOTVGG,"This was the most bizarre movie I have encountered in a long time. It was a flash back to my youth and Military in particular. It was the ancient indoctrination film on the evils and dangers of all life encounters. Don't drink you'll become a drunk and crash, Don't have sex you will get VD, Don't smoke it will destroy your health and make you look nasty instead of cool.

In fact all those things we fund out later were probably true--but we didn't need a preachy film telling us.",1402012800,,482,4.355555555555555

2525949,2,B000EOTVGG,"... that's what they used to call this type of film in my youth, some seven decades ago. Hollywood was anxious to break the code, and they tried to treat more ""sophisticated"" material, but they forbidden in showing too much  violence or flesh. The plot is routine, the acting is poor and the direction is mostly ""Let's point the camera there."" Furgettiaboutit.",1392681600,3,360,4.806451612903226

2525951,1,B000EOTVGG,"I love pre-code movies as they tended to be more realistic than much of the stuff that followed until the 60s. However, these two films are little more than exploitation films and tepid ones at that. To give you an idea how little I regarded this dvd, I threw it away with nary a second thought. As I can find something interesting in even mediocre pre-codes, not choosing to keep this disc or pass it on to someone else speaks volumes.",1381881600,3,436,4.395061728395062
2525952,4,B000EOTVGG,"The Road to Ruin must have shocked audiences of its day although in 2013 the events are hardly unheard of and happen openly just about every day. While the film entertained me and is a good example of the type of morality tale Hollywood produced at the time, I can tell this was made on a shoestring budget. For example, the walls of interior sets are obviously just painted and not real at all; and the acting by some of the characters (like Dorothy Davenport as Mrs. Merrill) is sometimes comparatively stilted. Nevertheless, the plot held my interest even though I knew where things were probably going; and the film has its historic value as a something produced to teach audiences what ""decent"" behavior was and show what horrifying things can happen to someone pure who falls in with the wrong crowd.

At the start of the film, we meet Ann Dixon (Helen Foster) and her friend Eve Monroe (Nell O'Day) leaving high school just as the school day was over--and it isn't long before Ann accepts Tommy's (Glen Boles) invitation to let him and his fast-crowd buddies take her home. Naturally, one thing leads to another--Eve teaches Ann how to smoke, drink--and then try more than just tobacco. Ann also gets romantically involved with Tommy but the results have Ann ambivalent, to say the least.

But of course things get worse for Ann; yet I won't tell you everything so you can watch this film and experience it as I did! Suffice it to say that Ann gets involved with a much older man (Paul Page as Ralph Bennett) who unbeknownst to Ann runs around with many young women just to score notches on his belt. Meanwhile, there is a racy, almost nude swim party that gets Ann, Eve and the whole gang in trouble with the police! The rest of the film shows what happens to Ann as everything plays out.

Look also for Virginia True Boardman who does a pretty good job of playing Ann's mother and Richard Tucker plays Ann's father rather well. Robert Quirk plays Ed and Jimmy Tolson has a nice cameo as a nightclub singer.

Overall, this is not the best film I've ever seen; but it's an excellent example of the kind of film Hollywood produced at the time to teach morality tales--good people like Ann can go with the wrong crowd and pay a terrible price for it. I recommend this for fans of this genre of film; anyone who likes Helen Foster; Nell O'Day; Glen Boles and/or Paul Page, who should not have been forgotten, will want this film for their collections.",1360972800,13,2455,4.547511312217194
2525953,5,B000EOTVGG,"""The Road to Ruin"" is a surprisingly glossy movie with excellent production values, photography, background, etc. It stars the long-forgotten Helen Foster who plays her role of the doomed virgin with a strange, flat squinty-eyed expression. The poor thing is led down the path of destruction and ends up dying--but you're never sure the cause.  In the big climax, there's a midnight swimming party where everyone wears bathing suits. Yet, they're all arrested for having a ""nude"" swim.

The performer who really steals this movie, though, is Helen Foster's girl friend, the radiant Nell O'Day. She's the one with the sparkle and charisma who should have been the star of this long forgotten effort.

What's interesting is that while this movie so terribly bland and never shows anything remotely forbidden, the big studios were also turning out some delightfully risque movies that showed a hell of a lot more. There was the Barbara Stanwyck scorcher, ""Baby Face,"" Clara Bow in the outrageous ""Call Her Savage,"" and all those other scorchers that starred Constance Bennett, Kay Francis and helen Twelvetrees.

Still this movie is a fascinating antique that promises all these naughty themes--yet, is so safe and sanitized that a child could watch this and probably fall fast asleep.",1237766400,12,1282,5.149038461538462
2525964,1,B000EOTVGG,"fairly predictable B movie attempting to scare teens and others into the straight and narrow of no pre-marital sex and no alcohol.  slow and badly acted, but then again, it was the 30's and people needed jobs.  I can't blame the actors for being in the film, but you can question whether the movie should have been made at all.  Certainly, the advertising on the cover is misleading, but then, again, it was the 30's and the mores were significantly different.  Viewed in that context, the adults only warning is both appropriate for the times (better to create interest) and ironic in that the adults don't need to see this, but, if you subscribe to the raison d'etre of the film, their audience really should be the teens they wish to dissuade from participating in 'bad' and 'socially unacceptable' behavior.",1436400000,,811,4.771428571428571

8112385,5,B000EOTVGG,"ROAD TO RUIN (1934) is about typical 35 year old high school students, in a typical neighborhood, on a typical planet. Poor Anne Dixon (Helen Foster) doesn't know the sort of kids w/ whom she's getting mixed up. After school, instead of studying studiously, these hepcats are dancing to the latest devil jazz, whooping it up like the heathens they are! When Anne spends the night at Eve Monroe's (Nell O'Day) house, all hades breaks loose! While her mother drinks good, wholesome alcohol w/ friends, Eve introduces Anne to untoward, romance stories. When mom and company depart for the evening, Eve pours Anne a martini and lights up a cigarette! This is only the beginning. Within seconds, Anne is on cloud nine! The next day, she accepts a ride home from school. From a BOY, named Tommy! We can almost hear Jesus cry! Soon, Anne is drinking and smoking semi-regularly, hanging out by the lake w/ those up-to-no-good ""friends"" of hers! They even go canoeing! The lust-demon flaps his wings over them, causing reprobate behavior. Anne, of course, ends up crying like the guilty sinner she's become! Before long, Anne's out w/ ""the gang"", dancing far too close, at rustic ""lodges"", while crooners croon their lilting songs of Satan, Oh, but it's the devil jazz that reminds these kids of their h-o-r-m-o-n-e-s, sending them into fits of dancing that only savages could enjoy! In no time, men in tuxedos (we know how they are) move in, quickly introducing Anne to their dark world of darkness! Tommy's been replaced by Ralph, and Anne's running w/ a faster crowd now! Ralph gives Anne narcotic drinks, sending her into a state of wanton abandon! Oh! Surely, Beelzebub is afoot! The next night, Anne's old friends are dancing the hully-gully, at Brad's big bash, where Eve shows her knees! There's also dice playing! For money! And clothing! Great heavenly days! Could these people sink any closer to perdition?! The answer is yes, as they all strip down to their birthday suits and go cavorting in the swimming pool! Without shame! Topless men and women! Together! A police raid takes place, and everyone is taken to the pokey! Still, without shame! Anne and Eve are examined by a doctor, and both are determined to be ""sex delinquents""! Now the shame arrives! Adding to this tragedy, Anne finds out that she's ""in the family way"". Ralph convinces Anne to compound her sinfulness, taking her to a certain physician he knows, for a ""procedure""! And the last state of this poor girl is worse than the first! Obviously, Anne is doomed. Her life is over. Let us not do as she has done. Let us live upright, sexless lives, free of soul-darning intoxicants! Listen to mom! She knows best!...",1500940800,,2683,4.809523809523809
