Between the Mom who spends weeks in the hospital for a broken leg (which somehow leaves her unable to feed herself! ), horrible ""war scenes"" of a dad in combat who is MIA but miraculously found when the president decides he needs to be home to see his son's soccer game, and a creepy neighbor who is practically holding the star of the movie captive,  it's just awful. Acting is horrible. I've never reviewed a movie before but had to do something after enduring this movie if for no other reason than to prevent other parents from making the same mistake and getting this movie.

I mean ok, it's a kids film and I got it for my soccer loving boys but even my 5 year old thought it was ridiculous at times. It feels like a few has been actors got together and made a whole movie in 1 and a half day. Then they made the director to promise to never say cut. Just record whatever comes out on a first take and call it good, and pocket wathever money comes out of this. The writting, well they might have as well just come up with some BS on scene as they were recording.

7177345,3,B00XPX1HF6,"Golden Shoes is a Dove-approved film in the family category, and you know what that means: go for the heart, or head for the pulpit. Films in this genre are usually heavy handed and don't trust the audience to get the message, so subtlety isn't a hallmark. Plotting is usually as the crow flies, as direct (and often contrived) as can be. Characters are either good or bad, because the modern-day family movie is an update of the old medieval morality plays. And since the object of a feel-good movie is to make you feel good, theres more than a little melodrama and emotion for emotions sake. Contrivance? No matter, as long as it offers a plotting shortcut or makes you feel something.

Golden Shoes has all of the shortcomings of the genre. It also, surprisingly, has a few recognizable name actors to help shoulder the burden. John Rhys-Davieswho narrates Once Upon a Time and appeared in dozens of big films, including The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, Bond film The Living Daylights, and Raiders of the Lost Arkturns up as a mentor-of-sorts to young Christian (Christian Koza), who dreams of becoming a soccer star but only sits on the bench of his youth-league team. Dom DeLuises son, David, is a coach that seems too nice, even for a youth league. Montel Williams has a bit part, as does Vivica A. Fox, and Eric Roberts (The Dark Knight) gets the most air time as the boys next-door neighbor, who is by turns lecherous, helpful, crusty, self-absorbed, and just plain contemptuous.

Roberts comes on to Christians mother, and yet hes listed on the contact list at school so when Mom gets in an accident, hes the responsible adult whos called to take Christian to the hospital to see his mother and then take him in while shes recuperating. Heres where this Cinderella story takes a Cinderella turn. Frank has no wife that we can see, but two sons who aren't very good soccer players but whom Dad pushes the coach to play more. Christian gets to bunk in the basement, and is locked in that basement when a big game comes up, with Frank no doubt trying to increase the odds of his boys getting more playing time at the big dance. Instead of glass slippers, its golden shoes that Frank buys him, thinking they're the cheapest reject shoes he can get his new stepson.

Like many family films, this one is a low-budget indie. But I have no quarrel with the production values. Many a decent indie film has limped along with low-budget audio and video and still finished strong. The biggest problem viewers will have with Golden Shoes is the plausibility, especially if they're into youth soccer. First of all, its not likely at all for a single player to sit on the bench game after game. More than one? Sure. But any coach worth his whistle would have found a way to rotate in that last player without inflicting too much damage on the final score . . . or the kids psyche. And if you knew this kids dad was serving in Afghanistan and MIA, wouldnt you try extra hard to give him some playing time? And no matter how rotten a neighbor you were, wouldnt you take the kid in your custody to see his mom in the hospital more than once?

Even more far-fetched is that these games, which appear to be played, like so many across America, on a small field with just a few parents watching, suddenly start to snowball to where, after Christian is inserted and becomes a star, they're competing in a play-off game in a big stadium and the President of the United States is learning about this kid and orchestrating a rescue mission to bring his father home in time to see him play his big game. Ive coached youth soccer and Ive seen a lot of terrific players, but Ive never seen a youth soccer player make newspaper headlines and TV newscasts, as happens here. And the whole idea of a big-venue game, ala Hoosiers, is just absurd.

Its fair to say that writer-director Lance Kawas got a little carried away. I would have been happier had he stayed with a smaller story, because while the acting isn't going to win any awards, 12-year-old Koza is likable enough as Christian, and despite the fact that Roberts is all over the map as Frank, hes still as mesmerizing as a train wreck in slow motion. This movie isn't perfect, but I remember it weeks after seeing it, which isn't always the case.

I had the chance to do a phone interveiw with Christian Koza, who got into the business after three months of lessons, and he said that he has played soccer since he was three years old, and that he was as much of a goal-scorer as his character. Some of it I could curve the balls. Maybe half, but some of it was CGI, he said, adding that most of the kids who played soccer on camera were extras in a real league.

Koza said it was fascinating watching Eric Roberts get into character, adding that the only time he actually saw him in a good mood (i.e., not in character) was with his dad on set. What drew Christian to the story was the fact that his character was bullied, and when I asked him whether hed want a girlfriend in the sequel thats in pre-production he said, simply, No. As in real life, he said hed rather just concentrate on school and soccer. On the set, he said that he bonded with the young actor who played the goalie and that the two of them would always talk and eat and play X-Box. His favorite X-Box games? All the sports games . . . . I don't like the violent games, he said.

Now thats the kind of honesty Id prefer in the sequel, rather than a trumped-up world-stage scenario. Keep it simple. Focus on the kids and kid problems. It is, after all, a family movie.",1444608000,,5593,4.444444444444445
7177346,4,B00XPX1HF6,"My eight-year old was excited to watch this movie since it had soccer in it. He sat down to watch it while I was busy and enjoyed it so much, we both had to watch it a second time.  I admit that I was a little taken back by the language on this film being that it's a DOVE endorsed film.  I really didn't find it necessary to throw a few choice words in there since this is a children's movie.

As far as the acting goes, I think it's very typical of a children's film.  It's low-budget but it does deliver a good message, despite the language.

7177347,4,B00XPX1HF6,"Have you heard about Golden Shoes? It's a new feel good movie released on DVD and On Demand on October 6 packed full of talent as well as heart! This Dove-family-approved movie is the story of Christian, an eight year old boy who lives and breathes soccer. He wants to be like the professional soccer player like his idol, Christiano Ronaldo. Christian believes in his heart and soul, that he can be the best soccer player in the USA and play for the National Youth team. But first, he must overcome the impossible.

Christian's dad is on active duty in Afghanistan and they haven't heard from him in months. Christian's mom is doing the best she can, working long hours and struggling to take her son to soccer practice. She tells Christian he can be whatever he wants to be.  For some reason their neighbor, Frank, has a chip on his shoulder and is blackmailing the coach to put his twin boys on the playing field more than Christian. As a result, Christian's athletic abilities are suffering. Instead of catching a break, Christian's life gets more difficult when his mother is bed-ridden in the hospital as a result of a car accident, Frank is the guy in charge of Christian and he is forced to live in Frank's basement until his mother recuperates.

He doesn't want to spend any of his own money on this boy he doesn't like. The neighbor takes Christian to get new shoes for soccer, asking that Christian be provided with old, dirty, free shoes. when Christian gets his muddy old soccer shoes, he can suddenly play like a pro and leads his team to victory after victory! Christian becomes an inspiration to his teammates as well and even talks one of his teammates out of fighting.

This movie is compared similarly to the likes of Rudy meets Bend It Like Beckham. It is full of emotion and twists, and will get the audience all rooting for the child star who may just inspire us all. The Golden Shoes soccer movie features an all-star cast including Eric Roberts, John Rhys-Davies, David DeLuise, Vivica A.

7177349,4,B00XPX1HF6,"Thank you MPRM Communications for sending us this DVD to review!

While my kids and I were not necessarily looking forward to watching a sports related movie, we're all glad we gave it a shot.  Golden Shoes is about an eight year old boy named Christian Larou who lives and breathes soccer.  He wants to be like the professional footballer Christiano Ronaldo.  Christian's dad is on active duty in Afghanistan and his mother is working long hours and struggles taking her son to soccer practice.
For some reason their neighbor, Frank, has a chip on his shoulder and is blackmailing the coach to put his twin boys on the playing field more than Christian. As a result, Christian's athletic abilities are suffering.  Instead of catching a break, Christian's life gets more difficult when his mother is bed-ridden in the hospital for a while.  Since Christian has no relatives and his dad is MIA, he is forced to live in Frank's basement until his mother recuperates.

Much like Cinderella, Christian is treated very poorly compared to Frank's sons and is given some golden soccer shoes that unlock his hidden talent that propels his team into the play-offs.  Not only does Christian become an inspiration to his teammates, he becomes a local hero that attracts the attention of talent scouts, and even the president of the United States.

As inspiring as this story is, it does falter a bit morally.  I like how Christian obeys his mom's advice by succeeding instead of taking revenge on those who mistreat him.  There is one (poorly acted) scene where Christian talks a teammate out of getting into a fist fight.  While those are great lessons for my kids to learn, I was disappointed by the language they were subjected to in this Dove endorsed film.  Besides hell, my kids got to hear the worse form of ""Dang it"" and S.O.B. pronounced in its entirety.

If it wasn't for the language, I would encourage families to watch it without hesitation.  While it has a good message and story, it's not a big budget film and it shows at times.  The acting talent is pretty good and includes Eric Roberts, Montel Williams, and John Rhys-Davies.  In the end, Golden Shoes is worth renting and can be added to your DVD collection for less than $10 on Amazon.",1444089600,2,2245,4.7153846153846155
7177350,4,B00XPX1HF6,"The 411 by Maria:

This isn't just a movie about soccer but about:

  War and the folks left waiting at home
  Bullying, by kids and adults
  Economics
  Emergency Lists, always have people who will have your child's best interest at heart on the list.
  Nurses and how patients couldn't get through their hospital stay without them
  Perserverance
  American Pride and how it takes one feel good story for a nation to stand together
  Local Sport Teams and how important they are to their community
  Jealousy
  Remembering that everyone has a story
  A Mother's Love
  AND More

In Golden Shoes a boy and his mom are waiting for word on his dad who is away fighting in Afghanistan. They haven't heard from him for months but mom is doing the best she can to keep the home fire burning and being both mom and dad to her son 8 year old Christian.

Christian wants to play soccer like his idol Cristiano Ronaldo. He watches him play and wishes he could play just like him. His mom tells him he can be whatever he wants to be.

When she is injured in a car accident the person on the Emergency List, a neighbor played by Eric Roberts who is a single dad with two boys on Christian's soccer team is the guy in charge of Christian.

He brings Christian to get new ""boots"". Well, old, dirty, free ""boots"" is what he asks for. He doesn't want to spend any of his money on this boy he doesn't like.  Montel Williams plays the shoes guy and he gives Christian some muddy old soccer ""boots"". Christian can suddenly play like a pro and leads his team to victory after victory, getting front page news and local media coverage which catches the eye of Washington. The President swears to find this boys father and send him home!

What I loved most is wow...there are a lot of actors in this movie. Check them out here

This is a feel good movie except when you literally want to punch Eric Roberts in the face. He is so mean. This little boy's father is away and his mother is in a hospital but this guy has this kid sleeping in the basement and tries to steal his shoes every chance he gets which will also have his son's team losing. I don't get it. There was really no reason for him to be mean other than he is raising kids alone.

The other neighbor played by John Rhys Davis who starts out being crotchety ends up being Christian's ""angel"". I love that.

Great ending!

7177366,1,B00XPX1HF6,"Golden Shoes tells the inspiring story of young Christian, a boy whose military father is MIA overseas and whose mother has an unnatural fear of crutches and must therefore stay in the hospital for a really long time nursing a broken leg.  But it was probably a really serious break because it drove the nurse to tears.  You'd think nurses see broken legs often enough, so this break must have been way worse than usual.  Meanwhile, young Christian stays with his next door neighbor Eric Roberts, a mean sociopath who makes the boy sleep on a cot in his basement and only feeds him an occasional hamburger.  Sociopath neighbor is willing to drive the young boy to a sporting goods store but is too cheap to buy shoes, so he asks Montel Williams to give the boy some free soccer shoes wink wink.  Montel obliges because he just happens to have a pair of muddy used soccer shoes on hand.  The mud gradually wears off and we gradually learn that the shoes possess magical power - they make young Christian a fantastic soccer player while also making opposing players terrible and causing them to slide to the turf when they come anywhere near Christian.  Along the way, Christian teaches his chubby friend the goalie how to deal with food issues and the two forge a unique friendship.  Christian scores several goals during each succeeding game, which of course garners the attention of none other than the president of the United States.  Mr. President sends some special ops forces into a foreign hot spot to extract Christian's dad, because it isn't every day a youth soccer league participant can score 2 or 3 points per game and he doesn't want Christian's dad to miss it.  Those are the kinds of situations where the commander in chief has no choice but to risk multiple lives and national security.  And, of course, the president is also moved by the fact that Christian's mom is still battling her crippling fear of crutches which would otherwise have allowed her to return home weeks earlier.  The day of the big game, Eric Roberts leaves Cinderella, er I mean Christian, locked in the basement.  Fortunately, the crotchety old foul-mouthed Irish (or maybe Scottish) neighbor hears Christian's cries for help and breaks him out of the basement.  Turns out the crotchety old neighbor was once a soccer star, but injuries ended his soccer career way to soon and set him on a downward path of gardening and profanity.  The story ends with Christian, his mother, and his father all reunited at the big game, where Christian leads the team to victory.  The emphatic feel-good message of the movie is cemented in the final scene: if your neighbor is a jerk, leave your kid in his stead for months but punch him out once your leg heals up.",1457049600,5,2738,4.684759916492693

The basic them is well used:  kid is the underdog in a sports team, through some special event he/she suddenly plays magically, there is an obstacle to overcome and then, in the end, our hero proves that he/she can play great without the assistance of whatever magic made it possible in the first place.
Same here.  Our young protagonist gets some magic ""golden"" soccer shoes and is suddenly playing like Pele.  But, oh dear God... this went wrong in so many ways.  The acting form adults to children is wooden and terrible.  The parent who funds the team is portrayed as almost impossibly evil for no reason ever explained (because his kids got less play time?  really?  Is that why you lock the hero in the basement?)  The coach is nice enough, but for some reason not only won't let our young hero play, but doesn't even let him practice!  Sure.  That's what soccer is really like.
But, even the soccer playing is terrible.  I know they're supposed to be kids, but I've watched many, many kids soccer games and the playing here was terrible by any measure.  And, they're supposed to be a champion team.

We rented this, thinking the boys at home, who all play or have played team soccer for years, would enjoy it.  Our youngest, who loves soccer, and who is the same age and even the same name as the boy in the move, was really looking forward to watching it.  He thought it was a really ""cheesy"" and dumb movie.  His 12 and 14 yr old brothers agreed. Even the background music was really bad - like from the 80s Hallmark movies - ""cheesy"" really is the only word here. Don't get me wrong, I'm a sucker for feel-good movies.  It's just that this one was so poorly done, it was impossible to even buy into the story.  The music was just the beginning.  The acting is really bad, and they did things that made it impossible to ""suspend your disbelief.""  Here's one example, of many, little things that are just so stupid, they are completely distracting.  At one point, someone feels that the boy needs new soccer shoes, because it implies that the ""old"" ones are, well, old, or something.  So, the kid is in the shoe store and, since the creepy and mean old man that is temporarily caring for the boy told the salesman he wanted cheap shoes, the salesman brings about a crappy old beat up pair of shoes, caked in mud (and even the mud looked horribly fake), and the boy takes off his shoes, which were perfectly good, new-looking soccer cleats, to try them on.  This was one of the many moments the poor story-writing gets in the way of just flowing with the movie.  All of a sudden, everyone in our living room, says, ""What? Why does this kid need new shoes?  And why would he trade his super cool ones for these crappy old dirty ones??""  And speaking of the creepy, mean old guy that is watching the kid, we, the parents in the room, were scratching our heads with the question of why this very loving mother would ask this horrible person to watch her kid for her while she recovers in the hospital for days?  And, the only unpredictable thing about the ending was that, when the boy made the wining score, neither parents were there to witness it because they were finally reunited on the way to the game and spent too much time saying hello.  Sorry about any spoilers, but I'm telling you, just renting or buying the movie to begin with would spoil your 2 hrs. enough already. It was a total waste.

8716458,3,B00XPX1HF6,"I watched this film because I love Vivica A. Fox. It is a clean, family film about overcoming obstacles. A little boy named Christian learns how to improve his soccer  game. His father is away in the military and he has to deal with a difficult neighbor played by Eric Roberts. Roberts is good as a likable yet, irritating character. Fox plays an important role as a kind, nurse who helps Christians mother. This film could've used a little more humor but it delivers as a feel good sports film about the value of determination and family. Add a star if your children play soccer or sports. Recommended for fans of clean, family sports films.",1492300800,,642,4.582608695652174
