As an avid movie buff and big fan of Johnny Depp, I really loved this interview.  The lecture theatre (Actor's Studio auditorium) was packed full of eager students seeking some wisdom from this young master and the secrets of his success. As well, there was a huge crowd at the door who could not get into the studio.  It was one of the most sought after interviews in Actor's Studio history.

I have enjoyed many episodes of Inside the Actors Studio but this was one of my favourites (alongside Mia Farrow and Jessica Lange).

My favourite part of the interviews are always the concluding questions, ""when you go to heaven and God welcomes you at the gate, what would you want him to say?""

Understandably, the interview time imposes restraints on the number of movies covered and importantly working with a young Leonardo Di Caprio.  Also question time from the audience was limited.

Otherwise, excellent ****",1200787200,3,1103,5.642424242424243

It's a great piece to add to your Johnny Depp collection, as it lets you see him upclose and personal - and answering great questions with clever answers.

2752745,5,B000N2HDJQ,"As a fan of Johnny Depp and of the show, Inside the Actors Studio, I was interested in seeing this episode. Mr. Depp was one of the better selections for a DVD this show. (Robin Williams was another!) I was impressed that he actually names several books on acting that the students recognized. No seat of his pants actor, Johnny Depp talks about how he ""finds"" his characters and it's interesting stuff. He also talks about how he got into acting (everyone knows that story now, but it's nice to hear it from the ""horse's mouth""). I've lent the DVD out to a friend and she hasn't returned it yet! It's worth the look.",1198540800,5,617,4.421052631578948

Depp finally sat down with James Lipton in 2002 for an episode of Inside the Actors Studio. It seems rather odd that he would get a career perspective so early in his life, but he has assembled an impressive resume which this show skims broadly over. Depp talks about how he got into music, joined a band and how this led to his first acting gig in A Nightmare on Elm Street. Unfortunately, Lipton skips over Depp's pivotal role in Cry-Baby and instead delves into his first collaboration with Tim Burton with Edward Scissorhands.

Depp also talks about how he got the role in Ed Wood and how he approached the character as well as what influenced his performance: a mix of Ronald Reagan, the Tin Man and Casey Kasem. Thankfully, they cover Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas and talk about how he got involved in the project and how he lived with Hunter S. Thompson in order to portray him accurately. Sadly, some of his other films, like Dead Man and The Ninth Gate, aren't discussed leaving you wanting for more. This is certainly not a comprehensive profile but rather a primer on Depp's life and career.",1196208000,23,2347,6.49520766773163

2752759,5,B000N2HDJQ,"I'm going to tell you a deep, dark secret: I think my roommate Keith looks and sounds like Johnny Depp. I think that's why I like him so much.

I am totally in love with Johnny Depp. I am irrational about him. He's not just a pretty face (although Goddess knows he is that), but he's smart and wise and sensitive and . . . OK, like I said, I'm irrational about him.

So maybe this extended interview by and for the Actor's Studio impressed me more than it would someone who is not gaga over the man, if there is such a person. He talks frankly about his career, the roles he has played, and a good bit about his private life as well. He is that charming rebel that women cannot help loving, and lots of men too. There are clips from his movies, but since this was done in 2002, they don't include some of his best roles.",1336867200,,820,4.086956521739131

2752761,4,B000N2HDJQ,"As a fan and a collector of the work of Johnny Depp I had to have this interview.
We see J. Depp in the peron of him self with his own laughter.
They talk about some of the most famous movie and why he chose some of the strangest characters he has played. And his own way to play them, what he think of...and so on
J.Depp talk about his way in to acting and His vision of himself as an actor.
I loved it, wish it was longer but it is only one interview.
If you are a fan or just want to know more about a actor that don't give so many interview about him self. This is your chance.
The interview contains some surprises (the best way). We meet J. Depp in the best view from his cigarillos to his old boots.

This is such a cool interview & Johnny is very open & honest about his background,certain movies,& lots of other things..even talks to the audience & takes questions from film school students about techniques & other things.

2752766,5,B000N2HDJQ,"Johnny Depp is amazing when he is in character for a movie; he is equally amazing when he is being himself.  I found the interview totally interesting and informative.  Johnny's honest and down to earth responses were refreshing and at times quite amusing. This is a great addition to my Johnny Depp dvd collection, which up till now were his movies, now I have Johnny Depp himself in my collection as well.  I highly recommend this dvd to all his fans or to anyone who is interested in the art of acting.",1210464000,,505,4.467391304347826
2752767,5,B000N2HDJQ,This is a must-have for the Johnny Depp lover.  Johnny doesn't do very many interviews so this is a real treat.  Provides a little more insight into who Johnny Depp really is...I really enjoyed it.,1205107200,,197,4.6
2752768,4,B000N2HDJQ,"Overall, a nice piece, but I almost wish it had been extended to 2 hours like the Robin Williams or Tom Hanks interviews.  Very little was said about ""Chocolat""--the first time Depp took on a true leading man role in a film--""Gilbert Grape"" and ""Benny & Joon"" were only briefly touched on, and not a word was mentioned of Depp's roles in ""Blow"" or the Jack the Ripper flick, ""From Hell"", both of which are impressive pieces of work...probably more so than ""Sleepy Hollow"" or even ""Ed Wood"". It's obvious from the Q&A with the students that Depp talked about his time living with real gypsies prior to making ""The Man Who Cried,"" but this discussion with Lipton did not make it into the final edit for some reason.  I know from accounts of the taping that the overall interview was about 3 hours (with the Q&A lasting another hour before Dean Lipton chided the students that they really needed to let Depp go home) and it would have been really nice to see more of that than 1 hour it was reduced to.  Nevertheless, it's a fascinating glimpse into processes and and inner thoughts of one of the finest actors of our modern age.

A part of me wishes IAS hadn't interviewed Depp until a couple of years ago so we could hear his thoughts on the sudden (though well-deserved) turn in his fortunes, going from being box-office poison to blockbuster superstar and what it's like to finally be appreciated for his work, even if he hasn't changed the way he goes about choosing roles and making them his own. ;)",1202688000,17,1502,4.511029411764706

8174079,4,B000N2HDJQ,Enjoyed the interview.  Johnny Depp doesn't often give in depth interviews.  This was even less in depth than was hoped for.  Always a Johnny fan!

8174082,5,B000N2HDJQ,"I saw the episode from Inside the Actors Studio with Johnny Depp in 2002 and, having seen plenty of celebrity interviews for many years, thought it was maybe the best interview ever.

Seeing it again 15 years later, my sentiment still rings true, and I still remember a lot of the spontaneous, but always interesting, answers that Johnny Depp came up with. There are many reasons why he is a unique star, and it's all markedly evident on that stage for 50 minutes. Of course, the interview is not particularly deep as I had hoped for, even failing to touch on What's Eating Gilbert Grape, but it's by far the most charming and funniest ever.

The ending is a weird one, coming from Johnny's mouth, because he had sold himself out when he went mainstream, having agreed to do the Pirates movies, and was no longer involved with quirky low-budget independent pictures. Today, he is an ugly, bloated person with black teeth and severe drinking, drug, temper, and out-of-control spending problems which sounds very Brandoesque. In fact, he looks like Corey Haim which explains why he is always wearing heavy make-up in movies nowadays. It's too bad because Johnny Depp was once a unique, different human being who spoke well to the audience through unconventional characters.

All in all, Inside the Actors Studio with Johnny Depp is a very highly enjoyable interview to listen to.",1497052800,,1377,4.851063829787234
