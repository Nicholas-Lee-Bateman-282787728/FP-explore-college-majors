8378774,1,B002RMA4VY,Didn't love it. Not what I'd expected and somewhat hard to follow. I like Robert Furgeson but he doesn't teach the classes.,1435968000,2,123,4.636363636363637
8378775,2,B002RMA4VY,"It is something other than the kickboxing or Taibo style of workout that we were looking for. Also, Robert Ferguson doesn't lead these work outs.",1392681600,2,145,4.84
8378776,5,B002RMA4VY,"super response from Amazon seller.  Kudo's.  The start of the ""cardio"" is fun and fast paced.  You can go at your own pace til you get the routines down.",1374537600,,153,4.206896551724138
8378777,2,B002RMA4VY,"I love Robert Ferguson's other workout videos so I bought this to add to my collection.  First, he doesn't lead this one, the other guy (crouching on the cover) does.  It is way more about dance and rhythm moves than the standard calisthenic-type moves you get on his 12-minute Muscle Maker or Fat Burner workouts.  I gave it away to one of my friends who likes Jazzercise!",1361318400,3,373,4.537313432835821
8378778,3,B002RMA4VY,"I was under the impression by the ddetails that the video would have Ferguson as the lead instructor and it is Lorenzo.  He is good too but not as good as ferguson.  The video is good but the moves are a little fast to learn even in the learning video.  I am gonna keep it for a while and keep doing it and hopefully get it, but if I don't I will have to sell it on Amazon.",1339632000,6,373,3.7564102564102564
