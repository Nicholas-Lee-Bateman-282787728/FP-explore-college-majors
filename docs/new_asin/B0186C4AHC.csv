8741567,5,B0186C4AHC,"I'm glad that there is finally a documentary on the ceremonial use of medicinal mushrooms in Mexico. There is so much emphasis on the uses of psychedelics for the purposes of healing, but never have I seen one as profound as this. The importance of using the medicine in a ceremony and with an authentic curandera is highlighted in this film, and being of Mexican descent, I appreciated that very much. The respect for the medicine is where the journey begins, this films follows the journey in a way that is respectful of the medicine, the curandera and the sacred land where the medicine is derived. Gracias",1460332800,,609,4.700934579439252
8741568,5,B0186C4AHC,"It was great to be able to follow a brave group of strangers into the strange land of mexican mushroom shamanism. The film induced that vulnerable sense of sacredness as I related to the characters and their journeys. It felt like there were cultural barriers between the shaman and her initiates, relative to religious coloring and cultural simplification like bridges lost in translation (e.g. I don't think that ""drugs"" were the main problem that kid from LA was dealing with, not to mention that in the US these little saints are themselves considered ""drugs"").",1459123200,,565,5.0212765957446805
8741569,4,B0186C4AHC,"Now what I really liked about this movie is that it's the first movie as far as I know after Robert Gordon Wasson that documents the mushroom ceremony. There are many of them available about ayahuasca and few about other psychedelics.

I'd recommend this movie anyone who considers to have an experience with mushrooms or who wants to learn what's happening at these ceremonies. Anyway it's a more modern approach to the ceremony as everything is happening strongly inside of the christian egregore (energies).

I didn't learn anything new here for myself so I think it should be watched by people who are new to native ceremonies so they may understand what entheogens are about and there's nothing to do with ""getting high"" attitude. Intake of such substance should be taken in ritual setting, with good care and only then the healings may follow.",1453420800,3,849,4.888888888888889
8741570,5,B0186C4AHC,"Little Saints is the first of its kind film - documenting the real life experience of six people who participate in a Shamanic ritual in Oaxaca, Mexico.
The film is authentic, thoughtful and profound. Having taken ""magic mushrooms"" myself and having experienced the sacred aspects of
this ancient medicine, I felt as if I was transported there and I felt the movement of humility, opening and awe that is part of the experience of going through the ritual myself. This documentary had a real transformative effect on me. There so many new age ""shamans"" now and its nearly impossible to find a true healer. Natalia Martinez is true - and her heart, compassion and empathy is felt throughout. The young people who participated are incredibly brave, honest and emotionally available - you can feel their pain and desire to explore their lives and transform themselves through this sacred ceremony. Bravo to Oliver Quintanilla for his courageous work and talent in bringing this to a wide audience.",1452988800,3,994,4.993975903614458
8741571,5,B0186C4AHC,"A brilliant first-hand account of foreigners participating in a traditional mushroom ceremony. This film doesn't stop short by saying ""mushrooms heal people,"" it goes all the way to explain ~how~ mushrooms heal people.

Contains some lucid nuggets of wisdom as well as a few extremely accurate accounts/descriptions of the nature of the mushroom experience. This film took me on a journey to a far away land, yet spoke of things which are so very familiar to my own experience.",1452816000,,477,5.037974683544304
8741572,5,B0186C4AHC,"Fabulous.  I saw it in the theaters and would recommend to anyone interested in yoga, spirituality, psychedelics, or Mexico.  Very well done.",1451952000,,141,5.363636363636363
8741573,4,B0186C4AHC,Very good documentary of a fascinating phenomenon. It's very good to see psychedelic therapy being taken seriously. I would have liked a bit more personal story about the shaman but otherwise an excellent documentary.,1451088000,,217,5.411764705882353
8741574,5,B0186C4AHC,It documents the experience of eating mushrooms by a Maztec ritual/ ceremony in Oaxaca Mexico. Quite an interesting perceptive that makes you think over the topic.  It's also very nice to listen the Maztec language  just for that it's worth watching.,1450224000,,250,5.073170731707317
8741575,5,B0186C4AHC,This is an amazing documentary that help to explain a lot about the use of Mushrooms. They have done an excellent job at explaining the significance and impact of such experiences!!,1447891200,,181,4.870967741935484
