1287940,4,B00003CXSO,"I have nothing but admiration for all involved with this beautiful production.  The sets are gorgeous and the acting/casting is first rate.  The only detail bothering me is the ending being altered from that of the novel.  My guess is that the public would not have reacted to it favorably.  But on the other hand, have not most of us read Hannibal?  Any other ideas about this change?  The changing of the ending accounts for the four star rating; I prefer the ending of the novel to that of the movie.",981763200,,503,4.472527472527473
1287941,5,B00003CXSO,"When I saw Hannibal, I was a little concerned about Jodie Foster's absence. It turns out that Julianne Moore was as good, if not better, than her predecessor. Anthony Hopkins gave another  Oscar-worthy performance as the charming yet frightening Doctor Hannibal ""the Cannibal"" Lecter.  While the film has several moments of extreme gore, it is an overall enjoyable film. The only thing that really made me jump was footage from a video that Clarice was watching of a previous attack by Hannibal.  I highly recommend this movie for any horror fan, or anyone who enjoyed the first one.",981763200,2,583,4.928571428571429
1287942,5,B00003CXSO,"This was twice..if not 3 times as good as Silence of The Lambs (my husband disagrees with me on that aspect). This was an awesome movie! I bought our tickets in advance so there would be no way I'd miss the opening night!! There wasn't a boring moment in this film..it was just awesome (did I say that already? haha)! There were SEVERAL ""Yucky"" parts..but I love that too!! haha! The last ""yucky"" was the worst for me (I am a weakling when it comes to ""that"") blaakkk! haha..dont' worry..this movie is waay too good to give something away! I won't! If there were one movie that you could not miss in theaters..THIS IS IT!",981763200,,621,4.408695652173913
1287943,1,B00003CXSO,"When I first learned that Ridley Scott would direct this sequel to Silence of the Lambs I thought that it would be given the proper treatment. I was ecstatic. Boy was I wrong! This movie has none of the suspense nor sophisticated plotline nor the creepy,eerie feel of the brilliant first film. Also,Julianne Moore was decent as Clarice Starling but she is no Jodie Foster. The film suffers from this change of casting more than I ever dreamed. Anthony Hopkins does a good job as usual but for me it doesn't save this film. It just doesn't feel like a sequel. There is too much emphasis on Hannibal's ""Cannibal"" nature which is done in a lighthearted, cynical fashion which is uninteresting nor funny. The cannibal theme is old and tired now ten years after the previous film and it appears that the filmmakers intended to cash in on this theme by appealing to the audiences of the Friday the 13th movies or the Scream films which rely on shock and gore rather than a deep involving storyline. There is very little to the storyline. Also,actions done by the characters leave you wondering who to root for. It is silly and ridiculous and nowhere near the style of the first film. It is also shallow as there are no headgames played by Hannibal on Clarice which was a large part of the appeal on the first film. Just more cannibal jokes. Now I see why Jodie Foster passed on this movie. A great move on her part. I expected more from Ridley Scott as he is one of my favorite directors but he misses the mark by a mile on this one. If you like deep intelligent psychological thrillers like the aforementioned Silence of the Lambs or Se7en then stay away from this shallow,weak,immature,often boring,sorry excuse for a film.",981763200,2,1719,4.584415584415584
1287944,3,B00003CXSO,"Not to mention it left out a very important element. In the book Hannibal it explains why Hannibal was so nice to Clarice and why he refused to kill her. The movie left that major element out of the book. Not to mention, the violence in the film was completely tasteless in my opinion. It's hard to give a critique of this movie since I can't see past all of the violence. Apart from my negative criticisms of this movie the film held true to the book.",981676800,,452,4.206896551724138
1287945,5,B00003CXSO,"First I have to admit, it's been a long time since I last saw Silence of the Lambs, but as I remember it blew me away.  The remarkable chemistry portrayed by Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster between Dr. Hannibal Lector and Agent Clarice Starling had me spell bound during that movie.  Therefore, I was a bit skeptical if someone could fill Foster's shoes but Julianne Moore proved to be the perfect choice.  Anthony Hopkins does it again; he proves he is the legend material.  The movie opens with Special Agent Starling having professional complexities.  During this phase a rich man with connections, Mason Verger, summons her to seek her help finding Dr. Lector who left him brutally disfigured during their last meet many years back.  Meanwhile, Dr. is in Florence, Italy leading a comfortable life until he is properly identified by an inspector who instead of talking to the authorities decides to sell his whereabouts to Mason Verger for 3 million dollars... At this point Dr. realizes he needs to come out of hibernation...  This movie is technically brilliant.  Acting skills of the lead actors (Anthony Hopkins and Julianne Moore joined by Ray Liotta and Gary Oldman) needs no review, as I don't feel I can do justice.  The playfulness with light is amazing... spellbinding screenplay ... A movie which will honor any collection...",981676800,7,1341,4.950892857142857
1287946,1,B00003CXSO,"Anthony Hopkins may be best known for his potrayal of Hannibal Lector M.D. from the incredible film Silence of the Lambs. His role in Hannibal is one that tarnishes his career and the future of the character of Dr. Lector.
This film is so scattershot that not one idea can come across cleanly. The film jumps between different ideas, failing to tie all of them together in any order. This film is all just random ideas that seemed like they made sense, but when they are viewed as a whole you can see all of the errors that are made.
Ridley Scott does a fine job directing all that he had to work with, which was not much. This film centers on Clarice, played here by Julianne Moore, trying to figure out where Hannibal is at. At the same time the only survivor of Hannibal is trying to find him for his own profit and merit. The role of the disfigured victim is played by an unbilled Gary Oldman. This was the smartest thing that the actor could do. Anyone involved with this film should want their name taken off of it. Hannibal returns to America from Rome, and with him comes his agenda of coming out of retirement and getting back into his old hobbies.
This film is painfully bad. There are scenes that are meant to shock the audience, but instead all they do is make us wonder why they put it in. Ray Liotta is in what is supposed to be the most disturbing scene, but his fate is only dulled by the fact that they audience does not care what happens to anyone that is associated with this film. My only words of wisdom here are make a night at home and watch Manhunter or Silence of the Lambs. With these two films you will not feel cheated and you will ultimately be glad that you skipped this film.",981676800,6,1706,4.284829721362229
1287947,5,B00003CXSO,"I Just Saw ""Hannibal"" at a Special Advanced Screening, and I was Absolutely Blown Away, and I went with the Highest of Expectations. I am a Huge Fan of ""Silence of the Lambs"" and I even watched that one before I saw ""Hannibal"" so all the Events Would be Fresh in my mind. There is not One Problem with the film, not One Off Performance, It is Film-making Perfection. Probably the best Book-to-Film transfer Ever. (well, up there with ""Trainspotting"" and ""American Psycho"")
Anthony Hopkins is his Usual Brilliant Self, Given Considerable More Screen Time and Allowed to have More Fun with the Role of the Deliciously Evil Dr Hannibal Lector. Julianne Moore was a Great Choice to take the role of Clarice Starling, and Gary Oldman is Nearly Unrecogniseable as Mason Verger, a Hater of Hannibal.
Ridley Scotts Direction is Better than Ever, he has become a more Matured Director lately and he allows his skills to Assist the Actors, Not Overshadow them. An All-round Perfect Film, One to see Many, Many... Many times over.",981417600,23,1019,4.795454545454546

1288032,5,B00003CXSO,"The script was in fact really good. Of course this is an adaptation of a novel (which I didn't read), but as often is the case with movies adaptations of novels, some things must be changed simply because what's possible to describe through narration is sometimes impossible to convey audio-visually. Basically, really good storytelling.
Hannibal's character is so much deeper than a crazy cannibal, and Hopkins really sells it. You can always only half tell what he's thinking, but he's definitely thinking a lot.",1512777600,,514,5.130952380952381
1288033,5,B00003CXSO,"This is a better movie than 'Silence of the Lambs' and would be judged so if it had come out first. Deeper and more far reaching with its twists and side plots.  More lavishly portrayed taking the viewer from urban to suburban settings, to forested country roads and homes, to the decadent old money vastness of the Verger estate(complete with wispy fog, like a haunted house) to the beautiful old world streets and churches of Florence Italy and the hills of Sardinia.  It has a better cast too.  Hopkins of course is great but the true acting gem of this movie is Gary Oldman's portrayal of Mason Verger, the disfigured fourth victim of Hannibal Lecter and the only one who lived.  I can't say enough about this unforgettable character.  The makeup job on Oldman is breathtaking as he immerses himself in the role and steals every scene he's in.  This movie could have stood on Oldman's and Hopkin's performances alone but there's more.  Julienne Moore is flat out a better actress than Jodie Foster and doesn't overcook Clarice Starling's southern accent in the wooden manner in which Foster did.  Ray Liotta is always great as a smart-ass and is cast well here as a crooked law-enforcement agent who gets what's coming to him... .  Scott Glenn was the second best actor in 'Silence of the Lambs', here he would be number five.  Spooky and subtly tense with tons of foreshadowing.  Not for the squeamish or faint of heart, 'Hannibal' is top-notch.",1512691200,,1450,4.7370517928286855

Totally sucks you in, and then the ending. Wow, the ending, just wow!",1512086400,,237,4.0
1288036,5,B00003CXSO,"Hannibal does amazing justice as a sequel to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Silence-of-the-Lambs/dp/B002CMV1N4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Silence of the Lambs</a>! The scenes have been really well enacted. Some of the scenes might make you flinch, so if you are particularly squeamish, you might want to rethink your decision to watch this movie.

It is beautifully filmed with a talented cast. Anthony Hopkins reprises his character as the sophisticated Dr. Hannibal Lecter. Julianne Moore does justice to the role of Clarice (even more so than Jodie Foster in my opinion).

This is the sort of big budget horror film that comes around only once every two years, so make it a point to see this movie!",1510963200,,753,5.836363636363636

1288078,5,B00003CXSO,"I love Anthony Hopkins in this character. He is so droll. His intellectual capacity is obviously much greater than anyone else he ever contacts, he only got caught because he is ""insane.""  The movie is well written, directed, and played. I couldn't believe that Jodie Foster could be replaced, but Julianne Moore is certainly as good as Jodie Foster was in ""Silence of the Lambs.""",1509667200,,380,4.846153846153846

1288086,5,B00003CXSO,People either love this or hate this movie. I happen to love it. I thunk the trick is to not in any way compare it to the first movie and watch it on its own merits. Wonderful acting. Anthony Hopkins loves playing this character and it shows.,1497225600,,242,4.170212765957447
1288127,4,B00003CXSO,"Ahhh - Anthony Hopkins returns as the inimitable Hannibal again... What a great actor and story.  It's not quite as good as Silence of the Lambs was but it doesn't fail to deliver an excellent story line.  And of course, Anthony Hopkins' acting was stellar.  I enjoyed seeing the scenery as some of the film was made on the grounds, and inside of the house, of the Biltmore Estate in Asheville, NC.",1496188800,,398,4.5
1288128,3,B00003CXSO,"It's pretty ok. There are a handful of scenes that are well done, but overall it's a big 'So what?'. There are details about Starling's character from the book that I wish had made it into the movie like how she carries a 1911 pistol in the ""cocked and locked"" configuration in a Yaqui slide holster.

Disliked the pacing throughout some of the movie, and some scenes had the antagonists way too unlikable to really care about. Overall, it is a movie called 'Hannibal', and they definitely nailed his character. Very interesting and brilliantly acted by Anthony Hopkins.",1491091200,,438,5.183098591549296
1288131,4,B00003CXSO,"For fans of Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter, this movie is a delight.  I'm not going to be another ""armchair critic,"" like so many reviewers.  I love movies...and I loved ""Red Dragon"" and ""Silence of the Lambs,"" as well as ""Hannibal.""  Hopkins has great dialogue, adds great black humor to his character, and is just plain fun to watch.  I was disappointed Jodie Foster didn't get on board for this movie, but I liked Julianne Moore--she held up very well, and doesn't hold the movie back at all.  All of the supporting cast are equally good, especially creepy Gary Oldman as Mason Verger.  Remember that movies are never as good as the books, so don't come to watch this if you are expecting the film to follow closely to the novel...there is only so much you can put in a 2 hour movie.  Overall, I love Anthony Hopkins as ""Hannibal,"" and loved seeing him with a bigger role and much more dialogue.",1491091200,,902,4.530864197530864

Julianne Moore as Starling is fine if you have the writing to back it up; this film does not have that writing.  It all seems so rushed... or condensed.  I must say, the television series HANNIBEL, does a much better job, a great job of filling in the gaps; of making sense of the novel within the context of film.  This movie is okay, as long as you haven't read HANNIBEL the novel.  The novel is excellent... the movie, meh.  Meh.",1490400000,,543,4.163461538461538
1288136,5,B00003CXSO,"Fascinating study on the virtues of submission to authority and moral subterfuge. The antagonist is worthy and well handled by Gary Oldman. Truly creepy. The antagonist's second provides the right moment of moral clarity toward the end of the film. Lecter is the quintessential evil guy, but offers windows in to his soul, through the circumstances he inhabits. Clarice is a bit of a one note, but staunchly defends her values throughout, providing a certain moral center to it all. A deft narrative regarding the odd cultural shift during the late 20th century from the traditional structure of society to the new.",1489708800,,615,5.03921568627451

1288485,4,B00003CXSO,"The much anticipated sequel to the new horror classic Silence of the Lambs came out in 2001.  It had a troubling producing history, as Jonathan Demme refused to return to direct, Ted Tally refused to screenwrite, and most important of all, Jodie Foster turned down the opportunity to play Clarise Starling.  Julianne Moore was recast as Clarise, and the film was met with mixed but mostly positive reviews.

Set ten years after the original events of Silence of the Lambs, Clarise is still working for the FBI and struggling to get by.  After an ill fated drug bust, Clarise is contacted by Mason Verger, the only surviving victim of Dr. Lecter's from years ago.  Now disfigured and paraplegic, Mason is plotting to someday find and get his revenge on Dr. Lecter.  Using his wealth and influence, he gets Clarise reassigned to Lecter's case, as he has been missing for ten years since his escape.  After learning of Clarise's public disgrace in the drug bust, Dr. Lecter sends her a letter.  Clarise detects a strange scent to the letter, and has some perfume experts analyze and determine that this is made by only a few perfume manufacturers in the world.  After contacting police departments in said cities where these perfumes are made, the audience is lead to Florence, Italy, one of Lecter's beloved cities, where he has been living under an assumed name of Dr. Fell.  After giving the slip to Florence law enforcement and sneaking back to the US undetected, Dr. Lecter then lures Clarise out to Union Station.  Mason's men, having followed Clarise, then capture and bring Dr. Lecter to Mason's lair, where he plans to have Dr. Lecter eaten alive by wild boar.  Dr. Lecter overpowers the guards, rescues Clarise from Mason's men and takes her away, and Mason meets his end.

The movie's ending was changed from that of the book's original ending.  In the original book ending - SPOILER - Clarise and Dr. Lecter become lovers and escape to South America.  The movie ending, however, is a great big gross out.  They had to amp things up to the next level in terms of the violence, when if you think about it Silence of the Lambs was not a very violent movie but more of a suspense.  A romance?  Well, in some ways yes, in that it was clear that Dr. Lecter liked Clarise but because of the very unique relationship nothing would or could come of it.  Now that he is no longer behind bars, Dr. Lecter and Clarise actually as lovers is kind of disturbing, but then again that was the point.  What actually does happen in the movie?  I'm still not sure how I feel about it, except it really was the only option available, which is somewhat disappointing.  This is a flawed movie that did not have anything near the magic that the original did.  Quite honestly, with the full frontal blood and guts scenes, one is left feeling like it was just gross rather than innovative.  Some things were glossed over, such as Mason's past which includes more than just being Dr. Lecter's patient.  Still, this is probably one of the better sequels to such a cultural phenomenon as Silence of the Lambs.  Not for the faint of heart, but a good sequel.",1460246400,,3137,4.63768115942029

1288531,3,B00003CXSO,"This follow up to ""Silence of the Lambs"" is entertaining, although not as good as the first movie.  By now, most everyone knows that Jody Foster refused to play the FBI agent Clarice Starling because she didn't like the direction this movie took the character.  Julianne Moore is harder and less vulnerable than Ms. Foster, but she does not do a bad job.  I have read the book, but it has been a long time ago and I do think this movie sticks to the plot of the book fairly well.  Won't give away the spoiler at the end.  One thing that always bugs me is that no matter where he is or who he is talking to, Hannibal is always 4 steps ahead.  I know he is supposed to be a genius, but he certainly gets around a lot without being recognized. I would give the movie a recommendation.

1288884,3,B00003CXSO,"Although this movie is less about Clarice Starling as a whole.  This one, as the title aptly shows, is all about Hannibal Lecter.  And that has at least a bit to do with why I'm not exactly sold on this sequel.

Hannibal is a great character in fiction.  And Anthony Hopkins does a fantastic job portraying him.  But I had a hard time getting behind him being the central character of this film.  I feel like he works best as a sort of puppet master type, pulling strings in the background, and manipulating those around him to basically advance the plot.

As he is the main focus now, we get a lot of scenes and character dialogue reminding us how clever he is.  Which the movie uses as an excuse to turn him into an invincible slasher type villain in a lot of the movie.  It just screams poorly written fluff because the plot demands it writing, and by the end of it I was actually exhausted by how 'clever' Hannibal Lecter was throughout the film.

It's not all bad.  Much like Silence of the Lambs, there's some really creepy imagery.  There's also some really horrific gore.  And it should go without saying that the film is acted superbly.

While I do miss Jody Foster in the Clarice Starling role, Julianne Moore does bring a new dimension to the character, far more sure of herself, but worn out after years of doing detective work.  So while she misses that sort of iconic vulnerability and does become a different character, it makes sense thematically.

Overall, this is probably a safe watch if you really liked Silence of the Lambs.  It has a lot of the same psychological storytelling, although it just wasn't executed as well.  And it really depends on how much the Hannibal Lecter character stands out basically on his own for you.  I personally just found it a bit lacking.",1455840000,5,1790,4.520249221183801

1289299,5,B00003CXSO,"5 stars for movie - 1 for the misleading info on back cover of the one i bought (2015 release)!
Lately I have been buying blu-rays and dvds which say one thing on the package and after I open them it is discovered I have been mislead.
The formats are not what is described, the extras are not what are described, etc.  I have this cover of the Blu-ray, which has a cardboard cover gubbered onto the outside front plastic cover with sticky gum, something hard to tell until you take the plastic wrap off. (Both are the exact same cover - this one shown - unlike some cardboard attachments which are different from the original insert inside case's plastic sleeve.)  I bought this dvd because it said the SPECIAL FEATURES were only commentary by Ridley Scott, which I was anxious to hear after all these years of loving this movie.  The are NO SPECIAL FEATURES at all, not even the promised commentary.  I am so tired of being gamed with this multi-variations of movie discs which mean I have to study and research what I am buying, yet alone having something in hand which says one thing on the back descriptive cover and then proves to be false.  Takes all the pleasure out of buying movies (a second - third or more time) only to end up with an unnecessary and unwanted copy in a program format I would have had no interest in IF the truth had been told on the back cover instead of false promises of what was actually on the disc.  Is anyone else getting tired of being ripped off in this manner?  I just want some truth in packaging so I know what I am buying.  Maybe someday enough people complain that this practice is investigated and these companies will be held accountable for such unacceptable business practices - it is happening too often to be just an occasional error or oversight.  I am talking about the white cover with gagged Hannibal which says on the back cover of case that Ridley Scott's commentary is the Special Feature - do not open if that is what you are looking for and expecting to enjoy~!  It ain't there!!!! (I bought this elsewhere, but warning anyone who receives this in the mail hoping for that feature if written on back - I do not see it mentioned on this Amazon listing - which appears to be more accurate than packaging details on back of disc case I bought UPC BAR 027616 07332 7 the original on insert has 83 on right above upc bar cod and the sticker on outside of plastic over original bar code has same upc number except it has 84 positioned top right above the added sticler's bar code  - fyi - apparently mine was re-identified with an 84 instead of 83 on right top of barcode - regardless, the back cover still said commentary included in type BELOW the bar of four images from the movie running horizontally across the middle of the back cover, unlike above like the image here at AMAZON - the upc number is also different - how many versions of the same 2015 release are there, anyhow?????).",1445472000,,2940,4.415896487985212

Gary Oldman is no ""gem"" to look at, but come on - this is a movie about cannibalism! SPOILER ALERT:  The only thing I might have had done differently would be to have Starling,when she saw the drifting boat, look at her hands, pause and think about it, then shout for the police/FBI to come over to her, ""turning him in.""

1289721,2,B00003CXSO,"I really wanted to like this movie after seeing The Silence of the Lambs, but it sucked!  Anthony Hopkins being in this movie was one of the only redeeming factors of this movie.  I will say though, I prefer the ending to this over the ending to the book, because the book took so much away from the Clarice Starling character.  Recasting Jodie Foster with Julianne Moore was a very poor decision, and she didn't seem really into the role.  The Mason Verger character was alright at most.  Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter was a great performance, and he had some cool scenes.  Overall though, there wasn't as much to this as I thought, and some important elements of the characters were lost.  There were many points of the film where I almost fell asleep and lost interest in.  It's not the worst movie I've seen, but still bad.  The special features on the second disc are decent and I thought the commentary was more interesting than the movie at times.  Not as bad as Hannibal Rising, but not anywhere near as good as The Silence of the Lambs, Manhunter, or Red Dragon.  Anyway, if you like the Hannibal Lecter character or Anthony Hopkins' performances, than it's still worth watching.  It's not a movie that I would watch over and over again like the other 3, or even maybe Hannibal Rising, but still re-watchable every once and a while.  Maybe if I watch it again I will have a different opinion, but as of now, it's bad.",1427587200,,1431,4.521400778210117

I rented what I thought was Red Dragon, but I hit the wrong movie ""Hanibal"" and I couldn't see being charged for a movie that I love and have watched many times so I deleted it in protest as I couldn't prove that I had not started watching it as it showed where I had previously stopped play while a prime member.  So hard to get someones attention.  Before this I had intended to reup my prime membership like my sis and brotherinlaw,  who I convinced to sign up for the kindles that my sis uses and the shipping that we all use, but I need to calm down first.

1289730,5,B00003CXSO,"If you're looking for ""Hannibal"" to be a sequel similar to ""Silence of the Lambs,"" forget it. It was never intended to be ""Lambs Part 2."" Just like ""Silence"" is not a direct sequel to ""Red Dragon,"" neither is ""Hannibal"" a straight sequel to ""Lambs."" Yes, it features a familiar cast of characters, but it is not supposed to be a simple continuation of what was happening in ""Lambs."" As the title suggests, the main focus of this story is Hannibal himself, not a cop like Will Graham or Clarice Starling. Much like the procedural focus of the first two novels mirrored the sense of order within the protagonists, the surreal, bizarre quality of this story directly reflects the essence of Hannibal himself. Whereas the first two books/movies were crime thrillers, this is one is much more of a gothic horror story. After the first two books, which offered tantalizing glimpses of Lecter, fans clamored for more, so Thomas Harris gave them what they wanted. He gave them the monster. This approach seems to have split the audience that loved ""Silence of the Lambs"" into disappointed critics who don't appreciate the departure in style and elated fans whose bloodthirst was sated by an entire story focused on Hannibal. I, for one, think the movie is mostly fantastic. It's like the scene in ""Lambs"" where Hannibal kills the guards in Tennessee, only extended throughout the whole movie. Anthony Hopkins mesmerizes as usual playing the title character, which almost goes without saying. And Julianne Moore, with the unenviable task of replacing Jodie Foster in an iconic role, makes a seamless transition to a somewhat more jaded and cynical Clarice, maybe not quite making us forget that Foster is absent, but doing far better than anyone else could have.

On the downside, I don't think they completely got the gist of the book, and didn't want to.  They wanted Clarice to be the hero who takes down the monster in a game of psychological cat-and-mouse.  However, the book is called Hannibal because that's who and what it's about.  It's about creating an exotic world that represents Hannibal's reality, and trying to make you feel like you're actually inside of that world.  For the most part, the movie is faithful to that vision, culminating in the horrific scene of Hannibal feeding Paul Krendler his own brain. But they wimped out on the ending, insisting that Clarice not run away with Hannibal, but stick to her sense of duty and attempt to arrest him. I prefer the truly unexpected ending of the novel in which Hannibal weaves his spell on Clarice and flees the country with her as his companion. It's like Dracula coming out the winner. Hannibal has been transformed into the ultimate anti-hero, overcoming a traumatic childhood to avenge all the wrongs of his past, get the girl, and along the way, eat a few people who we'd probably like to do away with anyhow. While the movie maintains this perspective all the way up to the end, they cop out (no pun intended) on delivering Clarice into the hands of the monster. Other than the watered down ending, though, I greatly enjoy Hannibal as an adaptation of the book, Gary Oldman's over-the-top Mason Verger and all. As much as it's a spectacle of horror, it's as artistic and nuanced as ""Silence of the Lambs,"" just turned inside-out by its focus on Hannibal instead of a hero.",1424131200,2,3336,4.804878048780488

1289786,5,B00003CXSO,"a much underrated film if one takes the trouble the dantean references alone are fascinating. What is most intriguing whether by design or accident is the misperception of clarice (from the greek clarissa ""brilliant"") as poor white trash  In fact there is a clever connection again whether by design or accident between clarice and franscesco de pazzi who as we know comes to a bad end. Clarice Orsini (c. 1453  30 July 1488) was the daughter of Jacopo (Giacomo) Orsini, Lord of Monterotondo and Bracciano, and his wife and cousin Maddalena Orsini. Born in the Papal States, she is most known as the wife of Lorenzo de' Medici (Lorenzo the Magnificent), de facto ruler of the Florentine Republic. She was the mother of Pope Leo X.During the Pazzi Conspiracy, which was aimed at murdering Lorenzo and his younger brother Giuliano, Clarice and her children were sent to Pistoia. (The Pazzis succeeded in murdering Giuliano, but Lorenzo survived the attack, thus the conspirators' plan to replace the Medicis as de facto rulers of Florence failed.) I do wonder if this along with the splendid Dantean references was intended--food for thought. Clarice certainly has a nobility about her",1421366400,,1183,5.030612244897959

1289957,4,B00003CXSO,"Let me get this out front:  I believe ""The Silence of the Lambs"" is the best Hannibal Lecter movie.  They really had the perfect storm in terms of actors/actresses, directors, screenplay, music, visual effects, sets, heck -- everything.  ""Hannibal"" is largely regarded as the sequel to ""The Silence of the Lambs,"" which makes it difficult to rate this film on its own merits.  I will try to do that here.

THE GOOD:

We have to start with the characters, particularly Sir Anthony Hopkins.  Again, he plays Hannibal the Cannibal to iconic perfection.  No one both taunts and mentors at the same time like Hopkins as Hannibal.  Now let's talk about Julianne Moore as Clarice Starling.  A lot of people were disappointed that Jodie Foster chose not to reprise this role, but Julianne Moore did an outstanding job playing a Clarice that is ten years older and is now a seasoned FBI veteran.  She comes off as a more confident, resourceful heroine who still has her own problems to deal with.  As for Gary Oldman as Mason Verger, that part was practically written for him and he played it so well -- feigning piety one moment and showing his true malevolent colors the next.  Ray Liotta delivers as the dirty bureaucrat we all love to hate in spades.  I had never heard of Giancarlo Giannini before seeing this movie, and he gave a performance that easily explains why he is one of the most famous actors in Italy.

The movie was well-directed and well-paced, the cinematography was excellent, the set pieces and costuming were spot-on, the music was very good (but not quite as good as that in ""The Silence of the Lambs"") and yes, there was the gore you would expect in a movie about the world's most infamous serial killer.  Some may say the gore is over-the-top in a couple of places, but it follows in lock-step with Hannibal's brutality as written by Thomas Harris.

THE NOT-SO-GOOD:

Jack Crawford is notably missing from this movie, which is a disappointment because he played a key role in the book.  I believe the story would have been better if they had written him in, not just because of what he did for Clarice but for the conflict he faced involving FBI politics -- and what ultimately happened to him (sorry; if you want to know, read the book).

One notable story hole is how Inspector Pazzi figured out ""Dr. Fell"" was Hannibal Lecter.  Pazzi looking up the FBI Top Ten Most Wanted list was too easy.  They would have done better to develop that more -- as well as Pazzi's back-story, which would make it easier to understand why he sold Hannibal out to Mason Verger.

They also did not go very deep into the FBI politics and Clarice's evolution from hard-charging do-gooder to disgruntled employee.  They really should have focused more on the intent to make Starling the scapegoat for the Drumgo disaster, and again, they should have showed Jack Crawford's involvement.

Finally, the ending was very disappointing.  We see Clarice with her hands up identifying herself as an FBI agent (which she wasn't at the time) and Hannibal flying off somewhere.  No real resolution there.  The ending in the book was much better, and -- as difficult as it may be to stomach for some people -- should have been the ending of the movie (again, sorry -- if you want to know how it ends, read the book).

BOTTOM LINE:  The producers get an A for effort.  They knew going in this movie would be compared to ""The Silence of the Lambs"" and would therefore be at an automatic disadvantage.  I really believe ""Hannibal"" would have been every bit as good as its predecessor if they had followed the story Thomas Harris wrote more closely.  Even so, it's still a very good film -- definitely worth seeing if you're a fan of Hannibal the Cannibal.",1412121600,2,3737,4.639269406392694

This is the one about how people never really forgive and remember your ancestry as if it marks your character.

This is the one with Gary Oldman as a child predator.

This is the one that delivers blows of the horribleness of monsters but gets no respect as a sequel to Silence of the Lambs.

I wouldn't say this movie is compelling or entertaining - it's a very gray looking film and Clarice is muted but it is more informative than Silence of the Lambs - older and drier.

They found the disappeared Korean with slices of flesh in the thigh cut out.

What shocked them more was the whale meat Japanese gave to them a few days earlier. At that time, they felt satisfied because it had been long since they had eaten meat last time, but they quivered thinking they might have eaten human flesh. It was not quite possible the Japanese without any tool caught a whale and gave the meat to Koreans.

AN FRANCISCO, April 23, 1945
A.A.P.-- Frank Bartholomew.

Vice- president of the American United Press , said to-day that  the Japanese cut off from supplies practise cannibalism in New Guinea during the actionsat Buna, Gona, and Sanananda.

An Australian Lieut.-Colonel L. T.Shave early in 1943. showed me captured food tins containing boiled hands from which all the flesh had been picked,"" said Batholomew, who has not previous been able to relate the story due to censorship.

General Eichelberger, commanding the combined Allied Advanced forces, told me of the discovery among make-shift Japanese supplies of a large stock of flesh cut off Caucasian bodies and wrapped in banana leaves.

""There was no evidence that the Japanese killed prisoners for food, they apparently used bodies not recovered by our forces.""

Lieut.-Colonel Robert Williams, who has just returned from the Pacific, said that circulars captured in the Philippines revealed that the Japanese had eaten their own dead.

The circulars explained that, starving soldiers could survive by eating human flesh, and  gave details of which part of the body were best for eating. Mutilated bodies suggesting cannibalism were found in the hills of Leyte.

DEATH FOR JAP WHO PRACTISED CANNIBALISM
RABAUL. Tuesday.

It was alleged at the war crimes court to day that four Japanese had given sick Indians"" injections and that after the Indians had died they cooked and had eaten part of their bodies

Found guilty of cannibalism Captain Takashi Takase was sentenced to death and the other three to ten years gaol.

AP DOCTOR TO HANG FORMURDER OF P.O.W's RABAUL, Tuesday

A Jap medical officer, Lieut. Has-ata Tomiyasu, was ""found guilty bythe war crimes court and sentenced  to death by hanging, for the murder of 14 Indian soldiers and for cannibalism.
The ""incident occurred in the We-wak area in 1944.

The case for the prosecution rest-ed upon statutory declaration by an Indian .P.O.W., Second-Lieut. Abdul Latif who was killed in an aircraft crash last December.  He said-thatTomiyasu took Pte Ghan away from the camp, ostensibly to get- medical supplies for the Indian troops.

Tomiyasu returned alone and said that Khan had run away.  Latif said he believed Ghan was
killed because that night he sawfresh meat in a cookhouse. The statement also gave details of
the shooting of Indians , and added that the only fresh meat to be hadat Sowan was human flesh.

INDIAN OFFICERS SHOT FOR BEING ,TOO WEAK TO WORK
Rabaul Thursday.

At the trial to day of Lieut-General Adachi on charge of responsibility for war crimes committed by his subord-inates it was stated that a Japanese  lieutenant and two NCO's near Wewak in February, 1945, shot four Indian officers because they were tooweak to carry heavy loads on a march.

The shooting of the Indians is included in the long list of atrocities which were alleged to have been committed by Adachi s men  Lieut Chint Singh, who was a Prisoner of war at Wewak, des scribed the methods of ill-treatment,adopted by the Japanese. Out of 529 men held as prisoners between July, 1943, and April, 1944, no fewer than 130 had died. Indians, whowere wounded during air raids, had sand thrown over their bodies.

The treatment by the Japanese was most iniquitous. Under cross-examination he said he had joined the Indian National Army under duress.

Lt George Bush, then a 20-year-old pilot, was among nine airmen who escaped from their planes after being shot down during bombing raids on Chichi Jima, a tiny island 700 miles south of Tokyo, in September 1944 - and was the only one to evade capture by the Japanese.

The next day a Japanese officer, Major Sueo Matoba, decided to include American flesh in a sake-fuelled feast he laid on for officers including the commander-in-chief on the island, Gen Yoshio Tachibana. Both men were later tried and executed for war crimes.
A Japanese medical orderly who helped the surgeon prepare the ingredients said: ""Dr Teraki cut open the chest and took out the liver. I removed a piece of flesh from the flyer's thigh, weighing about six pounds and measuring four inches wide, about a foot long.""
Another crewman, Floyd Hall, met a similar fate. Adml Kinizo Mori, the senior naval officer on Chichi Jima, told the court that Major Matoba brought ""a delicacy"" to a party at his quarters - a specially prepared dish of Floyd Hall's liver.
According to Adml Mori, Matoba told him: ""I had it pierced with bamboo sticks and cooked with soy sauce and vegetables."" They ate it in ""very small pieces"", believing it ""good medicine for the stomach"", the admiral recalled.
A third victim of cannibalism, Jimmy Dye, had been put to work as a translator when, several weeks later, Capt Shizuo Yoshii - who was later tried and executed - called for his liver to be served at a party for fellow officers. Parts of a fourth airman, Warren Earl Vaughn, were also eaten and the remaining four were executed, one by being clubbed to death.

During the meal, President Bush felt ill and turned and vomited on the Japanese Prime Minister. This remains the only recorded case of a head of state throwing up on the head of another country's government.

Eagleton and Walklate were thought to have tried to avoid capture by floating out into the ocean on palm logs where they either drowned or were quickly killed by the Japanese. But when the bones were found on Kairiru Island this year and information was provided from elderly island residents, it suggests the men suffered a far more horrific fate - one that had been covered up for years.
Previously secret documents from the archives reveal the two were thought to have been horrifically dissected and their organs served up in a ritual dinner to Japanese soldiers, or souvenired and taken back to Japan.

__________________________________

It is clear from the historical source material to be found at the end of this chapter that cannibalism of Allied prisoners by the Japanese military was not a rare occurrence. In ""The Knights of Bushido"", Lord Russel of Liverpool cites examples of Allied prisoners of war being murdered and portions of their bodies served up at dinner parties attended by senior Japanese Army and Navy officers. Captured American pilots were not only more likely to be murdered but the eating of their flesh was made into something of a festive occasion in the Japanese officers' mess. Lord Russell includes the actual text of a Japanese document headed ""Order regarding eating flesh of American flyers"". See pages 233-240.

Both Lord Russell and Laurence Rees in ""Horror in the East"" make it clear that the cannibalism practised by the Japanese military was not necessarily related to shortage of normal food. The following case of murder and cannibalism by Japanese soldiers is drawn from the Kokoda Track in 1942 and was in no way explained by shortage of rice or other rations.

As the Australians pursued the retreating Japanese along the Kokoda Track, they came upon evidence that the Japanese had been eating captured Australian soldiers. After a fierce clash with the Japanese at Templeton's Crossing, an Australian patrol was forced to withdraw and leave behind six Australian dead and four wounded. Reinforcements arrived on the following day, and the Australians were able to attack again and capture the Japanese position. The Australians troops were horrified to find that the Japanese had been eating both the wounded and dead Australians who had been left behind on the previous day. Corporal Bill Hedges describes the ghastly scene:

""The Japanese had cannibalised our wounded and dead soldiers..We found them with meat stripped off their legs and half-cooked meat in the Japanese dishes (pots)"".

One of Corporal Hedges closest comrades was among the butchered bodies. He said:

""I was heartily disgusted and disappointed to see my good friend lying there, with the flesh stripped off his arms and legs; his uniform torn off him.""

Shortly afterwards, the Australian corporal was appalled to discover that the Japanese had not resorted to cannibalism because of starvation. He said:

""We found dumps with rice and a lot of tinned food. So they weren't starving and having to eat flesh because they were hungry.""

The quotations by Corporal Hedges come from ""Horror in the East"" by Laurence Rees, a BBC publication (2001). This book is essential reading for anyone hoping to try to understand Japanese war atrocities.

It was NOT necessary for survival - they CHOSE to eat people because it was fresher, it was cruel and it was a bonding experience:

One of the Accounts States, ""[on November 12, 1944] the Kempeitai beheaded [an Allied] pilot. I saw this from behind a tree and watched some of the Japanese cut flesh from his arms, legs, hips, buttocks and carry it off to their quarters... They cut it small pieces and fried it.""

the Japanese started selecting prisoners and every day one prisoner was taken out and killed and eaten by the soldiers. I personally saw this happen and about 100 prisoners were eaten at this place by the Japanese. The remainder of us were taken to another spot 50 miles [80 km] away where 10 prisoners died of sickness. At this place, the Japanese again started selecting prisoners to eat. Those selected were taken to a hut where their flesh was cut from their bodies while they were alive and they were thrown into a ditch where they later died.

My Chinese school teacher and family members in the South also remember corpses missing buttocks and thighs.

The cruel staff in concentration camps also ate prisoners so they could embezzle the food budget and sell the supplies yet the starving prisoners themselves managed to hide small children instead of eating them who survived the war.

_________

When the British eventually moved in on the swamp, they found that of the nine hundred troops that originally fled into the swamp, only around twenty seriously wounded and weakened Japanese soldiers were left. In all, about 500 Japanese soldiers escaped from Ramree despite the intense blockade instituted to stop them. If Wright's claim is true, however, the Ramree crocodile attacks would be the worst in recorded history.[1] The British Burma Star Association seems to lend credence to the swamp attack stories but appears to draw a distinction between the 20 Japanese survivors of one attack and the 1,000 Japanese who were left to fend for themselves in the swamp.[3] Furthermore there is no corroboration of the event by British military reports or by interviewed Japanese soldiers and local Burmese.[4] These figures are disputed and the event has been described as an urban myth by British historian Frank McLynn, who opined that only a few wounded Japanese had been consumed, although he did admit that the saltwater crocodiles of the region were both ""known man-eaters and opportunistic killers"".[4] McLynn's criticisms of the account primarily stem from his personal incredulity that the ""Japanese firepower, which tore such holes in British tanks and armour"", would be incapable of dispatching large numbers of crocodiles at night.

The survivors are reported to have told horrific tales of dozens of crocodiles attacking the soldiers en masse, and appearing out of seemingly nowhere to drag off some poor soul. The nights were said to have been filled with dire screams, gunfire, and the sounds of animal attacks.

Mr Tanaka, a 43-year-old scholar from Fukui in western Japan, is working at the Political Science Department in Melbourne University. The documents he found concerning cannibalism include captured Japanese army memos as well as sworn statements by Australian soldiers for war crimes investigations. Mr Tanaka says he has amassed at least 100 documented cases of cannibalism of Australian and Indian soldiers as well as Asian forced labourers in New Guinea. He has also found some evidence of cannibalism in the Philippines.

'In some cases the (Japanese) soldiers were suffering from starvation, but in many other cases they were not starving at all,' said Mr Tanaka. 'Many reports said the Japanese soldiers were fit and strong, and had potatoes, rice and dried fish.' Some Japanese press reports yesterday suggested the cannibalism was carried out simply because of shortage of food.

The researcher also denied it was a result of a breakdown in morale: 'The reports said morale was good. Often it was done in a group under instruction of a commander. I think it was to get a feeling for victory, and to give the soldiers nerves of steel.' He said it helped the soldiers to bond 'because the whole troop broke the taboo (of cannibalism) together'.

One statement by an Australian lieutenant describes how he found the remains of a number of bodies, including one 'consisting only of a head which had been scalped and a spinal column'. 'In all cases, the condition of the remains were such that there can be no doubt that the bodies had been dismembered and portions of the flesh cooked,' concluded the statement. Another statement from an Australian corporal tells how he found the mutilated bodies of colleagues whom he had earlier helped to bury in Japanese- occupied territory.

A Pakistani, who was captured when Japan overran Singapore and taken to New Guinea, testified that in his area Japanese soldiers killed and ate one prisoner a day for 'about 100' days. The corporal said he saw flesh being cut from prisoners who were still alive.

Mr Tanaka found the documents by chance while doing research in Australian government archives on chemical warfare. 'I just came across them by accident - they were labelled 'War crimes documents - closed materials'.'",1407628800,,14964,5.017777777777778

1290243,4,B00003CXSO,"While the movie presentation was well presented it lacked much of the fire of the book upon which it was loosely based.  I recognize the difficulty in adapting almost any book to film but there was entirely too many changes to the plot line and the ending was a travesty. I suppose I would have rated it higher had I not read the books.  It is worth watching but keep your expectations low if you are expecting a ""true-to-the-tale"" version,",1398124800,,440,4.4875
1290244,4,B00003CXSO,Good movie.  Its  entertaining  and well made.  Anthony Hopkins is amazing as usual. Julianne Moore did a good job but it didn't feel like a sequel without Jodie Foster.  Still a good movie though and worth seeing.,1398124800,,214,4.675675675675675

1290247,3,B00003CXSO,"Decent sequel but not as good as the original. I feel I would have given it another star if I wasn't comparing it to Silence of the Lambs. But it is it's sequel so I must. Julianna Moore's Agent Starling's phony accent was really bad and a small distraction from the flow of the movie. All in all, a good choice to watch on a boring night.",1397347200,,339,4.074626865671642

This movie had a skimpy plot...Hannibal comes out of retirement, is chased by goons a rich man he disfigured attacked, and Clarise is in the middle trying to arrest him first. Surely they could have done better. And the scene with the boars or whatever they were just crossed the line into disgusting.

The story is interesting but it just didn't keep me interested long enough. Acting was good, story line continues where ""Silence of the Lambs"" left off. I found the story drags in places but if you love the Hannibal story then I'm sure you'll love this movie.",1392595200,,392,4.458333333333333

Don't buy it, don't rent it, don't watch it.  If I could burn every print, every DVD, every Bluray, I would.  Horrible movie.",1392076800,2,412,4.368421052631579

1290752,5,B00003CXSO,"The film was entertaining in many ways starting with the story by Thomas Harris and the characters that he created, Hannibal Lecter, Mason Verger, and Clarice Starling. Of course the superb acting by Anthony Hopkins, Gary Oldman, and Julianne Moore brought to life on screen those characters in a way that riveted my attention throughout the movie. I also enjoyed the history, sets and setting in which the story unfolded finely crafted by the directorial hand of Ridley Scott and his crew. Han Zimmer's beautiful score enhanced the action scene after scene in a captivating way for me.

1290922,4,B00003CXSO,"First off, I'd like to address the elephant in the room (if you have not read the novel that this film was based on, you're currently being squeezed against a wall by that elephant and in the room.  You probably don't know why, so guess what you ought to do.)  Thank you for writing a different ending for the film version of this story because I, like many readers, could never wrap my head around the ending that author Thomas Harris had created in the novel&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hannibal/dp/0440224675/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hannibal</a>.
  Unlike&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Silence-of-the-Lambs-Two-Disc-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B000LP6KNU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Silence of the Lambs (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)</a>, this film wasn't as suspenseful and is sliding back into the mold of a standard action thriller...it would have probably kept sliding beyond that if the ending hadn't been changed.  Having Anthony Hopkins back as Dr. Hannibal Lector certainly kept the film out of the standard action thriller genre.  I'm just not sure if Dr. Lector is ever a character we should root for while he's on the run and getting away with all kinds of evil things.  I liked him better when he was the evil, psychopathic doctor we loathed but simultaneously couldn't stop watching.  Perhaps we should have had Jack Crawford in the film (he was in the book) as his hatred for the doctor could have brought us those awesome characteristics we've come to know and love.
  Perhaps we should have also had Jody Foster back in this picture, though Julianne Moore was a decent Clarice Starling...she just couldn't stand up to the plot and I think Foster would have had the same problem to some extent...they're both much too good for something in danger of becoming a standard action thriller.
  I will say that Gary Oldman did play a nicely creepy villain who embodied all the characteristics I mentioned earlier about Dr. Lector.  Unfortunately that does not make up for Dr. Lector's change in character...they should have both been like that.  Ray Liotta often just came off as a bumbling henchman instead of a competent, conniving federal agent.  If I wanted anyone off my screen, it was him...which is a shame as I do like Ray Liotta as an actor.  It just wasn't his day.
  But despite all my disagreements and rants against this film, it's still decent and worth adding to your Hannibal Lector collection...and like I said, it's got a better ending than the book.  Maybe Jonathan Demme ought to come back and direct a sequel to this film...who knows what it might be like.  Enjoy.",1380153600,,2695,5.341232227488152

Overall, I think it is a great follow-up to Silence of the Lambs, which I remember seeing in the theatre when I was a teen.  Although I would have preferred Jodi Foster, Julianne Moore does a pretty good job (although she lost her accent before the end of the movie).

As far as I can say, I would suggest seeing this movie even if you haven't seen the first in the series.  Standing on its own, it's a pretty good movie and I would definitely classify it as a Thriller, but not so much horror (I guess the blood makes it horror).

Very few horror movies can boast the amount of first-rate talent found in this one: Ridley Scott, David Mamet, Anthony Hopkins, and Giancarlo Giannini.  Julianne Moore is no worse than Jodie Foster in the main female role, but neither is convincing to me.  Scott, Mamet, and Hopkins add considerable depth to the HL character and succeed in an almost impossible task of making this monster both attractive and likable in a perverse sense.  The main problem with the movie is its excesses (common to most such movies nowadays): HL is simply TOO dangerous and efficient.  Also (not to give too much of a spoiler), the ""brain"" business is silly.  The movie should have ended with HL kissing Julianne Moore. What comes afterward is medically stupid and unbelievable.",1370131200,,912,5.006622516556291

1291338,2,B00003CXSO,"Hannibal Lecter has supposedly exquisite taste.  He likes the finest foie gras, the best sweat breads, and the tastiest Chiantis.  Well personally, I would rather have a good Amarone myself.  But I'd also prefer a movie that doesn't ridicule the paying audience.

This film is surely grotesque, but that is far from its greatest weakness.  The over-the-top religious imagery, reminding me a bit of the original ""Carrie"" -- which I reviewed not too long ago -- made me weary.  Dr. Lecter lecturing on Judas Iscariot betraying Jesus, and then showing Judas later hanging while being disemboweled from a tree; Dr. Lecter being carried by a forklift to his final ""meal"" as if he has been crucified; etc. etc.  From what I remember, early in the film, I believe that Starling says something like, ""Dr. Lecter considers himself to be a savior figure.""  Yeah, right.  Savior if you like going to an early grave, I suppose.

The theme of this film seems to show the dangers of revenge and greed.  Well, unless you're Hannibal Lecter of course.  After all, he can exact revenge -- or work as a proxy to exact revenge for his ""buddy"" Starling or anyone else that he finds ""worthy"" -- and then it's all OK.  The strength of the first movie was that the director kept Dr. Lecter at arm's length.  Here, they bring him in too close, and no one in his or her right mind would get as close to him as some of these characters do.  So to me, the weakness in this film goes all the way back to the screenplay.  I believe that there were many flaws there.  But it could be argued that even making a sequel was simply in poor taste.

And this poor taste brings up an interesting question:  If Dr. Lecter has such great taste, what would HE think if he watched this movie?  I think that he would say something like, ""Tsk tsk.  If you can't have good manners, I might send you to the kiddy's table.""  But I might say, ""Why send it to the kiddy's table?  How about if we just put it out in the backyard and use it as compost.""  But that doesn't even seem to be a very tasty proposition.",1366761600,,2063,4.396825396825397

The order is The Silence of the Lambs (1991), Hannibal (2001), Red Dragon (2002), and Hannibal Rising (2007). There is one before the first one called Manhunter (1986) but I never saw that so I have no idea how that plays a part in the collection. For the most part I like this one the best out of all of them because I like that it focuses more on Hannbal Lecter himself and shows that he can be a good person since he loves Clarice. This is why I also liked the Prequel Hannibal Rising as well which explains how Hannibal Lector became a monster. I also liked Hannibal because I like the actor Anthony Hopkins and he is in this movie much more than he was in The Silence of the Lambs. If you're a fan of the collection then get it but.

1291488,2,B00003CXSO,"Someone else put it well:  ""everything is forced and nothing is believable.""
I loved Silence of the Lambs.  This one has a horrible storyline, worse than most science fiction, terrible acting, & as other reviews have noted, grossness beyond meaning or necessity.
The new Starling (Moore) was horrible;  she's colder, less sensitive, less emotional, less of everything that made the 1st Starling great.  To be fair, she has some merit, but, in the scope of a good movie, relatively little.
To quote another reviewer: ""Julianne Moore didn't hold a candle to Jodie Foster in the role of Agent Starling.""
The only saving grace in this movie, is Hannibal himself (the original Anthony Hopkins) & for his part, I give it 2 stars instead of only 1.
See other reviews (1-3*) for more on what makes this worse than the 1st one.
A better edited version of this film, with the original Starling would deserve a 4*.

Out of the four Lecter movies, this is the one that just doesn't fit. I didn't like the whole overseas aspect, although the manhunt was Lecter was pretty good. Clarice Starling was a completely different character in Hannibal and it has nothing to do with that fact that another woman was playing her. Juliana Moore did a great job, but Starling, wasn't the same Starling we came to love in Silence of The Lambs. She was reckless and honestly not as smart as the Starling we all know and love.

Julianne Moore is beautiful, all marble skin, red lips and fierce intelligence. I must confess, it is one of my favourite films, it is just so evocative and atmospheric that I often return to this black palace and bathe in the many bloody treasures that it holds.

1291561,2,B00003CXSO,"Upon initial viewing, I found this film equal parts entertaining and gratuitous (and quite over the top); despite the expert, near-camp direction of Ridley Scott and the honorable performance of Julianne Moore in a daring reimagining of Jodie Foster's triumphant role, its net effect was to somewhat sour my memory of Silence of the Lambs.  However, I was not particularly resentful of its existence until I bought the DVD.

I'm a great fan of DVD documentaries and featurettes; I've always appreciated being given insights into the genesis and construction of films, even those detailing the production of movies I didn't particularly enjoy.  Unfortunately, after watching the ""Making of Hannibal"" piece on this DVD, I developed a true hatred of ""Hannibal"", and by association the entire Lecter franchise.

The reason?  One Martha De Laurentiis (nee Schumacher), the widow of the late Dino De Laurentiis and producer of the Hannibal series from this film onward.  She is the salient narrator of this ghastly ""making of"" documentary, and watching her is like being powdered with fleas for 45 minutes.

Mrs. De Laurentiis (and I use this salutation over Ms., as her marriage appears to be the most auspicious item on her CV), was previously a producer of relentless D-grade schlock films based on bargain-basement Stephen King adaptations (Maximum Overdrive, Cats Eye, Firestarter) before meeting and marrying Dino De Laurentiis, a Hollywood legend responsible for producing an even longer list of exploitation films and sequels.  The pasha's riches Mrs. De Laurentiis subsequently inherited from this unholy union (to a man nearly 40 years her senior) apparently included his vast fortune, a nepotistic position as president of his production company, and a very painful faux Italian accent.

For the length of this documentary, this woman, who save her Donatella hairdo looks as if she plopped off the Mayflower, gushes one ""che bellisimo"" after another about how ""delicious"" it is to see Anthony Hopkins reprising his role as Hannibal the Cannibal, all  the while trilling her R's to the accompaniment of operatic choral music and spaghetti, linguini, blah blah blah.  As an Italian myself, after 10 minutes of cheesy That's Amore and inserts of sacred Florencian statues I had the urge to rush out for a nose-job and a new birth certificate.  The original film skittered enough on the precipice of artifice, but Mrs. De Laurentiis ladles so much garlicky pretentiousness and ostentation on the production that one is left more bloated and gassy than after a meal at Olive Garden.

It is now impossible for me to watch this film (and its successors) without flashbacks to this looney hack's glee over the vast wealth she has amassed exploiting and embellishing the virtues of the original Silence of the Lambs.  I had to retrieve my jaw off the floor after listening to her glibly toss off Jodie Foster's sage decision to forgo reprising her role as Clarice Starling as ""disappointing, but totally solvable"", as if swapping actors known for beloved performances was as facile as choosing Buitoni over De Cecco.  She carries herself as if she had invented the primitive zoetrope, as opposed to have simply married someone old enough to have actually done it.

This shameless PR piece is layered with a soaring, exultant score of endless arias and cellists reaching below their knees on their fretboards, apparently to imbue it with class (ala the tenors who serenade you at Macaroni Grill). And with the panoramic vistas of Florence, and handheld shots of the posh premiere (including a gorgeous spread of antipasti and Christopher Walken looking like a mafioso), one is led to believe that Hannibal is actually some De Sica masterpiece, rather than the gory, expensive splatter film it is.  How did I overlook the absurdity of Ray Liotta being fed his frontal lobes whilst Gourmet Valse Tartare was blasting on the soundtrack?

1291604,4,B00003CXSO,"This is the sequel to the first film, Silence of the Lambs.  It takes place seven years after the first film and a horribly disfigured man and his aid are interrogating a man who was an employee at the asylum where Hannibal Lecter was kept. The disfigured and crippled man is a wealthy man who in his younger days was a child molester.  Hannibal ( Anthony Hopkins) was appointed as his court appointed therapist and Hannibal left him disfigured and wheel chair bound.

The disfigured man is Mason Verger (Gary Oldman) and he is trying to find out all he can about Hannibal and Agent Clarice Starling (Julianne Moore).  At the end of the interview the asylum worker offers to sell Mason a piece of Hannibal Lecter memorabilia and he sells Hannibal's face mask for $250,000.

Agent Starling is managing a huge bust of a drug ring and the apprehension of a female habitual criminal.  When the woman walks out of the warehouse she is guarded by three men and carrying a baby in a shoulder harness.  Starling calls off the bust but one of the local cops draws his gun and a street war breaks out.  The entire operation looks bad as Starling is shown carrying away a baby covered in blood and 5 people are killed.  Since she was in charge she takes the blame for the embarrassment to the FBI and other federal agencies involved in the bust that has gone bad.

Mason Verger uses his wealth and influence at the justice department to get Starling reassigned to the recapture Hannibal Lecter.  His goal is to capture and kill Lecter as revenge for his torture, disfigurement and his being crippled......

This is a very good movie for many reasons but unfortunately it is a sequel to a super top rated Silence of the Lambs film and it was not rated as highly as it should have been because of that.  This movie is well filmed and the cinematography is just spectacular from the scenes outside of the Verger mansion to the scenes shot in Italy.  It is also a detailed and macabre story and may be too intense for some people.

The acting in this film is top notch and Julianne Moore as Clarice Starling did a wonderful job of replacing Jodie Foster in this role.  Every actor in this movie plays their role to perfection and this is what made this movie first class.

1291611,2,B00003CXSO,"Taken chronologically, Hannibal Lecter started out as a brilliant schemer in Red Dragon, refined his - ahem - tastes in Silence of the Lambs, and if the last installment is any measure, became a traditional slasher in Hannibal.

Hannibal (Anthony Hopkins) has always been the more gentlemanly of two evils.  Whether it was The Tooth Fairy in Red Dragon or Buffalo Bill in Silence of the Lambs, Lecter seemed pleasant and refined in comparison to the more brutal serial killers. This is what makes an anti-hero so much fun; he's bad, but he's not as bad as the bad guy.  The even-worse villain in Hannibal is Mason Verger (Gary Oldman), a wealthy child molester whom Hannibal convinced (through judicious application of mind-altering drugs) to cut off his own face.  A crippled, revolting shell of a man, Verger seethes with an unholy vengeance and, thanks to his immense wealth, crafts a far-fetched plan to get revenge.

And this is where the problems with Hannibal begin. Although it's clear Verger was bad - and presumably, in the Levels of Evil, we can assume molestation of children is worse than cannibalism of adults - but he simply doesn't have the physical presence of the other serial killers to justify Hannibal's own villainy.  Verger is more disgusting than vile, and the shock of the character wears off after a while. Verger's schemes border on cartoon-character levels with his plans to have Hannibal's face eaten by specially bred wild boars.  Yes, that's right - Hannibal's up against a cripple and his army of killer pigs.

The first third of the film is a cat-and-mouse game between Chief Inspector Rinaldo Pazzi (Giancarlo Giannini) and Hannibal in Florence, Italy.  This is the Hannibal we know - crawling inside his victim's heads, using their secret shame as a weapon against them, and giving morally flawed human beings their comeuppance for being so gauche. Pazzi's ending is never in doubt, but the increasingly high stakes between the two men makes for thrilling drama.

Then we're back to Clarice Starling (Julianne Moore). You'll recall that Clarice was a woman trying to make it in a man's world in Silence of the Lambs.  Forget all that - here, Starling as embodied by Moore is a delicious peach, to be ogled by the camera as it slow pans not once but twice over her body.  Since Hannibal and Starling meet only at the end of the film, director Ridley Scott uses this technique as a substitute for Hannibal's amorous intentions. It's no surprise Foster turned the role down.

The last third of Hannibal features Starling, the ridiculously corrupt Justice Department officer Paul Krendler (Ray Liotta, who looks the part), and everybody's favorite cannibal at a dinner for two.  The dinner scene only manages to be disgusting because there's not a shred of sympathy for Krendler, unlike Pazzi who had a gorgeous wife and so much to lose.  By the conclusion Hannibal is in full slasher mode, complete with the ability to silence dogs at a glance, terrorize gun-wielding victims into inaction with just a knife, and otherwise pop-up and disappear as needed for him to abduct his victims.  In short, Hannibal goes from being a three-dimensional character to a one-dimensional killer.

Conversely, Starling is a straight arrow.  So straight, in fact, that it becomes inconceivable that there's any room for romance with Hannibal.  She is polite, but frigid - her lack of connection with any other character leaves her as a cipher with about as much charm as a wax statue.  The final showdown between Starling and Hannibal, which is considerably different from the book, detracts from all the romantic opera chatter that took place in the first third of the film.  Hannibal has difficulty staying true to its convictions.

But if you know anything about the original source material, you can understand why.  Hannibal, the book, is a grand guignol of ridiculous characters and over-the-top violence.  Hannibal, the movie, is tame in comparison, but not daring enough to conclude the cannibal's movie legacy.",1308009600,2,4033,4.967261904761905
1291612,1,B00003CXSO,"Hannibal, 2001 film

The movie begins with the questioning of a man about Hannibal Lecter. What does it mean? Next we see a woman sleeping in a truck. Special Agent Starling is in charge of this raid. There is a lot of shooting and action to grab your attention. Will there be some criticisms of her actions? Good judgment? [Isn't this all too dramatic?] Starling goes to Asheville NC to listen to Mason Verger, a survivor of Hannibal (disfigured for more drama?). [More sick sensationalism?] Starling reviews some shocking video (more sensationalism). She talks to Barney to get more information. [The movie starts to drag with these flashbacks.] There is a discussion at a university. Dr. Fell replaces a missing professor. Starling gets a letter that mocks her. The FBI analyzes that letter. In Italy a detective's curiosity causes a search of the ""Most Wanted"" list.

What is the point of Krendler's behavior. We see scenes of Florence. That Italian detective has a plan to get a fingerprint. Another over-dramatic scene? Not like when they feed the wild pigs! [Anybody recognize that opera?] Starling sees the videotape. Fell has a surprise for Pazzi. ""Hello Clarisse."" Then another shocking scene! The scene shifts to the USA. A found note incriminates Clarisse; she is suspended. Will she be in danger now? [Can you believe these events?] Does the story drag again? Who is following her? There is dramatic action on the street. Clarisse sees it and reports it. A visitor is brought to Mason Verger. ""Dinner at eight."" Clarisse arrives in time. The pigs go wild, but Clarisse is rescued by an unlikely person. [The story drags again.] There is a surprise for Krendler! What is on the menu tonight? Tastes good? Does Krendler have a lot of brains? Will those police cars arrive in time? ""This will really hurt."" Fireworks in the night?

Hannibal has more lives than a wily coyote. But this terrible and horrible movie may have killed off the series. Can it get any worse? Too bad they couldn't write a better story. But how can they make a better story about a serial killer? Is there a message in showing the super-rich hiring criminals to do what lawyers can't do? Is there some opera where most of the characters die at the end? This is basically a vampire movie. All vampires are serial killers, and shown to be super-human in mind and body (until the last scenes). The sickness in this movie is how they present the murder of a cripple as a beneficial act! Is this movie as nice as Shakespeare's ""Titus Andronicus""?",1306800000,2,2525,4.773455377574371
1291681,2,B00003CXSO,"I had issues with the novel, and I have similar issues with the film.

The humanizing of Hannibal Lecter, for me, was a big mistake.  I liked the mystery that surrounded him, and the edgy compulsions that gave him such a sickeningly sinister underlining.  Sadly, `Hannibal' makes Lecter the victim and thus separates some of the fear and intrigue we feel for him.  Add to that mix the fact that the actual villain here is nowhere near as interesting or as viciously fear-inspiring as Lecter ever was and you have a complete downgrade from the Oscar winning `Silence of the Lambs'.

Ridley Scott is one of my favorite directors, for he has a boundless ability to stretch himself regardless of genre.  He actually creates some impeccable imagery, and he creates a tone that is all its own and remarkably effective in parts.  I agree that the `wild boar' sequences don't carry the weighty feeling of dread like they needed to, but I disagree that the final `dinner' sequence was a parody.  In fact, I found that scene to be the best in the film, and the delicious way that Scott played with the preposterous romanticizing of Clarice and Hannibal was downright flawless.

I do admit that I walked into this with a hinge of preconceived irritation.  I always hate it when a series replaces a prominent character with another actor or actress, and so the fact that Foster wasn't returning in the role that won her the Oscar upset me.  That isn't to say I prefer her as an actress (as much as I love `The Silence of the Lambs' I have never understood Foster's Oscar win, and I prefer Julianne Moore as an actress an infinite amount) it's just the principle of the thing.  That said; both Moore and Hopkins sizzle when needed, and so I cannot complain about the acting.

The film's overall construction and thematic impact leaves much to be desired though.  It all starts with the story, and this story needed a little more work.",1304035200,5,1921,4.628318584070796

Both are Region 2 so they won't play in a regular DVD player.

This film is a BBC Docudrama produced in 2006 and starring Alexander Siddig (Dr. Bashir from Star Trek: DS9) as Hannibal, and no one else I know except for Ben Cross (Sarek, also from Star Trek). I have never understood the use of docudramas. If you want to make a documentary, make a documentary; if you want to make a period piece, make a period piece. Combining the two does not work. It is not as accurate as a documentary or as exciting as a drama. But the BBC was quite fond of churning them out in the middle of the decade. Within a few years they threw out at least than three of them set at least partially in ancient times:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ancient-Rome-The-Rise-and-Fall-of-an-Empire/dp/B0022SFCO2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ancient Rome: The Rise and Fall of an Empire</a>, Heroes & Villains (Released in the US as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Warriors/dp/B001O2UTT0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Warriors</a>. Was the original name too confusing?), and this one. Of them all I think that this one is the most coherent. Instead of a bunch of shorter episodes dealing with different people, it spends the whole time looking at the Carthaginian general Hannibal. No, not that Hannibal. This one doesn't eat people (that we know of). Hannibal was the man who almost took down Rome itself. He crossed the Alps and brought the fight to them culminating in one of the most decisive battles the world has ever seen. Yet the Romans survived and lived to fight another day.

So, how well does it do? Historically it gets a few things wrong and compresses some events to make them fit into an hour and a half program but is very accurate on the whole. Entertainment-wise it is also very good. Some of the dialogue is clunky and phony but it doesn't distract from the story too much. The effects seem about normal for a docudrama at first. In most scenes you can tell that there are only a few dozen men playing soldiers. The battle of Ticinus features about two dozen men on each side wailing at each other with swords. That's about what I expected from the production, and it's dull. Then it reaches Cannae and everything changes. Cannae is Hannibal's big battle, the one that would define his career. He fought a Roman army that outnumbered him and managed to not only defeat it, but obliterate it killing about 50,000 men in the course of a few hours. And this film captures it just right. I really don't know how they did it. It must be CGI because they could never have afforded that many extras, but it doesn't look like any CGI work I've ever seen. It details exactly what tactics were used to win the battle and illustrates them perfectly. I don't think I've seen a better (or more accurate) battle on-screen before, with the possible exception of Oliver Stone's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alexander/dp/B000MGB6NM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alexander</a>. The battle of Zama is similarly well done with some believable elephant charges. Both of them are too short unfortunately, but that's a television budget for you. They could not have done better with what they had. A superb job.

Apart from the battles, the story's quite good since it follows the facts pretty well and the facts are pretty cool. The first part (45 minutes) covers Hannibal crossing the Alps and kinda rushes through the battles of Trebia and Trasimene (Trasimene in particular is just a voiceover with stills of dead Romans). The second half contains both of the main battles and is infinitely the better for it. Hannibal's character is portrayed somewhat inconsistently. While he starts off as a living embodiment of vengeance after Cannae he starts talking about how too much blood has been spilled and becomes a bit of a whiner. While this isn't an utterly invalid view I don't think that they handled it too well. The turnabout is too sudden and it is unconvincing to hear him talk about not taking Rome because they're not barbarians. It's not really an ancient attitude and it seems to be thrown in there to make him more sympathetic.

The casting is a bit of a problem. Siddig is great as Hannibal who comes across as both fierce and brilliant, but most of the supporting cast can't keep up. I guess there aren't many British Arabic actors to choose from which is why Hannibal's brothers look nothing alike. Then again, the Roman cast isn't much better. Cross does fine as Fabius, but the guy playing Scipio is far too old for the part. He's at least in his mid-30s and it seems strange to hear people talking about how young he is to have achieved what he did. It makes sense age-wise by Zama, but that only gives him ten minutes or so at the proper age. Hannibal should be younger too of course, but his age wasn't so significant as Scipio's since Rome had to bend all their laws to give Scipio the command. And it's also strange that a man who's most defining characteristic in his sculptures is his baldness is played by a man with far too much hair for a Roman. Most odd. But I'm nitpicking now. On the whole the film is good, the story is good, the lead performances are good, and the battles are great. The narration is only occasionally present and while it's annoying it shouldn't get in the way of enjoying the film. So check it out if you get the chance, and hopefully they'll release it in Region 1 someday.",1302998400,,5886,4.972588832487309
1291683,2,B00003CXSO,"In ""Hannibal"", I was looking for an epic battle of wits between the escaped, brilliant Hannibal and the focused, brilliant Clarice. Instead, for most of the movie we get Clouseau vs. Hannibal. At the same time Clarice is getting steadily beat down within the ranks of the FBI until she is finally put on suspension. Then we find that for some reason not well explained, Hannibal regards her in some sort of fatherly way ... though a predatory father to be sure.

While this movie had less gore than I was expecting it to, it made up for it with some very unpleasant forms of graphically displayed death. This includes not one but TWO sequences of people being eaten by hungry boars. I suppose that is fitting, since hungry bore could well describe the director and screenwriter for what essentially became a waste of time for an intelligent viewer.

Into the mix is thrown a horribly disfigured, extremely wealthy man with a grudge against Hannibal, and Hannibal didn't even exactly do the disfiguring, though he did encourage it. In the end this man's aide turns on him to gruesome result, and the motive for THAT is as thin as it gets too.

While ""Silence of the Lambs"" was riveting, this film was drivelling. Hannibal's actions were all too predictable, and the general fates of everyone involved were telegraphed virtually from the beginning of the film. After 30 years of increasingly graphic violence in film, even the ""gross out"" scenes in ""Hannibal"" brought nothing really surprising or audacious.

After the energy put into this role by Hopkins in ""Silence of the Lambs"", in ""Hannibal"" there was surprising little personality put into the character. Hopkins played him throughout as smug, thoughtful, and vindictive, but with none of the smarmy charm or sudden outbursts that in his first performance made the character engrossing if, well, gross. Moore is no Foster, either. In only a few scenes does she try to raise a real emotion, and those seem quite subdued compared to the circumstances which are meant to provoke them. Liotta brings some real reverse charm to his character, but it is so entirely unbelievable that his efforts are wasted. Even Gary Oldman is held back to smug in a mask. How do so many fine actors fail to deliver on the promise inherent in such meaty roles? I'll have to blame the director, who was evidently going for a feel that just didn't work in the finished product.

Sadly, Hannibal is likely to put you to sleep, sans nightmares.",1300147200,,2472,4.793427230046948

1291686,4,B00003CXSO,"This poor film is very much mis-understood by the public. After 10 long years, Hannibal Lecter finally returned to the big screen and he was better than ever. Director Ridley Scott truly brought the Thomas Harris Novel to life with a power house of operatic visuals coupled with poetically gory imagery.

Clarice Starling (Julianne Moore) is now ten years older and wiser. Her life is now in shambles and after the death of a colleague during a botched arrest, her strong dedication to the FBI is now challenged by her superiors. Her time is occupied mostly by hunting down the monsterous Doctor Hannibal Lecter who violated her mind in The Silence of The Lambs all those years ago. People often unfairly criticize this preformance of Moore's Starling. Moore is playing Starling as an older, wiser, hardened FBI agent. She's not the scared trainee who was easily imitated. I think this was a shock for some people because popular movie characters rarely, if ever, mature emotionally over the course of multiple films. Moore did an excellent job and still shows the vunerability of Clarice who is now trapped in her own life.

Another common complaint of this film is the gore. Sans the death of one of Mason Verger's thugs, every murder Lecter was responsible for was a work of art. Inspector Pazzi's murder was a homage to the gruesome murder of Pazzi's ancestor. Paul Krendler's feast on his own brain was a dark joke; He was being fed exactly what he did not value. Lector's leathal sense of humor is not for everyone but it's not without meaning.

The supporting cast is also terrific in this film. Gary Oldman is delightful as the severely maimed, sociopath Mason Verger. He is a sadist in the greatest sense of the word. He gleefully recounts the sexual molestation of young boys and the night Lecter assaulted him to Clarice Starling. His vengance on Hannibal entails feeding the doctor to gigantic boars who are enticed to devour their victims by using pre-recorded screaming. To quote Mason at the end of that flash back, ""That's Entertainment!"". Also rounding out the cast is the delightfully sleazy and corrupt sexist Justice Department Official Paul Krendler played by Ray Liotta. Krendler is one of those characters you watch and wait patiently to get ""his"" and as I explained earlier, all thanks to the good doctor.

As much as I enjoyed Hannibal, the main problem I had with the film was that it dosen't get into Hannibal's mind as much as Thomas Harris' brilliant novel. In the novel, we learn that Lecter long ago lost his sister named Mischa and he has reoccuring nightmares of her murder and misses her desperately. He recalls her in his mind ,referred to as his ""Memory Palace"", were he could retreat in a world that is after him. His only comfort in a world that is after him. In the film, it's not so much about Lector and more like Lector being active. Outside missing that mark ever so slightly, the film is one of Ridley Scott's masterpieces. People were expecting another thriller ala Silence of The Lambs but they came to the wrong place. Hannibal is suppose to be a horror film and it works.

One last note. Though Thomas Harris agreed that the contriversal ending the novel should not have been in the film adaptation, careful viewers will notice it was not entirely omitted.",1287014400,2,3304,4.7591623036649215

As for the movie itself, I enjoyed it very much.  ""Silence of the Lambs"" will always be my favorite of the Lecter series, but ""Hannibal"" is a close second.

I found the plot to be rather slow-moving at first, but this was partly a good thing as it took me a little time to get adjusted to Julianne Moore's portrayal of Starling (which, although quite different from Jodi Foster's, was still well-suited to the character).  Ridley Scott builds the suspense gradually and slowly, waiting for viewers to be silently begging for some real action before the plot takes off.  Once it does, you will be at the edge of your seat until the credits roll.  I found certain scenes in ""Hannibal"" to be almost more chilling than those in SOTL, and I am still reeling from the end.  The acting, as to be expected, was no less than exceptional, especially in the case of Anthony Hopkins.

Both ""Silence"" and ""Hannibal"" are works of art, though in different categories.  While ""Silence"" had an intense, gritty air, ""Hannibal's"" was graceful and smooth, although no less gruesome.  Both tones work fantastically for their genre and I love both movies.

In order to have the money to pay for Hopkins. I was wrong. She took a pass on it. IMHO, Ms. Moore barely acted @all in this. An unemotional Poker Face through most of the film.

1291772,5,B00003CXSO,"I recently watched ""Hannibal"" again and I realized I forgot how good a film this is. Directed by Ridley Scott (most famous for ""Thelma and Louise"") ""Hannibal"" stars Anthony Hopkins in the role that made him a household name. As Hannibal Lecter Mr. Hopkins is sophisticated, articulate, and most of all terrifying in his attempt to keep the FBI from recapturing him after escaping police custody in ""The Silence of The Lambs"". I'm not a fan of sequels but this movie works. With an excellent script ""Hannibal"" is one of those cinematic masterpieces both in story content and look. A lot of the film was shot in Europe and the background adds to the mood of the film. Julianne Moore replaces Jodie Foster in the Clarice Starling role and it is evident, but according to reports Foster couldn't be persuaded to return. Five minutes into the film, however, you forget a different actress is playing one of the biggest parts which is a testimony to the wonderful actress Moore is. ""Hannibal"" was also a boxoffice smash grossing over $350,000,000. This exquisite two disc set features an array of bonus features that will pleasure the most ardent Hannibal fan. Included is an alternate ending, commentary by Scott, over 35 minutes of deleted scenes, a great featurette on the making of the movie, TV Spots, and more.

Then imagine the cold heart of Dr Lecter kindle and blaze for his Nemesis and his brain, trained by years of learning, entering the game with its unabatable determination backed by an unpaired ability to calculate and anticipate.
I have first seen ""Hannibal"" then ""The silence of the lambs"", and my preference goes to the former. While the latter is an amazing thriller, the plot is quite straightforward and the pair Starling - Lecter, a ""teacher and student"" team. ""Hannibal"", however, is masterfully more ambiguous and provides a lot more to think about.
One can see this film as the comeback of Hannibal Lecter, the brilliant villain ready to defy the all-powerful FBI in order to satisfy his ego or as a thriller that holds you before the screen until the end. Fans of gore will remember the scene where the famous doctor holds a lecture on the anatomy of the brain. But when he has given you almost every reason to hate and despise him, the brilliant minded - cold hearted psychopath will say with a voice that perfectly blends determination, resignation and tenderness : ""This will really hurt""...
So is he truly the monster he is supposed to be? Wicked but ready to walk through (almost) hell for his longtime pursuer? Selfish? (You may want to reconsider this opinion at the end of the movie). And, speaking of monsters, who is the real one? The cannibal doctor or the ones ready to trespass every written and unwritten law with neither regret nor remorse, turning people into mere bait?
Lecter is, indeed, a man of contradictions. Aren't we all?
In the end, though, it's up to you. You can look at this movie as an entertaining piece of work with suspense, action and a well drawn plot, suitable to be seen once then put aside. You can also consider it as violent and cruel stuff, best avoided. Or you can choose to see it as a piece of life where meanness and cruelty stand aside righteousness, courage and hope.

Ridley Scott's dedication to making solid films and not movies really pushes Hannibal far to the forefront of anti-hero worship and in the most uncomfortable of ways that just get under every inch of your skin.

So when did it become cool to really identify and bond with these villainous anti-hero's like Dr. Hannibal Lecter? Maybe it goes back further than I can place as I write this, but not in modern film and literature has there been such a mesmerizing and indelible character that most viewers just cant seem to get enough of.

I can fully understand the brilliance of Jeff Lindsey, who knew that Thomas Harris wouldn't be able to satiate everyone's desires by writing fast enough and picked up the mantle with the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Darkly-Dreaming-Dexter/dp/0307277887/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Darkly Dreaming Dexter</a>&nbsp;series.

As for Sir Anthony, I'm sure that I speak the sentiment of most when I say that it would be good to see him reprise his role once more and it would be equally cool to see it directed by Ridley Scott.

The extras on the disc are fantastic for those looking to purchase the 2 disc version. It's well worth the money. Ridley's commentary is fascinating -- he actually states that of all his films 'this one is my favourite'. I was pretty stunned by that as I'm a big fan of Blade Runner. He probably enjoyed making Hannibal, which would be the difference of the two, as most already know, regarding Blade Runner.",1209859200,3,1889,5.503448275862069

There are some moments that aren't for the faint of heart, but if you can hold through those moments you'll find this a great movie.

1291900,4,B00003CXSO,"Having read this book twice over a two year period, reveals some kind of fascination with the main character. The novel itself is the best of the series, and the film, directed by one of my all time favourite directors, Ridley Scott, had to be a perfect combination, and Scott's artistic sensibility as a methodical director, certainly shows in this gripping film.

There is so much in this film that needs to be pointed out in terms of its artistic ""film"" qualities: all aspects - score, location, costume, art direction, screenplay adaptation and of course the impeccable performance by Anthony Hopkins.

Ridley Scott began as an art student and is well adept at pen and ink. It is known that he would show up early on location in Florence, and know one, not even the producers or Hopkins for that matter, knew what he would do next: because he would sketch the scenes in his note book at night, visualizing every scene - from the camera angles to the actors lines... for Ridley Scott, film is a real & true art form.

Hannibal is one of the more interesting characters in popular literature/culture. An anti-hero of sorts, whose main reason for killing is rude people. In other words there seems to be a method to his madness.

My wish was that the film ended in the same way as the book: much more final and chilling - which made more sense.

Agent Starling relents in the book and through Hannibal's strength of will and power takes her to the dark side, both living quite well all over the world.

However censorship is alive and well...

For Starling to relent to Hannibal's hypnosis and power, to my way of thought, this was the perfect break through for a new story...rather than the terrible novel ""Hannibal Rising"" though the film however is exceptional; the tale should have moved forward rather than to its beginnings.

Most fans disliked this film for strange reasons...though it is the best of the trilogy.",1194393600,,1921,4.679525222551929
1291901,3,B00003CXSO,"This sequel is rather pointless and lacks most of what made Lambs great.
They spent the cash and got the pros---Scott, Mamet and Hopkins---but the lynchpin of the first movie has been removed and that kills it.

Jodie Foster made you care about her; Julianne Moore does not. She's emotionally flat and quite boring, and the movie suffers greatly due to her weak performance as the character Foster made fascinating.

Hannibal is also paced far too slowly and even when it's gory, in its faux-elegant way, it's not really scary. There's little suspense and the sudden weirdness of the last 20 minutes offers no payoff. Hopkins is good but without Foster's heart to play off there's not much to make this truly worth watching. Even the cannibal moments are kinda boring.

I usually love Scott, but his grand shots are mostly lacking here and Mamet's script is too plodding to keep one entertained.

Not even close to the quality of the original; if you really love that you might want to avoid this and Hannibal Rising. They add nothing to the story.",1193356800,,1048,4.741758241758242
1291902,5,B00003CXSO,"Silence of the Lambs is one of my all time favorite movies.  I really liked and was impressed by Red Dragon, but this film is one of the best!  I missed Jodie Foster as Clarice Starling, at first, but Julianne Moore's portrayal was excellent!  I was pleasantly surprised by this movie.  Anthony Hopkins, again as Dr. Hannibal Lector, was superb!

This movie started out with a scene that was powerful and lured you into the rest of the plot.  F.B.I. Agent Clarice Starling is placed on restrictions and has to more or less take on finding Hannibal Lector after his escape.  She meets his only survivor and fourth victim, Mason Verger (a wealthy pedophile), played by Gary Oldman, because he reported he has more information on Lector.  Verger is severely deformed from maiming himself at Lector's request.  Verger is a bit odd and this only adds to the excitement of the movie.  Lector is hiding out in Italy. An Italian cop who overhears agent Starling's request for a tape, decides he wants to capture Lector himself to claim the reward.  Things go worse for Starling and she has to turn in her badge and weapons, pending an investigation.  At this point she is drawn in to find Lector.  The rest of the movie is so action packed, I didn't even realize that this is over 2 hours long!  This has plenty suspense, action and gore, yes, gore!

It doesn't have the same gut level horror as Silence of the lambs, but there are nevertheless some nerve shredding moments.
The cast are all good and if Julianne Moore isn't quite as good as Jodie Foster, shes very close.
The other reason this film is a success is because of director Ridley Scott. The settings in Florence are stunning and the whole look of the film is great. Ridley Scott always had a great eye for visuals!
OK so the very end is a bit unlikely, but this film will keep you entertained, and holds up to repeated viewings. You should be able to pick this up cheap now, if so buy it!",1188259200,,656,4.256
1291904,3,B00003CXSO,"I was pleasantly surprised by Ridley Scott's ""Hannibal"" given that the movie is based on the horrible book which I more than dislike. I see a writer as a God - he creates by the power of his imagination the new worlds and populates them with his creatures. Once, he created the world, he should give his characters free will; they should act by the logic of their personalities not by their creator's sheer caprice. What Harris did in ""Hannibal"" is unspeakable - he just showed his fans how much he despised them. Actually, he did two things wrong - the ending and his attempt to explain Hannibal, to look behind the mask. The film comparing to the book has several redeeming values: visually, it is a stunning work of a great director. I am yet to see Florence, the celebrated City of Flowers as dark, dangerous, and anti-tourist as in ""Hannibal"". Second, the movie did not try to ""explain"" Hannibal, to get inside his head and understand him. Harris attempted in the book to give us the reasons why Hannibal was what he was - it was weak and laughable. If he chose to present Hannibal as some sort of supernatural creature with almost animals' instincts, he should've left him as an eternal mystery. The best description of Hannibal belongs to Clarice. When asked, ""Is it true what they're sayin', he's some kinda vampire?"" - she replied, ""They don't have a name for what he is"". And finally, the film avoided the literally vomit-inducing, absurd, irrational, obnoxious slap in face book's ending - for this alone I think ""Hannibal"" is a very decent movie and a lot of fun.

1291905,4,B00003CXSO,"I'm reviewing this movie as it stands on it's own rather than how it fits into the series.

In this installment, we meet Mason Verger, who is the sole survivor of the good Dr Lechter.  Verger is a strange character with a strange story.  His intentions are fairly clear from the outset, leaving the viewer only to watch how things unfold.

The movie remains fairly interesting throughout, as the escaped Lechter is identified and opposing forces close in on him.  The table is set, however, about an hour in when we see Lechter dispatch his first would-be apprehender with a touch of ""historical flair"".

Lechter and Clarice are soon after back in touch again and the time finally comes where they meet and communicate without the glass between them. So we have Verger with retribution at heart, Clarice with justice in her interest and Lechter with his usual intentions: a tasty recipe indeed, with a main course as bizarre as you will come to expect.

This is a must-see for fans of the original and fans of the series in general.",1186617600,,1032,4.668508287292818

To me, all this movie accomplished was gore & digust.  What a shame that such a spectacular actor (Hopkins) agreed to lower himself and the character to this level.  In my opinion, people should have been offered top dollar to waste their time and view this thing.",1185667200,2,417,4.671232876712328
1291908,3,B00003CXSO,"I really liked ""The Silence Of The Lambs"" with Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster in the famous roles of ""Dr. Hannibal Lecter"" and ""Agent Clarice Starling"". The characters and the lines were penned out great, and it was also directed very well, which ultimately led it to win best picture as well as several other academy awards.

  However, the sequel is still good, but it is a little bit dissapointing. Hannibal has escaped and he is living in Italy. Ever since the last time, Clarice Starling encountered Hannibal, he has in a way cast a spell on her. She comments saying(""I think about him for 30 seconds every day""). She isn't doing so well, she is asked to take time off from her job of being a cop, mainly because Clarice messed up an investigation. Hannibal is still living his life, he is very interested in art and he does teach a seminar to other people.

  However, his moves have not flawed at all. He still has hunger to kill and eat people. A man who is in a wheelchair, desperately wants to catch Hannibal, mainly because he caused him to have a disfigured face. The story goes on and on, finally Hannibal decides to come out of his shell and he arrives in America.

 Before, I continue. I must inform you that Jodie Foster, although she seemed interested in the beginning to reprise her role, she turned it down and gave various reasons. She was apparently concerned about how the character was going to be depicted in the sequel, after she read the book, and after she learned that Jonathan Demme, would not return to direct the film. Julianne Moore beat out several other actresses including Ashley Judd and Helen Hunt to the role after several auditions. I felt that she wasn't that convincing to begin with. The character, as Foster feared was not depicted well.

 There is a lot of violence, that creates the fear allusion and leads up to its climatic ending. It is a good sequel.",1185148800,,1901,4.564705882352941

1292008,3,B00003CXSO,"Julianne Moore is a phenomenal actress in other movies, but for some reason didn't bring the character of Clarice Starling to life on the silver screen for ""Hannibal"". Her portrayal of Clarice Starling was extremely flat and dead compared with Jodie Foster's performance of Clarice Starling in ""Silence of the Lambs"". So, I was sorely disappointed not to see Jodie Foster return to play the role of Clarice Starling in this movie as she gave a vibrant portrayal of this character.

I've also read the book ""Hannibal"" by Thomas Harris and was completely disappointed that the filmmakers of ""Hannibal"" didn't keep the ending of the movie in line with that of the novel. The ending of ""Hannibal"", the movie version, felt empty and hollow without the original ending for which the author had intended.

Plus other aspects of the storyline were a bit off too. Had ""Hannibal"", the movie version, had Jodie Foster playing Clarice Starling and other aspects of the movie, like the ending, been more accurate to the novel, I would have given it a higher rating.",1182902400,,1052,4.871508379888268

1292012,5,B00003CXSO,"Anthony Hopkins returns as one of the great villains in screen history, Hannibal ""The Cannibal"" Lecter, in this riveting sequel to The Silence of the Lambs. Lecter's only surviving victim, the hideously scarred Mason Verger (Gary Oldman), tries to draw the serial gourmet out of hiding using the one person he cares about: Clarice Starling (Julianne Moore). Now, the novel on which this film was based had a slow pace and was nice and lengthy. If the film tried to be exactly like the book, it would have been at least 3 hours long, maybe longer. I would have enjoyed watching it. I thought the acting was excellent. Most of what's essential in the book in kept in the movie, though reading it ahead of time makes everything a little clearer. I was glad to see Ray Liotta here( specialy the brain eating scene lol, turned some peoples head!), and I thought Julianne Moore did a great job as Agent Starling. This film has almost ""A Clockwork Orange"" mentality as it appears to celebrate Hannibal's evil. True, Hannibal is always witty and polite, regardless of what terrible thing he is doing. The film is expectedly grotesque, which never bothers me. Hannibal is truly a different type of film than ""Silence of the Lambs""; if you're looking for that, you should probably see ""Red Dragon"" instead (also good). My biggest complaint is the change they made to the ending of the story, which in the book was far more disturbing. And I'd like to say that Ridley Scott's direction isn't quite as suited to the material as Jonathan Demme's. Good and effective, but read the novel if you really want to get freaked out. I still recommend every one to watch hannibal if you haven't yet. Its truly a great movie. Also The music selected for this film was all that one would expect for such a thrilling screenplay, exciting, touching, unobtrucive and atmospheric. The highpoint for me was the scene at the Opera which left me spellbound. So delightful was the piece that I hummed it for days afterwards. The thrill was boosted by my finding out that a fellow Irishman, whom I had met often around Dublin over the past few years, Patrick Cassidy, hed written ""Vide Cor Meum"" especially for the scene. Woe of woes! I had hoped that it was an Opera which I could buy the next day. The good news is that the piece is featured on this soundtrack and Patrick is rumoured to be incorporating the piece into a forthcoming Operatic work. I can only commend you to his exceptional talent, recordings of which are available from Amazon and hope that you too will await the new work with my baited breath.

Hans Zimmer seems to be the composer of the moment in Hollywood, and why not? His score for ""Hannibal"" further proves that when he's on, he's really on -- his score for ""Hannibal"" is more entertaining than the film it has been written for, not to mention more haunting, scary and beautiful. But along with being a popular film composer comes the wrongheaded ideas that often get forced upon film soundtracks. Why are there dialogue snippets here? Sure, Anthony Hopkins is a wonderful actor and I love to hear his voice, but not when the music he is speaking over is superior to the film! Most dialogue tracks on soundtracks are annoying, and these are no different. Two big releases raped Zimmer's music in this fashion in the same year (remember ""More Music from Gladiator""?). That being said, this is top-notch work from Zimmer and collaborator Patrick Cassady. Especially wonderful is the final track, an original operatic piece with a libretto taken from the writings of Dante Aligheri. Absolutely astonishing music in that last cut.",1169164800,10,3621,4.720379146919432

(c) where are Margot Verger, the cattle prod and the eel?

(b) the rewritten ending! Having read Hannibal before seeing the movie, I was totally PO'ed at the (poorly) rewritten ending that to me completely disemboweled the original premise. I was left feeling short-changed.

It seemed to me that this film did not have anything to add - afterall, how can you surpass ""Silence""? - so it just got more graphically grotesque, in particular the final cooking scene.  Then Lector is so brazen and nonchalant, toying with those who are pursuing him and barely escaping, that it is unconvincing.

Clarice develops, as she is older and disillusioned.  Moore is a truly wonderful actress, so empathetic and believable.  It really is a pity that the script is so weak, as this could have been a great film based more on her - and the way her career is messed up - than Hopkins cunning and skill at killing (and eating).  The addition of Oldman does not fail completely, but his personality is somewhat undeveloped, though the way he lures Lector to him is quite subtle.

So this film has its good moments, just not nearly as good as it could have been with a better script.

1292070,4,B00003CXSO,"I have to say, it took me a while to getting around to seeing this.  I thought ""Silence Of The Lambs"" was good - it featured a great performance by Anthony Hopkins, and the rest of it was....good.  But that was about it, as far as I was concerned.  It just didn't really click with me, and it wasn't anything near the great movie I'd been hoping for, so when its sequel was released I didn't feel any great need to rush out and get it as soon as it was released.  A bit surprisingly though, I thought ""Hannibal"" was really great once I finally did see it.  Everyone said it was more geared toward horror than ""Silence..."" (which is fine by me) and it may have been, marginally.  But much more than that, it was just a Better horror movie than its predecessor, and it was also a better thriller and a better drama movie, in my opinion.  Hopkins is just as good, if not better, than he was as Dr. Hannibal Lecter the first time around, and while I usually don't like recasting roles in a movie (unless the actor or actress is playing a creature or monster or something where you don't see their real face or hear their real voice, and even there they sometimes end up getting the mannerisms wrong) Julianne Moore did a great job stepping into the Clarice Starling role originally played by Jodie Foster.

  The movie centers around the hunt to find Lecter by the only victim of his original, pre-incarceration, carnage to survive - a thoroughly despicable pedophile who avoided ever being charged for his crimes by cutting a deal with prosecutors to give evidence against Lecter.  It seems like ""Hannibal"" has changed tract from ""Silence"" and is implying that most if not all of Lecter's victims May have been horrendous individuals who in some way brought his wrath down upon themselves.  Whether that's the truth or whether it was just this one victim who was so reprehensible, the effect was to create a foil for Hannibal who's even more evil than he is.  Hannibal Lecter himself is, well, he's not a 'good guy' in this movie; he is, though, presented in very cryptic shades of grey.  His behaviors contradict one another but do so in a way that feels real, and he's much more interesting as a character this time around.  Clarice also is; she comes across here as a character who's somehow traumatized, perhaps even mentally unbalanced, deep down but supresses it so well that it took a genius like Lecter to ever see it, and that's what so intrigued him in the first place.  One possible interpretation of things overall (and this is just one of many potential takes on it; the movie briefly and subtly hints at so many different things that you could take away just about anything from it - making it a great source of conversation for movie-lovers) is that Hannibal Lecter is a person who had/has the potential for great goodness within himself but chose evil, while Clarice Starling has the potential for great darkness and Hannibal-level violence in her, but chose to be good, chose in fact to make her career in opposing those who give in to the same darkness.  A lot of food for thought in this one (no pun intended).

  Great performances all around; in notable addition to Hopkins and Moore the brilliant Gary Oldman plays Lecter's nemesis and the chronically overlooked and under-rated Ray Liotta plays an unlikable, rather creepy FBI agent who's constantly at odds with Starling.  A very, very engaging and wel-made movie.",1146009600,4,3435,4.626029654036244
1292071,5,B00003CXSO,"Most people hate this film; I love it....well, 95 percent of it, anyway.

The shame of it is that most people only remember the last 10 minutes, a totally gruesome scene in which the top of a man's head is cut off and he's fed a morsel of his own brain. Of course, it's disgusting and I don't find it easy to watch, either.

However, the first two hours of the film offers a feast, if you'll pardon the pun, for the eyes and ears that is not revolting except for one other three-second shot. This is one of the most beautifully-filmed movies I've ever seen and this DVD is fantastic.  Scene after scene is just jaw dropping and features some of the best shots, outside and inside, of Florence, Italy, you could ever imagine. Ridley Scott is known for his stylish direction and that is certainly the case here.

The dialog is fascinating, led by Anthony Hopkins' famous ""Hannibal Lecter"" character, whose vocabulary and intelligent sarcasm and baiting are clever and entertaining to hear. Unlike ""Silence Of the Lambs,"" there is little verbal crudeness in this film, very little profanity at all. On the third viewing, I played this with the English subtitles on, so I could catch all the dialog.

Although Jodie Foster performed well in the role of FBI Agent Clarice Starling, I preferred watching and listening to Julianne Moore play the part in this film. A ""sleeper"" here, too, was the great performance by Giancarlo Gianni, as the greedy Italian lawman, who winds up paying a huge price for his avarice.

It's hard not to compare her to Foster in this movie but it doesn't take away from this wonderful thriller. Great horror and violence in this one! as we see Lecter re-emerge in Italy. But this time, someone else has it in for Lecter and Starling is now on the case, trying to locate Lecter. Alot of violence and blood in this one! It will truly keep you entertained from beginning to end. Very well done! Very well written! and truly delivers as the sequel to Silence Of The Lambs!!! A must see for Lecter fans!!",1141344000,,1026,4.551351351351351

However the graphic depiction of the macabre subject matter and the extraordinarily graphic murders are positively sickening.  One really should avoid this movie at all costs.  Those persons who are finding psychological insights or other redeeming social value in this movie should really take a long look in the mirror and/or schedule some much needed therapy.  It is without a doubt the most perverted and sickening movie I have ever seen.  The key word here is ""sickening.""",1137715200,4,603,5.164948453608248

The poor treatment of the subject matter made the tense scenarios that thrilled me in the book into laughably vague and sometimes unbelieveble scenes in the movie. And our dear Mr. Hopkins played it a bit too sinister this time around. Would Dr. Lecter behave so obviously when he was trying to evade capture?? Disappointing.,1136246400,3,378,4.8307692307692305
1292134,5,B00003CXSO,"""Hannibal"" is a film that many reviewers have mixed opinions on. Some call it a worthy if inferior sequel to ""The Silence Of The Lambs"", while others say it doesn't serve to share the name Hannibal Lecter. I, however, am going to opt with the former category. While nowhere near as good as ""The Silence Of The Lambs"", I still found ""Hannibal"" to be highly enjoyable.

The best way to view ""Hannibal"" is as a stand alone film. Despite a few references to the previous film, the only real similarity to the film is that the character of Hannibal Lecter (played brilliantly once more by Anthony Hopkins) is in it. Yes, Clarice Starling does indeed return (played here by Julianne Moore, who makes for a servicable replacement for Jodie Foster), but she is a very different character in this film. She is much more vulnerable and afraid this time around, thanks to a series of tragic events in her personal life.

The film picks up 10 years after the events of ""TSOTL"". The notorious killer Hannibal ""The Cannibal"" Lecter has taken solace in Venice, where he works at an art museum. His life seems to be going well. Thousands of miles away, things are going just the opposite for FBI agent Clarice Starling. After a drug bust goes terribly wrong, a public backlash against Clarice breaks out, causing disdain for her within the bureau, especially with the smarmy Paul Krendler (Ray Liotta, who is somewhat wasted in his role). However, Clarice gets a chance when Mason Verger (an uncredited Gary Oldman, whose wonderful acting abilities become buried beneath his overdramatic makeup job), Hannibal's only surviving victim, offers Clarice new info on Hannibal's whereabouts. Turns out Verger is not the only one interested in Clarice, as the good doctor himself is willing to reconnect with his old friend. There is another one who's interested in Lecter. Italian police officer Pazzi (Giancarlo Giannini) has learned that there is $ 3, 000, 000 reward for the capture of Doctor Lecter, and is out to get it. Of course, his plan backfires, and an encounter with the good doctor leaves him a little, er, hung over. Lecter then returns to the United States to catch up with Miss Starling, who has been suspended from the force. This leads to an intense cat and mose game between Starling and Lecter. Mr. Verger, of course, has plans of his own as well. He enlists Krendler and his men to kidnap Lecter and feed him to a pack of wild boars. Clarice manages to rescue Doctor Lecter from a most terrible fate, and Lecter returns the favor with a candlelight dinner. Also present is Mr. Krendler. What happens to Mr. Krendler is not worth explaining in words. In the end, Dr. Lecter escapes once more, and the ending will leave you with shivers down your spine.

While nowhere near as good as ""The Silence Of The Lambs"", ""Hannibals"" still serves up some genuine chills. In fact, while I do consider the previous film the better of the two, I do consider ""Hannibal"" the more disturbing one, mostly because director Ridley Scott upped the gore factor considerably. The performances are rich and full of life. Hopkins is once again perfect as Dr. Lecter. The film does have some flaws though. For starters, Ray Liotta, as I said earlier, is wasted as Krendler. Also, Gary Oldman, while an amazing actor, doesn't get the chance to show off his abilites as the audiences focuses too much on his makeup job, which is very over the top and could've been toned down. (Personally, I would have liked to have seen what Christopher Reeve, who was originally offered the part, could've done in the role).

The dvd is crammed with extras. The film is great and I highly recommend to most people, though if you're squeamish, I suggest skipping it.",1136160000,3,3722,4.739197530864198

Cast:  Anthony Hopkins, Julianne Moore, Giancarlo Giannini, Gary Oldman, Ray Liotta, Frankie Faison, Francesca Neri, Zeljko Ivanek, Hazelle Goodman.

Running Time:  131 minutes

Rated R for strong gruesome violence, some nudity and language.

When ""Hannibal"" was in the process of being made, it seemed like it was going to be a thrilling exciting follow up to the Oscar-winning, highly acclaimed ""The Silence of the Lambs"".  Hopkins was back as Lector, Ray Liotta was to play the obnoxious Paul Krendler, Gary Oldman was the severely distorted and disabled Mason Verger and the film was being directed by the recent Oscar-winning director Ridley Scott (for ""Gladiator""). Although Foster turned down the role of Clarice again, it went to Julianne Moore which seemed an astute move by the film crew.  Unfortunately, ""Hannibal"" turns into a campy shockfest more concerned with orchestrating gory death scenes than actually creating a tense, atmospheric adaptation of Thomas Harris's critically supportive third installment of the Hannibal Lecter novel series.

Clarice Starling (Julianne Moore) is now famous for her work with Hannibal ""the Cannibal"" Lecter (Anthony Hopkins), the notorious killer who has since escaped to Venice. After a bloody drug bust resulted in a mother being shot while holding her child, Starling is tormented by her co-workers and various other people. Meanwhile, Mason Verger (Gary Oldman) is hunting down Lecter in hopes for revenge. Verger is the only victim to have encountered Hannibal and survive, but he's horribly disfigured from the experience and has become obsessed with Lecter. While all of this is happening, Lecter is living the good life in Venice, becoming a very respectable yet creepy fellow. Things become complicated though when Inspector Pazzi (Giancarlo Giannini) finds out who he really is. Verger tells Starling that he may know where the great cannibal is and this sets things into motion. Now with co-worker Paul Krendler (Ray Liotta) breathing down her neck, Clarice revisits her experiences with Hannibal and starts to contact Pazzi. Unknown to her, Verger has paid Pazzi a hefty sum of money in order to catch Lecter alive. After the failed attempt resulted in a gory manner, Lecter comes back to America to visit Clarice and break the silence.  Julianne Moore made little impression with her portrayal of Starling though that`s through little fault of her own because it`s always the most difficult job of an actor playing a role made famous by someone else , and Starling is sidelined in much of the film . As for the other actors, Hopkins is competent but by no means spell binding , Liota gives the impression that a robot played his role throughout the film, Giancarlo Giannini is good, but Gary Oldman absolutely steals the show as Mason Verger playing the role just the right side of camp complete with some great make-up .

As for the other aspects of ""Hannibal"", Ridley Scott directs with an almost operatic touch.  You really do get the feeling watching this that Scott`s ambition in life is to do a remake of ""Amadeus"" with Hopkins in the role of Atonio Salieri; however, the one major flaw with ""Hannibal"" is the script by Mamet and Zaillian, only moderately staying true to the book and deviating from the original components that made ""Silence of the Lambs"" so efficient and engrossing, especially with the ending which is riducously over the top .  Despite Scott's ability to make a visually stunning and intriguing film, we are still left with a lack of narrative thrust, so that while individual scenes, particularly those depicting Lecter at large in a gothically-rendered Florence of shadows and fog, have a certain fascination, they don't really join up to make a satisfying whole. Besides which, Anthony Hopkins does not seem to have re-discovered the inimitable creepiness as Lecter that he nailed in ""Lambs"". It seems that uncaged, Lecter lacks the coiled menace of his earlier incarnation, and Hopkins seems to have merely turned up to collect his paycheck this time round. Possibly the biggest problem with ""Hannibal"", however, is the absence of Jodie Foster. Into her shoes steps Julianne Moore, a fine actress in her own right, but a calm, almost ethereal presence where Foster was pugnacious, edgy and brittle. Foster defined the role, and Moore has a thankless task made all the more difficult by a script that gives her little to do but react to the machinations of the corrupt men that surround her.  A major letdown from a big-time director and a usually solid group of cast members.",1136073600,,4593,5.072944297082228
1292136,3,B00003CXSO,"The main problem with this second entry in the Lechter series is that is has no focus and it doesn't use the Lechter/Starling relationship to its fullest.  Director Ridley Scott has opted to create a noirish, somewhat gory film whose script wanders around a little too much.  In the ten years since SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, Lechter has found refuge in Florence, taking over as curator of an art museum; meanwhile, Starling has continued with the FBI, reaching the point where her actions are questioned; she's even received a letter from the Guiness Book of World Records for being the female who has killed the most people.  Add to this the character of Mason Vergis, Lechter's fourth victim and only survivor who peeled off his face at Lechter's request and who now wants to use Starling to lure out Lechter so he can get his revenge.  As if this isn't enough plot, we get an Italian detective who stumbled on to Lechter and wants to get the three million dollar reward offered by Vergis.  HANNIBAL suffers inevitably from being too plot driven and sources indicate screenwriter David Mamet's original script was completely overhauled, although Mamet's name is still in the credits.  Anthony Hopkins continues to instill a strong sense of evil and menace, although this time he is somewhat overdrawn, almost to the point of parody.  Julianne Moore who stepped in when Jodie Foster opted out due to script differences, brings a different approach to Starling, although I'm not sure it's a good one.  Ray Liotta is menacing as a corrupt government official, and his last scenes are grand guignol horror; an uncredited Gary Oldman is lost behind the makeup of Vergis, while Italian superstar Giancarlo Giannini brings a good sense of desperation and greed to his role as the Italian detective.  There is sumptuous photography and New Age artist Hans Zimmer's score is appropriate, but HANNIBAL ends up being mere eye candy and is not as good as the other two films.",1129680000,6,1961,4.864864864864865
1292137,4,B00003CXSO,"After huge critical success with ""The Silence of the Lambs"" in 1990 it was really surprising that MGM didn't rush to throw a sequel together to cash in on this new archvillain that had been immortalized by Anthony Hopkins, in Dr. Hannibal Lecter.  Thankfully, Hollywood showed restraint and instead of trying to write a sequel based on characters created by terrific psychological/suspense writer, Thomas Harris, and risking the destruction of a franchise, the sequel would not be put to film until writer Thomas Harris finished writing the sequel, ""Hannibal"".  By waiting Hollywood and MGM Studios were given a terrific starting point for their screenplay, this one taken directly from the creator's head instead of merely guessing what the author had in mind for the further crimes of Hannibal 'the Cannibal' Lecter.

""Hannibal"" is set approximately 10 years after the events of ""The Silence of the Lambs"", Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) is still on the FBI's most wanted list, but continues to flourish in Europe under an assumed name, while working as a musuem curator.  Sadly, FBI agent Clarice Starling (Julianne Moore took the part after Jodie Foster chose not to return) has not had as successful of a career in the FBI as she had hoped.  In truth, after Lecter assisted Clarice in bringing the killer ""Buffalo Bill"" to justice in the last movie, she really hasn't had a really successful case, leaving many to wonder is Clarice Starling really FBI material or does she need the evil Dr. Lecter to assist her in solving crimes.  Lecter, it seems, is aware of Clarice's fall from FBI grace, and seeks to exploit this weakness by baiting Clarice to come after him in Europe.  Is Clarice only a few steps away from bringing one of the most notorious murderers of all time to justice, or merely a pawn in one of his twisted mind games?

""Hannibal"" delivered a sequel to audiences that gave both thrills and chills.  Though a different tone and type of a movie than ""The Silence of the Lambs"" which was more cerebral, ""Hannibal"" was made to be more of a chase movie, than a psychological game.  Many critics felt that this was where director Ridley Scott (Gladiator) messed up, he should have stuck to the cerebral side of the characters, or left the movie alone completely.  In my opinion this was a great way to end the story that was started in ""The Silence of the Lambs"" between Clarice and Hannibal.  This movie didn't need to be so intensely cerebral, because the previous film covered that angle, for this movie to succeed Clarice needed to take matters into her own hands and attempt to bring Hannibal to justice.  Where critics are wrong is in the fact that, though not as intensely psychological, Hannibal does play mind games throughout the movie in very intriguing and interesting ways, giving audiences enough story and drama to propel the chase onward, and keep them on the edge of their seats.

One thing critics and audiences can agree on is that the acting is terrific in this film, as it has been throughout the entire series of films.  Anthony Hopkins shined once again as the psychotic Hannibal Lecter, and Julianne Moore filled the role of Clarice Starling in a very believable way, where Jodie Foster portrayed Clarice as a more naive, impressionable young cadet, Julianne delivered a colder, more world-weary agent of the FBI.  Though I missed Jodie Foster, I respect her decision to opt out of returning to a character that propelled her even farther into superstardom, but since she didn't feel the character was the same person she knew from ""The Silence of the Lambs"" she may not have done as good of a job interpreting Clarice for this movie, so it was probably a wise decision on her part after all.

Overall, ""Hannibal"" is a great ending to what was started in ""The Silence of the Lambs"", though it's not as good as its predecessor, it still is an incredibly worthy sequel, and should not be missed.

""Hannibal"" is rated R for violence and language.",1127606400,,3985,4.792700729927008
1292138,5,B00003CXSO,"This movie is by far better than the rest of the Silence series. It is not just a pure ""horror"" movie. It is much more than that, most notably a deep, dark Romance story which makes it better than the rest of the movies in the trilogy.

I love this movie. It portrays the beauty of Italy (I have been to Florence and it is just as beautiful as the film portrays it to be), the intelligence of Lecter which is one of the best characters ever created, and complexity of a very beautiful romance.

The best facet of this movie though is the subtle love story. I am not a romance fan, but this movie is the crowning achievement of romance stories.

1292139,4,B00003CXSO,"I thoroughly enjoyed this one.  A tale of revenge on the part of one of Hannibal's former patients, and a tale of redemption for Julianne Moore's Clarice Starling, this film works on these polit levels and more.  The setting of most of the film, in Italy, lends a feeling of dramatic tragedy and is well-served by its inclusion in this movie.  If the movie has weakness, it may be the dullness of the inter-office politics int he beginning of the film (though, yes, I know that it is an important component in establishing her motivations for the rest of the film).  Also, the movei could have left out the unrequited romance between Starling and her FBI boss, played by Ray Liotta.

For thsoe who keep score, if I had to rank them I'd say Silence of the Lambs, Hannibal, then Red Dragon (a remake of the original Manhunter).

Just by way of background, and while other reviewers seems to prefer to reveal much of the story and plot, I think that sort of ruins the film in many cases.  So, you'll want to look for other reviews and reviewers if that is what you are looking for...",1125792000,3,1080,4.451776649746193

Julianne Moore had some big shoes to fill trying to match Jodie Foster's performance as Clarice Starling.  She fell far short of what I would have liked to have seen.

I must say this movie is better than the book.  It felt as though Thomas Harris had a deadline to meet and he rushed out a sloppy product.  I think while doing research in Italy he stopped for some absinth in the Czech Republic.  While researching in the U.S. he stopped in the woods of West Virginia for some moonshine.  I feel sorry for the producer because he was given so little to work with and thankfully changed the ending.

The premise behind this movie is that Hannibal is living the good life in Italy with a museum curator job that fits his tastes (well most of them).  He is discovered and put on the run again.  He is subsequently hunted by Verger, a former patient and victim of his.  Verger wants to see Hannibal eaten by a bunch of pigs, I guess he couldn't get the sharks with laser beams either.

This movie is not a thriller of any sort.  It goes out of its way to find disgusting scenes.  Where the Red Dragon and Silence of the Lambs used the viewer's imagination this film puts it all on the screen.

1292142,5,B00003CXSO,"This is a brilliantly executed film, made from a novel that was pretty good but ran away a bit at the end.

Julianne Moore steps up to a tough role transfer with aplomb. She is steady as the compass needle, as was Jodie Foster in the original Starling role. Foster's dramatis persona was bit more shakably vulnerable & close to the surface than Moore's. Julianne uses a more subverted emotional sensitivity... her Starling is less prarie-sweet and more stolidly defiant. It works well and the action is written around this.

Gary Oldman is creepily endearing as a surviving Hannibal victim who wants to save face in an elaborate act of revenge. His Mason Verger has some crackerjack performances delivered with Oldman's unusual skill for making simple dialogue lines quite memorable.

And of course Hopkins' utterly magnetic Dr. Hannibal personality is again vastly enjoyable, almost to the pitch of wishing we could know someone so interesting and cultured in real life. But... perhaps better to keep all one's parts instead.

And if Florence does not win your heart, does it yet beat in thy breast? There is much visual beauty throughout this top-shelf Ridley Scott's work. Watch the DVD extras to learn a great deal about he refined the film, by leaving some things out.",1120780800,,1273,4.934579439252336
1292222,5,B00003CXSO,"If you're expecting another ""Silence of the Lambs"", then look elsewhere. This is a ""sui generis"" film, unlike its predecessor and the one that came afterwards. Thank God that Jodie Foster turned down the part of Clarice Starling for this film, because it forced the producers to think things over. They re-worked the script and what they came up with is brilliant. The plot has been covered elsewhere, so what I'm going to do is to offer some food for thought. Just notice:

- the contrast between pure Hannibal horror and the exquisite classical beauty of Florence, where a great part of the story unfolds.

- the parallels with the Bible and the relationship between Jesus and Judas. Of course, Hannibal (pure evil) reverses the usual standpoint and identifies himself with Good (an angel of darkness presenting himself as an angel of light.) Inspector Pazzi in Florence, who betrays Hannibal for a reward, becomes Judas and finds the same death.

- Remember the story when Jesus cast the demons into a herd of swine? Well, that's exactly what the persecutors of Hannibal (Mason Verger in collaboration with Inspector Pazzi) are trying to do. Of course, it doesn't work. Another reversal.

- The brilliant and horrific cannibalistic insinuations to Inspector Pazzi's wife from Dante(Could he daily feel a stab of hunger for her and find nourishment in the very sight of her? I think so.)

- Of course, the attraction between Hannibal and Clarice. Why? Clarice is the exact opposite of Hannibal. She is shown as pure and good. She makes the world more interesting. When Pazzi is killed, she bursts into tears because she wasn't able to avert it. When Clarice is unfairly defamed and rejected by the FBI, Hannibal says to her :""...would they have you back, you think? The FBI? Those people you despise almost as much as they despise you. Would they give you a medal, Clarice, do you think? Would you have it professionally framed and hang it on your wall to look at and remind you of your courage and incorruptibility? All you would need for that, Clarice, is a mirror.""

- The breathtaking ending: Does evil have any power over love and true goodness?

- The soundtrack is fantastic. The climax in the end (Hannibal and Clarice in the kitchen) is complemented perfectly by a Mahlerian-like adagio. This is probably the most beautiful love scene I've ever seen.

Comparisons are odious, so I won't compare Julianne Moore to Jodie Foster. Moore is brilliant in this film and perfect for the role.

This film is brilliant in all respects. Ridley Scott has given us another masterpiece.

I watched this film after reading the book. The book was average but not at all as good as the brilliant silence of the lambs. This movie was a big dissapointment to me because after watching the silence of the lambs, I expected another masterpiece. But, I was wrong. Red Dragon was actually much better than this also.
But, this movie isn't at all bad, it's a descent movie, better than a lot that I have seen, but after the two others in the series, it was a letdown. Hopkins was of course at his best, and Julliane Moore did well as a replacement for Foster, but Foster was still better. Gary Oldman was also very good as Mason Verger. Hannibal is loose in this film and Clarice Starling and the FBI are trying to hunt him down. Of course, there are many great scenes in this movie, but it fell short of amazing. The ending was very good though, and was much better than Harris's ending.
The difference between the silence of the lambs and this is that while the silence of th lambs is creepy because of the cinmatography, Jane Gumb's and Hannibal Lector's characters, and true suspense, this one repulses you by throwing horrifying and disturbing images on the screen. There's a big difference there as you can see.
If you liked the silence of the lambs, you'll like this, but you won't love it. But, it is a better movie than the book was. The book was more of a dissapointment, but this movie tried its hardest to turn an average book into a remarquable movie. It ended up being a little short of great, but ended up still being a good movie, that is recommended for fans of the series.",1119312000,,1608,4.381270903010034

Another plus was the haunting performance given by Gary Oldman.  I can't help but think that this film would have been award bound if Foster had agreed to reprise her role as Starling.  While Moore did an admirable job different people playing the same role only works on stage.  Ridley Scott's direction is, as always, astounding(I'm still irked by his inexcusable loss to Soderbergh in 2000).

Hannial is even better the second time around as you are less shocked and more capable of noticing the nuances each actor brings to their roles.  I still don't understand how Anthony Hopkins didn't at least get another Oscar nod.

If you saw The Silence of the Lambs you should at least rent Hannibal, if only to see Hopkins as the good doctor.  Also, for you sickos out there Hannibal has one of the most disturbing endings ever in a widely released theatrical film.

1292226,1,B00003CXSO,"Hannibal (Ridley Scott, 2001)

Really, the first question you have to ask yourself is, ""what were these people thinking?"" Four-time Oscar nominee Julianne Moore, Oscar winner Anthony Hopkins, Oscar nominee Giancarlo Giannini, critical darling Gary Oldman (who should have already won at least two Oscars by now), and Golden Globe nominee Ray Liotta manage to embarrass themselves in front of the camera, while Oscar winner Ridley Scott and Oscar nominee David Mamet (of all people to adapt Harris' novel, why Mamet?) do the same in the rear. All of these people have proven themselves, in some cases many times over, as brilliant workers in film. I mean, Ridley Scott has directed both one of the finest horror films and one of the finest science fiction films of all time. Mamet's House of Games is one of the finest films ever made in any genre. The actors speak for themselves.

I assume what they were all thinking is that Hannibal could be Silence of the Lambs II. The problem being that Ted Tally took Thomas Harris' almost aggressively mediocre novel and made something great out of it, and neither Tally nor Jonathan Demme was all too slavish about keeping things Harris-ized. Mamet and Scott, on the other hand, were slavish to Harris' even more aggressively mediocre novel in all the wrong places. Worse, they took the only part of the novel that really worked and destroyed it. I'd put off seeing Hannibal for four years because I expected it to be bad, but I certainly didn't expect the travesty that I actually got.

There is, to be fair, some decent acting. All of it, every last bit, comes from Anthony Hopkins, who here still manages to keep Hannibal Lecter from being a complete self-parody (as he was in Red Dragon the year following). The rest of the cast can be written off. Had Hannibal been a one-man play, it would likely have been far more satisfying.

While I think Julianne Moore seemed more educated, not trailer park trash, but still learning the ropes.

Overall, this movie lacks the suspense and the tight scripting that made the first two stories to captivating.",1110758400,2,736,5.040983606557377
1292230,5,B00003CXSO,"I was kind of disappointed by the film at first because it cuts off the second half of the book, the part I definitely preferred because it showed so well there is a real love affair going on between the criminal and the cop who is tracking him. Catching a serial killer is the story of a seduction : the seducing of the cop and the seducing of the killer by the other proponent in each case. But the film has qualities that are undeniable. It is a good thriller, though a little bit fast and consequently skimpy.

The end is gross, even if the alternative ending is a lot better, because it keeps the main door open. The official ending closes all doors and locks them up so tight there is no escape from the horror this Hannibal inspires in Clarisse, respect, maybe or of course, but horror all the same. It explores a little bit the extreme culture of this man, his phenomenal way to impersonate practically anyone and charm practically any audience.

He is a man who can be on the alert all the time and knows what his opponents are going to do next, even before they know themselves. It is funny how he is not at all disquieted by his being caught by his old high school or university gay offering to the God of death and style, because he knows this Mason has made a mistake : he has called him back by endangering Clarisse and she will know why she has been endangered and by whom, and she will react according to her instinct, she will come after him, Hannibal, because she cannot even doubt he is at stake and she was the bait, and she has to capture him alive, hence to go into the hornet's nest to get him free and then arrest him.

That is not going to work exactly like that but the reducing of the rotten justice department offcial to a mumbling kid if not baboon is such a nice thing to see. A young promising man who cannot resist his fascination for easy money and endangers his own colleagues, even uses them as bait and nothing but trap-meat. That is what our system of containing evil instead of reforming it leads to. There is always someone who will take advantage of the situation. That is western corruption and we are experts at it. At the same time this film, for the second time (Red Dragon proved the contrary but The Silence of the Lambs went the opposite way), proves that the famous FBI profiling technique is just a gimmick in the technology of crime-fighting and nothing else.

A real serial killer is intelligent enough to foresee what the police is going to do and thus to lead them along the way instead of being trapped by their profiling. A real serial killer is also able to check all computers and sites and know that someone has put their greasy fingers in some files that concern him. If he buys a certain perfume in some luxury boutique anywhere in the world, he wants it to be an indicator of his whereabout to get out of the police what he wants, because he knows there is a camera filming hom and a simple mirror will tell him he is being watched. And he always succeeds because teh police works serially too and very little creatively. He does not want to stay in hiding.

He wants to come out and act, so he calculates the action he desires and wishes and he pulls all the strings. It is a shame that the film cuts off the second part of the book and makes it impossible for Hannibal to get out of the chase, but it is a good film and the book is quite different with a serial killer who finally wants to get out of it and tries, maybe succeeds, to do so. Watch and enjoy the film, then read the book and enjoy the difference. Then enjoy the second disk, the alternative or rejected scenes (probably not all of them), the making of, and many other elements. You'll learn a lot about filmmaking and that will give some depth to your pleasure.

We are finally reaching the acme of visual art by being provided with the backstage scenes and the backroom discussions. The cinema with the DVD is becoming like the Bible with the fingerprints of Jesus and his full authentic biography certified by the Roman Emperor himself and at least two dozens of eye-witnesses testifying under oath in some Supreme Court of Historical Truth.

1292261,5,B00003CXSO,"Many people remained astonished after the film . Confused perhaps because they had tought this was a sequel but this is a wrong appreciation.

In fact Hannibal is free in this case and precisely this fact makes the things turn around .

The artistic gaze is a crude and brilliant exercise of superb good taste . Think in Florence the ancient memories of Hannibal in his prison 's pictures , and besides the nest of the Reinassance .

Think besides in Dante , Pazzi and consider his death as poetic justice .

You may argue the film is gore , but what do you expect from Hannibal?

The cast is splendid . Oldman made a glamorous tour de force as an invalid hunger of revenge .

The erotic presence of Julianne Moore makes Clarence Sterling a little bit altered respect to Jodie Foster .

The first entry is a pshycological thriller. This part is a hard multiple chase from Pazzi and the FBI and simulateously all of them seeking Hannibal , superbly played by Anthony Hopkins possibly the best actor in the world who just was working in Titus Andronicus .

The default perhaps resides in some minor aspects such as : How can Dr. Lecter to travel from Europe to USA being one of the ten most dangerous criminals and how could Clarence penetrate in the Oldman ' home with such easiness ?

If you let these questions to the random you may enjoy of a very clever and intelligent drama which will face you against our particular dragons .

1292265,3,B00003CXSO,"Ridley Scott directs the sequel to the original 'Silence of the Lambs.'  Not a terribly memorable sequel in terms of story line or acting; counting more on gore scenes to shock the audience instead of presenting any real substance in plot or theme.

Unlike its predecessor where Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) was more of a secondary character, this film is focused entirely on finding the escaped cannibal doctor.  FBI agent Clarice Starling (Julianne Moore instead of Jodie Foster)tags along with an obnoxious fellow agent (Ray Liotta) to capture the elusive doctor.  She also gets help from one of Lecter's former victims named Mason Verger (Gary Oldman.)

Not a terribly memorable sequel except for graphic scenes that, quite frankly, go too far in the domain of bad taste (literally.)  I really don't need up-close, in your face, scenes of human dissection and dismemberment to imagine what it would be like to be served as someone else's dinner.  The final scene displaying how human brains should be served was too disgusting even for my broad tastes in gratuitous violence.  The graphic content of this film was so extreme that Jodie Foster refused to reprise the role she had played so well in the previous film.

All in all, I find this to be one of the worst films directed by Riddley Scott and certainly the worse of the four Hannibal Lecter films to be made ('Manhunter' was the first one.)  Worth renting for those who have the stomach but, again, this is certainly not a film for the faint of heart or those who have a light stomach for blood and guts.",1092009600,3,1570,4.781481481481482

Also see Brett Ratner's ""Red Dragon"" (2002), the remake of ""Manhunter"".

 You can read about the plot and everything under the amazon.com review so I won't bother. in the end this is a GREAT film with excellent acting, directing and script. As all the ""Manhunter"" films are concerned this is the most underrated and mabye the best in my book. All four of these films are classics and I recomend them to any hard core movie fan.

1292267,2,B00003CXSO,"When Thomas Harris wrote Hannibal, it was a safe bet that a film wouldn't be far along.  Silence of the Lambs director Jonathan Demme and star Jodie Foster declined to take part in Hannibal claiming they found the story distasteful; so director Ridley Scott (Black Hawk Down, Gladiator, Alien) and actress Julianne Moore (replacing Foster as FBI Agent Clarice Starling) were brought into this disappointing follow up.  Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins reprising his Oscar winning role), now living the life of luxury in Italy, finds himself on the run from Mason Verger (an unrecognizeable and uncredited Gary Oldman), a former patient who at Hannibal's advice peeled off part of his face.  Meanwhile, Clarice finds her career on the downward spiral as she as used as bait by Verger to lure Lecter out of hiding.  The suspense can't hold up to that of Silence of the Lambs (movie or book that is) and Scott's direction, even though he gives it his own slick look, is disappointing.  Moore, as good an actress as she is, can't hold a candle to Jodie Foster as we find the once strong willed but vulnerable Clarice be more of a victim here than anything else.  Finally, Hopkins just isn't scary anymore as Hannibal ""The Cannibal"" Lecter.  That alone is probably the worst part of the film, and while Hannibal isn't necessarily bad, it's one of the most disappointing films to be released over the past few years.

Plus it fails to capture Lecter's true intentions toward Starling (as brotherly or fatherly, not romantic). Yet, somehow, the film is oddly satisfying, and I find myself draw to it whenever it's on. The mix of operatic score during chaotic scenes is strangely effective (similar to the ethereal tracks during intense scenes in the LOTR series of films). So, no, it's not a great movie, and Lecter's behavior is sometimes ""out of character,"" but the movie is satisfying nonetheless.",1087344000,,632,5.086538461538462

Since the title of the film is actually 'Hannibal' I knew it would mainly be surrounding Hannibal Lecter, so I wasn't expecting a great deal more from it. However, another point which I also have to get off my chest, is the relationship between Clarice and Lecter. Now, being a huge fan of Silence Of The Lambs, I did think Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster had good chemistry. But in Hannibal, I was completely blown away by Hopkins and Julianne Moore's chemistry together. The only disappointment was, in my opinion, there weren't enough scenes between Hopkins and Moore to express this, and probably change the minds of the audience. The other cast members, such as Gary Oldman whom played Mason Verger, also did a great job. Overall I thought the film was definately worth the money.",1086825600,,926,4.75776397515528

Losing credibility as a drama makes ""Hannibal"" susceptible to the humor that we attach to the ""horror"" genre.  It had me rooting for the monster.  This led to ""disappointment #2:""  The monster let me down by letting the heroine tame him.

Anthony Hopkins and the other actors captured their characters convincingly.  The cast showcased REAL TALENT in the face of a plot that lost contact with reality.  An impossible plot is on par for the horror genre, but a sold-out monster is not.

I saw ""Hannibal"" on TV, so I was spared the truckloads of pulpy gore that it reputedly dumps on moviegoers.  Would I watch it uncut (pun!)?  Yeah, but with reservations.

In keeping with the ""horror"" genre, the final scene would have been better served (pun again) if a ""flying knives"" Oriental chef-style ending had dispatched the heroine.  Instead we get a pussy-whipped monster.

A friend in San Francisco alerted me to the Thomas Harris books, which I've never even thumbed.  What got me into this was Manhunter, a stylish (and likely much lower-budget) 'Lecter' film with Brian Cox as the doc.  Somehow, as a generations-upsmanship over Roger Corman/Vincent Price work, Manhunter managed.
Silence was too pricey, and Jodie Foster from frame one struck me as improbable.  Hannibal seemed to offer more of the same.  But it did a few things right: Giancarlo Giannini, wonderful; Julianne Moore, double wonderful.  Those two, along with the Italian ambience that inserts itself as part of the adventure, added to the presence of Hopkins, made this work for me.

1292353,3,B00003CXSO,"MINOR SPOILERS: Book and novel
It can be said that ""Hannibal"" is only loosely based on Harris' book. Not because it is that different plot-wise or because certain characters are omitted (like Mason's sister) but because the two central characters, Agent Clarice Starling and Dr. Hannibal Lecter, couldn't be more apart from how they are portrayed in the book.
The film makers never bother giving Hannibal a raison de etre (other than staying alive and free), or explain his man-eating ways. In the novel, his little sister Mischa is literally eaten alive by deserting soldiers during the end of WW II. As Hannibal grows older, he decides that God is the ultimate killer and none of his own indiscretions could match those of the Maker. That is his *justification* for killing and eating human flesh. The motive is as disturbing as ever but you actually feel some degree of sympathy for the little boy who found his sister's milk teeth in the stool of her tormentors.
Although Hopkin's delivers a fine performance as usual, you can't help but feel that he's almost parodying his famous role from ""The Silence of the Lambs"". Lines that are meant to sound chilling (""I'm giving serious thought...to eating your wife"") are delivered with comic timing that would befit a black comedy.
Then there's Julianne Moore. I personally felt that Jodie Foster *nailed* the part of Clarice Starling, right down to that country cornpone accent. Tried as I might, I couldn't see Julianne Moore in her shoes. Her accent is too cosmopolitan, her manner too aloof.
And on another point, the novel does a good job of exlaining *and* developing the relationship between Hannibal and Starling. He *does* get inside her head, they both have much in common being orphans and their acquaintance blossoms into a relationship. In the movie, it seems quite pointless. You are left wondering why she would let the most famous serial killer in the world go. Or why he didn't eat her liver with some fava beans?
But Hannibal does have some redeeming qualities. It's a quite excellent horror film. There are scenes that have rightly attained notoriety. I won't spoil those for you. So go on, get your cheap thrills here. Just don't read the book first (if you haven't already).",1083196800,,2243,4.87434554973822

Some parts of the film are deviant - even grossly disgusting - but that's the point.  Hannibal is a diseased individual, and excessive gore is how the depiction of the character's mental state was achieved.  I thought this visual representation was done quite well, even if it was just a crutch primarily reinforcing the merely acceptable screenplay/writing.  The entire film is shot with a sort of dark, decrepit elegance and the musical score is brilliant - one of the reasons that I gave the movie all five stars.

HOWEVER
The people who made the movie blinked when it came to staring at the ending.
The book took a road that made a lot of politically correct folks really uncomfortable and basically eliminated Jodie Foster outright. She simply would never play a part that required her to embrace the weaknesses and depths of the character that the book outlined. No matter that the Starling of the book actually becomes the dominant member of the pair in the end, Ms Foster as the rest of the PC crowd, saw only the mid process. There was a period of manipulation and subjugation that was uncomfortable to observe, and descriptions of the relationship that were brutally straightforward.

1292359,3,B00003CXSO,"Let me start by saying this was a well-made, intelligent thriller. The cinematography was exquisite, the music was beautiful and eerie at the same time, and the entire film had a feeling of impending doom. It actually made me jump about four times, and I usually don't jump that much during a horror movie. The thing that makes this really good is, despite me having already seen this previously, and all ready kind of knowing what shocks were about to occur, they STILL shocked me seeing it again! That is a good mark of a horror director. Those are some of the pros, but there are definitely some cons to this film. 1. No chemistry between Hopkins and Moore: As most fans of ""The Silence of the Lambs"" know, Julianne Moore played Clarice in this version, because Jodie Foster turned down the part. While she portrayed this version of Clarice very well, she and Athony Hopkins did not have any chemistry together. 2. Too much gore and disgusting scenes. This movie was WAY over-the-top, and some of the scenes of disgusting gore weren't necessary at all. The hanging scene was well-done, not too over-the-top, but the scene with the brain, not to mention the gross scenes with the hogs, and the whole way Mason Verger's face looks, is basically too the extreme. It would be far scarier, and less silly, if the film would have just used eerie scenes rather than so much gore. 3. Clarice just didn't seem to be Clarice. True, Julianne Moore and Jodie Foster are two different actresses, and Clarice has changed a lot over the years, but she didn't really even have the same personality. She didn't seem as concerned, as obsessed with trying to catch the villain as she did back when she was working on Bufallo Bill. She seemed more fascinated with Hannibal than genuinely concerned with endeavoring to capture him. I don't know if this is the way the character is supposed to be or not (I haven't yet read the book), but I believe that a character should not chance that much, or if she does, explain in more detail why she changed. All in all, though, this was an intelligent thriller that has you screaming (at those jump-out-of-your-seat moments), laughing (dark humor moments), and rolling your eyes or even getting sick (those gross-out, over-the-top moments). Good job, Ridley Scott, with creating such an atmospheric, darkly funny, and very scary movie.

Shot partially in Florence, Italy, this gorgeous, pristine production is a movie and a half. Director Ridley Scott doesn't just film these lovely vignettes as much as he caresses every scene with his camera and paces the movie so perfectly it almost lulls you until another scene of horrifying violence occurs. Anthony Hopkins is the most convincing monster ever seen on film and is impossible not to watch, this man is an actor's actor. Whenever Dr. Lecter appears on screen, you listen carefully to every word he utters and can't wait to see what happens next. The most brilliant thing about the film is the tension throughout, you just keep FEELING like something terrible is about to happen and that's scarier than anything you actually see. Julianne Moore is a great choice for Clarice Starling, she lends the character a cynicism, toughness and world weariness that comes with a decade of service in the F.B.I., this is a mature, smart Clarice and her development and growth is a marvel to behold. Much has been made of the violence in this film and while ""Hannibal"" is quite graphic at times, it's not the unwatchable gore-fest people have made it out to be. The second disc of special features is indespensible, a veritable feast of interviews, deleted scenes, movie premiere featurettes, special effects documentarties, a terrific Director's commentary and a host of other bells and whistles.

Shortly after this, Lecktor (Anthony Hopkins) turns up in Florance, Italy, much to the delight of a deranged, disfigured vengeance-seeking survivor of his work (Gary Oldman), who had put up a 3 million something dollar reward for his capture. Ironically, the reward for Hannibal's capture comes to the interest of a greedy Italian police inspector (Giancarlo Giannini). Clarice Starling is thrown into the situations when Hannibal establishes contact with her in order to utilize the same type of hypnotic psychological ramblings he utilized while speaking to her from his jail cell.
While intriguing and complicated, some may be put off by the overly cumbersome storyline and mostly bland character portrayals. The balance between disturbing violence and actual substance is poorly emphasized. Anthony Hopkins is excellent as Hannibal Lecktor, and while Julianne Moore's characterization of Clarice Starling is weak, it shows an interesting progression of her character in ""Silence Of The Lambs"".

1292444,2,B00003CXSO,"I was disappointed in this film, though it is not entirely  awful.  It misses the uniquely gripping feel of ""Lambs"" and devolves into scenes of fright and terror meant to shock and revulse in the worst, gratutious way.  Hopkins' performance seems thinner in some spots but almost a caricature of his Oscar-winning performance in others.  Moore holds her own, but I think the film suffers from the producers' presupposition that no matter what they put on screen would benefit from the critical and popular acclaim afforded the first film.  It doesn't happen here.  This film is clearly ""off-note.""  I didn't find myself caring more for any of the characters in this chapter.  I couldn't wait until it was over.

1292446,3,B00003CXSO,"After ten years, the world waited eagerly for the sequel to the legendary THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.  Finally, they have it - although I'm sure it's not at all what they expected.  HANNIBAL is the result of what most will see as a Ridley Scott-Anthony Hopkins-Hans Zimmer collaboration.  Adapted from Thomas Harris' best-selling (although much weaker) novel, HANNIBAL follows only the basic plot of the novel.  Anthony Hopkins returns to his Oscar-winning role as cannibal genius Dr. Hannibal Lecter, who is now roaming freely in Italy.  However, after many years he decides he'd like to come out of retirement; without spoiling any ""surprises"", he attempts to make contact with FBI agent Clarice Starling (Julianne Moore, taking over from Jodie Foster), while running from his only surviving victim's (Gary Oldman) assassins.  Hopkins' performance is great and yet you can't help laughing at Dr. Lecter, so polite and yet the deadliest man alive; Moore tries her hardest, but she comes nowhere near close to taking up where Foster previously stood.  There is also a terrific score by Hans Zimmer; the highlight of the film, of course, however, is Scott's directing.  It may be the absolute weakest sequel THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS could have, but HANNIBAL is still a frightening and effective horror thriller.",1062979200,,1308,5.107981220657277
1292447,3,B00003CXSO,"I have never have been so mad at the ending of a movie.  Before I go into that let me just say that again Anthony Hopkins as always is great as hannibal lecter and Julianne Moore played Starling just as good as Jodie Foster.  And Gary Oldman's uncredited performance as Mason Verger was also well done.  That is about all the good things I can say about this movie and those 3 performances are why I gave this movie 3 stars.  This movie butchered the book, and the parts that were left out hurt the movie too.  In the book you understand why the italian cop tries to catch lecter himself and turn him over to verger in the movie they cut that part out!  I won't even go into the characters that are missing.  The ending was what really irked me.  I guess the ending pushed the envelope a little too far for Ridely Scott or something, but was very weak in my view.  The DVD does have some nice extra's but the movie is not that memorable.  Of course that is just my opnion, I could be wrong.",1062806400,,990,4.163157894736842
1292448,2,B00003CXSO,"The rumour is that Scott originally turned down this project as he heard the title and imagined that it was another historical epic. More's the pity, as this really is the emperor without any clothes, as the director turns in another classy effort, full of his usual cinematographic skill and care, but a film which is ultimately ugly and unnecessary. This is a series in decline: inititially there was the striking Manhunter, featuring an excellent Brian Cox as Lecter; then Jonathan Demme's slightly overrated but still enjoyable Silence of The Lambs. It has been a profitable franchise that just had to continue, and the new film has all the hallmarks of being cobbled together as an excuse to extend a unconvincing course of events even further, while leaving the door open for a fourth installment.
Hannibal falls into three broad sections: first the professional disgrace of Agent Starling; then the discovery and trap set for Lecter in Italy; finally the confrontation in America. Hannibal's presence (as he is now the star of the show) is delayed until quite a few minutes into the picture. Scriptwriter Mamet obviously thought it a good idea and as a way to build up suspense. There's no doubt that there's tension in the air as we await his arrival. It also enables some filling in of Starling's character and motivation. But the opening action scenes are a distraction, the events they portray are never referred to again. By the end of the film it is obvious what they were: narrative padding, deferring the arrival of the main event. Mamet later even has dialogue bathetically undermining the seriousness of what has happened: The Guinness Book of Records congratulates Starling on being the Female FBI agent who has `shot the most people' -  a ludicrous moment.
The problem is that Hannibal's insouciant malevolence is almost entirely static by nature. One thinks of the evil he suggests, regularly in situ in Manhunter's prison cell, or Hopkin's usual calm movements as an actor. Hannibal strolls and discourses, never hurries or panics. He is the civilised chef or lecturer, standing or being wheeled out in front of people, leisurely lighting candles or preparing a ghastly repast; what he is not is dynamic. Hannibal is an action picture constructed around a slow moving centre, and the result is mostly dull. Even the mutilated, fish-faced Mason Verger (an unrecognisable Gary Oldman) is unfortunately bed or wheelchair-ridden - hardly the dynamic opposition required. A chase or two, perhaps more of the manhunt in action for the most wanted Doctor might have leavened the pace a little. Instead, in Verger's watery eyed prosthetics we experience some of the imaginative exhaustion of a series which is feeding upon itself.
By far the most interesting part of the film occurs in Italy, where the avaristic Inspector Pazzi (Giancarlo Gianni, in his most high profile film since the cult Seven Beauties (1976)) discovers Hannibal's identity and plots to secure his capture for the reward himself. But, sadly, Gianni's hangdog charisma as an actor notwithstanding (oh why couldn't he have been cast as Starling's boss, and the wolfish Ray Liotta be the Italian cop?) this is a section fatally drained of tension. It is clear that he will meet his fate at the hands of Lector, who is too smart to fall for this sort of mid-film trap; we even know the likely cause of his murder, so heavily is the emphasis on the grisly death of his ancestor. All Pazzi can do is to listlessly plot and smoke until his game is up - a moment admittedly lightened by Lecter's quizzical `Entrails in or out?' - while the gore-starved audience is denied more of the suggestion made by the killer that he would eat the wife.
There's a scene in the cult exploitation flick `Bloodsucking Freaks' (1976), in which a mad doctor gleefully sucks a victim's brains out through a straw. One is irresistably reminded of this at the end of Hannibal, except that the original, Sadean, justification is replaced here by a jokey, gourmet one. For all of Lecter's weird and compulsive romancing of Starling (which by the next installment will no doubt develop into something more reciprocal), the ending, with the cranial work on Krendler (Liotta) is absurd. Liotta, excellently manic in Goodfellas (1990), good in so many other films, looks embarrassed mouthing his goofy remarks, and one is not surprised. Was this kitchen cabinet of horrors really written by Mamet? From lecher to Lecter's leftovers, Krendelr's role is an unthankful one, the actor's usual dynamism restricted to sexist remarks within smart team briefings and enclosed spaces. But Krendler-Liotta still seems more immediately dangerous to Starling than the good doctor ever does, which is one indication of the way that Lecter has been reduced in stature as each installment has progressed downwards. Like Freddy Kruger, Jason Vorhees and Michael Myers before him, familiarity has bred contempt, and Dr Lecter has lost much of the edge as a villain he once had.
None of Scott's excellent lighting, or Zimmer's outstanding score, can make a silk purse out of a sow's ear, any more than Hopkin's restrained acting style can make Krendler's brain much of a delicacy to be relished. Moments of true horror, like the man eating hogs, do stand out amidst the general dullness, but these are too far between to save a film which leaves those who expected better with a bad taste in the mouth.",1062288000,,5435,4.959429824561403

Normally I do not like romance stories or movies, but this one is off the scale. Hannibal might be a cannibal (what man doesn't have a quirk or two), but he is still capable of the deepest love known to mankind. The ending to the movie just breaks my heart! Okay, so it IS supposed to be a horror movie. But who could ever be scared of such a loving, caring man?????

1292494,5,B00003CXSO,"In this Hannibal series, this, IMHO, is far and away the best of the group. Stylish, atmospheric and beautifully photographed, directed and scored. The music, especially, is haunting and absolutely perfect; after all, this is Grand Guignol at it's finest hour, thanks to the Master, Ridley Scott. Even the gore is done in an operatic fashion, and when the Abattoir takes center stage (which is rather often), you are still hypnotized and mesmerised by the spectacle, the story and the images. Nothing is gratuitous; nothing is done for shock value, but rather, as an integral; part of the story. Sir Anthony Hopkins is Hannibal Lecter, and his speech, his subtle nuances, and his asides (one favorite is his exceeding delight in the moment just preceding the demise of someone who crossed his path and shouldn't have...alas, too late.) Lecter is such a fascinating character that even his worst moments are beautifully choreographed and served up as a new and tantalizing dish, exquisitely prepared for your pleasure alone. Irresistable...yet he is a fiend. What a gorgeous paradox! Ray Liotta is great, especially toward the end, and Julianne Moore (again, IMHO) makes a superior Starling. I do not like comparisons, but with Moore you get more into the character of Starling, and are not distracted by thinking it's Jodie Foster playing a part. Mason Verger, another remarkable character, who has excellent reasons of his own to capture Lecter, lives in isolation on his estate (the famous Biltmore House, built by George Vanderbilt, ((still privately owned and lived in, can you imagine living in such a place! by the great great grandson...))in Ashevillle, SC, and also used for ""Being There."") except for the beleagured doctor who he demeans at every opportunity, poor Caudell; and assorted faceless servants. When I read the book I was skeptical about displaying such a human ruin onscreen; but the effects are nothing less than remarkable...Verger portrayed by one of my favorite actors.
THIS is what moviemaking is all about; this should be used as a template in film schools/studies; it is flawless, not one moment of drag...but the character who made me saddest of all is the poor, fallen-from-grace Police Investigator, Giancarlo Gianinni; he evokes tremendous sympathy, even with a wife who is exquisite beyond words, and still has a good job, but falls prey to his own greed...perhaps for the benefit of his beautiful wife. The opera scene, the music, the streets, transports you away from wherever you are, which, of coure, should be the goal of all films, but in this case, it succeeds beyond any expectations. Magic. Only watch this on DVD! Nothing less will suffice or bring you the production as it is meant to be seen, in all it's glory...fantastic.",1055116800,2,2768,5.059080962800875
1292495,3,B00003CXSO,"Let me start by saying ""Silence of the Lambs"" was a masterpiece in the psychological thriller/horror movie genre. The acting, along with the directional style, and the disturbing storyline and insane villains, made it one of the most compelling horror films to date. It's difficult to live up to the standards set in ""Silence"", and ""Hannibal"" proves that sequels can often become catastrophic. The film has a fairly good basic plot: Doctor Hannibal Lecter's frightening return. But, other plot elements (a crazy guy trying to feed Hannibal to wild bores) complicate the film. Julianne Moore is a good actress, but for me, Jodie Foster will always be Clarice Starling. As for Anthony Hopkins, his talent is undeniable, in my opinion. The Italian setting fits the character of Hannibal perfectly. But, the horror-movie grossness goes slightly over-the-top. All in all, a fairly good horror film, but not nearly as good as ""Silence of the Lambs"" or the Hannibal film that came out recently called ""Red Dragon"".",1054857600,,1007,5.109090909090909

To address the complaints of the viewers who only saw the movie and did not bother to read the book, Hannibal and Clarice are kept apart for most of the story.  Changing this in the move would have completly destroyed the story.  The famed dinner scene (wonderfully filmed; nobody can tell which is a puppet and which is the actor), referred to as both comedy and horror, is again WRITTEN that way in the book.  The movie is wonderfully filmed, not as a sequel to ""Silence of the Lambs"" which it is not, but as a story about Dr. Hannibal Lecter.  Sadly, some of the plot elements were diminished or removed, but the movie is beautifully shot, wonderfully acted, and amazingly edited.  Of course, the book is better, but this is true of all three stories.

One of the battles involved a Carthaginian general named Hannibal.

Anyways, I didn't really care for this movie.  It didn't seem like it had a plot other than trying to gross the heck out of the audience.  Whatever.",1053648000,2,713,4.515625
1292498,3,B00003CXSO,"Hannibal is not a great movie.  It is not even a particularly good movie.  However, given that the movie was based upon Thomas Harris's wreck of a novel, the fact that the movie is fairly entertaining and not a total disaster is great credit to the talents in front and behind the camera.
Thomas Harris's two superb novels - Red Dragon and The Silence of the Lambs - gave birth to fantastic adaptations.  'Hannibal' on the other hand, was a ridiculously weak novel.
The worst thing about Hannibal is the way it treats one of today's best known literature and movie characters - Hannibal 'The Cannibal' Lector.  In previous books, Lecter had a mystique about him, an aura of terrible, invincible evil, but all that was reduced.
Firstly, the uncaged Lecter is no where near as menacing as the man behind bars.  When imprisoned, Lecter is a caged demon, a shadow that threatens mankind and must never be unleashed upon us.  But out of chains, he's an elitist, a sort of evil James Bond, a man who likes nice cars, good food and expensive wine.  Indeed, in the book, Claris locates Lecter by simply tracing the most expensive wine bottles in the US.  What a disappointment.
Second, Harris made Lecter the hero of the book, by pitching him against pedophile Mason Verger.  When facing a child rapist, Lecter, who 'merely' eats adults, is seen as a hero in comparison.  A 'good' Lecter is much less interesting than the heart of evil that he was in the previous installations.
Worst of all, Harris gives Lecter a motive.  It turns out (spoiler) that Lecter kills people because the Nazis during World War 2 murdered his sister.  What a cope out - the greatness of Hannibal was in his evil being inexplicable, as he actually told Claris in 'Silence', you could not reduce him to influences.  Harris completely sold out the integrity of the character by giving him the motive.
In Hannibal the movie, the production team wisely alleviated (although they did not entirely solve) all of these problems.  The scene in which Claris traces Hannibal by his wine consumption is gone and less time is spent on his fancy food intakes.  By downplaying Verger's pedophilia, Hannibal does not look that good in comparison.  Finally, the silliness of the motive is ignored completely.
Furthermore, the improved script features much more contact between Claris and Lecter.  The interaction between them is the heart of the story, and yet in the book, the only contact among them in some 400 pages is a single letter from Lecter.  Here the producers introduce several more communications between them, including a phone call in a very climatic scene.
From a technical point of view, the movie is well executed, with unnecessary scenes and minor characters from the book discarded, and great attention spent on the fantastic scenes in Florence, where Inspector Rinaldo Pazzi tries to outmaneuver Lecter, but end up outmaneuvered himself.  Those scene are not bad in the book, but Scott's wonderful sense of scene, and the amazing photography really brings the menace alive, and help preserve the aura of danger around Lecter.
But the movie again cannot completely disregard the novel, and the main plot of the novel is a fairly pedestrian cat and mouse story, where two parties hunt for Lecter, to results neither of them expected (but the audience surely does).  Try as hard as the producers do to escape the confines of the story, they just can't.  Most of the movie remains an effective, extremely well directed and acted, thriller.  That is all.
Then we come to the controversial ending.  After a lukewarm book, Harris finally comes up with an interesting premise and some powerful scenes. (Spoiler)  After Capturing Clarice, Lecter begins in an effort to turn her into his dead sister, using drugs, brain washing, and his own mental powers.  This is an extremely cool notion, which leads to the book's best scene - the infamous brain dinner.
In the novel, Hannibal captures Paul Krendler, an FBI executive who does all that is in his power to harass Clarice Starling.  In a gross but brilliant scene, Harris depicts Lecter opening Krendler's skull, and piece by piece taking out parts of his brain.  We read the breathtaking description of dinner conversation, where the three of them eat Krendler's brain.  With each additional piece which Lecter takes out and cooks, Krendler's speech retard more and more, and from a highly aggressive yet sophisticated person he becomes an agree, bitter, childish, and finally speechless person.  It is a terrible scene, but it is truly both shocking and amazing.
The movie, lacking the proper foundations for this scene, completely misses the point.  The special effects are so over the top as to make the scene unbelievable and not the least bit scary.  Furthermore, because the producers (wisely, in my opinion), deleted so much of the back-story, at this point they have no idea what to do next.  So you've got a little chase, some bantering between Starling and Lecter, as Scott rushes towards the ending credits.
Ultimately, the only way to have made a good movie out of 'Hannibal' would have been to completely rewrite the story.  Having to work with what Harris gave them, Ridley Scott and the rest of the production team salvaged as much as possible.",1051920000,10,5276,4.872340425531915
1292499,3,B00003CXSO,"Hannibal is the sequel to Silence of the Lambs. Most sequels are inane rehashings of previous elements that made a success - Hannibal is very different but still inane, perhaps much more inane because it did *not* rehash what made SotL a success.
The sophisticated serial killer Hannibal Lector is free, trying to get a job as curator of an important library in Florence. We follow the bumblings of Pazzi, a policeman who is lured by a rich former victim of Hannibal to capture him, with the predictable grizzly results. Hannibal comes back to the States, stalks Agent Starling (who is suspended after a drug bust gone wrong, in a number of scenes that transpire stupidity), plays mind games with her, and finally confronts her in her own home, eating the brain of her rival Paul Krendler in a memorable scene.
The first half of Hannibal is great, apart from Pazzi's stupidity. Let's face it, even for three million dollars, would you repeatedly talk to a guy who's on the FBI's Most Wanted list and knows you are a policeman looking for him, alone ?
The second half of Hannibal is completely off-kilter. We don't care about the relationship between Hannibal and Starling except insofar as they give us insights in their psychology. Anything else is pedestrian and alien to the whole idea of Hannibal Lector. This movie thinks that Starling's ineffectual attempts to kill Hannibal at the end are interesting. They are not. This was a major missed opportunity. Also, the whole story of Mason Verger, a man who disfigured himself under the influence of drugs provided by Hannibal, is not interesting, nor is it necessary to the plot.

1292579,4,B00003CXSO,"We all know that the critics blasted ""Hannibal"" and it's so easy to see why- they went into the theatre expecting to see another ""Silence of the Lambs"". It's as simple as that. What the critics failed to see is an interesting movie about what Hannibal Lecter is like outside the asylum, with his freedom.
I was quite disappointed when Jodie Foster didn't reprise her role as Clarice Starling, but Julianne Moore's performance as the ten year after Clarice Starling is just as good, in my opinion. We are talking about a different Clarice Starling, much different from the one we saw and loved in ""Silence of the Lambs"".  In ""Hannibal"", she has realized that the FBI's value systems are beginning to get messed up and with her value systems intact, she doesn't know what direction to go to.  Julianne Moore just delivers such a great performance.  True, there isn't much that she can do with this character, but what she does is still excellent.  Check out the scene where she cries after the *spoiler* fishmarket disaster.  Check out her facial expression all throughout the final sequence, where they all have that demonic dinner at Paul Krendler's lake house. *end of spoiler*
Anthony Hopkins reprises his role as Dr. Hannibal Lecter with a lot of wit, intelligence, and depth.  You see, ""Hannibal"" is not supposed to be a horror film.  It's simply a film that shows what Hannibal Lecter is like outside bars.  And it's a very interesting portrayal.  We begin to understand the pathology of this character.  How he eats people, and he reasons that he is doing the public a service.
There is a lot of sexual chemistry going on between Hannibal and Clarice Starling.  If you've read the book, you know what happened there, which is probably why Jodie Foster declined to reprise the role.
I loved Hans Zimmer's score on this film.  The editing is excellent, and so is the cinematography.  Hey, we're talking about several sequences that ocurred in Italy, and Italy is such a beautiful place to shoot.
I absolutely love ""Hannibal"".  I love all the Hannibal Lecter movies. But ""Hannibal"" was a great way to end it.  *spoiler* In the last scene, we se Dr. Lecter in an airplane full of Asian people in there.  This is a hint that he is on his way to either Japan or Thailand- judging it from his taste.
If you thought ""Hannibal"" was a disaster, just think about what I said. Rent the DVD again and try to see the film as a stand-alone film.  Then maybe you'll understand my points here.  And when you're convinced, buy the DVD from Amazon.com.

When we watched Silence of the Lambs, we did not see what Hannibal did, but rather heard about it, like a legend. This is what made Hannibal such a lovable villain, not what he did on screen, but rather what he is capable of.
I would not say Hannibal is a total disaster because it really isn't. Fans of Hannibal Lecter should consider seeing this film despite the critics' disapproval. I enjoyed the sleeky feel of the film and Ridley's visual genius that comes into play. One scene begins the film with doves forming Hannibal's face on the ground. This film does not have much suspense, but reverts to gore and violence (ugh, the brain scene was unnecessary).
Poor Ray Liotta, I'll never see him as anything more than the guy that ate his own brain for a meal. This is not surprising as it is shocking.

It leaves out important characters and events, and completely changes the story(the ending). Even if you've never read the book and don't know what you're missing, avoid anyway! Hannibal Lecter is NOT scary outside his cell. It's a huge mistake to show the things he does. By not showing you and simply telling you-like they did in Silence Of The Lambs-your mind can fill in the gaps with the most horrible and terrifying things imaginable. That worked! Showing him does not! And what's with Julianne Moore? Why does Hollywood think that using a different actor for a role played by a previous actor/actress isn't going to affect anything?

By the time it reaches the final ""dinner party"" scene (I'll spare the details), it's not so much gross as it is ridiculous. Julianne Moore is very good given the thankless task of filling Jodie Foster's shoes as Clarice Starling, but Sir Anthony Hopkins becomes a parody of himself as the titular Hannibal Lecter.

One thing I also enjoyed was the deleted scenes with a director commentary option. Ridley Scott is interesting to listen to and you can see how and why the reasoning for removing the footage. I honestly did not think the movie justified this amount of extras, but MGM makes the most of it, and it's a pleasant surprise.
The movie itself is also good in it's own right. Julianne Moore easily makes you forget that the role was once Jodie Fosters. Fans may be dissapointed at the grandiose tone of the film, especially compared to the gritty realism of ""Silence"". But if you take it for what it is, it's a decent flick.

1292664,4,B00003CXSO,"Hannibal was great!  It's a great psychological, suspense thriller that just chilling and all out, a great movie.  Anthony Hopkins returns as Dr. Hannibal Lechter, 10 years after SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.  Also starring in this is Julianne Moore as Clarice Starling and Ray Liotta and Gary Oldman.
It's been 10 years since Dr Lechter escaped from custody and his case has been all but forgotten except by 2 people, Clarice Starling and Mason Verger (Oldman), the only survivor of Hannibal Lechter.  Horribly disfigured and scarred thanks to Lechter, Verger has been waiting 10 years to exact revenge on Dr Lechter and now the time is finally right because Verger finds him.  Agent Starling then reopens the case in hope that she'll find him first and be abto find him in time before Verger gets a hold of him.
Hannibal isn't nearly as psychologically scary as SILENCE OF THE LAMBS was but I will say that it has a lot more gore in it.  Here's 2 perfect examples, the end scenes and the library.  Hopkins really puts up another quality performance as Dr Lechter.  There are 2 down sides to this movie.  Julianne Moore replaces Jody Foster as Clarice Starling.  It would have been nice to have the original, but Moore does a very good job.  The other thing is that the ending might disappoint a few people.  Personally, I thought it was a good ending and it added a bit a fear to it.
Either way it goes, make sure you watch SILENCE OF THE LAMBS first because there are so many references to it that if you don't see it, than HANNIBAL won't seem as good to you.  I recommend this one to anyone who's into the series and to anyone who likes suspense thrillers because this one will do that for you.  Plus, Hopkins says the classic line ""Hello Clarice"".

1292665,2,B00003CXSO,"""Hannibal"" by Thomas Harris is a rich, dark, pseudo-Gothic exposition of one of the most infamous characters in modern fiction, Hannibal Lecter. Surrounded by the strange characters one would expect to inhabit his extraordinary, yet psychotic life; the brilliant FBI agent Clarice Starling, feminine and vulnerable, yet tough, strong-willed and obsessed with executing the letter of the law; meat magnate Mason Verger, physically and mentally deformed and utterly consumed by revenge upon the man who left him in such a state; his steroid-abusing gym-junkie sister Margot; the quiet, enigmatic Barney; Florencian detective Rinaldo Pazzi, who dreams of glory and fortune when he stumbles upon Lecter's new alias... the list goes on. Harris moves his doomed characters around his macabre stage as in an epic modern opera. It meshes subtle elements of literature with psychology, history, philosophy, even fine dining, while maintaining an aura of impending doom within the world it inhabits.
As for the movie, well, it's little more than standard Hollywood sequel material, cashing in on the legacy of its predecessor instead of attempting to be a faithful adaptation. When I learnt that Ridley Scott was to direct the film adaptation, I was intrigued by how the director of such films as Alien, Aliens and Blade Runner would translate Harris' bleak universe onto the screen. When I heard that Foster turned down a reprise of her role, alarm bells started to ring. But I was ready to give Julianne Moore a chance. What a disappointment. Moore, an acceptable enough supporting actor, seems out of her depth in such an integral lead role, and adds little to the fragility-tinged stoicism Foster wrung successfully out of the character. Hopkins is the best thing about this movie, but he's clearly cruising. Oldman could have made the complex and thoroughly warped villian Mason Verger chillingly memorable, such as his excellent roles in ""Dracula"" and ""Leon The Professional"", but he's hamstrung in a character stripped down to little more than its bare skeleton (not only literally) by the screenplay. But the characterisations aren't the only thing watered down by the film. The most criminally disappointing aspect of this adaptation is the complete overhaul of the book's ending. The fact that it jokingly leaves open the possibility of a sequel, the last thing on the minds of readers who have just put the book down, demonstrates the extent to which the film has made one of the more perverse and unusual works of fiction in modern years more mainstream for the sake of popularity and box-office success. The infamous Krendler scene seems to have been included merely for shock value and the ""water-cooler"" market. By that stage, however, the screenwriters had completely departed from the book and were making it up as they went along. And I had become too thoroughly disillusioned to really care. 1 extra star for beautiful Florence.",1041897600,,2937,5.1722689075630255

I don't want to spoil the plot, but out of all the Hannibal Lecter movies, this was not my favorite.  If i had to rank them it would Silence of the Lambs, Red Dragon, followed by Hannibal.  Don't get me wrong, it is still a good movie which is why I gave it four stars, and the ending is very interesting, if not disturbing.

1292667,1,B00003CXSO,"The only good thing about this film is Julianne Moore who always, always, gives everything she's got to any film in which she appears. She does a creditable follow-up as the alienated Clarice Starling in what is otherwise a deeply stupid film.
The screenplay gives only the merest nod to Thomas Harris's signal achievement in actually humanizing Hannibal in the book; in the film, Hopkins gives the same ridiculous, over-the-top performance he offered in Silence of the Lambs. Why he possesses an Academy Award for it will be forever beyond my comprehending. (If you want to see a truly alarming, deeply inhabited Hannibal, check out Manhunter--Michael Mann's ill-advisedly renamed Red Dragon--and see British actor Brian Cox do in only a few minutes what Hopkins cannot do in two full-length films: impart the true horror of evil personified, without bells and whistle but just sheer acting ability.)
For all the moody, European effect, this movie just doesn't happen. It comes alive when Moore is the focus. When it's Hopkins, it's all just gore, more gore and still more gore--pointlessly. Unlike the book, where the reasons are clear, in the film Hannibal is just a killing machine. Liotta also gives an over-the-top performance that lacks any hint of subtlety. The audience doesn't even get to enjoy the final scene as written by Harris; it's turned into an additional bit of meritless gore.
Don't bother with this one. Get Manhunter instead--which is truly the best film of a Harris book.",1041033600,5,1494,5.052631578947368
1292668,5,B00003CXSO,"Following a decade after the enormously successful and critically acclaimed ""Silence of the Lambs,"" ""Hannibal"" was a sequel that I (and many others) had questioned the quality of. After all, most sequels that come along this late are usually pointless and can't capture the magic of their predecessor or just flat out stink. ""Hannibal,"" though surely a different film, does not stick to routine sequel formula. This film stands by itself. Anthony Hopkins returns to his role as Hannibal ""The Cannibal"" Lecter and Julianne Moore replaces Jodie Foster as FBI Agent Clarice Starling. Both actors do superb jobs, especially Julianne Moore (who I have always liked) who had a lot to live up to. Clarice, having just been accused of botching a drug-bust, is temporarily stripped of her duties as an FBI agent and is put to the task of revisiting an old-case of hers: Hannibal Lecter. She is given the job of tracking him down, and after receiving a letter from ""H,"" she slowly, but surely, pinpoints his location: Florence, Italy. Problems arise as another detective in Florence is on Hannibal Lecter's trail after receiving word of a large award granted by one of Hannibal's victims, who wants nothing more to see ""H"" suffer and who will pay any price. The movie relies on a lot of gore. Gallons more than ""Silence of the Lambs"" did. Exposed brains, exposed intestines, exposed skulls, it's all here and it's about as nasty as it's R-rating will allow it to be. But still, the movie maintains it's dignity, despite being an all-out gorefest. The movie is both beautiful and terrifying. Ridley Scott (Alien, Gladiator) did an excellent job directing. Like the title says, he does a superb job of balancing style with substance. Purists will hate it because it is a lot different from ""Silence of the Lambs"" and even ""Manhunter."" But, really, the movie is it's own movie, and if you keep that in mind, you too will enjoy it.",1039305600,,1917,4.829787234042553

Even veteran actor Anthony Hopkins cannot save this movie, in spite of his wonderful performance.  Julianne Moore replaces Jodi Foster as FBI agent Clarice Starling, who squares off against Dr. Hannibal, who taunts her from across the Atlantic ocean in obscure ways.
I can almost imagine how the script outline took shape.  The story seems to be the product of anxious Hollywood pitchmen frantically throwing out ideas to a studio executive, grasping for success.  In any event, they have produced a disjointedly contrived story, punctuated with brief scenes of gory violence.

1292671,5,B00003CXSO,"Writing this movie off as a senseless catalogue of horrors does a terrible injustice to it. In this version, Lecter is free and living in Tuscany, which automatically involves a shift in the tone of the film. No longer the caged animal, Dr. Lecter is living the high life in Florence as an expert in Medieval and Early Renaissance Literature. Lecter free is Lecter happy, and Anthony Hopkins admirably portrays his verve. I thought Julianne Moore portrayed an older, more world-weary, Clarice Starling with skill, and is by no means just a second-choice-after-Jodie-Foster. Foster's Starling was inexperienced, though promising. Moore shows the flowering of that promise superbly. Gary Oldman played as he always does, with a brilliant conviction. But enough, anyone can test the truth of this by viewing the movie.
What I thought was missing in previous reviews, and which spurred me to write this one, is an explanation for the violence of Hannibal. It was sufficient to turn many viewers' stomachs, and I'm not entirely sure that they were wrong, albeit one can see equally graphic video of *real live people* with the top of their head cut away while undergoing brain surgery--in some cases they are still conscious and talking! In the other cases, the cinematography shows very little. The disfiguring of Mason Verger is in blurry and shaky camera work, the attack on the nurse (referred to in Silence and played in video here) is entirely obscured by Lecter's back and the bodies of two orderlies, and the final end of Mason Verger is again primarily not seen, only enough is shown to give us an idea of the horror. That so many reacted so strongly suggests that Ridley Scott achieved his probable goal in showing us little, but making it seem like much more. The violence is not gratuitous, nor does it detract from the psychological aspects of the story, rather it allows us to delve into the psychology of Lecter as never before. Hannibal is Lecter's murderous fantasies made flesh, just as the equally mad Mason Verger nurses his plans of revenge by flesh-eating boars. In each case, these wealthy, cultured men seem to take their inspiration from their reading, and here's the irony in the previous reviews which decry Hannibal as an expression of everything that is wrong with American culture and cinema: Hannibal's violence comes straight from the classic literature and arts both he and Mason Verger live on. The analogy between the death of Rinaldo Pazzi and the end of Judas Iscariot is made explicit, but there are even more instances of literary borrowings. Adonis was killed by a man-eating boar, and even eating brains has literary precedent: Ugolino della Gherardesca, the Count of Donoratico, was of a Ghibelline family, but double-crossed them to raise the Guelphs to power in Pisa. When the Ghibellines seized control, he was dispatched to prison by Archbishop Ruggieri degli Ubaldini where he died. They both betrayed something, the Archbishop his acquantance, and the Count his country and family tradition, so Dante put them both in Cocytus in Canto XXXIII, where the Count was forever eating away at the brain of his treacherous friend. Thyestes may also be another model, in this case the Thyestian banquet is made even more ironic by the fact that Krendler is unaware of his self-cannibalization. This is the sort of stuff Lecter and Verger learned, and it's not ultimately unsurprising that they'd fashion their revenges and violence on classical models, which allows us insight into the way they think. Far from being less psychologically interesting than its predecessor, Hannibal becomes more so, because we are able to see their motivations made plain by each act of violence.
So, for those who are still offended, be careful not to look to closely at classic literature, Greek and Roman myth, the works of ancient historians, and don't ever attend the opera!

1292672,4,B00003CXSO,"as a whole, it's a good flick, but I was terribly dissapointed in how much it strayed from the book. I mean, I know every movie strays from it's book, even the 1st Harry Potter flick (contrary to the belief of most), but I feel they cut out some of the key points of the story in the movie. Remember how Clarice and Hannibal were lovers at the end of the book? Not so at the end of the movie. All through the book/movie it's obvious how Hannibal has such an admiration for Clarice, and Clarice holds a certain distant respect and reverance for the good ole doc, and it's so obvious these two will hook up. This gives strength to just how personal this case is for Clarice. This personal sense is most prevalent when she decides to continue the case ""against"" the good doctor after being placed on administrative leave. And she gets arrested at the end?! That's not right. That soooo did not happen in the book. And whatever happenned to Mason's sister? Margot, I think her name was? She played a short, albeit important role in the book, and she is just not in the movie at all. In the movie it's obvious that Mason's staff doesn't exactly like the [person], and I think that if they'd left the sister in, and gave an accurate portrayal of her teaming up with Barney, ultimately causing his death, then they'd have done a better job of showing how Mason's ""dictatorship"" lead to a revolt, resulting in his demise. Sure, feed him to the pigs. That makes no sense. Maybe they left some key points out of the movie to make room for the slow-starting beginning. The director really, really let us down on this one folks; that is such an injustice. To tell you the truth, though, I feel that Thomas Harris could have completely left out the Evelda Drumgo bit, and just started with the Xray arrival.

1292753,3,B00003CXSO,"At the end Hammer films churned out a number of overwrought films with heavy handed direction and weak scripts. What has all that got to do with Hannibal? Read on and you'll find out. First, the title should have been a dead give away that this was not SOL or Red Dragon.
Hannibal has more in common with Alien than with Silence Of The Lambs. Ridley Scott has made a mainstream horror film. It's a shell game really. Scott has taken the genre trappings and put them under another walnut too swiftly for most folks to see. The baroque novel that Thomas Harris wrote really wasn't a very good sequel to his two popular bestsellers Red Dragon and SOTL. The screenplay does the best with what it's got.
The performances are over the top as can be expected in a gradiose horror spectacle. Gladiator, Scott's previous film, took Spartacus and merged it with a sword and sandal b movie creating a new sort of gory epic. With the added element of that film's satire (greatly on display in Hannibal as well), this uneasy alliance of different genres worked pretty well.
It's a pity that Jodie Foster didn't return to the role of Clarice Starling. Having Julianne Moore play the role brings a different element to the role. She has a world weariness and maturity that Foster might not have been able to bring to the table. That's not slightling Foster. It's a compliment to Moore in that she brought her own interpretation and emotional baggage to the role. Anthony Hopkins is, as befits his character, all over the place. He overplays the role a bit but it works given the film's context as a horror film. Ray Liotta plays a scummy FBI agent that is everything Starling is not -- a perfect foil who is more glory hound and politican than devoted government agent.
The screenplay improves Harris' feeble novel. The elements that were taken out are more in line with how the audience believed the characters would behave. In fact, it seems as if Harris' novel has completely different characters with the same names as in the previous work. That's not the case with the film. It's true to its character sources.
Is this film detestable? Frankly, there are moments that are pretty disgusting. But these moments also prevent Hannibal from becoming the anti-hero of the piece. He does unpleasant and disgusting things because he's evil. There's no cosmic sense of justice at work. That's where Moore's performance as Starling works well--she becomes the moral center of the film. Despite her dishonor, she continues to hold on to her sense of morality. It isn't dictated by politics but by what is right.
The film runs too long and the convulted plot doesn't hang together as well here as it did in SOTL (or Red Dragon). The later is due to the poor source material. I read Harris' book and, frankly, he was trying to destroy the sense of ""romance"" that had arisen around these two characters. While his intention was honorable, the plotting for Hannibal was sloppy and the character motivations poorly thought out. The screenwriters do a good job of cleaning up the book and making the story more coherent and presentable. Scott does keep Harris' tone though and that's probably what disgusts people more than anything else but it was meant to disgust at the same time as entertain.
You'll enjoy this film if you accept it not as a thriller but as a horror film. Silence Of The Lambs was a thriller in the Hitchcockian sense. Hannibal is clearly informed by all the European (particularly Italian) low budget horror films made during the 70's and 80's. Hannibal could have been directed by Mario Bava (if he was alive of course) with similar results. The film is powerful, unpleasant and atmospheric. It's also entertaining in a sick sort of horror film way. Which is precisely what Scott was aiming for. The cult of Lecter needed to be shaken up so that the audience can see him for what he is; a charming, arrogant sociopathic monster. Hannibal is a clear descendant of the type of films Hammer churned out in the late 60's and early 70's. Perhaps that's how it was intended. I'd suggest avoiding Hannibal if you're pretty easily sickened by gore.",1034380800,,4136,4.706206896551724
1292754,4,B00003CXSO,"Hannibal isn't Silence of the Lambs, and there's a reason for that-it's not supossed to be. While I could write a whole review on the comparrisons Hannibal gets to Silence, I won't do that. There's really no reason to do so. There are two totally different movies.
What I will say about the two is that though Hannibal is a sequel, it really is only a sequel in terms of the characters of Clarise Starling and Hannibal Lector. There's no Jack Crawford or Buffalo Bill. That's pretty much it. That's one of the reasons this movie deserves more credit that it gets, is because it works without not having seen ""Silence"", though it works better have seeing it.
To sum up the plot, Hannibal is a movie about Hannibal Lector. Out. Around. And no cell to hold him this time. This time Hannibal is living in Italy and is enjoying the finer things in life. All is going well for Dr. Lector untill a vengeful past victim puts Lector back up on the FBI's most wanted list thanks to his wealth. Agent Starling(who is no longer a rookie, and it shows in her attitude/confidence), who after a shoot-out gone bad puts her in a hotspot with the DA, is pretty much forced to get back on the assignment. Through some witty detective work, she finds that Hannibal is currently living in Italy. Meanwhile, an Italian detective realizes who Lector is and goes to getting an award sum for his capture(the money being provided by Lector's ONLY surviving victim, brillantly played by Gary Oldman).
What happens next, you'll have to see for yourself.
Ridley Scott's direction is beautiful, and there is some jaw-dropping cinematography. The musical score, curtosy of Hans Zimmer, fits the movie perfectly. There is plenty good things about this movie, that haven't been given the proper credit, because of it's comparisons to Silence of the Lambs.
The DVD it'self is picture perfect. The extra's are plenty, and there is more than enough trailers to keep you busy. The behind the scenes segments are fun, especially the crowd reaction, and all the celeberties who attended the premiere party. The list of the special features are exactly what they sound like.
Overall, Hannibal is an extremely under-rated movie that, unfortunately, falls victim to it's constant comparrisons to Silence of the Lambs. This really isn't fair, because Silence of the Lambs is one of the most important horror films of all time, and Hannibal is not just a horror film, it falls into the many categories of horror, suspence, drama, and even romance. In comparison to Silence of the Lambs, it's really apples and oranges in this case.
I give this DVD 4 stars, because of the movie itself. But also the DVD has plenty of extras. Fans of DVD bonuses will not be dissapointed.",1033689600,3,2727,4.755274261603375
1292755,5,B00003CXSO,"I personally don't know anything more scary than a killer who is smarter than me and believes that his murdering me is both moral and, if done properly, tasteful. This film is about degradation. People are complaining that the scene at the end is too disgusting and violent, etc, etc. I suppose it would be better if a depiction of a murder committed by a cannibal were made acceptable for general viewing. The bottom line is that this film pulls off what it is trying to: morality is created in the human intellect, and the human mind is, despite the societal boundaries and niceties it's engaged in everyday, little more than the primal animal brain. If you want to understand a criminal, understand that a criminal is an animal in rebellion against society. More than that you can't hope to know, even from consulting the quickest of criminal minds. This was the theme carried over from Silence of the Lambs.
That said, this is most certainly not the same movie. It's barely a sequel. There is not better or worse because there is little comparison. Standing on its own, this film has brilliant acting, writing, cinematography and directing. Furthermore, the thematic content is mind-boggling and not like any other representation of taboo/criminal acts that has been seen on the Big Screen before.
If you are offended by violence or human degradation or are a religious freak that wants to contrast this movie against all Hopkin's Christian-related movies in a biased review, don't go see this. I'm not sure why anyone like that would decide to lay down [money] for a ticket to see a horror movie about a cannibal anyway.

But Scott's visual style, which is what makes all his films so eminently watchable (Alien, Blade Runner, Gladiator), and some expertly done sequences make up for its flaws.
Gary Oldman is great as the cop who's chasing the elusive cannibal and Ray Liotta has some nice scenes throughout the film.
But Hopkins has little to get his teeth into, and comes off as somewhat gauche. Impressive gun fights and some creepy moments with Oldman and Hopkins don't make up for the lack of suspense.

She read the script and knew it was trash and refused to do this.  Jodie, I respect you for that decision.  What we have here is an elegant Friday The Thirteenth movie.  Silence of the Lambs was an intelligent psychological thriller.  Hannibal on the other hand is a big budget slasher film.  The plot?  Mason Verger, a man who was severely disfigured at the hands of Hannibal Lecture, seeks revenge by hiring thugs to kidnap Lecture and feed him to wild maneating bores.  At the same time Clarice Starling is disgraced by the FBI for an arrest gone wrong.  First, anyone with half a brain would have known the bloodbath at the beginning is no the fault of Starling.  He disgrace is merely a plot device.  So as Hannibal comes to the aide of Clarice he is captured, but not before he whipes out of team of Mason Verger's thugs in Florence, Italy.  In the scenes the cameral lingers long and close on the gore.  The purpose of this movie is not to entertain but to shock.  Ridley Scott did gore much better in his 1979 movie Alien.  The gore here is just redundant after awhile.  And then there is Ray Liotta.  He was so good in Goodfellas.  Now he's reduced to playing a crooked authority figure (He did it again in the equally bad John Q) who gets his brain fried and eaten.  Then there is the film's final scene in which Hannibal shares a piece of brain with a little boy on an airplane.  This in a nutshell is how tacky the movie is.

Seeing it on DVD again AMAZED me!
The Scene that stood out most, was when! Inspector Rinaldo Pazzi came to Dr lecter's to pick up the suit cases,
It's classic Scott In the beautiful style of direction and the real, smooth acting played by both Actor's.
Hannibal is  puffing on a joint so coool while the inspector is terrified.
It is just brillant.

1292830,3,B00003CXSO,"This is a well acted film with marvelous performances by the entire cast. Julianne Moore, reprising Jodie Foster's role as FBI agent, Clarissa Starling, is superlative, and Anthony Hopkins, as Hannibal Lecter, is once again sublime. The supporting cast, which includes Ray Liotta and Giancarlo Giannini, are also terrific. The problem with the movie is not with the cast, but with its penchant for trying to shock the audience with gore and monstrous scenes of anthroprophagy that revolt, rather than merely shock, the viewer.
Ten years after his escape from custody, Hannibal Lecter resurfaces in Florence, Italy, of all places. After him is Mr. Mason, a fabulously wealthy, but disgusting piece of human vermin and former moltester of children, who was horribly disfigured many years ago with a little help from Hannibal who had been his psychiatrist. He is on the hunt for Hannibal as is, of course, Starling. Who will get to Hannibal first or, better yet, who will Hannibal get to first, is the question that begs to be answered. Unfortunately, Liotta, as a greedy Departman of Justice spokesperson and Giannini, as a greedy Italian police officer, get in Hannibal's way by providing assistance to Mr. Mason, much to their detriment, as the viewer will find out.
While given to some excess, this is still an interesting film. Despite his proclivity for human flesh, Anthony Hopkins manages to make Hannibal Lecter everything anyone could ever hope for in a dinner companion: exquisitely mannered, cultured, intelligent, and charming. Just make sure that you are not the main course.

1292832,4,B00003CXSO,"Comparisons between the two are inevitable, but ""Hannibal"" is such a different kind of movie than its predecessor, it forces you into watching it in its own terms. First of all, the dark, dirty look on the original is gone. This is a Ridley Scott movie, so you know that the ""look"" is going to be something wild and crazy, very exquisite indeed since is set in the beautiful city of Florence. You also have to remember that in the previous movie, the real star was Clarice, while this film is all Hannibal. The good doctor is the absolute star in this, and you can almost find yourself rooting for him when he kills, crossing your fingers so that he never is caught. Definetely one of the most charismatic villains ever.
If you watch this movie hoping to see everything you saw in the first one, then you'll be disapointed. Like I said before, this is a completely different movie, and it can be better apreciated by fans of the Marquis de Sade, or anyone else who's in favor of ""good taste"" against the gruesome tale than the first one was. Personally, the only thing I don't like about this movie is that Clarice is played by a different actress this time. Not that I consider Julianne Moore a bad choice, is just that I'm a big Jodie Foster fan.
The extras in this edition are great, specially the deleted scenes. By the way, I think that ""alternative ending"" would have been better. Those of you who have seen this movie know what I'm talking about (the choping scene with the meat cleaver in front of the fridge). Those of you who don't know, well... I'm not going to spoil the fun for you.
Well, if you loved ""Silence of the lambs"", then maybe you should reconsider if you're going to get this movie, specially if you see it merely as a sequel. On the other hand, if you're a Lecter fan (I know I am), then look no more! This is not ""Silence of the lambs 2"", my friend, this is ""Hannibal"".",1028332800,,1895,4.371104815864022

Sir Anthony Hopkins was awsome as predicted, and Jodie Foster's replacement (I can't believe she would do this movie!) Julian Moore, was a great actress, playing Starling's part as well as Jodie!
I must say I was delighted with the film's Score, a beautifull piece of artwork that fit perfectly with the moods of the film.
Most people complain about this movie not being a very good sequel to the famous Silence of the Lambs, and its because it's not, this movie is not a sequel, but a second, (third in the book series, and soon to be movie), part in the Lecter/Starling adventers.

Then he is in someone's room slicing them up. Then he is eating someone's brain for breakfast. Would you like eggs with that, Hannibal?  And enough with the ""Hello Clarise..."".....haha..very funny.

Here we see Hannibal Lecter living a seemingly ""normal"" life in Italy and Clarice Starling (now portrayed by Julianne Moore) struggling in the FBI.  To be honest some scenes in this film are sick and others are so outrageous they can only be called funny.

Hannibal COULD have been another great film, but for the most discusting, tasteless (pardon the pun), nauseating scenes I've ever witnessed.
What was Hollywood thinking! It appeares to me that every effort was made to shock and abhor the audiences. I could not eat for a long time after witnessing this discusting piece of so-called ""entertainment"". If this is what Hollywood and the American people consider entertainment, then I would like to resign my membership!
Anthony Hopkins really disappointed me by lowering himself to even consider having anything to do with such a movie! I have always been a big fan of is and will continue to be, but this was shocking and diappointing.
On the other hand I must applaud  Jodie Foster for refusing to appear in Hannibal. I imagine her reasons were due to the graphic gore. Jodie has VERY GOOD TASTE! Much better, I'm afraid, than Mr. Hopkins.

2) Put disk two in your DVD player and go to the 'DVD Credits'. On the eighth page (hit 'more' seven times). I believe one of the names on the page is 'Wes Sewell', so look for that. On that page there are some odditites in the menu system. Typically the menu options can be triggered both by scrolling to an option and hitting enter as well as hitting the number key that corresponds to it's order in the menu. In this instance hitting four is the same as hitting one (back to the main menu) and five just seems to highlight that option. But if you hit five and then scroll down six times, then to the left six times and down again six times it will open up a picture collage. There are other movements that will activate it, but that one was the first I was able to reproduce successfully.

The original was a very suspenseful psychological thriller, the duration of which you spent on the edge of your seat.  This movie is average in the thriller-like category respect.  As a matter of fact, everything about it is average, which might have gotten it 4 stars.  However, the character of Hannibal is not the same person we met in the first movie. He's different, less interesting and original, more like a common criminal.  So, we're down to three stars.  However, the ending is Horrible.  I can't emphasize it enough.  It's sickening and disturbing.  It's also gratuitous.  I like horror movies, I've watched many films both physically and psychologically disturbing.  But this went beyond it and seemed to have no point.  Thus, I end up with a 2-point rating.  Too bad, ""Silence"" could have had such a good sequel.",1024358400,3,919,4.851612903225806

It contains a plethora of features that enhance viewing and understanding of the subject matter; which is vital to the ordinary viewer who stumbles upon this DVD without the knowledge of the previous films--MANHUNTER and SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.  Manhunter was made in the 80's and was Hannibal lector's first time on the big screen.  I purchase DVDs for more than the movie; I indulge myself with most of the extra features and buy mostly for that reason alone.  I loved the ending of the book and would have liked to see it stay the same for the movie; however the ending of this film is quite good, and there are alterante endings.  The commentary with Ridley Scott is excellent and gives major insight in the construction and making of the film.  For those of you who do not listen to the commentary on DVDs, I would encourage you to do so with this one.  Ridley Scott is a very good filmmaker and he polishes his craft whenever possible.  He is at his best in this DVD and gives in-depth discussions on why certain scenes are not in the movie, and why some characters that were present in the book could not be incorporated into the movie.

The interesting side-story involves a survivor of a Lecter attack, Gary Oldman in very disturbing make-up, that will make you want to turn away from the screen. But you cant. The way the plot twists and turns will drive you mad. Lecter is so over the top as a villain, it borders on self parody, but I'll say one thing. You want to be on the Doctor's good side.

1292992,4,B00003CXSO,"The movie better streamlines Thomas Harris' out-of-control Gothic fantasy into at least a semi-palatable film.  The story is not very strong, or very believable  -  Mason Verger, the sole survivor of serial killer Hannibal Lecter's famous reign of terror, is himself a perverse and demented killer, fabulously wealthy, whose obsession is to personally capture Lecter and torture him to death for having crippled and disfigured him years ago  -  but the production and performances make it work.
Julianne Moore is excellent as the older and wiser Clarice Starling, amazingly looking and sounding more like a ten-year-older Jodie Foster than Jodie Foster.  Gary Oldman gets to (yet again) chew the scenery as another criminal grotesque  -  completely unrecognizable, beneath the disfiguring makeup  -  the sick and twisted cripple, Mason Verger.  Anthony Hopkins reprises his Oscar-winning role as the suavely psychopathic Hannibal Lecter.
The film's  -  and the book's  -  greatest problem is that its story is labored and forced.  The Silence of the Lambs didn't want a sequel, and if it was going to have one, it probably shouldn't have included the character of Clarice Starling.  But the demands of commercialism are far different from those of artistic achievement, and Silence was a phenomenally successful piece both literarily and cinematically, so Hannibal was an unfortunate inevitability.  Thankfully, the movie corrects most of the book's many shortcomings, and is a more satisfying piece of drama.",1021334400,,1509,5.4034334763948495

Clarice saving the man she fears only to be stuck at a dinner table and watching Hannibal feed a man his own brain? That scene was very sickening and hard to watch but I just couldn't tear my eyes away. The only let down is that this movie doesn't let you get to know Hannibal more. I'd like to know the first time he ate somebody. Maybe there will be a third one but I doubt it.,1021161600,2,691,4.164179104477612
1292995,5,B00003CXSO,"Having watched Silence of the Lambs beforehand will give greater understanding and appreciation of Hannibal.  This movie IS Hannibal, whereas Hannibal was just one of the characters in the former movie.  Here, he is much more developed as a character and he's free from beginning to end, whereas in Silence he was in jail until the ending.  He is a brilliant psychiatrist, he has class, he's cultured and he's mysterious.  Hannibal's handwriting even characterizes him, such as his unique signature for the title on the cover of the movie and the sheer fright of Clarice when she receives an envelope with her name on it written by him.  Hannibal's voice and speech contribute to his uniqueness of character.
Hannibal picks up where Silence left off, with a gap of time where Hannibal has been reclusive.  In this movie, he comes back into the public spotlight.  He is much more refined here, intelligent, slick, and he's a mad, cannibalistic serial killer.  Needless to say, he's intimidating.  Hannibal continues to attempt romance with Clarice, the FBI agent who is back on the case to capture him.
Unlike so many movies, this one doesn't turn out to be a good guy vs bad guy theme.  Sure Hannibal the Cannibal may sound evil and the FBI you would think would be the ""good guy"", but that's not how it turns out.  Hannibal is the star of the movie and he's not all bad.  He only kills people who seek his demise and he hates rudeness.  As Mason asked, ""Sssoo...does Lecter wanta ... 'er, kill 'er, or eat 'er or what?""  Possibly all three they think, they just don't know in what order.  But he ends up doing none of those to Clarice.  He's very polite to her.  So Hannibal isn't ""the bad guy.""  And the FBI isn't the ""good guy"" because of how as Hannibal put it, Clarice hates the FBI and it hates her.  Early in the movie she is suspended from the FBI for a drug bust gone bad that really wasn't her fault.  So thankfully, like hundreds of other movies, there isn't the usual ""good vs evil"" theme.
Francesco DePazzi works with ""Dr. Fell"" and finds out he's wanted by the FBI under the name of Hannibal Lecter.  He tries to have him captured for the reward, but Hannibal is too slick for him.  He apparently was on to him all the time, because he gives intimidating looks and gestures to Francesco, only to then appear friendly.  Hannibal tells Francesco's wife, ""I've enjoyed many good meals there [in the New England states]"" in front of him.  This must have really scared the hell out him, as Clarice warned him, ""he will kill you.""  Sure enough, Hannibal tapes him up and has him propped  on a balcony  wearing a noose.  He asks him, ""Bowels in or out?""  Obviously a little scared, and his mouth taped shut, Francesco doesn't elaborate.  ""Oh, you look confused.  Perhaps you'll allow me to decide.""  Hannibal slices him open with a knife then tosses him out the window and his bowels fall out, hanging to the ground.  Hannibal kept his word not to touch his wife if Francesco would give him information.
Mason Virger is Hannibal's only surviving victim.  Years back, Mason was a child molester and a patient of Dr. Lecter's.  Hannibal had his face torn off and fed to a dog.  The ugly deformed Mason Virger is a stark contrast with the beautiful scenes of Florence, Italy.  I was wondering why Virger, with all his money, doesn't get plastic surgery for that face of his.  The Man-eating hog pit scene was unforgettable.  It was scary how Hannibal was unrepentant and unafraid, and really, acting the same way he always does, even as he stood helplessly tied up awaiting a tortuous death.  ""Your little brother must smell almost as bad as you do now,"" says Hannibal to the man who is propping him up in the hog pit.  Hannibal slit his brother's throat in the library after he killed Francesco.  It turns out Clarice saves Hannibal and he then takes her to safety and removes a bullet from her.  Only Virger and his men are fed to the hogs.
After Hannibal stitches up Clarice, she wakes up in a bed, wearing the shoes he bought her and a dressed up beautifully in a black dress.  He undressed her for the dinner and put her in the dress.  I wonder what, if anything he did with her while she was nude and unconscious.  She is woozy and flashes of the movie are shown blurry, like we're seeing through her eyes.  This part was especially like a dream, or really a nightmare, as is the whole movie.  Hannibal is downstairs also dressed up cooking some fine food.  Her hated co-worker, whom she was the subordinate of, is also there, apparently drugged up by Hannibal.  When this man came home, Hannibal startled him by saying ""Good!  You brought the wine,"" then knocked him out.  He is then at the table with Hannibal and Clarice, only he is wearing casual clothes.  H slices open his head and cooks part of his brain and feeds it to him while he's alive.  Clarice calls the police, which Hannibal is quite aware of but he takes him time.  While he is kissing Clarice, she snaps on handcuffs so they are joined by the wrist.  She doesn't have the key, so Hannibal chops off the cuffs.  He asks, ""Above or below the wrist?""  then says, ""This is really going to hurt.""  Then all we see is the look of pain on her face but she seems uninjured afterward, while Hannibal has his arm in a sling on the plane in which he makes his getaway.
The movie ends with Hannibal getting away to an undisclosed location, leaving the possibility for a sequel to Hannibal.",1020988800,3,5456,4.5137895812053115

It seems like they were included only to help move the plot along....the means to an end.  A very disgusting, Itchy-and-Scratchy-esq end that if I hadn't eaten dinner two hours beforehand would have definitely made me sick.
  The plot seemed blurry and unfocused, but maybe I just had a hard time paying attention.  I often found myself becoming distracted by attempting to replace Julianne Moore with Jodie Foster.  That's not a knock on Julianne Moore, it's just hard to replace the original actress....especially when the role won her the Academy Award.  Despite the script, Anthony Hopkins had a ""delicious"" performance.  Sorry, there were just so many food related (and totally lame) allusions in the film; it must have rubbed off on me.
  Hanns Zimmer (""Gladiator"") wrote the score.....no complaints here.  He did a good job.  Ridley Scott was the director.  Too bad, he was really on a role.  Maybe I'm being too harsh, he didn't write the script after all.....he just directed it.  He did, however, recycle a scene from his last blockbuster ""Gladiator""....can you guess which part I'm referring to?
  Recommendation: The film lacks the intelligence and suspense that made ""Silence of the Lambs"" such a success.  However, ""Hannibal"" does provide your daily recommended serving of gore and cheesy innuendos (in reference to eating).  Don't expect much more from this movie than blood and the occasional cannibalistic cooking technique.",1020124800,,1732,5.180505415162455
1292997,5,B00003CXSO,"The book is not perfect. Yet, the film is as close to perfect as one could possibly hope for especially with all things considered such as: the major handicaps of the Silence of the Lambs (book and movie); no Jodie Foster; no sensational shocks, mostly just surprises. Between the book Hannibal and the film, the film won me over with a major margin over the book because of a single element. The ending. I firmly believe that the ending of this film was perfect because it conveyed exactly and conclusively what was there all along in The Silence of the Lambs. Hannibal Lecter's love and regard for Clarice Starling is far purer that any of his heinous acts of contempt for his enemies. Admittedly, it is rather difficult for any viewer to extract the very obscure acts of love from the sea of overwhelming horror created by Hannibal Lecter. Yes, Hannibal does have a rather awkward way of showing a gal how much he adores her as displayed in the scene when he brings Clarice's worst enemy to dinner. It is rather like your darling cat bringing you a half-dead mouse as a token of his unwavering affection. Only bigger, much, much bigger.
Hannibal's love for Clarice could never be realistically expected to bring him much in the way of eternal salvation. Yet we sense that he was somewhat less destructive during his ""retirement"" and perhaps for having known her. The only thing that appeared to set him off again was his renewed pursuit by people trying to make big money by his capture. Well, after his little talk with the Italian scholars about the equivalency of avarice and death (a medieval ideal) and the restrained but touching passion with which he conveyed this concept, it should have come as no surprise to the Commendatore Pazzi that tangling with Hannibal was not worth the lire. Not if you valued your innards more than your reputation. And speaking of past records, especially considering Hannibal's reputation.
See the film for the acts of love. Anthony Hopkins and Julianna Moore pull off the toughest acting assignment any actor could ever hope to achieve with such breathtaking grace and poetry. It is well worth enduring the stomach-turning scenes throughout the film to see the final interaction of Hannibal and Clarice. It is all about love and self-acceptance.",1019692800,3,2287,4.821882951653944

I also thought film sufferd form script rot. There lots of cheesey lines in ""Hannibal"".

1293068,3,B00003CXSO,"From all I'd read about this film, I was really expecting an F viewing experience that I'd turn off after the first half hour.  Much to my surprise, this is a good night's entertainment.  It is NOT as good a work as ""Silence of the Lambs,"" which was a solid ""A"" film but this film is lacking Jodie Foster and (director) Jonathan Demme so I'm not suprised it doesn't score as well. Anthony Hopkins is once again totally up to par on playing the cannibalistic, murderous psychiatrist, Hannibal Lecter.  He's been living a low profile for ten years but comes forward when FBI agent Starling makes it into the headlines over a street arrest gone bad.  2 opponents Hannibal must thwart are a rich former victim of his, ably played by Gary Oldman, and Starling's boss, played by Ray Liotta, who turns obnoxiousness  into almost an art form.

I was also glad to see Giancarlo Giannini play an Italian cop in this film, who tries to bring in Hannibal for a monetary reward while Hannibal is in Italy.  Julianne Moore does an able job but one can't help but compare her to Foster and there is too big gulf between the two actors in their levels of talent.  Let's just say that any actor is asking for trouble to try to take on a role Foster has already done.  The extra features are superb on this film and director Ridley Scott is a marvelous film teacher.  His commentary on the DVD is absolutely superb and no matter how you feel about the film, Scott has a lot to show you about making movies.  The special features on this DVD I'd grade an A and hubby absolutely was glued to every moment of them as he's a fiend for ""special feature"" DVDs.

1293069,5,B00003CXSO,"""Hannibal"" (2001)
Finally, after the long wait, the much-anticipated sequel to one of the best films of the 1990's, The Silence of the Lambs, has arrived. We have waited 10 years for this movie, and now that it's released, many viewers and critics disliked it. In my opinion, the gruesome Hannibal was worth the wait.
The critics and viewers disliked it because it wasn't Silence of the Lambs-ish enough. Because it didn't have the intelligence or story that The Silence of the Lambs had. Hello, it's a different movie! Sure, some characters return and it's a sequel, but this movie isn't the crime drama that The Silence of the Lambs was. Ridley Scott's goal with Hannibal was to make a gruesome and gory romantic horror film, and in my books, he has certainly succeeded.
Many say the movie is boring at the start because ""all Clarice does is look at a computer and study Hannibal Lecter."" Again, I have an argument against that statement. Clarice is developed a lot in the first half of the film. Her character is different now; she's stronger, more feisty, and she is now a full FBI agent. The way she moves and talks to people in the starting half brings Clarice's character into a whole new light, and I really liked that perspective. In The Silence of the Lambs, we knew a lot about Clarice and her past and her pains. With Hannibal, we get to learn more about her attitude and the way she sees life. I loved seeing the first half get off to a start which enables us to see different sides of the characters. Despite the title being Hannibal, this movie was way more about Clarice.  And the part about her just looking at computers and searching for Hannibal? Well, if you were haunted by endless dreams about the most terrifying cannibal in the world, I think you'd want to track him down and try to catch him, don't you? She isn't just looking at computer screens; she's thickening the plot.
Hannibal Lecter is way scarier, more vicious and more exciting in the sequel. He is now walking freely in Florence. Hannibal is funnier in this movie. When he starts to go on a murder spree, he sort of jokes about the death that is upon his victims. This isn't supposed to be funny, but I root for Hannibal and his series, and in this movie, Anthony Hopkins brings Lecter to life in such a classic cool style that's it's almost impossible not to be drawn into the wild antics of our favourite movie villain. One weird thing about him in this movie is that - spoiler area - he doesn't eat any of his victims, either that or we don't see him crunching and munching. Hannibal is displayed as more of a serial killer in this movie than a cannibal, which disappointed me somewhat. Never mind though, Hopkins makes the character interesting enough once again to stop us from moaning.
Ridley Scott's direction in this movie is superior. Fresh from his success with the massive Oscar-winning Gladiator, Scott turns this movie from a drama, to a thriller, to a romance, to a horror, to a black comedy and so on and so on. He mixes a lot of genres so there is something for everyone. Of course as you probably already know, this movie is mostly a horror film, and is definitely not for the faint-hearted, so don't go in expecting a black romantic comedy! Anyway, back to Scott's direction. Moodiness is the style that Scott presents his spectacular film in, and he endlessly uses touches to add that extra bit of perfection into the suspense scenes. I liked the way Scott keeps the level of intensity in the air at all times during the film, it added to the unpredictably and scariness of the film.
Hans Zimmer has done an excellent score for this film. The track about Clarice is really just quite brilliantly played. The music sort of expresses how Clarice is a gold-knuckles girl on the outside but a somewhat confused and frightened woman on the inside. Zimmer allows many of his ""dangerous"" sounding tracks to make us keep on task about the murders and gore in the movie. Zimmer, as usual, has made a winning musical approach to this movie.
All in all, Hannibal is a movie that grows and grows on you with each viewing. It's great to see our favourite and smartest baddie out in the open and seeking his next meal. If anything, this movie definitely confirms this character is one who'll never get tired or boring.

The script is tacky, the acting is uninspired, and the violence is completely gratuitous and is filmed in a highly distasteful way. It seems Scott wanted to glorify the good ol' American obsession with serial killers, but he has done so to a ridiculous degree. Like other of his films, the content is boring and ill thought out and the entire efforts of the filmmakers seem to have been spent on making it 'look good'. It does, but because the subject matter is so tired and uninteresting, as well as gratuitous, the film comes off as excessively distasteful. If you want to be scared, go see Texas Chainsaw massacre, where violence is TERRIFYING and well used. If you want a film that looks good afer this style, go see Gladiator - even though it too is overproduced and under-performed, at least IT has a story. This is just like a kind of overproduced car commercial with a lot of blood and guts being thrown about. It's embarrasingly poor.",1018396800,2,1001,4.535911602209945
1293072,3,B00003CXSO,"After 15 re-writes of ""Hannibal"" by writers David Mamet and Steven Zaillian, actress Jodie Foster and director Jonathan Demme dropped out because they didn't think it was good enough. With the loss of two ""Silence of the Lambs"" principals, it was difficult to replace them. Eventually, MGM/Universal hired Julianne Moore to replace Foster as Clarice, and Ridley Scott to direct the film. Two veterans, indeed, but the end equation equals nothing close to ""Silence of the Lambs"". Thankfully, Anthony Hopkins continues his ability to scare us, no matter what age, as Hannibal Lecter. Gary Oldman (uncredited), who returns as Mason Verger, wanted top billing along with Hopkins and Moore, withdrew his credit altogether. ""Hannibal"" fails to really suspense you. Now true, there's gore, but it's right in front of you, without suspense. You don't know it's coming until *boom* there's a guy being hung with his intestines spilled all over the street. At least with ""Silence of the Lambs"" you know that it was coming. Julianne Moore tries too hard to accomplish the Oscar-winning performance of Jodie Foster, and Clarice's character suffers for it. Ray Liotta is added to the mix, and is part of one of the most gory (and funny) scenes in the movie. Ridley Scott adds his dry and cut directing ability to the film, but more is needed from that aspect. The only actor that shows his stuff is Hopkins, who shows everyone that he can still surprise you. With a great supporting cast and beautiful settings, the only thing that hinders ""Hannibal"" from being in the league of ""Silence of the Lambs"" is the plot.",1018224000,3,1601,4.933333333333334

1293075,5,B00003CXSO,"I know that there are alot of fans of the book who might just disagree but the thruth is there is no other director in the world who can make this type of a movie with style and substance. I can't even imagine The Silence Of The Lambs Jhonathan Demme doing this cos it's nothing like the first film.
You have to agree with the fact that Lecter(Hopkins) is no longer behind bars so therefore heavy locations have to be used to show the kind of life he would like to be in. Clarice Starling(Moore) also has gone through some changes and I did manage to believe the fact that she could actually shoot someone in cold blood aswell as be very intelligent,now when you put these two elements and bring in a supporting cast with the likes Gary Oldman(Verger) and Ray Liotta(Paul) makes the entire film worthwhile.
The film is detailed to all of Ridley Scotts standards and you know it instantly when the movie starts and you beemed into a mansion and while the people talk about Lecter and Starling your immediately shown a disfiguered man. I haven't seen such an exciting opening sequence since The Omen. It has some superb sets and beautiful locations and you instantly fall in love with Rome(even if you are not a cannibal).
The film centres around Clarice looking for Lector once again and leading grusome murders and mayhem Hopkins is in top form to reprise his role and I am happy to se him paly the part with a certain ease rather than  another over top roayal shakespearan performance. Julianne Moore who takes over Jodie Foster is exceptionally good aswell considering Foster did win her second Oscar for this part in Silence of The Lambs.
This is not a movie for the usual action film fan nor is it for the impatient as you may have noticed that most of Ridley Scott's films take a very long time to finish.",1017014400,2,1810,4.501519756838905
1293076,4,B00003CXSO,"When ""Hannibal"" was released as a book, I was one of the people who lined up to buy it.  At that time I felt it was a let down from ""Silence of Lambs.""  While it was quite readable it lacked some fundamental level of excitement.  Because of that I did not go see the film when it was first released.  Now I find myself having mixed reactions to the DVD release, and for reasons almost the exact opposite of those I held against the book.
Don't get me wrong.  The film is really much better than the book.  The casting of Hopkins and Julianne as Lector and Starling is perfect.  The script is riveting and all the other qualities are almost too good.  In fact I would be tempted to give this every star possible except for one thing.  Ridley Scott, as director, has chosen to base the film on the book, but he deviates from the novel at several key points.  Scott himself admits that he was trying for a new interpretation of Lector the anti-hero.
Viewers will have to decide whether this is an issue for them.  It didn't really bother me until the ending itself, which is simply not what writer Tom Harris has intended.  I felt it was completely out of character with the rest of the film as well.  It is clear from Scott's commentaries on the film that this ending is exactly what he wanted.  Oddly enough, the extra material includes an alternative ending which I think is much better, even if it doesn't follow the book either.
What's good?  Almost everything else.  I've already mentioned the great acting, but what really makes the film is the great cinematography and a mindboggling score.  Right from the beginning you are confronted with a film too serene and beautiful to be a simple horror movie.  It has a lean and solemn poetry that, perhaps, gives us a glimpse into Lector's own mind.  From out of the most nerve-wracking of pieces and fragments Scott has created a romance that has no physical components - a tragicomedy where we expected a horror film.
Despite of my dislike for the ending I still would label this film a must see.  The Special Edition includes omitted scenes and trailers, Multi-Angle Vignettes, a series of 'the making of...' discussions and all the other paraphernalia of the gimmick overladen DVD issue.  Two discs of shivers and fun.",1016236800,3,2270,4.555555555555555
1293077,2,B00003CXSO,"Sometimes art gives us a villian that is more memorable and interesting than the hero. Witness for example the villians of STAR WARS: Darth Vader, Boba Fett, and Darth Maul; or the man-eating shark in JAWS; or Shakespeare's MacBeth or Iago. In 1991 another villian entered the collective group conscience and grew into a larger figure in the fabric of American pop culture. That villian's name is Hannibal Lecter and SILENCE OF THE LAMBS marked the beginning of his dynasty. Now he's back in a sequel that bears his name, HANNIBAL.
In the film it has been ten years since Lecter escaped from prison. He is now living in Italy as a Renaissance scholar named Dr. Fell. However, he is eager to come out of ""retirement"". The heroine of LAMBS, Clarice Starling, has been publicly humiliated by a botched drug raid and is put back on the Lecter case after the Justice Department gains new information concerning the cannibal's whereabouts. Starling chases the lead and the game begins anew.
Anthony Hopkins is wonderful as Lecter and Julianne Moore fills Jodie Foster's shoes well as Starling. Ridley Scott's direction is once again masterful and the other performances and crafts of the rest of the cast and crew are just as excellent.
With that said, HANNIBAL is a major disappointment. The movie starts off suspenseful, but soon falls into predictability. Sure there are a few gory twists and turns, but you know Lecter is going to escape and that he won't harm Clarice.
The movie started a controversy because of the violent, campy, gore. Certain individuals will want to see it just for those ""cool"" scenes. However, as much as I like Anthony Hopkins and as intriguing a character Hannibal Lecter is, the movie was a big let down. Just not enough substance.",1016150400,,1756,4.837209302325581
1293147,4,B00003CXSO,"Novelist Thomas Harris has written three books about Hannibal Lecter - The Silence of the Lambs, its prequel, Red Dragon, and the sequel, Hannibal. The books, with their scenes of graphic and horrific violence, are more readable than they are filmable. This has not stopped Hollywood, of course, which has even filmed Red Dragon twice - once in 1986 as Manhunter and now under the original title in a version due to be released in 2002.
Hannibal nearly didn't become a movie. In his books, Harris created two famous characters, Lecter and FBI Agent Clarice Starling, whom Jodie Foster recreated for the movie of Silence of the Lambs. Ms. Foster won the Oscar for best actress, and the role became the one for which she is most famous. Hannibal's problems arose after Foster declined to play Starling again. The book's ending showed the character doing things Foster felt her Clarice would never do. This is a classic case of artistic differences. Harris had created his version of Starling, and Foster had created another one. Eventually it was agreed that the ending would be changed, but, by then, Foster was no longer available. Getting Hopkins to agree to do Lecter again had never been a problem. Luckily, the producers discovered that another enormously talented actress, Julianne Moore, was available, and project was saved.
This movie takes place several years after Dr. Lecter's escape from a mental institution, and he's still on the loose. Clarice remains with the FBI. She isn't the naive young woman she was when she first did battle with the demented doctor. She's a seasoned veteran and has a hard edge to her. Just as she begins to suspect that Lecter has resurfaced in Florence, Italy, she gets involved in a botched FBI operation and is suspended from the bureau. This slows her down but hardly stops her pursuit of him, as she and Lecter are inevitably drawn together through the strange and twisted bond they established long ago. Meanwhile, in Italy, local police inspector Rinaldo Palli [Giancarlo Gianinni], who is more interested in the huge reward posted by one of Lecter's victims than in justice, is about to learn that the doctor is not someone you play dangerous games with.
Once more Anthony Hopkins is brilliant as Lecter. He's such a great actor that he could probably entertain us just by reading from a telephone directory. It's not his fault that the character is not quite as interesting this time. One of the most fascinating things about him in Silence of the Lambs was the fact that he was confined to a cell and had to use his mind to envision what Clarice was telling him. Since he is free in Hannibal, the role doesn't require Hopkins to use quite so many acting skills. Moore does well in the rather thankless job of replacing Foster. She wisely doesn't attempt to duplicate any mannerisms her predecessor used. She playa Starling as she might have been when she was older. Ray Liotta is sufficiently sleazy as a government official who is Starling's arch nemesis. Gary Oldham has a major role, but he isn't listed in the opening credits and is impossible to recognize except in one short flashback.
I have some fairly major complaints about the movie. The script isn't as strong as Lambs' was because it veers away from the psychological aspects. This makes it far less chilling on an intellectual level. Much of its violence is gratuitous and seemingly meant to gross the viewer out. I know you can do all sorts of tricks with computer generated graphics, but does that mean you should use them just because you can? If, for example, you graphically show someone's being eaten alive by pigs, as Hannibal does, it produces an instintive fear in most people, but, ultimately, too much of this stuff results in mere cheap thrills and brings down the level of the movie's quality.",1016064000,3,3821,4.8173515981735155
1293148,1,B00003CXSO,"I don't see how anyone can call this a good movie.  The movie spends all it's time trying to shock you.  Geez, I can get that out of any second rate slasher film.

And they don't stop there.  It seems every five minutes they are showing that grotesque millionaire's face on the screen.  The only hint of imaginatation of the filmakers was spent on gory and bloody images.  Agent Starling is almost a secondary character spending much of the film sitting in an office.
The thing that made Silence of the Lambs a good movie was the psychological battle that went on between Starling and Lecter.  You don't get any mental chess game in this trash.  All you get is gore gore and more gore.  I don't mind gore, if it applies to the plot.  Saving Private Ryan had alot of gore, but it had a purpose.  It was trying to show the horrors of war.

1293152,3,B00003CXSO,"Hannibal Lecter, brilliant, cultured, and murderous, is back, some ten years after his escape as depicted in ""Silence of the Lambs"". He's an extraordinary creation, and beautifully acted by Anthony Hopkins in a way that is at once mannered and melodramatic, and yet curiously detached and unruffled in his calm and implacable progress through life.
The original film was a much more straightforward and realistic thriller than this offering, despite its delving into the darker side of the distorted human psyche.  There was in ""Silence of the Lambs"" a series of crimes, a disturbed criminal, and the forces of law and order racing against time to rescue his lastest voctim with the  reluctant ""aid"" - if you can call it that -  and advice of an enigmatic  murderer (the cannibalistic Dr Lecter) who is himself incarcerated in a grim hospital for the criminally insane. But although we might be astonished at the  depiction of  mental abnormality provided , basically the story is a credible manhunt :with remarkable little gore and violence actually shown on screen, despite the nature of the subject.
But  ""Hannibal"" is quite different; much darker, and dreamlike. In fact  - lets face it, - the plot is really rather unbelievable and  does not bear close rational examination at all. Basically  Lecter is now enjoying his freedom under an assumed name, as  a cultured intellectual in Florence.  But he is still being hunted, by the tough and able FBI agent Clarice Starling (now acted by Julianne Moore, who took over the role very convincingly from Jodie Foster) ;  by an Italian police chief who is privately after the huge reward offered for Lecter's capture; and by the twisted and disfigured Mason Verger, (played by a totally unrecognisable Gary Oldman) who, as the only surviving victim of  Lecter's former life, is planning a grisly and over-the-top kind of revenge.  How Lecter has managed to create his new life, convince others of his new identity, and apparently enjoy a limitless income are questions that are not really answered at all.  Nor should we look too intently at other aspects of the plot; they might also turn out to be rather ludicrous. But then, we presumably are not watching this film as a piece of logical and realistic storytelling, are we?
And that leads us to a rather disturbing question: Just why are we watchiing it?  It's really a ludicrous story, and it does  not give us any  real insights into the natiure of humanity, or even  the nature of abnormal psychology (although I understand the author, Thomas Harris, has  an expert knowledge of  the weirder aspects of the serial killer's mind. I myself cannot tell  how accurate his portrayals are). We are forced, I think, to admit we are watching  this film because of its sensarionalism,  well-publicised gruesome violence, its gore, its grotesque images. And these are there in plenty ....especially the murder of the police chief (boy, do you feel that in your gut!) and the infamous supper scene....and if you really don't yet  know the details of Dr Lecter's unusual culinary creation, I won't spoil the story for you here!).
No, iwatching this film actually shows  that many of us, the audience, have suspiciously voyeuristic tendencies with regard to pain and bloodshed.  Well, thats hardly a surprise. But for all that , the film is well-made,  although it lacks the black humour that can be found in the original book (especially at the end; the surreal and dreamlike finale to the book has been changed to a  simplistic and rather unpleasant scene involving Lecter escaping yet again alone.) Certainly the depiction of Lecter as cultured and highly intelligent is striking; we even realise his choice of victim is in a distorted way, ""ethical"" by his standards, although we learn nothing in the film of his horrific chilldhood, which in the book suggests how his mental disorder originated.
To sum up, this film may have a glossy and artistic appearence, but underneath is  really  a reasonably simplistic horror film, with some startlingly nasty effects, and a lot of gore. Its actual story - and probably the motives of its makers - do not bear close examination, but it is certainly a good example of its genre, and if you are not looking for intellectual  stimulation, and have a strong stomach. it works well.
As a final note, I feel that the film's musical score, subdued and classical in style, adds to its dark and dreamlike atmosphere.  In places there is such contrast between what we hear and the images we  see that  the effect is both startling and memorable. In particular the score uses extracts from Glenn Gould's later recording of Bach's Goldberg Variations:  Gould's version , in my opinion, represents  some of the most sublime music ever recorded, and  its effect, contrasted with the grotesque visual imagery  onscreen is to make you shiver. Well,  causing shivers is, I suppose, one of the reasons this film was made. I certainly will never again be able to listen to  the slow and sombre Variation 25 whilst eating my supper! and I would guess that the gentle Mr Gould, were he still alive, would be horrified by the use of his music in this way. Still, it's effective.",1014940800,,5194,4.875712656784493

Moore tries so hard to look tough and honest that she fails terribly to the point of being unintentionally funny.
But what's to say about this movie? Well, as we all know, Hannibal Lecter is free and hiding somewhere in Italy. But one of his victims, wealthy Mason Verger is planing an elaborate scheme to get his revenge: trapping Hannibal Lecter to watch him being eaten by wild animals.

1293156,5,B00003CXSO,"I loved ""Silence of the Lambs"", the one of the handful of movies that scares the living daylights out of me. I read the book while the film version was still in its early stages. I was totally grossed out by what I read and I don't say that about just any book. The film version gave me the chills, not to mention repulsed me on the same level the novel did. I loved ""Hannibal"". Granted that I would have loved to have seen Jodie Foster reprise her classic film role, Julianne Moore gave a stellar performance as Clarice Sterling. I thought she was perfect for Jodie's replacement. ""Hannibal"" may not be nearly as perfect as ""Silence of the Lambs"" in terms of quality, I still found it thoroughly engaging and entertaining. Ray Liotta's performance as that jerk Paul Krendler was just perfect. His character was a jerk in the book and a bigger jerk in the movie. Anthony Hopkins was and is Hannibal Lechter. He was still riveting and compelling to watch as he was in ""Silence of the Lambs"". Gary Oldman as Mason Verger was priceless. He really gave me the creeps in the movie as the vengeful victim of Hannibal Lechter. For the most part, the movie stays faithful to the novel however for anyone who read the book before seeing the movie, you see the holes in the movie. Still it is rather difficult to make a film adaptation of a novel and keep it within a 2 hour limit. Despite the critics' desparaging reviews about the movie, I loved it and thought it was a worthy follow-up to a classic thriller.",1013817600,5,1501,4.442028985507246
1293207,2,B00003CXSO,"**1/2 Journey with us back into the dankest recesses of the human psyche in Ridley Scott's &#8220;Hannibal,&#8221; the long awaited sequel to &#8220;The Silence of the Lambs,&#8221; one of the darkest films ever to be awarded a Best Picture nod by the Motion Picture Academy of Arts and Sciences.  In pop culture terms, Hannibal Lector has, of course, become the modern incarnation of implacable evil.  Not only do his cannibalistic acts represent the ultimate in human moral debasement and degradation, but his seeming indestructibility makes him all that much more horrifying.  His escape at the end of the first film served as a perfect setup for this sequel, as we find Lector living a life of seeming &#8220;normalcy&#8221; in Florence, Italy, just waiting for the proper moment to come out of &#8220;retirement.&#8221;  That moment arrives when Clarice Starling, the FBI agent who helped to save Hannibal's last victim, is suddenly in the news again after an abortive and disastrous attempt to arrest a major criminal ends in the death of a number of her fellow officers.  Lector begins communicating with Clarice again, vowing to restart the game of intellectual cat-and-mouse he so enjoyed in the previous film.
For most of its running time, &#8220;Hannibal&#8221; is a pretty enticing thriller.  Anthony Hopkins repeats the brilliant work he did in &#8220;Lambs,&#8221; making this most evil of movie villains both chillingly unreachable and bizarrely compelling.  With his clipped diction and often-incisive glimpses into the dark truths of the human psyche, he keeps the audience as emotionally off-balance as he does Clarice herself.  Indeed, we understand why she is both repelled and strangely attracted to this man.  Julianne Moore, who replaces Jody Foster in the role she originated ten years ago, brings an impressive reticence and hesitancy to this woman caught between her moral dictates and her desire to know more about the evil she is confronting.  In fact, apart from this explanation, many of her actions later in the film would be inexplicable unless we were to consider her utterly incompetent at her job.  My suspicion is that the filmmakers have something deeper in mind.  In addition, writers David Mamet and Steven Zaillan have created an interesting subplot involving Giancarlo Giannini as an Italian detective who uncovers Hannibal's identity and thinks he can outsmart the devilish mastermind, capture him, turn him over to the authorities and make a fortune by collecting the reward money.  Giannini perfectly captures the subtle nuances that define this extraordinarily complex character, a man made up of many different, even conflicting moods and motives.
So far, so good.  But then - inevitably perhaps with material of this nature - the filmmakers cannot resist going overboard into downright incredibility and gruesomeness as the film approaches its denouement.  Even those familiar beforehand with the tenor of this story may well be appalled by some of the turns the film takes in its latter stages.  In the past, one used to encounter scenes like these only in low budget exploitation films like &#8220;The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.&#8221;  Now they are being fed &#8211; pardon the pun &#8211; to mass audiences in the guise of slickly marketed &#8220;entertainment.&#8221;  Poor Ray Liotta &#8211; I will never be able to look at him from here on out without seeing him in the condition he ultimately ends up in at the close of this film.  It is an image too indelible to ever be completely forgotten and goes well beyond the pale even for a film on this nasty a subject area. Moreover, whereas the first film ended on a note of clever, albeit macabre black humor, &#8220;Hannibal&#8221; closes with a scene that is simply sickening in its unbridled grotesquerie.
Of course, complaining about the level of gruesomeness in a film about a serial cannibal may smack one as a bit of a Pollyanish stance for a knowledgeable viewer to take.  Still, the first two-thirds of the film, in which the writers and director exercise an admirable amount of restraint, prove that this material can be even more effective when it is dealt with through indirection than when it is all laid out for us in such grisly, graphic detail.  There is much to recommend &#8220;Hannibal,&#8221; but unless you have a cast iron stomach and a very short memory span, you may well want to skip out before the final curtain is finally wrung down on the scene.  That is if you ever want to eat again.",1013299200,2,4513,5.07027027027027

Did anybody recognize gary Oldman before cast was shown?? I would have bet it was Bruce Dern; he is now so ugly and old, that he would not have needed make up. Oldman's ""performance"" is as senseless as deVitto's ""acting"" in penguin costume in ""Batman""... speaking of Batman, both Hannibal and Mason resemble Riddler a little bit, and a film is marred by these flaws as well as by clumsy ending - Hannibal's Hudini-like escape. But because this is one of two best films in 2001 (Amelie is the first), I give 5 stars...
Mamet wrote again a good script, and he followed the rules of the genre, and now we have the real thriller... He also ""transcribed"" the profound Harris' book to the motion pictures as much he could, within the limits of A-produstion, and the new spirit of time 1990s...
Julianne Moore was O.K., but she could have ben replaced by Nicole Kidman and Lindsey Frost.
Giancarlo Giannini was unbelievable good!
Francesca Neri showed her legs and feet (unlike Moore - I wonder why??), and no Italian  beautiful woman can do any harm to a pictures...
Ray Liotta has just repeated himself from J. Demmie's ""Something Wild"" from mid1980s; he wasn't insipred at all.
Zimmer's music enchanting.
I would pint to clever parrallesm between Starlig and Kommendatore Pazzi: she washes baby covered with blood, while he washes his hands in Florence's fountain, after hee took a bracelet from dying pickpocket; thanks to Mamet this parallelism can be developed further througout the whole film. Hannibal had to become a little bit ""gayish"" in the harmony with new spirit of time, Clarise had to become at least spiritual aristocrat by the means of tumbler-pigeon metaphor, and TWO IDEAS WITH ONE BIRDS, two birds with one stone, mamet showed idea from the book - genetical predilections an redemption in the connection with great research on Italian art history and biblical motiffs...

You take Julianne Moore (who isn't as good as Jodie Foster) and the incredible Anthony Hopkins, who are both terrific actors, and you put them in a movie that is less than stellar.
Hannibal is filled with too much gore, distasteful innuendos, and a horrible plot.  It could be difficult to follow for some.  Silence of the Lambs was a masterpiece, but Hannibal slanders the name masterpiece.
If you truly love suspense, you will NOT like this movie...However, if you're into the whole blood/guts thing, you'll probably love this movie.",1010361600,2,736,4.872
1293215,2,B00003CXSO,"Let me start by saying that unlike most who have reviewed this film, I am a huge fan of the movie Manhunter.  As far as I am concerned, Michael Mann's adaptation of Thomas Harris' Red Dragon is by far the best of the 3 films based on Harris' novels.  To this day I do not know how Silence won 5 academy awards while Manhunter was completely forgotten.
All that being said, I purchased Hannibal at a video rental shop for $10.  I purchased this film mainly to complete my collection of Harris Films.  Now I will tell you that there is no other real reason to purchase this film.
Hannibal is the third book in a series of novels by Thomas Harris, all of which feature FBI agent protagonists tracking Serial Killers.  In the film version of Hannibal, Anthony Hopkins reprises his academy award winning role as Hannibal Lecter, believed by basically everyone in Harris' world to be the most dangerous man who has ever lived.  If you loved Hopkins outrageously over-the-top theatrics in Silence, then will still like him in this film.  Hopkin's lecter was apparently perfect the first time around, because he hasn't changed a lick in 10 years.  Julianne Moore takes over the role of naive FBI cadet Clarice Starling, now 10 years into a career at the FBI.  Moore is a very beautiful and talented actress who is completely thrown away in this movie.  Aside from doing a very good Impression of Jodie Foster's accent from Silence, She doesn't figure into this film very much.  Hannibal is basically the story of Lecter's only surviving victim, A mutilated cripple named Mason Verger, who is hunting lecter for revenge.
The biggest problem with this film is that it has no substance.  All of the secondary characters are black-and-white cardboard cut-outs without so much as the depth of a kiddie-pool.  We have the Male-chauvanist Justice Dept. rep who is intent on destroying Clarice because she has rejected his sexual advances.  We have the greedy, immoral older policeman in Italy who is forever trying to fulfill the desires of his beautiful young wife and pays the price.  We have the higher-ups at the FBI who crucify Starling immediately upon her very public participation in a wild-west shootout for which she is IN NO WAY RESPONSIBLE.  We have the never-ending series of tough, male G-men who insist on treating Starling (who by all rights should be an FBI living legend after the events of silence) like an insipid little girl.  But in the final analysis, what we are missing is the consummation of a formula that has worked in the past, and always will work...in this movie, the guilty are not punished.  Manhunter and Silence work so well because of the fact that they are straightforward morality tales of using a pet monster to catch a monster that is on the loose.  Hannibal Lecter works much better as a dangerous insect under glass who can be consulted when his unique and terrifying knowledge and viewpoint are needed.  In this movie, we have no heroes and no villian.  Is Verger a villian?  It seems to me that twisted as he is, he is bent on doing the world a HUGE favor by ridding it of Lecter.  What we have here is a movie that does not follow the formula of good guys chase bad guy, catch bad guy, and punish bad guy.  The film simply breaks down on multiple levels.
Now I've had the discussions with people that this film is all about Lecter and Starling, and their mutual fascination with one another.  If this were the case, they might actually be expected to share more than one scene together.  If this is the story that Harris was trying to tell, either he or the screenwriter failed utterly.
OK.  So I have massive problems with the plot and structure of the film.  There is an upside.  This film, like all of Scott's films, is both absolutely gorgeous, and technically wonderful.  If there is a film-maker alive today with a better command of the art of making films look good than Ridley Scott, I could not tell you who that person is.  The sets, locations, costumes, lighting, color, framing, composition, yadda, yadda, etc. are amazing.  This is one of the best looking films of the year.  What a shame that this basically means it is exquisite wrapping paper with an empty box inside.
In conclusion, I have to say that as hard as I have been on this film, I did not hate it.  I sat through a film that was pleasant enough, all the while bemoaning the masterpiece that might have been.  In the final analysis, this movie turns out to be a B-movie thriller with an A-list cast, and that is it's final shame.  Unless you saw this movie in the theater and loved it so much that you cannot live without owning it, pass on the DVD.",1010361600,7,4655,4.58645707376058
1293216,4,B00003CXSO,"After watching SILENCE OF THE LAMBS several years ago, I was ""en-grossed"" with the brilliance of Dr. Hannibal Lecter, and the performances of Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster.  Hannibal ""the Cannibal"" Lecter did not dine much in the first movie as he was more preoccupied with Agent Clarice Starling of the FBI and helping her nab Buffalo Bill, Lecter's former patient and infamous serial killer.  SILENCE had enough gore and graphic content, but HANNIBAL makes the former look sheepish.  If you like blood and mutilation, you will enjoy this movie, because it is not for the faint of heart.  On a more positive note, HANNIBAL is a movie with much intrigue and suspense.  You will have to watch and listen closely in between meals or you just might miss something.
The real story is set in motion with one of Dr. Lecter's surviving victims, Mason Verger, devising a plan to get his revenge from a previous encounter that forever disfigured his face.  Verger, a multimillionaire, places a bounty of $3m on information leading to Lecter's whereabouts so he can carry out his diabolical plan.  Verger hates the doctor so much that he wants to send him to the pig farm.
Meanwhile the celebrated Agent Starling, who cracked the Buffalo Bill case, has innocently been accused for botching a more recent FBI operation with her envious supervisor, Deputy Assistant Inspector Paul Krendler, apparently desiring to remove her from the force.  An internal FBI investigation leads Starling a reassignment to the Lecter case, which she finds fascinatingly refreshing.  Of course, Lecter has become one of the FBI's Ten Most Wanted criminals in the world and has ingeniously escaped their clutches for years; therefore, Krendler thinks it will preoccupy Starling's time.
This is the point where all the characters and subplots begin to converge, and all eyes focus on HANNIBAL.  Does he like the attention?  I think so, but woe to any that are rude or seek to advance their own cause by using the good doctor.  He states this fact simply, ""I don't like rude people.""  Moreover, Lecter (alias Dr. Fell) becomes enraptured that Clarice has entered the investigative fray, for he admires her very much.  Could this be love?  You will have to discover this for yourself in the myriad of gore and bloodletting.  Another observation, ""Who is the good guy and the bad guy in this one?  Or should I say, who is the rotten apple in a basket of bad apples?""  It becomes cloudy as the story progresses.
Ridley Scott has directed another fine film, of course not the caliber of GLADIATOR, which won him Oscar.  As far as the cast, one cannot say enough about Anthony Hopkins (Oscar winner) who performs wonderfully as the brilliant and deranged doctor.  The character seems to be a perfect fit for him, and one could not imagine another replacing him.  Hopkins is arguably the greatest actor of our time, and performs masterfully in everything he undertakes; therefore, one can simply call him, ""Sir"".
Julianne Moore put in a top-rate performance as Agent Starling; however, who can replace a superior actress like Jodie Foster?  It seemed Moore lacked some of the intensity and feeling that Foster portrayed as the Special FBI Agent.  In supporting roles, Gary Oldman matches step with Hopkins as Mason Verger, especially having to play the part with a mangled face.  Ray Liotta (FBI Deputy Assistant Inspector Paul Krendler) put in good performance, but I was especially impressed with Giancarlo Giannini as Inspector Renaldo Pazzi.  He played the part of the disheveled detective looking for a break out of his profession by making it big on bounty money.
In conclusion, a word of advice when viewing HANNIBAL: Be careful of what you eat before, during, and after the film.  This one is not for children under 17.",1009929600,,3790,4.910518053375196
1293277,5,B00003CXSO,"Hannibal is a horror masterpiece. It is an exotic, sensual, and sensory experience in which beauty reigns over decadence. Unlike The Silence of the Lambs, Hannibal is a genre film, which is essentially why it has been so cruelly dismissed. The film by Jonathan Demme is a ""psychological thriller"" while Hannibal is a gore film closer to the films of Dario Argento and Lucio Fulci than say Alfred Hitchcock. But unlike the wave of teenage oriented slasher films of the last few years, Hannibal is made for adults with a sense of aesthetics.
Director Ridley Scott cared about this film and it shows. Hannibal is one of the most beautifully conceived films of 2001. Cinematographer John Mathieson and Ridley Scott have created a world filled with subtle and precise lighting and color tones that ooze with both sensuality and dread. The score by Hanz Zimmer is also one of the most emotional and complex piece of instrumental music of any contemporary year. Zimmer uses classical instruments and classically inspired sounds to convey powerful emotions, from the romantic (""The Burning Heart"") to the chilling (""Dear Clarice""). Most admirable is the original opera composition which uses a libretto from Dante's ""La Vita Nuova"", making it the first text of the Italian poet to ever be put to music in a film.
Of course, we cannot talk about Hannibal Lecter, now a legendary film and literary villain, without talking about Anthony Hopkins who plays the character for the second time. In the Ridley Scott film, Dr. Lecter becomes the main character, giving Hopkins the opportunity to explore the character's complexities. For some reason, Lecter isn't as scary in Hannibal as he was in The Silence of the Lambs which was one of the main problems for the numerous critics and filmgoers who refuted the film upon its release (and still do to this day). But what Hopkins does bring to his slightly transformed Lecter is dark humor and charisma. Lecter delivers a series of memorable one-liners (""I'm giving very serious thought...to eating your wife"", ""Your little brother must smell as badly as you do by now"", ""spoken like a true Protestant"", ""You've met Mason...face to face, so to speak"", etc.) establishing his attractive yet perverse nature. Lecter's presence is also felt by his eerie stillness, wicked smile, and gentleman appeal.
In Hannibal, Julianne Moore takes over the role that Jodie Foster made famous in the previous Thomas Harris film adaptation. Like most people, when I first heard that Jodie Foster had officially declined the role of Starling in the so-called sequel to Lambs, I was disappointed and expressed doubts about the credibility of the movie. But once I got passed the initial shock of losing Jodie Foster and learned of Moore's involvement in the film I was most pleased. Julianne Moore was already one of my favorite actresses. With movies like Boogie Nights, The End of the Affair, and The Myth of Fingerprints Moore proved to be one of the best actresses working today. I still sometimes wonder why Jodie Foster rejected the part considering the participation of Ridley Scott and Anthony Hopkins. Nevertheless, a character does not belong to an actor, no matter what, especially when that character comes from a literary source. In fact, in Micheal Mann's Manhunter, Lecter was played by Brian Cox. In the upcoming remake of Manhunter, Red Dragon-the original title of the novel by Thomas Harris, Harvey Keitel will play the role of Jack Crawford. In Manhunter, Dennis Farina played Crawford. In Lambs, it was Scott Glenn. Thus, if you are willing to see Hannibal as a separate entity, not a sequel to the more sober but just as great Jonathan Demme film, you can savor Julianne Moore's emotionally measured performance.
In the DVD's audio commentary, Ridley Scott offers a fascinating and informative analysis of his film while responding to the various criticisms that have plagued Hannibal (ex. why is Lecter without plastic surgery? why the pigs? what is the relation between Cordell and Mason?, and so on). Besides the commentary, the DVD provides an interesting but somewhat shallow documentary, fantastic multi-angle featurettes of the opening action scene, wonderful trailers and TV Spots, an extraordinary photo gallery, and much more...
One of the best DVD's of the year.
For me, Hannibal is a film to cherish...although it will never become the phenomena that was The Silence of the Lambs, nor will it win any major awards, but I believe that with time it will become a cult classic much like Argento's Suspiria, the Evil Dead films, De Palma's The Phantom of the Paradise, Big Trouble in Little China, The Wicker Man, or even Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut.",1009843200,,4690,5.014102564102564

Brains behind a sequel.  That's something you don't see very often.  Ridley Scott did a great job directing, and Anthony Hopkins was as good, if not better.  The movie seemed to gel perfectly together.  It moved at an eloquent pace and left you in awe at times.  The Cinematography was fantastic.
Hannibal is a great film that I am happy I finally watched.  When you go to Blockbuster and use a free rental, and not watch the movie and end up with a late fee, it kind of leaves a sour taste in your mouth.  But, never the less, Hannibal is a must see movie and shouldn't be seen after a heavy meal.  5 Stars",1009670400,,1070,4.425641025641026
1293281,1,B00003CXSO,"This is a movie you'll wish you'd never seen.
I would not recommend this film to anyone!!
More suspense and a lot less gratuitous graphic violence would have made this a good movie. Except toward the end, where was the interaction between Clarice Starling and Hannibal?  Where was the suspense? It would have been more suspenseful if Clarice had gone to Italy on her own (after getting in trouble at the FBI for botching that drug bust) and tracked down Hannibal, and then there could have been more of a question of whether or not Hannibal would have hurt Clarice.
  Anthony Hopkins gives a good performance with the script that he was given, but he was much more spookier in the first film; maybe because his hideous crimes were mostly left up to the viewer's imagination.  Certainly the crimes Hannibal Lecter commits in this film are frightening, but the gore is gratuitous-ESPECIALLY the brain scene at the dinner table toward the end of the film.  That level of gore seemed to be thrown in for Hannibal the cannibal fans, and lowered this film to the level of disappointment that it is.
The very very end, how they closed the scene, ( I don't know what you call it) the screen gets smaller and smaller into a circle and ends up on Hannibal's eye before going to a black screen-THAT was laughable.  That was like the ending in a cartoon.  It didn't fit because this was not a funny movie.
There were so many things that could have been fixed in this movie to make it a better-there's too many to count! Jodie Foster made a great career move in dumping this script.  Good for her!
Don't waste your money on this film!!!",1009670400,,1623,4.534246575342466
1293282,4,B00003CXSO,"As a film sequel, HANNIBAL was bound to disappoint many of its customers.  It is stylistically very different from its legendary forebear, THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.  The older film is a sober precedural mystery-thriller with a seductive monster central to the plot.  The sequel is a stylish celebration of that very monster, self-consciously humorous and departing boldly from the Thomas Harris novel.  The crucial role of Clarice Starling is played by another actor, and with ""Hannibal the Cannibal"" free of his jail cell and endowed with an almost supernatural intellect and power, we tread some dangerously campy territory where Hopkins says ""goody-goody"" and the fans giggle with glee.
The DVD's features help one to appreciate how well-made and well-acted the film truly is.  Investigate director Ridley Scott's commentary on some of the deleted scenes, the film itself, and the alternate ending they shot.  It is most educational.  The ""making of"" documentary is mostly self-adoring, but there is interesting information in there as well.  One comes to appreciate how carefully made the film is, and what a challenge it was to film this story and make a credible movie.  Thomas Harris may even have set them a challenge that was impossible, especially with the infamous dinner scene.
Finally, I appreciate the ending of the film far more than the far-reaching conclusion of the novel.  The film's script brings Agent Starling and Hannibal together in a confrontation which tests Starling's integrity and courage, and Hannibal's ultimate admiration of this ""deep roller.""  So much so, that he makes a painful sacrifice to preserve his own freedom and fly away.",1009497600,,1665,5.198501872659176

1293284,5,B00003CXSO,"When Hannibal first came into theatres, I was hearing horrible comments about the film from nearly everyone I know who saw it.  So I decided to wait to see the film until it came out for home rental.  After having watched it, however, I do not understand why I heard so many negative comments about this movie!  I was absolutely taken by the detailed cinematography.  The look and feel of the film and soundtrack definitely has and arthouse-like quality to it.  Anthony Hopkins once again took my breath away with his manipulative, dominating and psychotic yet somehow seductive performance of the Hannibal Lecter role.  I felt that Julianne Moore did very well with performing the more experienced FBI agent Starling.  The one thing that my heart burned throughout the film for was more interaction between Clarice and Hannibal.  Their interaction in the latter part of the film was so haunting and it left me hungry for more.  Many people were aggrevated by this lack of interaction, but I do have to point out that the way in which Lecter haunts agent Starling in the earlier portion of the film definitely builds a hunger for the interaction that does come later in the film to satify the desire to see Clarice and Hannibal together.
If this is your first time seeing the film, I do definitely recommend it.  It's very different from Silence of the Lambs, but I wouldn't go so far to say that it is worse.  I think that if you see the movie expecting to see more of Silence then you will definitely be disappointed.  Try to watch it with your mind a clean slate.  And if you haven't seen Silence of the Lambs, here's an idea.  Watch Hannibal first, then watch Silence.  I think that would be the most complementary way to watch both films.
Oh yeah, and it's really not that gorey.  I've seen the same stuff on E.R.  Minus the man eating boars...",1009238400,2,1849,4.588414634146342

1293286,4,B00003CXSO,"After the acclaimed 'Silence Of The Lambs', a sequel was almost inevitable.  When it was finally disclosed that there would be, there was much speculation on who exactly would get the role - it seemed to be between Gillian Anderson and Julianne Moore.  Whilst Anderson may have been the more obvious choice, her role as Scully in leading TV series 'The X-Files' actually being based on that of Clarice Starling, Julianne Moore is fantastic.  Where Jodie Foster turned down the role for the movie being too graphic (she's right), Moore makes the most out of a very different character.  Whereas 'The Silence Of The Lambs' depended on Clarice and Hannibal's interaction, a few years down the line we've got a much more subdued, hardened Clarice that spends most of her time in the basement of the F.B.I (again with the Scully links).  When she actually does meet Lectre, it's utterly mesmerising - this down to great performances on both sides.
As for Hannibal's character, it's become a little camp with phrases such as 'goodie goodie' and 'okey dokie' that are nowhere near as unnerving as the director obviously intended them to be.  It is unfortunate that when the audience is treated to old tapes of some of Hannibal's most famous quotes from the previous film, that we get to realise that the character is just not as good.
Disregarding this though, it's very competent and managed to evade being pulled apart by the critics.  Ridley Scott also gets rid of, or lessens the role of, several characters in the book such as Margot and Barney that played out an interesting subplot in the book.  There are some scenes from Thomas Harris' novel that doubtless people wanted to see, such as Verger's disembowlment by a huge conger eel, but these are cut.  Although this may upset some fans, in the long run it works and cuts the long book down a great deal without taking from the main story.

1293368,2,B00003CXSO,"Review:
How you like this movie depends on whether you read the book, whether you like gruesome scenes, and whether you appreciate sequels. This is an well done movie that has a few very gruesome scenes and an ending that differs from the book.
The script is well written, Anthony Hopkins is, of course, very good in his role, (but, you have to get past the cheesy voice overs that are supposed to be from ""Silence of the Lambs"") and Julianne Moore plays an excellent Agent Clarice Starling (a tough act to follow after Jodie Foster's role). Director Ridley Scott makes another great movie (Gladiator was similarly excellent while being gruesome, but not quite as gross as this).
The photography is stunning (except the grossly gruesome disgusting scenes). The locations are beautiful. The music is excellent. The editing is wonderful. The deeper uses of symbolism is intriguing and challenging, Etc. Etc. Etc. There really are some many technically and artistically great things about this movie; but in the end (literally) it becomes exceptionally gruesome, with a extraordinarily odious and contemptible final scene.
The movie IS Recommended if:
You like an intense drama with gruesome scenes.
The movie IS NOT Recommended if:
You are sensitive, or can be offended by the several scenes that go too far.",1008720000,,1306,5.050925925925926
1293369,2,B00003CXSO,"The score by Hans Zimmer was about the only aspect of this movie that kept it from one-star territory.  Zimmer's music is gorgeous and helps the movie as much as it can, which isn't enough.
As soon as I heard that Thomas Harris was writing a ""sequel,"" I balked.  You can't write a sequel that follows a book (and movie!) that good with the ending it had.  Lecter walks off down the street never to be heard from again.  Repeat:  never to be heard from again.  To bring him back, in print or in film, was a big mistake.  Let us just imagine what Lecter's life has been like these last ten years as we watch SILENCE again on a re-release or something. . . .  I know sequels are all the rage, and some even work.  LETHAL WEAPON?  Sure, make all you want--just change the criminals and their crimes.  MISSION IMPOSSIBLE?  Sure, just make sure the second one makes sense (which they did).  STAR TREK?  Sure, whatever, make a dozen (halfway there!).  AUSTIN POWERS?  That's close.  HOME ALONE?  Sure, I'll even buy that.
But great (or even really good) books, therefore movies, do not lend themselves well to sequels.  Or follow-ups.  Or whatever they want to call HANNIBAL.  You can follow up GONE WITH THE WIND with SCARLETT years later, but how many Pulitzers or Oscars are you going to win. . . ?  The ultimate blame lies with Thomas Harris, so maybe I should be reviewing the book (that's right, I boycotted it!).  I watched the movie primarily to hear Anthony Hopkins do Hannibal with different dialogue.  His voice isn't the same, though.  Nor is his character.  He is just silly rather than immaculately psychotic.  Clarice's character is way different--that's a draw (Jodie Foster made the smart choice).  Ridley Scott did what he could with the script, I'm sure, and some of the scenes in Florence are beautiful.  However the whole premise is entirely implausible, the action and dialogue are forced, and the ending is just plain foolish.  The dining room scene comes across as funny, which is not what Harris, Scott, or Hannibal, even, would have wanted.
My advice:  rent SILENCE OF THE LAMBS again, read that book if you haven't already, buy the soundtrack to HANNIBAL, and just listen to that; while listening, imagine where Hannibal and Clarice would be by now and make your own story--don't let Thomas Harris or Ridley Scott try to tell you.  You can't do any worse. . . .",1008720000,,2381,4.608591885441528

None of the characters are sympathetic. You wish Hannibal dies. No more Hannibal Lecter films please. Anthony Hopkins obviously needed the pay check as his role was very pedestrian.

1293372,5,B00003CXSO,"""Hannibal"" has to be the most twisted and sick movies that has ever been produced.  That is not necessarily a bad thing.  The vivid images captured on film in ""Hannibal"" will stick in my mind for the rest of my life.  The whole movie was absolutely intriguing.  Dr. Lecter is the most complex character in recent memory.  He comes across as brutal, but at the same time, hilarious. I give this movie a raving ""thunbs up!""
 ""Hannibal"" is about an FBI agent named Clarice Starling tracking down the escaped mass-murderer, Hannibal Lecter.  Mason Verger, one of Lecter's victims, also looks for Lecter for the purpose of revenge.  This is the sequel to the film, ""The Silence of the Lambs.""  It is difficult for a sequel to surpass the original, but ""Hannibal"" has come to a par with the original.  The characters are much more interesting this time around.
Why is ""Hannibal"" so twisted?  This is a question that I have had a lot of difficulty answering.  By the end of the movie, you find yourself hoping that nothing happens to the doctor.  Lecter commits gruesome acts of violence, yet he is irresistible as a person.  He is not a bad person, just seriously demented.  Dr. Lecter only harms people when he sees them as a drain on society.  He is doing the world a favor by eating these ""horrible"" people.  All of Lecter's murders have a reason behind the madness.  Mason Verger was Hannibal Lecter's fourth victim, and a child molester.  Mason used his smile to entice the little ones, so Lecter coerced him to feed that smile to the dog--in a scene that defies all imagination.
Hannibal Lecter is my favorite character of all time.  Lecter spouts quick-witted comments to go with his deeds.  His brand of humor is something that I have never seen before.  Lecter makes it easy to laugh when someone is being mutilated, very graphically, on screen.  This is not an easy thing to accomplish.
Anthony Hopkins gives a performance that embodies Dr. Lecter's character like no one else could.  His performance is again fit for an Academy Award.  Julianne Moore plays Clarice Starling in a less than perfect performance.  In some of the scenes she seems too cocky, and cockiness hasn't characterized Clarice Starling's personality from either the first movie or the two books.
A major point that stuck out in ""Hannibal"" was the vivid depiction of the murders.  Without the graphic nature of these scenes, ""Hannibal"" would have been a different movie.  With these inages we are taken to the brink of insanity, the realm of Dr. Lecter.  In this case, the violence is necessary to introduce a theme; ""Sinners beware; Dr. Lecter is here.""
There is no better entertainment that I can think of than to spend a night than in the grips of madness with the best-played character of all time.  ""Hannibal"" is a movie that taxed my brain to no end.  I think that everybody should see the derangement of Hannibal Lecter to see a new side of human nature.  Hannibal is a film that I will be thinking about for a long time.  If that doesn't denote a good movie, than I do not know what could.",1007683200,,3071,4.648698884758364

Recently viewing Silence of the Lambs again, I feel that Silence and Hannibal strive to be two totally different films. Jonathan Demme's opus was more about mood and psychological havoc, where Ridley Scott's is more about the scenery, physical pain, and shcoking suspense. Both films are brilliant in their own respects. But I find that Hannibal is more stylish and sleek. it has more showmanship pulsing through its maniacal veins.

This film is all about gore.  It's about how much blood can be splashed around the scenery, how many body parts can be thrown about, how many bodies can be cut up.
There is no real plot other than a millionaire, who happens to be one of Hannibal's few surviving victims, who searches and captures Lechter.  Don't fret, Agent Starling (played unconvincingly in this film by a forgettable famous actress) saves him.  He gets away in a nick of time, though, due to her stupidity (yes, stupidity--in ""Silence"" Starling was a bit naive, here she's just plain stupid), obviously hoping for another sequel (which is in the works).

Silence of the Lambs made me feel uncomfortable.  It was eerie and dark throughout; the movie had a sombre tone.  That tone is missing in Hannibal.  Dr. Lecter seems to have lost some of his pizazz in this movie.

When word got out that ""Hannibal"" was going to be filmed, expectations were high, and critics gave the movie no love, often comparing it unfairly to the far better ""The Silence of the Lambs."" But ""Hannibal,"" as a film by itself, is a decent picture, and should be watched with an open mind, flaws and all. Julianne Moore gave a great performance as Clarice Starling, although Anthony Hopkins verged on camp during his revisited role as Hannibal Lecter. Some of the scenes were so outrageously graphic, it was often hard to take them seriously and realize the full horror of Lecter's actions. But for all its shortcomings, ""Hannibal"" the DVD is a worthy purchase because MGM gave this disc such a deluxe treatment. The picture and sound are top-notch, while the features on the second disc inlcude multiple angle shots, documentaries, and other goodies. So my advice is this: if you hated ""Hannibal,"" then you're not going to find much to like here.

I thought I could depend on Scott to give us photography as good as he given us before (Legend, Thelma and Louise). But NO! I have to get that MAJOR gripe out of the way first. But I have some other gripes. Mainly that the film is incredibly boring and has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. Hopkins was cool and creepy in SOTL but here he is just campy and hammy. Did he deliberately try to turn Hannibal Lector into a gay icon?

SOTL received 4 Academy Awards but Hannibal deserves a truckload of Razzies. There are countless, scenes after scenes, of Clarice watching tapes of surveillance cameras and some Italian cop pacing about a rainy and miserable Florence. Ray Liotta pops up occasionally playing a role that was played by someone else in SOTL. He doesn't do much and contributes ZERO to the story.

And on that note, even the gore factor was a joke compared to its hype...the film's gore imagery was so ridiculous and over the top that it was far more comedic than frightening.
No comparison with Silence of the Lambs (or any other film for that matter), no hand-wringing over the film's ridiculous gore, and no regret over any likeness or lack of likeness to the book, is necessary to judge this moronic waste of celluloid as anything but a mind-numbing insult to intelligence.

My sincere hats off to Jodie Foster for her show of integrity, whatever it was worth, in not having been dragged into being a part of this sorry mess...I've never respected her more.  And if ever I ask myself what made me lose what used to be a healthy amount of respect for both Anthony Hopkins and Julianne Moore, there is no doubt at all where I'll point.  This is the most insultingly stupid and plainly awful film that Hollywood has churned out in several years, and a complete embarrassment to some noteworthy, talented actors that may be laughing to the bank, but who have destroyed a large part of the professional credibility they once enjoyed with intelligent movie-goers.
Anyone claiming that this film is ""brilliant"" should have their right to use that word revoked permanently.  And stay away from complex machinery.",1005696000,4,1895,4.658682634730539

I just knew this was going to be a great movie.  I have not read the book so I had no idea what the story line would be.  To say that the sequal was a let-down is an understatement.  What was so great about SOTL, was the intriguing relationship between Clarice and Dr. Lector.  The movie was suspensful and the story line kept you on the edge of your seat.  After seeing this movie I understood completely why Jodi Foster did not replay her role as Clarice.  Hannibal is an insult to the first movie.  SOTL was a psychological thriller, Hannibal is nothing more than a disgusting Hollywood flop.  I love action movies and don't mind the scenes where the violence gets a little gory but this movie is just gross.....VERY GROSS. The last 20 minutes of the movie are so gross that I had a hard time watching it and had to look away during some parts of it.  The awesome personality of Dr. Lector in the first movie is not present in this one.  Most of his scenes in the movie are him doing something disgusting.  The second book was written for the sole purpose of making money.  The plot is horrible....I'm sorry that I saw the movie.",1005004800,,1292,4.3112033195020745

Dr. Lecter is his usual awesome self, and Anthony Hopkins does his usual exceptional demonstration of gifted acting ability. Paul Krendler deserved whatever he got (I never liked him anyway), and I thought everything was very original. Who would have thought up man-eating boars!?
Character development, which most people say sucked in Hannibal, with Clarice and the good doctor was for the most part done in Silence of the Lambs anyway, so whatever Hannibal lacked, it already had its foundation in Silence.

There is only ONE Hannibal Lechter and thats Anthony Hopkins and there is only one Clarice and of course that's Jodie F. OKOK so I'm one of the dinasours that believes that theres only ONE James Bond and that is Sean Connery ......
Julianne Moore does an acceptabble job but she just seems to have that hardened edge of a street wise late 30's New York kind of woman. Jodie Foster, does not, she always looks counrty no matter how many guns she has in her hands..... Along the lines of mis-casting, I thought that Ray Liotta, as Clarices scheming miserable back stabbing boss, was poop.... he never convinced me as an FBI type that's for sure...
The DVD is fabulous and, in most respect, true to the book. Matter of fact I preferred the movie since the ending was left wide open as compared to the book that had what I really considered was a completly shocking surprise ending.
The movie also left out Mason Verger's sister almost completely ... HMMMM wonder why ... I thought she added a little intrigue to the show .... and well we won't talk about Vergers Micheal Jackson type of obsession for playing games with kids that were also omitted in the movie.....
On a happy note, the pigs astounding and if they have an academy award for animals then these 550 pound beauties get my vote thats for sure ....

1293526,5,B00003CXSO,"I was prepared upon walking into ""Hannibal"" I, like everyone else had the pleasure of viewing ""Silence of the Lambs"" in order to prepare myself for the upcoming sequel. After watching ""Silence"" I was looking forward to it, and I wasn't disappotinted. Because upon watching it I realized the this was Hannibal's movie. He was no longer going to be the madman confined away, spouting eerie rhetoric. Now The cannibal is loose and you'd better brace yourself if you intend to follow him.
I think the problem people had with ""Hannibal"" was that they were expecting another ""using Hannibal to track another serial killer"" movie. Well I knew that it was going to nothing of the sort. I knew that if we're tracking Hannibal, we were going to be playing an all new ball game. We follow him from Florence, Italy, living the quiet life as Museum curator Dr. Fell. Story-wise I couldn't think of a more appropriate place to find him. It was elegant, beautiful, but yet bears a darker side, traits that equate that of Hannibal Lecter. Even the movie itself has those traits. Director Ridley Scott obviously knew what he had in mind when he took on this project, because the whole film I felt as if I were peering into his being. The look of Hannibal is sleek, delicate, and intense. Ridley Scott knows how to create the atmosphere.
Take for example. Probably the most standout scene in the film is the dinner scene. The camera working was simple. It didn't require Matrix-like cinematography. But the one shots were all bust shots looking at each characters from the shoulders up. It displays the energy passing between Starling, Lecter, and Krendler as the shots switch from character to character, and in the middle of it all you have sadistically slow shots of Hannibal digging into Paul Krendler's cerebrum and cooking the pieces. The sequence in itself made me squirm numerous times in my chair. It's a beutiful thing when a film can affect you in so many ways.
But don't get me wrong, it wasn't just that little blip that made this film great. The film as a whole is unique in it's fashion. And tread a completely different path than the previous outing. Even Hopkins himself take the role down new avenues. Throughout ""Silence"" Hopkins is confined in a cell for most of the way. Well, as previously stated, HE'S OUT! Hopkins flawlessly managed to show us Lecter's taste, his style, his beaming intelligence, and ultimately his lethal nature. I was charged to watch what would ensue when Clarice and Hannibal would meet face to face, without glass in between. I was not disappointed. All of a sudden the same feelings I had watching those classic scenes from ""Silence"" but then there's the additional sense of Alert and caution because now he could do anything. Hannibal is an unpredictable man so don't bother trying to read him.
Though the most controversial change was Julianne Moore. What controversy? She is one of modern cinema's most solid and professional actresses. Try watching her in ""Magnolia"" and tell me you were not moved in any way. If you weren't then you must be dead. So I knew she'd do the role justice. Fact of the matter is the nature of ""Hannibal"" differs from ""Silence"" Jodie Foster, though as talented as she is would not have fit in with the tone and the pace of ""Hannibal."" I feel that Moore's personality, her look and her acting ability, on the other hand fit like a glove. So I was never afraid of the role being sullied.
Fact of the matter is people need to destroy any expectations, when it comes to going to see a sequel, especially when it's a sequel to one of AFI's top 100 films. But in the End ""Hannibal"" is a film that stands on it's own and doesn't need the hype of it's predecessor to strive.
To sound like a cliche critic. ""It's a thrilling, intense, emotional powerhouse that can't be missed!""",1004486400,4,3829,4.665680473372781
1293527,3,B00003CXSO,"The only reason I watched this video was because it proported to have a different/better ending than the book. What I can say about Hannibal is the it is a well done movie for its genre. To be faithful to the book (which is the weakest of Harris' works) the movie depicts most of the violence and bloodshed, but Ridley Scott's direction spares the audience of most of this - working the scene the way it should be done: giving sufficient hints and gore to communicate what happened without making us watch it happen. Visual effects, blurred slow motion sequences and other techniques make the gore bearable. The exception is the final ""dinner"" scene that, while true to the book, is particularly disturbing and frankly without literary purpose. So there are two things to say about this work - it is spendid to watch, lovely and expertly crafted, but still unable to prop up the lacking story which in the end delivers nothing. Unlike Silence and Red Dragon there is no mystery to solve, no mcguffin, and we end the story with things just about the same. A mostly empty story that's pleasing to watch and with an ending that quenches the bitter after-taste of Harris' version.",1004400000,,1176,4.685990338164252
1293528,5,B00003CXSO,"""It's not thrilling enough.""  ""I hated the ending.""  ""The book was much better.""
Well -- of course!
Hannibal is a five-star movie, precisely for the reasons most people seem to hate it.  Silence of the Lambs was a thriller.  Hannibal is a character study.  So of course it isn't as thrilling.  But what about the pure voyueristic thrill of spending time deep inside the skull of our favorite Good Doctor?  I'll take that over a basement gunfight (ala Silence) any day.
The ending.  Yes, this is controversial.  But the book ending (I won't give away anything here) simply couldn't be done in a movie.  There's just no way for Clarice The Pursuer of the movies to make the same character leap as Clarice The Rescuer of books.  Given that, you simply have to admit the new ending is clever, fun, exiting, and oh-so-appropriate.  Watch it again and tell me you're not squirming, trying to decide who is predator and who is prey and who you want to ""win.""
""The book was better.""  Can't argue there.  Name any movie better than the book.  So why should that complaint count?

1293569,1,B00003CXSO,"One gets the impression that Hollywood just had to cash in on the ""Dr Hannibal Lecter"" aura and hence the forced sequel. It tragic that Ridley Scott had to waste his movie making talent in making this rather tame sequel that relies more on gore than on story telling and a tight screenplay to revive the protagonists.
Dr Lecter is re-born so to say (i.e has come out of hibernation) suddenly as fine arts professor some where in Italy. He is on the FBI's 10 most wanted list of criminals and walks around Italy and indeed in US as if he is taking a stroll in Central Park ! During the course of the movie Dr Lecter manages to leave Italy, return back to the US, and as part of the climax, leave US and presumably return back to Italy without even a smattering of a disguise to hide his identity - which suggests that customs and immigration officials at both Italy and the US airports are brain dead. I mean we are talking about the FBI's 10 most wanted men here - not some petty criminal indicted for drunk driving !!
Ms Clarice Starling too has not progressed to far ahead in life and seems to attract bad luck within her job with FBI just like moths to honey. Rather unnecessarily and just to suit the plot she has to undergo demotion for a botched up job with hardly any chance for Clarice to state her side of the story. And why the hell has she been reassigned on the job to track Lecter - I don't know.
A few sequences in the movie that are essentially gross and do nothing to add to the story line other than pander to the lovers of horror are:
1. Mason Verger's face
2. The pig sequence
3. The climax dinner sequence
4. The rather philosophical exchange of dialogues - so that one gets the impression that one is watching a class act movie or what wud seem like a belated attempt to cover the weak script with unnecessarily tedious and philosophical exchanges.
Other than the gore, the plot seems so loose. Look closely and you will note that there is *ABSOLUTELY NO REASON* to a make this movie other than maybe fool a few people and make a quick buck before the other's catch on. There are so many loopholes and other problems that I can go on and on and on...but am quite bored of typing. No wonder Jodie Foster dropped out of this one !

Ingriediants:
2 Overpaid and Award Winning Screenwriters
1 Ridiculous novel
1 Tyrannical Director
1 Academy Award winning Knight of the British Isles
1 Jodie Foster Substitute
2 Money Hungry Movie Studios
45 Gallons of fake blood
74 lbs of Flesh
Cooking Directions
1. Ask the first overpaid Screenwriter, a brand like David Mamet would be fine, to adapt the ridiculous novel, this is guaranteed to be a failure so you should discard the first overpaid screenwriter but keep some of his ideas as it will provide extra seasoning to the second overpaid and award winning screenwriter. Choose the brand that was used for ""Schindler's List"" I think that brand of screenwriter is sometimes called Steven Zaillian.
2. When the adaption is complete, you, the chef must find a tyrannical yet famous director (he acts a bit like hamburger helper to your overcooked script) to craft your overpaid screenwriter's work. Choose a director that is most likely to do what he's told but not without a fight, OF PARAMOUNT importance choose a director who has a current hit and will likely recieve an Oscar nomination when you decide to serve the ""Sweet Lecters"" to your guests.
3. Bear in mind that many previous guest have enjoyed this same dish 10 years earlier and are dying for a taste again, adding extra violence, more pervsity, and piles more gore is likely to  octuple the number of guests that will come to your party.
4. Now it's time to go and look for your old ingridients that were left over from ten years ago, some of these key players in your recipe will have been featured in some bad recipes and will be dying for a hit, others will want to have nothing to do with your new recipe.  The Jodie Foster will not come back, it has graduated to such fare as Anna and the Overblown King and now considers itself a ""director"". The old director has most likely gone on to better things, the Jonathan Demme will now be making things like remakes of Charade and sequals to proper bad novels like Beloved.
We at Tasty Sweet Bread Cooking suggest looking for a Foster replacement. The Foster replacement should probably be a better actor than the Jodie Foster was and it should have at least two Oscar nods to its name. Getting the Knight should not be a problem so long as you give him control of all the one liners.
5. Once all ingriedients are in place hire all the directors crew from his previous recipe- Gladiator Grains- to fall into the usual place behind the camera. Hire the worst composer you can find to write a musical score that prentends to be serious while making the poor choir  sing itself to death.
6. Once the Lecters look ready to go in the oven add extra flavourings like plot and ending. Throw in as many horrible things as your can like Disembowlment, Face feeding to dogs, Men with the flesh missing from their faces, man eating wild boars, and the most lovely of all a charming feast at the end of your recipe.
7. We are sure that if cooked for a minimum amount of time the dish will taste absoloutly horrible, but give the appearence of looking fresh and new. We gaurantee your guests will want even more but this time they will not want you to wait another 10 years before tasting again.
Final Tip: Remember: Nothing is low enough for the population, see if you can sink even lower into filth and the  people will love you for it!

1293571,5,B00003CXSO,"Ten years after the success of ""Silence of the Lambs,"" psychiatrist, gentleman and cannibal Hannibal Lecter is back. I first saw this movie in a theater, and that's the way it should be seen. A big screen and good speakers are necessary to fully enjoy the greatness of this movie.
The career of director Ridley Scott is full of both highs and lows (""Alien"" and ""Blade Runner"" being two of the highs; ""G.I. Jane and ""Gladiator"" being two of the lows in my opinion), but I would go as far as saying that ""Hannibal"" brings us Ridley Scott at his finest. From the almost poetic camerawork during Lecter's lecture on Dante to the careful use of slow-motion when needed, Scott shows that he is a world-class director.
Still, this movie would be nothing without the second-to-none acting of sir Anthony Hopkins. He really brings the novel's character to life, with all the finesse and charm one would expect from Hannibal Lecter. Julianne Moore is surprisingly good in her role as FBI-agent Clarice Starling. I have to confess I was a bit worried when I first learned that Jodie Foster would not play the role of Starling, but my fears were completely unfounded. Julianne Moore is just as good as - if not better than -  Jodie Foster was.
Other things deserving to be mentioned is the music of Hans Zimmer and the beautiful Italian scenery, both of them huge parts of this movie's appeal. Hannibal - approved.",1003449600,,1402,4.676113360323886
1293572,5,B00003CXSO,"Hannibal Lecter in love; chilling thought.
The movie's ending was much more intriguing than the book's, in that Clarice was allowed to keep her idealism, and Lecter his mystery.  He did not love Starling in the book, he was merely obsessed.  His manipulation of her through the use of drugs and mis-use of his analytical genius only brain-washed her, it did not sway her to actually love him.  He controlled her, but only as a trainer does a dog.
In the movie's ending, the tension is kept open, and his feelings for her are shown to be more than mere lust for control.  He is evil, yes. Exceedingly so.  He is depraved... more than any other single character I can think of (except, perhaps, Mason Verger). But he also respects her and admires her for her courage and incorruptibility.  ""...all you would need for that, Clarice, is a mirror.""  His twisted self-sacrifice reinforces to us (and HER) that she has nothing to fear from him.  ""The world is more interesting with you in it.""  Also, it shows us he'll be back.
Goody-goody!
By allowing Clarice to keep the true core of herself, her incorruptibility, the door is left open for the possible exploration of Lecter's vast mind chambers, and the catalyst that brought him to his current state of depravity.  This sub-plot, exposed in the book, but wisely absent from the film, leaves us with a veritable FEAST of psychological interplay between our favorite anti-hero and his love interest in the future.
Let Hannibal run free.  Let him heal from his wounds.  Let Starling face her doom at the hands of those who ""depise her almost as much as she despises them.""  Let some time pass.  Then, when she least expects it, let Starling come under Lecter's spell...  ""All good things to those who wait.""  I'm sure they can have some ""fuuunnnn"" when they do finally hook up.
SotL, as well as Hannibal, are not so much about the gore and shock and killing as they are about the characters, and the relationships between them.  The biggest chill of Silence was NOT Buffalo Bill, but the slowly building tension between Hannnibal and Clarice, culminating in that split second contact between them when he brushed her finger with his through the bars of his cell.
Ditto, the builing tension in Hannibal... he brushes her hair in the train station while passing by on the carousel, he breaks into her car and sniffs and licks her steering wheel(you MUST see the DVD)... chivalry rules as he sweeps her up and carries her to safety from the pigs... he performs surgery on her shoulder and cares for her medically, he caresses her cheek while looking deep in her eyes at the dinner table... all this leading up to the fateful moment.... the delicious kiss.  Absolutely incredible.  The DVD offers an extended moment of this... him nuzzling her and tasting her with his tongue.  WOW!
If the talked-about sequel explores any of the materal hinted at in the book, watch out!  I think it would be quiet something to know these two in private life.  Wink.",1003363200,2,2991,4.689655172413793

1293576,5,B00003CXSO,"Hannibal can probably be called an art horror film. The settings and shots of ITaly and its beautiful art and history are all over this movie. Director Ridley Scott set out to make Hannibal as different as possible from Silence of the Lambs, so a comparison is not fair. Scott succeeds in capturing the atmosphere and environment of Thomas Harris' novel. Hannibal picks up 10 years after SOTL. Clarice Starling now played by Julianne Moore is a tough cop in the middle of a drug sting in Washington DC. The sting goes bad and suddenly Clarice is in bad odor with her superiors. A world away in Florence, Dr Lecter is living the good life: drinking espressos, taking in all the art history, and working as a museum curator called Dr Fell. Dr Lecter's carefree existence is disturbed by Italian detective Rinaldo Pazzi. Pazzi does not want to bring Dr Lecter to justice, instead he wants to collect the bounty placed on Lecter by his only surviving victim the fabulously wealthy child molester Mason Verger(played brilliantly by Gary Oldman). Dr Lecter easily outsmarts and kills Pazzi and escapes a capture attempt. However, Lecter is moved by Starling's troubles and decides to see her in the US. Following him are Mason's kidnappers, who finally capture Lecter and bring him to Mason. Mason decides to feed Lecter to some wild pigs. The acting in this movie is great, in particular Oldman and Anthony Hopkins. Hopkins is having the time of his life here playing his most famous role. He glides through the movie as the sleek and smooth Dr Lecter. But its Scott's direction which puts this movie over the top. The sights and sounds of this movie are a true delight. The music is glorious and unforgettable. Some of the scenes are so beautifully shot that you don't even care about the dialougue you just look and admire the screen. Hannibal is a new breed of horror movie, very sophisticated, lovingly shot, and beautifully acted.

This faceless man uses an unknowing Agent Starling (now played by Julianne Moore) as a decoy to lure Hannibal out of hiding.

1293648,4,B00003CXSO,"The people who were disappointed by this movie are largely people who wanted it to be ""Silence of the Lambs"" again only different. Those folks never understood that this wasn't the story of an investigation, like ""Silence"" was. This movie was about the love of a talented ""monster"" for a beautiful and also talented woman. Thus, it bears more in common with ""The Phantom of the Opera"" than it does ""Silence of the Lambs."" If the viewing public had kept that in mind, I think there would be generally higher reviews for the movie.
I was disappointed by the movie for a different reason. In the trilogy of novels in which Lecter appears, the theme is always about metamorphosis. In ""Red Dragon"", Francis Dolarhyde is undergoing metamorphis into the Red Dragon. In ""Silence"", Jame Gumb (Buffalo Bill) is attempting the metamorphosis into a woman, by wearing the skins of his victims. In ""Hannibal"", Clarice is the character who transforms. She is the only one of the three to successfully transform into her new self. She does this with Lecter's assistance; he was, after all, a brilliant psychiatrist, whatever else he may have been. Thus, at the end of the novel ""Hannibal"", when Clarice and Lecter eat Krendler's brain and run off to South America together, it is true to what has come before in the two earlier novels. The people who were outraged by that ending were mainly those who think of Clarice Starling and picture Jody Foster. When they read ""Hannibal"" what they really wanted ""Silence of the Lambs""  over again only different.
My disappointment with the movie lies in that by changing the ending, they completely discarded the theme on which the story was built. I still enjoyed the film. Moore was every bit as good as Foster ever was in the Starling role. Ray Liotta was hilarious and slimey as Krendler. I enjoyed watching Hoppkins enjoy himself as Lecter. I was also disappointed that some of the lesser characters were discarded and that the essential hatefulness of the Mason Verger character was kind of glossed over.

I just watched Silence, after watching Hannibal, and the first one just isn't as good. I thought Julianne Moore equaled the performance of Foster, and I don't think the movie was too gory. This movie was not about Buffalo Bill, it was about Hannibal, hence the name. Would you not expect it to be a bit more graphic? He slices, dices and eats people. Why in the world would someone with a weak stomach even think of watching it? The storyline is much more difficult to follow and predict. Excellent suspense. Silence really didn't leave me wondering too much during the movie, but I could not predict what Hannibal was going to throw at me next. It's almost like a well produced Lynch film. Great movie.

However, I did love the story, and I thought it was a good thriller. It wasn't necessarily what I thought it was going to be. When you say a name like Hannibal Lector you think of cannibal, but in my opinion he hardly did any killing, and those he did kill weren't killed in the fashion that I thought Hannibal Lector had become accustomed to.

Hopkins hams his way through the appalling script and Moore's constantly impassive facial expressions suggest that she was slipped an overdose of botox.  The shock-horror elements of the ""story"" are crass in the extreme.  The thrilling suspense of the first film has been replaced by make-'em-barf excess.  One disturbing facet of this film is the sneakily unspoken suggestion that, at the back of it all, we should somehow be cheering Lecter on as he eats the brains of Ray Liotta's boorish character.

The change in cast is most appropriate, actually, since Demme's film had a documentary-like grunge feel to it that Foster fit perfectly (not to say that she's not glamorous), while as here director Ridley Scott has filmed the entire thing as if it were a grand opera, and Moore's classic looks and striking hair colour fit the visual fabric of the film so much better. Other than that, there's not much to it-the plotline is basically finishing off loose ends that the characters didn't wrap up last time, with Starling chasing Hannibal Lecter (the always impressive Anthony Hopkins) across two continents to save him from himself. There's no one to save in the nick of time, there's no driving plotline, nor are there any interesting characters (Giancarlo Giannini's turn as a cop who goes after Lecter in the most ham-fisted of ways is so predictable as to induce yawning when his outcome finally arrives), and so you're left with a film that's all dressed up and no where to go.

We find the same issue here. After creating the BRILLIANT and oft-ignored Red Dragon (which was the basis for Michael Mann's clumsy ""Manhunter"" film), Thomas Harris followed up with an extraordinary book (and, with the help of many others, a delicious movie) called Silence of the Lambs.
As in the case of the Godfather, the Hannibal money machine demanded a third installment of this franchise. The result was a nearly unreadable book that actually broke the old Hollywood paradigm: bad books make good movies (certainly great books rarely make great movies, the Godfather being a notable exception).
""Hannibal"" the movie belongs in the Ed Wood pile of misguided and misused celluloid.

HOWEVER, I did find the movie entertaining enough to order it on DVD.  Julianne Moore did a wonderful job playing Sterling and Anthony Hopkins by far was excellent in the film as well.
Reading most of the reviews online and elsewhere, I see that lots of people termed this movie as a SEQUEL to ""Silence Of The Lambs"" and altho I can understand how and why this would be assumed, I personally don't see it as a sequel at all.  Both movies are totally different from the other so in my opinion, the movies really shouldn't be correlated in the sense where Rocky I, II, and III or Nightmare on Elm Street trilogy would be.

1293747,4,B00003CXSO,"The moment he signed on to film Hannibal, Ridley Scott must have known he would be thrown out of the window and left to dangle like a Pazzi. It was utterly unavoidable that Hannibal would be held up against Jonathan Demme's rendition of Silence of the Lambs, and inevitable it would come off second best. Silence of the Lambs is not just any old potboiler, after all.

So, instead of going head-to-head with Demme in the serial thriller stakes, Scott has done what any sensible director would do - made a different sort of film altogether. In some ways, he didn't have a choice - it's a different sort of book altogether. Inevitable though they may be, comparisons with Silence of the Lambs are pointless - you may as well compare Hannibal with The Remains of the Day - they both star Anthony Hopkins, after all.

Where Demme concentrated on the suspense and narrative, Scott explores Harris' characterisation and the deeper thematic content of Harris' writing. The scenes in Florence especially, dealing with avarice and betrayal and Dante's inferno - all of which manifest themselves in poor Pazzi's undoing - are beautifully shot and constructed. This isn't to say the pulse doesn't quicken from time to time along the way, of course. But this time Hopkins tends to play it for laughs and not chills.

The American half of the film is much less interesting, and departs more radically from Harris' novel. Sure, certain themes are reinforced - Starling repeatedly crosses bridges, (the Rubicon? the Styx?) and the steaming gates and ""sulphurous"" lakes of Mason Verger's estate are certainly equated with Dante's vision of hell from the earlier part of the film - but I think in this section Scott capitulates a little on his mission to avoid the cheap thriller, and inevitably it pales. Julianne Moore plays Clarice Starling in a far more one-dimensional fashion than Jodie Foster did, when, given Scott's ambition, you'd expect quite the reverse. The contrast between Moore's uneasy performance and Hopkins' assured one is marked. The old boy is clearly having a whale of a time.

The ending, which departs completely from Harris' original, seems to me to sell out the film's artistic pretenses in favour of commercial appeal (by the way, the ""alternate ending"" isn't very alternative at all, and is even less like the novel). Granted, the novel's ending wasn't popular, but it was courageous. The film's conclusion is neither, and the cynic in me wonders whether Scott wasn't leaving the way open for a sequel. Not, I should think, that Harris will write one.

So, no fifth star, but a fascinating movie - in parts - all the same.

The movie has three stories in one.  We have a guy who wants to capture Lecter to torture him, an Italian investigator who wants to capture Lecter for a reward, and Clarice Starling, who wants to capture Lecter and has to indure her disgrace in the FBI.

Lecter is relatively ""normal"" in this movie, which I feel makes him all the more terrifying.

When Clarice Starling (Juliannne Moore) learns of this she sets out to warn Lecter. Ridley Scott scores another bullseye after his success with GLADIATOR. His expected visual style complements Hopkins' performance well.  Moore meanwhile, manages to step into the role of Starling and make it her own. My only quibble is that Oldman had his name removed from the credits supposedly because he wanted second billing.

Starling. There was nothing here ( unlike the book ) to
make Jodie Foster shy away from playing Clarice again.

movie makers can reconcile it to the completely botched

1293848,5,B00003CXSO,"I understand why this movie may be a disappointment to those who enjoyed the first two movies in the series.  This movie is far less the typical mystery/horror movie than the other two.  While Hannibal does actually contain some more interesting insights into the operation of the FBI than the other two (its internal politics and sexism) and does illustrate some interesting investigative techniques (e.g., using experts in the perfume industry who can accurately pinpoint the sources of different scents), this movie is more of a psychological exploration.  And although it does have the goriest scenes of the whole series (although they are few and far between), it isn't much of a horror movie until the infamous dinner scene (which made even my iron-cast stomach queasy).  For one thing, it is more of a character study of Hannibal, giving more insight into his character than the other two movies do about their villians, than a mystery.  And it also requires more participation and introspection by the audience and isn't a movie you can just expect to sit back and be thrilled by.  As a result, Hannibal, brilliantly performed by Hopkins, becomes one of the most three-dimensional, multifaceted characters I've seen in the history of cinema, especially for a villian, and the movie also winds up raising questions about our perceptions of ""evil"", etc.
The movie is divided into three basic sections: an introduction, the story of the Italian detective who tries to profit from tracking Hannibal in Florence, and the story of Clarice also pursuing and confronting Hannibal.  The actions of Clarice and the Italian, both of ""poor breeding"",are contrasted to show how, e.g., one rises above her station in life, proving that class is meaningless, while the other allows himself to be sunk into a pit out of his greed.  (The Italian detective is a person who Hannibal would describe as having two low-diving starlings as parents instead of one (Clarice).)  Unfortunately, the ending of the movie is a bit too ambiguous for my taste, but the journey is very worthwhile.  Furthermore, the acting (Julianna Moore is superior to Jody Foster), music, scenery and cinematography is breathtaking (it is, as some jokingly describe it, like Merchant-Ivory's first slasher film).  Its only problem is in finding the right audience (one that is intellectual but loves horror).  A very interesting hybrid of high-brow and low-brow cinema.",1000080000,2,2430,5.124050632911392

1293850,4,B00003CXSO,"The book, ""Hannibal"" is the most depraved, disgusting work I have had the misfortune of reading. I kept thinking as I read it that it could not get worse, but it did. I HATED the book and was not really interested in seeing the film version of it. But I recently watched the magnificant ""Silence of the Lambs"" again and decided to see how a film could possibly have been made of ""Hannibal"". Anthony Hopkins and Jody Foster were so wonderful in ""Silence"" that I could not imagine how another actress could possibly play Clarice and have the same relationship and depth of emotions with Lecter even though she was now 10 years older with a lot more experience.
So with these prejudices, I watched ""Hannibal"". It was a decent film, but very flawed. So much had to be left out and so much was changed. The whole situation with Verger in the book was completely changed. In the book he could not leave his bed because his body had been shriveled and distorted by the hanging he went through during his session with Lecter. The only thing shown in the film was the result of his shaving his face off. The whole family situation with his lesbian sister was gone which was vital to his character. This meant that a whole new method of killing him was necessary. The fact that she killed him to gain the family fortune was gone plus the symbolism of his eel like body being fed to the large eel he kept as a pet. Much of his character was altered for the film. Also his make-up was less than satisfactory. I kept thinking how the make-up for the Phantom of the Opera in the stage musical would have been much for effective for Verger - more horrible and more in keeping with the idea of a face being removed. What is seen in the film is too obviously a mask. Gary Oldman's performance is lessened by this makeup. He is excellent but could have been even more effective in other make-up.
Anthony Hopkins is magnificent as Lecter and is the main reason to watch the film. His performance is multi-layered and always fascinating. He is the finest actor around today and always worth watching. One deleted scene on the DVD where he gets into Clarice's car and licks the steering wheel is chilling and riviting. But each of his scenes is magnetic, he doninates even those scenes when just his voice is heard.
Unfortunately Julianne Moore just does not make it as Clarice. She is, at best, only competant. She is acceptable in the role, but never plumbs the depths of the character. A viewer keeps wondering what the character could have been with Jody Foster. Her ghost dominates each of Clarice's scenes. Even Miss Moore's voice is a pale imitation of Miss Foster's.
One of the things that saves the film from the excesses of the book is that Clarice does not become Lecter's lover and waltz off on the patio with him as Krendler sits babbling at the table with the top of his head off as in the climax of the book. BUT the ending of the film with Lecter sharing the ""lunch"" with the little oriental boy on the plane is even more perverse and really more horrifing than anything else in the film.

No wonder Jodie Foster passed on this movie.  It was a stinker!  There were so many plot holes that it was frustrating to keep up with this movie.
The whole idea that Hannibal Lecter was in love with Clarice Starling was something new to me.  The man is a manipulative person who likes to toy with people.  He has no love for anyone.  Julianne Moore did her best but she seemed to be going through the motions in the elaborate DARK *ss movie.

1293924,4,B00003CXSO,"We have gotten to the point with DVDs where we really need to be able to rating both the film AND the packaging (similar to what we get to do with the THREE rating categories for toys), because whatever you might think about ""Hannibal"" as a film this is an excellent 2-disc DVD package.  Director Ridley Scott's commentary is first rate, although there are more lengthy pauses in the last act of the film (and I cannot get the subtitles to work during the commentary, which is how I prefer to do it).  The best of the extras is probably the bit on the Fish Market shootout that allows you to look simultaneously at the multi-camera angles used to film the scenes.  The ""making of"" featurette is okay, the cast bios above average, and the dozens of discarded examples of posters for the film are fascinating.
I think we are all pretty much in agreement that the shortcomings with the film version of ""Hannibal"" are inherent in Thomas Harris's novel.  The main problem is that when Hannibal is ""out"" he is simply not as powerful a figure.  The potency of the character in ""The Silence of the Lambs"" is that even when he was thrown in a dungeon cell or masked and harnessed to a dolly he was still in psychological control of the situation.  The idea of Hannibal getting Meigs to swallow his tongue was more horrific than what happened to Pazzi or Krendler in this film.  I am sure the ending of the film has to be more satisfying to fans than that of the novel, although I do want to point out that in the book Lecter used drugs and psychological conditioning to reprogram Clarice into not his lover but rather his consort, which is closer to Frankenstein than Pygmalion.
Watching ""Hannibal"" on DVD confirmed the two strengths I found in the film when I first saw it in the theater.  First, screenwriters David Mamet and Steven Zaillian did a marvelous job of concocting scenes between Hannibal and Clarice.  In the novel the two are never together until the very end, while in the screenplay we have Clarice listening to tapes of their previous conversations and talking on the telephone in a couple of interesting situations.  Without these creative additions ""Hannibal"" becomes just like ""Sleepless in Seattle.""  Second, the best performance in the film is turned in by Julianne Moore.  We have no trouble believing this is Clarice Starling ten years down the road.  Of course this is particularly impressive since the actress is following in the footsteps of Jodie Foster's Oscar winning performance.  I even think you can clearly see echoes of Foster's original characterization in Moore's work.  As for Anthony Hopkins, he is certainly presenting a different, more mellow side to Hannibal, which I suppose is justified by the intervening years.  Still, as the ending amply proves, this is not the same old Hannibal Lecter.
Anyhow, whether you have already seen ""Hannibal"" or not, as long as you have seen ""The Silence of the Lambs"" you should check out the DVD version and make up your mind about all these nonsense.  You have to admit the author and the film give you plenty to think about.",999648000,2,3095,4.691312384473198

In ""Silence of the Lambs"" I found Dr. Lector to be more of a monster whom indiscriminately killed his victims. However, the story line was unpredictable and challenging at times. However, in ""Hannibal"" Dr. Lector's own psychology is made clearer, his contempt for the rude and corruptible, and his respect for the incorruptible. I found myself actually liking Dr. Lecter, although still a monster. And the people he killed were rather unpleasant individuals and, surprisingly (shamefully), I found myself not bothered by their demise.

So, do not watch ""Hannibal"" expecting an exact equal to the classic ""The Silence Of The Lambs."" Like the novel, the movie is another PART of the trilogy started by the novel ""Red Dragon"" and Michael Mann film ""Manhunter."" ""Hannibal"" is more of an art film, a dark romance that depends on the atmosphere and dialogue. Director Ridley Scott presents a stylish piece of film that is beautifully photographed in rich textures (the photography is by John Mathieson, who was nominated for an Oscar for ""Gladiator"") in shadows. There are sequences that look like gothic paintings. There is a dreamy quality here. Much is due to the great team working on this movie. There is Scott, who directed ""Gladiator,"" the editor is Pietro Scalia who won an Oscar for Oliver Stone's ""JFK"" and was also nominated for ""Gladiator,"" and the hauntingly romantic music is by Hans Zimmer, composer of the ""Gladiator"" score as well. This movie is for people who like perverse horror mingled with artistic taste. ""The Silence Of The Lambs"" was more about the psychological, gritty aspects of the story, ""Hannibal"" is about the theatrics. Anthony Hopkins is great as in the first movie, he is charming and engaging. We don't miss Jodie Foster at all and Julianne Moore perfectly captures the character which is a tougher, rougher Clarice Starling made hard as a rock by 10 years of FBI work. The writers of the screenplay, David Mamet (The Edge) and Steven Zaillian (Schindler's List), do a neat job of capturing the atmosphere of the book. ""Hannibal"" is a dark romance, a more perverse version of Beauty & The Beast. I am disappointed that the ending of the book was left out, nope, Clarice and Hannibal do not run off together. I loved the novel's ending because the author, Thomas Harris, went for broke. What is true horror but the unexpected and unthinkable? I don't understand how Ridley Scott is willing to film the top of a man's head cut off, revealing a red brain underneath, bowels spewing onto the floor, but left out the original ending. I suspect it's because there is a sequel in order. Still, ""Hannibal"" is a gothic, atmospheric movie. It is not the classic that ""The Silence Of The Lambs"" is, but it is an original, artistic thriller. A certain, unique taste is needed to enjoy this one.

1294021,3,B00003CXSO,"The long awaited sequel to ""Silence of the Lambs"" not only manages not to live up to the first film but it doesn't even live up to the book which although good was very flawed, namely in the ending.
Ridley Scott has taken the continuing saga of Dr. Hannibal Lector and has unfortunately made it rather slick and over the top. What ""Silence of the Lambs"" had that made it great Scott has taken away for this film in an attempt to make it his own but has fuddled it up in the process.
This film catches up with Hannibal Lector and Clarice Starling some ten years after their last encounter and since then the good doctor has been quite busy. He now lives in Florence as a respected historian and is getting on with things. The film revolves around Starling's and a former victim named Mason Verger's attempts to catch him.
Let's look at the flaws of this film. For starters although Julianne Moore is a great actress she is no Jodie Foster and fails to provide the strength yet insecure vulnerability needed for the character to work that Jodie Foster did. I know the character is supposed to be older and stronger but this makes us less interested in the character and what happens to her. Starling still had the vulnerability needed to make us care about her in the book of ""Hannibal"" but she fails to have it here. Moore and the character are rather boring to watch and I never really cared about Starling because of it. Second, the film relies far too much on shock gore to keep its audience interested. The disembowelment in Italy and the feast at the end shock you during viewing but do not have the lasting chill that the tension from ""Silence of the Lambs"" provides. The violence is very strong in this film and for those who are easily disgusted: be warned. Third, Anthony Hopkins could never have lived up to his performance in ""Silence"" and does not. Lector is too slick, too playful and comes off as almost cartoonish at points. A lot of this comes from the fact that the film focuses on him and also because he is not behind bars. Free, walking around, talking to people Hannibal is not nearly as frightening as locked up, don't-touch-the-glass Hannibal.
In comparison to the book I would say that the strong parts of the book are weak in the film and that the weak parts of the book are stronger in the film. The best parts of the book are when Lector is in Florence and Merger's men are after him along with the Italian cop. This part is exciting and suspenseful and well crafted but in the movie they seem rushed and unimportant. I would say that Scott rushed everything especially the part when Lector returns to America. It was so rushed it was hard to tell what was going on. One minute he is in Italy and the next he is being chased around a mall in the U.S.A. Although not great, the end in the movie is an improvement over the end in the book. It is still to strange and not at all true to the characters or the story or just the plain feel of the film.
A disappointment but still interesting to watch and by no means awful. Just flawed.

Julianne Moore is no Jodie Foster, who would've been nice to have aboard, but she is quite adequate. She is very good. She has the right look and charm to her to make it work and to have people not miss Jodie Foster too terribly. Giancarlo Gianinni was also good. He had a strong presence that was a great addition to the film. Gary Oldman was good as usual. The final 20 minutes were surprising indeed. I was shocked at how Lecter went about as if it were a normal everyday thing. It was unsettling to the max!. The confrontation in the kitchen between Lecter and Clarice was rather good. Not as intense as the original, but still a good scene. I was only disappointed by Ray Liotta. He wasn't given enough to do. It seems he was just added just so there was another bad guy oon Lecter's list. Anyways, this was a fine film. It's not really eerie or suspenseful like Silence was,but that's okay.

I'd heard Demme passed on this project, but
I couldn't figure out why (Hopkins? Moore?) until I saw the Hannibal

to form he picks the most successful mediocrity of his generation to
direct, and here we are.
This movie is tediously predictable, void
of any sense of character (beyond Hopkins, who seems to be having
fun). It goes like this: Julianne Moore is persecuted; Ray Liotta is
her evil boss; Hopkins is Evil and Charming; Act II is set in Florence
with an Italian policeman. <YAWN> In other words a typical Scott
production. I wish he would stop making movies and take up macrame or
something.

""making of"" nonsense) that is even more contrived than the
movie: lot's of ass-kissing PR with Make-Up and SPFX guys who just
loved working with Ridley ""because he's so visual""; Dino (De
Laurentis, not the dog from ""Flintstones"") and
Grand-daughter doing their spin. It isn't documentation, it's just a
press-package -- as fake and worthless as the movie itself.

scenes"": sure enough, anything resembling character was
deleated. Ridley, clearly suffering from ADS, clipped them all to

Anthony Hopkins plays Hannibal Lechter to scary perfection. He is a refined, well educated, verbose, psychopath. Those who are suspect of the film because of the absence of Jodie Foster should read the title of the film, Hannibal. The great majority of Hannibal focuses on the title character and not Federal Agent Starling. Julianne Moore is servicable but is really a periphery character.

Sure I can carp about the slight lapses in suspense (moreso when we leave the Italy sequences behind), the ending (not the ""dinner"" scene, but after that), and to some degree, the charcterization of certain characters. The thing is though, I still get wrapped up in the sick absurbity of it all. Visually, this film is just stunning (especially during the time in Italy), the music is quite beautiful (such as in the opera sequence), and even chilling in some places, like an eerie flashback involving Verger and his reason for wanting Hannibal Lecter dead (and to The Blue Danube, no less). Is it a good movie? The answer depends on what you expect from ""Hannibal"". If you expect a straight forward thriller, at least you have a copy of ""Silence of the Lambs"", right?

The movie stars out with an impressive market shoot-out, in which Clarice gets one of her fellow officers killed and shoots a woman holding a baby. After that she is reassigned to the Hannibal case because he has started killing/eating people again. Although the market shoot-out was very cool, the rest of the movie is boring and pointless. Anthony Hopkins isn't half as scary as he was in the original and Julianne Moore is horrible in Jodie Foster's role. Most of the Hannibal attacks are in the last 45 minutes of the movie and you have to wait until the last 30 minutes or so of the movie until Clarice and Hannibal actually meet. Yes, it's that boring. Up until that last 45 minutes, the movie is an seemingly endless blend of Hannibal sipping wine in Florence and Clarice in her basement, reading Hannibal's notes, watching Hannibal videos and listening to Hannibal audio tapes. Mixed in with that is an old geezer on a wheelchair that keeps talking about how he survived when he cut off his own face when Hannibal told him to. There is practically no suspense. It is replaced with (not needed) gore. The special features were okay, but not what I expected. Some of the deleted scenes are good and the featurettes are somewhat interesting, but the other stuff makes you think, ""Who actually cares about watching different camera angles of a scene?"" That feature is totally useless and boring, (all you see is footage of four different cameras showing people talking) as is the other vignettes. The audio commentary by Ridley Scott is good as usual. Also, some of the deleted scenes should have been in the movie. For example, there is a deleted scene where Clarice explores the dark and abandoned mental hospital. (Where Lecter was in the first film) The scene provides some pretty creepy things, but no. Anything that would be actually scary shouldn't be in the movie, according to the editors. I give this movie two stars because at some points it's interesting. For example, when Clarice talks with Barney (the old security guard at the mental hospital from the original film) it is interesting and it's fun to watch things that the first one hinted about. For example, in the first one, the head of the mental hospital shows Clarice a picture of what Lecter did to a nurse when they removed his restraints because he complained of stomach pain. You don't see the picture. In this film, you see the act. Anyway, this film is passable as a sequel, but I was disappointed. This movie cleary didn't take advantage of its possible potential. All in all: The Silence of the Lambs is MUCH better. That is a movie worth owning. I recommend you rent Hannibal before you see it.

Anthony Hopkins is good as ""Hannibal"" again. This time we get more insight into what type of man he is. This movie is both thrilling and amusing.
My only worry is that some could see this movie as the glorification of a serial killer.

1294117,5,B00003CXSO,"HANNIBAL is an amazing film. This is an incredible film. What initially seems like a grotesque homage or even satire to the horror/slasher genre is far from that. There also is no clearly defined narrative flow to this film. It meanders in and out of dark and light places. And the fact that there is an obvious stylistic approach to many of the scenes is a bit unsettling. But that is what is at the heart of this film. It is disturbing to watch. The viewer never knows when or what or if anything is going to jump out at them. On the second and third viewing of HANNIBAL, I began to enjoying watching how the film unfolded. I think director Ridley Scott really avoids the shock value, or actually the suspense value of the story. Yes, there is a definite shock value during the finale of this film, but it is an emotional toying with the viewer. Ray Liotta certainly gets his comeuppance, Anthony Hopkins' Hannibal is certainly a very sick and grotesque individual and Julian Moore's Clarice is reduced to a curious bystander at this last supper of sorts. But, what does the viewer feel? Does the viewer have feelings of loyalty and to whom? We have already seen how Gary Oldman was a rather unscrupulous disfigured individual who may have been an even worse an excuse for a human being than Hannibal. Who was the viewer rooting for during that scene as pigs were about to much away at ole Hannibal? And then we go back to Giancarlo Giannini. He was barely a corrupt policeman. He just wanted to make a little money on the side. I think with his demise the viewer has his sympathies. But it is at that point that the viewer begins to question the higher order of right and wrong. If anything, HANNIBAL is certainly thought provoking. I think we sort of wanted to see him escape to freedom and provide us with some culinary delights for the next time.",998956800,,1852,4.482248520710059
1294118,5,B00003CXSO,"I have read some of the reviews for this film, now I feel obligated to write my own review. I am sorry SOTL enthusiasts, JULIANNE MOORE DOES JUST AS GOOD IF NOT BETTER JOB OF CLARICE STARLING THAN JODIE FOSTER! Julianne is not the same person Jodie was, she admits in this film that she thinks about hannibal atleast a half minute every day, Hannibal is WITH her all the time, she is never going to be the same. First we have to accept that clarice is now OLDER and she is in the middle of a scandal and is under a lot of public and private pressure at work. Her american innocence being plunged into darkness is over, she has been through bill and has met and interviewed hannibal. This movie goes deeper into Lector's character, fortunately, he still has all the witty genius of SOTL. Hannibal's interest in Clarice has been VERY kicked and beaten by SOTL enthusiasts. There is a deleted scene in SOTL where hannibal goes into clarices car during her infamous run and starts a sort of closeup with the steering wheel (her hands...). Hannibal in my opinion, has feelings for Clarice beyond just intrigue, but being the gentleman he is, never crosses boundaries. WE TRULY get to see Hannibals relationship with Clarice in its full form, the scene where he rescues her in this sort of classic knight in shining armor way is VERY telling. This movie is filled with various wonderful characters and some very ""sick"" violent scenes, but those are definitely all part of the story and are somewhat necessary. Frankly, its a classic, sorry, but I can no longer imagine SOTL without hannibal close by.",998956800,,1594,4.616197183098592

Julianne Moore didn't hold a candle to Jodie Foster in the role of Agent Starling. I was dissapointed with the fact that Jack Crawford had no part in the movie at all. I didn't care for the way this movie jumped back and forth leaving you to assume what happened,for example, Hannibal is in Florence and then poof, he's in D.C. It was too unbelievable that the F.B.I.,and all it's resources couldn't catch the charming doctor, but Carlo and the boys snatched him up in a matter of hours. I have watched this movie 3 times making sure I didn't miss something,and have been insulted more everytime I watched it!

1294217,3,B00003CXSO,"Three directors have now taken their at-bats with Thomas Harris's Hannibal Lecter story-cluster, and only one really hit it out of the park. Michael Mann made Manhunter, a very Michael Mann film in his Miami-Vice period-aesthetic--in other words, instantly dated and slightly ridiculous. Then Jonathan Demme, with the great help of a really sound screenplay by Ted Talley and a very inspired production team and cast, turned The Silence of the Lambs into an enduring film classic. Now Ridley Scott has taken his swings--why did he whiff? The answer, to me at least, is simple--he didn't understand what Demme and company did. The opening sequences of Hannibal reveal the directorial mistakes. First the titles appear to appropriate a number of David Fincher's postmodern stylistic moves without understanding how they were appropriate to material like Se7en and Fight Club, but not to the operatic Hannibal that Harris wrote. We can probably forgive him that, since Fincher's ""collage"" approach and various forms of ramped-up cinematography always looks swell. Then we get a big shoot-out with cars crashing and the whole Hollywood ""action"" apparatus, and the mistake is apparent. Demme opened Silence with a titles sequence over Clarice Starling running through the woods--cueing audience expectation to terror, that she was being pursued, only to revise our expectations in revealing that Starling was running an obstacle course--training--and that the real scene was in Jack Crawford's office. There, the stylistic motif of the film, closeups and shot/reverse-shot editing, established the basic dynamic of the story--internal processing, mental activity, dialogue. This would be reflected in the numerous scenes with Lecter and Starling. The parallel motif of messing with our expectations for action that turns out to be training is also repeated several times. The film works to create in us a sense of our own mistakes, leaves us often in the predicament Starling is constantly dealing with--how to know how to proceed, what to do, in a highly complicated and ambiguous mental environment. Ridley Scott doesn't seem to get any of that. Admittedly, Harris's novel doesn't give him the same great material that Demme got form the earlier book; the thing I noticed most was that Starling and Lecter are separate for most of the film, and aren't even the dominant characters. Hannibal is dispersed in character, with Mason Verger, the Italian detective, Paul Krendler, and others getting screen time that doesn't seem organized (recall how structurally tight Silence was, with all its doublings--two serial killers, two doctors, two mentor-figures competing over Starling--and for all that, clearly the story of Hannibal and Clarice). More than anything, we can see the problems of this film by looking at the work of Anthony Hopkins. An actor of great instincts, Hopkins seems to realize that the material here is ridiculous (he's become a slasher, instead of a mind-mangler), and so he rushes briskly through his scenes (what else can you do when you are sauteeing a man's brains before his very eyes?). There's no savoring of speeches as in Silence. Hopkins seems to know better than to linger over the pedestrian screenplay. Julianne Moore, for her part, is wasted in this role--an intelligent, insightful actress, she could easily have carried the same kind of load that Jodi Foster did in Silence, wholes scenes depending on nothing more than a subtle facial expression, but Moore doesn't get the chance. Not to worry, though, since we can be sure P. T. Anderson will write her another superior part in his next film. This isn't a terrible film, but it doesn't even come close to living up to its potential, let alone the expectations of the ""sequel"" to The Silence of the Lambs, and the blame seems to lie with director Scott and the screenwriters--what exactly did David Mamet contribute, by the way? After watching this, I recommend you go back and look at Silence again, and understand how a great film results from nuanced directorial decisions, outstanding scripting and cinematography, and inspired acting...",998870400,9,4124,5.231117824773414

The Genre: Horror/Drama/Romance/Sequel The Plot: Ten years after the prison breakage of Dr. Hannibal Lecter, Lecter is now walking the streets of Italy freely under the name of Dr. Fell. When Clarice Starling receives a letter from him, she begins tracking him down. But an Italian Inspector Pazzi has already discovered Lecter's hideout, and disgusted face Mason Verger wants his revenge upon the doc. The silence has now been broken. What Works: An edgy suspenseful story line with great performances from ANTHONY HOPKINS, RAY LIOTTA, and questionably GARY OLDMAN. The ending is absolutely unforgettable! Ridley Scott's crafting and weave of suspense and almost unbelievable romance works nicely. What Doesn't: The strongest and most sickening gore you've ever seen to bring a new light to the Dr. Lecter story, showing you something you've never seen before. Also, Julianne Moore's replacing of Jodie Foster as Clarice, which tears down the film's credibility. Reality Check: ANTHONY HOPKINS still has that spine tingling charge in him, which makes him still the scariest actor ever, and brings Lecter to new heights. And while, the romance is somewhat believable, it just doesn't make sense to me in my mind in the type of film it is. The Catch: Children will have nightmares for months if they see this film. And for those of you who are sensitive to gore, you may need to bring a crate full of vomit bags, because the end will make you gag to death!

1294223,4,B00003CXSO,"After viewing 'Hannibal' at my local Loew's in February, I thought it would be a worthy purchase on DVD in August. I am a fan of Sir Anthony Hopkins, especially his portrayal of the deranged Hannibal Lecter, M.D. I was really hoping for more of a psychological movie, with a lot more interaction between Lecter and Starling. Their interaction is what made 'The Silence Of The Lambs' such a creepy movie. This movie, however, keeps Starling and Lecter apart for a good 2/3 of the movie, and their time together is not quite at all like in 'Silence'. It seemed that a few scenes were for mere shock value and not for the good of the film. Sure, I enjoyed Lecter's ""bowels in, or bowels out?"" but it wasn't completely necessary, and neither was the wild boar scene. The ending, however, was priceless, and made the movie. It seems like maybe the doc has feelings afterall? The deleted scenes and pictures are pretty cool. I really don't know why Ridley Scott cut some of those, some would've helped create suspense I thought, like the visit to the Baltimore institution. The letter sequence, I thought, was also better on the alternate one, it explained what did happen to Jack Crawford. The movie did entertain me though, I do wish there were more ties to 'Silence Of The Lambs' and a little bit more psychological interaction between Lecter and the other characters, but I guess it's hard to top 'Silence' (it did win 5 Academy Awards in 1991).",998784000,4,1443,4.640625
1294224,2,B00003CXSO,"I was not surprised to hear that ""Hannibal,"" Thomas Harris' stylish sequel to ""The Silence Of The Lambs,"" was going to be made into a movie. Nor was I surprised that the movie, in typical Hollywood fashion, went for the gore rather than character development. Ridley Scott's direction veers between European film noir and slasher flick with touches of MTV--as in many of his other films, including ""Gladiator"" and ""G.I. Jane,"" he loves those slow but sharp action shots. Anthony Hopkins, reprising his role as cultured killer Hannibal Lecter, does the best with what he's given, as does Julianne Moore, who plays Clarice Starling with grim determination. Gary Oldman (who, despite Amazon's claim, is listed third in the end credits on the VHS version) turns in his usual creepy performance as Mason Verger, Lecter's only surviving victim, bent on revenge. Giancarlo Gianni looks rather bored in his role as the Florence police inspector who discovers Lecter in his new life as a medieval archivist. As is often the case with books turned into movies, a lot of the background information that makes characters interesting is tossed over the side, but Scott makes sure to keep the blood, although (believe it or not) a lot of the gore is toned down compared to the book, the final dinner party especially. ""Hannibal"" the novel is a fascinating character study. ""Hannibal"" the movie turns the good doctor into a pop icon on the level of Freddy Krueger and Jason Voorhees (and also, of course, leaves an opening for a sequel).

1294225,4,B00003CXSO,"One has to wonder how well an ambitious sequel project such as Hannibal would have stood on its own had not a cinematic master such as Ridley Scott been involved.
What gave Silence of the Lambs its impact was not so much the horrific elements of serial killer psychology as the curious relationship between genius madman Hannibal Lecter and FBI agent Clarice Starling, bringing to light her role as the crusader, the protector of order, motivated by personal redemption. In this outing, the attention shifts more to Lecter, as well as the others who are out to get him, and looks more deeply behind some of the more warped motivations people have for justice. To the ""evil"" Hannibal, it is simply a matter of dealing with people who have no class, whose basic rudeness is way out of line, the rationale being they are put to better use as hors deuvres. To the unfortunate others (Gianini, Liotta, and Oldman in one of his most deliciously repulsive roles) who have the poor judgement to go after our Cannibalistic Crusader, it seems to be more about financial betterment, inflation of image, and good old petty vengeance. None of which can be considered as overly admirable human qualities. Needless to say, none of these fools have any idea what or who they are dealing with, and (without giving too much away, as if you couldn't figure it out anyway) are ultimately dealt with accordingly. With fine wine.
Way beyond the level of evil madman, Hannibal is more like the boogeyman who will get you if you're not good .... or even if you don't behave respectably. This is what ultimately saves Clarice: despite her determination to bring him to justice, Hannibal always seems to recognize in her a basic respect, pure and selfless, and (also without spoiling the story) in his own way acts as the protective surrogate dad, an element touched on in ""Silence"" and developed on here.  This of course does not prevent him from messing with her head just a bit, to demonstrate what he is truly capable of as a psychotic of genius proportions, in a grisly final scene that has been criticized for its low denominator shock value.  I myself found it to be quite cerebral.
Director Scott displays his trademark expertise in creating an elegantly dark mood throughout, a sense of dread that keeps one watching and enjoying the ride. Julianne Moore portrays agent Starling with every bit as much conviction as predecessor Jodie Foster (they could almost be sisters), bringing into the role as much as this story would allow. Hannibal's other less-fortunate pursuers are, in their own ways, more vile than he, and it is a bit of warped fun watching them get set up for their fates in elaborate scenarios that (sorry, I can't help it) won't leave you hanging, won't boar you, and may open one's mind. And the generous serving of extras on this double DVD make it a great addition to anyone's library ..... like getting the main course, seconds, and dessert all on one plate!
Hannibal may not have made the Cultural Phenomenal splash that ""Silence"" did, but it has all the markings of an enduring cult classic, and further elevates Hopkins' Dr. Lecter to a dark icon for our generation. Just be sure to give yourself a couple of hours before or after mealtime before attempting to digest this (at times) unsavory course.

But most of all, shame on Thomas Harris and anyone who bought into the incredibly cynical hack job of a sequel that ""Hannibal"" is. As with the book (it isn't anywhere good enough to be called a ""novel""), there seem to be people so credulous as to think that because Harris took ever-so-long to produce this mess, and because he essentially provides a stinging slap in the face to both those who expected a more ""standard"" (read ""predictable"") sequel and those who have higher expectations from an author who has proven that he *can* write well this MUST be good stuff. Well, it simply is NOT. The good news about the movie is that we are spared the grotesqueries of the steroid-buffed lesbian bodyguard and pet eel, the endless ruminations on carbon-steel knives, and the incongrouous flashbacks of Hannibal's sad childhood. What we DO get is Anthony Hopkins mugging shamelessly and chewing all scenery in sight in the most exhibitionist performance I've seen since Laurence Olivier's intentionally ham-bone theatrics in ""Sleuth"". Once upon a time, Lecter was supposed to be a doctor of near super-human intelligence, immensely resourceful and yet with the ability to charm, even seduce, the unwary. Here, he is more or less a stock ""slasher"" character, spouting ""okey dokey"" like a lame tag line a la Freddy Kreuger. Not a flicker of intelligence. It's a good thing his advesaries are even more moronic - everyone stands still while Hopkins bumps them off. Jullianne Moore's Starling is passable, but it is a credit to Jodie Foster's intelligence and integrity that she gave a pass to this slop. The ending. Well, it was a given that the book's ending wouldn't DO in Hollywood (not that it was any good, mind you), but it was *Lecter's* brain that must have fallen out, since he leaves Starling every device needed to secure her freedom and summon assistance. A 5-year-old could do as well. In short, the most obvious ""make a buck"" flick of the decade (""Phantom Menace"" aside - that's a whole category unto itself....). I've seen better movies on MST3K.

The compromises and interaction that Clarice had to make in that movie by working w/Lecther in order to save Buffalo Bill's final victim kept you at the edge of your seat.

Jodie Foster WAS Clarice Starling, and the best part of the first film was her on-screen chemistry with Hopkins' Lecter. Moore's characterization of Clarice, hardened and bitter after 10 years with the FBI, was well-executed, but again, had it been a great part, Foster would have taken it. The violence in the movie is muted but gratuitous; it's as if the makers had to find the most disgusting way to portray Lecter's cannabilism.

Scott is a master of atmosphere and here he creates a great, foggy, dark, scary atmosphere that the story needs. Yes the story is rather baroque and preposterous but what images of horror! The previous two films can't touch the attention to detail, the dark atmospheres, so many bravura scenes, and gore. Anthony Hopkins tops himself again as Lecter, if that is possible. Julianne Moore is good as Agent Starling, never inferior to Jody Foster-Miss Moore makes the character her own. Gary Oldman is horrifyingly effective as the rich, twisted Mason Verger. A few characters from the novel were left out but not missed. The trappings of Lecter from Italy to the United States are bloody and clever and exciting. The ending. My God the ending-one of the most horrifying, funny, over the top torchers in movie history. Ridley Scott directs it all with great artistry.

1294369,1,B00003CXSO,"I had no idea what to expect from ""Hannibal"" except, like all other sequels, it couldn't compare to it's predecessor. Lambs was a very suspenseful and psychological thriller. I was not in suspense at all in this film, and the gore was so totally awful!!! I normally can stomach gore, when I expect it. But I didn't even think that Lambs' was that gory. Lambs had an appeal of it's own with the tension between the characters, and the amazing acting. It was an excellent movie that will always remain a classic. Hannibal, however, is so gory. I just finished watching it, and am so repulsed. THis was not expected at all, maybe I should've read the reviews here first as alot of people sent out warnings of the extreme gore in this movie. Aside from the gore, I was very disappointed with this movie. The changing of actresses was just wrong, if Jodie Foster didn't want to do it(and i can see why now), this movie should have never been made! I do like Julianne Moore as an actress, and I thought she did a fine job in taking over the role of Clarice Starling. Anthony Hopkins is great in this movie, it's appropriately titled as this movie is all about Hannibal. Not Hannibal and Clarice, just Hannibal. IT focuses more on his running than the chase that ensues once Clarice, the Italian policeman, and Mason Verger appear. Mason Verger...one of the oddest characters on film! HE is almost as sick and twisted as Hannibal, but at least Hannibal is nicer to look at. Mason had been ""attacked"" by Hannibal and is the only survivor of Lecter's. I never realized that it was Gary Oldman playing him til the end credits...GARY OLDMAN, he is a great actor, but where is the ability to change character types? He is so stereotyped now. THis is definitely his most outrageous! and the makeup job is so amazingly gross!!! this is a very gross movie. I never found this movie scary or suspenseful. It had a few laughs, and some great acting.-- Hopkins and Oldman. They should have left Ray Liotta out, as he is and always will be one of the worst actors in the history of film. Then we wouldn't have to witness that most disturbing scene in the film. It really made me hate this movie as the gore here does not do anything to help the story in my opinion. I wouldn't recommend this movie. I think it is one of the worst of the year 2001 if not of all time. If you are a big fan of gore, maybe you'll like it for that one reason because this movie has nothing else going for it.",998611200,4,2468,4.390829694323144
1294370,5,B00003CXSO,"I was gripped by the book when I first read it. Unfortunately, I missed the theatrical release of the movie, so I eagerly anticipated the DVD release to see Ridley Scott's realization of the novel. I was not disappointed, since the atmostphere, characterization, acting was first rate and followed closely the book. My only disappointment was that Scott changed the ending. The bottom line is.. if you don't like the book, you won't like the movie. If you love the book, I think you'll love the movie. The 2-disc DVD is outstanding. The special features, deleted scenes, and other features make this one of the best DVDs I have purchased to date. I would have loved to see an extended branching version of the movie with the deleted scenes inserted, but I guess you can't have it all. Who knows - they might do that for a future release of the movie. The audio (DTS 5.1, and Dolby Digital 5.1) is first rate, with a fully enveloping surround sound experience.

This movie was great as far as suspense (the characters trying to keep one step ahead of a madman that is one step ahead of them). The ending disturbed me. It got to a point that I couldn't watch, I was so grossed out. At any rate, Anthony Hopkins is spectacular (of course). I didn't think Julianne Moore was too bad. Ray Liotta played, very well, the guy you love to hate. In general it's not a bad movie, but I don't think a sequel is really a sequel if the same leading actors aren't used for the main characters, Jodie Foster reallly should have came back as Clarice.",998611200,,636,4.221311475409836
1294372,3,B00003CXSO,"I never expect a movie to live up to the novel that inspired it, so the fact that ""Silence Of The Lambs"" actually achieved this was remarkable. So it was inevitable that Hannibal would not live up to this standard, so instead I'll try to concentrate on Hannibal on its own terms. Hopkins is once again excellent as Hannibal, and Moore does a credible job in the unenviable task of filling Jodie Foster's shoes. She doesn't show the charm and vulnerability that Foster displayed in ""Lambs"", but she's playing a hardened FBI agent with 10 years of experience rather than a raw, young recruit. The other characters are one dimensional, but they were in the novel as well. I seem to be one of the few who actually found the ending of the novel satisfying. Hannibal is a horror story, and the ending of the novel is the most horrifying scenario imaginable. I understand why Hollywood rejected it, as it required far more character development of both Starling and Hannibal than a two hour movie could possibly provide. Even so, the movie ending would have benefited from some of the deleted scenes to make it more credible. But in its own way I thought the movie ending worked. I miss several of the characters from the novel (Mason's sister, Starling's roommate, her FBI mentor Jack Crawford) and the demotion of Barnie to a bit role, but understand the necessity of narrowing the focus. But the biggest problem with the movie is that it fails where the novel succeeds in making Mason the pure evil character and Hannibal the sympathetic (if still monsterous) character. The movie shows Mason motivated purely by revenge and only briefly touches on his child abuse. The movie follows the book's dialog where Mason says he has reformed and found religion, but does not then go on to show that even now he is far more cruel and brutal than Hannibal. Since I have read the novel I can't say how this movie works on its own terms. As a novelization of a book I really enjoyed, I give it three+ stars.",998611200,,1992,4.614084507042254

I have to say that I enjoyed watching a superb actor like Anthony Hopkins replaying this role. Hannibal Lecter represents who we think about when we are thinking of a genious, derranged serial killer. Julianne Moore is a beautiful actress and I think she did a good job playing Clarice, yet we will always wonder, How much better could Jodie Foster have been?. I know that there is a lot of controversy about the kilings and the gore in this movie, but having read the book prior to seeing the movie; I expected nothing less. The part of this movie that I was dissapointed with was the end. In my opinion, the end in the book is a more fitting end. It would have brought a better closing to the relationship between Lecter and Starling, and in my view, an even scarier possibility... You don't know the end in the book?...

Much of the hype and complaints I heard about Ridley Scott's version of Hannibal was that he changed the infamous ending that was in the novel. The DVD promises an ""alternate ending"" that I hoped was closer to the novel. In reality it is almost exactly the same as the one in the theatrical release with one change. If you are planning to buy this DVD because of the alternate ending... DON'T BOTHER!!!

1294377,5,B00003CXSO,"I read the book, then saw the film in the theatre and was vaguely aware of not having a real opinion. Did I like it? Yeah...no...yeah I THINK so. Hmmm, I am not usually so confused about cinema. Now, after viewing the DVD, I understand my problem. I was reluctant to allow ""Hannibal"" to be appreciated as a stand alone film and, in my opinion, that is how it must be considered. It sheds new light on this chapter (and the inner character) in the life of our favorite cannibal. Scott's film plays like the foreign film it should be, the screen is both dark and deeply shadowed as well as bleeding with vibrant color, locations spectacular. The photography truly wraps around the actors and brings them in to a secret little world that, while it did not allow me to forget Jodie Foster and her perverse would-be paramour, did allow me to accept the first film as ""another time, another place."" In the here and now with Lechter abroad and Starling's career on the skids after a disasterous FBI raid gone wrong, a fresh start emerges playing once again on Starling's lack of self esteem and the undeniable relationship between the two. To go further with the plot is a waste of your time, Gentle Reader, as so many have already gone before me. I will say the DVD is probably the best one on the market right now, packed full with extra scenes, alternative endings, and plenty of features which allow you to ruminate over the story without the screaming crowds. It personifies what DVD is actually for and why it's worth having. If you turned your nose up at ""Hannibal"" due to loyalty to the first film, may I suggest a taste test? This is very, very good.",998524800,2,1652,4.4916943521594686

1294496,1,B00003CXSO,"""The Silence of the Lambs"" remains one of my very favorite movies of all time.  When I was in graduate school, I wrote my thesis on the way that the film offers not only a brilliant thriller, but also an exploration of human transformation and the myths hidden within ""The American Dream.""
When ""Hannibal"" was published, I rushed out to get it to see what Thomas Harris had concocted for us.  I approached the novel with caution; the very title seemed weak and without even a hint as to what the story might really be about at its core.  Unfortunately, my suspicions were confirmed: while the novel's scenes in Italy were reasonably exciting (if pointless), the film's denoument was an absolute betrayal of everything that we knew about these characters as believeable human beings.  Yes, Harris has the right to do what he wants, but the climax seems to me an attack on everyone who loved ""Silence"" (and ""Red Dragon""/""Manhunter""): I can sense Mr. Harris at his computer, muttering ""So you like these people that much, huh?  Well, take THIS!  Hmph...idiots.""
The film's choice to alter the ending is a good one...but it doesn't change the fact that this film is a pretentious and disgusting bore.  Ridley Scott creates a beautiful atmosphere in some scenes (particularly in its Italy section, like the novel) but the bottom line is that there is simply no story here.  Starling has been reduced to a caricature of feminine defensiveness (and the circumstances which cause her to fall out of favor with the FBI are purely plot-driven and with no hint of reality), while Lecter himself has become a parody of menace -- a Freddy Krueger for the art-house set.  The merry-go-round scene is my favorite -- what would Lecter have done if Starling had turned a half-step and seen him just as he reached out to touch her hair?  ""Er, ah...hello, ah, Clariiiiice.""
Mired in its own lack of plot (not to mention lack of people we care about), the film sinks in its own gratuitous arrogance.  And to make things worse, the film thinks that it is on par with ""Silence"" -- you can feel it desperately clinging to its delusions of adequacy in every frame, while it has none of the class, intelligence, metaphor, and grace which that film carried with it every step of the way.  The film's approach to its violence is also abhorrent: while Silence"" knew that what is unseen will always be more frightening than what is seen, ""Hannibal"" spills its guts (literally; sorry, I had to say it) all over the screen like a grade-Z freak show.  The only performer to escape unscathed is Giancarlo Giannini -- now if the story had focused on just him and Lecter, that might have been something.
""Hannibal"" is one of the worst movies I have ever seen, even worse than those 80's slasher flicks I remember from my youth.  Why?  Because at least they knew what they were and didn't pretend to be something else.  ""Hannibal"" is wretched excess.  Jodie Foster, Jonathan Demme, and Ted Tally were wise to steer clear of it.  You should do the same.",998524800,25,3016,4.679924242424242
1294497,2,B00003CXSO,"What a waste!  5 excellent performers combined into a product that has more holes in it than swiss cheese.  Aren't agents supposed to advise their clients against mistakes in judgment like this?
Has anyone figured out how Lecter can afford to flit about from country to country?  Is he selling surplus body parts?  And doesn't anyone check passports anymore? Whose name and picture are on Lecter's, anyway?
The ""R"" rating should be for ""repulsive"".  However historically accurate, the hanging was predictable.  Same with the knifing in the street, and dinner scene at the end.
Too bad that characters were left out of the movie, Verger's sister, in particular.  She was one of the more interesting persons in the book.  And why should the good doctor pitch Verger to his fate with the piggies?  Motivation, anyone?
The 2 stars are for the score, the photography, and the makeup.  The music was grand, and the photography, both interior and exterior, was exceptional. And Gary Oldman probably didn't recognize himself when he looked into a mirror.  Also a plus:  Francesca Neri.
In short, don't waste your time, nor the rental fee.  All of the principals can be seen in far superior products.  I was not just disappointed; I was downright disgusted.

1294498,2,B00003CXSO,"Being very fond of ""Manhunter"" and ""Silence...,"" and having read the book, I was excited by ""Hannibal.""  I sat in a packed house opening night. And I was repulsed by so much of the film that I wanted to walk outside, vomit without cessation for many hours, and promptly leave. First off, outstanding actress though she is, Jullianne Moore is not Jodie Foster.  Anthony Hopkins is great fun to watch, sure, but he seems wildly out of character this time around (""Okey dokey?!"").  The cincematogrophy is gorgeous, and the swelling arias are beautiful, but then Scott decides to throw some unfathomably graphic bit of imagery at us.  Some opening shootings aren't too bad, and Gary Oldman's ""melted wax puppet with leprosy"" makeup is only initially chilling, but then we see a vicious throat-cutting.  A crude disembowling.  An impaling.  A session of guesome (although rather amusing) sweetbread feedings.  And, of course, the piece-di-resistance, a bunch of pigs ripping the faces and limbs off of a bunch of flailing victims. Now, I have a strong penchant for gore, but this is absurd. The DVD redeems the film, however, with a smorgasboard of extras.  There are some neat deleted scenes, an interesting alternate ending, and a few other things worth digging into.

The acting was superb, though this film is certainly not for the weak of heart (or stomach), and the effects were very nicely done. Unlike Silence, Hannibal was focused mainly on the Doctor himself, leaving the viewer to almost grow to like him. I suppose some of the most intriguing films are the ones that you aren't exactly sure who the villain is, and they sometimes leave one guessing. My one complaint about Hannibal was that it was rather long and moved quite slowly, repetitively, up until the last half hour.

I was looking forward to seeing this movie for so long, after having enjoyed the book so much. What a disappointment. The characters (the ones they didn't omit, and ESPECIALLY Hannibal himself) are flat & poorly developed. The storyline has been sped up & hacked to bits to accommodate the Hollywood standard of a 2 hour film.

I believe the material would have been scraped had Hopkins passed. But his agreeing to repeat the role, the principles all were deluded into thinking they could recap the success (both commercially and artistically) of Demme's ""Silence of the Lambs."" There's an obsessive need to justify ""this isn't a sequel"" when it clearly is. And a failed one. Scenes that would have explained what was happening in the theatrical release (for instance, Anthony Hopkins licking Julianne Moore's automobile steering wheel) were excised, leaving us to wonder why Hopkins was even at Moore's door much less her dining room table. There's a very telling segment called ""Reaction"" when a video camera records the audience at the premiere in New York, and the audience reaction is so distracting with revulsion, yet Ridely Scott comments repeatedly they didn't want ""too much."" The film's final sequence and ending (where Harris' preposterious conclusion is discarded) is disappointing, when the filmmakers clearly had every opportunity to redeem the project, the actors and the audience. But they fall off the same cliff that Harris did: trying to tackle the glowing success of both book and film of ""Silence of the Lambs.""

1294555,4,B00003CXSO,"First of all, let's get one thing out of the way: this is not, nor will it ever be, a classic in the same way as its predecessor, Jonathon Demme's Silence of the Lambs (1991).  It is a different film, with different goals.
That being said, watching Silence of the Lambs and Ridley Scott's sequel Hannibal one after the other (as I just did) is quite instructive.  I realized that the second film is really a smart, densely woven deconstruction of the first. It rather methodically dissects the characters and situations of Silence of the Lambs by inverting them. For example, in the first film Clarice went to Hannibal, who was in a glass cage, because she needed something he could offer; in the second film, Clarice is the one in the cage - the public-relations nightmare of an FBI raid gone horribly wrong.  It is the now-free Hannibal who comes to see her, to satisfy his own needs - and also to dole out retribution on her behalf.
This natural, even logical extension of their odd ""courtship"" from the first film, along with subtexts drawn from Dante and Shakespeare (yes, Shakespeare) deepens the psychology of their rather Fruedian relationship.  Clarice is like Lavinia, daughter of Titus Andronicus, who is metaphorically raped and crippled by the system she is sworn to uphold.  Hannibal recalls Titus himself, reincarnated in an ironic, post-modern form, as he becomes the (admittedly unwanted) instrument of her revenge.  The film even ends with a grisly dinner scene and the sacrifice of his hand. (In a bit of cool irony, Anthony Hopkins also played the title role in Julie Taymor's film version of Titus in 1999 - a parallel seemingly lost on most - though not all - reviewers.)
Thomas Harris' novel of Hannibal also inverted characters and situations from Silence, though to an even greater extent (those who have read it know exactly what I mean).  The film, however, does not commit to Harris' ""fall from grace"" arc so completely, instead substituting metaphor and literary allusions.  Just as well; it is hard to imagine a modern film audience buying into the concept of an ""evil"" Clarice.  Hannibal the film takes these ideas about as far as a populist film can, then it turns them loose for us to take home and think about.
Julianne Moore takes over the role of FBI agent Clarice Starling from Jodie Foster, and, of course, Anthony Hopkins reprises his brilliant turn as Hannibal ""the cannibal"" Lecter.  The performances are first-rate all around, including supporting work by Gary Oldman as Dr. Chilton's doppelganger, Mason Verger; Giancarlo Giannini as an Italian detective with the significant (and unfortunate) name of Pazzi; and Frankie Faison as Hannibal's guard from the mental institution, Barney.
David Mamet and Steven Zaillian's screenplay is literate; wry. Ridley Scott's direction is, of course, a visual delight - though he has lately become a little too enamored of gimmicky stuff like quick-cutting, under-cranking, and narrow shutter angles.  Hannibal would have benefited had he lain off some of the MTV stuff.
The DVD release is well produced, with a sharp picture and terrific sound that really showcases Hans Zimmer's haunting (and at times wickedly funny) score.  The second DVD is full of first-class extras, including documentary material, multi-angle stuff on the ill-fated fish market shoot-out, storyboards, and other goodies.
Hannibal made money in its theatrical run, yes, but was not taken too seriously, being perceived as a sensationalist, Hollywood sequel to a more thoughtful original.  But I think it will actually grow in stature in the coming years, as people look past the sensationalism and marketing to realize what a really smart and witty movie it is.",998438400,,3715,5.021138211382114

Also I thought that ""Mason's"" sister in the book played a very important part. Did she not feed Mason an eel at the end and kill him. Where was she in the movie?

1294557,3,B00003CXSO,"(3 and 1/2 stars) Free of the novel's lousy ending, the film version of ""Hannibal"" contains enough suspense and atmosphere to make it worth a viewing.  Agent Starling's detective work is fairly involving, and some of the scenes are remarkable in the way they are constructed and their intensity.  I'm thinking particularly of the ""Cat and Mouse"" scene where Starling pursues Lecter through the shopping mall.  Even while I was repulsed by the ""Dinner"" scene near the end -- the only scene that justifies the kind of ""gross-out"" descriptions some critics gave the movie, it fit in well with the Lecter characters actions elsewhere and gave a measure of comeupance to Ray Liotta's character (certainly beyond what he deserved!).  Taken as a whole, it was an entertaining flick, well directed by Ridley Scott and well acted, but nowhere near as great as ""Silence of the Lambs.""
As for the double-disc DVD edition, the director's commentary on the ""feature"" disc is fairly typical of such DVD commentaries.  It does contain several interesting items of info.  The 2nd ""special features"" disc is a cornucopia of background details, including dozens of movie poster variations, the usual ""cast & crew"" dossiers, 14 deleted or alternate scenes, etc.  Definitely check out the ""alternate ending"" with Scott's comments, and decide for youself if you agree with the ending chosen for the film.",998438400,6,1383,5.092920353982301

This paints a much more even film thatn its ""Silence..."", where as in that film the whole atmosphere was swamped in a sort of thick unbearable nightmare.  This film is more visually driven giving the viewer a rush with the eyes instead of with the mind. The director Ridley Scott does what James Cameron did with Aliens after Scott filmed the original. Scott uses the films score and dark pallette to give the viewer a sense of displacement in the key scenes of the film. The story is quite simple lecter escapes his to new lands where we find a troubled Starling (Moore) who must put him back behind bars. The film has a perverse game of cat and mouse between Starling and Lecter that has them at key scenes being each others worst nightmares and at others being their saviors! Interms of sheer viewer involvement this film more than out does the original. Just watch the criss cross between columns and rained soaked cobbled streets as a niave pickpocket goes after Lecter only to be done away with.

1294561,5,B00003CXSO,"In the sequel to the 1991 Academy Award Winning film, ""The Silence of the Lambs"", Ridley Scott (Gladiator, Alien) sits in the director's chair aspiring a new gore fest sequel featuring the return of Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Academy Award Winner Anthony Hopkins), the canibalistic psychiatrist now roaming freely in Italy.  Under the name of Dr. Fell, Lecter's case is reopened after un-faced Mason Verger (Gary Oldman) seeks revenge upon him for his face being totally dismantled.  F.B.I. Agent Clarice Starling returns, this time played by Julianne Moore, after receiving a letter from Hannibal, she also begins to search him when learning that an Inspector Pazzi has discovered Lecter's being in Italy.  Pazzi as well, wants to capture Dr. Lecter for the $3,000,000.00 reward.  Though, the doc just might have a plan of his own, to seek out his beloved Clarice, and toy with her brain once more.  In doing so, the silence has been broken.
Of course, anyone which is almost everyone who enjoyed the first fright-fest original, Jonathan Demme's ""Silence of the Lambs"", then learning that a sequel from acclaimed director Ridley Scott, was being put into action, we all long awaited the return of Dr. Hannibal ""The Cannibal.""  We expected it to have the same scope as the original, of course because it was being helmed by the one and only Ridley, himself.  What began to draw back audiences was Jodie Foster not returning to her as Clarice Starling, instead being replaced by Julianne Moore.  Well February 9th, 2001 came, and audiences flocked to the theater to see the doc eat some human flesh once more, but half the audience was displeased, being it was a complete turn to the story of Hannibal Lecter, and that he didn't have the same spine tingling effect of the first.  Even while audiences got a new slice of the doc, they felt it was just a sequel filled with gore that was supposed to turn them on.  Pulling in $200,000,000.00 though, was a gold mine for the sequel.
I have to admit that I was impressed with this sequel, being Anthony Hopkins brought a new light to himself, and you finally see that there is at least a tad bit of care in his heart.  He will still slash and bite for a good time, but he loves Clarice Starling so much, that for those of you who have seen the end of this film, you know what I'm talking about.  He was still a spine tingling character, still had those words of kindness, as well as those dark words of terror.  That cracking fearsome smile still remained.  The calamity of Gary Oldman's disgusted Mason Verger character was unique, as well nasty.  How could one cut his own face off with a shard of glass just because a crazed psychiatrist tells him to?  Maybe it's just the power in Hopkins' voice.
While delightful, but just not a wonderful as hoped, Julianne Moore takes over for the magnificent Jodie Foster.  Moore's southern accent is nowhere near as good as Jodie's was.  Jodie was very believable and convincing, while Moore is missing a believable piece to the way she portrayed Clarice.  If Foster had returned, audiences would probably be raving about this film.  Moore was obviously not the right pick to replace Foster.  MGM should've waited on production if Foster's schedule was so busy.
Director Ridley Scott directs a star-cast group, and weaves in Thomas Harris's novel quite nicely, except for the gore-filled, gross out, surprise ending.  Now I have read the book ""Hannibal"", and I just saw the film today, and have to admit that I was much more into the film.  It took me to the same world ""Silence"" did, which to me is a very positive account.  I still felt that same feeling of thrills, especially when Lecter had on his face-guarding mask from the first film, than I realized that I was watching a great sequel to an original.  Scott's crafting of this intelligent suspense thriller is absolutely phenomenal as well engaging.  The story really picks you up from your seat, and you can feel the reality of Dr. Lecter.  Ridley Scott is obviously a wonderful director, and knows what a sequel needs.  There was basically no strong profanity, no real nudity (except for drawings) and no sexual content.  It's the gory gruesome violence that plugged this film into the ""R"" rated category, which it very well deserved.  I can understand Ridley's feel to make this film have a bigger gore count than the original, to show audiences a lot more than anything they'd seen before.  Scott's directing ability, though, is fantastic, and so is this sequel he has directed, which is worthy to the original.
With Foster not being present for the sequel, it fails to fascinate most audiences like the original did. While Hopkins'performance is ""to die for"", Julianne Moore isn't good enough to play Clarice, which flopped the film's success with the critics' and audiences' likeness.  Ridley Scott's timing was perfect for this film (10 years later), but if waiting was needed for Foster, they should've waited.  The plot was fabulous for a strong ""sequel"" which captures the same wit of ""Silence of the Lambs"", but performance wasn't all there.  As though for Anthony Hopkins, we were just awaiting to here one more time: ""Hello Clarice.""
""Hannibal does deserve five stars, being one of the best sequels this year.  This is one that lives up to its original, but needed to keep the same stars in the roles they belonged in- basically I'm talking about Jodie Foster.  Try HANNIBAL if you can handle strong gore violence, but otherwise, pass on it.""- MJV & the Movies.",998438400,6,5514,4.773445732349842
1294562,4,B00003CXSO,"First of all, you can't compare ""Hannibal"" with ""Silence of the Lambs"". It has to be taken on its own terms AND on several levels. By this, I mean that you need to see it as a piece of cinema art (and art it IS, unquestionably), as a piece of entertainment; AND you have to see it and ask: ""Do films like this benefit society by showing humanity in so debased a manner and by depicting acts of demoniac (and inventive) cruelty, in a world that is becoming increasingly violent and cruel?"" What message does this send to young and impressionable minds, already lacking positive role models?
The acting and direction are excellent, as is the makeup. And the beauty of the Goldberg Variations and the Italian renaissance settings were in brilliant counterpoint to the hideous doings. It is that very same counterpoint, between artistic genius and hideous, unfathomable sadism, that makes the character of Hannibal so compelling, and here the film remains true to the book. The famous ""dinner"" scene, although about as gross as a movie could ever be, succeeds in capturing the same almost comical yet profoundly macabre imagery. And we were spared the ridiculous ending of the book.

Unfortunantly, to me the movie comes off as being entirely unbelievable to an almost outrageous degree. Hannibal Lecter is supposed to be an extremely intelligent, resourceful man, yet he repeatedly makes very clumsy mistakes. Clarice had an interesting relationship with him, but I feel she would have never used lethal violence on others to rescue the ""good cannibal"" from a fate he rightly had coming to him. The man who once opened handcuffs with a small pork bone had to do what to his own hand to get out the second time around?  One of my biggest complaints was the unforgivible lack of attention given to details. From a poorly written letter, to ridiculous high definition, widescreen ""security camera footage"", and an FBI website that uses a flashplayer ""Warning: Do Not Enter"" button. To make up for the outrageous lack of suspense or viable plot line, they decided to make the death scenes really graphic. And as a grand finale, they decided to make Hannibal's last gruesome murder a 100% impossibility.

1294659,4,B00003CXSO,"In a marketing no-brainer, MGM  Home Entertainment has dove-tailed a new version of ""The Silence of the Lambs"" with the video debut of that suspense classic's controversial sequel, ""Hannibal."" The film, directed by Ridley Scott, transports upscale villain Hannibal Lecter from the hills of the Eastern U.S. to the mopeds and Michelangelos of Florence, Italy. While ""Lambs"" was awash in algae green, ""Hannibal"" is cast in pale blues. Colors on the disc are often flat but fine. There is at least one instance of speckling. The DTS and Dolby Digital audio mixes are a great improvement on ""Lambs,"" but remain subdued by action-picture standards. Julianne Moore plays FBI veteran Clarice Starling as a  weary centurion, one used to the violence of the streets, but still affected by it. She aptly renders the clipped speech Jodie Foster used in the original, making it more naturalistic and beliveable. Scott, in his mostly focused director's commentary, notes that Moore's great talent is to be ""always different in films she does."" Hopkins delivers a cartoon take on his aging Lecter, single-handedly bringing to mind the 007 transition from Sean Connery to Roger Moore. ""Hannibal's"" notoriety, of course, is based on its final scenes, in which any veneer of seriousness is stripped away. ""This has got to be funny,"" Scott observes, calling the cannibalism sequence ""the outrageous target at  the end of the film."" A ""very amused"" medical specialist was present on the set to ensure plausibility at the dinner table, says Scott, who tells more than you'd ever want to know about brain surgery (""The brain bleeds like a pig""). The filmmakers struggled with three possible endings, two of which were shot. One alternative ending -- included among the disc's 20 minutes of deleted scenes -- eliminates the bloody handcuff twist. Another scene, never shot, provided a James Bond-style ending, Scott reveals. The deleted scenes are far better than usual. One elegaic Florence scene features Hopkins/Hannibal playing a haunting original composition on piano. Other extras include a surreal but unused title sequence, an interactive breakdown of key scenes offering multiple camera angles, a series of making-of featurettes, and the usual photo galleries and TV spots.",998352000,,2260,5.254847645429363

Yet what Hannibal actually is, is a campy, trashy, B horror flick trapped in Hollywood A list confection. Here we have two great actors Anthony Hopkins and Julianne Moore forced to gnaw on a completely silly script, so choppy, you wonder if Freedy Kruger took a ""stab"" at writing it.
Although, Anthony Hopkins is masterful as Hannibal with his deep, dark eyes and soft purr of a voice, he seduces every scene with the creepiness of hairs raising on your back. That alone I guess would be worthy of viewing. Otherwise forget it, Hannibal seems totally obsessed with turning your stomach scene after scene with  some disgusting movie gore. Now, Silence of the Lambs had its moments of gruesomeness but it was just ""moments"" of it. Hannibal rolls in the gruesomeness like a pig in mud. This movie lacked a sharp, suspenseful script and the emotional landscape that made us care about Jody Foster and made us want to dig--cautiously--deeper into the mind of Mr. Lecter.
Hannibal is half-heartedly entertaining, to be kind, but it is definitely not a sequel, a follow up, or anything closely regarding Silence of the Lambs except for its two principle characters Hannibal and Clarice. Probably the most interesting and under-developed cinematic love saga of all time.
Hannibal the movie is a waking nightmare of what too many Hollywood sequels continue to fail at--making a movie that may not be better than the first, but at least attempt to make it a satisfying continuation.

1294803,4,B00003CXSO,"Having read the book that both excited, intrigued, and angered me I was eagerly awaiting HANNIBAL's release in theatres. When the night finally rolled around, I got what I expected. What did I expect, you may ask? I expected a great film and this is exactly what I got. However, HANNIBAL is great in its own way. One cannot even begin to think that it is nearly as good as the film it follows. The film is still a masterpiece though, buy it. Just don't expect to be scared silent.
  Dr. Hannibal Lecter managed a gruesome escape ten years ago. Ever since that fateful night in Memphis, he has lived splendidly in Florence. He is enjoying free space, Italian art, and keeping up with Clarice Starling. His dear Clarice has not had as grand a decade as he has. She is taking heat after a drug bust goes horribly wrong. She also knows she will probably lose her job, all while Dr. Lecter watches from afar. This a quite different Starling from the one we saw ten years before.
  Meanwhile, one of the good doctor's former victims is actively seeking him. Mason Verger (played humourously by an uncredited Gary Oldman) is incredibly wealthy and will use many resources (including the government and Clarice) to track and torture Lecter. Oldman does not even begin to bring the horror that was the novel's Verger. Oldman makes the role one of comic relief instead of horror. This one of the films low points.
  All in all, Hopkins and Moore do great jobs in their roles. Ridley Scott made this film so different that it is hard not to like it. Combining an excellent cast, close following of the book, great directing and beautiful scenary HANNIBAL is great film.

I found ""Hannibal"" to be more of a grotesque comedy than a true horror film. Still, the film has genuine suspense and gross-out thrills.
Anthony Hopkins reprises his role as Hannibal, the cannibalistic serial killer, and he is clearly having fun. Unlike the first film, ""Hannibal"" begins with the title character free and living the good life in Italy. Julianne Moore replaces Jodie Foster in the pivotal role of FBI agent Clarice Starling, who hunts for Hannibal (and, I might add, she's quite good in the role).
But Hannibal is also being hunted by the agents of Mason Verger, a ""reformed"" child molester who was repulsively mutilated by Hannibal and who wants revenge. Gary Oldman clearly relishes this outrageous role, and the make-up effects for this character are truly spellbinding. Verger's fiendish plans for Hannibal involve a herd of man-eating pigs. Add to the mix Giancarlo Giannini as an avaricious Italian cop on Hannibal's trail and Ray Liotta as Starling's sleazeball colleague, and you have a truly Jerry Springer-ish collection of oddballs.
Some bemoaned the film's gore, but I found ""Hannibal"" to be an outrageous good time. In fact, the violence is so absurdly baroque that it is funny--""Hannibal"" plays almost like a coolly intelligent spoof of ""splatter"" films. And the exquisite musical score and locales add to the filmgoer's pleasure quotient.

 The biggest reason for me liking this film so much is the fact i like Ridley Scott and the stunning Julianne Moore, (who fills Fosters shoes very well) This DVD is one of if not the best one i have seen. The presentaion is supberb and not to mention the huge bonus amount of special features. Ridley directs with passion and the cinematography really shows on DVD. From the tense opening scene to the beautiful shots in Venice look outstanding on the region 4 format.
As far as the special features go also five *****. The second disk gives you a generous amount of over four hours of entertainment! From angle change functions to deleted scenes it's endless how much fun this second disk provides. It took me three 2 hour sessions to get through everything. What i liked the best was how they show the veiwer how they managed to pull off the graphic but effective special effects, to wild boars.

1294809,3,B00003CXSO,"I am such a fan of Thomas J Harris that I would watch a movie based on his books sight unseen, along with reading anything that he has written - which I have.
I was taken back by this film (and the book) because it was so shockingly different than the first one. The first one centered around Clarice (Jodie Foster) and her interactions with the Doctor. This installment was completely focused on the Doctor himself, so I hoped for his interesting qualities to be explored deeper than in the first assignment.
What intrigued me so much with the first film was Dr. Hannibal ""The Cannibal"" Lecter. In this film, I can say I have had my fill.
I've always thought that what set Dr. Hannibal apart from other fictional serial killers is that he was such an amazing genius, formally trained in psychology and able to use those obtained skills in his crimes.
The way that he could realistically break down a person's history/background based on a few mannerisms and introspective questions. His power was not how gruesome he could be, but how smart he could be.
In this film, we pass up the genius as if we are supposed to take it for granted and we focus on the gore.
He's called the cannibal....
In the last film he talked a man into ""swallowing his own toungue"" and killing himself. In this film he never really did anything that was amazing in it's own right, it had to be gruesome to be remarkable and that is where this film fell flat.
The history of horror films is filled with really weird people that like to kill. Lecter was so much better than that, his real power was something that no one could take away from him because it was his intellect and understanding of the human psyche.
In this film we are faced with Lecter indulging his weirdness without any brilliance.
Let's put it this way - I have never enjoyed a horror movie that people laugh at, and parts of this movie felt like a parody.",997315200,,1899,4.444126074498567

1294930,4,B00003CXSO,"[*An image from the film that I think would make a better title than plain old ""Hannibal"".]
""The Silence of the Lambs"" worked on every level it aimed for.  It was a perfect suspense-thriller, horror flick, character study, mood piece, and most effectively, psychological drama.  ""Hannibal"" doesn't bother to try its hand at all of these, and who's to blame it for that?  The ones it does try for (thriller, horror flick, mood piece) are pulled off with aplomb.  It's full of blood and gore, all in the name of some serious campy fun (""fun"" being the key word here).  And on top of that it manages to be a pretty gripping love story, too.  Well... within the context of the serial killer genre, that is.
""Hannibal"" doesn't shy away from references to its frequently decorated parent.  We are played tapes of past Lecter/Starling interviews, are reunited with Barney the nurse, and are shown that Hannibal still fits into that gruesome green mask.  Knowledge of ""Silence"", then, is mandatory.  But ""Hannibal"" is a different animal, so to speak.  It doesn't take itself so seriously.  For example, any suggestion of the sexism that Clarice must overcome in the FBI is over-the-top and cartoonish.  And, like ""Silence"", it revels in its showstopper set pieces.  But where in ""Silence"" we weren't shown the violence and the gore, ""Hannibal"" leaves no stone unturned.  Witness the splattering on the pavement after Lecter disembowels then hangs a pursuer, or the finale featuring Ray Liotta (if you haven't yet been tipped off about this scene, you soon will) that leaves little for the mind's eye to fill in.  Whereas some have found these scenes distasteful and unnecessary, I beg to differ.  They serve two purposes: a distancing from the style of ""Silence, and a celebration of the campy fun that dominates the film's tone.
That's not to say that everything in the film is over the top and outrageous.  There are several scenes in which information is conveyed with shrewd restraint.  I'm thinking mainly of a quick scene that reveals what happened to Lecter's predecessor at a University library, and the chilling epilogue that resolves any unanswered questions left after the denouement (I'm loathe to give too much away here; please discover these scenes for yourself).  Those in the audience expecting to have their hands held throughout the plot will miss much here, if they don't pay close attention.  Kudos to director Scott for trusting his audience's intellect.
Anthony Hopkins reprises his role as the good doctor, and does a superb job showing how the man has evolved over the last ten years.  He is still frightening as hell, but also more assured, jubilant, and especially playful.  Age has allowed Lecter to relax within his skin (would a ""Silence""-era Hannibal have gotten away with giddily exclaiming ""Okey-Dokey"" when moving in for a kill?), while honing his ability to control his deviant instincts.  It has also made him restless, which sets the narrative moving.
Julianne Moore doesn't really get to do much here, except allude to and update the performance that Jodie Foster gave as Clarice Starling.  In that respect, she does a bang-up job, subtly recreating her erratic accent while giving her a touch of world-weariness.  But really, this is not her movie, and the underwritten part shows that.
The Lecter/Starling relationship, which did much to drive ""Silence"", is somewhat of a disappointment.  Sure, an ocean separates the two for much of the film's first half, but much more could have been done to enhance the connection between the characters.  As it is, the audience is expected to do much of the work, by remembering what they had going in ""Silence"" and transplanting it into this film.  That's just lazy filmmaking.  Still, Hopkins has a familiar chemistry with Moore, as he had with Foster, so any blemish is easily forgotten.
The rest of the cast has very little to work with, mostly playing one-dimensional characters to various degrees of success.  Gary Oldman, under mounds of make-up, is at his scene-stealing best as the only victim of Dr. Lecter who survived.  Ray Liotta on the other hand, as Starling's sexist superior, is just too ridiculous.  He is a distraction from the campy fun.  The one standout in this one-dimensional dramatis personae is Giancarlo Giannini.  He plays Rinaldo Pazzi, an Italian police detective who unwittingly gets more mixed up in the Lecter affair than he originally intended.  Giannini infuses his Pazzi with dollops of sadness (witness his droopy eyes), bumbling cunning, and subtly concealed fright.
I have not read Thomas Harris' source novel, and don't intend to.  So I can't speak to how the film holds up in comparison.  I can say that in comparison with ""Silence"" it is not close in matching that film's classic status.  However, ""Hannibal"" is a fun, campy ride that left me with a feeling of adrenalized exhilaration on par with what I felt the first time that I saw ""Silence"".",997142400,4,4958,4.950423216444982

1294932,3,B00003CXSO,"This movie was definitely entertaining and good by many people's standards, but it pales in comparision to its predecessor.  In an attempt to outdo ""Silence of the Lambs"", the director made every character more extreme and therefore less believable.  Clarice Starling was tougher and smarter (like that part with the perfume).  Hannibal Lecter was waaaaay smarter, crueler, and more all-knowingish.  The obligatory sexist pig police officer was way more piggish and dumb.  Etcetera etcetera.  In taking all the characters to these extremes, they removed much of the credibility that was so key to the terror of the original movie: for something to be truly horrifying, you have to believe that it could be real.  Real people have many sides, and are alternatingly tough, scared, frightening, confident, stupid, or smart.  These characters came off as pretty one-dimensional because they lacked the contradictions everyone has in them.  I had a hard time believing that anyone could be as quick as Starling, or so collected while remaining so evil as Hannibal.  True, these were the things that made Hannibal so scary and Clarice so endearing in ""Silence"", but they were successful because they were within the realm of reality.  ""Hannibal"" ignores any sense of being realistic when it comes to characters. The only other flaw I found was the climactic scene, which I won't spoil for any (who obviously haven't seen the movie, if they're reading a review of it).  I thought it, like the characters, was taken to such extremes that any credibility was removed, therefore taking away was makes it so scary.  Instead it became almost laughable, but mostly embarrassing - for whoever tried so hard to outdo ""Silence"" - perhaps too hard - and failed. Aside from these two elements, though, it is a very entertaining and somewhat scary movie.  But thanks to the directing, it remains just that - a movie - not, as ""Silence"" became, a masterpiece.",997056000,,1939,5.037617554858934

This movie is a great movie overall and I highly recommend it to everyone. At time's it is funny and at others it's down right horrific. This movie will offer something for everyone!",997056000,,545,4.25
1294934,5,B00003CXSO,"I had been wanting to see this film for a long time, ever since the 1991 Academy Awards when Billy Crystal asked Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins about the sequel and both confirmed it was coming. Upon the release of Michael Mann's Manhunter and Demme's Silence of the Lambs, this film seems poised to come under incredible scrutiny, which it did.  Manhunter was more police procedure suspense film, which veered into the more horrific parts of humanity; whereupon, Silence took that notion and fleshed it out even more. Police procedure became horror film and vice versa and the door was left open with Lector walking away peacefully in Jamaca. Now comes Hannibal, the inevitable conclusion to this series and takes its subject directly into the horrific. The last two films combined had locked doors, pits, bugs, sharp teeth, cannibalism, etc and the terror was built out of your mind's eye (with the exception of Lector pulling the face off the victim in the back of the ambulence; which detractors of Hannibal tend to forget), and now comes the almost operatic notion of criminals on the run being pursured by FBI, perverts and money hungry and fame seeking detectives, not to mention killer pigs. The series was building up to this nightmarish series of images and taken as a whole, this is the most distubring horror series possibly ever made. Hannibal, seems more like a foreign film than the blood and guts slasher film that everyone seems to think it is. Is it bloody? Yes, but enough so--not overly. This isn't Dawn of the Dead, people. The ironic thing was that alot of attention was made that the filmmakers changed the ending of the book, which they did--and it works beautifully; however, the ending of the book probably would have worked in this adaptation of the film. The idea of Lector and Starling together would not have seemed out of left field coming out of this film. All in all, though--this film will be thought well over time and if not chalk this up with other great horror films that no one seems to pay any attention to (Mute Witness, Opera, Blair Witch 2, Cherry Falls). Take what you want from this film, but I feel this is one of the best and strongest horror films in recent memory; so if you are into bubblegum horror--please stay away.",996796800,10,2270,4.717884130982368
1294935,3,B00003CXSO,"You would think that with the combination of a fantastic director like Ridley Scott, stellar screenwriters like David Mamet and Steven Zaillian, and astounding actors like Anthony Hopkins and Julianne Moore; that you would have one of the greatest films ever made. Well Hannibal is, disappointedly, far from it.
Scott's normally masterful direction is quite weak in Hannibal. Many of the action/suspense sequences are rather lifleless, which is surprising considering he's given us such riveting films as Alien and Gladiator.
Steven Zaillian and David Mamet's screenplay is not what you would come to expect from the men who wrote such masterworks Schindler's List and The Untouchables. They had a little too much fun with some of the characters. There are some very awkward lines of dialogue. A little more depth and thoroughness wouldn't have hurt.
The pacing isn't the greatest either. After the opening shoot-out (which isn't that riveting, anyway), the film takes a while to get going again.
Anthony Hopkins gives a solid performance. Julianne Moore is pretty good but I couldn't help but miss Jodie Foster. Gary Oldman delivers an unnecessarily over-the-top performance and comes off as being quite annoying, as the disturbed Mason Verger. Giancarlo Giannini gives a great performance, and probably the film's best, as the sleazy Italian detective, Rinaldo Pazzi.
Some of the films highlights are John Mathieson's sharp and atmospheric cinematography and Han Zimmer's wonderfully haunting musical score.

1294936,4,B00003CXSO,"There is a lot shadowing over Hannibal to stop audiences from enjoying it. The critics didn't think it was too flash, the censors gave it mighty high ratings and most sequels, according to some peoples philosophy, aren't worth the time. I was really looking forward to seeing this movie and I wasn't distracted by any of the above. At the start I honestly found Hannibal a little boring, but when the cool detective story comes in it gives the film a little more life. We needed something else to keep the film going however, because it was missing the chemistry of the first. When Lecter finally enters the United States, things heat up. The gore splashes everywhere, the scenes are more exciting, the characters get meatier (in both senses of the word) and the audience will start to get more involved. The detective story in the first hour or so in the film is very well played and neat, the killings in the movie are creative, the cinematography is beautiful and the soundtrack is stunning. At times the film goes a bit off-course and is a wee bit laughable, but it remains enjoyable in the focused parts of the movie, which is a lot of the film, not much of it is really bad bad. Ridley Scott directs the movie fabulously and gives us stylish and memorable scenes. Some scenes in the movie are memorable in a bad way, though, Ill warn you now. The acting is brilliant, with Julianne Moore fabulous as a more determined but less interesting Clarice Starling, Anthony Hopkins as a scarier and less mature Hannibal and Gary Oldman who is great but completely unrecognisable as grotesque make-up covers his face. Hannibal is a gross, great and gory re-visit to the character we enjoy so much, I recommend it to people who either enjoyed the first film or enjoy very extreme deaths in movies.",996624000,,1792,4.638364779874214

Much has been made of this movie being relatively gory compared to the first. I frankly think people don't remember the first if they think so, but I understand. Hannibal is much more PSYCHOLOGICALLY horrifying the aesthically horrifying. But the fact is the this horror does nothing to advance the plot. It is purely there to horrify.

1294968,3,B00003CXSO,"A decent follow-up to ""The Silence of the Lambs,"" the adaptation from Richard Harris' novel just shows too much to be truly terrifying, at least in the psychological sense.
First, it is important to note what a great job both Moore and Hopkins do in this picture.  Their performances keep a movie with a mediocre script truly entertaining.  The supporting cast is excellent as well, with Ray Liotta and Gary Oldman (though you wouldn't know it from his appearance).  Hopkins alone puts in a performance that makes this movie worth seeing.
My biggest gripe against this movie is the unnecessary gore that is displayed with too much frequency.  For me, the most terrifying part of ""Silence"" was learning how the man occupying the cell next to Lector died.  We didn't see it, we just heard about, leaving our imagination to create the imagery for us.  In ""Hannibal,"" there's just no room for imagination.
Like I said, the movie is completely character driven, which works because there is a great cast.  For those of you who were disappointed in the ending of the novel (I know I was), the movie provides a different (and in my opinion, more appropriate) ending.
In the end, I think your enjoyment of this film will be based on the expectations you have going into it.  I think this movie is extremely successful as a thriller or horror film, but it doesn't have the developed psychological component of ""The Silence of the Lambs,"" or ""Manhunter"" (the first in the Hannibal Lector series).",996105600,4,1486,4.77734375
1294969,4,B00003CXSO,"I'm not going to go into what the original book ending was to Hannibal, but the ending chosen for the movie was a copout. As for the movie, that would be my only complaint. Moore held her own in a role that doesn't call for much depth an insight, as this is Hopkins' show. One of the real bright spots is of course Gary Oldman as the main antagonist Mason Verger. The makeup is fantastic and his sadistic portrayal of the character is dead on perfect. All in all, better than Manhunter but a notch below SOTL. If you are going in expecting Silence of the Lambs Part Two, you will be disappointed. Hannibal is on the loose and the psychological interplay he had with Clarice in the first film won't work as well here as action does.

When I found out Jodie Foster wasn't playing in the sequel I was a disappointed, then I saw the movie and I realized how come she didn't.

1294972,2,B00003CXSO,"Let's not fool ourselves into thinking that this is a good movie. The follow-up to the critically successful ""Silence of the Lambs,"" is a meager attempt at best.

In a movie with such great talent and a pretty good director, you would hope that the movie would succeed where the novel failed, but that was not the case.
What intrigued me about the first film was the everlooming presence of Anthony Hopkins. Behind the glass cage, you sensed the danger in his character. In this film, he's all over the place. Now, he's just an old guy that's walking across the street. They tried humanizing him, trying to give him more emotions to work with, which was a mistake, since at face value, Anthony Hopkins looks like one of your dad's older friends - harmless - instead of the psychopathic killer we'd expect from him. His presence is gone. Now we know why he's a psychopathic killer; ...
Honestly, the only thing that kept me awake in the film are the over the top gross out scenes we'd expect from a bad ""Nightmare on Elm St."" film. If this film didn't receive the NC-17 rating for violence, I don't know what will.
Still, Anthony Hopkins gives a great performance. That's about it.",996019200,2,1318,4.518828451882845
1294973,4,B00003CXSO,"From the first moment of the opening credits I knew that this was a different angle on the ""Lecter-Starling show"". Classy, arty titles and a very chic overall feel contrasted with the SoTL opening sequences which are almost home movie by comparison. However therein lies the problem. The gloss of ""Hannibal"" removes us to a distance from the characters, and where SoTL was visceral, sweaty, and real, Hannibal is almost voyeuristic by comparison, somewhat uninvolving.
It was only my familiarity and, yes, fondness for the characters which drew me in and it was only my active interest in developments which kept me working at watching the film, and compared to SoTL, there was some work involved.
Where the book fleshed out Lecter, free in his own world of culture and experiences for the refined mind, the film touches the same ideas, but without the literary backup offering insights into Lecter's thoughts and views on the world around him, we can only watch the character, and, superb though Hopkins' acting is, there is almost inevitably a loss of contact with the character of Lecter.
The scene shift from the opening FBI stakeout in the bleached concrete wilderness of the US location, to the sumptuous vistas of Florence bathed in golden light serves to emphasise the gulf between Lecter's and Starling's worlds, and the killer with refined tastes lives well while the good-intentioned Starling suffers under the media spotlight. Having emphasised this aspect so well, the film then falters in its mission to bring these two diametric opposites together, achieved so well in the book.
The book strains credibility to a massive degree, but has the cohesiveness and plausibility to allow us to become involved and to believe, for a while, what we're being told (sci-fi does this all the time, but then we're way out of the ""normal world"", whatever that might be). However Hannibal- The Film, because it is less closely involved and somewhat voyeuristic, and meant to be set in the world of today, not tomorrow, keeps us at a distance, keeps us questioning just how plausible the whole thing is.
So, I suppose I don't like the film then ... but I do. Bereft of the smaller details (Barney's role for example, more extensive in the book) it certainly seems shallow, but in terms of cinematic effect it works well on the big screen. Quite how it will come across on DVD I don't know.
The high spots for me were the scene at the opera (with Lecter effectively stalking Pazzi), for the music (Vide Cor Meum on the soundtrack CD) which is a moment of sublime beauty around a killer on the loose, and the Florence location in general. In fact Florence was one of the stars of the film (who's she?!).",996019200,,2699,4.806451612903226

I understand that this might be a movie that many find disgusting or bad and that's fine. But trying to say that this was the sequel to the original ""The Silence of the Lambs"" is wrong, both as a movie and as a book.
The first book and film was ""Red Dragon"" filmed under the name ""Manhunter"" with Brian Cox (Braveheart) as Hannibal Lecter (retitled Lecktor in this film) and it is actually a pretty good adaptation of that first book. As with the second one, everybody knows that Anthony Hopkins made for one of the most memorable and dangerous serial killers in motion picture history so I don't blame that most people think of this as the real original. But what happened with the adaptation of ""S.O.T.L"" was that it actually became better then the book. More linear and fast paced. Now, ""Hannibal"" became much more violent and offensive as a book then compared to ""S.O.T.L"" but this is toned down in the movie. (If you don't belive me, read the book.) And ""S.O.T.L"" became more violent as a film. (Once again, if you don't believe me, read that book.)
So, is ""Hannibal"" a good film, yes, I would say so. But it isn't a good enough adaptation. It takes away some of the characters which could have made for a more important movie and it also takes away Hannibals background and the original ending. The only thing that I didn't like with the film was Julianne More as Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster is still much better).

That wasn't what really ruined this film.  What did it in was the fact that it followed the novel beautifully until the last 3 or so chapters, when someone had the horrible idea of changing the ending!  In the novel, Hannibal and Clarice just happen to run off together.  She never tries to escape, he never cuts off his hand.  It's supposed to end as if there will not be another sequal.  But no, someone, be it Scott or whoever did the screenplay, didn't have the sack to use that ending.  It would be too offensive for the public to handle, so it was changed so Hannibal still looks evil and Clarice still looks like the good ""guy"".  In Hollywood, good and evil can not merge, it's just against all rules of filmmaking, right?

Hopkins' performance is good, but this is not a surprise.  He has been so typecast as a villain that it doesn't seem like he's acting.
Julianne Moore plays Clarice Starling.  Alas, she is no actress.  Her performance is wooden.  But then again the writing didn't create much sympathy for her character.  Ray Liotta is also in this film, over-playing his role as a manipulative FBI chief.  Ridley Scott did a good job of directing.  There was constant action and the scenes all contained the shock value which was intended.  Good cinematography too.
All that said, my feelings about this movie can be summed up in one word:  ""YUCK"".  It was mildly interesting to me just to see how far a film can go to shock audiences.  I sure couldn't fall asleep in this one.  But unless you, like me, are just curious, I'd recommend you avoid this one.",995241600,,1137,4.582089552238806

Obviously if you compare the two, it just doesn't measure up.  You have to look at ""Hannibal"" as its own film rather than a sequel.

I am a person who likes to read books that movies are based on. In many cases this helps me to understand the movie better.  I have noticed that many reviewers on this movie have been overly disgusted with it.  I would like to suggest to all of you that you try the book. I can guarantee that the story follows better, and the man-eating pigs will make more sense....
The movie actually follows the story-line from the book very well, with minor scenes cut out for time and movie-boredom-factor.  The book does get into Lecter's head quite well and you begin to know the man better and understand him. Hannibal is more directed toward the relationship between Lecter and Clarice than an outside source, as Silence... was. Meanwhile the makeup affects are outstanding and the acting is of amazing calibur.
You must understand at the same time that there was a different director involved (Ridley Scott)and so he has his rights to portray the story differently from Jonathan Demme.  It may not have been as dark and scary at The Silence of the Lambs, but is by no means following the trend of cheap thrillers.

Maybe that is what caused me to hate this movie so much.  This movie is flawed on so many different levels.  First of all, you can tell that the script is bad based on Jodie Foster's decision to turn it down.  That leads to another problem of Julianne Moore playing the role of Gillian Anderson playing the role of Agent Starling.  They try waaaaaaaaaaaay to hard with Gary Oldman, who has his first ever awful role here, in my opinion.  The movie also takes place in Italy revolving around an inspector there.  Then they throw in some pigs or something which they borrowed from Snatch, not even being original here.  Some man eating pigs.  O.k., if that's not bad enough, Lecter actually touches Starling's hair as he's going around on a merry-go-round thing.  Corny, Campy, and just plain BRUTAL.  Next time, and there is a next time since they are re-making the prequel, they should make a real attempt at re-creating what made Silence of the Lambs so good, which is getting in your mind.

1295146,2,B00003CXSO,"It's inevitable: Make a sequel to a classic film (such as ""The Silence of the Lambs"" was), and viewers will compare it to the original. Ninety-nine times out of 100, that comparison will be unfavorable.
""Hannibal"" is not awful. The main problem I had was the way in which it destroyed some of the mystique surrounding Hannibal Lecter's character.
In ""Manhunter,"" and especially ""The Silence of the Lambs,"" Hannibal Lecter was pure evil -- death and chaos incarnate. From the minute Anthony Hopkins first appears in ""The Silence of the Lambs,"" you realize he is only in prison because he hasn't CHOSEN to escape yet. He's smarter than everyone else in the film, including Clarice. Scariest of all was how what he was capable of was left to the viewer's imagination: Watch the first scenes in ""Silence"" in which Hannibal's character is described before he's shown on-screen.
With ""Hannibal,"" Lecter is the main character, and it's therefore necessary to EXPLAIN him a little. I'd preferred to believe Lecter's interest in Clarice was more intellectual than romantic, but ""Hannibal"" leaves little doubt of his (perversely) romantic intentions. By showing what novelist Thomas Harris conceived as the upward limits of how bad Lecter could be, it didn't allow me to imagine even worse crimes.
Worst of all was the attitude with which Lecter was approached. In ""Silence,"" only Lecter himself (and Hopkins) treated him as campy -- which is appropriate, as Hannibal Lecter certainly would have that attitude. In ""Hannibal,"" unfortunately, EVERYONE with the possible exception of Clarice Starling (and Julianne Moore) -- including director Ridley Scott and screenwriters David Mamet and Steven Zaillian -- treat Lecter as a campy character, thus reducing him from the disturbingly attractive embodiment of evil to just another movie slasher.
The performances are great. Hopkins, Gary Oldman and Ray Liotta are all clearly having fun in their roles. Moore, to her credit, does not do a Jodie Foster impression but makes the character her own, and more's the pity that Clarice is almost an afterthought in this film. The script is imaginative and twisted.
If this was a different character, I probably would have given the film three stars.",993600000,,2229,5.143250688705234
1295147,2,B00003CXSO,"Jeesh, this is the first movie I have ever seen where someone in the theater threw up due to the content of the movie.  In fact, I am still astonished that movies with content like this are given an R rating, while movies with excessive naughty language or exposed genitals get the NC-17 or X shaft.
Regardless of content, this movie was pretty flat.  Sir Anthony Hopkins was good as usual, and I thought Julianne Moore did a pretty good job as well, but the script and direction were very much lacking in brains.
Ridley Scott's directing is very high in style, but has little substance.  He fills the screen with slick shots and edits, but they do not bring any deeper meaning to the film.  He also leaves nothing unsaid, never letting the audience figure out anything on their own.
One example illustrates how much better of a movie Jonathan Demme made in Silence of the Lambs.  Both films explored the aspect of women in a mostly male occupation (FBI agent), and the difficulties that come with it.  Silence of the Lambs portrayed this with subtle eye movements and stares from men over Clarice Starling's body.  Hannibal does it with Ray Liotta screaming, ""country pussy"" over and over again.
Character development is handled the same way.  The script throws Mason Verger's early fancy for young boys right out at our first proper introduction to him, seemingly so we can start hating him at that point.
The story puzzled me as well.  They set up Lecter as a brilliant man, foiling any plot to recapture him with violently clever retribution, only to have him fall into an obvious and foolish trap.
This movie lacks the suspense of Silence, and its only fallback seems to be gory violence.  Every death seems to get grizzlier, with blood and guts filling the screen.  If you are looking for a thriller, this isn't it.  If you are looking for a mindless slasher, this is your movie.",993513600,12,1885,4.644578313253012

He did the same for Hannibal in this film adaption of Harris's book of the same title.  However, little can be said for much else of this film.  Don't get me wrong, Julianne Moore is a talented actress, but perhaps not suited to this role.  Personally, I feel that the role should've went to Gillian Anderson, whose character on the ""X-Files"" (Dana Scully) was in fact based on Clarice Starling.  Props to JM though, she had big shoes to fill in the abscence of Jodie Foster.  Ridley Scott is probably best known for his work on ""Gladiator.""  He has a way with the camera.  He works it as though one was on a rollercoaster.  I felt as though many of the shots in the movie were extremely elaborate and unnecessarily so.  For instance, what was up with the squence at the beginning with random images?  Was there a hidden meaning?  Finally, the ending.  Now, I won't give it away for those who haven't seen the movie yet, but it forces Hannibal to do something that fans would know not to be true to his character.

In this movie, Hannibal is no different that Freddy Krueger, Jason, or even that ... doll Chucky. The movie is so predictable that even a small child could pick out every character who was going to die within the first five minutes of the movie.
Another huge flaw was the way in which Hannibal's victims met their end. The italian cop is killed by Hannibal after he goes up to apprehend him and conveniently forgets to bring his gun along with him....then the two hitmen who do manage to remember to bring guns to get Hannibal with just seem to freeze for no apparent reason while Hannibal slashes them with a small knife.
And maybe it was just me, but the way Mason Verger was killed made absolutely NO sense what so ever. And what the hell was up with the killer pigs? Killer pigs?!?!?! I should  have realized at that point that the movie would be a complete mess.
Anyways, the movie is gory...and it will gross just about everyone out. But it is in no way scary or suspenseful at all. There is very little difference between this movie or Hellraiser....

1)  I read the book (which was not the best) and thankfully the movie doesn't follow the book too closely (especially the ending).
2) Julianne Moore took on a big task of taking over for Jodie Foster - it took me until half way through the movie to stop comparing the two.  Julianne did an okay job of portraying Clarice.
3)  The movie was slow in parts...just like the book.  Especially the scenes in Europe.
All in all, it's a decent movie...not the best but not the worst I have seen.  There are some really good parts and great special effects.  Anthony Hopkins really helps bring the movie to an average level.",992563200,,633,4.460869565217391
1295154,2,B00003CXSO,"There's a lot to be said for ""Hannibal"".  The only word that summarizes this movie well is ""botched"".  Setting aside the problems of typical sequelitis, this movie suffers exceptionally from the burdens of such enormous expectations and the breadth of its foundations.
To begin with, the source book ""Hannibal"" by Harris has many advantages not available to the film:  the luxury of extravagant description and elaboration; superior manipulation of time, mood and tension; more intricate character development; and utter lack of input from thrice-damned Hollywood test audiences.  These tools aren't available to the film - we never see the fully developed contrast between Verger and Lecter.  We are never exposed to the depth of Lecter's brilliance or the heights of his evil.  Neither is Verger's twisted being allowed to fester in our minds as an offence to all that is decent.  As a result, the mood in the film suffers horribly, and what I feel is the crucial plot to ""Hannibal"" is lost.
The directing is also horrendous.  I find it hard to believe that the same man who directed ""Alien"", ""Blade Runner"" and ""Gladiator"" could have so mishandled a movie.  He relies on gore instead of suspense, surprise instead of tension, and complexity instead of intrigue.  There is no attempt to establish the proper moods at any point in the film.  The movie is stilted, trite, and lacking in the elements that make a really GOOD thriller.  Thanks for nothing, Ridley.
Just as a side note:  I am a pathologist.  I handle human tissue on a regular basis.  I realize it doesn't come up that often in movies, but do you suppose it is too much to ask that you folks do your homework, and try to come up with a fake brain that LOOKS like brain?
This movie does have a few bright points:  Moore, Hopkins and Oldman.  While the movie is generally poorly executed, I find myself taking comfort in the superb acting from the cast.  Moore proved herself equal to the task of playing Clarice Starling in Foster's shadow.  She managed to convey the hopeless frustration of a woman disillusioned by that she held dear with amazing virtuosity.  To wax at all on Hopkins' or Oldman's performance is to damn them with faint praise - they were simply magnificent.
All in all, this is a movie that should never have been made.  There was simply no way to accomodate the inspirational material in a manner to do it justice AND live up to the expectations of a sequel to ""Silence"".  Add to that the ridiculous oversight of Hollywood backers (""We don't LIKE this ending.  Change it.""  Those maggots probably wanted to change the ending of ""Casablanca"" too) and you have a movie that never fails to disappoint.",992476800,6,2682,4.7678958785249455
1295155,4,B00003CXSO,"Apparently I get the impression that if you slam a movie with a bad review, exactly what the vast majority of people here have done with ""Hannibal"", that it makes you sound like an expert critique of movies.  The sad part is that half of you spell Lecter wrong.  The next time you review a movie maybe you should actually try to sound like you know what you're talking about.  Now...
As much as ""Silence"" kept most of the gore in the mind or off screen, a lot of you don't realize that Hannibal Lecter is a KILLER.  I wouldn't have been surprised if he had done more than just serve a man's brain as dinner.  I knew and definitely anticipated when I first saw this movie that it wasn't going to just beat around the bush with how gruesome his character was, and I'm glad they didn't.  I'm also glad that they didn't go into any detail concerning Hannibal's childhood as Harris did in the novel.  Putting that on screen would have confused us on whether we should sympathize with this cannibal and his harsh past.  The character works much better as the antihero he is.
I don't think in any way that Hannibal lost his menace from ""Silence"" at all.  It would have been silly for him to repeatedly pop out of dark corners and eat people.  Some might argue that he does this in the movie, but if you look closely you can see that he never sneaks up on the audience itself so to speak.  The fact is that his character is a calm and calculating killer, not a teenager in a ghost mask brandishing a knife.  What makes him scary is the fact that he might be kissing your hand at an opera one minute and biting your face off the next.
I think it's great that Anthony Hopkins decided to do this movie regardless of the terrible reviews which were definitely inevitable.  As a sequel, it's hard to even consider it one because the storyline is so far removed from where ""Silence"" left off.  I think people merely came to the conclusion that if Foster, Demme and Tally didn't want a part of it that it must be a bad movie.  Not the case.
I enjoyed the movie, I enjoyed Ridley Scott's direction which didn't turn the movie into a full-out slasher flick but instead gave it a tone worthy of ""Hannibal the cannibal"", I enjoyed the story, and I also believe that if the movie had gone the direction of the book in the end I wouldn't have minded.  But, in order to have done that the movie would have to have been lengthened by at least two hours.  I have absolutely no problem with the screenplay's ending though, it fits the characters well.
Bottom Line: Hannibal is a good movie, after watching it I said to myself, ""I want this movie on DVD"", and a lot of people seem to feel the same way regardless of all the uninformed reviews from you people who gave it one star.

I also noticed that the majority of the fans don't even realize that The Silence of the Lambs was not the first of the Hannibal Lecter series. It was in Manhunter that Doctor Lecter made his first unforgettable appearance. The film was in theaters briefly in 1986 if I recall correctly. However, Brian Cox portrayed Lecter instead of the great Anthony Hopkins. The latter plays the character much better, in my opinion. In addition, in case anyone is interested, Ted Tally is currently working on the script for a prequel; actually, a remake of Manhunter. It will be entitled Red Dragon, which is the name of the book by Thomas Harris that Manhunter was based on. It is scheduled to begin filming in September of this year. Hopkins has not yet decided whether or not he will take on the role of Lecter once again due to the relatively small part that Lecter has in Red Dragon; he will decide when the script is finished. If Hopkins does indeed return, Jude Law will supposedly play the young Lecter (before he was caught) instead of trying to take 20 years off Hopkins' face with CGI effects. On a more promising note, after Red Dragon is released, the script for the fourth chapter in the Hannibal Lecter series will be written. Fortunately, Hopkins has agreed ahead of time to star as Doctor Lecter. He recently stated that he would be more than willing to portray Lecter for 10 more films, but that ""by then Hannibal would be too old and his teeth would be falling out from eating so much liver.""

1295237,1,B00003CXSO,"This is my explanation concerning ""Hannibal"". I totally dislike stories that are not plausible. Make no sense. Are just put together to justify another means.
Lecter came back to America to ""help"" Starling out with her dilemma regarding her suspension. Like he could really do anything. It makes more sense for him to have returned because of his ""love"" for her. Which he is. Now the infamous ""dinner scene"" was just an insult to my intelligence. First off, he ""fixes"" up Clarice and her bullet wound. Fine. Gave the appropriate drugs to help her pain and healing. She wakes up and finds, very nice and neat, on the desk all her stuff. Cuffs, money...etc. Too convienent. Lecter disconnects the phone because he knew Clarice's nature would be to try to call the police. Why did he not just rip the phone off the wall to ensure no outside intruders? He just disconnected it where a child could put it together very easily. Clarice make the call to the cops and that limits Lecter from having ""quality"" time with her, which he has been aching to have. Remember, he does love her in his own sick way. He literally has only minutes to be with her before he has to escape. WHY? He is so smart and in love with her. He would never let that happen where she would call for help. He wants to eat the guy's brain and talk with Clarice. If he is to convince her to love him, without the use of drugs, he needs TIME...period. Time he did not allow himself to have.
Now the cops are on their way. Time is short. He traps her with her hair and the fridge and ask if she could ever love him. The OBVIOUS answer is NO, NO, NO. Why would she? Dumb on Lecter's part. Makes no sense. He needed time and or drugs to get his way with Clarice. So he can hear the answer he longs for. If ""no"" is the obvious answer, maybe he never should of come to America, but I will talk about that in detail a little later in this writing. Let me go back a little now.
In ""The Silence of the Lambs"", the thing that I liked a lot about Jodie Foster's performance is that she was respectful of Lecter but, immensely afraid of him. Even between 6 to 10 inches of glass or steel bars separating them. She feared Lecter, which made me fear Lecter. Watch the movie again and see what I mean. Total fear yet controlled and respectful. I was scared everytime she spoke with him. In ""Hannibal"", Clarice is actually face to face with her worst nightmare and totally unafraid. This guy would in a second eat your face off and she attacks him like he is the bully neighbor you grew up with. She was drugged, I understand, but she was relentless the whole time. If a big dog chased me and I had a gun, I am brave because of the weapon yet I still would be afraid. The foreign cop guy in the beginning of the movie was afraid of him but, very greedy and it cost him his life. A great performance by him by the way. Clarice tried to get him with a knife and fist and then cuffs. She was relentless. It made me not afraid of Lecter. We all should be. He is capable of ANYTHING.
Finally, Lecter escapes by mere moments from the police, minus one left hand. We are talking moments. Seconds. He is on the 10 most wanted list. Everyone in America is after him. All the airports have his picture, the state line, the damn Mexican border. His likeness is out there plus the now distinguishing mark of a missing left hand. Yet, he is able to board a plane for overseas, no problem. I am to assume he is on the plane days later after the dinner scene. It's not like he was in hiding for a while to let the ""heat"" die down. No disguise and no left hand to the airport for a flight overseas. I defy you to walk across the street after robbing the local 7-11 and get you hand cut off and be able to board a plane for anywhere. STUPID, STUPID, STUPID. That part makes no sense. Even if he dressed like a priest, all people with cast, or splints, or missing left hands would be questioned by airport officials.
I like the beginning of the movie. It's after he arrived to America, the movie goes downhill. The writers take liberties and assume we must be on the slow side.
Here is an overview: 1) Lecter comes to America to help Clarice. (The writers needed a reason for Lecter to be in America to fight Gary Oldman's character, Mason Verger.) 2) Let's Clarice call the cops. (Writers needed a reason for him to flee the scene rapidly and escape for a another possible sequel.) 3) He asks Clarice if she could love him? ( This one the writers put there to explain the reason why he came for her. Bad choice as I have explained earlier. She is gonna say no. Why should she say yes? Hence, he never should of come to america or he should kidnap Clarice to have her do his bidding. ) 4) Clarice not being the least bit afraid. (Bad acting choice by Ms. Moore.) 5) Lecter's quick, ""one handed"" escape. (See #2) The writer's needed to wrap everything up nice and neat. ""Let's make our opening weekend $59,000,000 and run to the bank."" Whatever happened to solid stories and character motivations? By the way, him cutting off his hand is PROOF that he loved her. DEFINITIVE PROOF.) 6) All that extra gore was cool, but I believe that the writer's mentality is: ""People will talk about the excessive gore more than they will about the weak plot points the movie has."" There are many. Ask anyone about the movie and what is the first thing said? You know that answer. Gore, gore, brains and more gore.

1295241,5,B00003CXSO,"Hannibal is probably the most underrated sequels I have ever seen. The reason being is that everyone expected to see a sequel, when all they really saw in this film was a movie that was totally unique and stand on its own. I think many of the people who saw this movie and didn't like it, were simply disappointed by their own shallow sense of expectation. This time round it is Hannibal's film, and that being said, of course it is going to be much darker than the first two films, which were essentially great crime thrillers. But Hannibal is more of a drama and character study into the mind of a man, a witty cultured, romantic, sophistocated man, who just happens to be a homicidal sociopath, and his obsession and love for a woman(Clarice) who admires and respects him, but can never return the love he feels for her. I was also surprised by the epic feel the movie carried with it as well, almost on a very grand scale. I guess you make an epic film with any any type of subject matter, you don't need it to take place over a long period of time, or have it be about some great historical leader, or even include a war or a famous sinking ship, as long as you have the right script(intriguing and original storyline), the right actors(the acting all around was first rate), and excellent directing(kudos to Ridley Scott who gives an epic feel to all his movies). This film is destined to be a classic.  If not than surely a cult classic.  But in my mind I will always hold this film in the same high regard as its predecessor.",991526400,,1533,4.375438596491228

But let's face it, this is ""Hannibal Lecter"" did you think that it would be like a trip to Disney? The game of cat and mouse keeps the movie going, adding suspense. And as you know any movie with a depraved serial killer needs gore as well as art and Hopkins certainly provides that. I thought that Moore's acting was as dry as a cactus. She ment more time busting ""Drumgo"" than Hopkins eluding her with snares. Besides the dryness the only other flaw would be that Hopkins doesn't seem to have a point to his killings.

1295342,2,B00003CXSO,"Silence of the Lambs is a drama -- Hannibal is a horror film. There's the difference - plain and simple.
Harris is rumored to have resented the Hollywood call to create a sequel book that could be lifted and pasted into a film format. Well, I read Hannibal the book and really thought he'd gone too far. Clarice Starling isn't a literary character who will live forever such as Huckleberry Finn, but she was true and real. Hannibal's Clarice betrays the original book (and film).
No, this isn't what I thought it would be. It is too Lector-centric. The beauty of Silence of the Lambs was that Lector was a supporting player. Here, he has to carry the film. It is too much and too in your face.
The ending, although much more true to the Starling in the first film, is a gorefest.
I've watched some of the goriest films ever put out there and my stomach literally turned - I thought I was going to vomit. This is really some gross stuff.....Would I see it again? (Hate to admit it, but - yeah- probably.)

That was so central to his relationship with Clarice I cannot comprehend it's exclusion.  Also, was it me or did I see the boom mike enter into the picture from the top of the screen a few times?  Not a very good adaption.  Silence of the Lambs was so good because basically there wasn't a thing changed from Harris' book",990144000,,453,4.487804878048781
1295345,2,B00003CXSO,"I saw Hannibal in the theatre after reading the book and enduring the months of hype that preceeded it. I was trying to be open-minded about it.  I loved Silence of the Lambs and easily consider it to be one of the all time classics in film making.  I was thoroughly disappointed.
There are so many things to dislike about this movie, even if you take it out of the Silence of the Lambs category.  Julianne Moore as Clarice...well, I'll give her credit...those are some awfully big shoes to fill and while I think she did try, her performance was flat and mediocre at best.  The book, in case you haven't read it, essentially turns all of the characters into side-show freaks and that couldn't be removed from the script which underwent massive re-writes right up until production.  Director Ridley Scott does manage to provide atmosphere to this film but that doesn't detract from the pitiful storyline.
Gary Oldman plays the character of Mason Verger, whose only goal in life is to get revenge for what Hannibal did to him years before (which was basically remove his face).  Now, its says alot that Oldman's name doesn't appear in the credits...could it be embarrassment to be associated with this film?  Ray Liotta does a fair job of portraying the sexist, repulsive and crooked FBI agent, but the infamous dinner scene which was supposed to be scary and climatic falls flat and winds up being a joke.
Now, lets discuss Anthony Hopkins.  His portrayal of Hannibal Lecter in Silence of the Lambs was a mixture of pure evil and pure genius.  His acting ability in that film was exceptional and frankly, it made everyone sit up and take notice.  He was creepy and scary and somehow endearing all at once.  He was subtle and over the top and man, did he make the most sinister and unforgettable character of all time.  And then there was Anthony Hopkins in Hannibal.  What happened?  Hannibal the Cannibal went from being scary and stylish to being old and perverted.  Phrases like ""I ate his liver with some fava beans and a nice chianti, fphhh fphhh fphhh"" have now been replaced with ""Okey dokey""  WHAT?!!  He wasn't scary or sinister at all...he was just a pitiful old man wandering around in a library half the time and pretending to be threatening.  I felt sorry for him one minute and disgusted the next.  I kept wanting to yell ""KILL SOMEONE AND EAT THEIR LIVER OR SOMETHING.""  And the whole Hannibal vs. Clarice thing was transformed into something even sicker than liver-eating.  I kept waiting to see ""Lector Loves Clarice"" carved into a tree or something. It was far more fun to know that he respected her and felt the world was more interesting with her in it than this in-your-face twisted obsession.
Needless to say, I cannot recommend this film.  Please rent it before you shell out the cash for your own copy.  If you want to see a good, original and truly creepy film, buy Silence of the Lambs and leave this ... sequel on the shelf.",989971200,,2951,4.632692307692308

Hannibal cannot be compared to Silence because they are completely different. Silence was a crime thriller, while Hannibal was suspense and a little romance. The motivating forces are different, as well. In Hannibal, there is no race against the clock to save the day. The pace is very laid back, and the story unfolds in its own time.
Returning to the lead character, Anthony Hopkins delivers a performance as good as I've come to expect. In Silence, we didn't get to learn much about Hannibal, because he was behind the glass for most of the movie. But this is his movie, and Hopkins does it well. He's not as scary as he was in Silence, but that was ten years ago, and he's mellowed out a lot. Don't get me wrong ... he's still scary. But he can also be a lot of other things as well.
Julianne Moore replaced Jodie Foster, and to tell you the truth, I didn't miss her. Except for the scene with the recordings. But other than that, Julianne Moore was truly excellent. I had always liked her as an actress, but this movie made me truly respect her abilities.
The score by Hans Zimmer is absolutely beautiful. It's been a long time since I've bought a movie soundtrack, but this one was worth it. I really hope there's an isolated score on the DVD.

The two things that got me not to rate it 5 stars was:
1. The story did not cover how did Dr. Lecter manage to do everything (job, escape, travel ..etc.) without any assistance!
2. The scene at the dining table at the end of the film was a bit over exaggerated!

Nothing comes close to the eerie suspense and phychological drama of the the original -- and, in fact, it doesn't even seem that Hannibal is really trying to.  While Julianne Moore adopts the southern accent and tough female agent devoted to her work attitude of Starling, she doesn't play the role with the same subtleness or intelligence as Foster did.  Also, the relationship between the two isn't true to the original -- while in first Starling only fosters (no pun intended, har har) a trust with Lecter so to use him as a means to an end (and do her job), here it seems like they have forged an emotional bond and she wistfully and almost fondly remembers their time together.  Also here we see the ""he's a homicidal maniac but his heart is in the right place"" side of Hannibal  After all, he only kills people who are REALLY asking for it.  However, the movie can be enjoyed as what it is, a gory but entertaining romp - that is, if you are entertained by seeing people disemboweled, gored by ravenous pigs, and eaten alive.  Not only does the gross-out potential soar, but the cinematography is gorgeous (as you might expect from Ridley Scott) and Florence is an especially beautiful setting.

1295487,5,B00003CXSO,"Composing a sequel to the Oscar winning thriller 'Silence Of The Lambs' must have been as complicated as putting together 'Star Wars Episode 1"". Everything was going to be scrutinized and critqued harshly. The most important thing (to me at least) was that this film did not attempt to IMPROVE on the original... simply FOLLOW UP on it. The differences between SILENCE and HANNIBAL are wide and many. While SILENCE was firmly planted in the cerebral, HANNIBAL dwells deeply in the visceral. In director Ridley Scott's hands, Hannibal the Cannibal comes fully to life, showing us the monster behind the man in more graphic and unsettling detail that the first film only alluded to. Much has already been said about the violent content of the film and indeed it is graphic and gruesome, but it does occur in the context of the film and is not so much gratuitous as it is realistic. Even the film's outlandish conclusion (you'll never hear the expression 'brain food' again without shivering) seems possible. Those of you who have read the book will be pleasently surprised at what screenwriters David Mamet and Steven Zaillian have done here, choosing the source material carefully, excising the unnecessary, and coming up with a thrilling, frightening, funny, and wholly engrossing story (and thankfully changing the book's stupidly absurd ending). Scott bring the film to life, his direction reaching peaks of weightlessness. The story finds Lecter living, incognito, in Florence, Italy, trying to remain anonymous and live out the rest of his life. But he is being sought after by two people. One is Clarice Starling (here played by Julianne Moore) and the other is a former patient of Lector's, the impossibly rich and disgruntled Mason Verger (played by Gary Oldman, disgruntled because Lector once drugged him and ordered him to cut off his own face and feed it to his dogs - which he did, explaining 'it seemed like a good idea at the time). When a small-time Florentine police officer stumbles upon Lector's whereabouts, the chase begins. Ray Liotta turns in a fine performance as Paul Krendler, Starling's nemesis who recieves his comeuppance in a most memorable way. The whole project dazzles, with beautiful locations and heart-pounding score. Mason Verger, in and of himself, is a technical dazzler. A man with no lips, eyelids, or cheeks, he is horrible to look at, like a skull whose remaining flesh is slowly rotting off. The performance of Verger by Gary Oldman is the highlight of the film, never before has a character like this been brought to the screen. Was HANNIBAL worth the ten year wait? Absolutely. Is it better then SILENCE? No. It is different. It is a great thriller, with aspirations towards higher art. And it succeeds. It is a great as a sequel can get and serves the memory of SILENCE well.

I was pleasantly surprised therefore to find that two superb screenwriters, David Mamet and Steve Zaillion, were able to make the changes necessary to delete the parts of the book that didn't work while keeping the essence of Thomas Harris's exercise in dark malevolence.

Hannibal Lecter is the boogie man. He is the distillation of the nightmare villain...brilliant, cultured, educated, refined, erudite and thoroughly ruthless and bloodthirsty.  He is a creation of fiction, no more real than Dracula or Professor Moriarty.  He bears no resemblance to actual serial killers, who by and large are a drab, colorless, undistinguished lot.  Maybe that's why we are fascinated by Hannibal, all that talent and charm put to wicked uses.

Please note one thing, the book and the movie take place 10 years AFTER Silence of the Lambs.  Clarice Starling is not the wide-eyed innocent of Silence, but a street-tough working cop that is getting jerked around by the bureaucracy she has served faithfully and well. She is the only truly moral person in an unjust and cruel world.  It is that morality that ironically is her attraction for Hannibal. It would have been interesting to see, but I'm not sure Jody Foster could have brought that toughness to the role.  Julianne Moore did fine.

Anthony Hopkins owns the role.  As in Silence, it isn't him jumping out and going ""BOO!"" that makes us uneasy, it is the sinister stillness and self-posession of his Hannibal that frightens and chills.  All that evil nastiness contained within that can be unleashed at any time.  Hopkin's Hannibal is a marvelous creation of wit and charm, ridding the world of ""free range rude"".

Speaking of nastiness, the movie is wickedly funny with lots of nasty tidbits.  ""Okee dokee, here we go now"" as matter-of-factly as an usher or a tour guide, ""bowels in or out?"".

I don't know if Thomas Harris was trying to write a sequel so over-the-top lurid as a challenge to Hollywood ""I dare you to film this"" or if he looked around at a culture so harsh and unjust and cruel and crass that he decided to pour all of that into his book and pull a terrific stunt...make the cannibal the hero.  Regardless, he gave us a deliciously wicked read that Ridley Scott has transformed into a stylish and wicked movie.

Not for everyone's taste (pun intended) for sure, and not with the broad appeal of Silence, Hannibal exists on it's own terms and has it's own pleasures and rewards. The supporting performances are all fine, cinematography excellent. Finally, the material ultimately is not as emotionally engaging as Silence, and for that it just misses 5 stars...but another encounter with Clarice and Dr. Lecter is more interesting than most.",985305600,58,2762,4.890557939914163
1295489,3,B00003CXSO,"Remember that famous line from The Silence of the Lambs where Dr. Lecter steps up to what must be quadruple glazing, bullet and tooth proof glass, looks straight at the young Clarice Starling, and with the least possible inkling of smile, says: ""A census taker once tried to test me. I ate his liver, with some Fava beans and a nice Chianti. Hssss."" Immortal. Now, ten years later, comes the eagerly anticipated sequel. And the fundamental difference between Jonathan Demme's exemplar 1991 film and Ridley Scott's concoction is that Scott would have given you a sudden flashback, accompanied by a burst if undefined instruments on the soundtrack, detailing Hannibal's soggy meal. I'm not just postulating here. There is in fact a sequence where one of Lecter's vinegary victims, who has, unfortunately for himself and the world survived, describes a dinner he once shared with the articulate doctor. The actor playing the victim is the always magnetic Gary Oldman, and he can tell a story. But Scott doesn't give him that chance. Instead he cuts to an out of focus sequence where the narrator cuts off his own face, hands it to Lecter who in turn feeds it to the dog. Scott is after gasps of shock here. And he gets them. Hannibal goes for senses, whilst Silence went for the psyche. Hannibal is to SOTL what a one-night-stand is to a rewarding, complicated relationship. The former, however, is not entirely without appeal.
But let's stop the comparisons for a moment. It's true that they're inevitable, but Q-What is Hannibal, at least theoretically, on its own terms? A-A richly ornamented, superficially atmospheric, diminutively symbolic gorefest. Scott's direction here is as clinical, inert and visually striking as ever. The only sequence that seems to have been shot on a bright day is the opening five minute raid that sets the story on motion. Clarice, now played by Julianne Moore, who is no less attractive then Foster was in the first film, is in trouble for a drug bust that went badly wrong. The aforementioned rich vinegary faceless victim who has enough money ""to occasionally rent a senator from time to time"" sees her as a perfect bait for Lecter. He senses, correctly, that the good doctor is attracted to distress, and moreover, he detects the implicit gravitation that Lecter and Starling have for one another. From his mansion, in his state of the art technology filled room, he pulls his strings. And Clarice stays in distress.
Meanwhile, Lecter is hibernating in Florence, the city he once drew from memory in his underground cell. He is spotted and identified by an Italian police officer, (Giancarlo Giannini a long way from Seven Beauties), who, the script quickly implies, is in dire need of money to satisfy his young wife's expensive tastes. He reports the doctor's presence, and things are set in motion. Rather than using this officer's flawed benevolence as human center for his film, Scott typically relishes the opportunity to stage the operas he and his wife frequent; complete with painted faces and elaborate lighting. A small detail, that Amazon would probably consider a spoiler, also prevents him from being the center of the film.  It is Hopkins who must now carry the film. His lines, which were creepy behind the thick glass of Silence would be laughable out in the open. Sensing this, he underplays all his scenes. In the hands of another actor, a silly line like: ""I've been giving serious consideration to eating your wife"" would have been farcical. His understated performance salvages some of Lecter's enigma that was so pathetically shattered in Thomas Harris's 600 page laborious mediocrity of a novel (Harris actually went so far as to describe Lecter's tough childhood). On the other hand, notice how Moore speaks with a thick southern accent. Then compare that to how Foster spoke with a stilted one; trying to cover up her indigent upbringing. A character trait way too complex for Hannibal I'm afraid. It is unfair to criticize Moore; she does what she can with a one dimensional part.
Here I must admit that I approached Hannibal with low expectations. And I must admit that as such, I enjoyed it. Try to limit the comparisons to the earlier film such as Hans Zimmer's ""effects"" score versus Howard Shore's mournful revelatory one in Silence. (Last one I promise.) Scott, with the help of his Gladiator cinematographer, John Mathieson, has taken Harris's desperate, empty novel, and covered up with style and gore. He can not escape the fact that pure evil is infinitely more fascinating when it exists in the background, or on the sidelines as it did in Silence (I guess I lied), but less compelling up close, because then it has to be explained. Evil is a garnish that should be carefully applied lest it become ineffectual. My guess is Dr. Lecter would probably agree. This film, the gory, guilty pleasure that it is, would insult his sense of taste.",985219200,4,4912,4.910950661853189

She said it was simply rubbish and that I shouldn't waste my money. ""But of course, you'll see it anyway."" And by god was she right. First thing, WHY do American films have the NEED to make everyone in the world speak english (even aliens seem to speak it) I was kicking the chair in front of me during the whole time when Lecter was in Italy, and all the italians were walking around speaking english.
Okay, so that can be pardoned... I mean, subtitles don't make for a big box-office success, now do they? Let's comply to the norm, even if it makes the film look stupid.
Then there was nothing. At all. Just a build-up to something which never came. It feels as if they only had the dinner scene and thought ""ok, let's build fluff around this"". And if the ending in the book was so ""unadaptable"" by hollywood standards (okay, so it WAS a bit poo) why bother making the film?
Acting was good though. But there wasn't much to act with. No interaction, no chemistry. One dinner scene and Voila! the film was finished. END",985046400,6,1152,4.337962962962963

People like me who have read the book will be delighted by the screenplay and will be pleased with the small variations, which overall make the movie more exciting. This being the follow up to Thomas Harris` ""the silence of the lambs"" sees hannibal lecter in a much more sophisticated and calculating role, and even though the thought of him attacking is always possible, you will always prepare yourself for something just as disturbing as the ambulance scene from the silence of the lambs, where hannibal makes a mask of skin in order to escape from his cell. The way in which the movie refers to events from the silence of the lambs is also superbly done, as you watch it you will start to remember even the smallest details about scenes, and we even get to see some archive videos of hannibal, which we hear about in the silence of the lambs. Another nice touch is the way in which the character ""Barney"" was included. Barney, to recap, is one of the nurses who looked after hannibal in the dungeon, and although they weren't exactly friends we here of what he and hannibal had to say to each other and how clarice intrigued him. The gore level in this movie out of 5 would be 6. Although the movie is not a wall to wall bloodbath some of the scenes will make you feel very shocked and disturbed. I personally think this is the best movie ever made by far, the story is not shadowed by hannibal fans lust for blood and the suspense,drama, and mystery are perfectly evened out on screen. The amount we learn about hannibal also compliments the story perfectly and how is able to read clarice like a book.

1295493,3,B00003CXSO,"The talented Mr Ridley has created cinematic masterpieces, both visually and spiritually in which true heroes battled evil. The films left the viewer feeling inspired by the compassion and courage that human beings can show when facing terrifying threats. These compelling film masterpieces are ""Legend,"" in which Tom Cruise, in his first movie role, battled the Devil to save his betrothed;  ""Blade Runner,"" in which Harrison Ford battled his own evil; and ""Alien,"" in which Sigourney Weaver fought an alien dragon.  In all these morally lucid and visually captivating films the heroes won against the beasts.  Then apparently Ridley Scott decided to try to beat another beast (Hollywood) at its own commercial game by showing that Mr Scott, too, can draw the masses' dollars to the Colliseum of Hollywood's usual violent, inhumane fare. In ""Hannibal"" Mr Scott used his prodigious  talents to make a hero out of Hannibal, the Devil; and to muddy the message of the battle against evil by having the Devil save the heroine Clarice.

1295563,5,B00003CXSO,"I LOVED this movie, no doubt about it.  Completely different from Silence of the Lambs, and perhaps better.  Hannibal shows a more human quality, if possible for him, in this one.  He's as obsessed as ever with Clarice, and you can tell that he's been thinking every single day about her before this movie begins.  It is, however, very slow to start and Clarice should have played a larger role, I think.  She said very little throughout the movie, in my opinion.",984700800,,463,4.597560975609756
1295564,4,B00003CXSO,"I know by making that statement many people will automatically disagree with me. But, I can't help it, it's what I honestly feel. ""Silence Of The Lambs"" was indeed a good movie. One though, I must admit, I felt was given a little too much credit then it deserved. For instance, if I were to write a review for it, I would probably give the movie 3 stars. But, the trouble I had with ""Lambs"" was that it didn't completely carry me. I wasn't totally involved. ""Hannibal"" on the other hand I find to be a very gripping, intense, and entertaining movie. The only reason one might dislike this film is because it's a sequel. I too personally dislike many sequels, expect for the ones we all love, ""The Godfather part 2"", ""Empire Strikes Back""....ect. But there's something about this film that just had that certain something where I couldn't take my eyes off it. Ridley Scott, who is just coming off his ""Gladiator"" success, has made yet another wonderful film. I think everyone knows what this movie is about. Either they saw it already in theathers, or where told by friends. So, I won't go into detail about this film. I will only mention the strong points of the film. Lets start out with the acting. Anthony Hopkins is wonderful once again as Hannibal Lecter. There is a change in the character now. That change is for the better I feel. Lecter seems, and excuse me for the use of this word, more cool. He has more of a suave input on things now. And I personally like him this way. As for Julianne Moore, well. she's just great! We don't miss Foster at all in this movie. Moore delivers an excellent performance. I only wish her and Hopkins had more scenes together. But the ones they do have, hit the jackpot. They both seemed to play off each other very well in this movie. I was really surpised to see Giancarlo Giannini (Whom I personally rememeber seeing in Visconti's ""The Innocent""). He doesn't really have what I would dare call a strong character in the film. I mean, no one I know is going to see this movie for him. The one person who is amazing in this movie goes unbilled. He plays Mason Verger (I'm still debating if I should reveal in or not, oh, why not, everyone's seen the movie already) Gary Oldman is a real highpoint in this film. I couldn't even recongize him in this film. The next thing to talk about is the screenplay. I love David Mamet's writting style. I hope there are others out there who enjoy his work as much as I do. Ridley Scott, in my opinion does a wonderful job setting up things. He's a director whom I'm really taken notice to lately. Well, there you have it. Those are my reason to go see this movie. And, I know it's kinda early on in the year to say this, but, this movie could be one of the best films of the year!",984614400,5,2760,4.36116504854369

Harris' writing is so eloquent and beautiful that it is quite easy to get past the lack of plot-development (i.e. the last 30 pages: Beautifully written but the story was lost). The movie, however, was disappointing. What was captured in the book was lost in the movie. The performances in the movie were good, but it seemed to move much slower than the book.

And about the book business, Is a book and a movie even remotely the same thing? How can you even compare the two.  A hint to anyone who has yet to see Hannibal, before you go to the theatres to see the movie (which I would encourage you to do) completely forget anything you remeber from Silence of the Lambs or Hannibal the novel.

Hopkins, Moore, Liotta and Oldman were excellent, ESPECIALLY Julianne Moore. She is not Jodie Foster, and wasn't trying to be Jodie Foster, which was wonderful. In fact, I now prefer Julianne Moore to Jodie. She gave the character of Clarice a little more depth and made her a little more real. And one must keep in mind that the Starling in Hannibal is NOT the same Starling in SOTL.She has evolved in her career and been stalled, and the optimism is gone. I've seen the movie 5 times and will most likely see it at least once more. Some of the camera action was a little disconcerting, but overall Ridley Scott did a superb job. I loved the ending, but part of me wishes they had kept the original. Who are the studio execs to change Thomas' ending? Obviosly that's how he wanted the characters to end up. The book ends with Hannibal and Clarice as sort of vicious lovers...one would do good not to let them know they've been seen, because one is just as deadly as the other.

She has guts to go and take on a role that a great Oscar winning actress has done already. It was difficult at the beginning to actually place Moore in Foster's shoes but once the movie got rolling it never once occured to me that Foster was not there. Anthony Hopkins was as brilliant as ever. Sipping his Cianti, and wearing his slick suits. (may I mention his cool hats that he wore) In a way you want to fall in love with this man, he is warm, and may I add he looks ... good for 64... and in another was he totally terrifies you, this man kills people (rather gruesomely) and eats their internal organs. There is a mystique about Hannibal, people wish they could be like him, rich, intelligent, always a step ahead the the FBI, I know one thing- I wouldn't want to run into Hannibal into a dark alley- I would be safe only if I were Clarice. **The special effects in the ending scenes were absoluetly brilliant.**

I would have given this one star except for the acting of Sir Anthony.  He is a true actor but I was a little surprised that he took this role.
Silence of the Lambs was a psycological thriller --- it toyed with your mind and left much to our own horrific imaginations.  This left nothing.

1295647,3,B00003CXSO,"Hannibal, the hype after silence of teh Lambs finally compelled writer Thomas Harris to write Hannibal, a sequel of sorts to Silence of the Lambs.  I still remember the librarian's words when she checked out the book ""Three words: this-is-terrible!""  I still read it anyways, and the book seemed ok, until it got into the last 30 pages.  It turned into a cross-country road trip where you crashed and burned just 20 feet fro your destination.  But enough with the book ,we'll get on to that later.
Hannibal picks up 10 years after ""Silence of the Lambs.""  We now find Clarice Starling (Julianne Moore, nuff said), on the receiving end of a supposedly botched assignment.  Right now, her character and judgement are being bombarded and torn apart by the boys upstairs, notably her boss Paul Krendler (the moment this guy speaks, you will WANT to hate him).  Soon after, Clarice is called to the estate of Mason Verger, one of Hannibal Lecter's victims who was disfigured due to some major brainwork by Lecter.  Now horribly disfigured, Verger (Gary oldman sounding like a deformed Jimmy Stewart) wants to use Clarice to find Hannibal.
Meanwhile, in Italy, Hannibal Lecter has been living the good life, fine wine, breads and cheeses.  Assuming the name of Dr. Fell, he is poised to take ona  precedented seat on a board of art critics and the like.  However, a noted Italian inspector named Pazzi has come to suspect that the Dr may in fact be the American killer Hannibal.
While the film stayed true to the book, the deviation of 20% of the soruce material was somewhat of a good thing.  Jodie Foster backed out of both a huge paycheck and a changed ending as well.  Also rerouted was a sideplot involving Mason Verger's sister, a steroid-enhanced lesbian (I didn't quite buy this plotpoint either in the book), and the disfigurement of Verger as well (in the book, his eyes were exposed and needed to be rewetted every 5-10 seconds, and his mobility was even more limited).
Julianne Moore was proclaimed up to the task, but for some reason, it sounds like she's trying to be like Foster.  The way she handles herself around men in the FBI and life reminded me of Foster's take on Ellie Arroway in the film ""Contact.""  Here, Clarice seems always one step away form taking the decisive factor from ever losing her temper.  Just once, I wanted to see her breakdown in a fit of rage over the situation she is put in.
Hopkins has lost that mystery that surrounded that scene that became so memorable (I Ate his liver, with some faver beans, and a nice chianti...tphpthpthptphtphtphth!).  It was almost like Hopkins was told ""Here's $20million, now act like you're on vacation and got paid for nothing.  Don't get me wrong, Hopkins is a great actor, but it got somewhat annoying when his jokes had a bit of food humor to them (the audience loved them).
Probably the main complaint would have to be towards director Ridley Scott.  Up until Gladiator, i had never fully analyzed Scott's work on films.  Here, it seems to border between mood and trying to jumpstart you form 0-60 in 2 seconds.  There are Scott's trademark fast-camera shots that look like he shifted into overdrive while drunk, which leaves you wondering ""what the heck was that?""
Hannibal was good, but in a marginal B average rating scale.  Word now is that Hokins will reutrn as a yonge Hannibal in the novel that preceded his SOTL escape: ""Red Dragon.""  Once again, Hannibal will be behind bars, and may'be, Hopkins can make that terror behind the glass memorable again.",983232000,6,3533,4.7275693311582385
1295648,4,B00003CXSO,"One of the most disconcerting and unsettling criminals in the history of the cinema returns, in this long awaited sequel that finds him at large and free to pursue his own unique dining habits, in ""Hannibal,"" directed by Ridley Scott, and starring the inimitable Anthony Hopkins as the infamous gourmet, Dr. Hannibal Lecter.  The psychological games between Hannibal and everyone's favorite F.B. I. agent, Clarice Starling (Julianne Moore), that began in ""The Silence of the Lambs,"" continues here, though the tension that permeated ""Lambs"" has been significantly reduced, mainly due to the fact that this film lacks the immediacy of the original.  Though Hannibal's presence is still coldly threatening, he simply hasn't that same sense of urgency about him in his freedom that he did in captivity.  Seeing him in a ""normal"" setting is just much easier to assimilate than seeing him in that ominous isolation cell in which he resided when first introduced to an unsuspecting audience in 1991.  Probably the most chilling aspect of the film is the fact that someone as unsound as Hannibal can with such facility mask his true identity and compulsions and function so effectively within society.  It's like living among snakes without knowing which ones are venomous.  As a viewer, watching him interact with others-- knowing what we do about him-- is unnerving in itself; and when things begin to heat up and he at last shows his hand, it accords the audience some relief, in the same sense as having an illness finally diagnosed so that you can begin the treatment which precludes healing. And any respite from the ambiguous horrors of the story is welcomed, since Scott has done a superb job of creating an atmosphere and mood that poise the audience for the worst of the definite atrocities that are obviously coming.  As for the performance of Anthony Hopkins, it goes without saying at this point that he IS Hannibal Lecter.  In reviving the role that won him an Oscar for Best Actor, he brings that same icy countenance to the screen, that same reserved manner and eyes that reflect an emptiness of soul, all of which creates an illusion of invulnerability about him.  He presents a portrait of someone who is quite capable of perpetrating acts so dark that even shadows could not prevail upon them.  And taking into account the intelligence of Lecter, and the calculating methods he employs in carrying out his heinous deeds, it makes his presence all the more disquieting, more so even than that of Norman Bates (as played by Anthony Perkins) in Hitchcock's ""Psycho.""  If at all a case could be made that there is a weak link in the film, it would have to be the presence of Julianne Moore; but it would be a tough case to make inasmuch as Moore cannot be held directly responsible for it.  She simply had a nearly impossible task in attempting to fill the shoes of Jodie Foster, who made such an indelible impression as Clarice in ""Lambs,"" for which she received the Oscar for Best Actress.  Moore is a gifted actress, and her performance here is quite capably realized, but she doesn't quite capture that spark of intimacy that Foster's Clarice had with Hannibal, and consequently what passes between them does not evoke that same sense of dread and apprehension that was so vividly felt before.  Moore must be given credit, however, for a noble effort-- she does give a good performance here-- but taking over a part that Foster had made so intrinsically her own was a task that was just too insurmountable.  The supporting cast includes Giancarlo Giannini (Rinaldo Pazzi), Francesca Neri (Laura Pazzi), Gary Oldman (Mason Verger), Ray Liotta (Paul Krendler), Alex Corrado (Piero), Zeljko Ivanek (Dr. Doemling), Spike Jonze (Donnie) and Frankie Faison (Barney).  There are some fairly graphic scenes in this film, but with the exception of one near the end, they all play out very quickly; this is not, after all, merely another ""slice `em and dice `em"" slasher film.  Scott presents the story in such a way that the audience is psychologically and emotionally primed to see more than is actually shown; this is simply good filmmaking.  But be advised:  Some of it will be a bit too strong for some.  In the end, ""Hannibal,"" though falling short of the level of excellence of ""Silence of the Lambs,"" is still a film that makes the ten years or so it took to bring it to the screen worth the wait.  Not for the squeamish nor those with a fragile psyche, it is a film, however, for those who would sojourn into regions beyond the known; if it is the dark places you seek, this one should more than fit the bill.",983145600,3,4620,4.793450881612091
1295649,2,B00003CXSO,"Did Thomas Harris fall asleep writing this story or Ridley Scott did directing it? I certainly almost did watching it.
The movie starts with the hackneyed plot of our star agent bungling a drug bust through no fault of hers and then a pseudo hotshot investigator tries to take advantage of her situation. Lots of bullets, lots of bodies, our hero gets unjustifiably suspended and then takes matters into his own hands, or her hands in this case. Please, this corny theme has been used countless times in TV serials and cheap action movies - I am surprised Thomas Harris could even bring himself to write this!
Then comes the ridiculous deformed character in wheelchair who somehow is super rich and powerful and who has such a superb network of intelligence and runners that they can manage to catch Hannibal Lecter when for years the FBI fail despite him being on their ten most wanted list - Wah, am I watching a James Bond movie or what?!
The story moves at a tedious pace with Ridley Scott crafting his pseudo artistic style more suitable to a reflective drama then a crime thriller. And the suspense, if there is any, is as flat as walking through your neighbourhood grocery store.
There is even such cheap thrill as hungry pigs eating humans. And the climax where Hannibal does a haute cuisine of human brain, instead of being stomach churning as it was intended to be, actually looks delicious as watching a French master chef preparing his signature dish - it truly got me thinking of having pig brain for dinner, no kidding.
And yeah, you may half expect Hannibal Lecter to break out in ""Nighttime sharpens, heightens each sensation..."" when he bends over Clarice Starling.
This movie is a prime example of the kind of products we get when greedy Hollywood executives try to cash in on a successful film by pushing the creation of a sequel. In the process, quality becomes trash, and The Silence Of The Lambs has become The Gobbling Of The Pigs.

Getting to know the avuncular, behind-the-scenes Hannibal (who appeared to be living in peaceful exile as an art teacher before being sniffed out by the feds) didn't help much with the suspense either.
The film was not without texture and dimension. Its smart script, striking ambiance and mesmerizing chemistry between Hannibal and Clarice makes it more cerebrally satisfying than its predecessor.",982972800,,567,5.241758241758242
1295651,4,B00003CXSO,"I went to see this movie with my family and my cousin, and I was utterly surprised, when the movie was over, that everyone in our party loved it!
I, personally, totally enjoyed it. I agree that The Silence of the Lambs had much more plot and flowed more smoothly than Hannibal, but you have to admit that this is kind of a fun movie (yes! fun!). There was only one flaw that I thought took away from the movie: Irrelevency. There wasn't anything in it that was completely irrelevent, but the writers came pretty close. When I say it was ""irrelevent"", I'm not saying it to convey the thought of the movie being just a time-filler. No. what I mean is that there were a couple of things that happened toward the beginning of the movie that were never brought up again. One: What happened to Barney? Did they get him for selling the goods?
The movie's actors were something to brag on! Anthony Hopkins was, as usual, amazing. He played Dr. Lecter/Dr. Fell to a T. He made his character almost ""loveable"", which is good and bad at the same time. Good: it makes the movie more fun and suspensful to watch. I don't like watching movies where I HATE the main character. Bad: you find yourself feeling guilty for actually LIKING this evil thing that has no mercy for anyone, except Clarice. Julianne Moore was also VERY GOOD. Only one thing took away from her performance and made me want Jodie Foster back: the accent. In SotL, Foster kept her strong accent throughout the entire movie. In Hannibal, Moore, had it a little sometimes and none at other times. Maybe she shed it, finally...I don't know. You have to admit, though, Moore is one brave lady for attempting to fill Foster's shoes, and she does a great job of it!
I didn't find the violence and gore in this movie unbearable. I can think of many movies, along with Made-For-TV-Movies that had more violence and murder than this one. Saving Private Ryan comes to mind first.
One last note to those of you who were disgusted at Lecter's affection to Starling and Starling's respect to Lecter...don't read the book. You'll burn it after reading the ending! I loved it, but, then again, I found the bond between the two in the movie impressive.
All in all, this movie is one to see. Maybe not twice, but still open your mind up and buy a ticket!",982972800,7,2292,4.485645933014354
1295652,5,B00003CXSO,"Hannibal - was an interesting epic of a movie, the shere presence of adrenalyn , gore and great acting made this film a pleasure to watch. T he script was exellant and may of the phrases will be remembered as much as the T2 lyrics ""i'll be back"" but i will let the audience find that out 4 themselves. Anthony Hopkins is a star adding quirky, black comedy into places where he is tempting the audience to guess at what happens next. The first film was horrifying but the final 10 minutes of Hannibal was pure gore. The cliffhanger ending is leaving a sequal open so the fans may enjoy another Hopkins Masterpiece.",982886400,,613,4.433628318584071
1295653,4,B00003CXSO,"First off, one must approach Hannibal recognizing that he/she is seeing a sequel wholly different from its predecessor. Anthony Hopkins has said, and I think this sums up the difference quite nicely, that Hannibal is ""more tongue-in-cheek and more outrageous.""  Gone are the intense, close-up filled dialogue sequences, the murky and dark realistic backgrounds, the stoic faces and edgy silences that had set the mood of fear so effectively in the first film. This one is almost burlesque in its extravagant look- lush colors, rich interiors, so beautiful that the film is often more stunning than chilling.  Hopkins takes center stage and is utterly compelling, and Julianne Moore, who is without a doubt one of the best actresses working today, delivers what I feel is a wonderfully accurate performance, and she does so with a lot of integrity. No, the performance is not as juicy as Jodie's, but this is because the ROLE, like the movie, is not as juicy.  The layers of naivete and vulnerability that made Clarice such an interesting character in the first film have been appropriately shed during ten years of what must have been violent, hardening FBI work. To be sure, Hannibal is not the towering achievement in psychological terror that Silence was. I did not find this movie scary, largely because it has dropped the frightening ""second killer"" element present in Silence, focusing mainly on the title character who, especially in this film, is at times so charming and humorous that it is hard not to root for him.  In the end, this film works because I get a sense that everyone making it KNEW they were not making another Silence.  There is a lot of humor and even campy fun in this above average sequel.  Yes, there are some queasy parts, but I say that Hannibal ultimately offers two hours of great entertainment.",982886400,,1828,4.880645161290323
1295654,5,B00003CXSO,"Is it a watchable film? Depending on your stomach, yes. Well-made? Yes. For those of you who feared any director besides Demme would turn Lecter into Jason Vorhees, relax. You are in Ridley Scott's capable hands. It is certainly of a different fabric to SOTL, but then the same can be said of the respective novels; the dynamic is altogether different.
80% of the book's bare plot is skillfully recreated and the rest is hard to miss, given the pacing which I found more than adequate (sorry, you naysayers).
Strangely, though I was reminded of BEAUTY AND THE BEAST as a previous reviewer offered, I was more directly reminded of KING KONG, its thematic offspring. Like KONG, Lecter is a monster who resembles us and moves among us, but defies our analysis of his behaviour or our attempts to explain him (remember the census taker). In this I agree somewhat with those who disliked the book's provision of a background for the character. Lecter at his best is no victim! We no more need to know his motivations and origins than we need to know exactly how Kong, seemingly alone of his species, sprang from Skull Island. He's just THERE and he just IS. Yet like Kong, for all his ferocity, his devotion to the beauty of his choosing is beyond question and of a purity that many 'nobler' men might fail miserably to emulate. And yes, despite her terror and disgust, he will sacrifice for her. Lecter is unswayingly chivalrous where Clarice is concerned; no matter how she reacts with the plexiglass no longer between them, his true rage is reserved for the 'free-range rude', not her. Which is why despite its tweakings from the book, I found the ending satisfactory and consistent. The screenwriters could only either copy the book's ending or else send Starling, duty-bound, in the exact opposite direction. To their credit she does not simply rally righteously from her drugged state in time to plug Lecter in mid-bite. For what she does do - see the film!
I deliberately avoided spoilers to keep some suspense for the screening, and I was not disappointed. And as a gesture of compensation for those who were, Scott reminds us that Lecter is indeed an unqualifiable monster by taking a somewhat heart-warming scene from the book's middle, faithfully recreating it for his epilogue, then dirtying it down. This is the Lecter we were warned about in SOTL, engaged in sick self-amusement, just because. Of course, Dr Lecter might disagree and say his sole motive was to sway one soul from the perils of poor nutrition.",982800000,2,2518,4.777522935779817
1295655,4,B00003CXSO,"Besides the unrelentless kicking of my chair at the theater, this film was excellent.  I was most amazed by the single-light-source filming that Ridley Scott is known so well for.  It creates a required mood to accomodate a suspense-filled movie.  The direction appropriately accented obvious acting talent which was carried over from the first of these novel-to-movie films.  The plot which started a little shaky, ended up being far more unbelievable towards the end.  This is the only aspect of the movie that I can legitimately ridicule.  All other essential mediums were utilized maximally.  I would recommend this film to anyone who is a Ridley Scott fan or a fan of the writer.  I also encourage the movie-goers to pick up the novel, because a movie never does its justice.",982713600,,780,4.946153846153846
1295705,2,B00003CXSO,"A huge fan of the original, I ran to the theatre to view ""Hannibal"". I was prepared to take the film on its own terms, and not expect another ""Silence of the Lambs"".
Sadly, despite great acting and ambience, ""Hannibal"" is a muddled boring failure. Anthony Hopkins, Ray Liotta, and Julianne Moore, are not to be faulted for this mediocre mess, but rather the director and writers bear the blame.
The film's main flaw as I see it, is that the character Hannibal is celebrated instead of reviled. This film forgets that we are dealing with a serial killer! And the character of Clarice Starling is just as much of a mess. I haven't read the books, so I base my judgement solely on the two films. In the first film, we couldn't imagine Clarice having such respect for this sociopath. This film has Clarice fawning over the cannibal, and dreaming of her past glory.
Also, in the first film, the FBI was presented in a wholly positive light. In this film, the organization is corrupt and full of fools. This angle has been played to death in better more entertaining films.
The relentless gore and violence of ""Hannibal"" really sunk the film for me. I'm a longtime fan of horror, but this film goes too far. The famous dinner table scene was so sickening, it repulsed me for hours afterward.
The Gary Oldman character is completely uninteresting as well.
Ultimately, for all the good acting, ""Hannibal"" is a colossol flop, and it is sad, because it should have been great.",982713600,26,1466,4.620689655172414
1295706,4,B00003CXSO,"I have had to sit through so many reviews of this film that bad mouth it and add that it is awful compared to its predecessor.  Those people are getting it all wrong!  Sure, someone who is expecting to sit down in the theater and watch ""Silence of the Lambs Part 2"" should leave before the credits begin.  What director Ridley Scott, Anthony Hopkins, and the rest of the cast and crew did here was not try to make a replica of the Oscar winning ""Silence"" but to simply try and make a good flick.  And I have to say that they have! They have cut the umbilical cord from the first film and had a little fun.  Give them a break!  They took a confusing, muddled, way-too-brooding novel (no offense to Mr. Harris, NO ONE could be able to write a satisfying sequel the ""Silence"" novel) and the film makers produced a fast-paced thriller.
Anyone who hasn't seen Ridley Scott's stylistic achievements in films such as ""Blade Runner"" or ""Gladiator"" should have their heads examined.  He has taken that muddled novel I mentioned earlier and produced scenes of true tension that were pretty much lacking in the book. The scene of Hannibal and Starling trying to track each other through that crowded mall while communicating through cell phones was suspenseful enough to make me fidget. And it definetely reached the same level of intelligent back-and-forth dialogue between the two leads that gave the first film its chill.  I do believe that the film makers should have been brave enough to at least attempt to re-create the ending of the book (Mr. Scott - you could have made it gold) but I can appreciate the EWWWW, GROSS final scene.
Anthony Hopkins is wonderful as Dr. Hannibal Lecter once again.  Could anyone else play the role now?  And people should leave Julianne Moore alone. She deserves applause just for having the guts to take on a role made legendary by another actress.  I believed her as Clarice Starling almost immediately, and the differences between she and Jodie Foster faded away in my mind as the film progressed.
Not the legendary standard of ""Silence of the Lambs"" but altogether a movie that held my attention and made me glad I paid my eight bucks to see it.",982540800,12,2176,4.625974025974026
1295707,3,B00003CXSO,"Without considering this was the sequel to Silence Of The Lambs, this move was worth the price of admission.  Sadly however the characters around Hannibal Lecter act like predictible sheep and act far less intelligent to the point of turning the movie into more of a slasher movie instead of a suspense thriller...
Ok, the good points fall largely on Anthony Hopkins returning as Hannibal Lecter.  While the material he had to work with wasn't as good, he puts together an excelent performance we have come to expect from Hopkins in this role.  His role alone is worth the price of admission.
A big thumbs down for Ray Liotta character in this picture.  Actually I am more disappointed with how the FBI and other law enforcement agency operatives (Pazzi, Krendler, and Starling) are played like they are bumbling idiots on a Keystone Cops set or sex starved power/money hungry morons who would sell their souls for their own personal gain.  The interaction between Liotta's character and Agent Starling is ridiculous and detracts from the plot. I think if the relationship between these characters was more professional it would have lent even more mystique to Lecter as a diabolical psychopath.  Instead we seem to see Lecter ""escape"" only because law enforcement are a bunch of moron's bent on self promotion and greed.
A thumb sideways for Julianne Moore as Agent Clarice Starling.  Again, her character is inconsistent drifting from a highly intellgent FBI agent to helpless damsel in distress.  This probably isn't Moore's fault but I would have preferred to see the more cerebral Jodie Foster who seems to fit this role better and absolutely nailed her performance in SOTL.
In the bizarre catagory would have to be the unique methods Lecter disposes of those pursuing him.  If you are at all squemish you may want to leave for the last 15 minutes of the movie.  Also, Gary Oldman plays the sole survivor of a full on Lecter attack (or in this case suggestion) as Mason Verger.  This character is very interesting but too diabolical.  Toward the middle of the movie I was trying to figure out who Starling was trying to capture Verger or Lecter.  Oldman does a great job but I wish the character was a bit less hell-bent on revenge and more cerebral (see John Hurt's role as S.R. Hadden in Contact).  The plot would have been more suspenseful if Verger's intentions were more hidden and underhanded than they appear in the movie.  Indeed Verger would have then appeared more as an ally to the FBI instead of a mentally ill disfigured psychopath who is far less intellegent than Lecter himself.
So overall ""Hannibal"" is a decent movie for some Friday night entertainment but if you are expecting the same kind of suspense and intellegent character interaction you enjoyed in Silence Of The Lambs"" or ""Seven"" you will be disapointed.",982540800,2,2836,4.854771784232365
1295708,5,B00003CXSO,"I mean c'mon-I knew it was enevitable for some people and fans all over would not enjoy this picture. But it is truly art in the making. Ridley has this propensity to his craft to when he is behind the camera, almost anything is possible. Although many scenes i know were edited out of the final theatrical cut were not shown i am really excited for the directors cut. and i thought the gruesome ending with krendlers brain would have been a bit more graphic. I waws also dissapointed a bit because it was not true to the book's original ending, which the movie was probably all for the best because fans would not be able to accept the fact that Clarice and Hannibal ending up together dancing the to the tango in Buenos Aires. Butyou know what that means, with or without another novel by Thomas Harris, there has to be another movie in the Hannibal Lecter saga.
Comparing Hannibal to the past two films (manhunter, Sotl), Hannibal can not exceed the drama presented in silence of the lambs, but indeed exceeds Micheal Mann's version of Manhunter. Ya see I'm a really big fan of all the directors that helmed the Lecter saga-Black Rain and Blade Runner are two of my favorite movies, Mann's other films-Heat and Last of the Mohicans are without a doubt classics in the making. So I just hope when you put critique on this movie that you at least not only judge it on the fact that Jodie is gone and Julliane is in.

1295709,3,B00003CXSO,"I have read the three novels by Thomas Harris involving Hannibal Lecter; Red Dragon, The Silence of the Lambs and Hannibal.  I can definately say that Hannibal was the best. One of the best books I have ever read, in fact. The characters were very well defined and the plot had a good pace and fluidity to it. I was quite shocked by some of the scenes described in the book, such as the feeding of Mason's starved dogs. I found the controversial ending to be a great one, possibly not totally believable, but since when has that mattered? I was eagerly awaiting the film since last year, hoping for it to be nearly as good as the book.  When I saw the film, I wasn't sure what to think. Some scenes were brilliantly recreated, such as the fish market shoot out at the start. Others were disappointing. I was quite confused during the last five minutes of the film; has he chopped her hand off or not?! I loved the sheer depth of the characters such as Mason Verger in the book, which was barely looked at in the film. I particularly enjoyed my change of opinion of Hannibal whilst reading the book; I initially wanted him to be eaten by the pigs, who wouldn't?! This changed as his character was explored far more even than in The Silence. The cause of his cannibalism stemming from the eating of his sister at a young age seemed very understandable and caused me to feel sympathy for him. This side of Hannibal's life is not even skimmed in the film and the character remains quite shallow.  I was particularly disappointed by the total removal of Margot Verger, Mason's revengeful sister. The killing of Mason by Cordell in the movie seemed rushed and not properly thought through. Overall, a decent film. But, take my advice; read the book, it's far, far better than the film!",982540800,,1779,4.501547987616099
1295710,4,B00003CXSO,"As a fanatic of The Silence Of The Lambs, Hannibal Lecter and Thomas Harris' work, I went last night to see Hannibal, the long awaited sequel to The Silence Of The Lambs. I've been waiting for 10 years and the moment finally arrived. I felt excited, and I think I was not the only one, because a lot of theaters in Montreal, my hometown, showed extra presentation of the movie late at night! At the movie theater, the waiting line was bigger and bigger, and I just couldn't wait to go in! The moment finally arrived, the lights were down and the previews begun...people were already cheering on the edge of their seat! What do you think happened...
First of all, Hannibal Lecter was introduced to the public in the novel by Thomas Harris, Red Dragon, put to the wide screen in 1986 under the name of Manhunter. Hannibal was at the time played by Brian Cox. The movie did not do well, but Thomas Harris brought back Dr. Lecter in his next novel, The Silence Of The Lambs. The Silence Of The Lambs was a great novel, and a great movie by winning the big five at the Oscars in 1992. But still, I think Red Dragon (Manhunter) could have been a lot better! Hannibal Lecter became Anthony Hopkins, or should I say the opposite, because today, Anthony Hopkins is also Dr. Lecter. There were rumors at the time that Thomas Harris began to write Hannibal the same night the Silence began at the theaters. Now, nine years later, the novel Hannibal is put on the shelves for the avid fan of the genre. The critics were mixed. Too gory some said, others were claiming that Thomas Harris did not do justice to Clarice Starling, played wonderfully by Academy Award winner Jodie Foster in the Silence Of The Lambs. But as for me and millions of fans in the world, Thomas Harris did what we expected...an ending that  was needed to perpetuate the legend of Hannibal, the cannibal, Lecter!
The novel Hannibal brings us back where Silence Of The Lambs ended...Dr. Hannibal Lecter is on the loose, and when he learns that his favorite, F.B.I. agent Clarice Starling, is in trouble with Paul Krendler, he now feels the urge to come back from retirement to do what he does best! Mason Verger, the fourth victim of Hannibal Lecter, never forgot what he did to him in one of their session together, and now he seeks revenge. He will give 3,000,000$ to the person who will deliver him the good doctor. When  a police officer from Florence, named Pazzi,  hears about that...the hunt begins. Lecter has been in a state of hibernation in Florence, Italy and Pazzi finds him under the name of Dr. Fell. But Lecter is not stupid, and gets him! At that moment, he returns to America to find his love, Clarice. "" Is this Clarice?...Well, hello Clarice..."" At that same moment the theater was worked up and could not wait for the rest. Verger wanted now to capture Lecter and feed him to the wild pigs. We now approach the end of the movie and all the major characters are in the action, Hannibal, Clarice, Krendler, and Verger! A feast has begun.  Well, certainly not as powerful as The Silence Of The Lambs, Ridley Scott did a great job. After his success with Gladiator starring Russell Crowe, Ridley Scott brings us another time to celebrate the magic of the movies. While Silence was a psychological thriller, I would qualify Hannibal as a police drama. The picture was great.  We just have to look at the sunrise in Florence. He brought us an ""in your face"" action. Everything on the screen was big and dense. Verger's make-up was horrifying...it was almost hard to look at the screen while he was there. Some of us will miss Jodie Foster in the role of Clarice, and some of us will not. We have to remember that Jodie Foster turned down the role of Clarice because she was already involved in a movie in which she directed Russell Crowe. Rumors also claimed that Jodie did not like what Thomas Harris did to Starling...maybe we will never know the truth, but one thing is sure, Julianne Moore (The End Of The Affair, Boogie Nights) did a great job as F.B.I. agent Clarice Starling. Along side Academy Award winner Anthony Hopkins, Julianne Moore was up to the role. She brought us a more experienced and as much as ever idealist F.B.I. agent. Anthony Hopkins was equal to himself in the role of Dr. Lecter, but a little bit more insane that in Silence Of The Lambs. We see him wear a little bit more than a simple hospital garment, which brings his charm to a new level. In general, I would say that this movie is not for the easily scared people; those who read the book, know what I'm talking about, but for the avid fan of Hannibal Lecter, I don't think they will be disappointed...I did not! To where Silence Of The Lambs ended... ""Dr. Lecter....Dr. Lecter....Dr. Lecter....Dr. Lecter...."". The Silence is broken!",982454400,,4792,4.548088064889919
1295711,5,B00003CXSO,"I couldn't help myself.  I loved both novel and film.  I can't figure out why so many readers hated the ending to the book.  I think the only improvement to the movie would have been to add that element of the story rather than skirt around it.  When I ask friends about their favorite aspect of SOTL, they always say that it was the tension and weird sensuality between Starling and Lecter.  The two movies are NOT to be compared, however...SOTL was Clarice with Hannibal in the background, and Hannibal was all him, with her in the background.  This film needs to be admired for its beauty, however twisted it might be--Hannibal Lecter embodies what we all are, only to the extremes.  He is a genius, chivalrous and stylish, but also a complete monster, Freud's id unbridled.  According to the novel, Lecter only ""eats the rude""...Don't we all wish at some level that we could purge ourselves of our enemies so easily?  At any rate, this movie is worth watching for the wonderful Florence scenes, Hopkins' insanely beautiful hypnotic voice, and for the soundtrack, which is perfect for a dark night alone with a bottle of Chianti.",982368000,,1132,4.7055837563451774
1295712,4,B00003CXSO,"I strongly feel that Hannibal is one of the first cinematic masterpieces of 2001.  I know many people may disagree with me on that fact but I hold it to be true.  As an adaptation of the book the filmmakers did an incredible job.  The book was overly wrong, full of useless events rarely shocking and just plane flawed.  The secrete to the movies success is that they subtracted rather than added.  With the deleting of all of the unnecessary events of the book we get a much more interesting film.  Many call Silence of the Lambs the first movie; it isn't.  In fact Manhunter is the first Lecter film.  And in order to truly understand the progressive insanity of the series and Hannibal you need to see Manhunter.  With that said lets look at Hannibal the movie.  Hopkins this time around plays a much more ""human"" Hannibal Lecter which adds a creepy disturbing feel to the over all atmosphere of the film.  Juliann Moore is a nice fill in for Foster and in fact I felt that Moore played the part much more ""grown up"" than Foster could have.  Ridley Scott's direction is also a nice change and his artistic style brings Hannibal to life wonderfully.  Gary Oldman was also equally incredible that in his portrayal of Lecter's only living victim.  Now for what I feel people have wrong with the film; they were expecting another Silence of the Lambs, full of creepy dialogue and hidden gore.  It almost seems like people forgot Lecter escaped in Lambs, what is creepy and disturbing  about this movie is the idea of a monster like Hannibal is free as a bird to do and eat who ever he pleases.  Through out the series the amount of gore his increased from movie to movie so its only logical that Hannibal would be even more intense and in your face since in fact this is the last Lecter movie (the new one that is coming soon is a remake of Manhunter AKA Red Dragon).  I don't know what people's expectations of this movie was but I loved it and as a huge film fan with a collection that numbers in the thousands I know a good move from a bad movie and this is a good movie.  It just seems like everybody that wants to see a horror film now a days wants a movie like Scream instead of one that makes you sit and fester in your emotions and fears.",982281600,,2245,4.3405275779376495

Juliane Moore was great as Clarice Starling.  Jodie Foster would have been a bit better, but beggars can't be chosey.  If you have not seen this movie, go see it!  From my point of gruesome, it has 4 parts from what I think is gross.  It's still great!",982281600,,410,4.17948717948718
1295714,5,B00003CXSO,"I had read ""Hannibal"" as well as ""Silence of the Lambs"" and saw that movie before I saw this film. I loved all of them, so I was afraid to expect too much from this movie. Remember what happened to Star Wars: Episode I. Yet when I saw the movie on opening night, I was not the least bit disappointed with the film.
It has been ten years since Hannibal Lecter escaped from maximum security prison. He is living the life of a king in Florence, Italy, unaware of Mason Verger. Verger is Lecter's only surviving victim, and he wants revenge. He knows that the only way to capture Lecter is to present him with what interests him most, Clarice Starling. What follows is a suspenseful game of cat-and-mouse where only a few will survive. Director Ridley Scott makes the most of the beautiful city of Florence. The scenery and architechture are quite captivating. The haunting music score fits the movie perfectly. And let's not forget the story. Being based on Thomas Harris's extremely controversial novel put this movie into an unsteady light. Yet screenwriter Steve Zaillan managed to extract the choiciest bits from the book and set aside the bad. For example, the ending. Also added are scenes not included the book, including a very well choreographed action scene inside a busy train station.
All the characters in this movie gave very strong performances. Gary Oldman, buried somewhere underneath the latex, was the perfect choice for Hannibal-hater Mason Verger. He creeps you out, but in a different way than Lecter. Julianne Moore took the place of Jodie Foster as Special Agent Clarice Starling. Although some may disagree, I believe that Moore was a perfect choice for Clarice. Jodie Foster's Clarice was a timid, inexperienced trainee. The Clarice in this movie is a smart-mouthed, veteran agent. In my opinion, Moore had the better physique for this role.
And let's not forget everybody's favorite antihero, Hannibal Lecter. Anthony Hopkins is this movie. His talent to make you squirm just by looking at you is what made this movie so powerful. The mere whisper of his name sends chills through your body, and you are not sure whether to hate him or to root for him. Granted, this movie is not as good as its predecessor. It has much more gore then ""Silence of the Lambs"" and the movie is worse for it. However, Lecter is as chilling as always. ""Hannibal"" is overall an excellent film that will be remembered.",982281600,11,2419,4.7894736842105265
1295754,4,B00003CXSO,"I've read all three of the Thomas Harris novels that feature the notorious Hannibal Lecter. Each was a gripping read, but I remember saying to myself after reading ""Hannibal"" that they would never, EVER be able to put this book on film. The ending was so completely over-the-top that I was convinced Hollywood would simply want to avoid it altogether. Not only have I been proven wrong, but what director Ridley Scott has put to film is remarkably faithful to the book!
MY ADVICE is that if you enjoyed the absolutely brilliant ""Silence of the Lambs,"" please avoid drawing comparisons between it and ""Hannibal."" The two films are completely different in look and emotional tone. Whereas ""Silence"" revolved around the psychological game of cat-and-mouse between Hannibal Lecter and Clarice Starling, this new film is all Hannibal's show.
In retrospect, given the script and the changes made in the denouement of Harris' novel, Jodie Foster could probably kick herself for bowing out of the film. She says it would have been a betrayal of Clarice Starling's integrity for her to fall under Lecter's sway and become his mistress (or whatever). As it turns out, the ending of the film is sufficiently different that both Jodie Foster and the audience would be satisfied. Your loss, Jodie. As Clarice Starling, I thought Julianne Moore was perfectly adequate. Like her character is portrayed in the book, here she is a bit tougher and less ""green.""
What really impressed me most was the amount of material from the book Ridley Scott was able to cram into the movie and still keep it from becoming a mess. A few characters have been done away with, and Thomas Harris' explanation of WHY Hannibal Lecter has become this monster isn't tackled in the film. On the other hand, Lecter's dispatch of the Italian police detective Rinaldo Pazzi is so true to the book as to be absolute ghastly PERFECTION onscreen.
""Silence of the Lambs"" on one of those rare masterpieces of filmmaking that views can watch again and again and enjoy even more each time. I cannot say that for ""Hannibal;"" once or twice would probably be enough for me. But as a well-polished nugget of box office gold, ""Hannibal"" makes for a great time at the movies for anyone with a strong stomach.",982281600,,2252,4.83678756476684
1295755,2,B00003CXSO,"""Hannibal"" is everything that ""The Silence of the Lambs"" is not. So much does director Ridley Scott push the envelope with excessive bloodshed and drawn out sequences, that he loses touch with the magic of the first film, that which made the hairs on our neck stand up. The film is well acted and grand in scale, but without a familiar sense of dread and mystery to keep us intrigued, it chews itself to pieces.
The film kicks into gear with a chase sequence that looks like a deleted scene from Scott's earlier film, ""Gladiator,"" as Clarice Starling, now played by Julianne Moore, guns down a well-known drug ring operator. Her conduct in apprehending the suspect gets her demoted, and for a good hour or so of the movie, she will spend most of her time rummaging through files on Hannibal Lecter, reprised by Anthony Hopkins, who escaped from the law at the end of the previous film.
Her investigation leads her to Mason Verger, one of Lecter's victims, who is out for revenge. Verger is played by Gary Oldman, who is probably doomed to look like someone other than himself in any role he plays. His promise of a hefty reward catches the eye of an Italian police officer, who has spotted the famed cannibal masquerading as an art collector in Italy. He intends to turn Lecter in to Verger, ignoring the constant warnings from Starling and unaware of the real danger involved in meddling in Lecter's life.
The setup is good, but the execution and payoff are constantly tedious. ""The Silence of the Lambs"" had a low-key feel to it, something not quite so Hollywood or glossy. Director Jonathan Demme was able to evoke genuine suspense and tension through his photography, the fittingly creepy and downtrodden score of Howard Shore, and through the unconventional and frightening connection between its two lead characters, Lecter and Clarice.
Ridley Scott gives ""Hannibal"" all the guts (literally), grandeur and Hollywood glitz money can buy, something that this sequel does not need; in fact, it's a diminishing trait. His attention to cheap thrills with the use of violence and gory murders ruins the effect that Hannibal Lecter has on us. In the first film, he was frightening because of his ability to penetrate Clarice's mind, and through that, he found escape. Here, he is free to roam the Earth without worry, and witnessing his violence, I lost what little respect I had for him.
This attention to gloss diminishes any mystery or intensity we may have had in the beginning. Unlike ""Lambs,"" which kept its secrets until the blazing, bloody end, ""Hannibal"" has no secrets to reveal. Starling's hunt for Lecter turns into a cat-and-mouse hunt, which comes too little to late towards the film's end. Those of us who know the relationship these two character had in the beginning know full well that any filmmaker would sooner hang himself than deny us a final confrontation involving the two. This confrontation is the cheese atop the cracker, a finale that is more laughable than it is horrific, and further decimates the connection of these two muddled souls.
Anthony Hopkins still churns out a very kinetic performance as Lecter, employing wit and intelligence through his character. We may never feel anything for the new Lecter, but the old Hopkins has not changed a bit since his days behind a pane of glass. Julianne Moore takes over where Jodie Foster left off; her acting is wonderful. In fact, it's not really Foster that we miss, but the traits of her character from the previous outing. This Clarice is given little to go on, and doesn't grab the audience's attention quite like the past Clarice.
High hopes and high expectations abound, ""Hannibal"" became one of 2001's most anticipated films, and one of its biggest disappointments as well. It's mind-boggling to see just how much cinema has changed in the last decade; ""Lambs"" is genuine, while ""Hannibal"" is standard fodder.",982281600,,3893,4.873303167420814
1295756,3,B00003CXSO,"The pyschological edge of Hannibal Lecter has all but disappeared in this sequel.  What once was a character that was almost purely a mental figure has now been transformed into an escape artist with almost super-human ability.  That being said, this movie is not bad - but it really has lost it's edge.
Julianne Moore is not Jodie Foster - but she does a good job in my opinion.  Foster was a very tough act to follow.
I would still recommend this movie - but it is no blockbuster.",982195200,,482,4.393258426966292
1295757,2,B00003CXSO,"There's a special hall of fame where special movies go that are able to stand the test of time and still mesmerize audiences with their wit, their charm, and whatever else happens to make them up. ""The Silence of the Lambs"" is one such movie, taking us on a startling journey of psychological loneliness and despair, dug up in the subconscious of an FBI trainee by a former psychiatrist now under lock and key for his cannibalistic actions. This was a movie that took us to new levels, and made us use our imaginations, keeping us enthralled throughout.
""Hannibal"" stands on the outside of this hall, looking in, holding within its plot an intense array of aspirations for the high regard with which its predecessor was held. No such luck for this movie, though. The elements, along with a key actress, from the first film are left out, and will be sorely missed by those in the mood for the in-depth penetration into Hannibal's brain, which made the first movie so intelligent. This movie takes a different approach, heavily emphasizing style over substance, running almost two hours too long, and leaving nothing to the imagination in terms of Lecter's latest brutal crimes. I hope all the religious fanatics reading this review will excuse my language (like many will be reading this), but ""Hannibal"" raises so many expectations that it becomes the [worst] movie of 2001.
The story picks up tens years later after Hannibal's escape from his prison in Tennessee, leaving special agent Clarice Starling with one chilling phone call. Ten years later, Clarice Starling is a full agent, with the highest number of shot-and-killed criminals on her record. Soon, she finds herself paying a visit to Mason Verger, a wealthy sinister man with a severely scarred face. His story is one of that brings the premise of the movie's ""action"" to light: he was acquainted with Dr. Lecter many years earlier, and one night, while under the influence of an unknown substance, Lecter convinced him to cut his face off and feed it to his dogs. This explains, with rather graphic detail, the reason for his mutilation, which sends Clarice on the hunt again for the tormentor of her mind. Meanwhile, Lecter is in Florence, trying to make a splash as a museum curator, until a cop discovers his identity and throws his freedom into the balance. And rounding it all out is Verger, whose intentions are those of hostile revenge. What will ensue in the last hour and a half of this seemingly neverending movie are a combination of unneeded dialogue from Lecter, gore which is passed off as artsy, and a long, boring drone of plot that never quickens the heartbeat or keeps us enthralled at all.
Suffice it to say, the film had so much going for it, and promotional ads make it seem like even though it's not going to be ""The Silence of the Lambs II,"" it does not aspire to be, either. But the movie itself is something totally different, a force to be reckoned with, so to speak. What we must reckon with is the fact that Lecter is no longer a prisoner, which was the whole basis for the first movie. When he was in captivity, he was able to ignore his confines and always come across as witty, smart, and intelligent. Here, with his newfound freedom, it loses the luster it once had, and all we are left with is the witty dialogue of his expansive mind, which seems to hardly fill the halls of Florence much less the storyline of the movie. We are never really captivated by Lecter because he is on the loose, and the mystery of his life and crimes is diminished.
The absence of Jodie Foster is not really a negative of the movie, which is in no way speaking badly of her performance in ""Lambs."" The mere reason for my saying this is because the new addition, Julianna Moore, is left with little to build on. This film's Clarice is more astute, more provoking, and more forceful, which is exactly what ruins it for her. The entire first half of the movie is nothing but Clarice searching through archives in the FBI storage basement, looking at computer screens, making calls all over the world to find out the possible whereabouts of the now-famed killer. Perhaps the most ludicrous and unaffecting incident in the entire movie revolves around Clarice listening to the taped conversations she carried on with Lecter, which are reread with Julianna Moore taking over the part of Clarice. It is not only totally idiotic and ruinous, it makes the movie look stupid.
The running time is nothing short of a waste, making room for unneccessary subplots and twists that really add nothing to the story. Most of these scenes are the filmmakers attempts to make Hannibal's life and crime still appear as art on film, incorporating opera music and sweeping visual surroundings into the sequences to try and give it the feel of the scene from ""Lambs"" where Hannibal escapes from his cage. This scene was so astute for the way in which the large room was not the focus, but rather the action going on inside the cage. There seems to be a vast amount of space in which the characters dwell, which lessens the impact of the film, which also loses the less-commercial feel that ""Lambs"" achieved with its tight facial shots, constantly moving camera, which always underlined a sense of unease and tension. ""Hannibal"" has no tension, has no feeling, and ultimately has no impact once the final stages take place.
The intense amount of gore is a major put-off as well, lessening the amount of brain power required for the audience to use as well as forcing some to take early exits to the restroom. There is so much blood, so much gore, and so much mass bodily violence that it comes as a relief when Hannibal is not onscreen. This is perhaps the defining contrast between the two films: ""Lambs"" was superior enough to make us use our imaginations when Hannibal discussed his crimes with Clarice. Now, Clarice hears of his crimes from others affected by his crimes, and director Ridley Scott uses flashbacks and fast-moving shots to show us those crimes, old and new, essentially leaving nothing to the imagination of its viewers. And what about that last part with the festive dinner entree? UGH!
What is left to be desired is the acting, which never really makes us believe in the characters. Anthony Hopkins is one of two actors from the original to return (the other is the black security guard Barney, who shows up for a total of ten minutes selling off Lecter merchandise), and his character never reaches the ability and intelligence that he possessed in the first film. We end up wishing he would run away and never come back. Julianna Moore does what she can with her role, which is as relentlessly boring as her job in the film. Gary Oldman portrays the character of Mason Verger, who plays a somewhat intrical role, but the audience may become confused as to whether or not we should feel sympathy for him (come on, if he invited Anthony Hopkins over for some light S&M, would you pity him?).
This is not a movie for the light of stomach, nor is it a film for those who are interested in a strong and intelligent story. I cannot even go so far as to say that it is a film for die-hard aficionades of ""Lambs,"" because I happen to be one of them, and I found myself sinking lower and lower in my seat, just wanting it to end already. ""Hannibal"" does succeed in achieving one thing, though: it is able to go from the most anticipated movie of the year to the year's biggest disappointment. And that may or may not be an easy task.",982195200,2,7498,4.634109691960932
1295758,4,B00003CXSO,"This is an extremely well done thriller.  The acting is superb.  The story is fresh.  Well, as fresh as a sequel can be.  My only problem with the film is that they really pushed the edge with the gore in this movie.  You definitely do not want your children to see this film.  Some of my adult friends have had trouble with the scenes in this movie and I am sure children would have nightmares over it.

Anthony Hopkins loses some charm now that he's free from his jail cell, its just sorta weird I dunno. Juliann Moore did the best she could with a character who's integrity and dignity are stripped in every part of the movie, its not her fault her character is a complete Dunce who is nothing but the puppet of Mr. Lecture. The one thing that took away ALOT of stars for me. was the STUPIDEST ENDING EVER since The Blair Witch Project. Boy was that a stinker, the book ending was WAY WAY WAY better then this crap. I was totally dissapointed by it, and I can in no way forgive such a result for the characters. Had it been better, the movie would have gotten a better review from me. Yes at times it's entertaining, and contains loads of black comedy, with Mr. Lecture acting so cool and childlike just before he rips someones intestines out. Its not that gross, but beware the shock end scene for those who are squemish. It could have been better, once again Clerice Sterling loses everything you love about her from the first film, she's taken from strong and confident to nothing but the play thing of a whole buncha men who have it out for her.",982108800,5,1385,4.5

1295761,5,B00003CXSO,"For many movie fans, including myself it's been a long 10 years since our last Hannibal Lecter fix.  I can honestly say after many rumors and heresay, the wait for the Dr.'s return was worth it.  Anthony Hopkins comes back to haunt our nightmare's in the sequel (well not really) to THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS in HANNIBAL.  What a Valentine's date movie this turned out to be.  Admitedly I am a big Hopkins fan.  He could make the reading of the phone book scary.  In HANNIBAL he outdoes himself.  The humor of Dr. Lecter (yes, he does have a sense of humor) comes through in Hopkins delievery of some delicious one liners. It is a bit camp, but that makes it more fun.  Now, to the serious movie review:
I loved HANNIBAL.  Not everyone will.  Yes, there is violence and gore to the extreme but not any more than you would get in a dose of one of the many less prestigious 'slasher' films.  The performances are excellent all the way around.  Julianne Moore is on board this time as Clarice Starling (Jodie Foster bailed out - the original Clarice from ""Lambs""), Ridley Scott is the director (Jonathan Demme said 'no thank you' - the director from ""Lambs"") but not to worry.  Julianne does a wonderful performance and takes Clarice to places she probably never dreamed of.  It would have been nice to have Jodie back but after seeing Julianne, the detractors have fallen silent.  Ridley Scott's direction seems to come from a higher power.  One could imagine he's had the entire movie playing in his head since the got the nod yes to direct.  Other fabulous performances belong to Gary Oldman (uncredited) as the sadistic pedophile Mason Verger, Lecter's fourth victim.  I won't tell you more than that, it would spoil the surprise.  I did have a problem with Mason's character.  He was more demented in Thomas Harris' novel.  He almost pleads for sympathy (and may get some) in the movie.  True, the movie did follow the book to a point but this is the one place it fell a bit short.  The same can be said for Ray Liotta's character Paul Krendler a rival FBI agent from the Justice Department.  He too was more menacing in the book and was a stronger nemesis to Starling.  Also, in the book we know why he's after her.  Only through one line in the movie do we get the answer.  It would have been nice to explore that angle a bit also.  Still, Liotta did a fine job. I actually may be one of the few who enjoyed the book and its ending, as far out as it was. I had to read the book twice before it all sunk in. Still, the ending of the movie leaves you to wonder. One of the most impressive performances, besides Hopkins, is that of Giancarlo Giannini who played Det. Rinaldo Pazzi.  His performance was flawless especially when opposite Lecter.  The two played a cat and mouse game that was interesting, humorus, and terrifying.  Now, back to Sir Anthony.  Playing Lecter with a sense of purpose - to survive - and yet obsessed with Clarice, if that's the correct psychological term, to perfection, Hopkins seemed to glide across the screen with little effort.  We as the movie audience totally buy him as Lecter.  Even the inhuman things he's capable of and does, we seem to dismiss and forgive him for. We like him anyway.  In HANNIBAL, we finally get to see just a spark of his compassionate side.  He is a cannibal in love. The kiss was to die for.  But you didn't hear it from me.  If you are just a bit squeamish you may be watching parts of the movie through your hands but it's all in fun, really. There are some serious frights and jumps but there are just as much chuckles and nervous giggles.  Would I recommend HANNIBAL?  Absolutely.  But not if you're under 17 even though I know you've seen worse.  Go see the movie and enjoy the roller coaster ride we call the home of HANNIBAL.",982022400,6,3793,4.445573294629899
1295762,2,B00003CXSO,"Immensely disappointing sequel to The Silence of the Lambs and Manhunter shows some promise in the beginning but starts dragging it's feet and can never quite pick them up.  That's not to say it's a terrible movie, just confused.  It doesn't seem to know weather it wants to be a horror film, following the conventional format better suited for the Jason's and Freddy's of the world, or transend it's gere as Jonathan Demme did so beautifully with Silence.  You see, it's slow moving enough to have the feel of an art house flick but gruesome enough to have Clive Barker running for the exit.
Julianne Moore fills in the role vacated by Jodie Foster and does a nice job but being my favorite actress (check out Boogie Nights), I expected more from her.  She's paired opposite Hopkins as Hannibal whose the protagonist of this film.  At least Ridley Scott knew than nothing he could do would make us root against our favorite cannibal.  Hopkins is good as well, but still a long way from his Oscar-worthy performance ten years ago.
The plot involves one of the only two surviors of Hannibal before he was apprehended (Gary Oldman in the only true standout performance), who wants retribution.  Naturally, he breeds wild bore, training them to feed on his arch nemisis while he's still alive.  Standing in his way is Clarice, who after forming an unholy alliance with Hannibal is intent on bringing him in and thus saving his life.  The problem is that we never feel that he's in any real danger. After all, how could he? He's Hannibal Lector and with all the talk swirling about another sequel we know they're not going to kill this cash cow until he's churned out a few more.
But if I had to nail down the film's biggest flaw, I'd have to say that it's the fact that without the aspect of confinment Hannibal is no longer forced to rely on his intellect, instead falling back on macabre acts of violence.
All in all, it wasn't so bad it was worthy of all those bolting for the exit (and there were quite a few), but what a disappointment.",982022400,9,2038,4.561643835616438

Now, if Hopkins had declined, I would have NEVER gone to see the movie, it just wouldn't be Hannible Lectar with out him.

1295833,3,B00003CXSO,"This film can't help but draw comparisons to Silence of the Lambs, and Hannibal falls short if you do so, as many films would. It would have been difficult to craft a great film from the book Hannibal, and despite altering the ending slightly for the better, Ridley Scott, David Mamet, and Steven Zaillian have simply polished brass and tried to pass it off as gold. The film manages to shock the audience with sensational gore but fails to haunt. Unlike the first film, when Lecter has to think his way out of captivity, one never feels Lecter is in danger in Hannibal. Neither the buffoons at the FBI, nor Mason Verger (an unrecognizable Gary Oldman), or detective Pazzi ever truly seem to be a match for Lecter, who roams around the film with superhuman impunity. He doesn't even bother to disguise himself, despite being on the FBI Top Ten most wanted list. Also, the interplay between Clarice Starling and Lecter doesn't advance any more in this film. Their relationship is as we left them in Silence of the Lambs, two interesting personalities who find each other to be the only people more interesting than themselves.
Hannibal feels more like an epilogue to Silence of the Lambs than a film unto itself. No fault of Hopkins, Moore, or Scott, who are all professionals. It's still a lot of fun to follow Hopkins, the world's most sophisticated and witty cannibal. Moore plays a grim, single-minded Starling about as well as can be expected, and Scott conveys the beauty of Florence with his usual technical precision.

1295834,5,B00003CXSO,"I was really excited when i first heard about his movie. It had been awhile since i had seen Silence of the lambs so i refreshed my memory about a week before Hannibal came out. I have to admit that Hannibal is a lot slower than Silence but it is really good. Anthony Hopkins returns as Hannibal Lecter everyones favorite psycho.  His performance isn't as creepy as in silence but when watching the movie we do have to put into acount that this movie takes place ten years after Silence so Hannibal has had plenty of time to roam and loosen up. So Hannibal essentially as a charachter has mellowed out. Juliane Moore covers very badly for Jodie Foster. She didn't talk or act anything like Jodie Foster did, which is important because as much as it irritated me Clarice Starling isn't the same without her stupid southern accent. Now a lot of critics say that this movie is way to explicit in the death seens when we are shown bowels spilling on a sidewalk and when Ray Liottas brain is exposed and essentially dissected right before our eyes. But I think when people go to a Flick like this that is exactly what they want to see. I myself get really angry when gore is left to our imagination because unless your a doctor you really don't know how to imagine it.  And Finally the number one reason why this film gets a five can be summed up in two words GARY OLDMAN. Gary Oldman plays Mason Verger, Lecters fourth victim who was pyschotic enough to to cut his face off when Hannibal asked him too. Which isn't the most intelligent idea, but Verger clears it up when he tells us ""It sounded like a good idea at the time."" Gary has the best performance and possibly the best makeup. Hannibal is definatly one of the best sequels ever made.",981936000,,1738,4.411214953271028

Ridley Scott has made a great-looking movie--it's first-rate in terms of cinematography and production design. But the script falters badly in the second hour. The Florence sequence is riveting, and Hopkins has never been more menacing as Lecter. But there are huge plot holes in the final half after the good doctor returns to America (problems that weren't so obvious in Harris' novel, by the way.) Julianne Moore is plenty tough as Starling, but she misses the character's vulnerability (maybe she would be that hard and disillusioned after ten years, though.) Ray Liotta is a nasty hoot as Krendler. And The Unknown Actor is quite good as Mason Verger (check the end credits.) The ending is significantly changed from the book, of course: there Starling's fate was much too politically incorrect. The film version will be less upsetting to admirers of the character, although I salute Harris' courage in attempting such a brave, downbeat ending.

Hannibal, as played with sly malevolence by Anthony Hopkins (reprising his role in ""Silence"") is now living in Florence and working as a Renaissance scholar (Lecter the Lecturer) and being pursued by a Florentine police detective (Giancarlo Giannini) as well as the tenacious Clarice Starling (they couldn't afford Jodie Foster?) in Washington DC. A wealthy, horribly disfigured victim (Gary Oldman) is also determined to bring Hannibal to the wheel of Justice; and, needless to say, all their paths cross in the most gruesome ways. Clarice's superior (Ray Liotta), an unusually obnoxious character (you just KNOW he gonna get it), figures in the movie's climax in which he unwittingly eats ... well, let's not talk about it. That climax, as well as the scene in which Hannibal commits a vicious murder in full view of the Piazza della Signoria and then evidently simply takes the next train out of town will make the viewer wonder just how much advantage the screen writers were willing to take with our eagerness to be amused, no matter what.

1295837,4,B00003CXSO,"""Hannibal"" is probably the most anticipated movie to come out this year.  Perhaps the greates deviation is the lack of Jodie Foster as Special Agent Clarice Starling.  As a result, I was a little timid to go view this movie due to the lack of Foster.  Moreover, I read the book, and was appalled by the ending.
Anthony Hopkins does an EXCEPTIONAL job as Hannibal Lecter.  We were introduced to the abilities of Lecter in Silence of the Lambs, but in this movie, the audience gets to further delve into mind of this killer.  Perhpas the most disturbing thing is the tone of voice he uses when killing a person.  Again, Hopkins performance carries the intrigue of this movie.
Now to Julian Moore.  Let's make the most important fact first.....she is not Jodie Foster.  In this movie, Special Agent Starling has a fall from grace in the FBI following a major national incident.  As a result, Starling does not dominate the movie as she did in Silence of the Lambs.  Moore gives a brilliant attempt to fill Foster's shoes, but Starling is not the character that she was in Silence.  The emphasis is placed more on Lecter than Starling.
As for the ending.....yes it is gruesome, but no, it is not the ending that is found at the conclusion of the book.  Perhaps the audience would have been outraged to have the conclusion of the book be the conclusion of the movie.  But, be prepared for the worst.
For the movie, the character development was pretty good.  It should be noted that Ray Liotta does a good job, along with the person who plays Mason Verger.  As always, Lecter is unreal.  There is plent of action in this movie, but along with the action, comes the horrorific side of murder.  There is plent of ""blood and guts"" to get your stomach churning.  Ridley Scott does a great job of directing this movie.  Overall, the movie is great, but I personally think it lacks in comparison to Silence of the Lambs.",981936000,,1909,4.561764705882353

  Then, there is Mason Verger, a rich man, and Lecter's only surviving victim.  Now he wants revenge.  So he sets a three million dollar award for his capture.  Alive, of course, so he can torture him.  Combine him with Clarice, and what do you have?  One of the best movies ever
  ""Hannibal"", the third in the Lecter stories, is indeed the best of the bunch.  Anthony Hopkins is back, and replacing Clarice is Julianne Moore.  Strangely, she does a better job of portraying Clarice than Foster, as Clarice is a much different person now.  Anthony Hopkins shines as Hannibal, providing the role with what appears to be the most fun he has ever had.  We can tell he is having fun, simply by how easily he slips into the character.  The supporting cast is also very good, but the shining star of the supporting cast is the actor portraying Mason, though you can only find his name at the end credits.
  The main reason most people will not see this movie is because of the supposed violence.  While the  amount of gore ere is not as much as people have been saying.  Though what people are saying about the ending is true.
  So, did I like it?  Yes.  The script, is really well written (though not as good as the one in ""Silence"").  And the cast is amazing.  And for sheer enjoyment, this movie takes the cake.  While not in the same context as ""Silence"" (i.e., no serial killer), it still manages to amaze.  Also, sorry about the gore paragraph, is should say: ""While the amount of gore is high, it is not as high as people are saying.""  So enjoy, okey-dokey?",981849600,,2301,4.454106280193237

The long awaited sequel to ""Silence of the Lambs"" delivered all that I had hoped for, and then some.  The psychological horror is done well, and is consistent with its predecessor, without falling into the trap of simply being ""more of same"".  While this film is very different from ""Silence"" in several respects, the elements that made the first movie a box office smash are largely retained.
If you enjoyed ""Silence of the Lambs"", and always wondered what kinds of things Hannibal would do if he were not strapped down in a maximum security prison, you are going to enjoy this movie.  The majority of the film succeeds with dark, suggestive visuals, combined with superb acting (we get to see a lot of Anthony Hopkins), substantial foreshadowing (by Lector), and good storytelling.  The absence of Jodie Foster is disappointing, but does not prove to be the crippling factor that I expected it to be.
The film's climax is visually striking and not at all subtle.  It terrifies by violently manipulating deep-seated fears and taboos that will prove to be too much for many movie-goers.  To say any more would give away too much; you have been warned.
I have two pieces of advice for anyone who plans to see this movie.  First, if you are planning to eat, do it before the movie, not after.  Second, be prepared to see something that you have not seen before; something that may make you physically ill.",981849600,5,1535,4.7622641509433965
1295840,5,B00003CXSO,"When I first saw the preview for Hannibal, i knew i had to see this movie.  I went to the first showing on the first day it was at our theater, and let me tell you, it was extremely awesome!  I think it requires an intelligent movie lover to understand the hidden beauty behind this movie, but any Tommas Harris, Anthony Hopikins, or just plain Hannibal Lecter fan will definetly enjoy this very much.  It will be studied for many years as one of the greatest horror movies of all time.  It is very very true to the awsomeness of the novel.  GO AND SEE THIS MOVIE!",981849600,,564,4.233644859813084
1295841,1,B00003CXSO,"In the first film, Hannibal was sly and intelligent - and even intense and passionate - in this film he says lines like ""Okey dokey"" (and on more than one occasion). Hannibal is now played strictly for laughs. Ridley Scott has turned him into a modern day horror character (much like a Freddy Krueger).  This film is devoid of any suspense, character development, thin plot, and Julianne Moore is no Jodie Foster (Moore's southern accent comes and goes throughout the film).  The film also suffers from over length due to an extreme amount of pointless and - at times - silly dialogue. Simply put, majority of this film is boring. Extremely boring. Also, it seems that the critically acclaimed screenwriters (David Mamet & Steve Zaillan) lose focus on Hannibal Lechter's character and motivations in this film. And though this film is more of straight ahead horror film, it fails to be scary or even disturbing - but somewhat funny. Ray Liotta is wasted, and the ending of the film feels like a throw away scene from ""A Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" film. In closing, this film is a huge disappointment, and should be avoided at all costs. Horrible.",981849600,6,1144,4.802030456852792

7917906,5,B00003CXSO,"I can't say enough about this film, and to me, it's the pinnacle and true achievement of the Lector film series. Whilst one must still watch Silence and Red Dragon first in preparation, the audience does not truly come to know and understand Hannibal until this film - and it cannot be topped. I love how this film deepens the character of Lector to the point where he's now understood to have many more facets than just some sick-o psycho killer. In THIS film we come to understand that things in life are not as simple as black and white and that while we may have hated his character in the earlier editions, he is in fact much more complicated than such a simple judgement does justice to, and there will be that part inside us all that will come to like some of who he is. I'm glad that this film deviates from the novel and it speaks to the true genius of the director in providing the absolute perfect - in my opinion - telling of a story of a man who may be evil in some respects, however can still provide a certain righteous justice in others. I also don't mind that Foster didn't return for this installment and I applaud Julianne Moore for carrying this role flawlessly. In the end, I believe the viewer feels a sense of awe and satisfaction for everything that takes place in the film and dare I say that we end up rooting for Lector to more than a minimal extent. Powerful is a film that can sway the hearts and minds of the public to side with Hannibal Lector - and such...is this one.",1525910400,,1500,4.285211267605634

7917909,1,B00003CXSO,I remember when this came to theaters. I was so excited to see the sequel to Silence of the Lambs because the first movie was so good. I was very disappointed. I ended up actually walking out before it was over. I wouldve loved to have seen Jodie Foster reprise her role as Clarice but that wasn't this movies biggest flaw. After watching the movie I can certainly see why she was smart to pass on this one. The storyline and plot were predictable and weak at best. The gore was gratuitous and outweighed any intellectual elements that the film had or shouldve had. I recently decided to give it another try. I made it through the end this time but I still find this the worst of all the Lector based movies. Hannibal Rising was better than this one. Even Hannibal the show is better than this movie. I highly recommend it.,1521072000,,823,4.38562091503268
