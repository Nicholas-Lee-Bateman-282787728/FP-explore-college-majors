Just like 70/80's Hollywood stuff compared with that of today, they were down-to-earth, a lot less stylized and actors/actresses were a lot more natural, without too much makeups, weird hairdos and plastic surgeries.

""Prince's First Love"" is a pretty weak, a typical Korean mega-rich-vs-ordinary & boy-meets-girl & love triangle. It relies heavily on breezy Tae Cha-Hyon (just like in My Sassy Girl) and angel-like Sung Yu-Ri, so if they are not your cups of tea, you may find this pretty boring. If you are a guy however, there is one bonus feature rarely seen in other Korean TV dramas: Super-endowed Jenni Li plays the best friend of Sung Yu-Ri, and she frequently runs around with a skimpy bikini top as it struggles valiantly with its every single thread to keep her assets from finding daylight.

""Delicious Proposal"" is one of my favorite Korean dramas. A modern Romeo-and-Juliet story with the background of two feuding restaurant-owner families, which may sound fairly boring, but great casts without stupid evil characters, strong side stories and a lot of food topics make this drama a very good viewing. Four main characters are excellent: Son Ye-Jin is an innocent beauty but no pushover, So Yu-Jin is a plucky gamine but fragile, So Ji-Sop is a dirty businessman but lovelorn, Chong Jun is an everyday Joe with heroic flair. They are further surrounded by many other quirky side characters. ""Delicious Proposal"" does not break any new ground but it is a relaxing and honest feel-good drama.",1342224000,2,1569,4.984732824427481
