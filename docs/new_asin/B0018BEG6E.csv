3414311,5,B0018BEG6E,I have many firm videos and this is by far one of the best.  Kelsie is a great instrucor and motivating in a good way.  The moves aren't too complicated and you work so many muscles.  I would definately recommend this one!,1222473600,8,222,4.238095238095238
3414312,4,B0018BEG6E,"This one's tough from the get go, but Kelsie's infectious energy kept me wanting to work harder!  I used 8 lb weights and found them to be extremely challenging.  Her cueing seemed to get better as the workout goes on - parts of the warmup moved a little fast and caught me a little off guard.  She keeps in tempo throughout.  I have never done any kickboxing outside of some basic moves which appear in other FIRM workouts and would have found a tutorial helpful, although the moves were explained as they were introduced.  The workout was about 5 minutes shorter than the duration noted on the DVD case of 45 minutes.  I enjoyed this workout overall - I can't wait to work it into my rotation!",1221782400,4,695,4.433070866141732
3414313,4,B0018BEG6E,This workout is challanging-the toning segment is different. New different moves. I LOVE Chelsea!! She rocks! Very motivating in this workout-she really gets you going! I'm not a big fan of kickboxing (due to a permanent small tear in my LCL-it's hard to use my left leg for side kicks-so I avoid kick boxing)-but I modify my moves during the kickboxing. I actually used this one yesterday -but just the weights part-and then used the Sculpting Ball DVD workout right after. So a VERY good workout! The only thing I don't like is the backround. I miss the old firms where the statues and stage-like setting. This one has some new moves that will make things challanging. I used 7lbs and 8 lbs for the toning-and boy was it fun! A Keeper!

3414314,5,B0018BEG6E,"I just did this workout today for the first time. What a fun workout! My biggest complaint is that it's too short. I definitely could have kept going.

Kelsie is very motivating and she's good at cueing. She did kind of annoy me by saying ""I need you to do this..."" over and over. But it wasn't too bad. The camera work is kind of off a couple of times...focusing on the beginner moves while Kelsie is doing the advanced moves, very obvious transitions, etc. I suggest that you keep moving after each segment because there's a good 4-5 second pause between each one.

The kickboxing segments are really fun. Again, I wish there were more. I used 10 pound weights for the weight training segments and that was quite a challenge. I really liked the ab segement as well, and I'm not always a huge fan of those. I highly recommend this workout. I know it's going to become a regular in my rotation!",1220918400,6,894,4.412121212121212
3414315,4,B0018BEG6E,"This is a great workout.  Kelsie is a fantastic instructor.  The reason that I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars is the camera work and the editing.  As another review stated, it is very obvious when they transition from one segment to another and the scene before the cool down seemed cut-off.  Otherwise, you will enjoy this workout!",1220659200,4,330,4.5423728813559325
3414316,4,B0018BEG6E,"but what is there is very good.  Kelsie Daniels is a superb lead.  She cues extremely well.  The workout is just under 42 minutes.  The warmup is about 5 minutes in length and then the next 27 minutes alternates between sculpting using dumbells and kickbox/cardio combos.  I thought each section was well thought out but I wanted more KICKBOXING.  The workout concludes with floor work (pushups and abdominals) and then there is the stretch.
I thought the workout went by fairly quickly.  My only complaint other than I wanted more kickboxing is the editing.  The transistion between the different segments was noticable.  Also, one of my pet peeves is not showing the instructor when she is cueing a new move.  This happen twice.
All in all, I really liked the workout.",1220400000,24,770,4.809160305343512
3414317,5,B0018BEG6E,"I really love this workout.  It's one of the best ones I've seen from The Firm.  It makes you work hard and you can feel your muscles work and they'll remind you of their hard work even two days later (that's how I feel today - I've done it once now and can't wait for them to recover to try it again).
Kelsie is a terrific instructor; she's motivating and has endless amounts of energy.  Almost right from the start there are jabs and hooks to get your heart rate up, and right throughout the program, she teaches the cardio segments in add-on-style - that way you get used to a move and then add on other components to learn it faster.  When you do the toning, you use upper and lower body muscles at the same time to really burn fat and tone with maximum results.
Kelsie isn't annoying - she's very encouraging and that is a big help with this workout.  I really enjoy it and because it's under 45 minutes all up, it's easy to fit in the day and you're having fun that you almost don't feel like it's hard work.  The other great thing about this is you can modify it to your own level of fitness and capabilities.  I highly recommend this and will look out for other workouts from her.",1220400000,42,1188,4.20704845814978

3414333,5,B0018BEG6E,"I purchased this DVD to use in tandem with the ""Dangerous Curves"" DVD, and while the latter didn't work, this one sure did.  It's fast paced (even the warmup feels like a workout) and because you alternate between basic dance moves, kickboxing and strengh training, it's a nice all around workout.  I am sweating by the end and feel like I accomplished a good all over workout.",1428624000,,377,4.611940298507463

3414338,3,B0018BEG6E,Not what I expected. There is little to no instruction on proper body form for any of the movements. Other Firm workouts are more helpful for beginners and slowly go through a new move with proper body mechanics. It seemed this instructor moved along quickly and expected the audience to know what she was talking about when a new movement was thrown in the mix.,1405209600,3,362,4.584615384615384
3414339,5,B0018BEG6E,"Not too dancey, a little hip-hoppy rhythm, lots of kicking! I love that Kelsie isn't super sweet. She's just down to business but fun. It always feels like a good workout. About 30 minutes of cardio and then 15 minutes of push ups, abs, stretching. it's my go-to workout and I can always feel a difference if I stop for a week or so.",1393200000,2,333,4.21875
3414340,4,B0018BEG6E,"I really enjoyed this video.  I have been using the Firm DVD's for a year now and I figured that I was in pretty good shape to try this one.  Boy, did it really work my quads and gluts.

The only reason I did not give it 5 stars was because I wish it was longer.  The warm up and the kickboxing segments total about 32 minutes before the start of the floor work.  I wish they left off the floor work and made the kickboxing segment longer.",1391990400,,439,3.9431818181818183

3414343,5,B0018BEG6E,"This lives up to its title. I own many Firm DVDs and this one is another good one to add to my collection. It's fun with lots of energy. Adding weights keeps you toned. Good sweat! You do feel pumped after this workout. Kelsie is fabulous and her instructions are easy to follow. Good, strong workout. Highly recommend.",1386633600,,319,4.517241379310345
3414344,5,B0018BEG6E,"A few days a week I work out twice a day so I classify my workouts into tough (only workout I can do in a day) or moderate (can do this and another similar workout in same day).  This is one of the tougher but doable workout DVD's that I own.  I use 3-5 pounds throughout and can definitely feel the burn. I like the combination of kickboxing and weights.  It is certainly effective.  The workout goes fast which is a plus. Kelsey is great as an instructor.  Just my type pf personality, not too abrasive or perky. The ab routine at the end is also spot on.  I highly recommend this workout!",1382227200,2,591,4.185840707964601

3414349,4,B0018BEG6E,Another good workout from The Firm. Kelsie provides great direction along with an excellent stretch in the beginning and end. Not an extreme workout but you do sweat.,1366588800,,166,4.964285714285714

3414353,5,B0018BEG6E,"I've been using the firm for about 3 months now because I no longer had time to go to curves every day.  So far I've lost 7 lbs without really dieting at all.  I love this one, it is fun and easy to follow.  My other favorites are Total Body Time Crunch, Get Chiseled, and calorie explosion (but that one is a killer).  This is such a fun, thorough workout that I'm tempted to get stuck in a rut and use it every day.  Kelsie Daniels is a great instructor, not annoying at all.  This is good for intermediate level fitness, if you're a beginner this would be hard but with practice you will get it :)",1354320000,,600,4.085470085470085
3414354,4,B0018BEG6E,"I'm a long-time FIRM user- and have come to really appreciate how these workouts not only burn calories, but make you stronger.  I would say that this is a Intermediate-Advanced workout.  While Kelsie does a terrific job reminding you of proper form- the workout does move quickly so you need to have a good idea of what she means when cueing.

I've read some reviews that slam Kelsie for bad cueing.  Actually, she does a good job, but for the beginner or those not familiar with the FIRM I can see how someone might get frustrated.  However, if the routine was super easy to learn- I think boredom would set in very quickly so I love how the she mixes it up and keeps you moving!

The FIRM likes to go heavy on the squats and lunges- which can be hard on my knees.  But I'm happy to say that this one is one is not.  It is heavy on the dips, but those are a little easier for me.
I agree with another review that questions the abs portion.  You really have to be able to stay up on your toes during pushups and planks to maintain form.  I tried to stay on my knees and found it awkward to pull my knees up to my chest.  Knocked one star off for this- think another kickboxing or four-limb set would have been better use of this time.

All in all-  am happy with this workout- it's a good length (about 40 min without the bonus 5 min)and will definitely hold a spot in my DVD rotations.",1345593600,,1387,4.149812734082397
3414355,5,B0018BEG6E,"I tried this video for the first time last week and have been thinking about it ever since!  I have never said that about a workout before!

This was only my second experience ever with Kelsey as the instructor (also tried the 500 Calorie Workout last week and fell in love and wrote a glowing review), and she is now my absolute favorite and wish she had more.

The video was fun!  I loved the kickboxing moves, my heart rate was up instantly, but in my Zone 2 - Fat Burning Zone - so I knew I was going to have a great workout!  I really wish there were more videos out there by Kelsey, or ones that incorporated the fun kickboxing.

I was sweaty but smiling at the end, and since it was only 40 minutes long and my husband was home watching the kids, I decided to play it again!  I ended the second time still smiling!

I want to do the video again, but I always figure out my workouts a month in advance, print them on a calendar and follow them so that I can stick to working out, and so that I don't get bored with any of the videos.  Luckily this one comes up again in about a week!

I love the Firm videos because they let a person like - SAH and WAH mom - exercise, get strong and stay healthy, right in the comfort of my own home, which is awesome.  I either have to workout when my kids are sleeping (early morning or night time) but I find that I don't dread it when I'm doing these workouts - the treadmill I definitely dread!  I love all the Firm videos, especially this one!",1341878400,3,1489,4.061643835616438
3414356,4,B0018BEG6E,"The workout is pretty tough. Lots of low impact lunges with weights for great cardio/toning workout. The choreography is good, not boring and the workout is over before you know it. It doesn't have some of the dancy, boring movements like other Firm.

However, I took two stars off due to the instructor. Poor posture, poor que-ing and poor executiion of movements. Difficult to understand what she's saying and she also looks a bit scary looking to be honest.

Great workout but not my favorite instructor.",1339372800,,507,4.883720930232558

I have gained a lot of strength from doing this workout and my knees and hips no longer ache like they used to.  I can't do everything that the young women in the DVD do, so I modify some of the workout.  I pause the DVD after each segment and walk briskly around my house to catch my breath and I don't do the pushups.  I still can't do all of the ab work, but I'm getting better at it.  When I first started the workout, I thought I would never be able to learn all the moves, but with patience and practice, I did.  It is a great workout!

She moves really fast and some of the moves are a little awkward.  I will say that after finishing the workout, I was definately sweating and could tell I had really worked out.  I was hoping for a little more kickboxing and a little less lunging with weights.  Don't get me wrong, lunges are great but it seems to be more lunging than anything else.  Im hoping this dvd will grow on me once I can get all of the moves down correctly.  On a scale from 1 to 10 I would rate this workout at around a 6.",1309392000,10,626,4.12396694214876

Her moves are easy enough to follow but the quality isn't the same as the rest of the Firm workouts.  The studio is different-- it looks outdated and the other Firm workout girls aren't the experienced ones you usually see.  This DVD is okay, just doesn't have the overall great feeling I get from the rest of the Firm workouts.",1300320000,,474,4.413793103448276
3414369,4,B0018BEG6E,"This is an effective workout which incorporates cardio and strength training all inspired by kickboxing. As I said, it's well titled... there's lots of pumping (work with moderate weights), jumping (and kicking), and jabbing (punches, hooks and jabs galore). The workout starts with a warmup and then alternates between pure kickboxing inspired sections and sections with weights (she suggests moderate to heavy but 3 or 5 lbs works for me), the weight sections also managed to incorporate some kickbox moves to tie it all together. There's also some pushups and ab work as well as a (somewhat longer than usual, which I found nice) stretch section at the end. For the kickboxing sections without weights one is geared more toward actual boxing, i.e. punches and such, while another seems to focus more on kicking and jump kicks. I didn't think I was the type who would enjoy a kickbox workout AT ALL, but I enjoyed this more than I thought I would. I'd say it's more kickboxing inspired than a pure kickbox workout, as she adds in other types of exercises and incorporates weights. She starts each exercise with a basic option, and adds on changes to make it more difficult until you reach the full intended move. She also gives low impact alternatives throughout. I have bad knees but was surprised to make it through the workout without needing to modify steps or feeling any strain. The instructor gives good instructions and cuing throughout. It was somewhat intense but very easy to follow along.

I deducted one star because I do have some mixed feelings about the workout. Part of me felt like it went by quickly for a 55 minute workout. At one point we went to the floor for ab work and I thought we were halfway done only to find out that after the abs came the cool down and stretches. However, I could have enjoyed the whole workout more. I by no means hated it, but it still felt like exercise to me. I think part of why it seemed to go by so quickly is because I was constantly wondering how far into it I was and when it would be over. I think it's a very effective workout, and a nice change from the usual aerobic/weight work, but I just enjoy some other workout dvds more, so I felt like I couldn't give it the full 5 stars.

It is awesome -- it really gets your heart pumping --the moves are challenging, fun, and more importantly; safe.  So many kickboxing workouts incorporate unsafe moves that can really get you hurt; I know b/c I've been there.  This workout is great -- Kelsey's cueing is spot on and as always she is energetic and motivational.  I really really really (Firm are you listening??) would like to see more workouts from Kelsey b/c I love the intensity and can really feel the burn and she is just a great instructor.  The only negative about this workout is that I wish it had been about 15 minutes longer -- I'm an advanced exerciser so I really need tough challenges.  (beginners can do this workout too however) Other than that, don't hesitate to add this one to your collection -- You will love it, I promise!!",1291939200,5,984,4.52542372881356

Some of the sculpting moves are a little difficult for the beginner, but I thought that it was just right for the intermediate or advanced FIRMERS.

The transitions are very quick during the intervals, and Kelsie's moves require quite a bit of coordination. I can see how this workout would be very frustrating for people that are new to working out, the FIRM, or aerobics. I'm used to trying to keep up with the FIRM instructors for at least the first few times I do the workout, so that aspect didn't bother me.

There are a LOT of crunches during the cool down. Be ready for sore abs!

The kickboxing is fun! The sculpting is challenging! Kelsie is an excellent motivator. LOVED this workout!",1291593600,4,799,4.4520547945205475
3414372,3,B0018BEG6E,"At first, I hated this work out. I wasn't use to such high impact moves, but after time, and improving my balance, I really began to like it.
The kick boxing segments are fun and fairly easy to catch on to, especially if you are already familiar with Taebo.

You can't really heavy up on any of the exercises like you normally would in other firm videos, the movements are slightly quicker, and more awkward (so you have to focus on your stability), but I was surprised to feel it with such light weights.

There are definitely some great legs/butt exercises in this, the deeper and more concentrated you can get into them, the better it will feel.

HOWEVER, I have to stress that you be very careful with your form , some of these movements are a little awkward and can easily pull something, such as the ""curtsies"" that are executed fairly quickly, and the side lunges (which I have personally never been a fan of...)

Not bad for the newer Firm videos, but you still can't beat the old firm videos (with traditional weight lifting exercises that are simple and safe on your joints)",1291420800,3,1084,4.51530612244898

So far I've only done this workout twice but that is because I alternate between my pilates and Killer Legs & Thighs which Kelsie is also the instructor of. If you want a good sweat and to get in tip top shape fast I would recommend this one. You get the pleasure of working out just as hard as you would at a gym in the comfort of your home. This workout isn't easy at all. There were times that I had to take a break but overall it is a great workout and I will do it again and again.

I have a mild dextroscoliosis of the lumbar spine which can make me very very painful sometimes, but the stretching moves Kelsie teaches me help me a lot to sleep well after every workout.

I recommend this workout to everyone who is interested on learning new moves and keep it on.",1270080000,,569,4.2592592592592595
3414376,5,B0018BEG6E,"I am relatively new to The Firm, and have usually found their workouts to be too fast-paced (with moves that are too complicated for beginners if you're not familiar with them) for someone trying out their workouts for the first time.  Usually, I stop their workouts 20 minutes in simply because I've had enough of feeling totally lost.  Not with this one!  Kelsie Daniels hits it right on the mark, with moves that are easy to follow and do, and provides a nice combination of kickboxing and strength training.

What I loved:

1) Not shutting the DVD off in disgust because I couldn't keep up.  The combos during the kickboxing segments weren't complicated, and Kelsie does them enough times so you can actually get the hang of it.  The strength-training segments were just as easy to follow.
2) The fact that the segments using the weights kept my heart rate up, sometimes even higher than doing the kickboxing segments!
3) The fact that this workout is about 35 minutes long (The DVD says 45, but you really have 30 minutes of kickboxing/weight training, about 5 minutes of core/ab work, and then about 5 minutes of stretching).  I know some people didn't like this, but I get up early before I go to work (between 4 and 4:30 A.M.), and I need workouts where I can get a good workout in about 30-35 minutes.  This one delivers--there's no wasted time in the 35 minutes Kelsie has you working!

What I thought could have been better:

1) It could use a little more strength-training for the upper body; what I've noticed about Kelsie's workouts is that you do a LOT of lunges and lower body moves.
2) If you have never done kickboxing before (I started my weight-loss journey with Tae-Bo, so I am more than familiar), you will have a hard time keeping up.  She doesn't explain how to do any of the kickboxing moves; however, like I said, she does them enough times you can get the hang of them.

The good clearly outweighs the bad here; I felt FABULOUS after doing this workout, and felt like I got an intense workout, even after only 30 minutes.  If you're familiar with kickboxing and want a workout that will burn some serious calories--during and after the workout--you need to pick this one up.",1263081600,3,2201,4.581632653061225
3414377,5,B0018BEG6E,I love The Firm and the 500 Calorie workout is one of my all time favorites. I had very high hopes for this one but it just did not deliver. It was not kickboxy enough and the segments seemed to drag on and on.,1253491200,,210,3.7954545454545454

I am not sure why, but when I first tried the workout, I didn't think much of it. However, after using it a few times, it has become one of my favorites. While it is true that it is under 45 minutes--probably closer to 40, for the time that you are exercising, you are working hard. It pushes you to give that extra little bit. Kelsie's cueing is good and I like the music.",1244764800,2,474,4.053191489361702

3414383,4,B0018BEG6E,"Overall I liked this workout. It gets you sweating and your muscles burning. However, it does not last 45 minutes like the description says. The workout itself is around 30 to 35 minutes and then there is a lengthy stretching segment at the end. There seemed to be more time spent on squatting and lunging than kickboxing which is kind of waht it is billed as. The cardio should have been longer. I will use this dvd over and over but I will combine it with something else to get a long enough workout.",1243641600,2,502,4.351063829787234
3414384,5,B0018BEG6E,"it's fun, challenging and combines cardio, kickboxing and weight training.  moves are challenging but not too choreographed that an uncoordinated 40 something RA challenged woman can't pick them up after a few tries.  It's tough but pays off big time.

3414386,5,B0018BEG6E,"I thought there was nothing wrong with this workout. I had no problem following the cueing and was too busy working out to notice whether the set is 70s or whatever. The time just flew by, it felt more like 15 minutes than 40 which is still short. So take it for what it is; a short but good and challenging cardio & weights workout. What I like about Kelsie is that she doesn't fit the Stepford Wives mold like the rest of the Firm instructors (which are over-rehearsed robots with no personality). 5 stars for this one.",1239148800,,521,4.326530612244898
3414387,4,B0018BEG6E,"I really like Kelsie Daniels and this workout.  She alternates between sets of strength training and cardio intervals.  However, I felt that the cardio intervals could have been a bit longer with more emphasis on kickboxing.  She is not annoying or overly peppy and I have added this workout to my regular rotation of workout videos.",1228521600,,333,4.910714285714286
3414388,4,B0018BEG6E,This is a great workout! The only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is that I really think it needs more upper body work. The cardio is non stop and the warmup is better than a lot of workouts on other videos.  Beginners will probably want to start slow.,1225670400,2,254,3.980392156862745
3414389,3,B0018BEG6E,"I really wanted to like this workout, but it fell a little short.  First, it isn't 45 minutes.  Including the warm-up, it's under 40.  They must be adding on this strange 5 minute workout 'bonus' that is on the DVD.

They have a new set...it's really bad.  It looks like a 70s sitcom.

I found myself looking for a bit more direction.  The cueing was a bit off.  There were a few new moves which was good because I think The Firm is getting stale.

All in all, it's a shorter workout that will rev you up for a bit.  Maybe for a day when you want to take it easy.",1225670400,3,563,3.990990990990991
3414390,5,B0018BEG6E,"This new workout from The Firm is designed to be a fat-burning routine which blends kickboxing and sculpting intervals.  It is led by Kelsie Daniels, an instructor who has been a favorite of mine since back when she worked with Firm founder Anna Benson on the original FitPrime series.  The only equipment you need for the workout is a set of dumbbells; Kelsie cues you to use ""medium to heavy"" weights, but I found that sticking with 5-pound dumbbells throughout was challenging yet allowed me to focus mainly on the cardio benefits of the moves.  The workout is filmed on a nice, bright set, with big windows in the background overlooking what appears to be a building courtyard.  Kelsie is joined by four background exercisers, one of whom shows lower-impact modifications.

Kelsie gets you moving right away with an fast-paced warm-up that includes punches and active stretches; the warm-up lasts just under 5 minutes, and you are moving the entire time.  The first weighted series follows.  This segment begins with a squat/hammer curl combo, eventually adding a kick and then moving into a lunge with back kick.  The squat series is repeated on the other side and then the section finishes with some push-ups which include punches.  Next is the first kickboxing segment.  Kelsie builds up a fun combo in an add-on style; eventually, you'll do a jab-cross-hook-upper-knee-front kick-back kick-front kick, with the combination itself automatically moving you from one side to the other.  A second series using the weights follows, starting with dips and shoulder press, adding in a glute lift.  The next move is a crescent knee with opposite knee raise and side twist, and finally, there is a 1-legged squat with tricep kickback.  Then it's on to another fun kickboxing segment, starting with a side-to-side shuffle and three punches on each side.  After this, there's a dip with a knee lift that turns into an optional jump kick, and finally, a series of side kicks.  The final weights work follows, this time starting out with side lunges and triceps, eventually adding a roundhouse kick and then ending with a 1-armed row.  The segment concludes with another compound move, curtsy dips with side laterals, and a final balance move, side laterals while balancing on one leg.

At this point, the workout moves to the floor for push-ups and abs work.  I question the decision of The Firm to include this segment in a shorter workout like this one; I think it would've made much more sense to use the time for an additional kickboxing segment.  This section begins with a very short plank work series and then moves on to crunches, some of which were new an different, such as doing punches during bicycles.  Overall, however, this entire segment was less than 5 minutes long, so it didn't seem all that worthwhile.  The 5-minute cool-down is performed entirely on the floor, and it included some very nice stretches for the hamstrings, quads, and hips, all of which were definitely needed after the lower body emphasis of this workout.  The total time for the workout was about 42 minutes.  The workout also includes a bonus segment called ""Every Muscle in 5 Minutes!""  It's actually just under 6 minutes long, and it features Kelsie working out alone.  She opens with a fast-moving lunge from side-to-side, adding on several sets of push-ups.  Next comes a back dip with an overhead press and then a front lunge with a row; this is repeated to the other side.  Finally, she finishes off with a slow side-to-side lunge to stretch.  As might be expected, this short segment felt kind of rushed, and I'm not sure that it really added anything to the overall workout.

Despite my ambivalence towards the floorwork and bonus workout, I really enjoyed the main body of this workout!  Kelsie keeps you moving non-stop, so even the weighted segments felt more like cardio work to me.  I found the music to be much more fun and upbeat than in other Firm offerings, and I was also impressed that this DVD is actually chaptered, something you almost NEVER see from the FIRM!  Although there are a few things that I think could have been done better, overall, I'm very happy with this workout and know that I will use it often; my final rating would be 4 1/2 stars.",1225584000,19,4258,4.814305364511692

I love Kelsie, she's one of my favorite Firm instructors.  I'm fairly certain she's some kind of vampire, she doesn't age!  She looks as good as she did in the 80's ""mansion"" Firm workouts.  I am in awe of her arms.  Her cueing was excellent, and I like her enthusiasm.

The moves were simple enough to make it easy to follow along.  There is a modifier for beginners or those who want to keep it low impact.  Several sections use weights, Kelsie always states beforehand to use light-to-medium or medium-to-heavy.  I used light weight because it was my first time doing it and I wanted it to be more of a cardio workout.

My only complaint about the workout was there wasn't enough kickboxing.  The weight segments were good, but made it more of a circuit workout.  But it got my heart rate up and made me sweat, so I left feeling like I got a good workout.",1458086400,,1037,4.333333333333333
