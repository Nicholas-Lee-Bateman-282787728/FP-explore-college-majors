8229184,3,B000XPZTLM,"When it comes to the Bible being translated correctly, Martin Luther noted that there are contradictions in the Bible (See the book ""Martin Luther"" by Martin, Martin,  Penguine Publishing 375 Hudson Street, New York, N. Y. 2004).  Moreover the Hebrew texts differ from the Greek texts in many cases.  The text in the Dead Sea scrolls differ in many cases from the current versions of the Bible.  There were prophets among the Hebrews until the time that of the apostles.  After that, the Jews became corrupt and were scattered by Titus and the Romans.

5. ""Thus saith the LORD concerning the prophets that make my people err
6 Therefore night shall be unto you, that ye shall not have a vision; and it shall be dark unto you, that ye shall not divine; and the sun shall go down over the prophets, and the day shall be dark over them.
7 Then shall the seers be ashamed, and the diviners confounded: yea, they shall all cover their lips; for there is no answer of God
12 Therefore shall Zion for your sake be plowed as a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, "" (Bible, Micah 3:1-7 & 12).

After the time of Jesus apostles, the Jews were scattered by the Romans; Jerusalem did become heaps, and in not too many more years the Dark Ages occurred.  Darkness did cover the earth, and the sun did go down for the prophets.  Also, the Lord apparently foretold of the dark ages through Amos:

""Behold, the days come, saith the Lord GOD, that I will send a famine in the land, not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of the LORD:  And they shall wander from sea to sea, and from the north even to the east, they shall run to and fro to seek the word of the LORD, and shall not find it (Bible, Amos 8: 11-12)
""The Miracle of Manti"" was not written by a prophet.  It is apparent that the author wanders from sea to sea and from north to east seeking the word of the LORD, but he has not found it.  To see evidence for the Mormon Prophets, search on line for: Do Mormons Have Prophets"" and for ""Where in the Americas are the Lands of The Book of Mormon  You may find that the sun has come up for the prophets.  Keep and open mind. ""Seek and you shall find.  Knock and it shall be opened unto you.""

8229185,5,B000XPZTLM,"As a former 50 plus years member, I can say the LDS Mormon religion is totally FALSE and the teachers are taught regularly to brainwash children and new members little by little. Go to ANY of their churches worldwide and you'll see them get up to the pulpit and repeat ""I KNOW the church is true and Joseph Smith was a true prophet"". It's almost a hypnotic trance. Perhaps you'll hear them sign their favorite song about FALSE prophet, Joseph Smith-""Praise to the Man"". You will NEVER see a cross on or in any of their temples. And should you have the misfortune to have your child join them and get married, you as a parent, will NOT be allowed to attend your OWN CHILD'S wedding, if you do not become a member and be JUDGED by your bishop to get a recommend of you worthiness! Brigham Young stated NO ONE will get to heaven WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF JOSEPH SMITH! There are none so blind as he who WILL NOT see!",1292803200,4,910,4.296511627906977
