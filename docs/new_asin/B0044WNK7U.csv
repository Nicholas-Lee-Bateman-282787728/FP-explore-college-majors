you choose, so you can have the fireplace playing for as long as you like, without having to fuss with your dvd player. This dvd is of a better quality than the other brand of fireplace dvd which I purchased. This one's a really good buy & a pleasure to use.",1292457600,119,440,4.378048780487805
4261578,5,B0044WNK7U,"I received my copy today and was entranced by the picture quality and instrumental music. You can even choose between having music or no music but even when listening to the music you can still hear the crackling of the fire. It was amazing to watch the fire increase in size, I swore you could even feel the warmth of the flames. My cat sat in front of the tv for hours just watching the flames. This is a great DVD to have with family or for that romantic dinner.",1292457600,2,465,4.177777777777778

4261581,5,B0044WNK7U,I bought this at a trade show and my wife and I both love it.  We even have a fireplace and still put this on the TV for parties because the fireplace gets so warm when the room is full of people.,1290038400,5,196,3.6666666666666665
4261582,5,B0044WNK7U,Great video for entertaining or relaxing at home! The fireplace quality is very realistic with the option of natural crackling or music. This product beats all of the rest! I would recommend to anyone.,1289952000,5,201,4.9411764705882355

4261586,4,B0044WNK7U,My wife and I plug this DVD into our travel trailer on those nasty cold nights when you have to stay inside out of the weather. It's not blue ray but that didn't reduced the visual affect of having a fire in my trailer -  and not burning the whole place down. You can hear the snap and crackle of the wood logs as they flame and even the dull thump as burned logs tumble down. Nice background affect to read a good book by.,1517788800,,423,3.976470588235294
4261587,5,B0044WNK7U,Get to view a real fire -- without the ashes and smoke!,1517011200,,55,3.6666666666666665
4261588,2,B0044WNK7U,The fire doesn't look like the one on the front of the package.  The logs are stacked in a bizarre way that is visually unpleasing.  Also the crackling noise isn't realistic.  I don't enjoy this at all and will be ordering a different brand.,1517011200,,241,4.431818181818182
4261589,5,B0044WNK7U,Very happy with the video.  Like the bonus section of water running. Would recommend product,1516924800,,92,5.133333333333334

4261594,5,B0044WNK7U,"Among the George Ford catalog, this is Ford in his finest.  He really reaches for the heights with this one.  The production value, sound design and his cinematography really set him apart from more pedestrian fare.  The casting and plot twists (spoiler alert) are really top notch!  Who needs Netflix and Chill when you have George Ford!  The juxtaposition of George Ford against his European counterparts (National Firewood Burning Day film) really sets him apart.  There is a rather Kurasawa-esque montage towards the end that is very compelling.  High marks all around!",1514678400,,573,5.163043478260869
4261595,1,B0044WNK7U,theres a real annoying noise that comes from this fire almost like its a natural gas fire and not a real wood burning fire.  if I turn it down so I don't hear that noise then can't hear the natural crackling and popping of the wood.  Too bad,1514419200,,241,4.0
4261596,5,B0044WNK7U,I am  absolutely pleased with my purchase.  So realistic and relaxing. I bought one for my brother as well,1514073600,,106,4.526315789473684
4261597,4,B0044WNK7U,"This is exactly what it is advertised to be; a 90 video of a burning fireplace which will loop endlessly in a VCR player.  Not rocket science or great entertainment, but diverting background for sipping eggnog and pretending it's cold outside in Houston, Texas.  At $10 I thought it was pushing the price envelope a tad - that's I didn't give a fifth star.  Bonus points though for very timely delivery during the week before Christmas",1513814400,,435,4.697368421052632

4261601,5,B0044WNK7U,"Best fireplace dvd I have seen, and I have a few that are so, so. Now, finally my search is done! It is so real sounding and looking. I also love that I can watch with or without the very relaxing music. I liked it so much, I purchased another one for a gift.",1513382400,2,259,3.814814814814815
4261602,5,B0044WNK7U,Crackling fire and sounds are nice.  The second option is crackling fire with music.  The music is a selection of very nice instrumentals that would be fine in any season for entertaining.  It is a 60 minute dvd of an actual wood fire as it burns.  So fun. I love it.  Would love to have it as a screen saver on my computer ...,1513296000,,327,4.046875
4261603,5,B0044WNK7U,"Very nice, good fire sound track. Image is close to fire. So it looks like your tv is a fire boxno a movie of a fireplace.",1513209600,,122,3.730769230769231

4261608,5,B0044WNK7U,My hubby and I loved this!  We have real fires on our patio throughout months of year except Winter.  We have decided this is our perfect answer for those months. Thank you! My hubby kept saying he felt it was so Real he was feeling the heat and smoke.,1512864000,2,252,4.122448979591836
4261609,5,B0044WNK7U,"Terrific video,  I like that there are three options - fire, fire with music and the bonus of the mountain stream.  The fire ones seem to warm up the room.  The fact that there is no mantel etc in the frame is great.  If I had a real fireplace, I'd be tempted to install a tv in the are just to have an easy fire!

Looking forward to sharing this at my upcoming holiday events.",1512864000,,377,3.973333333333333

4261612,5,B0044WNK7U,"This DVD fireplace is awesome.  I love it.
 The crackling sounds really make the deal .

The next best thing to a real fireplace I turn it on every night when I get home from work and its the perfect backdrop .",1512604800,,210,3.9523809523809526
4261613,5,B0044WNK7U,"Very nice rendering of burning logs in fire place. Shows lower flames at beginning,  then gradually  increasing flames consuming the logs with more glowing embers falling below visible fire grate towards the end. Nice amount of crackling sounds,  not too much, just right.
We put a 32"" flat screen TV into the fire place. Now we have pleasant ambiance fir the occasion.  No smoke, environmentally friendly,  no smelly mess. Yeah, we know, it's not the real thing, but who wants to mess with ashes and smells in a new house. Very pleased.",1512086400,2,537,4.793478260869565
4261614,4,B0044WNK7U,Bought it as a pre-holiday gift for a friend who mentioned wanting one and she loved it.,1511827200,,88,4.235294117647059
4261615,5,B0044WNK7U,"Great for a relaxing, cozy evening. My family and I come back to this video again and again when we want to warm up with a mug of hot chocolate.",1511568000,,144,3.8333333333333335
4261616,5,B0044WNK7U,"So far, this one sets the gold standard for fireplace videos.  The video lasts an hour and burns pleasantly the whole time (starts out with a bit more flame of course, but looks natural, then more coals develop and the flame burns in a more relaxed way.)  At least the fireplace looks like a fireplace; not not the most beautiful fireplace, but it is simple, and undistracting, and glows with the golden light of the fire.

This fire is more of a golden yellow than orange (some people may prefer more orange), but it looks natural to me, and the coals are nice.

The audio is great, with the crackles and pops very clear and crisp and natural.

Other fireplace videos I have seen have suffered from really poor composition, ugly backgrounds, and cheesy, excessively orange tints.

I view this on a 24"" screen, so you may or may not like it on a huge screen if that is what you have.",1511481600,,883,4.419753086419753

4261619,5,B0044WNK7U,"Its so realistic and superbly framed, photographed and presented (and, the soundtrack is so vivid and clear) that when the logs started spitting sparks, I felt compelled to check the floor for burn marks.

4261676,5,B0044WNK7U,"Some people have noted that the crackling sounds are loud.  I think they're about right but either way, nothing your volume button can't solve.  I haven't listened to the version with music (you have the option of with or without).  The bonus stream video has fairly generic instrumental music - doesn't do much for me.  But this is exactly what I wanted - a crackling fire video.  You used to be able to find TV channels that would show a yule log on Christmas morning but it's getting harder to do so now.  This is a perfect replacement.",1482883200,2,539,4.448979591836735

I originally watched it through Netflix, but recently moved back to Virginia and the Internet service is not as good here. I have to save some bandwidth by playing the program on DVD, which is actually much clearer and I don't have to wait for it to buffer frequently. The program restarts automatically as soon as it ends, which is a nice feature. It also comes with a bonus track (mountain stream, I believe) which will be nice in the spring/summer.

4261779,5,B0044WNK7U,A bit hokey but its fun. We recently moved and I was missing our wood fireplace. Our place is too small for even a miniature faux fireplace so this is a quirky and silly solution. It makes me smile.,1475452800,,198,4.102564102564102

The first time I watched it late at night I curled up on the sofa and fell asleep because it was so relaxing. It was better than the real thing because there's no mess to clean up, no added expenses like chimney to clean or wood to buy, no smoke inhalation, and no danger of burning the house or anything. There was no advertising on mine. When it finished playing there was only a brief pause and it started all over again repeatedly. It's perfect to warm up that cold night or to gather around like a campfire. It is so nice to play when company gathers especially for Christmas for that warm cozy feeling. People can still have conversations but have something to watch. Love this DVD so much!!!!",1451088000,3,885,4.469135802469136
4261857,5,B0044WNK7U,This makes me really think about what it means to be a fireplace. It also brings to light the inevitablity of things catching on fire. I wonder if they have any videos of paint drying. I would watch that.,1451088000,2,204,4.256410256410256

4261860,5,B0044WNK7U,Absolutely perfect. Love it. Starts out with fresh logs just  as a real fire does and as it progresses the logs catch on fire and burn up.  It is so realistic you can tell it is a real picture of a real fireplace fire. As you listen to the crackling of the wood burning and watch the flames grow and consume the logs you can almost feel the heat. There are no pop up ads to distract you and when it comes to the end it just starts over.  Just curle up put on some soft music and grab your favorite book.  You will love it too.,1450569600,3,526,3.8878504672897196

4261891,4,B0044WNK7U,"One of my earliest memories was when the Captain Kangaroo show used to run what is nowadays called a ""video"" during the Holidays of some easy listening vocal group (it wasn't Mitch Miller--maybe Ray Conniff?) singing Mel Torme's ""The Christmas Song""--you know, ""chestnuts roasting on an open fire""--and a continuously burning fireplace like the one featured on this disc was the visual part of it. Unfortunately, back then I'd never seen a fireplace--we never had a house fancy enough to have one--the andirons made me think of a brass bed. And I'd heard all the public service warnings aimed at grownups about smoking in bed--both of my parents were smokers and they had a brass bed. So you can imagine the conclusions I jumped to about that scene, music notwithstanding. So it took an explanation from Mommy to get me to stop whining.",1444608000,,836,4.853146853146853

Sadly most people don't have fire places anymore.  With a descent sized TV, this is a close 2nd to the real thing.

Take the time to watch the flames and listen to the crackling of the burning wood.  Watch the flames start in the center of fire place.  As they spread throughout the logs, and consume the boards.  The fire slowly grows to a roaring blaze and then fades down to a small blaze and hot coals.

Amazon instant video, DVD, or Netflix, many find this program relaxing and beneficial.",1442707200,,627,4.594594594594595

We have received numerous compliments, biggest praise is when people in pain actually drop off to sleep while in our waiting room, and nurses have to gently awaken them when it's time to see the doctor. This in a clinic where the wait is usually minimal!  I also played it during a staff lunch, it created an ambiance people were reluctant to leave.

It really looks like a fire in a fireplace instead of a video of a fire in a fireplace.

This version has no music overplayed - it is only the sound of the crackling wood.  We prefered this natural sound SOOO much over the other two versions that had music playing over them.

Three things that would make it better:

1: Take away the opening theme music during the credits.  It is disturbing to have music break up the conversation in the room every time one re-starts the video.

2: Do the credits over the first minute or so of the actual fire.  The current opening credits are against a black background which disrupts the imagery when re-starting the video.

3: Amazon - offer a ""loop"" or automatic replay option for videos like this one.",1417305600,2,853,4.487012987012987

4262053,5,B0044WNK7U,"This is going to be a terribly corny review and please do laugh ( or cry) if you need to.  This has been the most  depressing and sad year for me and I've been dreading the holidays.  You see, I am a traditionalist who loves Christmas even though I'm Jewish. The holidays were never about presents but more about slowing down and enjoying the company of family and friends and my dogs who were the only pure source of joy in my life.  I loved baking and cooking and decorating and making the home such a festive beautiful place to be for a month. This year I don't have any family and many of my friends have passed  or moved away and both of my dogs died this year so I'm all alone. To make matters even more distressing, I finally decided to leave a horrible 18 year marriage to a very unkind angry man.  The price I must pay for my freedom is losing everything including my home, my gardens, and my cherished fireplace which has meant the world to me for many years.  I've been literally forcing myself to try and celebrate the season even though the thought of doing so isn't in my heart at all and frankly, anything that conjures up memories just makes me feel even worse. I have cried and cried almost every single day for months and I finally got so fed up with feeling so horrible and depressed that I spent Thanksgiving at a Mission as a volunteer chef which helped lift my spirit enough that I could come home and put up a small tree in my tiny office and I have all my dog's toys around it.  Then today during one of my down moments,  I decided to practice living without my fireplace by putting this video on my computer in my office. Depressed and cynical, I didn't expect much but oh my was I ever pleasantly surprised! The first version without the music was so realistic that I actually felt warmth radiating from my computer screen ( I'm so desperate for happiness that I am able to delude myself into believing all sorts of things- even in Santa).  Then, I played the version with the fire and music.  I must confess, this video has really lifted my spirit and changed my entire outlook. I feel recharged  and hopeful that I will once again look forward to the holidays even if I don't have a home with a fireplace next year. Happy Holidays everyone.",1417219200,366,2268,4.32311320754717

I'm a single guy and I enjoy having the fire on when sitting alone in my easy chair at night reading or using my laptop computer.

4262109,5,B0044WNK7U,"I first went looking for this because we haven't had wood heat in several years, and that's something you miss when winter comes.

I used my Prime membership to preview a few of these fireplace DVDs for free, to compare them. You'd think they'd all be the same, but when I watched one where just the fire filled the frame, I realized something was definitely missing. This Fireplace For Your Home DVD of the ""cracking fire"" also has the brick fireplace in the frame, and for some reason that's important. I guess it imparts a sense of place, of context.

What's a DVD of just a fireplace good for, you ask? Besides missing wood heat, I find that this is perfect for when I'm writing or reading and can't pay attention to TV or to music, but it's just too quiet to have nothing on in the background. I find the sounds of the fire surprisingly comforting, and am really glad I bought this video.",1391212800,2,893,4.406060606060606

However, my current home does not have a fireplace, and it was the holidays and I missed having a crackling fire in the background. On a whim I downloaded it and had it playing in the background while I sat by the Christmas tree and worked on holiday gifts :) It was so perfect! The fact that there is no music and just the sound of a real fire crackling makes it much more realistic.

The video pauses for a second or two and then starts again with the first video. The entire sequence is on a loop, so it can play continuously, as long as you like. This serves as excellent atmosphere to enhance a room. A good conversation starter too. All the fun of a fireplace without any mess.

It's terrific that one can choose between listening to music or only to the crackling fire.  The flames of an expertly built wood fire are as real as if there were a real wood burning fireplace.  This fireplace DVD is much better than another I saw that was gas flames. I love this thing, and it isn't hard to convince oneself that one feels heat emanating from the ""fireplace.""

Edited Original review:
The DVD version of this Fireplace is accompanied by music which spoils the enjoyment of the fire.  I was hoping the DVD would play like the Prime streaming version  which has only the sounds of the crackling fire.  I much prefer only the fire sounds so that the video can play with one's own choice of other sounds in the room, be it music, TV, or conversation.  The flames of the fire are great.

If you want to build a ""fire"" at home without all the hassle try purchasing and watching this DVD. I bet you'll be pleased with the realistic flames and sound when you hear the fire crackle. When Christmas rolls around I will be sure to fire up this video when we unwrap the Christmas presents. The video will add the homey touch and brighten our Christmas Day.

4262201,5,B0044WNK7U,"I have several different audio tracks of ocean, rain, jungle, and other nature sounds.  However, this is the first ambient video I have tried.

On a smaller monitor and on a large television both, it is fairly realistic both visually and audibly and if anything, it is perhaps more intense than the average fireplace.  It probably won't actually fool anyone who examines it closely, but it is definitely relaxing and lulls the mind after a while.  I like it much better than the fake wood stove my friend paid over $100 for at a big-box home construction supply store last winter and it certainly takes up less space.  That stove looks quite silly in her living room during the summer.

It works quite well on a widescreen format and will loop for continued watching. There are also shorter bonus tracks of an aquarium and a cascading stream.

The case notes it is region-free, so it should work on any DVD player.

4262203,4,B0044WNK7U,"I am reviewing the DVD version of this video.

First, let me say that I'm wholeheartedly in favor of the idea of having a fireplace video in general. I love sitting in front of my actual fireplace. I find it very soothing. For the times I can't light a fire or aren't at home, having this DVD option is wonderful. It's great for meditating and just for relaxing. So to everyone who is simply saying ""a fireplace video is a good idea"" - I agree wholeheartedly.

The question is whether THIS fireplace video is better than the many others available on DVD, download, and for free on YouTube.

My first issue is that the DVD claims a run time of 60 minutes - but really the video is only 30 minutes long. It just so happens that they have two choices - one with music and one without. So sure if you watched the fire first without music, and then with music, that would add up to 60 minutes. But I find that misleading. Most people prefer it one way or the other. They should be told that, when they make a choice, they get 30 minutes of video. Otherwise it's like saying a movie is 4 hours long but really it's a 2 hour movie available with an English or Spanish soundtrack.

Next, the DVD says ""Filmed in High Definition"" - but then says ""plays on all standard DVD players"". I.e. it's NOT a high definition DVD. Why tell us that it was filmed in high definition? That creates a misleading impression. It could have been filmed in super-duper-high-definition, but when it is cut to a standard DVD, we get standard DVD resolution.

The biggest issue in my mind, though, is that they sped up the speed of the film. Again, the house I've lived in for the past 18 years has a fireplace nearly identical to the one in this video. I watch the fire quite a lot. It's as if they did double or triple speed on this video. Maybe they did it so that more of the logs would burn in the 30 minutes available? Otherwise there wouldn't be much ""progress"" on the logs in the half hour? For whatever reason they did it, it hurts the relaxing mood. I don't need to see a fire hyper on speed. I would simply want to watch a normal fire, doing its normal rate of burn.

Add that in to the fact that the video's lighting is not well balanced. It's cropped oddly, so that you get a fair amount of grate but cut off the top. And the center area of the flame glares with blown-out overexposed white. There's no need for that with modern cameras. This overexposure makes the logs look plasticy too. Clearly they aren't - they burn :). But again it points to just not enough care being taken with the setup with this video.

All the video had to do was point at a fire and let it run. So there isn't much going on here. I would have hoped that they could do that for the full hour, and could have done that with good lighting.

I'm reading that people who download the video version get a longer play time, and that makes me wonder why that isn't available on the DVD version.

So, to summarize, I love the concept. It's the implementation which has several issues. I'd like to see a version 2 which took care of those.

4262207,5,B0044WNK7U,"There's something irresistible about a fireplace.  It's warm, it's nice to look at, and there's something really pleasant about the sound of the fire and the wood popping.  Fireplace For Your Home is a DVD that recreates the visuals and sounds that come with fireplaces without all the hassle of buying wood or owning a fireplace.  The fire on this DVD is hypnotizing (as fires are), and the entirety of the fireplace takes up the television screen.  The crackling sounds are also recreated here, and you can clearly hear the wood pop and crack as it burns.  If you don't particularly like that sound, you can always turn the sound down.  If you've ever tried to turn down the volume on an actual fireplace, you will quickly become upset because that is a very silly thing to do.

The classic version of Fireplace For Your Home comes with and without music.  At the title screen, you can choose either option.  I imagine that most viewers will opt for the version without music: the music on this DVD is inoffensive and relaxing, but it doesn't quite fit with the visuals.  The music feels like it could be found in an elevator or a hotel lobby -- it's nothing to concentrate on because it was created for the background.

The DVD track of this fireplace is approximately 30 minutes long, and it starts while most of the wood is untouched.  By the end of the 30 minutes, most of the book is burned (and the popping sounds become less frequent) and the video loops right back to the beginning.  You can have this on for an indefinite amount of time, and it will only stop whenever you want it.

When it comes down to it, whether or not you should buy this DVD (or rent it on Amazon Instant) boils down to one question: do you wish your television looked like a fireplace?  If you do, then this DVD is exactly what you would want in the sights and sounds that come with fireplaces.  If your answer is no, then what are you doing looking at this anyways?",1374796800,,1951,4.438202247191011
4262208,4,B0044WNK7U,"I received a copy of Fireplace: Classic free from the publisher, in exchange for writing an honest review. The DVD plays on a DVD player or a computer monitor.

For people who love the sound and sight of a fireplace, this is a nice alternative to the soot, smoke, ash and fire hazard of a real one. The fire popping and snapping sounds real, and you can watch the logs burn down over 30 minutes. The video loops so you have a new fire every half hour without carrying in the logs yourself. There are two versions on the DVD - one with just a fire and one with music. I didn't like the musical one much because I'd like to pick my own music for relaxing. But the crackling fire one is pretty relaxing.

My only complaint about this video is that the top of the fire is cut off. The camera should have been set back a little more, or pointed upward a little. The grate under the logs is clearly visible, but the top of the flames are not.

This DVD provides romantic ambiance and a calming background, whether you like the musical version or the crackling fire version.",1374537600,4,1067,4.272277227722772
4262209,5,B0044WNK7U,"Camp.  It was just like being at camp watching and listening to the crackling of a fire.  The fire isn't a raging one, but rather something that's comforting to watch as it catches on.  There are not one, but two options in the menu.  One is for the crackling fire and the second is the same fire with a light musical accompaniment.  I wasn't sure I'd like my fire served up with a bit of music, but it was relaxing.  The music doesn't overwhelm the crackling fire, but rather complements it.

In the middle of the winter, this will definitely be a welcome fireplace to keep running while I work at my desk.  About the only thing missing was the heat from the flames.  Simply add a heater, a cup of cocoa, and you're good to go.

I really have no complaint about the content of the DVD--the scene is very relaxing with a well-lit fire that gradually burns down to glowing embers.

It is about an hour long, and shows the real wood burn from new to almost extinguished with no annoying change in angles, etc. The one very strange thing about this video is that about 40-something minutes into it, a strange and loud trance like music comes on and lasts for about 4 minutes, then just as suddenly, stops and returns to the natural fireplace sound. This is very annoying when you're well into a book and relaxing.

Unlike other fireplace loops that reset after a few minutes the experience for me and my customers of watching a fire actually burn down like this one is night and day. Customers are suprised and delighted because it pops like the real recorded fire it is. The fire suprises customers who actually jump once and a while in delight. Its the suprise, guise of danger from ""sparks"", and watching logs be consumed over time that keeps customers watching and interested. Customers usually talk about warm memories of fires from the past when they mention it. We also use it at home to calm down the environment with out children. Our old looping fireplace was a dud compared to this. the human brain just tunes it out as white noise in a few minutes.

Now I can enjoy the comforts of the sight and sound of fire without actually setting one in my living room. Why did I take away two stars? First, I watched this streaming and the very beginning has a bit of music and an intro: NOT conducive to a relaxing evening after I wait an hour for the video to re-cycle through only to hear the music again. Secondly, I would expect that if one were to pay to watch three pieces of wood burning on their screen, that some effort would be made to make such a video HD.

Still, watching and knowing that people pay to watch a fire burn on their screens is really pushing on my creative juices right now. I am thinking of working on a ""Fireplace for the Home"" prequel trilogy featuring burly men chopping wood, or perhaps a companion ""Snow melting off your roof...""

I know it's a pretty limited theme, but can't someone come up with actual character development in this type of movie?  I totally don't believe the poker is even a real poker. The billows are about the only actor in this flick with any real acting experience.

I went crazy and put a space heater in front of the TV so you can sit in front of it and feel warm.  It's really nice to have on in the background and the crackling is nicely done.  My one problem with it is that about 45 minutes in the background adds something that sounds remarkably like a Hannukah song I sang in elementary school music class.  This goes for about 3 minutes, then goes back to crackling.  There's nothing wrong with the music itself, it just suddenly happens and then suddenly stops.  A little bizarre for a fireplace video marked to have no background.  The moral is, this is a great video, but don't be startled when it starts playing some snappy orchestral music in the middle.",1356393600,,804,4.541666666666667

The video itself is great, but I have to give Amazon a 1 star for pulling it off the Prime Video on Demand....

Is this Amazon's future strategy? If a video gets too popular, pull it from Prime membership and start charging a rental?

This is perfect for the winter season too; even if it doesn't give real fire and real warmth, it still feels VERY cozy. I highly recommend this to anyone who loves fireplaces. You can choose from having soft background music or just the soothing and relaxing sounds of wood burning in a fireplace. It's really quite romantic too. Note that this only runs for about an hour, so you might need to program the DVD player to make it play continuously. Really great product. I give it 10 stars! :)",1323907200,,805,4.482993197278912

You simply put the DVD into your player, and you have a beautiful fire going in any room in your house. The quality of the picture is very good. You get a crisp flame and you can also see some logs, which just makes it look even more realistic. It's perfect if you house is not equipped with a fireplace, but you would like to set a romantic mood for those cold nights with your sweetheart.

You can see the bottom of the fireplace and the grate that holds the logs, but the flames are cut off on top. To make it feel more realistic, it should have been zoomed out a bit so that you can see the entire flame. I'd rather see flames than the grate, but given a choice I'd like to see both.
