That being said, it's extremely good!  The computer animation is incredible!  I'm blown away by some of the beautiful scenes in space, knowing that they're CG created.  Amazing!  With a smooth and clever story, this movie is definitely a good watch!",1207180800,,418,4.506666666666667
8210062,1,B000TKCFJ0,"I love scifi movies. They are always my first choice of purchase, however I regret buying this one. It is a lame movie and poorly acted. I didn't want to give it even one star, but the only way to get in this review was to give it at least one. If you 'have to see it' then rent it- if you can find it. My copy will just gather dust.",1203984000,,333,3.704225352112676
8210063,4,B000TKCFJ0,"I tried this dvd on the advise of a friend.  I love hard science fiction, but did not have high expectations.  What a surprise!  The computer animation was absolutely terrific.  The plot consisted of a believable future and contained some surprises that made for a mystery that required full attention.  All in all a satisfying hour and a half of pure escapism.",1187827200,,361,4.758064516129032
8210064,4,B000TKCFJ0,"I purchased my copy based on the previous review.  The price was fine, and I hoped for the best.  Needless to say, I wasn't disappointed.  The pacing of this film is fantastic.  It never allows you to become bored, so the one-and-a-half hours dash by rather quickly.  The special effects range from good to outstanding and, unlike many films that wait until the end to show them off, they take center stage here.  If I have one complaint, it is that the ""outtakes"" portion isn't longer with a greater variety of funny mishaps.  All-in-all, it is a great addition to any sci-fi library.",1186272000,,585,4.621359223300971
8210065,4,B000TKCFJ0,"I really enjoyed this movie. It combines tension, intrigue and cool space battles. The cat & mouse space chases reminded me of ""Star Trek, The Wrath of Khan"", and the space debris scenes are as intricate and exciting as the classic asteroid scene in ""The Empire Strikes Back"". Starting with a simple survival scenario (think Hitchcock's ""Lifeboat"" in space), the movie soon starts serving twist after twist as the cunning characters try to outsmart each other and maximize their own chances for survival. The acting is solid and the plot keeps you guessing all the way to the end. I strongly recommend it.",1184371200,,605,4.883495145631068
