6435459,5,B00KO10QH2,"The film as a story: I really enjoyed the film. The acting was superb, story line very intriguing, and music was great! While the film touched on so many subjects of slavery, justice, and women. It also presented a sweet story of identity, family, friends, romance, and more. There are so many fascinating concepts of this film. The story in some ways  reminds me of Pride and Prejudice and or Sense and Sensibility with a twist.  The story circles around the Zong Massacre of 1781 (a nonfictional case) we get to see how this information impacts Belle (whose Papa has ""shielded"" her from this) . It's a story of identity, purpose, and companionship/love. The story also circles around Dido and Elizabeth are on the search for ""suitors."" At one point Elizabeth states that without men they can not support themselves. They must be possessed. At another time we see that the question (quite so often asked in many of Austen's books) do you marry for love or for financial security? Is rank more important than love? I really enjoyed this aspect of the film as a I said before it reminds me of Pride and Prejudice and or Sense and Sensibility!
The film as a piece of history: The point of the film as I hope everyone would see is that it is a tale, a tale adapted from a nonfictional character. The adaptation never said it would be a biography, instead it would tell a story and that's what I like! We get a little of smidge of Jane Austen romance, with a dash of history engaging film (provided by the mentioning of the Zong Massacre).  Do your research if you felt that you wanted to know the life of Dido, this is a film it's telling you a story.

I don't want to spoil it for you, but it is a very interesting film if you understand the concept, the story, and the pieces of history placed within it.",1401926400,13,1803,4.438066465256798
6435460,3,B00KO10QH2,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

What exactly do we know historically about Dido Elizabeth Belle, the subject of Amma Asante's new film, set in 18th century England? She was the 'illegitimate' daughter of Admiral Sir John Lindsay and a woman from the West Indies named Maria Belle. Since Lindsay was always away at sea, he ended up leaving Dido with his uncle, William Murray, the first Earl of Mansfield (who was the Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales) and his wife, at his Kenwood House estate, near London. The couple raised Dido, along with her cousin, Lady Elizabeth Murray.

Since people of mixed parentage were considered socially and racially inferior, they were usually relegated to a lower servant status and not permitted to mingle with their upper class employers. What was unusual here is that Mansfield chose to raise Dido as almost part of the family. An American visitor reported that Dido was not allowed to dine with the family (as depicted in the film) but joined the upper class ladies for coffee afterward in the drawing-room. Historically, Dido was responsible for the dairy and poultry yards at Kenwood but also assisted Lord Mansfield with his correspondence (work that was reserved for a secretary or a clerk). And Dido also had an annual allowance that far exceeded the salary of a domestic servant at the time (Notably cousin Elizabeth's annual stipend was much more than Dido's).

It appears that Dido and Elizabeth had a good relationship. This is borne out by the famous 1779 painting of them that hung at the family estate for many years. In it, we see Dido in a turban and Elizabeth in a more demure dress, placing her hand on Dido's waist. The suggestion that they were equals is further enhanced by the fact that Dido received expensive medical treatments and luxurious bedroom furnishings.

The film however, neatly depicts simmering racism beneath the surface between the two. When Elizabeth, unhappy that she has not found a man, expresses her frustration by taking it all out on her cousin, treating her as a subordinate and someone who should be ashamed of her parentage.

Since little is known about Dido beyond this point, Asante and screenwriter Misan Sagay are forced to create their own history to move things along dramatically. Unfortunately, the central plot point, where it's posited that Dido becomes an heiress, and cousin Elizabeth is left with virtually nothing (and hence is no longer of interest amongst the male suitors) doesn't work at all. In reality, there is no record that Sir Lindsay left Dido anything (although he did leave his two other children a small inheritance). Lord Mansfield did leave Dido 500 pounds outright and a 100 pound annuitynowhere close to the amount suggested in the film.

Thus we have this anachronistic conceit of Oliver Ashford (from an aristocratic family) who offers to marry Dido (in order to get her hands on her inheritance). It is unlikely that someone of that social status would offer to marry a woman of mixed parentage in that day. In the context of the story, it's even more unlikely since the other brother, James, is an out-and-out racist, and the mother, Lady Ashford, a bigot. According to the historical record, Dido did not receive that fantastic inheritance and got less than her cousin from family members. Of course even if she did, I still find it difficult to believe that the lure of the inheritance would take precedence over the social stigma attached to courting someone considered to be of inferior status.

Even if we accept the idea that Oliver would ask for Dido's hand, I didn't believe that Dido would have even entertained the idea of shacking up with him. The way it's depicted, Dido suddenly 'forgets' about how much she hates his brother and also ignores warnings that Oliver is only out for the inheritance. The idea that women during that time were so dependent on men in general and addicted to romance novels, that Dido would have thrown all her common sense out the window, still seems incredible, in the face of her convictions about the anti-slavery movement and women's rights. She knows the family she's dealing with from the get-go, so compromising - by accepting Oliver's proposal - appears completely out of character.

Now as far as Dido's romance with the dashing abolitionist vicar's son, John Davinier, that's another figment of the film's scenarists' imagination. Davinier was not even British in real lifeactually a French servant, so again the Asante and screenwriter have cheated us. Still, such a fictional creation works a lot better than the idea of one of the Ashford brothers asking for Dido's hand. There are some nicely acted scenes where Davinier, now cast as an aspiring barrister, goes toe to toe with Mansfield.

Even one of the more fantastic invented 'action' scenes, involving purloined documents related to the infamous 'Zong' case, which Mansfield must rule on, doesn't seem too outlandish in contrast to the whole Dido-Ashford brouhaha. The Zong case figures prominently in the history of anti-slavery efforts and the film provides an excellent service in educating viewers about some of the details.

If you're willing to overlook some of the major plot contrivances, 'Belle' has some good things going for it. Special mention should be made of the music by Rachel Portman. It's a brilliant score that enhances the dialogue and creates a great overall atmosphere. I liked Gugu Mbatha-Raw as Dido, who ably made her case for racial equality throughout the narrative. Tom Wilkinson steals the show as Lord Mansfield, conflicted over the values of a conservative society on the threshold of change. Finally, 'Belle' succeeds here and there in elucidating the class conflict of 18th Century England. Some of the invented material doesn't work, but overall this is a very attractive film that is worth a look.",1401580800,49,5879,4.971515768056968

6435487,5,B00KO10QH2,"A quote that hit hard to the center of my beliefs:
Davinier: Religion cannot be the only guardian of our morality. Of course not. There is self-responsibility. And failing that, does the law not have a duty? Does the bench and parliament not have a duty to uphold and create the laws that progress our morality, not... not retard it, if not to protect us from others, then to protect us from ourselves? Laws that allow us to diminish the humanity of anybody are not laws. They are frameworks for crime. And, quite frankly, I really do not care if you, as an individual, are without character or conscience, but a land whose laws sanction, not control, teh barbarous among its citizens, that is a country whose hope is lost.

This is an amazing movie, and one that speaks to ills still going on in society today. Is it right to see others as less than ourselves, whether that be by skin, race, creed, rank, or money? I don't think it is. And this movie shows quite plainly just how wrong that can be.

Yes, it's a romance, but it's so much more than that. And well worth watching. And the name that should be attached to this movie shouldn't be the most famous name. It should be the name of the main actor, or barring that for any stupid reason, the director. So forget Tom Felton is in this movie at all. Just remember these names: Gugu Mbatha-Raw and Amma Asante.",1518912000,,1365,4.412698412698413

6435498,5,B00KO10QH2,"This movie is a very good representation of the struggles that mixed-raced children face when trying to fit in with their family. Although Belle had royal lineage, the color of her skin dictated her place in society. This again touches on the thing about white purity, because even though her father was white, they still considered her to be fully black. Today, it isn't un-common for parents to disown their children for the type of children that they have, especially the conservative parents. For example, I know someone who is mixed-raced (black mother, white father). The only people that they know on their white side is their father. Their relationship with their grandparents is practically non existent, and they are raised in a predominantly black family. It's a shame that people have to hide who they are, because of what they are.",1512691200,,844,4.950704225352113

No point recounting the story since it is already published by Amazon. Without reservation I would recommend renting this film. It is based upon a true story and would be a great comparison to the greatly anticipated wedding of Prince Harry.  Fortunately his wife will not have to suffer as Belle did, but she will receive some discrimination and has to remember how much we all respect and admire her.

They were like sisters, an unusual situation with Belle's African heritage, but Lord Mansfield even had a painting made of the two girls together celebrating their bond.

I watched it because I am considering putting it on my syllabus for a course I will be teaching this semester. I was blown away by it. It was so carefully written, beautifully directed and masterfully acted. Though I am pretty sure a lot of artistic license was taken in the making of this film, this is a story that needed to be told. So much of the repertoire of films on Black history and the history of trans-Atlantic slavery is dominated by the experiences of African Americans and Afro-Caribbeans to a lesser extent. We also often forget that though the most oppressed were/are Black people who were not evidently mixed, biracial people also are a part of that history. While Dido Belle's story may have been unique it brings up so many matters of race and gender whose importance move beyond her particular story (or the filmmakers' interpretation of her story). My only slight dissatisfaction is that I yearned to see a bit of her mother's story if only for a few minutes, as well as some representation of the victims of the Zong massacre.

Her romance was developed on the meeting of the minds first which was one of the best things I love about this film. I had never heard about the Zong ship and after watching this film it intrigued my interest. A historical film that does that gets 5 stars from me right off the bat.

The dialogue make me tear up. It is beautiful and not at all sappy. The Zong case was explained in a way that tweens can understand what happened, without the intense violence and inhumanity of slavery, that should be taught later.

Truly of aristocratic blood, her presence in the family forces them to re-evaluate their beliefs about the dignity of every person.  This is especially true for her grandfather, a judge, whose authority has sway over the course of the slavery debate for years to come.  It is interesting the way in which the movie juxtaposes the treatment of women at the time as the chattel of men against the treatment of slaves as the chattel of businesses. What an inspiring story.  Highly recommended.  Note for parents: there is no sexual content in this movie. Aside from the frequently low-cut costumes, the movie is amazingly clean.",1470700800,,754,4.859375

6435710,5,B00KO10QH2,"I'm always afraid when I watch these types of films that the writers'/directors will take it down a road I won't like, so the first time I watch them I'm always on edge thinking ""Oh, please don't do this"" or ""Please don't say that"" thinking that at any moment something will happen and it's going to ruin the storyline for me. I was very happy that this was not the case with Belle. I think I actually sighed with relief at the end of the film content with the execution. In my humble opinion it was a well made movie. Though somewhat predictable, it was very satisfying in it's simple delivery, with a good mixture of entertainment and history. I very much enjoyed the characters and their relationship through the film, in particular the relationship between Dido and her ""Papa"". Overall, a satisfying film.",1464220800,3,809,4.625

6435712,5,B00KO10QH2,"I was intrigued by the trailer in the theater.  It showed for maybe two weeks in two theaters in the Portland/Vancouver metropolitan area,(population for 2,226,009 in the 2010 census has grown enormously in the short time before the movies release).
This is typical of the area for such a subject, despite the fact that this area is the capital of mixed-race relationship (my opinion from 54 years of observation).
This being said, I searched hard and long for announcements of it's coming and made a point to see it in both of the theaters that aired it. I told my friends about it and as soon as it showed up in Amazon's inventory, I bought it!
The movie is based on a true story but writer/director Amma Asante will tell you she has taken liberties with it.  She saw the painting and was so intrigued she researched it.  Google her interviews as they play a huge role in understanding the true story vs the creativity of the writer and will help in your appreciation of movie.",1464048000,,979,4.551136363636363

6435725,5,B00KO10QH2,"Belle is a beautifully filmed movie set in the slave trading era of the British empire. Belle is the daughter of a British nobleman and a beautiful African slave.  Her father brings her to his family home and asks his uncle, who is the lord chief justice, to raise Belle as his daughter. Although there is some definite trepidation, on the uncles part, in the beginning, Belle, being a brilliant and charming young lady, becomes her uncles favorite adopted child.
Upon the death of her father, while he is serving in the British Royal Navy, Belle inherits her fathers wealth, making her a lady of independent means. But in this backward and morally corrupt time period, Belle being half-African descent, is treated as less than her standing of a lady deserves. And things are complicated by the introduction of interested suitors into the story. Do they want her for her beauty and accomplishment, or do they simply want to take advantage of her fortune?
This story coincides with a landmark decision of the high court, which will decide as to whether the slave ship Zong will be compensated by their insurers for ""losing their cargo"", which amounts to them having thrown their cargo of slaves overboard, due to disease. It is a sobering and horrifying thought today that any corporation would expect to be compensated for murdering people. When Belle is made aware of this case by her uncle's handsome young apprentice, it sets in motion a compelling plot.
Anyone who is interested in Jane Austen movies will love this movie. Anyone who is interested in the beginnings of the Abolitionist movement will love this movie.  It's a winner.",1462752000,,1636,4.860215053763441

I was intrigued by 'Belle'  because they claimed all these elements with the bonus of being based in historical fact. I think it mostly delivered. It was a good story, extremely well acted, and the costumes were magnificent. However, it seemed unbalanced in character development. The conflict with her uncle was a bit unclear because one couldn't get a good sense of what sort of man he was and what was the true driving force behind his historic decision making.

6435765,1,B00KO10QH2,"This film has no real content Historically!!! After viewing this work I find it to be boring, lagging, and unoffical. The production company took the Zong incident the mass killing of enslaved Africans to tell a half done poorly draw out love story between two people of that time who would never been seen in public together not along romanicing each other.
The movie is not accurate Belle had hardly any influence on the courts ruling over the Zong mass killing.
The only real reason why this movie got over like it did was to show a white boy with a sister again... Wow we never seen this before! The selling theme interracial love affiar in the late 1700s.
Which is a facade, there's no way this white man would have every saw belle as an equal not along ""the love of his life."" It is sickens me to think they use the Zong massacre to promote the ""something new movement.""

This is based on the real life of Dido Belle who was a bi-racial woman in the 18th century that lived with her fathers family, (white side) and who also happened to be of a high social class as well. Just from these components alone, you can already imagine the struggles that she has to endure. It's how she overcomes and adapts to these things, though, which is what makes it a great movie. I also think they did a great job at capturing the real essence of what it would have been like to live during this time. So glad I watched it.",1450396800,,703,4.138686131386861

6435811,2,B00KO10QH2,"I saw this on CIGNAL HBO tonight and it was disappointing during the movie but the ending was dismal; for it did not show a true conclusion, one doesn't know if the writer wanted us to believe she married for love or died a old maid.  Before the true ending of the movie there were fifteen minutes of commercials and I waited angrily for a while then decided to look it up on Amazon to find that the movie does not have a true ending.  Still I felt that CIGNAL took advantage for the movie left off causing one to think there would be more.  I have looked at the picture of the painting and though others see Belle painted as a equal I can only wonder how they do, for I do not see that?  She is not depicted seated but standing next to her seated cousin to me the meaning is blatant, to me, she is not equal and references her station.  Her finger touches her chin in a thoughtful manner while standing slightly bent which in my own interpretation is a statement in itself that basically says look at me and ask yourself why I am standing here next to this seated white woman.  In no way does the picture say 'equals' to me.  The plot was interesting but I wish the writer had spent more time with it and since it is only the writers fantasy of this woman's life I felt the writer could have at least left me with a happy ending; Belle married to Mr. Ranier, the ministers son and apprentice barrister.  As to the blatant references to racism, these are quite naive as racism was even more blatant than that during this period in time and racial slurs would have been more abundant.  The writer has the family treat her as a outcast, not even worthy to eat dinner with, yet then at times, they are willing to be seen with her?  This movie is for people naive about racism in the early years who wish to have a sterile and fluffy view of the past.  Reality was much worse, people had children with slaves and then sold these children off.  I can only wonder what Belle's actual position was and how she truly was treated?  The UK was among some of the first countries to abolish slavery but racial arrogance was never abolished.  Hate continues to thrive in this world and no one is immune to it; if this movie was to leave me with the feeling that Ms. Belle was loved it failed miserably to do so.  What do I take away from watching this?  A feeling that I wasted a portion of my time and a slight feeling of depression that this movie is a indication the world is not changing for the better.",1446595200,,2494,4.218947368421053

6435836,5,B00KO10QH2,"Dynamite period piece layered with more than corsets and crinolines. Issues of race, family relationships, the position/s of women, and legalities verses moral integrities in the 18th century unfold organically and are confronted by authentic textured characters who are based in fact.
Society and historical context are displayed within the confines of a tightly written script, beautifully realized by artistic technical collaboration, headed by a director of imaginative vision, passionate loving heart, and a deft guiiding hand.
What's portrayed in this film is only one of the specific worlds that benefited and thrived during the long world history of black enslavement. It is a pretty world, for those on top of course, and we are not really shown ""slavery"" as experienced in another recent film dealing with a similar theme, Twelve Years A Slave. The sweep of Belle offers the audience a different tone, wider issues.  It's view of slavery is just as horrific as slavery is in Twelve Years A Slave, but its particular and also very specific points are made in quieter ways--at least for this viewer.
Both films hit home and are most satisfying, in their own good and different ways.
It's great to see a black woman leading a period piece, too.
Belle is a beautiful film and is one that I will watch again.",1440892800,,1313,4.995433789954338

Follow the journey of Belle as she navigates her life between two worlds (one in which she is a member of the privileged, only to a certain extent... because of her multiracial heritage. The movie does an amazing job of placing the viewer into the culture of the time which treated people of African ancestry as property and women as only having value if married. What I loved about the movie is all of the things that a viewer may not think about, but which Belle may have gone through. How did Belle negotiate her place in the family and her self-esteem (she was family enough to live with them, but not dine with them when company was present.)? How did it feel to be in a place of limbo (socially above the servants but also below your own family)? There is a seen in which she is rubbing her hands (I won't tell you the context, in case you haven't seen it) which breaks my heart. I also love that all of the characters are flawed and have to look at themselves and their own issues that impact the way their view and walk in the world.",1439683200,3,1129,4.305164319248826

6435869,5,B00KO10QH2,"Belle is one of the best Movies I have ever seen.
The essence of the film, (based on a true story) is the humiliation that poor Belle, has to suffer growing up, even in her own Privileged home,
purely because of the colour of her skin.
She is a sensitive, beautiful Half-Caste young girl, whose treatment is bewildering, intolerable and offensive to her, but she is powerless to do anything about it.
However, it doesn't make her bitter, but it makes her stronger and more determined to help others.
She, along with a young Lawyer friend, work to seek justice for, and change the Laws towards, coloured people.
I am Nannying my exquisitely beautiful Half-Persian Grand-Baby, so this true story,
touches an even deeper chord within me. I hope and pray our baby isn't subjected to any discrimination,
by school children or adults, even in this day and age-the 21st Century.",1436918400,,871,4.774834437086093

Belle is then introduced to racism and the plight of slaves which she  was totally sheltered from. The movie takes a turn here and takes on the subject of racism, social equality and the dilemma of slavery and the effects of moral corruption it brings, as the case of the slaver ship the Zong  and horrific deeds that were committed upon it is being judged by her benefactor The actress who plays Belle posses a hauntingly beautiful quality and captures the essence of Belle perfectly....I loved this movie.",1435017600,,992,4.380434782608695

6435934,5,B00KO10QH2,"""Belle""(2013), is directed by Amma Asante (A Way of Life). The movie is based on the true story of Dido Elizabeth Belle (Gugu Mbatha-Raw, the illegitimate mixed race daughter of an navy admiral who was raised by her great uncle, Lord Mansfield (Tom Wilkinson), and his wife (Emily Watson). A romance between Dido and an idealistic vicar's son threatens to turn her cocooned life upside as she becomes aware of the unjust societal morals of her time. This is an uplifting period piece full of life and passions surrounding itself with the beautiful gardens of an estate (Hampstead) outside London in the late 1700s.

The blu-ray looks great and has a number of special features about the painting which inspired the story, as well as about the leading actress (Gugu Mbatha-Raw) who played the role of Dido, and interviews with the director and writer.",1430006400,,850,4.902777777777778

Period accurate. The film may be a bit romanticized, that's fine with me. It does tug at your heart strings at times. You do feel for the characters and the film does evoke emotions from empathy, kinship and anger. Well, it did for me.
  The comments by others, on the films contents are spot on. My input, is on the emotions you may experience watching this movie.

6435964,5,B00KO10QH2,"Belle is a great movie and a must to see. It will take you back in time where slavey is the normal and life isn't easy to be black.  But for the few who do not whole this belief to be true and fight against the wrong doers. While Belle whose up bringing isn't normal, a black being raised as a equally as her white cousin with a few exceptions. The outcome is surprising.",1427414400,,371,4.013513513513513
6435965,5,B00KO10QH2,"Belle (2014) told a lovely, passionate tale set in the backdrop of England, 1700s. It followed the life of a ""mulatto"" girl named Dido, who was brought by her ""white"" father to live with his uncle, as he was in the navy and unable to care for her.
  Too high in status to eat with the servants... too lowly to eat at the dining table... Dido's situation is a difficult one.

  I was caught up by the drama unfolding, the passion behind emotions and convictions, the whimsical feel of this almost Cinderella-like tale. It was set during the colonial era, which I am fascinated by (though yes, the dresses could have come up a bit higher!). There was much emotion in the film, which you may have figured out that I really appreciate. And, along with Dido, I couldn't help but be intrigued by a certain vicar's son. The passion behind his convictions about slavery was enthralling. Riveting. I guess in comparison to the other men who were silly fools at best, concerned only with money and beautiful women; John Davinier's raw emotion, pain and fury, at slavery was refreshing.

  There are a few ""PG"" cautionary things. Like perhaps one use of a swear word, and some inappropriate talk about Dido from some young men. Also, a scene where a man acts rudely improperly toward a woman, seemingly to show her that he can do anything he wants with ""the likes of her"". Nothing to exceed the ""PG"" rating though, I don't believe. However, I suppose I would caution letting younger children watch it, as some rather vile things are implied though not shown.

  All in all, it was a lovely tale with poignant themes. I love a beautiful movie that also brings across some important messages! Belle (2014) was that. The truth and depth of some of the conversations and interactions left me startled but enthralled!! Amazing tale! And based on a true story! Though the end left me wishing longingly for more, this truly was a powerful film!",1427328000,,1926,4.635294117647059

6435990,3,B00KO10QH2,"The movie is very well made, and this is an interesting and important story. But the story that the movie tells is far from the truth of what actually happened. It would have been far better if the movie had told the real story. Do your research, and you will find the real story. It is a very important story and one that deserves to be told as it really happened and not cast aside in favor of what the script writer wished had happened.

Here is just one crucial difference between the facts and the movie ... In reality, John Davinier (who married Belle/Dido) was not a vicar's son nor a student of law as the movie portrays him but was a gentleman's steward, apparently French. All of the movie's scenes of his legal interactions with Belle/Dido's uncle, the chief justice, never happened. Nor is Dido's movie sheltering isolation by her uncle from his legal matters accurate: in fact, she was very important in helping him (the movie does make a brief mention of dictation but never shows her involved in that role), a role which at the time was usually filled by a male.

It is often said that ""those who do not learn the lessons of history are doomed to repeat them"". But if what is considered to be ""history"" is not accurate, then the lessons supposedly learned are not the lessons of history. There is an important true story to be told, and it deserves to be told well. But this movie does not tell that story.",1425686400,3,1421,4.440613026819923

6436012,5,B00KO10QH2,"I loved this movie for many reasons.  This was an inspiring story  based on historical events and people with a timeless message. Although the abolition of slavery portrayed in the movie is no longer a major political and social issue today, the underlying morals and heart issues are still relevant.  While watching the movie, I kept thinking that the message of this movie has a lesson for us today.  That life has value.  In eighteenth-century England, there were men in power who would like to preserve their way of life with no regard to its consequence to others. Is this not true today?  The movie told the story of a lawyer, John Davinier, who through insurmountable odds, was willing to stand against the status quo and fight for that which was noble and right.  One question I had while watching this story play out was,
""Are there men and women today who would be willing, at all cost, to do the same?"".  Perhaps a better question, ""Would I be willing to stand for something noble no matter the cost?""

Besides being a thought provoking and inspiring story, I also liked the movie for its acting and cinematography.  Moviemaking quality is high with much attention to detail for a historical period drama.  If you would enjoy the feel of a Jane Austen novel blended with history showing the horrors of British slave trading, this is the movie for you.",1424476800,4,1362,4.680672268907563

As a lover of history, I'm grateful to filmmaker Amma Asante for creating this fantastic work.

It's based on the true story of Dido Elizabeth Belle, who was the illegitimate daughter of Sir John Lindsay (an English Admiral) and an African slave woman named Maria Belle. Dido was brought at a very young age to be raised by her great uncle William Murray, 1st Earl of Mansfield, and his wife. She enjoyed all of the benefits of an aristocratic upbringing  except an equal status in society because of the color of her skin. Dido's life and her position in the eyes of her great uncle and guardian, Mansfield, who was Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales at the time, does impact, even if only to a small degree, the then-future of the slave trade in England.

Remarkable movie. I highly recommend it to anyone with even a passing interest in history.",1423353600,4,1005,4.597765363128492

6436055,5,B00KO10QH2,"Probably one of the most heinous acts of mankind has been the enslavement of another human being.  The British movie, ""Belle"" does not show that ugliness, but it does touch upon the validity of the slave trade law as it stood in eighteenth century England.  The film though fictional in part, is based upon a oil painting done in the late 1700s of a young, mulatto woman named Dido Belle and her British cousin. According to British history, a prestigious, British sea captain discovers his very young daughter orphaned and living in poverty on one of the many Islands he visits.  Upon finding her West Indian mother now deceased, he brings his daughter back to England and drops her off at his wealthy, uncle's house to be properly raised.  The movie fictionalizes about the life of Dido Belle and her efforts to properly fit into the upper class British Society.  What is not fictionalized is the historical account of how Belle's great-uncle's court rulings had a direct influence on the legal decision to abolish slavery. The movie does not pretend to be historically accurate, but it is, and well up until the very end it is both, entertaining and charming. Glad I took a chance and watched it.",1421539200,,1199,4.7451923076923075

I knew of course the history of women as property.  I know about the need to marry in order to survive financially but this film  pointed the situation out with a capital P. I think I understood it fully for the first time.

The main theme is the story of Belle, what it means to be interracial. What it is like to growi up at that time period in a family that is white.

 Her father's class and money gave her a certain amount of power even within a class system.  She actually had more freedom than most women at that time.

6436110,5,B00KO10QH2,"Biracial racism.  When I speak Spanish people are surprised. My Latino friends tell me I look ""white"".  Yet I have even been the butt of racist comments from the white family into which I married. With time I found they really were an ignorant bunch.  Knowledge is power and  this movie offers an opportunity to learn about racism at a pivotal point in history through the eyes of a mulatto girl.

The central problem is a law allowing merchant ships to dispose of cargo if it is necessary for the crew's survival.  The lost cargo is then expected to be covered by insurance.  What if the ""cargo"" is human? What if the judge trying such a case for fraud has a daughter who could have been this very same cargo but for her social position?

""Mulatto"" was a word spoken in whispers when I was little.  It means a child born of black and white parents.  As a mulatto child, Belle lives a high life because of her family and personal fortune yet she is restricted in society.  Her family is put in the precarious position of wanting her to live life realistically while not wanting her demeaned in any way.  They provide a protected environment  until she begins to question their values and seeks information for herself regarding the treatment of African slaves.  A perfect time to quote, ""But for the grace of God go I"".

Love has no color.  These historical figures proved this long ago when they commissioned a painting of a portrait with Belle and her cousin with whom she grew up. It is still displayed in one of Belle's family's castles.  It was the inspiration for this movie.  Now it has become my inspiration.",1419465600,101,1616,4.532871972318339

6436145,5,B00KO10QH2,"As per my review title, I actually found out about the movie Belle due to a movie poster of this film catching my attention inside the Regal Gallery Place Stadium 14 movie theater (Washington D.C. location). However, around the time the movie was released, I had a difficult decision to make between seeing this or another movie in the movie theaters. I confess that I went with the other movie,, but went with renting this dvd when I saw it featured a redbox location near the University of Maryland College Park campus.  Gugu Mbatha-Raw stars in the prominent role as Belle, and is shown in the beginning of the movie only briefly spending time with her biological father due to the nature of his job (he is a British Royal Navy Officer).  He is able to find family members to take her in but the transition is not easy for any of them due to the times that they were living in even with being upper class (the movie is set in 1700s England).  Her fathers uncle William Murray and his wife Elizabeth raise her up in the household (played by Tom Wilkinson and Emily Watson). On the positive side, Didos character enjoys a close relationship with a cousin close in age who is pretty much like a sister to her (Lady Elizabeth Murray played by Sarah Gadon). Didos guardians are concerned that her mixed race will prevent her from receiving marriage proposals. However, Dido does get the romantic attention of two men: from Oliver Ashford (played by James Norton) and John Davinier (Sam Reid). She obviously has to make a choice and it becomes clear to the viewing audience which man truly loves her regardless of how much she is worth. Meanwhile, Didos guardians are contending with the delicate balance of handling the stress of the trial involving slaves who met a watery grave without causing too much stress in their marriage.",1418342400,,1828,4.6532507739938085

I am not going to write it again but I did like this film for the fine acting and amazing costumes. There were very many facts that were changes such as her husband being a politician and not a valet. About the only things are are true are the names. Much is fiction and made to fit a certain standard in film making. For instance the cruel man-handling of Belle by her white finance's brother James is most alarming and was necessarily brutality. I disliked that very much. I think it was added in there to pit races against each other at a time when there is much hatred between races. It is a shame that these types of films are becoming popular again when we as a country are trying to put race behind us if we were only allowed to do so. Seems that it is PC to use the race card whenever it suits them. It is unfortunate and the statement made by Martin Luther King III is correct, ""He would be very disappointed to see this day"".

6436159,5,B00KO10QH2,"Absolutely fantastic! You don't often see the racial conflict played out on the European side of the ocean. What drives the intrigue out the roof is the fact that this woman, Dido, was real, and the painting is still around to prove this actually happened. To really understand this, you must recall that English society embraced at that time a caste system, a system of ranking individuals higher or lower than others. There are different stories here. You have the conflicted, but powerful judge who must draw from his own inspiration to be heroic and good because so many people are pressuring him to do otherwise. There is the Davinier character who likewise must ignore society's reminder to protect his ranking. You will want to google the Zong massacre after you watch this; looks like lawyers haven't changed. As far as the love story goes, I'm not a fan of love stories, but when people in this movie declare their love for each other, you'll have a real understanding why they would, and that will probably touch your heart.

The acting is so spot on, even the parts where you wished it would show whites in a better light wasn't covered up. I loved this movie, it was a Jane Austen with a spin, not just because of class but because of race as well. I cared about the characters, I cared about the story and that's what I look for in a movie - do I care what happens? Yes because I followed up and found that Belle passed in her 40's and her husband remarried but while she lived she was a important person who made a mark in history.",1415923200,,636,4.0476190476190474

Tom Wilkinson is old reliable in these period pieces, though his performance as Didos Uncle doesnt deviate far from his portrayal of Ben Franklin in the John Adams series. The movie added some interesting nuance to the portrayal of racial injustice, particularly the balance of personal convictions vs societal propriety. We see a family engage in their bubble of hypocrisy, accepting and loving Dido as their adopted daughter, but hiding her for fear of personal retribution from the society around them.
If you're already into period pieces, you will have no issue with the acting styles and pretentiousness in the dialogue. The story works well with the history of the Zong Massacre as a backdrop, together it makes a pleasantly entertaining movie. Worth the watch.",1415836800,,801,5.122137404580153

6436283,4,B00KO10QH2,"There may be spoilers.

Set in England in the mid-18th Century, director Amma Asante creates a believable stage for a look at aristocratic society's involvement in the slave trade.  Base on true events, the film opens with Captain Sir John Lindsay (Matthew Goode, ""Stoker"") speaking to his 8 year old daughter.  She is the offspring of his relationship with a slave woman who has evidently died.

As a career naval officer, Lindsay asks his uncle, William Murray aka Lord Mansfield (Tom Wilkinson) and Lady Mansfield (Emily Watson) to care for the girl.  Given her mixed race, and the couple's high societal rank they are reluctant but ultimately agree.  Lord Mansfield is one of England's most prominent non-royals as the Lord Chief Justice.  The Mansfields are also charged with the care of their granddaughter, Elizabeth Murray (Sarah Gadon), who has essential been abandon after the death of her mother.

Elizabeth and Dido Elizabeth Belle (Gugu Mbatha-Raw) are of the same age and quickly become cousin-sisters by their own account.  Dido's position in the family is an unusual one.  Raised with Elizabeth with love and affection by the Mansfields, she is offered the education and social grooming anyone of their status would receive.  Dido, however being a `Mulatto' was not allowed to dine with the family when they entertained.  Nor was she allowed to eat with the house staff, managed by Lord Mansfield's sister (Penelope Wilton).

Courtship is confusing as well.  While having dinner with the well-to-do was out, post meal mingling is OK.  The girls are eyed by the sons of Lady Ashford (Miranda Richardson).  Surprisingly, Dido is something of a catch, thanks to a healthy dowry provided by her father.  Beautiful Elizabeth, less so as her father has bequeathed his fortune to a new son, by a new wife.

While these tidbits play out, Dido falls for John Davinier (Sam Reid), the vicar's son and an aspiring lawyer.  He has taken up the case involving the owners of a slave ship, attempting to recoup their financial losses from an insurance company.  It seems that rather than deliver their slaves they tossed them overboard, chained together.  The case has reached the high court and Lord Mansfield will make the decision, as to whether the human slaves are indeed property and entitled to recompense.

Unlike Oscar winner ""12 Years a Slave,"" this film is never graphic in its storytelling.  The subtleties of the moral injustice is nonetheless there and never hidden.  The tone of the film is polite, not unlike many other costume dramas of the era.  The sets are stunningly beautiful and the story moves along smoothly with notable subplots.  The acting is first rate as you would expect from this class of British actors.  And Ms. Mbatha-Raw is beautiful to watch.  Expect more from her on the big screen.

As noted earlier, the film is beautifully staged and that comes across nicely in the Blu ray version.  It has a 1080p resolution and a 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  Many of the scenes are outdoors and I was especially taken with the naturalness of the scenes.  Soft and subtle, much like the overcast skies that prevail.  Colors are excellent and are best seen inside the palatial home of Lord and Lady Mansfield.  Skintones appear accurate.  There is nothing to complain about with the visuals.  The audio comes in DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1, a lossless track.  It is excellent without being overly expressive.  The surrounds come in to play mostly with the hustle and bustle of the London settings and the orchestral score by Rachel Portman.  Extras include a handful of short featurettes about the story, Ms. Mbatha-Raw's role, interviews and the famous painting of the two young women.  Recommended.",1414627200,,3715,4.957860615883306

6436310,4,B00KO10QH2,"I've read some valid criticisms of Amma Asante's ""Belle""; you know how it will end by 20 minutes in, at times it can feel stuffy and Masterpiece Theater-ish, it isn't as edgy as its subject really needs, it talks about the horrific obscenity of slavery, but never makes us face it as more than a concept, it plays a bit fast and loose with history to make its points, its villains are little more than cartoons. Fine, I think all those have some truth.

But in the end I found the film very moving, thought-provoking and uplifting in a way that felt earned. The film is the fact based story of a mixed race girl being brought up in upper- class England in the mid 18th century by a judge who would eventually make some key legal decisions about slavery.

There is more than a touch of Jane Asustin-equse social comedy in the drama, which observes that women of the time were also no more than property, if wildly better treated than slaves.

The acting writing and direction combine to create some memorable and complex characters. Their complexity becomes all the more apparent on 2nd viewing, when we can catch the flaws in those who are 'good', and the maddening strangeness of being a person alone in their own world in a way few people can imagine.

If the film takes a naive and then intellectual attitude towards slavery, it does so because that is also the experience of the heroine. On some level an outcast in her upper-class world, she begins as an innocent to the horrors around her. As she learns about them they inform who she is and who she becomes in ways that are moving and powerful.

The film may be imperfect, but it does a great job of combining a lush romanticism, with emotional weight, wit and righteous ideas.",1414022400,2,1734,4.509554140127388
6436311,5,B00KO10QH2,"Though the facts have been changed a bit to make them more dramatic (Belle's future husband wasn't a vicar's son but a French steward), this is a very engrossing story depicting a life set in a period of time which became a turning point in history. I imagine one never thinks of the biracial children produced by masters and slaves or what happened to those fortunate enough to have a parent wanting to provide for them.  I was a bit surprised at the ease with which everyone appeared to accept Belle, however. Some very pointed and not too quietly-spoken remarks, and that was it. One wonders why the title is ""Belle"" when the heroine is referred to a ""Dido"" throughout. It's recorded that ""Bell"" was her mother's last name , spelled without the ""e"" which makes it into a woman's first name. Her father is referred to in the movie as a loving, caring man but the fact that he dumped his daughter with his uncle and never saw her again (according to the story) doesn't seem to uphold that image. He's only mentioned again when she receives news of his death.  Nevertheless, he apparently loved his daughter enough to make certain she never had to suffer the bondage her mother lived through.

It's a lovely story with a remarkable lack of discord but with little delving into what's happening outside the estate where Dido lives with her cousin and guardians. Even when she and her uncle debate the outcome of his decision concerning payment to the owners of the Zong for the loss of their ""cargo"", they barely raise their voices. The one violent scene, with Belle's beau's brother, isn't as dramatic as the music accompanying it.  It's a Jane Austen-like piece without the usual Regency give-and-take dialogue, but nevertheless a thoughtful rendering of a life many people were probably unaware of.",1414022400,,1800,4.741214057507987

6436346,5,B00KO10QH2,"So, after suffering through Blended (alright, not truly suffering, but you get my drift) my wife decided that maybe she should give MY movie choice a try and so the other night (no, not last night, which belonged to a very different movie which Ill be reviewing later) we sat down to watch Belle.  I didn't really know a whole lot about this other than the fact that my good friend Ruth had talked this up on her blog when it first opened and she peaked my interest.

Tom Wilkinson having a prominent part was also a HUGE selling point.

For me, Belle plays out pretty much like what would have happened had Jane Austen penned Amistad.  A social commentary on race relations, class designations, love, ideals and family, Belle covers a lot of bases in a rather cohesive and eloquent manner that made for a beautifully composed film, one that felt honest and articulate.

Many films in this genre run the risk of feeling stuffy and dull, but Belle succeeds in avoiding that thanks to a compelling story that has enough bite to keep us more than involved.  The story, a true one at that, tells the story of a young woman, the mixed race child of a Royal Navy Admiral, who is raised by her uncle in 18th century England.  Her skin color is in direct contradiction with her social status, leaving her almost completely lost in the world.  Her uncle, Lord Mansfield, is the Lord Chief Justice and a respected member of society, an aristocrat with wealth and stature.  Because of this, and the inheritance received by her late father, Belle is set for life, materially, but because of her mothers origins and the skin color she possesses, Belle is held at a distance, unable to fully embrace her lineage.  When a slave ships inhumane actions come under the scrutiny of the courts, and into the judgment of her uncle, Belle sees an opportunity for her place in the world to be solidified, clarified and possibly even redeemed.

Belle delicately handles many themes, from the social relevance of racism and prejudice to the swirling affections of love, and manages to infuse life into both of Belles suitors, as well as to the people surrounding her life.  From country boy Daviniers admirable ideals to young Olivers search for his own social status to his brother Jamess distasteful ignorance to her cousin Elizabeths worry and desperation to her uncles conflicted paternal graces, everyone feels like a real person.  Even Lady Mary Murray, who really serves no purpose but to break up the tension and dramatics with a funny line reading, is extremely effective.

Gugu Mbatha-Raw is astonishingly effective here, evoking such tremendous depth within her portrayal of Belle, a beautiful soul trapped in a world unable (or unwilling) to wholly accept her.  The way she holds herself, fully aware of the place she should have, contradicts the way she sees herself in the mirror, lost and ashamed, and the way that Gugu relays these contradictions is stunning to watch.  There is a moment, when smitten at the words of a would-be suitor, where her ears hear the shock of ignorance and her eyes well with tears she refuses to shed and she quickly changes the subject, calling attention to a sound she hears in the distance.  That scene is everything because it is within that moment that we see just how amerced in this character Gugu truly is.

Belle tells a very important story, one of intolerance, change and ultimate acceptance, and the way that it is woven is beautifully compelling and soulful.

A uniformly great ensemble, a beautiful score, an intriguing story and some stunning visuals make for a really surprising entry into the genre that left me completely satisfied.",1413331200,3,3669,4.776898734177215

6436363,2,B00KO10QH2,"I truly wanted to like this film.  Rarely are we treated to historical films devoid of the usual, yet unnecessary, sex scenes.  Furthermore, rarely do we see a strong, black, female, figure in a historical film in any other capacity than one of slavery or in dealing with the extreme abuses of a racist society.  This is not to diminish films which cover the latter two concepts, but it is nice to see that someone realizes there can be positively themed historical stories for black women.

On the up side we have the attempt at making such a film, where a black woman is not portrayed in the usual format of slave or as the victim of extreme sexual abuse.  Also, Tom Wilkinson and Emily Watson get points for not only acting their best, but doing their best to save a sinking ship.  The costumes are lovely and the visuals lull us into a false sense of security that this will be a grade A film, and there ends my reasons for awarding two stars, rather than one.

Now, let's focus on why the other three stars did not make it to my review: (1) Editing, (2) Flow (3) Failed Romance (4) Historical Inaccuracies/Misinterpretation of the Art (5) Blatant Prejudice.

Firstly, the end credits prove that editing was somewhat skimmed over in this film.  The type moved so quickly and was so small that neither the epilogue nor the cast and crew were visible.  I pitied the people who saw this movie without the benefit of a pause button.  This made the whole entire movie feel B-class, rather than the high-end costume drama it should have been.

Secondly, The general flow of the film was greatly disturbed.  No sooner do we get one interesting plotline then it is ripped away from us and replaced with a new one.  Stories, in general, were not let to grow naturally, and when we were finally given a solid storyline, that did take up most of the film, it was unsatisfactory.  I speak mainly of the quick skim past Dido's role as her uncle's secretary, in favor of mindless romances.  Even Dido's relationship with her cousin was hit and skip throughout the film, and never fully developed.

Thirdly, and speaking of relationships that don't develop properly, there is the Devinier relationship, which never quite gets ripe enough before the film plucks it and jams it down our throats.  When I finally got off of the chaotic switch from one plot to the next, and realized that the film was finally settling on a romance as its modus operandi, I focused and waited to feel the romance blossom, but no sooner did I start to feel the necessary romantic tension when this was dashed away and we were all rushed off to the finish.  I felt like I was reading a cheap romance novel, where no sooner do the two characters meet, then they are having sex.  Tension is good for a romance, and rushing one before it has had time to season does not help the quality of a film.  Again, this made the film look more B-class than grade-A.

Fourthly, though movies rarely portray so-called ""historical"" films with 100% accuracy, I truly cannot fathom why the director and writer chose to alter some of the most irrefutable facts simply to suit the agenda of this film.  I shake my head all the more because, sadly, the uninformed masses will take this film as they would a documentary, and not as the work of fiction that it is.

I am speaking primarily of the misinterpretation of the painting, the very inspiration for this film.  The painting is striking for its subtle peculiarities.  It is true that Dido stands out in this painting as being content and happy.  Her expression is, in fact, playful.  Just as the movie portrays, black people were almost always painted in an attitude of somber subservience or awe for their white masters.  Dido is not portrayed this way.  Elizabeth does lay an affectionate hand on Dido, and the overall feeling of the piece is one of greater ease and contentment than any other of its kind.  However, unfortunately, the painting also reveals that Dido is neither her cousin's personal superior, as the movie would have you believe, nor is she even a true equal.  Friendly, yes, but an equal, no.  History cannot be altered simply to suit our modern views, and though Dido was in an elevated position, remarkable for her time, she was by no means the figure portrayed in this film.

A simple interpretation from an art historian would have very easily revealed the flaws in making these two women on completely equal footing, or rather, in some respects, elevating Dido over Elizabeth.  Dido is dressed well, but her dress is not the same cut as Elizabeth's, who is wearing the socially proper attire for the day.  Dido also wears a turban.  Both the turban and Dido's dress are indications of her exotic nature, something that was fine for darker women, but not English society ladies.  Elizabeth also has her hand on Dido, yes, but not just in affection, but in affectionate restraint, much like a mother would do for her wayward child, as if to say, ""I am restraining you from your wild exotic ways, just so you don't get out of hand.""

It was a common idea, both in the 18th century, and even through the 20th century, that black people could be wild and sexual, when it was not okay for white women to do the same.  It is no accident that music from black artists became popular in the 20s and 30s.  Black music and dancing could be more sexual than white music.  If you doubt my word then simply flip over to TCM when they are showing movies or shorts from this era.  The white dancers can be sexy, but not nearly as overtly sexual as the black women.  Why anyone would suppose that the 18th century would be more forward thinking than the 20th century is beyond me.  Moreover, I'm sure the film makers had access to an art historian who could have easily interpreted this painting for them.  In truth, the mere fact that the painting used in the film is so drastically different than the original shows me that the film makers did know and did have access to a proper interpretation of the artwork, but blatantly ignored.

Further analysis of paintings from the 18th century will show that proper young ladies have straight backs, like Elizabeth's, and Dido is certainly not as erect as the movie painting shows, but rather, stooped forward at a much sharper angle.  Dido may not be lowly, but she is not on equal footing with Elizabeth.

Now, I do realize that the director and writer wanted to show a strong, black, female, historical character, as I have long wished for, and perhaps they felt that emphasizing these facts would hinder the overall tone of the film.  However, I would argue that they have hurt the character of Dido far worse by not showing events as they truly were.  The fact that Dido was her uncle's secretary, that she did have an independent income, that she did have charge of the house, and that she was on friendly terms with her family is immense for the era we are talking about.  It would be immense if we put this in any historical era.

I am, in fact, a bit put out by the fact that romance seemed to be the greater agenda for the film, rather than Dido's mental accomplishments as her uncle's secretary.  There was so much that could have been done with this!  There are even some historical accounts of the items Dido bought with her money.  Why did we not see this!?  Dido enjoying her independent income would have been empowering even for white women of the 18th century.  Why could they not have taken out the imagined, mindless, romances and have please let us seen Dido's day as only modern cinema could have created for us?  Unfortunately, this fine opportunity was lost in lieu of altering historical facts.

I have always said that when you deny historical facts, no matter how unpleasant, you deny the fortitude of the characters who overcame their obstacles.  Twisting history to suit a modern agenda only insults the truly strong person that Dido must have been.

Finally, even if we are being generous and excusing the historical inaccuracies in favor of creating a more dynamic fiction, there is still the problem of the blatant prejudice in the film.  Odd, considering that I am sure the original intent of this film was to do away with such prejudices, but instead of ridding us of them, we are treated to more of them, in newer and more creative ways.

There is no evidence to suggest that Tom Felton's nasty character ever truly existed in Dido's life in any capacity.  The fact that he was invented at all, along with all of his racial slurs, is completely unnecessary, and I have to ask, ""if the reason for altering history was to avoid focusing on such disgusting racism, then why were we treated to it in the form of James Ashford?""

Furthermore, why is Dido portrayed as being more accomplished, reserved, and refined than her cousin Elizabeth?  Being an 18th century woman, of moderate means, in society, and in pursuit of a husband, her family would not have rested until she was tutored into musical accomplishment.  Musical accomplishment was a society woman's trade in the 18th century.  There is even historical evidence to suggest that Elizabeth was quite accomplished in this respect.  Additionally, as I have already detailed, Elizabeth is portrayed in the painting as having to restrain Dido, not the other way around.  This was, in fact, a general opinion of darker skinned people, that they needed reigning in, because they had a propensity for overt and even wild behavior.  Even if you do not want to show Dido being ""reigned in"", this to would be okay, and only proper given a modern context.  We do not need to support or advance outdated 18th century views, but it is absolutely insane to show Elizabeth as being less accomplished, and less lady-like.

Then we move on to the string of improbable conversations and romances, which all add up to this: that Dido is prettier, more desirable, and more accomplished, than her poor, little, drab, dull, white cousin.  This is not only a real historical bender but a blatant case of reverse racism.  Elizabeth comes out of the story looking so one-dimensional that the writers didn't even bother revisiting the relationship between the characters after Elizabeth learns of Ashford's marriage.  In fact, though we are supposed to swallow that these two characters are best friends, there are few true confidences exchanged between them, and Elizabeth mostly looks so completely mentally inferior to Dido that it is impossible to imagine that these two characters could ever be on such intimate footing.

Last of all, is Dido's appearance.  While I believe Gugu Mbatha-Raw is a very beautiful woman, and the little girl who plays young Dido is adorable, both actresses have Caucasian features.  The Dido in the painting is darker than both actresses, with very dark eyes, and jet black hair. You cannot tell me that there was not a beautiful dark woman to play this part, because I know that is untrue.  I am so sick of seeing lighter skin, lighter eyes, and lighter hair being held up as the greatest in ethnic beauty.  Memoirs of a Geisha did it, not to mention all of Aishwarya Rai's popularity, and now this.  When is black hair, black eyes, and black skin going to be held up for the true beauty that it is?  But what we get instead is a constant cinematic reinforcement that light coloring, even in dark-skinned people, is still better.  What was the point in deviating from history, when all you were going to do was aim for a new kind of racism?

6436424,5,B00KO10QH2,Great movie! Too often good movies like this are passed over for big budget special effects. Belle is based on a true story which makes it even more intriguing along with a long forgotten time. Belle is fathered by a white noble man with a black mother who dies due to illness. Her father takes her to be raised at his family estate. As a family they navigate the unknown waters of raising a mixed child in a home where her color raises issues...but as it should...love and conscience prevail!,1412121600,,493,4.488888888888889

This is very different from the real story of Belle.  In real life, Belle's husband was her father's steward, and they married after Lord Mansfield died.
Also, in real life her cousin had the money, and Belle did not.
It seems the story was crafted loosely around the story of Belle, in order to show the cultural mores of the times.
But it was a very good movie, if you can forgive the bending of reality in order to make an interesting story about the time period and the struggle to end slavery.",1411948800,,571,4.438095238095238

Although it plays a bit like a BBC mini series, the story of a mixed race woman whose mom was a slave and dad a noble man is so interesting because you really see someone caught in between two worlds.  Not only is she raised noble but held back because of her race, but she's an heiress so she doesn't have to marry to secure her future.  Being an heiress makes her a desirable match with the exception of her being mixed race.  It's set in 18th century England and also shows the roots of the end of slavery there.  It's based on a true story, which makes it even more interesting.",1411862400,,702,4.28030303030303

""Belle"" is the moving story of a mulatto woman who, regardless of her ethnicity, decides to take control over her life and bring attention to the atrociousness of slavery.

The film is beautifully shot with a great cast of actors. I highly recommend it.",1411862400,,476,4.523255813953488

6436448,5,B00KO10QH2,"A beautifully scripted historical piece based on a true story.  Dido Belle was a woman of mixed race, raised by her uncle in the mid 1700s.  Her Uncle Will Murray was the Lord Chief Justice. According to Wikipedia.  ""In these years, her great-uncle, in his capacity as Lord Chief Justice, ruled in two significant slavery cases, finding in 1772 that slavery had no precedent in common law in England, and had never been authorized under positive law. This was taken as the formal end of slavery in Britain. In a case related to the slave trade, he narrowly ruled that owners of a company were not due insurance payments for the loss of slaves during a voyage, as it appeared related to errors by the officers.""

While the movie isn't completely true to her life, it is beautifully scripted and a wonderful romance movie.  It remains inspirational to the cause of social justice.  It depicts both the plight of woman and black people during this time period.  Women were little more than the property of their parents and their husbands; and the movie speaks to both blights in the society at that time.

My favorite quote from the movie, ""Laws that allow us to diminish the humanity of anybody are not laws, they are frameworks from crime.""",1411689600,3,1240,4.682027649769585
6436449,3,B00KO10QH2,"It's a good movie... for historical fiction.

The Good
* The casting was superb, with the exception of Belle who was only good, not great.
* The sets and costumes were fantastic. You really got a feel for the period. It was a delight for the eyes.
* The music was unobtrusive, yet effective. Great way to support the action.

The Bad
* The writing was preachy, stilted, or explanatory in places. It felt false- like it was there to move the story along or explain what was going on. It didn't always flow.
* The characters were written with modern sensibilities. I am sure Belle had an influence on her uncle's decisions, but she did so many things in this movie that would have been positively scandalous. It's just not believable.
* Too neat. It just felt like a Hollywood story. This is a gritty story. Amazing Grace did it a LOT better.",1411689600,2,840,4.4480519480519485

Akin to Jane Austen films, but so much more rewarding. It shines unexpected warmth to an issue that haunts the world even today. If you liked Amazing Grace, you really ought to give this film a try.",1411516800,,562,4.564356435643564

6436529,5,B00KO10QH2,"I knew I wanted to see this movie the moment I saw the trailer.  I am a fan of American history especially the slavery period.  This view of slavery from a British point of view was a first for me.  Because Belle was raised in a higher class and treated as an equal this film more reminded me of a Jane Austin book. It had a lot to do with class, marriage and love.  Slavery was the more serious side of the movie.

Very glad to have seen this movie. Will be one of my favorite of all times.  I have to buy this movie for my collection. Such a beautiful film.  Verbiage was beautiful.",1410739200,,584,4.026086956521739

6436537,5,B00KO10QH2,"I stumbled upon ""Belle"" entirely by accident. It was a ""sponsored"" item on Facebook and caught my eye because of the ""period setting"" of the Bluray cover. I am a big fan of Jane Austen and British period drama so I was immediately drawn to it. After checking the trailer on Youtube and reading the reviews on Amazon and IMDB, I purchased the bluray sight unseen. I am very happy that I did.

The story is inspired by the portrait of Dido Elizabeth Belle Lindsay and her cousin Elizabeth Murray. The portrait is currently housed in the Earl of Mansfield's seat in Scone Palace, Perth, Scotland, and was formerly attributed to artist Johann Zofanny.  It begins with Captain Sir John Lindsay becoming acquainted with his daughter Dido, his illegitimate child with a former African slave Belle who has died. Capt. Lindsay takes Dido and places her in the care of his uncle, the Lord Chief Justice and Earl of Mansfield, and his wife Elizabeth. Lord and Lady Mansfield have no children and already have their young niece Elizabeth in their care. Elizabeth is the daughter of their nephew and heir David Murray, although she was left to their care by her father after he remarried.

Dido and Elizabeth are raised together and become inseparable companions. They are both educated, accomplished and spirited young women (the latter much to the chagrin of their grand-aunt Mary). They are then thrown into the company and attentions of eligible young men, most notably James and Oliver Ashford. Their mother Lady Ashford sanctions the match for James and Elizabeth, assuming that Elizabeth is heiress to the Mansfield estate. In truth it is Dido who is the heiress while Elizabeth is a relative pauper, having been abandoned by her father. Younger brother Oliver forms an attraction to Dido. Another young man, John Davinier, is introduced into the Mansfield household as a protege of Lord Mansfield. John, the vicar's son, is an ambitious, intelligent but impoverished young man who wishes to make law his profession. Lord Mansfield is set to rule over a legal case that is in the forefront of London society at that time - the Zong case (aka Gregson vs Gilbert), which involves the death of slaves on a ship bound from Africa, in which Lord Mansfield is the judge. As Lord Mansfield takes him under his wing, John becomes involved in the case. Dido develops an interest in the case and she and John form a friendship. As Dido and Elizabeth embark on a trip to London for the season, Lord Mansfield prepares for the one of the most controversial cases of his time. Love inevitably follows them there as both young women discover that the path to love and marriage is often full of complications.

While this film includes all the necessary ingredients to make it a topnotch period drama - a brilliant cast, beautiful locations, sumptuous costumes, fine acting and high production values - what makes it stand out to me is how it is told from a very different point-of-view. Instead of one of our fine Jane Austen-esque or Dickensian heroines, we have a young, strong-willed and intelligent bi-racial heroine. Dido faces the same challenges as other young ladies at the time in terms of social mores and customs as well as the inevitable necessity (at that time) of finding a suitable match. But her challenges are exacerbated because of the color of skin, as certain restrictions are placed on her and some in her society deem her ""unsuitable"" as a wife. Those that do find her suitable raise suspicion as to whether they love her for herself or for her wealth.

The storyline is one of the main reasons why I love this film. It is well told, inspiring and engaging. The other is the wonderful cast. English actress Gugu Mbatha-Raw is the perfect Dido. She is lovely and with such a bright spark that makes her entirely convincing as the intelligent, engaging and strong (yet in a feminine and understated way) heroine.  Much like ""Pride & Prejudice's"" Elizabeth Bennet or ""North & South's"" Margaret Hale, her Dido is no shrinking violet. Sarah Gadon is charming and often funny as Dido's vivacious and lovestruck cousin Elizabeth (Bette). She is the yin to Dido's yang. The young ladies could not be more different and yet they share a bond and friendship as sisters would.  One of my favorites, however, is Sam Reid who plays the idealistic, intelligent, ambitious John Davinier. John is no mere cipher. Sam infuses such passion, personality and charisma in his role that he commands the screen even as he goes up against Tom Wilkinson's formidable Lord Mansfield.  Tom Wilkinson is always brilliant in whatever he does, and his Lord Mansfield is convincing as both the imperious Lord Chief Justice and the protective and gentle ""Papa"" to Dido and Bette. He truly feels that weight of his burden - knowing that he is about to make a decision over a case that could change the face of slavery in England. And even with this burden, he knows that he also has a family life and the well being of his young nieces to consider. Emily Watson plays Lady Mansfield, who balances her motherly responsibilities to her nieces and is the rock and support for her husband. Penelope Wilton plays Lady Mary Murray (sister of Lord Mansfield) who has never married and takes charge of the Mansfield estate. Miranda Richardson is Lady Ashford, James and Oliver's mother, whose main objective is to seek eligible (i.e. wealthy) wives for her two eligible sons. Alex Jennings plays her husband Lord Ashford, colleague of Lord Mansfield.  Harry Potter's Tom Felton is James, who initially pursues Elizabeth, as the Ashford's assume that she is an heiress. James detests Dido while his brother Oliver (James Norton) feels otherwise.  Matthew Goode has a small role as Dido's father, Captain Sir John Lindsay.

Credit to the strong screenplay, Amma Assante's directing and the talents of these actors that every one of the characters has a personality that jumps off the screen. Even the maid Mabel and the carriage driver Wimbridge are memorable. And may I say that I love the chemistry between the two leads? You have all seen the trailer so it will not be a spoiler when I say that the electricity when Dido and John are onscreen is palpable. Within the first few minutes of the movie, I knew I made the right choice in purchasing this film. It is engaging from beginning to end and I have to admit I watched and re-watched this many times since. I wish this movie was longer because I did not want Dido's story to end.  If you enjoy period dramas such as Pride & Prejudice, BBC's North & South and Downton Abbey, then I highly recommend this movie.  It has become one of my favorites in my British period drama collection and I hope this encourages others to see this film and take that chance as I have. I am so glad that I did.",1410652800,10,6805,4.75190516511431

However, if you are looking for an engrossing story, well acted, with lush cinematography and costumes; and if are a lover of Jane Austen and similar period pieces, you will thoroughly enjoy this movie. As with Austen's writings, it delves into a woman's place in English society during this time period and additionally resonates on the subject of the inherent immorality of slavery and racism. I recommend it heartily and would probably add an extra half star if I had that option. Perhaps the best indication of how much I liked the movie is that I, who seldom go to see movies in the theater, ventured out to local cinemas 3 times to watch it again and again and again even though I knew I would be purchasing it for my movie library.",1410307200,,877,4.592356687898089

6436619,4,B00KO10QH2,"I love a good period drama, but I especially love a good period drama that actually teaches me about something that occurred in history that until now, I never knew about. This is the case with Belle. It's not just a story of a mulatto woman being raised among the lords and ladies, but also the story of the Zong, a slave ship on which traumatic circumstances caused it to be a crucial step in abolishing the slave trade.

On the Zong, the traders claim to have ran out of water, a huge problem for ships in the 1700s. They had a LONG way to go. They threw the slaves overboard, chained to one another, to drown, and wrote it off as ""lost cargo"" and a ""must in order to save the lives of seamen"" aka white men.

Once back on English soil, they tried to claim insurance money for the dead slaves.

And this ""lack of water"" excuse passed muster in the low courts, but when it made it to the high courts, it was another story. Some facts came to light...and in order not to spoil the movie for those of you who haven't seen it, that's all I'm going to say on that. However, Belle's caregiver/uncle is the judge overseeing this case.

Behind his back, Belle is trying to do whatever she can to ensure the outcome does not go in the traders' favor. Meanwhile, a wealthy man is trying to win her hand and she believes it's her only chance to marry, because despite her wealth, most English gentlemen won't marry a woman of color. But can she act as though her Negro mother is a shameful secret? Can she shun her heritage?

It's very interesting to see what happens. I was holding my breath and at one point--the end--actually shed tears of happiness. I became quite engrossed in this tale. It's true, by the way. It's based on a real woman. Also cool to watch was how the family changed from being, ""But she's a Negro! You failed to mention that. We can't raise her in this house"" to ""She's one of us"" despite the fact they wouldn't let her eat at their dinner table.

That brings me to some things that confused me and thus knock off a star. If they love her so much, if they accept her as they seem to, why is she eating alone still? If her father loved her mother as much as he claimed to, why was she living in the slums? And why in the world was Belle so rude and nasty to the clergyman's son upon first meeting him?

But an inspiring movie. Belle was truly a strong woman who stood up for herself, her heart, and her beliefs.",1410134400,,2426,4.226781857451404

In the end, the world changes because of the personal relationships we all have with each other. I was feeling claustrophobic as Belle tried to walk along an acceptable path which reconciled her race and her aristocratic status. Had she chosen alternate paths, her uncle might not have interpreted the case as he did. It would have been better had there been a scene during which Belle confronts her fiance in the presence of her family and his about his brother's almost brutal manhandling of her which he did to demonstrate that, for him, she was nothing more than a slave. That would have been a chance for the decent brother to gain some resolution. I can't see why it was not written and/or filmed that way.

I complained to Amazon once I found out and apparently the studio is the one who released it this way, so they have no choice over it...oh, but wait a tick...if you go onto Netflix, (it will release on the U.S. Netflix 9/23/14) it says it has both formats...so what's the problem here, Amazon? I'm actually considering 'losing' the standard copy I receive through Netflix just so I can own it. Which is ludicrous. I don't want it on Blu-Ray, I have a highly sophisticated Bose system which has a standard DVD player and it performs amazingly well, and I have no intention of buying  a whole other player just for this movie, no matter how much I love it. And I don't want it on Amazon Instant video, because I'd like to watch it on my nice, big screen tv, attached to my nice, pricey Bose system.

6436667,5,B00KO10QH2,"Contemporary social problems show their roots in this stunning film BELLE. Based on a true story as adapted for the screen by Misan Sagay and directed with eloquence by Amma Asante this film reminds us again of the 18th century British slave market and the tragedies that accompanied the transport of salves from their origins of freedom to the aristocracy's whims and homes as slave servants. It is disturbing to consider, spectacularly beautiful to watch, and offers a cast of some of England's most brilliant actors.

As the pre-production promo states, `BELLE is inspired by the true story of Dido Elizabeth Belle (the very fine actress Gugu Mbatha-Raw), the illegitimate mixed race daughter of a Royal Navy Captain (Matthew Goode). Raised by her aristocratic great-uncle Lord Mansfield (Tom Wilkinson) and his wife (Emily Watson), Belle's lineage affords her certain privileges, yet the color of her skin prevents her from fully participating in the traditions of her social standing. Left to wonder if she will ever find love, Belle falls for an idealistic young vicar's son (Sam Reid) bent on change who, with her help, shapes Lord Mansfield's role as Lord Chief Justice to end slavery in England.' The cast is rounded out by excellent performances form Miranda Richardson, Penelope Wilton, Sarah Gordon, James Norton, Tom Felton and Alan McKenna.

The costumes, sets and scenery, and musical score are all top notch. But the aspect of this film that makes it a move into such importance is reminders from history of the problems of racism that continue to plague us in current times. Perhaps seeing this film will help understanding. Grady Harp, September 14",1409702400,,1666,5.0989010989010985

The premise and historical background are so interesting that it almost seems a crime to watch this over-wrought, rushed drama. The actors don't seem to inhabit the world they're trying to create, but appear more like pretty set pieces.

How did society handle the rank of an illegitimate child of mixed lineage, particularly when that lineage was evident in her features? To make matters even more complicated, the child is a girl who, when older, will be in need of protection and provision long after her guardians have passed. The obvious solution of the time was to marry well - but how could a child of her background marry well during such a time of rank prejudice? This film delves into the proposed issue and provides a most hopeful and intricate solution. I enjoyed every bit of the journey.

Matthew Goode's performance - though very brief at the beginning of the film - was very moving, and set the stage for how Dido would be treated by her other relatives. The story took several twists and turns that I had not expected as I watched it unfold but it left the audience with a very satisfying ending.

6436722,3,B00KO10QH2,"Beautifully photographed and the costumes and architecture of the period are superb.  The story is somewhat tedious as it does not fully develop the parents of Belle and no story of her mother other than what Belle states which is too brief for us to get a mental picture of the character and her person.  Although we see Belle's father we get very little of him other than his demand that his family accept Belle and lavish the same on her as they would on their own.  Although we see that Belle is offered as much as was socially possible we yet wonder what her father and mother may or may not have been as we can only imagine.  The social cruelty that exists then is still evident in our world today.  Yet, when you see that this young woman yearns for acceptance and most of all love she manages to achieve her desire but not without the pain.  The story could have been more developed but didn't.  Perhaps it was too much to cramm into a cinematic tour.  It was enjoyable to watch and it was able to engage the empathy of the audience.  It just needed more and the characters needed more layers of themselves to project their true identify.  They came across as ""unfinished"" and we didn't get to fully immerse ourselves in their lives.",1409356800,,1241,4.4035087719298245
6436723,5,B00KO10QH2,Belle is a wonderful movie it will always be part of my collection. I have a white husband and two biracial daughters and I feel this movie will teach them a little about their heritage. For they can appreciate who they are. Belle didn't let her race or other people define who she was and she stood up for herself. She was proud to be biracial.  She was proud of both halves.

6436745,5,B00KO10QH2,"Prior to my viewing the trailer to this movie, I knew nothing about the historical person this movie is based on-- Dido Elizabeth Belle Lindsay (1761-1804).  Which is quite something, being I'm an avid fan of period dramas- especially of the Georgian/Regency era *1714 to 1830*, and despite the fact that I view countless BBC historical documentaries!  So you can imagine that I've been anticipating this film a great deal for about the past 3-4 months...

The vast majority of the actors I've seen prior to this, except stars Gugu Mbatha-Raw/""Dido"", Sarah Gadon/""Elizabeth"", and Sam Reid/""John Davinier"".  Needless to say, their portrayals didn't disappoint, and I look forward to seeing them again in future productions (esp. if it's a period drama)!

Overall, I really enjoyed pretty much everything about this production.  However, it should be noted that this is not a 100% accurate in its depiction of events & facts.  For instance....

**Semi-Spoilers**
- The film states Dido received 2,000 annually after her father died.  In actuality, he had 3 illegitimate children in total.  The son and other daughter received 1,000 each as an inheritance, but Dido did not (nor did she receive any assistance from her stepmother as indicated she should in his will).  Her great-uncle, Lord Mansfield, gave her an annual allowance of 30 & 10s, and upon his death she received 500 outright, a 100 annuity, and her continued freedom.  She also inherited 100 from Lady Margery Murray.
- Her cousin Elizabeth Murray was not as destitute as depicted (in fact, she may have been an heiress to her mothers fortune).  She received about 100 annually from her uncle, and inherited 10,000 upon his death.  She was married by the age of 20, long before Dido.
- John Davinier was never an up and coming law clerk/assistant.  He was just a gentleman's steward (personal assistant, who managed the domestic staff, etc.)
Also, at the end of the movie it says they had 2 children, when they actually had 3 sons (first twins, and then another son 2 years before she died).
- The brother suitors in the movie were never mentioned in what I've read.  Dido was never prior engaged.
- Lord Mansfield's best known judgement was Somersett's Case (Somerset v Stewart), in 1772.

Aside from this production, there's really no other film or documentary on this interesting historical character!  (Hopefully the BBC will release something on her in the future.)  But there is a brief dramatization about the Zong Massacre trial on Season/Series 2, episode 1 of  the BBC's ""Garrow's Law"".

In conclusion, I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys productions of this genre, especially those with a historical basis.
It also has a PG rating, which is getting harder to find these days!

6436754,5,B00KO10QH2,"This movie is a historically accurate portrayal of events taking place in England during the transatlantic slavetrade. In the midst of those realities, a beautiful love story emerges. A family love story and a romantic love story.  It's a story of those forced to decide whether to follow oppressive laws or change them. To let those laws dictate who is worthy of love, or let their hearts dictate who is worthy of that love. It's a psychological war of who is to be deemed ""human"" in the eyes of the law as well as in the eyes of people at that time, because laws were created to protect people.

I know a little about the true person this show is supposed to be about and her true story was not quite as ""rosey"" as the movie portrays. I have also had the good fortune to actually visit Scone Castle while on vacation this past May and saw the actual portrait (the one shown in the movie was a facsimile; however they did show the actual one at the end credits of the movie) and have read biographies about the ""Uncle"" who raised her because he played a significant historical role in the early beginnings of the ending of the slave trade.  The movie is good in that at least it presents a black person's history which few people will ever hear about in their school history books and American people of black descent really do need their stories and contributions to the world told beyond what happened to some of us during slavery.

The acting in this is fantastic (with the all-star cast it boasts, it's not a big surprise). Gugu Mbatha-Raw shines in the titular role, playing it with grace and spirit. And the chemistry between herself and her man? Well, what can I say... When he ardently declares his love for her...sigh, so romantic! ""Belle"" isn't all about romance, though. It also deftly addresses the role of women's rights during this age (which were almost non-existent), and slavery is taken on, as well.

It made me tear up a bit actually at one point which happens once in a blue moon while watching movies. I cannot recommend this movie enough. Not just because it based on an important historical event (that spurred me to do further reading). Not just because it was restrained yet commanding art. Not just because it was simply a pleasure to watch and riveting entertainment. But because Belle's struggles are not unique to herself, they are felt by anyone who ever feels the odd man out. Her dignity, class, intelligence and courage was frankly an inspiration. Exceptional art.

**After reading a few negative reviews, I feel compelled to add that it's true that Belle is nowhere near as gritty or as ""edgy"" as it could be considering its serious subject matter. It could have easily added much more explicit content. The thing is--it didn't need to. I think it told the story it was trying to tell without needing explicit content. It frankly would have been an entirely different movie if they did. One I would probably watch and enjoy--but a different movie.

The cinematography allows you to feel you are inside one of the parlors. The score is lovely. The script could have been a bit more subtle, but the dialogue written for the actors is very powerful.

The main reason to watch is the exquisite acting. Tom Wilkinson and Emily Watson are at their usual best. They give nuanced performances with believable moments of emotional vulnerability. Gugu Mabatha-Raw is a stunning surprise. She desperately wishes to fit in to her white community and loves her white relatives, despite their tendency to diminish her because of the color of her skin. The conflict of wanting to be loved, while struggling to get recognition for the value and equality of her African ancestors, captivates you from the onset. For me the best performance comes from Penelope Wilton. With very few lines, she's able to infuse subtle humor and amazing affection towards Dido and Elizabeth. She's supposed to be the insignificant spinster aunt, but provides moral direction and security to her motherless nieces. The most under appreciated actress of our time!",1408147200,6,1232,5.16

6436802,5,B00KO10QH2,"Belle is a hard movie not to love. It is a historical romance as well as a film about social justice.  Through circumstances, Belle (Gugu Mbatha-Raw), a ""mulatto"" whose father was of some means, is raised at the manor of her great uncle Lord Mansfield (Tom Wilkinson). Lord Mansfield has raised his grand niece in a proper fashion, but is aware of ""the nature of order"" and keeps her away from company at former dining. She is raised as a sister with her cousin Elizabeth (Sarah Gadon), whose father has less means. Belle acquires an inheritance and suitors while Elizabeth's financial status puts her at risk of being able to marry into her rank. Elizabeth points out to Belle, that all women are property.

Belle develops a mutual attraction for John Davinier (Sam Reid) a man beneath her in status, the lowly son of a vicar. He aspires to be an attorney. He is currently at odds with Lord Mansfield, the Chief Justice of the country. A court case concerning the sailing vessel ""Zong"" threw its cargo of slaves overboard claiming lack of supplies. The insurance company claims fraud and does not want to pay. The decision rests with Lord Mansfield, a traditionalist.

The film was well done. It will be hard for the Academy to ignore this one, especially in an off year of films. I couldn't help but be drawn to that moment in ""Lincoln"" when they repealed slavery, the decision of Brown vs. the Board of Education, or even the passage of the Civil Rights Bill.  Also a good performance by Emily Watson as Lady Mansfield and Tom Felton returns as a screen bad guy.

Worth adding to the collection.",1407974400,2,1598,4.6325088339222615

6436809,5,B00KO10QH2,"Belle is a story that pulls at the heartstrings of the audience and challenges each person to consider the value of human life. The themes in the picture are multiple: respect, acceptance, love, self-awareness, social status, social change, and justice. Above all, it is a true story based on a woman by the name of Dido Elizabeth Belle, the illegitimate, mixed-race daughter of a Navy Admiral, Sir John Lindsay.

The story begins with Belles father taking her as a young child to his uncles home, who is the 1st Earl of Mansfield (played by Tom Wilkinson). He has been commissioned to sail to the other side of the world and asks that they care for her while he is away. At first, they object to the idea, since the child is the product of a scandalous interracial affair between Sir Lindsay and a Negro slave. However, Belles father truly loves his daughter. With no other family but his uncle to care for her, he beseeches him to bring her up in the life deserving of his title and her bloodline. They relent, and Belle grows up in their household, with another girl her same age (played by Sarah Gadon), who is her cousin and uncles ward.

As Belle matures, enjoying her privileged life in the home of an aristocrat, it becomes obvious that her uncle and his wife do love her. However, there is still that social line of what is acceptable, such as being able to dine with the family. The lines that are drawn confuse her, but she accepts them.

When Belle learns more about the plight of slaves, she struggles with the reality of her identity. Eventually, she embraces the fact that her mother was Negro and an integral part of who she is as a human being.

Belles father dies and leaves her a substantial amount of money, but she is not encouraged by her uncle to marry. He believes that no one would accept her, even though she is well bred. Her cousin is introduced instead and begins her pursuit for a husband. In spite of her uncles disbelief that Belle could catch the eye of a man, she finds the attention of two very different individuals.

The class separation is starkly portrayed, as well as the plight of women who have no inheritance and must find a husband in order to survive. It also challenges the audience over the value of human life, the way we view others of different color, and the bravery of men and women who worked on bringing about social change. The fact that Belle was born and grew up in a family where her great uncle was the Lord Chief Justice, is by all rights providential. Their relationship forces him to examine his own conscience regarding slavery and human rights, influencing a decision in his court that changes the future of England. I found the film to be a moving story on many levels. When I shed a tear at the end and it deeply touches my emotions, it is well worth five stars.

Casting and direction were wonderful. Gugu Mbatha-Raw, who plays Belle, did an outstanding job of portraying the character in her struggles and self-realization. Tom Wilkinson was excellent as the Earl. Other names youll recognize  Miranda Richardson, Penelope Wilton (also known as Mrs. Crawley on Downton Abbey), Matthew Goode, and Emily Watson. Last of all, Sam Reid, who will sweep you off your feet, as Belles love interest.",1407801600,4,3259,4.5893470790378

6436815,5,B00KO10QH2,"Even if some of the details are changed for the sake of the drama, and others made up for lack of information, this is how the story (based on real people and events) should have happened. Other reviewers have compared Belle to Jane Austen films, but it resembles them only in the flawless portrayal of social class and manners of the period. None of Austen's novels, however, hinge on greater events than the lives and affairs of the main characters; whereas Belle's life and identity are shown as closely bound to the fate of slavery and British attitudes to it.
  All of the performances are excellent, with nobody over-acting or stealing scenes. The performance of the lead is especially moving. The costumes and sets are appropriately lush, and the cinematography unobtrusively draws you into the story. One very minor historical detail (since otherwise I'd have nothing to criticize): Belle's suitor, Ashford, tells her that his father has purchased a captain's commission in the navy for him. British navy commissions (unlike army commissions) were not sold. A British army officer could depend on soldiers being drilled in highly standardized procedures enforced by the noncoms. A British naval officer had to be competent in all the complex details of handling a sailing ship. So the only way to become one was to serve as a midshipman for years, then pass the very rigorous oral examination for lieutenant given by a panel of veteran naval captains.",1404000000,108,1459,5.0

6436817,5,B00KO10QH2,"The central theme of this film emerges only after it is well underway, and it involves the courageous and outspoken efforts of Dido (Belle) and the young man who loves her to persuade her guardian/uncle?/Papa, who is Lord Chief Justice of England, to make an important ruling on the basis of the whole truth, and humane values, rather than the ostensible law narrowly conceived, and facts as (falsely) presented. This involved an insurance claim involving the ""loss"" of a cargo of slaves who were  thrown overboard from a ship. The unfolding of this story is intensely involving for an alert audience, as well as for the historical characters at the time. The film is also about racial prejudice and It is  a satisfying love story involving an interracial pair of young people. Incidentally it shows Tom Felton in as unsavory a role as Malfoy in Harry Potter, and Tom Courtenay in a fine performance of the Lord Chief Justice. The essentials of the story are based on historical fact. A superb film, beautifully photographed, which I saw twice in the theatre and am looking forward to seeing again on DVD.",1403654400,8,1105,4.810526315789474
6436818,4,B00KO10QH2,"Directed by Amma Asante (A Way of Life) from a screenplay by Misan Sagay, Belle is a beautifully rendered historical romance, reminiscent of many Jane Austen romances of the period.  The performances are first class, the cinematography and costumes are lush and detailed, the flow of the story well-paced and balanced between its romantic and historical elements, and the music adds wonderfully to the feel of the film.  But that said, this is a film that should be considered more of an imaginative - and highly embellished - story than an accurate recounting of actual historical events.

The film begins with a young British naval officer, Captain Sir John Lindsay (Matthew Goode), in Jamaica, apparently meeting a very young girl for the first time:  his mixed-race daughter by an African woman with whom he'd had an affair. In short order he tells the girl that he's taking her to ""the life you were born to have"", which we quickly learn means taking her to England to be raised by his uncle and aunt, Lord and Lady Mansfield (Tom Wilkinson and Emily Watson), high-ranking members of the British aristocracy who have no children of their own but who are already raising another grand-niece of similar age named Elizabeth. The Mansfield's take the girl - whose full name is Dido Elizabeth Belle - into their home, opting to call her Dido since they already have an Elizabeth, raising the two cousins almost as if they were sisters. Almost, but not quite, as becomes apparent in the film that having a mixed-race member of the family presented certain social difficulties in Georgian English aristocratic society.

Time passes quickly and soon the girls are young women, coming of an age where they were expected to make their entry into society, the first step in fulfilling the role for women of the time: arranging for a suitable marriage to be made. Despite their status of being wards of the highly respected Lord Mansfield - who was also a judge in the highest court in the land, both women face certain challenges. For Dido (a superb Gugu Mbatha-Raw), the challenges are all too obvious - an illegitimate mixed-race woman hardly made for a suitable, let alone respectable, match in a society where purity of breeding was nearly an obsession. For Elizabeth (Sarah Gadon) the challenge was less controversial but no less daunting - having only a pittance of a dowry and no claim to lands or incomes, at a time when a woman's prospects for a suitable marriage were in direct proportion to the amount of wealth she brought with her.

Dido has long been aware of her unusual status within the Mansfield household - too high to eat with the servants but not high enough to eat with any guests the Mansfields might have. Her entry into British society only accentuates the differences between her and everyone else. As one prospective match observes, ""One does not make a wife of the exotic."" However in a turn of irony, Dido's prospects for marriage are actually higher than Elizabeth's because Dido's father left her an inheritance and an income, and she quickly learns that some gentlemen's need for money can overcome their qualms about her skin and racial heritage. But at least one young man - John Davinier (Sam Reid), a vicar's son aspiring to be a lawyer - sees Dido for her other qualities, including her intelligence and beauty. And it is from him that she learns of Lord Mansfield's upcoming role as judge in a highly followed court case resulting from the drowning of 142 slaves - men, women and children - by the captain and crew of the slave ship Zong, all news of which had been kept carefully away from her. All of these things cause Dido to start questioning the state of the society in which she finds herself, and what her role in that society should be.

The historical elements that underpin the story are centered around two things.  The first is a famous 1779 painting, the first of its kind, showing Dido Elizabeth Belle and her cousin Lady Elizabeth Murray portrayed as equals at a time when black or mulatto images in art were always portrayed as lesser and largely ornamental figures in art.  The second was the infamous Zong Massacre of 1781 and the subsequent court decision of 1783 that dealt with the legal issues resulting from it.  Beyond that though, most of the events of the film amount to fiction, with the writers pretty much making up most of the details where nothing is actually known and then changing others that were known just to fit the story's narrative.

Highly recommended as a romantic and period film that highlights the social and legal issues of the time, with the caution that it should not be taken as actual history.",1403395200,107,4676,4.753390875462392
6436819,5,B00KO10QH2,"Belle is based on the true story of Dido Elizabeth Belle, the illegitimate daughter of Admiral John Lindsay and an enslaved African woman.

As a child she was sent to live with her father's uncle William Murray, 1st Earl of Mansfield, who raised her as a free young gentlewoman at Kenwood House. That same Lord Mansfield, in his capacity as Lord Chief Justice, was later called on to rule in the case of the Zong Massacre, a controversial court case that followed the deaths of approximately 142 enslaved Africans on board the slave ship Zong in 1781. The owners of the ship went on to make a claim to their insurers for the loss of the slaves, one that was refused on claims that the slaves (many of which were diseased) were deliberately murdered after being deemed worth more dead than alive.

This is the backdrop of Dido's story, one that provides the film's climax and is very much linked to her journey to find a place in the world. As such, there are two main (though interconnected) threads running throughout the film: that of Gugu Mabatha-Raw's eponymous Dido Belle negotiating high society, and the court proceedings surrounding Lord Mansfield's ruling on the Zong trial.

Toward the end of the film the focus is just as much on Lord Mansfield's moral crisis regarding the Zong Massacre as it is on Dido's awareness of her quasi-privilege and growing sense of identity. But the greater part of the film remains with Dido, her love story with her uncle's student John Davinier, her relationship with her cousin Elizabeth, and her struggle to find a place in society.

Since the film was inspired by the 1779 portrait of Dido and Elizabeth, they are very much the focal point of the movie. I went out in search of the portrait on-line just to get a better look, and it is quite a striking picture, with the composed and seated Elizabeth contrasted with the more spritely and active-looking Dido. According to art studies, the fact that Elizabeth's hand rests upon Dido's waist is a suggestion of affection and equality (rather than a depiction of her being pushed away, as it appears at first sight).

Gugu Mabatha-Raw's is a lovely actress, and throughout the course of the film she captures Dido's confusion, yearning, sadness and humanity in negotiating a world that doesn't necessarily reject her, but doesn't really have a place for her either. You're never entirely sure how she's going to react to any given situation, for though she's perfectly comfortable giving orders to a multitude of white servants, she is rendered awkward and speechless when coming face-to-face with a black woman who works in the family's London abode.

Tom Wilkinson steps up to second base as Lord Mansfield, and gives a very dignified, low-key performance as an aging man whose fires are gradually being extinguished, weary with the state of the world and yet whose love for Dido is something that causes him pain and joy in equal measure. Ultimately his court ruling is framed as him choosing to do right by her as well as following his own conscience, and their held gaze after the verdict is probably the most heart-rending part of the film.

Sarah Gadon balances Elizabeth's sweet nature with a certain amount of ditziness without going overboard in either direction, and Miranda Richardson, Emily Waston and Penelope Wilson all have supporting roles. They're old pros, but they know the film belongs to Gugu and don't try to steal her spotlight, though Watson and Wilson are each given an affecting scene in which the former appeals to her husband on the Zong Massacre ruling, and the latter recalls a lost love from her youth. It appears that Tom Felton is well and truly typecast as the upper-class jerk, but hey - it's not like he's not good at the role, and there's a moment in which where he comes across as truly frightening, above and beyond anything Draco Malfoy was capable of.

And for anyone who just loves Jane Austen-esque period films, there's an abundance of beautiful costumes, set-design and locations to provide the requisite eye candy. It's a beautiful-looking movie, and well worth the watch.",1402617600,252,4113,4.832386363636363

I found the film interesting and entertaining on many levels.  The painting  which inspired the film is not a great work of art  as such, but its historical and familial significance is beyond dispute. I saw it over 35 years ago, and knowing nothing of the relationship of the two people in it, was struck by the detail and personality given to the woman of color,( especially one in a painting with a white ""lady of quality"") who was not treated by the artist as a servant or mere ornament.
