Absolutely love watching this version of the Up Series and particularly love this particular one - 7 Up as the children are wise beyond their years and had seen so much at such a young age in apartheid South Africa.
Wanting to obtain 14 Up South Africa but seems its only available on You Tube.
Have 21 Up on DVD and am looking forward to the release of 28 Up.",1412812800,,406,4.151898734177215

7833995,5,6302983606,"This film is an amazing look at 1992 South Africa as Apartheid falls through the eyes of 7 year-olds from various socioeconomic backgrounds. This is part of a series that follows up every 7 years to see what the future has for these children.
  The first part of the film sets the stage as more light hearted questions are asked to let you know these are really 7 year-olds. The second part opens up with more serious questions that are honslty answered by these amazing kids. The stark contrast between the different kids from different backgrounds really puts everything into perspective.
  I honestly believe this is one of the Best Documentary's of all time. I would highly recomend it to ANYONE!",1216771200,,700,4.760330578512397
