2555625,4,B000F9T70K,"All it took was the 2:30am syndication slot on my local independent channel back home for me to get hooked on this show as a 16 year old.  How it caught my eye back then was a mystery to me, but the years make it clear why it's my favorite all-time show.  It's just a pinnacle of American television in my book.  And over the years, the offerings for the show on video have been notoriously few and lacking in quality.  So much so that I paid an arm and a leg for an import version of the Special Selection releases in Japan on laserdisc (don't ask how much I paid!).  There's just something plain wrong with seeing Japanese subtitles below a mileage sign for the next town as the main group leave the cattle for a break.  After years of asking for it, now the show has finally been transferred to DVD.  All they need to do now is release the other seasons.  My only beef is the price point, they're asking a lot of money from fans for these, especially given the existence of the blu-ray format.",1153958400,16,996,4.232804232804233

2555627,5,B000F9T70K,"Ah, teeny lass time!  When I came to visit my cousins they were always on about Mr. Favor.  They would drag out the cap-pistols and stick horses and play Rawhide.  No one wanted be Rowdy Yates.  They always forced my younger brother David to play Rowdy and he'd cry.  Everyone wanted to be Mr. Favor.  Handsome, sexy voiced Eric Fleming was a star on the rise.  We saw him in various Sci-Fi flicks in the 50s like that horrid thing with Zaa-Zaa as Queen of Outer Space, and some nifty who dun its, but it was as Ms. Favor he was rising to the top.  Hard to recall gravelly-voiced Eastwood was considered a wimp!

Favor was filming a flick in the Amazon during summer break and drowned.  Hollywood lost a rising star and Rawhide lost Mr. Favor, dooming the series.  It lumbered on with Rowdy taking over as trail boss for a time, only the series lack the force without the dominating presence of Fleming.  It would be curious if we could turn back time and alter events--one wonders if Eastwood would have finally come out of Fleming's shadow and become the superstar he did had Fleming not died.

The series ran for 8 years, and holds up well.  There were so many westerns during this period, and when you go back to view them, they are sadly quite dated.  NOT Rawhide.  The strength of the acting, the vision of the producers and directors, kept Rawhide popular back then, but also gives you stories which stands the test of time.  Rawhide dates like a fine wine.

You also have the treat of see fading stars and up and coming stars in the stories.

It just doesn't get any better than this.",1153785600,22,1592,4.40893470790378

2555629,5,B000F9T70K,"Rawhide is the fourth longest running Western on television.  It is one of those timeless shows that just gets better with time.

2555630,5,B000F9T70K,"""What do you think this is? A beauty contest?! Now butt those saddles!!!!,"" growled Trailboss Gil Favor (Eric Fleming) to his band of cattle drovers during an episode of Rawhide.

it was lines like these delivered by Fleming with such vim and vigor that really made Rawhide such an outstanding western. Fleming was great as The Boss because he was an imperfect man. Sure he stood by his convictions and always battled the bad guys but he wasn't always right and he didn't always win. He was a believable character who often got down and dirty and came out bloody along with the rest of his crew. He was a man's man and a lady's man all wrapped into one.

His co-star was Clint Eastwood as the handsome, yet sometimes goofy Ramrod Rowdy Yates. I really liked Clint in this role because he actually played a good and decent guy who always tried to do the right thing. And in later seasons he evolved into more of the tough guy that would later define his movie career characters.

The rest of the ensemble inlcuded Paul Brinegar as the wily old camp cook ""Wishbone"", Sheb Wooley as dependable trail scout Pete Nolan, and Steve Raines as drover Jim Quince who could sing ""Skip to my Loo"" with the best of them. Rocky Shahan was the big and loveable drover Joe Scarlett and Robert Cabal was the horse rangler ""Hey Soos"" (obviously the network did not want to put ""JESUS"" in the credits!). and finally James Murdoch played the ""slow-minded"" cook's louse Mushy.

In later seasons the cast went through other incarnations. Sheb Wooley would be replaced briefly by Charles Gray as the maverick Clay Forrester. the final season would see Fleming and most of the cast gone and have John Ireland and Raymond St. Jaques join new Trail Boss Rowdy Yates for the series final ride into the sunset.

The stories were mostly compelling and the characters were likeable and worked well together. in a lot of ways, Rawhide was exactly like Star Trek. Favor was Captain Kirk, Rowdy was Spock, and Wishbone was Dr. McCoy. instead of a starship you had a cattle drive seeking out new frontiers and new adventures every week. if you watch both series you will notice the similarities and a number of the Star Trek writers (Gene Coon and Fred Freiberger) worked on both series.

the bottom line is that if you like classic westerns you will really enjoy Rawhide. it is a fun and gritty and interesting show with great characters and stories.",1146873600,75,2417,4.6223776223776225
2555631,5,B000F9T70K,"I've been waiting a long time for this one to come out in a boxed set.  Rawhide was one of the finest of early TV Westerns--with an excellent cast and exceptional writing.  Somewhat like Wagon Train, it relied on guest stars for many of it's stories, but it also featured a wonderful core cast--headed by the really marvelous Eric Fleming.  And what a delight to watch the young Clint Eastwood grow into his role as the seasons progressed. And unlike many series that ran for many years, Rawhide had very little cast turnover.  Sheb Wooley (of  ""Flying Purple People Eater"" fame) came and went once or twice but the rest of the cast, even background players, remained relatively intact until the final season.  After watching this in sydication, I'm looking forward to seeing uncut episodes--and hope that season one will be followed by the entire run.",1146441600,29,852,4.801369863013699

2555633,5,B000F9T70K,"I am thrilled that they will soon be releasing the first season of Rawhide.  Growing up in the sixties, most of my favorite T.V. shows were westerns and back then they imparted great values and contained good role models.

Just think of the lead characters in those great old westerns: Cheyenne, Paladin, Matt Dillon, Lucas McCain, Gil Favor; the list goes on and on.  Each and every one of them had personalities all their own, but they shared a couple of common unshakable qualities; they had a strong sense of morality and a code of ethics.

Todays heroes are politically correct and ""morally complex"".  Translation:  They're decent people but will skim the edge of dishonesty if it suits their needs and purpose.  You didn't see that sort of ideological compromise with the Matt Dillons of yesteryear we grew up with.  No sir, they saw the world in black and white, not muddy shades of gray.  They recognized the good in men but were quick to realize that evil is as evil does.  They drew a line in the sand they wouldn't cross and by god, right was right and wrong was wrong.

Is it wrong to wish these values on our leaders, role models and politicians of today?

2555634,5,B000F9T70K,"Thoughts from various sources

from the VHS sleeve from CBS 'The Pitchwagon'

-At a time when TV westerns were either adapted from radio programs or based upon completely ficticious characters, Rawhide was a rare exception.  Week after week, for seven years, Rawhide invited us on a historically accurate 1860's cattle drive from San Antonio, Texas to Sedalia, Kansas.  Absolutely everything about Rawhide was first class.  The rich, sprawling, hour-long episodes allowed characters to develop and powerful stories to unfold. The music, which included a hit theme performed by Frankie Laine, was written by Hollywood legend Dimitri Tiomkin.  And best of all, the brilliant ensemble cast introduced Clint Eastwood in the role that made him famous-the young ramrod, Rowdy Yates.

-Rawhide, considered to be the best written and best directed Western on television. For seven seasons, Fleming portrayed an honest, independent, strong, intelligent, and heroic cowboy in the tradition of the American West. He embodied the mythic hero whose sense of justice and morality overrode all other considerations. Fleming's presence as Favor was so dominant that it centered the entire show and provided the base around which all the other characters revolved. Additionally, the character was provided with a personal history that enhanced his leadership. In four episodes featuring Favor's interactions with children (Incident of the Fish Out of Water, The Boss's Daughters, Incident of the Hostages, and El Hombre Bravo), his warmth, sensitivity, and overt compassion are particularly evident, adding depth, realism, and a gentleness to the character. The series was mostly shot in Nogales, Arizona and the authenticity of the trail drive was staggering - enough to win The Western Heritage Award from the National Cowboy Hall of Fame four years in a row. The award named Rawhide the outstanding program of its genre for excellence in depicting the West.

-Television and the home entertainment revolution of the 80's and 90's have made permanently accessible to us small-screen recreations of America's frontier history - the Wild West. Viewers over a certain age have not forgotten and could never abandon the feelings stirred by Rawhide.

-This was not only one of the finest of the TV Westerns, it was perhaps the grittiest.

-I dearly love Eric Fleming and I never hear Clint Eastwood talk about Eric Fleming or say anything nice about him-Eric had a sad childhood and he was a sculptor and a painter. Even though Eric Fleming is dead I wish in some way they could create a tribute to him. He was a very gifted actor.

-[The series was very popular in Europe and reached nearly fanatical levels in Japan]

--The series is in black and white so the cover artwork should not be in colo, but it's great they have started with this season 1 set.  Season 2-8 Please! Fans of Rawhide have had to wait 47 years-almost half a century for this series measured from the start date of 1959(as of 2006), they have waited so long to start making the series available that much of the original fan base will never see these remastered episodes. There have also been several attempts to bring the series out so hopefully they'll release all 8 seasons. This is a gritty series so don't get the wrong idea from the artwork which makes it almost look like they're getting ready for a picnic. The details in this series are incredible and Gil is absolutely amazing. It is something special to hear the way Gil talks and to hear his voice. Eric was the reason for Rawhide's success and we will never forget him. Eric Fleming was a remarkable man. There will never be another man like Eric Fleming.

Many thanks for bringing out this first Season. Seasons 2-8 on DVD Please!",1144713600,187,3747,4.993579454253611

2555746,5,B000F9T70K,"The 1950s and 1960s were a time of change throughout America. Electronic televisions were the hi-tech of those days. And a generation was brought up watching the 'boob tube.' Much of the programming back then was comprised of westerns, much as Cop shows dominate present day.

I can recall several westerns of that period, each of which I enjoyed.
Bonanza
Paladin
Maverick
Branded
Wyatt Earp
Bat Masterson
Wanted Dead or Alive
Laredo
Wagon Train
Gunsmoke
Rawhide

I enjoyed them all, but, I plunked my money down to buy only Maverick and Rawhide. Further, if you want a western that has the ring of truth, wherein the characters actually grow as the seasons pass, Rawhide is the hands-down choice. Rawhide was such a great original, as was Wagon Train, the Gene Roddenberry often was heard to say Star Trek was the Sci-Fi Wagon Train or Rawhide.

Eric Fleming, in the role of Gil Favor was the ideal drover. He was born for this...just as James Garner was born for the role of Bret Maverick. The writing for his role was outstanding, but it was Fleming who brought those words to life in such a harmonized manner.

Clint Eastwood, not a household name back then, was believable as a sometimes competent, sometimes flippant, drive ramrod (cowboy talk for foreman). Eastwood was at his best when he was a fish out of water.

Paul Brinegar as Wishbone and James Murdoch provided light relief that prevented the show from being to dark and dreary. Sure, both roles tended towards slapstick cartoon characters, but the comic actions were welcome. Brinegar, I don't think, ever was able to escape his typecast, but I like to think he was okay with that.

Sheb Wooley, a one hit wonder with The Purple People Eater, was a perfect fit for Pete Nolan. So was Steve Raines as Jim Quince.

What I loved about Rawhide was that each character, portrayed by seemingly real people instead of actors, seemed like they actually could be driving a herd of 3,000 head of cattle to market.

If you are wanting to understand how my generation, the Baby Boomers of America, you would find television westerns of TV's Golden Years a terrific resource.

2555784,5,B000F9T70K,"Most people who like t.v. Westerns already know about Rawhide and have been enjoying these programs on DVD.  This review is an appeal to those who do not normally watch Westerns.  As avid viewers know, every genre of television (and movies) has classics that transcend the material of that genre.  We can all name classic comedies, police shows, doctor shows, etc. that we would recommend to one and all.  Well, Rawhide has me convinced that it belongs next to any of the true classics that you might collect just because of its greatness.  Rawhide is a show for everyone, a show with great acting, stupendous guest stars, a strong narrative focus, and one darn great theme song!

It's the stories though that keep me watching and will likely keep you watching as well.  It is a 'journey' program, a program where the main characters are traveling from place to place and encounter troubles and new people wherever they go.  It is akin to a show like The Fugitive in this way.  And like The Fugitive is uses the locales wisely and effectively.  You just never know who or what will turn up next.  And since the show is character driven, it gives the main cast and its guest stars the opportunity to really shine- and shine they do.

A show like Rawhide might seem old-fashioned by today's standards, with shows like Dexter, Breaking Bad, etc. out there (and those are fine shows in their way), but with its strong stories, its moral base, its attention to detail, this is a show for the entire family, a show, I hope, that might inspire discussion and give all of us food for thought.  But make no mistake, Rawhide is about as entertaining as one could want, and it is for this reason I recommend the show for everyone: for Western lovers, of course, but also for anyone who relishes classic television and the high standards these classics have achieved.",1349740800,,1855,4.636085626911315

2555821,4,B000F9T70K,"Compared with other TV westerns, ""Rawhide"" is above average, which may be damning with faint praise.  However, the viewer should never assume that the series resembled the actual West much at all.  In fact, there are very few westerns that do, and many of those are the so-called spaghetti western.  Other examples of realism are rare indeed.  Here are a few of the digressions, without regard to level of importance:

(1) Young women are too clean, too pretty, and wearing bustiers and clothes that are too well tailored.  Mad Magazine commented long ago that if women in the old west had looked like the women in western movies, the wild west would have been a lot wilder.

(2) The men are wearing the wrong hats, the wrong clothes, are too clean and clean shaved, have capped teeth, almost never have their trousers tucked into their boots, etc.  Look at the photos of the actual cowboys of the era if you doubt this.  Cowboys especially were a seedy lot.

(3) The towns are far too neat.  Despite the myriad horses and cattle passing through, the streets are remarkably clear of manure.  There are no flies. The streets are level, packed sand, without ruts.

(4) There are more gunfights in westerns than there ever were in reality.  Six guns were remarkably inaccurate, except at close range.  Shooting the gun out of a foe's hand was pure luck.  Fast draws artists were killed by slower, careful aimers.  Most residents were not fighting but were working to stay alive--just like now.

(5) Saloon fights in westerns almost always had someone crashing through a window without receiving a scratch, or getting a whisky bottle broken over their head without being killed, or having a wooden chair crashed over them, or getting hit with a haymaker, or, or, or.  Anyone who has seen two men brawl in reality knows that someone always got hurt, and one solid punch usually ended it.

(6) Saloons were in reality almost always holes in the wall, and the soiled doves who worked them had names such as Squrrel Tooth Alice.

(7) It seldom rains and almost never ever snows in westerns.  Much of the scenery looks suspiciously like the deserts of California, near Hollywood.  I've seen the very same boulders in numerous westerns, serials and even sci-fi films.  N.B.  Kansas did not have tall mountains in the background.

Well, you get the point.  These flaws may seem petty to those who are weaned on western movies, but the inconsistancies mar the verisimilitude.  The real west was far more interesting than the idealized version of the movies.  Too bad it isn't shown.

""Rawhide"" is about a cattle drive from Texas to a Kansas railhead, with the cowboys getting sidetracked constantly to have adventures that have
nothing to do with their occupation, a job that required their undivided attention.  Moving a large heard hundreds of miles was a 24-hour per day job.

There are some wonderful books by men who actually participated in the drives.  Read those to know how it really was.  See the books by Andy Adams, for example.",1289779200,6,3028,4.770712909441233

2555823,4,B000F9T70K,"Considering the prominence to which Clint Eastwood has risen as a star and director, it's not at all surprising that this series, which provided his breakout role (Texas trail hand Rowdy Yates), should have made it to DVD.  Marketing, of course, dictates that his role be emphasized, when in fact he was what used to be called the ""male ingenue"" or ""juvenile lead,"" a still-inexperienced young man with a weakness for pretty girls who's being taught the business by the man with whom he was co-equally billed, Eric Fleming as his not-always-sympathetic, tough-as-nails boss, Gil Favor.  Favor and Rowdy are the top hands on a long cattle drive from San Antonio to Sedalia, Mo., backed up by a crew that includes scout Pete Nolan (Sheb Wooley), wiry flank rider Jim Quince (Steve Raines), powerful swing man Joe Scarlet (Rocky Shahan), and ""the man who can make or break a drive,"" the cantankerous wagon cook Wishbone (Paul Brinegar), assisted by his slow-witted ""louse,"" Mushy (James Murdock), who says of himself that ""Thinkin's one thing I fight against.""  As they make their way northward over the endless plains of Texas (the season ends without their reaching the Red River), they contend with weather, wolves, water shortages, outlaws, land-jealous farmers, and assorted human beings, good and bad, whom they encounter along the trail.

The background music is a high point, with certain motifs popping up regularly.  The picture quality is excellent, although I find that I have to boost the sound almost to the maximum to be able to hear properly (your TV, or player, may not require this).

Apart from a certain amount of inaccuracy with regard to guns, this series doesn't seem to be quite as confused historically as many Westerns of its day, and is pretty consistent about its date, which is probably 1868 (shown on the grave marker of one drover killed in a stampede), although there are a couple of points at which this is called into question (in ""Incident of the Judas Trap"" Nolan says it's ""five years"" since the War, and ""Incident of the Dry Drive"" has young Jim Hoad just back from six years of schooling back East, which wasn't likely to have occurred during the conflict).  Tidbits about the major characters' pasts (especially those of Favor, Rowdy, and Pete) surface regularly, and there are frequent references to the recent war.

2555826,5,B000F9T70K,"Throughout my childhood my television watching was dominated by two types of show, westerns and secret agents. Have Gun Will Travel, Gunsmoke, Wagon Train, Cheyenne to name but a few were particular favourites but the one which has withstood the ravages of time the most has been Rawhide.

Others will cite the large and looming prescence of Clint Eastwood as a major reason for this durability but for the me the success of this particular show likes elsewhere.

While the typical western concentrated on the wild west aspects of gunslinging, bank robbery, Indians, etc the plots of Rawhide are of a much different origin. To be sure there are aspects of those experiences but the backdrop and textures of Rawhide are much richer and complex.

For example, the black and white views of right and wrong out west are much more of shades of gray with the show. There is a greater degree of complexity involved and differing perspectives. People make mistakes and come to realise that. Older, wiser heads prevail over more hotheaded, reactive ones.

Similarly, Rawhide deals with issues which often would not be deemed worthy in the typical western. there is a greater human touch involved. Often it is easier to understand a perception of fear which engenders violent action as a pre-emptive strike than to see all of the protagonists as men of deliberate action.

The notion of lawlessness is also superceeded by a sense of the growth and limits of the law in the face of challenges, both physical and political, from people who live outside of the traditional lawkeeping forces of military or much later sherrif's personnel.

Character development is another understated aspect of this show where we see the community of trail herders grow with each passing mile. The almost father-son relationship between Gil favour and Rowdy Yates which results in the latter growing from a young hothead to an older wiser and more mature second in command is intersting to observe through passing episodes.

What I am trying to say is that Rawhide takes a broader view of the west than almost every other show and it is that which has sustained it's popularity over the years.

A great series which I am happy to watch over again.",1256428800,5,2217,4.877659574468085
2555827,5,B000F9T70K,"Being that I'm only 37-years old, I am in the minority that did not bear witness to the show when it originally aired in '59 up to '66, but I'm glad some 50-years later I discovered this gem of celluloid history.

As Clint Eastwood if my favorite living actor I was naturally drawn to this because, frankly, I'd never seen any of the episodes. It's bad enough modern television can't hold a candle to the old days, but to play the same insipid shows in never-ending loops as stations are won't to do is criminal. I believe the Halmark channel or ME-TV shows the occasional Rawhide but this set is a wonderful addition to the home library. I have never had more than a passing interesting westerns, be in television or big-feature films, but Rawhide is a moment in time gloriously contained on a terrific DVD set. All pains have been taken to retain the original feel while modernizing ever-slightly in the mastering process. I'm also introduced to the great Eric Fleming, Sheb Wooley, Paul Brinegar, as well as a myriad of other cast members that are fun and a part of my psyche now and forever.

I was never a ""Bonanza guy"" or anything close, but Rawhide just has the feel of real trials and tribulations not saturated in mediocrity or ""same-old-same-old"" rhetoric. Mr. Fliming as Gilbert Favor, the trail boss, was nothing short of superb and Eastwood as ramrod Rowdy Yates is just drenched with great characterization, talent and honing of skills for future endeavors (anyone not spotting the ""Harry Calahan"" grimace ten years beforehand in some episodes is missing something amazing). The overall surrounding/supporting cast is so natural and tight that it truly integrates you as one of the drovers; You care about the characters and the plots as if they were your own, the true mark of great television.

I cannot recommend this set any higher than my peers before me have, but thanks for allowing me to spout off, so to speak. I'm so sorry I missed the original run but I forever have it in my personal library and implore all of you to check out what the old west was like for the men who fed our families.",1245801600,3,2114,4.632
2555828,5,B000F9T70K,"The series ran for eight seasons on the CBS network on Friday nights, from January 9, 1959 to January 4, 1966, with a total of 217 episodes, all filmed and broadcast in black and white. It was produced and sometimes directed by Charles Marquis Warren who also produced early episodes of Gunsmoke. Warren based Rawhide on the movie Cattle Empire that he directed in 1958 and for which Endre Bohem was a screenwriter and Paul Brinegar, Steve Raines and Rocky Shahan were actors; all also worked in Rawhide. Its premiere episode reached the top 20 in the Nielsen Ratings. It rose steadily in popularity until, towards the end of the series run, it was one of America's top ten shows[citation needed]. Rawhide was the fifth-longest-running American TV western, beaten only by nine years of The Virginian and Wagon Train, fourteen years of Bonanza, and twenty years of Gunsmoke.

The show had a gruelling schedule, being mostly weekly with a 3-4 month break between seasons. After the first season of 22 episodes, seasons 2-7 were 30 episodes. Often the only way the lead actors could get a break was if they were said to be off on business or whatever. On rare occasions, the show would feature a small number of the actors and some misfortune, maybe in a town, which would give the others time off.
In an early show, the date is given as 1869. It is given that there are 20-25 riders looking after 3,000 head of cattle. Gil Favor revealed this is about the maximum manageable size for a herd of cows. This cattle drive begins in San Antonio, Texas, and makes its way along the Sedalia Trail (Sedalia, the final destination, is in Missouri about 50 miles east from Kansas City). The herd is estimated to be worth about $50-60,000 if sold at market and represents a pool of animals from 200 owners. The Trail Boss carries a considerable sum of cash for all necessities and all possible emergencies. Pay was a dollar a day and often the drovers would go through six months pay in days at the end of the trail, often gambling and drinking all of it away. There were also women to help them spend the money. Riding ""drag"" was often a punishment since it was behind the herd, so you'd pick up all their dust. Drives had a ""Remuda"" which was a pool of extra horses since if something happened to a man's horse, he would be no good without an instant replacement.

The episode would be introduced, usually by some words from Gil Favor but sometimes by others. The typical Rawhide story involved drovers, portrayed by Eric Fleming (Trail Boss Gil Favor) and Clint Eastwood (ramrod Rowdy Yates), coming upon people on the trail and getting drawn into solving whatever problem they presented or were confronting. Sometimes one of the members of the cattle drive or some of the others would venture into a nearby town and encounter some trouble or other from which they needed to be rescued. Rowdy Yates was a young hothead in the earliest episodes and Favour had to keep a tight rein on him. Favor was often a hard man and there were a few times when people including Yates mutinied under him after working too hard or after a good tongue lashing. He had to fight some times and mostly but not always, won. Some of the stories were obviously easier in production terms but the peak form of the show was convincing and naturalistic, and sometimes brutal. Its situations could range from parched plains to anthrax, ghostly riders to wolves, cattle raiding, bandits, murderers, and so forth. A problem on such drives was the constant need for water, and the scout spent much of his time looking for it, sometimes finding water holes, even rivers had dried up. In some ways it was similar to the TV series Wagon Train that debuted in 1957.

The series was not afraid to face tough issues. Robert Culp played an ex-soldier on the drive who had become dangerously addicted to morphine. Jesus (Hey Soos) being Mexican faced racism a number of times. There was still anger left over from the Civil War which had ended only four years earlier. The Poco Tiempo episode reveals that Rowdy's father's name was Dan, that Rowdy came from S.W. Texas and that he went off to war at 16. Trail Boss Favor had been a Confederate Captain in the war. There were still Indians about, though often not that wild, some still wanted cattle as payment for going through their land. There were some rough-tough people in the shows and Gil Favor was tortured by having his face held near a fire in one episode. In another, people had ""the plague"" and guns were used to enforce quarantine. Though towns liked the drover's money, they did not like them coming into town in numbers and getting drunk. There was also cattle rustlers in many different forms.

In episode 67 Incident Near the Promised Land, the cattle drive finally reached Sedalia (for the first time in the series). Unusually, episode 68 continues on from that, where the cattle have been sold and the men celebrate in town and decide on their futures with even Favor thinking of leaving the business. Instead of the usual ending where Gil Favor tells his men to: ""Head 'em up! Move 'em out!"" and the cattle move off, this episode had the end titles over a view of a Sedalia Street. Episode 69 sees Gil Favor visiting his two daughters, Gillian and Maggie who live with their Aunt Elena in Philadelphia. Episode 70 and a number of the men are back together and heading back to San Antonio about 650 miles away, with a herd of horses (used in the titles instead of cattle). Episode 71 sees a new cattle drive ready to go but the owner of 1600 of the cattle wants to be in charge so Favor reluctantly signs on as a ramrod, but after some problems, Favor is boss against the end of the show. These five episodes made up one storyline instead of the usual single episode stories which could have been set anywhere in the West.

The show featured stage and location. Location was probably not far from the studios and made the best use of maybe 100 cattle. Scenes in camp and situations between men were often stage and though fairly well done with scenery and a painted backdrop, the ground was just too flat to be real.",1234310400,3,6137,4.5856102003642984

2555830,4,B000F9T70K,"Rawhide was an excellent Western that ran on CBS 1958-1965. This wouldn't have been my first choice for a TV Western though, that would've been Maverick if Warner Bros. will ever release it. Rawhide is a CBS/Paramount product so it's not their fault. Rawhide was the launching pad for Clint Eastwood's career. He had been around for several years acting in movies ranging from bit roles to substantial roles but never actually being in a major featured role. Some of his credits from the fifties include the movies Tarantula & Francis the Talking Mule. Clint Eastwood learned many things while on Rawhide: acting & directing being the main two. It was unfortunate though, Hollywood wouldn't give Eastwood an opportunity to be a leading man, he had to go to Italy & star in three spaghetti Westerns for Sergio Leone before he would get his chance in America.

The TV series actually stars Eric Fleming as Gil Favor, trail boss. Fleming wasn't a household name either, he had also been around Hollywood for a while, not really getting somewhere either. He had starred in some grade C movies but stardom eluded him. It's unlikely that anyone remembers Fleming other than viewers of Rawhide or movie buffs. It's for that reason that Eastwood is more featured on the covers, he is, after all, the most recognizable face from the series.

The DVD set features all 22 episodes of the first (actually a half) season of Rawhide. The picture quality is excellent but bonus material is scant. The bonus material consists of production notes for each episode &  a short Clint Eastwood biography, one per disc. Rawhide also featured Paul Brinegar as Wishbone & Sheb Wooley as Pete Nolan,both were good friends of Eastwood who would later use them in a few of his movies. Robert Cabal is in one episode as Hey Soos (which just goes to show that Hollywood was ignorant and/or extremely scared they would offend somebody, it's spelled J-e-s-u-s.). The one thing I found to be odd occured in the final episode. Sheb Wooley had the starring role for that particular episode, ""Incident of the Roman Candles"". Producers nowadays wouldn't ever have a featured cast member starring in the final episode of the season.

The series has great stars, great writing, and more location shooting then I recalled (not as many obviously painted backdrops as I remembered from watching the reruns in the 70's).

The quality of the dvds are acceptable, but not as glorious as the ""Gunsmoke"" videos.  With the release of Rawhide, Have Gun will Travel, and Twilight Zone (all now on dvd), you can actually come close to recreating a Friday night in the late 50's on CBS (at least as I remember it).  If that sounds scary....it's because it is!

However, this is THE GREATEST television cowboy series ever. Better than ""Maverick"", better than ""Wagon Train"", better than ""Gunsmoke"", better than ""Daniel Boone"", better than all of them.

Why?

Because, first and foremost, the writing is fantastic. Almost each story is unpredictable, has twists of fate you don't expect, and sometimes the characters surprise you with their actions, because they are real human beings, not cardboard cutouts of characters.

The series is shot beautifully, directed impeccably, and acted excellently.

I had forgotten how good this was, but got it just for nostalgia. After I watched it, I realized how great it is!

I would recommend this series to ANYone and EVERYone! Doesn't matter if you are old or young, if you like good tv shows, you'll like this!

Just for comparison, I love the new shows, like ""The Shield"", ""24"", ""Prison Break"" and so on. True, these particular shows are highly suspenseful and faster moving than ""Rawhide"".

  Is it too hard to do it? The big problem here is that you are losing a lot of potencial buyers that don't understand English very well and need a little help.
  I don't have any problem with English but I don't buy the DVD's only for me but for the whole family. For that reason audio/subtitles are very important.

2555904,5,B000F9T70K,"Although the show ran on TV 40-50 years ago, it is still one of the
greatest Western TV-movie ever made. Not only because of great performances of Eric Flemming, Clint Eastwood, Paul Brenegar,... and guest stars; but also
because of the theme and content of the incidents, where the morals,
principles, humanly views of life are in focus.
In some incidents the popular concept and understanding of the term ""hero"" is masterly challenged. Heroes are human beings too, and they can be wrong og make mistakes. We all do what we have to do; have to live with our mistakes and learn lessons from them to become a better human being.
There is not a single episode in this box set collection, where one could
not draw a useful conclusion out of the events and the way of handling them through the story. Some of the stories are actually based on real life
events in the second half of 19th century in the US.",1159401600,19,901,4.5
2555905,5,B000F9T70K,"As the producer says about the only just ""in town' episode, he got a lot of angry mail afterwards because people loved the great outdoor action of the drovers and their cattle as they constantly moved into the unknown territory of the Sedalia Trail. This great long running western adventurer had one of the best ensemble casts of all the westerns. Clint Eastwood, who became the popular star, played youthful beefcake, brave and quick tempered ramrod, balanced by Eric Fleming's hard nosed, mature and responsible trail boss. In addition, Paul Brineger plays the classic tough, short tempered and frequently criticized chuck wagon cook who runs the camp when the cattle stop moving and he is one of the many actors who add so much to this western. The supporting casts features two men that look and act like real drovers and not Hollywood cowboys, Steve Raines as Jim Quince and Rocky Shahan as Joe Scarelet. Rounding out the cast is the man in the middle, Sheb Wooley (High Noon) who plays Pete Nolan the experienced scout and expert on Indians. And there is even a touch of comedy relief played by James Murdock as Mushy, the cook's louse.  Robert Cabal as Hey Soos, the Ramuda wrangler, has a limited spot the first year. What was unique about Rawhide is that it had a real grimy touch of realism with a real cow herd,  a predominately outdoor set that looks like north Texas and it features great acting and dialogue such as ""You knew we were drovers by our look or are smell?"" This first year has a touch of naivety in some of the episodes but Eric Fleming's booming voice and his character always add the touch of reality. His motto is business first and avoid unnecessary entanglements but when they intersect trouble they tend to get involved. This first year has a great collection of guest stars that include Lon Chaney, Jr., Martin Milner (Route 66), Brian Keith (Mountain Men), Beverly Garland (My Three Sons), James Drury (The Virginian), Rick Jason (Combat), Leslie Nielson (Airplane), Martin Landau (Mission Impossible), Linda Cristal (High Chaparral) and on. The stories seem to get better and better as the series developed particularly the battle over water in the ""Dry Drive"" and there is even a psychological drama of a shadowy hired killer stalking the men in the herd called ""Executioner"". Excellent first year, the cast stayed through the run until Sheb Wooley (also a singer who sang the great 50s hit ""Purple People Eater') left for two years and Fleming skipped the last season and ironically drowned in his last film. The only blemish besides the ""in town"" episode was an excellent episode about wolves stalking the herd with a killer in their midst. Due to the lack of trained wolves, it clearly appears that they had to use several German shepherds running in the dark. But overlook that and you have one of the more fascinating episodes. The quality of the DVD film is excellent although in some episodes the dark scenes are not very discernible. Each episode includes an episode guide that often highlights the guest stars and there is a write up on Clint. Excellent 7 disc set with all 22 hour long episodes (without commercials of course).

That said, I am not satisfied with the quality of the DVD set.  Disk 1 is very jumpy.  I figured it was no big deal, and just ignored it.  Now, I find that disks 5 & 6 both freeze after the CBS intro, and I have to manually play each episode one at a time.  This makes for a total of 3 defective disks out of a total of 6 so far.  I've enjoy shopping on-line from Amazon, but I must say that I am disappointed with the fact that there is not a customer service number that allows you to contact a live person.  I don't want to go through the bother of returning the set, as they do play.  Still, I am unhappy with the quality of the DVD set, and find the ratio of defective disks disturbing (so far 50%).  Also, wanted to make others aware of the potential for faulty disk sets.  Otherwise the show is great, and I am enjoying it very much.",1156723200,13,1000,4.051020408163265
2555909,5,B000F9T70K,"In the late 1950, Television was filled with Westerns like Maverick (with James Garner), Gunsmoke, Cheyenne, Bat Masterson (with Gene Barry), Stony Burke (with a young Jack Lord), Fury (with Peter Graves), Wanted Dead or Alive  (with Steve Mcqueen-see my review),Wagon Train (with Ward Bond),Riverboat (with Darrin Mcgavin and Burt Reynolds), Zorro (with Guy Willians-WHY ISNT THIS ON DVD yet!),  Have Gun Will Travel (with Richard Boone) Sugarfoot, Tales of the Texas Rangers, and the Lone Ranger. Later such Western fare or western style shows like  The Wild Wild West, F Troop and The Big Valley (all reviewed by me) came later with mixed results from the 1950 glut of TV

However, in 1959, Rawhide premered on TV. It was a trail blazer. A cattle drive across the  country with many adventures along the way. It also  introduced the world to the talents of Clint Eastwood. This is where Eastwood earned  his western chops for such future western fare as Unforgiven, Fistful of Dollars, Hang Em High and the classic the Good, the Bad and the Ugly.

Th first season was shot is glorious black and white, anything before 1965 was rare for COLOR TV..Walt Disney was smart and did many of his shows in color (like Davy Crockett, Swamp Fox, Texas John Slaughter), but most westerns in the late 1950 was just Black and whote. However what the show lacks in color hues, it makes up for in action and good drama. I dodnt know why we need to have our TV shows shows latent with RED blood from crime and hosptal shows , dirty sepia color for westerns rather than green grass and blue sky. The show didn't need  to seem so holy than thou--we knew the heroes and you could see the villians a mile away.

Maybe because these show were from 1959, some of the edge of seen it before has taken root. BUT in the show's defense, it was great adventure-high television. It wasn't art, just a good show a family can watch  TOHETHER and it still is!

 There are NO EXTRAS, one would wish Eastwood would reflect on his western beginning and do an audio commentary-but NO LUCK..maybe another volume!

Now is the easy part,  would I recomend it? IN A HEARTBEAT. So why aren't you ording this yet?

I liked the show, so I got a couple more tapes on Ebay...that was it, I was hooked! After I extinguished the available supply there, I started looking elsewhere for my fix, when I stumbled on Amazon's pre-order of THE ENTIRE FIRST SEASON ON DVD!!! SWEEEEET!

So far, I've watched the first four discs & am absolutely loving every episode! Anyone who is a fan of older westerns will absolutely love this series, I promise.

There were also many big name guest stars in these episodes & it's great seeing them when a lot of them were fledglings in their careers.

Thanks so much for releasing season one, I sincerely hope that the rest of the following episodes will be available soon too, I will snap up a copy of every one!",1154131200,29,892,4.36144578313253

In one of the episodes on disc 7 Clint kisses Linda Crystal. I decided not to continue the drive after watching the first season. The series is black and white. I prefer color.

If you're looking for good stuff to watch consider miniseries like The Astronauts Wives Club (2015), Band of Brothers (2001), Frank Herberts Dune (2000), Frank Herberts Children of Dune (2003), Into the West (2005), Lonesome Dove (1989), Manhattan (2014-2015), Return to Lonesome Dove (1993), Pride and Prejudice (1995), Taken (2002), and The 10th Kingdom (2000), which are all terrific because they have clear beginnings that establish an objective, then strong middles and conclusive endings where the goal is achieved, like a good novel.

Other shows Ive really enjoyed include Battlestar Galactica (2004-2009), Breaking Bad (2008-2013), Cowboy Bebop (1998), Downton Abbey (2010-2015), Firefly (2002), Game of Thrones (2011-2019), Granite Flats (2013-2015), The IT Crowd (2006-2013), Jericho (2006-2008), Lost (2004-2010), Merlin (2008-2012), The Prisoner (1967-1968), Rome (2005-2007), Spartacus: Gods of the Arena (2011), Spartacus: Blood and Sand (2010), Stargate: SG-1 (1997-2007), Stargate: Atlantis (2004-2009), Star Trek (1966-1969) and Star Trek Voyager (1995-2001). I didn't list any contemporary series Im following that don't have an end date yet, not conducive to binge watching from beginning to finish.

8119339,4,B000F9T70K,"Aside from the occasional mediocre acting and the sometimes obvious sets, and the one curiously bad episode appropriately titled ""The Incident of the Curious Street"" (what a waste of a really good abandoned town set...) where the characters linger around mid way through episode as if the writers had forgotten the show is an hour long not half-an-hour!  Even old pro guest actress Mercedes McCambridge (Johnny Guitar) seems to struggle through the meanderings.
BUT, that one aside, RAWHIDE THE FIRST SEASON is a fine disc (no extras) with that great Arizona desert, mountain footage filmed in a very effective, gritty black-and-white as the ""drovers"" drive their massive herd of cattle through all of Texas into Missour-a on the Sedalia Trail.
Again, (and even some of the obvious 'camp' sets are well constructed) the realistic dirt and dust of this great cattle drive makes for plenty of authentic viewing that reminded me of just how obviously fake the old color ""Bonanza"" sets had been.  RAWHIDE should be considered the best western tv of the era other than Gunsmoke (even Gunsmoke -  kinda - lasted too long).
Also, you can be on the lookout for a bevy of stars while watching.
Gloria Talbot (Wanted Dead or Alive episode;  ""I Married a Monster From Outer Space"") guest stars in the ""Calico Gun"" Incident episode playing a sexy, femme fatale (she should have done this more) with Jack Lord (original Hawaii Five-0) as her bad man boyfriend.
My RAWHIDE SEASON ONE volume had to be turned up more than most of my videos but the black-and-white picture is all but perfect; and I amused myself before watching 2 or 3 episodes in a row by listening - once for sure - to those great Frankie Laine vocals!  He does belt out that ""Rawhiiiiiiiiiiiide"" quite well, quite effective, surprisingly well done, entertaining tune.
This is well worth the 22 episodes plus one from Season 2 ""Incident of Roman Candles"" with RAWHIDE regular Sheb Wooley (""Hoosiers"" basketball movie) as Pete Nolan basically the lead (in this one) with the boy who seems to be lying about his missing parents.
But, Eric Fleming is basically the star of the whole cattle drive show as Gil Favor.
Paul Brinegar is the multi-faceted cook ""Wishbone"" sometimes, quite amusing with that western-slang dialogue.
""Clint"" is the trail boss in training sometimes too easily persuaded by a pretty face (see Gloria Talbot; and, oh, almost forgot, a young, Hispanic Linda Cristal appears reminding me of a young Linda Darnell ... ""love the way you talk...""  Clint as Rowdy grins... and you can't blame him.  Cristal is stunning).
The RAWHIDE crew sure come across their fair share of ""Jaspers"" (crazy; bad) on the Sedalia Trail.
Dan Duryea plays a stalking, quiet gunfighter in another good episode (did Clint have this stoic gunfighter in mind ...? later in his career...?)
Regulars ""drovers"" Quince, Mushy, and Scarlet were there from Day One Episode One.
RAWHIDE SEASON I is a strong 4 star rating.",1499126400,3,2958,4.915831663326653
8119340,4,B000F9T70K,"It's really a shame that this -- Eric Fleming's show -- is sold as if it were a Clint Eastwood vehicle. Yes OF COURSE Clint is plenty good in his role as second-lead. But Fleming does too good a job to be relegated to being one-quarter Clint's size on the cover (which only furthers the dishonesty by looking as if it were filmed in color); RAWHIDE would easily be just as good without Clint -- and sometimes was, when he was off filming FISTFUL -- but not without Fleming. Story after story, he's put into difficult situations, and Eric Fleming finds just the right nuance to make believable his tough decisions and shrewd judgment calls. It takes a fine line to pull off ""Not now; it's their fight"" and ""Sometimes a man's gotta do what he's gotta do"" in the same character -- even in the same episode. Clint would learn to do it as well, an we get to see that -- but Fleming already does it from the start.

Meanwhile, the real star of RAWHIDE is the writing. Westerns have always been about sorting out moral situations, and RAWHIDE does not flinch from addressing some tough issues. As a result, we don't always get resolution by the end of an episode; sometimes they just figure out how to get through that day's biggest problem.  Yes, they sometimes have characters doing things they ought to know not to do, just to get the story to go where those issues are; such is TV production. But they don't shy from giving women strong roles (in 1959) or allowing character ambiguity for their villains -- and they certainly don't try to make cowboy life look better than it was.

In sum: it's almost always worthwhile, with excellent actors in the main roles and some pretty good guest stars to help out. STAR TREK fans will appreciate seeing DeForest Kelley in one of the villain roles, while Lon Chaney Jr gets a strong opportunity to play a role that isn't a monster.

Oh yes -- and it does indeed semi-feature a promising young Clint Eastwood, before he got famous. He's pretty good too :)",1498435200,,1992,4.494475138121547
