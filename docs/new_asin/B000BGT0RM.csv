8086576,5,B000BGT0RM,"This remarkable man ruined himself physically and financially to win the war of independence in the ""Illinois Territory"" for the United States. He and his men should be remembered among our greatest heroes. Thomas Jefferson and the State of Virginia allowed his loans to the nation to go un-repaid. He died alone and Penniless just west of Louisville, KY. He deserved better. I believe several of the States IOUs to him have turned up as recently as the last decade. It may even be within the last couple of years.",1390608000,5,514,4.722222222222222
8086577,5,B000BGT0RM,"This History Channel miniseries examines four episodes from what was the western frontier during the colonial period.  There's a great biography of Robert Rogers of Rogers Rangers, a legendary figure little noted today except as the subject of the 1940 movie ""Northwest Passage"" and as the patron saint of the US Army Rangers.  There is also the account of George Rogers Clark, who neutralized the British in the West by capturing several important outposts in lightning raids. Also: Pontiac and his nearly successful war against New England settlers and Tecumseh's later unification of the tribes in what was the last opportunity Native Americans ever really had to halt the settlers westward spread.",1215043200,9,701,5.25
